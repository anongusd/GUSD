@GoAwayGreen My kid once pitched a fit because he wasn't able to play at the honey wall. I mentioned it 8 years later and all the emotion was still there
@paleomexicano It recreates what I'm used to (on Twitter)
@clupbert Yes, I just have an abiding interest in knock-on effects.
@clupbert They have a real problem sharing prosperity with those they share a currency with, is my point
@clupbert That part can be fixed, bill introductions are just campaign brochures
@clupbert And we can't really replicate the German model of corporate governance until we adopt the Amero as currency, make Susan Collins president, and start squeezing Mexico
@clupbert I think we'd see a lot of growth in companies making $999,999,999.99 in revenue

@MrAlAnderson @Goodtweet_man Actually reading it again I have no idea what he's saying and I'm not sure he does either.

@cmill126 (Although it does make it easier to own rounds lots of the libs, which means a better price point)
@cmill126 That doesn't affect the fundamentals

@Goodtweet_man @NostromoSerg And to tell the chicken, "Stop being such a pecker."

@Goodtweet_man @NostromoSerg The farmer gets mad and DEMANDS the chicken stop pecking so much. The chicken gets nervous which makes it peck more.		So the farmer gets out his ax and waves it around. And now things are out of control, the chicken is pecking like crazy.
@Goodtweet_man @NostromoSerg Short version: A farmer buys a chicken. The chicken pecks a lot. Peck peck peck. 		The farmer likes the chicken, but the pecking gets annoying after a while.		The farmer asks the chicken to stop pecking so much. It doesn't work.

It's just more fun to use questions pick apart the nonsense the panelists said than to add some nonsense of your own.
If you have a comment, and no force could possibly stop you from making it, the preface is "My question is how appropriate would it be to say that‚Ä¶" AND KEEP IT BRIEF
Incidentally the only way you get good at asking questions at panels is if you take the mike and be willing to screw up
Here's how you ask a question at a panel. You take notes, you find some kind of metaphor they used and you say "you said Y was like X, and what kind of X is that X?"
Have there been panels about how to turn a "more of a comment than a question" into a question?
@mcnhobbs @stevielark Also if someone close to you cuts you down like that maybe take a look at the critical energy you are putting out‚Ä¶ this is a thing I maybe learned last week

@avermeule That's why I said "metaphorically"! Trump's personal warmth such as it is compared favorably not just to Hillary but also to Republican's memories of the Bush years.
@avermeule He was running against Bush in the primary, literally and metaphorically, and the fact that he thinks his electoral college win was the biggest ever has always indicated to me that GWB is his basis of comparison

@phillyrich1 @HConomics @DeanClancy I think so, it may make more sense to put some mutual funds in trust and buy the insurance closer to when they have earnings to protect. But you can put a lump sum into permanent life insurance, definitely.
@phillyrich1 @HConomics @DeanClancy You can do that if you have the cash
@_notevenwrong You're a good dude, glad to hear you're taking action.
@HConomics @DeanClancy Sure! Still, we spend so much on insurances of all kinds (especially if you include the 15.3% that goes to SS/Medicare)

This is my dumb metaphor though, based on an going-on two year obsession of mine that has improved my life in a variety of ways. I'm open to discussion on whatever terms.
James Braid was able to remove 70 pound tumors without anaesthetic in India using hypnosis. He‚Ä¶ wasn't quite able to do that in England. Context matters!
You can point at cognitive-behavioral therapy and say, "Look, hypnosis works!" and you can look at the Nordic countries and say "Look, Marxism works!"  Or you could just go with it and call things whatever you want to call them
My answer has been Marxism is like hypnotism, which is another thing that is useful but considered dangerous and unscientific in the Catholic Encyclopedia.
And that's Marxism like what? https://t.co/Z0AFefRGcZ

@PatriotTurtle @Dadinista That's a skill, though. It's way easier to just get the other person to talk
@PatriotTurtle @Dadinista One of the best things to do is to be able to go straight into a metaphorical story. Like if somebody asked about the Pope and I started talking about the CEO at my day job,without ever explaining what I mean.
@PatriotTurtle @Dadinista Yeah, would go with "He's kind of like my boss, so it's complicated. And what do you think?" I'm willing to let people vent a bit though.

@DrFDBoley And by self-help: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People calls itself a new paradigm and discusses Kuhn. There are others methods that do the same.
@DrFDBoley I think a paradigm shift would be the former, not the latter. If I thought there was a way to overturn doctrine I'd say nothing and go to Confession. Thing is I'm giving people the benefit of the doubt here.
@DrFDBoley I've actually thought further about this, and whether or not a "paradigm shift" is just a nice way of saying something else, something in the sense of Einsteinian physics being separate from Newtonian engineering. Extremely tentative about this though

Long and short of it is that a paradigm shift does not have to be a rupture. It can just be a reframe, or a change in perspective. How this applies to AL I have no idea, but it definitely applies to how we talk about it.
Since it's 1:49 AM let me say that George Weigel got paradigm shifts interestingly wrong and you have to have a deep understanding of the self-help genre to understand how.

@tobacco_dad Cool, brainstorm ideas from there.		I'd also recommend listening to the Zig Ziglar Born To Win Seminar until your ears bleed

@RickSheridan We can be, yes.
@RickSheridan Thank you. Simple fact is I love my country immensely and chose based on that. McM's evolution afterwards does not affect the question.
@Gregory__Adams ("nation" in this case meaning whatever goofy polling crosstab I am on)
@Gregory__Adams Yeah. My justification for my vote was twofold: Virginia was not going to be close, and "What is my nation? Who talks of my nation?"
Why is everyone screaming "Regret your vote for McMullin!"		You don't understand: I am utterly shameless

@djhlaw I've read this like 3 times https://t.co/bWzyVcz4JQ
@djhlaw That 2000 Reform Party run was the weirdest thing. Allying with a socialist to head off Trump, running as a more conventional conservative, who also happened to be allied with Tony Robbins
@djhlaw The whole book is just fascinating and sad
@djhlaw Buchanan didn't reply, Novak replied on his behalf and attacked Frum (whom Buckley quoted) in the process.
It all goes back to the In Search of Anti-Semitism symposium. It's all there.
The story of conservative punditry is basically Robert Novak and his acolytes versus the world, forever and ever
@OneFineJay No wonder your house is worth 200k, that kind of rake holds down the mortgage payment

@AngusDwyer The estate tax is really weird. If you want to go deeper the estate tax punishes asset transfer in favor of transfer of knowledge, skills and connections
@AngusDwyer Obviously you'll make more money investing in businesses because durable goods depreciate and upkeep on residential real estate kills the gains
@AngusDwyer Well, equities &amp; bonds.
@AngusDwyer You can find a ton of people who have gigantic positions in a single stock who "don't want to pay the taxes."		Because writing a check for 15% of the gains is way more painful than an equivalent loss

@DrJayRichards Fallows too! Tough industry to predict though

@tobacco_dad @Dadinista @peregrinator1 It's really hard for me to say one is a Christmas movie and one isn't when the dramatic arc is so similar and not Christmas-specific
@tobacco_dad @Dadinista @peregrinator1 John McLane is essentially George Bailey, Hans Gruber is essentially Potter taking over the town (Nakatomi Plaza), who acts like a mastermind but is actually a petty thief
