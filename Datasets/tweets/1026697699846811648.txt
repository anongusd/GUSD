@brianschatz All the way with Amy K
@ScottWalker This account is like he went through a messy breakup and is now trying to show everyone heâ€™s much better off without her
@JayInslee Whoever designed your logo should be fired
@sonyawh55919237 @ewarren Where did you get the sign?
@PelosiForSF This really shows who can get stuff done #Amy2020
@_SJPeace_ Amy Klobuchar
@Chas10Buttigieg Is it possible to make a culinary contribution instead of a financial one?
@Chas10Buttigieg Whatâ€™s your favourite/least favourite part about campaigning?
@amyklobuchar Youâ€™re at the top of my list
@realDonaldTrump You didnâ€™t even use 'illegal' in your argument. You just said the ethnicity of a certain group of potential immigrants to cite unnecessary fear in people. This is racist and absurd, it needs to stop.
@PeteButtigieg What are your thoughts on the direction the Party is going at the National level?
@siano2020 Sheâ€™s my #1 choice for the nomination
@Joshua_4_WA Did he actually resign?
@JoeBarri VP, Speaker of the House, Speaker Pro Temp of the Senate, Secretary of State, then Secretary of the Treasury
@JayInslee Thank you for doing the right thing and calling on Northam to resign
@SenhorRaposa But it has also grown from the 115th
@JeffFlake Can we get a Flake-McCaskill broadcasted road trip?
@_alex_joshua @_Political_Nerd Nobody is going to mention Kim Schrier?
@Tinapo We canâ€™t afford another distraction
@HowardSchultz How about not
@JoeBiden This sounds like a statement from a presidential candidate #Biden2020
@lisa4congress Of course not. She spends all her time in DC rubbing elbows with corporate lobbyists
@tariqnasheed Maybe, just maybe, itâ€™s because Kamala Harris is black?
@clairecmc Iâ€™m loving Twitter Claire
@ABC Are we supposed to care?
@peterdaou Amy Klobuchar
@realDonaldTrump If you really cared about America first, you should open the government and do your job for the AMERICAN people
@HawleyMO 22/23 people in this photo donâ€™t even have uteruses

RT @Redpainter1: @SenSchumer @brianschatz @ChrisMurphyCT Iâ€™ll gladly RT it in this thread for you all: https://t.co/0jXbKSOEju
@JRobbinsIF1 @iFiberOneNews Sylvia Hammond is the only person who deserves this seat
@funder @TheDemCoalition Nancy Pelosi
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends Sheâ€™s still fresher than you will ever be
@lisa4congress @POTUS @cathymcmorris Please keep fighting and standing up for the people of the 5th District. #DumpCathy
@cathymcmorris All they want to do is have an open, transparent government. Apparently that is too much to ask from Republicans
@burgessev https://t.co/jWKfADZYAK
@SenatorCantwell You and @PattyMurray make Washington proud
@IlhanMN @RashidaTlaib @AOC As well as 25 female Senators! For the first time, my state (WA) has a majority female delegation with two female Senators and 5/10 female Representatives
@kanyewest In 1860 99% of Southern Blacks were slaves. But according to you that was a choice.
RT @Texas_Dexter: How would you explain this to the insurance company? ðŸ˜¨ðŸ˜¨ https://t.co/gXN0nXO6tk
@WillisJermane Doesnâ€™t matter. Sheâ€™s still better than Trump
@Joshua_4_WA Would you vote for/ support and Moderate or Establishment Democratic candidate?
@ewarren Liz Warren 2020
@Joshua_4_WA Do you have a website?
@joncoopertweets Amy Klobuchar or Elizabeth Warren
@MrDane1982 Fighting racism with racism is not a solution
@siano2020 Klobuchar/Beto
@siano2020 Heâ€™s had so many resignation letters they could comprise a book
@RedmondSurvivor Does Reem need to speak to the manager?
@AOC It should be Alex from the block
@Ocasio2018 What did your friends, family, and co-workers think when you first told them about your campaign?
@TomiLahren @foxandfriends This is why weâ€™re pushing for background checks
@SadAmericans3 @zenfrodo @BravenakBlog Ted Cruz
@AkkiJ_ Literally the best thing Iâ€™ve seen all day
@TravisAllen02 Elizabeth Warren
@JTJ_TCUFROG90 @DiamondandSilk Limit of 6 terms for House and 2 terms for Senate. 12 years in each chamber
@DiamondandSilk Thank you for agreeing with @Ocasio2018
@realDonaldTrump @DiamondandSilk Is this actually real?
@BiologistDan This makes me sick. How can someone take the life of an amazingly beautiful creature just so they can call it theirs and have bragging rights!?
@lisa4congress @Ocasio2018 Go Lisa! I was proud to vote for you this year
@Kishan_Devani @OscarNunezLA I voted no because Pence knows how to maneuver through Congress
@lisa4congress @cathymcmorris She only represents half of her district
@ACTBrigitte Fund the wall out of Hillaryâ€™s email. You seem to have a hard enough time getting over that

@Joshua_4_WA What are your thoughts?
@aj_simonton If they can beat Trump then Iâ€™m all for it
@TomiLahren How low can you sink to blame the death of a child on her parents because they were trying to provide a better life? This was 100% Border Patrols fault for kidnapping and neglecting children to the point of death
@cameron_kasky Welcome to my TED talk
@iamwandasykes @realDonaldTrump RT with your proportionally sized hands
@Wethepeoplehope Bill Clinton
@BravenakBlog Has he announced yet?
@Ocasio2018 @RepDelBene @DrKimSchrier @RepJayapal
@myserenity69 Bullock, Biden, Warren
@Ocasio2018 Just out of curiosity, does your office get a budget separate from your own salary to be used for staff/interns?
@Joshua_4_WA Elizabeth Warren
@Joshua_4_WA Le Baguette
@Joshua_4_WA Where can we contact you?
@Joshua_4_WA Itâ€™s cool and all, just I donâ€™t know if people will take you seriously enough
@Joshua_4_WA Thatâ€™s cool. Is your logo really going to be the dragon?
@Joshua_4_WA Although I donâ€™t live in your district, Iâ€™m still wondering, do you have any yards signs, bumper stickers, or any other campaign merchandise?
RT @connerhallmark: Dinner date didnâ€™t go as planned https://t.co/BwBIOBzY7Z
@Joshua_4_WA @Ocasio2018 This is unrelated, but will you be running as a Democrat, Green, something else?
@KateFlannery Welcome to the PNW
@Joshua_4_WA @RedBeretsM4All Ok thanks! I was just wondering. Also, I think itâ€™s cool that you are willing to interact personally with people on your social media platforms
@Joshua_4_WA @RedBeretsM4All Why have you decided to run straight for US House instead of State Legislature or something?
@Joshua_4_WA If you make official appearances at local colleges that will produce some media attention
@Joshua_4_WA @AndrewYangVFA I see that point, and I agree we should invest in people, but how will we eventually reach the point where people wonâ€™t need a basic income?
@Joshua_4_WA @AndrewYangVFA Just curious, what is your reasoning for a basic income, and how will it be paid for?
@Joshua_4_WA Give it 2 years and youâ€™ll be there for a different reason
@Ocasio2018 Are you the one who actually tweets and replies? Because thatâ€™s really cool if you do. Most other Members have a staffer do it
@realDonaldTrump Than
@Stop_Trump20 When you realize itâ€™s his turn to sleep with Donald tonight
@realDonaldTrump I thought you said Collusion wasnâ€™t a crime?
@lisa4congress @andybillig Lisa, I highly encourage you to run for Governor in 2020 if Inslee resigns
@VoteOjeda2020 @realDonaldTrump Your vote for Trump in 2016 is concerning. What are you going to do to let us know youâ€™re a viable candidate who deserves the nomination?
@HillaryClinton Please do NOT run in 2020. We canâ€™t afford another loss

@davidhogg111 Are you doing alright?
@DiamondandSilk The counties that are performing the recounts have higher Democrat registration
@realDonaldTrump Part of the Democratic process is having every vote accounted for. Unfortunately, democracy doesnâ€™t seem to fit your agenda, Mr. President
@lisa4congress Will Lisa continue to use this account?
@JacquelinMaycum So sheâ€™s higher ranked than presumptive Speaker Nancy Pelosi?
@lisa4congress You ran a great campaign Lisa and I was proud to vote for you!
@johnkrasinski I voted by mail so I didnâ€™t get a sticker. But it was my first Election and I was incredibly proud and excited to vote!
@lisa4congress @cathymcmorris Happy Election Day. Iâ€™m excited to watch you win Lisa! You are the best option for Eastern WA and it was so cool to get to meet you back in September
@davidhogg111 I already plan to run for office
@lisa4congress My whole household voted for you!
@HerreraBeutler That sounded so fake Iâ€™m surprised thereâ€™s not a 'Made in China' sticker on it
@elizabethforma @Scholten4Iowa We have a chance to flip three Republican seats in WA. Please help us out
@lisa4congress The people are energized to vote for Lisa! We can help her ride the #bluewave to victory!
@maddow @OscarNunezLA Matt Manweller is another WA Republican Legislator up for re-election. He has been fired for sexually harassing young college females. Please help us defeat him

@realDonaldTrump @cathymcmorris You wanted to drain the swamp right? Then vote @lisa4congress because CMR is the swampiest member of Congress
@JayInslee Please come to Eastern WA and help campaign for Democrats running for State Leg
@ScottWalker How dare you attack my Governor of my State when our economy is booming under Inslee! No matter how many terms you get elected to, you could never match up to the people of the PNW
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You canâ€™t walk away from something you were never even apart of
@lisa4congress @cathymcmorris Cathy McMorris Rodgers had been in power too long with too little results. Iâ€™m proud I can vote for someone who actually has a positive record and will benefit the people of Eastern Washington
@AndrewGillum Ooh Gurl
@davidhogg111 The power rests with those who are upcoming
@realDonaldTrump Isnâ€™t it you and your party that controls all three branches of government?
@lisa4congress This makes me even prouder of the fact that for the very first time, I voted and I cast my ballot for you
@KamalaHarris Is this in the form of a monthly check?
@lisa4congress I voted for you today!
@GovInslee Please visit the 13th LD and campaign for Sylvia Hammond
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Imagine if she listed her charity as her 2020 campaign, then Trump would have to donate $1 million to his opponent
@PramilaJayapal @ElectLong @DrKimSchrier Have you helped campaign for @lisa4congress?
@realDonaldTrump Are you forgetting that the districts your party drew up in PA were deemed gerrymandered by the court? Itâ€™s not the fight of his life, itâ€™s a fair election
@lisa4congress @cathymcmorris Iâ€™m loving the amount of sass in this post. Go Lisa! Iâ€™m voting for you!
@lisamurkowski Thank you for making the right decision. Now, could you please convince Senator Collins?
@davidhogg111 My state provides mail-in ballots so people donâ€™t have to miss work/school to do their civic duty. Letâ€™s make sure this becomes nationwide
@davidhogg111 Will you be voting for any incumbents?
@lisa4congress @CCofSpokane It looks like someone messed with your Wikipedia page, it says youâ€™re an American actress who has starred in all these movies.   You might want to look into that
@DiamondandSilk Oh yes, men are totally the victims here when theyâ€™re sexually harassing your sisters, mothers, or daughters.
@realDonaldTrump Thereâ€™s literally no poll that shows your approval above 50%
@realDonaldTrump Well according to you, collusion isnâ€™t a crime. So how can a Witch Hunt exist on something you claim is not a violation?
@realDonaldTrump Since when have we started blaming natural disasters on people?
@SenatorCantwell I voted for you today, Senator Cantwell keep up the good work!
