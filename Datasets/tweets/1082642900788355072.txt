@LugiaBerry Coming in the next day to just see a big pink and white blob in the bakery~
@LugiaBerry Imagining a scenario where he had some sort of ice cream machine implemented into his bakery, then closing for "technical difficulties" when really he just absolutely gorged on all the machine made while just growing and growing in size~
@LugiaBerry Goodness, just hearing this makes me incredibly more curious to see the last part~
@Caudlewag @BlimpFurry I've been into inflation (and weight gain on a side note) for a few years now. Favorite methods have gotta be water through a tube (voluntary or forced), or with slime (sentient or not) going into something. Probably the biggest size I love is enough to fill a room~

@LugiaBerry Only six~? Be hooonest, you can fit way more in there.
@LugiaBerry Close to 300. 400 at most.
@LugiaBerry Kinda just imagining anyone outside, seeing a big white blob filling the inside of a building and the window views~ The temptation to poke it just be huge.
@LugiaBerry Big enough to fill a building~ Juuust enough.
