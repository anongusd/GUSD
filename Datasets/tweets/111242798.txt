@Bryan_climate @SpeakerPelosi @AyannaPressley We’re on the same side, but I disagree - it is bad.		Global warming is a result of all those you mentioned. But it’s also further accelerating the loss of natural habitats / starving wildlife. 		But I agree - we need global pollution remediation.
@Bryan_climate @SpeakerPelosi @AyannaPressley I know.. but CC doesn’t give an effect of impending doom as much as global warming does. IMO anyway..		I know it can snow - my point was that it hasn’t. Lots of damage from storm surges last winter - rising sea levels due to melted arctic		This planet is a mess and it’s our fault
@SpeakerPelosi can we take back the phrase “Global Warming” now? @AyannaPressley		Climate change doesn’t capture the urgency of this matter... it’s January &amp; there’s been 0 snow on the ground in Boston.

As im sure u can tell its a miracle i didnt yell at anyone tn. No matter how much i wanted to punch them in the face ☺️
U know what i change my mind id prob sell another drink on 1/2 left.. And i wouldnt hangout at the end of the bar to wait after i ring it in
Oh NOT TO MENTION... KNOW THE TABLE NUMBERS. At the very least the ones in your fuckingg section dude what the fuck.
Sell someone another drink if they have 1/3 left. Automatically fill their waters if its less than half full and offer if its about half.
Blows my fucking mind.
I swear i almost killed all the staff... Not sure why someone would ring food in &amp; not provide their guest w fucking silverware to eat it w.
I forgot how annoying opening a new restaurant is. I missed a bunch of training cause i work during the day so i ran food to get familiar tn

@njh2005 @missemmft @IamIDenver probly not if you cant give me a function to calculate how you derive the value of a persons work.. Is the
@njh2005 @joe564338 @SenSanders https://t.co/RKDhkvNWAi the systematic withholding of power from citz in the US is not freedom nor liberty
@njh2005 @joe564338 @SenSanders no it isnt.
@njh2005 @joe564338 @SenSanders i agree but we obviously have different views on what  defining properties of freedom are..or how to achieve
@njh2005 @joe564338 @SenSanders i am all for making something of yourself and being able to enjoy the life that you worked hard to create...
@njh2005 @joe564338 @SenSanders that is where you are wrong. Freedom is a term grossly misused in our society. We are not free.
@HuffPostImpact @TheWorldPost heyyyyy i got one of those even tho im allergic to almonds 😂 lol i was like ill give it to someone
@njh2005 @joe564338 @SenSanders no im judging you based on everything youve said as your reasoning why you think youre infallible...
I have a hard time not arguing my point.. Not so easy in 140 characters or less though
@njh2005 @missemmft @IamIDenver @SenSanders do you think corps claiming their co. Operates overseas as not to pay taxes "earning" money?
@njh2005 @missemmft @IamIDenver @SenSanders because there isnt a $ market open to support the field theyre in.. Law, science, nevermind ed.
@njh2005 @missemmft @IamIDenver @SenSanders smart people are forced to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars for careers that they cant get
@njh2005 @missemmft @IamIDenver @SenSanders no wanting to have more than you need at the detriment of extremely hardworking individuals is.
@njh2005 @SenSanders yeah it does and the people of this country would have economic freedom if legislators  werent in the pocket of corps
@njh2005 @SenSanders okay &amp;their political system involved legislature&amp; a judicial system &amp;was still completely based on democracy too right
@njh2005 @SenSanders can you cite some factual info to support this claim? I thiiiink the ideology of our current system is pretty murderous
Talking to stupid people is funny cause you know they dont understand anything thats going on 😭😭😭😂😂😂😭😭😭 #itsokay #juststoptrying #youfailed
@njh2005 @SenSanders im not sure you know what words mean.... You shouldnt use the words of your therapist to try to sound smart #notworking

@SenSanders we love you Senator Sanders!
"He might be like another 10 more minutes i'm sorry" my apt is 5 mins from there soooo thanks they def forgot...😢 i dont do well when hungry
Lmfao so dramatic but really.. I need to call and ask if they care about me and my hunger or if i mean nothing to them...
Uhhhgg like i was just cleaning so much all day i didnt think to / couldnt stop and eat &amp; now im having an existential crisis
When you realize youre super hungry so you order a salad w grilled chicken (real big order ya know) &amp; they say 45m-1hr but its been 1hr15m 😩
@NoFencejumpers your ignorance is appalling. Denial of fact doesnt make you right.You might want to check your sources better than Fox"News"
I donno how much longer i can try to make this place clean... I feel like i'm done even tho its not...
@SenSanders not sure what they think theyll do with all the money theyre hoarding when the earth is no longer a habitable plantet
