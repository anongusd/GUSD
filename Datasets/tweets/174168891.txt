@TarynNBCS Are you allowed to walk it?
@TombstoneStint Yes ... and it's a Catch-22 in the sense that if anything hard-hitting does come from it you have to at least wonder about the fairness and ethics in how info was attained. There are all different kinds of ambushes and all kinds of opinions on what is fair and what is tainted.
@BackAftaThis @KirkHerbstreit @MikePereira I remember covering that and writing about the two teams' freshman running backs playing in their first game. For UH it was George Ornellas.
@SAWARRIOR666 Just watch Hoosiers with dubbing from the guy who does the pidgin voice overs. Nah, there was a movie in the making quite a while ago ... not sure what happened to that.
I can't wait to read this book about Chaminade-Virginia, by local writer Jack Danilewicz. "The Greatest Upset Never Seen" is due out this fall. https://t.co/7yAz4CQSza
@Hawaiimbb trails Northridge 39-34 at halftime on Senior Night. 'Bows are still in the game because Purchase has 20 points, and UH scored the last 5 points before intermission.

@SamSpanglerHI @HawaiiBaseball @HawaiiFootball If the football team manager Marissa played she would've knocked out a few of you guys.
"If something is a cliche it's because it's true" is a cliche, right? But I'm not quite sure if that is true.
@SamSpanglerHI I was thinking maybe Bess, but he could throw, and he DEFINITELY could catch.
@kawikasmith2 @SamSpanglerHI @HawaiiBaseball @HawaiiFootball Hide the wrenches from that dude!
RT @SamSpanglerHI: Our UH strength staff used to put us @HawaiiBaseball against @HawaiiFootball in dodgeball. It was like 100 vs 30 and we…
@SamSpanglerHI @HawaiiBaseball @HawaiiFootball I guess the strategy was get the QBs first?
@SamSpanglerHI @HawaiiBaseball @HawaiiFootball Sounds like a scene from "Everybody Wants Some." If they still do that, I want to cover it -- but from behind a net!
Jack Purchase has 21 points and Brocke Stepteau has 17 as UH has opened up a 77-48 lead with 7:58 left in the game. #hawaiimbb
Now, back-to-back dunks by Avea and Carper, and UH leads 70-43 with 11:31 left.. This is becoming one of those reach for the record book games. #hawaiimbb
Hawaii has made 61 percent of its 3-pointers and 65 percent of its 2-point attempts. 83 percent from line. #hawaiimbb
Purchase made another bomb early in the 2nd half (Hawaii's 10th of the game), and UH leads 59-34 with 16:40 left to play. #hawaiimbb
3s Company: Jack Purchase, Eddie Stansberry and Jack Purchase made three 3-pointers apiece in the first half, and #hawaiimbb leads visiting UC Riverside 50-29. UH shot 9-for-13 from beyond the arc; when Stepteau (15 points) wasn't hitting bombs he was worming his way to the hoop.
Jack Purchase just made the 181st 3-pointer of his career, and is now the #hawaiimbb all-time leader in treys. Brock Stepteau also has 2 in this game, and Bows lead 9-4 against Riverside.
Jack Purchase just tied the program's career record for 3-point baskets made with 180. He's tied with Zane Johnson. UH leads 63-46 with 3:49 left. #hawaiimbb
The freshman Carper now has a career-high 15 points and Buggs has 13 and 6 assists. Hawaii leads 46-37 with 9:57 left. #hawaiimbb
Drew Buggs has scored 7 of UH's 10 points as it has expanded its lead to 36-21 over Cal Poly with 15:39 left. #hawaiimbb
Hawaii has taken advantage of poor Cal Poly shooting and freshman Dawson Carper’s dominance around the basket to lead 26-19 at halftime. The 7-foot freshman has nine points. The Mustangs are shooting 27 percent from the floor. #hawaiimbb
@bkravitz The one about Mossad was quite interesting.
@TheOtherSjarifG Maybe "we" includes a wife who makes a lot of money.
@TarynNBCS @aberger2go You sure were tall when you lived here!
@TarynNBCS If they're gonna go for 5-11, why stop there? Might as well say 6-even already.
@JeanGreasy @janemarielynch I'll settle for my Jetson's individual rocket transporter. That Star Trek disappearing and reappearing somewhere else is too scary.
@TheOtherSjarifG @RJinVegas Unless it's changed recently, Rovell's specialty is sports business, of which sports gambling is a sub category, I think.
@DaraInHawaii Do we know for sure that wasn't another shirt underneath the one he tossed into the crowd?
@talkingEd The general  mentality of players of Brady's generation is a lot different than that of guys like Borland and Urschel (although it should be noted the latter said he retired early to go back to college, not because of the CTE report). (2of2)
@talkingEd Yes, I've done a little bit of work on concussions and football, lol. But despite the research very few pro football players say they would've done things differently. We've seen a few early retirements in recent years, so there is some traction toward sanity. But ... (1of2)
He would never say this, but I bet he thinks about it: Why would Tom Brady retire when he has now tied Michael Jordan's 6 championships, and has a legit chance to pass him? Pretty sure Bill Russell (11) has nothing to worry about, though. #goatnote
@jsyadao Good point ... even though it would take about 5 hours!
@mdallstate Well, it is definitely much more offensive than anything happening in the game.
Maroon 5, Patriots 3
At least two of the fouls against Hawaii very questionable, but UCSB does have an overall quickness advantage. #hawaiimbb
UC Santa Barbara leads Hawaii 30-26 at halftime. 12 fouls against Rainbows and Gauchos have made 11 of 15 shots from line. Avea leads UH with 9 points. #hawaiimbb
Long Beach State went nearly 3 1/2 minutes without scoring. But Richard hits  a buzzer-bomb to end the half, and UH's lead is 36-28 at intermission. #hawaiimbb
Rainbows lead now 32-22 with 3:12 left in half. Stansberry has 8 points. #hawaiimbb
Hawaii missed its first 7 3-point tries, then made 3 in a row (Avea 2, Stansberry 1) and Stepteau scored 5 points in a row. UH trailed 10-2 but now leads 20-17 against Long Beach State. #hawaiimbb
Here are some thoughts about the University of Hawaii men's basketball team that has won six of its last eight games. #hawaiimbb https://t.co/zy7If35GWo
@sweetlou025 I do remember that one now.
This is an honest question because my brain already hurts from looking up other things: Can anyone remember an NFL team winning the toss and choosing to play defense first in overtime?
@SAWARRIOR666 Or, have the owners in a gladiator-style fight to the death. Two go in, one walks out. Imagine the ratings!
@jbboote Exactly my point on the kickoff. But kickoffs mean more commercials!
I didn't like NFL's OT rules before. And now that the pro game is more about offense than ever, the major flaw of not guaranteeing each team a possession is amplified. Those who say college OT no good bc kickoffs not used either ignoring or discounting another shift in the game.
This is great stuff!!! Bravo to the 2nd grade teacher who I'm pretty sure is the person who facilitated this. https://t.co/mkkwUb4hmU

@danhinxman I guess the word would be "humbled."
@TombstoneStint Ryan's also the guy who lied about his marathon time.
@danhinxman Hmm, I didn't take it that way. Maybe because he showed a softer side than we're used to after last year's win, too.

@dmccrackenhnn @DanTomMMA lol, not arguing, just stating fact. You live here and know the culture and I assume you know the islands' history, too, so you know why the distinction between Hawaii and Hawaiian is important. If you mean too late in the evening, I agree. Good night and happy new year!
@DanTomMMA All good. ... But I (and I'm not alone) believe too many folks don't understand the very real distinction between things (and people) Hawaii and Hawaiian; so we point 'em out. With that being said, it wasn't a bad analogy. I wish you all the best, including a Happy New Year.
@DanTomMMA I disagree. Japanese plus American doesn't equal Hawaiian. Is it a Hawaii thing? Sure. But not Hawaiian. That's like L&amp;L claiming to be Hawaiian BBQ, which it absolutely is not.
@Warbow11 @RKekaula @SamSpanglerHI Are you ever?

@spikedlee7 One rare exception might be the 2006  #hawaiifb team. Bess was the most gifted receiver, but there were 7 other guys who were not that far behind, and all knew the offense inside and out.
@Linkmeister They've both been playing.
@SAWARRIOR666 sushi break or shishi break?
@spikedlee7 Very valid point. You take the top receiver off any team — even one that doesn't pass as much as #hawaiifb — and you hurt your offense significantly.
@cowrabbit88 McDonald is in now.

@sparklesexpress It's too long between regular season and bowls (and playoffs) for several reasons. But the infrastructure is set up for it and I think TV likes it this way.
When did Kirby Smart go to LaTech?
@sparklesexpress Yeah, it was a rhetorical question. No one should be surprised.
Any1 surprised bowl games get chippy? It's kind of like boxing/MMA when football teams have month between end of season and bowl, and some hear or read for weeks how the guy across the line is so much better.  Then a pregame banquet where supposed to be nice-nice.
The last time I remember #hawaiifb getting an unsportsmanlike penalty against LaTech was for doing the haka in 2007 at Ruston. Now UH punts on fourth-and-forever following two 15-yarders on first down. UH still leads 7-3 as first half ends.
@Andychang80 I don't have enough information to know.
A third turnover by LaTech, and #hawaiifb has ball on LaTech 40.
@SAWARRIOR666 Again?
@SpncerHonda Yup, saw that, thanks.
DE Kendall Hune, who just recovered a fumble, now tips a pass to himself for an interception. #hawaiifb defense stepping up. Hune and mates probably got tired of hearing all month how great LaTech's defense was.
McDonald, Cordeiro, McDonald and now Cordeiro again, and it is Cordeiro with the TD pass to Sharsch. #hawaiifb leads 7-0.
@ryanwsiu Thanks Ryan, Hawaii still scoreless, but moving the ball now.
That roar you just heard all the way from Halawa was a forced fumble by Ro Ferris, recovered by Kendall Hune. #hawaiifb has possession at its own 29, game still scoreless.
Hawaii and LaTech are scoreless after the first quarter of the Hawaii Bowl. #hawaiifb top playmaker, slot receiver John Ursua, did not start with what has been reported as an "apparent hamstring injury."
I'll update this later after the football game ... we're at the 9:45 mark of the first quarter and no score yet. https://t.co/BBO17LZlJ2
UNLV has taken a 50-38 lead with 8:15 left, after Hawaii had led early in the second half.
I stand (actually, I'm sitting now) corrected: It was East Carolina that Skip Holtz was coaching when his team beat Boise State in the 2007 Hawaii Bowl. UCF was stuck in my head bc of its exciting 2005 win over Nevada.
@Dee31804859 @hawaiiwworld Yes, bus would've been a great idea!
@BSUsportsreport Yes ... I saw that error and deleted the tweet ... I'll revisit later. Thanks!
In 2001, Nick Rolovich's virtuoso performance at QB for #hawaiifb helped spur creation of the Hawaii Bowl. In 2007, Skip Holtz coached UCF when it beat Boise State in this game. Today, they lead old WAC foes UH and LaTech in the Hawaii Bowl.

@ainoa777 Who knew the Pro Bowl was actually the testing ground for the "new NFL"? lol
@HiloHIChadO It's interesting though how often in these shootout games a big defensive play makes the difference. In that Pro Bowl it was a sack of Peyton Manning by Kris Jenkins. Last night Mahomes threw a pick 6 among 3 ints. He had two more TD passes than Goff, but Goff threw no ints.
I saw NFL players in a game that ended with a 55-52 score in 2004, with Andy Reid coaching one of the teams. A Rams QB threw 4 TD passes in the 2nd half for the winning team. It was fun and exciting, but the Pro Bowl isn't really an NFL game.
@SamSpanglerHI I agree they look really good regardless of era. They are classic. Similar design to the old baseball uniforms.
@luki_thompson66 With him you never know. It could be a "typo." But I seriously doubt it.
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich Don't play poker with free safeties who always seem to magically be in the right place to make the play.
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich Yes, as a poker player calls them "tells." ... I think @NickRolovich used fake tells in '01.
@SamSpanglerHI Good memories? Nostalgia is an interesting concept. The past often seems better for whatever reason, even if it really wasn't.
@Brian_McInnis In honor of Riley's presence I'm guessing. What about the fluorescent lime green ones?
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich Also, coaches who played in it say historically has been modified to varying degrees based on skill set of whoever the QB is at the time. Banker, DC at Oregon State in '06, said part of reason they slowed UH offense and won was studying tendencies.
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich Yes, R and S supposed to be at least somewhat equal opportunity offense for receivers, depending on coverages and reads. But many QBs, especially young ones, and being human beings, tend to lock on to favorites regardless. (1 of 2)
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich One word: Tendencies. Plus what you said about running ... that's a pretty big thing.
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich But back to the point of the original post of this thread: Even if it's already been decided, there's no reason to announce it and good reason to keep the opponents guessing. But maybe the SDSU DC isn't stupid too, and will prepare only for McDonald. lol.
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich no brained? lol. ok. I think it's no-brained to assume "the kid" will want to be in college 5 years. There is validity to both schools of thought, but my opinion is you play every game to win. I don't like cliches, but agree when coaches say most important game is the next 1. ...
@Warbow11 @NickRolovich So June Jones was stupid? His philosophy was burn redshirts if a freshman could help win a game. He knew that four years down the line is more unpredictable than next Saturday. Football in many ways is a win-now game. My guess is the coaches will ask Chevan what he wants to do.
Now San Diego State has to prepare for two QBs. And the added beauty of it is there isn't a whole lot of college game tape on one. I'd be surprised if #hawaiifb coach @NickRolovich shows his cards before game-time on this one.
Eight of 12 adding their opinion to my post at https://t.co/0YRS2oqZA5 say Chevan Cordeiro should start at QB next Saturday against San Diego State. Saving the redshirt season assumes he will be around for 5 years. 2022 is a long time from now. https://t.co/XtZBcAW0Pd
@MattWithTwoTees Yup. When I said I don't think there is one it's clear to me you should start the QB who gives you the best chance to win the game, and at this point it's Cordeiro. So, in my mind, no debate.
@PakalaniBello Paul, who lived in Vegas, said there were likely lots of guys digging in garbage cans trying to find pieces of paper they tore up an hour earlier.
@DaraInHawaii Very young team overall.
@JeremyKawika It takes a special kind of team to succeed with two QBs sharing time if that's what you're suggesting. Maybe the Warriors are that kind of team. #hawaiifb
OK, here's my first take on #hawaiifb 's stirring comeback win against UNLV tonight, and whether Chevan Cordeiro has done enough now to unseat Cole McDonald as the Warriors starting QB. https://t.co/XtZBcAW0Pd
@MattWithTwoTees I don't think there is one.
This was an incredible second-half comeback by the #hawaiifb defense, and an offense sparked by true freshman Chevan Cordeiro coming off the bench to throw 3 TD passes. I'll have a post on UH's Hawaii-bowl-clinching win at https://t.co/4U2ASXhHT4 soon.
The #hawaiifb defense stops UNLV on fourth down at the Rebels own 7 and UH runs out the clockt. Hawaii wins 35-28 and has clinched a Hawaii Bowl berth.
Cordeiro to a wide-open Ursua down the sideline for 68-yards and the go-ahead TD. #hawaiifb leads 35-28 with 1:25 left.
Cordeiro-to-Ward TD passes are the eye-catchers, but the #hawaiifb defense inspired second-half play made it possible, and now UH has chance for great comeback win. Hawaii ball first-and-10 on own 20 with 2:39 left.
It's now 28-28 with 4:23 left. #hawaiifb
Incredible pass by Cordeiro and catch by Ward at back of end zone for another touchdown. Extra point would tie it. #hawaiifb
Coredeiro scrambles 17 for first down at 25. #hawaiifb
Things are going so well for #hawaiifb now they're even running the ball well. Holly goes 12 for a first down.
HUGE stop on fourth down and 1 by #hawaiifb defense. UH ball at its own 46. 8:27 left to play. UNLV leads 28-21.
Cordeiro to Ursua for a 2-point conversion and UNLV's lead is 28-21. #hawaiifb
And on his first play, Cordeiro throws 64 yards for a touchdown to Ward. #hawaiifb
Cordeiro is in at QB. #hawaiifb
Regardless of the very real possibility of receivers misreading coverages, McDonald really needs to stop throwing to where there are more white shirts than black shirts if #hawaiifb is to have a chance to pull this one out.
By the way, the actual score is UNLV 28, Hawaii 13. #hawaiifb
The Rebels cash in on the turnover, and those who wagered on them to cover are 14:21 of game time from cashing in, with 21 or so points of cushion. #hawaiifb
Definitely a different #hawaifb team in the second half so far. UNLV's lead cut to 21-13.
4th and 5 at midfield, converted for first down on 15-yard pass to Ursua. Offense needs to cash in after two 3-and-outs by defense. #hawaiifb
Hard to call that long one to Ward a drop, because it would've been a great catch ... and a momentum-changer for #hawaiifb
UNLV leads 21-6 at half time. Cole McDonald was 7 for 17 with an interception in the first half. Many passes errant. John Ursua caught 3 passes for 66 yards. On another pass across the middle, he did not extend his arms for a possible catch. #hawaiifb run defense nonexistent.
@HiloHIChadO Our editor asked the same thing. Maybe he forgot you're allowed to.
@HiloHIChadO Enjoy!
UNLV takes a 7-3 lead with a 17-play, 75-yard drive ending with a 9-yard TD pass as first quarter nears end.
@keopu Some of the toughest, strongest people I know battle depression.
This is true. People get good at hiding the illness of depression because we get tired of being told to just shake it off ... also if you are depressed, you really don't want to be depressing to other people. You learn to make jokes, or you hide (in lots of different ways). https://t.co/0uWDyP5wzH

@TigerBillHawaii "The" problem? I think I just read somewhere that chalking it up to one thing is "cheap and superficial." I understand if you're a fan and want to vent frustration. But your beef isn't with me. Go ahead and be critical, but please not hypocritical.
@TigerBillHawaii I didn't claim effort was or is, the only problem. Maybe you missed the other tweet during the game where I mentioned a few other things when someone asked what happened to this team that started the season winning. It's addressed here, too: https://t.co/4a798IrYhS
Vince Manuwai, one of the best offensive linemen to ever play #hawaiifb and a key to the Warriors success in the early '00s, has died at 38. https://t.co/cWWa5jjsEs
Post mortem of #hawaiifb lopsided loss to Utah State with quotes from UH coach Nick Rolovich added. https://t.co/4a798IrYhS
Here's my first quick read on the #hawaiifb train wreck against Utah State tonight. Aggies routed Rainbow Warriors 56-17. https://t.co/4a798IrYhS
The 2-point conversion after the McDonald-Ursua TD pass makes it a three-score game, but the way #hawaiifb defense is playing it's very hard to see that mattering, even with this much time left. Utah State leads 35-11 with 9:17 left in 3rd Q.
@Joshontheradio At least on that one they got close enough to miss tackles, unlike the first quarter TD when everyone just gave up.
@Joshontheradio I counted seven. But I'm a tough grader.
#hawaiifb defense had seven chances to tackle Thompson on that 26-yard TD. Great run or horrible defense, or both, depending on your perspective. Utah State now leads 35-3 with 11:31 left in third quarter.
Halftime, Utah State leads #hawaiifb 28-3. Both starting quarterbacks have taken some heavy hits.
@cowrabbit88 For one thing schedule was backloaded. Also, team is very young and did not bounce back from early losses very well. McDonald does not look fully recovered from injury. Best defender, Tavai, is out. Depth is a big issue on defense, youth on offense.
I wish we had that ESPN "due to time constraints we skip ahead" thing in real life right now. #hawaiifb
#hawaiifb defense was disgraceful on that last touchdown by Utah State. Absolutely zero effort.
It's now 14-0, Utah State, and we're barely 5 minutes into the game. #HawaiiFB
Interception off Ursua's hands into those of Woodward ends #hawaiifb drive.
Targeting of McDonald called against Utah State and #hawaiifb has first down at own 40. Fortenberry ejected from game.
Jordan to Tarver for 16 yards and a Utah State touchdown. It's 7-0 with 11:54 left in first. #HawaiiFB
The drive stalled, and now Utah State has quickly driven to the #hawaiifb 16.
Two plays in and #hawaiifb looks like the offense that started the season with passes for 51 and 9 yards. But now a false start and its second and 6 at Utah State 29.
I think Tua may have just turned in his Heisman moment.
@keopu I know what I'm eating on Nov. 1!!!!
It's great that Mookie Betts fed those homeless folks in Boston the other night. But the story was super overblown, right? Maybe bc common decency is so remarkable these days.  But especially when you consider he fed the entire nation free tacos with his stolen base in game one!

@SAWARRIOR666 Saw that after my comment about their run defense. In coverage, Green was fundamentally superb to go with the speed. Sanders' ridiculous athleticism allowed him to bait passes his way, resulting in picks or break ups.
@SAWARRIOR666 Sanders was supremely gifted with speed and athleticism but notoriously NOT physical. One of worst run defenders I've seen on a football field. Green was small, but would at least try to make a play against run, and often did, and yes, world-class speed.
@SAWARRIOR666 The league did disallow downfield chucking during their careers, but that wasn't a big part of either's game.
@SAWARRIOR666 Sanders and Green "physical?"??
@SAWARRIOR666 Quite a few million remain in denial on one or the other.

Blog post updated with postgame quotes from Nick Rolovich, Zeno Choi, Kaimana Padello and JoJo Ward after #hawaiifb 17-13 win over Wyoming tonight. https://t.co/0PcCI98sH7
Backup quarterback Chevan Cordeiro and #hawaiifb found a way to win tonight against Wyoming, 17-13. Here's my first quick take on it, to be updated with quotes from Coach Nick Rolovich. https://t.co/0PcCI98sH7
Longest play from scrimmage tonight goes for 61 yards -- the other way. DE Carl Granderson intercepts Cordeiro's pass in the flat and puts Wyoming up 10-3. #hawaiifb
@tridhuynh Knee. And it was on a knee-d to know basis.
Wyoming is now 0 for 6 on third downs with another sack by Padello. #hawaiifb
@warriorboutit Also, no knock on Cordeiro, but first game with a new (freshman) QB can affect rhythm of OL.
The first half ends with the score tied at 3. #hawaiifb
In most #hawaiifb games with the run-and-shoot, a 33-yard-punt to the 5 wouldn't matter much. But tonight could be different.
Second down and one ... the top pair with nut flush redraw of field position.
Padello with the sack and strip. #hawaiifb defense stepping up in absence of injured starting QB Cole McDonald. It's 3-3 with 5:24 left in first half. UH ball at midfield.
If you are going to base the quality of a defense linked to a run-and-shoot offense solely on where it ranks in total yards allowed, you lack a basic understanding of modern day college football ... especially when that team has played one more game than most of the others. ...
@jeffpearlman @nytimes lol, you are a lot of things, but I don't think "kiss up" is one of them.
@Tris10aldeguer Thanks Tristan.
Mike McIntyre — a key guy in #hawaiimbb back-to-back NCAA tourney appearances — was one of the most overshadowed athletes I've covered at UH. He will be remembered for clutch 3-pointers, strong defense, and smart point guard play. https://t.co/1pMYiuJKVN
So true! https://t.co/0kVgm1NhtK
@DanWolken If this young #hawaiifb team keeps improving you may have a legit reason soon.
@DanWolken If you're every out here I'll take you to a place that actually does do some interesting and very tasty things with authentic Hawaii and Hawaiian flavors and pizza.
@DanWolken One last thing ... Hawaiians pretty much hate what is called Hawaiian pizza, too.
@DanWolken Also, I thought NY would be "pie-shaped lasagna minus pasta that calls itself pizza," and IL would be "sun-lamp-dried cardboard that calls itself pizza."
@DanWolken Dan, I didn't know we hate Coke ... but it seems we absolutely LOVE Diet Coke.

@SAWARRIOR666 I have some really bad bar fight stories, and two really good ones. Average punches thrown in the two good ones: 0.5.
This is a true story: I almost had to fight a guy for staring at him in a bar after a White Sox game in 1980 because I thought he was backup first baseman Mike Squires. https://t.co/x5w7qC3Mkf
@tal_avi As a former bartender and ... well ... let's leave it at that ... I can tell you that 46.3 percent of all bar fights start for that reason.
All I can say is it's probably not good "judgment" to pick a fight in a bar with someone named Dom Cozzolino.
When a football team wins in overtime, yes, there's some luck. But #hawaiifb history indicates the good Rainbow Warrior teams reign in OT and the bad ones don't. Blog post at https://t.co/4U2ASXhHT4 https://t.co/foK3afIrtI
@coachwags77 When I see those catches I think of one of my favorite cornerbacks: Lester Hayes.
@FrankMunden1 Seems there are folks who want this to disappear asap w/o FBI bc longer it stays in the news the more it would affect midterm elections ... but I think it's a moot point, because that ship has already sailed ... and sunk, bc #metoo isn't going away.
@FrankMunden1 Agreed. And enough of this "The FBI doesn't come to conclusions" BS. While that is technically true, it is semantics, and the FBI is pretty good at uncovering facts (the real kind, not the alternative kind).

Was just starting to wonder, where's John Ursua, who had zero targets so far ... and then he's breaking away from his man to catch a perfectly thrown ball in the end zone for a 25-yard TD. Duquesne 14, #hawaiifb 7
Technically not a turnover, but a lost possession due to misplay of kickoff leads to another Duquesne score. #hawaiifb is down 14-0 with 7:32 left in first quarter.
Parr to Crawford for a 6-yard touchdown, and Duquesne leads Hawaii 7-0  midway through the first quarter. #hawaiifb
#hawaiifb has doubled its season total of two turnovers coming into this game in its first two series with that lost fumble.
McDonald intercepted for the first time this season, and in his college career. Duquesne takes over at its own 20. #hawaiifb

@DanWolken "Mindhunter" is good crime drama; genesis of serial killer profiling from view of FBI agents who pioneered it sounds like it could be dry but it's good. Captures vibe of '70s/'80s pretty well; my 1 quibble is "Hold The Line" on car radio a year before its release.
@forsurftoo I saw about a minute of it and lost interest. Not sure why.
@DanWolken "I Am A Killer" is a great documentary series that even-handedly explores the death penalty from the various perspectives. Even if your opinion either way is rock-solid it will be challenged.
@DanWolken Did you make it to Tom Hardy's first entrance in "Peaky Blinders"? His scene-steals alone are worth the time investment even if you think the rest is meh.
@TheOtherSjarifG That's correct. Great movie. I didn't bother with the Sarandon/Gere/Lopez remake because I didn't think they could do it any better.

The last time #hawaiifb played at Army (2010) the Warriors from UH edged the warriors from West Point 31-28 by building a lead early, slumping in the middle and finishing strong. Sounds familiar. Also, that was the last Hawaii team to finish with a winning record.
@Warbow11 No, apparently you don't realize that was an option. And Rice was doing a pretty good job of disguising its defense.
The oft-repeated "I'm not booing the team I'm booing the playcalling" line is ridiculous. If you understand anything about team concepts you know that what affects one affects all. And this is supposed to help a 3-0 team continue to win how? Next time bet the moneyline.
@oshinkoroll The oft-repeated "not booing the team booing the playcalling" line is ridiculous. If you understand anything about team concepts you know that what affects one affects all. And this is supposed to help the team how?

Byrd looks more like Bess all the time. After that TD pass from McDonald and 2-point conversion run by McDonald, #hawaiifb lead is 36-22 with 3:01 left. This time the defense stepped up big in the second half. They were on the field a lot, but made big turnover, big stops.
That's why the true believers say field position doesn't matter when you've got the run-and-shoot as your offense. #hawaiifb
They sure do tackle a lot better than last year. #hawaiifb
Took me a second for me to get that, but yes, you are so right. And don't forget, these are some of  the fans that booed during a win over Alabama. https://t.co/8PyuFOGu3x
Home fans are booing 2-0 #hawaiifb that is ahead 28-22. As we know, a lot of the fans don't like running plays.
That's a big interference call against Rice on third and 5.  #hawaiifb first down at own 44.
Big 4th down play by Rice as Justin Trammel finds a wide-open space in the middle of the field and Stankavage finds him for a 31-yard TD. #hawaiifb lead is cut to 28-22 with 11:49 left.
@AdamDamnCuz 5-7 in 2005, 7-7 in 2008, 2-0 in 2018.
#hawaiifb defense did its job with a classic goal line stand. But Fred Holly is stopped in the end zone for a safety. Warriors lead is 28-15, and they'll kick to Rice.
Big play coming up to start 4th quarter. Ball is on Hawaii 1, 4th and goal for Rice with #hawaiifb leading 28-13.
Can't do that, though. 15-yard penalty against #hawaiifb defense after a completion and Rice regains the momentum.
Holly with a nifty run and #hawaiifb capitalizes on the turnover to go up 28-13. That's an example of how it doesn't matter how many yards a defense tied to an effective run-and-shoot allows if it comes up with some plays like that.
@GilKAOGG You're welcome.
@zeno_choi with the fumble recovery after the big hit by Eldridge give #hawaiifb the ball at the Rice 27. Warriors are up 21-13.
@GilKAOGG And I'm 100 percent sure it has absolutely no bearing on what's going to happen next.
@GilKAOGG Actually, I'm just providing pertinent stats. If you think that's jinxing someone, well, I don't know what to tell you.
@GilKAOGG Sorry, I'm the guy who walks into the press box and says, "Hey, so-and-so hasn't given up a hit yet."
"Cole McDonald has an arm" is a Frank DeLima song waiting to happen. #hawaiifb
#hawaiifb quarterback Cole McDonald has still yet to throw an interception this year, or in his entire college career for that matter. After his 14-for-20 first half against Rice, he is 70-of-98 this season with no picks.
@daylekturner All 3 years major transitions for #hawaiifb ... 2005: Chang gang graduated and Brennan, Bess, RGM, S. Elimimian were all new; 2008: Jones, Brennan, receivers gone; 2018: McDonald and JC receivers and run-and-shoot all new.
#hawaiifb had outscored its three opponents 38-7 in the first quarter ... until that 51-yard touchdown run by Rice's Esupka. Warriors now lead the Owls 14-7.
#hawaiifb is 14-14 (so far) in the three years Hawaii teams have won the Little League World Series.
McDonald and Ursua made that one look easy. 6-yard TD pass and #hawaiifb has now scored on first possession of all 3 games this season after failing to do so in all 12 last year.
#hawaiifb didn't use run-pass option last week against Navy, but Holly gets good gain on it early against Ric.
#hawaiifb defense stops Rice's first possession and takes over at own 35. McDonald immediately hits Ursua for 34 yards.
Also, I will provide analysis minutes after the game's conclusion, which will be updated with quotes and more detail from the #hawaiifb press conference.

@TheOtherSjarifG From the financial sense, I think it is a very wise long-term investment. They make most of their money on attire, and, of course, shoes. I think shoes are kind of part attire and part gear. Gear, especially football gear, are pretty far back among their revenue generators.

@TheOtherSjarifG ... and, yes, the line between objective and opinion has become increasingly blurred ... and things that more of us used to agree were simply wrong are not viewed that way by people who are frustrated and feel oppressed by a system they view as unfair to them. ...

@TheOtherSjarifG Yes, there are always judgment calls and contextual issues (should we identify mass shooters by name, for example; also there seems to be some rethinking on naming of suicides). I think one of the main points I'm trying to make is that these people now have media platforms ...
@TheOtherSjarifG ... but, the result is an even higher level of distrust of everything and anything reported by mainstream media, and that in turn leads to more people believing in conspiracy theories. And many of these folks are not, or were not, extremists.
@TheOtherSjarifG Unfortunately many people hear and see what they want to hear and see, and what many hear and see -- and not just extreme right -- is a mainstream media that does not consider their perspective, at least not fairly. Yes, that has been inflamed and exaggerated by the president ...
@TheOtherSjarifG ... are other obvious, major factors, including platforms like the one we're on right now and how people use them.) Also, it's much easier than in the past for people to pick and choose where they get their "news" from. ...
@TheOtherSjarifG ... simple news story, the fact alone that some journalists say they won't give voice to views they believe all should agree should not be validated has contributed to the current polarization and high level of distrust of *anything* mainstream media reports. (Of course there ...
@TheOtherSjarifG Then the question becomes if objective journalism is to be judgmental, and to what degree. In the old days that's what the editorial page and the columns were for. While I agree it is impossible as human being to be 100 percent objective in any endeavor, even a relatively ...
@TombstoneStint Your bio indicates you write about boxing? If so, you'll definitely want to read some of Jim's coverage of the fight game in Hawaii. He covered some of the greats from here including Ganigan, Villaflor and Salud.
@HiloHIChadO Thanks Chad. Jim lived a very interesting life here in Hawaii with many friends, and enjoyed the serenity of retirement the past 30 years in Kentucky with the love of his life, his wife Darlene. (They met at the Star-Bulletin.)
@TombstoneStint If you can't access https://t.co/8gnoVliYRw for some reason and you don't mind going to the state library, you can find it in the December 24, 1982 Star-Bulletin. (Unfortunately the Honolulu papers lost their library in all the reshuffling of the past 20 years.)
@TombstoneStint If you can access the following link, it will take you to Jim's game story from Chaminade's victory over Virginia — still considered by many the greatest upset in college basketball history. https://t.co/uNp9bLG1iL
Jim was a great friend and mentor, and he advocated tirelessly for what was right: especially competitive balance in high school football via classification. https://t.co/HHPPZXw6xU
If you read the Honolulu Star-Bulletin sports section in the '70s and '80s, you remember the prose of colorful Jim Easterwood. And you may recall how hard he pushed for 3 tiers of high school football, which we finally now have. Jim passed away Sunday. https://t.co/g14pclE5Lp
@BLUNZ2002 Do you get that sacrifice of people like Rodgers is partly to defend right of Kaepernick and others to protest and question authority of government and other power structures? Citing that is not "scapegoating" ... it ties in. Have a good day, I gotta go.
@warriorboutit Granted, CK is more of a commodity than the other two. But I actually think all would've stuck longer on NFL rosters if they weren't such distractions. I think TT and MS probably better than many teams' 50-53rd players,or at least good enough for practice squad.
@BLUNZ2002 No, I think I get that. I've written on it several times past two years, in support of his protest. What I don't understand he is "silently protesting something that's defended by the constitution?" Maybe it's the wording of your phrase I don't understand. Help me with that.
@BLUNZ2002 Sadly, that problem has been ongoing for as long as I can remember. And though I can't remember what I had for lunch, I do remember people getting harassed and much worse for no reason at traffic stops 50 years ago. But I disagree that there is only one "real issue."
@warriorboutit Yes, isn't it interesting how TT, CK have much in common? But folks aligning selves on "sides" don't want to see that because doesn't match their preconceived notions. I'd throw Michael Sam in there, too. (Actually, I did in a piece two years ago.)
@BLUNZ2002 When a highly-paid athlete (he still took home $39 million) talks about "sacrificing everything" in the name of freedom via an ad campaign of a huge corporation, it's fair to compare it to bigger sacrifices made for the same freedoms by others compensated much less.
@Blaxican3120 ... see it only from their "side" rather than bigger picture. Sacrifice=freedom, right? That's common goal of military and protesters; freedom. That's America. I recommend reading some of what Nate Boyer has had to say about this; he sees it clearly from all sides.
@Blaxican3120 That's A point. One of the points I'm making is that the sacrifice of people like Josh Rodgers guarantees the rights of others freedoms like those of expression and speech which the players exercise when kneeling during the anthem. This is a multifaceted issue, but many want ...
@BLUNZ2002 Do you get it now?
@BLUNZ2002 The military vows to defend the constitutional rights of all Americans, including the right to express one's self however he or she wants during the anthem. First amendment. That's how it ties in (2 of 2).
@BLUNZ2002 No, I do get THAT point. In fact, I acknowledged THAT point two years ago when this first started. There is a larger point about true sacrifice. This issue is about freedoms and civl liberties, right? ... (1 of 2)
@warriorboutit Yes ... it takes two to polarize, right? By the way, going from sitting to kneeling was a good move, but the significance of that was lost on most. I wish more people on both sides of this debate would listen to Nate Boyer.
@warriorboutit If he really wanted to continue to play pro football he could've gone to Canada. And with his skill set he probably would've done extremely well. As things stand now, one of the things he is missing out on is exposure to CTE.
@Blaxican3120 I wrote about -- and applauded -- "the real message" years ago when he first sat and before his martyrdom became a marketing opportunity. But that doesn't mean I have to figuratively or literally buy what he and his corporate benefactor are trying to sell.
@jjniles I never had the honor of meeting Josh.
@mcj3516 So you think sacrificing your life and sacrificing your career but still making millions of dollars deserve equal admiration? OK.
Bingo. I used Josh as an example because he was extremely close friends with my nephews and I've met his family. https://t.co/c6NWYPVBp6
I guess we were steadily headed in this direction, but I still find it bizarre that there is a place where marketing, martyrdom and millions intersect.
@mcj3516 If you're saying these two things correlate somehow, that's quite a reach in my opinion. Receiving death threats from cowards who rarely follow through and actual death in combat in the service of  your country are two very different things.
@TheOtherSjarifG I remember we talked about this a long time ago. My take was that reporting various sides is not always about validating, but sometimes exposing.
No word yet if the shoes come with a kneepad or that costs extra. https://t.co/rLVmuxeBHk
@TheOtherSjarifG Cartwheels, yay! Backflips, nay!
@TheOtherSjarifG Many veterans don't like the kneeling but get that it is part of the freedoms they vowed to defend. Kind of like as journalists we might not like a side of a story but in objective reporting we are obligated to present it (although I have seen some debate about this recently).
@TheOtherSjarifG I think this is a very interesting multi-dimensional topic.
If you don't remember Josh Rodgers, search his name with "Rangers" and then think about who actually sacrificed "everything." I'm not saying the guy in the ad didn't sacrifice, but "everything?" https://t.co/WjtZh2qjgd
@mcj3516 By the way, isn't this a bit childish? If I wanted to play your game, I'd say, "But I asked first!" I gave you my thoughts. Enjoy your day.
THIS: https://t.co/5VOfVKwHg4
@warriorboutit The report, from last year: https://t.co/YeBju0vROs
@warriorboutit I guess you mean up to this point after he opted out of his Niners contract? According to what looks like a credible report here, he did receive $39 million as an NFL player.
@kmart2400 I just reread your post and realize you might not be coming at me. My apologies if that's the case.
@mcj3516 I guess you require "yes or no" answers? Sorry, I don't have those for you, at least at this point. Part of why I posed my question is to learn what people are thinking and what aspects they may be considering.
@kmart2400 If you are assuming that I lean in some direction on this because Kaepernick was a rival of the University of Hawaii while in college you are coming from a perspective of ignorance.
@warriorboutit And that is part of the larger point of discussion in my view: Is corporate advertising an appropriate platform for this issue? How does platform and method affect credibility of message? That has been major debate point from start of this years ago.
@mcj3516 ... at least to some, who will take every opportunity to question his and the company's motives. ... Especially since with the court developments of last week the NFL is on the defensive at this point and this campaign is announced just a few days later.
@mcj3516 ... worse, we live in a world where optics matter, and my guess is he and the company he's endorsing (or, actually in this case, is endorsing him) has anticipated cynicism and pushback and both are making donations directly linked to the ad campaign. If not, the words ring hollow
@mcj3516 I respect anyone who sacrifices for the better of a larger group that is oppressed or otherwise needs help. I think that if he is true to his word, he is contributing a large chunk of that endorsement contract to appropriate causes. I know he already gives, but for better or ...
@TheOtherSjarifG of Colin Kaepernick, there's a pretty good chance he will end up a very huge figure in American history. And so will Dennis Rodman when he completes his North Korea mission!!!! (semi joke)
@TheOtherSjarifG Someone else has been waiting quite a while for me to answer their  (non-rhetorical) question. I'm gonna go see if I can do that. By the way, I was telling some poker buddies the other night what I'm pretty sure I wrote a couple of years ago ... regardless of what anyone thinks
@TheOtherSjarifG They're a bit better leveraged now than they were a week ago, right?
@TheOtherSjarifG The campaign was announced today, right, or at least the story broke today. I think there's a good chance the timing - and maybe the fact that the campaign is being launched at al - had to do with the court developments last week. Do you?
@TheOtherSjarifG That is interesting in itself. I'm not saying big corporations are morally bankrupt, I'm just always pretty cynical about their motives. I'll just ask you this straight out ....
@TheOtherSjarifG I agree with that. By the way, you know I'm all for the players kneeling during the anthem. I'm also OK with them doing cartwheels across the field if they so choose.
@TheOtherSjarifG When you say "what it feels is right," you mean morally right, correct?
@TheOtherSjarifG lol! I'm glad one of finally decided to diffuse that. thanks for that.
@TheOtherSjarifG Actually, I thought I was doing the opposite, leaving wiggle room and trying to be open minded. I guess I failed at that.
@TheOtherSjarifG Maybe there's a difference between introducing and getting bogged down in? Anyway, I am curious what you think about the issue.
@TheOtherSjarifG And I'm sure you noticed that I have yet to mention the name of the company and that ties into what we're talking about. As I said to someone else, if they're smart, they've anticipated pushback and have made appropriate donations.
@TheOtherSjarifG What I said is that I'm asking a relevant question, or at least what I think is one. If you don't think it is, fine and let's move on and stop wasting each other's time. If you think I dismissed your attempt at extending the logic I'll just have to live with that.
@carynoki8 I'll address that in a second. I'm almost done playing words with friends.
@TheOtherSjarifG What do you think my intent is since you seem to know it better than I do? I said I am curious what people think and know. It certainly wasn't to drown in a pissing match of semantics.
@TheOtherSjarifG again, I said "a" relevant point. Not "the only" relevant point. Important distinction. What I was trying to say is that "of course I don't think he should give up literally everything" and perhaps to a degree I was countering sarcasm with sarcasm, but not dismissing your point.
@TheOtherSjarifG ... interested in what people think. And, if I do need to be clear since I never did answer the first question, no, I do not believe the ad should be taken to the literal extreme and he should have to give up everything to be true to his word.
@TheOtherSjarifG Either way, I think your response about "pedantic" and me "appointing myself" is classic ad hominem and you're better than that. Like I said, I asked what I think is "a" relevant question, not necessarily "the only" relevant question on a topical issue where I am genuinely ...
@TheOtherSjarifG It is an honest question, but I think you have the right to infer it as a loaded question. My obvious (I think) implication is that it is fair to question that if someone is presenting himself as an ultimate martyr how much personal wealth is being made from that.
@TheOtherSjarifG I have to admit I don't know how those contracts are structured, and that might make a difference.
@TheOtherSjarifG I said I'm curious and it's a real question, not rhetorical. I like to take a step back from issues and look at them from various angles and see what other people think and might know. I really don't see how that translates to me appointing myself to being in charge of anything.
@TheTurtleClub I don't think I said he shouldn't. What I said is I'm curious. And I'm not saying I'd be surprised if he and the company he's endorsing are making sizable donations to help relevant causes as part of this campaign. If they're smart, they did that.
@carynoki8 No, I'm asking a question. Not meant as rhetorical. I think it's a fair question.
@TheOtherSjarifG Because stopping there is making a relevant point.
I'm curious about Colin Kaepernick's willingness to "Believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything." Does "everything" include the endorsement contract connected to that ad campaign?
A friend just said this must be exciting for me to see #hawaiifb off to such a thrill-ride of a start. It is. Especially bc I admire, respect @NickRolovich . He "gets it." So sincere in his aloha, and insistence that team respect game, each other, fans and entire state.
@nickedtech Yes, you are correct. ... Easy to forget they won the first two last year.
@runwader My bad, I should've written first 2-0 start against FBS teams since 2007.
Updated blog post with quotes, more details and analysis from #HawaiiFB 59-41 win over Navy tonight. https://t.co/f2eOKiul39
blog post on Hawaii's 59-41 win against Navy at https://t.co/f2eOKiul39 (will be updated with quotes)
FINAL: Hawaii 59, Navy 41. Rainbow Warriors start at 2-0 for first time since 2009. #hawaiifb
The Meskell field goal to end the first half makes things more comfortable for #hawaiifb now, up by 17 with 8:43 left and the ball.
Looking at the replay, that was also a great catch by Ward, over the shoulder. #hawaiifb
Wow. McDonald with a precise deep bomb to Ward for a 75-yard TD. The long ball can't be thrown better than that. #hawaiifb lead is 52-35 with 11:04 left.
Perry to Walker for Navy's first completion of the season. It comes in the fourth quarter, and it's a 19-yard TD. #hawaiifb lead is trimmed to 45-35 with 12:06 left.
Byrd corrals a strike down the middle of the field from McDonald for 31-yard TD, and #hawaiifb lead is 45-28 with 14:07 to go.
Back-to-back sacks ... on the second, Navy QB Perry apparently thought the play was dead and just stood there as #hawaiifb defenders bear-hugged him. Navy punts.
Reverse toss to Abey, who could've walked into end zone. #HawaiiFB lead is cut to 38-28. 6:35 left in third.
But maybe you don't need a passing game if your defense helps you with a big turnover deep in #hawaiifb territory ... Navy's back in it with at TD here.
Score at Aloha Stadium is 38-21 midway through third. That's about what Vegas line expected -- except with the other team ahead. #HawaiiFB is up by 17. Navy just scored, but took 7 minutes. It's hard to come back from a three-score deficit in 1 1/2 quarters with no passing game.
In first half, one penalty for 5 yards for #hawaiifb, no penalties for Navy and no turnovers for either team. About five dropped passes for Warriors, though, and Midshipmen had a punt blocked for a UH touchdown. Zero pass attempts by Navy.
23 yard field goal by Ryan Meskell to end half, and #HawaiiFB goes into intermission up 38-14.
Navy fires right back with 75-yard TD run by Malcolm Perry. #HawaiiFB lead is 35-14 with 4 and change to the break.
Passing deep on 4th and 2? Don't rule out anything with @NickRolovich calling the plays. 52 yard TD pass from McDonald to Ursua. #HawaiiFB retakes momentum after Navy score and lead is 35-7 with 4:17 left in first half.
McDonald has completed 12 of 16 passes ... all four incomplete passes are drops. #HawaiiFB
#HawaiiFB leads Navy 28-7 with 6:52 left in first half. Cole McDonald has passed for 2 TDs, one each to Cedric Byrd and JoJo Ward.
#HawaiiFB has dominated the first 12 minutes and leads Navy 14-0. Middies came in a double-digit favorite.
Very sad news. Retired Star-Bulletin business editor and reporter Russ Lynch has died. He was the first professional journalist I ever met. He was a great old-school reporter who called in scoops from the Columbia Inn Round Table. And he was very kind to a kid copyboy.

@TheOtherSjarifG Yeah, if it were the other way around, moonwalk makes sense.
@TheOtherSjarifG Yes, it's a silly over reach. In your opinion would "soared" have been better, or too close to the cliche? You know I like plays off of cliches, so I would've probably used "soared."
@joyceclapp6 One of my favorite quotes. I repeat it often.

Ha!
My old rec-league friend Tony Tyler and I like to remind each other I'm the 2nd best point guard he ever played with. His high school teammate was Isiah Thomas. Actually our superb shooting guard, Stacy Sugimura, was way better then I, and took over point when things got serious.
Colt Brennan was at #hawaiifb practice today. He's had some serious health issues, but looks good in the photos today.
The running back formerly known as Freddie, Fred Holly III, never lost his enthusiasm of #hawaiifb when others did. https://t.co/3iZdiKgpyl
While moving house today I was reminded I currently have one tie. My guess is the over/under for cravats owned by dudes who live in Hawaii is three -- skewed by attorneys, military, and some private school goers. I've got a couple of sports-related tie stories I'll share later.
Got "Still The Same" and "Against The Wind" in the first 20 minutes of Pandora this morning. Reminded me that Seger is such a superb observer of the human condition. Who doesn't wish they didn't know now what they didn't know then?

The parade for Tua Tagovailoa today in Ewa Beach is big enough news that a TV reporter from Alabama is here to cover it.
@Bridge04Greg It's still astounding that not one of them thought him worthy of the award.

That sack was just to make it more dramatic. Wow!

@kalilwayne lol
My buddy, a big #HawaiiFB  fan, just came up with a good one: Jalen Hurts should transfer to Hawaii.
To those watching Tagovailoa for the first time: He's not running hard, like a running back, jus because it's the NC. That's the way he runs.
@SteveMurray84 @kalilwayne The critics said he should've gone somewhere else other than a school with a freshman who started in the NC.
If not for Tagovailoa, a lot more people on the east coast would be getting a full eight hours of sleep tonight.
Michael is 100 percent correct. It's ultimately none of anyone's business where he goes to school, except for his family. https://t.co/QlTX4rWqZ4
@kalilwayne Exactly! Plus, it's really none of our business anyway.
Regardless of what happens the rest of this game, maybe people will stop thinking Tagovailoa made a mistake going to Alabama.
They're talkin' Tua at halftime.

@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG I am supportive of Rolo bc I know he cares deeply about the program and state. We all knew he'd have to grow and learn on the job and be able to make tough calls, and I think he will. Identity of program will become clearer when roster is mostly his, which is upcoming season.
@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG They did give the next man a chance at QB, at Utah State. I would've like to have seen more of him against BYU though.
@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG I get it you're frustrated as a fan. But I have to say I can't stand that cliche, and opposite is usually true. Repetition is usually how people - especially young people - learn something. Prime example is run n shoot offense. UH got good at it by doing the same over and over.
@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG Have you been to a practice? They're well organized and there's a lot of teaching going on. Spring fling or whatever is just a show. And overnight success like JJ or UCF is extremely rare, regardless of persona.
@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG He's one of the best coaches I know at relating to millennials. Older people tend to see it differently, lack of discipline. And people also forget he's still dealing with nearly half a roster that he did not bring in. Most of them good people and team members, but not all.
@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG He has to tone it down, but I hope Rolo doesn't lose too much of his quirkiness and continues to remind people these are GAMES. Of course, if team doesn't win he's out regardless. When things are going well, people love his personality. When they're not, it's seen as weakness.
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 Granted, Mercer in November is a bad look. ... But that was on the heels of wins over ranked teams (LSU and Mississippi State).
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 I hear you, and although SEC folks overplay it sometimes, even on down years for the conference you already play tough teams. Also, Bama opened with Florida State ... who would've predicted Semis be as bad as they were this year?
@TheOtherSjarifG @Debu808 Was interesting that throughout '16, Rolo would publicly talk about being open to upgrade from Dru. I think that was him making sure Dru (a really neat young man, btw) didn't get complacent, and motivate him to work on better ball security.
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 Often in recent years they seemed not awake as a team entire first half (UH '15 an example), then turned it on late. Iowa debacle was more like they just gave up later in the game. pretty sure it cost them playoff spot. Good for committee, living up to "every game counts"
@Debu808 @TheOtherSjarifG I am pretty sure it is open, wide open.
@TheOtherSjarifG Not sure how it works. But they're free to transfer so I think that means they can be recruited.
I got the years wrong there ... It would be Ta'amu in 2018 and Milton in '19 and '20 after redshirting '18 season. But it's all very unlikely anyway ...
@TheOtherSjarifG I just read where Ole Miss sanctions include bowl ban for next year. Rolo should at least take a shot at Ta'amu (and Milton) to see if there's a chance. You don't know if you don't ask. UH starting QB competition will be wide open from what I'm told.
@TheOtherSjarifG Yeah ... I haven't read up on the sanctions yet; they're not bad enough to make him want to finish his career somewhere else?
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 I think Ryan might be making a joke about Bama, but not sure. But sometimes Bama seems kind of like the new ND, special rules for a special brand. Or is that OSU???
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 I think the committee will make whatever assumptions and assertions that fit agenda of who they want in.
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 The thing I don't like about OSU is how they only play when they feel like it and have been like that for years now. CFB likes to talk about how regular season means something. But if OSU is in final 4, losing by 31 to Iowa means nothing.
@TheOtherSjarifG @ninja2911 I think one of Bama's biggest problems was the injury-plagued LB corps, which was exposed by a couple of teams. I don't know this for sure, but if they're healed up by the new year that might make them one of best 4 teams. I suppose same could be said for OSU and Barrett though.
In a #HawaiiFB fan's fantasy world, Ta'amu returns home to QB 2017, and Milton does the same, redshirts, and plays in '18 and '19. What Nick Abramo speculates on here is much more likely: https://t.co/P55GbG84fH

I think a lot of people are excited about the idea of either Alabama or Ohio State being excluded because they dislike one or the other. Schadenfreude in action.
Is it some kind of script-writing rule that every crime show devote at least one scene to which agency's jurisdiction the case falls under?
I just turned in my AP ballot: 1. Clemson. 2. Oklahoma. 3. Georgia. 4. Alabama. 5. Ohio State. 6. Wisconsin. 7. Auburn. 8. UCF. ... It's razor-thin between 4 and 5. I look at good wins, and bad losses.
... If you let all players transfer and play right away, Group of 5 in effect becomes minor-league farm system for Power 5. G5 already has enough little brother syndrome to deal with. I don't know the solution.
It's hypocritical coaches profit so much, even when fired, and have freedom to go wherever they want when they want when opportunity arises, and people putting their bodies at risk are compensated so much less by comparison and restricted by BS amateurism rules ... BUT ...
@forsurftoo Thanks Bob.
@hwsport Also, the (TV) fact that Gomer Pyle was a Marine.
@hwsport Here's another one. Not topical, but timely: Gomer Pyle's speaking voice, Gomer Pyle's singing voice.
@Gofsonka I don't know if he will, but that would be cool if he coaches UCF in the Peach Bowl. He may have insisted on it as a condition of going to Nebraska, which isn't going to get fixed overnight anyway.
Sad that an excellent SEC championship game is flag football. At least it seems equally bad against both teams.
@MikeCherryWMUR Thanks Mike ... first investigative piece is about people mysteriously moving to New Hampshire, a la Walter White in Breaking Bad.
RT @Brett_McMurphy: Source: Scott Frost has agreed to 7-year, $35 million deal with Nebraska, but in days leading up today’s AAC title game…
@hwsport Handled it much better so far than, say, when Kelly left Cincy for ND. I always say it tells a lot more about a person's character how they leave a job than how they start one.
@hwsport Also, what people should realize, is it gives the coach an opportunity to debunk the reports if they are wrong. As we know, especially these days, "reports" are not always accurate.
@jeffpearlman @hbryant42 With just a bit of tweaking, and of the first four graphs could've been a great lead. Outstanding writing.
@hwsport Right ... It's not like McShay was rude or disrespectful about it. In fact, maybe even a bit too apologetic. If he doesn't ask that question there's absolutely no reason for him to be down there.
@coachwags77 You mean to transfer to #HawaiiFB? He does have a redshirt year available.
The sideline reporter had to ask the question; he's trying to confirm reports that Scott Frost is leaving UCF for Nebraska. The coach answered appropriately given the time and place. That's just the way it works sometimes.
And another shootout is decided by the team that comes up with a big defensive play.
I've received three texts about this UCF-Memphis game bringing back memories of #HawaiiFB at its peak in the '00s.

@Gamecock94 @ewhigham @dannykanell Count me among many who agree with you Jeff. Reasons against 8 are all fabricated, especially the one about too many games (March Madness anyone?). It makes absolutely no sense to have a tourney that excludes one of P5 champs, and unfair to exclude an exceptional G5 team like UCF
@HiloHIChadO Thanks. Maybe I'm too optimistic, but I think it's possible to turn it around. It's been done before. Local recruiting is the key. If you can get even just half of the top prospects to stay home, you can win.
@DancerJudy I'm sure UH appreciates your support, and I expressed respect for diehard fans in the column. But you don't seem to understand my role. I am at every game working, as a journalist. Also, is "okole" the word you're looking for? lol.
@davidjhiga I think it's a combination. Yes, stuff is overpriced at the stadium and the incessant commercialization is irritating. I'm not a fan of all that corporate presence either ... I guess people don't notice it as much with the big-time winning programs, because it's there, too.
I like and respect Nick Rolovich a lot. But he's got a lot of work and some tough decisions ahead of him to right the ship that is #Hawaiifb ... it seemed he was headed in the right direction after last season, and that's the frustrating part for fans. https://t.co/pjZBwxPCi5

Hilo leads Damien 21-13, about a minute to go to halftime.
Darren Hernandez pointed this out to me earlier today: Jordan Ta'amu (Pearl City/Ole Miss), Tua Tagovailoa (St. Louis/Bama) and McKenzie Milton (Mililani/UCF) combined to pass for 9 TDs today. Milton also ran for 1. Would've been nice to see any one of them in a Hawaii uniform.
Hilo has taken a 14-13 lead over Damien, midway through 2nd quarter.
Damien leads Hilo 13-7 after first quarter.
And if that wasn't enough excitement, Damien starts off the middle classification game with a 96 yard TD on opening kickoff by Akila Arecchi.
@ninja2911 You can do both, or all three. When neither team can stop each other, the mandatory 2 pointer only helps so much at the prep level.
Important note: When I say "tomorrow morning" I am assuming the Saint Louis-Kahuku game will last 'til after midnight. ... Not saying they're starting tomorrow!!!!
Lahainaluna wins an incredible game, 75-69, over Konawaena in seven overtimes for the #hhsaa state football Division II championship. There are 2 more games to be played here at Aloha Stadium tonight, and tomorrow morning.
Also, maybe at some point you go from four downs to three downs. Meanwhile Konawaena and Lahainaluna are tied 66-all going into the 7th OT.
This is the greatest game in the history of Hawaii prep football. But overtime rule needs to change: Push the ball back 5 yards each overtime. College should do this too.

In watching the recent installments of The Vietnam War series I'm reminded that this country was very screwed up and divided in 1968 — in my opinion even more than it is now.
@crowley_sports1 I've been treated with nothing but respect by police in my encounters with them, even in some situations where I surely tested their patience when I was young and dumb.
@ScottRobbs @crowley_sports1 I'm glad you haven't experienced what some others have, Mr. Crowley.
I had to do a double-take. With his cap pulled down low, Gabe Kapler looks and sounds a lot like Joe Girardi.

Nice read by Brown who keeps and goes the 1 yard for the TD as DSJ is tackled. SDSU 14, UH 7, 0:24 left in first half.
Brown has completed 4 passes in a row and #hawaiifb has first and 10 at SDSU 15.
Trifonovitch misses from 37 yards and #hawaifb still hasn't scored against San Diego State since 2015.
Isaiah Bernard gets behind defense for 47-yard reception from Brown. #hawaiifb ball at SDSU 16.
Mikah Holder catches 16-yard TD pass for SDSU's 2nd TD. Meanwhile, #hawaiifb gets its first first down at 12:45 of 2nd quarter.
After review it's an incomplete pass and #hawaiifb set to punt again.

The 15-yard penalty cost Spartans the option of going for 2 points and a tie score with 8:37 left. Instead it is #hawaiifb leading 30-26.
Williams' high-five of Johnson on way to end zone was pretty funny, but not to Spartans now. #hawaiifb
Johnson with his third TD of night, this on a 96-yard kickoff return. Farris returns Moala's block of PAT try for 2 points for #hawaiifb
Saint Juste, who now has 194 yards rushing on the night, scores again from 1-yard out and #hawaiifb leads 28-20 with 9:00 left.
Tavai's interception in end zone stops San Jose State drive that had reached 18-inch line. #hawaiifb
After replay review, Collie's catch is ruled a TD instead of incomplete. #hawaiifb leads 21-13 at 12:43 of 3rd.
Sainte Juste becomes 1st #hawaiifb player with back to back 1,000-yard rushing seasons with that 38-yard run.
Crawford kicks a 52-yard FG at end of half, set up partly by 15-yard personal foul on Tavai for OB hit. #hawaiifb leads 14-13 at break.
Saint Juste has 84 yards rushing tonight and is now 2nd on the #hawaiifb career rushing list.
Cole McDonald 4 yard TD pass to Dakota Torres gives #hawaiifb 14-10 lead over San Jose State with 34 seconds left in first half.
Sainte Juste scores from a yard out, and San Jose State's lead is cut to 10-7 early in 2nd Q. #hawaiifb
Good news: Ursua with 14 yards for first down. Bad news: Ursua being attended to by multiple trainers. He is up, though. #hawaiifb

Saint Juste makes it a game again with a 75-yard run making it 28-21 late in third quarter. #hawaiifb
One thing #hawaiifb is good at is blocking field goals. Moananu got that one and Nevada's long drive to start 2nd half ends with no points.
@kalilwayne That's what I was thinking, too. In '15 #hawaiifb lost here bc of a meltdown late in first half.
Due to the penalties by UH's offense and its porous defense, this half will end with Nevada leading 21-14 instead of #hawaiifb leading.
Five penalties including 3 personal fouls on that series where #hawaiifb trying to score late in half. Ridiculous.
DSJ with the run of the year, 79 yard TD. But called back for holding on Allen. O-line called for 4 penalties in last 2 plays. #hawaiifb

My first take on #hawaiifb getting crushed by Colorado State 51-21 tonight. With quotes from @NickRolovich https://t.co/bw2H38rS7U
Ursua scores on 16-yd pass from Brown. CSU leads #hawaiifb 44-21. UH has no turnovers. But it has been dominated nonetheless. 12:39 left.
2013 called and wants its #hawaiifb team back. I don't think anyone here tonight would object.

Great hustle by Drammeh for loose ball, and he's fouled. But misses front end of 1 and 1. #HawaiiMBB
Allen stops the bleeding off a pretty pass from Purchase and it's 27-18, 2:23 to the break. #HawaiiMBB
Hawaii has missed its last 8 shots, and UCI leads 25-16 with 3:50 to go to halftime. Anteaters defense is solid. #HawaiiMBB
UH led 14-4, but Irvine fired back with a 12-point run. Anteaters now lead 18-16 with 7:27 left in first half. #HawaiiMBB
Bows off to 9-4 lead against Irvine. Allen with 4 points, 4 rebounds, 2 assists. #hawaiimbb
Allen has 21 and Johnson 11 as #hawaiimbb holds a 66-57 lead over Cal Poly with 3:44 left to play.
Flares leaves with his 4th foul. He's got 10 points to go with fan favorite status. #hawaiimbb leads 62-51 with 6:11 left.
Flasher with the dunk, and he's got 8 points to go with 5 rebounds in 13 minutes. Just gotta stay out of trouble. #hawaiimbb leads 51-44.
Hawaii leads Cal Poly 38-31 at halftime. #HawaiiMBB
Last 3:23 of first half is key for #hawaiimbb ... UH leads by 8, but just committed 10th foul and Cal Poly in double bonus.
UH is shooting 58 percent from floor and leads 26-17 with 7:27 left in first half. #hawaiimbb
Cal Poly has 5 turnovers in first 9 minutes. Very uncharacteristic. #HawaiiMBB
#hawaiimbb off to a fast start against Cal Poly. 'Bows lead 20-10 with hot shooting. Noah Allen already has 9 points.
Speaking of Brady, does he get your vote for goat (a good thing now)? My column about that is available for free. https://t.co/6tnTjur7Al

Nuts and bolts from our website. https://t.co/E4GEYAcEbD
The attendance was announced at 20,447. However many were here, they were as loud as that many. And they braved the rain.
Saint Louis won despite injuries to key linebackers Isaac Slade-Matautia and Noa Purcell.
The Kahuku fans are awesome. With all the emotion they invest, the loss has to hurt, but they're still cheering like their team won.
In the past four years, four different schools have won the top level championship in Hawaii high school football. Two public, two private.
Tagovailoa rushed 18 times for 136 yards and TD, and passed for 243 including a TD. He was intercepted once, on a ball tipped by a receiver.
It's a final, Saint Louis 30, Kahuku 14.
This will be Saint Louis' first state title since 2010, when its quarterback was Marcus Mariota.
Tua Tagovailoa caps one of the greatest individual careers in Hawaii high school football history with state championship.
And now, another turnover removes all doubt. The Cal Lee-Vavae Tata series is even at 1-1. ...
It's still a 2-score game, but Kahuku is not designed to score twice in 2:37.
Dylan Silva goes 43 yards for TD and Saint Louis has this sewn up, 30-14 with 2:39 left.
Freitas with big sack on fourth down and Saint Louis take over at own 48 with 4:13 left and 8-point lead.

Kahuku had dominated Saint Louis' linebacker-depleted defense all the way to goal. Then fumble.
Ball pops into hands of Saint Louis safety Isaiah Tufuga at goal line. Incredible. Crusaders ball at own 20, leading 16-14 with 8 min left.
But another Saint Louis drive fizzles. This time Tobias is good from 40, though, and the Crusaders lead 16-14 with 11:50 left in game.
... and it was another excellent catch by Panoke.
That 52-yard pass to a closely-covered receiver, in the rain, is one of the best I've seen a high school player throw. ...
@billyhull In the freaking rain!
Just when I think Tagovailoa is a college RB, he does that and proves he's a QB. Again.
Saint Louis will settle for another FG attempt. This time Tobias is no good from 40. Kahuku still clinging to 14-13 lead, 4:52 of 3rd
Saint Louis' LB Isaac Slade-Matautia appears to be out for the game, reports Christian Shimabuku from sideline.
This time Kahuku does not take advantage of turnover. After punt, Saint Louis starts at Kahuku 48. Score still 14-13, Raiders.

Panoke made that catch despite having his route disrupted by Kahuku DB. Superb concentration.
Tagovailoa goes long for Jonah Panoke, and Saint Louis regains the lead 13-7.
Washington-Villanueva wide-open , and ball is on the Kahuku 48.
Elvis Vakapuna powers in from the 2, and Kahuku takes advantage of the Saint Louis turnover. Raiders lead 7-6 midway through second quarter.
But this time the loose ball bounces Kahuku's way on punt, Raiders take over at Saint Louis 47 on muffed return.
Saint Louis defense forces 3 and out again.
Not cashing in for those red zone TDs will be costly if Kahuku offense gains traction.

#hawaiifb Coach @NickRolovich right when he says team with 3 straight losses can't assume winning out against anyone.
This is why I only drive and ride Lyft ... more aloha than the competition. https://t.co/Eks09cF4b5

@sluhm I have for moments, Steve, ... but only during day games!
@jwyattparker We have a better deadline than usual bc game started at 2.
@sluhm I need to stand so I won't fall asleep.
One of the few semi-interesting questions left is which team will sub out its QB first. #hawaiifb trails Boise 42-3, 8:36 left in 3rd
A branch from the Bob Wagner/Paul Johnson coaching tree. https://t.co/LXzAVb5noJ
Rypien to Wilson deep for TD after #hawaiifb loses ball on fumble on opening drive of 2nd half. Boise State leads 42-3.
HALFTIME: Boise State 35, Hawaii 3. #hawaiifb
Rainbow Warriors opponents have scored last 90 points. UH is driving now, though. Boise State leads 28-0 at 7:04 of 2nd quarter.
#hawaiifb trick play ends in Ewaliko's pass being intercepted. And then another long run by McNichols. Ball at UH 29. Boise leads 21.
Boise State has now outscored #hawaiifb 76-0 in a little over 5 quarters including las year's game.
McNichols goes 36 yards on 3rd and 1 for another Broncos score at 8:51 of first quarter. Lead 14-0 over #hawaiifb
Boise State needs just five plays to get on board. Rypien to Sperbeck, who makes a great fingertip catch for 35-yard TD. #HawaiiFB
@trifin44 I lobbied for you. Remember? When we hung out in the lobby of the Golden Nugget.
@trifin44 How do you know I didn't?
Hawaii had a chance at the end, but SIU-Edwardsville hangs on to win 69-68. #hawaiimbb
SIUE leads #hawaiimbb 51-44 with 12:37 left. Neither of these teams is very good right now.
Noah Allen's off-balance banker with a second left gives #hawaiimbb a 38-36 halftime lead in season opener against SIUE.
Harris has 10 for SIUE, but #hawaiimbb leads 18-15 midway through first half of its season opener.

Only incomplete on that drive was when Mariota spiked to stop clock.
Another Mariota-Matthews TD caps 2-minute drill at end of half. 7-75 yards, all passing. MM bounce back from INT. Titans trail 19-14.
Mariota gets on track in 2nd Q after 2 3+outs in 1st. Throws 16 yard TD pass to Matthews. Chargers lead Titans 16-7, 11:14 to half.
Big roar as the visiting Tennessee Titans are announced. Boos for the Chargers' opponents mixed with cheers for the Titans quarterback.
In case you missed the final score: San Diego State 55, Hawaii 0. #hawaiifb
That's the thing with a player like Pumphrey. You fake it to him one way and you're 8-on-5 the other way. It's 41-0 now. #hawaiifb
SDSU has 218 rushing yards to 21 for #hawaiifb with about 6 minutes left in third quarter. Score is 34-0. Signing off to write now.

More recently, do you think Barry Bonds' teams might have won at least 1 WS in 22 yrs and reached more than 1 if he was better teammate?
@warriorboutit Disagree. Look at the Angels in the early 1980s for one example. MVPs all over the place and no results. No chemistry.
@warriorboutit Many teams with "multiple hall of fame type players" fall apart due to poor chemistry.
It's sad when a guy who has given it thought says he will vote for the candidate who will be "easier to impeach." That's where we're at.
Jason Heyward reinforces that baseball is way more than numbers. Where's the analytic for being a great teammate and leader? #chemistry

Here's today's column after an exciting but mistake-filled loss for #hawaiifb to UNLV https://t.co/6qfy56BBps
#hawaiifb retains ball as video review shows Kemp fumbled out of bounds. Harris carries 2 for 35 incl. 7 yard TD. #hawaiifb leads 38-31
UNLV comes right back with help of roughing call against Pritchard. Greene caps it with 1-yard run; tied again at 31. 10:50 left. #hawaiifb
Brown 7 yd. pass to Saint Juste and #hawaiifb leads 31-24 with 13:47 left to play.
Kaimana Padello blocks the punt and #hawaiifb takes over at UNLV 45.
Sanchez kicks a 24-yard field goal and #hawaiifb ties it at 24 with 2:15 left in third.
UNLV drives to #hawaiifb 1 and settles for field goal. Rebels lead 24-21.
Ursula with long punt return after 3 and out to start 2nd half, but there's a flag. Holding. #hawaiifb
Can't get much closer first half. Including returns, UNLV has 319 yds and #hawaiifb 322. UNLV 2-14 penalties, #hawaiifb 1-0.
At some point I'd like to see a package with Saint Juste and Harris in the game together. #hawaiifb
Entertaining first half included no turnovers for either team. #hawaiifb
HALFTIME: #HAWAIIFB 21, UNLV 21
UNLV 10-play, 76-yard drive capped with 1-yard rushing TD by Greene. Score tied at 21 with 34 seconds to halftime.
38-yard pass from Brown to Kemp puts ball at 1 and sets up another Lakalaka TD. #hawaiifb leads 21-14 with 2:26 left in half.
Thomas takes a shovel pass from Sneed 63 yards for a TD and UNLV ties #hawaiifb 14-14. 6:07 left in first half.
Harris runs for 35 yards to the 3. Next play Brown hits Dakota Torres for Torres' first career TD. #hawaiifb lead UNLV 14-7.
END FIRST QUARTER: #HAWAIIFB 7, UNLV 7
Saint Juste blasts for 55 yards off tackle. Two plays later Lakalaka goes 1 yard for the TD. #hawaiifb 7, UNLV 7.
#hawaiifb defense looked like the group that started the season 1-3 on that UNLV touchdown drive, not the improved version that won last 2.
Great opportunity frittered away as #hawaiifb loses 20 yards on first three plays and punts.
Paul Harris with a 75-yard kickoff return to start the game. #hawaiifb ball on UNLV 25.

ICYMI: Hawaii 34, San Jose State 17, final. #hawaiifb
Penalty negates big gain, then 1st drop of game for #hawaiifb receivers. SJS takes over after punt at own 7, UH still leads 24-17 late 3.
San Jose State field goal attempt is blocked, #hawaiifb takes over at own 33.
Fumble by Barker and San Jose State has the ball on the #hawaiifb 31. UH still has lead, but Spartans have momentum.
Brown has ball knocked out of hand by Irving, it's picked up by Ginda who runs it all the way for a TD. Spartans close to 24-17. #hawaiifb
HALFTIME: #HAWAIIFB 24, SAN JOSE STATE 10
Brown with 5 consecutive complete passes on that drive that took less than one minute of clock time. #hawaiifb #clockmanagement
Brown to Barker, 39-yard touchdown. Another celebration penalty. #hawaiifb 24, San Jose State 10, :26 to halftime.
Jalen Rogers with the pick this time. #hawaiifb takes over at own 7, 4:11 to intermission.
Mayo intercepts Potter, and #hawaiifb has the ball at its own 33. Credit coverage and pressure.
#hawaiifb 17, San Jose State 10. Brown penalized for over-celebrating.
Brilliant call, execution. Fake to Lakalaka and Brown rolls the other way for 62 yard TD. You can hear his family in Los Gatos. #hawaiifb

Brown finds Collie deep for a 23-yard touchdown and #hawaiifb ties San Jose State 10-10, 12:46 left in first half.
Potter to Holmes for 8 yards and San Jose State TD. #hawaiifb falls behind 10-3 on first play of 2nd Q.
END FIRST Q: Hawaii 3, San Jose State 3. #hawaiifb
Williams' sack of Potter on 1st makes it 2nd and long for SJS at own 7. But on 3rd down Potter finds Freeman after scramble. ball on 40.
Last week Nevada rolled down field on first drive against #hawaiifb, but UH defense adjusted on 2nd series. Let's see if that happens here.
#hawaiifb will also settle for FG on first drive and score is tied at 3.
Great catches by Kemp and Unga have fueled this #hawaiifb drive and ball is at Spartans 6.
#hawaiifb defense finally stiffens on 3rd and 1 at own 2, and SJS settles for field goal on opening drive.
Crazy George, who invented the wave about a million years ago at Earthquake games, is here for San Jose State's homecoming.

If #hawaiifb makes it 38-3 here, I'm closing up twitter shop before end of third quarter.
@SamSpanglerKHON sounds about right.
#hawaiifb leads Nevada 31-3 with 5 minutes left in third quarter. We're researching the "best game since xxxx" stuff.
Remember Paul Harris? He's still around, and he's fresh ... 44 yards and 15 on the next carry ... #hawaiifb leads 24-3 midway through 3rd
HALFTIME: Hawaii 17, Nevada 3. Rainbow Warriors leave field to rousing applause from Aloha Stadium crowd. #hawaiifb
Shades of 2007. Rolo calls icing TO like Ault did ... except this time Zuzo misses the long field goal 2nd time with few secs left in half.
That pass wasn't very pretty, but the result was beautiful for #hawaiifb fans.
Brown rolls right, throw wobbler over Sawyer and Unga grabs it in back of end zone for a TD. With 48 seconds left in half 17-3.
Wow ... #hawaiifb has momentum at the end of the first half. Ball at Nevada 16 with 55 secs left.
#hawaiifb int called on the field is overturned after review. Nevada gets field goal and closes to 10-3 with 2:28 left in first half
#hawaiifb has outgained Nevada 295 yards to 195 at this point of the game. No turnovers by either team.
St. Juste gets 56 yards on 5 carries, and Lakalaka goes the final 4 for the TD and #hawaiifb leads 10-0 after an excellent drive.
#HAwaiifb leads at end of first quarter for first time this season. UH leads Nevada 3-0.
#hawaiifb finally has an incomplete pass with 1:47 left in first quarter. Refreshing change from waiting for first first down this late.
And now a sack ... by Malachi Mageo #hawaiifb.
Tackling much crisper on this series. Russell Wlliams with a smack. #hawaiifb
Brown is 5 for 5 for 69 yards passing after that first drive. Sack and incomplete pass negated by penalties. #hawaiifb
Sanchez hits the 27 yard field goal and #hawaiifb takes 3-0 lead with 5:23 left in first quarter.
5 consecutive first downs for #hawaiifb and ball is at Nevada 5.
After that one to Collie, Brown is 3 for 3 and ball at Nevada 43. #hawaiifb
In Brown's first pass as a starter he completes it to Barker for 22 yards. #hawaiifb
Nevada has first and goal at 9, but #hawaiifb defense saved by a Nevada penalty and Jaxson Kincaide falling untouched for loss on 4th down.
After 3 plays, including Butler going for 55 yards, still looks bad for #hawaiifb defense.
#hawaiifb wins toss and defers. kickoff is 6 yards deep and Nevada starts at own 20. Let's see if Bows tackling has improved.

Woolsey to Kemp for 7-yard TD after Woolsey hits Barker for 37 yards. #hawaiifb 7, Tennessee Martin 3.
Fair slips on 3rd down and UTM settles for field goal for 3-0 lead over #hawaiifb
Rasumussen's personal foul negates Maglio's tackle for loss and UTM gets first and goal at #hawaiifb 7.

@FATJEFF thanks ...
@Jpeezzy31 And we'll learn more about Cal's defense when they play SDSU next week. They missed many tackles against #hawaiifb
ICYMI, final was Cal 51, #hawaiifb 31. Bears coulda punched 1 in at end, and many very grateful they did not. #beatspreadbyhalfpoint
Terrible turn of events for #hawaiifb before end of half. Fumble on kickoff and Cal scores on next play. Bears lead 27-14, 3:43 to break.
Another field goal for Cal, and the Bears lead 20-14 with 4 minutes left in the first half. #hawaiifb
Nice touch Woolsey to Ursua for 31 and a first down to midfield. #hawaiifb
end first Q: Cal 17, #hawaiifb 14
Akoteu  sack helps hold Bears to field goal, and #hawaiifb trails 17-14 with 1:36 left in action-packed 1st Q.
Saint Juste speeds 53 yards for a score, and #hawaiifb ties it at 14 on Sanchez's kick. 3:50 left in first quarter. Over looking good.
@dave_reardon sorry, make that Hanson. Chad Hanson on the TD catch.
Webb to Henson over Rogers for a 17 yd pass into end zone and Cal leads 14-7 with 5:13 left in first quarter. #hawaiifb
Woolsey to Kemp, who breaks a tackle and goes 39 yards for #hawaiifb first TD of #NickRolovich Tied at 7 with Cal.
#hawaiifb drives to Cal 49 on first drive, but Cameron Walker comes up with INT.
No surprise first kickoff of @NickRolovich era is an onside try. Unfortunately didn't work and Cal off to quick 7-0 lead.
3 #hawaiifb players out for opener for discipline reasons. https://t.co/9p9stIlEU5
UH has confirmed LB Jerrol Garcia-Williams, TE Tui Unga and starting safety Daniel Lewis will not play today due to disciplinary reasons.
All 3 were expected to contribute on field today, according to sources.  #hawaiifb #staradvertiser https://t.co/3LyWpDb81p
Per SA's @StephenTsai 3 #HawaiiFB players not at ANZ Stadium. Sources tell us all were expected to play but will not. Discipline issues.

@lsanti1 ok, fair enough.
@lsanti1 I have no idea what you mean. My point if you didn't get it is equality means equal responsibility as well as benefits.
@SidneySidrod It's just as easy to cross the border in either direction. If we're talking citizenship it's a process either way.
@lsanti1 And they are chastised for it when they are wrong. You saying Solo shouldn't be. When you overplay the gender card it weakens it.
@lsanti1 It's hard to celebrate a team that has a person like Solo as a vocal leader.
@lsanti1 According to Scott Chan, field was redone for NFL negotiations.
@warriorboutit That's debatable.

@808Rude But you do have a point about unselfish since they gave away the finals.
@808Rude I watch enough to know that. ... And if you really understood the game you'd know how fragile chemistry is.
Red Sox fans know how this feels. But at least Clemens did 2 years of job laundering with Jays before joining Yankees.

@nkvball Yeah, because they called them wrong ... and Faust was on the bench bc of it. You're right, officiating is terrible.
If refs haveit out for #hawaiimbb, they just missed golden opp to slap Valdes with a foul and put Faust on the line for a 3-point play.
@braddahneil They keep it up and they'll get t'd up.

@HiloHIChadO @AtlantaFalcons Yes, Mack great pickup. A veteran Pro Bowl C  almost always a trickle down positive for entire offense.
@jefferyosbun Yeah, I didn't know Jacque was his dad 'til today. Also he's got some Filipino on his mom's side.
@jefferyosbun Well, we know he can jump. But 31 is ancient for a corner. He's tough but NFL tough is diff than CFB or NBA tough.
@HiloHIChadO @AtlantaFalcons Sanu underrated, underused. But is he worth all that $? I was a big Roddy White fan, but he was getting old.

HALF: Hawaii 40, Fullerton 31. #hawaiimbb led 20-3 and Titans scrapped back into it as Bows got a little sloppy with the ball.
Titans have scored 9 of last 11 and #hawaiimbb lead is 22-12.
3s by Tummalla and Smith again. #hawaiimbb up 16-3. Any fear of letdown after Thursday's big win unfounded.
Smith showed more confidence than usual with that catch-and-shoot for 3. #hawaiimbb leads 10-2 at 15;15.
That spin move by Jankovic on the baseline was big-time. #hawaiimbb leads Fullerton 3-0 at 17:14.

Make it 12, to set new record. #hawaiimbb
Bobbitt and Valdes with 3s and #hawaiimbb has 11 on the game to tie season high.
Irvine has scored the first 5 points of the 2nd half, but Bobbitt hits a 3. 41-26. #hawaiimbb

HALF: Hawaii 38, Irvine 21. #hawaiimbb

UH is two away from its season-high of 11 3-pointers. There is 4:02 left in the first half. #hawaiimbb
#hawaiimbb is 9 for 16 from 3-point range after Bobbitt hits his fourth of the game. It's 34-19.
Ndjiaye blocked by Jovanovic. #hawaiimbb
Drammeh with a 35-footer as the shot clock expires. Tummala with a mere 22 ft.. #hawaimbb lead back to 31-19.
#hawaiimbb is 6 for 12 from 3-point range. That's one way to beat a team with a 7-6 center.
Also two 3s from Tummala. #hawaiimbb
A 16-4 run by #hawaiimbb includes 2 long treys by Bobbitt and some very inspired defense. UH leads 25-13.
The Rainbow Warriors are in Ndiaye's head. #hawaiimbb
Great hustle by Filipovich to tie up Ndiaye, jump goes to #hawaiimbb.
#hawaiimbb leads 13-11 at 11:23. Jovanovic's 17-footer gave UH the lead.
Dunks get an exclamation mark in my notebook. That one by Valdes off the alley from Bobbitt gets three. #hawaiimbb.
Big crowd getting money's worth so far. ... Both teams playing well, Irvine up 11-9 at first media timeout. #hawaiimbb

They're calling it a sellout, but there are patches of empty seats. It's a tickets issued sellout, but not standing room only. #hawaiimbb

Smith's sweet pass to Thomas leads to a layup and #hawaiimbb has closed to 30-26. Should be leading though; 7-16 from line.
Hustle play of the year so far there by Smith. #hawaiimbb
Bobbins is injured on a foul and taken off the court and into the locker room. Beach leads #hawaiimbb 30-20.
Bobbitt's 3 cuts it to 21-12 at 7:39. #hawaiimbb
#hawaiimbb has a lot of problems so far tonight. Don't need to add not blocking out on boards. LBSU leads 21-7.
Valdes is now 0 for 4 on free throws.
Thomas' FTs end 7:22 scoring drought for #hawaiimbb
#hawaiimbb  out of sorts, LBSU leads 12-3 at 11:52. UH has missed last 6 gas both free throw tries and has  5 turnovers in last 6:39.

Here are the nuts and bolts from @FerdLewis and @Brian_McInnis  on #hawaiimbb NCAA sanctions.
My initial takeaway on NCAA's announcement re #hawaiimbb sanctions. More to come after press conference. https://t.co/aAXIykhO0z
Most significant change by NCAA to UH's self sanctions is 1 year postseason ban (2016-17). #hawaiimbb
Bottom line: Schools wanting to hire Arnold will have to "show cause" for 3 years, for Akana, 2 years. #hawaiimbb
@MikeCherry808 But a win for "Coach" Arnold, according to his lawyers,  ignoring it will be difficult for him to be "Coach" through 2018.
Arnold and lawyers didn't take long to get to spin cycle. #hawaiimbb
"(Arnold) violated NCAA ethical conduct rules and did not promote an atmosphere for compliance," says the NCAA. Win for Arnold? #hawaiimbb

@dkmomus I'd rather the money go to families that came to Oahu from Neighbor Islands for the game and went home hundreds of dollars poorer.
@dkmomus read the contract; it's pretty specific about playing the match. No mention of withdrawing due to claiming field not safe.
Since the game never happened, logic dictates the HTA shouldn't pay the $200K to USWNT, right? Plot thickens. https://t.co/7pun49lxOH
@hindstr4 I didn't think of that one!
@hindstr4 I was joking about the football game. Football players will play on cement if they have to. Field is fine for (American) football.

@kauaipeach I've talked to Brian several times about safety issues. With his style of play I don't think he was worried about getting hurt.
@chelsealcoleman @nicksugai @rivalsjeremy That the turf on that field was good enough for some of the greatest in the history of the game.
Cincinnati will play San Diego State in the Hawaii Bowl, Christmas Eve. Assuming the Aloha Stadium field is safe enough.
@mixxedzone I'll try again.
@willfartforfood I don't know, might be too dangerous. Just Kidding!!!!!
@willfartforfood lol. but they do a great job on window tinting.
@mixxedzone Yes, I think I responded that I'm available before 3 p.m. Hawaii time tomorrow.
@keepernotes But thank you for your insight.
@keepernotes In my experience, teams that lose 6-1 often find things to complain about.
Conspiracy theorists out in force. Yes, Trinidad/Tobago is, or was here, seen training on that deathtrap of a field at Aloha yesterday.
USWNT training at Waipio as I tweet. Why no release so fans who had game cxled on them could at least c them there? PR nightmare continues.
While true USMNT hasn't been asked to play at Aloha, Beckham, Ching did recently with no complaint. Pele did back when it was AstroTurf.

Update on #hawaiifb opening next season in Australia against Cal, with quotes from Hawaii AD @DavidAKMatlin https://t.co/bKnyXwgKAl
One thing you can say about Hawaii athletic director @DavidAKMatlin … whether you like them or not, he's making moves.
The decision to play in Australia has strong pros, but cons might make it as controversial to some fans as choice of new coach. #hawaiifb
…has 0 been learned after tough front end of 2015 slate was big factor in #hawaiifb 2-10 mark? @DavidAKMatlin shared y he decided to do it..
My initial reaction to #hawaiifb playing Cal at Australia then at Michigan the next week, followed by at Arizona two weeks later is (1of2)
Hawaii announces it will play Cal in football in Sydney, Australia, to open 2016 season, Aug. 27. #hawaiifb
Sources tell us best bets to be retained on the #hawaiifb staff by new HC Nick Rolovich are Chris Naeole (OLine) and Abe Elimimian (DBs)

The 'Bows are shooting ten pct. points better from the floor (67) than the line (57) tonight. #hawaiimbb
Jankovic has 22 points, including the last 2 on a dunk … but he's assessed a tech for hanging on the rim. #hawaiimbb still leads by 22.
#hawaiimbb shooting a hot 67 percent from the floor and leads Nicholls State 82-57 with 7:59 left.
@Sharkcam I never went, but I remember. No offense, but back then I resented the band's overwhelming presence … proud of them now. lol!
FINAL: San Jose State 42, Hawaii 23
Turnstile gathering of 11,625 for #hawaiifb. State championships last night drew nearly 20,000.
Give Sanchez a lot of credit for that safety. His coffin corner punt put the ball at the 1. #hawaiifb
Scott Harding, Rigo Sanchez … #hawaiifb has become Punter U. Unfortunately, they get way too much action.
Woolsey's pass deflected into the hands of Stubblefield, goes for 77 yards and a TD. Woolsey shaken up on the play. SJSU 42, #hawaiifb 14.
There's been a Trevor Davis sighting … big catch in The Big Game for Cal. #hawaiifb
A sign of life … Ryan Pasoquen recovers onside kick at midfield. #hawaiifb
Harris with a 36-yard run and then 27 for a touchdown. 1:05 into the second half and #hawaiifb breaks the ice. San Jose State leads 35-7.
It's halftime and San Jose State leads #hawaiifb 35-0. The fans here didn't bother to boo as the team left the field. Mercy and/or apathy.
FINAL: Kahuku 39, Saint Louis 14. Raiders finish 13-0 and as state champions.
Kahuku capitalizes on the turnover and improves lead to 36-14 with 4:54 left.
Stokes Botelho with 2nd INT of game … three plays after St. Louis TD called back for holding. Raiders lead 29-14 with 8 min left.
Kahuku suffers a bad snap of its own, Saints get ball on Kahuku 5 and Tagovailoa scores on a 4-yard keeper. It's Kahuku 23, Saint Louis 14.
oh, SNAP. Another high one over the punter's head, Kaniho picks it up, runs 17 yards for Kahuku TD. Raiders lead 29-7 at 10:04 of the third.
TD pass to TE Pua Falemalu from Ah-Hoy and Kahuku lead is 22-7 with 2:03 left in first half.
Raiders now lead 15-7, Saints kicking from 20. 4:04 left to halftime.
HIgh snap goes into end zone, Bernadino makes sure the ball gets out of the end zone so Kahuku gets 2 points for safety instead of a TD.
Stokes Botelho picks it off and after a long return (minus unsportsmanlike penalty), Kahuku sets up at Saint Louis 23.
Make that second and a mile and a half as Tapusoa sacks Tagovailoa
Back to back holding penalties, and a promising drive for Saint Louis looks like something else now. First and a mile.
Saint Louis has run just 7 plays and has had the ball just 2:28 to 10:27 for Kahuku.
Penalties hurting Kahuku, backed up to own 8.
First quarter ends with Kahuku leading Saint Louis 13-7.
No room for Tagovailoa to run and Saint Louis will punt.
Ah-Hoy scores again, this time no doubt. But PAT hits upright, no good. Kahuku 13, Saint Louis 7.
Tagovailoa fumbles, recovered by Kahuku's Kanongataa.
Can anyone in this game keep their helmet on their head?
Kahuku's Ah Hoy fumbles into the end zone, but officials call is that he crossed the plane of the goal line before  doing so. Tied at 7.
Saint Louis fumble on 2nd offensive play, Kahuku recovers and takes advantage of sudden change with long pass to SL 31.
For the 2nd series, Kahuku finds no room to run. But this time these pressure on the punter draws running into the kicker penalty against SL
Saint Louuis scores on blocked punt.
Kahuku's pregame haka gets it a 15-yard penalty, and Raiders first two scrimmage plays are loss of 2 and incomplete. It's pouring.
Radford won on the eve of Brian Norwood's Tulsa defense taking on Ken Niumatalolo's Navy offense.
@808marv Yes, it was one of those meant-to-be moments.
FINAL: Radford 30, Kapaa 13. Rams won the 1981 Prep Bowl after death of  legendary coach John Velasco, who was born in Kapaa.
If Radford hangs on, it will be biggest win since 1981 Prep Bowl when Brian Norwood, @NAVYCoachKen Niumatalolo and Joe Seumalo were Rams
Trivia: Vavae Tata could become third man to win Prep Bowl as player and state final as head coach. Can you name the two who have done it?
Radford TD with 1 second left in first half … Kapaa leads 16-14. Got to https://t.co/o2t0sRqPOW for more on prep state championship games.

@IanScheuring That'd be awesome if that's your speech this morning. Just follow it with, "Any questions?"
@lance_agena Technology gave us great opportunities for synergy through shared wisdom. Sadly it seems to have just as often widened divides.
@lance_agena People shop for "news" the way they shop for food. Some like junk with no real value other than appeal to their taste buds.
@lance_agena And that's where you find lots of opinion and, worse, fiction, disguised as news stories. I get fooled now and then. ...
@lance_agena What often happens is something a reader doesn't agree with politically is retweeted, shared, etc. by others to viral extent.
@lance_agena But what he says is true. People often claim things aren't covered when they are.
I will be on @BobbyCurranShow at 8:03, talking #hawaiifb and #hawaiimbb
#hawaiimbb has gone cold again, 0-for-5 and 1-for-8, but lead is still 13 points with 5:47 left to play.
10:37 left and #hawaiimbb leads 58-38. Coastal Carolina just 5 points in 2nd half.
#hawaiimbb leads 47-33 with 15:57 left in second half. Chanticleers have yet to score since the break.
Bobbitt ends first half the way he started it: with a 3-pointer. #hawaiimbb leads C.l Carolina 41-33 at the break. Bobbitt, Valdes 11 each.
Bows in 1 of 7 shooting skid, CCU closes to 25-18. #hawaiimbb
midway through first half #hawaiimbb leads Coastal Carolina 23-9. Bows hold 12-6 rebounding advantage.
#hawaiimbb leads Coastal Carolina 16-5, shooting 4-of-6 on 3-pointers. Bobbit 8 points, 2 assists.
Another trey for Bobbitt and it's 10-2. #hawaiimbb
For 2nd game in row Bobbitt's first shot is a 3 and 2nd game in a row he makes it. Now he scores on driving layup and #hawaiimbb leads 5-0.
@easytyga A lot left around halftime. Can't blame them … rain,too. Probably less thant 10k in the stands in fourth quarter.
@easytyga As well as four turnovers to none.
@uhsports808 Ok, that should do it. Bye-bye now little boy or little girl.
@uhsports808 And I stand by my opinion. A coach other than Naeole and that could've devolved into a brawl last night.
@uhsports808 Oh, blogged about you? Apparently you didn't like it. Sorry for hurting your feelings/
@uhsports808 I'm not grumpy, I'm just sad for you that your life is so empty that "calling me out" is a big thrill. Actually, I'm laughing.
@uhsports808 Pretty obvious your goal was to get me to react, and you succeeded. You get to do that once, troll. Then you get blocked.
@uhsports808 I don't mind being called out, just not by anonymous cowards.
Did it cost #hawaiifb the game? Probably not. Was it some of the worst officiating I've ever seen? Yes. https://t.co/an8kDZ8EKg
@808hulamom The same thing as the previous seven weeks. Finding novel ways to lose, this time with help of the officials.
@nathankam Yes, I think you're right. Take away that TD and the two fueled by the penalties and score is 21-14, Fresno.
@uhsports808 And who is your choice that would be 2-0 now, anonymous genius? Job 1 is keeping the team together and he's doing that.
I've never seen a team get worse and worse as the season wore on as much as this one. That INT in the end zone is yet a new low. #hawaiifb
Rousey just got knocked out ... And #hawaiifb may have also with that last Fresno TD. It's 28-7, 58 seconds left in half.
Freano State TD fueled by 3 roughing passer penalties. Yes, 3 roughing passer penalties. #hawaiifb
@jwyattparker @NaniWaialeale faith by definition is often irrational. But faith not good excuse to irrationally infringe on right of others.
Impressions from #hawaiimbb season-opener. https://t.co/jTXbNUUkqA
@jwyattparker That's what the supreme court is for, right? appointment for life wrong, though, like unlimited terms for congress.
Since this isn't the SEC, giving up 21 points early against a lower-tier conference foe knocks you out of the playoff for the next 5 years.
@jwyattparker @NaniWaialeale I think the vagueness is by design.
@cowrabbit88 In his 60s.
#hawaiimbb has expanded its lead to 62-38 in the first 6 minutes of the second half. Tummala leads with 17 points, and is 5-for-5 on 3s.
RT @Brian_McInnis: Bobbitt is everywhere. He blocks Montana State's last gasp deep 3 of the half running up from behind. UH looks dominant …
HALF: Hawaii 48, Montana State 27. #hawaiimbb. Will Bobcats outscore Mililani or Saint Louis tonight?
By the way, Chaminade would DESTROY Montana State.
They're still exciting, even when they mess up. Jankovic eventually cleans up the mess and its 42-24. #hawaiimbb
After a couple of 3s, Tummala is suddenly #hawaiimbb leading scorer with 8. And he hits another, for 11 and a 40-24 lead.
Bows started 6-for-6 from field but are 5 for last 17. #hawaiimbb still leads Montana State 26-19.
Team shooting pct. took a beating in that 5 second span. 4 misses. #hawaiimbb
Hawaii subs looked a bit shaky for a while and lead cut to 3. Back up to 24-17. #hawaiimbb
Fleming in the game. #hawaiimbb
Jankovic mixing it up inside, draws foul. Valdes scores off rebound. lead is 10. #hawaiimbb
Thomas with dunk off another Valdes' steal, #hawaiimbb leads 14-6 at 15:49. Bows have made all 6 shots, incl. 3s from Bobbit and Jankovic.
Valdes scores on pretty feed from Jankovic and Valdes' steal and assist results in Thomas layup. #hawaiimbb leads 4-1.
Contrary to popular belief, #hawaimbb players are allowed to take shots other than 3-pointers in the new offense.
Isaac Fleming is warming up and we expect we may see him come off the bench tonight.
RT @Brian_McInnis: As expected, your #HawaiiMBB starting lineup is Roderick Bobbitt, Quincy Smith, Aaron Valdes, Mike Thomas and Stefan Jan…
Beginning of a new Era(n) for #hawaiimbb starts in about 6 minutes against Montana State. How will Rainbows adjust to more structure?
@T_Kaufmann Sounds like the same goofball writes contracts at Fresno and Hawaii.
@LarryBeilABC7 Yeah, that was one of the hardest things to understand. Kept plugging in retreads who didn't have time to grow with team.
@T_Kaufmann Thanks … well, with that being case, may need some rich farmers to step up ...
@LarryBeilABC7 Except for Glanville of course. The only question was how many LBs and DBs he'd send each play.
@LarryBeilABC7 Funny, yeah? "Blitzing" is like "running" in hoops. Every coach says they'll do it, but we never know until they get the job.
@T_Kaufmann I would think so, but I don't know contract situation.
@T_Kaufmann Jones advocates and detractors both make strong cases, but totally ignore the other side of the debate.
@T_Kaufmann  I don't know either. He has spent  time here, but a summer while in college and vacations diff than living/working here.
@T_Kaufmann I wouldn't bet anything either way right now.
@T_Kaufmann I read that … closely.
@LarryBeilABC7 Kissing okole not your forte. Not sure about your X's and O's either! LOL.
@LarryBeilABC7 who stays home, three are three or four Olins, Dominics, etc., who go to continent. ...
@LarryBeilABC7 Chow's mistake was thinking he could keep prime linemen home. His offense might have worked if he could've. For every Jesse..
@LarryBeilABC7 None.
@LarryBeilABC7 has to do his homework just as a newcomer would. Jay and Chow were surprised by things they shouldn't have been.
@LarryBeilABC7 You are right, it's unique, and constantly changing. So a local or former 'Bow who hasn't lived/worked here in a long time ..
@LarryBeilABC7 I know part of being a college coach these days is schmoozing and raising $$. But the AD can show him which asses to kiss.
@LarryBeilABC7 No one here even understands how the state works. Just get the best FOOTBALL COACH and let the AD worry about politics.
@LarryBeilABC7 They should hire the best person for the job, regardless of Hawaii tie or not. But yes, be careful with another former rival.
@FATJEFF He;s not saying.
"I don't think it's a rumor." We do know Pat Hill loves Hawaii. He's here this week doing radio for Fresno State-#hawaiifb game.
Hill to confirm or deny rumors that he's applied for open #hawaiifb head coach job. A source who knows Hill told me recently …
Pat Hill on Artie Wilson's show: "Fresno and Hawaii have a lot of similarities … tough-minded people." Artie says he won't ask ..

No wonder so much of the world hates us. They don't have water and we bicker over cups.
@tsnmike Well, I am a renter. But if this horrible trend continues, I may actually be able to buy here in Hawaii.
@NicoleKato And here I am trying to resist a full-blown midnight meal.
@Buster_ESPN Yes! Why not? But a couple guys will not vote for him for no other reason than to ensure it doesn't happen.
@tsnmike Yeah, and I was just thinking how terrible it is saving that $10 at each gas fill-up!
@NicoleKato Did he say anything about vodka?
@SYRmotsag Easy. Because today I think the four ahead would beat them at a neutral site. That will definitely change if OSU wins out.
@kaina732 I did write a column in today's paper on an option that had not been mentioned much. https://t.co/7rz324wmfI
@kaina732 Sorry, I don't have a short list. I don't have any list.
@SYRmotsag Maybe because TCU, Michigan State and LSU lost and Baylor barely escaped?
Somewhere between throwing a dart and semi-educated guess: Babers to Illinois.
If you're still asking for Ken Niumatalolo as #hawaiifb coach, you might as well ask for Nick Saban. Or Vince Lombardi.
@AlanMiya Where do you get it that "all the fans want" that?
@McChickenzie Wait until you get to calculus! But if you learn trig well, it calc will be easier.
How quickly can Weird Al get "Red Starbucks Cup" written, produced and distributed? #tempestinacoffeecup
@IanScheuring Put ball by his foot, threw it up high to make it look like shanked punt. "Intended receiver" was blocked, interference called
@IanScheuring Yeah, second best I've seen. Other one was a fake punt by Kaimuki's Justin Faimealelei back in 2000. ...
Did you see the hidden human trick? https://t.co/bNhEh38gOq
@MikeCherry808 … but, yeah, it doesn't last very long.
@MikeCherry808 things do get sloppy and shitty at the end of an exiting coach's reign, and dudes do tend to straighten up for new boss. ...
@MikeCherry808 Well, so much for the breath of fresh air adrenaline rush. #HawaiiFB
@MikeCherry808 Whenever there's a new coach, there's all this amazed "Wow, he means business!" and, "There's so much more discipline" stuff.
@ninja2911 career road wins.
@ninja2911 Also for road wins.
All this talk about a new emphasis on punctuality for #hawaiifb players … wasn't that Norm Chow's big thing too?
@GreggDoyelStar @BallState It IS nice. … But they're all beautiful this time of year, right?
@HeismanPundit I don't know why Northwestern is in there, for one. ..
Former UH associate athletic director John McNamara will be president at Communications Pacific. https://t.co/wSBR2TBnhV
@cowrabbit88 I don't think Jones or Miano will.
@duperesa @AaronGionson As I said, zealots on either side of JJ spectrum can't be bothered by facts that don't match their image of him.
@AaronGionson That's fair. But don't forget that he then took them to first bowl game in, what?, 25 years?
@duperesa @AaronGionson I think Chow did a very good job on academics. Maybe the best of any #hawaiifb coach of recent memory.
@duperesa @AaronGionson … colleague of mine thought it was worth a story and did a hatchet job. That kind of thing alters public perception
@duperesa @AaronGionson Bad academics under Jones was a myth. He didn't receive a bonus for some very high team gpa and some asshat ...
@AaronGionson Pro-Jones fanatics can't be told he has flaws and those who are anti-Jones can't see any good in him. Both are ridiculous.
@AaronGionson He is not without issues, and I want to see who applies. But if you won't see he can fix broken programs I can't convince you
@AaronGionson you are tougher grader than I. Oh, and taking over 0-12 team to 9-4 in first yr. (yeah, let me preempt you  "not his players")
@AaronGionson Well, that's one way of looking at it. If you call winningest record in school history, 6 bowls including BCS game "moderate"
@AaronGionson bc I'm paid to provide insights about sports in Hawaii. Seems a couple of people found it interesting. It's fine if you don't.
@maukaman808 @DavidAKMatlin will do fine. He was smart giving himself enough time to make a good decision. The noise will go away soon.
@AdamDamnCuz Well, thanks to Damon Tucker and Lily, maybe some of these clowns will now think twice before doing something like that again.
@NanakuliMBC I don't know why I'm wasting more time on you, but here, read this: https://t.co/mWdI1ccgwj
One more moron and I go on a self-imposed week-long Twitter break.
@NanakuliMBC You're the one accusing. Burden of proof on you. But I can tell from this short conversation that concept is beyond you.
@NanakuliMBC Spreading unfounded stuff like that says a lot more about your character than of those you gossip about. Take it elsewhere.
@NanakuliMBC … Until someone shows me some facts, that's all they are. Go ahead and keep talking about it. As I said before ...
@NanakuliMBC That's not the Advertiser. Advertiser folded in 2010. And beside the point. I've heard the rumors. But that's all they are.
@NanakuliMBC Here's what's really dumb: If you want to rip Jones, there's plenty. Like his overall record at SMU. But I get it. ...
@NanakuliMBC Yeah, it must be true if someone told you it is. I guess that person was there watching, huh?
@NanakuliMBC First, I haven't worked at the Advertiser since 1990. Secondly, so you knew someone who says they knew something?
When you spread unfounded rumors, you are saying way more about yourself than about the person you are gossiping about.
@NanakuliMBC If you have factual information that this actually happened let's see it. Otherwise, why are you repeating a 15-year-old rumor?
@dave_reardon Once again, I should state that I remain in wait-and-see mode. Plenty more applicants will surface.
June Jones critics point to brawling with opponents. Yes, not good. But worse than teammates scrapping each other, like last week? #hawaiifb
When #hawaiifb was winning big, 15-yard penalties were like $1K fine to millionaire athlete. Much different when depending on field position
More #hawaiifb alumni weigh in on who they'd like to see coaching their alma mater. https://t.co/F1ul19S9uW
@VegasRebelFan brain freeze!
@VegasRebelFan thanks!
No surprise, but June Jones confirms he will apply for his old #hawaiifb job https://t.co/8ZQD16Cdk6

@RivalsJeremy No.
This, too: If by some miracle #hawaiifb did get Niumatalolo as HC it would be less than 5 minutes before people complain offense is boring.
I will be speaking from that thing in your car at 3:20 p.m., with the @SportsAnimals … 1420 AM. We will be talking about Coach Norm Chow.
@jubay @HawaiiNewsNow Textbook example. If he'd become an HC earlier in his career may have been different.
(2 of 2) Maybe @NAVYCoachKen will become the next #hawaiifb coach. And maybe it will snow in Waikiki today.
(1 of 2) Ken Niumatalolo makes $1,700,000 a year and is in the midst of a long-term contract at Navy. #hawaiifb
RT @scotthardingUH: I'd like to publicly thank Coach Chow for all he did for me &amp; the program. Always had the team at the forefront of ever…
@uhsports808 Who would that be? Mason was interim HC at SMU last year but this situation is different.
Let it go for one day, dude.
Already got people complaining about the interim coach. Give me a fricking break. #hawaiifb
@uhsports808 I don't see the correlation. Maybe I'm just a fricking idiot. He's the best man for that job right now.
@AaronGionson Do I give new coaches a chance? Yeah. I believe in benefit of the doubt at first. If that's not your cup of tea, seeya.
@AaronGionson … if you perceive my work as tainted by some kind of friend relationship with those I cover, well, so be it. ...
@AaronGionson Not sure I know what you're talking about … "get behind .. media" … I always tell people to be smart consumers of media. ...
@uhsports808 He's INTERIM. Relax.
@AaronGionson That's not what I do.
@MikeHuguenin How you doing boss? Another one bites the dust. At least a year, maybe two too late though.
https://t.co/8Y3IqVTPPr
@kyuen105 I've always been allowed to go to practices. Maybe you should ask coach Chow if he can.
Chris Naeole good choice for interim coach. Remember, this team is on its way to Las Vegas. He will keep order and inject energy. #hawaiifb

Yes, coach, this (feces) does get old … for all of us. https://t.co/WRePlUgbeM
@dave_reardon Cick on link, go to video. Also, the profanity came during  brief interview outside lockers with SA reporters, not on camera.
"My issue has nothing to do with this football team." Um, you're the head coach. For now, anyway. #hawaiifb https://t.co/eDEr1nQebz
Norm Chow used profanity in an interview last night. Second week in a row he did something he would've punished players for. #hawaiifb
@ryantoyomura yeah, some people want me to write another column saying fire him. That's just piling on. Matlin can count and see.
@AdamDamnCuz No, he won't.
@AaronGionson @StarAdvertiser @Joshontheradio @Garyterp It's most lopsided conference home loss.

It's almost 6 p.m. … can just start over?
No. 22 for Air Force runs like No. 22 for Hawaii did a few times last year. #hawaiifb
Another pick. Air Force takes over at #hawaiifb 42.
I think a stat that shows what #hawaiifb RBs do when they get the ball two times in a row might be illuminating.
There's another play that sums up the past 4 years. #hawaiifb

Down but not down; Roberts falls on Jackson, gets up, turns it into a 33-yd gain. AF scores on the next play from 11, leads 14-0. #hawaiifb
First audible boo comes at 5:14 of first as #hawaiifb offense sputters again. Air Force leads 7-0 and takes over at own 40.

@Jpeezzy31 for 1 thing, another coach is less likely to get a 15-yarder that turns the game around. (Demo no stay)
@IanScheuring Nah, I think that you are capable of coming up with your own material instead of repeating Jerry's.
@Jpeezzy31 … guaranteed with Coach Chow still on board. I think they would do better without him and with an interim coach from the staff.
@Jpeezzy31 My guess is UH will wait at least until loss no. 7 which guarantees the losing season. I think the losing season is now ...
@IanScheuring I hope I don't disappoint … there's been more than enough of that lately.
UH AD David Matlin declined comment on Norm Chow's future, but did say, "Another tough road loss. We need to get ready for the next game."
Nevada is now up 30-20 with 2:20 left. #hawaiifb

@808WarriorFan @Linkmeister When you have a deficit like UH does it doesn't work that way.
Another reason to make move before end of season: Gives assistants more time to start looking around at options. #hawaiifb
@Debu808 no problem
@Debu808 Yup, Mason has done it before; he was interim at SMU last year.
I want to get this out there now: When time to pick search committee, AD and former PLAYERS ONLY. Maybe Untermann, Sapolu, Gaison. #hawaiifb
@Debu808 The reason you go with interim during season is so you can have the best pool possible to choose from for the permanent guy.
@SAWARRIOR666 lol. a few hundred people "called" that months ago.
@Debu808 I'm not in the prediction business except for football fever. I don't know who making the call. will learn more later today.
A change of coach does NOT mean you're giving up. There is addition by subtraction when it comes to morale and emotion. #hawaiifb
Waiting until the end of the year is nuts. … Unless #hawaiifb somehow wins next week and puts together a little run. That is very unlikely
@marksaenz3 @Fake808SPORTS It's how many you make, and compounding them by making more, and the timing of them. #hawaiifb
@marksaenz3 @Fake808SPORTS A lot of football is about overcoming mistakes. Every player, every team makes lots of mistakes every game.
@mwfballreview worse than year one. year one there was the excuse of wrong personnel for his schemes. This is his fourth year.
@_mtgoya both. and the players who aren't executing were recruited by and trained by the coaches. #hawaiifb
If Sanchez makes the FG I'm not convinced this team doesn't find a way to give up 10 points in that last 2 minutes. #hawaiifb
@mwfballreview same with the penalties.
@IanScheuring Two years ago had some bad ones, but they were more coming up short than frittering away. #hawaiifb
I've seen many backup QBs come in and lead team to comeback win. But not running a different offense than the team's primary. #hawaiifb
@HIfootballNet Bottom line is they succeeded at neither.
40 yards in penalties, a missed chip shot and a pick in the last 2:14 with game on line … I'm sure I missed some other stuff. #hawaiifb
@Linkmeister Maybe the chancellor can ask Gib for a loan.
@SAWARRIOR666 I'm sorry that they are so depressing for a Hawaii fan.
And getting beat on a 2-minute drill by an option team's back up "passing QB." #hawaiifb
@mwfballreview Yes, that too.
The mistakes at the end of this one are from the not-knowing-how-to-win file. #hawaiifb
This may be the worst of the 34 losses in Norm Chow's tenure. #hawaiifb
30 yards in penalties is no way to get into range for a last-second game-winning field goal. #hawaiifb
Extra point is good, New Mexico leads 28-27. 55 seconds left. #hawaiifb
Apodaca to Gamblin 28 yard TD pass. New Mexico scores with 55 seconds left to tie it at 27. PAT to come. #hawaiifb

@slickshoes26 I wrote after last week's game that if they didn't win 1 of these 2 road games they should replace him before next home game.
@dave_reardon No controversy unless coach decides to start the guy who led team to zero points in three road games. #hawaiifb
If Woolsey continues to perform this well the rest of this game, what would the controversy be? #hawaiifb
Collie from Woolsey for a touchdown and #hawaiifb leads 24-14 with 1:45 left in half.
@DutchFSU don't worry … when and if Florida loses, barring an extremely strange set of circumstances, it falls in the rankings.
@DutchFSU Florida was (is) unbeatem. Stanford was (is) saddled with a loss.
Harris scores and #hawaiifb retakes the lead, 17-14.
#hawaiifb leads New Mexico 10-7 late in first half, but New Mexico is driving.
@Kinau808 you probably did, more than you know … and teachers under your leadership did, too.
@DutchFSU @garlandgillen @wilnerhotline @IDS_BroncoBeat … only goes so far. Or Stanford would be unranked, which would be ludicrous.

@jwyattparker maybe, but I do think there are such things as coincidences.
@warriorboutit Honestly, it's hard to tell. But I thought he and staff did a reasonably decent job of recruiting.
@Jpeezzy31 can't keep a guy who doesn't win in four seasons. If that happens I will ask for transfer out of sports.
@warriorboutit That's what some people would have you believe.
@slickshoes26 I don't know about keeping him on. But that's the trend at UH now. Fire folks and give them a few months to clean out the desk
@warriorboutit I know the odds of that are very slim.
@warriorboutit I said that bc some people think I enjoy this crap. I don't.
@slickshoes26 … and one loss away from fifth losing season with five left to play?
@slickshoes26 I'm saying, yeah, 2 more losses. Next 2 games road. Who is gonna go Aloha Stadium to see team on 5 game losing streak? ….
@schadjoe Loved when he punted on 3rd and 8 against Citadel. Leading by about 28 in third quarter. "Offense didn't deserve another down."
@dave_reardon But does that look likely? Unfortunately, no. #hawaiifb

Pumphrey 4 yard run and SDSU lead is 28-14 with 13:00 left. #hawaiifb
Wittek clutching his right knee, looks like he's done. Manages to walk off field. Woolsey in to replace him. #hawaiifb
On third and inches, Wittek scores on a keeper, Warriors close to 21-14 (it stands after another thrilling replay review). #hawaiifb
It appeared Davis cashes in from a yard out. But after review his knee hit the ground before the end zone. #hawaiifb
Jackson recovers SDSU fumble at the Aztecs 26. Davis rumbles for 11 yards. #hawaiifb has some momentum in third quarter, down 21-7.
As you might expect, a chorus of boos as the half ends. SDSU leads 21-7. #hawaiifb
Pumphrey already has 102 yards rushing with 10 minutes left in first half. #hawaiifb
Davis scores on a 1-yard run, breaking #hawaiifb 2-game-plus scoreless streak. SDSU 14, UH 7.
Good one. Keep 'em coming. We're gonna need it. https://t.co/agoxXZqbwg
Pumphrey scores again, and SDSU leads 14-0 at 9:10 of the first quarter. And the field isn't even blue. #HawaiiFB
#hawaiifb turned the ball over on its 3rd play from scrimmage, as Pedroza was stripped of the ball after catching a slant.
Faulk, I mean, Pumphrey for 8. #hawaiifb
Pumphrey and the Aztecs made that look easy. Off tackle for 34 yards and a TD. 7 play drive, all runs. SDSU 7, #Hawaiifb 0.
To answer everyone's question: Yes, Pumphrey is playing.. #hawaiifb
Could be another Shakeup Saturday in the polls. TCU, Alabama, Michigan State all trailing.

@marksaenz3 I know what emojis are, barely. I just don't know what those mean. Thumbs up and ?
@Linkmeister @ESPNHonolulu Well, I guess that's what happens when the Giants don't make the postseason. Snarky enough?
@marksaenz3 And I have no idea what those things next to the words you wrote mean.
@marksaenz3 My only bias is against bad football, regardless who is playing it.
This Washington/USC game needs more than the usual "due to time constraints" edits.
By all means, let's keep the cycle of xenophobia going. Maybe the teacher can sell it to her as knowing your enemy. https://t.co/wCQf4JED36
@Linkmeister @ESPNHonolulu Maybe on their sister station, 1500?
Ane, Freitas, Lolotai, Polamalu, Sikahema will enter @PolynesianFBHOF http://t.co/A0dMlg2mKN
@cowrabbit88 He was very good.
FINAL IN OT: Jazz 117, Lakers 114.
@jasonkaneshiro and I agree their hasn't been buzz at SSC like this since 2011 Wahine/USC NCAA volleyball regional. #lakers
Tied at 105. Overtime. #lakers
Larry Nance, Jr. has checked into the game for the first time with under 6 minutes left. Tied at 94. #lakers
Chants of Kobe, Kobe, Kobe after Bryant hits a contested trey to give #Lakers 71-65 lead.
Randle with the breakaway slam, and this is starting to look like Showtime. #lakers
RT @Brian_McInnis: Trevor Booker (middle, headband) ejected and banished back to the Sheriff locker rooms. One tech on Roy Hibbert http://t…
Trevor Booker with the hook … not a hook shot, but  a wild swing at Roy Hibbert. Now Bryant feeds Hibbert for slam. #Lakers up by 8.
Swaggy P for 3 and the Lakers lead 60-55 at 7:41 of the third quarter.
You knew I would re-tweet this one, right? https://t.co/Zaa7wNvGct
It's halftime and the Jazz lead the Lakers 49-48.
@AdamDamnCuz I think UH could probably beat Idaho.
Hey, the Lakers have taken the lead. It's 48-47 with 23.7 seconds left. #lakers
Bryant hits a pull-up 10-foot baseline jumper and the Lakers close to 39-29. #lakers
The Jazz are up 21-9, but most importantly, Kobe's getting his. 5 of the 9 points. #lakers
Forgot to tell you guys about this. SI was in Hawaii a couple weeks ago to do a series on our state's grid culture. https://t.co/8sBacozdM8
Bryant's air ball grows a few jeers. But he is top scorer with 5 points. Game is tied 7-7. #lakers
Rainbow Dancer turned Laker Girl O'oe Carr did a fine job with the national anthem.
Kobe Bryant hit a 16-foot jumper on the Lakers first possession.
@JalenRose just started talking about what happens on recruiting visits … good stuff, and I'm sure it's gonna get better. ...
@DutchFSU I briefly considered NU for No. 1. Stanford win looks better each week. Baylor-Northwestern would be a very interesting game.
@DutchFSU No worries, and sorry if I came across as defensive. … it's all still very subjective at this point. By the way ...
@DutchFSU good point re Utah. but hard to evaluate if crushing Oregon this year is big deal, although Michigan win looks better every week.
@DutchFSU Yes. Obviously I watched their game against Hawaii closely. They had difficulty with a team that Boise State just beat 55-0.
@DutchFSU That's twisting my words. Keep doing that and this conversation is over. Like I said, show me a better one ...
@DutchFSU If you can tell me which unbeaten team has a better win that I ranked below Florida, I will say, ok, you have a good point.
@DutchFSU … at this point, you deserve a high rank. It's still a small sample size, and teams are still rounding into shape …
@DutchFSU actually, it kind of is at this point … if you've won all your games and one of them is against the team that was highest ...
@DutchFSU Anyway, as you said, it will all play out in the coming weeks.
@DutchFSU Why do you not mention Ole Miss?
@DutchFSU We're instructed to vote on who we think are the best teams now based on what they've done, not what they might do down the line.
@DutchFSU  If I remember correctly they won all of those games.
@IDS_BroncoBeat I thought about doing that but went with Baylor. My Clemson option fell through when it had trouble closing.
@nicksugai Might take some time for me to rank a team again that loses by 42 at home.
RT @kelliebruhh: #noahmontemayor pls come home bud
@Andy_Staples It's more fun for some to take shots at media than acknowledge polls generate discussion; plus, they get to call us dummies!
Poll vaulting: Plenty of movement in my AP Top 25 college votes as highly ranked teams lose or win unimpressively. http://t.co/4kdGyNpEFn
There should be no such thing as video replay in a 52-0 game. #hawaiifb
Ikaika Woolsey starts the second half at quarterback for #hawaiifb. He is roughed on the first play.
First half ends with Boise State ahead 49-0. Widest margin for BSU since a game against Weber State. #hawaiifb
McNichols runs 15 yards for Boise's 7th touchdown of the first half with 4 seconds left. 49-0. #hawaiifb
@Sharkcam yeah, maybe they suited up some visiting recruits.
With 5:01 left and the result in hand, Boise is playing reserves. … 5:01 left in the first half that is. #hawaiifb
RT @IDS_BroncoBeat: True freshman WR Akilian Butler scores on the end-around. That's his first college touch
Thompson's interception is reviewed but confirmed and Boise scores again two plays later. 35-0.
@jwyattparker at this point it doesn't matter what plays they run. They're not very efficient at anything.
@jwyattparker Boise ran something similar to that trick against UH in 2004. It was about the only thing that didn't work as BSU won 69-3.
@jwyattparker They already do it, but it's unintended.
That trick play touchdown makes it 28-0, Boise, with 9:44 left in the first half. #earlycover
RT @IDS_BroncoBeat: Rypien with the fake fumbled snap, TD throw to wide open Holden Huff. Love that play - a classic around here
I thought Jared Zabransky's eligibility was expended. #hawaiifb
