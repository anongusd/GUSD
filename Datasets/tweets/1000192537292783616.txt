@WalshFreedom Why all the fuse?? Come on Joe ... For almost 20 months the MSM has been reporting "Collusion" and "obstruction" by the Trump campaign..without a single piece of evidence and now we are finding the Truth and CNN won't say a peep of any the corruption that was going on with libs..
@happyendingzzz @RealSkipBayless They really don't care about the Anthem that's true.but they care about ratings. millions and of people are NOT watching NFL because of these protests and that's what they care about.The moneys they are losing! Me personally I'm gonna watch either way. I am a die hard fan!
@JemimahMoet Why??
@Bryan700 @PolishPatryot Because he's not a Democrat anymore !!
@JackPosobiec I absolutely love how the President calls them out on this "Every Single Day" !!!
@JackPosobiec Where the heck is Sessions?? He is apart of the establishment and is staying away for "what" purpose??
@JackPosobiec A 2nd Special Counsel needs to be appointed to go after all those corrupt individuals..!!
@RealSkipBayless I agree START Mayfield!!
@RealSkipBayless Cowboys aren't even make the playoffs this year!!
@RealSkipBayless I'm just happy that Jerry Jones is making his team STAND for the National Anthem...thank God for Jerry Jones!!

@john_keim @JasonLaCanfora I think he still has gas in the tank!
@kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump McSally is all of the sudden trying to run as a Conservative and she is now embracing this President ...point her as what she is ..a FAKE!
@chucktodd Chuck I am listening to your show...and all you say is that the President is possibly revoking the Security Clearances of 9 others that made CRITICAL statements....you fail to mention that they are ALL FIRED except for one (Ohr)
@DrEtiquette Because all they do is HATE ...
@evansilva Didn't they have a chance to get Guise?

@TIME NFL is really disappointing...College football is where it is at...!! At least they honor our flag and stand for our national anthem..
@kelliwardaz @realDonaldTrump McSallys advertisement on the radio ...because she plays a tid bit with the President praises .... It needs to be known that McSally is trying to embrace the President but NOT his policies...and it needs to be known that the Presidents actually endorses Dr.Ward! Not McSally..
@steelers Don't worry it is only the pre season ...fly EAGLES fly!

@AthavaleAmy @realDonaldTrump And what promises did Hillary make...um...let's see raise taxes..abolish ice ...open borders ....she ran a hate campaign against Trump and got her a$$ handed to her
@BrightCocker @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Lmao...what kinda lala land do you live in? Let me guess San Fran?
