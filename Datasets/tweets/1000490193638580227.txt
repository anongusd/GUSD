@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris What facts? What facts have you given?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris There is a difference between facts and opinions seriously i promise you there is.

@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris What facts? You still haven‚Äôt given any?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Um yeah it is.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Lol I have comprehensive problems but you keep talking about imaginary facts and you argue that no security is better then security. Ok.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris But that is exactly what your saying.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris What facts I‚Äôm still waiting?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Says the guy giving imaginary facts.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Not.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris So your admitting now that what you have said is opinions not facts. Great we are getting somewhere.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Oh we are still taking about the sources for your imaginary facts you still haven‚Äôt provided?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris I have no logic, reason, or facts, says the guy who calls opinions facts and thinks no security is better then security. Bahaha
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Right so the FACT that hundreds of thousands of illegals walking across our borders as well as drugs and criminal gang members isn‚Äôt a basis for me and the other millions of Americans to believe we need a border wall.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris If it helps you sleep at night.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Any sensible person can see the wall is needed. We need borders security.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris What facts and what sources? You still haven‚Äôt given any?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Again you have given no facts or sources. Still waiting?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Unfortunately they are only accurate in your mind. I have been listening and all I hear is an ignorant person claiming to have facts while only giving opinions on something he knows nothing about.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Who doesn‚Äôt come in where? And how about you list some sources of these imaginary facts you keep talking about?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris What facts?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris And yes I believe a border wall is better then nothing your point?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris What facts have you provided lol?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris You have no idea what your talking about. You keep living in your fantasy land while us real Americans fight for real protection.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris You have no idea what your talking about.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris You have provided no facts only opinions dude. Lol
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Yes they really do. And you tell me I live with my head in the sand.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris I would say it‚Äôs more like a dam keeping America from drowning in drugs, illegal aliens, criminals debt from the billions it cost us having all these illegal walking across our borders.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris LOL your analogy is just as stupid as your logic and argument.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Lol these are not facts these are opinions. Look up the definition of facts bud. You have not proven anything.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Ok I think your argument that no security is better then security is stupid. Does that help?
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris The only my fact you gave was that tunnels were found which is just as stupid as your argument that makes no sense. Good luck with that.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris Thank you for that correction, Voice text doesn‚Äôt always differentiate the way we want it to.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs ok I get no protection is better then any protection. Good luck with that logic.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris And greatly reduced the amount of traffickers, drugs, criminals, and illegals that are just walking across.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris So again allowing illegal aliens, criminals, drugs and traffickers, to roam freely back and forth across the borders is better then a border wall then would greatly minimize the effects of this. Got it.
@CartmanUK29 @DaveCooperfone @KamalaHarris Your argument is what is useless.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris So free rain is better then some kind of protection. Great argument.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris They walk right across our borders, drugs, criminals, traffickers. The wall is necessary for security at our borders.
@CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris For real this is your argument, I‚Äôm sure they will all be out there in the heat with their shovels.
@DaveCooperfone @CartmanUK29 @KamalaHarris The dems have been offered multiple deals. #PelosiSchumerShutDown

@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY No you don‚Äôt know what your taking about. There are Christian students whose parents help pay the taxes that pay the teachers. And the field trips are funded by the parents not tax payers dollars.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY No they don‚Äôt parents fund it and it should be an option in all schools public or not.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY Yeah teachers are payed with taxes, there are Christian students whose parents help pay those taxes also.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY You have no idea what your talking about.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY Parents fun the trips period.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY It isnt tax money that funds feild trips its the parents. And it would be up to the parent and the students if they wanted to go.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY Yes but there are Christians students who go to public schools whose parents pay taxes also, so as I said they should have the option. Even if a student isn‚Äôt Christian and just want so learn about Creastion and Christianity, they should have the option. Parents fund these trips.
@CooterLlibnagoh @USATODAY Yes but there are Christian students in public schools and they should have the option. So again we will have to agree to disagree. Have a nice day.

@realDailyWire @DavidLimbaugh @benshapiro I myself felt foolish for having judge the Bible without haven‚Äôt read it. In my case I had heard others say negative things about the Bible and just took their word for it, until I decided to read it, and then realized how foolish I was to have denied it without even reading it.
@realDailyWire @DavidLimbaugh @benshapiro I appreciate David how you said you originally denied the Bible being God‚Äôs word without having read it, as I too did this, and came to the same realization while reading the Bible that it is the inspired word of God.
@DavidLimbaugh ...now knowing good AND evil.
@DavidLimbaugh I haven‚Äôt been studying the Bible for long, and yes it is hard to understand certain aspects like this, but if God didn‚Äôt allow bad things to happen, it wouldn‚Äôt be free will; makes you wonder then how great free will really is when you see some of the things man does with it.
@AirForceDave7 @DavidLimbaugh So if you look at it in that sense, or when I did, it made sense that you can love and fear god as a child can a parent, but out of love. Sorry if I didn‚Äôt explain that very well.
@AirForceDave7 @DavidLimbaugh And just like when a child disappoints loving parents, or does something they know their parents don‚Äôt approve of, they also know there are consequences to or possible punishment. Although it is punishment or consequences given out of love and for the child‚Äôs benefit.
@AirForceDave7 @DavidLimbaugh I started studying the Bible a couple years ago and also have had a hard time wrapping my brain around certain aspects of the Bible like fearing god. Someone explained to me that fearing god is like when a child fears disappointing their parents.

@jedishive @SamHarrisOrg I believe he is a great guy who is a victim to a mistaken identity and vicious character assassination by the Democrats who do not want a conservative judge in the seat of the Supreme Court.
@jedishive @SamHarrisOrg Not to mention, aside from her accusation, it is completely unlike the character and integrity he has shown throughout his whole life, with serveral women, men, and the American bar association, who collaborate his character and integrity.
@jedishive @SamHarrisOrg His calendar show, like I‚Äôm sure his school records show, that he participated in sports and earned a degree at one of the most profound law schools in our country. I‚Äôm sure if he was the drunk partier everyone‚Äôs trying to claim thats was he, that he wouldn‚Äôt of succeed as he did
@jedishive @SamHarrisOrg Ford is the only one that has no collaboration and no evidence, she is accuser and she is the one that needs to provide some evidence.

@SamHarrisOrg 2. Maybe he feels he and his family have been put through enough for allegations without evidence and because none of the allegations have been collaborated by any witnesses, and because democrats are only looking to delay and grasp at any opportunity to delay and smear him more.
@SamHarrisOrg 1.Maybe he doesn‚Äôt want any further delay so that even more ridiculous claims can be made, such as, the claims made by Avenatti‚Äôs client. With all the ridiculous claims over the past 10 days, it seems justifiable to me for him to not want to give them more time to smear him.

@Alyssa_Milano Coming forward 35 years later is not just irresponsible on the part of Ford who was so bothered she waiting 35 years to come out with it, but also absurd. In my experience when something traumatic happens to you, you don‚Äôt forget where and when it happened.

@politico The obvious corruption and obstruction of justice going on with the democrats is sickening and it‚Äôs even more sickening that they continue to be allowed to obstruct and corrupt.
@politico It‚Äôs clear Feinstein did not have the best interest of either Kavanaugh or Ford at heart and only wished to use these accusations to the advantage of the democrats and their desperate attempts to deter republicans and anyone affiliated with them.
@politico If anyone should be investigated it should be Feinstein who dishonestly sat on Fords‚Äôs accusations until it was of the best political advantage for her to use it. Feinstein is so concerned with there being enough time to investigate Ford‚Äôs accusations yet she sat on it for months
@politico So Ford wants the FBI to investigate ahead of her testifying because she feels some senators have already prejudged her, isn‚Äôt this proof that some senators have already prejudged Kavanaugh? But that‚Äôs ok right?
