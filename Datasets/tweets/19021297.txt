@robkroese that's ok.  I'll probably bore you. Which is sad because I've decided the only reason for Twitter is relief from boredom.
@smacula I am embarrassed by the inaneness of my own twitter conversations sometimes. Procrastination makes me inane.
@smacula I invented it when I was 12. Sourdough bread works best. Seriously better than the sum of its parts.
wondering why 200 people are following someone who has tweeted 3x. Seriously-help Twitterverse I need to be a Twitterguru by Monday.
@smacula that's sad. Try some Cecebread =toast, peanut butter, mini marshmellows & chocolate chips all under the broiler till gooey. Yum.
@smacula #rebeldog begged for it for his birthday. It's a good way to ruin nice peanut butter cups.
@smacula just don't put them in peanut butter ice cream. peanut butter ice cream smells like dog farts. I kid you not.

@adamloving Need to ask some questions about Twibes. NIH may want to use it in research but need to nail down some specifics. Can we talk?

@clairethomey no way. That's my faux mother in law's birthday too.
@clairethomey when is your mom's birthday? I will make it for her then if the mints not all dead.
Did not eat the #ice cream. It is so unbelievably good I'm going to use it to further my career instead.

@AaronBillard   If Satan walks the earth you can bet he Tweets. Thus the good guys should be on Twitter too.
Not that I'm anti-scantily clad. Its just weird opening Twitter on an office computer to tweets that look like hooker solicitations...
Thinking maybe @TheBloggess is right & I should unblock the scantily clad. Just don't like reading their graphic tweets on my follows...
@clairethomey usually the stove will have a place where the flame shoots up between iron burners if gas & flat burners that get red if not.
Wondering whether #TheBloggess thinks its ok to block people with half naked avatars. #Twitterettiquette.
@clairethomey. If you think it might be a gas leak get out of the house and then call 911. Don't use anything that might spark.
@clairethomey If it smells like sulfur & they have gas heat/oven it might be a leak. Natural gas doesn't smell so they add an odor to it.

Unfortunately (but fortunately for @AaronBilliard) the meetings for the government so I need a real smoker. But you are a mensch!
Thanks so much @AaronBillard. Not every day a man of God is willing to lie about his smoking status to save a bureaucrat!
Just re-read her blog archives and unfortunately (or fortunately for her) @TheBloggess does not smoke.  Alas my meeting is doomed.
Wondering if @TheBloggess is a smoker (of nicotine)...And if so if she would try to use Twitter to stop smoking.
Wondering how fired I would be if I managed to wrangle @TheBloggess an invite to our #Twitter meeting. She writes an advice column...
Thinks her colleague should read thebloggess.com She makes me look TIC

#famousexcuses  We can't afford it (why healthcare failed last time)
I sense a theme @theterrymac tee hee
Do warmbloods have big fancy gaits because they're big or because their hindquarters are big or their shoulders or better or what?
But when things suck w/healthcare (ie, no cure, bad side effects) you can't "take things back".  Even the best MD can't cheat death 4ever.
OH on Southpark "In America when things suck, you get to take them back".
According to #TwitterBook (I think it was them) 22 tweets per day needed to build a good following.	Seriously who has this kind of time?

Photosynthesizing hair-will @MarkWarner block me cause I'm nuts or recognize a perfect idea for #Janelia Farms and VA industry/economy???
this from a priest...RT @AaronBillard "I think Facebook should have an 'ENEMIES' section... I kind of like the drama that supposes."
@clairethomey even if just pets and livestock could photosynthesize imagine the cost savings. No more $50.00 bags of #dog food	#energy
@MarkWarner w/scientific breakthrough (I suggest hair that photosynthesizes all our energy needs) we could pay &lt; 4 food & more 4 healthcare
@MarkWarner and doctors are putting back together a human body. Its not a Chevy. There's no warranty. But we expect 77+ year lifespan.
@Mark Warner How to do that when "healthcare" is an inexact science at best. Many things doctors try don't work.
RT @MarkWarnerNot enough that health reform is paid for - it must start driving long-term costs down - http://bit.ly/q0Cld
@MarkWarner How to do that when people think they have a right to pay anything to save their lives?

Not that I would ever groom while teleworking. Grooming is actually more aversive than my day job!!!
And to be clear I was able to groom dogs because I didn't have to drive to work and back. It was almost luxurious!!!
Terrier Tuesday is almost palatable when combined with Telework Tuesday! Veru 75% stripped. Ivan 100% bathed.
@clairethomey congrats Magnolia and Whitney! Way to go!!!
@thomvernon thanks!  Seems system favors bills affecting a majority but limits laws concerning a minority of the pop. Sigh...
http://twitpic.com/2tw8o - Too windy 4 outside photos. Went to Als Orchid Greenhouse instead. OOC! 2 phals & 1 phap! Should keep me busy ...
@lscaife no Addies in Rockville- much better!
Driving home post dinner w/ in laws. Lovely people. I'm so lucky.
Schoolhouse Rock's been in my head all day. But if the sponsor doesn't get reelected whither goes the Bill???
Sometimes my job is really really hard! :( I know I'm fortunate to have one but today I'm not feelin' the Luv one bit! Whimper!
@moorejh what's an isobololgram?
Anyone know how a bill gets out of committee? How pathetic is it I don't know this?Well rounded liberal arts education - Not!!!
April not starting out too well! Grrrr!
@cesky2000 some say Beagle x to Charlies=Cavalier. Some say Cocker or Springer was used. Kooikerhodje interesting but r they 2 feisty?
@cesky2000 Thanks! So sad-I've have had 3 w SM syms. Breed needs 2 start new; Maltese+ beagle, setters, springers & sussex=Cavalier Nouveau
@clairethomey bright overcast is the best for flower photos. Hope you get to take lots and have fun w/your Mom! I'm doing my no rain dance.
my patriotic duty to stimulate the economy...	http://tiny.cc/YzvJ1
I am shovel ready!!!
Contemplating a Southern States run for pansies which cannot be planted in the rain but can be photographed! tee hee!
Having a parrot tulip-fest. Is it wrong to waste a weekend taking flower pictures? I am addicted to the loaner D700.
Blurry noses in dog images-acceptable or not? http://tiny.cc/qCeNW
Wondering how much Margery Good would charge to strip Ivan and Veru monthly.
Bruised knees and biscuit crumbs in my tights; must  be  #flyball Sunday!
3 nails broken, every muscle tied in knots, 2x screamed at Mr S. Must be a # flyball tournament. I think I'm owed dinner@Magnolias.
@jranck try #nouriel roubini-been following him since BT (before Twitter). He predicted this mess 4 years ago.
@bevhollis I just saw your Tweet about Ivan in Nova dog. Which picture? Where can I get some copies? Very exciting!!! :)
http://twitpic.com/28bu8 - Out at Magnolias for the 2nd time in 2 days & yes I'm having the salad & salmon Again! Why mess with success???

Is picking up her refurbished best dog show shoes ever from the shoe repair people. I feel so green!
Holy mother of bargains batgirls! Just got butter colored goat suede jacket at Brooks Bros outlet for $112. The goat probably cost more!
@clairethomey How'd it go?
Contemplating a movie, bookstore, chipotle expedition. Is anything good playing-its been eons since I saw a real movie in a theater?
Boss out for the day, Mr S. on a roadtrip, & I get to telework in peace. Who says Friday the 13th is unlucky?
Panasonic CF-Y4 wheelpad craps out intermittently. Is this forshadowing total laptop meltdown? Huge PITA!
Hey Tweethearts! New Drug Czar is here... http://tiny.cc/BNXMX Raise your hands if you feel you're the last one to know...
http://twitpic.com/20fn4 - Dinner w/ Mr S at Magnolias at the Mill & our fave server Yay!  http://piurl.com/1Kk_ : current location
Since women are paid 30%less 4 the same work maybe they think we won't notice if our pants have 30% less material!
Why  do designers still think grown women want to wear capri pants to work? No one would suggest them to businessmen.
Beastly beltway how u vex me but u r the fastest way home. Again, my kingdom for a Reston to Rockville bridge.
First cherry trees blossoms on the Rockville Pike! Spring has sprung hooray!
A new low or maintaining a semblance of standards?  Nuked leftover pork with fennel in tupperware by candlelight.
Science guiding policy instead of politics. How refreshinghttp://tiny.cc/LloTI
Is just reminding people to please pass in the left lane NOT sit there going 50 mph chatting on the phone so nobody else gets by!

@donedieting You asked. Also I lost 101/5 lbs on Atkins several years ago. My numbers were never better. Read pubmed clinical trials.
