@NowNesara @realDonaldTrump Romans 16:17¬†I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them
@NowNesara @realDonaldTrump Leviticus 19:33-34 ‚ÄúWhen a stranger sojourns with you in your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.‚Äù

@AnaDeary @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump Don't get me wrong peace would be a great thing. but for forgetting everything they have done in the blink of an eye and shaking his murderous hand is a joke. It's just another empty publicity stunt. But that's politics for you!
@NowellKern @sandra8301 @iamfonda @CIA You reported all his terrible tweets! lolüòÇ talk about hurt feelings and tears.. maybe you need a safe space you snowflake..
@AnaDeary @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump Obama article you sent shows he was tough on immigrants or he wouldn't have prosecuted them, and the children detained were unaccompanied. Should we turn them around and send them back into the desert and tell them good luck? No! help them!
@AnaDeary @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump Wow! are you going to send me an article about Flat Earth and the Illuminati taking over the world next
@AnaDeary @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump That is true I do hate Donald Trump... before he was president and I will hate him after he's done. only time will tell how much his Administration will destroy and divide this country
@AnaDeary @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump That child was at a protest. The person who made the meme that's been passed around was clearly uninformed that doesn't change the fact that it was happening
@AnaDeary @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump All this proves is that he was lying to all his voters saying they couldn't do this without the Democrats and that it's their fault 2 Days Later they change the law without them! surprise surprise another lie from comrade TrumpüòÇ
@NowellKern @LibTearsRCool @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump That is not illegal. that is seeking Refugee in a country that is supposed to be great.
@NowellKern @LibTearsRCool @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump I get it!  you don't have any morals or feelings toward other humans. Just what makes you look good in the moment I can judge you but God will
@NowellKern @LibTearsRCool @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump Yes I do Most Western countries grant¬†asylum¬†to aliens who can demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution in their country of origin for one or more of five reasons: race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Those granted¬†asylum¬†are allowed to¬†work
@canaweb @NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump You're right! illegal child traffickers normally go into the immigration office and ask for Asylum... I heard this is very normal.
@NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump Matthew 25:35 ‚ÄúFor I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me.‚Äù
@NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump But you must be 100% Native American. I assume you didn't have ancestors come here, they must have already been here.
@NowellKern @TerriAnn1968 @sandra8301 @TalbertSwan @TrudeauMacron @realDonaldTrump They didn't just kick the can down the road.. they allowed Asylum! they didn't break families apart. the Bush Administration put it into place that children could be detained if they were unaccompanied buy an adult or legal guardian. never split up from the parent they came with.
@rumsturum @Official_Evoxx @mazzie @HouseGOP @realDonaldTrump Don't worry everybody. this will all get figured out as soon as we have space force. I heard they're building Voltron while we speak! https://t.co/VvLcKCY2uZ
