Panetta contradicts WH officials from Oct. 21 call, says will continue to negotiate SOFA if Iraqis want it. But he won't say they misspoke.
The message pattern emerges: Dems note that Bush negotiated withdrawal deal; GOP focuses on Obama admin's perceived mistakes in new talks.
@julianbarnes It wouldn't be the first time that's happened.
Dempsey: “This isn’t a divorce. It may feel that way," but US will continue to provide trainers.
McCain accuses admin of not being serious about negotiating deal. Panetta: "Senator McCain, that's just not true."
Panetta confirms that U.S. government attorneys insisted on parliamentary approval for a SOFA that contained immunity for US troops.
McCain notes that Dempsey/Panetta did not support the surge, says it affects how their judgments are perceived now.
Dempsey: "This has been a 20-year journey" in Iraq for senior military folks like him -- since Gulf War. Says US must stay involved.
Panetta said he and others pressured Iraq for deal but “the bottom line is this is not about us. ... It’s about what the Iraqis want to do.”
Panetta to Iran and US allies: "We have more than 40,000 American troops that remain in the Gulf region. We're not going anywhere."
Panetta says the Iraqis don't want to be dominated by Iran and won't allow it.
Panetta says Iraq will need help with external defense, and US will be there to assist.

Sen. Claire McCaskill wants "immediate investigation" of USAF IG over how agency probed allegations of mishandled remains at Dover mortuary.
SASC Chairman Levin opened the hearing by reminding everyone to remember that "these witnesses are part of our family.”
The NGB issue is a tough one for the Joint Chiefs -- they depend on the Guard and emotions run high as Guard members fight and die overseas.
The issue stems from concerns of those on the National Guard side that they are underrepresented when key military decisions are made.
The question of NGB representation on the Joint Chiefs has been a perennial post-9/11 proposal in Congress, but DOD has always opposed it.
Dempsey explains why he opposes making NGB chief a member of the Joint Chiefs. "There is no compelling military need to make this change."

McKeon says he's meeting with supercommittee member Sen. Jon Kyl later today to discuss defense spending.
McKeon says China's aggressive moves in South China Sea "very worrisome," links that to concerns over the shrinking Navy fleet.
McKeon on supercommittee trigger: "If enacted, the trigger would not just gut our military, it would close it for business."
McKeon notes that Marine F-18s and USAF F-15s have exceeded design life of their airframes, while F-35 replacements are on chopping block.
McKeon says recent DOD report on China "outlined a country that is emboldened with newfound military might and drunk with economic power."

Pace: The cost of having a strong military that prevents wars is less in the long run than the cost of inviting attack by weakness.
Smith: Americans "oppose every specific cut imaginable and then they support balancing the budget. We have to confront this inconsistency."
Smith says DOD supporters need to suggest ways of raising revenue to support defense spending, hits GOP leaders for saying no to this.
HASC ranking Dem Adam Smith says DOD budget is very vulnerable. "We're last in line at a buffet that is rapidly running out of food."

Levin on the M1: It made sense to keep minimal modernization ongoing to save money on closing costs, despite Army objection.
SASC bill reflects senators' concerns, puts DOD basing plan in Pacific on hold. Levin: current plan "not workable. It's unaffordable."
Levin: Bill bars funding for F136 engine, but issue remains open if contractor continues to self-fund development.
SASC bill would limit next JSF purchase to target price. Contractor must absorb any extra costs. Levin: "real change" in procurement.
The bill would "fully fund" $1.75 billion in reimbursements to Pakistan and other countries supporting coalition efforts in Afghanistan.
