Are the other 60 who say that they were wrong?
@Deplorable1Dan @BrianAHodges46 @BreitbartNews I don’t think there’s anything I can say that would convince you that that’s not true, but I don’t judge Trump’s words because they came from him. I judge them because they are ignorant, cruel, and selfish.
@14trump2016 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Truth is an interesting thing in the times in which we live. I want to say your Arpaio story is not a big deal because so many other people have confirmed that Obama was born in Hawaii. I just don’t trust him (an ex-con himself) over them
@AnnLittlemouse @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO The justice system does not have an “oh well, we all make mistakes” exception.		His “mistakes” are repeatedly breaking numerous laws. He should be prosecuted for these transgressions, and all patriotic Americans should want to see the rule of law adhered to.
@raysimm17240943 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO I hope so. I hope crooks everywhere are punished, no matter their party affiliation. The rule of law must prevail.
@14trump2016 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO One fact that supports that Trump is a con man: he settled the case against Trump university, admitting that his “university” was a fraud and stole money from customers, promising them that they would get rich, but instead offering nothing of actual value in return.
@raysimm17240943 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO He constantly pushes Russian objectives (hurting NATO, withdrawing troops from Syria, denying the results of American intelligence agencies, and now removing sanctions on Russian oligarchs). And he meets secretly with Putin and won’t even let his own cabinet know what was said

@14trump2016 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Also, while Trump is blatantly an incompetent con man (and probable traitor), I just want to say that, artistically, I love your banner art portraying him atop a heap of vibrant revolution a la Les Miserables. That’s a fun image.
@14trump2016 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Serious question. How can you know that it is I, and not you, who is the one being unwittingly used by powerful agents to further causes which do nothing to help us?
@AnnLittlemouse @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Thanks for the button. Half his election committee has already confessed to crimes. The full Mueller report is still forthcoming. Will you keep an open mind to it when it arrives? Or is Trump already innocent no matter what he does?

@areaman714 @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Trump wants to pull us out of NATO, withdraw troops from Syria, add Russia to the G8, and remove sanctions on top Russian oligarchs. His campaign manager gave sensitive polling data to more Russian oligarchs. He insists that all notes from his meetings with Putin be destroyed
@nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Yes you used this same response multiple times.
@Thomasrcherry @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Thanks for the condescension
@nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO Ok, and what if Mueller’s report comes back with something other than nada? Will you change your mind about Trump then? Can anything change your mind about him?
@Deplorable1Dan @BrianAHodges46 @BreitbartNews None of those other presidents refused to tell their cabinet what was discussed. None of them confiscated the notes of their translator — the only other American present — and swore them to secrecy. 		Seriously, how does behavior that suspicious not bother you?
@EASEmergency @nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO The cute part is you pretending that any evidence produced could actually change your mind about Trump
@Scottymcmahon22 @pbump Yeah, I guess it was just too complex for me to understand
@socialxparasite @Scottymcmahon22 @pbump I don’t care what he serves them. I do care about the claim that to be “objective” the media must feel compelled to occasionally report positive things about our vulgar embarrassment of a president. That’s not how reality works.
@nattiballerz @BreitbartNews @HBO I find Maher annoying for the same reason i find Breitbart intolerable, neither ever says anything surprising. That being said, Trump has, in fact, acted like a traitor and should be investigated for it.
@BrianAHodges46 @BreitbartNews He meets secretly and repeatedly with the president of Russia and won’t even let his own cabinet know what was said, but sure, total yawn. Nothing suspicious going on there.

@leahcimekim @GuthrieGF Right. Except if it’s dear leader and tax laws. Or dear leader’s children and perjury laws. Then a little law breaking is fine. Lying to Congress?!? Nbd!

@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 That’s just not true. I see stories on ocean pollution all the time. Since it’s “my news media” maybe you should trust me on this
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 Thanks for the condescension.
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 No. It’s much simpler than that. It’s because there is no evidence currently for global cooling.
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 Because unlike for those other 99% of times, I happen to be alive now
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 I looked at the evidence and came to the same conclusions independently. That being said, outside of the climate science, I don’t really like Al Gore — or most Democrats for that matter
@leahcimekim @pkcapitol Yes. So hysterical, as you can tell.
@leahcimekim @GuthrieGF If you can find Americans who are willing to work as pickers for 18 hours a day, for crushingly-low wages, then that is news to me.
@leahcimekim @Ocasio2018 The NY Times wrote an amazingly detailed and researched piece about this. You should check it out if you’re interested in seeing the evidence for yourself:		https://t.co/Mkv3YeTRNh
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 I mean I don’t think you’re paying attention. Lots and lots of people have tried to bring attention to the ocean pollution issue. That being said, I’m glad you agree it’s a problem we should work toward fixing
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 I have no political agenda. I call the evidence like I see it.

@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Solar energy is almost as cheap per joule as coal. Soon, it is likely to be much cheaper. Switching from fossil energies to renewable ones isn’t an action that hurts us in the short or long term
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim That’s correlation not causation. But you know what is causation? Atmospheric carbon dioxide causes a warming greenhouse effect.
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim It is not persuasive to me when you tell me about historical climactic extremes. I know the earth used to be different. I’ve never pretended it isn’t constantly changing. I’ve just said we shouldn’t spur on a change we’re not ready for.
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Sure. Humans are possibly not solely responsible for global warming. And so what? If we’re only 60% responsible, then should we throw up our hands and say, “oh well,  I hope our descendants can learn to live in the changing world. Fingers crossed.”
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim What they point out is that in spite of the Antarctica land ice growth, global sea levels are still rising, suggesting that, on the whole, ice mass is being lost not gained. It snowed this week in Chicago, too. That doesn’t mean the planet isn’t net warmer.
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Honestly, I used to believe that too: that humans were far too small to affect the climate of something as big as the earth. But the thing about humans is that there’s 7 billion of us. We can do a lot, for good and ill, when all our effort is pooled together.

@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Not that you would know this, but I have not flippantly dismissed the cyclical nature of global cooling. I just can’t find enough evidence to make me think it’s in any way presently occurring or about to occur.
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Sure. So please find me a team of scientists who believe global ice levels are increasing. I don’t take the absolutelness of that request lightly. I do not believe any such team exists.
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Some predictions will always be wrong. And maybe the temperatures won’t increase drastically (I hope they don’t) but no one disputes that this century has been unusually hot, and that global ice levels continue to decrease at alarming rates. I believe the threat is real.
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim I think you don’t fear them as much as you should
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim So put in a link for this search? Direct me where to go?
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Love this logic. “Someone said I was putting myself at greater risk by not wearing a seatbelt but I just drove to the store and didn’t get hurt at all so from now on I’m not going to worry about road safety ever again.”
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim Sure, like the Carboniferous period. And very little that’s alive today would be well-suited to survive then. The issue is not whether the earth, or “life” will survive with high-carbon levels. The issue is whether we, our crops, and our livestock will.
@leahcimekim @JohnFugelsang Technically, it’s satire. Not a lie if everyone understands it to be untrue
@leahcimekim @JamesMartinSJ Ok, where should they go to do it?
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim This is no current evidence of global cooling. Please find me some. I’m happy to consider it.

@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim C’mon, John. Spikes to 300. Maybe 310 tops. 400 is historically, untypically high for the course of human life on earth. You said yourself. Look at the data.

@leahcimekim @Ocasio2018 Vastly undervaluing your real estate to pretend it’s worth less than market rates is not “taking advantage of the laws.” It’s tax fraud.
@leahcimekim @PrinceAmukamara Hey. Those are my Bears you’re talking about. How dare you.
@leahcimekim @pkcapitol Love the Republican criticisms of intelligence because, as we know, Trump can almost read at a 3rd grade level.
@leahcimekim @GuthrieGF And we don’t give them one for free. They work dawn until dusk picking fruit so that you and I can eat cheap strawberries in December.
@leahcimekim @JohnFugelsang I think it’s a modified quote from the Bible actually. Remember when Republicans cared about religious faith? I do.
@leahcimekim @neiltyson It. Is. Not. Illegal. To. Apply. For. Asylum.
@leahcimekim @JamesMartinSJ Applying for asylum is legal under both US and international law. Remember when Republicans cared about laws and following them? I do.
@leahcimekim @Augusto75377253 Completely agree. This is discussed in another of our threads. Only problem with those high-carbon times is that they are usually preceded and followed by mass extinctions. Big temperature changes tend to kill off most of the life on earth. Not something I’m looking to repeat
@leahcimekim @jiveDurkey Albert Einstein was a refugee. Should we have kept that parasite out too?
@Augusto75377253 @leahcimekim The best part about this graph is that it never shows CO2 ppm going above 280 for the last half a million years. Yet, as you know, we’re above 400 ppm right now. If anything, this graph is proof of how much extra carbon humans have added into the air.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews I agree with you that the evidence shows that carbon levels have oscillated wildly over the last few billion years. I also believe the evidence that shows that major historical temperature swings have always been associated with mass extinctions. Not something I’m eager to repeat
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Please link me to one of those studies if you don’t mind
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Ice caps are not net growing. No one who studies ice caps thinks this. No one.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Yeah. I don’t believe it. That ice core data is just fabricated by corrupt ice core scientists so that they could get more ice core funding for themselves. 		Get it? I’m pretending to be like a climate change denier and only selectively believing in the science that I want to.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Maybe you’re right. Just out of curiosity, what would it take for you to believe that global warming is a risk? Will you believe when the entire northern ice sheet melts? When supermassive hurricanes destroy the southeast US? When all of California burns to the ground?
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews There is no evidence — anywhere — of global cooling. The 16 hottest years on record have all come in the last two decades.

@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews I don’t want to dismantle civilization. I like cars and indoor heating. But, historically, when the planet has undergone massive climate change before, it has been associated with massive species’ extinction. I don’t want my descendants living in a world where all our crops die.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews This is all true. That’s why nothing truly disastrous has happened yet, or is likely to in the near future. But emerging economies are just starting to burn as much fuel as we do. The global CO2 uptick is increasing. It’s our long-term future that is the worry.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Right. And .0004 doesn’t sound like much, until you realize that there are something like a trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion molecules of air in the atmosphere. So .0001 times that number of total molecules means that’s a LOT of extra CO2 up there to trap heat
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews What you’re saying would be true if the .0001 number were a percent increase. But it’s not. The percent increase is actually 33.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Maybe check your calculations. If atmospheric CO2 goes from 300 to 400 ppm, that’s a 33% increase (300 plus 1/3 of 300 = 400).		The .0001 increase is not a percent. It’s the increase in the number of CO2 molecules per million atmospheric molecules. Really. Look it up?
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews So the calculation you want is 1.09 x 10^44 times .0001 = 		Humans have added 1.09 x 10^40 molecules of carbon into the atmosphere.		Since the molecular weight of carbon is somewhat controversial, I’m not sure how many tons of carbon that works out to, but...it’s a lot.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Oh, I see what you’re doing. The ‘m’ in ppm. So you’re saying humans have only added .0001 molecules of carbon. That would be true if there were only 1 million air molecules in the atmosphere. As it happens there are closer to 1.09 x 10^44 molecules of air in the atmosphere.
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Sometimes I’m pretty good at math, actually. But what’s the 1,000,000 in this case? Where does that number come from? Why are we dividing 100 by it?
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Ha. That doesn’t look like a surrender to me. The article talks about the billions of tons of CO2 that humans produce annually. That means, for your earlier statement to be true, something on earth has to be producing trillions of CO2 tons annually. If not volcanoes, than what?

And while it may sound plausible, the science just doesn’t back it up.”		https://t.co/U2wjfQHDa7
@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews But you agree that CO2 makes the planet hotter? And you agree that burning oil/coal/wood release CO2 into the atmosphere?

@Augusto75377253 @kcathletics1955 @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews If you believe in this chart, then you should also believe that levels of atmospheric carbon cause higher temperatures. Do you also believe that burning fossil fuels increases the levels of atmospheric carbon? If so, then you agree the temperature increase is caused by man?
@ezio99414524 @BillOReilly I have no followers and receive no likes. I merely wish to point out how these poor refugees are not really a threat to us or our military. I reject the claim that tear gassing children was necessary for us to defend ourselves. Let them come and legally apply for asylum.
@Marie68186362 @BillOReilly Sympathy isn’t a card. It’s how we’re supposed to treat one another. I wouldn’t want to live in Mexico if I had a legitimate claim for asylum in the United States. Would you?
@bucaneropr @BreitbartNews That’s weird. Cause it comes right up in google searches.
@ezio99414524 @BillOReilly In that case, thank god our military was able to keep us safe from all from all those shoeless 4 year olds
@Marie68186362 @BillOReilly I was against it then too.
@ezio99414524 @BillOReilly Got it, so the women and children were a real dangerous threat and tear gassing them was our only method of self defense
@JonGrey4 @BillOReilly The funniest part is that while you’re so worried about George Soros magically stealing from you, the Republican Congress actually did exactly that with their tax cut for the rich
@Marie68186362 @BillOReilly So you’re saying we did throw tear gas at mothers and children, but some of it missed the target so nbd why is everyone so upset?
@BillOReilly Are you saying that toddlers weren’t tear gassed? Or that if they were it’s ok?
@bucaneropr @BreitbartNews Ok, don’t use the link. Go to NASA’s webpage yourself. The university to which you refer is CalTech. Where NASA’s jet propulsion lab is based.
@kkaugare @lestinskyjohn @BreitbartNews Sure. No one disputes that. Also, it being true doesn’t mean that carbon dioxide and methane don’t trap heat. What you say can be true, while at the same time, climate change is still primarily driven by human activity.

@composerchris Watching that defense is the most fun I’ve had on NFL Sundays in over a decade!
@composerchris I hope so. With that defense behind him, he really doesn’t have to worry about much.
@composerchris No worries. I have the same problem!
@composerchris Look, you can say he might improve, but you cannot say he’s been good so far. C’mon.
@composerchris Trubisky’s mistakes so far have been ones of accuracy, vision, and confidence. He misses guys deep, or doesn’t see them at all, and gladly takes the underneath throw, yards short of the first on 3rd down. Manning throw bullet interceptions to complex zone reads. Apples &amp; oranges.
@composerchris He choked as hard as it is possible to choke on that final drive, cuz. Go watch it again.
@composerchris I am in favor of making mistakes. Manning made plenty of them his first year. But they were different kinds of mistakes that what I’ve seen so far from Trubisky
@composerchris Saying that I’m “much less hopeful on him” is not “declaring him bad beyond all chance of recovery” like you seem to think I said. He’s an unknown. Obviously. Anything could happen. I hope he turns it around.
@composerchris I’m a little annoyed that I’m communicating my thoughts so poorly. Think of it this way. Trubisky’s future is like a roll of the dice. Will he be good, or bad? No one knows. But before GB, I was thinking he’d be a roll of a 9 or 10. After I think he’s likelier to roll a 4 or 5.
@composerchris Sure, but when is it Not too early to make a pronouncement. I’m seriously asking
@composerchris I haven’t paid attention to any of it.	Most fan takes are dumb and always have been. You know this!
@composerchris Serious question: 		What would it take for you to accept that Trubisky might be bad at football? If he goes the entire season with a sub 80 QB rating and never throws more td’s than int’s, will that make you question your devotion to him? If he does that for 3 straight years?

@composerchris But I have seen no healthy plants yet! There is no reason to think any of the crop will come through.		The point is that sometimes it’s wrong to start over, even when it doesn’t look good
@composerchris If I were a farmer, and I were trying to grow a successful crop of whatever, and the first few plants to emerge from the ground were all diseased, I would say, “this looks bad, I’m not optimistic.” However, I would not ‘give up’ and burn the field to the ground. Make sense?
@composerchris I could have won tonight with that defensive performance behind me.
@composerchris I think it’s called being realistic. What evidence do you have that he’s suddenly going to get better? None. Nada. Zip.	Still, it doesn’t mean I’m giving up on him. If he were hopeless, I’d scream for the Bears to sign Cutler or somebody. I’m not. I want to give Trubisky a chance
@composerchris I’m not giving up on Trubisky, but he’s trending in the wrong direction. At this point, any hope that he turns it around is just that: blind hope

@Locus_of_Ctrl @danielcincu @elonmusk The problem is that informed crowds do not seem to be able to make allowances for their uninformed-ness. This is why I think Elon’s plan is a bad one.
@Locus_of_Ctrl @danielcincu @elonmusk It depends on what is being evaluated. I trust a crowd of foreign correspondents to evaluate US foreign policy more than I trust a crowd of retired coal miners. I trust neither group to evaluate where I should go to lunch.
@Locus_of_Ctrl @danielcincu @elonmusk The media is itself a crowd
@Locus_of_Ctrl @danielcincu @elonmusk The idea that “the media” exists as some kind of singular, conspiratorial identity is an entirely Trumpian belief.  There are thousands of journalists, all of whom are individually motivated for different reasons. To say that “they” don’t want to hear something forgets this fact
@Locus_of_Ctrl @danielcincu @elonmusk This particular example makes it seem harmless to possess incorrect information. If angels aren’t real, and you believe in them anyway, then so what? Some falsehoods, however, are more dangerous than others. Anti-vaxer beliefs, for instance, cost lives

@johnwworth @SenSanders Read my later tweets in this thread. I have no interest in preserving the status quo.
@nuevosean @SenSanders 2) You cannot save American manufacturing jobs with protectionist trade policies anymore than you can save whaling jobs by outlawing oil. The way to save America workers is by embracing the changing economy, and provide better education to train workers for the jobs of tomorrow

@sid1453 @TPeterSullivan @BeTheCh59045196 @FoxNews Rome wouldn’t have been built at all if guys like Scott Pruitt were allowed to steal freely from the national treasury with no repercussions. The man should not be in the cabinet.
@Roxas_art @FoxNews He’s using our taxpayer dollars to give exorbitant salaries to his aides, travel first class, and maintain a 20 person security detail. You can be fine with him rolling back environmental regulations, but how can his corrupt self-dealing not bother you?
@sid1453 @TPeterSullivan @BeTheCh59045196 @FoxNews Trump literally ran on the platform of Draining The Swamp. He was supposed to be better than Obama. Remember? Is it so unreasonable to expect him to actually live up to that? To prevent selfish cabinet members from enriching their friends and over-spending on our dime?!?
@dubbleOkevin @Lisarexr @FoxNews I am not aware of any credible evidence to support this theory
@LucyAmerican1 @FoxNews I love this logic. Lots of GOP senators would not approve of me heading the EPA. (Mainly because I would actually try to prevent companies from polluting indiscriminately). I guess that means I would be doing a great job!
@juliaioffe Pictures of poisoned kids. And that the former was indiscriminate. I assume Trump thinks it’s “strong” to poison specific adult opposition members
@gracefullysouth @FoxNews Mental health is the real villain, not guns. Remember?
@gracefullysouth @FoxNews You are attributing logical thought to mass shooters. I think that’s a mistake. Crazy people do not carefully weigh the options of shooting up this place or that place. They just find a group they hate, and start pulling the trigger.
@FoxNews Since most mass shooters die during their attack anyway, this deterrent should be super effective

@campbell_trayce @JudicialWatch There are no talking points or forced narratives from others. There are only the beliefs I form myself when I listen to Trump speak. He is a conman and a narcissist.

@ustroopsfirst @JimMcM111 @BreitbartNews I agree completely that sick people are the ones who become shooters, and that if they cannot buy rifles, often they will make bombs, or use cars, etc. However, if we’re able to save just one life by making guns harder for crazy people to buy, then it’s worth fighting for.
@ustroopsfirst @JimMcM111 @BreitbartNews Your skepticism is prudent, but in this case I am telling the truth. He was in the Air Cav. Another thing about him is that he agrees with me that teenagers should not be able to buy assault rifles. Is that really such a horrible stance for the Parkland students to take?

@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy Thanks for taking time to talk about this with me. I think my ignorance stems just from having had good parents that would, and did, love me no matter what. It’s my default to assume that other parents are like that too. Not all are.
@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy She obviously did care. Right?
@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy I’m not trying to win an argument. I have no idea what it’s like to be disabled. However, I don’t think what you’re saying makes sense. If caregivers thought disabled lives were worth less, why would they give so much care in the first place? Like the grandmother in the story?
@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy I wasn’t aware that this was so common, but since it is, isn’t that further proof that people should be looking to understand what’s causing it? What do you think the reasons are for this pattern of murderous behavior?
@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy So what I’m saying is. This isn’t a story about the stresses of caregiving because the child was disabled. That’s the story because the murderer was so unusual
@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy What’s different here is that a grandmother was the killer. Most child-death incidents are caused by men, because, you know, they’re awful.

@robinmarceline @kayakendall @Imani_Barbarin @HannahPopsy These are very complicated, delicate issues.

@vaozman @BreitbartNews My point was that if you want to solve the drug crisis, you have to focus on reducing demand, not on restricting supply, because that’s been tried and tried, and it just doesn’t work
@vaozman @BreitbartNews Empirically, stiffer penalties for dealers has done nothing to reduce opiate suffering. Fewer dealers, along with high demand for the drugs, just means that those who remain make larger and larger amounts of money dealing, which in turn, draws more people to the profession.

@latebloomer_46 @EstrellaRoxane @BreitbartNews I was raised very Christian. The part I remember most is that Jesus forgives but you have to be willing to come to him and ask for that forgiveness.

@PALanghals @BreitbartNews No. Liberal America is not brainwashing every other country on earth. As if they had that much power and influence...		The reason to make fun of Trump is because it’s so easy. He lies constantly, is clueless about how anything works, and refuses to ever admit to any mistakes.
@AlbertBlazer @BreitbartNews This pretty much sums up all Trump supporters. “I don’t care if he’s stupid, corrupt, adulterous, traitorous, and an embarrassment to the country. I’ll never stop supporting him.” That kind of unquestioned support is insane.

Yes, I really believe that. There’s a lot data to back it up.
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Two things. First of all, I appreciate you citing a reliable source, although, this article only describes correlation, not causation. Second of all, I’m not a liberal either. I don’t like most democrats. I supported Obama Because I believe in globalistic ideals like free trade
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I don’t know a single person outside of Fox News who says that Obama set back race relations. You live in an isolated bubble. You call anyone who tries to contact you from outside this bubble a “typical liberal.” You believe you see through to the truth of everything, but don’t.
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Dude just because you’re afraid black people are coming to get you, because you would fight them if you could, does not mean that they are. Your world is small and hateful, and I’m glad I don’t have to live it it. If I did, I would be as miserable and paranoid as you
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump It is not a “fact” that Obama blamed white people for Trayvon’s death. That is your emotional response. As for whatever some portrait painter did in other work, that’s pretty irrelevant to what Obama thinks. I’m sure Trump’s employed people who’ve done some awful things too.
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I could just as easily accuse you of seeing through negative-tinted glasses! You see ill intentions on Obama’s part, and I never have. How do you know I’m wrong and you’re right? Isn’t it possible you perceive him to be against us when he’s actually not?
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I could just as easily accuse you of not paying attention during his presidency. That his attacks on you were all imagined. Which one of us has the greater claim to reality?
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I am not, in fact, the supreme white person that speaks for everyone. Are you? You seem pretty sure all/most white people felt like Obama was blaming them for Trayvon’s death. Or ridiculing them over beer. I never felt that way. Lots of other white people didn’t either.
@MichaelCarusi Sure. It’s annoying. But it’s not really a back-stabbing.
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump I am a white person, and I say to you with complete honesty, I never, ever felt like anyone was vilifying myself or my race when Trayvon was shot. So, no, I can’t comprehend what you mean, because I never felt it.
@MichaelCarusi This seems like an excessive metaphor. If I assume that a Trump voter wants to be a good person, when in fact they do not, to what kind of actual back-stabbing do I expose myself? None of them can hurt me any more than by continuing to vote for an egomaniacal traitor?
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Wait a minute, I’m genuinely curious how him saying “if I had a son, he would look like Trayvon” is racially divisive? It was a factual statement? And what does it matter at all to anyone what his hypothetical son would look like?
@OnlyNeedTruth @RaphaelHayes210 @resistanceFtrs @FoxNews Hey, just want you to know that because you’re openly supporting a traitor to America, that kind of makes you one too. Russia’s thrilled at how easy it was to trick you to help them, though
@dominy_carol @MasterMorgan317 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump You’re much likelier to get killed/hit by a bullet in many other towns across the country than you are in Chicago
@Plnstay1 @MasterMorgan317 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump The stock market tripled during his presidency. Unemployment was cut in half. How did the country suffer economically?
@doNtdumbd0wn @MasterMorgan317 @drsdad42 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump This is what racism sounds like. Also, no. Obama was extremely articulate, nuanced in his positions, and generous in his actions. Trump has the vocabulary of a 4th grader, the temperament of a toddler, and cares only for himself. I would hate him in any color.
@Ganulvian @MasterMorgan317 @ItsMystery007 @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Actually, those are Trump voters you’re thinking of. Low levels of education were the greatest single factor in a person’s decision to vote for Trump.		https://t.co/5xynxvlVcb

@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN @realDonaldTrump What I will say is that you seem to support Trump for the right reasons. I don’t believe he’s a charitable man, but if you do, that’s a better reason to like him than because of all the awful things he says about women/minorities/immigrants/foreigners/etc...
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN @realDonaldTrump That’s great. It was only once, 27 years ago, but it’s still great.
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN @realDonaldTrump Again, I would love to believe that’s true, but I can see no evidence to support your claim
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN @realDonaldTrump That’s great. If he did stuff like that more often, I would support him. Unfortunately not usually the case:		https://t.co/5FEt9twdjX		“Donald Trump says he gives away millions through his foundation, but an analysis finds that he hasn’t put up any of his own money since 2008.”
@Fireblyss @LItalianoVero @CNN Haha. It’s not wasted energy. It’s venting! I have to get the political frustration out of my system so that I can be productive the rest of the day. Twitter therapy sessions?
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN I know you’ll never see him for the awful human that he is, but just know this. I’ve never cared about politics before. I don’t even like most democrats. But this is too much. I can only watch that ignorant buffoon hurt the country I love for so long. I will never not vote again
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN The truth is, he doesn’t care about Nazi’s just like he doesn’t care about anything but himself. So he couldn’t bring himself to insult people who he knew had voted for him. In his mind, allegiance to Trump is a person’s most important character trait. Cronyism at its best
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN If you think Trump gives two shits about you or your interests, then I have swamp land in Siberia to sell you. He’s literally made a living defrauding people. How can that not bother you? I know you want libs to be upset, but he never has worked to help anyone but himself. Ever.
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN Dude. I heard him call a group of Nazi’s “some very fine people” with my own ears. My dislike of Trump does not stem from external propaganda. It comes from every time he opens his mouth
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN Your president believes Nazis are good people and the rest of the world is a shithole. But please, lecture others on the vices of hatred and bigotry
@BarryBahrami @AlohaTimAloha @BreitbartNews Parkland shooter was Trump supporter, but, hey, pesky facts
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN I understand where she’s coming from. It’s hard not to be outraged that our president is an adulterous traitor. But hey, I guess if that doesn’t bother you at all, congrats
@redelephant1950 @CNN That’s not what they did. Most of Russia’s propaganda efforts, as described in the latest indictment, were not attempting to change votes. They were focused on reducing votes for Hillary, suppressing her turnout, and getting more support for 3rd party candidates like Jill Stein
@LItalianoVero @Fireblyss @CNN “Many sanctions on both sides...” No. This is laughable. Trump is not secretly punishing Russia in ways the media won’t talk about. He’s actively not punishing Russia against the will of Congress. He’s making it really hard for me to believe he’s not a traitor to US interests
@FoxNewsResearch Fake news! This data is just a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.

@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews I would love to live in the world where families can thrive on one parental income. Unfortunately, Paul Ryan seems intent on making this more impossible than ever by strengthening corporations, reducing labor’s bargaining power, and cutting contributions to the social safety nets
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews No, I’m genuinely asking. Why is America different? What do we need to change to be more like the rest of the world so our kids can stop being murdered?
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews Ok. Here’s my question. Since you believe that US gun ownership has no correlation with US gun violence, then why is it that America has so many more mass shootings than every other rich, developed nation in the world? What makes us so different from Germany, or Spain, or...
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews Yes, I’ve heard this argument 1000 times. There is no data to back it up. In rich counties where guns are rare, civilian gun deaths and mass shootings are extremely rare. I know it doesn’t make sense, but it’s the way things are
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews You realize the enormous irony of you warning me about the next Hitler uprising, don’t you? There’s only one president currently demonizing and rounding up minority groups. He says we just have to get rid of them all, so our jobs will come back, and our country can be great again
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews You are not responding to what I’m saying
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews Police are who protect all of the things on your list. No one is saying we should disarm police. For all your eagerness to call me dumb, you are missing the point.
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews The government has nuclear submarines and predator drones. So you’re saying civilians should be able to own those too? That’s insanity. You do not want American citizens to be able to easily purchase those kinds of destructive weapons. I don’t believe you.
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews And here is my point to you: in countries with fewer guns, there are fewer gun deaths. Innocent children have died, and in the future will die, because American civilians own so many guns, and they are so easy to obtain. These are children that don’t have to die.
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews As for as Chris’ short bus meme, cool joke. Because of people like you, who refuse to take America’s gun problem seriously, more innocent children are going to die
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews Yeah, I love quoting bible versus. Like Matthew 26:52
@glennmartin @theoldlabrat @BreitbartNews https://t.co/XTUlkehQZz

@perfectmuzzle Same goes for guns and everything else. It’s just about arguing and not giving any ground. It has nothing at all to do with facts or desirous outcomes or consequences. A million more kids could die, and they’d still want mentally-disturbed teenagers to be able to buy AR15’s
@perfectmuzzle It’s not about freedom. They think it’s all a test of their faith. They don’t feel free. They feel under siege. So, the only response is to dig in their heels and continue supporting an adulterous, morally-bankrupt blotard, just because he’s on their “team”

@SlickWillyPOTUS @TomMillze @FoxNews @BarackObama If you think there’s some kind of “got you” here, you’re delusional. Obama was willing to enforce sanctions against Russia. Trump isn’t.

@TFlottemesch @SarahBurris I get that you’re wanting to win an argument here, but I don’t know what you’re trying to say. My point is that, on the whole, immigration is a net economic-positive for America. We should encourage more of it. Are you trying to disagree with that?
@TFlottemesch @SarahBurris On this issue, it’s almost all cherry-picking. No one can calculate with precision the true cost of undocumented immigrants because their work is...undocumented. The study I quoted looks at a larger sample because, on that scale, we can draw definitive conclusions
@Purp_and_gold_ @andreathekline @SarahBurris However, if you want to provide credible statistics from a non-overtly racist group, then I’m more than happy to consider that new information and change my opinion
@Purp_and_gold_ @andreathekline @SarahBurris I dispute the authenticity of your source. 		“The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) is an anti-immigrant organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center has called a hate group since 2008 because of its virulent and false attacks on non-white immigrants.”

@maryav777 @TC10pen @SarahBurris From the Congressional Budget Office: 		"in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use."

@Hermesinito @SarahBurris I’m sure it won’t matter to point this fact out to you, but this is from the Congressional Budget Office:	"in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use."
@FoxNews @TomFitton @FBI Hmmm. I don’t know. Maybe because Obama didn’t collude with a foreign power to win an election?
This is horrifying. Not just that Trump has found more electoral support in 2018, or that voters are ignoring the huge amount of new debt brought on by the tax plan, but that people can be so easily manipulated by loud, brainless propaganda https://t.co/MGagmOsLWq

@realTinFingers @AlavazJ @facttrumpstrump @realDonaldTrump @GOP I see. So these two low level employees have missing texts and that means that Trump isn’t an ignorant embarrassment who spends all his time golfing or tweeting out blatantly false lies?
@realTinFingers @AlavazJ @facttrumpstrump @realDonaldTrump @GOP I have no idea what you’re talking about.
@ProfEmilyOster @dimi_paris Sure. Sleep’s immensely important. Another thought is that a lot of the epigenetic effects from in-utero starvation-episodes don’t manifest themselves for decades. I’m not saying sleep training harms kids, but we need longer longitudinal studies to know for sure
@ProfEmilyOster @dimi_paris Can we agree that forms of social isolation are bad for childhood development? That has been definitively proven. Brains need stimulation to grow. So, sleep training is a form of social isolation. Maybe the effect is very mild, or microscopic. But there is probably an effect.
@ProfEmilyOster @dimi_paris No offense taken. Skepticism first. The matter is clearly uncertain. No studies have “proven” sleep training to be definitively safe or dangerous — neurological development being the complicated thing that it is. My paternal instinct says cry-it-out feels wrong, though
@ProfEmilyOster @dimi_paris I’m not able to view the full text for this paper, but I would be very interested to know what tests they use to determine healthy psychosocial functioning. Also would like to see a study longer than 5 years, and with more participants. After that I could be persuaded.

Shared government exists because people cannot be trusted
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly Lots of things in life would be better if people were different, smarter, and more thoughtful. But they’re not. Pragmatism not idealism. We have to create policies for how people are, how they really act, and not how we wish they would
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly Democrats like me want it legal not because we support the killing of babies, but because we want safety for the mothers who are going to give themselves an abortion one way or the other. It’s pragmatism, not idealism. Young mothers die in botched surgeries when it stays illegal
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly One final thought I had while I was sleeping...about abortion. You should remember that no one wants to have an abortion. No one starts out saying, I can’t wait to have an abortion later this year. But sometimes things happen, and it becomes the least bad of many bad options
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly I feel the same way. Civility appears dead in national politics, so it was nice to have it here in our one small corner of the internet
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly I have no firsthand experience with BLM, but I believe the point is to help prevent police from shooting unarmed black men who pose no real threat.

@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly You should not judge all members of BLM by the actions of a few, just like they should not assume all white people to be as hateful and awful as Dylann Roof. White people also sometimes kill police. That does not mean all white people support killing police

@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly Knowing nothing about it, I very seriously doubt that Wright’s church advocates white genocide. However, even if it did, as you have said, that doesn’t mean that Obama believes the same things

@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly The fun part about conspiracy theories is that they can never be disproven. There’s nothing I can say to persuade you that Obama’s intention was to help people, not to institute white genocide. Regardless, I want you to know that as a real American I think that viewpoint is crazy
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly Charlie was deemed medically brain-dead, as I recall. There was only his body’s shell left to save.

@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly A government power grab to what end? This is wacky. Obama has nothing to gain by using an individual mandate to help poor families afford healthcare. And premiums would not have skyrocketed if R’s would have allowed a single-payer. But they fought it every step of the way
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly I am no expert on Papal Infallibility so perhaps you’re right about there not being a contradiction. However, I don’t see how it’s harming our own children to let DACA kids who grew up in America continue to grow up here. They just want to serve in the military and attend college
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly Secondly, the pope has repeatedly disagreed with Trump and Republicans and said that we should be kinder to immigrants, refugees, and the poor. Usually Fox News viewers call him a false prophet. Either way, we cannot both believe in the Catholic Church and discount its leader
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly Several things here. First of all, all US children do Not have healthcare. Obamacare tried to make that happen, and the GOP has struggled mightily to prevent that from happening. The GOP clearly wants only people who can afford healthcare to have healthcare.
@timedimereviews @PilferYourHeart @BillOReilly I agree harming innocent children is evil. But from my perspective, it is the GOP that refuses to fund children’s healthcare, give support to single mothers, and provide decent, affordable education to everyone who wants it. I wish the R’s commitment to kids didn’t end at birth

@DesertLover46 @IngrahamAngle Golf trips which benefit his Trump resorts. Taxpayers are paying every weekend for golf carts and rooms at Mar-A-Lago. These costs, which is money that goes to Trump, greatly exceed his forfeited salary
@DesertLover46 @IngrahamAngle Obama wrote multiple best-selling books. You could argue that’s using the celebrity of the presidency. If he enriched himself beyond that, then I want him held accountable. Trump has foreign dignitaries stay at his hotel, and has cost the country millions with his golf trips
@DesertLover46 @IngrahamAngle Drop the talking points for a second. Do you really believe Trump is not trying to enrich himself, given that he’s always looked out for number one first in everything he’s ever done and believes the entire measure of a man is the size of his bank account?
@DesertLover46 @IngrahamAngle Ironically, icebergs can themselves be formed, over long periods of time, by bunches of individual snowflakes. More importantly, those of us who want Trump to be held accountable for his using the office of the presidency to enrich himself are not snowflakes. We’re citizens
@mosfoodographer @IngrahamAngle This seems a little extreme. What happened to not throwing large groups of people together and judging them all for the sins of one of the group’s members?
@iamjasonbailey @IngrahamAngle This seems a little close minded. Shouldn’t we listen to people even if we disagree with them?
@DesertLover46 @IngrahamAngle This is a great analogy. Trump supporters are like icebergs.

@FinleyRusch @ChanterCin @FoxNews This law doesn’t “change the world.” A small amount of people have always felt that their gender identity did not match either of the two primary genders. The only thing that’s changing is that we’re letting those X people have the personal freedom to be who the really are

@HistorsEye @Thirsty_Grunt @realDonaldTrump It’s almost like some of these continually re-posted online memes aren’t very well thought out...
@composerchris Hahahahaha. Hahahahahahahahah. Hahahahahaha. Haha.
@composerchris Whoa. That’s one of the best 2 point conversion plays I’ve ever seen.
@composerchris Ha! Put Pat O’Donnell in! Best QBR of any #Bears QB this season!
@composerchris That’s not fair if the Vikings are allowed to play with a non-injured QB! Put Bradford back in!
@composerchris Trubisky needs to see that blitz and audible his protection. Classic rookie move!
@composerchris Hahah. Should have still gone for it on 4th and 6. Congratulations on the 25 yard punt
@composerchris Fox!!!!!
Be still my beating heart. Nice first drive, #Trubisky !
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 There is no capitulation. But there is forgiveness for those who would choose to say they made a mistake. Which is what Teri did
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 I’m sorry we disagree. This is my official stance on the subject:   	https://t.co/SchQwCos4Y
@Courage20172112 Ha. You are right. I would rephrase that if I could. And people say no one listens on Twitter!
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 When we lose our principles, then what separates us from them?
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 Your hate will cause more people to spitefully vote against rational, liberal policies. What’s more important? Your anger? Or progress?
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 The animosity you feel is part of what made it so easy for Trump to rally tens of millions to his side. Because those people felt condemned
@MichaelCarusi @Courage20172112 @terilynsanders I hate Trump probably more than you do. But you do not get rid of him by continuing to push an us vs them narrative. That plays to his hand
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 Have you never been taken in by a scam artist? Never done anything about which you’re ashamed and wish you could do differently? Really?
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 Then we will forever be locked in a partisan struggle with wounds on both sides that never heal. We have to come together. And forgive.
@Courage20172112 Trump is awful. But we must not condemn everyone who wanted to believe in his “promises” of bringing change to Washington
@MichaelCarusi @terilynsanders @Courage20172112 Teri’s initial point remains true. Forgiving our enemies is hard, always, but not forgiving poisons us, the judgmental, from the inside
