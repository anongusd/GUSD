@newyorkjew Deedra Abboud was a Democratic candidate for Senate. She lost to Kyrsten Sinema.
@rainmakr56 C'mon, I didn't mean EVERYONE!
@OneJerseySchorr For what?
@rainmakr56 ü§£ü§£ü§£
@rainmakr56 Since when was I depressed or anything? I said it's disheartening, and I'm not saying this as a political statement:	Joe Arpaio is the face of pure evil.
@rainmakr56 @BobHugin @SenatorMenendez Problem is he won't win. Menendez will be less popular than most statewide Dems due to his trial last year, but he will win at least 55% of the vote.
Not that I'm a fan of Martha McSally. But she beat Joe Arpaio in his own county!
So disheartening that tens of thousands of people voted for Joe Arpaio.
@abcnews When do the Arizona returns come in? #AskABCNews
I hope Joe Arpaio wins the Senate primary in Arizona. That's practically handing the seat to Deedra Abboudd!
He won!
.@nytimes Just project Andrew Gillum as the winner of the #FLGov Democratic primary! I know it's narrow, but he won!
The people of Florida are sick and tired of Rick Scott. Ron DeSantis is a carbon copy. Vote Andrew Gillum on November 6!
@itsalmostElul LOL
I knew Andrew Gillum would win! And it looks like he will!
Andrew Gillum is leading 4146 votes in #FLGov! Can't wait to see him crush Ron DeSantis on November 6!
Andrew Gillum is creeping towards the lead in #FLGov. Earlier he was 55k votes behind, now he's 25k votes behind. #VictoryAhead
Congratulations, Ron DeSantis &amp; Rick Scott. Can't wait to see Andrew Gillum &amp; Bill Nelson crush you in November!
Fingers crossed for Andrew Gillum.

@OneJerseySchorr I hope not. I don't want to have to wait 4 months for election results. Especially not in NJ. Considering Menendez's unpopularity due to his trial, it'll be very narrow, but Hugin will probably win around 45% and demand a recount.
@OneJerseySchorr I wonder if any states will be like Minnesota's Senate race in 2008...
@OneJerseySchorr I'm not going to sleep until they call the statewide races in every state, without exception. Unless I know that it'll be like last night, with no winner declared right away.
Why do I keep seeing this tweet constantly promoted? https://t.co/nL4lg0XXmg
@OneJerseySchorr I used to be, going to sleep early, then waking up for primaries across the country earlier this year. Then they started having two in the same night, three hours apart, and I just stayed up for the earlier one only. I'll probably be up till 3 AM on Election Day :-)
@newyorkjew Which one?
@OneJerseySchorr I knew Cantwell would win anyway. I don't stay up when there's an incumbent running in the primary.
@newyorkjew No way to know until you hear them.
@newyorkjew How does anyone know they actually exist?
@newyorkjew Why not?
@OneJerseySchorr Last night I was waiting for a winner. Gave up at 10 knowing there would be none for quite a while.
Is there anywhere that I can hear the Omarosa tapes for myself?
@OneJerseySchorr @stevenmnuchin1 And I probably wouldn't trust Mattis except as a last resort. I don't know him!
@OneJerseySchorr Not really. I'm basing it on who I know to be an honorable person, and Mattis is the first. And he's #6. I'll put it this way:	Would you trust "Foreclosure King" @stevenmnuchin1, #5, with your wallet? I wouldn't.
@jasonroeder Imagine the foreclosure king, @stevenmnuchin1, number 5, giving back all the money? Impossible!
@OneJerseySchorr They're officially going to be finishing counting the provisional ballots within ten days. Then you have to wait for the Ohio Secretary of State to certify it, and then until Paul Ryan finally swears in the winner. The winner will only have 3 1/2 months in this term.

@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews No. Millions of people simply can't find a job. But when it's an entire community, which is a top beneficiary, something is majorly wrong.
@jamesfree25 @AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews Im not a hater.

@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews So explain why so many graduates end up unable to get hired due to their poor English skills, and why so many are on social programs, especially Section 8.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews If I were in the NY State Senate, I would introduce a bill to expel Felder.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews Not at all. That's exactly what i assumed.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews What's going on right now in hassidic yeshivas is the definition of educational malpractice.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews The Felder bill is a violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution. A part of freedom of religion is not favoring one religion over another. By expemting only Hassidic yeshivas, it's a violation.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews Not at all. I may have misunderstood what you said. Just get to the point and define it.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews I tried, it claims that I didn't fill something out on the form, although I did.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews So define it.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews Come on, do you think they'll give it to me?
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews That depends on how you define it.

@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews Where can I find your district map? 	And talking about your political career is not making it personal. Making it personal is if I attack something that you do in your private life. What you do as a legislator is not personal.
@grouchd @Dennis_Kucinich I did that. There's a reason I asked.
@rainmakr56 @GovMurphy @GovMalloyOffice Tennessee and Oregon, a deep-red and dark-blue state, both have free community college. They're managing just fine!
@rainmakr56 @GovMurphy And no, your taxes won't neccesarily be raised. The state has several billion dollars which it got in student loan interests, enough to fund community colleges for at least half a century!
@rainmakr56 @GovMurphy The state legislature creates such programs. Under Christie, 2/3 of the seats in both chambers were held by Dems. The program could have also been passed under Christie whether he liked it or not, so don't blame it on Murphy.
@AronWieder @yaffedorg @NYSEDNews Why do you oppose fair education?	Because if the students are educated, they think for themselves, and vote you out.

@MaryLedbetter4 @Learning2GetBy @realDonaldTrump I'm not familiar with it.
@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico That wasn't the only thing he tried to get her on. You saw the Comey memo in October 2016 (note: Comey is a Repug), which very likely lost her upwards of a million votes, and she wasn't able to be indicted.
@MaryLedbetter4 @Learning2GetBy @realDonaldTrump What do you watch?
@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico Well, he tried for years. You saw how that turned out; it ruined his political career.
@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico What about someone like Trey Gowdy?
@SensiblCentrist @NYGovCuomo I live in NJ, I'm familiar with that.
@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico No; I meant define some prominent politicians who are members of the swamp.
@4YrsToday @realDonaldTrump Yes, I live on the same planet. Other than that, I don't think so.
@brycetache @realDonaldTrump Which one was this?
@SensiblCentrist @NYGovCuomo I personally don't care, although I prefer a special election to fill the seat for a few months.
@ThePoliticsZone Joe Donnelly was elected very narrowly due to his opponent's corruption charges.

@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico The definition of the swamp varies. Please define it for me.
@SensiblCentrist @NYGovCuomo They are partially represented; their offices stay open, and you can get the same services whether the seat is vacant or filled. They just don't have a Rep to vote. I personally don't care, as I don't live in NY-25. Do you?
@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico Answer the previous question:	If she's been investigated for nearly two decades, entirely by Repugs, why hasn't she been indicted yet?
@ThePoliticsZone And party leadership does not endorse it at all.
@ThePoliticsZone And if you look at the roll call (https://t.co/zJAPCvIfGf), you'll notice that most of them are red/purple state Dems who are up for reelection either this year or in two years, and want to do what their (Republican) constituents want.

@TrumpJew @TomFitton @politico So why aren't you complaning that too much money is being wasted on investigations into HRC when she has been investigated by Repugs for nearly two decades and hasn't been indicted yet?
@SensiblCentrist @NYGovCuomo Or maybe there'll be no special election, as there are already candidates for the seat for when her term would expire. Most likely it'll stay vacant until November.
@woodringgma @FoxNews @Tazmajick Agreed. But are you referring to an age or amount of time served? If it were up to me, there would be no age at which they must retire, so long as they are stable.
