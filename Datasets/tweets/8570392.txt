These are just a handful of stories and issues the @Crosscut team produced this week. If you'd like to see more, please consider subscribing to our amazing newsletters: https://t.co/ARU7glAlEX  /10
Reporter @AguedaPachecOH produced a lively profile of Seattle hip hop artist @Solzilla, who reveals among other things, influences for his latest album, the state of Seattle hip hop and how he feels about being compared with @macklemore.  		https://t.co/Zwh3CpOBt7  /9
From growing up in the very segregated South and 'sundown towns' to now leading cutting edge research focused on fossil-fuel infrastructure. The second 'I AM STEM' profile features Tarika Powell from the Sightline Institute. Story by @mmsecaira. 		https://t.co/9riZiKmiIs  /8
The first profile from 'I AM STEM' introduces us to Eric Nealy, a graduate student researcher focusing on brain cancer at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Story by @LizBrazile with photos by @dorothy_edwards.		https://t.co/DI9pvRW72c  /7
Perhaps my favorite reporting we did at @Crosscut this week was to begin a new series focusing on 'unique and diverse origin stories' of inspiring individuals working in STEM-related fields in the PNW. The first two profile pieces are so so good.  /6
Our governor also made news this week. Rather than focus on Gov. Inslee's big announcement and more on what he had to say -- @MelissaSantos1 focused smart analysis on the central issues and Inslee's chances, according to leading experts and polling data https://t.co/ZSH6L214dU /5
We followed up with smart context and perspective with this reflection piece from @KnuteBerger, who spent 16 years with @seattleweekly, and is so adept at bringing relevance and authentic understanding into his storytelling.		https://t.co/EtA05JjtpR  /4
Later in the week David and @dorothy_edwards accompanied one of the paper's carriers on his final route. It was a great example of looking beyond only the journalistic implications of a community when newsrooms shutter. 		https://t.co/CCoec9WC8b  /3
The week began with the @KromanDavid scoop of an iconic local news brand ending a 40-year run of Seattle and Washington state coverage.		https://t.co/nUfO9MbniZ  /2
Reflecting on my first full week at Cascade Public Media. Specifically thinking about some of the terrific digital journalism the @Crosscut team has published in recent days. Literally pinching myself for lucking out with this opportunity to help lead this news organization.  /1

Alrighty #EIJChat pals, time for our final question and answer‚Ä¶ alas, do not be sad, we have #EIJ17 coming up in just a few months! https://t.co/moqKyDrAOI
A9. Nowadays everyone w/ a smartphone and Wi-Fi is a broadcaster. Important to consider how to filter the relevant signals. #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A9. Journos are fostering strong engagement for using live streaming from breaking news, weather coverage, elections, more #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A9. Live streaming can provide: immediacy, unique perspective, social connection and surprise/anticipation #EIJ17 #EIJChat
#EIJChat #mojo https://t.co/xjZTyJ1XKA
A9. Great to see newsrooms of all size and scale experimenting with live streaming. It‚Äôs been a game changer for some. #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A9. Live video has exploded in recent years. People consume more than 100M hours of video on Facebook everyday. #EIJ17 #EIJChat
Q9: Live streaming in newsrooms has really taken off in the past few years. How do you use? What are your best tips? #EIJChat #EIJ17
Exactly! Determine your strategy and goals first, then move forward with smart execution. https://t.co/4sGRXoo6y5
A8. I have a system where I bookmark articles re: new journalism apps over time, then catch up over a long weekend #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A8. We‚Äôve all been burned by tools we adore and use all the time, only to see them suddenly shutdown. Pretty frustrating. #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A8. I prefer to be aware of new web tools, but tend to not move all-in until they‚Äôve had time to settle in, mature a bit #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A8. There‚Äôs a lot of pressure to try new apps all the time. Especially when colleagues are constantly pushing the latest. #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A8. First off: Trends &gt; Tools. Try avoid getting hung up on tools, instead focus on smart solutions to growing challenges #EIJ17 #EIJChat
Q8: Seems like new 'can‚Äôt miss' tools/apps pop up every week. How do you decide what to invest your valuable time on? #EIJChat #EIJ17

A6. Being active and engaged on social platforms is a great way to stay plugged into new trends. Follow the breadcrumbs! #EIJ17 #EIJChat
A6. Following tech is like picking up bread crumbs; new resources, blogs, apps, etc. often lead to next piece of insight #EIJChat #EIJ17
Q6: What tips do you have for keeping up with emerging tech trends and news applications? #EIJChat #EIJ17

@Reuters A5. First off, most of us stand to become better listeners. Social isn‚Äôt just about broadcasting. Listen to community! #EIJChat #EIJ17
Q5: @Reuters 2017 Digital News Report: Using social media diversifies your news diet. Can sm help to tell diverse stories? #EIJChat #EIJ17
RT @annaxgabriela: @ToTheVictor A4: I try to follow both sides of things on social media.
A4. Of course tech can provide options - for example there‚Äôs Chrome extension ‚ÄúEscape Your Bubble‚Äù https://t.co/3nkzhSuhkl #EIJChat #EIJ17
A4. Latch onto credible and dynamic resources that promote diversity and inclusion ‚Äî podcasts, newsletters, online chats #EIJChat #EIJ17
A4. Making a deliberate effort to find and follow new voices on SM is one of the effective ways to stretch your boundaries #EIJChat #EIJ17
Q4: How do you ensure you get yourself outside your own filter bubbles? #EIJChat #EIJ17
1000% agree. Huge challenge! #EIJChat https://t.co/xplic3Xn55
Ready for next question, #EIJChat friends? #EIJ17 ü§î
A3. Critical verification steps and practices are also growing more complex (and messy) because of the firehose of info #EIJChat #EIJ17
A3. Finding important clues inside massive digital haystacks of information ‚Äî while under deadline ‚Äî is a huge challenge #EIJChat #EIJ17

A3. Noise-to-signal ratio! Journos now forced to sift through mass amounts of data on our screens to find relevant leads #EIJChat #EIJ17
Q3: What do you think are some of the most challenging situations are for journalists as far as finding sources via social? #EIJChat #EIJ17

One of great challenges for journos today is onslaught of incoming signals, notifications, alerts, emails and other bits of noise #journcamp
Key ingredients necessary to analyzing a developing news event: time, location, context. W/o these, you're not getting full pic. #journcamp
What if we could turn laptops into drones? Essentially possessing 'eyes in the sky' capabilities for instant access to hotpots. #journcamp
With 350K tweets posted every min, how can journos manage the firehose of info to filter out clutter? https://t.co/w9fLar1Psb #journcamp https://t.co/LkKTG3luj4
Why real-time is so important:	- editorial intelligence	- mobilize staff	- impacts to coverage	- speed to publish/broadcast 		#journcamp
Important distinction as we get moving, real-time web enables good reporting, it doesn't replace it. #journcamp https://t.co/9OxXUzNCvP
We live in an auto-refresh world. No one wants to have to check sources periodically for updates. #journcamp
Real-time web is using tech and practices that enable users to receive info as soon as published by its authors. #journcamp
Link to @amywebb post from #ONA16 on 10 tech trends journos need to be paying close attention to: https://t.co/0gLwO47O6G #journcamp https://t.co/ST7PKppgkf
Important acknowledgement from the #journcamp cockpit: trends more important than tools. Need to consider what probs trends can solve.
