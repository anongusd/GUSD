Romney emphasizes religion as critical to his character. Do you think Obama will, does it matter? #keanosu
Barry King was labeled as an “uncommitted voter.” I don't even know what an uncommitted voter is, changing language #keanosu
I didn't think Romney would agree "The presidents characterization of my plan is completely false” #keanosu
both want to lower corporate tax rate. Obama wants to close company loopholes, Romn wants to expand breaks	#keanosu does Romney agree?
Romney: I want to make America the most attractive place in the world for entrepreneurs . not trickle down govt #keanosu

Romney takes hard stance on immigration "We welcome legal immigrants...I will not grant amnesty to those who come here illegally" #keanosu
Romney points back to Reagan, surly this cannot be the only successful conservative presidency. #keanosu
@patterac Yay it was for Obama, but if he becomes president it would be good to know #keanosu
Obama said Romney ≠ Bush because he is focusing on social policy. This doesn't sound right to me, what do you think? #keanosu
Romeny does not eual Bush because he wants "more trade," to balance the buget" and "champion small business" #keanosu
Four years latter Romney can't escape Bush's shadow in the eyes of undecided's #keanosu
Obama took a question about women in the workforce and turned it into an ad for #PlannedParenthood #keanosu
Obama: women are increasingly the bread winners of the family #signofthetimes #keanosu
candidates need to take a math course, so their math is consistant and "adds up" #keanosu
Romney: we don't have to endure 43 months of unemployment under 8 percent. is this a fair assertion? #kenosu
Romney won't increase middle class/top5% taxes. Obama agrees about middle, but has rhat 250k limit #keanosu #nothingschanged
Obama: we've built enough pipline to rap around the whole earth once #keanosu he's just not going to use it
@love_kristine Yes indede, it's getting intense, Romney: You'll get your chance in a moment, I'm still speaking #keanosu
@Nicole_Kraft It's hard, Obama: long term focus on environment. Romney: 8 yr plan for NA oil indepence, The diff is permits/coal #keanosu

candidates agree that higher education has value, and that promoting local job growth is critical #keanosu obama's answer was more nuanced

We pray until our words run out, 28/31
Our God loves people like poems, loves poems like prayers, and loves prayers even when they are silent. 27/31
So get thee behind me blindness and come to me quietly light. 26/31
it always pumps this fast. 25/31
relax… 24/31
No, this is my time and place. This is me saving my saved face. So if my heart starts to radiate bold broken glass, y’all, 23/31
who all peel and staple great gobs of large labels to a god they just wanna slum. 22/31
or a battle on your god of the makers of money (odd mockers of drum) 21/31
the way they feel their spines screaming, sparkling gods who gotta live by the way they shine. And this is not a dot-to-dot plot 20/31
‘cause we’ve got bees on flowers with honey on hold for those made of gold but wrapped in wires who keep themselves inspired by 19/31
to be redeemed at any time in any place. So you can bring on your boogieman loading his fuss and gunning his fattening desire 18/31
and three times the speed of my blood ‘cause everybody’s got voices and everybody’s got some they can’t contain like my need 17/31
and boxes of roof tops and noises I can’t outrun even when I’m running twice the speed of sound already 16/31
And I drop my jaw at fire when it’s flyin out my eyesLord I plunge my coiling wires in the water till I rise above frogs and pop rocks 15/31
We sing when we pray. We laugh when we pray. When I pray I move my feet for the goosebump in the heartbeat… 14/31
the way tympanum sounds when it turns the word eardrum into a cymbal. We play percussion when we pray. 13/31
When we pray our chests peel back like open love letters the size of tide, the way tide sounds when it crashed your tympanum, 12/31
You are the shoulders of a woman whose name I never learned. You are the fire returned back to itself with every burnt book. 11/31
eating pocket-watches to suck the chain back to your chest. You are the men and their saws. You are silence. You are gospels. 10/31
When I pray I pray in museums. I pray over sweat-stained stages. I pray with vinyl prayer wheels. I pray by reading math, 9/31
My God’s abridged book is a children’s story where the lessons are simple and the smiles lift like first grade watercolors. 8/31
I have fit its sound. Like trees, like lightening, our prayers come from the ground up. 7/31
to the sun's Holy Sanskirts.I carry your forests in my heart.Your fields are on my back.I have not fit your ocean into my chest yet but 6/31
And when the words break too much glass inside me I run when I pray. I run when I pray on trails watching the branches blur 5/31
Lord, let me write, leave me autistic and typing until my windows bust into a thousand silver doves and I know the poem is done. 4/31
like an umbilical cord. When I was eight I prayed for a chest of kites. Now I pray for you to open my chest of kites. 3/31
When I pray I pray thanks for the small things, for the flowers and other natural holidays, for my eight-year-old niece flying her kite 2/31
Gospelstitch: I pray thanks for the woman’s heels I heard on the way here tonight- they sounded like salt. 1/31

#wow facebook statesus are OVERRATED this is way more fun
otherwise I only know a time portion of what the whole discussion is, and that's cutting myself short
Some people might be upset bout the selection, but for me it's nessisary to have divergent opinions,
at this point I've got a good section that are in complete contrast to one another. Example ive got haris and hictens against piper+ driscol

@cwimber89 plus the songs repeat, a lot! #film1310
ugh, #thegraduate really needs a much more extensive soundtrack #film1310
@Leonardo_Rocks yea its prolly a mix of both. thinkin bout it-a reason #TFINYR promoted showing sex was cause films show violence #film1310
@Leonardo_Rocks I thought the main point of #TFINYR was that the MPAA was not well run and it treats films unfairly #film1310
One thing I liked from #TFINYR is that it argued for more than one ratings system, so the better will win ( #treyparker interview) #film1310
@Leonardo_Rocks sex,alot of times,is private. Violence is talked bout/seen by the public. Thats prolly the root of MPAAs beef. #film1310
@Leonardo_Rocks both extremes of sex/violence should be in nc-17 films, they're both detrimental. #TFINYR focused on sex so i did #film1310
#MPAA doesnt have a great standard/criteria, but at least they have some sense of what's appropriate #film1310 #TFINYR
a director showing people"Going down"knows what s/he is doing, it could get a nc-17, its their choice, so why the outrage? #film1310 #TFINYR
If ive learned anything in #film1310 it's that a filmmaker knows exactly what they're doing. #TFINYR
#TFINYR =worst movie of the semester. I dont get the importance of showing anal rape in movies+allowing a child to possibly see it #film1310
#SOTL I must say Buffalo Bill's dance really has shaped my image of a what a transsexual acts like, I know it's a movie but it did #film1310
#SOTL Clarice is not saved/punished (not more than any other would be). She is independent and capably (i.e. she confronts bill) #film1310
#SOTL Clarice totally destroys the mother/whore dichotomy. She is neither and is fulfilled without having children or a lover #film1310
@BriannaGerman I agree. The movie challenged what society considers a life ruiner and showed that some good can come out of it #film1310
Tron Legacy: doesnt fir into any categories, but it does uphold traditional gender roles (i.e. women beings quiet and scarce) #film1310
I dont crave violence/ogle at "Men’s nearly naked bodies." Cant men watch movies w/out people telling us we're secret homosexuals? #Fim1310
all time fav kid movie #waltdisney'srobinhood ,it didn't white people or any other people, just animals, that's progressive right? #film1310
These tweets make me feel bad for watching too many "white movies"-my new movie was gonna be #americanhistoryx but it's too old :( #film1310
#therewillbeblood is fantastic-but i think it only has white people,perhaps there are asians/blacks in menial labor jobs,but idk #film1310
i also liked #beachblanketbingo though im feel strange to admit it. it had mostly if not all whites-man i was a racist little kid #film1310
I loved #theshaggydog 1959 when i was younger-it omitted anyone nonwhite, and reinforced the classic stereotypes of the 50's   #film1310
#boyzinthehood best example is the main childs mother/father.they were divorced but they had a common interest, their sons success #film1310
#boyzinthehood shows stereotypes in parenting by divorce, yet defies it by having those each parent provide a stable upbringing #film1310
#tronlegacy #amansworld ,built by a man,who made computermen,for other computermen to live.The only women were subservient helpers #film1310
@narumug he did,he thought she was exctly like him,but she had more emotions then he did,sothere actualy differnt #film1310 i was impressed
@narumug Clyde thinks in terms of now, where as Bonnie thought of the future #film1310
@narumug im sure they both want a family,but when was askd what hed do w/ a fresh start,he said rob other states not give up crime #film1310
However, B didnt want to continue in their life of crime / #rebellionagainstauthority  when C did. #bonnieandclyde  #film1310
#bonnieandclyde loved #rebellionagainstauthority , it was their creed/goal (i.e. when B & C did their first crime, she went crazy) #film1310
@GTTVshow OMG! I just got your package. It's really awesome. Thanks to Shane and all the other guys at GT. Keep up the good work.

Not sure why, but #religious makes me want to listen to @BenFolds #jesusland ...it seems to fit, just sayin #film1310
@bradamantium92 I agree 100% about #religious .There is nothing stronger to reinforce ones point then the use of counter arguments #film1310
just made faces in toast #winning
Even though I didnt agree w/ #religious 's thesis,I still liked it-always good to step outside your own belief & learn bout others #film1310
@natekarate7 good point.he also didn't (if I remember)show any highlights/beneficial effects of religion, only negative #religious #film1310
#tick #religious DISAGREE w/ blue,he says he doesnt have answers/but he rules out religion+only shows what will make his pointwork #film1310
#religious = #problem it makes an assumption that religion wil cause a nuclearholocaust+it never entrtains any contrary notion #film1310
@natekarate7 I think #religious picked the only terrible parts of a religion,exploiting them+never giving any a fair represntation #film1310
#religious = #problematic it makes an assumption that religion wil cause a nuclearholocaust+it never entrtains any contrary notion #film1310
@OliviaSheba That's true. for someone who claims to not have #religious belief, he is incredibly unfair to views diff then his own #film1310
@GTTVshow Would be a good day but @geoffkeighley keeps appearing in my toast http://yfrog.com/gyofuknhj http://yfrog.com/h2clwsfj

@KelliMarshall I thought most/all old/er movies were recorded directly (direct sound), guess thats a bit impractical #film1310 #SITR
@KelliMarshall ok, but isnt ADR really only used via computers? right/wrong? did they use something else to record w/? #film1310 #SITR
@4AcademicHonor0 i see. It was hard to think about types/techniques of sound being used, caus the movie was really good #film1310 #SITR
@4AcademicHonor0 ya, but didnt the sound make the movie. even though u thought u didnt pay attention to it u really did #SITR #film1310
dont think ADR was posible fr #SITR , no computers. but they prolly rerecorded over some singing parts, itd be hard to film them #film1310
@mcaris23 i defiantly agree  w/ that. found it pretty hard to focus on the editing of #RW cause the narrative was really engaging #film1310
Fav #RW scene, jeffries falls out the window. Lookd like 2 diff shots in 1, guess its a form of Match Cuts, cause it fits great. #film1310
