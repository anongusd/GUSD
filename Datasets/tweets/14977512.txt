@texasinafrica The University cannot strip someone of their scholarship because of a Title IX accusation.
@pinepaula That's correct - he's still not on the team because Title IX investigation is ongoing. But he won scholarship appeal.
@hoverlawyer @TimWatkins04 he cannot because the Title IX investigation has remained active this entire time.

AT 10: Former #Baylor transfer Jeremy Faulk, stripped of his scholarship after Title IX accusation, has had it reinstated. More at 10.
She's expressed it was creating an atmosphere where students were reluctant to speak w/ Title IX for fear of undue action. #Baylor
Reason she wants to talk likely has to do with #Baylor admin. going around Title IX office during scandal, taking action without due process

Judge will entertain a change in how the 6 month sentence will be served. Neumanns could serve their 6 months consecutively.
BREAKING: Judge decides jail sentence for Dale and Leilani Neumann will begin. Each parent to spend 1 month in jail each year for 6 years.
Defense responding, asks "what would be the purpose of a jail sentence?"
State is going through each point of defense's motion and arguing each was already considered at original sentence hearing.
Prosecution: "The fact that the Neumanns lost their daughter was the very reason they were there for sentencing"
The State argues the stay should be lifted, jail sentence should begin.
The prosecution says there is sufficient time left on probation for incremental jail sentence initially imposed.
Dale Neumann says he humbly comes before the judge and asks for modification of his sentence.
No Neumanns in court in prayer death motions hearing. Leilani making a statement right now by phone. http://t.co/BBeQDS30tg
