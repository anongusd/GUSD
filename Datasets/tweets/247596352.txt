@MarianneChick1 @seanhannity How about you just move to Texas? If you don’t love it, leave it. We ( The Majority of Californians ) love it. And don’t want to change it to a Trump state.

@ProudPatriot24 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Obviously you don’t know Pelosi. &amp; you don’t know what a ransom is? Even if the dems did “ cut a deal  “ The President would change his mind and not sign it. The art of the deal is to change your mind when criticized by right wing talk radio hosts. Like last time. And before that
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I’ll give you the hostages if you give me $ is not a compromise. It’s a terrorist act.

@peggy10976 @seanhannity A bunch of Canadians here illegally too. Where is the outrage for a northern border wall? They bring drugs. I’ve gotten drugs off Canadians before.
The difference between the #WomansMarch &amp; #march4life is that both are antisemitic. But the pro lifers own it proudly &amp; unapologetically.
@peggy10976 @seanhannity Why not billions of illegals getting $$$. Just as ridiculous. Trump is the one holding paychecks hostage. House has passed 9 budget bills #WheresMitch

@CSmithengton @EricJay33 @tedcruz 17k murders every year. Statistically there will be some illegals, some black, some white, some Asian. Why do we have so many is the real problem.
@CSmithengton @EricJay33 @tedcruz We don’t hear about it because the fake news media hides it! That’s why I only get my news from https://t.co/WSFqUMTdP4
@CSmithengton @EricJay33 @tedcruz I think all illegals are a US immigration problem. I don’t care where they come from.
@CSmithengton @EricJay33 @tedcruz Yes. You are correct. Liberals love crime. They’re worse than those Canadians! We need a border wall up north to protect us from crime, illegals &amp; hockey pucks! https://t.co/5cKv5qnczz

@seanhannity This is fake news. I live 15 miles from Davis CA. Nobody is protesting this photo. It’s on digital billboards all over our freeways reading “ her watch has ended “
@seanhannity She wasn’t killed by an immigrant. Officer Corona was killed by a white male with a history of violence. And still had multiple guns.

@HalfPintMimi @seanhannity You feel the same way about Florida, Louisiana &amp; Texas??? Im betting not.
@HalfPintMimi @seanhannity Yeah. Let’s blame the victims 🇺🇸👍
@ToddHutchins4 @seanhannity Right. I don’t wanna pay for a wall either..
@IngrahamAngle Fox News going full court press on the wall propaganda.
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady So what. I’m sorry Trump only pardons criminals guilty of beating people in custody. That excusable.
@GOP Lyin Ted is a joke. Trump insulted your wife and you praise him at every dumb turn. Pathetic.
@HalfPintMimi @seanhannity All natural disasters have been forgotten by this president. He’s considering pulling disaster funds to build a wall. That = forgotten
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady I don’t waste time with people who insult instead of debate “ I’m a joke &amp; idiot “ you Trump cult members are a cliche’
@HalfPintMimi @seanhannity Great. I’m supposed to be upset because the president has taken a vacation in a few weeks? That was a campaign promise.
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady Trump has pardon a criminal or 2.
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady Non violent. &amp; states rights
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady One story of a pardon. Every criminal that’s illegal gets pardon is logical to you?
@seanhannity PROPAGANNITY!
@seanhannity Also. Help generate $ for a US territory that has been forgotten by this administration. Puerto Rico: please stop throwing paper towels at us 😔
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady Good one. I’m sure you are a big infowars fan.
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady https://t.co/SoAXlEbBBM 😐 sounds like a credible source.
@MyBizNY @RepKevinBrady I’m an independent. And if you believe criminals get pardons just because they’re illegals? That’s because you are off your medication😔

@GOP @IvankaTrump Great. How does that help American families?
@SpeakerPelosi That’s what America looks like to me.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump If Donny spent as much time with the Troops as he does on Fox News. Maybe he wouldn’t have a 37% approval rating 😐
@GOP @realDonaldTrump More people approve of the border wall than Trumps personal approval rating... That says a lot.
@ericswalwell just once in an interview can you end it with “ #DubNation “??? - The Trey Area
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Well at least they didn’t go to Puerto Rico and start hitting jump shots with paper towels 😐
@MarshaBlackburn Fake polls. I got a poll that says 99% don’t want a wall.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Washington passed a clean CR to fund the government in December. The president didn’t sign it.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Give border patrol discount housing and build border communities. Cheaper housing and job security is a great insensitive for recruitment
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Rich people have more camera security than walls. Because seeing is more important. Can’t stop what you can’t see.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Should of done that 2 years ago. When he had the numbers
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Or maybe they are reassuring Puerto Rican’s that their recovery is more important than a border wall.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Water would be better. An aqueduct. And would take care of the thousands of tunnels. Which is the real problem form illegal smuggling.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn I don’t need MSM to tell me why a “ big beautiful wall “ not a good investment for the American tax payer.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn And a wall is a temporary jobs program that has many critics of actually doing anything ( me ) when you could put that same amount into adding border patrol agents, housing, vehicles, drones, sensors &amp; fencing. Which has long term job effects
@Salt_Fist @seanhannity People can compromise without holding federal workers paychecks. Republicans had all 3 branches for 2 years. Plenty of time to get wall funding. Why now? Because Trump likes blaming people for his incompetence.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn The border patrol agents I’ve heard say some fencing is need in some spots. Only border patrol union leaders believe in the 25 billion dollar water to water Wall.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn That’s the problem. They don’t know. They don’t have social media in a Guatemalan villages. And a wall won’t stop asylum claims which is the majority of these caravaners are claiming.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Because building an expensive wall does almost nothing for securing the border. The big majority of criminal activity happens at the ports of entry.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn So you would travel 1000 miles on foot. For months. Get to a 30 ft wall and say “ we’ll, let’s go back there’s a wall “ 😐or would you find a ladder?

@Jim_Jordan @JudgeJeanine Boo👎🏿
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Our government has done some amazing things for people. But also has done some horrific things to its own citizens. Not as bad as some. But still way below American standards of equality. I don’t care who the president is. I wouldn’t wanna be anywhere else 🇺🇸✌🏽
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn These refugees only know what the people who are selling them the dream tell them. They are selling a path to the port of entry &amp; an excuse to claim asylum. Walls won’t stop the message.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Yeah pretty much. Declare war on the cartels. Treat it like any terrorist organization. But that messes with a lot of people’s $. On both sides of the border. And some who work for this government. El Chapo is not even the tip of the iceberg. My opinion
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Some would argue that some illegals love this country more than the American born citizens on the liberal left. It doesn’t make either one more or less an a American citizen
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Selling people dreams of a better life is part of capitalism. And unfortunately “ businessmen “ in counties south of the border are selling dreams of America. Some are traffickers &amp; some are smugglers. A wall can’t stop $.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn This isn’t about “ security “ it’s about a “ wall “ a symbol of division. Which doesn’t solve the complex problems Trump mentions. But does remind his followers that this country has 2 classes of citizens. “ real “ Americans &amp; whatever I am.
@NSteele1991 @usacontributor @MarshaBlackburn Or... Republicans can just re open government. Easy answer to a self inflicted wound

@GOP Unfortunately Trump has so many news cycles spinning with his chaos leadership. Most people don’t believe him.

@judymcneely1 @RouseHouse @HomeFreeMoms @RentingMyths @seanhannity Because Republican CA farmers have been hiring illegals at a major discount since the 1950’s. It’s not liberal tech hiring a them. All law breakers should be held accountable

@seanhannity Finally Donny tells the truth about something. And the truth is that he OWNS THIS SHUTDOWN. Feel free to slap the Trump name on it
@seanhannity Sean Hannity is President. Trump is just a talking head 😐
@Jim_Jordan Ummm... you got 1 vote for minority leader. Your opinions matter to no one in Congress
@washingtonpost Of course. The wall will end up building built by Mexicans with Chinese steel. And paid for by... never mind 😔
@Trendenz @washingtonpost What’s a wave? 100 seats?
@Truthwsuf @seanhannity It’s not common sense to me and a majority of Americans. A way more effective way to stop people is water. An aqueduct from the ocean to the gulf would cut off the tunnels. But it’s not about that. It’s about a trophy
@ericnynj @seanhannity Donny had all 3 branches for 2 years. Now he wants Congress &amp; tax payers to pay for this wall Mexico was supposed to pay for. Why? Because it’s distracting &amp; good Trump TV
@IngrahamAngle Your voice is like reverse viagra
@Truthwsuf @seanhannity Your “ Guess “ comes from what research? Let me guess. Gut feeling. A lot of that going around
@ericnynj @seanhannity I’m an independent
@NobleJustice4 @seanhannity My lake of knowledge is just fine...
@LarryYo20703892 @seanhannity Just because you don’t like other Americans &amp; their ideas. Doesn’t make them second class citizens. The borders aren’t open. And a wall won’t  stop crime. Being smarter than the criminals does. A wall is a dumb idea to a complex situation. And in this case an expensive symbol.
@SteveScalise @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews How are you more divisive after you get shot by a partisan?
@LarryYo20703892 @seanhannity I know the history of lady liberty. Thanks. She was there as a welcoming symbol to Irish &amp; Italian immigrants in the 1800’s. France paid for her. Mexico can pay for his Wall.
@Truthwsuf @seanhannity Can you promise that a wall will stop illegal immigration and drug traffickers 100%??? 90? 60% 45%??? Anything? No....
@LarryYo20703892 @seanhannity The symbol of America’s greatness is the Statue of Liberty. And should stay that way.
@seanhannity Yeah it will. Because it means Mueller’s finishing too. Which is all bad if your last name rhymes with DUMP
@seanhannity When you lie as much as Donny. Nobody believes you when you yell “ crisis “ that’s just science

@shorelifecrissy @washingtonpost They could of went to the White House. But they didn’t:( I’m sure every great father spends the holidays alone 👍
@GOP @EricTrump And for your birthday your dad is somewhere else. Just like your whole life. Hopefully he’ll remember on twitter😔
@shorelifecrissy @washingtonpost Well she has a family that loves her and wants to be with her during the holidays. And the President was alone. Says a lot.

@Jaxson52334021 @seanhannity Whatever Jaxoff. He only complains. That’s his whole show.
@seanhannity Even Trumps base is tired of complaining about Hillary. Your rating are pretty clear on that.
@GOP @SecNielsen Dropped before or after they die in custody?
@jelanti53 @realDonaldTrump At his age. believing he’ll change is marginal
@rbl5448_lilly @seanhannity Education is a matter of opinion these days. Proof isn’t proof. Facts aren’t facts. So the solution is inner state migration. Talking to actual people who think differently is more powerful than just random online strangers who copy &amp; paste.

@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan Are Canadians gonna pay for it? My point is that globalization is ok with $ not people. Immigrants are ok as long as they are from certain countries. It’s not what you said. But the president does.
@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan https://t.co/dFX4WRk12y It’s weird you never hear about these illegals...
@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan ... And the far left doesn’t represent ALL Democrats. Just like the far right doesn’t represent all republicans. It’s why I’m a moderate liberal independent. Blind party loyalism is the problem
@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan Globalism is not going to stop. Our stock markets rely to heavily on it. If you think a wall is going to stop world market capitalism. Well. Good luck.
@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan Then there’s a reason why 5 US Presidents have not built a wall. Because as time goes on. We discover better ways to do things. It’s why wounded veterans can get titanium legs they can run on instead of wooden pegs.
@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan I’m an independent. Not that it matters. And this country hasn’t seen unity since 9/11. This “ wall “ is just a glorified statue to Donald Trump. I don’t wanna pay for that &amp; neither does Mexico. There’s more advanced ways to stop and track people.
@honeybee7885 @Jim_Jordan Other families that won’t have their children or parents for Christmas  	- 17 families from Parkland 	- 50+ families from Orlando	- 50+ families from a Las Vegas Country Concert	- 26 families from Texas	- 20 families from Newtown	This is not about safety.

@acmom62 @Jim_Jordan I’m not disputing politicians lie. I’m saying building a wall is just Trumps way of building a statue that will only help his ego. Censors, fences &amp; agents is a better use of the $ he’s already secured
@acmom62 @Jim_Jordan So you’re saying the president lied??? I believe border security should be funded. The 2Billion could hire border agents &amp; create more jobs.
@acmom62 @Jim_Jordan The point is that MEXICO was going to pay for it. Not the taxpayers. How about our billionaire POTUS pay for it &amp; Mexico will pay him back?
@acmom62 @Jim_Jordan Well that didn’t get funded either.
@ReneeBevry Oh idk. Maybe the presidents lawyer doing interviews about directed illegal campaign payoffs &amp; missing inaugural funds in the millions

@ericswalwell Cocaine Mitch hopefully is done in 2020. Please find someone to run in Kentucky 🙏
@sarharoze @seanhannity I disagree. I think Steven Miller organized the busses to the border. To push Congress on wall funding before the new Congress. #gutfeeling always go with your gut. Not facts. Gut!!!
@AchinekuTersoo @seanhannity Benefits help Donny’s border wall bs. I’m betting Steven Miller drove the bus to the border.
@mrqdoughty1 @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump Speaking of infrastructure... that’s a word that doesn’t get mentioned much by Donny.
@mtwago1 @seanhannity Nice comeback 👍
@seanhannity Trumpism on immigration:		1) create a crisis 		2) make policy on manufactured crisis  		3) blame Obama when policy gets bad press 		Repeat
Let’s sign up the migrants for the northern army before the next civil war? Pretty good path to citizenship for the Irish back in the day. Just sayin.

@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends The difference is I don’t hate or blame Donald Trump for being himself. And building his following out of disgruntled republicans. But you hate Obama, Holder, Susan Rice. Maxine Waters. Hmmmm 🤔
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends There’s no such thing as facts anymore. Both sides have opinion based echo chambers. Mixed with trigger words like. Troops. Second amendment. Police. Freedom vs Women. Gay. Minorities &amp; Racism. It’s  why I’m an independent
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends You know you are complaining about liberals being crybabies while simultaneously crying about liberals being mean on twitter, right?
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends #Hypocrites
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends ❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️😂. Do you need a safe space?
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Here*
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Yeah. Everything is a liberal conspiracy. We are all crazy. I’m not hear to change your mind. Or insult you. Just try to reason with you on the facts. But Trumpism is built on an alternative facts planet.
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Search for yourself. It’s easy to prove me wrong if I am. Credible pollsters please. Rutgers, politico etc
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends False facts? Where? Trump doesn’t have the approval of the majority. In every poll including FOX NEWS. Steady @ 42-43%
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends I’m not the snowflake that blocks people for saying words on twitter. And I’m not undercover. I’m a proud liberal who’s happy to be on the right side of civil rights history.
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Jokes are supposed to be funny. Just sayin. Even if they aren’t. You’re supposed to try
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Your twitter buddy mamie blocked me? Haha. Snowflakes ❄️. You sure like butt talk a lot. I’d call them jokes but they lack funny. I’m glad Trump is president. This country needs to take a hard look at itself as what kind of citizens we want to be for our future &amp; children.
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends I’m not a Democrat. And the guy with a shirtless buff Trump as his profile pic telling me I have psychological issues? That’s funny. Closet homo.
France wins the World Cup. Another championship team not going to the White House.
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Did you just retweet your own reply &amp; like it? Wow. You just out Trump’d Trump. Congrats.
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends And Trumps voters are Hillbillies, Racist &amp; Russians. Is this also a Proven Fact?
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends He’s only president because Sanders wasn’t the Nominee. And the majority of voters still voted for Hillary #NeverForget
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Haha. You are high if you think Trumps ego would every take a VP job. Bernie will win in 2020. By then enough independents will be tired of Trumps bumbling lies. And the heartland will be tired of the Tariffs &amp; stagnant wages. I won’t be voting for Bernie either. #Kasich2020
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends I don’t hate Trump. I’m just glad Mike Pence will never be president. Pence is way worse
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Is one of America’s core values mass shootings every month?
@mamie13129 @KeithKiser6 @foxandfriends Haha! Morals &amp; Values from President “ grab em by the 🐈 “ that’s classic
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends Well he is a stable genius that knows the best words. Just because you’re a sleazy douchebag draft dodger. Doesn’t mean you can’t be POTUS. and do a good job. Just looks bad.
@KeithKiser6 @mamie13129 @foxandfriends And Mamie. Here’s proof that the MAGA hat cult are just jealous racist who fear intelligence
@mamie13129 @KeithKiser6 @foxandfriends Yeah. What’s more realistic? The former First Lady is a transvestite. Or you 2 are racially bias when it comes to black women?
@mamie13129 @KeithKiser6 @foxandfriends It wasn’t an insult baby cakes. Your moms a tiger in the sac. I hope she’s doing well. My comments have been all complements. You’re the one who called the former First Lady a “ Tranny “
@mamie13129 @KeithKiser6 @foxandfriends I got your mom in real life🙂. She’s a squirter 💦💦💦

@foxandfriends In Trumps defense. He can’t hear people who aren’t telling him how amazing he is.
@tarak8te @TheButteryOne @DebbieHeald7 @seanhannity They aren’t protesting for their lives. Which are good in many ways I agree. They are protesting for the voiceless dead kids who where murdered by police. Unfortunately no one pays attention to protesting in your living room.

@T54491914 @SpringAmerican6 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain I find it impossible to believe that in your whole life. You have never stereotyped any group. It’s human nature. You can’t control it. But you can control your own actions. It’s the reasons for wars &amp; religion. I have no guilt because I am honest with myself.
@foxandfriends Pretty easy fix. Stop it at the manufacturer. But then we could blame brown people...
@T54491914 @SpringAmerican6 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain Then everyone is bigoted. And anyone who says they are not, is a lying bigot
@SpringAmerican6 @T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain Racial stereotypes and bigotry are not the same thing to me. Saying “ Black people love rap “ to “ Black People are dumb “ are 2 different statements based on opinion. One is an accurate stereotype for the most part. &amp; the other is not.
@SpringAmerican6 @T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain What? Haha! I’m the bigot? Or someone else?
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Yes. Barack &amp; Michelle hate America. That makes total sense. Bill &amp; Hillary hate America. I don’t like the Bush’s much. But I never thought once they hated America. That would be un American. Trumps a retard. But I don’t hate him. He’s POTUS. And I love this country. No change
@foxandfriends 100% sure Liberals &amp; abortion’s caused the crash &amp; Muslims too... fair &amp; balanced
@SpringAmerican6 @T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain They did it for money. Not becaused they believed in equal rights. Not all of them. But most. White People who fought for civil rights in the 60’s, hero’s
@SpringAmerican6 @T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain Another fact is that they got paid to join the northern army. And a majority did it for $. Not to free slaves.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends You mean free speech???
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Heard plenty of so called conservatives say un American statement about Obama. And his wife. The former First Lady
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Stop crying and take some responsibility. I do. Liberals are whiny. I agree.
@catbaloo59 @T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain Is that what they tell you in suburban white schools?
@T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain How do you feel about teenage mass shooting victims/survivors standing up?
@T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain Yes. They are 13% of the US population but almost 50% of the prison population. So how am I wrong about systemic racism again???
@T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain I’m honest. I let her believe in Santa Claus without telling her he isn’t real.  I won’t tell my kid she can be anything. Because she’s 9 &amp; believes in becoming a fairy princess.
@T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain They also make up less of the US population. You should get a time machine &amp; tell slaves that “ you are not a victim unless you chose to be...
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Do you love this country or don’t you? Because it sounds like you hate it. Muslims, liberals, teenagers exercising their 1st Amendment rights. Maybe you should start your own country. Since you only love the 2nd Amendment &amp; not the other ones.
@T54491914 @FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain Tell that to Jim Crow victims. And the millions effected by mass incarceration for profit. I don’t blame individual white people today for slavery 400 years ago. But I do blame the 1% for profiting off systematic racism today.
@jimmykimmel @seanhannity @Disney Haha! Best twitter war ever...
@FoxNews @foxandfriends @carolmswain The constitution was written generations ago. Maybe we should forget about that too?
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I’ll remind you of the tea party wave of 2010. You should be familiar with that off year election. I assume because you have the DTOM flag as a profile pic. I bet Obama didn’t think he could lose the house &amp; senate either.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends King, Queen, Pope. Whatever. I don’t judge people by sex
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends We will see in nov 2018. While you are clinging to your guns and religion. The youth of this country will be mapping the future of the United States of America. Have fun at your underground militia meetings to take on the government! Haha!
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends King George III. My premise is still accurate. Ooooooh you got me mixing up King &amp; Queen. 👍 good job
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends  https://t.co/no6gFzphQV
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Terrorist come in all colors &amp; religions. Christians have their own history of terrorism. The crusades. I don’t need you to pretend like you are protecting my rights for my own good. I’ll protect my own rights. 1 person 1 vote. Let the majority decide what’s best for the future
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends They went to war because they didn’t want to pay taxes to the queen anymore. Are you planning to stop paying taxes? Good luck with that.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends A mosque is not a Muslim terrorist cell. It’s just a church for Brown People
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Again. I’ve never once said confiscation. Another NRA scare tactic
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends So you don’t stand by &amp; support our troops &amp; police officers? Sounds pretty un American to me. Well I do. There’s a great way to posses weapons of war. You might of heard. It’s called ENLISTING.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Nice. Shouldn’t take 30 shots to hit a target. If you can shoot.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I know enough. Been around guns my whole life. Yeah I’m not an expert. But neither are 90% + of gun owners
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends So organized militias can protect themselves from the tyranny of government. But that’s not the case in the 21st Century. If the NG, ATF &amp; FBI wanna break up an organized militia aka domestic terrorists. Then I support our troops &amp; police over a group of Gun Addicts.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Some are designed for offense. Light weight Short range w/ high capacity magazine. Aka weapons of war.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I don’t. But I don’t speak for all liberals
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Looks like a 783 modified with a flash suppressor &amp; a 5 round mag. But I’m probably wrong. The pic is dark
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Not yet. Have you tried hunting people yet? Please don’t tell me it’s for “ home protection “ because that’s a joke. It’s built for offense not defense. And Florida must have different prices than where ever you live.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I disagree. We need a gun tax. Parkland shooter bought his AR for $130 I read. If that’s true. That gun needs to be $1300. That would cut down on owners losing track of cheap guns.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Abraham Lincoln was a liberal Republican. Not sure what “ true “ liberal means.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Never said YOU were a republican. But you are right. I’m a liberal. But not a Democrat
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I’m not arguing. I’m debating
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends There were always liberals. 150 years ago they called them Republicans. And I’ve had lots of guns. But not legally. As a teenager in the inner city they were everywhere. And easy to get. Trafficked in from red states. Like Indiana to Chicago
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Key word “ like “ not are...
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends The background check system is a joke when it comes to firearms in the US. Reform is needed.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Women’s health care rights. And access to birth control. And the President wasn’t “ self proclaimed “ he didn’t get his degree in the Mail.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Obama is a Constitutional Scholar. Didn’t stop “ so called “ conservatives from calling him an un-American Muslim on the daily bases. You think you are more important than other Americans. And you use YOUR RIGHTS instead of our rights.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I believe that should put you on a big federal government watch list.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I never said you were a gun addict.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Stockpiling. Exploiting gun show &amp; online modification loop holes. Talking about guns more than anything else. Spending more $ then the previous year to name a few
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends John 16:33
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Again. You hard right gun addicts all sound like NRA talking points. Cherry picking the constitution &amp; bible
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends God didn’t tell me that. God told me something else.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends A history book is just a guide on what not to do in the future. Progressive. I know. It’s scary. And you can’t shoot it
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Spoken like a true guns and religion addict
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends So are you saying “ God gives you the right to an AR-15 “ this doesn’t help the debate. I’m trying to see the right wing side with an open mind.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends In this democracy we are all in it together. Left, right &amp; center. I don’t claim to have all the answers to fixing the escalation of mass shootings. But I’m sure it’s not more guns.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends You guys did it to yourselves by refusing to compromise. Right wing stubbornness created this next generation
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I fully support your inalienable right to own a musket. As many muskets as you want. Actually any weapons they made in 1776.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends It’s not me you have to worry about. I’m old. It’s Gen Z kids become 1 issue voters.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Gun addiction kills more than just the addict. It’s a national crisis.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Not mine alone. But I’m not alone. A lot of us feel this way. And we are sick and tired of the “ Obamas coming for our guns “ excuse everytime half the country wants to talk about ending loop holes and regulations.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends I’m a US Citizen. And like it or not. My vote and opinion matters just as much as yours.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends This is why we need regulations. Because YOU feel you should own whatever weapons you want. I don’t feel the same way. This has nothing to do with hunting or protection. It’s about addiction. The 2nd Amendment has been distorted by Gun Addicts. And now we have an epidemic.
@2ndamendment @foxandfriends Why not an RPG then? And you are not allowed to drive whatever you want on American highways. Or we’d see more NASCARS on the daily basis. I support the right to bare arms. But not the right to stockpile weapons of war.
@tedcruz I love CA. But I would never say “ the whole country should adopt CA laws “ I hope you lose Lyin Ted #Beto4Senate
@Calimwulf @foxandfriends @2A @Scotus @2ndamendment Just because one extreme left person said “ ban all guns “ doesn’t mean we ALL think that. &amp; Stamps/ Doll collection don’t get stolen end up in illegal black market sales for whoever to kill with.
@steeler875 @foxandfriends So if you don’t like abortion, don’t get one?
@Calimwulf @foxandfriends @2A @Scotus Stockpiling assault weapons is not what the @2ndamendment should protect. Loop holes and $$$ are accessories to murder.
@BLMSacramento I heard a rumor that Stephon Clark’s brother is already shopping for a Mercedes??? Please tell me this is a horrible lie. Because those are the actions that destroy meaningful movements. And re-enforce stereotypes.
@foxandfriends “ Taking your guns “ is a right wing dog whistle scare tactic orchestrated by the NRA. Limiting Mag size and assault weapon sales is just common sense. You don’t need an AR-15 to hunt. Unless you are hunting people.
@stweettweets @russboot @foxandfriends Hearts &amp; minds are the best place to shoot ppl also.
@Merlin703 @foxandfriends Those groups are NOT during school session times. They are on student times. If kids want to pray on their lunch break, that’s fantastic. But stopping studies to pray is not fair to students who are atheists or of different faiths. It’s a slippery slope.
@stweettweets @russboot @foxandfriends Thoughts and Prayers just makes you feel good. It will never be the solution too Mass shootings.
@foxandfriends @SebGorka Leaving the door open for the next terrorist organization? Or is this what Putin wants? And Trump wants to help his buddy? More Sanctions are needed
@Merlin703 @foxandfriends Praying for your life is different than carving out “ prayer time “ during class time. Praying should be homework
@foxandfriends I pray that they teach science. And leave the religion where it belongs. In church
I wanna pick which 40 hrs I work in a week. Why can’t I do them whenever again?
@TGowdySC @booksamillion Unified? ??? Ha! Do you mean this country or the republicans or the Trumpians or race relations or something else? Because I’m not watching the same show. Channel please?

@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Obama did what he had to on spending. We were on a depression life support in 09. Bush ran up the tab. Trump just added 1.5 T in omnibus bill in his first 14 months. Where is the outrage?
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Ha! Real clear investigation . Com. So it must be true. Or a James Patterson spy novel😂
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany The 500 million was Iranian $ we had frozen. It was theirs already. We didn’t pay them. We just let them have it because of the nuke deal. But nice try👍
@Benzkat1313 I’m an independent who voted for Kasich. But good luck trying to stereotype people on twitter
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Why is Obama a “ traitor “ again? Because he’s not white? Or because he’s brown?
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Haha! Trump doesn’t apologize for anything. Please stop lying 🤥
@wvrginyn @kfrank0629 @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Definitely defiant with her vocabulary
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany So why is this bad?
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Notice how I never insulted your intelligence? WWJD?
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany I think it’s great. That evangelicals Christians now don’t care about morals and family values
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany My point is he cheated on all his wives. And he never even apologized. The porn stars &amp; playmates said the sex was consensual. He probably should of wore a condom but hey. Who am I to tell the POTUS about VD🤢
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany You should try it. Obama is a good man. Regardless of what you think of his politics
@kfrank0629 @wvrginyn @foxandfriends @kayleighmcenany Don’t have to be a genius to know Trump “ totally colluded “ those vaginas while he was thinking about his daughter Ivanka. You only have to listen to his comments since... forever. But he hasn’t got us all killed yet so I guess that’s something positive.

@Michele_Henson @realDonaldTrump HAHAHAHahahaha! Trump supporters are the real casualty of this campaign season
@Michele_Henson @realDonaldTrump check the polls honey. He's getting crushed #Hillary2016
@Michele_Henson what facts! Haha! The fact is. Gun sales go up! Mass shootings go up! Even @realDonaldTrump wants gun control from the #NRA
@Michele_Henson lose what? Liberals have already won. You have @realDonaldTrump haha! He's to busy courting the  #LGBT community
@Michele_Henson I'm sure your biker gang respects that you don't strip for them anymore.
@Michele_Henson I hope all you right wing southern fatties die of diabetes soon. Our healthcare system could use the break
@Michele_Henson just like all you so called peaceful " Christians " name calling insults and intolerance
@Michele_Henson the FACT IS you don't need an AR-15 for home protection.
@Michele_Henson just like a short fused right winger to start name calling. Everyone who doesn't agree with you is dumb! Haha!
@Michele_Henson tell the parents of #SandyHook sorry. Nothing can be done accept arm teachers and get rid of gun free zones
@Michele_Henson the IRS doesn't buy our politicians the #NRA does. Gun sales are up 900% since 2008. Because of right wing fear tactics
@Michele_Henson gun shows? Plenty of footage of irresponsible gun sales on YouTube
@Michele_Henson there's a problem when 13 year olds can legally buy a gun. There's a problem when " no fly listers " can buy guns
@Michele_Henson  do you think seatbelt laws save lives?
@GeraldoRivera thank you for your common sense comments on #outnumbered hang in there, you are absolutely correct #guncontrolplease #foxnews
