@JohnBauters Hi Mayor! DM me and I'll link you with our political team.
The worst part of my job is when we lose a young person to gun violence. I'm sick of fighting it with one hand behind my back. Americans favor common-sense reform such as the bipartisan Mayors Against Illegal Guns framework. It won't fix everything but it will make us safer. https://t.co/u1qT8Hw0uB
What works best for me in South Bend is to focus on results and the concrete impacts of ideas. (That's also part of how health care went from being a political albatross in 2010 to our winning issue in 2016.) https://t.co/PydEHJIkk2
It's important and we shouldn't pretend otherwise. But the core of our platform shouldn't be about him, it should be about American everyday life. A good platform for 2020 is one that would make just as much sense in 2040 when this presidency has come and gone. https://t.co/03mEcd3NQq

Saddened to hear of the passing of @JohnDingell, a giant in the Congress who represented the Midwest well. (And whose mastery of Twitter showed it can be done at any age.) Thoughts are with @RepDebDingell and their family tonight.
South Bend's story shows that the Midwest can help show a new way forward for America, very different from those peddling the idea that our part of the country is absorbed in nostalgia and resentment. If our party ignores this part of the country, we will not succeed. https://t.co/tsCVaYAhkq
As you know, city leaders focus on results. Could you imagine a city government shutting down over a policy disagreement? It's unthinkable. After all, we deliver water, which you need in order to live. City government works in America because there's no other choice. https://t.co/mlQ4n23lAe

We can‚Äôt keep doing what we‚Äôve been doing, especially in Washington. We need something completely different. And that just might mean sending a mayor to the White House.
I mean no disrespect to the United States Congress, but that is a very different job. And I would argue that the country would be a better place if Congress looked more like the community of American mayors, not the other way around.

Our progress is hard-won. We must not go back to the days when South Bend would see 20 or more homicides in a year. And we dare not let up until the day comes when we get to zero. If you care, you can help.
Keeping violence from going back up--and driving it further down--requires action. The actions we have taken, and more to come.
I am sick of being notified of violent actions in our city. I am sick of prayers, press conferences, and platitudes. I am particularly sick of consoling parents burying children.
If you are commenting on social media about violence and safety in our community, I hope that means you are willing to take one of these steps, or another I didn't think to list, to help confront this issue. It's not just for government to handle; it's all hands on deck.
Specifically, you can: share info with law enforcement, join community anti-violence events, help recruit talented and diverse new officers, mentor local youth, support the Group Violence Intervention, host a community policing event, help Goodwill create alternatives, &amp; more.
Last year we lost nine residents to gun violence. Last night we lost the first this year: a 16-year-old boy. We continue to do everything we know how to end gun violence, even with a hand tied behind our back. This is an all-hands on deck issue. If you care, you can help.

@TheOnlyKAVIN Here you go! https://t.co/i6f7pvsqiy
Five thousand bucks from @dominos isn't going to cut it. We have tens of millions in unmet funding needs. We need a serious plan for funding the roads of the future--ideally one that also encourages climate security instead of penalizing it.
Given that we are now making electric vehicles in our state, you'd think we might want to encourage this sort of thing too. https://t.co/HtXEq6UbDf
To be fair, this is hardly unique to our state. But most states have some kind of offsetting incentive to encourage adoption of electric vehicles. https://t.co/emOkroirjo
But we all know this is not a long-term or sustainable plan, nor does it generate enough revenue to truly fund our roads. And mayors (who are held accountable for road conditions no matter what the state does to our funding) are looking for a better answer.
More logical would be finding a better way to pay for roads in this state. I crossed party lines to praise a GOP bill that adjusted the gas tax a couple years ago, because it helped us pay for repaving and repairs.
The theory here is this: our roads are funded with the gas tax. If you buy less gas, you pay less gas tax. Ergo, if you're burning less fuel, you should pay more. In its way, it's sort of logical. https://t.co/4LM2UYe6ul

For information on policing and safety in our city, visit the Transparency Portal here. And stay involved! https://t.co/tjIDqJrqIE
We count on residents to actively support youth mentorship, expanded opportunities for those in need, officer recruiting, and community-oriented policing. Everyone can do something to help keep our city safe.
We remain committed to the Group Violence Intervention and other measures that have made a big difference in keeping levels of violent crime here so much lower than when I was a child. But this is not just a law enforcement or government issue.
State and federal government will not come save us. In the absence of federal support for real reform, or common-sense gun safety policies at the state level, it falls to us as a community to continue driving down levels of gun violence through local action.
Last night, January 2nd, brought the year‚Äôs first gun violence injury in South Bend. 2018 shootings were down from 2017. We MUST force violence down further in 2019.

By a margin of many millions, Americans called for change--and we are beginning, but only beginning, to see it descend on Washington. The people can't be denied forever.
Yes, we are a republic--a democratic one. If we care about democracy, then we will always pay attention to the will of the people expressed by the majority of American voters.
It is the overall will of the American electorate. It didn't get its way altogether, but it's how the House came back into balance even in the face of nakedly manipulated districts.
Lots of frantic arm-waving on Twitter about how there's no such thing as a House/Senate popular vote. You bet there is, and it matters--that's why they're denying it so hard.
Remarkable gains for just two years, especially in the face of gerrymandering. But there are mountains yet to climb. https://t.co/S5qDaQBnry

For the rest: hopefully you were there in the trenches with us when we were confronting his worst policies here in Indiana. There will be more where that came from.
I often fought and disagreed with him. I also think certain patterns have arisen in his behavior since he became VP that are new and different from how he acted before. Subtlety isn't popular here on Twitter, but I think it's important to study these changes over time.
Many people here can't get their heads around the idea that someone could be homophobic, fanatical, and wrong, make terrible decisions, and also be sincere. Did he make horrible policy on HIV and many other matters? Yes. Did it destroy lives? Yes. Was it sincere? Yes.
For some reason this tweet is recirculating now. It was off, but I'm not deleting it because I don't believe in trying to erase prior (mis)statements. A couple thoughts for those who are jumping on this again...

That's going to cause some problems around here. https://t.co/qMQ62OcLzr
South Bend's (and America's) drop in violence compared to the 1990s didn't just happen on its own. It took sustained community action. Reversing the current trend toward younger victims will require the same. We must study what works and build on it. And everyone has a role.
If you are equally heartbroken by reports of gun violence, ask how you can be part of the solution. Mentor. Volunteer. Participate. Visit. Learn. Help.
But more than any one policy or program, we need community and cultural answers. All of us can help to break the cycles of isolation of the most at-risk (half a percent or so) young people who account for nearly all gun violence.
Even in a state that restricts us from locally enacting popular, constitutional, and evidence-based policies related to access to guns, we can (and do) act at the local level, from civilian street outreach to enforcement actions against violent groups.
We have worked to address violence through every known means, from law enforcement coordination to mentorship and employment support. Yet amid the routine statistical ups and downs, there is more and more heartbreak involving teenagers.
All gun violence is infuriating, but there is a deeper anguish when it involves young people. Our entire community has a role to play in breaking cycles of violence for those most at risk.

Like most competitive fields, it may be easier for the cynical, for those who cheat and resort to trickery. But we do not have to emulate them to outrun them. We just have to be smarter than we've been before in the digital space.
Much will depend on whether Democrats get better at social media as a tool for persuasion and for gathering feedback.
