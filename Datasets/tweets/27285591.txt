Donald Trump danced on the graves of RINOs! As any good God-loving country-loving Nationalist would. This morning when I saw the election results I said to my wife "Americans won 5 more Senate seats". MAGA. Still not tired of Winning!
Our President absolutely rocked tonight. Great speech. I, honestly don't know how how does it at his age. Heck, the guy barely sleeps, doesn't get paid, neither does his wife/kids/inlaws working for this country. It's amazing or ordained by God. Seriously! #MAGA
There is no longer a democratic party. There is a terror group that by next week could take the house and the Senate whose only goal is to destroy the USA, and they have so many people scammed and conned that they just might do it and Trump is not wasting a minute! #MAGA
President Trump is carrying the Republican party across the finish line via his coat tails! What a work horse we the people have in the White House! Thank you LORD for putting President Trump in the White House on November 8th, 2016! #MAGA
After all the talk by the Establishment Media about a ‚ÄòBlue Wave‚Äô that would crash across the country come Election Day and bring back Democrat control of Congress it seems millions of Republican voters are rallying behind the get out and vote call from President Donald Trump!
The mainstream media often denies accusations that they are in bed with the Dems, but this orchestrated smear of Kavanaugh proves it. NBC had no problem trafficking in uncorroborated accusations that put him in a bad light, but failed to report info that could help exonerate HIM!
So like, we're gonna listen to a high school dropout for political advice that impacts the future of America ... I don't think so LeBron. The only thing he's got going for him is athletic ability &amp; a small Brain! So keep on dribbling &amp; keep your empty-headed thoughts to yourself!

Serena act like a Lady! You violated the code of conduct, and the referee was just doing his job. Serena acted like a fool and ruined the day for Naomi Osaka. Her behavior was an embarrassment to women everywhere! Her hissy fit was gamesmanship; not a fight for women's rights!
Perhaps somebody should let Serena Williams know that women in the United States have more rights than all other women in the entire world. It sounds like she's fighting more for attention because her career is going south! Or perhaps struggling with gender-identity herself?
Serena mistakenly thought that she is a woman but in reality we don‚Äôt know..why else would she play the gender card? She may have lost a step or two on the court ... but her victim reflex is as fast as ever! Obama made this! Great role model fo rate kids Serena! #Pitiful #MAGA

Two funerals received national attention this week: Aretha Franklin‚Äôs and John McCain‚Äôs. President Trump did not attend either one yet was clearly inside the heads of those who did. Liberals and globalists infested both occasions....
If you didn't like the funeral for John McCain, you shouldn't have watched.		Did anyone think these seething, furious, crazed people would act like grownups? His daughter made an ass of herself.		Come on. They told Sarah Palin to stay home. Sad.
If you‚Äôve noticed a flood of stories in the press recently about a new fad among black people called ‚Äúhandiblackin‚Äô,‚Äù you‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs a craze that many see as exemplifying everything that‚Äôs wrong with the black community.	 https://t.co/rgFZ81LX7B

War Hero(LOL) John McStain should let John Brennan drape his coffin with an ISIS flag....		Funny how Mcstain‚Äôs ISIS fighters are all dead or heading back to Europe. Mileikowski might have to send IDF to the Golan. Democrat &amp; GOPe America honors the dead of the USS Liberty &amp; USMC!
War heroes do not betray their own dead by covering up what happened to them like the McCains did to the USS Liberty. It was McCain's father who stood down the US defense of the ship under orders from McNamara and Johnson. Traitors, all three!

CNN, MSNBC, NYT and other MSM outlets can claim they are not the "enemy of the people," but they have declared war on millions of Americans, good people who support the POTUS which does make them the enemy! #MAGA
By the media we see inaccurate stories, unprecedented amounts of articles having to be corrected, edited, retracted and in some cases rewritten or deleted. Attacks against over 60+ mil Americans, which has already incited tremendous levels of harassment against Trump supporters!
From the day President Trump announced his candidacy, the media has labeled anyone that supported President Trump or simply opposed a Hillary Clinton presidency as homophobic, Islamophobic, racists, Nazis, white supremacists, and "deplorables." .....

Realize that the only cogent thing the DNC has expressed as a policy is "We hate Trump, and we want to give everybody everything they could want at someone else's expense."		Blue Wave. Yeah. Right.		More likely a big #walkaway...

If you take it ill when Islamists blow you up in the name of their nasty little god, you're Islamophobic. If you know that a man is a man even if he says he's a woman, you're transphobic. If you think it's fair to debate whether homosexual actions are moral you're homophobic!
If you believe your country should vet its immigrants, you're racist. If you voted for Donald Trump, you're racist. If you make a joke about Barack Obama on Facebook, you're racist twice. If you think motherhood is a woman's highest calling, you're sexist.........#MAGA #tcot
The fact is, having a group of people scream at you and denigrate you is exactly what it feels like to be in America ‚Äî if you don't happen to be a coastal elite. It has felt this way for the last twenty years with Every Talking head in the country telling us we suck every day!

I can only hope Sessions is one of the "talk softly but carry a big stick" types. In other words, I hope he has quietly built a rock solid case against the Deep State and will reveal it as soon as he's finished.		If not, then he will go down in History as the biggest POS ever!
Every one of these Traitors should have been removed the day Trump assumed office. Anyone left over from the terrorist reign of the Kenyan Clown should be permanently erased. I just can't understand why these folks still have clearance. Still waiting for Sleeping Beauty.....
I think Trump is waiting for the midterms and then Sessions is history. Rosenstein too. Sessions was a great senator but a lousy AG. I couldn't be more disappointed.

The DNC/Hillary paid CrowdStrike $500,000. The CrowdStrike report is probably as valid as Steele's dossier that they also paid for. Why would the DNC deny the FBI access to the unsecured server and then pay CrowdStrike $500,000 to do what the FBI would've done for FREE?

Demented Democrats and RINOs would be funny if they weren't so dangerous. Obama and Hillary gave the Russians everything, including Crimea, but now President Trump is the one who is weak on Russia? No wonder President Trump keeps on WINNING.
Trump and over half of Americans don't believe leftists like Strzok and his fellow Democrats and Russian leftists who fabricated an "investigation" to attack Trump. Hillary broke the law with a private server to her big surprise, her fellow leftists in Russia hacked her!
To all the morons claiming Trump caved, I would remind them of another Republican president, Ronald Reagan, who said during his visit to Moscow in 1988 that the Soviet Union was no longer an evil empire.
If Trump had confronted Putin during the press conference, the news media would have claimed that Trump was admitting his election was illegitimate.		Trump didn't play their game, which is why they've gone off the deep end -- again.
