David Ortiz walked in 8th inning. Pinch runner came in. Ortiz left to thunderous applause in maybe his last MLB game and I finally felt old.
Two people running for President of the United States. 90 minutes listening to both. Not a single word or phrase of inspiration.
Major League Baseball has to revisit replay. 2nd base call reversals now getting ridiculous.
Great moments in presidential campaign history: "I did try and fuck her.She was married." Donald J. Trump, quoted in New York Times.
Trump and Dominique Strauss Khan.That would be some ticket. Global grabbing.
We live in a country/culture where now you don't want your children reading/listening to news about a presidential campaign. Amazing.
How come Paul Ryan doesn't realize that by sticking with Trump he is doing to his future what Trump thought he could do to any woman?
