Every day this crime family remains propped up as an American President and his aides is a day Americans lose to a lie.
Lastly, after reading the whole transcript it's clear Junior's goose is cooked. Gleefully accepting campaign contributions from a foreign adversary is, like, a something burger. And when that bird brain chirps, they're all dust. This is bad.
It's still stunning to me that Graham and Grassley made a recommendation for criminal charges against Steele, who for all intent and purposes is the whistle blower of Russiagate and not the cheat who conned his way into the White House. Unbelievable.
But now because he's POTUS there's a hyper-partisan conspiracy to protect a crime family at all costs because they're a Republican crime family.
Third is how obviously untrustworthy trump is. He's not a billionaire. His properties are all in debt, not profitable and suspiciously financed by foreign money. He lies about everything and acts in bad faith as his everyday MO.
Second was how flummoxed two professionals like Simpson and Steele were by the behavior of the FBI before and after the election. Just like the rest of us.
There are several interesting nuggets from the Fusion GPS testimony: 		One is that prior to Aug. 2016 someone in either the Trump Org or campaign went to the FBI with their concerns. This isn't Bannon and not Papadopoulos.

According to #fireandfury using millions of taxpayers‚Äô lives as leverage for a racist boondoggle is Jarvanka‚Äôs brilliant idea. https://t.co/0Dfb8VtD1i
The title of #fireandfury could have easily been Consciousness of Guilt.
Besides proving no one in DC likes, respects or thinks Trump is smart and most importantly is no longer afraid to say so on the record, it also lays out a strong case for obstruction of justice.
Jared and Ivanka come off as farcically stupid. It seems like slander or satire until you realize it‚Äôs all well-documented and corroborated by several sources: They‚Äôre literally too stupid to know how incapable they are of not being stupid.
The Access Hollywood tape quote in the book was the most unbelievable to me. It just didn‚Äôt seem possible that a candidate would ever say that out loud with a mic on and I‚Äôve SEEN THE TAPE.
The only way #fireandfury seems credible or plausible is because we‚Äôve all been watching this slowly unfold.
Yes, Fargo: A movie about the downfall of greedy stupid criminals who all end up turning on each other.
My fav detail in #fireandfury is when the POTUS, Jarvanka and comms people on Air Force were cooking up a false story about Junior‚Äôs June Russia meeting, Miller, McMaster, Powell and Cohn were feet away unaware and watching the film Fargo.
As if to say, I‚Äôm fine with the rape, lies, treason, criminal nepotism and the Nazi fanboyism HOWEVER a POTUS with dementia is a concern.
The whole mental fitness question sidesteps the myriad of reasons trump is unfit to be president: Corruption, contempt for most of humanity, malignant stupidity, and the whole sexual assaulting dozens of women.
