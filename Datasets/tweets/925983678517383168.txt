@Thomas_ETHN @AbelAbadi I believe in facts and logic. And whoever vows to support my beliefs will get my ‘alignment’. I don’t have eternal commitment with anyone.
@BrownDykeman @TalbertSwan Nop. It’s not only power. It begins in your mind. That’s the potential racism and it manifests whenever you get the opportunity. Black or white!

@Thomas_ETHN @AbelAbadi That’s ridiculous. I dug my positions in life even before I knew what politics was. I support decriminalizing marijuana. The Democratic party’s war on drugs led by Clinton in the 90s locked up blacks like no other. It left black communities fatherless.

@solina30 Yesterday was sickening... The Democrats blocked the Born Alive Act. Meaning, if a doctor attempted to abort a baby and in case he/she survived and is delivered, the abortionist can finish the job even after that!
@AbelAbadi @Thomas_ETHN Yes, also banning homicide clearly didn’t eradicate it. Same goes to robery, rape, drugs... But it sure did minimized the damage a whole lot and held the victimizers accountable to face justice... And oh boy, did that make our lives better...
@AbelAbadi @Thomas_ETHN Saying ‘it’s a lie’ won’t change the fact. Yes, baby organs are being sold. Refer to the latest Supreme Court ruling on the case. Plus, pack of condom is $3, the government isn’t responsible to subsidize that. Man up, get a job and use protection.
Ladies and Gentlemen, you can now kill babies even after they’re born. The US senate granted you the right... Anyone remember the days of Moses and Jesus...

You can’t undo the crime of rape by killing the innocent child!
@Thomas_ETHN you with a serious damage. You could lose a limb, over all health or even death. You can’t make the ‘wrongs’ of rape ‘right’ by committing a murder on another innocent life. Why do we have to choose between the mother and the baby when it’s clearly not necessary. Why not both?!
@Thomas_ETHN That’s not even the case. I don’t think I need to repeat the statistics. 42 million children globally, and 1 million in the US were killed in 2018 only. Rape and Incest are the covers to those heinous acts. As for your comment about the rape, any violence towards you might leave

@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA definitely say that she has a lot to reconsider!!! 		I would also like to know what @RNesrudin thinks about it... 15
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA and helplessness within women, let alone strife and cynicism against all men which in turn situates men on the defensive.... In general she touched a lot of subjects in a very short time, most of it which is flawed and ill informed. I can’t speak for her intentions but I can 14
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA act like victims and how they should blame particularly men for their failures. Women aren’t victims (at least not differently from men). It’s not an “oppression marathon”. There’s no prize for the most victimized group of people. This also subconsciously creates inferiority 13
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA in the bedroom of two voluntarily consummated individuals as long as they’re not of any danger to anyone. But am very sure our culture will purge it out (at least for now). 12. Women don’t need to be taught victimhood and how to live and 12
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA ignored. Even the infamous Roe V. Wade was based on a lie, which resulted to the death of 60 million plus children so far in the US alone. 11. Homosexuality isn’t the best lifestyle to follow, in every measurement of its benefits to society but government shouldn’t be allowed 11
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA fatality and so on. Men are abused and exploited in a significantly higher rates (that of course by no means undermines women’s tragedy). 10. Many women cry rape (again open to interpretation - unsatisfying sex isn’t rape) to get abortion. And that’s not something to be 10
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA evolution of human race. Men are primary victims of war. Men don’t go to battlefields just because they enjoy being dead. 9. Yes, it’s extremely tragic for women to be harmed, abused or harassed but men still take the large portion of homicide, suicide, work place fatality, war 9
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA that these men whom she pointed her fingers at are raised by women. So that argument won’t work. Additionally, nobody can guarantee an equality of outcome. We should be aiming for equality of opportunities. 8. Men went to war to protect women and children through out the 8
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA babies are girls. If you’re going to stand for women, you should stand for all. Plus being pro women shouldn’t be or sound like anti men. 7. Men shouldn’t be targeted and aren’t to be blamed for the failure of society. Society failed society. And it must also be kept in mind 7
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA society, the sanctity of every life should be respected and valued, whether they’re in hospital, prison or womb. The innocent baby shouldn’t pay for the crimes of a rapist psychopath. 6. Advancing abortion rights isn’t elevating women’s rights. Statistically half of the aborted 6
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA This modern progressive movement isn’t definitely what we need now (Not as a solution, Not as a problem). 5. Abortion ends a human life. Whatever the condition or reason is, it ends a life. That’s a fact. Is it morally correct or not is another question. As a progressed 5
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA gender or so on (Lady Justice is blind for a reason!). And that somehow makes her biased and prejudiced. 4. She’s literally copying from the radical liberal playbook. She didn’t touch on many original issues as she should have. Realistic issues that concern both men and women. 4
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA driver behind this sexual revolution and liberty (which is completely the opposite and mostly keeps people in a bondage of sexual promiscuity) 3. Meaza isn’t appointed to solely serve women. She’s employed to cater justice for everyone in Ethiopia regardless of race, religion, 3
@geluemu @nigigebi @AmanuelTilA @BirukitawitA to be celebrated as marriage is a fundamental social fabric for a society to thrive. 2. Radical feminism exists.

@widlits @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl 99.3% of all abortions are of convenience, not from rape or incest. The baby’s right to life supersedes the mothers right to convenience.
@JTRhuntress @JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Yes, it’s being used as a birth control. 42 million children were eliminated through abortions last year. That’s scary. They deserve the right to live!!!
@JenObie @JTRhuntress @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl No, you don’t have a free will to kill some one. If you’re religious, yes, God is completely against killing the innocent. The government is telling me what to do with my body when they hinder me from stabbing someone, it’s not different than that. You’re not allowed to kill!!!
@JTRhuntress @JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Good for them. What’s your point?
@JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Well, let’s fix the adoption laws and more importantly women shouldn’t make them if they don’t want to have them in the first place. Why not use contraceptives? And if you do make them, you should man up and raise them, just like everybody else.
@JTRhuntress @JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl That’s not what the ruling implied. But anyone’s life supersedes her convenience. Legal doesn’t mean right!
@JenObie @JTRhuntress @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl 😂 Do you hear yourself?! How’s ‘Everybody’s life, liberty and property should be protected’ messed up???
@JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Yes, I love kids. And I do my best to help others. But killing the babies isn’t the bright way to help them!
@JenObie @JTRhuntress @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl I don’t care about her God. And I don’t care about how she chooses to live her life. All I care is that the life, liberty and property of everybody to be respected and protected, including the babies’.
@spudgun2 @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Killing is never a right. The baby’s right to life supercedes the women’s right to convenience.
@JillyIdris @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl 99.3% of all abortions is of convenience. What about some compassion for the baby?
@jezusgurl55 @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Including the babies in the womb.
@JenObie @JTRhuntress @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl I don’t. 1) Morally 2)Financially
@JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Incest or rape constitute 0.7% of all abortion cases. The rest 99.3% are of convenience.
@JenObie @JTRhuntress @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl We need the men to stay and take care of their wife and children. And the women not to kill their babies.
@JTRhuntress @spacecowlady @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl I did. I have done my research very well. The baby and the mother are two different people. Am sorry you had to go through that but it doesn’t add merit on the discussion.
@JenObie @JTRhuntress @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl It’s not okay to walk out. And we should hold men who walk out equally accountable as those women who perform abortions. It’s not a matter of gender but sanctity of life!
@JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Where are their mothers too? Nobody is exempted from facing problems. But adding on that and killing the innocent isn’t justifiable.
@JTRhuntress @MissJenn22673 @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl 1) It is a life. Not different than someone on life support. 2) I am a survivor too, and I sympathize with rape. Yet punishing the child for the crime of a psychopath isn’t right. 99.3% of all abortion is out of convenience. 3) Your children are equally valuable as those aborted!
@Yohannes_v 😂 That works, I guess.
@JTRhuntress @JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl The baby’s right to live supercedes your right to convenience. That’s fundamental. And nobody forced you to get pregnant. You have ample choice but killing a baby isn’t one of them.
@JTRhuntress @JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Lol, Who forced you to open your legs?! You can choose to abstain, use contraceptives, give birth or give up for adoption. But not to kill the baby. If you don’t want them, don’t make them!
@SenGillibrand You’re infringing the baby’s right to live. That’s the most fundamental and supersedes your right to convenience.

@JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl 😂😂 You must be kidding me. Men have been paying to support both for the child and wife for ages. And that’s not a valid reason to kill the baby.
@StarLindy @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Who are you to choose for the child to live or die?!
@RobsMuir @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Where’s your black skin to talk about slavery?
@peggy_pless @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl You’re not doing the kids any favor by killing them either. In fact it’s worse, you’re denying them a choice to live.
@JenObie @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl Give the children a choice. Most will make it. Killing them isn’t an option!
@spacecowlady @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl The baby’s body is not your body!!!
@MissJenn22673 @EdKrassen @JacobAWohl If you don’t want them, don’t make them. Killing them is never an option.
@EdKrassen @JacobAWohl 99.3% of all abortions are of convenience, completely not necessary for the health of the mother or child.

@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan The Republican Party was created on 1854, Abraham Lincoln as the first President. He abolished slavery. The drafted the emancipation proclamation. And after the civil war they passed the 13, 14, and 15 th amendment with 100% Republican and almost 0% Democrat support...

@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan That’s the truth. You can repeat that all you want. Not a single Republican owned a slave. All the 4 million slaves were held by the Democrats. They were against the 13, 14 and 15 th amendment. Party of Jim Crow and segregation. They know it. It’s a fact!
@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan 😂 why are you afraid of the facts. They Democrats don’t care about black people. They want you to stay dependent on them. They think your stupid because they can get your votes with some food stamps. You opening your eyes is their night mare. Am not kissing anybody’s ass tho...

Just look at all the black neighborhoods (which are led by Democrats)... They opposed the freedom, citizenship and voting rights of black people. They’re enemy.
@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan The sole reason for the creation of the Republican Party was to abolish slavery on 1854.
@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan And the more the south became a Republican, the less racism among them. And the blacks were originally Republicans. They supported the party of Lincoln and emancipation proclamation until they were promised free stuff and welfare by the Democrats. They were even sad to leave...
@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan Thanks for the advice but I did my research well.
@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan Nop. No single Republican owned a slave. Not one, through out the country. All the 4 million slaves were held by the Democrats.
@adoseofmyvibes @MalkiTzedek_ @DaemonHarret @TalbertSwan No single dixiecrat joined the Republican Party. Not one. Some Democrats from the Anti - Slavery North switched but not the dixiecrats... The Democratic Party was and still is the party of racism.
