@SABRbioproject You are looking for Barry Larkin stories. Here's mine. I'm a Reds fan who lived in Chicago. A friend had season tickets and would give me tickets when the Reds came to town. The tickets were great; second row off the visitor's on-deck circle. (1/4)
@SABRbioproject In extra innings, Barry was on-deck in the 11th and I said, "Barry, I'm going to have to ask you for another hit." He cracked up right there. He got another hit. The Reds later won in the 13th, an inning in which the Cubs intentionally walked Barry. (3/4)
@SABRbioproject Here's the box from the game: https://t.co/V4m1iRe8wx	(4/4)
@SABRbioproject In the ninth, the Reds were down 1-0 and I said to Barry (now 0-3 and on-deck) loud enough for him to hear, "Barry, I need a hit." He said under his breath, "I need one, too." Well, he got a double and evened the score. (2/4)
