When it comes to cannabis, both young and old benefit greatly with cannabis oils and tinctures or edibles for serious diseases, even among those who don’t have serious life-threatening diseases who smoke or vape the bud
If there is such a thing as a gateway drug, alcohol would be just that. It is also much more unhealthy than cannabis.  But unlike marijuana, it really doesn’t have much medicinal value. And it leads to more violent activity and reckless driving accidents than  marijuana use.

Yeah, it raises some questions, all right. Like: When is Congress going to get the lead out and fund the wall that 60 million Americans voted to build?
“Paying for so many births to immigrant mothers may make sense, but the large share who can’t provide for themselves without the help of American taxpayers raises the question of whether our current immigration system makes sense.”
going to pay for people who aren’t citizens, who broke our laws, and who don’t actually belong in this country. You want to what? Build a wall?? What a waste of money!!	CIS Research Director Steven Camarota told the Examiner,
That part of the analysis is shocking in and of itself. Oh, welfare? Illegal immigrants can’t get that. Oh, Medicaid? Illegals aren’t eligible for that. But…yeah, welfare and Medicaid kick in for this problem or that problem. No biggie. It’s just taxpayer money.
Though some mothers without insurance may not even realize the program has paid health care providers. Illegal immigrants and most new legal immigrants are ineligible for Medicaid, but the program will still cover the cost of delivery and post-partum care for these mothers .
Technically, illegal immigrants are not eligible for welfare services. But the report explained, “Medicaid will pay for a delivery in almost all cases if the mother is uninsured or has a low income,

National Legal and Policy Center: 	Today, NLPC filed a Complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) violated federal election law in a transaction related to her so-called slate mailer during her last re-election campaign.
Waters looks to have enriched those closest to her through some shady campaign schemes. It will be interesting to see whether she is held accountable or not.
As well as political gain. Among the former officials in danger of losing their access are former CIA Director John Brennan, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and former national security advisor Susan Rice.Why do they still have them?🤔
President Trump, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, is mulling over the possibility of stripping several top Obama administration officials of their security clearances over concerns that they are abusing their access for purposes of financial gain
