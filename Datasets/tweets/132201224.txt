@Aine These provisions will start in January of 2014. They can apply for the exchanges October 1!
@Niuncentav0 The short answer is yes, everyone must get insurance through their job or the exchanges. Stay tuned for the long answer!
@_Middleman Ideally, everyone should be able to afford insurance (w/subsidies if need be) through the exchanges starting 1/1/2014.
@Aine Your friends can sign up here: http://t.co/64ctItGwBm
@Aine Exchanges will open October 1 and they will be a one-stop-shop. If you qualify for any subsidies they will direct you.
@Aine Are you in Washington State?

.@VegetaHimura As I replied to a similar comment, there are those of us in Congress who will bitterly fight to make sure it's not derailed.
Well said on Obama speech. RT @sparksjls Smart, detailed, honest and compelling. Let's make it happen. #futurewewant
So, speech is wrapped up, what are your thoughts?
RT @RepWeiner: We are a great nation.  This is a speech and a fight that honors our ideals.  Lets embrace this fight.
"I believe that somewhere lost in this quagmire of petty bickering on every news station, the ‘American Dream’ is still alive…" Powerful.
POTUS: "This sense of responsibility – to each other and to our country – this isn’t a partisan feeling...  It’s patriotism." Well said.
POTUS: "we have to use a scalpel and not a machete to reduce the deficit"
@Sprattymaggie well, be assured there are those of us who will fight bitterly to try to make sure it does.
Recap of Obama speech so far: Reduce spending by, 1) "tough cuts" 2) lower defense spending 3) control health care costs 4) reform taxes
POTUS: "limiting itemized deductions for the wealthiest 2% of Americans... [to] reduce the deficit by $320 billion over ten years"
POTUS: "I will not allow Medicare to become a voucher program... with a shrinking benefit to pay for rising costs." #thankgoodness
POTUS: "Our [Democrats'] approach lowers the government’s health care bills by reducing the cost of health care itself."
POTUS: "Repub plan could not be clearer... lowers the govt’s health care bills by asking seniors and poor families to pay them instead."
@Republic1st I pick humans every time. Can we really afford not to?
POTUS: "There’s nothing courageous about asking for sacrifice from those who can least afford it and don’t have any clout on Capitol Hill."
POTUS: GOP says, "10 yrs from now, if you’re a 65 year old who’s eligible for Medicare, you... pay nearly $6,400 more than you would today"
Obama: Ryan's #roadtoruin "would lead to a fundamentally different America" that is "deeply pessimistic."

Paul Ryan’s ballyhooed “Path to Prosperity” is really a path to a less educated America, a less healthy America, and an unemployed America.
Budgets are a statement of priorities. The GOP's current priorities? Subsidizing Big Oil. Ending Medicare. Cutting education. Jobs? Nowhere.
