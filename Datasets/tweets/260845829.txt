@brianros1 @gelliottmorris @HotlineJosh Yes, that one.
@arjavrawal @HotlineJosh @gelliottmorris @brianros1 In 2010 in PA and Ohio, 8 purple district Dems voted for ACA, while 3 voted against it. The 8 that voted for it all lost in 2010, while the 3 who voted against it all survived the wave. Draw your own conclusions.
@arjavrawal @HotlineJosh @gelliottmorris @brianros1 As a general rule, I don‚Äôt let that one go unanswered very often. üòâ
@arjavrawal @HotlineJosh @gelliottmorris @brianros1 Gerrymandering in 2012 is what cost me, not ACA in 2010. I won 70% of the 2012 primary vote in the portion of the district I had represented. In fact, my vote against ACA is what saved me in 2010 when I survived the national wave üåä üèÑ üåä
@gelliottmorris @HotlineJosh @brianros1 Tell that to Dave McCurdy. Candidates can definitely disqualify themselves based on one policy especially on social issues. I don‚Äôt know if single payer is it in those CA districts, but one issue definitely can be the difference. That‚Äôs what polling, direct mail, etc is all about
@HotlineJosh @gelliottmorris @brianros1 Indeed. There are endless examples of incumbents losing their seats over a single policy or vote, i.e. 2010 &amp; 1994. Even more applicable for candidates who disqualify themselves in campaigns due to a policy position out of step with the district.

@DavidMDrucker @HotlineJosh If you are a candidate running in a closed primary, you work to appeal only to the partisan extremes who vote. To win in top-two, candidates must appeal to much more ideologically diverse electorate.
@HotlineJosh Top-two is a good reform that limits the influence of the extremes in elections. More states should use that process. Parties have to adjust their messaging and tactics to avoid being locked out as in a those California districts.

@GretngsFrmEarth @morningmika @Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle @WillieGeist The problem is, even in fairly drawn competitive districts, the parties are still likely to nominate candidates from the extremes, so the choice in the general election is between two highly partisan candidates.

@ningrim - Money flows both ways, to/from insurers. CBO says $8B more goes from insurers to gov't because HC costs lower than expected.
Yes, one of the things I don't miss. "@JonDelano: @jasonaltmire We miss you up here, Jason, but I bet you don't miss this winter weather!‚Äù
@DavidMDrucker - Agree on both points. Still, ironic that GOP's top potential DL sweetener adds to the debt.
