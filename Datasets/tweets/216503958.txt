Joe heard from insurers currently offering coverage on Indiana’s individual marketplace &amp; patient groups that are concerned with challenges they are facing due to actions by the Admin and some in Congress. https://t.co/O1IttRxl1h
This could return us to the days when folks with diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and asthma, for example, could again face the possibility of being denied health insurance coverage.
The Administration argued in a federal court brief that protections for pre-existing conditions should be ruled unconstitutional.
Earlier this year, the Administration proposed short-term “junk” plans, which would undermine market stability and allow insurers to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions and charge older folks more.
This comes as the Administration continues efforts to sabotage our health care system, and independent analyses have found these actions in addition to those by some in Congress could result in possible rate hikes of 20 percent.
Today, insurers offering health care to Hoosiers on the individual marketplace for 2019 are expected to file their proposed plans.

A new analysis by @AARP shows the Administration's efforts to sabotage the health care markets will lead to higher premiums for older Hoosiers.Premiums for a 60-year-old Hoosier are projected to rise by nearly 20% in 2019 – an increase of more than $1,600. https://t.co/pP5SeV7SPv https://t.co/KQazZutpcK

Joe has fought for communities devastated by the opioid crisis &amp; is proud this bipartisan budget bill includes $4 billion dollars to combat the opioid epidemic, some of which will go to Indiana.
Among those measures is a provision based on his bipartisan ‘Strengthening the Addiction Treatment Workforce Act’ to address the shortage of substance use disorder treatment providers by providing funding for a student loan forgiveness program.
After pushing for more resources to combat the opioid epidemic, Joe was successful in securing several provisions in the bipartisan budget bill that would benefit Indiana.
With the inclusion of Joe’s bill, farmers would be able to avoid spending their time and money on reports that will go unused by EPA.
Second, Joe secured his and Senator Fischer’s bipartisan FARM Act, which will prevent farmers from being required to file needless, burdensome reports to EPA.
First, is a fix to the “grain glitch” in the McConnell-Ryan tax bill, which was putting family businesses at risk of going out of business. The fix will restore a level playing field for grain buyers.
Joe secured several provisions important to Indiana's ag community in the bipartisan budget bill.

The McConnell-Ryan tax bill has led to a windfall for Wall Street. According to an expert tracking market &amp; economic data, “the buyback boom is one sign that the tax cut is likely to do far more for business owners &amp; investors than the typical household.” https://t.co/DKmhQurJHk

Despite gridlock in Congress, this is an issue where we have a solid bipartisan consensus. - Joe
These numbers illustrate the simple, terrible fact that we are losing too many of our servicemembers and veterans to suicide. -Joe
We are painfully aware of the statistic that an estimated 20 veterans a day take their own lives. - Joe
In 2015, 475 servicemembers took their own lives. Prior to that we lost 443 servicemembers in 2014 and 474 servicemembers in 2013. -Joe
