Law enforcement in sanctuary cities believes in community policing. Trump wants to cut funds that keep those communities safe. #NoBanNoWall
Law enforcement officers in sanctuary cities choose to arrest dangerous criminals &amp; protect the public. Trump doesn‚Äôt trust their judgment.
Trump‚Äôs executive orders are an attack on all immigrant communities. We stand united against anti-immigrant policies. #NoBanNoWall
America was founded on principles of religious freedom. Targeting Muslim immigrants sets a dangerous precedent. #NoBanNoWall
Border communities know a #WallofHate is a bad investment. Passing immigration reform is the best way to fix our system. #NoBanNoWall
A border wall is a $25 billion symbol of hate and fear. #NoBanNoWall
Immigration reform would create $700 billion in economic growth for our economy. A #WallofHate is bad economics. #NoBanNoWall
