Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is portrayed as on the cutting edge of American politics. The fake news media presents it as only a matter of time before she takes over the United States. But her world collapsed when she got this awful news. Busted.
@NRA @USCCA 250 years ago, it was the British coming to get your guns, now it‚Äôs the New Jersey State Police. A new law makes it illegal to possess a magazine in excess of 10-rounds, and the state has not ruled out anything to enforce this draconian law.
Nancy Pelosi gets pushed to drop This Muslim congresswoman. She's one of the new members of Congress who happens to be Muslim and is already a lightning rod for controversy. Now, the speaker of the U.S. House is being pressed to purge this Democrat Traitor.
President Donald Trump‚Äôs enemies just got some really bad news. One of the President‚Äôs biggest rivals is locked up in a growing crisis. And it includes a bombshell sex scandal that could cause this top Trump critic to resign.
The Nancy Pelosi-led House of Representatives passed gun control measures H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 largely along party lines this week. However, a surprise procedural move by a Republican prior to the passage of H.R. 8 underscored the deep divisions in the Democratic Party.
Just how close is the government getting to reading your thoughts? Unfortunately, they may be getting very close. New research in rats shows that scientists can now read their thoughts and predict their actions.
UpChuck Schumer could not believe what happened. The Democrat leader in the Senate thought the stars had aligned to finally deliver a devastating blow to President Donald Trump. But Schumer ended up with an egg on his face after this historic defeat.

Screaming Elizabeth Warren royally flubbed her presidential campaign by releasing the DNA test proving she wasn‚Äôt an Indian. Now, another Democrat presidential candidate is facing a public relations nightmare that could end her campaign.
The shutdown showdown taught us one thing: President Trump is fighting a two-front battle against congressional Democrats on one side and liberal Republicans on the other. Sadly, too many Republicans cannot be counted on to oppose liberal policies.
The Democrats are mobilizing to stymie the President‚Äôs action to secure our southern border. Instead of working to keep our nation safe, they want to obstruct, investigate, resist and impeach.
Kamala Harris is one of the strongest Democrats running for president. Many on the left think she can defeat President Trump. But Harris‚Äô campaign just fell off a cliff with this outrageous claim. Who is even listening to this Fool?
For months, Nancy Pelosi told Democrats she planned to wait for Robert Mueller‚Äôs final report before starting impeachment proceedings. Now the Speaker of the House is left scrambling. That‚Äôs because Mueller was caught in a lie that turned Senile Pelosi‚Äôs plans upside down.
An English Professor at UC Davis tweeted on Nov. 27, 2014, ‚ÄúI am thankful that every living cop will one day be dead, some by their own hand, some by others, too many of old age.‚Äù
President Donald Trump put Sen. Richard Blumenthal on blast on Wednesday over his misstatements related to his service in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. ‚ÄúI have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, third rate Senator from Connecticut,‚Äù
The anti-Trump media spent months building up to this one day where Mueller would put his cards on the table and expose Donald Trump for the criminal that they believed him to be. But then Robert Mueller took all the wind out of the Democrats‚Äô sails with this stunning confession.
