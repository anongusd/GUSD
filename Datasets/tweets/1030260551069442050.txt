@GOPLeader Nunes discussed things from the house  committee with trump.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I don't care if he lied - that doesn't discredit him as a source.  I don't cared if he told the truth - that doesn't make me believe him.  None of what he said, or the GOP/DEM response matters.  Only what can be proved via evidence &amp; an investigation matters.  The rest is noise.
@RepMarkMeadows All good points - but does that make him wrong?
@LindseyGrahamSC Or DEM and GOP lawmakers who are in the counties this crisis is suppose to be happening.
@TheHogSty No.   This year is already severely handicapped due to the QB situation dollar wise.  All we can hope to do is be smart and cost efficient in draft and free agency and try to continue to build the team if not for this year then next.
@realDonaldTrump They could not be treated worse then how they have been under your administration
@marklevinshow So your saying that the they are wrong?
@RepMattGaetz you do realize that was a couple years ago and the investigation has gone a lot farther since then
@joncoopertweets not from jail
@Nunyabus99999 @HouseGOP @GOPLeader @RepKevinBrady @ChuckGrassley I understand the concept,  but I don't think its that simple.  Your right though - we will know and I think it will be sooner than later.
@Nunyabus99999 @HouseGOP @GOPLeader @RepKevinBrady @ChuckGrassley We can debate why the economy is doing better - but my real question is how does "business increases" translate to government revenue for paying down the "debt"?  The Tax Reform act caused $1Trillion in debt.
@thehill Thats because they can put her out there as the poster girl for positions many disagree with and make her seem as the representative of today's Democratic party.  Continuation of their misleading narrative that the Dem Party has become very far left and socialistic.
@HouseGOP @GOPLeader @RepKevinBrady @ChuckGrassley The impact to american corporations and individuals will be spinned by both sides - but I focus on the debt.  How much debt did this tax reform bill cause and what were there plans for dealing with it.  That should not be too hard to answer.
@N1ckyBluEyes @RepMarkMeadows I find it really funny just how man asshats come out of the woodwork just because I misread a tweet. You all need to get a life.
@justicetime @RepMarkMeadows Wow I misread a tweet - but at least I am not a fucking dickhead searching for comments on twitter so I can make a smart ass comment to feel good about myself.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Well, pick the one who basically does everything to make Putin happy?
@RepMarkMeadows Wait...you find the fact that they say they will accept the report a "bad" thing?  I guess to the GOP accepting what a proper investigation comes out with would seem weird.   Now, how about you and your GOP buddies say the same thing?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Whats worse a person who does bad things because he loses his temper or someone whose constant state of behavior and dealing with people is insulting and degrading, and shows a general poor attitude towards people in general?
@vincentdonofrio Will the Disney streaming service pick them up?
@GOP You want people to think  DEMS will be pushing a FARLEFT agenda when thats not true. Just because a few are raising approaches which you categorize as socialism doesn't mean they will get through congress without change &amp; it definitely is not representative of the DEM party.
@SethAbramson and if you are someone who pushes the "no evidence of collusion" message as if that has any significance - do the same. Unless Mueller says it (and he won't till the end) its just GOP driven smoke and mirrors.
@DemWrite @LindseyGrahamSC the spin on this is almost criminal.  i expect the FBI to  consider certain things that are brought to their attention. they paint common responsibilities  as having some sort of nefarious intention.  truth is if FBI wanted to scuttle Trump election they could have easily.
@StevieVanZandt A great movie.....seeing this tweet 18hours after you posted it....but I am going to dig up the DVD right now.   The BIG "W"...I'm comin mama!!!  My sunday is now complete.
@bigleaguepol without evidence?  I can't believe anyone who shills for trump can make that claim on others with a straight face.
@1950usher If you thought the Democrats were going to stick to that your crazy. They said all that just to give illusion they were giving something up.  They didn't care about giving him $$$ - they just didn't want to give him what he was asking. They gave same amount they offered before.
@bigleaguepol Instead of a rally - how about a debate.  A debate between the trump/gop narrative of "facts" vs the presses "facts".  How bout we do that instead of this crap.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump If this is true, why is GOP still enabling him? Shouldn't they be pushing back and trying to position others to run against him for the GOP nominee?  I keep waiting for that to happen - but its like they still think he has a chance.  Or is there is some different agenda at play?
@SethAbramson He won't pardon him untill he is leaving office.

@wizphyl @Nat47974305 @seanhannity @SaraCarterDC @GreggJarrett 1.  Read the scope of the investigation - the priority was to look at russia interference in election. 2. you have no idea how I feel about the clintons. 3. whether clintons were or were not investigated or did anything has nothing to do with this.
@GeraldoRivera Agree
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC @GreggJarrett I really don't understand these comments. When the investigation has 100% found some of the things it was suppose to investigate, how can you, or anyone, can call it a fraud? There was more to this than "collusion" and they have found proof of things that took place.
@jtylerconway Deflate Gate II
@realDonaldTrump You left out the word "Direct" which makes a big difference and forgot to mention that they have no interviewed many people of interest in the course of their investigation - so might want to hold of a bit with the claim of no collusion.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump You really show your ignorance and how stupid you think your father's supporters are. You are comparing apples and oranges, and many of the things your dad has "accomplished" has had ramifications we can't even calculate yet.  By the way, hows the national debt coming?
@Arwenslp @Rebashoenfelt1 @RepMarkMeadows I thought so....but the more I thought about the more I didn't even like the possibility that someone though I was okay with all of that. :)

@RepMarkMeadows Finally we agree about something....congress is not doing its job.
@russellcrowe I have always found those to be a very boring part of the show - BUT I thought it was totally the right thing to do because its a celebration of the industry not just the Stars.  They seem to be more concerned about ratings then the purpose of the show.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Seriously? You think any of these are "extreme".....geesh......misdirect, much?
@funder You KNOW he will sign it.  He has started spinning so much to make this seem like a win for him.  Even when he goes to court and looses he will say its because the courts are against him...
@Eddie34600506 @RepMarkMeadows I didn't say any of that. I didn't praise or trash the decision - I clarified a misstatement, but you in your little wacko world made assumptions &amp; then insult me. Here is my assumption: you are an asshat just looking to insult people twitter to feel good about yourself
@Eddie34600506 @RepMarkMeadows no, thats not my point.  And I am not going to even attempt to weigh the pros/cons about something that happened years ago....unless you want to do that about the recent lifting of the russian sanctions.  My POINT was his statement was deliberately misleading.
@saskpyroboyz @RepMarkMeadows They gave no american funds to the Iranians.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why do you always misrepresent the DEMs to make people have a totally inaccurate understanding of things?  Oh,  I guess I answered my own question.
@ChelseaClinton So your saying someone wearing dark makeup and going for halloween as Black Panther or some other popular black character is equal to the wearing of black face paint and costume in an obvious negative caricature of African Americans? You see those as the same? Serious question.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman Good spin.......
@RepMarkMeadows Uh...they unfroze $1.8B of Iran's own money so thats not a good comparison.  If this is the best you can do, its obvious you have no interest in giving picture a true picture of whats going on.  But I get it.  distorting the truth helps your cause.
@briantylercohen by claiming replacement of the existing wall as new wall - he can make his followers believe he met his campaign promise. All he needed was a way to spin this to look like he got what he wanted. This is his "out".

@DonaldJTrumpJr Sorry Jr.   I don't even think he understood they were celebrating THEIR becoming congresswomen.  I think he he though they were appluading his comment about women in general and thats why he told them they weren't suppose to do that when they cheered.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I am not wearing an American flag pin.  I guess I am now a traitor.  You caught me. Guess those 20 years of active duty military service meant nothing.
@DonaldJTrumpJr No, this is an idiot. And like so many other stupid things and extreme ideas you can't associate this to an entire political party regardless of what his affiliation is.
@SteveScalise I would be more receptive to your comments if GOP had not pushed DEMS out of significant policy development meetings over the last years, this was not a DEM function, &amp; your access to the media and twitter clearly shows you have plenty of ways to get your thoughts out.
@RodAllen1968 @Jim_Jordan @POTUS So, you don't think the historical increase in the number of women in congress is a good thing?  Funny, Trump thought the increase employment of women was a  good thing and that also happened in congress.  Not sure how showing happiness about this is pushing a special interest.
@RepMarkMeadows Every time you try to misrepresent DEMS &amp; others who disagree with you only convince me you do it because you can't win a straight up idea vs idea/fact vs fact comparison - so to try &amp; win by discrediting others, avoiding open debate, &amp; relying on false sound bytes
@RepMattGaetz contrary to how you spin it to put a negative slant on it...no one wants a true socialist country...you just want people to think that so they will be scared and continue to give you blind loyalty.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS the investigations are only partisan because the gutless GOP is only concerned about their special interests and an agenda which does not align with the will of the country
@RossTuckerNFL UG...really depends on the team and for how long they would be expected to be the QB.  Might be easier to throw a team out there and ask which QB fits the team better.
@G00SE_13 @KamalaHarris You can't know whether anyone knows what they are talking about via media sound bytes. if they don't have a substantive dialog you can't really know where the other stands or if they are full of shit or not. The dialog is where you explain the basis of your opinion and debate it
@MillerCoors @MillerLite @CoorsLight You beer companies really waste a lot of time and money of stuff no one gives a crap about.
@funder I disagree. I despise Trump &amp; what he stands for, says, &amp; does - but too many ignore stuff like this &amp; get their interpretations from others. I know its going to piss me off watching it, but I will see it for myself.  I wish more people took the time as they might actually see.
@pattonoswalt THAT would be awesome
@G00SE_13 @KamalaHarris I think its good.  good that something that they said they were going to do 2 years ago finally gets done.  but you are looking at one thing and acting like that solves the larger problem.
@G00SE_13 @KamalaHarris I am not arguing anything.  I am stating there has not been any significant dialog on the subject of gun violence by the right people to work out any serious solutions. Period. And yes, to me its the NRA backed GOP who seem to be the most adverse to talk.
@G00SE_13 @KamalaHarris C'mon whats your point?  Did you read my tweets?  You see seem to be having a one sided argument throwing up things which have nothing to do with my statement,.
@G00SE_13 @KamalaHarris Disagree. Regardless if people know or don't know facts, the NRA backed GOP has resisted any discussion on this.  Any I don't think it is not knowing the facts - its how the sides are putting value on these facts. Doesn't matter - they need to start talking and educate each other

@AOC I am still on the fence about how I feel about AOC - not enough data - but I have less an issue with her cussing then I do with inaction and behavior of GOP congress and how McConnel runs the Senate on behalf of Trump.

@SenateGOP @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Why is Senate voting on President deal which DEMS already said no to - but they won't vote on the bipartisan deal that was put together already?  Oh I forgot, the Senate does not exist anymore as a body of Government - they are just an arm of the President.
@charliekirk11 Uh...correct me if I am wrong here, but I though they didn't GIVE them $150B. They just unfroze assets that were theirs.
@thehill the original deal a year or so again did have strings to it - he turned it down.
@EddyFra62834217 @RepMarkMeadows Trump is all talk as well.  And I am at the point where anyone who is getting paid right now should just shut up.  Denying Americans their pay and Government services is NOT an acceptable tactic.
@RepMarkMeadows No, they are the party of open the GOV and then we will talk.  The party of how about offer something real something that you didn't take away to create leverage anyway.  There are things I like in his plan - but I am against his tactics and their impact more than anything else
@realDonaldTrump Hey Trump when are you going to realize YOU are also the Media.  You put out more fake news then anyone.
@dbongino Ir might help if the President and the political parties on both sides actually didn't either out right lie or at best try to distort the truth, put out misleading statement and false narratives, and implement deliberate propaganda and misinformation strategies and machines.

@CREWcrew Does 281 represent days visited or actual visits which include multiple days?  Either way this is so unethical &amp; it makes me want to smack all those who praise him for giving up his pay check. Now add in all the foreign governments/others funding money to him by staying there.
@NathanLerner Yeah, did he claim some sort of emergency regarding Opioids several months ago.  Did he do anything?
@realDonaldTrump Stop deflecting, misleading people, and trying to influence the polls.  You want me to be on your side?  Open the Government and then start bitching about people not negotiating.  Right now, your just noise with the GOV closed.
@tribelaw @SenMajLdr The far right has an extreme national agenda which overrides the conservative agenda at the state level or interests of the voters within the GOP.

@granthpaulsen To me he sounds like someone who really a) knows the game and b) really enjoys the game.   And I am a Redskins fan, so you know how hard that was to say.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Gov shutdown should not be part of this negotiation.
@GOP @VP Its EVEN more disappointing  McConnel refuses to use the same process to push will of republicans/democrats to the president. Instead, he just bends over &amp; forces the Senate to be an puppet of the Executive branch. GOPs Senators should be ashamed. Take you Senate back.
@Jim_Jordan Please stop spreading misleading statements just to form false narratives so your supporters will hopefully not see Trump and GOP's complicity in this as well.  Just open the gov.  Stop using one problem to cause another.
At least I am not so desperate enough for attention that I "like" my own tweets. https://t.co/RrgiEWOkFa
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I totally agree with you! But I will expect both sides to negotiate in good faith.  I support you in this right now not because I am a DEM (I'm not), but because I blame Trump for shutdown which my highest priority.  Afterward, I will be watching both sides &amp; how they cooperate
@ChrisDahl70 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I would totally be for a statement which opens the Government and then they go into a room and we hear nothing else about it till they come out and they can't come out unless they agree on something.
@TracyFo47710566 @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump No because with everyone of these statements there should be an asterisk which provides the actual context....what does this got to do with Obama?  oh you must be one of those people who always make an an Obama comments when you have nothing else to say.
@realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter So Ann Coulter also does not understand how Global Warning works and things the impact of the climate change on our country is funny.  Just like the plight of GOV workers she and Trump our out of touch, ignorant, and uncaring.
@SeanCasten It also show our President and his followers have NO UNDERSTANDING about how Global Warming and Climate change works.  This statement shows and promotes  total ignorance.
@thehill I think Trump would have had his wall a long time ago - but he picks people who are extreme in their position &amp; have no clue how to work that in a political environment where  any solution has to merge different sets or requirements.  its not like business.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Every one of these should have a "but" after it...
@realDonaldTrump Is that your retirement statement? And its not "almost" - its exactly like having no president. Instead of a leader who stands for the interests of this country we have a buffoon who listens to hand picked sycophants who don't even have his back. Its not policy, its competence.
@girlsreallyrule Based on the interview I just heard from Nathan Phillips - thats not quite the way it happened.
@funder So he will bring the PRESIDENT'S proposal up for vote but not ones the House and Senate wants to vote on.  What more example do people need that he is serving at the whim of the Executive branch and not on behalf of the Legislative?  How can people be okay with this?
@ChrisDahl70 @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Trump had just as much opportunity to talk about this over the last 2 years as the DEMS.  In fact, more.  But regardless, I don't give a crap.  The impact of the leverage is priority to me. Open the GOV then I will get mad at who does not negotiate.
@realDonaldTrump One reason I have lost all respect for you is you say stuff like this....but my own eyes see it covered in the media.  So I know your lying.  I think what you really mean is you don't like how they report it because they don't always give the same spin you do.
@thehill The GOP tactic to say  everything against you Radical Left is another stupid marketing gimmick. Its not true &amp; only people who believe you are those who already believe everything you say. So why say it?  Is it because the fear you've built in your  base needs to be refreshed?

@funder He is listening to the wrong people.
Open the Government. https://t.co/jkxrTJ9i0D
@thehill The messages sent by Trump and Pelosi only resonate as positive or believable by their base of supporters. They need to change minds on the other side. They need to communicate with the other sides audience to make any head way in this.
@WhiteHouse @GOP @realDonaldTrump Great.  Open the Government and then you all do that.
@SMorrow55440890 @hardball @HardballChris I understand.  The wall is not a short time solution and if any one thinks so they are crazy.   There are still court cases going on over land taken for other wall segments several years ago.
@TheWeek @matthewwalther They are wrong and ignorant.
@KMCaton @realRKinVA @uf_fda @donnabrazile Personally, I would like to hear what value they "think" they get from it first - but to be honest I can't think of any really good reason for it either.
@SenBlumenthal Everything trump proposes whether its a $5B wall or the latest stuff drives me crazy.  It shows no understanding of the real problems.  Totally focused on isolated specific actions which don't address the large issue as whole.  There is no thought out strategy with any of this..
@Alyssa_Milano ...and the million or two million government contractors out of work, and people at businesses who serve these people.
@ananavarro People are flawed. Our Government and leaders should work to push us forward to be what we strive to be as a nation, and provide examples of what is acceptable behavior is for our citizens. You can see the changes in behavior that is tolerated since Trump got into office.
@realRKinVA @uf_fda @donnabrazile I have no opinion one way or the other - just making the point to not make this out as something irregular.

@funder DEMS have offer in the news today Trump won't accept. Trump will make offer this afternoon that DEMS won't accept. Its all public relations to give  illusion they are willing to negotiate. Stop jerking the country off and just open the GOV and continue your argument on the side.
@BuckSexton @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump And  right next to it we can put a list of all the statements and claims he has made which are out and out lies.  That would be a nice thing to see.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I am actually nervous. While I hope announces reopening of the GOV followed by continued border security negotiation to get some of the public opinion back is way, I suspect it will be some crazy action he plans on taking.  Either way, he is trying to distract from the Cohen News
@williamkilpa @KINDREALTOR65 @NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS agree. and some bills were previously approved by the senate.  senate inaction of this is just as much to blame for this situation we are in.
@ChuckG17385662 @AnnCoulter Stop babbling and pay attention.  Did I say anything about the problems? No. I  have an open mind about the solution we come up with to fix our problems - I don't blindly think a stupid wall is going to fix everything.
@ChuckG17385662 @AnnCoulter Not for me.  I have an open mind about the border security and can go with the flow on whatever the DEMS and GOp decide - but that is second to me than opening the GOV. THe shutdown impacts things down.  The wall does nothing for a long time.
@ChrisCoons Does he no how to schedule a vote thats not requested by or which benefits the President?

@SMorrow55440890 @hardball @HardballChris Hard to follow...but I think I am agree with you if your saying there is so much thats not being considered in the Trump "wall" idea.

He can easily be the winner by opening the GOV &amp; pushing DEMS to negotiate border issues.  He gets the upper hand - but he listens to the wrong people
@MSNBC If there was any proof that Trump was guilty of being under direct influence of Putin, wouldn't Mueller have to take steps on that immediately?

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I agree his word is not good enough.  Thats why I am excited to see all the evidence the story was based on.  You know, the employee interviews, emails, texts, and other documents. Good thing they did not use Cohen as a source for that story.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President.  I always "want" to give you the benefit of the doubt, but if you want us to believe the GOP is so unified....how about you allow the Senate to vote on those bills?  Without that record - I will assume your words are also rhetoric with no truth to them.
@funder The senate vote is important as it forces everyone to go on record &amp; show where their interests lie. it also allows the Senate to function at more than just the word of the President. It makes ALL of congress accountable &amp; responsible for state we are in. #VoteMoreTweetLess

@DemWrite @joncoopertweets I see people on left following Trump GOP playbook by embracing extreme of a different flavor.  Stupid.

@Duffy_1958 @SteveScalise @SpeakerPelosi Well, your making a lot of false assumptions because I am not a liberal or a democrat.  And there has been negotiation going back as far as last year.  There is more to this then the events of the last couple weeks.
@Duffy_1958 @SteveScalise @SpeakerPelosi ok you win. Your ploy of just repeating the same thing has convinced me how right you are.  Who cares.  its will be the same thing he says all the time.  He is great and everyone who disagrees with him is evil and unamerican and you will believe every word.
@Duffy_1958 @SteveScalise @SpeakerPelosi Thats not what she did.  Read her letter and tell me what she said is not true.
@joethespartan04 Gotcha.
@KitayamaLou @Jim_Jordan oh. well you make a good point. Of course, I am not a liberal and not even a democrat, and I am not commenting on the border and you  actually aren't saying anything. oh I get it your one of those who just want to feel important by tweeting crap
@joncoopertweets I called, but I don't like this binary poll.  I am against funding the wall as Trump demands &amp; I am against shutting the GOV down to force the wall - but if the final bipartisan strategy has some wall elements to it I am okay with that.  Also what stops people from calling again?
@joethespartan04 @pjm7245 @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump not sure who you are asking your question.
@KitayamaLou @Jim_Jordan Hey, you pulled your head out of your ass long enough to tweet a stupid insulting reply.  There is nothing delusional about the impact of the shutdown and you reduction in force does nothing to help the problem.
@BestPrezEver73 @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump 1.  I don't agree with you.  2.  I don't care.  This entire argument should not be wrapped around the GOV shutdown. Open the Government.
@WWG1WGA68665088 @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump pardon my languag, but I don't give a FUCK what Obama did or do.  Who cares?  What one does or doesn't do excuses or justifies the actions of the other.  Anyone who thinks that is no smarter than a 3 year old.
@Chill_Gemini @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump I don't agree with you, but thats immaterial.  The GOV shutdown in itself is more of an issue now than the wall argument for me.  Its a separate issue supersedes the other debate.  The shutdown is having an impact today which will get worse.
@angrypooka @DOC2hp @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump Why?
@DOC2hp @Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump The GOV does a million things that you probably aren't aware that impact people everyday.  That work is not getting done.
@SteveScalise Oh come on. Like trump needs the state of the union to communicate with America.
@Lrihendry @realDonaldTrump But he is not putting America first by closing the government
@bmwsoldatone @RepChipRoy @VP I am not against a wall &amp; also thought of the jobs.  But I am against a Wall just for the sake of a wall. it needs to be part of a larger joint strategy &amp; not rammed down our throats. However; I also think its going to cost WAY more than $5B and I want the GOV open before talks.
@Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs What part of her explanation do you not agree with?  Seriously, instead of just spouting off try explaining why her letter is incorrect?
@mmfa I am sure he will release them in the MEDIA and not via a legit investigation.
@WokeRomney @joncoopertweets If collusion happened, it continued yesterday with your vote to lift the sanctions on that Russian.
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods Well, they don;t have Russians showing them how to best use it for the spreading of misinformation and propaganda.
@Jim_Jordan We should also be giving the American people the resources and services they need - open the Government now.  Then work the Border issue.  This tactic is not working so stop the damage and go work it as it should be worked.
@thesparroww @seanhannity I wish they all would stop it.  If Mueller's investigation proves anything they goes anywhere people can use the court system to make their case to throw things out.   All of this is just smoke and mirrors at this point.
@GOP @VP Its times for GOP in the Senate to do their job and forward the bills to the President which have already been approved to the President so he can do his job.  More importantly - its time for all in Congress to take steps to open the GOV and get things back on track.
why do people think GOV workers not working, Contractors not working, businesses not getting revenue, &amp; important GOV services not being done across the country is not an issue? This is way more than 800K not getting paychecks . I don't get it.
@bmwsoldatone @RepChipRoy @VP Sorry, your wrong. They didn't start it, but I don't care who did. I know what MSM &amp;  other places are saying, but I don't need them to tell me what to think on this. I know its an issue and I don't see how anybody can think otherwise.
@PattyMurray Well, I am sure our President and Anne Coulter appreciate her sacrifice.

@RBReich @charlie_adler So worn down by all this....
@DavidCornDC something is really really wrong.....not broken....wrong.
I don't who is advising the President, but they are just out of touch and just plain stupid...or have some other agenda.
@realDonaldTrump Sorry to interrupt this misleading tweet, but I want to say the Government shutdown is now an issue all on its own. While DEMS &amp; McConnel are playing their part, you OWN this. So, open  government without conditions, work out a border security solution separately, &amp; be a winner!
@seanhannity @LawrenceBJones3 And I am sure it will be fair and balanced.
@SethAbramson Patiently waiting for Mueller to tell me what the truth is but every almost unsolicited comment by Trump &amp; Giuliani just make me shake my head &amp; say guilty! Still waiting for official truth - but man, they need to just shut up. Most negative news is a response to their comments
@seanhannity shocker....come on you are rehashing old stuff again and again.  The FISA warrants indicated they were funded by political groups - whocares which one - that alone gave proper warning to judges, but even if they knew the names it would not have changed a thing.
@Matthew98421515 @RepChipRoy @VP So, people have to be in the same room to negotiate? You don't think there stuff going on behind the scenes?  Ignore all that media crap about the DEMS/GOP did this or did that. We have no idea whats going on.  And I don't care. I want GOV open w/ no conditions &amp; blame them all.
@BLS_gov @USAFacts @dacresni @uscensusbureau @BJSgov So your funded, but some of the work you do can't accurately be done due to other agencies being shut down.  Well, thats cost efficient.
@AOC I agree with you, but unless this is coming from all the Republican voices in the Senate - it means nothing. Their silence and inaction is worse than McConnel's action. Oh an that 800K is a small number which only factors federal employees,
@Jim_Jordan Wrong. Totally and deliberately trying to cause problems.   Just open the Government and then I might listen to what you have to say,
@washingtonpost such an ignorant ass.
@bmwsoldatone @RepChipRoy @VP He has already made his case. They went &amp;  saw him last week &amp; he walked out. I understand not wanting to be part of another set up photo op where he can act like he is "trying".  Besides, I don't care what either does unless they open the Gov now. Its an issue of its own now.

@KINDREALTOR65 @NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS Not really. The House should send a bill the believe in and force the senate to vote on it and go on record.  But your missing the point.  The house is sending stuff the senate has already voted on an approved, but didn't send.
@KINDREALTOR65 @NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS its not congress' job to send a bill Trump likes. By preventing Senate to do its part in the process, McConnel  protects trump by not putting him in a veto potion, isolates house for public opinion, allows no GOP voting.  He stopped bipartisan bills agreed on one week before
@Jim_Jordan The probe that has found a lot of stuff so far?
@GovMikeHuckabee I use to like you but you have turned into what is wrong with the GOP &amp; right news media.  its all about the sound bites.  Insulting people.  Making fun of things. Its sad. I left the GOP because I can't stand how they behave and perform these days and your now 1 of them.

@SteveScalise You can't say your for the American people by forcing a GOV shutdown so you can get your way.
@SteveScalise what I don't get is if there is a deadlock here...how come you say its the dems fault for not budging when Trump isn't budging either?  Not sure I get your logic there.
@KINDREALTOR65 @NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS uh....well the house has sent something to the senate.  And its not the senates job to send something to the President he wants to see.  Its their job to send something THEY thing is right and let him do what he has to do.
@Mountain_Tigers @thehill I meant I agree with you NOT him.
@Mountain_Tigers @thehill I got the point. Totally agree.
@thehill The bigger question is why Aren't all those other Gov workers and contractors and related small business getting paid...oh yeah, because you don't know know how to lead and are trying to force your wishes on this country by making others suffer.
@Barbann76 @NeverWasABot @clmuseum @SteveScalise @POTUS People who aren't directly touched by this have no clue. The ripple of effect of this is going to get worse in ways people don't understand. Sorry for what your going through.  There is nothing I want bad enough to shut the government down to get.
@thehill How do you know unless you vote?  If everyone votes the way not to override a veto then we might have gone 3 steps forward 2 steps back, but they are steps in the process. And maybe when voters see how their people voted they might get a little bit more vocal on way or the other.
@NeverWasABot @Barbann76 @clmuseum @SteveScalise @POTUS I know what its called, but how is that working out for him?  Its trying to force your way at the expense of the country. How is that right?  Only idiots  who aren't aware and people who don't care think its okay to shut the GOV down.  Its a total failure of leadership.
@NeverWasABot @Barbann76 @clmuseum @SteveScalise @POTUS We can have the same argument over border security with the gov open.
@NeverWasABot @clmuseum @Barbann76 @SteveScalise @POTUS Yes, trump did and I am not looking past that issue - thats the problem.  He deliberately linked it to something it never had to be part of.
@clmuseum @Barbann76 @NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS its not like daca or border security - its about GOV shutdown vs no GOV shutdown.  That should be the priority.
@RepMarkMeadows What has changed since he walked out the last time?
@SteveScalise @POTUS I agree you can't serve the people if you don't show up.  So, how is the Senate vote coming?  I am really looking forward to see their votes as they give their constituents a voice in these negotiations by voting on and submitting a package to the President.  Show up senate.
@senatemajldr Senator McConnell - you are talking to the house.  How about you give that same choice to the democrats and republicans in the Senate by allowing them to vote on the bills? Instead of taking the senate out of the process and directly serving as an arm of the presidency.
@RepMarkMeadows It still comes down to where the money goes and how its prioritized against other country needs and programs. Why does the border get it and not some other problem area?
@RudyGiuliani So when can we see the translator notes from the Putin Trump discussion?
@DavidPriess @TheDemCoalition So.....are gov leaders shouldn't care if the people don't?   Wow....that explains a lot...
@ABC but nooo....Trump is not making money off his presidency and he gives away his salary....
@dianemoa1212 @tedlieu I agree.  But to say there are not real issues that real people have to deal with every day is not true.  Its just not in the context trump describes it
@tedlieu uh...I meant to say NOT a national emergency in my tweet....kind of an important word to leave out.
@realDonaldTrump Nothing matters at this point to me except that government is shut down and every single American is impacted in some way.  Stop holding people hostage to get your Wall, open the government, and then argue with DEMS on some border security strategy.
@john_keim Yeah, if they are seriously looking he should walk.  But seriously who would want to come here when Gruden has only one year left...unless you hope to take his job.  And how awkward would that be.
@DavidPriess Well, Trump and the GOP are spending so much time discrediting it SOMEONE must care.  I live in the beltway and probably feel like most outside the beltway do - We care, but we just waiting to see what the instigation comes up with.
@maryjanepiper @MrJoshCharles Susan. You really are a shallow person who seems to only want to talk down to people and insult them while showing your own ignorance, intolerance, and brainwashing from fox news, trump, the GOP and others.   Have a nice day.
@BreadConquerer @tedlieu I will just say that the immigration system is made up of a lot of components working together and there are things which possibly  could be improved.  My point is it all has to be looked out - but all we the world is talking about is a wall.
@TIpperRob @notlob2 @tedlieu Not sure your point
@AmanirenaK @tedlieu @senatemajldr Also when I say border security and illegal immigration I am referring to illegal immigration as a whole and not just people entering illegally and not including asylum seekers.  Once again, agree totally with what you say
@AmanirenaK @tedlieu @senatemajldr Totally agree &amp; I do say (you say it better) to Trump/McConnel and other leaders -  for what its worth. But while the border issues are not as bad as GOP describes they are real issues to real people &amp; the way many deny the severity of this comes off as denying the issue itself
@HeartnSoul77 @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I agree.  Totally.  But I am now at the point where I am putting blame also on all gov to fix this.  Too many are getting off free just because their "heart" is in the right place and they say the right thing. Hold them all accoutnable.
@TrueThaiNews @beckysterne @tedlieu Trust me, he is the one I do ultimately blame in this.  But the politicians and media (not all) are manipulating the people to do exactly that - take a side.  Then we argue with each other instead of focusing on the Government as a whole to do their jobs.
@BreadConquerer @tedlieu Nope to what?  You don't think we have problems with Border Security and illegal immigration?  I totally don't agree we have the crisis that Trump claims, but just because crossings are down doesn't make it good.  But my point is there is a lot more  they should be looking at.
@beckysterne @tedlieu Maybe you need to educate yourself. Your points are exactly what I am talking about - those are all true and why I say a Wall is not THE answer.  But that does not mean there aren't real problems at the border as well and your an idiot if you think other wise.
@pattonoswalt CGI definitely
@tedlieu Oh, and thanks for responding to my tweet....did not expect that.  And isn't it time for Trump to release his tax returns? :)  As someone with a clearance for 30+ years I know the level of detail they put into financials and why they do it...it should be mandatory for candidates.
@cringetalk @tedlieu He is talking about bills that got enough votes from both parties to be advanced forward, and they were approved.  Who cares how many votes?  His point is Trump did have funding to use last year and did not use it.
@tedlieu Thats good, but not enough. People are tired of picking sides in the blame game. I now blame congress &amp;Trump. Its your job. There are many key factors which link together which go way beyond a "wall" and "DACA", but thats all I hear people talking about. Its bigger than that.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yep, when it comes to cheating on your wife you definitely are WINNING in that category.  He should have asked you for tips.
@tedlieu I agree but lets be honest while there might be a "national emergency" there definitely is serious border security and illegal immigration issues which need to be fixed. What are you doing to get focus off this "wall" shown down &amp; putting GOV energy into finding a real solution?
@andylassner @MonicaLewinsky but why would he want to?
@CuseOdin @SteveScalise Man...you are a wacko aren't you? You make no sense?  Coward how? You crack me up.  The people who know you must know the Bear means they can't bare to be around you.  Soooo glad I think so little of you to even care what your opinion of me is.
@thehill Well between lack of FOX/GOP coverage and Overcoverage of MSNBC/DEMS I would say tis all balanced out.   No details other than an investgiation was started 2 years ago and we have to wait for Mueller to finish...so...whats changed?
@MarkManuelGalv1 @SteveScalise No, I understand "crisis".  And I understand there is a problem that need to be fixed - what YOU need to wake up to is there is a difference in calling something a crisis and saying something is a crisis that  warrants a national emergency and what that entails.  Thats the issue.
@RepLeeZeldin So has senate voted on that package &amp;sent it to Trump?  Just curious.  Instead of talking tough on twitter I would like to see how all of congress feels by going on record with a vote and kick start the process instead of just everyone sitting around tweeting &amp; pointing fingers
@Mikkel0322 I actually agree with you.  But the conversation is focused on polarizing specifics we a;; argue about instead of them working to come up with a solution for it all.
@InjuredWings43 @SteveScalise your pushing a false narrative with that comment
@LynneAd55372947 @SteveScalise numbers are  not the problem - its how they are being represented.
@JoeNBC I suspect 4 of 4 consider it a serious problem which requires action, but not a situation which warrant a declaration of national emergency to force building a wall. People arguing over what "crisis" means &amp; associating opinion on with whether people care about border security
@rickygervais Yep.
@TomFitton totally missing the point there Tom..on purpose
@rogersniki @kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise Thats not true.  The 60 votes is only for some things.  Take a look at how that wonderful tax bill was past.
@markinaustin183 @ImmaMuteYa @kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise So, what do you mean by negotiate?  Trumps definition is to give him exactly what he wants or he keeps the Gov shut down.  McConnel won't even send him bi-partisan bills...so how is Trump negotiating.  If your going to put fingers at DEMS you have to point them at GOP as well.
@joncoopertweets wait.till.results.of.investigation.  Personally, if they had evidence that he was I would like to think they would have taken steps to remove him from office already.  The CI investigation is not like the criminal one.
@czabe Good ol Czab...I am scrolling through twitter seeing praise after praise after praise for McVay and the Uncle Steve hollers up from the basement...not saying your wrong, but thats something Bruce is telling Dan to make him not feel bad for letting him go.

@karen01347913 @StarnesDouglas @Republocrat2 @SteveScalise there was no dialog
@jordy019 @kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise You know nothing about me or my politics.  You are reading a lot into small comments just because someone has told you what to think when people disagree with you.
@CuseOdin @SteveScalise Gee...I have no picture and that makes me a coward?  Wow - you got me.  And your bear shows who you are?  How does that differ from me not having one? I am no trying to be nothing, but you are commenting on me so I must be something
@karen01347913 @StarnesDouglas @Republocrat2 @SteveScalise I do because your are a prefect example of the main problem we have today. Politics is all about middle ground - its not winner take all.  Noone side is totally right,
@StarnesDouglas @Republocrat2 @karen01347913 @SteveScalise the amount of coverage does not mean the stories aren't true
@susanna73807012 There has been more than 31, but 31 are still active. Trump also has a few - but if you look at them the scope of Trumps &amp; Obama's are nothing like what we are talking about here. They all dealt with very specific actions  taken regarding property linked to terrorism etc.

@karen01347913 @StarnesDouglas @Republocrat2 @SteveScalise Karen you don't have to apology for having opinion, but if you really think that there is just Good and Evil side to the people in this country then I feel sorry for you.
@TomMcMurray11 @amyfiscus @adamgoldmanNYT @nytmike @npfandos Its just stupid to think just "brain washed liberals" don't like Trump, but in my case I will accept whatever Mueller reports. As far as others, maybe they will push a false narrative that FBI is unethical - but at least they will wait till after investigation unlike the GOP
@CongressmanHice @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Well, at least Puerto Rico will get some money out of a Gov Leader trip as opposed to a Trump owned property,
@StarnesDouglas @karen01347913 @Republocrat2 @SteveScalise I like how you think people who don't agree with you are "liberals"  I guess labeling them helps.
@wila_jerome @seanhannity No thats okay I watch fox news as well.
@avsman41 @AmysGotBirds @kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise So you thought it was awesome that the majority of people didn't want Trump president.....sad little man.
@SCSPOPS @kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise "what" is?  The spending bills to open the government or the ones they could have worked on separately (and actually were) since last year?
@SundayPuncher00 I will say this slow for you. No one is saying we don't have serious problems. But we are talking 2 different things. Whether this is a crisis using the term as its normally used or a "certain type of crisis" to justify declaring "National Emergency" to give president more power.
@PamKennedy0 @SteveScalise I do.  But let me correct one thing.  I don't necessarily believe the numbers themselves are false as the ones I see come, DHS.  What I think is fake in how they are used a represented.
@mizner_cheryl @SteveScalise Man, I don't have time to educate you.  its not always about the numbers its about the context of the numbers and what they really mean.
@CelesteBeyrout2 @SteveScalise Actually, the numbers come from DHS and the problem is not the numbers its the context of the numbers and what they represent.  They don't necessarily include just what you think they do.
@CelesteBeyrout2 @SteveScalise not for everything.
@ImmaMuteYa @kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise Gotta to have that one issue to energize his base.   The sad thing is there are large problems with border security and immigration as a whole - but the insistence on THE WALL prevents a better conversation and solution. Well, they  sent him bipartisan solutions and he said no.
@StarnesDouglas @Republocrat2 @karen01347913 @SteveScalise How bout we accept we are being lied to &amp; manipulated by both sides &amp; neither of us is right, stop arguing w/ each other, &amp; hold Congress accountable for fixing this &amp; doing their jobs. By taking sides we make it easier for them to do nothing. Judge them by results not soundbites
@margos1s @SteveScalise Not disagreeing with you at all.
@kacie_kellfire @SteveScalise Uh..in some things they need 60 votes but it others they only need 51.  plus even when they tried Trump said no AND Trump had $2B to mess with on this and didn't use hardly any of it.
@thehill no, thats what the trial and appeal process will be used for.
@JoshBeckham8 @solutions35 @SJYBulldog @seanhannity You have your opinion/I have mine. But mine is wrong because I never spoke to a agent. I'm not against the wall. I'm against his solution to border security/immigration problems &amp; his method of trying to force it. I see no record  action where he tried anything &amp; he had $$$
@wila_jerome @seanhannity You stopped being credible to me by playing the blame Obama/Hilary card. Those 2 have nothing to do with Trump. Whether your trying to deflect attention from Trump or excusing his behavior because someone else behaved badly (in your mind) I don't know.  Have a happy life.
@NatashaBertrand @joncoopertweets I have not heard anyone speculate how this knowledge may have impacted Sessions and others.  Maybe when he saw what the full scope of the CI investigation was he decided not to be Trumps puppet and recused himself from it all. Thats why Trump was so mad.
@JohnCornyn I have a better idea - how about the senate tell Chuck, Nancy, and Trump how bad it is by sending a Bill to open the Gov.  That will show'em.  it will also show us you actually give a shit and want step up, be heard on record, and do your job leading this country.
@RepTedBudd Hey Budd, guess you didn't get the word but DEMS want border Security and sound immigration practices as well.  They just want an effective and cost efficient solution that doesn't center around a very expensive wall shoved down people's throats under the threat of gov shutdown.

@amyfiscus @adamgoldmanNYT @nytmike @npfandos I think trump is incompetent, doesn't care about this country, and guilty as hell (of something), but the article says investigation was started - but not that it continued or found anything.  As with everything, be patient and wait for Mueller.
@SteveScalise here let me help you. no one is saying its not a serious problem.  but its hard to call it a nation emergency or crisis when a) a lot of the numbers your using are false, b) its actually gotten better the last few years, and the GOP has sat on their asses for the last 2 years
@KamalaHarris @joncoopertweets Can you please start adding the number of contractors who are out of work as well? I see so many people down playing the impact of this shutdown and I think they should get a better understanding of the impact.
@wila_jerome @seanhannity Sorry Jerry. I just don't see it. His actions and his words tell me different.
@ReggieCarpente5 @WhiteHouse Yep.  The thing is I can go with a wall being part of the solution  but what he is proposing is not going to be effective enough AND using the shut down was a deliberate tactic he did not have to use.
@solutions35 @JoshBeckham8 @SJYBulldog @seanhannity someone else is clueless on the wall numbers.  if you think that wall is ONLY going to cost $5B your crazy.   Why don't you ask what calculations went into that number?  Did maintenance go into it?  Did cost of buying land from people go into it?
@wila_jerome @seanhannity First off all the wall would not even be built enough to make any difference in the election.  Only meeting his promise will - which is why he does not care about anything else.
@BrennanCenter @LizaGoitein Its a bigger crisis when the majority party of the senate allows it to happen by not doing their job.
@JoshBeckham8 @solutions35 @SJYBulldog @seanhannity man, I don't have the energy for conversation....but I will just say I don't see the WALL as a far right extreme position.
@WhiteHouse Which means President must sign the bill which means Senate must submit one. Conrgess and President are to blame for this, for bringing us to this point. Open the gov and do your fighting on this on the side.
@JoshBeckham8 @solutions35 @SJYBulldog @seanhannity While that shoots the Mexico will pay for it promise down - I don't care WHO pays for it.  It still comes down to whether is worth the cost.   And DEMS are no more embracing socialism then all GOPers are embracing far right extreme positions.
@maryjanepiper @MrJoshCharles Susan, I am sad for you if you really think that. It means you believe only false news &amp; misleading narratives fed by Trump, GOP party, Fox news, etc.  I am not an idiot.  I am not DEM. But I can research for myself and see how they try manipulate people.
@MarieResistance Trump won't do it , trump can't do it - the Senate will do it for him.  The GOP led congress and now the senate abandoned their responsibilities as the legislative branch and have become a tool of Executive branch instead of performing their role.
@JoshBeckham8 @SJYBulldog @seanhannity You don't want to go down the common sense road with anything involving this president.
@eddikens1 @seanhannity Thanks. My anger over the way the arguments are presented  to keep people stupid is more than the policies themselves.  Why can't they just state each sides case honestly and live or die by the public response?  I mean I know why, but...why? (yes, that was a Kung Fu Panda quote)
@seanhannity sigh....the fight over the wall is not about whether a "Wall" works.  It about WALL effectiveness vs cost, Wall effectiveness vs. other border security and immigration problems, and whether shutting down the Gov is the way to get it.
@BillOReilly They are governing trump because he is the news.  You act like his presidency is normal.  It is exhausting watching media and social media, but its not fake and its not immaterial.
@RepDanCrenshaw @SteveScalise No,congress is holding federal workers hostage with their inaction. The blame game won't work because DEMS, congress as a whole, and Trump are all to blame for the state we are in. Stop being part of the problem, get Gov open, and do your jobs on border security the right way.
People accuse me of being a farleft liberal socialist progressive all the time. What they don't  realize is thats not my political leaning. I lean left &amp; right on many subjects. But I can't how stand Trump/GOP misled people &amp; GOP gave him legislative branch by not doing their job
@wolfblitzer @Acosta @realDonaldTrump My boots need to be ten feet taller after all the BS he keeps throwing out there.
@MrJoshCharles It numbs the mind trying to figure out how they support him AND the claims he makes.  I can get them being just like him and seeing the world as he does, but thats not the same as spouting same lies and falsehoods.  I think they just can't handle the truth of what they support.
@funder Yes!!!!
@Acosta Hey can we put the wall on the Mexican side?  Might be cheaper.
@Big_O_Dad @senatemajldr Agree. I can't say I would like what the "process" would produce &amp; I know there always has been politics involved in how bills are managed - but this goes beyond that. His Senate is no longer functioning as an independent body &amp; that is what has me so angry with GOP
@brianklaas @MrJonCryer I don't know the end result, but the static state we have now is because they won't send that package (or any) forward. They need to do this to force action, go on record individually, and at a minimum focus where the blame should be put  so pressure can be directed properly

@LouDobbs @RandyResist Bet you quote your own poll...
@DavidCornDC How confidential would any detail remain if his report to congress  just listed the crimes he had evidence of which could warrant an indictment or other recommended action?  I would think that would force actions to make the rest public or at least revealed to congress,
@SenSchumer I agree, but this demonstrates how this shutdown hurts many others who rely on the revenue from the Gov Workers pay. Not all our big companies. How can you protect the federal works and not the others? Where do you draw the line? You can't even try. You draw it at NO SHUTDOWN.
@yokoono What memory makes you smile the most?
Biggest truths buried in lies are how bad shutdowns impacts people/companies/country; minimization of congress role, Senate inaction is equally responsible for deadlock, everyone wants border security, existence of bipartisan agreements &amp; Trump had resources and failed to act
@thehill Why is he doing this?  Why is majority leader not letting the voices of the Senators be heard?  Why is he acting like he, and the Senate, have no roll or responsibility in this? The Senate no longer works for the people - it works for the executive branch.
Exactly. GOP has turned congress into  an extension of the Executive branch to enable Trump. People are heard by their leaders votes which initiate change. The votes tell the story NOT sound bites on TV or false polls. Instead, GOP hijacks democratic process for Trump. https://t.co/kg0ASHOX1h
We, the people, are arguing over a Wall in a Dem vs Trump fight, when conversation should be why Senate is sitting this out by not doing their job. By not voting on the bills &amp; sending them forward they stay out of the fight, enable Trump, &amp; remove 1 branch of gov from process
@thehill how bout you have the senate send those bills up to Trump, get his response, and see if they counter then.

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Your making assumptions. You have no idea how they would negotiate if government is open - the only reason you want to go to the emergency powers path is because you and the GOP don't want to go on record for how you vote on this issue or put Trump in the position to have to veto
@RealDrGina @benshapiro @SpeakerPelosi the immorally argument is really not the main argument here and him saying he does not find it immoral is NOT the same thing as seeing he thinks its  the most effective and cost efficient solution.
@cyurth @LindseyGrahamSC @Acosta My comment is not that I disagree with his comment about the emergency cause I agree totally.  But his choice of words in saying there is not problem at a place where there are steel slats makes it to easy for GOP to say "there is no problem "there" cause there is a wall".
@nklym143 @DanCrenshawTX @JohnCornyn Not sure you understand they are allowed to discuss WITH the Government not shutdown.
@LindseyGrahamSC @Acosta Senator - I find your behavior in all this pretty sad and unbecoming a leader.  But, I have to give it to you - he walked right into that one.
@BillOReilly The GOP has destroyed themselves by their actions.  The reporting of their actions, or inaction, is not what destroyed it.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Your getting a crisis confused with a National Emergency
@realDonaldTrump Um.... where is the unity?  You won't let you puppet McConnel have a senate vote.   Let them have the vote and go on record.  THEN we can see how things really stand.

@ABC No, he is protecting Trump and GOP.  A vote would force GOP senators to go on record with their vote.  They can't have that.  They have to continue to make this seem like a DEM vs Trump fight.   McConnell is acting as Trumps stooge and not as the leader of the senate.
@DanCrenshawTX @JohnCornyn well, that would require the Senate to vote on and pass the bill to the president and maybe opening the Government.  So how bout we do that. Open the GOV, have a congressional discussion, propose a solution, and submit it to Trump. you know, like the way its suppose to be done
@ChihuahuaFaerii @RepLeeZeldin You think GOP is different?  And there have been compromises on this. You equate compromise with giving Trump exactly what he wants.This should not be a DEM vs Trump.  It should be legislative branch vs executive branch, but nope. If GOP senate did its job this would be over.
@brianschatz I like this, but how is this fair? Some of them rely on the payments from these people as well.  Its just another long line of how this shutdown is impacting people and businesses.

@postpolitics can we get that in writing?
@GrandOaksFarm @RepLeeZeldin I dont think a wall and the rest of Trumps plan is enough.  But if they followed the process and thats what came out of it - fine.  i can bitch about that, but at least they did it the right way and gov is opened.
@RepDanCrenshaw So tired of dem/gop back and forth blame game. Congress, stop making this a DEM vs Trump fight you spineless cowards. Do your job. Negotiate and vote on proposals, submit to Trump, if he says no, vote to veto or not.  YOU have the power but you sit on the side lines.#DoYourJob
@RepLeeZeldin You are deliberately creating a misleading narrative. Bottom line is both can be rightly accused of not negotiating. Open the Gov, negotiate in congress, submit to president and if he veto it, vote to override or not. Do your job congress - use the RIGHT process.
@JeanB19580597 @AP_Politics contrary to the rhetoric, both sides want improved border security and improved immigration polices.  No one thinks they are sufficient &amp; no one wants true open borders. We are arguing about semantics when we should all be tell both sides to go figure out solution.
@pandapaddy30 @CBSNews Yep,  I read some estimates are up to $25B when they factor in having to pay people for their land.   I would like to know where a source is which breaks down how they got to the $5B cost figure,
@RepMarkMeadows And how reasonable is closing the GOV so you can get a WALL you want? Your excuse is to just give it to him cause its not a lot of money? And where is the compromise in just giving in to his demands?  You want compromise - open GOV, let them negotiate, &amp; let congress do their job
@JeanB19580597 @AP_Politics I believe all that is other funding.  But even if it isn't- it does not include any changes to the flawed policies we have in place which a wall will do nothing about. My issue is not so much with the wall, but that it is  pushed as the solution at the expense of other things
@hedgefundmgr42 @dbongino @seanhannity DACA vs the WALL does nothing &amp; they don't want him to succeed in getting an ineffective wall. Thats not same as not wanting border security. The wall, lottery, chain. DACA, and so many more things need to be part of the discussion and all the President focuses on is the wall.
@CBSNews Whatever it takes - as long as he gets a a $5B wall.  Whatever it takes - except opening the government and working to negotiate a smart border security/immigration policy.
@TomFitton It does not matter if they are concerned or just doing it for political reason - what matters is if what they say is true or false. GOP leaders of areas effected by the wall are saying the same thing.
@peggy10976 @Jim_Jordan @ShannonBream seriously?  man, I don't have time to educate you.  Go fact check his statements......look at the source of the information he has used and you can see how he is misusing them to create a narrative.
@JeanB19580597 @AP_Politics Uh, not all experts say that - but regardless I will agree walls work for certain things but a $5B wall is not the solution to all the problems with border security and immigration. The focus should be on a decent multi-faceted solution - not a wall.
@hedgefundmgr42 @dbongino @seanhannity For one they offered Trump Border wall funding several months ago and he said no - what changed.  And you act like its such a simple comparison and its not.  The scope of what was asked for and why is all different.  And DEMS and GOP has offered multiple solutions he shot down
@AP_Politics Yes, in the WH, GOP and FOX news false narrative they are in denial, but in the real world its a different story.  The contradictions in what you say are ridiculous.  Anti-wall doesn't equal Anti-security.  It means they are anti-ineffective solution and waste of funds.
@dbongino @seanhannity Okay - please list their "alledged" lies next to Trumps "alledged" lies and we can easily figure this out.  Sound good?
@realDonaldTrump Who are you talking to?  Nice comments?
@realDonaldTrump Uh....isn't  Forest Management done mostly by the federal government?
@Jim_Jordan @ShannonBream Wrong,  I am not sure if your leading trump or if trump is leading you - but the problem with trying to maintain a constant misinformation campaign trying to mislead and discredit for so long is eventually people see through them and then everything you say is discredited.
@RepMarkMeadows Meadows - you know this is not true. You know it. Why do you continue to lie to people?
@nytimes this is the emergency that concerns me
@funder Depends, who replaces him?
@funder Disagree.  I think people NEED to watch Trump and see this for themselves.
@maziehirono @funder I am forcing myself to watch tonight because I don't want to depend on anyone else's interpretation, but I also think tonight will be a unique event where a President presents a message which is so "wrong" that it makes everyone stop and realized how unfit he is. I can hope.
@rodneygleason69 @tribelaw The emergency announcement will also include him saying he pulls back his demand for $5 B for the wall as part of opening the gov, gov will open, and he will take credit for it.
@rodneygleason69 @tribelaw Exactly.  And that will support his argument about how everyone including DOJ and the courts is out to get him.  They continue to rally around him. He does not lose.
personally, may I suggestion a message punctuated with a car door.... https://t.co/OyvjFBac6j
@PoliticalShort @SebGorka @SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Misleading, as usual.
@BoilerFanTalk @benshapiro training/travel seems more a school expense then a player benefit. Food definitely is something. But I think players should get something. Maybe allow jersey sales &amp; percentage goes to the team &amp; each gets same amount. But what do I know. I admit I am clueless on this topic.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump I am not an expert in anything related to border security - but even I can see the holes and misleading statements in this.
@BoilerFanTalk @benshapiro and please don't think I am thinking they should be paid huge amounts.  maybe basic payment and percentage of jerseys sold with their name on it.....
@BoilerFanTalk @benshapiro I get that - but then you have coaches making millions of dollars. Hard to hear that and not think there is some sort of imbalance here.
@benshapiro I am not a big follower of college sports and never liked the idea about players getting paid - until I was told how much money the schools and coaches profit not just from the players performance in other ways, Has to be a smart way to do this.
@DEN72652584 @tribelaw He doesn't care how small it gets. thats only pocket of people he is really targeting with his communication. thats where his support is. He has one audience he cares about since day 1. they give him justification (in his mind at least) for every step he has taken
@tribelaw $10 bucks your wrong. I can't believe he'd go TV to repeat same stuff. By going on &amp; declaring a national emergency he can get out of the bind he is with the closed government, and seem strong to his followers.  Even if it gets shot down later - he won't care.
@GOP @VP Great.  Then have the senate approve the plan, submit it to the President, have him sign it, or veto it and come back to congress for vote to override.  Use the process.  make every one accountable and on record for whats happening.
@neal_katyal Trump doesn't care if it holds up in court.  He will declare emergency and open the gov (gets him out of that problem) and when its found illegal...he can blame others and still hold on to the main conflict he uses to energize his base. he does not care about solving the problem.
@politico exactly....
@sellis2702 @RepLeeZeldin 1. I don't like hilary either and 2.  I can't take a deep breath because all the EPA regulations trump cut to put money in corporate pockets have removed  pollution protections and restrictions..
@sellis2702 @RepLeeZeldin Of course its about Trump.  he is our president. if you weren't so blind you would see what others see.  i have no problem calling out things other do - but please don't trash someone for using a cuss world when ignore trumps doing the same thing and worse.
@Jim_Jordan well someone has to pay for the debt your tax bill caused
@sellis2702 @RepLeeZeldin You have got to be the stupidest most hypocritical person in the world  if you are seriously making these claims about her and ignoring just how many examples we have of Trump being so much worse.
@McPea54 @funder Wel, trump was pushing privatization of prisons when he got in
@iamnottense @charlie_savage He is not the entire military.  Every person from highest General to lowest enlisted member is not required to follow "unlawfull" orders.  He may "try" and interpret whats lawfull and unlawfull - but I expect others will make their opinions known as well.
@NBCSRedskins Trick question - both.
@nickdoesmyhair @joncoopertweets Yeah - I know...and I believe a lot of it...but I have found that none of that means anything to certain group until its "proven"  by law enforcement.  I just hope they believe it when, excuse me, if, Mueller's investigation proves it.
@joncoopertweets I have to say same thing I say to those who say nothing has been proven right....as far as you know.  Mueller will tell all. :)
RT @ChrisMurphyCT: 97% of Americans believe that you should have to pass a background check before you buy a gun. RT if you're one of them.
@GovInslee @USDOT @DHSgov Plus Gov contractors and company corporate staff who are not working because of this, and the small business near Gov businesses who rely of Gov workers.   All them taking a hit and they will DEFINITELY not get their money back.
@KarenAttiah C'mon...we named a street after him. Isn't that enough?    Let me answer that....nope.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump Neither of those solve the larger problems.
@KitCat54509515 @DzDownUnder @RigneyDave @RepLeeZeldin We are not talking about the cussing. I could care less about that. Allegedly (cause I have not seen it) she said something about America raping and pillaging her people for a long time and now what goes around comes around.   If thats true, I get people getting mad.
@riverslq @thehill Lies and false narratives that can be easily proven wrong - but people don't bother and when they hear them they just say "fake news".
@bundy_22 @RepLeeZeldin No, you aren't important enough to me to ruffle anything. I am not a liberal unless yourdefine that as anyone who disagree with you - but as I said you reply doesn't make any sense regarding my tweet so go bore someone else.
@charlie_savage While the fact congress controls the $$$ and this may not fit national emergency definition, another element is that the DoD also may push back if they perceive they are being given an "unlawful order". (Yeah, thats a thing.) I am curious what DoD says about this now
@funder wait....is this real?  At first I thought, well I can get behind this if its spent on more than a wall and makes sense....but $4.2B for detention beds.  Wait...is this on top of the $5B for the wall? Why do we need all this if the wall is so effective?
@joncoopertweets @funder Oh, I don't know - while I would be just as happy if a different batch of anti-trump ethical not out for their own interests GOPers would challenge them and win....but doubt that will happen.
@funder @BarackObama no make it fair - find a real obnoxious 5 year old and have them explain it
@SecNielsen sensitive is not the same thing as classified. you mean they are sensitive because they don't make Trumps offer
@politico I am loosing count.  How many excuses are you going to make for not doing your job and putting offers on the table? Thats okay, don't answer. Trick question. I know you have to say something to explain why you are just letting Trump have his way since he won't LET you make offers
@JoyAnnReid @KatyTurNBC I think most just look at the spirit of campaign promises being kept - if he didn't get his wall (or all the funding) but he negotiated a good solution on border security/immigration that really helped this country his supporters would definitely accept that if it made sense.
@riverslq @thehill Yeah...even I know its hard cause some times you have to fight with the weapons the other side brings to the table.  But I think a good many of Trump supporters have been lied to about certain things and the DEMs have to be very carefull of feeding into those lies.
@Stand2Bcounted @KitCat54509515 @RigneyDave @RepLeeZeldin Thats a lot different than just wearing a flag and if true - I agree its wrong,  Great, now I have to go do some research to get some context. Hate when Twitter forces me to go actually learn about something I commented on.
@riverslq @thehill Part of the problem with the GOP (not Trump) is how they have hijacked the normal due process of the congress to force their own agenda and enable Trump by doing so.  Just not stooping to their level and running things with integrity &amp; how it should be IS standing up to Trump.
@sellis2702 @RepLeeZeldin Based on what? Her clothers? I see people wearing clothes representing their ethic/religious background and celebrating their heritage all the time.  So thats wrong now?  And I guess your definition of what a "True American" is and different then mine.
@PEltzholtz @hardball @tedlieu concrete, steel, paper mache - that makes no difference  its about a wall and whether its a cost efficient and truly effective solution.
@bundy_22 @RepLeeZeldin Uh..it helps if when tweet you a) know what your talking about, b) not make assumptions, and c)  try and make sense. First, I am not a liberal and second, typical GOP tactic, misdirect from your actions by pointing to another
@justinamash Wake up voters - recognize this is whats happening and STOP fighting with other citizens about this and join to together to hold congress and president accountable for fixing our problems, doing their jobs, and serving the interests of the country and not their own.
@politico they won't have time...Gov opening will be part of Trumps announcement along with declaring it a national emergency.
@hardball @HardballChris thats why he will declare a national emergency &amp; open the gov. Win win for him.  Shows he took decisive steps to open Gov &amp; try to force the Wall issue . who cares if it won't work. Gets him out of hole he dug. DEMS should immediately put forth border security/immigration package
@hardball @tedlieu He will declare it cause he doesn't want a solution - he just wants the conflict to rally his people. He will do it and open the Gov - knowing it won't work but a) it will look like he took action to open GOV, 2) he can blame the courts when shot down, 3) still have his conflict
@thehill Not sure I would agree with this DEMS - your acting like Trump. GOP has got a lot of believers on their side to excuse their actions simply by saying "Obama" or "The DEMS" did it.
@marklevinshow As opposed to what, Trump taking his from Fox news?
@RepLeeZeldin Really, but was she wrong in what she said....I think not.
@navybook @JoyAnnReid that will show 'em.....I get it, and I support it...but...I mean....is this it?  this is our response.....sigh
@kamikazecash @TomFitton @BreitbartNews Yeah, I thought it might be something like that....gee, that tweet though is kind of misleading though isn't?  Must have been an accident or poor editing.  I am sure they did not mean to give the impression they voted.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I want more than his usual crap.  He better explain exactly what that money will go to and how it will impact anything. And you can't claim something is a national security crisis when you have not tried to do anything about it for two years.
@JordanUhl @AOC They also don't understand this is one congresswomen with one view.  That doesn't mean her idea will be accepted by everyone or even passed.  Its an idea. Its a starting point.  It will be either be embraced or modified or tossed as part of the process.
@Truth_Seeker59 @CamelotK @lakerbee @SpeakerRyan C'mon, you act like tax bill they forced through congress cut Gov revenue through huge tax breaks for corporations and rich (and small one for everyone else) while also increasing our debt bigly. Is cutting country's pay while maxing out its credit cards at same time a bad thing?
@bigleaguepol yes, calling her out on her misleading facts and lies was very rude.
@TheDemCoalition I don't like how the term patriot is  used these days. Both sides seem to use it to mean people who have same views &amp; if you disagree then your not a patriot.  I disagree w/ 99% of GOP today, but I would not classify all as unpatriotic. However;  I would in how they do things.
@SRuhle @chriscquinn @MichaelSteele @MSNBC Did this crisis just start?  it must have or he would have spent more of last year's $2B funding to help it.
@politico Those who broke the Republican Party, then took it over, and put a gag on the GOPers who don't agree with them - are trying to keep their control.  C'mon GOPers its time to fight back.
@politico I am not worried because I am sure whoever he hires, or at least the "temporary" one he hires will be the best and have more experience then any one else - just like everyone else he has brought on board.

@Jim_Jordan @TeamCavuto Wrong.  They are focused on forcing a more effective and efficient solution to border security and immigration than just throwing a wall up so he can look good to people regardless of whether it works or not.
@TomFitton @BreitbartNews proof please
@chrislhayes Been wondering the same thing.  Have they produced a detailed  strategy or plan for this "wall"?  Does it detail ALL costs?  The vote should be for more than just a "wall". It should be approval for how, where, and when that money will be used.
@Randazzoj they will adapt
@PsychMovieFans Gus don't be the one who refuses to play the game because he doesn't understand the rules
@ConanOBrien How about a "wall of sound"? we just play Phil Spector produced music over loud speakers at the border.
@thehill okay Lawyers, isn't this obstruction of justice?
@MauteDebbie @politico Yeah, I know.  The ones I talk to are the same.  I have yet to have a discussion which didn't immediately go to discounting my "facts" with a false narrative pushed by FOX which had holes all through it. Then again, who else could defend him and with what argument?
RT @DavidCornDC: Today would be a good day for @realDonaldTrump to release his tax returns.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn Everyone in the country wants this issue solved.  But the issue is border security/immigration - not just a wall and not a wall.  If Trump and congress were doing their job - they would work this without a shutdown.

@AJEnglish @HamidDabashi People are not making an issue of this because of  gender, religion, or race. its politics. Its part of the misinformation strategy being used to divide us by making many Americans fear opinions and vision of america held by others; &amp; to discredit their intentions as well.
@AJEnglish @HamidDabashi Please don't say Trump represents christian white males.  Trump is in his own category of whatever he is.  And the far right christian white makes that support him are NOT representatives of most christian white males.
@politico I have never thought or said Trump supporters were stupid in mass.    But I have to wonder now.  Most of what he does is to send messages to his supporters.  Do THEY believe this stuff? Do they really think this is different? Or a concession?
@thesuperpatriot @BillOReilly Wow, you went to insulting me so fast I can't tell you how impressed I am.  Let me type slowly. FOX &amp; other right media are making a big deal these people &amp; what it means. The others are reporting on how FOX/GOP are trying to make something out of nothing.
@BillOReilly Most of the "Press" is from the right leaning news outlets who are trying to make people think Ocasio Cortez and others represent the entire DEM party - which they do not. The DEMS do allow different opinions within their party - GOP should try it.
@Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi Oh, so your for taking walls down.  How progressive of you.   You know what she meant - stop trying to twist it and mislead people.
@DanCrenshawTX How about politicians stop deliberating trying to create this us against them climate by misleading voters into thinking anyone who does not share you view is anti-american and against everything thats good in America.  Politicians and media are causing this divide and attitude
@brithume Curious.  How much money has trump properties made from Trump being president - both from foreign government buying rooms/floors in hotels, people going to marlago to support trump, AND how much GOV money is spent at those properties when Trump and his team go there?

@funder @realDonaldTrump I'd tell him he is listening to the wrong people and focused on to small a group.  he could "win" and win big if he just let congress work things out and present him  solutions.  He could take credit for everything.   But, I'd also tell him to keep a bag packed and passports near
@NBCNews Wrestle? How is that hard? Country - Voters (all voters) from their state - ethics and principles this country stands for.  Not special interest groups, crazy nationalistic agendas, not saving your own ass.  What they are wresting with is just doing the right thing the right way.
@realDonaldTrump why can't you just say they are against a Wall because there are differences in priority regarding whats needed to fix border security and  immigration issues - and state those differences? All you do is state lies like this to mislead people.  Why they believe you I don't know.
@soledadobrien @SteveScalise My distancing myself from GOP has nothing (mostly) to do with policy.  its about ethics and how everyone seems to be engaged in a fully focused campaign to mislead people on every thing.  I am sure DEMS do it to, but from what I observe nothing comes close to how the GOP does it.
@SteveScalise Most of America:  How about something that makes sense so our country doesn't continue to go deeper into dept such as what was caused by Trump's tax bill
@kylegriffin1 Wait...did he say "fuck" or "mother fuck or mother fucker"?  This is important because apparently one is okay and the other gets people all upset.
@TXorFLmostly @realDonaldTrump Your wrong. There have been bipartisan proposals put forth to the President as far back as early last year with wall funding.  All before he chose to shut Government down. And only an idiot would believe GOP propaganda that those against the wall don't believe in border security.
@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross what she meant to say is "...impeach the mfer"...once appropriate evidence has been found and weighed in accordance with the formal rules and processes of the government with bipartisan approval and oversight and agreement.  Then there would be no issue.
@amjoyshow @JRubinBlogger Sigh....I heard about this on every channel I turned - including MSNBC.  Sorry,  I am not going to get upset about the emotional statement a young member of congress made at that moment with her supporters.  It does not mean her decisions and actions will be unethical or wrong.
@amjoyshow @TiffanyDCross Impeachment MUST be attempted ONLY if their is significant evidence of cause.  If there is evidence (which no one can deny especially the public) and the senate refuses then that shows their character and that the American Government is not long functioning as it use to.

@realDonaldTrump I believe there was bipartisan bill which had some wall funding in it which you said you'd sign and then said no.
@stark_talk @Acosta No, they are giving the illusion they are working the weekend talking border security.
@thehill what he is doing is not negotiating.
@BillOReilly Neither does the President.  he has a idea for a wall.  thats not a solution.  he also had $2B to spend on the problem last year and saw no reason or need or urgency to spin it.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS As expected you are taking 1 comment by one person to paint all DEMs so you can continue to scare you supporters. DEM solution to health Care  was ACA and GOP screwed it up more instead of improving it. You both are failing the country on immigration and I see no infrastructure
@GovMikeHuckabee there were times when the GOP was not far right extreme wackos who supported nationalist agendas ...but here we are. And you know damn well that not all DEMS share the extreme progressive or socialist views.
@therealJEDavis @__The_Bride @SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump another person who doesn't think for himself and just accepts whatever fox news tells him so he can monitor twitter and insult people who disagree with him with comments which basically are irrelevant, illogical, and make no sense.
@ShadySpotlight @__The_Bride @SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump I agree. If he was serious about border security and immigration from a country perspective he would have spent more that the 2% of the $2B he got last year - it seems he just wants to have something to rally his people around.
@SethAbramson The only thing that makes sense to me of why he is so blind to a lot of this...is he knows is on the way out and he is holding on for one big payment from the wall construction industry.
@SenTedCruz @RepRooney how about no term limits - but limits of how much and what they can profit from?
@mcaark @politicalelle I guess my problem is I can't separate those good numbers from the big picture. There are bad things behind the curtain.
@CNNPolitics I call it putting people out of work who can't afford it so you can try and force your way.
@thehill I find his remarks dishonor this country and the office of the presidency more than hers by a long shot.
@soulrelevant2U Your point?  I was commenting on Gaetz not Pelosi and if you want to start a conversation about those who have increased their personal wealth while e in office  we can start with Trump and check off practically every person in congress - both sides.
@CNNPolitics Good.  Maybe their taxes will help pay for that huge debt you increased and don't know how to handle expect for freezing federal pay raises - except for your people
@ABC the fact he is concerned about the semantics of what we call this or what its made of just shows he is more worried about how this looks and can be sold to his base than whats really important. C'mon Donnie - you have a chance here to do something which really matters.
@politicalelle The Reality...this metric, while great, is only one metric of our economy so don't go getting to excited.
@JakeSherman ...sigh....the stupidity and total lack of a clue in these statements.
@thehill Why do we have to make a deal to get something (DACA) back which we already agree to as a country with the DACA individuals who are keeping up their end of the bargain?
@__The_Bride @SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump I imagine in some places it will have an impact and in the past both DEM and GOP have agreed to that but I just think an end to end solution will not be effective and more importantly take funding from other things which need to be implemented.
@SenSchumer @SenateDems @realDonaldTrump Personally, I don't care who pays for the wall. As long as the wall is an effective part to a larger strategy to increase border security and improve our entire illegal/legal immigration process and problems.
@FrankPallone No, no they won't.  sigh. If they do its a victory for the process, not necessarily a defeat for Trump - but they won't.
@funder I get enthusiasm of that moment, but worst thing they can do is go in there &amp; act like they have a deliberate agenda which supersedes everything. Thats what GOP has been doing. They just need to do their job, follow the process, &amp; be transparent about it. Everything GOP wasn't
@GovMikeHuckabee I wish both sides stopped giving citizens misinformation in an attempt to get us all riled up. It divides us. It distracts us. Wish they gave facts of the issues &amp; situations so we can be a smarter and not react solely on falsely manufactured emotions and slanted opinions.
@GOPLeader Wait....but thats not what your actions have shown over the last 2 years.
@MarkWarner @GovernorVA When they don't work it also means the companies don't get revenue which means they have to start cutting people on their corporate staff.  Large companies maybe able to handle that but small companies often live "pay check" to "pay check" like a person and this can sink them.
@JakeWaltonSD @nytimes Trump is only sees this from the campaign promise perspective - not an opportunity to improve border security/immigration. I think it might be not just what he gets but how he gets it which is important to him because it fits his image. Its all about engaging base for reelection.
@JakeWaltonSD @nytimes Exactly, but more than a Wall/Daca trade off. Thats sets a bad precedence because he created daca situation and to be honest - daca is an agreement we failed to keep &amp; it should not require a "deal" to force that. Besides, neither of those fixes the security/immigration problem.
@nberlat Gov is suppose to be an example of what this country aspires to be &amp; help lead us down a path which aligns with principles this country was built on &amp; stands for. GOV is now a reflection of the worst of this country, not the best. And leaders encourage it for their own agenda
@nytimes They are testing the resolve of the country &amp; while  zealots on both sides continue to blame the other - we should be blaming Trump &amp; Congress for focusing more on politics and campaign promises than on  working out a solution without causing other issues like shutdowns
@realDonaldTrump Greatest election? Based o what metric? Not colluded? Still under investigated? Most successful 2 years?  For you personally maybe - what did you do that was good for the country? I'll give you the last one, but you are the president...how popular are you across the country?
@_931721129664 @BarbaraAnnFlrn @RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi Your funny. No propaganda, I rely on Fox news &amp; GOP to provide that - &amp; the DEMS as well. I know what I see, I read, and I hear. I think for my self. Unlike you obviously. You just believe what they tell you &amp; your only response to anything is you don't understand is - its wrong.
@realDonaldTrump Your unyielding insistence for the wall to give the illusion you kept a campaign promise (when you already failed) is whats due to the 2020 election - YOU are the one with the campaign posters  and slogan based on you success of meeting your promises.
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS why are you trying to stay relevant?  We already have enough Trump propaganda machines.
@Big_O_Dad I think its partly the bias against special teams players - but he was the entire package and consistently performed  every year.  He also always seemed to provide that spark we needed on offense - like the third down backs of today.  look at his rush and reception average
The only person who has more all purpose yards in the NFL than Brian Mitchell is Jerry Rice &amp; he played for 4/5 more years. Bmitch is ahead of W. Payton &amp; E. Smith. But no HOF jacket. C'mon. #HTTR#NFL#HOF
@_931721129664 @RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi I speak for myself.  Its my opinion. Just like you just gave your opinion - the difference is you didn't really say anything - just took a swipe at mine. Good response.
@RepMattGaetz @SpeakerPelosi I would actually respect you more if you did more to promote a climate of cooperation and team work within congress - but you are there only to disrupt things and try to force a very extreme far right agenda which many in your own party and state don't want.
@thehill My anger with the GOP is based more on this shit than anything else. Let government work. Follow the process. Congress is not suppose to work for Trump. House votes, Senate Votes, if Trump vetos, congress can vote to override. Failure to do this just means your working for Trump.
@granthpaulsen Reinvigorate might be a stretch. But most fans get you can't win when your offense is gutted at pretty much every position. Only thing I want is smart personnel decisions - no gimmicks - to build on what we have. And for the dysfunctional front office to stay out of it.
Dear Dan Snyder.  Please wait an extra month or so before sending out the annual season ticket statements.  I need a little longer before I want to even think about next season and making those kinds of financial decisions. #HTTR
@NBCPolitics @Morning_Joe He is refusing to allow senators vote on behalf of their states &amp; giving control of the Senate (part of one branch of government) to the President (another branch of the government).  let the process work.  let it go to Trump &amp;if he vetos it then see if congress overrides it.
@DonaldJTrumpJr The hypocrisy of you saying this just shows how out of touch and delusional you are.
@MAGATrumpster @RepMarkMeadows Try insulting people less and making wrong assumptions just so you can be argumentative. Twitter only has so much space &amp;I know all that - but that still is not enough to make the kind of impact we need and putting that everything else is irresponsible &amp; shows ignorance of issues
@GOP Have you really looked at those promises kept? If your cheering Trump then you have no clue what keeping those promises have done.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump You continue to misrepresent the larger problem and issues and try to justify the wall as the savior to all things border security/immigration.  Its not.  its part of a solution, but not THE solution.  And your using it to distract from getting real things achieved in this area.
@Nikitam37415117 @SeptemberDresan @SteveScalise Our two party system has suddenly turned into a competition where your measured by what you get AND by what your prevent the other side from getting.  Its suppose to be where we take input from both sides and come up with a solution which meets needs of the country.
@mattdpearce I can't believe this quote. this is not from someone who really understands Christian values (or of most religions). How do you measure acts of charity?  How does a poor person donating $5 compare with a rich person giving $500K? I know he was making some other point but c'mon
@GOP @SteveScalise Of all the problems we have with Border Security/Immigration - the wall would only impact some of that and it would be a while before it had any effect at all. Sticking to this Wall or Nothing position just shows ignorance and putting party above country. I just don't get it.
@Big_O_Dad @thehill We use to expect congress to fix things. Now, people are focused on extreme positions which must be met - not requirements which need solutions. They use these to assign value to other opinions &amp; rate leaders based on how tight they embrace those extremes - no room for compromise
@ZerlinaMaxwell Seems to me they use the word "likeability" to disguise a darker meaning. I mean we don't talk about "likeability" of male candidates. When I hear this I translate it as the wiliness of the country - or parts of if - to have a female President.
@Big_O_Dad @thehill What gets me is misinformation campaign which forces people to get engaged by taking sides. We then spend our time standing up for our side &amp; arguing on twitter with each other instead of collectively telling Gov to do their job. We need to hold them accountable.
@SeptemberDresan @SteveScalise Is that what I am?  Trying to figure that out.  Is a centrist someone who DEMs think is a GOPer and GOPers think I am DEM so I get yelled at an insulted by everyone? :)
@Bearkat38 @thehill Exactly. totally agree. just checking the box even if it does nothing.  Got them all riled up about immigration, told them who to blame, sold them on one thing which will miraculously fix everything, and use it to continually engage his supporters.
@Big_O_Dad @thehill I think every decision/act he makes is focused on 2020. His campaign slogan is promises made promises kept. In my opinion every action he takes is done to make him (or others) money &amp; they are always presented so can make it seem like he is checking off a campaign promise
@Bearkat38 @thehill glad you found that funny. But please don't think I will give Trump too much credit for "meeting that promise" if this does end with a good security/immigration agreement. I just think those who are sticking to wall or nothing position should see it that way.
@Big_O_Dad @thehill I agree. we all know what he said and meant But i never take campaign promises at face value because a) they say whatever they can to get votes &amp; b) it never factors in  real world challenges. Not sure trump or his supporters see it that way though. he  just wants to check a box.
@KamalaHarris ...sooo....whats the lines to the bathroom going to be like?  I know the ratio of men/women restrooms is often a problem...I have to believe its worse on capitol hill.
@thehill If he folds on a complete end to end expensive border wall that we pay for, but gets a good border security and immigration agreement which addresses all aspects of the problem - to include physical barriers - then I will be happy and consider the spirit of his promise kept.
@thehill Well, I agree he has a lot of problems looming, and I don't think there is any possibility he will enjoy the rest of his presidency.
@ReneeHoagenson and by freezing Government raises...which he already did....
@GeraldoRivera No. That does nothing but check off 2 independent "to do" boxes.  Open the Government and workout a better solution to border security and immigration. I don't care if that includes a wall or not. I want them to focus on the problem-not campaign promises, winning, scoring points
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking I don't think a lot (either side actually) know what ramifications of their votes are or what those in power are doing in their name. They're told who to blame on an issue, &amp; trust what they are told &amp; their leaders. But, there are true assholes &amp; they hijacked the party and gov
@MarshaWarfield you had me a smothered pork chops
@RepMattGaetz @gatewaypundit Sorry, I don't see all DEMS or GOP as evil or believe the propaganda. I won't argue w/ fellow citizens that disagree with me. I will join them as we turn to you &amp; say do your dam job. Stop trying to distract us from holding you accountable. We want results. Do your damn job.
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking I agree whats being pushed by the leadership is pretty close to what you describe - but thats not necessarily what the majority of the people think. GOP leadership is allowing progression of a far right extreme agenda which is close to what you described.
@Reuters I would prefer if you could multi-task and also remember russia, iran, north korea, and all the others that pose a threat....your a big organization....you can do it
@SteveScalise Both sides are playing games. Both sides are inflaming their supporters so they focus on each other &amp; not the failure of congress/president to do their job.  Its should not be about a  wall campaign promise - its about producing sound border security &amp; immigration policies.
@RepMarkMeadows You say "enough with the partisan games" &amp; then go right to "build the wall".  Your concept is right though - both sides are playing partisan games. They need to do their job &amp; produce a sound comprehensive border security/immigration solution  - we deserve more than JUST a wall
@Tigerschweitzer @GeraldoRivera Love how you think all Christians/moral Americans have the same opinions &amp; feelings on things &amp; those that don't agree with you must be bad &amp; unamerican. You obviously don't get what separates this country from others. Different views matter - not just when they agree with yours.
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking Oh, I see the harm some are doing.  But people taking a stance where people are categorized into two groups - one evil, one good - one right, one wrong - is what is causing a lot of these harms. That is how Trump is getting his supporters.
@GeraldoRivera Will it go back to being called a wall as soon as it gets approved? But first step will be if they act like true leaders &amp; take this debate out of the spending bills and work it as it should be. They have already failed the test if they have to do this under a GOV shutdown.
@BillKristol @janemarielynch I think we will see more distancing. Not because I think they will suddenly wake up w/ ethics &amp; courage to do their job, but because of political survival. As evidence piles up &amp; they weigh his chances for reelection they will turn on him fast &amp; early to elevate other candidates
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking My eyes are wide open and I see you are no different than Trump Supporters. You have the same "I have the only opinion that matters attitude". Very intolerant and making broad assumption about the people you disagree with. You make Trumps job easier.
@thehill Republican party definitely needs to fix itself.  ITs being led by a group of people which makes them all look like a bunch of unethical far right extremists.That has become the  the party identity &amp; they need to pull their heads out of their asses &amp; take their party back
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking The leaders in GOV &amp; extremists on each side are not reflective of the majority of people in US.  That outdated idea your talking about is our system of government &amp; how things are suppose to work. Citizens should stop taking sides &amp; jointly start holding leadership accountable.
@realDonaldTrump So, does that mean it comes with huge debt that you will have to find some way to screw people to save money like your freezing of the federal pay checks?
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking Its not a 2 sided condition.  Not every GOPer believes in that far right extreme agenda that Trumps is pushing over the interests of the states &amp; country.  And not every DEM is a far left extreme progressive socialist. They deliberately try to make people think that though.
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking Whats the alternative? Doing things like Trump? DEMS have to put due process back into how things are done. I think some of the GOP will be okay with that - some like the freedom caucus won't, but their actions will be more visible under DEM leadership. Dynamics are changing
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking Not true. I am not talking about current GOP which has been broken since far right extremes rose up during Obama, took it over w/ Trump, &amp;  current members of congress who at best are just enabling it with their silence for who knows what reasons. The GOP is a  mess right now.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Yes!! I am interest in the stocks as well.  I am not very smart about stocks - but I would like to see where he profited from selling long and short as it aligns to his tweeted announcements.
@realDonaldTrump Its not a deal when you insist on one thing with no compromise
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking Not really. I vote more on character because I want someone I trust to "lead" us if there are problems. I want a little GOP &amp; a little DEM in every solution resulting from compromise, but today its all 1 extreme or another winner take all. Hard to get an effective agreement
@marccarpenter3 @ReaderLeigh @Why45huh @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump @Comey Its not that I don't understand.  Its I have an entirely different interpretation of things then you do based on what I have read and watched. I read the available testimonies, watched the hearings, and do not share your opinion.
@feliciaday Well, the squirrel is starting off his year great.  Bet that was one of his resolutions.
RT @DemWrite: Dmitry Rogozin, an anti-American ultranationalist who now heads the Russian space agency, is currently sanctioned by the US.…
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking I think her and a few others - clinton, biden, pelosi, sanders -have undergone such a campaign against them many people  won't trust them right from the start.  We will see.
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking I think she would have been a much better politician and have a better understanding of how the world works, but I didn't think she would be able to work in any kind of bipartisan way with the GOP Congress - they didn't work with Obama and I thought it would be same with her.
@thehill I assume they could afford it.
@PsychRewatch whats in it for you?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I am done w/ this blame game. House/Senate agree on something &amp; submit it to Trump. Trump, sign it.  Don't care if border security/immigration is in it. Get Gov back on line &amp; work it separately - like you should have from the start instead of waiting to use this political tactic
@Frekiwolf @Chuckie406402 @darrellgreen28 thanks for the reminder that a) we are not in the playoffs this year, and b) of how far we have fallen...really needed that now.
@ChelseaClinton Now, just what do you mean by that?  Whats your angle? Uh...sorry....spending too much time on twitter can mess with you.   I meant to say thanks and same to you and your family.
@Tara_Incognita @shaunking Because I am in the middle and thought neither was a good choice for the country.
@marccarpenter3 @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump @Comey we are interpreting things 180 degrees differently.  But, I am sure if what you say is true anyone indicted and found guilty will have plenty of grounds for appeal and the courts can sort it out.
@stradivarious59 @RepMarkMeadows Correct me if I am wrong - seriously.  But we are not talking about a multi-part solution to border security and immigration. We are talking a single element - the wall - being attached to a larger spending bill. Or is that incorrect.
@czabe I am now very very depressed.   Very good analogy,
@stradivarious59 @RepMarkMeadows Both sides are exploiting it, but Trump is not demanding any of those things. He is demanding the wall. I wish it was more then the wall - I could support that.  He ran on a mexico funded wall at a much cheaper price &amp; they have negotiated several times-he agreed &amp; then refused.
Has anyone seen a reference the Trump freezing Government paychecks on the Fox news site? I have not.  I did a search and one story came up for a second, but I could not find it again.  You'd think this would be news worthly.
@marccarpenter3 @DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump @Comey wrong. The warrant is a tool used to investigate things not yet proven.. Dossier was not only thing that drove the warrant. Comey said from what he knew it was unverified, but Comey left before Mueller even started and has no knowledge of what has or hasn't been proven.
@DavidCornDC @realDonaldTrump plus...now correct me if I am wrong....isn't natural confirmation of the various elements of the Steele Dossier will be addressed as part of the Mueller investigation - so maybe we should wait till thats over before saying nothing has been confirmed?
@dotcommodity @alaynatreene @chucktodd @MeetThePress I won't get into semantics, but I get your point.  But I am not sure what you want me to move on" from  I have never doubted climate change was real, but many do &amp; more people are growing up every day. You can't stop trying to combat that "poison" because thats also real.
@VoteSmartDammit @JohnBrennan @robreiner Thats the point. We have NOT. Unfortunately, many  GOP supporters have been taught not trust anything Gov does. Anything done going forward will be 100% distorted by the trump machine as being biased &amp; a witch hunt. DEMS better do things in a way to which make it obvious its not.
@catfish1364 @RepMarkMeadows Wow, your very eloquent and smartly presented factual based argument has convinced me to change my opinion. Good to see those hours watching fox news and listening rush Limbaugh have paid off for you.
@stradivarious59 @RepMarkMeadows First of all, I am NOT the left and many who think trump is an incompetent ass aren't. Trump is the one politicizing immigration the most  (although both sides do it).  And your right about the wall, thats the point.Trump shows no concern for the larger solution - just the wall.
@hill_imani @Variety absolutely. but a lot of responses are not about judging, booing him, or ignoring him. its about punishing him &amp; also continuing the story line. I found his joke offensive, in bad taste, &amp; not well thought out. But rehashing it in media continues to throw it in survivor's faces
@RepMarkMeadows If your boy trump would focus on demanding a comprehensive border security and immigration solution - rather than just getting his wall/barrier/fence/slats he would take the high ground on this and actually accomplish something everyone would be happy with.
@RepMarkMeadows and you define "serious" attempt as meaning it has to be 100% what Trump asks for and you want. Oh, I like how you say barrier and not wall.  I also like how you ignore the fact the impasse is because trump insists on using this to force something rather than work an agreement
@Variety comedians can joke about whatever they want. let them. you have the right to not like their jokes. the right to be offended. the right to think they are ass holes. the right to not go to their shows. not buy their dvds.  they have the right to make a joke in poor taste.
@GOP @MickMulvaneyOMB DEMS love border security.  Everyone loves border security.  We don't love a single expensiveness ineffective action (the wall) which by itself will not improve the larger problems surrounding border security and immigration.
@chrislhayes Thats the problem.  I can see a Government shut down for a good effective comprehensive border security and immigration policy - but not for a "wall".
@_maxvalley_ @shaunking I agree with you. There are some who will refuse to consider another candidate because a) truly believe the extreme agenda behind him, or b) don't want to admit their mistakes. Others will have wised up, but afraid others will stick w/ GOP or go independent based on candidate
@beanee51 @JohnBrennan @robreiner point
@politico Uh...where was the GOPers?
@granthpaulsen Are there any on that list that couldn't be replaced?   How do these rank to other free agents in their positions? Which ones really are ones we can't afford to let get away?
@JohnBrennan @robreiner I hope DEMS take a measured pace to investigating things which include full visibility and bipartisan participation.  Anything which looks like a partisan attack on Trump will not persuade his supporters of his guilt.
@czabe I agree. But also think team was overcome by emotion knowing they fought hard all season, were in a good spot, &amp; saw it all come crumbling down.  The play where Cox picked up one of our OL-men pretty much summed up the season for me.  You can try hard,but sometimes its not enough
@czabe I think its not that we lost key individuals - but we lost complete "groups". QB, O-Line, Receivers (including TEs) - all gone. Breadth/depth of injuries produced an offense which was not NFL ready and I doubt they ever could be. Not one part was good enough to lift the others.
Sitting here wondering why comedian George Wallace blocked me awhile back.  Bugs me to this day,  He was a great follow.  Jokes everyday.
@shaunking My concern w/ DEM nominees will be their acceptance by  people in the middle who had an aversion to both Trump &amp; Clinton in 2016. Also GOP has done a good job demonizing many candidates already so I am not sure whether they can attract voters away from Trump supporters.
@Mimirocah1 @RudyGiuliani I assume Mueller's team just puts all Trump and his legal teams tweets in a big file and looks at them just from an "evidence" stand point.  But, I also think Mueller locks himself alone in a room and allows himself a very quiet private chuckle and says "oh, really"
@realDonaldTrump so, what your saying is NEXT week when DEM take control of the house the GOP members don't won't for things the DEM pushes we can blame the GOP for not voting for it?  Good to know.
@funder :) This is now my favorite tweet of all time.  You get max points for use of this reference.  I go through life looking for opportunities to say this to people.
@Jackiebel12 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The report said there "might" be an issue, AF confirmed there wasn't.  Case closed. Not worth talking about. And Trump is NOT their boss.  He is their Commander in Chief which doesn't mean what he says goes. He must abide to same structure/standards as those under him.
@feliciasonmez Uh...no they aren't
@RudyGiuliani What is the purpose of this statement?  You know he is doing the investigation, you know he is doing it methodically per his time frame,, you know  a report will be coming soon.  You also know other investigations have taken longer and cost more .
@joncoopertweets Someone who has a proven record of governance, competence, understanding of the way things are done in the real world, and NOT someone who is already distrusted by people on the right or in the middle. Sorry that means no sanders, biden, warren, or some others.
@Jackiebel12 @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS He is always campaigning.  And no one said he was - that why the reports said it might be a violation.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @POTUS they say "MAYBE" violated.  It was a legit question because as a 20 AF year vet I also thought visit seemed more like a political rally and wondered how this aligned with the very strict rules the military has.  I never thought the airmen did anything wrong, but I wondered\
@realDonaldTrump Its not what your doing,  its how your doing it.
@zagmundfreud @alaynatreene @chucktodd @MeetThePress We are talking about people who are not going to go search for facts. They  just listen to some one  they trust and accept it.  You need to shove it in their face. But that won't work for all. some deny for other reasons, but those are the ones the others listen to.
@JamboJimbo Good point about the suppression. Documentaries are good, but I would like to see a tv show  where they take  issues of the day and let each side preset their case.  All we get are people of different sides avoiding any debate and just saying the other side is wrong. Trust us.
@DavidCornDC Trump believes the "end justifies the means".  this is not true in government.  Often there is no single "end" goal &amp; the means to one end can serve other goals.  Further, the "means" says a lot about you as a person/country. They show principles, values, &amp; beliefs we aspire to.
@cher Share - if you are as good friends as you say you are she will understand.
@alaynatreene @chucktodd @MeetThePress I believe in climate change.  But I would like to see a program where they take each point the deniers have and address them one by one.  This is an education issue and people are not listening to the right people.  A head on discussion would be beneficial.
@maziehirono Gives  voters with pay raise in a tax change which increases  debt -  freezes federal pay cause of debt problems.  Shuts down Government over wall because he cares for border security/immigration - but has only spent 2% of the $2B he was given for this problem. #DoesNotCare
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump ...and he froze it because the country has a debt problem which he accelerated with his tax "reform"
@MarshaWarfield assume right
@ravenhand @booinsiskiyou @TomFitton My story didn't change at all. I was addressing it strictly from security and use of personal computers for gov work perspective.

@duty2warn I'd tweek that statement - he governs the entire country, but he focuses only on the interests of his voters and the special interest groups which put him in power to keep his base of support so he can continue to pursue his own agenda
@NathanLerner You missed the right answer - the people in congress &amp; media who enable him; and go out of their way to push a false narrative with distortions and out an out lies. And those who use congressional and Government positions to push his agenda rather than represent this country
@JimCarrey I am thinking their sexual activities might be of the...uh....anal...variety cause no one would want to look in that face.....
@YanceyLowndes @AP_Politics I was looking for a legitimate source with numbers.  I am not saying they aren't mostly GOP voters - but I want some clarity on that statement.
@AC360 this needs to be shouted out much louder.  It proves Trump doesn't care about solving anything.  He uses it as the "dividing" issue  to emotionally separate his believers from everyone else. He just wants a conflict to give illusion he is fighting for something others believe in
@AP_Politics I was in the military for 20 years.  I can not recall a single political discussion except one time a Commander of mine who HATED Bill Clinton told me he was our Commander in Chief and thats all that matters.  Who says most are GOP?
@funder I think they are glad the DEMS have more control now.  It means DEMs can force issues they were too gutless to do themselves.
@washingtonpost Well, someone has to pay for the debt caused by that great tax bill the GOP pushed through.  I hope NOW people might see that ramifications of that act and other decisions Trump has made.  Everyone drives profit for the rich and causes problem for American citizens.
@seanhannity and a fullly funded "wall" above everything else  is not a serious approach to protecting the public or enforcing the law - Trump does not CARE.  this is just something he needs to check off.  If he was really serious, he would be working on larger more comprehensive plan
@GOP How about a plan where we start building a wall in key places, increase border patrols, hire people&amp;create better facilities &amp; processes for asylum seekers &amp; illegals, change flawed immigration policies, fix daca, etc. - but no, all GOP cares about is  fully funding the wall
@jeremyherb Just got done reading it. Nothing new. Rehash of old claims I don't agree with. But best comment was regarding how just the existence of "bias" is bad.  Totally agree.  So does Mueller. So does DOJ - apparently the GOP congress and Trump doesn't if you look at their appointments.
@CREWcrew 100% he goes.  He will say he has to as its a commitment and he will point to the congress who went home and he will need to surround himself around people to love him to stroke his ego.
@thehill You keep acting like people don't believe in border security because they don't back the wall as Trump proposes it. This is a total Lie. EVERYONE wants border security, They just don't think the wall is the most cost efficient or effective solution - we need a better solution
@rickygervais @TheGarden @HollywoodBowl I think your next Netflix special should be filmed in someones basement with an audience of about 5.    Or a very small pub.
@thehill stupidity of this comment comes from so many levels &amp; its obviously meant for the people who just believe whatever these people say but what makes me laugh is GOP talking about DEMS going against their own opinions to protect their leader. GOP been doing that for trump all along.
@JRBarrick87 @CNN Thanks
@TheDemCoalition But that requires the GOP to accept responsibility for coming to an agreement AND McConnel pushing it to the President.
@EdOverbeek These deaths happened MONTHS after the problem started.  They had time to come up with a solution.  Incompetent and uncaring.
@rickygervais I am not from the UK - but I suspect its bias from all the fox hunting crowd.
@TheDemCoalition So are you saying you are going to reneg on the terms of the deal you just recently made? I am sure that did not include closing the border and impacting current deal before new one begins...
@neal_katyal Mine too.  38 years....never have I seen a decision or act be made based on a political view.  Even out of Government service...who performs their job based on political views?
@CNN I have a couple questions which I have not seen anywhere.  Were the dreadlocks in violation of any rule or regulation for the competition? If so, has this rule/regulation been enforced or ignored uniformally across the competition?
@thehill I want DEMS and GOP to Both compromise to come up w/ a comprehensive plan which hits every area of border security &amp; illegal immigration issues.  Immigration is a complex system of different policies, laws, and resources - and they all need to be tweaked to fix the larger problem
@Trumpussolini @IngrahamAngle @CLewandowski_ Well, its not news to me. We already know there are problems with immigration - the news is all Trump cares about is a wall which will not impact welfare and benefits "illegal" immigrants get at all. Thats just 1 of the areas they should be focusing on to fix  immigration system
@sam_vinograd @CNN Maybe thats how they got him there finally...told him it was a Rally in somewhere in the US.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS Good thing thats not what they want, only you and the people who believe your misinformation &amp; distortions think that. And I have to ask - why are veterans getting such terrible medical care in your district? I think maybe you should focus on that cause we all agree it sucks
@IngrahamAngle @CLewandowski_ or maybe in a country where there are thousands of murders a a year - one murder, while sad and terrible, in general is not "news".  However; I would say the opposite is true where YOU report it because you can twist it to fit your own narrative and warped message.
@RepMarkMeadows @SebGorka You're conveniently leaving out that the GOP led Senate - which is what counts here - does NOT have the votes so stop trying to misdirect this to blame the DEMS.  GOP senators are also against this.
@realDonaldTrump how about the one you agreed to over a year ago, which you then said no to because you wanted more money for the wall?
@RepMattGaetz are they open?
@realDonaldTrump Total distortion of the facts, but its good to make people who still take you at your word believe you and stick by you.
@RepMarkMeadows The senate majority does not want it. GOPers themselves did not vote for it.
@realDonaldTrump The President is clueless.  Why the spirit of this statement is a good one - his implementation shows total ignorance of the real world and what makes of us stronger and more securer as a country.
@joncoopertweets Nahh..it won't come to that.  Eventually the GOP will be forced to see whats happening. They will make Trump resign (with Pardon) and have Pence President just long enough so he can select another GOP Vice President.
@ChrisMurphyCT he doesn't care about developing/implementing a real effective border security policy or solution (along with a smart fair immigration policy) - he just wants to keep something out there he can use as a rallying cry for his blind supporters.

@nytimes THIS is what he congratulates himself on for "cutting Government regulations" and stupid people believe him. All his cuts were done with no oversight or pro/con discussion and for no purpose other than to make people money -

@brycetache GOP isn't a disgrace. the GOP leadership who enable Trump and provides no oversight is the disgrace. Not every DEM is a far left socialist progressive extreme wacko, and not every GOP is far right white nationalist with no integrity who puts extreme agenda over party and country,
@PaulCro25598911 @BobraSchultes @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I will believe you if you can show me the process for privately collected money to be given to the government for a specific issue.
@thehill Would all federal workers impacted by this please call White House and tell them how you feel?  Trump is using you to promote two false hoods here - one, you want the wall, and two, why the DEMS (and others) don't want the wall.  Open borders is NOT why most are against the wall.
@thehill Suggestion.  You want to "win" in this? Take the wall out, pass the bill, call GOP and DEMSin a room and keep them there until they come out with a comprehensive solution to the security/immigration problem which includes a phased based wall strategy. You win with results.
@realDonaldTrump What deal? Isn't this a spending bill that you attached your wall to to hold the country hostage?  So, other than giving you exactly what you want whats the deal here? We aren't talking a security and immigration agreement right? Just fund the government with the wall or not.
RT @SenJeffMerkley: Last week I introduced a bill to shut down Tornillo immediately because child prison camps have no place in America. Th…
@marklevinshow American funds, not mexico. Way more than he said the wall would cost, and its going to go much much higher.
@JohnCornyn they did negotiate, several times,  but trump  insists he get 100% of what he asked for,  Instead of misleading &amp; point fingers, how bout you get Trump to drop his demand and both of you push the GOP &amp; DEMS to develop a better border security &amp; illegal immigration plan that works
@paco12345 @realDonaldTrump Ok, I can see how you would interpret it that way.  What I meant is the ones who come over here legally and then stay once their visas or green cards expire.  I have absolutely no issue with anyone coming over here legally and staying on a valid legal status.
@paco12345 @realDonaldTrump No - that's not what I said.
I was a MSGT in the USAF. I was trained on ethics &amp; how perception of bias in any leader can not be tolerated &amp; that perception is a real thing which must be avoided to ensure trust and faith in our leaders and institutions. Our most jr military members follow rules Trump ignores https://t.co/1jgE8Hww2N
@RepMattGaetz @CNN @AnaCabrera Why don't you do what McConnel said and basically keep your mouth shut till you guys solve the problem.  At this point I see this as Executive and Legislative branch's fault for not getting their job done and please spare me its the "Dems" or even the "GOPs" fault. #Doyourjob
@NBCSRedskins Health Insurance.
@lynshackklet @RepMattGaetz @POTUS No,its not. $5B is just the tip of ice berg for the cost. They offered a bipartisan solution which included his initial $1.6B request (and more funding in stages). he wants more &amp; is willing to hold other initiatives hostage. I am not against a wall - just its implementation plan
@paco12345 @realDonaldTrump first, why the insults?  is that the only way you can respond? Oh, and Green Cards have to be renewed.
@AnnCoulter I get why trump want the wall - not sure why you do.  With all the problems and issues we have with illegal immigration - I just don't see why you think THIS is the solution. Its just an expensive distraction from the real problems which need to be fixed.
@realDonaldTrump I am more worried about the ones who come over here legally - visas, green cards, etc , and never leave, the policies we have which make it attractive to come here, the ineffective ways we enforce our ineffective policies, and other things a wall will have no impact at all.
@realDonaldTrump @RT_Erdogan You just don't get it....
@lynshackklet @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Your right.  They have had years and fail, but the wall is not the solution.
@JenGriffinFNC @BretBaier which will just generate more coverage and extend it.  Why doesn't he realize if he keeps his mouth shut the media goes away.  A large portion of the  media coverage I see is in response to what he does or says - mostly on twitter.
Two things I know without any media trying to convince me.  1. Trump is making money off his presidency and 2.  America is a weaker country right now.
@peterbakernyt @maggieNYT He has nothing to loose and is running out of time.  This has never been about politics.  Its all about some special or personal set of agenda(s) he has and thats why he doesn't have to worry about political ramifications or process.
@JudgeJeanine @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz The GOP three stooges who are only interested in pushing a far far far far right agenda in a world where compromise is not allowed and its winner take all.  Their kind have broke congress to the point where problems aren't solve or negotiated.
@CNN @RandPaul Its going to cost way more than $5B. I could agree with a shutdown IF he was holding out for funding on a multi-part solution to take care of border security and immigration - but the wall alone is nothing more than an ineffective &amp; way too expensive campaign political stunt.
@pdacosta TRUMP. We are not talking about a security or immigration bill here. We are talking about a spending bill he has deliberately linked to his wall so he could use the all or nothing tactic. He chose to make this an issue.
@NBCSRedskins As a redskins fan, all that has changed  is my expectation for the  the season.  However; thats immaterial. I now am taking it one play at a time. Knowing the next play could be a run for a 3 yard loss or an AP 90 yard TD. Same excitement, same hope, same pleasure, same pain#HTTR
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS No, he did not.  His job would have been to get border security and immigration changes done without having to tie it to something else so can try and strong arm people to do what he wants. He did not even try to solve any immigration or security issues before this point.
@kathygriffin @realDonaldTrump Thats why he is taking us out.  he doesn't want to go there.
@thehill The president/congress now treat every issue as a political contest and use lies, distortions, and other tools to make us take sides - rather than address the issues as problems and potential solutions we all can debate and think about publicly. No real talk about pro/con merits
@realDonaldTrump You won on the hope you would bring thoughtful, calm, &amp; competent leadership to our country - with the hope you would be smart enough to know blindly trying to fulfill a campaign promise is not always in the interest of the Country. You're suppose to lead, not give in to the mob.
@LindseyGrahamSC So tell me how this wall - which will cost way more being stated  - will really impact our immigration issues?  You know they are bigger than a wall can solve.  It would be nice if you actually forced congress &amp; president to solve the problems instead of worrying about a wall.
@LindseyGrahamSC which means Trump will continue to kiss his ass
@foxnewsradio @LindseyGrahamSC I see need for a stronger border security &amp; effective changes to our illegal &amp; legal immigration policies but a wall costing so much more than being represented is not the priority in how we should be attacking these issues. stop playing blame game and distorting  the truth
@GOP Shumer, Dems, and other republicans.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman I want a comprehensive solution to border security/illegal immigration which is more than a stupid campaign promise which sucks funding from other things that should be done.  The wall is going to cost way more than the $5B and a deeper smarter solution should be implemented.
@sarahnferris @jaketapper this might be true of Government workers, but not gov contractors.  it also discounts that the services citizens need - some badly - will not be available.  And if he has never sweated waiting on a single pay check or really understand how that feels  then he should leave.
OMG https://t.co/4ZhBrAOajr
@pattonoswalt Uh.....so hows the career going? You okay?  I mean I see you ever where it seems like, but if you have time on your hands to analysis the calendar....maybe this is your way of reaching out. It will be okay,.
@AP_Politics Democrats and several republicans.   Don't forget that.
@chrislhayes oh, they care, but they don't care about the right things.
Thanks. I never take a candidate's promise at face value cuz you never know what he can control. When he said "wall" I was just hoping the spirit (better security, improved illegal immigration approach) would be his focus. To me a wall is just getting in the way of wider solution https://t.co/W07Id7y0MH
@funder I think as the noose tightens on him and his family - he will work a deal for pardons and then resign.   The GOP will need to push this so they can get an untainted vice president in there in case Pence also is threatened.
@burgessev @chrislhayes good to know the debt we are accruing is making the banks money.
@RepGwenMoore @joncoopertweets he is already in the dark about a lot of things
@thehill @HillTVLive His mistake is trying to listening to his extreme hardliner advisers with their agenda.  he could come out looking good just using his "deal making skills" to broker compromised solutions between the two sides.
@senatemajldr How about you end the year by stopping with the political blame game? Focus more on working out agreements and less on pointing fingers.  Your success is measured in how you get things done - not in getting half the country to blame the other half for your failed leadership.
@SymoneDSanders I will no longer take sides. We have a broken congress &amp; executive branch &amp; I blame them all at this point. Its too easy to accept failed government/leadership by righteously pointing the finger at the other side. Let politicians do that. We should demand more from them all.
@Mortainius @realDonaldTrump Its not the same thing. There is a serious illegal immigration problem by aWALL is NOT the best solution especially with how much it will cost. And Trump could care less about any of that.  But you go ahead &amp; let others think for you &amp; insult those who disagree with you
@KelliDeClerk @realDonaldTrump That is such an illogical statement.  Ypu put responsibility on those who a) didn't cause this situation and b) the minority of those in the Senate.  But do you really think the GOP will get all GOP votes?  I doubt it.
@marcorubio Agree, Walls in strategic places can help, but it needs to be cost effective and not done at the expense (or before) other policy changes and solutions are developed and  implemented in tandem.
@realDonaldTrump No, they don't. You publicly took ownership  by linking temporary spending bill to your pet project to try and force something at the expense of others. Plus, DEMS don't control the senate. The GOP does. Gov will shut down because you put ego &amp; personal interest over the country.
@LindseyGrahamSC Distorting the truth. Dems &amp; sane GOPS not trying to appease Trump are for better immigration policy/stronger border security.  They just don't see a wall which will cost way more than whats being asked for as being cost efficient or effective to the larger problem.
@BobraSchultes @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump And how will that money build a wall.  You can't gofundme stuff like the wall.  its a scam.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump An agreement like that with partial wall funding was offered a year ago - he accepted it and then said no.  $5B won't pay for a wall.  And DACA was a deal already made with people which Trump had America stop upholding our end of the bargain.
@BillOReilly The response to Obama is irrelevant as it has no bearing on today.  The issue is how and why Trump is pulling out, and the ramifications. And when the SEC of DOD and GOP members of congress are also upset you can't act like this is fake news or media bias.
@Jahrtt @TomFitton Don't hold your breath.
@VancityReynolds @RealHughJackman Yes, sweater, singular.
@tedlieu You got that Backwards. YOU should be asking whether not being there puts our country/interests at risk. If yes, then you should ask DOD, DOS, Congress, etc your questions &amp;push for a plan/policy that makes sense. Isn't that your job? Leaving before questions are asked is worse
@thedavidcrosby And also Obama.... find and promote NEW leaders
@JenksNBCS and that includes the van
@MSNBC First question, what the fuck was "That"?
@tonyschwartz I can see taking a stand on the larger Immigration Problem, but the wall is only one component of a larger solution and an effective one in my opinion.  Shutting down the government for just the wall is nothing more than ego driven.
@realDonaldTrump So you think redoing a deal to right size the financial benefits in our favor is the same as Mexico paying? Your deal got us nothing. We are paying for the wall with $$$ which should have been ours all along but wasn't due to the bad deal.  Our $$ is paying for wall not mexico's.
@DemitriDawson @realDonaldTrump No matter what happens Trump will not deliver his campaign promise.  The wall will NOT cost the original $2B or even current $5B he is asking for - it will be cost much more and Mexico won't pay for it.  So he won't deliver what he promised.
RT @paulapoundstone: Does anyone else worry that the closer the consequences of our illegitimate President's criminal behavior approach him…
@ChuckGrassley I don't disagree with many of your tweets because you are a republican.  I disagree with many of your tweets because you seem to have abandon certain things to enable and support the President who is obviously unethical, incompetent, and unfit.
@SteveHofstetter Great.  The mexicans donated 4 million in 3 days....It was the mexicans right?
@realDonaldTrump no we don't.  You ego driven need for a "Wall" as the main solution to a much bigger problem which requires changes and compromise everywhere as part of a comprehensive solution is stopping real progress.
@mumclarion @BillOReilly Who cares?   What does that matter?  Does it make the decision, how he came up with it, or how he announced it any better?
@realDonaldTrump Who believes you on this?  This does nothing but BENEFIT Syria, Russia, and IRAN.
@RepMattGaetz @GovMikeHuckabee @mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump The fact you &amp; the GOP led congress waited till to this point to try &amp; use a Government shutdown to force the wall just shows how much you put self interests &amp; special agendas ahead of this country. You should have worked out an agreement to the real Immigration problems before.
@selectedwisdom sharks are in the water smelling blood and weakness...
@chrislhayes instead of "fighting" how about she just prove she didn't?
@SenBennetCO I would be okay just to see his tax returns and have him pass a sanity test.
@BillOReilly The media is not crying.  They are reporting on the out cries of other political and DOD leadership.
@Jim_Jordan @LouDobbs I never expect a political leader to keep a campaign promise verbatim. While I expect the "spirit" of the promise to be kept, I know those statements are never made w/ a full understandings of the world they will be implemented in as reality and priorities shape all decisions.
Along with the Syria decision - this is quite the nice little gift for the Russians https://t.co/bIU4nioW2S
@JoeNBC and removal of Government sanctions of Russian Companies
@CNN seems a lot of pro-Russia decisions being made...wonder why?
@joncoopertweets wish we had a confirmation hearing which could weight these kinds of things before its too late instead of one that just pushed people through to meet a election based deadline because its more important to have a fair and complete process
@marcorubio second time US has abandoned the Kurds
@seanhannity Yes, who cares?  if the data turns out to be true, if crimes have been committed, who cares?
@NPR Media reports?  Trump Tweeted it.
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka You are so desperate for a win you are trying to manufacture things.   All you are doing is giving Syria and Russia a early XMAS present.
@realDonaldTrump Your definition of justice is different than most people
@GovMikeHuckabee Governor - you joking about this really shows how out of touch you are.
@realDonaldTrump the fact that YOU are president of this country and represent us to the world just saddens me.  You are such a petty lying little man.  A very small man in a very big position.  saddens me and scares me.
@joncoopertweets Not sure dumb is the right word. He seems totally internally focused &amp; has no understanding of world around him. Its like he sees things from a distorted corrupt unethical rich person view &amp; doesn't realize the world doesn't operate exactly like that. His value system is off.
@mehoyum @politico But, that money is still "American" money that is to be used for American purposes. To promote a benefit of a trade deal which is now gained American Money as Mexican funding for a wall is not accurate.
@Jim_Jordan @POTUS Hey - the White House was briefed about Flynn so nice try at distorting the truth
@seanhannity actually, anyone who thinks only one side is "digging in" on these kind of things is an idiot.  And anyone who actually promotes this is a bigger idiot who is deliberately trying to mislead people into thinking a certain way.
@ABCPolitics @ABC @TerryMoran This is NOT the same thing as having mexico pay for it.  Any use of Government funding to fund the wall is STILL the US paying for the WALL.
@pattonoswalt Kick in the stomach.
@politico Correct me if I am wrong....but unless those other "agencies" are not part of the US Government - then the American Taxpayers IS paying for it.  Whether its from an existing budget or benefits of some trade deal or action - thats the American Taxpayer paying for it.
@grantstern Any president (or politician) who committed a crime which helped gain office should be removed rather than postponing the indictment. If thats through Impeachment, fine.  I would wait for Mueller to finish first.  I think its better to have more than just the Cohen related crime.
@AP_Politics @MikeBalsamo1 uh....I thought they said they were going to do that two years ago.....guess its politically better to do it now
@johnrobertsFox @FoxNews @WhiteHouse They are leaving the ship
@realDonaldTrump You make a change several months ago which opened ACA up to this decision.  How about you worry more about fixing the health care systems than you do in destroying ACA.  Also, what we have now should be call TRUMPCARE since you own it.  So, fix it.

@BillOReilly just like Trump and GOPs tweets are focusing nonsense to specific set of listeners who believe their crap.
@pattonoswalt Can I get one as well?
@GeraldoRivera @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yeah, but its not the "most" which is important - its the other stuff we care about.
@GOP @senorrinhatch And he ends it by disparaging another Government agency and basically insulting every American by implying we all act on party affiliation rather than professionalism and ethics.
@realDonaldTrump Check your facts. I don’t think we gave them any thing. We unfroze assets of theirs we seized.
@B52Malmet I would feel better if they stood up to him behind closed doors and helped him understand the path forward that benefits his ego and the country.
@marthamaccallum @BretBaier Didn’t the no partisan bill offered to trump a year ago include $6billion to start the wall with the rest to come in phases? He said okay and then turned aroun after talking to his advisors and said NO all or nothing.
@tickawayday @truth_be_tell @CommittoVote @BuckCope1975 @LibAmerican @Chancellorsview @dennisclaude3 @SenSchumer What we are is broken and the fact that people refuse to see that or at best blame one side or other for it just shows we aren’t paying attention to the right things or holding ALL politicians accountable to fix it. It’s not a winner take all contest.  No one wins that way.
@danger_close___ @SenSchumer I have no comment about trump Schumer or pelosi except to say this is not how government is suppose to work and I blame gop congress for letting this process get so broken.
@LindseyGrahamSC I want my president to find a solution not worry about winning over a single point such as this wall. We need a top to bottom fix of border security and immigration and all he cares about is this wall
@AnnCoulter Not all voters want a wall and even more don’t want an expensive wall we pay for over other things.  He is hijacking and forcing this because of his pet project sacrificing so many other things.
@realDonaldTrump Any qualified?
@BillOReilly Read the transcript. They asked him things investigators several levels below him were doing.  Do you even no how government works?
@WhiteHouse That’s not what they are saying.
@GOP @KellyannePolls No he is trying to force capitulation to ineffective measures at the expense of a comprehensive plan to secure our country and fix immigration
@realDonaldTrump Wrong.  He is not claiming to be a democrat. Like many republicans he puts country over party and recognizes trump is apolitical and a danger.  Gop would be smart to have a different candidate
@BillOReilly But they did not lie. You and so many others who blindly support trump keep making it sound like they did not follow the natural process which they did.
@seanhannity The problem with his hard line stance is it’s stupid. The things he wants will have the smallest impact on the larger issues but it sounds good to his supporters.
@realDonaldTrump Read the transcript please. He does nothing like that at all. Infact if you apply his opinion of bias in general to trump you would kick him out now
@Mitch_Tischler Yep.  I liked that too.   Fans gave the Special Teams some love.

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Comey is not doing the investigation, has been out of office for over a year so why would he have anything to add to this?  he also said he couldn't talk about the investigation. Oh, but he did restate several things which prove you are deliberately lying about many things.
@atrupar His failure to recognize the scope of the issue by his words and actions just show he is unfit, unethical, and cares more about his job and an external far right agenda than this country,

@naretevduorp Deliberately misleading.  If you read the transcripts, you will see he often says he can't comment on areas - one way or the other - which may be or may not be an on going.
@Jim_Jordan America - I know its hard, but PLEASE read the Transcript of this.  Don't let people with special agenda like this guy do your thinking for you. Total misrepresentation.

@seanhannity Actually there was  deal a year or so ago, but Trump after saying he was okay with changed his mind because it only had partial wall funding.
@newsel411 @JamesMay125 @7CJP7 @TomFitton I agree with this.  They are turning a tweet about basic security and IT into a politically biased  bunch of responses which goes off in different directions and have nothing to do with the core point of my tweets.  I think I will stop reading the responses.
@booinsiskiyou @ravenhand @TomFitton Never said Clinton was right. Never stuck up for her. Never said I was OK with outcome of her FBI investigation. All I said was anyone that used personal emails for Gov work should be accountable to a formal investigation (not necessarily FBI) to ensure there was no breach. Ass.
@DJ66DEPLORABLE @JamesMay125 @7CJP7 @TomFitton Not quiet. Just not tied to twitter &amp; tired of responding to people whose only perspective is from a distorted fox news politicized view so they don't understand a government systems or security, just ignore what I say, &amp; assume I am a pro-clinton sympathizer.  Waste of time.
@familysherrod @TomFitton Forgot to explain - workstation and internet access she uses absolutely makes a difference. While someone may not have gotten through MS boundaries they could have gotten into her workstation.  I just set up a network using MS &amp; had to do a lot to secure the workstations.
@familysherrod @TomFitton Yes, MS server is certified for UNCLASS which is way better than CLintons - but her workstation and internet connection was not part of the MS security.  However; if your telling me her emails were collected &amp; reviewed by the RIGHT authorities I have no problem with  this.
@Thankful4Usa @THINKorthogonal @TomFitton So I am not suppose to get angry when you say I am an idiot or dishonest?  I had not heard she had been investigated?  Who investigated her? Serious question.
@familysherrod @TomFitton When I say personnel server I am talking about a non-GOV server which she either owns or pays for.  But, good point. If she used a certain MS service it would have been secure to GOV standards for unclassified data at least.  But, her laptop/workstations would not have been.
@THINKorthogonal @Thankful4Usa @TomFitton Thanks for taking a break from Fox to reach out to insult me &amp; generally act like  a dick. I am not saying the impact of what Ivanka did is comparable to Clinton. I am saying both used personnel email for work &amp; if you demand one be investigated so should the other.
@DepRascal @suzyq10867 @7CJP7 @TomFitton While quality/quantity of info will differ, the ACT was the same. All of the stuff your focusing on is the related to the scope and impact of using personal email. The act itself is wrong (or could be) &amp; that raises the security flag to investigate  to see what the impact is.
@RAG__JJ @springerbuster1 @7CJP7 @TomFitton Policy is different at different gov organizations. And like Ivanka, I &amp; probably every person who works in GOV has used their home PC to work on Gov stuff. The issue is not so much she used it for GOV work, but if there was classified data sent on it.
@Thankful4Usa @TomFitton From a security perspective, the servers are the same.  Over 200 SNR GOV members had classified email exchanges with clinton's server.  That means they put classified data on their unclass GOV systems which is equally wrong. The server isn't issue. Its the data &amp; all are at fault
@Ben_Dahlke @springerbuster1 @7CJP7 @TomFitton Act is the same, outcome might be different. Policy would be using non-GOV systems for GOV work - the law/crime would be related to release of classified data due to putting it on a unclassified system. you investigate the act to see if its policy or law violation.
@familysherrod @TomFitton The aftermath, scope, and potential damage is different - but they both used personal systems for GOV work and from a security perspective the potential is the same.  The act is what needs to be investigated and the ramifications is based on the other.
@RAG__JJ @springerbuster1 @7CJP7 @TomFitton Every GOV person is briefed repeatedly not to put classified on unclassifed systems. What she was briefed on &amp; disagreed with was whether using a private server was okay. Using it for classified was never even an option. It was not intended to have classified data.
@MissTALC23 @AriMelber Apparently some people need training to tell them you can't use bribes and incentives in business.  Its needed because in some cultures the under the table payments is just part of doing business,  but its not allowed by US companies which makes it a challenge.
@Thankful4Usa @TomFitton Her email was on a server. she may have downloaded it from a server to her computer, but all email need a server. it may have been the Trump Organization server, a gmail server, or some other server - but her email was on a unclassifed non-government server at some point.
@XenSmall @TomFitton So you one of those asshats that just look at twitter and insult people so you can go feel good about yourself.  Well good for you. Better hurry, I am sure some TV show is on now and if you don't go listen you won't know how to think.
@DetreckM @7CJP7 @TomFitton How bout I use 35 years experience instead. The clearance level only defines the level of potential damage something can do to this country.  Regardless of which classification level your at - you CAN'T send it on unclassified systems.
@springerbuster1 @7CJP7 @TomFitton I don't care. Thats not my point. My point is an investigation is merited because the underlining act is the same.  I am not talking about an FBI investigation.  Stuff like this happens - local security officers will do preliminary investigation and elevate it up as needed.
@jrob5352 @TomFitton To me, Clinton's guilt or innocence is immaterial. I am commenting on the similarities of the two from a security perspective and the hypocrisy and excuses I keep seeing about how its being handled.
@HembreeRobinson @TomFitton I am only coming at this from a Government IT and security perspective which I am experienced in. Both involve using non-Gov systems for government purposes and both should undergo appropriate security process. Results and damage maybe different - but that has not happened.
@suzyq10867 @7CJP7 @TomFitton Good point, but she is referred to by Trump as a Senior Advisor and she is  involved with GOV activities all the time. You can't make an argument she is not involved with Trump Administration. I am not bashing her. I just understand IT, Government Security, and Government Systems
@ampay @TomFitton Her server was NOT a "secret" server-everyone knew about it. It was not meant to be used for classified data - classified data was inadvertently included in emails by over 200 GOV workers who knew not to send classified data on unclassified systems. This is bigger than clinton.
@HembreeRobinson @TomFitton Well, I just heard about it. And you are off track a bit.  Ivanka's email was on a server-thats where email is kept originally. She is part of the Trumps inter circle so she could be exposed to a lot of stuff, and no one qualified reviewed her emails for classified data.
@7CJP7 @TomFitton Clearance level is irrelevant.  The issue is two senior Government officials using personal email for Government work.  If any level of classified data was on the emails - thats the problem.
@cjptrsn @analyst2501 @Chrissy7012111 @7CJP7 @TomFitton Both sets of emails were on non-government servers. We don't know Ivanka turned over all the emails from servers which held her email.  Plus the authorities who reviewed Clinton's emails and found classified emails have NOT reviewed Ivankas.
@familysherrod @TomFitton Both used non-government systems to send/receive to do Government work. From a security perspective there is no difference.
@TomFitton Question already asked and answered during early investigation.  And when are we going to ask same question of Ivanka?
@seanhannity We have known that since the beginning. The FBI never accepted the Steele data as being 100% true, but as information that needed to be further investigated.  And what is wrong with that?

@ProudResister @MalcolmNance @GOP "unthinkable"?  Of course they will, they already have started putting "anti-trump" statements they can point to once the wind changes so they can say "see, I was tough on Trump".  I think many have been waiting on Mueller to clean up this mess all along so they didn't have too.

@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @AmbJohnBolton @POTUS Look all around the Government at positions not filled.  Trump has deliberately gutted areas which made us a stronger better prepared country while removing positions which could push back on his policies. Look at the state department.
@rando913 @BillOReilly Wow, you are so much smarter than me, but I don't need a book or a report to tell me ALL THE NEWS is bias. I know that &amp; I am smart enough to not take any at face value, see past the bias, &amp; extrapolate from all of them. I am not left leaning, but find FOX is the worse.
@seanhannity Continue to falsely fan the flames. The briefing was limited to  certain congressional leaders (including GOP) and committee leadership. So don't be blaming the "deep state".
@rando913 @BillOReilly Making negative assumptions about someone based on a tweet shows a certain level of arrogance. Not reading 1 book is not a sign of ignorance. I don't need a book.

@vincentdonofrio @Daredevil Just got done watching 3rd season &amp; went back &amp;watched first two. Great show. I really liked watching your character's body language and facial expressions - communicated so much more than the words spoken.  Hope Disney continues the show once they start their streaming service
@seanhannity I am very much against Trump, but the DEMS seem to miss the point that many in America do not trust the "same ole" group of candidates. Clinton, Biden, Sanders - I cringe when I see any hint they are running.  To me, Trumps biggest challenge will be from other GOP candidates.
@BenSasse trump administration failures comes from an ignorance  that any one act has ripple effect across multiple other policies, government, Americans, and there is a connection between US and Global events. In isolation any thing can look bad, but changing it can hurt elsewhere.

@rando913 @BillOReilly You know my one rule is not to engage with Asshats who only use twitter to insult people so they can feel better about themselves.
@realDonaldTrump Can someone explain to you the WALL will not impact the key immigration policies which contribute to that $250B &amp; you are delaying progress on those policies by insisting your EGO project is fully funded at a much more  exorbitant price than you said and by US instead of Mexico.
@politico Can't they multi-task?  But I agree that Voting system and rights need to be addressed priority 1, and there should be no perceived  "vendetta: of subpoenas.  Wait till Mueller is done first. But put ethical norms back in.
@BillOReilly Maybe, but its all true.  What they say about Bush and whats implied about Trump.  Don't blame them because the comparison puts Trump in a bad light.
@BillOReilly Totally disagree, but won't even try convince anyone how wrong this is.  But the Fox news (and others including you) are so in the pocket of far far right agenda you have become a propaganda machine
@thenation I am confused by the take a knee action. I am okay with what Colin started - never had an issue. But this is an ineffective way to communicate with your target audience as many only see the unintended message (disrespect) and not the intended message. Side tracks the discussion.
@GMSarli nope he will make a deal to leave quietly to save his kids.
@johncardillo @SebGorka sigh...do people still believe you?  1. He is not investigating clinton 2. the majority of the donation was years before the Uranium one deal. 3.  she was one of at least 12 people that provided input on that deal. 3. does not matter if it was built or not.
@howleyreports @bigleaguepol Tell me MORE.  I totally fine everything he says as being credible, and don't remember Clinton or Rich being part of the Mueller Investigations.   And every time you say you won't "flip" just screams "I know what he did but i won't tell anyone".
@RepMattGaetz Misrepresenting things here I think.
@granthpaulsen depends on the pen.  and I think you got it backwards - there are those who borrow a pen (or assumed cheap item) and don't give it back, and those who borrow a pen and give it back.
@RepMattGaetz A good portion of the media coverage is usually a response to a Trump comment or tweet regarding the investigation or trying to discredit it and push false narratives.  He is responsible (partly) for fanning the flames here and causing the distraction.
@realDonaldTrump @lopezobrador_ Should I go with the "so, when is he writing the check for the wall?" or "Ahhh, so cute..you think you have years to come" line?   Hmmmm...
@johnlevenstein I am not sure how it’s homophobic.  It’s implying there is a relationship between them similar to a high school crush situation. It did not imply that the fact they were two males was the joke or bad.   Not sure where the negative view of  two guys in a relationship is bad
@funder Informal means unmonitored.  And how would the topics differ from formal or informal talk? So they just talked about girls sports and video games? Or maybe trump ask for a loan. He might need that trump tower in Moscow as new base of operations.

Does anyone feel safer under Trump? Look at Russia, Look at Iran, Look at Korea, and others.
@CNNPolitics Lets make it clear, Trump will shut it down cause he wants FULL payment for the wall.  A wall which we pay for &amp; the price has sky rocketed. It won't help the fix DACA, catch &amp; release policy, chain migration policy, or any of those things which matter &amp; could be solved now
@postpolitics How about first give certain businesses the security standards they must meet - like NIST 800-171 or higher - and then punish them.  Big companies have no excuse, but smaller companies don't have large IT or security staffs on hand to help them figure out what has to be done.
@GovMikeHuckabee I like how you dismiss opinions of her voters. Whether you like her or not, you are  dismissing the feelings &amp; dissatisfaction with the Government which drove them to vote for her.  Also, current GOP congress seems to think there is only 1 branch of Government led by Trump

@BillOReilly I would expect more insight and awareness from you.  You understand the political environment we are in and the need to keep an investigation secret till they are ready to release facts and evidence to the right authority.
@CNNPolitics has anyone mentioned that some of the stuff in this deal was in the deal Obama had started and Trump killed as soon as he game into office?  Great  he got a deal and deserves all the kudos, but I'm thinking he could of had it done a lot sooner without all the threats and yelling
@funder @thehill @SteveScalise As a Senator and leader, what is he and the Trump Administration doing about it?
@Lawrenc21101409 @Jim_Jordan If it costs what he originally said I would not care if they built the wall. it won't help, but it would be nice jobs program. But costs are estimated to be a lot higher and its not going to do anything to solve the main immigration issues. His wall is stopping progress on those.
@RepMattGaetz @realDonaldTrump Stupid statement. You gloss over the fact that that THEY ARE CRIMES.  And the lying to congress was not ancient History. AND if the linkage starts that far back than thats how far back he should go.  You obviously have no idea how Russians operate.

@Jim_Jordan Your such a partisan hack. The wall is the least important of any immigration issue we face today, &amp; there are a lot of them. The fact you are already slamming Pelosi for blocking things is ridiculous based on how the GOP has manipulated the system to ensure NOTHING gets done
@thehill I am not a lawyer. But to threaten congress to prevent them from investigating anything isn't that a) obstruction of justice b) against the rules of what allows you to declassify information and c) blackmail?
@wOlwZPIvoSXCBla @GOP @SpeakerRyan He has no commitment at all except checking off campaign promise. Price of wall has grown way more than he said &amp; DEMS agreed on funding it in increments.   All the bad policies which are causing problems we see today are held up cause of the wall.
@MLSDNSG @imillhiser Exactly. its not working to a solution.  Its forming an extreme agenda to attract supporters, make them scared of the other side, divide the country, and focus on "winning" by not compromising - and people shout at the other side and pay no attention to failure of leaders to act.
@GOP @SpeakerRyan Wrong answer. Securing a border is 1 part of larger problem which needs a integrated solution. Trump is not serious about immigration reform.  Many things could have been worked out except he has insisted on full funding for the wall. He uses immigration to energize his base.

@thehill Trump has his supporters really thinking when he says "open borders" it means literally opening the gates and allowing anyone to stroll in freely.  Thats NOT what anyone wants &amp;he knows that.  he just wants to continue the divide instead of fixing and improving what we have now.

@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I hate Trump &amp; understand the problems caravans create just from a volume perspective.  The problem is Trump administration has proven in capable of handling the situation &amp; their only focus is on political agenda of their actions &amp; not solving the immediate and long term issues.
@AnnCoulter Trump needs to realize there is a difference between high level campaign promises and having a strategic policy based on the good of the country, existing laws, morale principles, and real world situations and conditions.  WTF does close the border even mean?!?!?!?
@Liz_Wheeler @SebGorka The caravan is not the person. There are law abiding, peaceful, &amp; innocent people , as well as criminals and troublemakers - just like anywhere. The border is protected by screening these individuals. No one is asking to open the borders - just that the process is followed.
@RealSaavedra @SebGorka Wonder why that is?  Must be that Deep State thing you guys keep talking about OR maybe its because the political right encourages the type of hate speech and divisive rhetoric which results in it being banned,
@JoyAnnReid I am of two sides on this. I am totally looking at how Trump responds with all the time he had to prepare, but also I don't think a mass migration is normal . Rushing border is not asking for Asylum. Seems like its trying to provoke something. We can't excuse either side in this.
@granthpaulsen One of my favorite redskins.  Remember all the positions he played for the Skins
@realDonaldTrump You  really think your supporters are idiots by saying this stuff.  He was NOT asked to investigate"the other side" and there are no valid conflict of interest...
@QuancyClayborne Disagree.  Its money. Every decision puts money in pockets of his rich friends and himself.  All that right wing agenda he pushes is to appease the base that got him elected and the destruction of america - thats just extra.
@renato_mariotti If there is classified data, it will be same situation as Clinton. Its 2 way communication. More people than her put classified data (unknowningly) into emails sent from their unclassified systems.  This impacts more than just Hilary or Ivanka, and more than their systems.
@DanRather But remember, all those scientists have a political agenda (per Trump) unlike the politicians who deny the science and  say unnatural climate change is not real. They obviously have no political agenda.
@amjoyshow @MalcolmNance it should not be the world  it should be reviewed by same people who reviewed clintons.  Most of classified emails were just people typing things they didn't realize was classified.  This happens.  Her email should have been seized and reviewed.
@amjoyshow @MalcolmNance I don't understand a lot about politics, but after having a security clearance for over 30 years &amp; spending most of that time in classified environments - I do know something about this topic.  What she did is NO different from what Clinton did from a security point of view.
@JudicialWatch you guys really have a thing for her.....I wonder why you are so threatened?
@SethAbramson But he is not wrong.  His core base think he can do know wrong regardless of what you tell them.  And  anything "against" him make them support him more.
@amjoyshow No, I think they are effectively showing what her fundamental beliefs and character are which are more important than issues in some cases (See Donald Trump).  Now, this is more about the state showing how far its has progressed and less about her issues

@RepSwalwell @HouseDemocrats Oh I think they will.  I think as soon as the tide turns (assuming Mueller finds anything) and they can distance themselves from the far right strangle hold on their party they will.  I think many of the cowardly GOPers are depending on Mueller just as much as others are.
@realDonaldTrump Look I get how you want to deny global climate change so we don't have to do anything which would impact businesses who put money in your pocket - but just ignore it and never say anything because it shows just how stupid you are.
@davidfrum Also - he was not questioning the integrity of the court, or saying the they were biased, or that their decisions was wrong based on the facts before them. He addressed the impact of the decision on the country.
@thehill sigh
@joncoopertweets I really hope everyone will take time to listen and think about this &amp; not let years of misdirection, false narratives, and discrediting the investigation close their minds to this.  I hope GOP leaders who have enabled Trump to protect their jobs will use this to free themselves
@ConanOBrien ohhh...ohhh...why did you even have to put that thought into my head?  My brain automatically tried to put that into context and it actually hurt.
@realDonaldTrump Its not about numbers.  its about substance.  why did they rule they way they did?  Your tweets prove nothing. They just attempt to discredit them.  Your doing this for your own reasons. even of they were overruled....why? how do we not know the bias is at the other court?

@ChuckGrassley @TomFitton two different scenarios and you know it.  Why do you want to divide this country through lies which pit one side against the other?  Its not just "politics" anymore.
@realDonaldTrump You are determined to make this country loose faith in the military, the DOJ, the Congress, the intelligence community, the court system, etc.  If I have to bet who is corrupt and has no integrity I think I will bet on you based on your own actions and words.
@ChuckGrassley Big difference. Obama criticized interpretation he felt was bad for the country. Trump accused court of being biased. Not the same thing.  If a court does honest interpretation of a law which some don't like, that means aw might be bad not that they are biased. Trump claims bias.
@realDonaldTrump Please explain to me where point of view and political bias comes in to play when interpreting the law...unless your deliberately trying to push a biased agenda?  What am I missing.
@axios @BretBaier I have never once in my life made a work choice 20 years Military, 18 government contractor, based on my partisan views. And I have never seen anyone else do that.  it just does not come up.  Seems like Trump likes to attribute his character flaws on everyone else.
@BillKristol Good catch.  Your right.  There has been a systematic strategy to discredit every single person and organization in this drama.  Really, what we have seen implemented has been brilliant.  I just want to know who the Spider is at the top of the web.  It sure isn't trump.
@Jim_Jordan more I read this the madder I get for how hard it tries to muddy the water. The classified emails on Clinton's servers were emails sent from hundreds of people. They did not put classified in email on purpose. They typed something which was later reviewed&amp;found to be classified.
@Jim_Jordan Nice try. it doesn't matter whether it was exclusive use or not, it was not intended to be used for classified, classified material was identified by a formal review of the email content, and what does the destroyed email has to do with what Ivanka did. Stop making excuses.

@grantstern @BenMcAdams Before DEMS get too big  a head on their shoulders, its important to remember many  voted not for DEMS, but  against the current behavior of the GOP led administration and Congress.

@billyj1616 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump I disagree with you totally.  But, there is a difference in the President demanding someone be prosecuted which is wrong on so many fronts, and Congress demanding review of how investigation was conducted.  Which they did, but didn't like the ruling.
@CFan105 @TomFitton @realDonaldTrump What law? The servers themselves broke no law. The classified data was not her screw up alone. 100s of people wrongly sent her classified email from their unclassified gov systems.  So you would have to prosecute them all. Also, the DOJ is governed by laws &amp; procedures  not trump

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Yeah, but your approach is based on that  the President  can direct and interpret things the way he sees fit and thats NOT true. And you ignore all the investigations that have already taken place because you want people to think there was either no investigation or it was biased

@seanhannity I don't care about the tweets of a celebrity or any american citizen.  I do care about the tweets of our President and other leaders because I hold them to a higher standard so don't try to equate the two in anyway.
@GOP @senatemajldr Uh, you didn't reform it.  You repealed it didn't you?  Instead of fixing or improving it you just took away the protections it put in place - which contributed to the terrible economy we had back in the 2000's. Or am I missing something?
@NBCNews The fact is you don't KNOW if they were classified. The vast majority of classified emails were not marked that way they were only determined to be classified by a DoD and Intel community review of the emails.
@kylegriffin1 @shaunking He is such an ass.  Sure, all vets enjoy being away from our families especially for things like this.
@ChuckGrassley Finally, a politician who doesn't sweep things under the rug.
@Acosta Wrong.  he is not taking their word,  He knows the truth, but does not care. He is hiding behind their statement.
@NBCNews Good practice
@marklevinshow No. Its upholding the law.  If you don like it change the law.
@JackiSchechner She should be fired for stupidity more than for what she did.
@Ocasio2018 At least she shows her assets....unlike our president....lets see the tax returns Mr. President.

@DemWrite @MaxineWaters Let Mueller do his job.
@RealCandaceO Well if the Government does its job at the border it won't matter who is behind the caravan.  To me this is a test of the Government.  A test they have had plenty of time to study and prepare for.
@mattmfm @MrJonCryer No no no. I think its pretty clear that when it drops its a reflection of the people who are against him...or obama...or something to do with clintons Email servers...or something like that.
@IvankaTrump @GOP And how many mothers were separated from their kids at the border?
@Susan_Hennessey Vast majority of Clinton emails were not marked classified. They were human error of putting classified in emails on unclassified systems unknowingly which was found by DoD/Intel reviews.  What are the odds hers will have nothing classified?  Plus is she NIST 800-171 compliant?
@ConanOBrien or as I refer to it...the new potter movie....even though I know he is not in it.
@seanhannity No, lets not any issue raised by either side go.  They all need to be looked at from a non-biased partisan perspective and fixed so they don't happen again.  I don't care about blame - but we need it all fixed.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC And spinal tap does seem the right way to measure all this.
@maddow I hear about Deep state which I have seen no evidence or signs of, but my limited brain has seen this rise in similar political activity which seems to be marked by same agenda, tactics, and just outside the norm behavior.  I believe this is happening not sure by who though.
@chrislhayes But they can't be "done".  Most feel this way, but its important we don't let it beat us down to the point of not participating.  THATS EXCATLY WHAT THEY WANT US TO DO.  It serves them to reduce the voting pool to those who don't think about this stuff or question anything
@seanhannity Why do you think the desire for a public forum for whats going to be a GOP bashing and attempt to get sound bites they can twist later out of context to support a false narrative wrong?  Whats wrong with an open forum?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Why is a persons political leanings relevant at all? Why do you act like a persons politics are what drive their actions and statements, and you should value what people do or say based on politics?  Most people don't act that way.  You are just trying to mislead your supporters.

@DemWrite What I dont get is how the basic moderate conservative leaning GOPer has not realized just how bad the far right hijacking of their party has hurt them long term. They can get it back from standing up to him and running against his followers.
@avlgal @NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition First twitter response I have ever learned something.  That obviously is not working.  There has to be a standard to hold people accountable or it will just keep happening.
@TomFitton Every distortion/lie you say to discredit things &amp; mislead others drives a wedge in this country &amp; pushes me further away from GOP. All want Election integrity laws but how/when you imply them can have the opposite effect. GA &amp; KS hid behind laws to do just that &amp; stop votes
@Comey You act like you expect someone to take what you say in a closed session and twist you words later on for their own gain.  Come on....no one would....wait...never mind....Gotcha.
@GenMhayden Using the same counting system they used on the Day Trump took office I would say that room was packed and not even enough room to stand.
@seanhannity Don't blame him a bit. after seeing how people distort things said in closed door sessions and misrepresent things - I would want to have open discussions myself.
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition We need an aggressive bipartisan group to look and correct all the problems in our voting system regardless of who the "instigator" was and get this shit fixed.  And stop blaming entire partys for acts of few bad candidates and incompetent people.
@kimguilfoyle Flakes okay, but courage would have been to stay in congress and do whats right.  When he does stuff like this it just seems to me like he is preparing to run for the GOP candidate instead of Trump in 2020.
@TheDemCoalition Thats because the GOP is no long represents the true republic base.  Its been hijacked by far right conservatives.
@BillOReilly What we see now is NOTHING like we have seen before and you can't even compare them.  I see and hear MORE false claims from the President regarding fake news then I see really false claims thrown in his direction by the media.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @kayleighmcenany The DEMS and GOP have submitted bipartisan agreements to the president who first said he would approve them, and then said no....so don't act like the president is just waiting fro the DEMS to start wanting to work together.
@BillOReilly In that exchange the one who showed the most unprofessionalism was the President.  A pushy reporter, common.  A president acting like a big baby and insulting him AND the other reporter.....not common.
@NormEisen the same public rational he gave on CNN for why Sessions had to recluse himself - which had nothing to do with his connection to the case - applies to his situation today.
@SenatorHassan Apparently not with this administration.  Oh they can, they just don't care.
@JudicialWatch As long as you ensure all votes are properly counted and people got the chance to execute their right then I will be happy.
@ScottforFlorida @GOP @SenBillNelson I don't get it.  How come ever GOP comment to any thing where they might loose is to stop the process?  How about finish the process with integrity so all votes, legit votes, are counted.
@BillOReilly Here is the thing Bill, we SEE and HEAR directly from the president.. His comments and actions warrant coverage.  he is destroying himself and other media outlets are enabling him by not reporting and trying to apologize for him.
@marcorubio Hmmmm....so my question is how did they get the republican voters to play along with their diabolical scheme.  Oh wait, are you saying they encouraged all voters to take advantage of the legal process?  And were they unauthorized altered forms?
@RealSaavedra Why do you think it warrants anything more than a passing comment?  He is and has never been the story.  I never watched any news story because it involved him - he is immaterial and not important to any of this so why should we care or they report it more than a mention.
@SenatorHassan The fact that we feel this is necessary is showing no confidence in Trump.  What would actually voting for this show?  It forces the GOP to go on record that they feel this is needed and thats not going to happen.
@JudicialWatch so are you also going to go an uncover the 200+ people who sent her classified information from unclassified Government servers?
@JimGaffigan oh, it is. call me.
@realDonaldTrump He also worked for the gop for many years and he is not suppose to look at those other things. That’s not his charter. Stop acting like he is biased
@realDonaldTrump This is such a stupid deliberately false statement. You have no idea what they look like inside. They have done several indictments and are finishing up now. Lies will not overcome the processes
@realDonaldTrump We see what we see we don’t need fake news media to tell us what we see you do or hear you say
@realDonaldTrump How is he protecting any body? He is charged to investigate specific things and he is doing it. How can you say he is protecting anyone? What is he doing to protect them? He is not charged to investigate clinton
@TheDemCoalition Yeah, those damn scheming, cheating, lying dems - keeping saintly GOPs out of office with their illegal shenanigans.  Thats why you lost the election....wait....no you didn't.
@marcorubio You said it right...convince a judge...I am happy to leave it to a judge....which they rule against you I am sure we will here how corrupt they are as well.
@SethMacFarlane I will believe when Sean Hannity says it.
@GeorgeTakei The funny thing is the only think that makes feel he is really unsave is the refusal to protect him.  Its a "gesture"  which shows something by his response.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman For every bad act you can point to on the DEM side I can point to a bad act on the GOP side.  Stop dividing the country so are in-fighting benefits you and your agenda.  We need bipartisan action to put integrity back into our election system.
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs Why to you insist on villianizing the DEMs on this?  GOP is just as guilty of trying to steal elections &amp; doing dirty tricks as well.  How bout you STOP dividing the country so we fight against each other instead of making sure you do your  job? Get w/ DEMS fix all of it.
@thehill What? Trump trying to say voter fraud with no evidence again....what a surprise.  he said it when he WON.
@RandiMarilyn @RepMattGaetz Nice thought, but too many people make up their own interpretation about what bible says is right. And others very conveniently use one part of the bible to justify ignoring other parts of the bible.  Plus, you have those who twist the bible to their own end to motivated others
@realDonaldTrump Thats not your job,  Its not your job to decide whats bad and its not your job to tell us.  Just what you admited alone tells me it is bad
@marcorubio Thats not quite whats happening here and you know it.
@RepMattGaetz @seanhannity @FoxNews No, that the kind of thing you would expect of people scared of people coming after them and I don't blame them.
@marcorubio well good thing your lawyers are there to balance it all out right? The end result is someone will have to make a call on whats right and its not the lawyers so whats your problem...oh yeah - your side might loose and you want to taint the process.
@BillOReilly I watch most of the the big three cable news channels and while I do see a bias with the left in some cases - it is nothing compared to what i see from Fox News, Trumps tweets, and other related sources.  On one side I see bias, on the other I see a strategy of misinformation

@thehill Huh......the right to concede IS DEMOCRACY you ass.
@marklevinshow what was their objection based on. I think I would find that out before saying things like this.  its almost like you want to get people mad.
@marcorubio The problem I have with the criticism has been that it seem way over the top on the corruption story with no clear statements of what corrupt thing she did was - am I not counting incompetence. Seem the rhetoric has been more to get people upset then identify a real problem.
@StephenKing Wait.....you eat sushi?
@ConanOBrien @MrJonCryer well, when do you stop?  Is there a time limit?
@swatersrn @GOPChairwoman @GOP Totally agree. Most Americans want every vote counted.  But I have not heard anything yet specifically about whats corrupt about this county or what they have done to keep all the votes from being counted.  What am I missing?
@realDonaldTrump So if you did not know him why did you pick him?
@RandiMarilyn @RepMattGaetz Thats not corrption.  Thats not fraud.  The votes they are pulling out have not been counted yet so you don't know who they are for.  At best - this is incompetence.  The deadline is today at noon and 7 counties hadn't finished...so once again whats fraud and crime here?

@RepMattGaetz How is counting all the votes stealing the election? you are fanning the flames and trying to make people THINK something has been stolen when the only thing possibly stolen was from the Democrats IF those uncounted votes are for them.
@GOP @ScottforFlorida Your comments make no sense....Your angry that votes have not been processed properly or counted....the only way that thwarts the will of the people is if they are not counted.  What is the fraud your talking about?
@marcorubio ANY FUCKING FACT OR ACTUAL DETAIL OTHER THAN JUST TWEETS SAYING SOMEHTING IS WRONG.
@politico I think the Press corp should not attend the press meeting BUT stake out congress and keep asking the GOP representatives and senators questions about the president.  Why give Trump a voice or an opportunity to play to his audience.?
@funder @TheDemCoalition BREAKING...from who? what?  Source please.

@LEBassett @joncoopertweets So let me get this straight - per the president we are mad at Florida for not having all the votes counted, but we are mad at Abrams for wanting all the votes counted in Georgia....okay I think I got it...wait...no I don't...
@maddow wait...is this... the FBI who is part of DOJ...which...wait...WTF?

@GOPChairwoman @GOP An important point for all GOPers saying this is deliberate fraud -most of the county is democrat so NOT counting these votes helps GOP not hurts them.
@realDonaldTrump @marcorubio What corruption?
@realDonaldTrump Until you have some real fucking evidence how about you shut up &amp; let them count the votes? There are always provisional &amp; absentee ballots which have to be counted after the fact. Maybe they are inefficient but stop making people distrust integrity of the  process without proof
@realDonaldTrump @BrianKempGA How can you tweet about florida and then make this tweet?
@joncoopertweets sources please
@GOP @ScottforFlorida the hypocrisy of this statement makes me furious. your entire intent is to taint the election and widen the divide in this country by politicizing this. Fact is asshats on both sides have tried to influence the election -stop blaming each other and work together to fix it.
@realDonaldTrump 20 years of military service taught me to respect the position not the man. But now I see there are some times when that just can't be done - especially when that man shows he is unfit and has no respect for the position or the responsibility it comes with
@realDonaldTrump Stop the politics.  I saw no tweet from you about GA situation.  We need bipartisan look at elections system/processes across the country to fix all this.  A candidate can not be in charge of his own election.
@LindseyGrahamSC @ScottforFlorida I saw nothing from you about GA or other places around the country where GOP benefited. Please stop politicizing this. People on both sides cheat, but its not a reflection of entire party. We need a bipartisan look at the election systems/processes across country and fix it all
@vincentdonofrio Wait. Now I am confused which one represents the interest of the president?  Oh wait..now I see... that’s the problem.

@geterdoneb421 @JudicialWatch Man check your facts and stop letting fox news tell you whats going on.  The report did not hit the press till after the election.  There is so much factually wrong with what your saying I don't know where the start.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @WMALDC I am not deep state. I am not democrat, liberal,  left leaning or socialist.  And based on my own observations of Trump I also have no faith in hand picked people trump puts over this investigation.  There should not even be the perception of possible bias.
@geterdoneb421 @JudicialWatch What your describing is a deliberate distortion of what was said in congressional testimony. FBI did there job &amp; investigated to verify it.  Even if what you say is true. NONE OF IT WAS USED TO INTERFERE IN THE ELECTION. NONE OF IT WAS RELEASED BEFORE THE ELECTION.
@FoxNews @LeslieMarshall @foxnewsnight YES!!!  And if that includes a wall both sides agree to among other things then I can accept an expensive.  Not a wall just to keep a campaign promise.  Remember, Trump was given a bipartisan plan that included paying for wall in stages - but he wanted full wall funding upfront
@marcorubio You need to stay out of it cause all you show is your bias.  While I also don't he may have handled himself perfectly what we saw was a two sided engagement where one persons was belligerent and insulting and then they did lie about it. Don't try to excuse that behavior.
@geterdoneb421 @JudicialWatch Fusion investigation was  routine done all the time by politicians on politicians. Some  WAS verified. He was not a confidential source.  He was paid by Fusion to investigate. He gave FBI info after the fact. And source of info to FBI  does not matter as long as its verified.
@joncoopertweets so...is it he doesn't care or is too stupid to no what message this sends?
@BillOReilly Wow.  We agree on this. The divide is close to equal and  real.  And leaders/media on both sides flag the flames through deliberate lies and distortions which serve their own agenda - but artificially spreads the gap by removing common ground.  It because an us vs them contest
@geterdoneb421 @JudicialWatch What does any of that have to do with the data he provided to FBI?  The data was not presented as facts and it was presented with understanding it needed to be verified and it was not used or leaked - actually leak is wrong word - before election so it was not use to hurt trump.
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump You are basically saying the DOJ is to serve the interest of the government - bullshit.  The military also isn't an independent branch of the Government but like the DOJ they do have specific purpose and governance
@joncoopertweets Yep, cripple it like he did with ACA.
@GovMikeHuckabee They are not defending him as a wonderful human being.  They are defending the security his presence did for the Mueller investigation and protection of potential obstruction of justice by Trump. Why spin it?
@JudicialWatch Why are you wasting your time on this? It doesn't matter if they are saints or sinner - the story will be how we handle this when they arrive.
@RepJoeKennedy @realDonaldTrump Lets see how this impacts the mueller investigation and THEN we see how much he will be missed.
@funder @TheDemCoalition But he is MORE than qualified for what this President wants out of an AG
@joncoopertweets establish rule of ethics across Government
@JudicialWatch Tell them why. he went to FBI with his concerns. he never heard back &amp; thought they had dropped it. so he talked to the press.  They handn't dropped it &amp; admonished him for doing it  So whats your point?  that in the testimony &amp; has nothing to do with what he reported to them
@seanhannity You might be the one who needs a clue.1st,  STOP comparing him to Obama/Clinton. Its irrelevant. And its not a massive win for ANYONE. We are an almost equally divided country by voters &amp; the # of seats don't matter if we keep dismissing other side views as if they are immaterial
@votevets but the question is still there....how are they going to handle it.
@politico I agree with this.  And think his personality and beliefs would allow it - but I don't think his advisors behind the scenes will.
@rrider666 @FoxNews @POTUS That reply makes no sense.  It was a bipartisan plan - both dems and gops together.   And do you really think either party has the "best" ideas?  The best solution rests in the middle, but extreme positions and winner take all mentality will never let them get there.
@FoxNews mocked is a little strong.
@FoxNews @POTUS yeah...you have said that before and promised to support bi-partisan action and then said no. This starts with you.  I am hoping...
@MSNBC Its only a waste if its not valid.  If I was them I would focus first on establishing an ethical climate back in the government without being heavy handed and jsut attacking past wrong doings, and begin looking into election system and voting fraud complaints.
@weareoversight @politico does it matter which way the lean as long as what they identify and raise is true?
@B52Malmet Yeah, but half the country has been fed sooo many lies the last couple ears about DEMs they can feed into that belief if they take too aggressive tone and seem to be out for revenge or biased
@realDonaldTrump Now if you REALLY want to have a shot at 2020.  Immediately dump all your far right extreme advisers and agenda which won't go very far and be the president who just forces Congress to cooperate in a bipartisan way.  You would win every time. Your life would be so much easier.

@GenMhayden THATS what they are outraged about? That the blatant political bias of their most well known "talking heads" might reflect badly on their news organization?  Uh...well...uh...I can honestly say the FOX people campaigning w/ Trump has not changed my view of FOX news as a whole
@JudicialWatch they were married by the way
@funder @feliciaday The Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the federal government and each state from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".
@funder @TheDemCoalition @BrianKempGA I get angrier w/ every story that comes out of GA and other places. Everyone who lives in these states who does not share in the anger over this &amp; stand up to demand action should be ashamed  &amp; stop calling themselves patriots. This is NOT politics-its a denial of 15th amendment
@seanhannity I love unbiased news personnel who directly campaign for people.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Easy. Conduct behavior &amp; incompetence of Trumps team. Failure of congress to act as separate branch &amp; provide proper oversight. No ethics. Misuse of governing system/institutions. No morale leadership.Separate agenda above country. Focus on voters and corporations - not citizens.
@GovMikeHuckabee I won't disrespect/dismiss feelings &amp; opinions of many Americans who believe this is NOT usual politics &amp; are horrified by conduct/behavior of this administration &amp; congress's failure of  to do their job.  You may not like how they express it, but it does not make them wrong.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You know, this kind of admits that a majority of the country is NOT happy with Trump and the Administration.  I get it from the DEM side, but the GOP is always saying the majority of the country supports trump...seems they don't really think that.
@RepJoeKennedy @POTUS I have seen nothing from this administration which was not self serving,  done competently, or didn't come with something bad behind the curtain they try very hard for us not to see.
@JudicialWatch to do what?  was it involving throwing our election?  let me know then.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump I don't won't because you ask.  I don't always vote for policy.  I vote based on character, integrity, and how I have seen you behave and perform. Based on your conduct and failure to uphold your office and put the people first - I will not be voting for you.
@AP_Politics I would like to see the demographics for those precincts.
@MajorCBS @drvox This is a) political, and b) a sign his administration has no competence  or idea of how to handle this
Loss of three offensive linemen - 2 for the year, 1 for a month, 2 of them pro-bowlers...loss of start WR for the year....sigh......sigh...it will be an interesting rest of the season season.  Time to step up.  #HTTR
@SethAbramson wait...seriously...that sound so planned...just the appearance of this is wrong.
@DonaldJTrumpJr he has had two years to work this and all he has done is continue to make this the scariest thing in the world and to say no to bipartisan solutions.  This is NOTHING to him other than something he can use to keep his supporters.
@JoyAnnReid What bothers me about this is it gave some one an excuse to go in and "tinker with code" under the guise of the cyber investigation - how do we know what they really did?  I don't like being this paranoid, but the stuff Kemp has done so far has made me this way.
@joncoopertweets apprehensive.  Many people are voting anti-Gop, not Pro-DEM.  If they respond heavy handed &amp; try to emulated some of the recent GOP tactics we have seen lately then they will lose supporters &amp; cause a wider divide. They need to come in &amp; be catalyst for bi-partisan common sense
@JudicialWatch What does any of what side of the media report matters.  Regardless of the make up its up to the Trump administration to deal with it and they have plenty of time.  Based on reports from both media sides - deploying militarty resources seems like a panic move to me.
@WhiteLewis_30 @realDonaldTrump Yep.
@rlobrian @realDonaldTrump Not me buddy.  I have no expectations.  But you can't say the ratings are an indication when more people don't watch fox news. I am looking forward to tomorrow night just to see what all of this early voting and stuff means.   No one really knows how it will be.
@realDonaldTrump If you look at FOX, CNN, and MSNBC ratings you will see that more people are collectively watching other stations than FOX. So any implication that FOX ratings mean the country is behind you or indicate people think that the other stations are invalid or fake just don't hold up.
@JudicialWatch so, is Obama running?  I didn't think so.
@virginia_abel1 @FoxNews @seanhannity How about we focus on now and not the behavior of others in the past.   I am not a democrat and have no love of Brazil or Clinton - but to act like the GOP has not been trying to influence this election tells me you are not paying attention.

@SethAbramson @DebraMessing After Kavanaugh was voted in, he was asked about something negative he said about one of his accusers and how it contradicted something positive he said before - his response was "well, I HAD to say that to win".  That statement says so much about the kind of person he is.
@AmericaFirstPAC @seanspicer @realDonaldTrump How is this different than the "Hollywood" money which is going into local elections? Which the right keeps complaining about as being a terrible thing?
@FoxNews @seanhannity where is remarks will be written and given to him by Hannity an hour before the itnerview
@DonaldJTrumpJr Easy. Trump/GOP were the ones talking about it in attempt to discredit investigation, &amp; media commented on what they did &amp; said.  Most are content to wait till end of investigation. Its quiet cuz Trump stopped talking &amp; Mueller is waiting till after elections.
@SenSanders What is the purpose of the minimum wage?
@VancityReynolds Hey you immigrant, celebrity, Hollywood elitists,  Stay out of our politics stop interfering with our election or we will have to build a northern wall &amp; send troops up there to keep you out - except for when Deadpool 3 or Proposal 2 is filming.  Yes, I said it - The Proposal 2
@realDonaldTrump Have you ever stopped to think that FOX is the only channel that caters to you and your supporters, and the other stations who don't have to compete amongst themselves for viewers.  So comparing ratings really isn't a good metric.
@NormEisen YES!!!
@BillOReilly Flash Point?  Trump is trying to make this a flashpoint.  Most Americans feel this is something that could be handled so much differently, competently, and humanely without "opening the gates" or "Investing millions to put the military on the border".
@DonaldJTrumpJr @barrforcongress @realDonaldTrump All out of state money does is increase investment in a local candidate to make themselves more accessible to the state voters - how is that bad? It just makes them competitive to their  opponents who are supported by their own large special interest contributors. How is that bad
@realDonaldTrump Wish same focus would be given to those who used  their offices to try and suppress the vote.  And how long after midterms will we have to wait to hear you say any losses were due to voter fraud w/no evidence of course. YOU had 2 years to fix this so its your fault if it happens
@LindseyGrahamSC @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Why are you bringing up Obama?  How about you focus on now.  And you KNOW you are falsely representing the economic challenges his administration had to deal with compared to what Trump has had.  But wait till the full impact of his tax reform hits.
@BillOReilly Huge exaggeration of both points and you claim to be fair and bias
@DonaldJTrumpJr Uh, didn't he cross party lines to vote for Kavanaugh and the other Trump nominee?
@JunkScience Most people didn't experience that.  It helped more than it hurt. Yes, it needed to be fixed. But, what did Trump do-destroyed it. Of all the flawed things Obama did for good reasons trump destroyed not fixed or replace. He only cared about corporate $$ &amp; not needs of the people
@granthpaulsen My opinion has not changed. But, the way they were not able to run the ball today and the way they let the other team run on them was SOOOO weird compared to previous games. While the score was close for awhile, this was never a close game and we were never in it
@Russellmania621 They had no choice at all today but to try and pass. None. The only adjustment is Smith went to the one person he trusts Vernon davis.  I was glad to see it.  They need the practice and they weren't going to run the ball or win today.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump OMG You are the one behind all this.  You are the one I see on TV and read your tweets that drives this. Why are you constantly trashing other for things you do so much worse - oh yeah, because they believe any thing you say.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump @MorriseyWV what irritates me the most with your comments is you pick things which GOPers have done in the past or are currently doing now.  GOP refused to stand for Obama and even heckled him.  Next to that this is nothing.  How bout you focus on something important.
@RadioFreeTom Agree
@RealSaavedra I would hear it anyway cuz I am still waiting for her opponent to explain why he tried to suppress thousands of votes
@RealJamesWoods Oh please, don't even try to act like he is not getting compensated. thats the only reason he is doing it.
@MSNBC Wait.  ITrump was on TV for several years and never held public office and use to be a democrat.  Trump is just as much hollywood as anyone else.
@NancyPelosi I agree.
@abdallah_fayyad @TheAtlantic @staceyabrams @fivefifths To the everyone in GA, its about whether you want a person that put the agenda of his party above GA citizens by rigging the voting system. Both DEM &amp; GOP should vote this guy out of office. a vote for him supports that behavior &amp; thats not a party issue. its a character issue
@EgglyMaria @raggapegs @realDonaldTrump Sadly. I definitely see the similarities.  And while I think (hope) we will fix ourselves, its amazing to sit back and look at the dynamics and how fast we got to where we are.
@raggapegs @realDonaldTrump I dispise Trump &amp; think he is a danger to this country. I have friends who think he does nothing wrong &amp; see him as the savior. How can there be such a disconnect? There have always been differing views, but this time itis so extreme. And mine have nothing to do with policy.
Suppressing votes via deliberate act or just plain incompetence is wrong &amp; every person should be standing up against this. This is not "politics" it is just plain wrong &amp; unamerican. The right to vote is what sets us apart &amp; defines us.  denying it is what defines others https://t.co/8PCebmIL2A
@RealSaavedra @BarackObama well if it is, we know he didn't do it because Obama told him to.
@rolandscahill gee...i am glad he isn't telling anyone he is going to make these statements, or anyone is telling HIM to make these statement...someone could make a lot of money that way.  Hint:  thats sarcasm
@Goss30Goss Don't be the GOP!!  don't take action which looks like revenge or spiteful, push ethics, bipartisan, &amp; integrity of process. act as a independent branch of government &amp; perform proper oversite. focus on state and country citizens, not voters or special agendas. Do your job.
Americans are no better/worse than rest of  world. Its our System of GOV, integrity of GOV Institutions, &amp; moral leadership which keep us on track. I have turned away from the GOP because of how they manipulate the system, destroyed trust in GOV, and cause division by their lies
@joncoopertweets so why did this work in Georgia but not Kansas?
@Acosta Translation:  We replaced an admittedly flawed health care plan which was generally doing on an average great things across the country - with nothing.  We didn't fix it or replace we decimated it.  What an ass.
@JudicialWatch You really want to go there?  So your saying that politicians can cause these kind of acts through their speeches and political rhetoric.  Really. I agree.
@GOPChairwoman @GOP @realDonaldTrump So misleading. Obama inherited failed economy rocked by bank/auto industry failures. Praise Trump for taking advantage of a stable economy he inherited, but don't lie &amp; say Obama was economical failure. He fixed issues &amp; put it on upward path. By the way, how is that debt going?
@senorrinhatch So? My &amp; many others disapproval was not based on these allegations. It was how GOP manipulated the process to expedite nomination, his own behavior &amp; temperament, &amp; at a minimum perceived bias in documentation release which failed to answer all questions. You put country 2nd.
@funder While I agree the economy was on the rise when he took office and he was given a stable foundation, I also believe Trump does get some credit as well. HOWEVER. I also agree the short term positive what he has done will be over shadowed but the negative impact which is growing.
@politico I would be happy paying $26B or more for a wall IF a bipartisan group got together &amp; came up w/ a strategy &amp; solution to address all  issues surrounding immigration today &amp; that was part of it. There are so many issues &amp; a Wall alone is not the solution-its a political stunt.
@BillOReilly Both sides and one is worse then the other
@BillOReilly You are the news you are part of all this.
@GOP @GOPChairwoman LOOK AT THIS SHINY OBJECT. LOOK AT THIS SHINY OBJECT. IGNORE EVERYTHING ELSE EXCEPT THIS SHINY OBJECT AND ALL THE THINGS WE TELL YOU TO BE AFRAID OF IF YOU DON"T VOTE FOR US. DON'T LOOK BEHIND THE CURTAIN. WHAT DEBT? YOU HAVE TO VOTE THIS WAY OR ADMIT YOUR MISTAKE.  LOOK HERE.
@FoxNews Good.  DEMS need to focus on building other leaders of their party.  Part of the reason Trump won is because while so many people loved Hilary (more than Trump actually based on popular vote) many are put off by her and the entire Clinton narrative.
@BillOReilly ...Your point?  They are new shows.  there is always news.  they will have other things to report.

@JudicialWatch This is why I think all of this is bull shit and an attempt to discredit the investigation.  They had the steele dossier months before elections and didn't use it to hurt trump.  they released email statement two weeks before election which helped trump.
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @DailyCaller I don't find him credible at all and I just don't see things the same as you.   I listened to the testimony and read various transcripts and then watched Fox news and others totally described things which I personally saw/read differently. So, sorry if I need more proof.
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @DailyCaller I will believe you when that happens.  I have seen nothing that convinces me of this.  I see news reports throwing half truths and out of context facts and telling me how I should interpret it.  I don't by it.  If you believe them great - I don't.
@FoxNews @POTUS Whats your fucking point? Doesn't matter what their character is - no one is saying to just let them all come in. If they try to come in, detain then, and process them appropriately. You have plenty time to prepare for this and lets hope you don't show your incompetence again.
@FoxNews Every day there is a story about things making it hard for people to vote. Kansas, St. Louis, Georgia, etc. Whether its due to incompetence or corruption the impact is evident, people should be held accountable, and immediate work around should be put in place.
@dariusrucker @thebeatles @bobmarley @franksinatra @DianaRoss all good. For me Tom Petty...Sam Cooke... Sam Cooke again..skinny Elvis...Sam and Dave..Stevie Ray Vaughn....and the return of Hootie and the Blow Fish
@FoxNews @POTUS they are not incompetent.  they are  flawed and need fixed via comprehensive reform, but the incompetency is your administrations implementation of those policies.
@realDonaldTrump I agree we need a comprehensive system to fix the problem. But you don't want that.  And how about going after people who hire them &amp; MAKE the demand for them to come here? Its hard to blame the people who are trying to come here more than the Americans who are giving them jobs
@DonaldJTrumpJr Yes, that debt is streaking right up.
@BillOReilly Mr. O'Reily.  I really want to respect your views and opinions, but when you make claims like this which is EXACTLY what Trump and the GOP does as part of their formal strategy - you lose all credibility.  Both sides are guilty of this and you just show what side you are on.
@NancyPelosi How about this.  I want both of you to start acting like leaders, put special agendas and interests aside, stop worrying about firm fixed potions you have to cling to to a) get donations, and b) get votes - and workout some solutions? My eyes will be on both of you
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @DailyCaller Sure.   You stick with that interpretation of events.  A lot of effort has gone into pushing that narrative so I am happy to see that hard word is being worded.
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @DailyCaller So you don't know that GOP &amp;DEMs alike spend millions of dollars on opponent research for the same reason?  And thats why the GOP group started it before Trump was the candidate. They had enough to cause issues before the election whether it was true or not.
@RealSaavedra @CNNPR He does not say white men. he says "White Men radicalized" same as the press says a radicalized Islamic person.  Educated way of saying ignorant white supremacist, nationalist, or nut job. We are seeing more cases of violence caused by them.  Stop making this what its not.
@KayaJones Another deceiving statement. No media is lying about Trump having his supporters.  The lie comes from Trump, Sanders, Fox news, and others about just how many people are against him.  They don't want his supporters to know the majority of America is against him.
@logicrules2 @TomFitton @DailyCaller This makes no sense. It was not fake. It was never suppose to be taken at face value. It was collection of Intel which needed more investigation &amp; some of it HAS been proven.  They had it BEFORE the election but did not release it and Trump won. So how did they throw an election?
@TomFitton @DailyCaller This investigation was started by funding by a conservative group and funding was taken over by democratic side after Trump got the nominations - so PLEASE stop acting like these kinds of investigations are not normal.
@odom_4life @POTUS Look at the debt caused by his tax reform. Look at the impact of regulations he cut (not fixed/replaced) did besides put money in corporations pockets. His properties make more money from vacations/golf outings than his salary.  Immigrants have ALWAYS wanted to come here.
@tedcruz wow really.  Thats great.  Defender of Israel, Defender or Trump.  Wish you were a true defender of  ALL the voters in Texas and the United States.
@FoxNews @MrMikeBlake The military leave their homes and jobs all the time, and many business pay their employees during guard deployments - and to do deploy for THIS at THIS time? Stupid stupid stupid
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Can we stop calling it a massive tax cut and call it a massive debt creator now?  I mean lets give equal credit to all your economic achievements.
@joncoopertweets If this is true, and Trump makes no statement agaisnt this, will people THEN begin to see him for what he is.
@thehill Not sure I agree.  I think it might be worse in that he just doesn't CARE about anything but himself and is promoting the views of an extreme racist, sexist, homophobic, group because THEY provide him the support he needs for his own self serving agenda. The two align.
@funder WAKE UP Trump supporters.  he does NOT care about you, the country, your state or conservative policies.  He cares about a very narrow self serving agenda and he manipulates your support to enable him to do this.
@BretBaier Yes, because this man speaks for all people against Trump.  There is a responsibility for our leaders to set the tone here. Don't imply that an actor or anyone else has a responsibility close to their level.  And was he really advocating violence or predicting a result?
@CNN @CillizzaCNN This drive me crazy. First, I am not a Clinton fan and I despise Trump. But part of why he won was because of many peoples feelings toward her so DEMS need to wake up. And more people voted for her than Trump so GOPers need to wake up.  Both sides ignore the reality of her impact
@oreminsteluspl1 Sadly, I think there are "NORMAL" people out there who support Trump because his extreme promises touch on something they feel strongly about, and they just overlook, igrnore, and make excuses for stuff now.  To admit it would be to really admit they were wrong.
@thehill political stunt timed so it doesn't matter if it fails or not because it will be after the election - why does the Trump supporters fall for this crap.
@IngrahamAngle @KellyannePolls You keep making mistake (deliberately) of implying everyone who disagrees w/ Trump is on the Left. Not true.

@wassdocs @logicalbae19 @BreitbartNews @RealCandaceO @kanyewest @HillaryClinton Yeah, but all Trump cares about is trying to satisfy high level political promises he made to main base of supporters which is not the same as implementing good policies.  And Clinton is irrelevant in this and no justification for trump today.
@logicalbae19 @wassdocs @BreitbartNews @RealCandaceO @kanyewest But the problem is some fans ignore certain things to promote a racer who comes close to what they like thereby enabling that driver to continue certain behavior. Thats whats happening today. Trump &amp; others hijacked the GOP, &amp; other GOPers made concessions for their own good
@wassdocs @BreitbartNews @RealCandaceO @kanyewest Disagree. I don't think what Trump represents is the true Republican party. I think he is the face of the far right &amp; many traditional GOPers have gone along for the ride-which make them complicit. But you can be conservative &amp; not support Trump. They need to get their party back
@Indira_L The big difference I see with the "sides" in journalism is one presents an interpretation of whats going on supported by out of context supporting "facts", and another presents interpretation with check-able facts where we can make more of our own call on what we are seeing.
@parscale I have no problem voting Republican. Accept, the GOP led congress has showed they put party &amp; Trump first, &amp; continually enable worst of the Trump &amp; NOT perform as a separate Gov branch. My anger at trump would go away if Congress kept him in check &amp; put some structure around him
@granthpaulsen This is not even a debate. Our defense is good enough to win or keep us in games, &amp; our offense is good enough to not loose a game. This only works when playing teams w/ average offenses.  Atlanta has an above average offense.  Our offense is capable of playing better and has to,
@BreitbartNews @RealCandaceO @kanyewest The exit from one party to another based on policies or ideologies - I get. But any so called jumping to "Trump Led" party is also embracing his approach and behind the scenes agenda.  You can be a conservative and not like Trump as a leader or how he conducts business.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump exactly
@BehlingDavid @FanOfKindness @4Uidance @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @marklevinshow @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Yeah, that what Trump and Fox news says. So it MUST be true.
@4Uidance @realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle @marklevinshow @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett When they say liberal media, this is their way of saying anything not on fox.  One suggestion - watch other channels.  Lots of what they report is a) tapes of what Trump says, and b) easily verified elsewhere. Just try thinking about what they and fox and trump's team is saying.
@realDonaldTrump The reporting that makes me put the blame on you comes out of your own mouth and tweets..  And I don't blame GOP and conservatives as a whole.  I blame the congress and the voters who choose to ignore whats out there, make excuses, and enable you to lie and mislead this country.
@marcorubio I agree with what you say except the FIRST line.  What do you think causes some of this anger?  What do you think makes these angry people focus their anger? What do you think makes these people think their actions are "just", acceptable, condoned, and/or serve a higher purpose?
@politico He is not the person to go against Trump.  He represents (fairly or unfairly) the "far left, Trump Hating, mob creating, obstructionists".  The DEMS need a composed, professional, caring, strong, inclusive, ethical, leader to provide contrast Trump.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Well, how does it compare to your dad's tax plan which funded his rich friends and increased the national debt by a trillion dollars, and cut Government revenue used to fund the government.
@joncoopertweets Maybe.  I sometimes think he is an egotistic narcissist who looks down on every one, and has no empathy for people or situational awareness.  He is the front for people behind him with agendas and he just channels their beliefs.
@realDonaldTrump The reporting your talking about is rebroadcasts of YOUR OWN STATEMENTS!!!  How can you say thats fake?  We see and hear you say these things.  We don't need anyone telling us what you mean - we see it come out of your mouth.
@politico Mistake.
@Russellmania621 Main difference to me in QB play this year-we don't give teams extra offense series, great field position,  extra time, &amp; a tired defense to go against because we keep the ball longer &amp; don't turn it over. We don't waste good defensive play.  But QB/pass game has to be better
@FoxNews No one - dems/gop/left,/right wants these people to stroll across the borders. The issue will be HOW  Government plans to handle it, how they prepare, and how they implement.  If its a repeat of before it will raise valid claims of incompetence, poor treatment, and other failings
@NBCSRedskins A.  I am more contused by the offense because the line is obviously playing well, the running game is playing well - even though there are a lot of injuries - but the passing game just seems off.
@JudicialWatch Just like the GOP house oversite committee you are cherry picking details that tell a narrative you want and leaving others out which don't fit your narrative.  Lucky your readers don't read the transcripts from the investigations.

You just want division.

@thehill how about real debate with real compromise?  You have turned down multiple bi-partisan solutions already.

@charliekirk11 So misleading as usual. The resistance is to the details  you are leaving out , the acts, behavior, and statements of Trump &amp; his supporters, the total failure of congress to act as a separate branch of Government, &amp; putting a special agenda over governing &amp; leading our country.
This is more than just politics.  Its unamerican &amp; a blatant attempt to interfere w/ our elections. Whatever excuse they used to "hide" behind to approve these acts - they KNEW better.

@politico There is a reason why he gets attacked so much.
@Eugene_Robinson Why do you even listen anymore?  For some reason they made the decision not to speak up and ignore everything, and I just don't understand it.
@thehill I don't blame either party for actions of these nut jobs, BUT both parties are complicit in their actions &amp;rhetoric encourage this kind of behavior in these people. They should be an example for the best we can be as a country, what we strive to be - not the worse of it.
@BillOReilly By politicize you mean draw correlation between the words and actions of trump and the actions of this man. You can ignore it if you want, but regardless of the intent of our leaders words they do encourage behavior like this in those who aren't quite right to begin with.
@FoxNews Until those encouraging/excusing aggressive, criminal, &amp; violent acts realize that regardless of intent - their words provide validation &amp; identify targets for those looking for a way to lash out and behave in this manner - there will be no change. Accept responsibility.
@IJasonAlexander continual manipulation of people to create a false divide based on distortions of the truth &amp; lies to create an "us" vs "them" mentality where minds are already made up regarding merits of a persons words or where they stand - based on what the people you watch &amp; listen tell you
@realDonaldTrump The bipartisan package put together by the democrats and republicans was shot down by you.
@realDonaldTrump I think the news not talking politics is good for you and the republicans.
@axidentaliberal Now with the wisdom of years I try to reason things out. And the only people I fear are those who never have doubts. Save us from Arrogant men, and all the causes they're for. I won't be righteous again. I'm not sure anymore. - Billy Joel
@MollyMcKew I don't think aggressive behavior/attacks on politicians (and others) originate from either of the 2 parties. Chris Rock says, Whatever happened to "crazy"? Its done by people who are crazy enough to act, BUT the actions/words of our leaders gives them validation to act &amp; targets
@senorrinhatch @Heritage This statement just shows how unfit you are and can't read a room.  You won.  great.  But a huge majority of the country was against him.  People who you represent and have a responsibility for.  Your statement shows you don't care about everyone in your state - just an agenda.
@MikeTokes Well, based on GOP attempts to make their supporters think everything the Far Right believes in his being threatened by ANYONE against Trump - how do we know this was not put out by GOP backers?  if GOP can accuse Left of sending the pipe bombs the GOP can be accused of this.
@tedcruz So, your also proud at voting for the massive debt it caused with NO plan to counteract it?  Wow, thats so non-republican of you.
@GOP @SteveScalise No, it won't even come close to settling political differences. It just replaces the players. And we aren't necessary suppose to settle these differences - you are suppose to compromise to find a solution around the differences. Which you can't do if you start w/rigid positions.
@TuckerCarlson Are you SERIOUSLY asking this? You don't see manipulation of supporters to think this country is made up of JUST far left &amp; far right, &amp; you have to pick a side. Debate is only possible when we can work in good faith-today we have firm rigid positions/agendas with no compromise
@SteveScalise Who is this "Left" you speak off?  And I have heard non-GOPers condemn the threats against conservatives so maybe you need to change the station.  And I will tell you what I have not heard them say - that the threats to GOPers was part of an internal GOP conspiracy.
@FINALLEVEL TONIGHT ON HANNITY:  Ice T is another far left liberal hollywood type who demand a "open road" policy where just anyone can drive where they  want in America to without rules or laws and let other people pay for.  We need Stronger Toll lane barriers!!!
@CNN you know - this is not a court a law where just "doubt or uncertainty" has to be ignored.  In this case IF there is doubt, they never should have voted for him.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @GOPLeader Bullshit.  Thats what your entire strategy is.  make people so scared of a made up buggy man that they feel that have to fight against it.
@tedcruz What does that mean?  Israel is a good ally, but are we suppose to blindly back everything they ask? What specifically did he not back?
@DaddyDaddymac trust me, we all are scared on some of them...
@jeffmason1 @Acosta @realDonaldTrump oh...so its okay then,
@GOP @parscale First, this is bullshit and if they have seemed to have gone too far to the left, remember its in response to how they were manipulated to promote the very far right extreme agenda through lies and misinformation during 2016.  But you don't want to focus on that do you.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Uh...its all about implementation.  Everyone agrees on basic objectives but your Dad has have no clue how to implement this effectively or within the principles this country stands for. And your immigration agenda is not the same as those before you. You use it to get votes
@MarshaWarfield Fictional?  Darn, I am am a 58 year old white guy and still want to be Billy Dee Williams (without the Colt 45), but he is real...so...mmm..ok, his character from Star wars.  Yep, I'd be Bill D with a cape.  Now, thats cool.
@BillOReilly Unless they prove totally and utterly inept in dealing with the situation like they did before. And DEMS don't support that statement and you know it.
@politico I continue to try to give the Trump supporters the benefit of the doubt and not classify them stupid as a group - but the more he tells these and other very easily to prove lies and they believe it I have to wonder if they are just stupid or what.
@tedcruz You fought to put money in the pockets of large companies and rich people, to increase our national debt, and cause such a problem with government funding you are talking about gutting programs which directly help people.   Yeah, thats what YOU fought for.

@jonallendc Agree. I think the way the GOP ran the process from beginning to end, plus how Kavanaugh handled himself, made many of the "in-betweeners" unhappy with both the integrity of the process and the candidate himself.
@realDonaldTrump its a disgrace to your failure to accept a bipartisan solution because you are insisting on an all or nothing FAR RIGHT agenda which will a) not be effective cause its limited in scope (and stupid), and b) cost about 20 billion dollars more than you said and asked for.
@jared_whitaker8 @tedcruz Seems crazier you think it is.
@realDonaldTrump Look we are all for better border security &amp;  have no problem spending that much $$$ on comprehensive immigration solution but a wall is not the answer. How about a real bipartisan policy which addresses all issues? This limited far right path your on will not get you reelected.
@RyanSitton @tedcruz as an outsider, from what I have read &amp; seen he is NOT trying to turn Texas into other place. Sounds like he is bringing in common sense, integrity, &amp; an approach to government which focuses on the people, all the people, of Texas rather than a larger FAR right national agenda
@marcorubio Hey man, both the radical right or radical left benefits from this migration and it doesn't matter who started it cause both sides are spinning it.  I do think it benefits the right more because it makes their story of the "Threat" to the US from immigrants stronger.
@BillOReilly and the lunatic right hopes many american see this as a true immigration crisis and scares them back toward the the Trump/GOP side of the equation.   Both sides can spin this politically and both sides will.
@realDonaldTrump Great.  And how does that stop them from coming in? Here is the deal donnie.  Most Amercians agree with you about stopping them coming in - but your administration just does not know how to implement doing that properly.
@SpeakerRyan then how about work to come up with a solution instead of just gutting and removing something which may have been flawed but worked?  Oh I forgot, because certain people would not profit enough.

@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson I can believe some left leaning group is pushing this to highlight Trumps failure in this area. I can believe some right leaning group is behind it so they can "say" the left is doing it.  But, to say an entire political party is behind this is just an attempt to mislead people.

@tmac4congress @AdamSchiff I agree with your statement and this is wrong - but funny I never see you speak up against equally wrong, deceiving, and divisive statements made by GOP about other candidates, members of congress, and the issues of the day.
@GOP @MattForMontana Those statements don't go together.  Trumps objective is to implement a right leaning conservative agenda which also creates profit for him and his business buddies, with no consideration of state ramifications or desires.  You can put your state first or Trump - not both.
@Acosta Some trump supporters are plain fools. Clinton is irrelevant to this situation. stop worrying about locking her up. Try really looking at what trumps done &amp; his character. He wants you to think its a choice between Trump &amp; Clinton led extreme far left socialism. Its not. No way.

@SteveScalise People are not upset over losing a debate.They are mad at GOP behavior &amp; manipulation of the system &amp; their supporters. people acting violent/aggressive are either taking it too far or using it as an excuse to lash out. They are not the norm - but the anger &amp; frustration is.

@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC I wish our politicians had the GUTS and INTEGRITY to run on issues, but they choose to lie and mislead people on what the other side thinks and stands for, and have people vote "against" those lies instead the "truth" of their platform and positions.
@Jim_Jordan Didn't you forget that Glen Simpson and Fusion was hired to start the investigation of Trump paid for by a Conservative group BEFORE Clinton Campaign started funding it.
@samstein THATs the problem. Some think the end justifies the means. But Its the "HOW" we do things which shows the principles of what we stand for, and show what the values which make America great and different from other countries.
@RealGilbertACP The party of the first part....
@jaketapper @KellyannePolls 1. I agree I don’t like her wording but you also need to listen to the context.  2.  Trump is the most uncivil person I have seen in government so statements like this just have no credibility
@realDonaldTrump Those figures could@also be used to say fox is pro trump.  Also those no way claim the news is fake or wrong.
@GOP And that’s why most dems are not doing this but you want to mislead people to energize your base.
@senorrinhatch That’s in contrast to your portrayal as everyone who disagrees with you as falling in this extreme category of behavior. You are equally wrong in this.
@SteveScalise Why do you have to turn having a difference of opinion into "bias against conservatives".

@GOP @realDonaldTrump And so do DEMS &amp; most of America. We may not stand for administration's policies has done or how they are implemented, but please don't mistake displeasure with the administration for displeasure for the men &amp; women of these organizations - No matter how the GOP misrepresents it
@DonaldJTrumpJr I am horrified that the Right part of the senate has turned into your lap dog, put partisan special interests first, and stopped doing their job to lead this country and provide checks and balances on the executive branch.
@DonaldJTrumpJr stop dividing this country with your comments. those resistors are Americans with opinions.  how bout focus on the things they say and counter them rather than just make them seem like the "boogey man" that must be destroyed.
6/6 Not every DEM/GOP idea is bad. Many of ideas raised are discredited only because of party affiliation of the one raising them. But, in many cases they are not even listened to. Congress needs to stop dividing us, start working together, and stop putting extreme position first
5/6 Our leaders are only focused on special interests who fund them.  And good ideas and input for solutions are rejected for "partisan" reasons. Worse, we let them divide us into teams to root them on against the other side - when we should join together &amp; hold them accountable.
4/6 But blind partisanship leaning does not do any of that.  It holds tight to rigid positions &amp; stances.  There is no compromise for the good of the country or progress. Common sense and decency is thrown out the door as political calculations and survival is all thats important
3/6 But its not about winning.  Especially when over half the country is against something. Partisan winning is not America winning. Most American aren't 100% anything. Most are okay with compromise.  Most can work common sense give'n take solutions out with others.
2/6 We don't debate on merit or facts, we classify someone as far left or far right, and immediately dismiss what they say and take a stance that they must be defeated because they stand for all that is wrong with America.  Or so we our made to believe.   We must WIN!! WIN!! WIN!
1/ 6 To me the rhetoric spread by GOP and DEMS have caused a civil war in this country. Every statement is so divisive &amp; serves to make Americans stop seeing individual opinions as things of value, but only seeing good or evil based on what side your opinion seems to put you on.

@senorrinhatch You got your man.  And now, you continue to try and justify it by pointing your finger at others for the problems.   How about you except some of the blame here and stop trying to make your supporters think this was a battle between good and evil?
@DonaldJTrumpJr This is not about Republicans keeping the faith.  its about pure partisan politics so the GOP can get a very specific judge on the Supreme court.  You don't give a shit about the people of this country. Winning?  This is not a game.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You believe in manipulating the rules to support your party instead of serving the country, and if trying to describe the people who strongly disagree with this act as a "mob" so you can marginalize their concerns so you can sleep well....do what you need to.
@politico Don't praise her too much.  She had no choice based on her base.
@LindseyGrahamSC and you played your part in that process.
@senorrinhatch And we won't forget either.  If you think the American people are angry just at the DEMS for their behavior you are sadly mistaken.  The GOP is equally failing in their responsibilities to serve this country and act as a check and balance to the Executive branch.
@tedcruz Senator, your making a mistake if you think its just "DEMS" who disagree with this confirmation.
@LindseyGrahamSC I cant believe your reaction. So your only concerned with winning from a partisan perspective? You care nothing about the opinions and feelings of the people in this country you supposededly represent?
@costareports What each side seems to forget due to manipulation by political hacks is the strong response on both sides represents people opinions not political ideaology which must be fought at all costs. Most People respect other opinions but they make it worthless by linking it to a side
@senorrinhatch @greggnunziata The hypocrisy from the gop just drives me crazy you hijack garlands process and condem dem tactics on lava such. You critique doh and fbi on mueller and slam dems for doing same now. You both suck now own it
@CNNPolitics Hey congress, you can pick people based on whats good for the country. A no to this guy would have led to another conservative nominee. The fight over this guy political or not - raised some flaws which should have made you pass.  But, Trump needs this guy because of these flaws
@thehill I am glad she did, but she had no choice.  The native Alaskans who wrote her in don't want him.
@maddow Trump had to have this man.  Another Conservative leaning judge would make many other people happy and make the elections easier for the GOP - but they are sacrificing their elections so this guy can hear the case coming up about pardons.

@thehill throw out the politics on both sides and there are reasons to vote against him just as there are reasons to vote for him, so why make every no vote sound like the person has some nefarious reason for saying no? Why do you have to disrespect and belittle  EVERY opinion but yours?
@senorrinhatch What a poor excuse for a leader you are . You call what the gop did “a failed nominee” to make it sound innocent and what the dems did a “smear”. You are a hypocrite and we should expect better from both parties
@senorrinhatch really - you don't have another one you could nominate?  I agree some of the DEM tactics were dirty and rough, but bottom line is he has quite a few red flags and you have other nominees - you just don't have one you can get through the process before midterms.
There are so many reasons NOT to vote in Kavanaugh. So many red flags its not worth taking a chance on him.  But, you have people who want him for political reasons &amp; people who want him just because the DEMS don't. This bipartisan  crap has people ignoring their own interests
@senorrinhatch I agree - but isn't this what the GOP has been doing since day one regarding the Mueller Investigation.

@thehill Well, some one is going to have to raise the taxes eventually to pay for the debt you caused
@DonaldJTrumpJr Do you really watch "the media" or do you just let fox news tell you what the other media is not supposedly saying? I watch fox and cnn and MSNBC &amp; all these things you say they didn't report - I saw them report. So can you tell me something specific you think they didn't report?
@senorrinhatch Senator you can't ignore everything that has been said about him.  And it seems he lied about the extent of his alcohol use.  Whether or not the use is relevant or not, lying about it might be, and your ignoring the disconnect between what he said and did is also relevant to me.

@FoxNews @LindseyGrahamSC Your job is not to help him win.  Your job is to collaborate with the rest of congress to solve our countries problems and provide checks and balances over the executive branch.  You can support a presidential agenda, but serve as his puppet.
@GOP @LindseyGrahamSC The GOP started the obstruction of nominees with Garland - a vote of no may achieve a political goal of inserting a delay into the process, but a vote for YES is a clear vote for lack of process integrity and partisan politics over country.  The process requires the facts.
@MikeStefan66 @senorrinhatch Obama, Obama, Obama /marsha, marsha marsha -every excuse goes back to blaming obama. fuck obama  Congress had power we give them  to run the government - not hijack processes and put party before country or do any mudslinging that both sides are doing
@John_E_Sin @molnarnj @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein Thats why you have the investigation...not just to make sure we have a vetted person in that position, but also to clear his name. Its not about politics or anything other than getting to the truth which solves all the problems except for DEM/GOP partisan politics.
@flgators1515 @SenTedCruz @senjudiciary Sure, because you have proof she is lying. You are against hurting a person with unproven allegations but have no problem condemning someone without the same level of proof.
@GlorfiedGirl @senorrinhatch You have NO idea where its a sham or not and you don't care because you are just focused on the "political" perspective of this.  You can fix the reputation part with an investigation.
@granthpaulsen Alex Smith won...that helps me sleep at night.
@senorrinhatch The DEMS are not alone in bringing out the worst in politics. You and the GOP refused to have Merrick hearing for 12+ months and yet you slam DEMS for trying a delay tactic til after midterms while you are refusing a proper investigation to ACCELERATE the process before midterms
@granthpaulsen @TheHogSty I think it would depend on the strength of your team.  Not sure how a definitive statement can be made like that either way.
@Surabees Gee, how brave of them to come forward on something which the statue of limitations has run out.  But, I am sure the investigation will clear it up...oh wait...there is isn't one.
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary Even if you 100% correct - thats fallout from political actions - why does that impact the need to investigate this.
@NBCNews My tolerance with those who treat this (and everything these days) as a red vs blue &amp; side w/a party-when both parties replaced doing their jobs w/taking extreme stands &amp; tricking citizens to side with them when citizens should not focus on party &amp; call them all on their failure
@davyd1968 @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary oh. and maybe you should go check to see who does the background investigations for security clearances and government positions. FBI, DSS, ETC.
@davyd1968 @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary Wow, the kind of comeback I would expect from a foxnews koolaide drinking asshat who excuses behavior based on party &amp; makes stupid assumptions. I don't care what unethical political behavior GOP/DEMS are pulling on this &amp; don't hate Kavanaugh-I want a properly vetted SC justice
@John_E_Sin @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein I forgot to add to my other tweet.  That the statue of limitations for the alleged crime has run out so if they found anything he could not be criminally charged - so back to my question is how do you remove a life time appointee?
@John_E_Sin @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein How would you take down a sitting Supreme court Justice who has a life time appointment?
@John_E_Sin @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein THATS THE POINT.  The accusations are out there. Investigation would prove the existence/non existence of facts, and clear his name or not.  I don't want anyone in a life time position not to be vetted properly.  it has nothing with DEM or GOP political angling on the process
@LindseyGrahamSC @seanhannity Why?  We know what your going to say 1) Its just a DEM political move, 2) its he said she said, and 3) I am sucking up for a higher government job and personal interest by using political tactics to accelerated the process so we can force this vote through before mid terms.
@John_E_Sin @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein No, what I support is a proper investigation and process which is not circumvented by politics.  Why don't you support that?  oh thats right because your "mad" the DEMS are using this as a delaying tactic- when its gets to be a 12+ month delay then you can talk.
@politico Thats the point - there should NOT be uncertainty in a position like this.
@John_E_Sin @SenThomTillis @senjudiciary @SenFeinstein Yep, it could have been, but it wasn't so whats your point?  Are you saying that the partisan political steps the DEM and GOP have been taking means we should not have an investigation.  Political motivation of the parties cancel out the need to know the truth?
@SenThomTillis @senjudiciary I was a very unimportant person in the Air Force.  I has a security clearance for 20 years, and another 18 as a contractor - if any allegation like this had or does come up on me it would have 100% been investigated by the FBI or DSS or another REAL investigative body.
@politico except for their 12+ month refusal to provide Merrick Garland a hearing.  This fact alone is why I can't stomach this GOP hypocrisy and fake anger at the DEMS just to continue to mislead their base this is about anything other than their desire to get this done by mid terms.
@SenThomTillis @senjudiciary How about we have the FBI do it...
I may lose my "man" card - but I have spent the last two days listening to Jann Arden while I am working and I forgot how good she is. #sorryJannArdenForgotHowFNgoodyourare
@KimStrassel Why do you act like dignity and honor is something held by the GOP or the DEM?  Neither is above politicizing this and that all BOTH sides are doing.  You can't point the finger at one without point at the other .
@hourigan111 @FoxNews @Jim_Jordan I double checked and one source it was lower at around 25 Billion.  Last year the DEMS agree to a phased base approach where they would start out with 6 Billion - but Trump (actually his advisers) was rejected as they wanted it all.
Wow I heard the first part on TV, but not the second part. https://t.co/NIFxoMzE6v
@Emma_Dumain @LindseyGrahamSC Graham needs to get rid of the holier than thou attitude about delays in the process after what the GOP did with Garland. His decision to ignore a he said/she said complaint for something like this is a failure to do his job. We INVESTIGATE to see if there is anything-not ignore
@hourigan111 @FoxNews @Jim_Jordan Originally trump said like 2 billion and last request was around 35 billion supposedly because they have to reimburse people for land the wall will be build on
@FoxNews @Jim_Jordan I want tough security and better immigration laws - not a 35+ Billion dollar wall.
@FoxNews Do you notice that its the political parties and their media supporters who get everyone riled up, taking sides, and going crazy all because Congress can't do their job &amp; work together on things? Why can't we stop taking sides and start expecting them to put USA before party?
@thehill @SpeakerRyan DEMs timing of this release was political. GOP rush to vote is political. GOP refusal to process Garland was political.  You both suck. Stop being hypocritical &amp; do the right thing. Investigate properly &amp; go forward. Stop misdirecting voters based on politics - do your damn job.
@beglan_michael @FoxNews Sure we will get right on that.
@beglan_michael @FoxNews Maybe you should read the scope document. Collusion of the Trump team is only the second of three things they are investigating.  Two of which they have proven. And if your excuse for not investigating this is because our country does it - that is just plain stupid.
@beglan_michael @FoxNews They were investigated by a special counsel that lasted 4 years. And nothing Clinton or anyone did or didn't do has anything to do with this case. Even if they did everything you think &amp; got away with it, does that mean we should not investigate this?
@realDonaldTrump See, I don't get this statement.  Rushing this will put people off and make them more inclined to vote against GOP.  All rushing does is ensure Kavanaughs seat NOT GOP votes during election.  He wants congress to sacrifice themselves for filling this seat.
@FoxNews This is an ignorant statement targeted to ignorant people. Probe was started to investigate a very specific scope.  It has people pleading guilty to crimes it found. Not all the indictments have been released and its still moving forward. These claims are just wrong.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr If there was a way to remove him based on what an investigation shows - I would be okay with that as well.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Allegation was not there because they didn't talk to that person.  Investigations look at specific things &amp; stuff like this would come out based on who they talked to.  And of COURSE dems are using this to delay nomination, that does not mean its not a true or needs to be checked
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr How can you say I am judging him when I am the one who wants to see the facts &amp;you are the one who wants to ignore them?  There is a PROCESS to get this position (&amp; other GOV jobs) which require strong investigations into their background for good reason.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Yeah, but should he be? You are ignoring due process. You ignore what you THINK are lies, what people tell you are lies, you judge people based on your political leanings. Both parties have politicized this, but you want to vote on something this important not knowing the facts.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr I said nothing of the kind. I don't care about a delay one way or the other. I don't care if he gets in or not.  Its more important to me to have a vote based on facts. If that causes a delay, so what? You want to ignore the truth so you can get your guy on the court.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr It would be too late for the truth to have any effect. If the facts showed he did what he was accused of, how would you remove him from a life time appointed position that even the president can't fire someone from?
@SenWhitehouse you investigate and get a professional unbiased group of facts to work from. The only reasons this is an issue is cause you trying to do a vote before the election.

@Lisa_J_Buckner @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr the "sacasm font"  is actually a good idea....
@Johnf39261 @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr I have an issue with all of them. And to act like anyone side does this more than the other is naive. However; GOP did misuse the process with Merrick &amp; while i don't like how DEMS are using these allegations to delay hearing - I still think it has to be investigated before vote.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr The truth is the only thing I want.  And to say we will figure out after his confirmation just does not make any sense.  By then its too late.
@Johnf39261 @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr I have no issue with a president nominating someone who backs their political views - I do have a problem when "political" decisions are made to hijack and misuse the processes to serve political interests and not the countries interests.
@AnthonyJMuniz @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr I would be happy with that if it was not a life time position.
@Lisa_J_Buckner @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr My tweet was sarcasm....
@soledadobrien Puerto Rico?
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Its only a smear campaign because YOU won't allow for a proper investigation to prove or disprove it,
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr Based on how negative this nomination hearing is I bet Merrick Garland is going to thank McConnell for denying HIM a hearing for over a year so the GOP could steal the seat.  They were just being nice.

@politico What?  Merrick Garland
@thehill Good - then lets prove or disprove the accusation so that does not happen.  Or is what you really meant to say is "I am not going to delay this hearing till after the election".
@mschlapp Who are you saying this too?  Cause only people who didn't know the GOP refused to give Garland a hearing for over a year just so they could steal the seat would not see how stupid this statement is. A short delay is political-refusing to have a hearing is failure to do your job.
This may shock people, but here is a pro-trump comment.  I do not see his reversal of declassifying the DOJ documents as him backing down to Rosenstein as MSNBC says - I assume he heard the facts and impact for the first time and made a smart decision.
@jbendery @krystalball no man should ever qualify for the supreme court with out certainty of his character - do a proper investigation.
@FoxNews There is no way out of this except a proper investigation by a competent office. An unproven he said she said situation is not in the best interest of this country, Dr. Ford, or Judge Kavanaugh - but politically the GOP won't like that so it won't happen
4/4  You would work with a neighbor or co-worker to overcome issues and come to a solution to a problem. We should expect the same from our leaders and NOT let them divide us. Maybe we should listen a little more to the other side &amp; our own side and call bullshit when we hear it.
3/4 They take money which comes with "special agendas" which push them to extreme inflexible positions and they manipulate and divide us to accept those same positions and force us to take a side so they can get votes. AND WE LET THEM DO IT. Neither side is all evil or all good.
2/4 Both parties want to divide us so we can line up with them and against the other side - the fact is THEY should NOT be divided in working together to solve this country's problems. But they are.
1/4 Today I listened as 3 GOPers described DEMS exactly as DEMS describe the GOP.  Unethical, partisan, anti-american, separate agenda,no integrity. The fact so many Americans have the same strong feelings about each other clearly shows we all are being fed a bunch of horse shit.
@MarshaWarfield Easy.  Everyone acts like an asshole sometime - its part of being human.  A Racist is a professional asshole that has no excuse/justification for his/her permanent "assholeness" other than stupidity, ignorance, intolerance, lack of religious values, mean spiritness, &amp; pettiness

@FoxNews so  we are NOT suppose to believe anonymous sources when they speak bad about Trump - but Trump can fire or go after people based on things said by antonymous sources?  I'm confused.  If he investigates Ron, does that mean we can open more investigations on Trump?
@teamplayer2017 @NoahCRothman @benshapiro No, not at all.  Just like she should not be labeled a liar or a just a political trick until proven false.  Thats the point.  In this situation, where the stakes are so high - it needs to be properly investigated. We can't make an assumption or judgement in either direction.
@CNN You asshat anti American piece of shit. If you were doing your job you would be leading this country instead focusing on pure partisan special interest agenda. You have no integrity no ethics no  sense of right or wrong or caring for the principles this country was built on.
@realDonaldTrump Gop says this is a dem political move but the gop refusal of proper investigation is also political as a) they want to hide potetential harmful facts (maybe) or b) rush vote before election
@realDonaldTrump Facts don’t matter to the people who refuse to have something investigated properly
@SteveSchmidtSES they just don't get it,....
@NoahCRothman @benshapiro Here is the thing - political motivations of the DEM and GOP aside - the core of this is the nature of the complaint, whether its true or not, &amp; the process which is used to verify it one way or the other,  Political motivation is the noise hiding the truth.
Even if it’s a orchestrated bit of politics done to delay the vote, so what,  it worked. It worked cuz even if there is the potential of an issue it must be investigated properly and fully regardless of the outcome. Or will it be another process corrupted by the GOP? https://t.co/Axv0IxdAJ5

@floyd_patrick @DonaldJTrumpJr it does not matter who did it. If thats what you think "doing their job is" then there is nothing i can say. I am not naive &amp; I know politics plays a part in everything but that has now become the primary driver over leading this country and doing what they were elected for.
@floyd_patrick @DonaldJTrumpJr Obama did win the election &amp; the GOP run congress refused to do their job for over a year. You are just pathetic - spouting fox new bullets and ignoring whats going on. Its not bout Dem or GOP. its about congress doing their job and stop acting like its winner take all.
@floyd_patrick @DonaldJTrumpJr And its one thing to delay something a month or two if there is significant reason.  its another thing to refuse to process a nominee. personally, I don;t care about the midterm elections.  I just don't think the process is being done without bias or full disclosure.
@floyd_patrick @DonaldJTrumpJr Did you read it? Biden said this 26 YEARS ago &amp; Obama disagreed when it was brought up. Plus no one did it. Even if they had , it would have been wrong so whats your point? There is nothing that compares to GOP stopping Garland process for a year+ &amp; not having full disclosure now
@floyd_patrick @DonaldJTrumpJr Thats really an uninformed statement and it makes no sense. It wasn't DEMS that refused to let a President's SC nominee even have a hearing for over a year. And I love how you excuse bad behavior because you think someone else did it.  You should be mad at ANY of them doing it
@costareports @RosLehtinen @realDonaldTrump Maybe she should ask for it.
@FoxNews @seanhannity Not true.  If the Trump tried to pursue things in a bipartisan way and compromise instead of sticking to an all or nothing agenda which benefits on certain special interests and personal agendas things could be better than they have been for a long time.
@GOP @kayleighmcenany Thats because thats ALL they got.  Sadly, they abandon their own fiscal views and put out a tax plan which is dangerous to our country just so they can put money in certain pockets and keep their jobs

@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine I agree.  I honestly feel with right GOP leadership he could be a good driver (or cheer leader) for conservative policies, but the people pushing him are not serving him well and the GOP itself is enabling him.  They could have been so much smarter on how they handle this.
@M1A1BURNER @RobertCakora @DonaldJTrumpJr FOX viewership is bigger than CNN &amp; MSNBC combined so both sides are covered. The problem is they aren't providing "facts".

@RobertCakora @M1A1BURNER @DonaldJTrumpJr Nahh, I don't listen or believe any of the propaganda.  i think for myself.  You should try it.
@Enoch29657775 @SebGorka @BarackObama @JesseBWatters @RealDrGina @WattersWorld @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider @foxnewsvideo According to Fox news - Black Employment has been steadily going up for years.
@PrestonSmith94 Happy for you and for me.  One of the best Sundays I have had in awhile and since my mood is tied directly to the game....it worked out for both of us. HTTR
@M1A1BURNER @DonaldJTrumpJr So your comparing someone who tweets to some one who is part of the media and ALREADY has his other larger media outlets to spread whatever he wants to talk about. He doesn't rely on tweets. This is a business to him.
@M1A1BURNER @DonaldJTrumpJr yeah, I...my bad...but that sounds like Trump's  recent tweets.
@sis2catbat @DonaldJTrumpJr Ooooo... Man...its early and start of the NFL season...I am distracting...what an idiot :) I deserve that one
@FoxNews @dbongino Personally, I think it was Tea Party members who started gaining influence which kept the congress from working w/ the president which caused it.  Which has led to today's fractured GOP where even the "good" ones have refused to fight for party or country. But I could be wrong.
@FoxNews well its fair since Trump is taking credit for things  Obama put in place.  Look, Trump has done things which are good for the economy, but he also is falsely taking credit for upturns which have been risings steadily since Obama &amp; ignoring the added debt his Tax plan has caused
@Marmel @LindseyGrahamSC Read his tweets, listen to him talk, watch what he does....then you will get it.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine Yeah, maybe we should ask WHY?  And its not so much Trump - its how the entire GOP is operating now.
@JudgeJeanine and we have him cause he paid people who could influence voters NOT to talk &amp; maybe Russia had a hand in it &amp; Comey's public comments, the biased Enquirer propaganda, &amp; all those bias DOJ people who were out to get Trump NOT NOT NOT leaking the Steele Dossier before the election.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hey, uh...doesn't Jones have his own website?  So...he still has a platform for the people who want to listen to him right?  So, please don't act like he is being deprived of his fist commandment rights.
@SRuhle @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump NEW???This just fits what many have thought all along. its the behavior I've seen which makes me think he is unfit. but these stories don't make me any happier.  I already "think" thats how he is, but I don't like forming opinions based on collaborated anonymous sources
@KamalaHarris @melissafumero I am not sure if I want or don't want Kavanaugh - I do want an open and fair process with full disclosure of all documents.
@maziehirono @TomArnold wait - where did they get the money?  Or are they using the money they were begging for a month ago.  I have to agree any organization investing this much or any amount in a Judge seems to imply they expect that person to already have made their mind on things.
@seanhannity PLEASE DO!  Step 1 Find out who it is, Step 2 question and accuse him/her, Step 3 his lawyer calls other people to confirm his/her story, Step 4....its all out in the open. PLEASE DO!!!
@iamstephbeatz I have been having a rough couple days...this made me smile.  YES!!!
@topdeck55 I had no idea....they were gone in the first place.  noticed some changes (none I really like) and just thought it was cause people were taking off before the football season started.
@sirkicksalot176 @JustBeaTee @FoxNewsResearch @BarackObama you aren't looking at all the numbers. just what he is showing you.  even fox news tweeted some numbers the past week on more than one occasion which shows things a little different then trump says...but credit was not my point.  it was how they misrepresent the facts
@Jim_Jordan So misleading you unethical piece of crap. GOP started this investigation DEMS just continued it. Steele was concerned about Trump because what he found out &amp; regardless-the investigation is verifying the dossier not promoting it as truth. You act like this should all be ignored.
@FoxNewsResearch @BarackObama Man - you are totally forgetting the context of where the economy was at the start of his time and office and what he had to deal with.  I am not saying he gets all credit and trump gets none - but this is so misleading, out of context, and deliberately divisive.

@politico I am sure he will.  Wish the GOP would be fair in what and who they target though.  seems they pick and choose whats unethical based on whether the person or action helps them. How can GOP supporters NOT see that?

@realDonaldTrump They don't have to investigate - they KNOW.  They said they totally know who it is and confirmed it.   Its only anonymous to the readers.  So, its not like just anybody asked them to publish this.
@CarolHenson1978 @FoxNews @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton That makes no sense.  McConnel &amp; the GOP controlled the process &amp; would not schedule a hearing. Appointment of a Supreme court justice is HUGE for any president &amp;to say Obama was okay to wait over a year is just crazy. He put forth the nomination and McConnel sat on it.
@FoxNews @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton No, they are mad for a lot of things to include how the GOP stole one Supreme Court nominee by refusing to give Garland a hearing for over a year AND that you are holding back documents.

@realDonaldTrump Sure, if for national security purposes we can also  have public hearings where he/she can tell all and we can call witnesses from your administration and put them on the stand under oath....how bout we do that.

@joaniej1202 @Lawrence @TheLastWord I am torn...I don't think he is "Deep State" and don't want to promote that slant on this, but then again....that is very funny.
@Lawrence @TheLastWord We NOW have our "Deep Throat".   We need a catchy code name!!!
@politico cause you won't be running.
@MSNBC I was in military for 20 years &amp; there were times (not many) when my Commander/ SNR Leadership didn't quite "get it". We worked very hard behind the scenes to make sure the mission got done, he/she did no damage, &amp; he/she did not embarrass themselves. Thats how this reads to me
@FoxNews @SenateMajLdr why?  because you know the people won't like what you say?  The time to talk about your policies are BEFORE the election.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump @realBobWoodward @POTUS If he does that, wouldn't Bob Woodward bring out his sources - which is not something I think Trump would want.
@realDonaldTrump Oh, I don't know. I am leaning toward just your narcissistic personality, contempt for (or ignorance o) the rules; and pure greed. But lets wait to see what Mueller finds out.
@Susan_Hennessey heeeeeey, thats not fair!  There was NO Garland hearing because the GOP blocked it for over a year.....oh wait.... I see what you did there. Very clever.
@JimGaffigan Well, if you mix dry grits with laundry detergent in the powder format it makes a great inexpensive dry hand cleaner.   Other than that.....I got nothing and I'm from the south.
@LindseyGrahamSC I agree with what he says, but he is leaving out the context of how the GOP refused to even have a hearing on Obama's candidate for over a year and waited till after the election to fill the spot.  How does that fit in with how he describes how non-partisan things should work?
@GeneralClark @Nike @Kaepernick7 The problem is it sends mixed messages based on the individual receiver. It triggers an emotional response based on the individual. I have no problem either because I get the intent but many do &amp; they are entitled to that opinion. So, why keep using a flawed communication method?
@XannyGibb @DonaldJTrumpJr @politico Obsessive? Your the one taking time to go through "a nobodies" time line.  And I don't get the birth cert reference.  But I agree with you.  I am obsessed with things going on right now - especially those who deliberately try and distort the facts for their own gain.
@XannyGibb @DonaldJTrumpJr @politico Nope.  But if it makes you feel that better that real people don't have an issue with Trump are out there - believe what you want
@GOP @tedcruz Misdirection. 1. We have no way of knowing  WHAT substantive points exist because you're not showing all documents. 2. Whatever their REAL motives are the demand for process integrity is real &amp; valid - and something I as a non-DEM expect to see. Don't corrupt the process again.

RT @politico: Opinion: The Kavanaugh nomination must be paused. And he must recuse himself. https://t.co/xDy8YGj7GU
@realDonaldTrump OMG.  You can't be serious. The majority of your tweets are filled with lies and character assassinations.  Are you so dense you don't see how illogical your own statements are? I put no value on unsubstantiated books, but your own statements and actions make you look nuts.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @politico Who cares about professionalism, stability, maturity, ethics, integrity, respect for others and our country, etc? And an exit by your dad does not mean an exit of a GOP in the white house or GOP led congress.  So, why would things change?  Same hands, different puppet.
@BillOReilly I believe probably most of whats in the book is true - but I agree that if there is no public proof or collaboration than whats the point?
@SenThomTillis Its not all about "experience" and HOW can they look at his record without seeing all of it?
@tribelaw @matthewamiller Do you really think it will get to impeachment?  I see any path to Trump goes through his son and son-in-law and I wonder if he would walk away in a deal to protect his family, and to avoid facts being throw out there.  if he walks, he can always say he was forced out
@khansen @costareports I agree totally.  But, there is no way you can convince people who support Trump any of this is true without it.
@costareports I bet 99% of his book is true but I really need to see collaboration and proof. Without that in today's climate - I will take nothing in his book as fact.  If I can't use his book as a trusted source to debate w/ Trump supporters (or even haters) - it has no value or validity.
@drvox Unfortunately, getting people to agree on what the real facts are is the problem. Most only get an interpretation of the facts by people they listen to &amp; follow on social media. Its hard to find shared truths when those we are judging based on facts are hiding the relevant facts.
@SenatorTimScott @GOP a fair and balanced jurists should have a fair and balanced nomination process.
I am very anti-trump, but I really hate these books which have all kinds of stuff that can't be proved easily - even when I believe 99% of what I hear.  It just adds to the noise surrounding all this &amp; unsubstantiated stories only make his followers think its all made up
Hey Congress, "Talk is cheap and Times awasting" !!
@SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP 1) And you have been praising him nonstop 2) thats all irrelevant - you are trying to circumvent the process (just like you did with Garland) &amp; THATS why I am mad. You care nothing  about integrity of the process. Its not DEMs you are HIDING documents from its the American People
I agree. No one denies documents from an important part of his career has been withheld &amp; those which have been selected are being selected by someone with "potential" bias. So, why is there even a debate on this? I mean I "know" why the GOP is trying to force this, but its wrong https://t.co/ih1197t84L
@GOP @ChuckGrassley So misleading. Its not the amount which is important - its the period of coverage &amp; when it was provided. This guy might support everything I believe in - but the way your handling this process, stopping documents from being reviewed, &amp; making excuses is very unethical.
@kasie @frankthorp @chuckschumer I would also say that the GOP is also trying to disrupt and obstruct the process by not providing proper documents and time to review them.

@Montavi95195309 @FoxNewsResearch Man - you are all over the place and just spouting shit. None of what you are saying has anything to do with what the topic is.  Your just  making assumptions about what I think and throwing out canned statements you heard because its easier than thinking.
I find it interesting  the right keeps stating that people who want trump gone want his polices gone. That not 100% true.  Many want the man gone and the way he manages the presidency (and this country gone), but not the core of his policies.  Is Pence a Democrat? Just curious.
@MattxRed now how about go look at that national debt graph fox put out last week.
@Learjetjockey @ChuckGrassley What anyone thinks about Obama is irreverent. What he did or didn't do is irrelevant.  Its not about comparisons and Obama's actions  do not justify trumps - its about what trump is doing now. But, people keep pointing to Obama when Trumps issues are brought up?  Why is that?
@FoxNews No-they want a demise of the lack of character &amp; an unethical behavior of the current president, &amp;removal of a "potential" criminal and traitor.  Are you saying Pence will totally abandon the policies &amp; objectives Trump pushes?  Why would we not get the same thing with pence?
@Learjetjockey @ChuckGrassley Two points.  1. I totally disagree with you on that about Obama because some of the stuff he did which angered people so much was he went outside the process due to the congress not working with him (regardless of why) and 2. Obama has nothing to do with this.
@ChuckGrassley Yeah, but when the congress does not execute that power as a separate entity and serves only to blindly support the personal agenda and self interests of the White house, special interest groups, and their own ambitions - not the american people.
@FoxNews @RepLeeZeldin Wrong. The scope had 3 things. 1) Russia election meddling. 2) Possible Trump involvement w/ the meddling, &amp; 3) any other crimes found investigating the other scopes.  So, where is this  beyond the scope? Go read the scope document for yourself.  Don't listen to false narratives.
@Montavi95195309 @FoxNewsResearch Look if you want to drink the kool-aid &amp; believe just what others tell you cause its easier - great - but if you look at the actions you don't have to rely on others. There is nothing that shows they acted on bias.  If they were, why wouldn't they have made the dossier public?
@MVZaGoGo @eddiemanion you know.....thats just mean....
@JuddLegum GOOD POINT.
@realDonaldTrump I find it amazing how you associate "dem" w/all thats evil in the world &amp; encourage others to think the same.

Is it just me, but do the fox news tweets and web site seem to have more negative trump points lately?  Not a lot, but more than I am use to seeing.
@Montavi95195309 @FoxNewsResearch Nope.  Your wrong.  The IG investigation said he has bias (which is just an opinion) - but there was no proof he acted on that bias. Plus other people reviewed his decisions.  Plus if he HAD wanted to hurt trump he had the means and did not use it. So, keep looking.....

@thehill then their idiots. I hate trump, but until the Mueller investigation or any other investigation is complete and can produce evidence of wrong doing than its a waste of time.  Stop stirring up the right and get them to rally around him until there is evidence.
Based on what we have seen from our congressional leaders &amp; media recently ANYONE who believes anything about Ohr without reading transcripts of today's meeting (which we can't) is an idiot. If you don't ask why they have closed sessions &amp; then talk about them your also an idiot

@GOP Okay.  Wait a minute.  Doesn't the senate have to have something to say about this? I am not commenting on the deal itself, but isn't there a process here that has to be followed?

@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump agree - there must never be even the perception of conflict of interests in our leaders.  this was beat into my head in the military. shame our President and members of congress don't have the same constraints
@GOP Well, thats cause GOP motivation is to rush an approval vote  - regardless of both your motivation - you both should be ashamed.  I as a citizen want full integrity in the process and the refusal not to share documents and the person doing the selection taints this process.
I sent a tweet which caused a lot of responses. I reread them and have to say there are so many people on both sides who refuse to listen to the other side in these debates.  Shouldn't that convince people  we ALL are being influenced and need to start opening our minds a bit?
@PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz There is no "one" GOV" oversight. Typically, basic security violations do not go to the FBI. Its done w/in each organization &amp; they all follow basic procedures. I will tell you Nuclear subs are one of the most classified areas so any infraction involving subs will be serious.
@PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz Every situation is different &amp; judged independently. Its not disparity - its balance where punishment fits the crime. Inadvertently saying something classified is a lot different than taking deliberately taking a camera into a secure space and taking pictures.
@SusanKristol @BillKristol Your a mean one, mr. trump.
@patrici59152026 @PamBaker3 @RepMattGaetz This is a common accident. Most likely someone sent data they didn't realize was classified. The investigation looks at what was sent, what the impact was, and the result can be a smack on the wrist or prison.  Some data is not even classified unless its linked to other data.
@patrici59152026 @PamBaker3 @RepMattGaetz Depends on who you listen to 😀? 1 thing i found was about 200 SNR GOV people put classified data into unclassified emails sent to her which means a) their unclass GOV systems also had classified on them &amp; 2) They screwed up as well.  So,a lot of others would have been in trouble
I got wrapped up in a line of texts with a lot of people involved and it just drives me crazy how people just immediately classify me as something I am not and insult me because of what I am say as a response.
@pedro2001171 @RepMattGaetz Nope.  Thats you buddy. I think for myself.
@pedro2001171 @RepMattGaetz Not liking trump, or not agreeing with trump - does not make you left or democrat or anything. You like to think that because it makes it easier to have an "us vs them" attitude. I have no problem with other views but no tolerance for people who share insults instead of views.

@GuinnBonnie @DavilaJames75 @RepMattGaetz I guess you don't remember the economic state of this country while he was in office and how we got there, and how we got out. Or the protections put in place to keep that happening again that Trump just cut.  Yeah, actions DO speak louder than words.
@GuinnBonnie @DavilaJames75 @RepMattGaetz This is distortion &amp;misdirection. 0 DEMS voted for a GOP tax bill done behind closed doors, which had an imbalance of tax cuts between citizens and corporations, and which added $1 Trillon dollars to the debt. It was the bill and how it was formed they refused to vote.
@GuinnBonnie @DavilaJames75 @RepMattGaetz So what?  This is not even about whether he should be given credit or not.  Its about whether or not  this economic greatness should be used to excuse him in other areas.  Every time I see someone criticize him a response will always include reference to the economy.
@deplorable_nany @andrea_svetly @rippinrn @RepMattGaetz That one issue I have with trump. He cut or weakened all these flawed regulations which were put in place for legitimate reasons.  He cut, he did not fix them. So, pollution, banking, healthcare, etc  protections are gone.  It helps companies, but not citizens. People dont see it
@GuinnBonnie @RepMattGaetz Obviously you don't either cause you just dismissed my comment w/ an insult. Go watch fox news &amp; then come back with an answer.  You must just think the president is doing a great job and is perfect because he got you a $50 raise w/ that tax bill that put us $1 Trillion in debt
@PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz Great! Don't forget to read the FBI email investigation, GPS Fusion Testimony 😀 I still have a different view than you , but thats okay.  At least we are researching and forming opinions that can be discussed rather than just spouting stuff we heard some talking head on tv say.
@America80582377 @LaurieWiese @RepMattGaetz I love how people who have no real clue of what American values and principles are hide behind that term "patriot".  You just wrongly continue to think I am w/  DEMs and the left so your brain won't hurt considering other opinions.
@pedro2001171 @RepMattGaetz I guess thats the danger of twitter - it brings out insulting assholes who just want to hear themselves talk.   There is nothing I can do to change your mind so I wont event try.  My point was some on the the RIGHT and obviously  you use that positive to ignore everything else.
@PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz As I said, I don't disagree.  None can be trusted. I see a difference in how they do it. At least my opinion, Fox tends to build a false story around picked facts. MSNBC trys to influence how we value news by just touching on some items &amp; others they repeat non-stop for emphasis.
@PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz Exactly. I have watched  testimony on TV &amp; watch FOX news, Trump, &amp; GOP leaders just twist it all around.  But I also have seen other media outlets do it as well. I still think FOX etc are more deliberate, but I can't deny the others do it as well. I trust none of them.
RT @politico: John McCain’s life was like something out of a Hollywood movie script — he was a naval officer and a jet pilot, a war hero an…
@patrici59152026 @PamBaker3 @RepMattGaetz And you don't think Fox news, trump, and every GOP tweet is propaganda?  my dislike for Trump, Fox news, and GOP in general is based because I know - repeat know - a lot of what they say is not only distortions of the truth, but in some cases out and out lies.
Thats what we are missing and badly need https://t.co/GcA4rLCjZX
any one who still buys the argument that Mueller should not be investigating all these things - just go read the short document which says what his scope is. 1) Russia Interference in our elections, 2) possible collusion of the Trump Campaign, and 3) any other crimes discovered.
Salute. Senator McCain. A Patriot. A Statesman. Didn't agree with all his policies, but a Patriot and a Statesman.  The Congress needs more men and women on his character whether GOP or DEMs.
@LuisRC44 @rippinrn @RepMattGaetz The economic state of this country is doing well, but even if you think he deserves all the credit (which i don't)  -  it should not be used as a distraction or excuse of justification for other things.  But, it seems many think the "end" justifies the "means".
@Susan_Hennessey I had a women today reply to a negative tweet of mine &amp; through an exchange of tweets I realized she was 100% trump because of religion. She felt Trump stood for Christian values &amp; Obama/Hilary supported Islamic persecution of Christians.  Her religious beliefs outweighed her sex
@gary_brezina @rippinrn @RepMattGaetz And NK now has tested nuclear weapons.  Hey,  he went over there talked - but I don't see how it made any substantive change in how things are or improved the situation positively.
@gary_brezina @RepMattGaetz Why do you think everyone against him is a liberal?  And the liberal/non-liberal issue only makes since if the debate was over his policies - but that is not where a lot of the unhappiness comes from.
@PamBaker3 @SOwl57 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz TOTALLY AGREE.  Doesn't matter which way you lean it is scary. When you start from an extreme position there is no room for compromise. And when extreme positions are what you have to stick with to get votes, donations, or $$$$ from special interests  how can anything get done?
@SOwl57 @PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz The word collusion may not be defined as a crime, but the things they are investigating which people have lumped under the term collusion is a crime. IF they did it.  And while I don't agree this is nonsense I do agree the DEM side has not done anything to help their cause.
FYI: The swamp is not the government institutions Trump attacks. It is congress, lobbyists, &amp; special interests who make sure running our country serves their interests. So many things could be worked out by people who aren't holding tight to extreme agendas for personal gain.
@ReeCee22 @ckriley67 @RepMattGaetz If your talking about the article about Islam treatment of Christians I saw no connection to Hilary or Obama.  if your talking about the other article about bribes I can't see the entire article.  So if you can send it to me where I can read it please do and I will read it.
@SOwl57 @ReeCee22 @ckriley67 @RepMattGaetz I don;t think so.  i think he is making it appear he is doing whats important.  he says all the right things, but when you pull the curtain back.....not much there.  Anyway - we will just have to agree to disagree.
@ReeCee22 @ckriley67 @RepMattGaetz I respect your decision and while I don't believe all that stuff about Obama and Hillary, I also voted for Trump because I am not a fan of Hilary for other reasons and was hoping he would be able to effect positive change. Thats NOT what I am seeing.
@ReeCee22 @RepMattGaetz Not sure your point. I don't necessarily agree with all of this, but I can understand if you accept this how it would make you feel.  Assuming its true, what does ANY of this have to do w/ Trump?  Maybe it was what pushed you to vote for him, but it has nothing with his actions.
@ReeCee22 @ckriley67 @RepMattGaetz Do I care?  Not that much.  Do I care he lied about it?  Yeah, a little. But you can't excuse the fact he did have affairs because he might have been extorted. Its not a big deal to me, but for people who claim to be so religious to over look is hypocritical to me.
@patrici59152026 @PamBaker3 @RepMattGaetz I am not sure your of your question.  Neither of us said we have seen evidence of collusion.  I am content just to wait till the investigation see if they find anything.
@CoryBooker I am sorry but I guess I have to stop following you because today someone said my opinion was irrelevant because I retweeted something you said.  I didn't realize we were suppose to choose sides in this &amp;ignore what the other side says.  It didn't use to be that way.
@Cookiemuffen @RepMattGaetz a) i am not a troll, b) I am no one important so why should I even have followers?   Is that how you judge people's opinions?  By who you "think" they affiliate with and how many followers they have.
@PamBaker3 @patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz I have seen no definitive collusion evidence either &amp; thats why I am waiting for the investigation to finish.  Do I want Trump gone, very much yes.  Do I want him impeached for any unsubstantiated set of crimes/actions, very much no.
@LaurieWiese @RepMattGaetz There is ignoring in-perfections &amp; not judging, &amp; there is ignoring actions &amp; choosing to pick that person as a leader.  Some "in-perfections" should not be ignored in that selection. Trump may say the right things, but his behavior is what counts. Hope your right about Gods plan
@rippinrn @RepMattGaetz NK has not been denuclearized &amp; is no closer to it now then we he was elected.  In fact, they achieved their goals while under his presidency - which I don't blame him for.  The rest are just campaign promises he is repeating with no real impact.
@LaurieWiese @RepMattGaetz I don't disagree, but I see no evidence Trump is that person.  I had hoped he would be, but not seeing it now.   Hmm...maybe its Mueller.  😀 Bottom line is i will continue to pick who i want to lead me by their character, actions, and behavior.  We will all see in the end.
@Deplorable_Lynx @RepMattGaetz @CoryBooker @POTUS thanks for proving my point that some Trump supporters have been brainwashed to discount anything anyone says who they can conveniently (and falsely) classify as some part of some group whose opinions don't count. THATS the problem.  You have been trained to ignore other opinions
@qtjudyg @RepMattGaetz at least your honest.
RT @RadioFreeTom: It’s a almost like experts on nuclear weapons and arms control were better judges of the North Korean situation than guys…
@MitziSzemeth @RepMattGaetz I think comparing their actions is like comparing apples &amp; oranges. Bad action is bad  regardless of charisma but I get your point. And Trump does have charisma just different than Obama's &amp; Hilary's (well, uh, no charisma there). People forgive those they like I guess.
@patrici59152026 @RepMattGaetz Yeah, thats nice.  You either have made up your mind that any impeachment would be for invalid reasons or you just don't care if there are valid reasons.  Both of those really show an understanding of American values.
@LaurieWiese @RepMattGaetz I am not a democrat, but I think we have a very different view of what is substance in this and what is appearance.
3/3  Just the fact there is such a polarizing set of opinions  should make everyone realize that maybe the media does have a hand in this and not take ANY media at face value, and do their own thinking and research.  But no, its easier to just pick aside and blindly follow it.
2/3 The result is in that world, there is only two opinions.  The "Trump is wonderful and can do no wrong" opinion, and any other opinion which is immediately discounted as being from an uncredible source. I am sure some on the left act the same way.
1/3 I have no problem w/ people disagreeing w/ me about Trump &amp; GOP, but I just can't get over how they choose to excuse things because they believe Trump's polices are working &amp; dismiss any negative said because they think opinions are influenced by the far left or Fake news.
@MitziSzemeth @RepMattGaetz Your right.  I am not judging him on his policies - neither negatively or positively. I am judging him on what he says, what he does, how he forms his polices, and how he implements those policies.
@MitziSzemeth @RepMattGaetz I guess I will stop this conversation because you seem to think my opinion is based just on what "fake news" media says.  The truth is i don't let anyone tell me what to think.  I believe Fox news and MSM are both biased even though they present that bias differently.
@MitziSzemeth @RepMattGaetz No he isn't relevant. Even if I ignored things Obama did, that does not make criticism of trump wrong. Even if I had a double standard, it has no bearing on whether Trumps actions are right our wrong. Any argument justifying Trumps actions based on actions of others is illogical
@MitziSzemeth @RepMattGaetz I don't care about what Obama did or didn't do.  Not relevant. While I agree with your subjective statement &amp; patiently wait for the conclusion of all investigations, I don't agree he has been transparent and done nothing wrong concerning the running of our country.
@TheOnion Okay, I get its a joke, but I would PAY to watch that movie.
@MitziSzemeth @RepMattGaetz And this is what gets me - how people ignore things just because policies allegedly are working?  So we are now a country where the "ends justify the means" and we use it to excuse things?  What has always made America different has been the "means" we governed ourselves.
@RepMattGaetz The GOP keeps holding up the economy which by many accounts is doing well regardless if this due to Trump or not. My question is SO WHAT? What does the economy have to do with how Trump has, &amp; currently, is conducting himself? Do we ignore his behavior cause the economy is good?
@GOP Whats the percentage of people who want a nomination process which is above reproach and has not stink of bias or impropriety?
The GOP's refusal implement processes of government fairly shows me all they care about is their own special interests.
@realDonaldTrump The fact that your response to things said against you is always - its fake news- rather than provide any real FACTs to the contrary is what makes people against you. Always claiming fake news &amp; throwing out easily seen lies and distortions of the truth is what your problem is.,
@Jim_Jordan Why do you insist on misrepresenting the facts?
@GOP @kayleighmcenany The democrats &amp;  non-democrats are NOT against the American citizens. They are against a) certain things in your policy, b) the way you formed your policy, &amp; c) the way you implemented your policy. You just make it sound like they are because its easier than saying the truth.
@GOP I will stand w/him if &amp; when we have full release of his documents &amp; there is nothing in there objectionable. I will not stand for anyone unless the process has been implemented fairly &amp;  without even the possibility of bias.
@JimGaffigan Just thinking about "You" eating a salad makes me sadder.   Hmmm...salad, in a hot pocket, with bacon???  Maybe????
Whats the odds of a Redskins trade of Brian Quick to New England?  #HTTR
@MSNBC Again, I'm not going to get into the back-and -forth details...which show just how illogical and stupid the things I have to say are.
@DonaldJTrumpJr What BS?  That russians hacked into their systems during the election?  Are you seriously still denying that happened?
@BillOReilly I think your wrong - its not about provable crimes.  Its about verifiable conduct, actions, and statements which erode any confidence or trust people have in him, and shows he is unfit to run this country.
@GOP so misleading &amp; distorting the truth.  they did not vote for a tax bill completed in secret by GOP, imbalance tax breaks for the rich, failure to account for needed Gov revenue while increasing the debt $1 Trillion. this was not a tax plan - it was a pay out to special interests
@BillOReilly It is not a betrayal.  It is not breaking attorney client privilege. The relationship was not typical "Lawyer - Client" relationship.  They worked together in a conspiracy to commit a crime.  That is basically what he plead guilty to....
RT @CoryBooker: Trump's personal lawyer has sworn under oath that POTUS directed him to commit a federal crime.		The Senate must reject any…
@marklevinshow So...does that make what he said untrue?
@SteveScalise Well, maybe if you stopped sacrificing the things everyone can agree on by trying to use them as leverage to get some non-starters through we could make some progress.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump More rolling back of regulations without addressing the problem they were put in place for.  If you cared about anything other than $$$ and special interests you would fix these regulations and not just get rid of them.
@mike55michigan @marklevinshow And another thing - what trump (and others) is doing is not FIXING any divide.  Its just shifting influence from one side to the other.  The divide is still there and being expanded based on false narrative being pushed out there for political reasons.
@mike55michigan @marklevinshow So? What others have done is no excuse for what is being done today by others. Trying to make it seem that far left wacko liberals are the only ones who disagree w/ trump is an untrue statement. Its just false &amp; many issues have nothing to do w/ a left or right policy conflict
@marklevinshow Why do you try so hard to make it seem people who disagree w/Trump are leftists? Is it because if you can make his supporters think there are only two sides to this it will be easy to discredit what people say by linking this to liberals?  Why try so hard to divide and discredit?
@CNN and by "People" they mean the unethical cowardly GOPers who promote the false narrative being pushed by Trump (or worse..remain silent) just so they can keep their seats and satisfy their own personal agendas and the agendas of their backing special interest groups
@GolicAndWingo @MGolicJR57 Why no Doughnut write in?
@chelseaperetti sssshhhh....don't let out the secret.  next you will tell people you deliberately give them portions you know they can't eat just so you get extra food without looking like a pig.  Sometimes I ate more over the sink pretending to do the dishes.
@senrobportman And I look forward to full and open disclosure of all his documentation
@SteveScalise Bullshit. You cut regulations burdensome to companies making $$$ but put NOTHING in place to continue the protections they gave us. They were put there for reason &amp; instead of fixing their flaws you just cut them  - health care, pollution, banking - your roll back is a set back
@chelseaperetti I do, but I am nobody
