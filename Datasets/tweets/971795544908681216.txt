@mtnance @will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver Not at all.  The organic power of a state legislature to pass legislation, whether it is a bill that is enacted into a statute or a resolution proposing an amendment to the voters, is the same.  Plaintiffs here try to pick and choose among those powers on an ad hoc basis.
RT @josh_lawson: Today in 1945. üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/ecABPZ1Wfa
@mtnance @will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver Not sure what "standard" you are talking about.  There is no recognized or justiciable basis for saying a body can pass statutes, but not constitutional amendments, due to defects in the manner it was elected. I get that you might want there to be one, but it's just not so.
@mtnance @will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver If the amendments are void for lack of "democratic legitimacy" in getting to the voters, then so should be every action of the same body. You have to pick one or the other. Until Friday, no court had deprived a body (post hoc no less) of its full legislative powers. Law matters.
RT @DarrenForChair: #TakeBackWake	#ncpol	#ncga https://t.co/wVK62Cr28s
@mtnance @BoBromhal @will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver The concept of time limits to act is hardly unfamiliar in the law.
@mtnance @will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver Like an amendment actually gets ratified by the voters (here, &gt; 2 million of them)?  No voter gets to weigh in directly on a statute. Also, odd how a body can "represent the people" for some purposes but not others. And, by "odd" I mean "not recognized by any existing precedent."
@longleafpol Indeed.  I think under the logic of that ruling we're back to being a British colony again -- our leader now: https://t.co/oVAeKN7nxM
@BoBromhal @will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver That's a very valid point.
@McDowellConserv @Telemachus111 I think I may not be understanding your question.  It is hardly unusual for a court to strike down legislative districts.  The legislature (or the court) draws new maps, but no one ever said (until this ruling) the legislature can't pass laws until new elections are held.
@Telemachus111 Things are only unconstitutional when they hurt Democrats, not Republicans.
@Telemachus111 What the Democrats apparently thought was "fair" in 1992 when they ran things.
@McDowellConserv @Telemachus111 Yes -- many times.

@APDillon_ @zanbunn As Drew Carey would say: "Welcome to North Carolina, where over 2 million votes to amend the state constitution don't matter."
@APDillon_ @zanbunn I especially like how the left is trying to draw a distinction between constitutional amendments and just "necessary" legislation, with the latter somehow being okay. Since more than 2 million voters supported the amendments, that should make then MORE immune from attack!
@cemeterygunblob @evansiegfried Perhaps.  When I was a child, my mother taught me to respect my elders (whoever they were) and to not interrupt another person when talking.  She'd be mortified if I did this -- either as a child or an adult.
@SunGod_1 @Barnes_Law Conservatives won elections and then went to work on reformist legislation.  The Left, however, began a highly coordinated effort of protests, slander, and of course suing ("Sue Til Blue").  NC is basically run by the 4th Circuit and now the state judiciary.
@Barnes_Law Technically, the judge is elected.  Your point still stands, though.  It's a decision that is truly without precedent anywhere so far as I can tell.
@WhalerCane @longleafpol You are changing the principle of law you first articulated.  So far as I can tell, no legislature has ever been held to lack its full powers following a finding that its districts are unconstitutional.  That is in fact stated in the one case on this point cited in the order.
@WhalerCane @longleafpol That's not exactly true. There have been many cases of legislatures being redistricted by court order, including the North Carolina legislature going all the way back to the early 2000s when the Democrats were in charge.
RT @jdanbishop: Still raining. Friend suggests:  change state flower to mildew.
@WhalerCane @longleafpol Any such case law certainly didn't find its way into the Court's order, and I am personally aware of no such precedent.
@WhalerCane @longleafpol Can you give me a citation to a case that articulates that principle of law?
@BrentWoodcox And, of course, lost in all this is the fact that the plaintiffs' arguments for standing (at least as recited in the order) are hardly overwhelming.
@BrentWoodcox They really should be ashamed.  Millions of votes by individuals who took the time to participate in the process of voting were just thrown out in a decision so radical it can cite no precedent for taking such a drastic step.
@HarnettGOP And I don't say that as some flippant point.  A legislative body is vested with the power to govern when it is in office -- that is, with all of its legislative powers.  You can't pick and choose.
@HarnettGOP These judges sure do cash their pay checks from appropriations made by the "illegally constituted General Assembly," though, don't they?
@RedState The exchange with the 16 year old is priceless!

@longleafpol It is very telling that he hastens to add that it's "too soon to gauge its prospects on appeal."
@will_doran @AndyNilssonNC @newsobserver That's a distinction without a difference. In fact, constitutional amendments should have more legitimacy because any potential "taint" from the legislature is removed when the voters cast their ballots for or against.
@TimBoyumTV Yes.
@The_EJWilder We've reached peak "what-I don't-like-is-unconstitutional."
@JudgeJackson @MLB_UNC So I guess in representing my clients now I get to argue that what's written in the General Statutes isn't actually the law unless the legislature that passed it was elected from districts that would be found satisfactory by a panel of federal judges.
@JudgeJackson @MLB_UNC I feel like each day the people of this state get closer and closer to having a case against the judiciary under the Guarantee Clause.

@kevinjohnrogers @Telemachus111 The "free money" assertion is not a straw man -- the author of the article raises it: "While it is unlikely that Medicaid expansion in North Carolina will turn out to be entirely free . . . ." And, as @Telemachus111 notes, the author ignores the increase in the federal debt.
@Telemachus111 Exactly. Proponents fail to account for how much that "little" change is. I would also expect the feds to take the position that a state could never withdraw from the Medicaid expansion, even if the State wanted to, thus creating a huge infringement on state sovereignty.
@Telemachus111 It seems to me expansion also overlooks the possibility that once a state starts accepting funds, it may never be able to withdraw in the future. Even if the political will for exiting existed, look for the federal government to treat participation like a unbreakable contract.
