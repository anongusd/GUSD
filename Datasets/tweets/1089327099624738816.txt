It is our job to take care of widows and orphans, not single mothers who are having kids out of wedlock. Common sense policies! We must focus on giving widows and orphans and prayer for the latter.

This is blatantly ridiculous due to the fact of how dynamic and broad the responsibilities of a representative. We need to treat elections like a job interview and we are the CEO. It can not matter how likable one is but how technically qualified is the candidate. #dnc #rnc @AOC
If we are going to use group analysis when electing a representatives there should be more Asian and Jewish males. They are the top two groups in this country for IQ and income. Whites come in dead middle, so they should be the third choice. Blacks would be last due to low scores

@BasedSyrian Ok I'll give you that it worked for a short time. The economy is just too large for one small group of people to manage it on a long time line. It's unconstitutional and creates a dictator. Looking at the outcomes of dictatorships I wouldn't suggest that as a solution.

In order to prevent chaos one must have a long memory and also be highly adaptive to the present. With the increased rate at cultural change it is imperative to react quickly yet wisely. Technology makes the restriction of liberty easy and expedient if left unchecked.
When the Black Panthers were operating in the 60s-80s they had very legitimate grievances and in the very beginning were using their constitutional rights to self defense against tyranny. The legislators and public relinquished liberty in order to oppress. Hate oppresses ALL!
