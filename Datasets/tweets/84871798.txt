@politvidchannel I personally kept my sanity by filtering his assault on my eyes and ears via @ddale8
@HowardSchultz You mean from what you saw to what "reports" (unsubstantiated) you "heard" here you are ready to judge, divide and tear down.
Thank you @ddale8 for your willingness to psychologically take a bullet for all of us. I would  100% rather read your interpretations of the blather that emits from Twitler's mouth than to deal with my PTSD that ensues from hearing him firsthand. #ThankYOU
@tonyschwartz AGREED.
@EricLiptonNYT If you watch his speech that night, when the first reporter asked about whether or not it was because NK wanted sanctions lifted, you can LITERALLY see Trump light up and run with that. It is clear that it was bs made up at that MOMENT. Please watch it.
@jahimes And he does NOT have the right to lie to the American people about it.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump 1. Don't elevate him on the world stage. How is that using the leverage of the power of the United States and our allies?	2. Read and study the nuances.	3. Don't kiss his ass in public. He is a murderous dictator. 	4. Take the time to create a strategy, not a photo op.
@agnosticpsycho1 @CBSNews Wrong. They came here seeking asylum, which is LEGAL.
@Brunhildagis @atrupar I'm sure his school records are sealed, too.
@TheRickWilson @janrobinjackson Except when it comes to aligning us with dictators, allowing blatant human rights abuses, locking up babies, playing games with hostile nuclear powers, etc., etc.

If the tax refunds are late the GOP will lose supporters from their base, who vote based only on what affects them. The GOP are getting to pick and choose who they deem priority (farm subsidies, tax-refunds, trump businesses) based on their personal agendas.

I find myself listening to Twitler's speeches with to monitor for any new random and poorly thought-out policies which will deprive even more people of their civil rights, while at the same time in my head I'm yelling SHUT THE FUCK UPPPPPPPP after every idiotic thing he says.
@george_capen The same way he used young girls, including his daughters, to show "character" during his supposedly grown-up confirmation hearings. Creepy af.
@emrazz I'm just hoping he's ready to put Twitler in deep check by out-distracting the attention back to the Kavanaugh confirmation mess where it belongs. Trump, with his scheduled meeting with Rosenstein, is trying to draw attention away. Check and mate.
