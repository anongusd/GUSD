As much as I’ve urged people with principles to flee, this [Mattis resignation] is also the moment I’ve been fearing from the start. Mattis had seemed determined not to leave, to provide some kind of firewall of protection to the USA from Trump’s worst impulses. That will soon

This belief is fundamental Jewish value, but it is also--or has been--an American value, that this country can be a haven for refugees seeking a better life.  Trump rejects this value and instead stokes fear of the stranger. My heart breaks for the dead, and for our country.

I didn't get a presidential text.  Should I be worried? Am I being excluded?
@thisisinsider Aq
Should the president’s repulsive attack on Ford last night count against Kavanaugh with wavering senators? Are the sins of the POTUS visited on his nominee? I’m not sure they should be, but interested in hearing alternate views
“Falsely accused men” is Trump’s new massive voter fraud.

Oh my.  I don't know if I've ever heard a more powerful piece of testimony: "Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter, the uproarious laughter between the two...they were laughing with each other...I was underneath one of them while the two laughed."
Really unfortunate that the factual development is being truncated and interrupted by the five-minute rule; not helpful for senators trying to get to the truth or the public seeking to understand
And likeable -- a kind of winsome sense of humor and an eagerness to please.  S
A very fine start from Amy Mitchell, acknowledging that she looks terrified and how unfortunate that is
And every coffee addict in the world (me included) identifies with her

To be clear: saying "wouldn't" would have been better than saying "would." But: 1) logically, that construction makes no sense in terms of the development of his argument 2) even if you grant that he meant to say "wouldn't," that is completely inadequate to the point at issue. ..

What is the impact &amp; message of your continued presence? Are you mitigating Trump’s excesses, or enabling/covering for them? Jon Huntsman? Gina Haspell? Dan Coats? Gulp, James Mattis? How explain your continued service, to yourself now or down the road, to your children?
Think about it. You are a Republican who loves your country. Or you are a foreign policy or intelligence professional. What do you do in the face of Trump’s craven capitulation to an adversary. It is a hard choice but one that Trump is making easier/forcing, every day.
I know this sounds extreme. It doesn’t feel like my usual approach to things. But extreme times, extreme measures. Maybe mass resignations of the (alleged) grownups would rouse a supine Congress, alarm even some Trump voters

It's on your newscasts all night, all week and it never ends.  Trump on police shootings.  I thought he was talking about himself.
Has Christie mentioned that he's a former US Attorney?  I can't remember.
Trump: I'd bring back a helluva lot worse than water-boarding.  Such as?
Oh, that's a relief.  Cruz says he wouldn't engage in widespread use of waterboarding.

I think Eminent Domain would be an excellent band name.
Trump. Will replace Obamacare with something SO MUCH BETTER.  Isn't it time for something more specific?

Christie said he was going to plow my snow if elected.  That is great.  Kenhowe Drive, please.
Christie: That's what Wash DC does...the drive-by shot at the beginning &amp; the memorized 20-second speech.
Christie on Rubio:  The people of New Hampshire are smart.  Do not make the same mistake again.
Christie to Rubio: You have not been involved in a consequential decision...That's not leadership, that's truancy.  Ooomph!
Carson calls out Cruz on the timeline.  Make your own judgment, he says.

For all the discussion about shouting and sexism, Clinton is very soft-spoken today, almost whispering at times.  Effective.
A woman's right to make her health care decisions--that is not about Wall Street.
Clinton: There are more kinds of inequality than just those that are furthered by greedy financial interests.  cites racism, sexism, LGBT
Clinton: "Service is the rent we pay for living in our country." A lovely line, actually.

HRC: Sanders is engaging in an "artful smear."
Clinton: Sanders only one who would describe "a woman running to be the first woman president as exemplifying the establishment" Come on!
Clinton talks about "accusation" and "attack." Calling her a moderate isn't exactly that.  #DemDebate
These candidates are sounding tired and repetitive.  Understandable.
Is POTUS a progressive? Sanders doesn't answer question for a while, then says, yeah, I do.  Then what's difference w/ Clinton? #DemDebate

Trump didn't beat Walker.  Fiorina didn't beat Walker.  Walker beat Walker by underperforming, underwhelming. Cf. @marcorubio
#ScottWalker Few mos ago top R was telling me Walker best primary cand, #marcorubio best gen elect cand,#JebBush best POTUS.  Times change

Biggest winner: Fiorina. Biggest loser: Carson. She seized the moment. He snoozed through it.
RT @TonyFratto: So Trump tried to make up for his remark about Fiorina's looks with another remark about Fiorina's looks.
Trump on Fiorina, she's a beautiful woman. Digging hole much? Clueless. Totally clueless. #CNNDebate
#CNNDebate Carly Fiorina, not low energy. Ben Carson, zero energy.
I thought Ben Carson was number two. Is he napping? #CNNDebate
RT @ThePlumLineGS: Uh oh. Kasich telling truth about our allies and his rivals' rip-on-Iran-deal-on-day-one nonsense.
#cnndebate Is it just me or does Ben Carson always sound like he's high?
#CNNDebate @JohnKasich plays the grownup card. Good luck with that.

RT @Avik: It was a mistake for #CNNDebate to have 11 candidates in one debate and 4 in the next. Should have been 7 &amp; 8.
#CNNDebate Lindsey Graham right about one thing: the Supreme Court at stake in 2016.
@ThirdWayKessler yes. Nerding while Muslim. Not good.
Oh. Good point.
#cnndebate seriously none of these candidates can condemn treatment of Texas student handcuffed for building a clock?
@dbongino I've responded to your ignorant insults with facts and more attention than you deserve.  We're done.
@dbongino BTW tax revenue DECREASED in 2001 02, 03 (biggest GWB tax cut was 01) Revenue dropped 13 percent during 2 Bush terms. Enuf facts?
@dbongino 2/2 Real GDP growth after Clinton tax increases: 1994 4.13%, 1995 2.28%, 1996 4.45%, 1997 4.39 percent.  Hello, business cycle?
@dbongino @washingtonpost 1/2 Ok, some facts.  Real GDP growth after Bush tax cuts 2002 2.04%; 2003 4.36%; 2004 3.12%. 2005 3.03%.
@dbongino @washingtonpost  bush's own best case scenario analysis shows a 1 trillion plus revenue loss. Argue with him.
@dbongino @washingtonpost  tax cuts don't pay for themselves in terms of economic growth. Bush doesn't claim they do. End of story.
