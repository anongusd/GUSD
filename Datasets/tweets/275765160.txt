From to time, Twain's 'Adventure's of Huckleberry Finn' gets banned, which is dumb, because not only is it America's greatest novel, it's a fierce attack on both slavery (now abolished) and post Civil War racism. 		And as an American, you should be smart enough to know this.
This is Mark Twain in 1874 in New York, but during the Reconstruction era, which was a total failure. 		But Twain's 'A True Story', put him on the map, and with The Atlantic, "helped chart a new direction in American literature."
“Oh, no, Misto C , I hain’t had no trouble. An’ no joy!” https://t.co/J1NsY1gAQn
"My marster was a Confedrit colonel, an’ I was his family’s cook. So when de Unions took dat town, dey all run away an’ lef’ me all by myse’f in dat big house. So de big Union officers move in dah, an’ dey ask would I cook for dem. ‘Lord bless you,’ says I, ‘dat’s what I’s for."
"An’ dey sole my ole man, an’ took him away, an’ dey begin to sell my chil’en an’ take dem away, an’ I begin to cry; an’ de man say, ‘Shet up yo’ dam blubberin’,’ an’ hit me on de mouf wid his han’."
“Dey put chains on us an’ put us on a stan’ as high as dis po’ch,—twenty foot high,—an’ all de people stood aroun’, crowds an’ crowds. Dey’d come up dah an’ look at us all roun’, an’ squeeze our arm, an’ make us git up an’ walk, an’ den say, ‘Dis one too ole,’ or ‘Dis one lame,’
Aunt Rachel: 		"Well, sah, my ole man—dat’s my husban’—he was lovin’ an’ kind to me, jist as kind as you is to yo’ own wife. An’ we had chil’en—seven chil’en—an’ we loved dem chil’en jist de same as you loves yo’ chil’en. Dey was black, but de Lord can’t make no chil’en so black"
Aunt Rachel (Mary Ann Cord): 		“Has I had any trouble? Misto C , I’s gwyne to tell you, den I leave it to you. I was bawn down ’mongst de slaves; I knows all ’bout slavery, ’case I ben one of ’em my own se’f."
"She stopped quaking. She paused, and there was a moment of silence. She turned her face over her shoulder toward me, and said, without even a smile in her voice:—		Misto C , is you in ’arnest?		It surprised me a good deal; and it sobered my manner and my speech, too"
Twain: "At such a moment as this a thought occurred to me, and I said:		Aunt Rachel, how is it that you ’ve lived sixty years and never had any trouble?”
"That is to say, she was being chaffed without mercy, and was enjoying it. She would let off peal after peal of laughter, and then sit with her face in her hands and shake with throes of enjoyment which she could no longer get breath enough to express." https://t.co/J1NsY1gAQn
"She was of mighty frame and stature; she was sixty years old, but her eye was undimmed and her strength unabated. She was a cheerful, hearty soul, and it was no more trouble for her to laugh than it is for a bird to sing." https://t.co/J1NsY1gAQn
"IT WAS SUMMER TIME, and twilight. We were sitting on the porch of the farm-house, on the summit of the hill, and “Aunt Rachel” was sitting respectfully below our level, on the steps,—for she was our servant, and colored." https://t.co/J1NsY1gAQn
Mark Twain spent many Summers on Quarry Farm in Elmira, NY writing his greatest books. 		This is where he met Mary Ann Cord.		Slavery had been abolished in USA for nine years by the time Mark Twain's 'A True Story' was published.		This is how and where Twain's carreer took off. https://t.co/ilX5i7Jz79
The Atlantic Monthly first published Twain's 'A True Story, Repeated Word for Word As I Heard It' in 1874, which is Mary Ann Cord's story.		Twain's use of 'negro dialect' in 'A True Story, Word for Word as I Heard It' (1874) is difficult to read, brutal at times, and eye-opening.
You may prefer African American, but I prefer black folks. 		And no one really says negro anymore. But for post Civil War history, it's what's called for, to make the point.
How far has the black race come in America since 1865?		Extraordinarily far.  		But let's go back to Mark Twain, who was a great fighter for civil rights, using his writing skills, and he used (at the time) Negro dialect. 		Your job is to not take that personally. It's history.
And yes, all races are proud of their heritage. 		White folks.		Black folks.		Hispanic folks.		Asian folks.		Arab folks.		It's human nature to be proud of your race, and where you came from. 		America is the land where all races get to be truly free, but within 'Americanism'.
Part of the struggles of race relations in the 2010 to 2019 era, or 'Twitterworld', is for the first time in human history, everyone is at the same table.		And it's painful at times. I know. And at times, its helpful to give some reassurance too.		We've all come a long way.
Many of us 100% agree with John Wayne:		"What good would it do to register anybody in a class of higher algebra or calculus if they haven't learned to count? There has to be a standard. I don't feel guilty about the fact that five or 10 generations ago these people were slaves"
John Wayne was just being honest. He said, in Playboy:		"With a lot of blacks, there's quite a bit of resentment along with their dissent, and possibly rightfully so. But we can't all of a sudden get down on our knees and turn everything over to the leadership of the blacks."
Now if black folks want to take what they've learned from hundreds of years of white people's Western Civilization, and go civilize most of Africa, have at it. 		But this isn't Wakanda. This is America, and everyone's job is to assimilate to Americanism.
Black folks brought here from 1600s on deeply struggled in slavery, but survived. Would take 100 more years to get full freedom. 		Black folks (and POC) in America are free, because white people fought for your freedom.		And you are far better off here than Africa, or elsewhere.
As a people, white folks come from a proud heritage, with a glorious history. We have accomplished amazing things. 		We founded a free nation, fought a civil war to end slavery; passed onto us from Britain. Liberated Europe (2x), and landed on the moon. 		What have you done?
What's often lacking in our ridiculous debates are two things:		1. What happened decades/centuries ago, was a different time. Leave the dead alone. 		2. Humans (any race) need time to develop, and white people (just being honest) had a major headstart, by thousands of years.
In 1971, in his (now) controversial Playboy interview, Wayne stated he didn't feel Americans should let American leadership be turned over to a race of people who are not responsible. 		Falsely accusing MAGA of a modern day lynching is a perfect example or irresponsible behavior.
John Wayne wasn't racist. He was a man's man, who valued freedom, and felt people shouldn't be a freeloaders. 		Wayne was born in 1907 when the American frontier was transitioning to an industrial empire.		Wayne was married 3x, to three Latino women.
John Wayne never committed a hate crime that I know of, like this gay, black actor just did.		John Wayne was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, and Presidential Medal of Freedom and did more for America's image in the 20th Century than you can imagine.
63 million Americans voted for Donald Trump in 2016, and many of these people respect and love John Wayne. 		Over the last few weeks, a national hate crime driven by a gay black man sent vitriol to millions of MAGA.		No apology given by anyone who enabled this crime. https://t.co/el029O7o6P
"John Wayne personified for millions the nation's frontier heritage. Eighty-three of his movies were Westerns. Ultimately, his frontier heroes are the force that make order and civilization possible" -Ronald L. Davis
"Republic. I like the sound of the word. It means people can live free, talk free, go or come, buy or sell, be drunk or sober, however they choose. Some words give you a feeling. Republic is one of those words that makes me tight in the throat" -John Wayne https://t.co/RlntMhS0PY
As long as our elected officials are swearing an oath to protect the U.S. Constitution, you are protecting 200+ years self-government, and self-dependence. 		The right of Americans to determine their own destiny, and live out their own lives as they see fit.

So its been a rough 48 hours on Twitter as disturbing story after story has come out on child pedophilia. The timing has been a perfect storm.		And you got a few of us on Twitter (where the world spins) who are going to hit very hard. Brutally hard.		And because no one else will.

Your reality check of the day is, while I rarely drive conspiracy thinking, in elite Twitter circles (where the world spins), the 'Epstein brokered abuse of power deal' conspiracy has been a long running theory, and a lot of people strongly wonder if that's what happened.
At this point, got two options:		1. Conspiracy! Was an abuse of power deal brokered to protect beltway and media elites, and Epstein got a super light sentence.		2. Team Acosta legitmately struggled to take down Epstein, but could only deliver the best justice they could.
Again. Attorney Jeffrey H. Sloman, who worked with Alex Acosta writes:		"Our team worked diligently to build a federal case against Epstein. As we continued, however, it became clear that most of Epstein’s victims were terrified to cooperate against him." https://t.co/98WiYykggd

But again, whether you are a millionaire, billionaire, or gazillionaire, that's your money you earned, and you are paying your fair share when you create jobs for Americans.

It's never unreasonable to uphold key 19th and 20th American ideals that made us a great nation, led by great white men who did more for women's rights and civil rights then you ever will.
The big problems are 'envy', ignorance, and dark souls. 		Envy that white people (who dominate in population #'s, history, culture) has an earned so called privilege the minority doesn't.		You are too ignorant to understand America, and your souls are corrupted.
If you knew your American history, you know women were winning freedoms in the mid 19th century, and by the 1920s, women were free to vote. 		Hollywood was glorifying women in the 1930s and 1940s, and women were breaking into the workforce into WWll. 		Women are free in America!
Aside from health care, the whole point of today's Dem fringe platform is to hysterically overhype issues that aren't really issues.		- Race	- Guns	- Climate	- Equality	- Women's Rights		A bunch of babies who couldn't survive one hour on America's 19th century frontier.

It takes a village to blow a 25,000 job opportunity.		It takes a white American President to build a financial and military empire.		It takes the intelligence of early white settlers passed down through the generations to be able to grasp job creation, tax revenue and incentives.
You don't get to run to be President and think you'll bring America to a new level of greatness we haven't seen in the last 200+ years. 		We have way too many amazing success stories from American Presidents born into adversity, highly educated, who rose up to do great things.
Financially Illiterate idiots who rob their own neighborhoods of jobs and opportunity tend to dwell in inner city ghettos and third world nations.		This Presidents Day we look at the exact opposite of idiocy.		White males who led the United States of America to greatness. 		Fact!
Fact!		44 of the men we will honor this Presidents Day were white.		Why? Duh. Because America is a mostly white nation with a mostly white history and culture.		This is a good thing.

Feb 7 OAC Launch Doc on NPR		"Nearly every major Democratic Presidential contender say they back the Green New deal including: Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Jeff Merkeley, Julian Castro, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, and Jay Inslee."
In just 1 week OAC (AOC) has:		- Killed 25,000 jobs for her inner city ghetto		- Called for eliminating air travel and cows
I fully expect on the national 2020 debate stage, Trump is going make idiots out of all contenders pushing climate, in front of tens of millions.		After they've already made idiots out of themselves.
If an issue is not an election issue, there is no real demand from the consumer, aka electorate. 		In coming years, the courts are most likely not going to let a rogue President get away with declaring a national emergency on guns or climate, when there isn't one.		Not a concern.
The act of declaring a national emergency is itself a gamble. 		Yes, the courts may block it temporarily, setting up a big battle and victory, or loss.		No risk, no gain.  		And immigration IS an election issue. A top 3 election issue heading into 2020.
I want Trump as President. He's the best President since Reagan.		Not happy about the funding bill. Not sure why he would want to sign it.  		But so much of the stuff Trump accomplishes far outweighs a bad spending bill.
If Trump and the GOP House make the right moves, and focus on what Americans want, both should be in good position by 2021. 		Other than health care, Dems are obsessed with issues Americans don't want, and issues that don't win elections.
Two things I am growing more confident of:		- OAC won't be in Congress that long		- Trump becoming more likely to win re-election
OAC is the joker type. 		She is not here to do anything but damage most everything she touches. 		Burn it all down! https://t.co/a8v4WHCRwp
Why do you think Cuomo is so upset? He knows this move could well scare off future big investment opportunities in NYC.		There are no Amazon competitors that can scale like this, anywhere. 		This clown show may end up hurting New York metro for decades to come.
25,000 jobs that could have given OAC's district a big push.		But her ego made it about the billionaire who creates the jobs. 		This job opportunity will most likely not be coming back around. And it likely scares off future job creation investors in inner city NYC

Presidents who Have Declared # of National Emergencies:		- Bush43: 11	- Obama: 10	- Clinton: 6	- Trump: 3
Climate and guns are not election issues. 		If future Presidents want to do national emergencies out of spite, climate and guns are issues that would very likely get defeated in courts quickly.
We can't have large caravans from third world nations continually cross our border and take our jobs, overwhelm resources, spread disease, bring crime, and contribute to electoral fraud.		Trump's base is not happy he will sign the funding bill, but that's life.
Trump declaring a national emergency on immigration (an unsecured border), which is a big election issue is fine. 		Climate and guns are not election issues. 		If future Presidents want to do national emergencies, these are issues that would very likely get defeated in courts.
Cuomo is pissed! 		Amazon pulling out of NYC, is one of the dumbest things, ever. 		NYC's loss is someone else's gain.
What competitors?		Mayor de Blasio "added that if Amazon couldn't recognize New York City's value, "its competitors will." https://t.co/Ho59AzrxsD

Between infanticide and farting cows we're seeing a case that 'could' be made that the fringe left has a murderous, genocidal appetite for any living thing that gets in their way. 		So, wouldn't mind if we backed off the fantasy of exterminating a billion cows to save the planet.
I want a debate on food/diet in an era where healthcare doesn't really do a good job at preventative medicine, but not a kooky debate.		Not only do many humans simply need animal foods to function well, but hunting is a significant part of the human culture.
Aside from thousands of years of human evolution hunting and cooking animals to survive, if you look at ancient Chinese medicine, animal foods are used for medicinal purposes, and deep healing, depending on the condition.
From 30 years ago I'm still a believer that for best health, and a slim waistline, the optimal way to eat is ultimately:		- Whole Grains	- Vegetables	- Legumes	- Nuts/Seeds	- Less to No Sugar	- Less to No Butter	- Less to No Soda	- Less to No White breads	- Some Animal Food
'The Standard American Diet'		- Meat	- Poultry	- Eggs	- Butter	- Dairy	- Sugar	- Soda	- White Bread
Honestly, in the late 1980s, I had some of the same sustainable revolution thoughts Booker is being quoted on.		Back in the days when no one spoke of Climate hysteria, but the coming ice age was going to destroy our planet.
Back in the 1970s and 1980s, 'The Macrobiotic Diet' was a movement that wasn't quite mainstream, but it had a following. 		In many of the Macrobiotics books, it talked of 'The Standard American Diet'.

As Presidents Day approaches, we will be looking at Presidents who had to make the most consequential decisions.
Tomorrow is Valentine's Day.		Half the nation is going to be giving each other cards, and candy.		A small, insignifcant % of people with loud voices are going to use Parkland as a reason to scream gun control.		This year, my side won't be listening. We don't have to anymore. https://t.co/dUy59Ec3Hk
The elections come and go, the years pass by, we all get older, and the real hotheads who obsess on gun control start getting physically sick and lose out on enjoying life. 		The point of America is self-independence. Americans have owned these rifles for generations.
The problem isn't the AR-15.		The problem is you.		You refuse to focus on the real problem of misguided youth on psych meds who are raised wrong, lose their empathy, and become experts at shooting video games all day long in their basement, before they snap.		Not our problem.
An AR-15 owner Conor Lamb won his election last year.		You don't have anywhere near the votes in America to ban the AR-15.		Since 2012, gun control is not an election issue. Parkland wasn't even an election issue. 		Just a lot of talk, talk, talk. https://t.co/633PnnmO8L
Howard Schultz is clueless on guns.		The AR-15 modern sporting rifle has been used safely in civilian use since 1963. (see ad)		For over 50 years, part of being American is responsibly owning and operating the AR-15.		Americans do not want to ban America's #1 rifle. https://t.co/9gfCPYy332
Through most of the 1930s, no shortage of people (from Eisenhower to Hemingway) saw another World War looming. 		Truth is, before Pearl Harbor was attacked, America was complacent, and not ready for war.		Pearl Harbor forced us to wake up.
Socialism isn't new. Europe is a centuries old breeding ground for horrible ideas gone wrong. 		Hoover (31st President) saw firsthand the catastrophic impact of socialism in Europe. 		Eisenhower (34th President) witnessed the devastation by fascism in Europe just 20 years later.
The battlefield of not one, but two horrific world wars in the 20th Century caused by 'socialism', Europe is today held together by USA security. 		If USA ever pulled back, Europe would likely disintegrate into a another full blown mass conflict across that continent.
As some of us far older than 29 years old know, history tends to repeat itself.		A Green New Deal like promoted on NPR would destroy our nation's strength, energy, and ability to defend ourselves and allies.		Then, only a matter of time until a real existential threat came along.
As of 1933, Germany had it's enlightened Weimar Constitution for only 14 years. 		But Hitler was able to suspend key civil rights with lightning speed.		Just 12 years after Hitler suspended the Weimar Constitution prohibiting censorship, up to 20 million had perished in Europe.
Of World War ll, Eisenhower once said: 		"This Army was sustained in the field by the unparalleled industrial genius and might of a free economy" https://t.co/nOusS87R04
This year is the 75th anniversary of D-Day, and you will be hearing a lot about the sacrifices of Americans that day, both overseas, and at home. 		On June 6th, 1944 some lived. Many died. And there was a lot of prayer. And that's how D-Day went down. https://t.co/wrIxNAqgQ9
As American men stormed beaches of France in 1944 to secure systems of self government and 'real' freedom (for the second time in 30 years) American women were coming into their own, taking jobs in factories, during wartime.		This is when women began to rise up in the workforce. https://t.co/dx8Xyy8Y0Z
Maybe a woman will win the Presidency oneday, and maybe not. Up to the electorate.		Whatever happens, we just want 400 years of decency, civility and sacrifice to be bequeathed to future generations, and so on.		See?
A more accurate statement would be the decency, civility and deep sacrifice of white, male Christians over the last 400 years. 		That doesn't mean (at all) women and POC didn't contribute, but we're being honest here. Right?		Women especially played a huge part, as homemakers.
From Presidents Day to Christmas Day, America's Federal Holidays are an annual reminder of the decency, civility and deep sacrifice of white Christians:		- Washington's B-Day	- Memorial Day	- Independence Day	- Columbus Day	- Veterans Day	- Thanksgiving Day	- Christmas Day https://t.co/PRXeoo2R5g
When we let ignorant anti-Semite barbarians from third world nations into our nation, and let them swear an oath to our sacred Judeo-Christian Constitution, we get uncivilized, low bar behavior. 		Early white American settlers have bequeathed us 400 years of civilized behavior.
In my debate appoach, never saying white people are superior to other races, but white people (and Jews) did bring decency, intelligence and civility to America hundreds of years ago, and modern day, we should be challenging ourselves to continually live up to this highest bar. https://t.co/YgRgfo9ynN

This Presidents Day, we will be honoring some of the greatest white men in all of human history.		The American Presidency is like no other office, and to win the Presidency is to overcome astronomical odds.
44 of our Presidents put USA first.		They were all male. We know a man  has excelled at the Presidency for two centuries. 		Is America really ready for a woman President? Only if the electorate says yes. If voters say no in 2020, you need to let go, and move on.
"Here again, in the 20th Century for the second time, Americans, along with the rest of the free world, but Americans had to come across the ocean, to defend those same values." -Eisenhower talks American sacrifice with Walter Cronkite in 1964		#PresidentsDay https://t.co/i6RPcbrEld

Yes, each and every Presidents Day we'll be honoring a ton of white folks, because we're a mostly white nation, with a deep white culture and proud heritage. 		And so far, no woman has been elected to our nation's highest office. 		Hillary just didn't have what it took.
Fortunately, with Presidents Day next Monday, we'll be honoring our finest Presidents over the next several days, who exemplifed the very best of male Americanism. 		- Solid Leadership Qualities	- Have Real Accomplishments	- Understand USA military history	- Were Very Book Smart https://t.co/1m39hLfUUR
Cory Booker called for the Virginia Lt. Gov. to resign without knowing all the facts.		This demonstrates terrible judgment on Booker's part. 		Like Kamala, and Warren, etc, they are not qualified, or have the integrity to be an American President.
Lt. Gov Fairfax accuser previously had a restraining order put on her Politico reports. 		This demonstrates emotional instability on the accuser part, and brings to light a potential pattern. 		Women should not be believed just to believe them. 		Sometimes women are psychos.
"A woman who alleged Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax raped her in college was accused of harassing and threatening a man she had a relationship with, according to Maryland court records." https://t.co/CyxmUkTrup
For Presidents Day, we look back at 1964. Gen. Eisenhower reflects on D-Day with Walter Cronkite:		"These men came here, to storm these beaches, for one purpose only. Just to preserve freedom. Systems of self government. Many thousands of men have died for ideals such as these." https://t.co/s6Onr88qTA
The fight of our lives is not about winning another Presidential election. 		It is about restoring the America Eisenhower invaded France for. 		We invaded France in 1944 to destroy an existential threat to our way of life, waged by a vegetarian, genocidal Nazi.
The climate, gun and equality debates are no longer rational. 		They are being driven by emotionally unbalanced (probably on meds too) people who are driven to tear apart the America we love, and replace with something no one has thought out.
Cows have been farting for thousands of years, and the planet has been just fine.
I'm not at all opposed to better treatment for farmed animals, and I'd like to see more organic food (less pesticides).		But the idea to limit meat to a civilization that evolved for thousands of years on hunting and cooking meat, is off the charts kooky.
But I want this vegan debate. 		Because I know more about the subject than Booker does. He became a vegetarian around 1992.		I was reading 'Diet for a New America' and into sustainable agriculture in 1988.
Population of vegetarians in USA is about 3%. About 0.5% Americans are vegans. And this was from a study by Vegetarian Times.		We live in a nation of mean eaters. The electorate doesn't want to be told by an inner city globalist asshole how to eat their food, or what to eat.
I tend to be very suspicious of totalitarian vegetarians who reference Nazism. 		Pretty good at spotting those with a hidden agenda. Who selfishly want to transform America into their own UnAmerican image.
"Hitler’s apparent enthusiasm for vegetarianism reflected the Nazi obsession with Aryan bodily purity.		In 1942, Hitler told Joseph Goebbels that he intended to convert Germany to vegetarianism when he won the war." https://t.co/F4QzRoOXPk

The point of America is self-reliance, and self-independence. 		Personal responsibility. 		In 1964, the argument that blacks were not free for 340 years so they don't have it as easy as white folks was fair. But that's not relevant anymore.  		Way too many black success stories.
What's missing most in black leadership are honest, genuine black leaders who will tell their own communities that they've come a very long way since the 1960s, but much of the work left to do is not up to everyone else, but on them.		Personal responsibility. 		Self awareness.
With Cory Booker, we're back to everyone must rise up. Booker has a hidden agenda. Watch.		But again, Americans aren't going to rise up for inner city politics. The numbers just aren't there.		We need a new generation of sane black leaders who don't push division, fear and chaos.
And another thing, I am always suspicious when black or ethnic folks use Nazi analogies in their fearmongering. 		Like Cory Booker, or Or Obama did.		Young people are too uneducated these days to know what America sacrificed in WWll, and Nazism is a subtheme in black communities.

FDR at 1942 State of the Union: 		"The world is too small to provide adequate "living room" for both Hitler and God.		They know that victory for us means victory for religion. And they could not tolerate that." https://t.co/9UgDg984jf
FDR at 1942 State of the Union: 		"The Nazis have now announced their plan for enforcing their new German, pagan religion all over the world—a plan by which the Holy Bible and the Cross of Mercy would be displaced by Mein Kampf and the swastika and the naked sword." https://t.co/m4UxcpplJu
FDR was born and raised a Christian, and his policies often reflected his religious beliefs.		Some could argue (at the time) the New Deal was Biblically inspired.		Make no mistake. FDR saw Hitler as an 'existential threat' to USA, and waged war to defeat the Nazi threat.
FDR was a flaming liberal, and the New Deal threw a wrench into the spirit of America's conquered frontier. 		It is what it is. 		FDR's World War ll speeches lay out in clear words that America was out to defeat global forces of evil (Hitlerism, Fascism) to secure Christendom.

But to the patriotic Muslims who call America home, whenever these anti-Semetic Muslims ignorantly and with hate, mouth off about Jews and Israel, it gives the Muslim cause a bad name.		In America, you really should know our history, and know your role.
I can't speak for secret Muslims, meaning polticians who don't have the guts or integrity to be up front about who and what they are.		But again, demographics are destiny.
Need real perspective. 		There aren't going to be many Muslim politicians in Congress, at all. Clearly, the 1-2 in Congress now have more ignorance than smarts. 		One or two (or so) Muslims in Congress are the all the demographics of USA will allow. https://t.co/IS26ca7eHs

A week from tomorrow is Washington's Birthday, aka Presidents day. 		A great time each and every single year to rediscover what America really is. 		Jews and all.

No one cares about climate in USA, the votes won't be there, and the botched rollout of the green deal by a 29 year old know nothing risks getting everyone running for cover as climate fades from policy view overtime.
After the kooky communists have killed some 1.5 billion cows to stop cow farts, and there's no more milk in the grocery stores (or ice cream), you really think hundreds of millions of Americans are going to like that direction?
No one thought any of his through. You can't eliminate some 250 million vehicles in USA and stop all air travel without destroying the global economy for the next 100 years.
By the time 2020 rolls around, you will not be able to name one thing climate has damaged. Same in 2024. And 2028.		It's fake science.		Without destroying air and car travel, there is no climate movement. All that's left now is watered down policy pie in the sky fantasy.

As far as I am concerned, nothing  can teach future generations of Americans what this nation is really about better than speeches from men who were, or would oneday become President.
France had been invaded and occupied by the Nazis in 1940.		In 1940 and 41, Britain was under heavy air attack from the Nazis.

With an average of 900,000 abortions performed each year, any reasonable human would want to knock that number significantly down, to build that culture of life.		40,000 gun deaths? How about a goal of less than 100,000 abortions each year?
In cases of rape and incest, Roe v. Wade gives women a window of time to make a decision.		And in my debate, yes, the baby is developing for the full term, but I'm not even (at this time) arguing on 2nd trimester. 		The nation isn't 100% Christian anymore, and this is real world.
Maybe women need to be more mature about 'limitations' in life. No one gets everything they want in life.		Women are biologically made up to have babies, and there is great responsibility here.
I'm not a culture of death guy. I see the late term unborn as developing, and newly born as American citizens.		The moment you are born in USA, you are an American citizen, guaranteed the same rights as a 20 year old, or a 65 year old. 		That's a culture of life.
I'm not here to attack Roe v. Wade. That's settled law, and I believe a woman should be in control of her own body until she is carrying a 2nd body that is developing into an American citizen.		If women cannot be responsible enough in late term, the state should make new laws.
OAC's 15 minutes of fame will be up soon.		- Her team just published a policy that they had to quickly delete the page on. 		- She acts like a rebellious teenager with no commonsense, getting a free ride by a clueless media 		- Her other Twitter acct has just over 100k followers
The current 2 year House of Representatives is a rage filled circus of low quality politicians who are acting out on groupthink, envy and anger. 		You get a promised 2 years.
Is OAC admitting she has a 430 credit score?		Poor or not, a credit score tells a lot about how financially responsible people are. 		In life, if you can't balance your own budget, and control your own debt, people won't hire you to manage other people's money.
People need to learn their own limitations in life.		"Four percent of Democrats said they would back Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 3 percent said former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and 2 percent prefer Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren" https://t.co/PjFUcHo6Vx
Let Warren persist in own delusions of grandeur until her polling drops her through the cracks.
Reminder. Just let Elizabeth Warren's words and her bottom feeding polling rise up and float away.
A woman should control her own body. 		But once a pregnant woman reaches her 3rd or 4th trimester, she controls two living beings. 		In most cases, if women can't be responsible enough to deliver that baby to birth, stronger laws need to be passed to protect the unborn, and born.
"The gun insures that the	people are the equal of their government whenever that government forgets that it is	servant and not master of the governed. 		When the British forgot that they got a revolution." -Ronald Reagan, 1975 (Guns and Ammo) https://t.co/Mfoa4YF0cl
40,000 gun deaths vs. 900,000 abortions.		Do the math. Statistical deaths in USA over the next 100 years:		- Abortions: 90 million	- Heart Disease: 60 million	- Cancer:  60 Million	- Accidents: 14 million	- Diabetes: 8 million	- Guns: 4 Million
Not trying to be a dick, but not like the black community is growing much, at all.		The KKK Dems, and their grand wizard governors have rigged the black population growth for the next century. 		Truth hurts, bitch.
Meanwhile, 900,000 abortions are performed every year in USA, and the significantly high rate of abortions in the black community maintains their population rate of roughly 13% for generations. 		Sorry you were too dumb to figure that one out on your own.
The median household income in America is about $60,000.		The majority of Americans do not want higher taxes. 		The poverty rate in America is a small 13%, and black population is 13%, yet the fringe left are obsessed with an equality no one wants.		These people are mentally ill.
As a nation, we have let idiotic people swear an oath to protect our Constitution who are openly calling for the destruction of our agencies, allies, and supporting our enemies. 		It is crazy. 		We need a forced reset.
At this point, whether in 2020, or 2024, would be incredibly irresponsible for Donald Trump to leave the White House. 		They want to destroy America and the govt as we know it.		Maybe Trump should takeover now.

But the truth is, not only can't USA afford your wacky ideas, but you don't have anywhere near the votes. 		All you do is talk, talk, talk.
- First you'll need good name recognition, combined with decent, consistent polling.		- Then you have to beat Trump.		- Then you have to get your crazy, expensive, unpopular ideas passed through a very divided Congress.		- Then your idea has survive the courts, and SCOTUS.
If Trump went to Civil War and wiped out the mainstream media, like progressives want to wipe out the airline industry, or employer insurance, and replace all these media positions with people who reflect the majority of the nation, all these policy debates would just go away.
This segment of progressives who want to literally destroy America is in the 20% population range. 		Their message is amplified because they dominate the mainstream media.		But they don't win elections or policy that matter, because they don't have the votes.
I blame the baby boomers. They poorly raised a generation of kids to not appreciate America as all previous generations did.
The next reality check of the day is there is a segment of progressive Dems who literally want to destroy America, and remake it in their own image in the name of equality, without thinking any of it through.
USA has a $20 trillion economy, with CEOs and executives flying around the world to grow and maintain our economic power, and a 29 year old know nothing from the Bronx suggests destroying the airline industry, while Dem 2020ers endorse it.

Of course Kamala endorsed destroying the airline industry.		She isn't as bright as you'd think.
If you want to define yourself as a 'kook' off the ridiculous ideas of a 29 year old with 93,000 Twitter followers (Congressional account), that's your business, but when your 15 minutes of fame are up, no one will remember who you were.
Any Dem 2020er who endorsed: 		- Destroying the airline industry and air travel		- Rebuilding all buildings		- Supporting people not willing to work		Will need to answer for this in the national debates; if they can get and maintain polling needed to be in the debates.

In 1984, I thought after investing in Michael Jackson attire, I would be the coolest thing in the world. So I strutted around in Michael Jackson clothes, and everyone laughed at me. That was a deep wound.		I didn't really recover until I began wearing Def Leppard parachute pants.
I'm embarrased to admit that while in Phoenix in 1984, I once did dress up as Michael Jackson.		The red coat, gloves. All of it. But I never did blackface. That would be incredibly dumb to do in 1984.  Duh.		And Arizona was never a Confederate state.
I'm not dumb. 		I'm arguing that: 		You don't grow up in a former Confederate state, in a region where 30-60% of the 1860 population was once a slave, or go to school in the city where Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson are laid to rest and dress up as Michael Jackson in 1984.

In a court of law, you don't get to admit to/apologize for something like Northam did, and walk it back the next day.		As a public official, once you've apologized, and identified yourself as the culprit, it's a done deal.
Like the infamous George Wallace moment, these things take time to play out. 		We've got all the time in the world to watch the Virignia Governor demonstrate terrible leadership, after he apologized for being in the picture, then a day later denied it. https://t.co/OhhqYB6sD0
The longer Gov. Northam remains defiant, after intentionally apologizing for being in this KKK picture, which an old classmate sure knew about, Dems lose their charge on who and what qualifies as racist. 		Double standards need no longer apply. https://t.co/cCamleT3Pj
Gov. Northam can be defiant as long as he wants:		- His political career is over. 		- He apologized for being in that picture. 		- Near everyone wants his resignation. Every 2020 Dem wants him out. 		- With elections coming, toxicity will help GOP.
Americans clearly don't want: 		- Medicare-for-all	- A new green deal	- Free college		Outside of inner city ghetto neighborhoods, there is no consumer demand to drive up taxes to fund programs Americans simply don't want. 		Time for new debate topics.
Do the math. The average median income in USA is about $60k. 		In the inner city ghetto, $25k to $38k. 		Americans don't want to tax the rich. Americans don't need to tax the rich.		The poor need better politicians who can secure job creation investments in their neighborhoods.
Left leaning polls publish left leaning results.		There is going to be no significant tax increase on the rich in the next 2 years. 		Odds are good, GOP wins back House seats and likely holds onto the Senate in 2020.
As the Virginia Governor's Confederate era defiance leads to toxicity, let's turn our attention to the statue of Margaret Sanger in the Smithsonian, who:		- Promoted her ideas to the KKK		- Spoke of Negro Extermination		- Her genocidal ideas were probably stolen by the Nazis https://t.co/DK8L9VrybW

Americans don't want to attack billionaires. Americans want good paying jobs that billionaires create. 		Maybe a small overall % of inner city ghetto folks hate billionaires, but that's life in a wealthy nation. 		If you want a bigger paycheck, go out and earn it.
Does your wacky policy idea appeal to the masses, or just your unhealthy, inflated ego.		Americans want lower health care costs. Not be removed from their employer insurance plans. 		A good example is insulin. Americans want you to fix the outrageous insulin cost problem. K? https://t.co/TuL6EE2Kvg
- First you'll need good name recognition, combined with decent, consistent polling.		- Then you have to beat Trump.		- Then you have to get your crazy, expensive, unpopular ideas passed through a very divided Congress.		- Then your idea has survive the courts, and SCOTUS.

"The eugenics movement was really a social program masquerading as a scientific one." -Michael Crichton (State of Fear)
Margaret Sanger was a communist, eugenics freak, and her ideas are arguably AntiChrist. 		And she took her 'Baby Code' vision to the KKK!
Yes, that point applies to first and second trimesters, but real world is real world.
Sorry, I'm just not a culture of death kind of guy.		The church needs to excommunicate! 		A woman should control her own body, but by the 3rd and 4th trimester she is in control of two bodies. 		It is unacceptable how high the abortion rates are for African Americans.
In 1934, Sanger wrote: 		"At present there are in the United States about 157 birth control clinics, some of them restricted as to the help they may give. We need thousands of clinics, with greatly enlarged scope of activity." https://t.co/kYZ8KZtTzB

Yeah, I know. My spelling sucks tonight.

Cuomo may not care, but the church should excommunicate anyway. 		And if the church doesn't, it will lose more credibility.		There need to be spiritual consequences for this kind of immoral behavior.		A message needs to be sent.

I generally avoid abortion politics, but this is infanticide, and it is 100% unacceptable. 		This is murdering infants. Not who we are as a nation.		May need to look at forcibly taking abortion away from the left, like Trump is taking away endless war from the Neocons.

It's OK that USA can't afford big expensive socialist govt programs.		You can't always get what you want. Not even a little.		Kind of like when your were a kid, your parents told you they couldn't afford something, and you kicked and screamed, but eventually accepted it.
Whenever Sanders, Warren, or any freakshow member of the House threaten to tax the rich, or talk about expensive programs we can't afford, I recommend rolling your eyes, and watch their 'talk, talk, talk', rise up and float away.		Eventually, begin to ignore them.
If you are waiting for the next Congress to push extreme policy, just remember, Paul Ryan's health care leadership drove House GOP off a cliff in 2018 midterms. He's gone.		As long as Republicans improve health care and not attack it, should be good to win back House seats.
When it comes to big, expensive progressive programs, you don't have the votes, or consumer demand. 		Getting time for the nation move on from extreme policy debates (medicare for all, taxing the rich, free college) that will not become law.
Americans don't want socialism. Socialist politicians get limited play in the inner cities. 		Americans don't want taxes raised. They don't want big govt programs we can't afford. 		2020 will weed out the progressive fringe who really have no national support. Watch.

Theoretically, say some long shot POTUS candidate who felt the Constitution was an outdated white supremacist document (but swore to protect it anyway) won the Presidency, but wanted to break all the rules to advance an unAmerican ideology.		What do you do?		Shut down the govt!

If POTUS isn't prepared to shoot the hostage like tough American leaders of past would (if needed), people will never take govt shutdowns or debt ceiling negotiation opportunities credibly. 		How will we ever lower our debt, or strengthen border security like border patrol wants?
- For the 21st Century, govt shutdowns give Constitutional abiding lawmakers a tool to negotiate when their opposition is playing by unAmerican rules. Also a  tool to use if a POTUS goes rogue.		- Debt ceiling is another historical negotiating opportunity.
My Debt Ceiling Position, in 2017 and now:		- Use debt ceiling as annual opportunity to drive fiscal responsibility on budget, spending and reducing debt.
If America simply can't afford fringe left programs like Medicare for all, or free college (we can't afford), reality and consumer demand tells us we'll need to change the subject (for good), and talk about government spending we can afford.
Progressives get a lot of bandwith because the media is dominated by progressives, but if progressives and their ideas aren't electable, there will soon be no use for progressives in our narrative.		And look, BuzzFeed and HuffPo are struggling. Not much consumer demand there.
New England progressives who want to jack up taxes aren't polling well.		"Four percent of Democrats said they would back Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), 3 percent said former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, and 2 percent prefer Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren" https://t.co/PjFUcHo6Vx

Kamala is the nation's worst nightmare, and this was only her first disaster. 		When someone shows you who they are, believe them.
Ripping people with pre-existing conditions away from employer healthcare for the uncertainty of  incompetent govt run health care is horrifying for 170 million Americans who work hard for their paycheck, and insurance coverage.
Too bad Kamala didn't do her homework. You'd think any top notch politician running for President would know this, seeing as health care is America's #1 election issue.
As word of Kamala's intent to wipe out insurance continues to spread (can't walk that back), millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions will not forget who wants to eliminate their health care security.
CNN says Kamala Harris had record ratings for her town hall, which isn't   that much, because more people watched MSNBC and Fox that night, but record CNN viewers got to watch Kamala enthusiastically get behind a policy that no one wants, and would wreak havoc on health care.

After several years of being on the fence with climate change, what led me to the my debate position were three things:		- Became groupthink. No one knows anything about climate.		- I question 550 ppm in year 2100, when Earth has seen 1200 - 7000 ppm.		- The ridiculous hysteria.
If you are into climate, you need to understand PPM (Parts Per Million) of CO2. 		Main push on climate science is 350 ppm is considered a safe level for humans, but if we don't act NOW, all **** may or may not happen in 100+ years at 550ppm.		We're about 410 ppm now.

"You must study to be frank with the world: Frankness is the child of honesty and courage." -Gen. Robert E. Lee https://t.co/xLXka00IQT
People are sitting at their computers on Twitter for years and years now. No real struggle. No understanding of sacrifice. They live off wacky ideas and contagious outrage.		No understanding of the fury of war military leaders like Napolean, Lee or Eisenhower took to their enemy.
You look at the world like, OMG 800,000 govt workers (who know the risks of working for govt) didn't get paid for a few weeks, but are getting paid.		I look at American history and know the freedom our forefathers fought and died for, is worth shooting the hostage for now.
America was built by revolutionaries, who got into duels, and lived by the sword. 		We have an enemy within. A force of totalitarianism that will keep creeping forward, until destroyed.		Either Trump is the leader who will shoot the hostage, or he isn't. https://t.co/h2jA4QXu4D

If 2020 came down to Trump vs. Schultz (never say never), I'm voting for Trump, but at this point, Schultz is much more fun, and more intriguing. 		I don't agree with much of Schultz's policy ideas, but the way he infuses business espertise into politics is great stuff.
We got a whole new generation of politicians and activists who know zero about running a business, what a balance sheet is, or what insolvency means. 		Congress should pass a law requiring every Congressional lawmaker to take a business course.

The 2020 'Clown Show' wants to raise taxes, fuel race wars, destroy the economy w/ climate, and hurt job creators, further stressing out an electorate that is struggling with endless cost of living increases, now facing the elimination of mass jobs in the next 20 years. 		Crazy!
One reason why I am very interested in the narrative Howard Schultz will bring to the 2020 table (while the clown show obsesses on race), is because the higher the national debt goes, the less signifcant wage growth we'll see as a nation.		Lowering debt = higher wages, long term.
Outside of govt jobs US taxpayers pay for, U.S Govt does not know how to 'create' jobs for a nation of 330 million.  		A 'responsible' govt is responsible for creating and maintaining optimal economic conditions for job growth so billionaires and their companies can create jobs.
Silicon Valley angel investors write interesting books, and know how to make billions (fair game), but they completely suck at understanding American political trends, and are out of touch with the common American, who they'll make huge $$$ wiping out in coming years.
Both Donald Trump and Howard Schultz know how to create jobs. 		The 'Clown Show' of fringe dem candidates know zero about creating jobs, how the economy works, or why the middle class is disappearing. 		OK for billionaires to run for POTUS, but not OK to attack Americanism.
Howard Schultz net worth is reportedly over $3 billion. 		His former company (Starbucks) helped create over 270,000 jobs.		But if Silicon Valley has it's way, businesses like Cafe X are going to eliminate many Starbucks jobs.		So Howard Schultz should run for POTUS anyway, https://t.co/woyHUc2Vnd
Creative destruction is a side effect of capitalism. Jobs are going to be destroyed no matter what as industry runs its course. 		But purposely wiping out 40% or more the global workforce to maximize gross profit is idiotic.
Memo to American Billionaires:		- You are valued as a job creator. Not a job destroyer.		- You earned your money fair and square in America's capitalist economy.		- It is your money, and you pay your fair share when you create good jobs

We've lost our minds if we are blindly moving into a world where 40% of all jobs could be eliminated by 2040, and "AI is considered “the last technology that humans will build” as it will in turn create for us." as Jeremiah Owyang says,
I don't want to tax American billionaires. 		I want them to put their investment capital to work to create jobs. Not destroy mass jobs to maximize a healthy gross profit. 		In some cases I want to break up huge monopolies, where a concentration of power attacks American freedoms.

Thing about America is, you have to have a tough, thick skin to be an American. 		Freedom is won through struggle.		You don't get everything you want. None of us do.		There's always going to be a force that slaps you in the head to remind you life isn't just about you.

If you took the time yesterday to read Martin Luther King's 5000 word 'Letter From Birmingham Jail', you can clearly see what King's aspirations were. 		To integrate black folks into America's Western Civilization, and get your 340 years of constitutional and God given rights.
Is there sill work to do? Of course. 		But we can't get much more done when the black nationalists with their hatred and bitterness are attacking white culture, for their own selfish purposes.		That wasn't Martin Luther King's dream.
You can tell John Lewis that the revolution of 1776 is over.		The near entire U.S. govt paid tribute to Martin Luther King yesterday.		What's left is a movement of bitterness, hated and black nationalism, that folks like Sharpton, Farrakhan, Kamala, Booker are ever consumed with.
It wasn't just MLK.		It was John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Frederick Douglass, Malcom X, James Meredith, John F. Kennedy, and so many others. https://t.co/H0x6nHEWyq
More than anyone, it was Martin Luther King that led black folks to getting their total American freedom and birthright that the Civil War and reconstruction couldn't deliver.		Not Al Sharpton. Or Farrakhan.
My side wants black folks to be happy, successful, and integrated into our 400 year society of self-dependence and self reliance.		The crowd of Biden, Bloomberg, Booker, Kamala wants big govt to coddle black folks into a modern plantation.
Americans don't want to talk race 24/7/365 with people too immature to have class.		What we did wrong after the Civil War, and into the 1960s, is not integrate black folks into our culture of self-dependence. 		That led to a force of bitterness and hatred. Just ask Cory Booker.
Somehow, it's just not enough that America just honored Martin Luther King, like a king.		That a black man was President.		That Muhammad Ali is 'The Greatest'.		That black folks are hugely successful in all walks of life.		'Real racism' is gone in America.
America is a land of 70% white folks. Who built this nation. 13% black. 		We need to keep perspective.		Observe those among us, who as Martin Luther King pointed out in 1963 are fueled with bitterness and hate.		Remember, 'real racism' is gone. And black folks are free.

Martin Luther King was both Christian, and a great friend to the Jews.		He wrote of two forces in 1963, one which was a force of bitterness and hatred, driving black nationalism, and a hatred of white people. 		We need to destroy this force. https://t.co/pcwwKTUAjZ

Americans don't want to talk race 24/7/365. Nor does race win elections in America.		And clearly some people can't handle Martin Luther King Day without resorting to low quality behavior, and lodging baseless accusations to get headlines.

No one ever gets held accountable in MSM, so this brand of journalism remains unhealthy, and untrustworthy.		Joy Reid stiill has a job. So does Fareed Zakaria.		This isn't what high school journalism taught me.
From years of observation, I expect CNN and MSNBC to completely cover for BuzzFeed in times like this. 		Meanwhile, those who lunged for the BuzzFeed story to demonstrate their expertise are in systems fail explain mode tonight.
Buzzfeed got slammed big time. But WaPo, NYT, CNN MSNBC (and many others) have made big ethical mistakes for several years.		Liberals are always ready to look the other way when their own fail big time.		And yes, some conservatives jumped on the Buzzfeed story too,

There should be drug testing for anyone who made an accusation toward the President (or confronted POTUS with an @) based off false BuzzFeed reporting. 		Real journalists aren't this dumb.
Don't let anyone in MSM or politics get away deleting the tweets they published since last night on the BuzzFeed story.		If they published a tweet after everything BuzzFeed has done in the last several years, they are not professionals, and should never be trusted again.

After gun control activists obsessively stalked the nation in the last 3 major elections (since 2014), why any candidate would run on gun control in America again is beyond me. 		But donors need to decide for themselves who to waste the really big money on.
Gillibrand's odds inched up to 4% in the last few hours.		That's why they use the word 'exploratory' first. 		Before donors start taking anyone seriously, need to make sure their campaign has legs, and they have national appeal.

Long term, the #1 most important thing to do to reinvigorate Western Civilization is to teach our nation's children (preschool through College, at their level; all of them!), at all times:		- American History	- Our Western Values	- What We've Accomplished	- Work Ethic
I dont want to be the guy tweeting the word TREASON all the time. But its getting old watching everyone try to sell out the nation we love.		People won't take treason seriously until there are serious, tangible consequences to those who have truly betrayed the nation.
Beto's jabs at the Constitution shows what kind of character he has. 		If he really runs (a failed Senate Candidate who fled the scene of a DWI) with low name recognition, when 2020 is over, he won't be worth saying good riddance too.
If newer generations don't understand the values of Western Civilization, what's in it for them to defend it?		So yeah, we have some work to do to reinvigorate our Civilization, and as the wall idea slowly gains support, when it finally goes up, will be a big win for the West.
Obama's Border Patrol head wanted a wall too.		Putting up a wall has nothing to do with racism.		It's about protecting our nation, institutions, and values, and stopping election and electoral fraud.
Dems are going to have to start lowering their expectations on a great many things, including the limits of internationalism. 		We have bigger fish to fry at home, and globalist issues don't drive elections.
That leaves a future rogue Dem President pushing a foreign invasion. Again, treason. With grave consequences.		Thankfully we have 300 million guns, and 2 trillion rounds of ammo, with a Constitutional right to defend our homeland. ;)
I'd argue, the only way to end the Constitution would be by a Constitutional Convention, and that's not going to happen, because the power base of this nation, and Constitutional voting districts loves our law of the land.
You can't ditch the Constitution, the one everyone swears an oath to support and defend.		To betray the govt of the USA for internationalism, is effectively treason.		It would be far more appropriate to get out of our international agreements, which Trump is somewhat working on.
Maybe because Martin Luther King  was schooled in the classic studies of Western Civilization (where he learned critical thinking, writing skills) that he could compose a brilliant 5000 word letter in jail, that became one of America's most important documents. https://t.co/Pb6NZPzDxg

After 200+ years of self reliance and self-dependence that only Western Civilization can ensure, Americans have it coming from all kinds of directions:		- Ban guns. Leave folks defenseless		- Destroy the economy with climate policy		- 40% of jobs wiped out by 2040 by the machines
Universal basic income sounds interesting, for inner city folks. 		Until that money dries up after a year or two.		In life, sooner or later free money gets shut off. Either by the benefactor, or a new crop of politicans who need to cut spending.
Almost like Silicon Valley is investing in a jobless future, where mass suffering, poverty, and chaos will be the logical outcome.
The vast majority of people in America, (or the planet) will never be able to come up with $10,000 to $100,000 to invest in a startup, or dozens of startups.		They couldn't even scrape together $1000 to be a part of a syndicate.
I'm reading book after book by Silicon Valley Angel investors these days. A few thoughts:		- These guys are good writers. Very smart. Fun reading.		- They are convinced the 'jobpocalypse is coming.		- To survive the robots, you must be able to invest and make big $$$.
RT 60 Minutes: ...Within 15-20 years, 40% of the jobs in the world will be “displaceable” by artificial intelligence. But Lee says it’s important to understand that today A.I. is different from general intelligence. Machines are still not adaptable like humans … yet.
By the time 2020 rolls out (then 2024, 2028), you will not be able to point to one thing climate change has negatively impacted. 		But according to a 60 minutes report, by 2035-2040, 40% of jobs could be wiped out.
Imagine living in a nation where no one cares about climate change, and voters will vote no on climate issues in our elections.		Welcome to USA.
Who knew the Hindus were homophobes?
I don't believe soft bigotry is a big deal. 		Ribbing comes with the territory of being an American. 		Free Speech doesn't care about your feelings, but parents should raise well mannered children, and our politicians should have class.

There's always going to be polling uncertainty or temporary polling declines during tough battles, but Napoleon, Eisenhower and Lincoln didn't govern or wage battle watching daily polls.		Either you fight valiantly, and maybe lose to win big, or be defined by your surrender.
There may no deal for a long time to come. Dems aren't hurting enough yet.		So either cave now and get it over with, and let Dems use illegals for election purposes, or silently move onto other things while Dems squirm for a year or two in a battle with a big principle.
In 100 years, history won't remember a 1-2 year painful govt shutdown, but it will have a wall that kept out millions of illegal immigrants for 100 years that helped restore America to the nation it is supposed to be.
Napoleon wouldn't cave.		Neither would Eisenhower.		Or Lincoln.		Big principle here. War is messy and destructive. So is reckless immigration.
If POTUS caves and reopens the govt and gains ZERO, a big credibility hit to everyone who said he would never cave.

The values of Western Civilization aren't terribly difficult to grasp:		- Raise children to respect their teachers (and elders) and not act like animals.		- Build wealth. Give to charity.		- Don't confirm judges who rule the govt can pay for child sex offenders to get sex changes
"The Bible makes it clear that racial prejudice and hatred are sins, and no matter how deeply ingrained they may be in our hearts or our society, we need to repent of them and seek God’s forgiveness and help." -Billy Graham
You can't take your oath of office on defending the United States Constitution, and not support the values of Western Civilization. 		Unless you are a fraud, you can't be for one or the other.
America is the last frontier of Western Civilization.		Aside from King's poor wording choices or associations, which I won't defend, I am in agreement on the values of Western Civilization. 		We should have that debate.
If you are going to slam Steve King for his white supremacy overtones, need to knock out the black supremacists and antisemites too.		When you say no room for hate, let's be be honest who drives the most hate.		Race anger divides. Western Civilization was built on unity.
Americans want more health care protections, but they don't want medicare-for-all. 		They don't want their taxes raised either.

When the zip code of your Congressional voting district has a median household income of $26,000 (compared to $59,000, nationally), driving up the taxes of the wealthy (who create the jobs) somehow gets your govt programs to keep your neighborhood in poverty, forever.
Inner city demographics like Bronx and Detroit are way out of the mainstream. 		When it comes to elections, the radical politics of the fringe don't appeal to the vast majority. 		2018 midterms clearly showed this fringe movement, in limited inner city zip codes.
Democrats generally (to variable degrees, moderate to fringe) believe big govt is the answer to everyone's problems, and the state will ensure egalitarianism is a good deal for all. Literally.
If you are a real Republican, you are for limited govt and individual freedom.

America has been through escalating crisis situations before, where a President had to take matters into his own hands with emergency powers.		If it happens, America will survive such a challenge, and come out much stronger, and united on the other side.

In the 20th Century, you didn't get anywhere near the Presidency unless you were book smart. 		Karl Rove and George W. Bush had contests to see who could read the most books each year.		The internet has created a vacuum of stupidity, know nothings, and mentally stunted activists.

In the end, Midterms 2018 revealed: 		- Health Care, Economy and Immigration are issues that drive our elections.		- In the House, GOP shot themselves in the foot on health care.		- Guns were a non issue.

USA is NOT a theocracy. No one forcing anyone to be Christian.		But if you ran for Congress without reading the Preamble of the Constitution (or the entire Constitution), it's your sworn responsibility to 'secure the blessings of liberty' for 'We The People'. https://t.co/NveJFFoZ18
"Secure the Blessings of Liberty"		The Liberty Bell Inscription:		"Proclaim Liberty Throughout All The Land Unto All the inhabitants thereof" -Leviticus 25:10 https://t.co/XeY5BplIx5
The verse from Leviticus on the Liberty Bell refers to the ancient Jewish year of Jubilee. 		In every 50th year, the Jubilee restored the land and the equality of persons that prevailed when the children of Israel entered the land of promise!" -President Gerald Ford (1976) https://t.co/qw4wtbWtdP
America was founded on Christian principles. One only needs to read the wording on the Liberty Bell, or do some basic research. https://t.co/6qaLUt0iXW
The preamble of the US Constitution spells out the job description of our nation's elected officials.		- Establish Justice (Judeo-Christian)	- Insure domestic tranquility	- Provide for the common defence	- Promote the general Welfare	- Secure the Blessings of Liberty https://t.co/A0GOJ6dJtB
When newly elected officials swear an Oath to protect the US Constitution, this means protecting:		- The Bill of Rights	- Due Process	- The responsibility of Impeachment 	- Knowing what Treason is	- Abolition of Slavery	- The Right to Vote		228 years of sacred, imperfect history https://t.co/wbg5vqsMm4
Anyone who takes their 'Oath of Office' to support and defend the United States Constitution, but who is operating with a hidden agenda to undermine the Constitution is a fraud, and will be publicly labeled as such. https://t.co/eRXk2R8iPr
The very idea of any United States elected offical engaging in the pursuit of a global government, or any loss of USA sovereignty is paramount to 'treason'.		Treason is law of the land. 		18 U.S. Code § 2381
On Jan 3, 2019, the 116th Congress will convene, and many newly elected officials will swear their Oath of Office, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution.

Heaven can wait.		But the wall for America's Southern border can't.		Just like Heaven though, not everyone will get into America. https://t.co/0m7mzsFqoG
Offering up universal basic income while jobs are wiped out, does nothing much but turn 400 years of civilization built on work ethic into a nation of savages. 		Wiser solution is to outlaw (globally) technologies that wipe out jobs for humans.
Climate is not a threat to America.		Automation may be. 		If it is, and Americans elect future Presidents to stop this threat, certain companies/industries could be driven out of business, and we could go to war with rival nations to stop threats to our jobs.
If a tremendous amount of jobs are going to be wiped out by 2030, it's maybe time for (automation, robots, AI, work) to become a national election issue.
Americans have real problems to solve, both now, and into the future. 		Can narrow down what America's election issues are:		Americans want decent health care, good paying jobs, and not to have violent illegal aliens spreading disease or bringing drugs into our nation.
If you run and lose to a white male in 2020, please concede gracefully, because most of us are done with your 'sick' identity politics, and by then, no one will remember you for long anyway. 		White folks are your role models for how to win and lose elections.
If you lose to a white male in 2020 (or 2024, etc), not anyone's problem but yours.		But be sure to thank Obama. 		America gave a black man a chance in 2008, and by 2014 he blew it; maybe for everyone else, for good.
After 6 years and 3 major elections, if you run on gun control, and no one takes you seriously, that's your problem.		Same thing with climate. Been 12 years. 		If you run on issues Americans don't care about and lose hard, blame yourself.

I resisted Christmas Vacation as a legit Christmas movie for years, but lost that battle. 		The movie does put a corny spin on the best of American Christmas traditions, and big Christmas family dinners.
The 1980s 'Vacation' movies are Clark Griswold ridiculous. The first is the best. European Vacation sucked. 		Christmas Vacation has become a modern Christmas classic because of the generation that grew up on it.
I'm in the camp that Die Hard is a Christmas movie because it (to a point) radiates Christmas spirit, in an American way.		Not in a Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street way. Those are true Christmas movies.		Home Alone is a Christmas spirit radiating blockbuster.

Elf is a cheery, fun Christmas movie with a really good Santa sequence.
Partial govt shutdown is the ideal launching pad for this so important border security battle.		America is a Constitutional Republic, and shutdowns are simply a part of our type of govt.		Shutdowns are the only way to get important things done now.
A long extended shutdown creates new risk for big govt types. 		As Americans see govt programs shut down for a long period of time, there is a chance Americans lose interest in some govt programs, and feel they are no longer needed.
When China wanted stop invasions and raids, they built the Great Wall of China.

"The essence of Christian worship is love. The essence of Satanist 	worship is hate. For the Fallen Archangel now embodies a full hatred of being, as such.

America was built on family values. 		Family values were the bedrock of a social, moral, educational grounding, of what honestly built the American Empire.
19th Century writer from the British Empire (Western Civilization) who inspired C.S. Lewis saw "Fatherhood must be at the core of the universe".
On George MacDonald: 		"His father appears to have been a remarkable man—a man hard, and tender, and humorous all at once, in the old fashion of Scotch Christianity." -C.S. Lewis
"Far the most important thing we can know about George MacDonald is that an almost perfect relationship with his father was the earthly root of all his wisdom." -C.S. Lewis
George MacDonald (1824-1905) was an Scottish writer who wrote a Christian inspired novel that profoundly influenced C.S. Lewis. 		The book is called 'Phantastes' (1858).
"From his own father, he said, he first learned that Fatherhood must be at the core of the universe. He was thus prepared in an unusual way to teach that religion in which the relation of Father and Son is of all relations the most central." -C.S. Lewis, on George MacDonald

Big week ahead for American history. Like in 2004.		"And we watched, together, the arrival of Ronald Reagan at Andrews Air Force Base on a Sony Jumbotron in the corner of the bar." -Peggy Noonan https://t.co/j1OOYD0IAI
"An Air Force 747, one of the two used as Air Force One, had been sent to California, to the naval air station at Point Mugu, following Reagan’s death; it was about to bring his flag-draped coffin to Andrews Air Force Base, in Maryland." -Peggy Noonan
Peggy Noonan wrote: 		"...on the hot, sultry afternoon of June 9, 2004. I was in Washington, D.C., for the funeral of Ronald Reagan. About a hundred of us, his old cabinet chiefs, party elders, and those who’d worked with him, had come together.."
Peggy Noonan quiet on Twitter this weekend. 		As a speechwriter for both Reagan and Bush, she plays a role at times in a block of the most influential years (1981-1992) in American history, as some of your favorite Reagan and Bush speech lines were penned by Peggy herself.
On July 15, 1988, George H.W. Bush wrote to Peggy Noonan (speechwriter), about where he wanted the nation to go.		Bush's values (words he liked): "Family, loyalty, kids, freedom, grandkids, caring, love, heart, decency, faith, honor, service to country, pride, excellence."
We had civil and decent leaders in America, because we had a nation that raised civil and decent families for most of the 20th Century.
Everyone talking how how decent and civil President George H.W. Bush was. This is true, but note:		- Population of USA in 1988 was 240 million		- Near 90% of population was Christian		- Nearly all businesses shut down on Thanksgiving and Christmas
Europe is an idiot.		You saw how POTUS handled refugee lawlessness at the border.		Nothing new. 		Get used to it, as we fix our immigration, and restore 200 years of precedent.		We can't have a kinder, gentler nation when know nothing anti-semites are elected to our government. https://t.co/visbp7g8kD
Can't have a kinder, gentler nation when we keep letting barbarians in the country illegally (or legally), or letting lowlife scum anti-semites inspire thugs to beat up Jews in NYC.		That's not working. 		Consider yourself on notice.

Well, a kinder, gentler nation for those who respect this nation, and it's history.		Otherwise, move somewhere else!		Newly elected officials will soon swear an oath to a Judeo-Christian inspired set of laws. 		Quit fooling yourself that U.S. Constitution means anything else.
If you truly hate Israel, America can NOT be your home. 		You should move to Africa, Europe, or Canada, before our nation gets its historic wits together and forces you out. 		Anti-Semites are a very low form of scum, and not worthy of this nation.
Those who promote blatant anti-semitism in the US should NOT call themselves Americans, and should consider themselves to be temporary guests in this nation, where Jews are the incumbents.

George H.W. Bush spoke of a "kinder, gentler nation" in Aug 1988. 		Bush was elected President in Nov 1988. Roy Orbison died a month later in Hendersonville, TN. 		Bush41 will be laid to rest on Dec 6, the 30th anniversary of Roy Orbison's death.
