@ARmastrangelo @ciaglia I‚Äôll ask again, how is Muslim ideology different from the KKK other than the specifics of who is on their targeted groups for hate violence and death?
@BuzzPatterson Buzz, the CongressMuslim does not have the fantastic traits normally associated with strong independent patriotic American woman.  Therefore please refer to that individual as a CongressMuslim.  Thank You.
@earthstar12 @bbusa617 @shadowbirddog @SpeakerPelosi There are some Folks in Mexico know the answer.

@SenSchumer Chuck, Officer Singh was a LEGAL IMMIGRANT doing his job when killed by an illegal alien.  Enough with your crap.  Fund the wall, protect our borders and save an innocent life!  How many more people need to be trafficked or killed for you to drop your politically motivated sham?
@RealJamesWoods @washingtonpost @GOP Traditional Democrats were good for the country.  Provided balance on issues and a perspective different from mine.  Muslims are not traditional Democrats.  They hate Jews, LGBT and Christians.  Sharia law has ZERO in common w traditional Democrats.

@MarkEbner59 @GOLeary12345 @DLoesch So the discussion concludes with Whaaaaa I hate Trump!  You guys are too much!
@RepAdamSchiff The Trump Administration has been unable to hold clowns like you, Hillary, Debbie W-S, Podesta, Soros, Menendez, Brennan, Comey, OBama, and many others for horrific behavior.  You should probably keep a low profile because eventually the truth will come out.
@AmyMek @Jonwooderman What would you expect from a hate filled Muslim?
@davidmweissman The problem Conservatives like me have with "liberals" is that liberals are aligned with ANTIFA, Sanctuary cities to the point of permitting harm to Americans, push hatred of police, ICE and disrespect to Military. FBI, HRC, DW-S lawless behavior problematic.
@GOLeary12345 @DLoesch @MarkEbner59 If you call that bullying you have lived a charmed life. I think you were spoiled by George Bush Jr who was ridiculed &amp; mocked routinely and simply asked for another beating.  Trump fights back and could care less what your or my "rules" for presidential behavior are.
@MarkEbner59 @GOLeary12345 @DLoesch Cute. So by implication if you found the tweet to be funny you are a racist?  By the same logic, I have determined that you support all people that cheat the system for personal gain and must in fact do so yourself!  If I am a racist then you must be a cheat? And racist too?
@GOLeary12345 @DLoesch @MarkEbner59 It's unfortunate that the media does not call out disengenious clowns like Elizabeth Warren.  If she was worth a crap she wouldn't have used the bogus ethnic claim crap to elicit sympathy.  Since MSM goes along for the gag it is up to Trump to call her out on it.

@MsAvaArmstrong Does it really matter?  The guy was not an American citizen, was reported to be an anti Semite, and is not someone that is our concern.  Otherwise we'd need to confront 80% of other countries who participate in bad behavior against political opponents
@LisaMei62 pathetic is all I can say about Swalwell
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Rep Seealwell,  you have the audacity to suggest that President Trump saw this woman bring her children to an illegal border crossing and said, FIRE! Hit the children first and then the woman!" which is what you are suggesting.  How about you stopping the BS?
@RagingGayCons @BubbaJoeBaker In my state Bob Menendez was re-elected, despite known corruption and predatory behavior.  Worse than embarrassing for NJ who is also responsible for Spartacus and ‚Äúits the weather mans fault‚Äù Phil Murphy.
@ScottPresler @gringaloca11 No Gay man or Lesbian woman deserves anything but equal treatment and freedom from abuse of any kind.  Same for Jews.  Ms Loomer attempting to shed light on those who seek to harm the aforementioned people.

@CHIZMAGA @kingjames.  Please reconsider meeting w President Trump.  You need to be a builder.  Set aside trying to be popular.  Be someone who contributes to unification and growth.
@robtdfischl @ryteouswretch @PatrioticCindy Funded anti American activity.  Increased racial tension, weaponized FBI, IRS, CIA against political opponents.  Hamstrung military capability in Afganistan.  Made all police villans.  Viewed as accomplishments by DNC.
@ryteouswretch @biker4marriage Depends on your perspective.  If your goal is to build a strong economy, destroy ISIS, foster peace and bring back America, then yes Trump for sure.  However OBama advanced the ball in the opposite direction a long way to the glee of anti American race baiting Globalists.
@thebradfordfile How did Mika obtain her position?  Sure she is a beautiful woman who at times is articulate, but there are thousands of others with those traits.  Does she enjoy some sort of special privilege?  Maybe not since she is now sitting with Morning Joke every day.

Also, LeBron should meet with Pres Trump to collaborate on ways to positively impact the Black American community.  I also disagree with many of the things stated by LeBron.

@jaketapper @Badmotorfingr1 Trump tweet is false. OBama marginalized our police and did nothing of substance for minorities.  He failed Israel, gave $B to Iran and told Trump &amp; Romney that elections couldn't be touched and Russians were no threat.  That unified many of us to ensure we don't repeat OBama.
@marklutchman 29% Not good enough.  Still a lot of work to do.  An easy step forward is to have an open &amp; constructive meeting w those that feel unsafe with or threatened by the police.  Then acknowledge that issues do exist &amp; work to fix.  Win for all.

@YouNicks @FoxNews Interesting video.  Assuming it is factually correct, who are nine approvers and what was their relationship to Clinton's.  Where was Barry?  That's right, he had long ago dismissed Russia as an adversary, so no issues there.  Clinton foundation simply made a mistake?

@Lawrence Yes they did.  They walked away with 20% of US uranium.  IRAN was also successful in getting the then POTUS (Prince of Iran or maybe puppet) to literally bow to their leader while forking over $1.7B to them.  I suppose HRC &amp; Barry counted them as two wins?

@rattsmo @AEnghouse @mtnbke @TheActualSophie @ReverendLars @BarryBahrami @KamalaHarris So if you are not pale, show up with a kid &amp; an advisor told you to claim asylum - no rules apply?  Just trying to understand how things should work.
@KamalaHarris Kamala,  did you call on Hillary to resign when she was directly responsible for the deaths of Americans in Benghazi and followed up with lies to the families of the deceased?  You are completely disengenious, a total fraud.
@VettingBernie @frodofied @HillaryClinton Deficit borrowing?  Tax &amp; spend is a Democrat practice that went unchecked in OBama admin. 4600 dead in Puerto Rico?  We all know what happened corruption led by Mayor of San Juan now under investigation. Hillary not likely eligible for office in 2020.
@VettingBernie @frodofied @HillaryClinton Too much absurdity to even address.  Gas costs?  Compare prices in 2014 to today.  I'd prefer $2.85 today to $3.50 then.  Healthcare costs?  For who?   Taxpayers?  Do you prefer socialized gov't run medical?  I don't.  Housing costs? Tell me about CA NY NJ Property taxes.
@GaleChristina @PAStewartFL @vannsmole @HillaryClinton She just boasted about collecting a donation of $150k in response to her latest outburst.
@JoyceRatsocatso @HillaryClinton Fooled once, shame on Hillary, you want to fooled again!  Shame on you.
@frodofied @HillaryClinton Moment of national crisis? Please get a hold of yourself.
@HillaryClinton So based on Clinton Foundation math, that is $142k for personal expenses and $8k to a friend in need.
@GaleChristina @vannsmole @PAStewartFL @HillaryClinton Start with number of insiders and opponents that died prematurely.   If death isn't enough explain why her emails are deleted or destroyed.  Explain how a Pakistani national was hired to provide IT services ?  No Americans qualified?Haiti? Foundation?
@GaleChristina @vannsmole @PAStewartFL @HillaryClinton I disagree.  She is afforded a voice by the MSM and therefore remains in politics.  Also there are many that would like the entire truth regarding her political activity to come to light including the large number of coincidences involving a large number of individuals.
@Cherriebelle409 @marshbean @JebBush @realDonaldTrump Really?  From where are they coming from that is life threatening?  And even if where they are coming from is not life threatening, the safest situation for them is where they are today.
@briancrano @JebBush @realDonaldTrump @SecNielsen On what basis do you make this claim?  To avoid being branded as a racist by the likes of you, we can only apply laws to people with fair skin?  For everyone else mayhem is permissible?

@HostageIn @brianstelter @TuckerCarlson It's all about your prospective.  You believe things that I don't.  We both need to be patient and hope that the entire truth comes out.  You think it ends badly for me.  I think it ends badly for Hollywood, FBI leadership, the Clintons, CNN and many others.
@ProudRepublica4 @MareLovesUSA_00 This is an old outdated list
@kathygriffin Another vulgar outburst from you.  Shocking.  You are a complete tool.  Consider taking a timeout to reevaluate yourself.  Try making a change.  You can't be any worse than you are now.
@LisaMei62 @dbongino It appears that the Strock family might have a long term relationship with Barry.  Not proven at this point, but if true, I wonder what type of cooperation can be expected?
@johnlegend Maybe when you show one ounce of concern over child abuse in Hollywood, or innocent people murdered by illegal aliens you would have a tinge of credibility.  But you don't, and therefore you are no more than a vulgar fraud.
@KokeReport @Truthseeker126 @SteveHiltonx @realDonaldTrump @NextRevFNC And why is that?  Sure Trump is obnoxious, but so was Barry, and no one comes close to Hillary.  Could it be that they have too much to lose?  Too many crimes against innocent people they are afraid will be exposed?
