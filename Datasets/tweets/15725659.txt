All of this is detailed in @itscaitlinhd's explosive article: https://t.co/VyF6L0pBoH
Meanwhile, cocaine seizures in the last 5 months already exceeded the total seized in the previous 12 months.
Based on intelligence gathered in Central America as well as patterns from previous years, the U.S. government projects the numbers of families traveling to the U.S. will increase in the months ahead.
More than 50,000 adults are currently detained in ICE custody, the highest number ever.
U.S. immigration authorities have enough space to detain about 3,000 members of migrant families, but more than 28,000 crossed the border in January.		Because ICE facilities across the country are full, ICE has begun releasing single adults into the country.
As of March 3rd, 237,327 migrants had been apprehended along the southwest border since the fiscal year began in October, a 97 percent increase from the previous year.
CBP said migrants are drawn to the U.S. by federal laws &amp; court rulings that do not allow them to be deported without lengthy processing, and that require detained migrant families to be released into the country after 20 days.
“We had never seen these kinds of numbers,” said Ruben Garcia, director of Annunciation House. He said that during one week in February, immigration authorities had released more than 3,600 migrants to his organization, the highest number in any single week ever.
In El Paso, a volunteer network temporarily houses migrants after they are released from custody. They've had to expand from 3 facilities last year to 20 facilities today, according to the NYT.
More than 90% of the new arrivals are from Guatemala, officials said. Many Guatemalan families are now boarding buses and reaching the southwest border in as little as 4 to 7 days. 		Who is paying for the buses?
BREAKING: America's southern border is at a "breaking point," according to @CBP, with more than 76,000 migrants crossed the border illegally in February, more than double the levels from the same period last year. https://t.co/VyF6L0pBoH

Let's consider the media meltdown that would occur if this was a Republican's record.
So Virginia Democrat Ralph Northam:		- admitted wearing blackface		- featured a KKK outfit in his yearbook		- went by the nickname "coonman"		- Left his black Democrat running mate off his campaign literature		- Refused to shake a black Republican's hand		That's a pattern. https://t.co/BaH8cYe8Zz
That's three easily debunkable false claims, all of which went completely unchallenged by Jake Tapper. Zero follow up questions.
McAuliffe told Tapper "I do not support that legislation, nor does Ralph."		This is a bizarre claim and obviously false. Governor Northam said on January 17 "I do support the REPEAL bill" introduced by Kathy Tran. It's on video. He's defended it repeatedly, including on WTOP. https://t.co/MAdWAmbHRE
McAuliffe told Tapper "it's life of the mother in the last trimester."		In fact, Virginia Democrats' legislation does not limit third trimester abortions to when the "life of the mother" is at stake.		It allows a healthy baby to be aborted for anything related to "mental health."
McAuliffe told Tapper "I think Ralph [Northam] misspoke on that."		In fact, Governor Northam said "I don’t have any regrets" about what he said in defense of infanticide on @WTOP. https://t.co/z4KTuxEhf5
No, Jake Tapper does not get kudos for asking former Governor Terry McAuliffe one question about current Governor Ralph Northam (D-VA) supporting infanticide.		Here's why: McAuliffe made several false claims and there was zero follow up from Tapper. https://t.co/aqLPMfPPbR

In addition to contacting your elected officials, it's also important to ask their campaign donors if they support their agenda of killing babies up until the moment of birth.
You can figure out who your Virginia House and Senate representatives are by entering your address here: https://t.co/IZt3odjlT0
My Virginia Delegate, Paul Krizek (D-District 44) will be hearing from me. He supported Tran's infanticide bill &amp; said Planned Parenthood was his favorite endorsement.		804-698-1044	703-688-2983	paul@paulkrizek.com	DelPKrizek@house.virginia.gov		571-265-3693	Thomas@PaulKrizek.com
Just a reminder: retweets do virtually nothing to stop the dismemberment of viable babies by the likes of Kathy Tran, Virginia Democrats &amp; NARAL. 		Angry Facebook posts do virtually nothing.		It takes real action. Phone calls. Emails. Money. Knocking. Running for office. VOTING.
-@KathyKLTran has deleted her social media accounts but you can still contact her &amp; her staff:		804-698-1042	703-828-7173	DelKTran@house.virginia.gov		703-622-2730	kathy@kathyfordelegate.com		rodrigo@kathyfordelegate.com	804-698-1042		noah@kathyfordelegate.com	703-424-8390
To be clear: special interest groups that support killing babies at any stage of pregnancy, up until the moment of birth, funded Kathy Tran's campaign. Once elected, she introduced legislation written by her donors to expand their opportunity to make money killing more babies.
Asked why it would be necessary to kill the baby rather than deliver it when the mental/physical health of the mother is the factor at the end of a pregnancy, NARAL's Galina Varchena didn't know but promised to find an article she saw on the internet once about a case in Ireland. https://t.co/KqPduTMFDq
It just so happens that when she couldn't answer questions about her bill, she turned to NARAL lawyer Galina Varchena to explain it! https://t.co/0xLSuCHHKU
Watching Tran struggle to understand &amp; defend her own bill, it seems likely it was written by an outside special interest group for her to introduce.		@NARALVirginia gave $1,000 to Tran's campaign. 	@PPAVirginia gave $1,500 plus did mail and GOTV	@emilyslist gave $2,000
Freshman Delegate Kathy Tran introduced the bill (HB 2491), but it was cosponsored by many other @VAHouseDems. 		20 others, to be exact—plus 2 more in the state senate. https://t.co/D5f3QcUXx6 https://t.co/3hNYEWX1Dr

Gee, I wonder what was happening in the federal government in January 2017? https://t.co/SjESN6JlPc
Thanks only to our loved one and TSA pre-check, we made it to our gate 10 minutes before boarding.		If I didn’t happen to have a spare family member in the house that night, all four of us would have missed our flight.		Bottom line: Don’t count on @Uber to schedule critical rides
This is deeply ironic:		@Uber’s website specifically touts the ability to schedule rides to the airport in advance so that “there’s no need to wake a loved one for that middle-of-the-night flight.” https://t.co/hOKdlpoNoH
Thankfully, it just so happened that a close relative is staying at our house temporarily because he just started a new job in the area. 		We wake him up at 5 AM and ask him to drive us to the airport so we won’t miss our flight.
I hit “cancel” in my app in hopes it will give me more info. Nope.		It’s going on 5 AM so I start loading luggage into my own car.
Funny thing is that Uber specifically advertises the benefits of scheduling a ride in advance with “5 AM flight? Have one less thing to worry about” https://t.co/is6YIEr0jS
It’s 4:45 AM, and Uber is still telling me it’s finding a driver. The only option in the app is to cancel the trip. There’s no way to call anyone. 		My wife checks her app for available drivers. It says there are none.
Around 4 AM I get a notification that my Uber is being fulfilled.		4:20 AM comes. No @Uber. Then 4:30. No Uber. App still says it’s finding a driver. I thought scheduling in advance meant this wasn’t left to chance?		Uber says if a driver can’t be found, you’ll be notified. Nope https://t.co/a4WeIqqtB8
Our flight was at 6 AM. The morning before, I scheduled an UberXL to pick us up at 4:20 AM to take us to the airport. Four adults, a baby with a car seat and stroller, and luggage. https://t.co/81CW3X269x
My parents celebrated their 35th anniversary recently, and to celebrate with them, we planned a special trip out of town. Thanks to @Uber, we almost missed our flight.

This is quite literally fake news. It does not reflect what actually happened, it was manufactured to advance a politically motivated narrative, and it spreads like a virus.
So were most members of the media. They breathlessly tweeted about it, mocking and attacking the president for something he did not say. Many reporters quoted the exchange selectively in order to present a false narrative. https://t.co/7jLqzw4L43
So why did Mason interject with this bizarre, unnecessary correction?		The most likely answer is that Mason resented that Trump took a dig at Obama—a dig that was 100% true.		Mason didn't like that his president had just been blasphemed. He was triggered. https://t.co/pM4AzjTkEN
And Trump makes it clear his point is that it occurred "during President Obama."		Mason obviously understands the distinction Trump is making because Mason follows with, "But it was President Putin who did the annexation."
This is a non sequitur. Trump did not say Obama annexed Crimea. He said Obama allowed Putin to take Crimea.		Does Mason not understand the difference? He obviously does.		Does Mason think Trump doesn't know Putin took Crimea? Of course not, he just heard Trump say exactly that.
Asked what he plans to say to Putin, Trump mentions a simple fact: "President Obama allowed a very large part of Ukraine to be taken"		This prompts Reuters' Jeff Mason to interject: "That was President Putin who annexed Crimea, sir." https://t.co/Rb7ZaK4MJj

@NoahCRothman @pkcapitol Totally agree
@NoahCRothman I think @pkcapitol tries to be a pretty fair reporter. I’m sure he will correct.
And that's the key. It is absolutely true that if Democrats regain power they will push for a Medicare-for-all-style system. Republicans are correctly pointing this out. Democrats' media allies know this is a potent issue, so they rush to Democrats' defense.
Axios: "... or any single-payer health care system. But most haven't drawn a hard line." https://t.co/6pjoi495CI
Axios: "Others say they support a pathway to Medicare for All, a Medicare option for all, or a Medicare buy-in. Some simply say they support a 'public option.' A handful of candidates have specifically said they do not support Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All bill ..."
Now here's Axios' @caitlinnowens today: "Most Democrats running in competitive House races are supporting or at least leaving the door open to some form of 'Medicare for All.' ... Some explicitly say they support 'Medicare for All.' ..."
So Politico calls Republicans' broad narrative about the direction of the Democrat party misleading, false, and deceptive, all in the same supposedly straight news article.
Politico: "The deceptive Medicare for All ads deride Democrats for supporting a 'government takeover of health care' and a massive tax increase, or wanting to 'end Medicare as we know it.'"
Politico: "In battleground districts … Democrats have gone out of their way to distance themselves from Sen. Bernie Sanders' $32 trillion single-payer proposal, only to be attacked for endorsing the plan anyway in Republican ads that range from misleading to outright false."
Politico's @adamcancryn 2 days ago: "The GOP is hammering Democratic challengers in swing districts over a [Medicare for all] plan putting the gov't in full control of the health care system…. There’s just 1 problem: Few of the targeted Democrats actually support such a plan."
Here's a great example of Democrats' allies in the media giving them cover on health care.

Grassley also says "in light of recently uncovered information," (!) he asks them to turn over "records and descriptions of direct or indirect communications between Dr. Ford or her representatives and any of the following: (1) U.S. Senators or their staffs …"
"I don't know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr. Ford's allegations in quite the way you have claimed."
New Grassley letter to Ford's lawyers, who are still refusing to turn over her therapist's notes, polygraph materials &amp; communications with the media: "if the evidence supported your client's allegations, you surely would produce it as quickly as you could. …"

@nataliemjb There's this person too https://t.co/bdqeArc24S		And the former employer who alleged Swetnick "engaged in unwelcome, sexually offensive conduct" &amp; "made false &amp; retaliatory allegations that other co-workers had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward her." https://t.co/iu3fhQ7Mrd
Reminder: All Democrats on the Judiciary Committee embarrassed themselves by citing Julie Swetnick's allegations in a letter the day her sworn statement was released. @maziehirono said Julie's was a "credible account." https://t.co/jTymti8SlO
Bottom line: @MichaelAvenatti is a creep who exploited a troubled woman for publicity.
"based on my direct experience with Julie, I do not believe her allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh.”
“Because I had lost Julie’s number I called her father to get it. When I talked to him about possibly bringing her on to help with my campaign, he told me that she had psychological and other problems at the time.”
“Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted, raped, gang-raped or having sex against her will. She never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity.”
“I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers. She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.”
Key excerpt: "During a conversation about our sexual preferences, things got derailed when Julie told me that she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time. In fact sometimes with several at one time. She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship."
This is explosive. @senjudiciary committee received a statement from a Democrat who knew Julie Swetnick in the 1990s. Here's his full statement: https://t.co/UkaSlQvdSD

Oh, and she's a sitting Supreme Court justice.
The obvious difference is that Kavanaugh has been falsely accused of some of the most heinous crimes and is defending himself, while RBG just couldn't resist attacking the Republican in an ongoing presidential election campaign.
Media is very upset Kavanaugh said the smear campaign against him is partially fueled by Democrats’ rage at losing the 2016 election. They now say he showed himself to be too partisan to sit on the bench.		The same people cheered RBG when she attacked Trump by name in July 2016.

Democrats Joe Donnelly (Indiana) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia) say they support Republicans' bill to keep the government open and fund children's health insurance for six years.
"Democrats will block the longest-ever extension of the CHIP program, because they believe it politically expedient to connect the DACA issue to the funding debate." https://t.co/YMMOziwow8
Democrats aren't just blocking government funding and children's health insurance... #SchumerShutdown https://t.co/xm84yP8egt
"Cassidy said that compromise with moderate Democrats will be difficult as long as their priorities are illegal immigration over CHIP and keeping the government open." https://t.co/rQWCh06nx7

Another example of Dick Durbin's claim about a private meeting being disputed.		2015: Durbin says Schumer promised to support Durbin remaining whip.		But Schumer's spokesman disputes Durbin's version of events: "That did not happen, and they know it." https://t.co/Bqas6XmLlI https://t.co/nQf1hJ6rR4
After all, Schumer and Durbin feuded over who would lead Senate Democrats when Harry Reid announced his retirement. https://t.co/Bqas6XmLlI https://t.co/Rd36rsSn3q
One has to wonder if Schumer is happy with Durbin for acting as a shadow minority leader and "encouraging his colleagues to join him in blocking spending legislation if the legal status of 'dreamers' isn't resolved.” https://t.co/4QjFZjeQQ4 https://t.co/FIvAoSCbhD

Chuck Schumer in 2013: “I believe in immigration reform. What if I persuaded my caucus to say, ‘I'm going to shut the government down, I am going to not pay our bills unless I get my way?’ It's a politics of idiocy, of confrontation, of paralysis.”

@neeratanden @samstein Neera you are mistaken. Clinton’s Benghazi emails were released by the State Dept in response to congressional subpoenas and reporters’ FOIA requests (and court orders) because they were official government records.
