Most impassioned testimony we’ve heard from a SCOTUS nominee.
Will Judge Kavanaugh call for FBI investigation and encourage Mark Judge to testify?
Grassley closes by saying, “Let’s just be nice to her."
Keep talking, Senator Grassley.
Grassley refers to Dr. Ford as “her” as if she were not present.
Why isn’t Mark Judge being called to testify?
Grassley is not exactly establishing an open, neutral atmosphere for this hearing.
