@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSherrodBrown There is a sprinkle of truth to what she is saying, but the broader point she is making is simply wrong. No one, especially politicians (including @SenSanders) is impervious to criticism. In case you didn‚Äôt see them, here are the rest of my thoughts: https://t.co/NCxVQ9PiJl
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSherrodBrown She‚Äôs, quite literally, smugly telling voters who don‚Äôt agree with her to leave the party. Then she wonders why she lost the easiest election is the modern history of the U.S.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSherrodBrown So what? @KamalaHarris and others are now impervious to criticism because they are minorities? With all due respect, this is what turns off many potential swing voters and independent voters who are not necessarily big fans of @realDonaldTrump.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSherrodBrown It‚Äôs quite frankly insulting and extremely condescending to be told by others that my well-founded concerns are invalid because they‚Äôre ‚Äúrooted in sexism and racism‚Äù. I‚Äôm Hispanic, so believe me, my concerns are not rooted in racism.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSherrodBrown I couldn‚Äôt disagree more with @HillaryClinton. While there are some folks who are launching racist and sexist attacks against @KamalaHarris, those who are attacking her from the left for policy-related issues are not doing so.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSherrodBrown Well, I respectfully disagree with your decision but, nevertheless, it‚Äôs YOUR decision and you get to exercise your right to vote however you want; and I have to respect that.

@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris Question: what has @KamalaHarris done?
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris Wrong. First and foremost, yes @SenSanders has well-documented holes, like every other politician in the planet. However his pros outweigh his cons. Secondly he has indeed done a lot in two years. In case you didn‚Äôt read them, here are my tweets explaining that: https://t.co/r7fOfJUxYf
@joe_rose_ @DivDougNation @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs also worth noting that he took the time to meet with them and apologize to them personally. I have yet to see @KamalaHarris‚Äôs apology. Plus, last I heard, @SenSanders didn‚Äôt settle. https://t.co/W8unnx9bqI
@joe_rose_ @DivDougNation @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris With regard to the latest vote, he simply missed it to meet with the victims of sexual misconduct in his campaign (not of him, by the way, as the corporate mainstream press likes to insinuate).
@joe_rose_ @DivDougNation @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris Most of the time, he harshly criticizes Russia and goes after them. This exchange between him and @RandPaul proves it. https://t.co/twwKJh93RH
@joe_rose_ @DivDougNation @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris Plus, it‚Äôs not like he nefariously voted against those sanctions. He probably just didn‚Äôt believe that they were consistent with his anti-escalation philosophy.
@joe_rose_ @DivDougNation @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris First and foremost, I do agree with you that he should have voted for those initial rounds of Russian sanctions. However, contrary to @KamalaHarris, his pros drastically outweigh his cons.
@DivDougNation @joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs also worth noting that he took the time to meet with them and apologize to them personally. I have yet to see @KamalaHarris‚Äôs apology. Plus, last I heard, @SenSanders didn‚Äôt settle. 	https://t.co/W8unnx9bqI

@DivDougNation @joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris First and foremost, I do agree with you that he should have voted for those initial rounds of Russian sanctions. However, contrary to @KamalaHarris, his pros drastically outweigh his cons.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke However, what is controversial are votes against mainstream Democratic orthodoxy that @BarackObama, who isn‚Äôt that progressive by today‚Äôs standards, championed. I don‚Äôt know if you saw my tweets addressing those votes, but if your didn‚Äôt, here they are: https://t.co/yPv9Wns2a7
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke Of course; I‚Äôm aware there will always be, at the very least, some very minimal agreement with @realDonaldTrump from time to time. However, we must examine each vote individually. Voting with him on addressing the Opioid crisis is not really controversial.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris However, if she happens to be the nominee I will gladly and fervently support her over @realDonaldTrump.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris If you have the options of more reliable progressives who have proven time and time again they‚Äôre willing to stand up, willing to fight and able to get results, with less questionable records with a few exceptions, I don‚Äôt see a reason to support @KamalaHarris.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris However, what I‚Äôm trying to argue is that @KamalaHarris is not a reliable progressive. She is not the progressive candidate you SHOULD support. There are probably going to be much better options like @SenSanders or even @SenSherrodBrown.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre not progressive. Plus, you vote for whoever you want. At the end of day, we live in a Democratic Republic and you make whatever decision you want in the voting booth.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke We‚Äôre talking about legislation vehemently opposed by the @BarackObama White House, which was not really that progressive by today‚Äôs standards.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke Additionally, we‚Äôre talking about vote which went against mainstream Democratic orthodoxy; votes which aided the fossil fuel industry, aided @GOP tax-cuts for the rich, aided Wall Stree deregulation and chipped away at the Affordable Care Act.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @BetoORourke Yeah man, because it‚Äôs so hard to not cave to Republicans when representing the 16th District/El Paso (one of the most Democratic districts in the state).
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sticking by him, because he has given me a reason to. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm a ‚Äúblind cult follower‚Äù nor an ignorant ‚ÄúBernie Bro‚Äù. He has demonstrated that he will always fight for us and does possess the ability to produce important results.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris @SenSanders‚Äôs on the other hand, successfully pressured @amazon and @Disney to raise to minimum wage of their employees and successfully spearheaded the bipartisan Yemen Resolution under total and complete Republican-control of Congress.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris That alone does not distinguish @KamalaHarris or @amyklobuchar from other candidates nor does it give me a reason to vote for them.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but, at the end of the day, you have to look at the big picture. Grilling Trump cabinet and Supreme Court nominees should be a given for any Democratic Senator, much less a potential Presidential candidate.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris And hey, it would also be fair to point out the holes in my preferred candidate‚Äôs ‚Äî @SenSanders‚Äôs record .
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris However, it‚Äôs primary season. Everything is fair game. Primaries are meant to be an opportunity for voters to properly vet all candidates, in order to make sure the best overall candidate comes out on top. It‚Äôs entirely fair for me to point out the inconsistencies in her record.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris I never once said I wouldn‚Äôt vote for the eventual Democratic nominee. In fact, I will, no matter who he or she is, because @realDonaldTrump is that much a danger to the planet and our Republic.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris So far, I‚Äôve seen no proof that @KamalaHarris can ‚Äúmake progress‚Äù in the face of inevitable and strong opposition. How do I know she will not cave? Do enlighten me if I‚Äôm missing something.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris A ‚Äúprogressive champion‚Äù is someone who will both advocate for and fight like hell to implement the policies you listed.
@DivDougNation @joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris Which ‚Äúissues‚Äù are you talking about?
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris Believe me, I know the truth stings. For example, I used to believe @BetoORourke was a progressive champion who would be a worthy successor to @SenSanders, until I learned the truth about his voting record. The truth is not always pleasant. However, nevertheless, it‚Äôs the truth.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris After reading my tweets summarizing her more than questionable record, how can you seriously argue that @KamalaHarris is a progressive champion? In all honestly, I‚Äôm curious.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris ‚Ä¢ Has begged Wall Street, behind the scenes, for campaign donations in preparation for her 2020 bid for the Democratic nomination.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris ‚Ä¢ Championing state legislation under which parents whose children were found to be habitually truant in elementary school could be prosecuted, despite concerns that it would disproportionately affect low-income people of color.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris ‚Ä¢ Fighting to keep an innocent man in jail, even after a federal judge has ruled on the opposite.		‚Ä¢ Advocating for civil asset forfeiture, which literally allows prosecutors to seize assets before initiating criminal proceedings.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris ‚Ä¢ Laughing at the idea of legalizing recreational marijuana use in 2014, when it already had started to become mainstream Democratic Party orthodoxy.		‚Ä¢ Defending solitary confinement (which many expert psychologists describe as torture). 		‚Ä¢ Defending the ‚ÄúThree-Strikes Law‚Äù.
@joe_rose_ @Monstermash042 @thehill @SenSanders @KamalaHarris ‚Ä¢ Failing to prosecute future Trump administration Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for his obvious crimes, and then being the only Democratic candidate in 2016 to happily accept a $2,000,000 donation from him.
