UPDATED: For posting on Facebook, South Beach Realtor who extorted ‚ÄòThe Jills‚Äô sentenced to 364 days in jail https://t.co/lZiZ3xIeLR
BREAKING: Judge Hirsch sentences Kevin Tomlinson to 364 days in jail after violating probation for extorting The Jills, the high-end South Beach realtor duo. 		Judge says he would have imposed more had state asked for more.
Judge Hirsch seems befuddled that state is only asking for 6 months in jail for Tomlinson. Defendant is apologizing to the court, saying he was hooked on benzos and wracked with anxiety and psych issues.
Tomlinson admits he was posting on Facebook about The Jills, but is trying to differentiate between posting about his extortion case and their "data fraud."
Tomlinson also admits he went to Einstein's bagels to get a cranberry juice, despite having to remain at home. "I was having a diabetic attack. I woke up in a full sweat. I've only had two of those episodes. They‚Äôre life threatening."
Tomlinson himself now being called the the stand. He's already weepy. 	"I was in a very emotional moment at that point" when he posted on Facebook after his sentencing
Judge had forbid Tomlinson from posting on social media about the Jills. State believes he violated by reposting the story, then proclaiming his innocence on the comments and saying of the Jills "those smiles will be wiped off their greedy faces."
LOL here's the Vanity Fair line:  "Judge Milton Hirsch begins his sentencing with a quote from Othello. ‚ÄúWho steals my purse steals trash,‚Äù he recites. ‚ÄúBut who filches from me my good name, robs me of that which enriches him, and makes me poor indeed.‚Äù
Now onto Facebook posts. Tomlinson re-posted the Vanity Fair article on the case, which sparked a Facebook discussion. Judge Hirsch, as a joking aside, says his quoting Shakespeare was wrong in the story. "They misquoted Shakespeare."
Here's link to Third DCA's 3-page opinion https://t.co/DOAcIAXNk9
BREAKING: Appeals court just ruled Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Mark Blumstein must seat 12, not six, jurors in first-degree murder case against man accused of killing his wife and her bro. Background https://t.co/gfuJb4V9vg
GPS immediately showed Tomlinson left his home for less than 30 minutes. When probation called, "he advised he left the house bc he was hungry and had nothing to eat."
State probation officer on witness stand to talk about Tomlinson failing to be in his home when he was supposed to be. Tomlinson seemed pretty emotional before court. Could be facing some serious jail or prison time

Leary plied the girl with vodka ‚Äî the first time she had ever drank liquor ‚Äî then began creepily clipping her toenails. Then, he forced himself on her. Later that night, after she threw up, he lectured ‚Äúforever on the Book of Leviticus.‚Äù
As far back as 2006, the FBI received a cyber tip about risque photos of child models on Leary‚Äôs website. An acquaintance reported that Leary seemed ‚Äúto be intimate‚Äù with numerous foreign exchange students ‚Äî but a police investigation in 2013 found no evidence of a crime.
Leary began taking his exchange student to the Rooftop Resort, a Hollywood hotel that caters to nudists and swingers. Over at least two years, Leary made her have sex with ‚Äúmultiple men at once‚Äù while he filmed, and sometimes joined in.

Also, in case you didn't see the pictures, Estache was not naked in court. He had his jail jumpsuit on under his dress clothes. But defendants don't generally want to be seen in jail clothes in front of the jury
BTW, Estache was acting (or pretending to act) loopy earlier in the day. Shrink talked to him, said he was competent and suggested he was malingering. Judge is gonna allow him to testify, which is his right.
Now, Estache suddenly wants to testify, even though he said no earlier. Estache's lawyer, Jeffrey Fink, is not happy. "I wouldn't know what to ask him." Estache is insisting on testifying. "He is NOT going to take the stand," his lawyer said.
He dropped his sweater and trousers on ground next to him. Courtroom stunned. Judge Venzer not happy at all, says he's trying to delay trial. "Felt like changing," Estache said. https://t.co/tFXtRmo9oo

The 24-year-old woman who was stalked for years by Zhang gets really emotional, about how her medical school experience has been shattered, left her never feeling safe. "It's ruined my life." 		She looked over at Zhang. "I wish I never fucking met you."
One of the victims says of her photos on fetish site: "It's disgusting. The fact that someone took this picture of me and put it on a pornographic website, the fact that's been viewed so many times, it's degrading to my reputation as a woman."
"I don't know what he's capable of," she says when talking about how she was one of the leaders of the victims who helped get him expelled from UM. https://t.co/6snGkj10VR
One of the victims, tearfully, recalls being alerted to her photos on the fetish websites. "I felt violated. I felt harassed. I felt targeted. There were pictures of me with my fill name on my white coat where I go to school every day."
Two of the students testified that they reported his obsession with one girl directly to one of the deans at the Miller School of Medince, more than a year before the photos were discovered on fetish websites https://t.co/GqMJjcCBkc
We're still in session. A lot of UM med students testifying about Zhang's obsession with one of the young women. She and the other victim will testify now, to talk about the disturbing stalking that shattered their lives
In all, Alex Zhang, through his lawyer, pleaded the fifth exactly 55 times when asked about fetish websites and stalking of fellow Univ. of Miami med school classmates

Zhang's lawyer pointing out that the women themselves posted the photos on social media. Somebody - presumably, Zhang - reposted them on the fetish sites. That's what makes this case tough to charge criminally
So far, Alex Zhang - through his attorney - has pleaded his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 20 times. And counting.
