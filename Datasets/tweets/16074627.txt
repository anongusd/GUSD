@PiskettiMonster Good point
Who do you believe incites people to commit violent acts more (we‚Äôre not talking about anger, but actual violence)? Please give evidence if possible.
If depression is anger turned inward, could anger be fear turned outward? As in fear/anticipation of retaliation by perceived enemies for your hatred of them that you preemptively attack with your anger.

When any of you have felt suicidal, was it connected to feeling that something in your future was taken away plus when you reached inside to feel the strength to make it through, you came up empty or worse, came up with self-recriminations because of a lousy childhood?
