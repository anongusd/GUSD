@PatrickWDoyle3 @marklevinshow Well, Democrats are not the only ones getting a free ride with bigoted views. How about our president targeting Mexicans and other Central Americans? How many Republicans clapped for him? Let‚Äôs not be selective in our opprobrium. Bigotry is bigotry and should all be condemned
@marklevinshow Mark Levin, why are you harassing this woman who is young enough to be your daughter with your hateful, trolling propaganda? You accuse her of anti-Semitism and yet you have demonstrated an obsession with equally hateful anti-Muslim bigotry. Think about it.
@donnied_oyyy @marklevinshow Nope, just as racism in all forms should be condemned. You cannot show your love for one group of people by demonizing  other people. That is stupid. The way some of you talk, it seems like you will only be appeased if Ms Omar were executed. Abhorrent idiocy.

@marklevinshow You are in fine form today, Mark. Advocating for people to be fired from Congress and begging white nationalists to sue people just because they exercise their first amendment rights? So all your talk about respect for the constitution is just hit sir and BS?
@marklevinshow But no one ever asked for you to be fired after broadcasting decades of bigotry on radio and TV. What you are doing is directing unfettered religious bigotry against Congresswoman Omar because of her religion. Please stop this propaganda against the young woman.
@realDonaldTrump And the president says all this with a straight face.
@marklevinshow Much ado about nothing. Even Israelis who have listened to what the Congresswoman said are not asking for head as some of our hypocritical politicians here are. If she had openly insulted Palestinians, I bet you no one would be screaming for her to be guillotined.
@marklevinshow Nice, but just after you resign for your hostile anti-Mexican rhetoric.

@FiveRights This is a losing proposition for you guys of the right. We are never gonna build a wall around the US. That figment of your imagination will only froth and ferment in right wing brains. The 18th Century with its drawbridges and moats is in our rear window.
@LindseyGrahamSC Didn‚Äôt you once brand yourself as a strict conservative constitutionalist? Oh Lindsay, how thou foldeth so easily like a cheap South Carolina camera. Tsk, tsk. Personally, I think you‚Äôre too old to play Trump‚Äôs ardent lapdog, but hey.....
@mitchellvii Wow. I like your attitude. Maybe we should build a wall all around the perimeter of the United States: A big, fat wall greater than the Great Wall of China. C‚Äômon, right wingers, you can do this!
@marklevinshow Stop using Israel to divide us. The United States stands solidly behind Israel and you know it. And FYI, you can still stand with Israel and still call out Netanyahu‚Äôs radical rightwing policies and his partisan card-carrying embrace of the Republican Party.
@marklevinshow You are losing it.
@DineshDSouza @realDonaldTrump Trump and Republicans have so thoroughly overplayed themselves with lies that we are now inured. They will never manipulate us again with lies and their toxic ideology to vote for them. Bye bye Repub Senate and WH In 2020.

@marklevinshow You are incorrigible, my friend. If you don‚Äôt want the media to fact-check the president, tell him to tell no lies. Simple.
@marklevinshow And where do you and the militant right press take their cue from Mr Levin?
@marklevinshow Cheney protected the nation? How? He engineered the Iraq war using dodgy intelligence about weapons of mass destruction that, together with the Afghanistan war, has cost our country trillions of dollars and killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. The mayhem continues even now.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MarshaBlackburn Keep hallucinating, Marsha. Trump changes his mind so often that I won‚Äôt be surprised if he wakes up tomorrow morning and gets bored with walls, moats and drawbridges on the southern border, and opts decides that playing Uno with Kim Jong-un is much more fun.
@SarahPalinUSA I know that you, Ann Coulter, Limbaugh, Hannity, Mark Levin and other ghoulish creatures of the nightmarish right are praying earnestly for her to die so that your pliable president can take the courts back to the 19th Century.

@marklevinshow The last resort of scoundrels: demonizing progressive opponents as antisemites. Levin, you and the Republican wingnuts have forever trotted out that canard to scuttle discourse and intimidate opponents whenever you start losing an argument. Stop the hate and propaganda already

@GOPChairwoman @ALWAYSPsalm91 So you guys have given up on Mexico ponying up the wall money? Lol.
@GOP @ALWAYSPsalm91 $5 billion
@GOP @ALWAYSPsalm91 Take the $5 million out of the $1.5 trillion tax break that you Republicans gifted the corporations and super wealthy and pay for your precious wall. Better still, make Mexico pay for it as the president bragged during the 2016 campaign. Just stop bothering us.

@DineshDSouza The answer to all of those questions is the Trump Republican Party,although they will never be candid about it even if their lives depend on it.
@realDonaldTrump Your poor mind meanders too effortlessly between reality and fantasy.

@realDonaldTrump @klralms 5 billion dollars
@realDonaldTrump @klralms Mr President, why don‚Äôt you just claw back the $5 dollars from the $1.5 trillion you gave the rich in your tax cut? That will  help build the wall and also oorn up the government.

@mousemama828 @senatemajldr @POTUS Well then, he sure didn‚Äôt explain that to us during the campaign. He was saying that the wall was not going to cost taxpayers a dime; that Mexico is gonna pay 100% for the wall with absolute conviction. For him to hold the US govt hostage now after Mex said no is irresponsible.
@senatemajldr @POTUS For all those wall maniacs out there, why don‚Äôt you go out and demand that Mexico builds it, as President Trump was demanding during the election campaign?
@_realBlackTrump @stephphilip8 You got billions....and a red tie/golf course, tower, model wife and obnoxious, serpentine, conniving kids and son-in-law?
@MJGerson @AnaSolitaria7 It goes deeper. The possibility of him starting a nuclear war- with no input or consultation with Congress- is now within the realm of possibilities. He‚Äôs not going to nuke folks willfully. He will do so because, despite the evidence, nobody is advising him to go see a shrink.
@DineshDSouza You guys keep advocating for the nuclear option in all things big and small. The Dems did it for Obamacare and lower judges. The Repubs escalated it to the Supreme Court and Cabinet appts. If you go nuclear on the wall, it will be one party rule in DC soon with Dems in the wings.

@DogDays86659126 @marklevinshow Yep, I am. And I muscularly and clinically submit that Mark Levin is a village idiot. If Trump pushes the nuclear button today and vaporizes a city of millions, his ilk would enthusiastically clap for him. Village idiot  syndrome is real, my friend.

I never knew mustaches could be so dangerous		Yes, John Bolton Really Is That Dangerous https://t.co/m8dpPxYlYQ
@realDonaldTrump Cynicism on steroids, lol!
Good Reverend, standing in Jesus's truth and glory, are you still proud of your endorsement of Donald Trump?
@thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump But why hold the country hostage over a wall that Mexico is supposed to pay for, hmmm, hmmm?
@ScarletAvengers It's not even Iran that he is thinking of right now. After Iran and NK, he wants war with Russia. All those who were screaming "MAGA" with purplish cheeks at Trump's rallies, how do you sleep at night?
@ericbolling But are you aware that Trump, Kush, the Fox pond-are the swamp?
@realDonaldTrump Crocodile tears for DACA recipients. Nobody is buying it, except maybe Bannon's nationalists and your amen corner at Fox.
@goodoldcatchy Am i the only one who notices that John Bolton's mustache is thicker and grayer than Hitler's?
@realDonaldTrump This will teach all those Republicans who lick your boots. Throw them under the bus, i say!
@VP @POTUS Open the holy book tonight and read it like you‚Äôve never read it before.
@timkaine @rvantilburg @WSJ I hope all those who voted for Trump sleep soundly at night.
@cnni @ResistingLib This Saudi Prince must be really powerful.  He hated Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is gone. He hated McMaster, wants a hawk as NSA. McMaster is gone and Bolton, who wants to annihilate N Korea and Iran with nukes is in.
@realDonaldTrump @AmbJohnBolton You, sir, have gone off the deep end!
@mkraju @JayelBebop Not interested in Senator Collins crocodile tears. We told her what‚Äôs up, but she listened to McConnell‚Äôs lying words.
@GovMikeHuckabee Why are you so mad? Trump just signaled to the whole world that he‚Äôs getting ready to blow up Iran and NKorea with nuclear bombs by appointing John Bolton. Is that not one of the things you‚Äôve always  wished for? You should be dancing for joy!
@CheriJacobus @rvantilburg Am I surprised? This loathsome man gives lapdogs a bad name.
@porpentina2017 @MamaMolly2018 If you like crazy, you will LOVE John Bolton. Kiss your spouse and kids goodbye. This wing nut is going to convince Crazy Trump to start a nuclear war, retaliation be damned.
@RedTRaccoon Bolton is in. Nuclear war with Iran and North Korea is in.

@TheJordanRachel @uniuniman53 And I just know that Trump and Republicans NEVER LIE! Congratulations. üòÇüòÇ
@JacobAWohl @thebradfordfile Were you there when Trump was kissing her toes? Go take a nap.
@SenatorCollins If you had stood your ground, this mess would not have come to pass. But you listened to the honeyed words of McConnell, and now your hallowed place in the political hall of fame has been vandalized. You should never have capitulated ma‚Äôam.
@ChristiChat @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump ‚ÄúThey will raise your taxes!‚Äù...The propaganda mantra with which the Republicans have terrified very poor people in red states to vote against their interests. Next Dem congress and prez will cancel 1.5 trillion tax giveaway to the rich and parcel it to the middle class and poor.
@ChristiChat @thebradfordfile @realDonaldTrump Wow, folks like are dragging the Republican party by the neck to the precipice of the far, hard, radical right. ANARCHY!

@DVATW You guys really hate Muslims, don‚Äôt you?
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Gotta run, my friend. We will catch up again soon. You‚Äôre a good man. Cheers.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Those were some of the best years of my life. When Hillary lost to Trump, I was like, what happened? Tough, man. I got over it and accepted that he is my president and wished him well. I thought he will be a good president, better than his campaign bluster. I was wrong. Sad. Smh.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Enjoy it while it lasts. I will still enjoying mine after we take the House and Senate in November and begin to annoy a very furious Trump. Can you imagine vegetarian Twit storms he‚Äôs gonna unleash? Priceless!
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Me second
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Lol. You are badüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Keith can you imagine the priceless thrills the country will fell when the new president will hold a press conference and reverse Trump‚Äôs executive orders, one by one? Lol. He will be so annoyed, he will smash a window at Trump Tower with a golf club.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne I wonder who the next Democratic President will be. Hmmm.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne No no. Russia will do that. It‚Äôs just funny how he called himself David Dannielson to bag Stormy Davis. I guess politics and sex do make strange partners. One thing I like abt him though is he is a very virile man. Hehe.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne After the 2020 election, I will be laughing lastüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Lol
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne 7 years? Teehehe. 2020 and that‚Äôs it. A one term president. Even the red states are gonna run away from him. Hey, what‚Äôs up with this Stormy Davies business?
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Alan Dershowitz used to be the man, but old age has slowed him down a bit and he spouts nonsense nowadays. Even if Trump is exonerated by Mueller, which is  possible, just seeing him rant on Twitter makes me smile üòä
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne The only collusion is the one Trump and his fans don‚Äôt want to hear about. Let Hillary enjoy his retirement. Trump will not be impeached, I guess. But he will certainly not get that second term. He will have more time for golf.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Ah, the old divide and conquer. Not all the fbi is bad; just the top rotters. Lol. No Keith, this willl not work. The FBI knows that Trump is bashing all of them. Coup? That talking point doesn‚Äôt cut it either. I think Trump is scared of Comey and others.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne No correlation. I was responding to two different posts from you.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne I bet you one day Wayne is gonna wake up and say, we have the right to own drones and tanks for good marksmanship. Give them 10 more years
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Think Keith Keith! Do you think it is a good idea to go after the preeminent law enforcement agency in the world? Trump can never whip the FBI. Those guys have the goods on Trump. McCabe, like Comey took a lot of notesüòÇüòÇ
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne I mean Harmon Carter. He was even more extreme than Wayne LaPierre.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne 5 million NRA members probably mean well. Unfortunately, ever since the hardliners took control of that organization with Harlingen Carter in full control, it‚Äôs been no compromise on guns, even after shocking tragedies. Not good.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne I‚Äôm not either, but it‚Äôs them or the slammer. You see Trump furiously running to secure some? Haha.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne He doesn‚Äôt need the NRA to defend him. He only needs a good defense lawyer to convince a judge that his bombing is covered by the 2A. The law of inintended consequences, my friend.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne I know it doesn‚Äôt, but it‚Äôs only a matter of time before some smart aleck lawyer claims the 2A covers the right to bear bombs.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne I agree.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Well then, it‚Äôs gonna be a mad, mad, mad world from here to eternity. Now  some criminals have extended the 2A to bombs. Just wait and see when they catch the Austin bomber. His lawyer is going to defend his criminality on the #2A. Just watch.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Will not even try to defend that. But don‚Äôt you agree that the lax laws on guns that are supported by the gun lobby inadvertently allow criminals to also have access to those guns? There‚Äôs gotta be a better way.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Nobody wants to take your gun away. You have a right to your gun, but the position advocated by gun hardliners that any restriction on gun should never happen is crazy. It also causes bad dudes and dudettes to cop those guns and fire away. We call that anarchy!
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne There are very, very, very bad people in the world who rape and murder and do other horrific things. But can you also accept that because of the horrific violence guns unleash, their irresponsible access, advocated by gun fanatics, is superbad?
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne The law can‚Äôt get the guns away because the gun hardliners twist and bribe legislators in every state and county and the Fed to sabotage and water down real gun legislation. Then they fool the public with their field tested slogans.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Ah, that mantra again: guns are good but people and cars- and apple pies- are bad. There was a time when the NRA was a responsible organization. It all changed after that fanatic, Harmon Carter, took over the NRA in the 70s.
@thehill Yep, he also assured you that Vladimir didn‚Äôt really invade Crimea. Crimea asked him most kindly to be reunited with Mother Russia.
@ktimmons541 @RepByrne @POTUS Lol Keith, please don‚Äôt become a proponent of voodoo economics. Besides, what little tax break the poor gets, sunsets after a few years. Whereas the tax corporate breaks are permanent.
@ktimmons541 @DLoesch @Petite0ne Keith, this is a myth that is perpetrated by gun lovers. Gun or no gun, when a government unleashes its army on its citizenry, not even the beloved bump stocked AR-15 can stop the mayhem.

@DLoesch @Petite0ne Why is it that every NRA gun anarchist professes his love for family and God? Don‚Äôt they understand that the omnipresent guns that they promote blow away some 20,000 people a year in a most ungodly way, and devastate families forever?

@DineshDSouza Dinesh,  your reasoning is based on a fallacious assumption. You are denying that some billionaires get an unfair tax advantage, like the 1.5 trill giveaway by Trump that will balloon to about 7 T in a decade. You support corporate welfare but sniff at help for the poor, Not nice
@FiveRights 1. Obsessive hostility and butchery of healthcare protection for the poor to give a trillion tax giveaway to millionaires and billionaires	2) Regs that protect consumers- and those put in place to guard against future economic collapse- torn down.	3) Many, many more later..
@FiveRights We don't hate Trump. We are just mildly nauseated that he worked hand in glove with Comrade Putin and Cambridge Analytica to steal the presidency at gunpoint.
@MaryLyn00719971 @ktimmons541 @prayingmedic @MaryLyn00719971, we will invite you to the Blue Wave party after we finally liberate our country from the retrogressive Repubs and their erratic  leader. Please show up for the shindig.

@barbcast60 @krassenstein I wonder the same and weep for my country. Let's just make stormy Davies First Lady and be done with.
@PunishedRoadboy Pinochet? Ah. Well, we do not have comparable monsters on the left. And do not even try to dump Mao and Stalin on us. They may have fronted communist states, but they were aright-wing totalitarian despots (no oxymoron intended).

@DineshDSouza @Debber66 Congrats sir!
@PunishedRoadboy @sh_irredeemable @FiveRights You seem to have an archaic definition of fascist. We have redefined it in the Trump era, to the chagrin of Right-wing nutters who think it is a malapropism.	Fascist=right-wing nutter who hates liberals and hugs Russians, and who wants tanks , guns and big gov in a woman's womb.
@PunishedRoadboy @sh_irredeemable @FiveRights Really? The American right likes free speech and y'all been chanting with Trump the 'fake news' vilification of the media?

@sh_irredeemable So is Rush Limbugh, Sean Crapnity, Michael Savage and Mark Levin the military? Don't soil that great institution with the right wing, white nationalist garbage these people spew every day.
@PunishedRoadboy @sh_irredeemable @FiveRights Yep, they are fascists. Spewing empty slogans without fidelity to liberty while spreading hate and propaganda against the most vulnerable in society is classic fascism. You guys have done a paradigm shift. No parsing here, the obdurate American rightwing is fascist at its core.
@realDonaldTrump Shaddap!
@sh_irredeemable @FiveRights Free your mind from the clutches of right-wing fascist talk radio. Then maybe there is hope. Hannity and Rush Limbaugh are the worst scumbags when it comes to spreading fake news and nationalist anarchy.
@DineshDSouza @HillaryClinton Why don't you go and bite her? Are you hoping to cash in on the bitterness you are sowing? Go Hillary!
@KatTheHammer1 @TGowdySC When Gowdy was making oppositional voices against Trump about the possibility of firing Mueller. I said it wouldn't be long before he folds like a cheap umbrella in a Nor'Easter. Less than 24 hours, here he is walking back his comments on the sly, Woodshed!
@WalshFreedom Better bellow that one out. The man in the Oval office clearly thinks he is entitled to do whatever the heck he wants and go scot free.
@4everNeverTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @JimCarrey @PressSec What faith? Leave Jim Carrey alone. He is just pointing out that the WH Press Sec's protestation of faith is at variance with her defense of outright lies. You, Gov Huckabee, on the other hand have made a career of igniting religious hatred in the Middle East and slamming Islam.
@FiveRights You got it wrong sir. Let me paraphrase you. The biggest scumbags in Washington are those who are defending the ultra-corrupt Donald Trump since the weekend.	The aggressive shills at Fox News, cowardly Republican leaders, @FiveRights, Putin and the Russians. right-wing bloggers.
@FoxNews @seanhannity Why don't we call Sean Hannity what he really is? A pompous right-wing buffoon who hates women's advancement, minority rights, and supports the establishment of a right-wing oligarchy despite his protestations of defending liberty?
@BuckSexton @klralms Trump derangement syndrome-very catchy rightwing bumper sticker.

@EloiseStella @marcorubio Couldn‚Äôt have said it better @EloiseStella. This is part of the NRA playbook after every mass shooting. First they feign sympathy, then attack others. They also claim that laws already on the books are not enforced, even as they fight to weaken gun laws that could stop tragedies.

@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Lol!
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Had to pull over to respond. Nope, the NRA is not a terrorist organization, nor do I feel that way. I just believe that its absurd position on gun is crazy and unhelpful. As soon as I get back, I will respond to your tweets. üòéüòéüòé
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch I‚Äôm off to a bash. Nice interacting with you. I will be back. And I will read what you recommended. Cheers and have a wonderful Saturday.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch What rights are you talking about? Care to elaborate m?
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Okay my good man, Godspeed.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch I do understand the difference. But don‚Äôt you think the antagonists around the gun issue can do something about this if the NRA just relents a bit and engages in a lil give and take? But the maximalist position....
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch @ACLU I think homicides are lower in those countries than in the USA.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch A tremendous amount of good, I agree, but the bad- oh the bad- outweighs the good. Until the NRA and Wayne LaPierre show a more humane understanding of the horror that mass killings take on folks, instead of fundraising off them, the verdict is negative, I‚Äôm afraid.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Nope, I just don‚Äôt buy that their efforts are all altruistic. I read the pro and con and arrive at an informed decision. The NRA‚Äôs obdurate refusal to entertain any meaningful change in gun laws will only energize the growing opposition to its stance, gun horror after gun horror.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch @ACLU You are comparing a semiauto with a butter knife? üòÇüòÇüòÇ The mayhem of guns is incomparably horrific
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Well, suppose the gang members also claim that their 2A is being trampled? That the too are just oh so in love with the gun? Purely rhetorical of course, but it just tells you the thicket out there.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Nope, no emotion and ignorance in my reasoning. I have extensively read the literature and parsed through the blood soaked statistics. I‚Äôm as cool as ice in my commentaryüòÇüòÇ
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch I promise to read it. I think it is important to see what makes the other side tick üòÄ
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch @ACLU Nah!	You cannot absolve the gun. Nice tryüòé
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Oh my friend, already using the F word? Regardless, I still believe that you are a great debater and polemic. I may not eloquently have a rhetorical answer for your query, but you have my respect. I salute you. Now put on your debating hat and let it rip. Cheers.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Do you really believe that, in lieu of current and past horrific massacres, any restriction on any kind of gun is an infringement of the Second Amendment? I really don‚Äôt think so sir.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch I promise to do so, Josh. I will delve into it tonight and tomorrow. But I also hope that you will try putting yourself in the other camp‚Äôs shoes. Understand that commonsense legislation on guns, in light of the recent mass killings, is not necessarily an infringement on the 2A.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch @ACLU WTTF, when a tragedy occurs, I just don‚Äôt look at the tip of the iceberg, but at the underlying mistakes. But we cannot continue to stick our heads in the sand and cluck that guns are good. It is the person that pulls the trigger that is to blame.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch No Josh, the tragedies are not meant to guilt shame anyone. These are tragic realities that are forever etched in our national conscience. The shame of Sandy Hook, apart from the horror itself, is the cold hearted fundraising and political agency that the NRA engaged in.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch ...face of mass gun slaughter is an absolute political PR disaster that will only breed a more adamant determination in future generations to legislate soberness into this lunacy before some folks begin agitating for the right to amass tanks and mortars.
@WhiteJoshuaL @RichardRSmithJr @ogoreoloco @DLoesch I will not repudiate everything that the NRA stands for. They have fought the good fight to make a constitutional right sacrosanct. I do understand that rights will just be ink on paper if good people do t stand up and defend them. But saying that NOTHING should be done in the
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch In my opinion, the long term threat to the 2A is not from fellas like me who advocate truly enforceable commonsense legislation, but from those who wouldn‚Äôt entertain any restriction at all. Such a position, especially after Sandy Hook and Parkland is a PR disaster for gun lobby.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Correction: Sandy Hook, not Dandy Hook.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch Nice sentiment WTTF, but the reality is that the NRA has doubled down on a maximalist position that any legislation to restrict gun access, no matter how benign and sensible, is an existential threat to the 2A. Even after Dandy Hook, they hunkered down. This is untenable.

@nytimes As usual, the complicit Republican Party will fall over on itself as it jostled to clap for Trump. Jeff Sessions must really want to keep his job.
@DVATW Tell your creepy and nationalist goons to stop knifing folks and throwing acid around just so you can blame it on the fine mayor of London.
@MarkBraithwait7 @CromwellStuff Brexit has proved to be an outrageously idiotic idea. It will make Britain a Third World country that will be kicked out of the Security Council and replaced by Germany. Much respect to Ms. Sturgeon.
@RawStory @mightymykey1 He will win his appeal against this erratic president
@rdbknighttempla @klralms @PrisonPlanet @OwenMeeny @gmbutts Justin is the greatest PM Canada has had in the past 30 years. You ingrates, if you don‚Äôt want him, exchange him for Trump and see how a real village idiot behaves. Go Justin!
@realDonaldTrump @SebGorka This is another sick authoritarian move wage war and undermine the institutions that underpin our democracy. Try as you may, this country is not, and will not be, a banana republic under the sway of a strongman.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @ogoreoloco @DLoesch It‚Äôs Ok. It happens in the heat of debate. Abt the liberal bit though, I wear the badge with honor- though not to take away your 2A, but to expostulate about the uninhibited access to guns. I don‚Äôt think guns everywhere for virtually everybody, every circumstance, is healthy.
@ogoreoloco @RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @DLoesch CROOKED PRESIDENT!!
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @DLoesch Shouldn‚Äôt you be cutting a happy jig on the dance floor? Attorney General Jeff Sessions, with the egging of Trump, fired former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe two days before his retirement. Vindictively taking away a man‚Äôs pension for political reasons is malicious and petty.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @DLoesch I‚Äôm beginning to take a shine to you, even though some of your views are rough around the edges. If you just pinch your face to expand your world view a bit, you could just be the kind of chap a fellow can down a drink with. Just keep the raccoon meat off the dinner table üòé
@DrDenaGrayson @CIA @StevenLHall1 Well, we too had an election, didn‚Äôt we? But what happened? Some folks connived to make our votes useless.
@RichardRSmithJr @WhiteJoshuaL @DLoesch Another xenophobic distortion of history. Oh dearie me!
@RichardRSmithJr @DLoesch Lol, you are incorrigible. So because I  said I speak the Queen‚Äôs English, that makes me a Brit? OK then. I refuse to have a logomachy with you. Tata.
@RichardRSmithJr @DLoesch Please read for profit (and that is a figure of speech) and come back.
@RichardRSmithJr @DLoesch Oh you poor puffed-up toad! 	The ‚Äúthem‚Äù was just a simple colloquialism and the ‚ÄúSecond Commandment‚Äù was an inadvertent lapsus calami when I intended to write Second Amendment. So please try not to set your hair on fire. Nonetheless, your non sequiturs add nothing to the debate.
@onecatandahorse @seanhannity What a narcissistic blowhard this Hannity is.
@seanhannity Sean Hannity,or is it Crapnity? That show is one of the most malevolent peddlers of fake news, conspiracy theories and right-wing nationalist tosh ever. History's verdict is already etched in stone.
@Mlsmith300Smith @FiveRights The man is leading you to perdition and you see nothing wrong with that. Nice.
@RichardRSmithJr @DLoesch English. The queen's language that Wayne LaPierre constantly mangles. Dana can't hide from her indefensible positions and actions on this issue and we will continue to point that out, much to the chagrin of those of you in her amen Corner.
@CREWcrew He should have used the tax cut he finagled for himself in Trump's 1.5 trillion tax scam. But these corporate welfarists just can't resist stealing just one more cookie.
@1776Stonewall Maybe y'all should worry about the mad man who is firing your ideological soul mates left and right in the Oval Office. The Republican party is going up in flames and you are fiddling like Nero. BTW, how is Stormy Daniels doing?

@RealJamesWoods Your thinly masked glee at this woman's misfortune sickens me.
@DLoesch Check the archives and see how your amen corner has been harassing them poor kids for exercising their first commandment right as they try to stop irresponsible adults from using the Second to kill them young.
@DLoesch Stop whining. You have been at the forefront of attacking and impugning the kids of Parkland.
@FiveRights Another conspiracy theory that will die and be forgotten.
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump Are you getting nervous, Huckabee?
@IngrahamAngle Shep Smith is right. The Ingraham Angle and the Sean 'Crap'nity show, like so many other right-wing nationalist Fox opinion shows, are strictly malicious entertainment.
@ktimmons541 Valerie Jarrett? I don't really think so. She was powerful but not a puppet mistress for Obama. There is no MAGA. It's just MAMA- Make America Miserable Again! I know that you his supporters are hoping that the crazy don't come out, but those in the WH know its bedlam out there!
@ktimmons541 How do you get in the inspectors? You build trust on what's been signed and expand the treaty. Not by reimposing sanctions and siding with the ambitious crown prince of Saudi Arabia in the Shia-Sunni conflict. And definitely not by being S.Arabia's wingman in Yemen airstrikes.
@ktimmons541 Don't believe the president's twitter hype. The intelligence agencies so not spy on citizens, despite the chorus from the right.
@ktimmons541 The only thing is how can the president renegotiate anything when he is busy tweeting insults and firing his staff?
@ktimmons541 Our national security organizations position is that Iran is abiding by the terms of the agreements. What has been unhelpful is this president's dogged determination to kill the deal. He keeps reimposing sanctions hoping that Iran will walk away. Real reason? Saudi Arabian money!
@ktimmons541 Iran is not a democracy and its activities in the Middle East are loathsome, particularly in Syria and Yemen. But so is Saudi Arabia. The treaty was not just between Iran and US. The permanent members of the Security Council and Germany are also signatories.
@ktimmons541 Trump came in growling and pouring scorn on Nafta, Paris Climate Accord, Trans Pacific, threatening to tear up NATO etc, but what has he done? It' s easy to tear down stuff, but harder to build up. Obama is head and shoulders above Trump in this regard.
@ktimmons541 You see Keith, the reality is that Trump, for all his boast about being the world's greatest negotiator, has really not negotiated yet anything of substance in the White House. The Iran deal that he has been heckling is considered to have stopped Iran's nuke ambition.
John Bolton? Mustachioed John Bolton? War addict and voracious NeoCon John Bolton? Iraq-war cheerleader John Bolton? Nuke-North-Korea John Bolton? Nuke-Iran John Bolton? Nuke-Russia John Bolton? John Bolton for National Security Adviser? Truly, our president has gone mad again!
@FoxNews YES!!!
@BillOReilly Well, he brings bit on himself. He rages against friends and foes and has zero loyalty to anybody but himself. He fires allies and divorces wives at the drop of a hat. He is the gift that keeps giving.
@wma1953 @kacee1115 @DaveSeabaugh @GregSilva15 @BillOReilly Have you asked yourself who really spreads fake news in this country? Think, man, think!
Shameless hypocrisy in action. https://t.co/36wSzAlfUb

@wwwillstand Lol! You probably mean stand by Donald Trump and bring back Satan. He was praying up a storm with Stormy Daniels üòÇüòÇ
@WalshFreedom But remember that it is not just minorities and poor people that believe in free stuff. Captains of industry and billionaires do too, as is evident when the President and your fellow Republicans recently gave them 1.5 trillion dollars in tax breaks and screwed us with the bill.
@WalshFreedom Oh Joe, you have become a master of the dog whistle.
@AndyThorburnCA Anarchy rules!!	Go Trump!!!
@FoxNews @RealJamesWoods @LibbySchaaf Did this insane right-winger ever win an Oscar? And to think that I ever watched his movies....Aargh!!
@PoliticalEmilia U R the Best!!!!
@dcexaminer Lol. Kellyanne, hop on your broom and fly away.
@SarahPalinUSA So, it's not a 400 pound man somewhere who was messing with the election after all. Good progress.
@WalshFreedom Good guy with a gun.....Have we not yet overused this propagandist trash? Ask the NRA to retire it already. Jeeze!
@FiveRights America is America. America is not Mexico or Israel or those other countries with walls and fences. Remember that.
@BillKristol Et tu Bill? I had high hopes for you. Smh
@dcexaminer Go Ruthie! Stay there until the Blue Wave crashes the party. Hang tough and make Trump angry.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Yeah, yeah. He has been screaming and ranting about trickle-down economics since the Reagan era. Get ready for an economic implosion and a free fall of the stock market if his nutty dreams ever become the nation's nightmare.
@FiveRights Trump is a one-term president sir. The blue wave in 2018 will become a tsunami in 2020. We will take over from this right-wing lunatic experiment and restore the Republic to its leadership role in the world.
@BillKristol Very picky, Mr. Kristol, and quite hypocritical too. What about those cowardly right-wing Republicans like Deby Nunes and the congressional Repub leadership that are winking, nodding and abetting Donald Trump as he goes to war with the Intelligence agencies?
@WalshFreedom They are simply marching for the freedom of not being killed by people behaving badly with guns.
@dcexaminer Well, we are now a mafia state where loyalty to Trump trump‚Äôs loyalty to country. Sigh.
@Goss30Goss @realDonaldTrump He won‚Äôt. Instead expect a tweet about ‚Äúcrooked Hillary‚Äù, border walls, fabulous stock markets, and maybe even a firing of a cabinet official by twitter.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Michael Cohen is going to jail. Trump better get ready to pardon him.
@1776Stonewall Sessions will be a damned fool to do Trump‚Äôs bidding. He will destroy whatever little is left of his integrity. Why are wing nuts of the right happily clapping as Trump attacks our institutions? Very troubling and sad.
@NBCNews And what did the president say about all this? Crickets!
@krassenstein @ANCHORSEND1 Trump‚Äôs lawyer will probably ask Jeff Sessions to shut it down.
@KELLYWEILL @ANCHORSEND1 Oh my!!	There‚Äôs something about rightwing nutters and sex that is unseemly. They parade around with tiki torches and go home and illicitly crawl into someone‚Äôs bed.
@RawStory @ANCHORSEND1 I know that the president is kinky in his politics. Could Stormy D have something kinky on the president that is causing him to jump through all these hoops to silence her?
@mitchellvii As they say, keep hope alive! We are moving on with a blue wave that will wash away the many embarrassments of this president.
@MSNBC @NBCOUT Oh these radical Republicans!
@IngrahamAngle @ConorLambPA @TomCottonAR No Laura. You enabled Trump to takeover your party. Live it. Conor Lamb bleeds blue. Blue crush!
@FoxNews @DevinNunes What is this guy doing on TV at this late hour? Shouldn't he be on his master's lap in the White House purring softly as his tummy is tickled by the fireside?
@WalshFreedom And i will just like to add:	TRUMP LOST AGAIN!!	Making America sane again!	MASA!
@RedPilledinNY They can do both; no?
@Thomas_PaineUSA @ICEgov T Paine, you're killing me. Nice one!
@VicenteFoxQue @realDonaldTrump Lol. This is sweet. Can you come over and be my president?
@DVATW Your heart is too dark and full of hate, David Vance. How so? Britain cannot be stopped. It colonized the world, are a superpower, and now you want this country to retreat under a rock? Ain't gonna happen! But hey, you can continue fighting your  windmills like Don Quixote.
@HeroPuss @StopBigMoney @ConorLambPA Nope. He won good and proper. Go Conor!
@StopBigMoney @ConorLambPA Conor! Conor! Conor! Conor!	Congrats sir!	And get ready for the twitterstorm fro our man.
@FiveRights It's a fine line between supporting intolerance overseas and supporting intolerance at home. When you stereotype folks abroad, you invariably end up doing the same thing to your own countrymen. God does not discriminate. We are all his children. Organized hatred is a sin. Amen!
@IngrahamAngle Already spinning this, Laura? Hahahaha. Repubs spent 10 million dollars on what should be a firmly secure Repub seat. Trump flew out there and held the mother of rallies and yet still, the Dem won this most Republican of seats. It's not a blue wave, Laura. It's a Blue Crush!
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Trump is a veteran of the rough and tumble NYC politics. All those contracts and licenses don‚Äôt come easy, you know. The other thing abt shaking a man‚Äôs hand- please don‚Äôt believe that applesauce.
@yceek @ALWAYSPsalm91 They will whack any one and anything just so they can protect their president.
@FoxNews @JulieAlvin_ @TheDemocrats 2016? That‚Äôs so yesterday. We are kicking donkey from here till the November eternity and claim the House and Senate, and then we‚Äôre gonna make Trump really crazy. Hehehe.
@JenniferWinckel @PrincessBravato @TeoGuzman63 @barmato @Wellzy4 @EricHolder Yep yep yep!
@VP @SenCoryGardner @SenatorRisch One term VP!
@MonaSalama_ Whip him Conor. Whip him real good!
@TeaPainUSA @realDonaldTrump He stands a better chance of France paying for it.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Ok. Enjoy your dinner sir.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights He had no choice but to recuse himself. He had lied straight up about knowledge/ meetings pertinent to the investigation. He had no choice but stand down or he would have squandered what little credibility he had left.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Keith, let‚Äôs put to rest that myth of dear old Trump not being a politician. The man has been political for over 30 years. I‚Äôve seen videos of him wanting to be president since Adam. He‚Äôs a top politician, with mastery over the pistol and dagger politics of New York. He‚Äôs a pro.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Purely political? Nah!	After Sessions recused himself from the Russian investigation, Trump threw a tantrum and accused Session of being a disloyal SOB and sent him off to the dog house. This witch hunt against Clinton et al is his ticket back to Trump‚Äôs graces. Yes sir!
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Not really true. He was bringing unwanted attention to the campaign. That‚Äôs why he fired him. Btw, Trump was cold blooded with Rex Tillerson today, wasn‚Äôt he? Tweeted a sack. Damn, that‚Äôs cold, man.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Yep but by doing so, he has politicized DOJ. He seems to be harassing va political opponent as payback for his Boss. Jeff Sessions is behaving like the sheriff in Dukes of Hazzard to Trump‚Äôs Boss Hoggü§†
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights That‚Äôs the hook. Remember also that he was Campaign manager at the time Putin and Trumpnwere playing footsie with the campaign. Look at Manafort: a veritable poster boy for Russian interference in our elections.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Have you ever hunted a wild animal in an exotic reserve? You act like you don‚Äôt see him and just when he begins to get comfortable, you bag him. Violent analogy, but Mueller is stalking his parry. Carter Page is toast. He‚Äôs gonna squeal soon abt Russia and Boss Putin. Sweeeeeet!!
@alisetteo @RustySh78358017 @jennacathill @FiveRights Lol.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Not really true Keith. He is my president and want him to succeed. If he gets the North Ks to give up their nukes, I believe he should be given the Nobel peace prize. But the man is do unpredictable. He wants to tear up the Iran deal. Bad idea. Will make Kim wary abt signing.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Carter Page is not innocent. The way he and Paul Manafort wormed their way into the Trump Campaign is true expiry stuff.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights It‚Äôs all talk. See if he goes all the way and annoys the Russians. Won‚Äôt happen. An angry Purim is a scary Putin to Trump. Hehe.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Yeah, it happens.	Abt to drive home now. Will continue the convo later. Cheers my friend.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights About the wiretapping, I would rather listen to the FBI and DOJ, which says that there was no unauthorized wiretapping. Carter Page had been on the FBI's radar long before his association with Trump. The FISA court gave appropriate authorization. The right needs to let this go.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Oh Keith, Obama is not a Muslim. And even if he is, what a "fantabulous" president he was. Remember, he came in when the economy was teetering from all that supply-side economic junk conservatives are addicted to. He saved the economy, saved the auto industry, and brought jobs.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights WE can't isolate ourselves. Keith. We are the superpower of the world. We are everywhere. Isolationism is futile.
@AT_right_of_ctr @FiveRights Not too sure about that. Soon, someone's gonna start singing to Mueller. Just saying...
@AT_right_of_ctr @FiveRights Agreed, Ross, but there will be times beyond ideology that we may agree on. Cheers sir.
@ktimmons541 @FoxNews More a panacea than a disease.
@ktimmons541 @FoxNews Hehe
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Did you check out the rampage he is on now at State? The man has gone nuts again.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Hehehe. I'm good, bro. Just taking care of business. You are my favorite debate colleague.
@FoxNews And now, Mike Pence must do the right thing by apologizing to the good lord for politicizing his divine name to promote and advance a rightwing ideology.
@TomiLahren Nap time!
@Fuctupmind Not nice. Let her enjoy her retirement in peace.
@BillKristol Trump, firing someone to his face? That big coward. He will keep firing them at State until he makes Jared Kushner his Secretary of State. Just watch!
@FiveRights @mrod21mvp Wishful thinking. Trump is as guilty as sin. It just says that it is important to have aggressively earnest bootlickers as heads of Congressional investigative committees. Go Devin Nunes!
@BillOReilly Social fascism that attacks non-liberal viewpoints? How about the right-wing fascism that is eating into the fabric of our democracy, and which you support?
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights I doubt it, Keith. The president is angel-innocent. Lol
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Every politician has a bone in the closet. Understandable. I just find the cult of personality around President Trump both hilarious and disturbing. It's like Trump did this, and Fox and the Rightwing Amen corner scream: it's not him. It's Obama/Clinton/Pelosi. Sad.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights I bet if they had said Obama did it, you guys will be as happy as a fat kid seeing cake. You would have somersaulted into impossibly inelegant positions. Imagine Rush Limbaugh and Sean Crapnitty and Mark Levin pirouetting happily!
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Cheers
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Really? Scribbling his signature on executive orders that play to his base is achievement? Screaming insults and trying to rip healthcare from the poor and middle class so that he can pay for his tax breaks for the rich is achievement? Let's get a lil' more ambitious, shall we?
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Comparing apples and apples really.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights You must really, really love trump. God bless your heart!
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Lol Keith. You crack me up.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Just wanna know the president's position on this: Britain condemned it. It is an act of terrorism by the Russian state. Another ex Soviet spy, Litvienko, was killed by Polonium in London. For a president who condemns terrorism, why has he not condemned this? Just saying...
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Running a business is great, but it's not a prerequisite for sober leadership. That is another nutty canard from the rightists.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Not patting myself, Keith. Just giving a heartfelt compliment to Keith. You too are a great debater- no BS.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Here you go Keith.	https://t.co/Q2WMXB9ezj
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights You don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to Putin but are quick to ascribe the worst of calumnies on liberals, Obama and Clinton? That's rich, my friend. Here you go, mate:	https://t.co/Q2WMXB9ezj
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights A proven negotiator in escaping bankruptcy and piling debt, I'd say. Hahahaha. Do you know the back story for Trump hurriedly accepting the offer from Kim that blindsided even Tillerson and his national security staff? You want me to tell you? It's deep, bro; really deep.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Winning where, what? he ain't winning nothing. Just huffing and puffing and changing his staff, and playing patty cake with Putin. 	Has he condemned Putin's attempted assassination of the Russian spy and his daughter in London yet? Nope!
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Trust me, Keith, you are doing a fabulous job. New to twitter too. So we are both newbies. No joke, I respect your debating skills, even though yours is for a wrong-headed ideology, lol.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Anyway, negotiating with your enemies is always a sensible option. Even Trump is negotiating with Kim Jong un. Feel me?
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights So you think Pompeo is going to be an isolationist hawk? Ha! Fortress America is a pipe dream smoked by the anarchist right.
@o_plaisance @FiveRights But how would you know, my friend? Hmmm. BTW who do you hate more? Liberals or Russian communists?
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Want me to list the many examples? One deep flaw in Republican/Conservative philosophy: Cut taxes for billionaires, slap around the Middle class with sweet nothings, spend massively on the military and foreign engagements and expect economic miracle. Fool's gold, my friend!
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights You sure about that? I thought it was frozen after Ayatollah Khomeini led the revolution that established the Islamic Republic. Remember that Iran seized hostages?
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights There is no deep state; just the national security institutions that keep America safe from foreign enemies and Trump's paranoia.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Nice riff! The Emperor has no clothes though.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Reason for the planeload? Iran had been banished from the financial wiring system. Now I know there is a back story to the plane money which the talk radio conspiracy theorists have been yammering about. Could it be that Iranian money in the US was unfrozen and returned? Dig deep
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Wish upon a star my friend.
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights I mean when is the blustering right gonna stop blaming Obama for....
@ktimmons541 @uniuniman53 @FiveRights Oh Keith, you know it isn't true. When is the blustering right gonna give blame Obama for their own inadequacies and fallacious propositions? BTW how do you like the way President Crazy fired poor Rex Tillerson today? Our president has gone mad again. Sigh.

@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights No collusion? Hahaha! Devin Nunes just went bonkers on prime time. The intelligence services said there was collusion, and this dishonorable and abysmally obsequious man with the IQ of a gnat said. "there was no collusion." No wonder the polls for Congress is in the toilet.
@powertaff Haha. Ain't gonna happen. Schiff will chair House Intel soon.
@powertaff Yup!!!
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights WHAT?	Please come back Uni-man. I had so much hope for you. Lol. You gotta read deep on this. ISIS was dislodged, but the plans were already in place and on track before Trump was elected. Did you know that?
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights In just two months after the tax giveaway? Well, well
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights You look like someone who gets his daily newsfeed from the talk radio circuit. EIB? haha. I dig deep and wide for my news. From BBC to Mother Jones, NYT and Breitbert. Maybe you should too.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Hiring for now? Yes, but can you just give some credit to Obama? Don't be too greedy. There's enough to go around. But of course the economic cacophony that your man is belching into the economy seriously endangers the long term outlook.
@intoitterphoesh @FiveRights Nice one, padre: Rhyme to reason. Haha. I just don't find any rhyme in DT's sour notes of melancholia.
@AT_right_of_ctr @FiveRights How can we show you when the right's errand boy keeps sabotaging the House Intel's investigation with his dishonorable antics? I know your boy's gonna fire Mueller as soon as he gets too close for comfort. MAGA!

@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights And Muslim nations did not band together before Trump? Just remember that Iraq1 and Iraq2 are a direct result of Muslim nations banding together with the USA. The alignment now is Sunni nations trying to stem Shia Iran and Saudi Prince's power grab. Also UAE designs on Qatar.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Apart from taking a buzz saw to regs protecting consumers and the environment, what really has he done? 90% of what he is thumping his chest about in his echo  champer and amen corner is a honeymoon blessing left for him by....are you ready for this?...OBAMA!!!
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Increases in 401(k)....right. The stock market goes up, 401k swells up nicely. But remember what goes up will come down. We are racing to uncharted bubbles in the stock Market, with all the commonsense measures that were put in place after the last crash now taken off by Trump.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights No bitterness here, mon ami, but the jury is still out on the mass homicide of regulations by Trump. It's akin to saying, why can't we make the journey from Florida to California shorter by increasing the speed limit to 100 miles per hour. Yeah we  will get there faster but..Ah!!

@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Oh, you think the 4.1% unemployment magically appeared because someone called Trump came and started screaming MAGA? See how the unemployment rate‚Äôs genesis started with Obama. When this regime‚Äôs crazy policies take hold, it will be an economic disaster all over again.
@uniuniman53 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights How about the 212 billion dollar deficit for just February, the largest February for starters?
@AhmedBaba_ @TarotDarrow @CNN @GOP Devin Nunes says Trump is innocent. Putin is innocent. That we are all imagining stuff. He is truly one of the most astoundingly corrupt and unethical politicians in America today. After nearly 250 years of political evolution, how did we get to this point?

@shannon4t76 Really? After the conservatives and Repubs nearly decimated the economy and and almost buried the car industry? When the stock market was in free fall? Obama‚Äôs policies saved the country as Repubs paraded in Tea Parties. Obama‚Äôs econ is buoying the country right now. The truth.
@jaydub2868 @Dcilurso1 @MagdalenaMoreh1 @FiveRights Lol. How does a pup piss? Oh, raise a leg and spray the fire hydrant? Nice. I can totally do that.
@okeefer285 @RustySh78358017 @jennacathill @FiveRights Thank you	Me,	Me AH ü§†
@shannon4t76 Lol, tax giveaways, Obama‚Äôs residual economic afterglow......Heaven on earth, wow! Peace with Kim or Talk to Kim? We shall see.
@SteveCasull @surfbig81 @FiveRights Finished its work? Nah! The Repubs shut it down quickly when the investigation got too close for comfort. Trump bellowed st them to shut it down, and they gutlessly complied. No worries. After Dems take the House, investigations galore.
@conrow1_1 The Nor‚Äôeaster! I didn‚Äôt think of it. Awful timing. Hope it doesn‚Äôt slam into Penn. Cold and blue and voting!
@terisa_clothier @FiveRights We shall see.....
@conrow1_1 It is indeed close. It‚Äôs all gonna depend on turnout and ground game. Just seeing the fear on Repubs, from Congress to the White House, after they the Dem takes that seat will be priceless.
@SteveCasull @surfbig81 @FiveRights Take your pick, Prof.
@terisa_clothier @FiveRights For dancing the tango with Vladimir Putin.
@conrow1_1 Me too, Georgie. I‚Äôm watching the Pennsylvania race tomorrow closely. Trump won by 22% last time around. If Conor wins, the blue wave is for real. ü§û

@J_G_E_O @eJayBird @FiveRights Aight then. April ain‚Äôt too far awayüòÄ
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Cheers my friend. I look forward to engaging you more.
@J_G_E_O @eJayBird @FiveRights I wish him well. Less nukes makes a safer world. If prez achieves this, he deserves the Nobel. But he is probably gonna come from it threatening to roast N Korea with nukes and starting another fire somewhere. We shall see.
We win back the House in Nov. Adam Schiff becomes Chairman of the Intel Committee. Dems then conduct an unbiased and honorable investigation of collusion, including Devin Nunes‚Äôs eager Fox Trot with The Donald. Hopefully, he will finally get that job with the Trump Org. https://t.co/S8orfpHqqe
He looks like Ron Jeremy! https://t.co/D8FQSc8CqA
@J_G_E_O @eJayBird @FiveRights True, but in a whole bunch of off the wall twittering. Condensation of the president‚Äôs fulmination: ‚ÄúI will huff and I will puff, and I will vaporize North Korea with nukes!‚Äù	There, you have it.
@ReallyNotAMoose @FiveRights No no no! Not the Intel Conmittee; just the Repubs on that committee, led by the disruptive Nunes. They colluded to the hilt with Trump who colluded with the Russians.
@tim_fargo I tried but the sun burnt my cornea. Aarrgh!!
@RNCResearch Nope, she didn‚Äôt. She is just blasting the demagoguery and dark instincts he evoked.
@KatiePavlich And Trump is sufferable? HRC won more votes but Putin had other ideas. Sigh.

@RustySh78358017 @FiveRights Ouch. Lol
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights I did too, including the horribly redacted Schiff one. Devin Nunes ought to be ashamed of himself. What a dishonorable member of Congress ü§ìü§ì
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights The president has been hollering paranoid figments of his imagination, knowing his 5th Avenue supporters would support him even if he shot dead a man. Without Russian collusion, the FISA court wouldn‚Äôt have authorized wiretapping of Carter Page et al.
@Truth777True @FiveRights Wait for Mueller to finish his investigation. Parroting the president‚Äôs denials won‚Äôt let it go away. MAGA!
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Cheers bro. You are a worthy debater. God bless.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Are you sure Keith? The FBI did say, things were taken out of context and isolated instances were used to brew a storm in a teacup. Nunes has no interest in the truth. He is an obstructionist in the Mueller Investigation. I think he‚Äôs campaigning for a post Congress job with Prez
@MisterRouse @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 4 years where? Dream on. He‚Äôs a one term crackpot president.
@RussellC1hfd Ok Macho man, congrats on the chest thumping. But you sound like someone who listens to those detestable radio gasbags that have coarsened debate in the country: Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh and Mark Levin.
@RussellC1hfd But building a wall and sliming a whole nation? Plus pumping in hundreds of billions of dollars on a wall? The Great Wall of America! It has nothing to do with patriotism. It‚Äôs pure Trumpian insanity.
@RussellC1hfd Please don‚Äôt let us go down that route of picking and choosing the ideological sins of the right. It won‚Äôt be pretty. You guys have too many skeletons in that closet.
@RussellC1hfd And you think conservatives and the endless wars abroad and ideological battles they have been waging at home on the poor and middle class are innocent puppies? Get real, man.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights But what I remember is Republican hanky panky to suppress the Democratic version of events. Nunes authored a thoroughly partisan reported that was deservedly derided by the Dems.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Hmmm!
@jpmzo @FiveRights Come the midterms in November, Trumplicans will gnash their teeth. Blue wave against the insanity.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Nunes? Devin Nunes? Oh no, Keith, not Devin, Trump‚Äôs overly earnest lapdog. üôâ
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Collusion with Russians to screw the elections, if proven, is betrayal worse than ‚Äúselling‚Äù nonexistent Uranium.
@RussellC1hfd There‚Äôs a big difference between patriotism and jingoism. What‚Äôs up with this contempt you seem to have for your fellow citizens who hold a different ideology? You probably believe in stripping Medicaid and Obamacare from people. I don‚Äôt. So what? We all love America.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights About the Russia thing, let‚Äôs wait for Mueller‚Äôs report before you absolve the president.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights It will be illegal of course, but is it true? I truly believe that this is the stuff conspiracy theories are made from.
@eJayBird @FiveRights Quite some hyperbole, don‚Äôt you think? But who is the president who has talked so cavalierly about using nukes with fire and fury? Take a guess....
@JohnJ1747 @jennacathill @RustySh78358017 @FiveRights Aight John. I‚Äôll drink a beer to that. Now let‚Äôs go back to debating.
@jordanelite56 @ktimmons541 @FiveRights Too many trillions- added up by both Repubs and Dems. And your president just added a trillion and a half to it in a fat giveaway to billionaires. Sigh. Rounds up to another 7 trills in a decade. Great balls of fire!!
@desicomfort @FiveRights OK my friend. I‚Äôll do so- right after the nit job in the WH sees his psychiatrist.
@desicomfort @FiveRights Name calling, aye my friend? Now get if the hissyfit and argue sensibly. But if you can‚Äôt defend your assertions, it‚Äôs OK too üòÇüòÇ
@Funnyfacker2 @FiveRights Nice jab. But get off the submarine and realize that your president is all hat and no cattle.
@RustySh78358017 @jennacathill @FiveRights Lol
@Khal_Padraig @FiveRights Eh
@Draclonis @jennacathill @RustySh78358017 @FiveRights Really? OK.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights Keith, no president has sold the country. I am afraid you are just repeating the talking points that Repub propagandists like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh dish out from the Kool Aid bucket. Don‚Äôt drink it, Keith, please don‚Äôt.
@RustySh78358017 @FiveRights Nice one!	Keep cussing, Samson.

@RustySh78358017 @FiveRights Such a nice fella you are!
@jpmzo @FiveRights Ah, they emptied the entire sewage on our election. True story that.
@desicomfort @FiveRights Calm down, Desi, the Republic is aight. The Dems are gonna win because Trump has made the Republican brand a dumpster fire. He can rant all he wants against CNN and the FBI, and claim invisible accolades and crowns from thin air. It won‚Äôt matter much in November. A Dem blue wave!
@RustySh78358017 @jennacathill @FiveRights Look deep and you will see Putin giving Trump the bottle, and burping him. So nice. ü§†
@jakcobren33 @FiveRights Thank you for your genuinely sincere kudos. See, I am not half as bad. I‚Äôm already emulating your hero in the WH in lapping up all the praise and preening. Hehe.
@RussellC1hfd Do you really believe that Trump is not corrupt, and that everybody else is corrupt? Just because he dismisses the truth about him as fake news does not really mean he is right, you know. Btw, is Jerad Kushner still extorting those big bucks in the Oval Office?üòéüòé
@RussellC1hfd Ah, my dear Russell, you make my point! The DNC gave us Hillary and Putin gave you Trump. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
@MagdalenaMoreh1 @FiveRights Whether you support my position or not, I like you! Straight to the point üòé
@TanyaLaPree @FiveRights Oooh Tanya, thanks for the advice, but be truthful, deep down, you suspect that something is amiss about our president, right? Come on now, don‚Äôt be shy.
@desicomfort @FiveRights Hahaha!	We already have s lot of el loco in the WH. You guys should be encouraging Trump to seek psychiatric care, instead of egging him in his antics.
@postwarO27 @FiveRights Lol
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights You are a very loyal guy, Keith. Taking a gratuitous whack at the FBI, DOJ, CIA, GVI etc etc gust to excuse Trump. Hmmm, OK.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights You don't have to look too keenly at the nut case here. Now, tell the truth. You truly believe that Trump has a few loose screws right? C'mon, don't be coy. The prez is a little sensitive in the membrane. Hehe.
@ktimmons541 @FiveRights No worries, padre. He is flaming the throne. Aren't y'all ashamed of this irresponsible election manipulation and collusion? Smh!
@jennacathill @RustySh78358017 @FiveRights Wow, is this how the Trumplicans rant in debates? Sad. Very sad!
@jennacathill @FiveRights It's a reality. Russia is gonna bite hard.
@jakcobren33 @FiveRights Lol. I actually have a tremendously huge IQ. Lordy, I am now sounding like your boss in the White House.
@desicomfort @FiveRights Why do you guys getting nervous whenever Russia gets mentioned in a discussion? Haha.  Trump played footsie with Putin and we will not let him forget that. In the Nov elections, we are going to run against Putin in every district.
@RussellC1hfd I'm going to be nice and say Neptune, and not the U planet. Lol
@postwarO27 @FiveRights Yep, Putin is not going anywhere.
@FiveRights How much does CNN have to betray USA? Wrong question, sir. Correct question:  How much more does Trump have to betray USA to Russia before Republicans call for his impeachment?

@madelinealright @realDonaldTrump Lol. Hehehe. Right on the money!
@JChengWSJ @AmbJohnBolton Bolton is one of those neocon jackasses that swung us into endless Iraq and Afghanistan to the tune of $3.6 trillion and counting.

So what's new? News that you don't like is fake news. Fawning coverage from Weasel News is the gospel truth. Yawn.
@PastorJohnHagee mortal world, not wars.
@PastorJohnHagee We were all once God's divine children in Heaven before being kicked out into this mortal wars. We have to find our way back to Our Father with humility and love. Those who politicize God's Church or support vicious ideologies that hurt God's children are imperiled in God's eyes
@RandPaul I really believe some folks have reduced the entire constitution to the Second Amendment. You don't care if other rights and liberties are violated, but will raise hell even if a commonsense regulation to the Second Amendment is proffered. No guns till 21 is sensible imho.
@conrow1_1 Indeed. 	And they say it with such a straight face. Would be comical were it not so outrageous. It's like a stickup 'artist' insisting that he didn't rob you after stealing your wallet in broad daylight. Smh.

@conrow1_1 He and those other repugnant radio propagandists- Rush Limbaugh, Mark Levin, Michael Savage et al- have a toxic grip on a big chunk of the Republican base. These guys have helped to coarsen politics and are responsible for many good people voting against their own self interests.

@JenniferJx5 @FiveRights Umm Jennifer, the guns that killed at Las Vegas, Sandy Hook, Parkland were......legally bought. And the shooters were not criminals. Mentally ill but no criminal record.
@Larsofhaus1 Oh my @Larsofhaus1 , so the gun is innocent? So it sleeps gently like an innocent baby and purrs like a cat until the big bad shooter picks it up and rips apart dozens of innocents? I‚Äôm not afraid of the gun but of the little timid men who act big n crazy with a big loaded gun.

Sooooo proud of my president!!!! Trump said he would rush into a school, bare chested and unarmed, through a lake of fire and a hail of bullets, to stop a crazed gunman firing an AR! My heart: MAGA PROUD!	My new bumper sticker: MY PRESIDENT CAN KICK YOUR PRESIDENT‚ÄôS ASS!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ

@AMDWaters @DVATW Don‚Äôt worry, you loony-fringed, anti-immigrant fringe nuts (and our own homegrown goose-stepping Breitbert nationalists). Don‚Äôt have a cow.

@conrow1_1 Same sentiments here, Georgie1. At times, we have to soar above the noise to listen to the heart.
@conrow1_1 Indeed my sister. The key to salvation is to love in the midst of all the hatred and ugliness. Some Church  leaders support frightful ideologies, sanction injustice and and turn churches into ideological precincts and cash cows. Jesus never fought or hurt anyone. God loves us all
An admirable admonition for all of God‚Äôs children. Loving one another, as God loves us, seems easy to say but is such a tripwire. It is the key to heaven and our divine destiny. No bigotry, hatred, war on folks who look, speak or pray different. Hug and love them and exalt God. https://t.co/uJEZACoWMY

@700club The salvation of man is love.	Why? Because God loves all his children. From pope to pauper, celebrity to social leper, we are all his beloved children- once divine, now mere mortals. Our destiny is divinity and galactic power, after the earthly trials. The key? Love. Hurt no one
@FoxNews @robertjeffress @BillyGraham As mortals, we do not really know what is in God‚Äôs heart. When we were divine children of God, we knew everything. With love for our mortal siblings, we earn our stripes to go back to heaven as worthy divine children. Our loving Father awaits to welcome us prodigals to heaven.
@JoelOsteen We put too much stock in earth‚Äôs pursuit. Just remember that we are on this mortal earth for just a short time, courtesy of God‚Äôs divine love. Although life is harsh and God may appear uncaring &amp; nepotistic, he loves us dearly and awaits us in Heaven with love for the prodigals.

@EWErickson Nice one, Erik. How dare those mean people pick on little, poor, innocent NRA. For shame!
Trump and Wayne LaPierre, NRA boss and an unelected American emperor: Irreconcilable differences.	Trump: Raise the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21	Wayne: No, bring it down to baby‚Äôs first birthday. 	Trump: Arm teachers	Wayne: Gun up teachers, students, janitors, cafeteria workers.
NRA: What about those enhanced background checks? Don‚Äôt you know that most folks who load up on these guns are a little off-kilter?	Trump: Relax, Wayne. You and I know that we both are a little loco. Do you think I will vote against my own self interest by targeting the mentals?
Trump: I‚Äôm so sorry. 	NRA: Sorry nothing! You kiss Putin‚Äôs ring but disrespect us! Don‚Äôt you know that we can hurt you more than Vlad ever can?	Trump: Forgive me. Those measures I proposed have no teeth- just feel good fuzzy velvet. Teachers will raise hell over the gun-carry.
Trump‚Äôs Dirty Harry Teachers	Student: Ms. D is a witch. 	Ms.D: What did ya say, punk?	Student:Sorry, Ms.D, I‚Äôm sorry. 	Ms.D: Say something punk. This here is a Magnum357. It‚Äôii blow your head right off your body. Eff with me again and I‚Äôll blast you to smithereens. Now scram!!

@andypanda_c9 @mfkn_beerdrinkr @Thomas_PaineUSA Not an attack, Andy; just telling the truth about the NRA. Wayne LePierre will not give an inch, and Trump‚Äôs proposed actions will not be be enforced-without  the necessary legislative action. All those prople who have grunted against the NRA will be targets at election time.
Trump‚Äôs cues 	5) I hear you	6) if an impertinent brat scolds you for the guns, don‚Äôt fire a tweet; don‚Äôt hurl the smart phone at her. Just bite your lip hard and give death stare. 	7) Give them the NRA‚Äôs solution: armed teachers and build a huge Mexico-wall around every school! https://t.co/iVvXTlM9mm

@andypanda_c9 @mfkn_beerdrinkr @Thomas_PaineUSA That I will give to you, but you know how things work in Congress. The minority can effectively block legislation and it effectively did. You surely know about the NRA‚Äôs formidable campaign chest right?
@andypanda_c9 @mfkn_beerdrinkr @Thomas_PaineUSA The NRA can‚Äôt continue to be inflexible on guns on principle with bodies piling up. Something‚Äôs gotta give. It will be a PR disaster to continue to scare Congress away from necessary legislation that stanches the bloodbath in our schools.
@PastorJohnHagee But what does faith really, truly mean?
@conrow1_1 Thank you Georgie 1. Hope you have a terrific day.
8) Jesus Christ realized these truths early and used them to help and save his siblings. 	9) Heaven is not a meadow. It is an Inner Sanctum of Divine Power and Galactic  Dominion. 	10) Hell is our time away from heaven in mortality. In heaven, we are bequeathed in divinity.
6) When we reach the point of critical worthiness, we prodigals are welcomed back to our divinity and power by a waiting, loving Father- now better rulers. 7) Jesus Christ is the son of God, just as all of us are, equally loved by God.
4) The Father was determined that we must learn from our mistakes and learn goodness in complete mortality, without any divine intervention or knowledge of our past power. 	5) As we trudge and stumble through the challenges of life-1 lifetime or many- the father awaits our return
1) We are all loved divine children of God - all the billions of us. 2)We had divine dominion over stars, galaxies, multiverses.  3) We somehow lost our way, got stripped of our divinity, became mortal and were kicked out of heaven. https://t.co/bDDGMkxcVS
@Franklin_Graham @BillyGraham All of God‚Äôs children are trudging through trials in The Father‚Äôs creations, learning humility, love, justice, compassion and goodness through different cycles, planets, galaxies and multiverses until we become worthy of being welcomed back to heaven by God‚Äôs abiding love.
@Franklin_Graham @BillyGraham The most thrilling thing about heaven is that God, our father, awaits to welcome us back as prodigals to the great thrones of divinity we once occupied before we fell out of favor, heaven. Some get in after one lifetime‚Äôs sojourn. Others, a zillion. Through it all, a father waits

@RickeyDale07 @Evangelic4Trump No my friend, I am very correct and confident in the love of our divine father for all his children. We were all divine children in the Inner Sanctum, seated on royal thrones with dominion over galaxies and planets. Something must have happened for us to lose our divinity.

@RedPilledinNY @conrow1_1 And there, my friend, is this unending winter of our discontent. We didn‚Äôt do anything after the harrowing national ordeal of Sandy Hook or Vegas and countless others. We will morbidly work through this one, yet again, with sanctimonious intonations and do nothing. Very sad.
@RedPilledinNY @DaniGraychik From all indications, Cruz had been screaming like a banshe about being a total basket case. How could the authorities have helped here when the president‚Äôs budget proposal cuts a quarter from Medicaid- the main  agency that pays to treat mental illness? Priorities are warped.
@DaniGraychik @RedPilledinNY I really think all this talk about the FBI is a storm in a tea cup meant to obfuscate and deflect from the indefensible role of the gun lobby in the current bloodbath. Get that gun and go hunt. No problem. But stop making it easy for mentally incompetent folks to get guns.

@krassenstein They want the Second amendment to be a free-for-all, unlimited, 24 hr, no-holds-barred buffet. That‚Äôs the crux of the matter. It‚Äôs not about guns and they know it. The radical notion of a gun for everyone, no matter how crazy, is what most reasonable people oppose.

@RedPilledinNY @Cid_Vivar OK then. Let‚Äôs make sure that ball due support-penalties and sanctions- to enforce the laws. But let‚Äôs make sure that poison pills are not attached to unrelated legislation that water down/sabotage gun legislation that is already in the books.
@RedPilledinNY @Cid_Vivar Reporting is fine, but we cannot just let this whole sordid case be about a missed report by a not too diligent FBI. How about also passing laws to proactively shut down/minimize the possibility of such tragedies with sensible legislation? Why do gunners not even try/sabotage?
Just had a burst of flash: Donald Trump, Mark Pence, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Laura Ingraham are munching popcorn and sipping sodas as they enjoy a movie night at the White House with Black Panther. 	‚ÄúWakanda forever,‚Äù they bellow, hi 5s and fist bumps all around.
Russia-not some drunken bum belching vodka fumes but the entire Russian state security and intelligence apparatus- fought tooth and nail to defeat Hillary and elect Trump. And Trump won! Yet people still insist that Russia‚Äôs efforts did not impact the elections. How come? Stop it
@RedPilledinNY My friend, I absolutely disagree with you on this contention. So let‚Äôs agree to disagree and meet to debate another day. Cheers.
@RedPilledinNY I don‚Äôt know @RedPilledinNY. Adding more guns in schools, albeit in the hands of seasoned professionals, may not be the best solution to the gun epidemic. What if the hired security loses his mind and starts shooting straight in the hallways. Stuff happens in school, you know.
@RedPilledinNY Nope, it is not a question of ‚Äúit just didn‚Äôt work.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt work because the NRA and it‚Äôs legislators in Congress are hellbent on never letting it succeed. After those innocent babies were slaughtered by that deranged man in Sandy Hook, I thought things would change. Sadly no!
@RedPilledinNY And oh let‚Äôs don‚Äôt forget that an executive orderTrump signed last year, with great relish and flourish, is blocking the rule that stops people with mental illness from purchasing guns. His budget also slashed funding for Medicaid, responsible for 25% of mental health treatment.
@RedPilledinNY There are hundreds of legislative proposals- background checks, mental illness red alert, stopping military-style assault weapons, modifying rifles with bump stocks to fire faster, as the killer in Las Vegas did- that were either killed or weakened by the gun lobby in Congress.
@FoxNews Nope!	It compounds Fox‚Äôs image problem...and the shrill, stringent, and radical gun crazies it hosts and promotes daily.
@Thomas1774Paine Go away, Marco. Until you call for the investigation of the gun lobby that bought your with $3 million, please just go away.
@RedPilledinNY The FBI dropped the ball big time, but why condemn them and yet give a pass to the people who constantly block commonsense legislation that could have prevented this massacre in the first place

I am in awe of our politicians. They go to blows over billions in kids‚Äô insurance and healthcare for poor folks and then gleefully spend six trillions in places called Afghanistan and Iraq. MAGA!
@thehill I agree. Please don‚Äôt unfairly criticize the Secretary or else she will get her brother, the mercenary millionaire man, to beat you up. What‚Äôs his name again? Prince... no not the Purple Deceased. The other one with the sharp military crew cut.
@RandPaul All these principles, Senator, and yet you uncritically helped blow a trillion dollar hole with that tax law. Smh.
@SenBobCorker @GMA4Trump_ @realDonaldTrump Oh Senator, you got me all whipsawed! One day you are a hero Superman of reason, fiscal discipline and principled opposition to Trumpzilla‚Äôs neurotic flaying. The next day, you are an eager supplicant and cheerleader. What happened? Lol.
@NoahPollak Lol, I picture you with a monocle and a Sherlock Holmes hat, sniffing around and tasting soil, looking for any insult- real and imagined- against Israel. Respect, hehe. But please leave Merkel out of it. She is not an anti-Semite. And take a chill pill bro.
@alanhe @NoahPollak The senator is a hater. Why shouldn‚Äôt we have a parade to show the world our trillion dollar military? Trump deserves a parade. Just give him a funny little mustache, a uniform, and let him rant for hours at the parade like that little fella in Europe back in the day.
@NoahPollak So? And I am supposed to feel sorry for Nikki Haley? Puleeze. All she has being doing at the UN is advocate for the nuclear annihilation of North Korea and killing diplomacy.
@GovMikeHuckabee @POTUS @realDonaldTrump And your graceless dig at McCain, Gov Huckabee, is one reason you too will never play your out-of-tune banjo in the Ocal Office. Hehe.
@realDonaldTrump I love our fat, jolly, tweeting president. Hehehe.
@SenatorLankford You are playing Trump‚Äôs game, Senator. This divide-and-destroy tactic that the president has honed so well to divide people, institutions and demographics is not worthy of your genuflecting. You can afford to stand up to wrong and still get elected.

@EricTrump Prince Eric, your paltry 2.6% is underwhelming. Trying to talk it up is like attempting to raise the dead. Watch out now, the stock market bubble will soon burst.
@ralphreed Lol!	Why do my Repub friends always try hard to exacerbate differences: white vs black, southern strategy vs the big, bad liberal collective, bring in the wife and kids or throw momma under the bus. Incredible!
@ornellasuad Congrats. Now they dare not sneer at you.
@RepGutierrez I can see our president with a gun pointed at the Democrats: ‚ÄúMy wall or the dreamers who were brought here as kids!‚Äù
@JarredMattingl3 @RepGutierrez @realDonaldTrump Pray m, how much is this money of yours that you are talking about? Dollar figure please.
@tilo_v @RepGutierrez Please crawl back under the rock.
@SenatorCardin So many people have sullied the sanctity of the holocaust, including some of our own leaders, and Netanyahu and his gang of right wingers, that decent people the world over are aghast.
@realDonaldTrump America‚Äôs economic revival? Lol!!	Obama took over when the economy was bloodied and bowdlerized and heimplemented policies that lost his party the House but saved the economy. You were bequeathed an economy that was humming quite nicely with millions of jobs added and strong.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Oh this president of ours. Never a dull day with him.
@RepBrendanBoyle God bless her.
@RepBrendanBoyle Something is going on with the Republicans. The way they‚Äôve been acting, I‚Äôm beginning to think that they lace their opioids with crack. I‚Äôm just saying...
@RepBrendanBoyle And you are a congressman? Hehehe. What state did you come from?
@helpsintl_dan @VP @govsambrownback @StateDept I can just picture Jesus running away from your embrace. Lol
@AlphaWolfrey @brevityco @VP @govsambrownback @StateDept Did you read the news snout the kids in that schools in Kentucky? I‚Äôm just saying.....
@VP @govsambrownback @StateDept I wonder....how many Vice Presidents are there that never got to become president? I‚Äôm just saying...
@HenrySumhenry @SenatorLankford I agree. Secure the border and lock them out. But please just make sure that you don‚Äôt go out to mess with other folks in other countries. We stay in our country and they stay in theirs. No Iraq, Afghanistan, North Korea, Tijuana or Canada. Wouldn‚Äôt that be nice?
@LenientScrutiny @SenatorLankford @GlomarNeverDies Hehehe
@Cubz9 @SenatorLankford Nice. I saw the same rant on Fox.
@SenatorLankford 25 billion dollars down payment on a wall?	Bring in your spouse and kids but the parents? Tough luck.
@SenatorLankford I wonder what Senator Lankford ‚Äòs position really is.
@scottcped @SenatorLankford @JJ_Mitch2 Pray tell how you have been paying for them. If you think really hard, you will find that to be a myth.
@VP @realDonaldTrump Wouldn‚Äôt it be neat if we the heroic American people take a page from the Iranian masses and resist the twisted, mentally deranged regime of the paranoid Twit on Twitter? I‚Äôm just saying.......
@TapasMagazine @realDonaldTrump @SpainMediaES I want to use this image in my book. How do I get permission for it please?
@SenatorLankford @MeetThePress Correction: Liberal Democrat I am.
@SenatorLankford @MeetThePress Let‚Äôs break Democrat I am, but Labkford doesn‚Äôt seem doctrinaire or crazy. Will vote and campaign for him.
@SenatorLankford @MeetThePress I just saw the @SenatorLankford interview on WNBC New York. Most impressive. Cool, calm and intelligent. Future president!!!
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Oh dear!	Sick people? What sick people? Let them eat tax cuts for the toppers!
@ABC And what did the bro do? He didn‚Äôt wipe the nationalist‚Äôs pooper with the stars and bars?
@RussellNMercer @MichellesDude @SenSchumer @seagal_lori @realDonaldTrump Yep, we have elections- tainted by Putinistas.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Tall order Senator. He ain‚Äôt gonna stop. And now he has 289 characters!
@diddy I tried to heal myself but my body said naaaah, you are toast, bro.
@RonWyden Well it‚Äôs because the rich are getting poorer and the fat Middle Class is getting richer.
@YoungEx20 @JuettC @RandPaul I after with you sir!
@labuda_robert @704heather @RandPaul What agenda? To lunatically tweet nukes? Go Rand! You work for Kentucky, not the Trumpstar!
@704heather @RandPaul Wonder Woman!	War is great when?
@RandPaul I bet if there is a resolution in Congress to nuke Pyongyang tomorrow, Lindsay Graham will be as gleeful as a fat kid in a candy store.
@704heather @damartin32 @RandPaul I have never met a person who loves war more than Lindsay Graham
@RandPaul Couldn‚Äôt stop laughing!
RT @RandPaul: You know you are in too many wars in too many places when even warmonger Lindsay Graham can‚Äôt keep track anymore
@NYCMayor The people‚Äôs mayor! Can‚Äôt wait to vote you in again!
@torhyams @NYCMayor Aww, don‚Äôt be like that now. Enjoy the festivities. Diwali is great!
@rihanna Unfortunately, these tragedies will not subside. Congress, in terror of the NRA, will double down on more reckless pro-gun legislation.
@SenSchumer These guns!	These tragedies!	This madness!!
@ABC Haha
