@FisherBurton series of novels.
@FisherBurton and then shipping them around the planet burning some of the worst fuel possible.
@FisherBurton I just think that having fabrication facilities in a place with essentially limitless resources and energy, that can ship to anywhere on the planet by falling down, for very low cost, presents huge advantages over digging things out of the ground, using often caustic chemicals
@FisherBurton I'd also argue his Red Mars, Blue Mars, Green Mars series about terraforming mars is also an excellent novel. 		And we should definitely do both, space isn't an escape, and anywhere we go we're going to have to be better about not fucking it up.
@FisherBurton Like with a single asteroid we could essentially close all pit mines on the planet.		https://t.co/6Qzec6gzHs
@FisherBurton If you want a fully automated society, the automation has to use resources from somewhere, and better up there than down here.
@FisherBurton It's a totally valid concern, but humans are parasites, we're going to keep breeding and consuming, and we need a pressure valve both for our population as we approach the carrying capacity of the planet, if we have not already passed it, but also for our pollution.
@FisherBurton And given starship is projected to do 100 tons for around 10,000,000 per launch vs 20,000,000 for 15 tons using a Falcon 9, it's another order of magnitude improvement, and a crucial step.

@FisherBurton And I don't think the US military purchasing them is a good thing, but it is an inevitable thing, 30 minute point to point anywhere on the planet with a 100 ton cargo payload is too much of a logistical advantage for them to ignore.
@FisherBurton It has, lots of countries that could not previously afford to launch satellites have because of Space X in the last two years, but the falcon 9 was not finalized until late last year, the price reductions should accelerate as a reserve fleet is built up.
@FisherBurton He's dropped the cost of reaching orbit per lb by a factor of 10, something that numerous governments and other companies have tried to do for decades and failed.		And if starship flies one time, the US military will immediately purchase 100 of them.
@FisherBurton I mean, if I was running the government, we would be doing it through NASA, by funding NASA, we've done sort of a shit job of that though, so I'll take Musk in the absence of that reality.
@FisherBurton Tunnel seems like that might be an accurate description, he's already had a dramatic impact on space though, and if starship flies it changes everything, probably for the entire species, forever.
@FisherBurton Yeah, he's problematic, still very much here for the return of space travel, and the foresight to package it nicely.
@FisherBurton Star Wars is space magic, not hard science!		https://t.co/CBFXNOPau6

@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn If that's the only way you have to refute the point that we've clearly fucked things up every time we've interveneed in the last 30 years you're not really arguing in good faith.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn I said who cares in the context of US unilateral action, you want to get the UN to go in on a global peace keeping force, I fully support US soldiers being a part of that process. 		I do not support the invasion of sovereign nations by the US without global consensus.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn No, the level of my humanity is that demonstrably so US intervention has for the last 30 years resulted in the deaths of millions. 		You're saying this time will be different, and I'm saying that you're fucking insane if you think that.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn Dude, the very first sentence in that article.		"The U.S. has long tried to contain the insurgency it was responsible for creating."		You're making my case for me.
@trappist1g Would guess, that like American states that legalized, that problem will go away in a year or two. And that you'll likely have over supply by the end of next summer.

@trappist1g I live in Oregon, and have lived in illegal states, and you will never convince me that unregulated sale is better than regulated sale with clinical testing and screening for Mold and Pesticides.		Never.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn OK, but you literally can't point to a single country we've improved through intervention in the last 30 years, so from my perspective, you are wasting tax payer dollars for negative returns, in a Naive belief that we have moral standing to dictate behavior to other nations.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn Given before our intervention, there were no slave markets, this is not a clear path to our intervention was a good idea. 		And Libya is just one of like 20 countries we've fucked up over the last 3 decades.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn You are not holding up Libya as a success story, I hope.		https://t.co/0t7AAxCsMu
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress And you're intentionally ignoring that the vast majority of the progressive policy platform was a non starter 10 years ago.		I am not disagreeing with you about the current reality, I am disagreeing with you about the potential for that to change.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn We haven't had a regime change war that materially improved conditions on the ground for 30 years, thinking we still have that capacity is a moral failing.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress I think that support across all political spectrums will increase with dialogue about the issue, just like it has for progressive policy plank after plank.		We've been living through a master class in expanding the Overton Window.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn I'm not voting for her, she's not my first or second choice, but again, many people want to hear politicians talking about non interventionism. 		She's it for the time being.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress I believe that people can walk and chew bubblegum. And support for reparations likely drives support for universal programs as well, it's not an either or proposition.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress I think that's a pretty dumb point, which is why I didn't respond to it directly. 		You by the very nature of having the conversation will start convincing everyone.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress You will absolutely never convince anyone by treating it as a third rail.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress things like the GND or Medicare For All, and think, rightly, that it's time we had this conversation as well, and in order for anything to change, it must be had first.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress Have you just not noticed the Overton Window expanding over the last decade?		That's an easier fight than you make it out to be, but it starts with dialogue. I don't think anyone pushing reparations thinks it's something that happens in 2020, I think that they see the success of
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress realized, there is a real social cost to the system we have built, and pretending like there are no negative economic externalities to racial wealth inequality is ridiculous on its face.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress You do it by educating the public about how we wound up in this place, and by making the compelling argument that poverty restricts economic mobility, which ultimately costs society, in terms of kids that never become doctors, or businesses never opened, or inventions never
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress I disagree with that framing, we passed the Americans with Disabilities act, which only helps 1 out of every 5 people because it was the right moral choice.		America is fully capable of doing the moral thing, it just requires leadership.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn Lots of the progressive left like her because she is the only candidate who regularly talks about non interventionism. 		I am funding her campaign just so she gets to the debates, for that sole reason.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress in high school, and I had a black history teacher for AP US History, in a majority black high school in SC. We all have a huge blind spot with regards to how this situation was created, and we need the dialogue to address it.		https://t.co/jFjkcHtHRG
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress inequality that exists on essentially a purely racial level in America, and when you start looking at the historical reasons behind it, it becomes clear that we owe a generational debt.		Hell I didn't even learn about the Tulsa City Race Riot, or the burning of black Wallstreet
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress The argument is that for some 300 odd years, including into the modern era, white society has benefited from the oppression of black society, through literal theft of the benefits of their labor. 		And we as a country are rich as fuck, we shouldn't tolerate the level of wealth
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress is owed to Native Americans, or Puerto Ricans, or those living in Guam. 		And we need to have those conversations too in order to deliver on the promise of a just society, but that conversation has to start somewhere, they have to be able to have it, and they deserve our support.
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress And ultimately any talk of reparations probably ends up with some sort of means tested program to end poverty, but that compromise should come after a dialogue about why reparations should happen, what is owed the black community, and indeed will spawn other debates such as what
@brotherbeat @ActifyPress Here's the thing, lots of the progressive agenda was not particularly popular a decade ago, by denying people interested in seeing reparations happen the floor you are preventing a shift in the Overton Window, their cause is just.
@PeterCorless @JonathanCohn I doubt it, she actually has a core group of fans, while say Gillibrand does not.

@MarvinKey74 @Zebop @tomwatson I'd also point out that Pelosi is just two heartbeats, or one Mueller investigation, depending on who you listen to, away from the Presidency, and has basically told voters to fuck off re: her taxes, and she has something like 30 times Sanders net worth.		https://t.co/AbNbu0J7bC

@NeverLiberals @mcm_ct Are you unaware that marijuana has heavy taxes in every state that has legalized it? And that indeed tax revenue is often cited as the reason for legalizing it? And that many states require a portion of those taxes to go to various forms of healthcare?

@MarvinKey74 @Zebop @tomwatson @paulajean2020 It mostly has to do with having watched how tv networks populated by millionaires owned by billionaires treat progressive candidates.

@Zebop @MarvinKey74 @tomwatson Because the whole formulation of "real democrat" is varsity team bullshit that is used to obfuscate the fact that most of the party is objectively terrible.		83% of the party supports Medicare For All, but not Pelosi, Schumer or Perez.

@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica For every dollar tax payers sent to private insurance, they are getting less in return than they would from a public insurer.		Treating people should not be a profit center, and spending government money should not be an excuse for waste.
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica Medicare For America also allows publicly subsidized private plans. It allows private insurers to sell plans in a market place ala the ACA, these plans would be subsidized at lower income tiers, just like medicare advantage today.		https://t.co/SRXKYdyT91
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica From the article:		"it would allow insurers to offer those plans to non-seniors as well.""		These plans, like plans in the ACA would be subsidized at lower income levels. And given 15 cents of every dollar spent is wasted, that's a bad use of tax payer money.
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica I'm not talking about employer based policies, although they arguably could still be subsidized under this language if the recipient was under a certain income threshold, Medicare For America allows private insurers to sell plans directly to Americans.
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica This is what the ACA did to healthcare in America, and that transfer of wealth from tax payers to shareholders was theft. 		Helping sick people should not be a profit center. https://t.co/0wGiDYhgdn
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica These companies lobby congress with money taken from tax payers in the form of subsidies to make our national healthcare system worse, every year. 		I want to cut off their money, and increase the efficiency of healthcare at the same time.
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica I have, I obviously want to get rid of private insurers, they provide negative value to the healthcare system to the tune of 15%.

@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica And worst of all, you still don't get the 15% savings for getting rid of private insurers. 		It's bad legislation, that's only being introduced because there is energy in the country to end the grifting of insurance companies once and for all.		https://t.co/lK0wakjXYh
@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica and it would allow insurers to offer those plans to non-seniors as well."

@BCarniello @fxzkz @TVietor08 @jonfavs @rgunns @PodSaveAmerica "“Medicare for America” would not only allow employers to keep offering private plans.

@adamkotsko I mean the GOP just got rid of it to manage supreme court justices, and no one claimed that was some sort of out of bounds issue. 		Ultimately I think a lot of people in the party probably see the filibuster as their last ditch resort to get rid of Medicare For All or Green New
@adamkotsko Really they should all be running on overturning the senate filibuster and a new judiciary act.		You can completely change the entire federal judiciary system with a single majority vote in congress, and since it hasn't been done since the 19th century, it's long overdo.

@CrookedCopmala They absolutely all will be, but that was an unforced error, and it was in an empty news cycle, it was like she had run internal polling that said it was a liability for her in the general, they brain stormed how to deal with it and came up with that.		She could have just said it

Lol, we all know who that person is, and their name is Bernie Sanders, not Elizabeth Warren.		I welcome her contributions to the debate, and moving policy leftwards, but she doesn't have the grassroots network to pull it off, and has completely bungled handling Trump. https://t.co/iyYlaiFJz1

@JohnQPublic100 @mattyglesias He's also responsible for the student loan debt bubble, the crime bill, likely doesn't support legalizing marijuana or medicare for all, and in the era of #MeToo his treatment of Anita Hill should be disqualifying for all Dems, but more so for people under 50.

@AllenJB12 @ViscResponse @hollylecraw @summerbrennan Didn't say you were, I was just saying this line of attack against him is a pretty shallow one, and one that there are other people in the field, like Joe Biden for instance, who are much more deserving.
@stoyanovstoyan2 @BsAuntie @markos Warren is worth something like 10 times what Sanders is worth, way more potential for nefariousness. 		That said I look forward to him releasing his returns as well.  If only so I never have to hear this talking point again.

@reesetheone1 @KAMALAMODE @travestynv @raibooker03 Harris ranking in 2 years in which none of her vote matters is essentially meaningless. 		Her record as a prosecutor and AG are much more meaningful, and well not good. 		Sanders in contrast has a record of saying the same shit for 30 years.

And it's not a stupid label, it's a description of governing philosophy.
@JacksonvilleTom @reesetheone1 If I cry it will be for the country, and not for Sanders. 		Just as he's running for us, and not for himself.

@MsHum1970 @tomwatson Yes, I'm sure that's why Tom's feed is constant bashing of Sander's supporters, because he is confident of what's going to happen at the polls, and not sweating, even a little.

@EricM90990338 Tulsi is not my first choice, I doubt though that Markos actually thinks any of those things, and is much more put out by her bucking the DNC and her continued opposition to the MIC.
Also guessing this for whatever reason doesn't include Tulsi Gabbard. Seems what Markos really means is that he wants a candidate who represents his personal donor base. Not the base of the party.		https://t.co/gicbpdnKBK

I don't particularly trust anything coming out of RT, but then I also don't particularly trust anything coming out of legacy press organizations staffed by CIA and FBI officials either, seems like a bad day for journalism. https://t.co/p96CgmfYPw
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast There are shitty people on the internet, full stop, but the idea of the "Bernie Bro" is campaign agit prop by people who did not care what splitting the party on racial or gender lines would do to the party, and have not cared for more than a decade.
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast I'm offended because I know that it's a legacy of the race baiting campaign that Clinton ran against Obama in 2008, literally promulgated by the same journalists. 		https://t.co/sZ8sV882R4
@Emhoward2210 @SeavernsGuy @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast Amazon, specifically reached out to Sanders, to assure him that no workers would lose money after concerns about it were raised. 		If you have evidence they lied I'd love to see it. 		https://t.co/CdHj9Q70pU

He never starts with political expediency, but will wind up there to compromise, the rest of the pack starts with a weak position in the center and wonders why they end up on the right.
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast The ACA does, so would Clintons plan from the 90's. This is a healthcare ETF tracking insurance companies, something happened in 2009, can't quite place my finger on it. 		And all that wealth going to shareholders, flowed from the US government and tax payers. https://t.co/7CInxKF9yf
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast It would have absolutely been better than what we got between then and the ACA, which is also terrible legislation, but it's a third way private public partnership that is at its core a bad deal for tax payers.
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast No, no it isn't. Plans that subsidize private insurers operate as theft from tax payers, returning significantly less per dollar than a single payer or medicare for all system would. 		https://t.co/lK0wakjXYh
@Emhoward2210 @SeavernsGuy @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast And I'll always wonder, like Senator Warren, if this is what happened to her.

@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast Also, Sanders has gotten a LOT done in 30 years, from the largest VA overhaul in 50 years to thousands of amendments. 		If you take a simplified view of his record you can kind of make that claim, but it doesn't really hold up under scrutiny. 		https://t.co/oXUeM699b0
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast I was talking about people directly employed in the industry, talking about it in GDP is pointless, his constituents elected him, not the percentage of the GDP, his constituents still want affordable healthcare and to be able to pay their bills more than they care about profits.
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast And thanks, see, now we've found some common ground. Isn't talking about policy much better than baseless party ID attacks?		We've made progress.
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast And Harris is going to have a hard time because things like "Covering for the catholic church pedophile scandal" don't ever poll well. 		That's kind of on her. 		More or less agree on Booker, but those industries still make up less than 20% of his state.
@SeavernsGuy @Emhoward2210 @chrislongview @IanSams @thedailybeast Sanders in the last year has gotten raises for Disney Workers, Amazon Workers, and passed a bipartisan bill to end the war in Yemen in the senate, with a Republican House, Senate, and White House.

@RocheStrategies @daviddoel There's a lot you could do, like direct the DOD to aggressively invest in renewables, maybe even make bases provide power to locals in foreign countries, would be worth a hell of a lot more good will than bombs. 		But ultimately you do need congress for a lot of it.
@belle_joyeux Agreed, I was just really trying to reach for something.
@BethLynch2020 @RichardHasse @gregolear @BernieSanders Absolutely, GOTV is always a giant part of any campaign, my point was just that there is a real opportunity to make Florida blue after the felony law was overturned, and it would be dumb to stop organizing there.
@proviewsusa @noreallyhowcome @MemberBernie And I believe it's actually closer to like 54.5%, but I'd have to go do some research as I don't know the exact number off hand, it's more than a simple majority though.
@proviewsusa @noreallyhowcome @MemberBernie No one is getting to 50%, there will definitely be multiple ballots, just like there was in 2016 and 2008.
@RocheStrategies @daviddoel nothing, particularly if we have a progressive president.
@RocheStrategies @daviddoel Absolutely, and they should because we need to reform the federal judiciary system, which they can do with a simple majority vote as well.		And even though the GOP has been blowing up political norms for years, I'm sure we'll get a lot of hand wringing about policy reasons to do
@RichardHasse @BethLynch2020 @gregolear @BernieSanders None of those states had 12% of their adult population, with about 80% of that being left leaning, barred from participating in the electoral process until 2018.		Florida is a huge potential solid blue state moving forward.

@ihatethemedia @TheDemocrats Yes, having laws that purge voter rolls is also insane, those aren't foreign nationals, they're just people who aren't that involved in the process, and wanting to kick them off voter rolls is antithetical to the idea of Democracy.
@cajansona It's my version of "you're wrong about this, and lots of other people, who fit the narrow lane of people you are allowing to have a say on this, feel the same way. "

@cajansona I'm not judging her authenticity, I'm commenting on what her press secretary thought was notable to share with the national audience.
@IamJustinJordan Not when your national press secretary is tweeting it out, calling out the hot sauce explicitly.		Then it's politics.
@IamJustinJordan Nothing, absolutely nothing, the issue is why do you think her white male press secretary who worked for HRC, during 2016, thought it was notable to tweet out, specifically calling attention to the hot sauce. 		He clearly thought there was a political value add there.
@tryn2be_atpeace @biloxichoctaw I'm not a fan of these empty stunts from Sanders either, but I don't think you could describe what he did as an attempt to pander to any minority base, except maybe fans of crankbox music in their 80s.
Well this is wildly problematic. https://t.co/VbYozwe4dt
@Blacklitmustest @salemp @gray_jedi_ @petersongeorged who was involved in similar stuff for Hillary Clinton in 2016. 		It's an incredibly cynical approach to politics, and one that I find distasteful.
@Blacklitmustest @salemp @gray_jedi_ @petersongeorged I'm not policing blackness, kamala harris, is black, she is treated as if she is black by Americans, no amount of green will change the color of her skin for those who have prejudices. 		I am and have been since the very begging critiquing her press secretary, who is a white guy
@tryn2be_atpeace @biloxichoctaw I was referencing it because he was involved in the Clinton campaign, and that's a thing Clinton did to try to appeal to voters. 		Kamala's campaign is doing the same empty pr that lost the last election.		https://t.co/CTidaj6d63
@darcyjae @SuperstarrSarah @lowetze1 Her campaign is clearly worried about that idea, her press secretary, the author of this tweet, also sent this tweet out just a few days ago.		And people questioning her blackness are dicks, but that doesn't change that her campaign sees it as an issue.		https://t.co/osgA6slCgd
@andrerucker51 @SenKamalaHarris but ultimately twitter is a garbage place for these interactions, and I would have been making a better choice to leave those reactions to other black people, of which there are many already out there.
@andrerucker51 @SenKamalaHarris I really wasn't trying to attack her blackness, just draw attention to the fact that her white press secretary was repeating the mistakes of 2016. 		I can definitely understand though why it would bother people to hear that coming from a white guy. I still think it's worth saying
@MJohnsonFTW I mean it's personal preference, but my house was always a pepper vinegar house.
@MadLaserGaming @RobinAnderson15 Not doubting her blackness, people who do that are dicks. Particularly if they're white. 		Questioning the motivations behind her press secretary, a white guy, thinking this tweet was relevant.
@michele5411 @DanteAtkins The party would flip out, but honestly breaking it up into actual leftists and corporate centrists is maybe long term what is healthiest for the country, it would be a rough transition though.
@tryn2be_atpeace @biloxichoctaw The commentary is on her press secretaries twitter choices, not her food choices, which I agree, are pretty dumb and should be out of bounds.		Her national press secretary, a white guy, is who thought this was relevant.
@Bri_n_Jay86 @Shue_Box I really don't care what sauce she's using, the issue is with her press secretary not her, as I staked out hours before this tweet went viral. 		https://t.co/CTidaj6d63
@tupadreway Absolutely, total boil of a man, this shit was racist as hell when he did it.
@actionpollock So is her press secretary that thought that tweeting this image was a good idea.
@samfan01 I do realize it, I have no problem with the use of hot sauce, her white male press secretary thinking it was a good idea to tweet an image, specifically calling attention to it, after working for HRC in 2016, is another issue.
@mpbreen21 @IDreamOnDemand I specifically singled out her white male press secretary who worked for HRC, hours before this tweet went viral. 		And it is distasteful when any politician does it, as I have said elsewhere in this thread, including Sanders.
@jfresh888 I do not, she is black. End of story.
@mpbreen21 @paulheaston Sanders didn't lose a general, but there is certainly a lot to critique about his last campaign.
@MrQuanSolo Why why would i tell you to fuck up potato salad like that?
@IamJustinJordan I grew up in SC, collards are one of the first things I can ever remember eating.
@mamabranch Her press secretary, who worked for HRC in 2016, who is a white male, thinking it was a good idea to tweet out.
@RDRinMotion @Shue_Box @KamalaHarris Why do you think her press secretary thought it was notable?
@sjs856 I have no opinion on how anyone eats their food, hot sauce is a great condiment, collards are great.		I do however have an opinion on why her WHITE MALE press secretary thought it was notable to call attention to.
@FeleciaPoitier Her white male press secretary who tweeted the image out, and worked for HRC is definitely trying to pander to black voters. 		Her blackness is not in question, and people who are debating that are dicks, she looks black, she is treated as black, she is black, end of story.
@strawman_army I both know what collards are and how to eat them, the issue is with her white male press secretary tweeting this image out, directly drawing attention to the hot sauce, did you miss 2016?
@sjs856 I believe the white male press secretary who tweeted this out is pandering yes.		I really don't care how Kamala eats anything, and firmly believe she likes hot sauce, doesn't change what her press secretary did by tweeting it, drawing attention to the fact, did you miss 2016?
@RKing904 I don't know how black people should act, I am specifically taking her WHITE MALE press secretary to task.		https://t.co/CTidaj6d63

@hrobertson1 The issue is not her enjoying hot sauce, it's a great condiment, the issue is her white male press secretary who worked for Clinton thinking it was a good idea to tweet an image of it out, specifically calling attention to the hot sauce.
@Deficit_Hawk I'll never vote for her because of her corrupt connections in the party, including to former Clinton campaign staff, people in the Hamptons aren't my allies, I'm way to poor for that.		https://t.co/8aGNLBWK8e
@cajansona If you can't see the problem with her white press secretary tweeting out hot sauce in a week in which her campaign has been doing damage control around her "blackness" i can't make you, but it's far more cynical than me pointing it out.

@andrerucker51 @SenKamalaHarris I'm not questioning her blackness, she is black, that shit is out of bounds.		People in America see her as black, which means she is treated as if she is black, no amount of green will ever erase that. 		I'm pointing out that her white ass press secretary is pandering.
@phligirl The pander is not the use of hot sauce, it's her white ass press secretary thinking that tweeting it was a good idea.

@SantiFarrakhan @MarchetteStamps And for the record, people attacking her blackness are being ridiculous, she's black, end of story. 		He's right to push back against that narrative, he's wrong to use hot sauce as part of it.
@SantiFarrakhan @MarchetteStamps Why do you think he thought it was notable? It's his job to manage her interactions with the press, what message do you think he was sending?		He literally worked for Clinton during her hot sauce episode, do you think he did not know what he was doing?

@MarginalCall @benyankee @jesseltaylor Why do you think her press secretary tweeted the image? His timeline is an entire weeks worth of him doing damage control over questions about her blackness.
@TheMezcalJones @OjPats4 @KAMALAMODE She may well, it doesn't change the fact that her press secretary thought there was value to tweeting the image, he clearly though there was something to be gained by promulgating it.
@darylsturgis @petersongeorged That is absolutely pandering, and they should stop doing it.
@MarginalCall @benyankee @jesseltaylor I went to sleep and woke up to that reality, my account doesn't really have the reach to make things viral on my own.
@BidMake There are quite a few female politicians that I regularly support, although I am critical of all politicians, Warren, AOC, Omar, Barbara Lee, Pramilla Jaypal, they all regularly kick ass even if I don't always support individual decisions they make.
@outandaboutjc1 This piffle was sent out by her national press secretary, they're making all the same mistakes Clinton did in 2016.		It's relevant.
@gwangung @Shue_Box That's great. Feel free to not be on my timeline then.		Have a nice day!
@outandaboutjc1 Because it speaks to who is running her campaign, and in case you forgot 2016, they're not good at it.
@RobinAnderson15 Mustard sauce is the worst of all the Carolina bbq sauces, and was popularized by Maurices, a racist restaurant that still flew the confederate flag when I left the state. 		Vinegar all the way.
@gwangung @Shue_Box no?
@jazz593 Absolutely, which is why her national press secretary tweeting it out isn't about what she's having for dinner.		And this is obvious.
@BethLynch2020 60% of all gun deaths are caused by suicide too, that means in his statistic 60 people shot themselves, while 40 were shot by others. 		The gun crisis is really a mental health crisis in hiding. A thing Medicare For All would actually help address.

@mgganimal @JoeVoe_ Holy shit, that's a true statement, much cringe. 		https://t.co/Ol9drCCoWh
@benyankee @jesseltaylor My tweet is more viral than her press secretaries, so I'd say I'm doing alright with this whole exchange.
@RobinAnderson15 I'm also from SC, and you eat it with the pepper vinegar, which is on the table behind her, the texas pete is for the BBQ. 		And I have no objections to her enjoying a delicious meal, the objection is with the pandering on the topic.
@TSBigMoney I really enjoy that tweet from Leah because she's retweeting me behind a block, which is a TOS violation, while also implying I'm a racist and a misogynist because I pointed out a clear case of pandering. 		Bonus points, neera in her thread bragging about blocking me.
@RioSlade I'd try some agar agar or xanthum gum to gel it up, will probably take a few tries to get the consistency right, but should be able to do it with those without affecting flavor.
@jesseltaylor It's her white press secretary who is the author of the pander, a pander he also used while employed by Clinton. 		https://t.co/CTidaj6d63
@thejollycrank Yes, I'm sure her national press secretary was tweeting it out because he thought it was a totally organic moment and it was in no way calculated.		It's not like that's his job or anything.

@Wharfrat2004 @FrostySumo @MarchetteStamps I like how Sander's supporters have substantive criticism of other politicians, and that centrists simply do not.
@ghost_ready No, which is why I can tell when people are pandering.
@ghost_ready She can eat whatever the hell she wants, why do you think her white press secretary thought it was notable and worth tweeting about?
@MsWolverines Me: substantive criticism of a candidate using links to their own website.		You: unsubstantiated claims of racism and sexism to shut down debate. https://t.co/QkWDHk9KG3
@MsWolverines I don't care at all about her use of hot sauce, i care that she's been running for a month and still doesn't have any policies listed. 		I point out the hot sauce because it is relevant to the fact that she is running an empty campaign.		https://t.co/ZpLV4UtsSa
@ghost_ready I'm from SC, and pointing out that her white press secretary is engaging in pandering is not racist.
@MsWolverines White dude pointing out her very white press secretary is using the hot sauce to pander. 		FTFY.

@Chereenzaki Heck yeah, all delicious. 		I'd take politicians just supporting @IlhanMN over that though.
@petersongeorged She didn't do anything wrong, the issue is with her press secretary using a photo of her eating to pander. 		A thing the exact same dude, was involved in doing with Hillary Clinton.		A campaign that you may remember ultimately lost to Trump.
@LittleHarshGab @MargueriteEHill @BuckwheatS @zapemded None of which is even remotely comparable to musing that your opponent might be assassinated.
@Wharfrat2004 @FrostySumo @MarchetteStamps He's going to set new fundraising totals in a few weeks when he announces. 		I'll remember this tweet so I can update you then.

@Emhoward2210 You'll be shocked when you learn that #ADOS is an explicitly black movement.
@MargueriteEHill @BuckwheatS @zapemded @LittleHarshGab He did more events for Clinton than she did for Obama, and more of his voters voted for her than her voters voted for Obama, and she literally said she was staying in the 2008 primary because Obama might be shot ala RFK.

@nectarina12 @evanvwk @renegademom @lowetze1 She's running for president, she doesn't get a pass because of her gender.
@publicola05 @maryforrest I'm sure it's that and has nothing to do with capping off a week in which her campaign tried to appeal to black voters, after stepping in it re: marijuana and hip hop.

@gwiech @TheWayWithAnoa Which is why she'd lose support, because it would clearly be a nakedly opportunistic choice on her part, aimed more at her own political career than on helping Americans.		It's the same reason the left cooled on Warren in 2016.
@gwiech @TheWayWithAnoa I disagree, she'll lose a lot of support if she fails to endorse Sanders, and will ideally be there at his announcement.		She doesn't owe him anything, but there's clearly no one else running that supports her brand of politics.
@ScarletM1926 @Bakari_Sellers @amyklobuchar That's definitely not true, and regardless of anything else, it's a factual statement that she has the highest staff turnover rate in the senate.

@oatesfan @PortlandPolice Well for one, I'm drawing attention to it right here, on this tweet, and you're engaging on it.
@gatoconbootas23 @oatesfan @PortlandPolice Yep, you should absolutely still be punished, you should not be punished to the same degree as driving while drunk.		Diito for intoxication on a bicycle vs: a car.
@oatesfan @PortlandPolice The preponderance of evidence from actual studies trying to quantify the risk:		https://t.co/333Qrqkoha
@oatesfan @PortlandPolice And we should change DUI laws for bicycles for the same reason, it's ridiculous that we treat them the same way we treat automobiles when the systemic risk is much lower.
@oatesfan @PortlandPolice I absolutely don't do it, because it is a stupid idea, does't change the fact that the laws are written to maximize profits for the police department, and are not based in any scientific understanding of risk.
@PortlandPolice While you shouldn't do this, it would be great if laws on this topic were based on science and not fear.		Driving while high is less dangerous than driving while tired, and it's absolutely less dangerous than driving drunk.		The laws should be changed to reflect this reality.

@belle_joyeux @mediumvillain @deathbymonkies And I say this as someone who is from SC a state where that sort of retail politics just isn't done.
@belle_joyeux @mediumvillain @deathbymonkies Republicans restrict access to the ballot, they don't canvas.
@RosettaDrone Well I'm definitely in the sin taxes should apply to beef and soda camp, but we're probably alone there.
@belle_joyeux @mediumvillain @deathbymonkies Yes, you simply can't reach the same number of people that you can with access to MSM.		Which doesn't mean that you shouldn't do both, but the gatekeepers are the real problem here, not the people of West Virginia or other red states.
@RosettaDrone Which is why I said the way to do it is by raising the minimum age one year at a time so that kids born in some year will never legally be able to purchase it, and I'd be fine with keeping it legal, let people grow their own.		Unlike marijuana, no one is going to.
@RosettaDrone has lots of long term health benefits, and with a move to Medicare For All we should also be trying to have a healthier population, ending tobacco use is part of that.
@RosettaDrone Right, but tobacco doesn't even really have a high, the sense of satisfaction that you get from it is your body returning to normal from the state of anxiety induced by addiction. 		It's a massive public health problem, and lots of research shows that restricting access for kids
@RosettaDrone I have zero problems with this, but the way to do it is by raising the minimum smoking age year over year, so that say people who are 10 will never be able to buy tobacco. 		Tobacco isn't even a good drug.
@JJ85987000 @010_10_101 @rtyson82 I'd argue Sanders has much better foreign policy than the rest of the government / party and has for decades, where it's bad it's because he is too timid, see Venezuela or Palestine.
@dlkingauthor He is more popular with minority women than straight white men, indeed straight white men are his worst favorability group in poll after poll.

@belle_joyeux @mediumvillain @deathbymonkies Winning a low turnout house race in population dense NYC with less than 30,000 total votes in the primary is not the same thing as winning a senate race in rural WV with more than 150,000 votes.

@CapShower @LeftwardSwing @GeoffMiami @ZerlinaMaxwell A number i've never debated, doesn't change the fact that she was not the party nominee until Super Delegates voted at the DNC convention because she failed to reach the required pledged delegate count in the primaries.

@scruffchick You might want to go look at things like global perception of the US when democrats are in power, or the stock market under Democratic vs GOP Presidents, or even the big ones like who was at 1600 on 9/11.		You're going to be shocked by what you discover.
@TheBrandonMorse I didn't say that you did, but your two tweets clearly conflate BDS with antisemitism, and you definitely know what you're doing.
@socdemnow @laughingcat2016 @ARSLovesAnimals @MasterOboewan @JaySchiffman Anything that leaves them intact leads to them coming back to fight another day.
@CapShower @LeftwardSwing @GeoffMiami @ZerlinaMaxwell She won the nomination because she reached the required delegate count after supers voted for her at the convention.		This is a matter of public record. You're embarrassing yourself.
@TheBrandonMorse You're welcome buddy, we're gonna get you healthcare even if you don't think you deserve it.
@TheBrandonMorse BDS is a first amendment issue, so if you are bringing up BDS to attack people you are bringing up first amendment issues.		Each and every time. 		And the whole country needs a rage outlet, for me it's twitter, and yelling at people responsible for our national discourse.
@ruetenik @medeabenjamin I don't know, even right wing Justices tend to treat the 1st amendment as paramount. 		But we are living in fucked up times.
@TheBrandonMorse Nah, the march of time, and millennials and Gen Z are going to save the world. 		We just need most of the right to die off, which they are thankfully doing at an accelerating pace.
@CapShower @LeftwardSwing @GeoffMiami @ZerlinaMaxwell Which I've never debated, but you tried to claim that Hillary won the nomination without the help of supers, which is flatly false. 		And is a matter of the historical record, as well as relatively simple arithmetic.
@socdemnow @laughingcat2016 @ARSLovesAnimals @MasterOboewan @JaySchiffman I think Sanders would after a knock down drag out fight at the very end capitulate because it helps people.		He sure as shit wouldn't do it before the fight begins.
@TheBrandonMorse You guys can't meme, or even do a back handed insult properly.		It's a sad state of affairs on the right.

@TheBrandonMorse I'm sure you understand the distinction, but have a job whipping mouth breathers into a froth on a daily basis, and have no option other than to conflate things that are not the same in service of your paymasters.

@CapShower @LeftwardSwing @GeoffMiami @ZerlinaMaxwell Which is not a thing I have ever disputed.		However HRC absolutely did not become the nominee until the DNC convention, at which point her unpledged delegates, ie: superdelegates, gave her the remaining votes she needed to become the nominee.
@CapShower @LeftwardSwing @GeoffMiami @ZerlinaMaxwell It is absolutely true, are you not aware of how the DNC nomination process works or just not remembering reality properly?
@CapShower @LeftwardSwing @GeoffMiami @ZerlinaMaxwell He entered the last race with 3% name recognition and Clinton, who started with 100% name recognition, still needed supers to get to the required delegate count, but go off.
@socdemnow @laughingcat2016 @ARSLovesAnimals @MasterOboewan @JaySchiffman She said she would accept other options, meaning she has, before the first primary, already compromised on that vision. 		We're going to need a much stronger fighter to take on the insurance industry.

@redmondlonghorn @joshtpm @ThirdWayKessler In a properly run Medicare For All program supplemental insurance should be essentially useless except for procedures not approved by NIH as being effective. 		But it would obviously be a vast change in the degree to which they had funds to lobby.
@AsInMarx @joshtpm @ThirdWayKessler requires a lot of administrative overhead for the back and forth that NIH research shows to be close to 15% of the total cost of healthcare.
@AsInMarx @joshtpm @ThirdWayKessler Yes, that's the same thing, it's saying that hospitals and Doctors spend a crap load of time dealing with billing issues that arise because of our current insurance system. 		You want to get X procedure done, your doctor wants it, your insurer does not, getting that resolved
@redmondlonghorn @joshtpm @ThirdWayKessler Even less humane?		They required laws to force them to cover people with pre-existing conditions, and have made getting any procedure a game of telephone tag between your doctor, hospital and insurer.		They are in the money making business, not the health care business.
@joshtpm @ThirdWayKessler And that's without going into the obvious problem that subsidies that flow to private insurers are then used to lobby to keep healthcare expensive. 		They are a negative value add. 		They have no place in a modern moral society.

@blanarph @agraybee @MsSmartyPanda @davitydave @ORContraCosta Taking care of poor people is definitely the right thing to do, but you shouldn't use that as an excuse to loot state coffers.		And ditto for CHIP, governments shouldn't just be compassionate, they should be judicious with their money.
@blanarph @agraybee @MsSmartyPanda @davitydave @ORContraCosta Medicaid has 10% overhead, medicare 2% overhead, why would you celebrate transferring 8 cents of every dollar to some of the wealthiest people in the world who regularly lobby to make our healthcare shittier for average Americans.

@agraybee @ORContraCosta @davitydave I'm saying that using the fact that they need health insurance to transfer 10% of every dollar spent on healthcare to an insurance company as profit is an explicitly bad deal for tax payers.		You don't have to make wealthy people more wealthy to take care of the sick.
@agraybee @ORContraCosta @davitydave the complete opposite.
@agraybee @ORContraCosta @davitydave Medicaid is a wealth transfer, and abortion access has diminished nationally by a massive amount over the last 30 years of DNC rule.

@agraybee @davitydave @ORContraCosta Refusing to back Northam in the general was an explicitly awesome decision.
@agraybee @ORContraCosta @davitydave You guys all operate under the assumption that anyone with a D next to their name is better than anyone with an R next to their name for the party, and that's just simply not true. 		Having an intact brand is an imperative for taking back control of states and the country.
@agraybee @ORContraCosta @davitydave I think that people like Northam do long term damage to the Democratic brand and that in many cases it would be better to have a GOP candidate as a foil to run against than a Democrat who tarnishes the party reputation.		This seems to be a clear cut example of that.

@davitydave @ORContraCosta @agraybee If you're source policing factual information you're losing the argument.		And you know this.
@agraybee @davitydave @ORContraCosta It's ridiculous that you would try to make a politician that Sanders refused to endorse, and actually campaigned against in the primary a liability for Sanders. 		When Obama, Hillary, Tim Kaine, Booker, and Kamala all actually campaigned for the guy.
@agraybee @davitydave @ORContraCosta Howard Dean's organization, DFA was calling Northam racist during the primary, and refused to endorse him, presumably that colored Sander's and Our Revolution's decision as well, and that was based on 2017 actions of the candidate not his medical school photos.
@ITMFA17 @Spartacussin @sallybhunt Sounds like all of those progressives were right about Northam being a racist, and were right to withhold support, and you centrists really dropped the ball and cocked up politics in the state for the foreseeable future.
@davitydave @ORContraCosta @agraybee I'm not sure why you would think refusing to back a racist candidate, and then later being right about that candidate, is anything other than a boost to his credibility. 		Time and time again he gets it right while the party steps in it.
He's so close to acknowledging that Sander's changed requirements for Democrats in 2016. 		It's gotta be obnoxious as hell to both hate Sanders, and know that he changed the game. 		For me the schadenfreude is delicious though. https://t.co/Jrhr9rE8mX
@joshtpm You guys are going to have such a rude awakening as more and more of the party is taken over by actual leftists. 		We are so done with warmed over corporate gruel masquerading as a whole damn meal.
@NYCityQuaker @FrantzRunnem @IsaacDovere Anyone who is worried about Sander's energy level DID NOT pay attention during 2016.

@EgorkaTK @bootsie5 @SenSanders He didn't defend shit, he talked about why he though Abrams and Gillum had a hard time with white voters, and also said he thought it laid the framework for future runs by other POC, that's not a defense of it, but an acknowledgement of our sad reality.

@TheBrandonMorse Sure it is red state toadie, sure it is.		You guys have zero moral credibility on any issue, including this one.		Evangelicals practicing IVF are one of the drivers of "abortions" nationally.

@tehoriman @dylanlscott From the conclusions section:		"A simplified financing system in the U.S. could result in cost savings exceeding $350 billion annually, nearly 15% of health care spending."
@tehoriman @dylanlscott We spend twice what Canada does per Capita to insure 100% of their population with zero medical bankruptcies, the NIH estimates 15% overnight savings for getting rid of insurers. 		It would demonstrably be cheaper than the status quo.		https://t.co/lK0wakjXYh
@tehoriman @dylanlscott "Would you support an increase in taxes if you had net savings on your healthcare spending?" is obviously going to get very different responses than "Would you support an increase in taxes to create a Medicare For All plan nationally?"
@tehoriman @dylanlscott It doesn't actually do that though, it cons people into thinking that they will have a net increase in taxes with no changes to their out of pocket health care spending, ie: copays and deductibles. 		Most Americans will save money, their question in no way conveys that info.

@mjwatts1983 @dcjanfan @haas84 @reesetheone1 @adamslily That's because wikipedia is not an exhaustive source of information for such things. 		He was however an original cosponsor making this point, one you are wrong about, and incredibly silly. 		https://t.co/I3XKTEmXey
@juniebacabo Yep, just negotiating with him directly in the media to avoid a PR backlash, totally normative behavior toward people you ignore.
@mjwatts1983 @dcjanfan @haas84 @reesetheone1 @adamslily It's almost like he invited a bunch of women to the signing of a piece of legislation aimed at women, a thing known as a photo opp.

@novatoking I was responding to a thread about her backtracking, stating that it was political malpractice in either party.		Put on your reading comprehension hat, english is a beautiful language.
@mjwatts1983 @dcjanfan @haas84 @reesetheone1 @adamslily Yes, that's why it was disappointing to see so many people position Clinton as a champion of women and POC when she refused to support the fight for 15, she was just fine with the most marginalized Americans taking home 20% less pay.
@Fly_Sistah @reesetheone1 The STOP Bezos act was about extracting raises, which he did, and was never actually passed into law...
@juniebacabo Yes, that's why Amazon was negotiating directly with Sanders in the press, because he wasn't at all involved, galaxy brain take there. 		https://t.co/ychaZ1HaOl

@juniebacabo And I have PLENTY of issues with Sanders, he's the compromise candidate.
@juniebacabo Me and apparently every newspaper I linked since they all lead with either his name or an image of him.		Might want to get in touch with their editorial boards and share your disgust.
@RebeccaBuck Imagine thinking that a moderated approach to healthcare reform is what the party base wants in 2018.		Hire Clinton alumni, get bad advice, each and every time.

@cascamike @ThirdWayKessler @CillizzaCNN A Medicare For All plan that actually delivers on its promises probably does involve nationalizing HMOs.		Kaiser Permanente for instance has a monopoly on a lot of west coast services.
@MarkSKrikorian How about we all just agree that Manchin is over, and no news organizations ever platform him again?		That sounds like the best path forward.
@redsteeze 70% of the country, a super majority, supports Medicare For All, so running against it is political malpractice in either party.		Opposition to the plan is a fringe right wing position.

@Eliann_Marie @dcjanfan @haas84 @reesetheone1 @adamslily Solid factual rebuttal, very convincing.
@RobCinos @bchadhill @conor64 I think that's a rhetorical trick that is doing more damage to the GOP long term than it is doing favors. 		By spending a decade calling Obama a socialist they essentially normalized the word. Now Sanders is a potential front runner in 2020. 		Not sure that's what they wanted.
@dcjanfan @haas84 @reesetheone1 @adamslily In the last year he's gotten raises for Disney and Amazon workers, and passed a bill calling for the end of the war in Yemen, with a Republican controlled house, senate and white house. 		What exactly do you think Kamala has done in that time frame?
@RobCinos @bchadhill @conor64 This is correct, Sanders is attacked relentlessly and he is more or less a Tory.
@sfpelosi @funder Oh, dear, the one person willing to like your bad take is uhh, not doing you any favors. https://t.co/TrGCQbRuWy
@DanShenise @adamslily Then you don't really know anything about the healthcare debate or CAP. Indeed anything they are pushing is for their donors, not for you.
@theZatchery @BeltwayMike89 @adamslily @IanSams And at the time said it was because she doesn't believe in interfering in state politics, shortly there after she endorsed a bunch of candidates in the state primaries, her office was unable to resolve that inconsistency when asked about it.
@BeltwayMike89 @hventan @adamslily LOL, Sanders is not getting money from the party.

If Russiagate bothers you and this doesn't you might just be a hypocrite. 		https://t.co/ky8EoBJpv9
@aseitzwald The idea that the party should not criticize its self is one of the worst zombie ideas in modern politics.
@TheBeatWithAri @SenBlumenthal @wikileaks I'm sure we'll see that any day right?		They're going to make that all public, because attacking wikileaks has always been about the election and not covering the CIA's ass?
@ASlavitt @NateSilver538 @sahilkapur I think this probably has more to do with the party typically picking terrible standard bearers. 		Like Joe Kennedy for their responses, cautiously optimistic about Abrams.
@conor64 @JarekFA @ConnorSouthard That is historically how the people have reclaimed their rights.		Inequality is now worse than that which preceded the French revolution.		You don't want the violence, do the aggressive taxation, but it will ultimately be one or the other. https://t.co/8C8KasRH3G
@portorium @conor64 @CharlesPPierce @mattyglesias They should though, they never will be because those shows are owned by billionaires, but it would be the closest thing to journalism they've done in decades.
@conor64 Inequality is now worse than it was before the French Revolution, you should be glad that for now, the guillotines are just memes, and start writing about how we need to aggressively tax to end income inequality if we wish to avoid violence.		Do a public good with your reach. https://t.co/oGSwremUpD

@HuckYeah @DanteAtkins @ryanlcooper @DavidOAtkins @RepSchrader And it goes back up again when told they will no longer pay copays, or deductibles or premiums. 		Medical care in Canada is half our per capita cost, and they live longer, there is no defending our current system, and support of it only makes sense through the lens of corruption.
@wellmanneredson @JediofGallifrey @sfpelosi yeeesh, not a good look.

@sfpelosi @funder A year old hit piece that factually documents how he misrepresents the work he does, as well as how he spends donors money. 		Corruption doesn't go away just because it's a year old.
@HuckYeah @DanteAtkins @ryanlcooper @DavidOAtkins @RepSchrader It is a remarkably gerrymandered district, but it still includes portions of Portland metro, and 70% of the country, a SUPER MAJORITY, supports Medicare For All. 		Progressive policies are popular in red states even if the DCCC would have you believe otherwise.
@HuckYeah @DanteAtkins @ryanlcooper @DavidOAtkins @RepSchrader There is no defending opposition to Medicare For All, it is a position that only makes sense through the lens of corruption.
@HuckYeah @DanteAtkins @ryanlcooper @DavidOAtkins @RepSchrader The ACA is a garbage bill that transfers wealth from tax payers to healthcare executives. 		And lowering premiums through subsidies is just more theft from tax payers. You get 15% OVERNIGHT savings for getting rid of insurers.		https://t.co/lK0wakjXYh
@HuckYeah @DanteAtkins @ryanlcooper @DavidOAtkins @RepSchrader People in the 5th have the same problems as the rest of the country, they can't afford their healthcare, they are getting poorer year over year, and they sure as shit didn't send him to Washington to roll back financial regulations.
@HuckYeah @DanteAtkins @ryanlcooper @DavidOAtkins @RepSchrader And it's not a red state either. A strong progressive who hunts would clean the floor with him.
@sfpelosi @funder You probably don't want to promote this charlatan. 		https://t.co/nKw9yxvlbn

@RioSlade @thehill She said she welcomed it, and that she thought primaries were healthy.		PREACH!
@Enjoneer01 @TheWayWithAnoa Me too, her rhetorical shift is welcome, I don't trust her, but it's good for the Overton window.		My point was more that Biden and Sanders voters don't really overlap so if he wants to enter the race and strip votes from other candidates, that sounds OK to me.
@Enjoneer01 @TheWayWithAnoa The more neoliberals in the race the better.
@HotlineJosh If you stand with Israel you are doing morality wrong.

@danielleiat @creynoldsnc Oh god, I missed the funeral portion, that is definitely way outside of the bounds of decency.
@mrsgeedeck @nberlat In America, that is a rather privileged position.
@creynoldsnc @danielleiat expects*
@creynoldsnc @danielleiat 83% of the party, a super majority, supports Medicare For All, but not Schumer, Perez or Pelosi. 		It's remarkable that dialogue surrounding the party is as civil as it is, in my mind people should be MUCH angrier.
@creynoldsnc @danielleiat The DNC is a moral failure as an organization though, while Coke is just a business. 		No one expect Coke to help them pass legislation, while they do expect the party to do so.		When they see the party instead backing large donors over common people animosity is bred.
It would be great if "journalists" refused to print things like this without the politicians in question going on the record with their name.		https://t.co/CmCbml30zc

@JodyShenn 83% of the party supports Medicare For All, but not Pelosi, Schumer, or Perez.		Institutional corruption not popularity is the barrier to compassionate moral legislation.
@JodyShenn I think essentially everyone is iffy on 2 which is what makes me think that what is more important is someone who will use the bully pulpit to rail against inaction from the rest of the party.
@JodyShenn Sanders is definitely the compromise candidate.
God, of course for all of the coverage I hate about Kamala, there's one asshole making me feel the need to defend her.		These policies are not what's problematic about her, indeed the progressive veneer she has draped herself in is the main good thing about her candidacy. https://t.co/whFM2yNeOk

@TVietor08 @CNN Who wouldn't be thrilled by CNN giving them a platform to mainstream themselves?		It's worth a crap load, and says more about who CNN executives value as candidate than anything of real worth.
