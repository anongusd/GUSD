@tmc7316 Moving on but they stole our children. #Fact
@tmc7316 Every single adoption case or terminated rights case from my area needs to ve investigated and the workers charged fir crimes against OUR HUMANITY.
@tmc7316 More typos the more upset i get but i fight for them too bc they came for US. Single white ans black americans and our children and they took them from US and there wasn't anything we could do.
@tmc7316 Also when this isn't all about me. I have mine back. A lot if girls here lost rights to their children. Adopted or have to live with other family.
@tmc7316 A nightmare. Perfectly sane  they making you out to be crazy taking your childreb and there is nothing you can do about it.

@TheCheefReport @JeffDeRiso @intheMatrixxx @POTUS @GenFlynn @RealMattCouch @Cordicon @shadygrooove @WayneDupreeShow @VP Oldest son, never had a D in his whole life received his first D after I blasted his application to NASA on Twitter. Smdh.
@TheCheefReport @JeffDeRiso @intheMatrixxx @POTUS @GenFlynn @RealMattCouch @Cordicon @shadygrooove @WayneDupreeShow @VP My court date is in March. Can't afford an attorney I live in a blue district pretty much means I'm going to jail so they win. I'll be gone behind bars no longer chirping on twitter. My son will be living with my parents and I'll have to fight for him when I get out.
@TheCheefReport @JeffDeRiso @intheMatrixxx @POTUS @GenFlynn @RealMattCouch @Cordicon @shadygrooove @WayneDupreeShow @VP He missed a whole year wasn't held back in private school and is still getting A's functioning at a sixth grade level! üëåThe public school lied to try fuck him up and fuck up his whole life. Label him when absolutely nothing is wrong with him.
