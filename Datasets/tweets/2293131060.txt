Did you know: From 1969 to 2013, US deaths from heart disease fell 67.5% and death from strokes fell 77% because of the prevention and diagnostics discovered through the #FraminghamHeartStudy.
Thanks to @JDRF for your tireless advocacy on behalf of young people living with diabetes. Together we will protect coverage of pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, and make sure investing in scientific research remains a priority in Congress! https://t.co/aEBR8t8wRY

I will return to Washington next week committed to reunifying these families and working towards immigration policies that eliminate the current chaos and treat people with dignity.
Immigration reform does not need to be a choice between militarization or compassion. We must honor the best of our country‚Äôs ideals and demand family reunification.
The reality is we are imprisoning families that are coming to us for refuge and instead of helping we are retraumatizing them. And now, Trump policy of tearing families apart has been replaced by plans for long term internment.
Unfortunately, my visit to the border confirmed my worst fears. I met a	mother in detention whose son was sent to NY. No one could tell her where or how to contact him. I visited with children living on concrete floors huddled under mylar  blankets. #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/CfDUFzkXT8

My bill, the Online Safety Modernization Act, would make swatting a federal crime and provide resources for prevention and investigation. Our laws must catch up to the rapidly changing technology being used in crimes like swatting, doxxing and sextortion.

I later asked whether @BetsyDeVosED would enforce anti-discrimination protections for all students, whether for sexual orientation, race, religion or gender, when federal dollars go to private schools https://t.co/dqbSGL8Mwt
I also asked @BetsyDeVosED why she supports cutting funding for after school programs. She said there's no data to show they're effective. Study after study has shown that these programs help kids academically and socially
I'm glad @BetsyDeVosED is now on the record that Congress shouldn't follow the administration's reckless budget, but let's be clear: school violence and mental health were critical  issues long before #Parkland and remain so today
I asked, with students' lives on the line, why the administration is seeking to eliminate funding to help hire school counselors, psychologists, and social workers. @BetsyDeVosED indicated that the budget was submitted months ago, and she'd support Congress revisiting the issue
While @BetsyDeVosED acknowledged that she's "heard that data" that show disparate discipline toward children of color, she was unwilling or unable to say how arming teachers and other school personnel might affect these kids
This administration wants to arm teachers or other school personnel. I asked @BetsyDeVosED how increased militarization of our schools would impact children of color when we know that Black children are 3.8 times more likely to be suspended than their white counterparts
.@BetsyDeVosED indicated that she is treating the topic of school shootings with "urgency" but the commission has yet to meet. It will be comprised of 4 cabinet secretaries: no experts, no students, and no timeline for recommendations beyond "soon"

Trump's Dept. of Labor is pushing a plan to allow establishments to take employees' hard-earned tips. I pressed Sec. of Labor Acosta to explain this plan, and he stated that if Congress wanted to protect workers' tips, we should introduce a bill -- and he would support it. 1/2

This bill is a vote for powerful special interests; a vote to honor millions of dollars of the @NRA's campaign spending; #DisarmHate
