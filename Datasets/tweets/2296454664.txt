@queenc1tymadman and yes I accept the POTUS cuz who else can we blame for this sudden backwards step in human progress? Donald j trump &amp; gop
@queenc1tymadman for civil rights? Gay rights? Child labor? Isn't this what we American should be doing if we are dissatisfied with the gov?
@queenc1tymadman I just wonder what you suggest for the million+ people who are worried about all these different issues? Didn't it work....
@queenc1tymadman what do you mean lost with the other crap? How else should we be showing our displeasure with the direction if this country
@THE_kenny_siler @HMIBBook I don't see what's the problem with being efficient while creating green jobs. Fossil isn't the future
@stonyjbc true earth will continue. We are but a few sec in its life but what abt our children and leaving a habital place for them?
@THE_kenny_siler @HMIBBook so your just giving up? 3rd world countries look up to US. we need to lead so future generations have a planet.
@queenc1tymadman but its a protest from a standpoint of peace/ civil disobedience
@queenc1tymadman no no its def a protest b/c our president and head of @epa have begun to rollback policies that promote green energy.
@THE_kenny_siler @HMIBBook yes! Our current infrastructure is old/outdated. Its time to bring USA to the modern age and first again.
@THE_kenny_siler @HMIBBook im willing to train them to green jobs. Noone wants to abandon workers. keeping them in fuel is doing just that.
@stonyjbc one person cant fix the climate. It'll take all of us. Even you.
@stonyjbc point of march is show congress that policies that will fix the climate need to be on the forefront. Not to fix purely on marching
@queenc1tymadman complexities of the matter.

@DaveTheSanguine your argument sounds so unintelligible
