@PattyMurray: As we continue our efforts to respond to the opioid crisis and build on the strong bipartisan steps we took last year, I’m glad we have this opportunity today to look at another important angle of that challenge.
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: We need to do more to make sure that everyone facing pain is able to get treatments that work for them. This means ensuring research is done to better understand the biological basis of pain and the factors that determine what might work best for a patient.
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: It is so important that we listen to patients about their health care needs, whether that is finding ways to address that person’s pain or recognizing when asking for pain killers is a result of an addiction, which requires an entirely different form of treatment.
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: We have to find responsible, comprehensive solutions for pain management that ensure opioids are marketed, prescribed, and used responsibly but, at the same time, are within reach for people dealing with chronic pain.

RT @PattyMurray: Primary care can play a critical role in reducing health costs and improving outcomes—but only if people have access to it…
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: When people don’t have access to primary care, patients go to the ER for non-urgent medical care, or worse, go without medical care entirely, until non-urgent issues become more expensive to treat, more debilitating, &amp; more challenging to overcome.
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: While primary care providers can play a critical role in coordinating care and reducing costs, they can only play that role when people have access to care. In fact, lack of access can actually drive costs higher.
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: The result [of the Patient Centered Medical Home model] is care that helps bring down costs not just by giving patients better, efficient care when they are ill, but also by doing more to keep them healthy.
@PattyMurray @PattyMurray: Families across the country want quality health care to be accessible and affordable—no matter where they live, how much they make, or what health challenges they face.

Murray: I believe this committee should look at ways to leverage federal investments to stem the decline in state support for #HigherEd
Murray: Several factors contribute to increase in college tuition. First, we’ve seen deep state funding cuts at public colleges,universities
Murray: According to the Federal Reserve, outstanding student debt is now more than $1.3 trillion. #HigherEd
Murray: Often, increasing tuition means students have to borrow more &amp; more, saddling them w/ the crushing burden of student debt. #highered
Murray: Over the last 20 years, tuition has gone up far faster than inflation, while real family incomes have declined. #highered
Murray: Students want to take the next steps to move into the middle class. But the high cost of college creates insurmountable roadblocks.
Murray on meeting w/ college students: They told me about the challenges of having to hold down 2 jobs to keep up w/ rising tuition &amp; rent.
Murray: When I was 15, my family fell on hard times, but because of fed investments, my siblings &amp; I were able to get a quality education.

Murray: Students &amp; taxpayers bear nearly all the risk– Yet the institution itself bears little responsibility for their students’ outcomes.
Murray: When it comes to students who rely on loans to afford the rising cost of college, we have a lopsided accountability system.
