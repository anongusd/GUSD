@bkwilson @elonmusk Take a look at how we industrialized post World War 2. The Green New Deal is talking about federal investment in our economy, not government takeover. Federal investment is the only way we've ever had periods of large growth.
Our country headed to a de-industrialized, dystopian future. An economy of only minimum wage retail jobs, where we've lost our entire manufacturing base, can't sustain itself. #GreenNewDeal is the plan to to re-industrialize our country, and do it cleanly and sustainably.
The whole idea is to invest massively in renewable production &amp; technology, sustainable ag, etc. so US can lead. We need to go faster than other countries so our manufacturing and production can help them speed up. https://t.co/RQzFYnVLsj

@paulg Paul, here's a more fleshed out version if where we are coming from on GND and what it could look like: https://t.co/9L0QW2SOGC.		I think you have one argument about GND and another about media portrayals of it. Just want to be sure we're talking about GND here.
@paulg @boucher I'm saying the exact opposite.
@paulg The idea of GND is that our economics of austerity are based on pie fallacy and a big national mobilization is the way to grow the pie dramatically. It's a rejection of our country being a managed like a family budget. Also, though separate, poverty and inequality are linked.
@boucher @paulg Exactly. This is why we need to tackle both and can't do each in isolation. A high tax rate only solves inequality if we also generate the wealth to support it. And a mobilization like GND only solves poverty if the top don't capture all the new wealth.
@paulg Part of the reason for the reframe is that GND isn't just a way to get to slightly better -- we actually think it's an opportunity to create a new level of prosperity previously not seen (the same way the mobilization for WW2 did).
@paulg I mentioned in my tweet that an earlier draft had said 'eliminate poverty.' We just reframed it in the positive (create prosperity).
@WallStXyz @VersacePug @paulg @AOC Have you heard of Tesla? Or your iPhone? https://t.co/fOYdkMBPDn
@paulg That's why I believe neither solution is adequate on its own. GND is the project to tackle poverty. Higher taxes is the way to tackle inequality. I believe we can do both. The screenshotted section in an earlier draft actually said 'eliminate poverty'. https://t.co/qD5bmLmdva
@paulg https://t.co/AB3d0o9hhi
@paulg I agree with you that there is a problem with our media wanting to conflate them (because saying 'socialism' and 'raise taxes' drives clicks, so they want to stick it all together). We do our best to combat this, but the power of clickbait is strong.
@paulg I'm not sure where you are getting that from. You should actually check out the resolution. We never talk about taxes as a financing mechanism, but we do talk about equity stakes and public banks.
@paulg @TomLevenson Paul, @AOC emphasizes that the purpose of raising taxes is not because we need money for the Green New Deal. Sure, it can be part of it, but any time the question is asked honestly, @AOC refers to financing it the same way we financed past big national projects.
@VersacePug @paulg @AOC @MazzucatoM See: https://t.co/qTG3y8ltGz
@VersacePug @paulg @AOC We have quite a bit actually! @AOC talked about this recently in regards to how government funds pharma R&amp;D. We're inspired by the work of @MazzucatoM, who talks often about how government has always been the major VC in society-shifting technological breakthroughs.
@paulg @AnandWrites I don't believe that either a high tax rate or just massive development-focused economics on its own will solve either climate change or our wealth gap. The wealth gap is big enough and our problems large enough that we do need to do both, in tandem, and through a smart plan.
@paulg @AnandWrites This second problem is what a higher marginal tax rate solves. It puts pressure at the top to reinvest its money more wisely and not create power imbalances in society. This is good for society and, historically, has worked.
@paulg 2) Inequality and wealth gap is itself a problem. Even if we manage to create a country that solved big problems like climate change, continuously reinvented itself, and generated wealth like we did post WW2-era, wealth capture is itself an issue. See: Piketty/@AnandWrites
@paulg Financing probably WON'T be largely tax revenue. Any time we've done national projects at this scale in the past, it hasn't been. See, e.g., New Deal, WW2 financing, Moonshot. Revenue for GND is not the purpose of higher marginal tax rates.
@paulg 1) GND is tackling a huge national project. Of course technological improvements will be necessary to make the transition cheaper, but changing our entire economy won't happen through some single silver bullet. Private industry alone literally cannot do this.
@paulg Paul, I grew up reading your essays and have a lot of respect for you. But with all due respect, I think you are conflating two separate issues.

The reason the Federal Government is involved is it is the only force capable of providing the size and speed of investment necessary to create such a transformative change in the time required.
Wrong take. It's about redistributing power to workers and frontline/marginalized communities. The government acts as a lender and investor in projects, but the resolution is actually very clear about creating community and worker wealth/ownership. https://t.co/slq6glFcMZ

@CrisAlvaradoMD @JerylBier @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews He did.
@JerylBier Yeah, I disagree here. I think economic security from a jobs guarantee increases freedom. Working 80 hours a week just to get by isn't very free to me. In fact, I see the whole plan as a way to increase freedom. But in general, I'm glad we ended up on debating actual proposals!

@JerylBier Yup, and he was just honestly mistaken. There WAS a doctored FAQ floating around, and that's what bob had seen and assumed Tucker was pulling from. He hadn't seen the draft FAQ I'm talking about, and he HAD read the actual resolution that never had the line 'unwilling to work'.
@JerylBier A job guarantee is one way to ensure a living wage job that guarantees the basics for a dignified life with training embedded to create a workforce that can adapt to a rapidly changing economy.
@JerylBier But here's why a jobs guarantee is needed: we actually need to have INCREDIBLE workforce flexibility to pull off a mobilization of this source. We don't want to artificially constrain our labor mobility because, e.g., people can't access training or care.
@JerylBier Have you actually read the resolution? It's here: https://t.co/cfeJKPaX3B
@JerylBier That's in the resolution! So let's debate that then. I just want to get rid of this false notion that there were some 'radical' things in the faq that we're backing away from. Policy-wise, not the case! Typo-wise, sure.
@JerylBier For sure. I am MORE than happy to engage on any of the ideas in the resolution! And if you read it, I'm not sure what radical ideas you are talking about?
@JerylBier Workers who have given their lives to build up our country's economy and energy systems deserve to have dignity, period.
@JerylBier That's why this was a draft. Was a placeholder to flesh it out. I literally wrote it after having a conversation with someone from the utility workers union describing how not all who currently work in energy deserve to have to do a big career shift after decades of service.
We live in a time of political chaos. We can come out of it better than we were before, but it's going to take political leadership with vision and imagination backed by a movement willing to leave it all on the floor. @AOC is showing us how it's done, but she can't do it alone. https://t.co/06dhic0rXR

@Noahpinion I'm listening, clearly, and honestly do want to see your plan.  But was disappointed that you decided to characterize what I'm trying to say so simplistically.
@HayekAndKeynes @rajasark @AOC I'm still nice Justin! Sup :)
@Noahpinion It really bugs me when 'top economic thinkers' get sucked into -isms that they themselves can't describe as their strawman. Seriously Noah? You sound like Fox News. I really expected a bit more nuance from you!
@Noahpinion Now you are just making bad faith rhetorical arguments. You know I'm talking about transitioning our economy to a renewable energy economy. And I'm saying investing in production will be net positive ROI. This is literally how development works!
@Noahpinion I'm sure there are other ways to do the transition, but why not try to go for the one that makes the most amount of shared prosperity? Why not think about this very crucial and critical element of saving the planet?
@Noahpinion That IS what the GND is. It's a 10-year plan to get to net-zero ggh emissions THROUGH a just transition that creates millions of high-wage jobs.
@Noahpinion We're not denying that there could be other ways to save the planet that are worse. E.g., we could just ban all production and make everybody poor. The whole point of the GND is talking about the transition to a new economy in which the most number of people come out better.
@Noahpinion Wait but they are linked. We are literally talking about the transition of the economy in order to save the planet. We can either do that in a way that plans it out to create the leas harm (and ideally most benefit) to society as possible, or we can decide that's too hard.
@mellisawaltzer @Noahpinion No, but he started his thread saying he's releasing an alternative. And I'm excited to see it, in all honesty!
@Noahpinion Look, if you have an alternative that gets us there through a just transition and ends up with society having a better quality of life than what's being attempted in the GND, GREAT! Let's do that one.
@Noahpinion Finally, we are saying we want to make sure workers in the fossil fuel industry end up net-positive. Why wouldn't we do that? Why not make sure there's a safety net to catch people during such a society-shifting transformation?
@Noahpinion If millions of people can't participate in the transformation because higher education or trade schools are too expensive, or because they are tied to an employer-sponsored health care system, it's going to be tough to pull off something as big as a GND.
@Noahpinion We ALSO want to make sure that as we transition our entire economy, everyone in society has the ability to be a part of that. Because our constraint is going to be resources and labor.
@Noahpinion Here's where we talk about this reasoning in the resolution. https://t.co/L3HACwZHYX
@Noahpinion Rich countries get rich through national projects that transform their economies. That's development economics. You said you liked books like Bad Samaritans -- well this is exactly what he describes doing in there.
@Noahpinion We're saying it is necessary for a JUST TRANSITION in saving the planet. As in we want to save the planet and ALSO make the vast majority of society have a better quality of life BECAUSE a national project to save the planet will produce wealth that enables us to do so.
@NoahFiliation @Noahpinion I actually think it's the other way around. See: cap and trade failure by democrats last time.
@Noahpinion It's not a bait and switch. We've literally been saying since the select committee that this is a plan for economic prosperity and justice through tackling a large national industrial and infrastructure project. Did you read the resolution for the select committee in November?
@Noahpinion They are necessary for a just transition, and some of these are wealth generating Current health care system and unaffordable education hurts workforce flexibility. Basic income is not in the resolution. If done right, the investments in a Green New Deal should generate wealth.

The most incredible bit -- she believes this so deeply at her core that @AOC doesn't even have to write speeches. She literally came up with this on the spot.
"That means we are not going to transition to renewable energies without also transitioning front-line communities and coal communities into economic opportunity as well. That is what this is about."
"There is no justice and there is no combating climate change without addressing what has happened to indigenous communities. That means there is no fixing our economy without addressing the racial wealth gap."

@BitaMahdaviani Yes that's what we mean by a just transition. It means creating the New jobs first and the means for getting those jobs before transitioning off any industry.
"Similarly, removing combustible engines from the roads or expanding high-speed rail to largely eliminate air travel would require nothing short of revolutionizing transportation."		I couldn't have said it better myself.

@AriNatter This is a bit misleading. The resolution describes the 10-year plan to transform every sector of our economy to remove GHH and pollution. It says it does this through huge investment in renewables at WW2 scale (which was 40-60% GDP investments).
@david_turnbull @DoctorVive @politico @AOC @RepAOC @SenMarkey @sunrisemvmt The resolution is actually an attempt at describing exactly this transition by massively building up our renewable energy infrastructure and industry.
@DoctorVive @politico @AOC @RepAOC @SenMarkey @sunrisemvmt I want to get the full resolution out, but we do call for a transition off fossil fuels. The resolution spells out a 10-year plan for the actual economic mobilization necessary to eliminate GGH from every sector of our economy.

@nairbv @paulg @travischapman You are right. Which is why I'd also support a wealth tax ;).
@HPublius I'm not really talking about MMT so much as industrial planning to create wealth and the way governments (including ours) already appropriate funds (see the linked article). Inflation is caused by resource constraints, that's not an MMT only theory.
@nairbv @paulg @travischapman I didn't say it was causation. I said it correlated with better distribution and a period of high growth and gave a case for why that may be. Blanket assuming it has no effect on distribution seems pretty wrong?
@paulg @travischapman The idea that we should only invest what we raise from tax revenue is about as bad an idea for economic growth as the gold standard used to be. It's an artificial constraint on the economy. Here's some good books to read about how all this works: https://t.co/ea3fgRY29X
@paulg @travischapman Won't go into the details for why more wealth at bottom/less inequality is good due to all the existing art out there already talking about that, but tldr: you should be mapping tax rates to overall growth and inequality measures to measure effectiveness, not revenue collection.
@paulg @travischapman Companies like Amazon realize the way to grow and build wealth is productive investment of outside investments. That's essentially the same idea that should be applied at a nation-state level.
@paulg @travischapman Here's a good article that go into the economics of doing big national investments/projects and how we actually pay for things in this country at the nation-state level. 		https://t.co/JjMDSzICh5
@paulg @travischapman There's plenty of evidence that high inequality/real wage stagnation is itself an economic problem, regardless of growth. The solution to growth and public investment isn't tax revenue collection. Taxes are just a control for inflation.
@paulg @travischapman This is the wrong metric. The purpose of higher marginal tax rates isn't increased revenue collection, it's to compress pre-tax distribution of income in order to reduce inequality. Your chart shows, if matched with GINI coefficient or real wage growth, would show that this works

And the idea that she, an educator, organizer, bartender, service worker, and now elected official who campaigned by talking to thousands of people and has the ability to instantly connect with millions, doesn't understand humans as well as a billionaire VC is really something.
I'd suggest brushing up on your economics with a few books to start! Here's a good list: https://t.co/ea3fgRY29X. I'm sure you have a great understanding of how to maximize profit in our current system, but that is not an understanding of how economies of nations work
The idea that economics is a science, in fact, is a pretty new idea that was introduced by a right wing campaign that took over our universities over the course of the last 40-50 years. To understand 'basic economics', @vkhosla, you need to read economic history.
Economics is a social system. It is not a science. It is a set of rules  we determine to prioritize some values over another. @vkhosla has gained  greatly from the current system, but you have to be blind to not see  that this system has some fundamental flaws.

I wish our Congress was as effective at organizing around legislation as they seem to be in organizing big money and planting crap stories in Politico. Bullshit like this is why people have no faith in Congress doing its job -- because it doesn't.

@eliza_relman @thisisinsider @AOC @hollis_photo Yup! But I think not entirely accurate to say we won't push abolishing ICE. More accurate to say abolishing ICE is the first step in a larger immigration agenda to reframe the entire debate.
@thisisinsider @AOC @eliza_relman @hollis_photo So the first step is to abolish ICE. And then of course we need to create a pathway to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants. And then we should be thinking about the policies for an inclusive immigration agenda, but the details of that are what we need to internally plan.
@thisisinsider @AOC @eliza_relman @hollis_photo But that frame is somewhat new. No one has talked about how do we actually create institutions to recruit immigrants and do actual industrial planning around the idea of increasing our workforce by demanding more immigrants come here.
@thisisinsider @AOC @eliza_relman @hollis_photo And then I went on to say that plan should be centered around reframing the debate on immigration. How we should think in terms of how we will need to recruit more immigrants to help us create the new economy and not talk about immigration as a problem.
@thisisinsider @AOC @eliza_relman @hollis_photo To be fair, my full answer was that we were going to talk a bit more internally about the full plan for abolishing ice and then what to do after.

Also worth noting how #PAYGO has already hurt us in past. ACA passed in 2010, but exchanges with subsidies only went live in 2014 because of  PAYGO. This meant the ACA's benefits did not sink in until 2014, giving Republicans ammo to attack it. This is bad policy AND politics.
This freshman class was elected to bring fresh ideas and propose bold solutions. Hamstringing these ideas on day 1 shows a profound lack of understanding of what the American people are calling for right now.
The only reason for #PAYGO to exist is to stop even the consideration of progressive legislation.

So when @Ocasio2018 talks about going big in the depths of darkness, this is what she means. This is the kind of leadership we need when our way of life is threatened with extinction. That is real leadership: willing to call for what's needed, not just what seems possible.
If FDR had never set those unrealistic goals, we would have no impetus to hit it. The "free market" certainly wouldn't and neither would our political leaders at the time.
Over the next five years, America produced 300,000 planes, blowing well past FDRs targets. This is what we are capable of as a country if we simply try.
CEOs, generals, business leaders and of course politicians -- all of them thought this was mere fantasy. Just an "organizing tactic."
These targets were so "impossible", Hitler thought this was just American propaganda. In 1939, America had produced fewer than 3,000 planes.
In 1940, as the threat if World War 2 loomed, FDR delivered a seminal speech on creating the arsenal of democracy. And he set specific production targets: 185,000 planes, 120,000 tanks, 55,000 anti-aircraft guns, 18 million tons of merchant shipping.
So many people I've talked to in DC over the last week have said some version of this: "The 10 year timeline to reverse climate change and create millions of jobs seems like a great organizing tactic. But let's talk about what's actually possible." Let's talk about that.

@trav_boogie @AmericanCrux @Ocasio2018 @sunrisemvmt @justicedems This doesn't have to pass the senate
Here is the draft resolution @Ocasio2018, @sunrisemvmt and @justicedems is proposing to create a committee that has a goal to create a real plan that averts the climate crisis in time with concrete guidelines for how that must be done to ensure justice for all. https://t.co/A9HGkHHg0i
RT @billmckibben: A good moment. About time that some younger people were shaking up our political system https://t.co/tEYTwnWTnj
The last time a climate committee was put together, we had a Democratic majority in Congress and we had the white house. But we didn't actually make any plan to solve the climate crisis. Let's not make that mistake again and plan ahead this time!
So this is what @sunrisemvmt and @justicedems and @Ocasio2018 is asking for: let's use the power we have right now, as Democrats, to make a real plan in the next year that will mobilize our economy to create millions of jobs and end the climate crisis in 10 years. That's it.
So the House actually has the chance to put together the plan Democrats should enact when they come into power. We need to spend the next year doing this, or we'll be caught flat-footed in 2020.
The whole idea here is that we need a plan -- a REAL plan -- that goes all the way. Not a committee that holds some hearings. There's a good chance that if we have a bold vision, Democrats may have the House, Senate, and White House in 2020.
One important thing about this sit-in -- there's a really concrete ask here that Democrats have the power to do even though they don't control the Senate. The House has the power to create committees without Senate approval when Congress comes in session. https://t.co/20QUVcwE0i

I am deathly terrified of whatever it is that Trump and Pelosi can agree on.
In a wave year against one of the most hated Presidents in our lifetime, the Democrats should have won huge. If we ever manage to unite behind a real plan to fix stagnant wages, guarantee health care, and actually solve the existential threats facing our country, we'd do better.
Another thing to note -- Republicans won net 63 seats in the House in the 2010 midterms. The party in power ALWAYS loses seats in the midterms. Democrats getting a 10-11 vote majority is not a victory for the current Democratic leadership.
We saw the exact same dynamic in the House too. Lots of progressives lost, but they lost *running in deep red districts*. These are districts that Democrats had given up running candidates in at all. And these progressives vastly outperformed history.
We should be comparing Beto's performance in Texas to Bredesen's in Tennessee. Beto gave us a roadmap for how to make a red state competitive by going big. Bredesen showed us what happens when the Dems use their existing third way strategies.
Voters actually get this. So the few times they see a candidate like Beto or Gillum or Abrams pop up, they see a fighter, and they come out to vote.
The Democrats need a big vision, period. When the IPCC says we have 12 years to turn around climate change but they present a plan for 50, that's not gonna cut it. When ASCE says we need over 4 trillion to fix our infra, but D's present a plan smaller than Trump's, that won't do.
And yet, centrist Democratic INCUMBENTS in the senate (and remember, incumbents win 97% of the time) like Donnelly, McCaskill and Heitkamp got clobbered. Why isn't the narrative that when you start to question whether immigrants have a right to be American, you get punished?
The way to win red states is hold to your values and have a bold vision. @BetoORourke, @staceyabrams, @AndrewGillum didn't win but VASTLY over-performed and turned their states purple because they stood for immigrants, against racism, and for economic justice.

@LPDonovan @manticore_night @justicedems We can't do any soft money expenditures on races. We and BNC are both federal PACs that are coordinating with candidates.
@LPDonovan @ryangrim @justicedems I had posted about this on Reddit previously but figured it would be good to put the full answer up on JD's knowledgebase.  Here's why you see Brand New Congress so much on JD's 2017 FEC reports: https://t.co/QY805pOCyX
@hugetinymistake @rpyers @ryangrim @justicedems No, these are in-kind donations of dialer minutes. When volunteers make phone calls, they use an auto-dialer, which costs money. We pay for minutes to candidates.
@ryangrim @justicedems We have raised $713,520 for candidates (actually more like $830k, but we didn't track tandems first month). $187,049 of that last quarter. This turns out to be a more effective way to raise money for candidates than giving them a check, but it does not show up on FEC reports.
@ryangrim @davidhelms @justicedems @BrandNew535 Ryan, we send emails out fundraising directly for candidates and give candidates access to all donors that they get from those e-mails. Happy to show you numbers on that, connect you with candidates we've helped, or anything else you are interested in.

@LiebermanJeremy @j_jjjunkie According to that site, it seems like FEC actually went through the line items and is caring.
@LiebermanJeremy @j_jjjunkie ActBlue is just a payment processor like Stripe or PayPal, but better pricing for small donations.
@LiebermanJeremy @j_jjjunkie That is not something ActBlue handles, it's something all PACs must do to comply with rules.

@thekarladam If I want to start cooking regularly, I want to learn what a good kitchen setup is. VCS is that for software.
@thekarladam I'm talking about all the things surrounding code.  Writing good code doesn't fall under "artificial barriers to entry."
@me1000 Maybe, or maybe it can just be solved by a good IDE. Visual Studio almost did it, if only SourceSafe didn't suck.
@me1000 VCS, where and how to host it made (I know this changes by type of app), dunno what else.
@avibryant Totally agree - I used hg for Mockingbird just because it was so much easier to get setup. Damn github for winning =).
@me1000 Yeah, was hoping for something that kind of tells you about all the things surrounding getting a program up and running too.
@me1000 Ah yeah, everyone seems to love that (never read it). It goes through things like version control too?
What do people suggest as reading/tutorials for someone that wants to go from nothing to first working application in production?
Friend of mine completely new to it just spent all day figuring out how to use git.  Maybe it can't be better, but seems like maybe it can.

A lot of the webstore apps seem like they are designed for touch devices more than browsers on computers.

@stevedekorte In the end they have a ton of apps with different designers. The stuff talked about today though seem to have good ones.
@stevedekorte Video and shopping are failed products, i don't think anyone argues they are good. Youtube isn't really google's design.

@tlrobinson That trick won't help with the actual call quality, just your rate of receiving calls, right?

@tlrobinson Hahahahaha I thought I was making a joke. What you need is an army of them strung together. And bazooka to go through walls.

Programming equivalent of walking away from an explosion: make a change, run tests, switch to back editor before tests even finish.
@boucher also reduces the chances of introducing an accidental global by forgetting a comma.
@kriskowal Is there something like Node's sys.inspect in Narwhal?

@diorahman er, @sheenapakanati is what I meant to say.
@diorahman @spakanati was actually responsible for it, but yeah, it's just a colorWithPatternImage used with setBackgroundColor.

@branesks especially since the sys.path output was the same on both REPL and from my django app.
@branesks Yep, I restarted. I just tried installing using easy_install and that worked. Weird that the REPL was reading the source install.
Anyone know why installing latest django on my server shows v1.2.1 in python REPL but v1.0.4 in my fastcgi process running my app?

@tolmasky How long do you plan to continue drinking?
@tolmasky That was my suggestion to you guys!
@jfahrenkrug We should meet up when you're back in December - I ended up missing the CPCoderNight yesterday, but heard you were there.
@JimRoepcke was actually using Espresso, but with brackets on their own line, which messed up indents. js2-mode does the same i think?
Never mind - espresso-mode for Emacs works well as long as I don't put opening { on their own lines.
What do people use to edit Node.js programs?  Emacs' javascript-mode doesn't do so well with nested functions.
I'm probably one of the few, but I find async programming with #nodejs kind of fun.  Maybe just because it's new and unfamiliar.

After 3 days on Safari, I'm back to Chrome.  Chrome tabs are just too good.
@tolmasky Just got home, guessing you guys are back in the haight by now?
@tolmasky @boucher @tlrobinson Sorry don't think I'll be able to make it to the CPCoderDay today, but let me know where you go out drinking.
@tbalthazar That sounds like fun - do you know if they do it often?
@rauchg I think at least the JS is a bit faster.  Just ran Sunspider on my Chrome and Safari installs - got 314 on Safari, 372 on Chrome.
Just wasted 40 minutes tracking down a tricky bug that I realized I had already found, filed with MochiKit, and fixed a month ago.

@hammerdr In that case - http://bit.ly/dlzXqE - I think that's the way to do test setups in Gherkin (which I asked you about yesterday).
