@Paulett50150426 @senatemajldr Can‚Äôt defend Potus so you go with ‚Äúwhat about‚Äù  so very sad ...
@senatemajldr This-	Lying more, spending more, and seizing  power from the people. This is Republicans hammer of choice -- and in every part of American life we see a nail. We‚Äôre sprinting as far  right as possible, trying to outdo one another so we get praise from #POTUS
@stucam7771 Well said!
@FiveThirtyEight Let‚Äôs starting seeing approvals by electoral college. 	We‚Äôve learned nation wide polls mean nothing, look st each state and what the approval is, translate that to a vote for potus or not. That way we see what work needs to be done.
@SenKevinCramer 2016 Obama was  still President.  #POTUS has only made trade worse and hurt the farmers. Let‚Äôs look to the mid west or maybe South Dakota for what‚Äôs actually happing.
@thehill Hell... I‚Äôd eye roll too üôÑ with Mr Jordan yammering.
@replouiegohmert Typical GOP rhetoric. No where dose it say such things.. in fact, there isn‚Äôt even text to a bill. It‚Äôs all speculation.		BTW, if you‚Äôre against socialism your against the police and fire and parks and public education, highways...
@DailyCaller Completely irrelevant.
@mikegatto Running man..	We‚Äôll need a pass to go anywhere and have prior approval before that..	Scary how sci-fi  can become reality.
@RepMarkGreen Trump lies to the people of America and he‚Äôs still president.. so we shouldn‚Äôt listen to him and treat him the same way as you treat Cohen.. sold!
@CongressmanHice @RepMaxineWaters @CoryBooker @EricHolder Typical ‚ÄúWhat about‚Äù sad !	Doesn‚Äôt work anymore except with fox viewers, the American people see though your deception.
@RepMarkMeadows ‚ÄúFine people on many sides..‚Äù	Support for white supremacist is generally considered a racist move or are you blinded by the trump kool aid?
@Jim_Jordan Kool aid drinker.
@RepMarkGreen @realDonaldTrump We see though your simple lies. 	Cohen is there to talk about POTUS.. 	The attempt to smear him and the political process is an obvious form of deception.	The people of TN and this country deserve better.
@HouseGOP @ICEgov Fact: customs own website says it apprehends close to 60K per month. So realistically not a single illegal is getting through.		Build a wall and fire all  border agents , sounds like the GOP way!
@charliekirk11 Most Dems support border security.. that hasn‚Äôt changed.  They didn‚Äôt support a thousand mile wall, then or now!
@charliekirk11 Someone is jealous.
@DailyCaller She can now sue the Daily Caller for slander. No where did she instruct Americans. She pointed out a source of CO2. 	Who eats hamburgers theee times a day anyway?
@DailyCaller Many of those never made it to the national podium and if they did they quickly faded away as they should.  The real issue is  ‚Äú what about‚Äù which is the game the right likes to play.
@thehill With all the coverage of this event. To target the Post specifically says this is a trump move.. now we need to connect the dots......
@RepByrne Saying no to the wall dose not equal open border! Open borders is a narrative created by right to further divide this great country!
@realDonaldTrump Those states represent more than half of all citizens in the US . Tread lightly President Dunsel. Voters are on to your game.	#dunsel
RT @nowthisnews: Pres. Trump has declared a ‚Äònational emergency‚Äô to build a vast southern border wall that Congress refused to approve. Her‚Ä¶
For over 200 years this great country has not needed a wall.  Logical immigration  rules, yes. 	We have been a welcoming country to many citizens of this world who made the journey here in hopes of a new life.		#NoWall
@RepByrne @POTUS He shut down the government and now is having a temper tantrum because he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted .	BTW... Both parties came a consensus  on a spending bill, so how is it the Dems fault again ?
@DailyCaller This makes America great #MAGA	achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions	establish millions of high-wage jobs &amp; ensure economic security for all;	Invest in infrastructure and industry;	Secure clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature.
@DanCrenshawTX @BetoORourke Actually it‚Äôs a fence.. no wall. So in answer to you‚Äôre question.. nothing would happen because nothing would change.
@RepByrne Nothing in this story says crisis like families struggling to find a better life.	Maybe if we looked at why they‚Äôre coming here. Political instability, violence, gang.. let‚Äôs work with neighbors to the south and not stick our head in the ground!
@WhiteHouse Meant to say white American human life who are rich. .. others don‚Äôt matter.
@charliekirk11 Who started the special Counsel -Rosenstein a Trump appointee. 	Is it written anywhere the goal is impeachment, NO!	The kool aid drinkers follow blindly.

@senatemajldr Exactly... limiting super pacs, having social media report  election expenditures , barring house members from server on corporate boards and telling states to use paper ballets in federal elections only is a terrible idea.
@RepAndyHarrisMD @HouseGOP Exaxtly... limiting super pacs, having social media report  election expenditures , barring house members from server on corporate boards and telling states to use paper ballets in federal elections only is a terrible idea.
@dbongino Raids .. what raids .. arrest, yes.. over the top, yes.. share a list of police state raids . Could you.. thx
@joncoopertweets Until trump is out, we must unite. Then We need the  2 party system broken up. It was never the intent to have a two party system and has given us limited choices
@thehill How stupid is this article.. #failure
@thehill Many have.. she can run but know she won‚Äôt be a favorite except for trump and his fanatical cult.
@SenKevinCramer @SpeakerPelosi Had the house and senate for two years.. no wall.  Why pointi the fingers at the Dems when your own party can t even get it passed. #nowall #CommonSense
@SenKevinCramer Distracting from the real news.. 	btw any appearance on Fox propaganda tv lowers your trustworthiness.

#potus wants the shut down. He‚Äôs said multiple times, he wanted to shrink certain agencies. And he‚Äôs using this opportunity to do so..	No EPA, privatize the TSA and air traffic controllers, get rid of the Interior.  Etc...	#TrumpShutown
@esaagar @DailyCaller @POTUS Calling BS!	#potus reaches more followers through twitter than any #SOTU.
@RepByrne @POTUS Funny.. McConnell has had multiple opportunities to bring house bills to the senate floor but refuses to do so.. until you can explain that.. don‚Äôt try to defend POTUS.
@realDonaldTrump Any wall ? You did say ‚Äúa wall‚Äù I‚Äôll build a nice stone wall about yea high, with beautiful rocks. It‚Äôs like Magic, right ?	It‚Äôll stop crime.
@meana717 @bigjrey @HouseGOP And a majority of republicans voted against it 2013  including McConnell and Cruz and the government didn‚Äôt shut down.
@bigjrey @HouseGOP They‚Äôre for border security.. not a monument to an unfit president.
@HouseGOP This-	Republicans have no interest in providing relief to DACA recipients that trump removed. Securing the border unless it‚Äôs to promote an archaic monument to an egocentric President, or participating in neg. Only duty is to keep their base happy regardless collateral damage.
@joncoopertweets Now let‚Äôs hear from his parent !
@WhiteHouse You‚Äôre right, the broken immigration system  brought your relatives here and now look where we are.	Better vetting maybe would have protected America from you and your horde.
@patann0438 @JudicialWatch Missed some key info:  a majority are Asian  then non Hispanic blacks. 		How many Asians are crossing the border illegally vs flying in through legal ports of entry?
@patann0438 @JudicialWatch All one has to do is read.	I suggest starting with the CDC to understand how diseases travel or politifact  	Knowledge is power.
@JudicialWatch And how many of those illnesses arrive via aircraft from travelers abroad or where‚Äôs the story how many immigrants have higher vaccination rates then most of Americans.	#statsmatter
@SenJoniErnst Wait... Doesn‚Äôt the Hyde Amendemt do the same thing already except for rape/incest or danger to the mother?	Sounds like pandering to an uneducated base.
@realDonaldTrump San Dimas High School Football Rules!
@realDonaldTrump Reminded of that scene in Bill and Teds  excellent adventure where the jock has nothing else to say except  ‚ÄùSan Dimas High School Football Rules ‚Äú		How pathetic of a president!
@ABC @FiveThirtyEight ‚ÄúStill think‚Äù..who wrote this?	How about ‚Äúhold‚Äù or ‚Äúfirmly believe ‚Äú
@SteveScalise @HouseGOP Get facts correct-	Trumps said he owns the shutdown	Majority of Heroin comes through designated ports of entry. Not sections without a wall or fence.	Customs own website says - 8531 criminal aliens arrest in FY17 not your 17K.
@SteveScalise @HouseGOP This is more inline-	First trump holds paychecks for federal workers hostage(documented on TV) and now he holds ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Republicans hostage to his ego agenda.
@realDonaldTrump The Berlin Wall worked wonders at keeping people in, then it didn‚Äôt.	The people revolted. And so will Americans!	Strong borders can be obtained without the needles waste of a monument to your ego.
@cc_sheriff 	Today on KTAR your sheriff spoke about border security.	Unfortunately he said several things untrue.	1) The president did not get a majority of the votes in the election 	2) Most drugs come across the border at legal points of entry, not though unsecured sections.
@senatemajldr Like how we support governments that kill journalists who speak against them ‚Äú Saudi Arabia‚Äù	That‚Äôs the kind of leadership dictators embrace.
@SenKevinCramer And it‚Äôs ok to support a Saudi government that kills journalists?
@replouiegohmert @realDonaldTrump @townhallcom Taking a stand on border security is not courageous. It‚Äôs expected. Asking for republicans to support him says party or citizens.  That‚Äôs a betrayal to our constitution and the people of this great country.
@realDonaldTrump Elected by a minority of citizens many of which you are hurting not helping.
@Oooooo_Donna @tedcruz Life long benefits need to repealed. 	Pay needs to be tied to performance. 	Congress needs to have the same health and retirement programs Americans have.	They‚Äôre treated as elites, something our forefathers fought agains.
@tedcruz Good idea but to limit house to 6 total years while senate gets 12.. not fair to many. Try 5 terms for house.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @JesseBWatters @greggutfeld Illegal
@thehill @VP The trust in government has been destroyed by your rhetoric. What we  see with our own eyes rebuffs your words.
@GOP @tedcruz @SenTedCruz Trump owns the shutdown.. he stated it in public. How the hell can you say it‚Äôs a Schumer shutdown unless you are experiencing some sort of dementia ..	True?	You would never lie to the public, that would be unethical, right ?
@RepByrne @realDonaldTrump Funny you are..
@RepGosar @DailyCaller Berlin Wall worked wonders at keeping people in, then it didn‚Äôt.	The people revolted. And so will Americans!	Strong borders can be obtained without the needs waste of a monument to one mans ego.
@SenKevinCramer Drugs will not be stopped,  Drug smugglers have the resources to dig deeper than any wall made.	They‚Äôve dug under buildings, under some of the most densely populated areas along the Baja/Calif border. 	#commonsense #bordersecurity
@GOPLeader Living with n a border state, there is no crisis except for the one manufacturered by trump and the gop. Quick reminder, a fence is a lot different than a wall.
@realDonaldTrump America has always been great, your leadship is pushing us to the back of the pack!
@SenKevinCramer To keep the arcticwinds from entering, or to keep the moose out.. which is it?
@Harmless_Patsy @RepMarkMeadows Berlin Wall and we know how that ended.

@thehill Override the veto.. it can be done.	Citizens over party!
@replouiegohmert @realDonaldTrump Made a correction -	.@realDonaldTrump: Stand your ground Mr. President and protect our citizens! Not one more American life should be sacrificed upon the altar of the GOP‚Äôs gun agenda.
@realDonaldTrump Calif provides far more to the federal government than it receives.	Maybe they should do the same, stop sending money to the Feds and use it for the people. Not a bloated tainted bureaucracy!
@thehill There won‚Äôt be a country to protect by the time this tantrum is over. Now we see why many of you‚Äôre companies failed. Same leadership , same ignorance!
@DRUDGE_REPORT Shirley, you can‚Äôt be serious?
@RepGosar @YumaSheriff So they‚Äôre sneaking across the border to claim asylum and head to Hawaii. Interesting...
@Patriot_2A @MarshaBlackburn Have you ever drank the water in Mexico?
@SenMikeLee Living in  border states for over 45 years, never felt fear, never felt in danger. Crossed into Mexico at multiple points of entry.  Our country is safe, people like you make it unsafe.

@realDonaldTrump You truly are the worst businessman ever!...
@realDonaldTrump You mean a fence, like we have along many parts of the border, especially the Calif/Baja segment. Mexico was to pay for wall.	Guess that‚Äôs not happening, eh ?
@realDonaldTrump Republicans are afraid. If both parties came together, they could override any threatened veto and get the country moving again.	You‚Äôre not a leader but a cowardly little boy who cries when he can‚Äôt get what he wants.
