@Garryk4rvsGarry @44cabd26cc1f41f @seanhannity The majority voted for her. I don't think the walls is a bad idea. I just don't think it's the best idea ! We can do better! And yes integrity does matter! I think extremism left or right is insanity! An INTELLIGENT balanced approach is necessary! God bless America!
@Garryk4rvsGarry @44cabd26cc1f41f @seanhannity I don't have a personal grudge! I have a balance due!  The president should pay his bills! Or it reflects poorly on his character! At any other time in history I believe you would agree!  What has happened to this country? This is very sad!
@Garryk4rvsGarry @44cabd26cc1f41f @seanhannity I really don't care, wall or no wall! They make ladders and shovels. Don't waste my tax dollars on an ineffective stupid non solution! We can do better. We can fix this problem! If only we had a leader with vision.Instead of a 1 dimensional ass clown! We need ideas not slogans!
