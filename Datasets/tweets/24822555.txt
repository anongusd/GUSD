@BBdemanda The problem is, I’ll wake up at 4:30am tomorrow, lol
@uractuality Hopefully I can stay up for at least another hour, lol
I’m so ready for bed. I’ve been yawning and trying to stay awake. I thought surely it must be close to 9pm, but when I looked at the time, it was only 7:35! That’s probably too early to go to bed, lol
@RobGivenchy @terrycrews Ew. It’s like when people say they don’t see color or that all lives matter. So gross.
@megatron_jones Girl, you’re gorgeous! Have fun tonight!

@BBdemanda I had to do a bunch of dishes before I could get my coffee started because I live in a house full of jerks. 😡 they had no problem eating the delicious white chicken chili I made, but not one bothered to put their dishes in the dishwasher.
@BBdemanda At least you know how to program yours and remembered to do it. I’m sitting here on the couch with two puppies laying on my lap, knowing I have to get up to do it and then wait for it to brew. 🤦‍♀️

@bribrim I can see you!
@SoSofieFatale The GOP congress can take a flying leap. They can never again raise the issues of security clearances or protected emails again. They are willfully ignoring trump’s blatant disregard for security. And his nepotism. And everything else.

@IsItUpOrDown He’s such an idiot. He was so hell bent on making a point, he didn’t listen to the answer, but I guess that was the point. He wants people to think that Cohen is hiding documents. It’s another way to discredit the investigation for trump’s base

Um, a Walmart fashion commercial? Lmao, no thanks!
@CDKTX Lol
@BBTeamNorth So terrible. I wish the music would cut them off faster
Um, these are interesting outfits. Definitely costume #OSCARS
@RealityRobbed As long as that tux is burning in the fireplace that I imagine is burning beside their love bed, lol
@RealityRobbed 😂
There is so much pink at the #Oscars tonight. I’m not crazy about Jason Momoa’s pink tux, but he sure got the memo that people are wearing pink tonight! Lol
Regina King looks like a goddess in that dress. I’m so glad she won the Oscar. She’s a phenomenal actress! #OSCARS
Wait. Why didn’t Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Maya Rudolph host? They are quite funny. #OSCARS
Well, this is a way to include music from nominated movies, I guess. #OSCARS
Alison Janney looks amazing. I love her dress! #OSCARS
@PettyBettyBB I’ve got flannel Santa pajama pants, a cheap NYC tee shirt that I bought at JFK airport and some striped ski socks. I went all out, can’t you tell? Lol
@mightyIfer @CDKTX 😉
@CDKTX https://t.co/R1g2oNAq3T
@TvMonicaTv Lol, too funny. We knew that hubs had a black and yellow parachute, so we could get him coming in. I’m glad he had fun, but you’d never catch me doing this, lol
@CDKTX It looks like she borrowed Nick Cannon’s turban. I’m not a fan of this look at all
@RealityRobbed I really liked that film. She was extraordinary.
@TvMonicaTv My husband did this during our last weekend in Hawaii. It was difficult to watch, but he had a blast.

I think my most favorite thing is when either of my dogs are sleeping like this and they start to wag their tails while asleep. 🥰 https://t.co/gZH7Tz7JvN
@DebiMossScheler @uractuality Lol, I taught me kids how to do laundry when they were 10 and I made them make their own lunches, but as they get older and closer to moving out, I’ve found myself doing those things for them more. I guess it’s because I know they don’t need me to do it that I want to do it, lol
@DebiMossScheler @uractuality Oh for sure. Raising children into self assured and functioning adults, who don’t need you to do things for them is not easy, especially when as a mom, it’s hard wired into you to help them with everything.
@DebiMossScheler @uractuality 😭 it’s so hard when the kids are everything you do and then they grow up and don’t need you as much. My oldest gave me a compliment the other day that made me tear up. She said that it was good when I made her do things, even when she was angry at me at the time for it. 😭
@RobGivenchy Have fun!
@Mrs_ARockstar Have fun!

@AJDMaru @BBdemanda I went to the movies with my youngest today and the puppies stayed home with hubs. You should have seen how they reacted when I got home. You’d think that I left them with Cruella DeVil, lol. https://t.co/LTI3Mv5EfS
@BBdemanda @CDKTX Riding lawn mower is a must!
@BBdemanda @AJDMaru I caught him mid blink, too. When he wants food from you, he blinks his eyes like he’s trying to muster up some tears to make you feel sorry for him. He tries to look as pitiful as possible. He’s a little monster! 😂
@CDKTX @BBdemanda Yeah, my mom is like that, too. She will be here in May for my youngest’s graduation. Luckily, my husband’s family will also be out here, so it will dilute her potency, lol
@BBdemanda @CDKTX I mean, I love my mom. We talk on the phone daily and text almost every hour, but it’s not the same as being together all day. We’re going to Tahiti next year and I’m worried I might drown her after sharing a room for 6 days, lol
@CDKTX @BBdemanda I couldn’t do that. When we lived in the same city and she just kept popping in, I’d get so irritated. Now she can’t come visit unless she calls first, lol
@BBdemanda @CDKTX Definitely. I’m glad my MIL lives two states away. Even better, my mom lives about six states away. We’re too similar and we butt heads if we’re together too long, lol
@BBdemanda @CDKTX Well, she needs to put her foot down. If she doesn’t get this all worked out, she will start to become resentful of them both. She needs to put some boundaries in place and they need to follow them
@BBdemanda @ButFirstRoxy @CDKTX Oh hell no. That would be the last time she was unsupervised with my child
@BBdemanda @CDKTX Well, first thing, sister needs a dead bolt on her door.

@Cindylou178 just got back from seeing “How to Train Your Dragon”. It was really cute! You have to see it!!
@TVBossyPants These aren’t prostitutes. They are women being forced into sex slavery. The law doesn’t distinguish between sex slaves and prostitutes when it comes to the men (or women) paying for the sex, unfortunately.
@tonistark4real I’m sorry that you lost your fur baby that way. What a horrible loss! Can’t wait to see your new babies soon!

@SoSofieFatale @dagsly I think we might get something tomorrow. At least, I hope so. I hope it’s don jr
@ZacccIsHere @BBdemanda I totally missed that. I don’t know why they even bother with it anymore if they aren’t going to even show it
@BBdemanda I was thinking about how none of them were on slop. Do you think it’s because there were too many with dietary restrictions?

@dagsly @SoSofieFatale I kind of think that if the DOJ or the SDNY has enough evidence to indict trump and they take this all the way to the Supreme Court, at least one or two of the conservative judges would agree that he could be indicted. Aren’t they supposed to be for the rule of law?
@SoSofieFatale Same. But a friend pointed out to me that the founders wouldn’t have made the president above the law after escaping a monarch who was in England. They never would have envisioned a lawless president like trump because they had faith in the electorate. ☹️
@SoSofieFatale I wonder about Roberts. He seems hell bent on preserving the integrity of the court. I could see him ruling against trump on this, but what do I know?

@AimeeLynn28 The first trimester is draining. Get your rest, drink water, and take it easy. You’re growing another human. It takes a lot out of you!
@vintagewingnut I haven’t ever really been alone since I had kids, lol. I think I’d love to just have one hour where I’m completely alone. I’m not sure that I know what I’d do with myself, lol
@vintagewingnut I have three shadows in this house. I cannot go to the bathroom without Lily, Nugget, and Sophie joining me. I’m never alone. Ever. Lol
@vintagewingnut Max is a lot like my Sophie. She follows me around all morning and stares at me. But she doesn’t want cuddles or pets, she wants her cat treats. And she will hound me until she gets them

@tracieTweetsTv I think the tide is turning. Things are finally going to start going the right way. A judge in Miami just ruled that prosecutors violated the law by making a deal with Epstein. He’s close to trump and he most definitely has dirt on him
@tracieTweetsTv Hopefully the democrats can drive up turnout. I can see the ads already. “Do you want the GOP to steal another election?”
@tracieTweetsTv I think she’s walking a fine line and is showing that he’s a liar and not a martyr. She didn’t buy his apology and is making him do something that he’d really hate...remain silent. By gagging him instead of throwing him in jail, she’s got him on a tight leash
@tracieTweetsTv Lol, hang himself, not gang!
@tracieTweetsTv She’s giving him the rope to gang himself. We all know that he won’t be able to keep quiet. By doing this, she can point to how she gave him two chances and he violated both opportunities.
@dnvrsangel 🤞🏻 I’d love for that cretinous idiot to spend some time in prison
@Dan_H008 I like Riley.

@ECMcLaughlin My question is, how much does it cost the city or state to hold this woman if she can’t pay the $1000 bail? Wouldn’t it be cheaper to release her?
@gallymero @mswatson101 Oh, obviously he has a lot of work to do before he can be forgiven. And that can’t happen (for me) until he does that work, which includes any punishment and an apology
@AimeeLynn28 And he paid them with a check. 🤦‍♀️
@gallymero @mswatson101 I agree with you. I was just (inarticulately) pointing out that his case won’t change how I view future victims of crimes. He definitely should face consequences and if he makes amends, he deserves to be forgiven for this.
@bob_abooee He’s really going to be unsatisfied with his salary when he gets fired. Which he totally deserves.
@ShimonPro 🤦‍♀️
@gallymero But you’re right. He did this out of desperation and coming from a place of anger. I hope he deals with this and that he finds a way to make amends.
@gallymero I won’t feel bad for believing him at the start. He may not be a victim of a crime, but there are people who have been victims that deserve to be believed. I hate what his actions will do to future victims of assault and violence. Any punishment should include a public apology.
I mean, look at Nugget! He’s out! https://t.co/wHsHLCMRwo

@vintagewingnut @CDKTX I’m going to watch tomorrow, with husband. With Survivor starting tonight, I already got my one show to watch out of him, lol. He can’t do another one tonight. His video game would miss him 🙄
@CDKTX I think either Lance Bass or Neil Patrick Harris. The magic stuff is throwing me off
@CDKTX I mean, why? I don’t understand that fashion choice. Is he auditioning for a Bollywood movie?
@CDKTX That’s what I think, too. Now do the bunny
@SharonS027 I like all of the returnees and I hope they stay a long time. 😬
@chivon2go And then she gets out to the extinction island and it starts pouring on her, lol
Anyone else cracking up that Reem wished for it to pour on the rest of the tribe and then she gets out to the edge of extinction and it starts pouring on her? Lol #SURVIVOR
@zombiegirl72 Right? Does she not understand who Wentworth is?
@CDKTX I’m watching Survivor on Canada tv so I don’t have to wait for mountain time showing. Canadian commercials are hilarious
@AimeeLynn28 I’m sure. Everything will work out. Just wait until the little one is here. You have never felt love like that for another person, I can assure you
@GirlHasNoName62 No, it was a brunette. I don’t know her name. It always takes me a few episodes to learn all of their names. I always give them weird nicknames that tend to last the whole season, lol
@AimeeLynn28 Oh, I remember that feeling. I hope it goes away quickly. Other than that, are you ok?
@AimeeLynn28 Omg. Are you ok?
@Cindylou178 @vintagewingnut @imapettygal @gerry1076 That’s how Lily is. She LOVES to be outside. Especially if there is snow. I can’t wait until she sees grass that is green. She’s going to have a ball!
@Cindylou178 @vintagewingnut @imapettygal @gerry1076 Yes! That sounds perfect!
@Cindylou178 @vintagewingnut @imapettygal @gerry1076 He and Lily would get along great. She loves the snow. Nugget hates to be wet, so he stands on three feet and rotates which foot gets lifted up, lol

@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser It’s her standard setting, to be honest. 😂

@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser She loves the snow. She just rolls around in it. Nugget was looking for a place to pee so he could go back inside, lol. Right after I cut the video off, she tackled him, lol
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Here they are playing in the snow... https://t.co/k9YA5X7v9e
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser My sister’s dachshund hates getting his nails done. She has to take him to the vet to get it done, although they don’t have to put him under to do it. Nugget doesn’t like it when I do it, but he doesn’t give the groomer any problems.
@SoSofieFatale She’s a train wreck, lol.
@ddale8 His day STARTS at 11:30? Must be nice
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Yeah, and the baseboard thing is from when they were home alone and she wanted to go out. I told her no when I caught her and she hasn’t done it since, but I haven’t had hubs fix it just in case she starts up again
@AimeeLynn28 Hugs! Hopefully it will all work out
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser I know. A lot of it is because I’m still recovering from surgery. I need to do better about trimming her nails, too. 😬
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser She chews everything, lol. Toys, Nugget, my hand, the blanket, the baseboard near the sliding glass door (grrr!). She’s actually pretty good about sticking to toys. Never done shoes or anything that’s ours, thank goodness!
@SugarySpunFun @Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Thanks! 😍
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Um, not great, lol. I take it and put it next to her, let her smell it, chew on the handle and stuff so she gets used to it better. I think it’s because I once caught a snag and that hurt. I haven’t really brushed her much with it because she’s been shaved so short.
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser She’s 4 months already. They’re loose, but I don’t see any missing yet.
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser And they’re so protective of each other. The groomer said that they both cry and whine when she’s working on the other one. And then when she sets one down, the other runs over to check on him/her. How sweet, huh?
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser I think she will submit to him even when she gets to full size. He’s a curmudgeon, so she just ignores it and walks away, lol
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser She really has the sweetest personality. But she can be a bit of a brute, too. She yanks Nugget around or jumps on him. She makes him play. And I just noticed that she has two loose teeth! I keep checking, but they’re still there.
@CocoDaBear Omg. And now so am I!
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Omg. That’s horrible. My friend got a westie and the breeder let her come visit, but they weren’t allowed to touch the puppies for that exact reason.
@Dan_H008 @TinaBbfan @grilled_cheeser I free feed mine, which I could not do with our Bassett hound. She would eat the whole bowl and then ask for more. The shorkies nibble here and there and don’t gorge like Dixie did.
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Nugget is so possessive of me and gets snippy at people getting too close to me, but he’s relaxed a lot now that we have Lily. And she definitely submits to him and lets him have the toy or whatever Nugget wants.
@Dan_H008 @TinaBbfan @grilled_cheeser Hmm, I hadn’t heard that for my shorkies. I’m glad that I didn’t know about it because I would have stressed about it, lol
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Will they let you come visit? We went to see Nugget when he was 4 weeks old, but didn’t go with Lily.
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser I’ve noticed that Lily is much better behaved in regards to barking and other things than Nugget is. I was afraid that she’d pick up his bad barking behavior, but when he starts barking, she comes running to me to show that she isn’t involved, lol
@Dan_H008 @TinaBbfan @grilled_cheeser Is that a yorkie issue or just a general puppy issue?
@grilled_cheeser @Dan_H008 I think it is just personal preference for some breeders. I know that he couldn’t let the puppies go before 8 weeks. I think it’s a regulation with the USDA. Or maybe it’s a Colorado state regulation?
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser Also, neither of my dogs had ever been outside until they came home with me. Nugget’s first experience with grass was hysterical. He just kept sniffing it and rolling around in it.
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser He also shows shih tzus. Both of my puppies’ mommies were show dogs. He’s very careful with his puppies.
@Dan_H008 @grilled_cheeser I don’t blame her at all. Mine insists that the puppy see a vet within 5 days of going home and if anything congenital pops up within the first year, he will replace the puppy if requested.
Sorry friends! We’d love to keep this storm here because we need the moisture, but apparently it doesn’t want to stay. 😬 https://t.co/9OOYBZJbhJ
@HarrietBurandt @steve_vladeck From what I understand, Roger wasn’t gagged, except for speaking out on the courthouse steps.
@jennerific713 @IsItUpOrDown Maybe for St Patrick’s Day? Here’s hoping!
@jennerific713 @IsItUpOrDown I know. I was hoping for a Valentine’s Day treat.
@grilled_cheeser @Dan_H008 I got Nugget at 9 weeks because his litter was on the small side and we had to wait until he reached 2 1/2 pounds. I got Lily at 8 weeks and she was 3 pounds.
@jennerific713 @IsItUpOrDown I have a feeling that Mueller will be making Jr eat his gloating words soon. 🤞
@vintagewingnut @LizzerScizzor It’s true. They don’t delve deep into his drug use, sexcapades, or illness. It’s mostly about his relationships with his family, his band, and Mary. It’s pretty sanitized, but we left the movie feeling good. The music is great and Rami nails the character.
@AJDMaru He’s definitely going to jail, lol https://t.co/s5maZ6POEn
@steve_vladeck I suspect that his attorneys wrote that up and forced him to sign it. He probably would have been better off if the judge had gagged him. 😬
@AJDMaru I read it. That was definitely written by his lawyer, who definitely forced him to sign it.
@KellyAnnInDC226 And it’s #NationalDrinkWineDay , too. Enjoy your evening! ☺️
@Dan_H008 Both of mine had their dew claws removed. Shorkies have long tails. I could have registered them with AKC, but since I’m not showing or breeding them, I didn’t see the point.
@grilled_cheeser @Dan_H008 And exhausted puppy naps! https://t.co/yB5vRq09Ni
@SovSixLuv Oh, mine, too. He says that I spoil them. And then I catch him feeding them French fries from his plate. https://t.co/H88exUa90V
@SethAbramson Chris Cillizza is a hack. He’s always got the worst takes about almost everything.
@Dan_H008 Ah. Well, they should have the majority of their puppy shots by then.  Do yorkies have their tails docked? I can’t remember.
@LizzerScizzor @sciencelover03 @vintagewingnut @AJDMaru @4HappyFeelings I tried to get their “YASSS” faces, but I only succeeded in getting their “I’m taking a nap now” faces. In their defense, they’ve been playing in the snow. It’s exhausting, you know! 😂 https://t.co/1xoV0Js7HV

@aghren @TheRickWilson @NicolleDWallace @MSNBC When I look at him, I can definitely imagine that he’s got several women chained up in his basement. He’s creepy as heck. I bet he’s never had a long term girlfriend.
@LizzerScizzor @sciencelover03 @vintagewingnut @AJDMaru @4HappyFeelings Ok, let me see if I can get the kitties and puppies to participate. They’re often not very cooperative when I’m trying to get pictures, lol
@LateTweeter You’re welcome. I missed a lot of that show, but that’s the one thing I did manage to catch.
@sciencelover03 @vintagewingnut @AJDMaru @4HappyFeelings So cute! 😂
@LateTweeter 40 former national security advisors and such signed a letter against the national emergency stunt that trump called for.
@vintagewingnut We lived every minute of it, even when we were under a tsunami warning, lol. I’d go back in a heartbeat.
@vintagewingnut @AJDMaru @4HappyFeelings Aw! I want to snuggle Max!
@LizzerScizzor @vintagewingnut Well, hubs was still active duty and he got stationed in Colorado. We retired here after being here for 4 years. Now he works as a government contractor on base.
@andylassner And why shouldn’t she feel that way?  His supporters have trashed her just for being like every other normal kid her age.
@yashar I think that this might be the only food thing that I’ve ever agreed with you about, lol
@vintagewingnut Yes, we were stationed there for almost 9 years. As our reward for that, they sent us to Hawaii for 4 glorious years! https://t.co/ZWEvu9gnAY
@TheRickWilson @NicolleDWallace @MSNBC Stephen Miller getting spanked by Chris Wallace was glorious tv -Rick Wilson always speaks the truth
@vintagewingnut We’ve lived in Tampa, Dayton, Honolulu, and here. Since we couldn’t stay in Hawaii, Colorado is a nice 2nd choice. The traffic in Tampa is atrocious and the weather in Dayton was horrible. Colorado Springs is a nice middle ground.
@SovSixLuv Yeah, she definitely owns me, lol. She just has to make that face and I give her whatever she wants! https://t.co/pCGyC7Gdnl
@Dan_H008 When will they be ready to go home? 8 weeks?
@vintagewingnut Colorado Springs isn’t bad. We’ve lived in big cities and smaller ones. It’s more like a medium sized city. Lots to do and Denver is just an hour north. Lots of nature and wide open spaces to escape from city life. It’s very granola here.
@neal_katyal @MrJonCryer Can this be used by Roger’s lawyers to force the judge to recuse herself?
@iam_erika @SoSofieFatale They don’t care as long as their side is “winning”.
@yashar I guess she should have gagged him, too.
@tracieTweetsTv Lmao, bless his heart https://t.co/8mol4MiLug

@bribrim @BBdemanda @Cindylou178 I’ve been watching th news, too. About to get my second cup of coffee and have breakfast. Then back to the couch, lol
@Dan_H008 Omg! Puppies! How exciting!
@BBdemanda Ugh. I hate people like that. I hope you don’t have to deal with her crap today
@BBdemanda That’s tricky. Does she do this kind of thing a lot?
@BBdemanda Why is she wearing $160 jeans to work? Does your company have a fraud, waste, and abuse tip line? I’d definitely be making an anonymous report to that if they did
@BBdemanda Um, what? She should be charged for those clothes. 😬
This girl LOVES the snow! Lily would never come in if I didn’t make her, lol https://t.co/wQUMh0qF1I
@BBdemanda @Cindylou178 I promised the 17 year old that I would take her shopping, so I have that to do. And of course we have 3 inches of new snow. No one around here can drive in snow, so that will be fun.
@Cindylou178 @BBdemanda Yeah, I got up at 5:45. I filled the humidifier, made coffee, let the dogs out to play in the fresh snow, and now I’m sitting on the couch.  Not bad for an hour and a half, lol
@BBdemanda @Cindylou178 I will nap extra just for you! Nugget and Lily will help! 😬
@BBdemanda @Cindylou178 I think we need to declare a National Nap Day. It’s allowed, right?
@Cindylou178 It’s 7am here and I’m ready for a nap, lol
@tracieTweetsTv Yeah, having to wait for the next episode is annoying. I’d rather binge the whole thing at once!

@CDKTX @reneesasha @BBdemanda @TweeterTwit9 @chivon2go I actually ordered online from my great niece. If you order at least 5 boxes, it only costs $5 for shipping. We ordered 10 boxes. 😬 I think I may go order 10 more, lol

@grilled_cheeser 😂 my pups are VERY food motivated, so it’s pretty easy to get them to do things, lol
@Cindylou178 @lcrouse22 I’m the same way. I think it’s because I just crave comfort food during the winter. And there is so much fresh produce during the summer that we don’t get during the winter.
@grilled_cheeser I really love it when he rests his head on my head, like I’m a pillow.
@grilled_cheeser I had treats in my camera hand, lol

@Cindylou178 I love to eat a big bowl of cold grapes, but I keep forgetting to buy some, lol
@Cindylou178 My problem is that when I feel the urge to snack, I can’t crochet instead. I’ve been eating out of boredom instead of actual hunger. I need to do better about getting healthier snacks. Usually I have cut up fruit and veggies for when I’m bored. 😬
@LizzerScizzor I think he heard me trashing him for ditching me while I iced my hand. Either that or he got an upset tummy from all the snacks he scored from hubs and wanted me to rub his tummy, lol

PT was tough this morning, so I’m icing my hand and taking a nap with Lily. Nugget has abandoned me in my hour of need. Hubs is having a snack, so Nugget’s decided that he’s more interesting right now! 😂 https://t.co/BLffWeO7BT
@AuntieJafo 😬 yeah, I wouldn’t stray too far from the bathroom at all.

@CDKTX @vintagewingnut @BBdemanda Lol
@CDKTX @vintagewingnut @BBdemanda That’s similar to my theory. I think she had no idea where her mom was and when Dina called, Dina spoke in typical Dina fashion and told an incoherent story that Lindsey only half listened to. Plus, her show is tanking in ratings, so there’s that, too
@vintagewingnut @CDKTX @BBdemanda I just saw a tweet that said the ratings for her show are tanking. Might have something to do with it? 🥰

@guacamellerz Lily needed it bad. Girlfriend isn’t happy unless she’s covered with dirt and leaves. 😂 I’m going to try to do better with brushing her so she doesn’t hate it so much. Then I can let her hair grow out again.
The puppies had a spa day and they cut extreme cuts! Lily looks so different, but she needed this badly. I’m tired of picking leaves and grass out of her hair! And Boogie enjoyed the quiet time while the puppies were gone to sunbathe in the window, lol https://t.co/GMZRTU5GJl
@tracieTweetsTv He’s definitely got a lot of well thought out ideas about a lot of issues, which I like. I like that as he’s exploring a presidential run, he’s actually boning up on issues and is willing to express them.
@tracieTweetsTv I hope he gets a town hall on CNN since they gave that jerk Schultz one.
@tracieTweetsTv I saw him this morning on New Day. I like him. I’m not sure he’s got a chance, but I hope he polls well enough to get on the debates. He’s smart and he knows his stuff.

@vintagewingnut I know that you’re right. I still have bruising from the surgery so that hurts, then she stretched those muscles past where it was comfortable. Thanks for standing in solidarity with me! 😘
@imapettygal I know that you’re right. I’m just sore and achy, even though it’s not so bad right now.

@grilled_cheeser I almost feel like we should have put her to sleep right away, but she wasn’t suffering. She started going downhill rather quickly and her last few months were more of her existing, not living, but we didn’t know how things would go.
@grilled_cheeser When our Bassett hound, Dixie, got diagnosed with a tumor in her spleen, she was tested for cancer. It came back inconclusive so there really was no treatment for her. She was 14, so surgery wasn’t really an option. She passed away 4 months later when it burst

@renato_mariotti I’ve been wondering. Are they charging anyone who crosses or attempts to cross the border with a crime? And is he including these people in the whole “criminals are crossing the border” statement?

@GirlHasNoName62 I will. 😉
@talbertsmom @vintagewingnut @burrowingbolt @Dan_H008 @BigBroAlways @SweetBBfan @J_PopCultureFan I’d never spit on your grave. Maybe I just had a messy sneeze? 😂 https://t.co/J1pGcZZlft
@GirlHasNoName62 Thank you!
@jdawsey1 I don’t. If either can make it through the primary and take down trump, that’s what is most important to me
@AlyssaErin89 Your life as you know it has changed so much, but it will all be worth it! Good luck and enjoy!
@guacamellerz Thanks! I’m just happy that we were home when it happened.
@talbertsmom They’ve both got harnesses now. It scared the heck out of all of us.
@AlyssaErin89 Congrats! Babies are so fun!
@KyleClark @mamaluvsdev I think they meant using, not loosing.
@uractuality It’s so scary what could happen when we aren’t around. I’m just glad my husband was here to help, because I could barely hold them with my wrist still recovering. And I’m glad he could understand me because I was kind of hysterical.
@TinaBbfan Thank you!
@mswatson101 You’ve definitely got your hands full! 😍
@BBdemanda Look at his cheeks! I’d just be blowing raspberries all over those chubby cheeks!
@mswatson101 Oh, how cute! How many? It looks like a bunch!
@KRDONC13 Yes
@mswatson101 Aw! So cute! What kind of puppies are they?
@CDKTX @RealityRobbed https://t.co/rq2i1p1InO
@mswatson101 Thank you. We’re having a little snuggle sesh and nap now. Puppies are napping while mommy is twittering, lol
@RealityRobbed He’s probably a carrier of all sorts of gross things. Sort of like Typhoid Mary. I’d definitely steer clear of him and would never eat anything he cooked, if he ever did
@HoarseWisperer Right? But I’m not from Minnesota, so maybe it’s a Minnesota thing? 🤷‍♀️
@uractuality Thanks Melissa! They are now collar free. We got them some harnesses to wear instead. If she gets stuck on him again, at least she won’t strangle him! I’ll feel better about no collars when she gets chipped, which will happen in two months when she gets spayed.
@grilled_cheeser Nugget wanted nothing to do with her. They’ve all calmed down now, but it was quite scary!
@grilled_cheeser We have a baby gate to keep them in the kitchen/living room area, but I worry when they go into the backyard. If the gate is left open, they could get away from us. Nugget is chipped, but Lily isn’t yet. Vet wants to wait until she’s spayed. It’s such a big needle. 😬
@grilled_cheeser He is, thank goodness. My husband was just about to start mouth to mouth on him when Nugget took a big gasp of air and then he immediately started barking at us. That’s when I knew he was going to be ok. Lily was so upset and kept trying to get close to him to see him
@modestvixen Ah, but he loves squeaky toys! 😂
@imapettygal @reneesasha @CattyJargon It was a freak accident. We just got home from Petco. We found them some harnesses to wear that they can’t strangle each other with. 😬
@reneesasha @CattyJargon No, we were driving home from vacation in Oklahoma. We were 50 miles from the Texas border. Another truck driver called it in, but the Oklahoma highway patrol never did track him down.
@AuntieJafo I checked Lily’s teeth and they are all good. I was worried we would have to take them both to the emergency vet, but they both seem to be okay.
@reneesasha @CattyJargon I was driving in the left lane and a semi came into my lane and somehow missed my bright red suv during a bright, sunny day. He hit me and took off. My defensive driving saved us, thank god!
@CattyJargon These two just like to wrestle so much and Lily loves to grab the collar so Nugget can’t get away from her. We thought it was funny before, but no more of that will ever happen again
@CattyJargon That’s what I’m thinking. My sister leaves the harness on her dachshund with his tags on it. He doesn’t even wear a collar. I think that’s what we will start doing
@kizgold @AuntDebT Thank you!
@CattyJargon The collar didn’t snag so much as she got her teeth caught in the plastic clip that holds the folded part together, if you know what I mean https://t.co/ftFnXa5jEF
@reneesasha Thank you!
@AuntDebT First we are getting new collars or harnesses for them to wear. Then we will all nap
@Cindylou178 Thank you. About to head out to get new collars and harnesses to try to make things safer while making sure they have name tags on them. Lily will be chipped in two months when she gets fixed.
@TVBossyPants I can’t get the image of his face out of my head before he finally started breathing again. His eyes. It was so scary.
@CattyJargon I’ve seen animals do the craziest things like that. It’s head scratching how they do it
@CattyJargon Yeah, maybe they have some collars with easy, quick release buckles?
@CattyJargon I don’t blame you one bit. So scary!
@TVBossyPants Poor Nugget was terrified. And Lily was crying and trying to check on Nugget, but he didn’t want her anywhere near him. I was so happy when he finally started breathing again and then barking like crazy at us. Such a relief to hear him bark!
@CattyJargon Yeah, I think I will do that today. It won’t stop Lily from getting her teeth caught, but at least she won’t strangle Nugget if she does.
@CattyJargon And how scary to have Lincoln trapped in the bathroom like that. I would have broken the toilet, lol
@CattyJargon Yeah, I’m trying to figure out what to do about collars now. They really should wear collars out in the backyard in case the gate is left open or the wind blows it open. I can’t have them without tags if they get out of the yard. Lily isn’t chipped yet.
@CattyJargon Probably the scariest thing to happen to me since I was hit by a semi truck on the interstate one time (in my car). I’m so relieved that Nugget is okay
@JMO102324 Thanks, me too. I think my heart has finally slowed to a normal rate.
Everyone is ok, but there will be no collars in the house anymore. And I think I may have hurt my wrist as I was trying to get the collar off. We’re going to take a nap and see if we feel less shaken when we get up.
Finally calmed down after a scary morning. Lily and Nugget were wrestling and Lily was tugging on his collar. Her teeth got stuck, and she pulled away, almost strangling him. Husband got the collar off, but it took a few seconds to get Nugget breathing again. https://t.co/PyxcZyef2M
@mehdirhasan https://t.co/16Uyiuw4kM
For some reason, Nugget is obsessed with balls. Maybe it’s because we had his removed? 😂 https://t.co/PDZKEkUHPW
@theikawong Tamar. She’s won comps, she’s made good alliances, no one in the house feels like she’s against them. She’s also been entertaining as hell. Kandi has also played a good game, but it’s not as well rounded as Tamar’s.
@chivon2go My husband and I could finish a 1000 piece puzzle in 4 hours back in the day. I should get one out and see if we can do it again.

@PettyBettyBB @AJDMaru He’ll say that Whitaker was misinterpreted
@dnvrsangel He’s performing for trump. Trump likes this kind of boorish behavior. He’d like to get another job for this administration. He’s supremely unqualified, so I bet trump will name him surgeon general
@Dan_H008 @megatron_jones https://t.co/Z9zaazliSL

@tracieTweetsTv Definitely. As rick Wilson says, everything trump touches dies. Look at everything that he’s bringing down with him.

@reneesasha I have a mattress pad for my feet that has a heating pad in it and I love it. I’d get a pad that does the entire mattress, but my husband hates it, so I’m stuck with just the one for my feet. But if my feet are warm, the rest of my body is good.
@PettyBettyBB He’s so good! 🔥🔥🔥
@Stephen91734431 Great idea!
@reneesasha Good idea. I have a heating pad next to my seat on the couch, which I need to use. Lol
I could not get warm this morning. It’s barely 20 degrees, but colder with the wind. I bumped the heat up to 70 and took a hot bath. Finally feeling a little bit warmer. Of course, I have to go out again so that will negate everything I’ve done to get warm. 😬
@tracieTweetsTv Oh, he will. I’m glad that we have at least some oversight now so we can see these people stall, lie, and refuse to answer questions. This looks way different than when Hillary testified. The contrast is huge!

@BBdemanda @IsItUpOrDown @RealFriscoKid In Colorado, we get a lot of hail and other extreme weather, so even though our house is only 11 years old, we are on our second roof. We upgraded to a shingle that has some bounce to it to repel the hail. We will see if the extra money was worth it. 😬

@vintagewingnut https://t.co/FAIzKx3AjK
@tracieTweetsTv Nunes, yes, but I’d love it if McConnell and Paul Ryan are also caught up in it, too
Nunes better buckle up! https://t.co/WIMBLu8Sj2
@KenDilanianNBC @RupertMcStuff Makes me think he’s definitely charging someone because why would he want official transcripts if there was no perjury?
@jimmy_G236 Too sweet! ❤️❤️❤️
@dnvrsangel My daughter has a half day today, so we’re in for the rest of the day. Just waiting for hubs and other daughter to get in this afternoon. I’m ready for spring! Stay safe up there!
@dnvrsangel The weather is starting to get dicey down here in the Springs, too. 😬
@BBdemanda @vintagewingnut Lol, whew! I thought you were going to say “Toddler” or “grandma”! 😂
@BBdemanda @vintagewingnut What are you if you go to bed at 7:30pm? Asking for a friend...
@BBTeamNorth I thought it was just a double on Friday?
@vintagewingnut https://t.co/wNWxOReeDH
@BBnTagGames I know. This whole thing is a mess.
@MeganInNoDak Some weed, maybe? We need her to chill out!
@UgotBronx Yeah, I see that, but she doesn’t attack them like she does other people.
@UgotBronx I get it, but if she’s always going to be causing conflict, people aren’t going to want to be around her.  It’s not fun to always walk on eggshells around someone because they might fly off the handle at you.
@UgotBronx I think we understand why she’s a 36 year old virgin. 🙄 horrible people skills
@megatron_jones At this point, they should stop protecting them. It’s ridiculous
@megatron_jones Savage! 💀💀💀
The best part of having my cast off? Taking a shower without my arm wrapped in plastic! It felt so good! https://t.co/5t7YEd9quq
@SoSofieFatale She’s the new Jill Stein. She’s a definite no.
@grilled_cheeser @dunkindonuts Yeah, that’s a little ridiculous.
@dennisupdike @CBSNews Obviously that’s a typo. Congrats for finding that for me. Hopefully someone will give you a cookie for that

@CocoDaBear Lol, tomorrow I’ll have to take a video of my shorkies eating Cheerios. It looks like a puppy version of hungry, hungry, hippo. You can add it to your channel under the caption “Dogs eating cereal” . You can have a whole cereal lineup!
@HoarseWisperer Jagermeister 🤢
@HoarseWisperer Hi from Nugget and Lily, who refuse to give trump any attention at all https://t.co/UBftBDX1UM
So will Mother Pence https://t.co/Nc2rUsPI6G
@CDKTX @BBnTagGames Wasn’t she with him when he had cancer?
@BBnTagGames @CDKTX Lol
@Fighter182 She’s just living her best life. She has to see and smell everything. She loves everything!
@CDKTX @BBnTagGames I know. And Dina talks in circles, when she’s not name dropping and bragging about the fabulous places she goes to
@Fighter182 I know. I have so many works in progress waiting for me, lol. And the puppies want to start taking daily walks and I need both hands for that because Lily is such a spazz, lol
@BBnTagGames Yeah, at least Victoria thought she was playing. Plus, that crow story was hilarious
@GirlHasNoName62 https://t.co/LhwOm0eQ1j
@Fighter182 Thanks! It hasn’t been too bad so far. I’m hoping that the surgery took care of the pain and numbness that I was getting from the cyst. It was really hindering my hand function.
@maximusmom22 They pretty much are with all of these fish, ugh
@TweeterTwit9 @uractuality @ScaryDairy15 I have these wrist exercises to do every hour. They aren’t fun, but they want me to really get this wrist moving and stretched now that the cast is off. 😬
@cattybitch101 Mostly because they are too scared to say it to his face, lol
@tracieTweetsTv Kandi was like: https://t.co/i0MhPFt6Ge
RT @KevinMKruse: "It looks like you're about to say Donald Trump acted very presidential tonight and has changed course, when he's sure to…
So now NEM is just going give Kandi the evil eye?
@UgotBronx @Hec718 I love how sneaky Tamar is. She has controlled a lot of this game
@CDKTX @TVBossyPants Oops, I meant to say that Kandi said NOT if you nominate her first, so he switched out NEM for Lolo
@CDKTX @TVBossyPants So Tom said that Ricky is his number 1 target, then NEM. He has this idea that Lolo would be amenable to working with him after Ricky and NEM are gone. Kandi told him that she would if he nominated her first, so he switched Lolo out for NEM
@RealityRobbed 💀💀💀
They think that Tamar is working with them, lol.
@tracieTweetsTv 😂😂😂
I would volunteer to miss it! https://t.co/ZOPS8aPa6G
@BBnTagGames @_Wendy_L_ The chat with Kandi was a good one, too
@BBnTagGames This does not bode well for my eating plans this year....
@_Wendy_L_ @BBnTagGames He just told her that he wasn’t nominating her and that he’d like it if she won the veto that she didn’t use it

@ellouelle @ZerlinaMaxwell I love their noses! ❤️

@ellouelle @ZerlinaMaxwell What kind of dogs are these? Beautiful!
@tracieTweetsTv He’s going to screw this HOH up, too

@JoyceWhiteVance @ZerlinaMaxwell Very beautiful, but angry cat. 😂
@BBdemanda His idea of nominating Lolo and keep her as an ally is beyond crazy. As if she would work with him after that, lol
@BBdemanda He’s a mess. I sure hope he listens to her
@Cindylou178 @Dan_H008 Someone is not impressed with Lolo’s victim noises https://t.co/tpcK2WKW3C

@uractuality @TweeterTwit9 @ScaryDairy15 I’m glad. Mine seems to be going well.
@CattyJargon “I didn’t break the alliance!” Lol
@LaniJoy_25 That’s how he gets out of the deal with them, lol

@BBnTagGames Those two were blowing so much smoke up each other’s asses. I don’t think either believed the other, lol
@cattybitch101 I noticed yesterday that she doesn’t really clean dishes. She just runs water over them. Ew
@TweeterTwit9 @ScaryDairy15 @uractuality Thank you. I had a ganglion cyst removed from my wrist two weeks ago (elective surgery) and today I got the cast and sutures out. My range of motion is good and I’m doing physical therapy to make it better. Hopefully I will heal quickly so I can get back to crocheting and sewing
@ScaryDairy15 @uractuality Thanks Penny! Cast is gone, outside sutures are gone. My wrist is achy from therapy, so I’m going to take a nap
@talbertsmom @BBnTagGames Lol, I love him. I just noticed that he didn’t do a full watermelon, lol
@BBnTagGames But Gallagher smashed a quarter of a watermelon!
@megatron_jones You can drink while you shop? At ikea? That’s dangerous! 😬
@kivi2323 @Dan_H008 I do agree that tom’s best move would be to get out NEM
@kivi2323 @Dan_H008 The way that Lolo and NEM side with Ricky, who Tom distrusts immensely, makes me think that he’d target them and not Kandi, Dina, and Tamar. I don’t see Lolo and NEM throwing Ricky under the bus now...I could be wrong, but I don’t see it
@kivi2323 @Dan_H008 I don’t think I’d feel that way. We will see what the best strategy is if he’s still there. I think he’s gone at the double because no one should want to sit next to him in the final. He’s won comps and controlled a lot of the flow of the game
@kivi2323 @Dan_H008 I don’t think he wants to pit both sides of the house against each other. He needs allies. He has to pick a side because he’s extremely vulnerable during the double eviction. If he nominated one from each side, both will be pissed at him and he’s the easy target for the double
@Dan_H008 @kivi2323 I don’t think he’s going to do this. He wants to win. He will get rid of the physical threats so he can control who sits next to him in the end.
@DebiMossScheler @uractuality I know. I’m so happy to lose this stupid cast.
@DebiMossScheler Lol, it was barely morning, let alone mid morning. https://t.co/vw18f9KShL
@CattyJargon She’s vile. And yet, she will be confirmed.
@NeeleyJonea I’m going to watch the back of my eyelids. 😂
@CDKTX ☠️☠️☠️
@Dan_H008 I hope he goes for Lolo, NEM, and Ricky
@uractuality And the quilt is my favorite, too. It was the first project that I made for me. Normally I make stuff for everyone else.
@uractuality I get to go get my sutures out and my cast off today, which I am very excited about. There won’t be much time for a nap today, but that’s ok. I’ll probably go to bed early tonight because there won’t be much on tv with trump speaking in Congress tonight
These two got up at 5am, went outside, ate some breakfast, dumped the toy basket, and have now started on their first nap of the day. It’s only 6:15. 😑 https://t.co/5MSiyEuxMD
@LyndaShonubi She finally went to bed, but now Dina will not shut up and go to bed
Take the hint, Dina. Get out of the HOH and go to bed!
@ohnonotagain13 https://t.co/JneQuUGMLz
@AuntieJafo No. And both of the cats, both dogs, husband, and kid searched for it
Lily went to the vet today for vaccinations and I was completely shocked at her weight. At 3 1/2 months, she weighs 7.2 pounds. Nugget is only 9.5 pounds! Our Lily girl is going to be much bigger! 😂😂
@sweettarts8 I thought the same thing
@Dan_H008 Apparently we did something really bad in a former life. Sheesh!
@MeganInNoDak @megamuffin5285 Rockstar’s not too bad. They’re the only two I follow now
@MeganInNoDak @megamuffin5285 Lol, ok, sorry! 😂
@MeganInNoDak @megamuffin5285 Is it, though? They didn’t trust each other in the house and apparently, nothing has changed. 🤷‍♀️
@LizzerScizzor Aw, he did a good job! 😂
Lol, Tamar’s lucky wig.
@rhondarayna 😉
@rhondarayna happy birthday to you! https://t.co/j1mVVRaUiR
@talbertsmom @UgotBronx @TVBossyPants I saw Joey hide the ginger snaps in the drawer after he had Tamar try them, lol
@UgotBronx @TVBossyPants Oh, I meant that maybe he left cookies, too. He’s acting like a 3rd grader on the playground, pulling her pig tails, lol
@UgotBronx @TVBossyPants He was leaving Fritos under her pillow, so I bet he left those somewhere in her stuff
@BBdemanda And Kato is still Katoing
@uractuality @BBnTagGames @maximusmom22 Oh, for sure. And her legs are killer. I’d love to have her legs.
@uractuality @BBnTagGames @maximusmom22 I mean, she has great legs. And her body isn’t bad, but at some point, you should just dress your age, no? Or at least closer to your age?
Yum https://t.co/NaegM3E6c5
@cattybitch101 Right. He’s just gotten annoying. It’s not funny

@flaparia Is he the target tonight? I’m over him.
@cmclymer @BernieSanders @staceyabrams He’s not a Democrat. He doesn’t think a black woman can speak for him. It tells us everything we need to know about him.
@mswatson101 @uractuality @BBnTagGames @maximusmom22 Lol
@uractuality @BBnTagGames @maximusmom22 She was wearing a sports bra because she thinks she’s like Lolo, NEM, and Tamar 🙄
@cmclymer I feel like it’s the only way he can feel like he’s succeeded on this. And I think he’s going to do it before the deadline because he doesn’t want to be blamed for another shutdown. He doesn’t even care that this will likely be overturned in the courts. Then he’d blame bad judges
@AJDMaru @juliettekayyem I love her
@MeganInNoDak This is what I figured was going to happen.
Good, but gross news: Sophie, my cat, caught a mouse in the living room.	Bad, but even grosser news: she had no idea what to do with it, so she dropped it in the dining room. 	And now I have no idea where it’s at. https://t.co/1Ot5TbQlMZ

@BBdemanda Those will keep you looking snazzy after you beat @bribrim in your little running challenge, lol
@megamuffin5285 @IsItUpOrDown It seems like fraud if you don’t give the money to where you promised it to go. They used Kevin to get more people interested. Kevin should have gotten the $4k that swaggy and fessy kept for themselves. You don’t take an appearance fee that is more than what is given to charity
@BBdemanda Sweet boy! ❤️❤️❤️
@alexkidwell And I hope your dad has a successful treatment. Cancer sucks
@alexkidwell It’s so icky.
@RealityRobbed Not even a little bit interested
@bob_abooee Yes
@ohnonotagain13 @bob_abooee If that was the case...I bet he still had medical costs to pay
@ohnonotagain13 @bob_abooee They should have stopped billing it as a fundraiser when they realized he was cancer free and maybe didn’t need the money.
@bob_abooee It’s really sleazy to keep money for yourself after you turned it into a charity fundraiser. I mean, a lot of people bought the feed on YouTube to watch this because they thought the money was going to Kevin. To barely give him enough to pay for his airfare to Florida is gross

Honorable mention to Bailey, the cocker spaniel, and Stella, the golden retriever. ❤️

@maximusmom22 Oops. 😬

@ScaryDairy15 He’s doing “yoga”, lol
@axios @alexi @jonathanvswan We already knew this.
@CDKTX It’s annoying. I’d love for her to go in the double
@CDKTX Ugh, I should hope that none of these players would reward Dina for not playing. She’s had no idea what’s going on half the time. I wouldn’t mind a Tamar or Kandi win. Or a NEM win, actually
@Mrs_ARockstar @ObiWanCantSeeMe He’s so cute! Those eyes! 😍😍😍
@theikawong It’s a toss up between Tom, Lolo, and Kato for me. 😬
@CDKTX So Tamar basically flipped the entire house because she said she was voting Joey out and Lolo, Ricky, and NEM went along instead of forcing a tie. Joey threw that veto and they couldn’t even throw him a few votes? Well, none of them deserve his vote if they’re final 2
@mychiarinotion Ha ha ha!
@BBnTagGames Another reason to dislike that smug bastard
@AuntieJafo 😂
@AimeeLynn28 Well, it sounds like it’s a good day to stay in bed all day

@CDKTX @gallymero He seemed quite happy to be leaving, honestly
@CDKTX @gallymero Yeah, it was baffling! We have no idea how this happened. I haven’t watched the feeds, so I haven’t heard anyone discussing it at all. Maybe Joey decided that he’d had enough and asked to be voted out?
@bribrim She is firmly in the middle. It will be interesting to see what she does. Even if she nominated Tomato, I still think she’d be open to backdooring someone from Ricky, Lolo, and NEM. She doesn’t owe anyone anything.
@gallymero Something happened. Joey was evicted unanimously. I watched that episode and I was completely blindsided by the vote

@IsItUpOrDown @TVBossyPants @_Wendy_L_ Maybe he didn’t think about how it would come off? Sometimes people say things without thinking about how hurtful they might be?
@vintagewingnut Yes, she’s getting better. The groomer recommended a certain brush for Lily that I finally ordered, so im hoping that will help.
@vintagewingnut I think it’s because I accidentally caught a small knot one time. She did not like that one bit. I’m trying to gently brush her daily so she will get used to it. I think I’m going to have to get her cut short for a while until she calms down about the brush
@vintagewingnut My orange cat LOVES to be brushed. It’s his absolute favorite thing in the world. Nugget likes it, too. Sophie doesn’t care for it, but Lily literally cries and runs away.
Not to be left out, Nugget is sad that I won’t let them outside to get muddy again https://t.co/hOel6wKAML
@vintagewingnut You’d think I poked her with a needle. She was even more unhappy when I attempted to brush her, lol
@IsItUpOrDown @_Wendy_L_ @TVBossyPants I think she died?
@uractuality She’s still mad at me for the bath or else I’d comb it for her. She’s such a nut! 😂

@AuntieJafo Skippy has had a trigger finger with the fish button today. It’s so annoying!
@AuntieJafo They were being boring, so I switched to a movie instead, but apparently Tomato are talking to Kandi and asking her to pass a message on to Tamar about who she should nominate if she wins hoh. I bet that will go well, lol
@CDKTX I think once the girls move out completely, I will take over one of their bedrooms and turn it into the girliest guest room ever. And he won’t be able to say a thing about it since he’s already taken over one room and turned it into his man cave.
@CDKTX I like the pink, gray, and white look. It looks so comforting and girly. It’s what I would have if I could. Unfortunately, I share a bedroom with someone who won’t even let me have a flowery bedspread. Men! 🙄

@CocoDaBear Oh, she’s definitely crazy and overreacting, but Tomato pushed her too far, I think. They like to drop little bombs to stir stuff up, but I don’t think they knew how crazy Lolo was. Lol
@vintagewingnut https://t.co/yv6RzLdUB6
@SymoneDSanders I’ve not seen anyone saying anything of the sort. 🤔
@BBFeedsFan Well, in her defense, they’d just had a huge blowout and she was taking a time out to calm down. He shouldn’t have followed her into her room. She was doing what production probably told her to do in these situations. I do agree she has an anger issue, however
@NeeleyJonea Me too. I’d love a Tamar HOH. I don’t even know what she’d do. It would be fantastic!
@youhaveapizza @chivon2go 😂
@chivon2go That’s how I feel about the word “moist”
@vintagewingnut GIF dance off! https://t.co/91tTI8zh86
@chivon2go Ty said he’d be in his room with his carcasses. I knew that it wasn’t looking good for you when I saw that
@teresasalas @RealityRobbed https://t.co/hNLlLM1U6W
@vintagewingnut https://t.co/FazqS4EI5e
My hubs just walked in and saw Lolo doing her sprints. He sat down and said, “That’s kind of attractive”. Lol https://t.co/7EjjtzDLUi
@TvMonicaTv @IsItUpOrDown 💀💀💀
@tracieTweetsTv I don’t. I saw a schedule floating around, but I can’t remember who tweeted it
@tracieTweetsTv I’d love a Tamar hoh. What would she do? Who knows? That’s what would be fun!
@chivon2go https://t.co/waC6snDP77
@uractuality @chivon2go It was a low blow and isn’t game related, really.
@theikawong @gallymero 😂 these feeds were riveting today! A complete hot mess!
@chivon2go I know. I’m about to put on some comfy pants and make some popcorn, lol
@uractuality @chivon2go Yeah, but he was inarticulate with his words. He shouldn’t have said anything at all about it
@chivon2go , hubs just called and asked if I needed anything because he’s coming home early today. I said he could pick up Jocelyn from school and he said yes! I don’t have to go anywhere now! https://t.co/mubC8PiETP
@chivon2go Yeah, we had the same laminated countertops in two of the bathrooms, kitchen, and laundry room. The master bath has large tile, which is not my favorite. I’d really love to remodel our master bath, but two in college next year 😬
@vintagewingnut I’m ready https://t.co/gRkoQYJuTa
@chivon2go Oh, ok. I like to get people’s impressions of things. Thanks for sharing!
@CDKTX Lmao, but the fact that he was yelling about the yoga mat. 😵
@CocoDaBear Oh, ok. I was confused, lol
@chivon2go We just put a black walnut butcher block top on our island and I love it. We want to change the countertops in the rest of the kitchen, but we don’t want to put wood near the kitchen sink, so we were thinking marble, but we aren’t sure if we will like it.
@chivon2go It looks like stained concrete. I didn’t even guess Formica! 😂
@CocoDaBear Wait. Are you watching a flashback? I only see NEM and Tamar in there now...
@chivon2go What’s your counter made of? Do you like it? We’re considering new counters, but I have no idea what I want
@Carolinabbfan @ThatDameLana I don’t think anyone was bullying anyone at all. I think that Tomato like to drop little bombs to get a reaction and then they are overwhelmed by the reaction they get because they don’t expect it. Then they go and talk and wring their hands about how people reacted.
@CDKTX @tracieTweetsTv I tweeted about it at 12:11 my time, so 11:11 Big Brother time
@ThatDameLana @Carolinabbfan That is exactly what they did. And then they go and try to play the victim.
@Dan_H008 @jane11177 @BBnTagGames You can totally catch up when you get home. But there is a lot. It calms down and then blows up again. It’s never ending, lol
@RealityRobbed https://t.co/iRTNVy3aHD
@uractuality He nominated her, told her she didn’t clean up after herself, and that she should go home to her child
@Dan_H008 @jane11177 @BBnTagGames I’m so sorry. You’re missing the best feeds we’ve ever had
@Dan_H008 @jane11177 @BBnTagGames Why aren’t you watching Dan?
@chivon2go I better because the cast comes off on Tuesday. 😂😂😂

@jonfavs @trish_zornio , save this for future use....
@chivon2go Trust me, I thought about it, lol
@girlsmeg @Brass_Tackz Lol at Dina running out of the kitchen when Lolo starts yelling
@RealityRobbed https://t.co/O1QtGYuHce
@chivon2go I had to drive my daughter to work right after Lolo went OFF at Kato in the kitchen. I almost told her to take my car, but I still have to go get the other kid from school at 2. Kids are ruining all of my fun!
@BBnTagGames @Carolinabbfan They like to go throw a bomb and then retreat and wring their hands over the reactions they get.
@uractuality I missed that. 👀
@Dan_H008 💀💀💀
@chivon2go Lol, you thought you were going to nap to the feeds. https://t.co/meaHX2q9un

@chivon2go These feeds are LIT! No nap for Chivon today! Grab a seat and some snacks! https://t.co/41jzVgPQ2m
@BBnTagGames I cannot keep up with the chaos, lol
@jane11177 @BBnTagGames @PettyBettyBB Yes, that’s it
@BBnTagGames @PettyBettyBB No, he talks himself into it. He definitely likes to make himself the victim for sure
@BBnTagGames @PettyBettyBB Dina is trying to play the innocent bystander part, and she is kind of, but the more she insists on it, the less innocent she looks
@PettyBettyBB No, she was manipulated into that fight by Tomato
@CattyJargon 💀💀💀
@PettyBettyBB @hamsterwatch No, tomato is scared. They won’t pull the trigger
Oh, now Tom wants to talk privately? #CBBUS2 https://t.co/jpLh9UUQIv
@CocoDaBear This is why I believe that Nancy should have scheduled the SOTU AFTER this three week deadline for negotiations
@TVBossyPants @CattyJargon Supposedly he’s dating Rosario Dawson. Don’t know if that’s true or not
@CocoDaBear And I love that Stephen Colbert just kept his mouth shut and let her speak. The handshake at the end was perfect. He didn’t even feel the need to speak, to add some quip. He let her words carry the moment. Perfect host in that moment
@manndaraee I don’t think any of these current candidates will pull a Bernie and stay in the race longer than he should.
@manndaraee Definitely. And maybe, we end up with some of these on the same ticket?
@manndaraee I think as this plays out, we’re going to end up with an excellent candidate because, so far, we have quality candidates
@DebiMossScheler I mean, how is it sexist for Booker to add his voice to the conversation? She’s just flinging poop and hoping that it sticks
@RealFriscoKid @CocoDaBear @sarahkendzior Yep, I believe this 💯%
Wtf is she even talking about? Someone needs to take her crackpipe away. https://t.co/kVnSWCEfHT
@CocoDaBear Trump really wants to drop a bomb. It’s terrifying that he can actually do it
@melbrown0 Listen Ma’am. Kandi is about to let her have it! Get her, Kandi!
@IsItUpOrDown Right. I believe that Putin was giving trump his marching orders. Putin has trump by the short curly hairs and we all know it
This is such baloney, but even if they did discuss adoption, why is this the topic they discuss at almost every meeting when there are arguably more important topics to discuss? Syria, election meddling, North Korea, nuclear arms, etc., come to mind.... https://t.co/b6C6pg6vvW

@gardengyrl108 @jonfavs We’re purple.  We’ve got one of each, but we’re more blue now and we’re tired of Gardner kowtowing to trump. We voted for Hillary in 2016.
@AJDMaru Don jr trotted his little happy ass right into daddy’s office to tell him in person. He didn’t need to call him because trump was waiting for don jr to give him the scoop

@MikeyTigerLicks @DebiMossScheler @CattyJargon I saw that. It made my blood boil.
@MikeyTigerLicks @DebiMossScheler @CattyJargon I do the exact same thing. I literally cannot believe we went from Obama to this orange troll.
@imyourvolunteer @jonfavs @trish_zornio Hopefully I will be able to do both. 😉
@imyourvolunteer @jonfavs @trish_zornio I do follow her and I plan on donating to her campaign, which I never do, but since he has so much funding from senate republicans, she’s going to need every dime.
@jonfavs Since Senator Gardner just endorsed trump for 2020, I think it might be easier than we think to flip that Colorado seat.

@LizzerScizzor So was he on Celebrity apprentice at some point, too?
@DebiMossScheler Lol, I knew this would happen eventually
@chivon2go No, that’s not what I meant at all. @youhaveapizza is naughty and needs a spanking! https://t.co/z0OtkmrPQx
@Catvanzyl Tamar was messy in the kitchen again. 😂
@Cindylou178 ❤️❤️❤️
@LizzerScizzor She’s such a joy. She fits in perfectly in our family. I was worried that Nugget would be jealous and grouchy about her, but he absolutely loves her. They have a ball playing together. And she’s almost as big as him, so she holds her own when they wrestle, lol
@LizzerScizzor Oh, lol. Lily LOVES the snow, too. She burrows down into the drifts (not deep, just a few inches). She sits on the step on the porch and eats the snowflakes as they fall. Nugget is not as enthusiastic about the snow, lol
@BBnTagGames @cattybitch101 @PettyBettyBB https://t.co/mzI5AN2RCt
@LizzerScizzor Thank you! How are your puppies doing?
@BBdemanda Obviously, Tom was never a broke college student eating Mac and cheese for every other meal. 🤦‍♀️
@vaillan2 @ECMcLaughlin And like Elizabeth said, even if the calls weren’t to or from his father, it doesn’t mean that he didn’t just take the elevator to the floor his father was on to tell him in person
@ECMcLaughlin This says ahead of the meeting. These aren’t the blocked number that called him after or am I mixing things up?
@chivon2go Ow. That’s the worst! Make Queenie, Ty, and hubs wait on you hand and foot.
@vintagewingnut I ain’t sharing! https://t.co/7eDXFarPbB
@vintagewingnut None for you! https://t.co/FKODuy1igN
@PettyBettyBB @Hec718 Lolo is too crazy for me. I like crazy,  but that’s not the fun crazy. Tamar is the fun crazy.
@Hec718 @PettyBettyBB Never! Lol https://t.co/LseNEhINYu
@KKaiser32 I think she’s begging for a strip search and a full examination of her belongings.

@girlsmeg Lol, I’m sure he’s enjoying this conversation between Lolo and Tamar
@girlsmeg Talk blocking, 🤔
@TVBossyPants Right? That’s the most annoying thing ever. I appreciate the ones that have a “Skip to the recipe” button
@PettyBettyBB Lol, it’s perfect
@ohnonotagain13 @TVBossyPants @Dan_H008 @bbbtmenw @CDKTX @TWIZZLERS You’re right and Dan, as usual, is wrong. https://t.co/zn0kMSQ337
@DonnaWr93644707 Thank you
@MikeyTigerLicks Nugget absolutely loves her. He’s so happy to have a buddy to play with. And she calms him. He’s not so grouchy. She’s been such a joy to all of us.
@MikeyTigerLicks Thanks Mikey! She really is such a little love
@MikeyTigerLicks Maybe Kandi was close to winning? Or Tom, more likely.
@Hegemommy He’s hoping he’ll get free pizza

My friend has 3 dogs, a golden retriever, a cocker spaniel, and a Westie. Lily and Nugget will meet them this weekend. Lily was confused when I suggested that we have our own Puppy Bowl instead of watching the Super Bowl. I think she’d have a blast! https://t.co/yY25q600kf
@Cindylou178 I can’t even imagine how you and your family are dealing with this.  I’m so sorry that you’re going through this.
@trish_zornio I’m on your side. Let’s get this spineless twerp out of here
@ECMcLaughlin From your twitter fingers to Mueller’s ears! 🤞
@Cindylou178 Omg, that’s horrible. I’m so sorry!
The dogs are going to love this. Sorry East Coast and Midwest friends! https://t.co/cQUQlxBTdY
@manndaraee Omg! Crazy!
@AuntDebT @chivon2go I didn’t break my wrist. I had a ganglion cyst on my wrist and had surgery to remove it because I was getting numbness and pain in my fingers because the cyst was pressing on a nerve.  Thanks for the healing thoughts!
@manndaraee Yeah, I’d be taking an Uber, too. Being outside for that amount of time in those temperatures could be dangerous. Stay warm! I’ll think warm thoughts for you from balmy Colorado! It’s 24 here, but feels like 16.
@chivon2go Well, people have got to be paid! 😂 wrist is healing well. Kind of achy at night, but not too bad. My fingers are purple from the bruising 😬. I get the cast off next Tuesday, thank goodness. Then I start occupational therapy, if needed, to get my range of motion back
@manndaraee Ooh, that sucks! I hope you’re able to stay warm
Oh ffs, trump is upset that his buddy Roger got a taste of a real arrest. Did he happen to notice what happened to those 5 cops down in Houston? That’s why you bring force when you’re serving a warrant, dumbass
@chivon2go I just couldn’t stay up last night. I went to bed at 7:30, lol. I’ll probably watch feeds today since I’m still sporting this dang cast and I can’t do anything else, lol
@chivon2go Thank you for that update. I’ve been scrolling to find out who won. I guess that means Kandi is going 😢
Tamar was so cute when she won. I’m glad that she got it

@NeeleyJonea I mean, how can you look at that face and not just give her all of the treats? 😂😂😂
@CDKTX I know. He’s done too much. Do we think he will list this HOH comp on his twitter bio? 😂

@BBdemanda Wow. I don’t know if I could not know for that long
@Carolinabbfan @championpa1964 Best case scenario, for me anyway, is that Kandi wins veto, takes herself off, then Tom tries to nominate Tamar, she uses the power, then Tom is forced to backdoor Ricky
@championpa1964 @Carolinabbfan Someone pointed out to me that NEM and Lolo wouldn’t need Ricky as a meat shield if they got the girls together and formed a short term alliance to weed the guys out
@championpa1964 @Carolinabbfan Good point.
@Carolinabbfan You don’t think Tamar would go after Tom and Kato, both of whom will have nominated her in my scenario? Maybe use Ricky as a backdoor option?
@Cindylou178 @kivi2323 @Dan_H008 @CDKTX https://t.co/hv6OfYlN07
@Carolinabbfan I would love for a power shift. Please let Tamar win HOH next week, after Tom has tried to nominate her after the veto, lol. I think that NEM and Lolo have an okay enough relationship with her that they wouldn’t be her target, but I admit we wouldn’t know
@ScaryDairy15 I’m so sorry Penny! Thinking good thoughts for you all. Keep us posted!

@CattyJargon It’s because he’s scared of the dark, right?
@theikawong I mean, a lot of us feel that way about our favorites. I can’t even imagine watching a loved one play at all. I appreciate the people who have played and entertained us, but I really appreciate the family members who stand behind them and support them. It can’t be easy at all
@theikawong The shoe is very different when it’s on the other foot, huh? 😂😂😂
Lolo is telling NEM that Tamar should NOT be the target because she sucks at comps and she’s a hot mess socially. Lolo is smart. #CBBUS2
@AuntDebT Happy Belated Birthday to you. I actually don’t realize it’s someone’s birthday unless I see other mutuals wishing them a happy birthday. Lame excuse, I know. I hope you had a good day otherwise!
@TVBossyPants Trump doesn’t want to be president for real. He wants to be president in a movie. Someone should cast him in a movie if he promises to resign. Then Mueller can indict him and convict him for everything!

@Empoleon95 I hope you’re getting settled in and that things are going well for you. Take one day at a time. I always tell my daughter that every day is a new day and the past should be left in the past. People with depression are incredibly strong to put on a brave face to make it daily.
@Empoleon95 And they don’t understand that it’s not just a bad mood or feeling sad for a short amount of time. It’s something that hits when you least expect it. It can creep up and knock you for a loop. Or they think someone is begging for attention.
@Dan_H008 Girlfriend likes to eat, lol. I don’t see that stopping. Her nickname is the Hoover because she spends a lot of time cleaning the kitchen floors, lol
@Dan_H008 Agreed. Ricky is the biggest threat to Tom, not Kandi or Tamar. NEM and Lolo are bigger threats to Tom than Kandi and Tamar are, too.
@Dan_H008 I know. She’s a bruiser, too. Such a tough girl. She manhandles Nugget like she’s a woman of wrestling! 😂😂😂
My daughter suffers from anxiety and depression and at one point it was so debilitating, she spent 10 days in the hospital for treatment. And yet, she still feels she should suck it up and get over it. That’s wrong. You don’t just get over cancer or a broken bone. #BeIlLetsTalk

@BBdemanda I hide stuff like that and then I pretend that I have no idea what happened to it. I suggest that maybe the kids did something with it. I will admit that it’s easier for me because we have kids here to blame. Maybe blame the orange jerk cat? 😂😂😂
@BBdemanda @GirlHasNoName62 @vintagewingnut I think orange cats are the pettiest of petty jerk cats, lol
@seussey_cricket Perfect word for it!
@GirlHasNoName62 @vintagewingnut His name is Boogie. He’s a beautiful cat, but such a petty jerk! Lol
@sciencelover03 😂
@GirlHasNoName62 My damn cat decided to pay me back for making him wait before I filled his dish. He’s such as asshole! 😂😂😂

@tracieTweetsTv Lol, yes. It’s just that slipping on a shrimp is such a ridiculous excuse to nominate someone. Usually it’s the same old baloney “You’re a huge threat” “This is what the house wants”, blah, blah, blah.

@jennerific713 @AprilDRyan I think the same thing
@youhaveapizza @zombiegirl72 I like her, but I want to hear more from her and everyone else running as a Democrat. I’m obviously not even considering a republican. The rights of my daughters to make choices about their bodies and lgtbq people to not face discrimination are my #1 priorities
Hmm, I seem to remember hearing that this would be the case https://t.co/G7BqO9IVSz
@youhaveapizza @zombiegirl72 Oh, well, I agree with that. I don’t agree with anyone 100% of the time. I pick the candidate that I agree with on my most important issues.
@youhaveapizza @zombiegirl72 Why do you think republicans keep cutting funding for education? So people will not be informed or so they are so stressed about making a living, they don’t have the inclination to become informed. And so they will stay home or vote against their own interests.
@zombiegirl72 @youhaveapizza Jill Stein was acting as a spoiler, which she did. She knew she didn’t have a snowball’s chance in hell. She didn’t want to win, just cause chaos

@zombiegirl72 @Dan_H008 It’s true. I have a little sign that says “Dogs have owners. Cats have a staff”. It’s so true!
@Dan_H008 It would. He will eat the food on the top and then go nap. I won’t fill it because he literally eats the top food off and then won’t eat the rest. I typically won’t refill it until he gives up and cleans the bowl. Otherwise I end up throwing food away

@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes So, you’re saying that you’re not smart?

@tracieTweetsTv Yeah, you got a whole different experience. And I’m sure being seasick didn’t help at all. There really is so much to do. Beaches, hiking, wildlife. History! So much history! The palace on Oahu is so interesting. They held the queen prisoner there. She stayed in two small rooms.
@SoSofieFatale I think he’s always been like this, but it’s now gotten so you can’t say this stuff anymore, thank god

@BBFeedsFan I watched this earlier, too. Super cute!
@Dan_H008 And she’s got the shih tzu build. Her legs and body looks exactly like these shih tzus.
@Dan_H008 No, me neither. Hmm.
@Dan_H008 Her ears are floppy. The only yorkie thing about her is her face. It’s a real conundrum about what to do. Especially since I don’t know what her hair will do once we cut her puppy coat off, you know?
@Dan_H008 Lily is out there, living her best life. Digging in mulch, rolling in dirt and dried grass. Leaves stuck to her undercoat. Girl is a hot mess! She’s definitely a Tom boy, lol. And she LOVES snow!
@Dan_H008 I just don’t know. Last time was her first groom, so she just used the scissors to do a light trim. She didn’t use the clippers on her because she didn’t want to scare her with them. She did turn the clippers on near her, though. Lily is a disaster, though. https://t.co/zoHVHLFL6M

@kivi2323 @tracieTweetsTv It’s true! Ricky is a smooth operator
Lol https://t.co/Z6frQm3uuP
@kivi2323 @tracieTweetsTv I think so, too.
@tracieTweetsTv @kivi2323 I think Ricky, Lolo, and NEM are just smoothing things over for this week because they don’t want to get on the wrong side of the hoh. I’m sure things will change if one of them has power, but I actually think Kato would be in more trouble than Tom in this scenario.🤷‍♀️
@tracieTweetsTv @kivi2323 And it’s a way to make Tom more comfortable with Ricky. It was smart socially. Ricky doesn’t care about an alliance name, but Tom does.
@tracieTweetsTv @kivi2323 Lolo went and told Ricky, after talking to Kato, to go to Tom and tell him that he thinks Tom should name the alliance because Tom’s so creative. She said that Tom is feeling insecure because he has no power and this is a way to make him feel powerful.
@vintagewingnut Aw. My Sophie loves to lay on my heating pad and she always snags blankets to curl up in. She also likes to lay near the heating vents, too
@UgotBronx Bless his heart. ☺️
@vintagewingnut Maybe he hid something in there and was checking to see if it was safe? 🤔
@KellyAnnInDC226 @Dan_H008 @tracieTweetsTv She just seems immature socially to me, like someone who has been sheltered. My youngest daughter (17) is like this. She’s super focused on her art and isn’t interested in boys or girls really at all.
@AuntDebT @Dan_H008 @tracieTweetsTv 👍thanks!
@Dan_H008 @tracieTweetsTv CBS is glitchy. It keeps telling me there is an error or the content is not available. I’ve refreshed and everything. Shut it off completely and I’m watching ice skating instead.

@tracieTweetsTv @Dan_H008 Ok, thanks for the update. I can’t get feeds to load, so I’ll have to find a clip of it
@iam_erika Good.
@Dan_H008 @tracieTweetsTv She just asked if that’s why she is a virgin, right?
@tracieTweetsTv @Dan_H008 And if she is gay, so what? As long as she’s happy.
@LeoRule4ever Typos annoy me! Lol I’m such a perfectionist in that way.
@tracieTweetsTv @Dan_H008 I’m glad that Tamar shut that down.
@BB_Updates Thank god he finally realized this!
@Dan_H008 @tracieTweetsTv It could be, but it’s still cringe that Dina thinks that is the only reason why someone would be a virgin at that age. I think Lolo has been so focused on her training, she’s not great socially, so that could be a factor.

@melbrown0 He says he gave his word to Joey, but Joey didn’t take the deal. It makes no sense. Lolo said that he could go back on it by saying that he didn’t promise to not backdoor him. I hope she reinforces that.
@IsItUpOrDown Lol
@LyndaShonubi @BB_Updates I think it’s because she’s in the middle and is therefore expendable. She laid low for too long and didn’t make any alliances, sadly.
@manndaraee Yay!
@RealityRobbed Omg, especially if there was an emergency. 😬
@Mrs_ARockstar ☠️☠️☠️
@dwashtweets I’m just saying the way that they strategize together REMINDS me of Chill Town.
Actually, it proved, once again, that trump is inept and a complete loser who has no idea what he’s doing. And it says a lot that she STILL supports him. https://t.co/U7FNcTsfXD
RT @tonyposnanski: Can Republicans stop with the “Donald Trump is playing chess” analogy until he learns how to close a fucking umbrella.
Ok, I’m not saying that Tom and Kato are the new Chill Town, but the way they talk things over and strategize really gives me Chill Town vibes. They truly are a team and not playing each other, IMO. The way they talk to each other reminds me of Will and Boogie. #CBBUS2 https://t.co/OQSjoYE0H1
@_Wendy_L_ Silly putty. 😂
@tracieTweetsTv Lol, my daughter saw this earlier and said “Where’s the torso?”

@uractuality Right? Now I feel bad for thinking that some people were being weird when this same thing was probably happening to them.
@GirlHasNoName62 @vintagewingnut Oh, so cute! I love it!
@zombiegirl72 @RHAPfan21 @CDKTX And by her. Lol

@vintagewingnut If you could see all of the leaves and grass in her fur, you’d change your tune, lol
@Mrs_ARockstar @gwenzillas But I notice that none of the guys get this same treatment. It’s ANNOYING AF!
@gwenzillas @Mrs_ARockstar Yes. This! But also, they should keep their judgy noses out of her business. It’s up to a mom and her family
@Mrs_ARockstar Same bullshit they said to you this summer. As if they think they know what’s better for your family. Those childless morons have no idea what a mom has to do to take care of her babies.

@BBnTagGames Lol, you are always on the opposite side of the fandom. It’s why I love you! ❤️ You can find the good in anyone.
Wow, Susan had Ivanka give her a makeover, apparently. That hair. https://t.co/KuNYhMQRY6
@grilled_cheeser Oh, that makes me sad. It’s so soft.
@Cindylou178 Yum. Deep fried anything is the best.
@BBdemanda I’ve been married 23 years. You learn a thing or two after being with someone that long, lol. 😉
I want this immediately https://t.co/EaaiRyBsmQ
@BBdemanda Lol, when my husband keeps it up, I start talking about politics or Big Brother and he immediately gets up and leaves. Two can play that game, lol
@BBdemanda My husband does the same thing. I pretend to listen and murmur, “mmm, hmm”. Eventually he gives up.
@CattyJargon He pulled that number out of his ass, lol
@Cindylou178 Good to know. Right now, Lily has a slight curl to her hair, but she does still have her puppy coat. My groomer and I are still trying to figure things out for her. We pretty much cut Nugget’s hair like a yorkie, except my husband likes his hair short. It’s long for the winter
@Stephen91734431 Yours are pretty darn adorable, too!
@Stephen91734431 Thank you!
@Cindylou178 And does your cousin get them groomed the same or differently? Curious to know, lol.
@Cindylou178 Everyone agitates Tamar, Lol. She really gets offended by everything. https://t.co/AzYpfljYSv
@Cindylou178 I know. Nugget and Lily are both shorkies and they could not look more different. Their dads are brothers, so they’re cousins. Nugget has the shih tzu face, but yorkie hair and body, while Lily is the opposite. It’s crazy!
@DigitalBlunt_ 😂😂😂
@Cindylou178 @sciencelover03 Hugs! ❤️❤️❤️ https://t.co/a1Ihltac04
@youhaveapizza Oh, well, catching up is good, too. Sometimes you just need it!
Lily really needs a haircut, but I can’t decide how to get it done. Get it cut like a shih tzu or Yorkie? I mean, she’s got the shih tzu body and hair, but that yorkie face. What do I do? 🤔 https://t.co/yU9ldXWiTZ
@Cindylou178 Oh no. I’m so sorry. This is horrible. ❤️ love to you all
@Dan_H008 And I think it’s quite fortuitous that the parents are named Jack and Lily. I mean, it feels like we are all connected, lol. Your little angel, Jack, and my sweet girl, Lily.  So neat! ❤️
@Dan_H008 Dan, I’m so glad that you’re getting another pup. Now I know that Lily is safe from you, lol! These parents are beautiful. Can’t wait until you bring your new friend home. Will you get a boy or girl?

Lol, Kandi says that she’s not supposed to be eating bread. “Im going to have to pray about this”. This is my forever mood, lol. #CBBUS2
@BBdemanda @Dan_H008 She grabs a hold of his collar and yanks Nugget around. The way she man handles him, I think it’s more likely that she mounts him and makes him her bitch than the other way around, lol
@Dan_H008 @BBdemanda Lily is almost as big as Nugget already. I think she can handle herself
@Dan_H008 @BBdemanda Our basset hound, Dixie, used to do it to this one guy every time he would come over. She only ever did it to him. It had to have been a dominance thing, lol. And she was fixed.

@Dan_H008 She will be so confused, lol
@UgotBronx Wonder if Lolo is still sleeping in that room tonight?
@Dan_H008 He is. The vet said that some male dogs like to do that because it feels good. He’s a horn dog. At least he saves it for the stuffed animal and doesn’t do it to Lily
@Dan_H008 It’s not cute what nugget does to that stuffed animal, lol

@shaykhouston_ I know. It’s crazy. I’ve told my girls to never help like that and if they feel uncomfortable in a situation, that it’s okay to trust that. So many times women let their need to be nice overrule that fight or flight alert in their brains.

@BellaKnack This morning. I think Lolo was trying to keep Tamar calm last night after the competition and this morning she just lost it when Tamar was questioning why she was talking to someone for so long.
Omg, you can still see the orange stuff they used to sterilize my hand during surgery around my nails. I’ve tried to scrub this crap off and it is stubbornly not going anywhere!

@zombiegirl72 @xoxofeedsters Lol, exactly. My mom would eat M&amp;M’s and eat the color of the card she had so my stepdad would know what color to change it to when he played a draw 4.

@justsuchwow @BigBrotherazzi Anything that requires a battery and you’re pretty much good to go, lol. And make sure you bring extra batteries so there is no excuses for the toy not working, lol
@BBnTagGames And we’d still have plenty to talk about with Tamar there, lol
@BBnTagGames He’s just annoying. He was begging production to stop the comp because he was cold and it had gone on too long. He could have ended it earlier if he had jumped down. He doesn’t want to be there and that’s just annoying.
@BigBrotherazzi Lol, I always send my nieces and nephews toys that make NOISE. Just my little payback to my siblings who annoyed me as we grew up, lol
@DebiMossScheler I’m sobbing. Such a beautiful video!
@CattyJargon It is the best drop out from a competition on this show, ever. No one has delivered a performance like that and she will always be the queen. I’m still cackling. And not that she was panicking, but the screaming. It’s burned into my brain
@bribrim Lol, do you think you have enough? Might need to order another batch
@shaykhouston_ We lived in Hawaii when Tulsi first ran for national office. She’s definitely not a Democrat, just pretending to be one. Her LGTBQ stance is horrible. Her “apology” is BS
@Hec718 Right? Joey didn’t actually make a deal. He said that he was going to try to stick it out. Only jumped after Lolo did so he could save face. He never mentioned safety when he jumped. Not that I heard anyway

@SoSofieFatale I hate it when I have to accompany hubs to any work functions. I typically only give him one a year and that’s usually the Christmas party. I actually don’t mind hosting at my house, but I guess it’s because it’s my home turf and I’m usually busy with food and stuff.

@SoSofieFatale I feel the same way. I’m just happier at home, doing my thing. I hate crowds of people and would rather stick a hot poker in my eye than go to a huge event and socialize with people I don’t know well or at all.
@Cindylou178 Sounds good! French toast and bacon for me! 😂
@megatron_jones Kato won HOH. Rumor is that Dina and Tamar are his intended nominees. Maybe Joey. Also, Dina’s hair is green and she lost a diamond earring in the competition.

@romevegas It was Tom
@Catvanzyl Tom, I think
Tom is about to drop, I can tell. #CBBUS2
It’s so weird to see these celebrities doing the wall comp, lol #CBBUS2

@tracieTweetsTv Ah. Ok, I missed that. Thanks
@TVBossyPants @vintagewingnut 😂😂😂
I did not expect Kandi to be strategizing with Tom and Kato. #CBBUS2
@Mrs_ARockstar You’re not wrong
@tracieTweetsTv She’s mad at Dina, right?
@AuntieJafo The episode was a shit show. It left A LOT out about how Jonathan became the target. They spent so much time covering their asses for the mooch bailing
NEM is pissed at Dina now. #CBBUS2
@AuntieJafo Haven’t started yet. I think Joey said that he had to unpack first
Dina is shook. Her meat shield is gone. #CBBUS2
@TVBossyPants It will be live on the feeds soon
@UgotBronx He shouldn’t have been nominated. That was a stupid twist to start off. They should have been co hoh’s or something.
I feel sorry for Jonathan, but he really did try to do too much. Joey should have been the one to go, honestly. #CBBUS2
@TVBossyPants ☠️☠️☠️
I think the endurance comp on the feeds is a way to try to make it up to us for that stupid Mooch “twist”. #CBBUS2

@CDKTX https://t.co/FSf3sV6rjv
@tracieTweetsTv He’s doing it as we tweet right now. Tom is now talking about switching the vote again. 🙄 Tom needs to understand that sometimes you use people for votes and they aren’t necessarily in your alliance. It’s a voting block thing.
@tracieTweetsTv Yeah, he comes off as brusque. It’s off putting.
@RealityRobbed @NeeleyJonea @BBTeamNorth @Limaj95 She really is. She has been so great about reading people, but she’s let her personal issues with Kandi cloud her focus and it’s exhausting.
@hamsterwatch I do remember seeing something like that, but it was more subtle.
Tamar is putting a huge target on her back within her own alliance with this argument. She voiced her opinion, she was overruled. She needs to stop now. #CBBUS2

@BBdemanda Wait. I thought you didn’t like pizza? And hubs is off his liquid diet now? Yay! You don’t have to murder him with stinky puppy farts, lol
@iam_erika Right? Because the drama between Kandi and Tamar is way more interesting than anything Joey has to offer
@iam_erika Production got to him
@BBdemanda I fell asleep. Did Tom change his mind about voting out Jonathan?
@maximusmom22 Good comparison!
@AnneTSociaI Lol, I’ve only been watching the feeds on the roku because I can’t do the laptop well with my wrist in the cast. I’m right handed, so it’s hard to manage. Haven’t even logged on cbs on the laptop. 😬 not ignoring anyone! 😂

@maximusmom22 You missed awkward feeds. Tamar and Kandi were in the kitchen cooking together, but separately. Not speaking or looking at each other. 😬
@Cindylou178 Hugs Cindy! I know today had to be rough for you. Thinking of you!
@CDKTX @GirlHasNoName62 @BongRipsForBeto I prefer my senator, who read Ted Cruz for filth on the senate floor.
@Dan_H008 @TimbaKity I guess, but it is still kind of icky
@teemo2006 He’s acting like it was actually his idea, when he knows she would lock his ass out and he’d look like an idiot knocking on the door, lol
@kylegriffin1 Grocery stores and lenders shouldn’t HAVE to work with these people. These furloughed workers should be getting their paychecks and not having to take out loans and pay interest on money that is rightfully theirs.
@Dan_H008 @TimbaKity Well, I shower daily and after a workout. I mean, if I’ve been marinating in my juices, I’d definitely shower before cooking
Ricky is asking Tom some very deep questions about himself. #CBBUS2
@BrianKarem He knows he’s losing. I don’t see how they can negotiate without Pelosi because they need to know whatever they agree to has to get passed in the house

@AuntieJafo She still didn’t shower, but she’s working out, so hopefully she showers after
@UgotBronx And Tamar is out of those pjs
🚨🚨Tamar has changed out of her lipstick pjs and into workout clothes. This is not a drill. #CBBUS2
@LeCuyerVirgil Ditto
@mkraju So make him veto it. Then he really will own this shut down.
@BellaKnack Tamar could have run this game if she had let the personal stuff go. I’m so disappointed in her game so far
@PettyBettyBB And later Tamar will bitch about Kandi asking her that question. She will find something wrong with that for sure.
@BellaKnack And I just don’t see what Kandi is doing to her. She didn’t do a very good job of diffusing things when she talked to Tamar, but she hasn’t actively gone about trashing Tamar. Unless I’ve missed it?
@AuntieJafo Lmao
@BBTeamNorth Lmao
@UgotBronx It sucks to be on the outs like that and to have no one include you in the meal planning and prep.

@TourissaJ @TheCarterFilez @melbrown0 I don’t think she knows that she has to campaign, but since Jonathan is basically taking things for granted, she’s ok this week. Tom said that Jonathan hasn’t even bothered to come talk to him or leave his little clique, so why should he vote to keep him?
@TheCarterFilez @TourissaJ @melbrown0 I think Tom and Kato decided to let her think that she’s going so that she doesn’t do anything that messes up the plan. They said they may tell her that they’re trying and if she promises to keep them safe later, they will do what they can
@youhaveapizza She’s going to freak when Kandi stays tomorrow, lol
@TheCarterFilez @TourissaJ @melbrown0 She’s using the bro dudes as her meat shields. It’s a smart game play, but she doesn’t realize she will be on the wrong side of the numbers
@TheCarterFilez @TourissaJ @melbrown0 I think she won’t vote Joey because he’s part of the bro dude alliance.
@TheCarterFilez @TourissaJ @melbrown0 She said that she loves Kandi, but she can’t go against Jonathan because she’s known him forever
@TheCarterFilez @TourissaJ @melbrown0 Agreed. She’s at the bottom of every alliance right now. Not a good place to be
@DebiMossScheler @BBdemanda She does, lol. And an anal wax, lol. 😬
@BBdemanda @DebiMossScheler I know. I just trimmed Lily’s sanitary areas because she’s such a mess. She loves to roll around in the snow, dry grass, dirt, anything that gets tangled up in her hair.

@Dan_H008 @ScaryDairy15 And I don’t see much chance of any of these hg’s hooking up in the house in that way. They’re there for the check and to enhance their careers, not romance
@Dan_H008 @ScaryDairy15 Kato just took a Zicam in the storage room. I think they were referring to meds to keep them from getting flu/cold
@maximusmom22 Magic 8 ball, lol

@romevegas @Dan_H008 We got football live in Hawaii, so hubs would set an alarm to watch his college football team on a Saturday.  But super bowl was at noon, so that was perfect! 😂
@Carolinabbfan I Stan an evil genius that flies under the radar. 😂
@flaparia Go back to Lolo, I’d bet
@Dan_H008 @JanetAbner Kandi is a Grammy winning song writer, right? She wrote TLC’s “No Scrubs”
@romevegas @Dan_H008 I know. Time zones suck
@Dan_H008 @romevegas I use the Canada channel on roku to watch.
@Dan_H008 If she didn’t play so personally, I’d be loving her game. Instead, Ricky is giving me that.
@BBnTagGames @Dan_H008 I choose door #2.
I love Tamar in the DRs and mostly on the feeds, but she needs to buck up. I’m not feeling this emotional messiness she’s bringing right now. Girl has game, but she needs to let some stuff go and focus!! #CBBUS2 https://t.co/TxSEqfehzl
@ronnie12256 Thanks! ☺️
@tracieTweetsTv I know. I hope he keeps it up, though
@Catvanzyl @stinaknits 💀💀💀
@vintagewingnut It’s true. And Lolo can bring him back into the fold if Jonathan goes.
@tracieTweetsTv Mad respect for his gameplay right now. Hopefully he continues to perform!
@uractuality And Ricky stirring the pot, love it!
@Dan_H008 @chivon2go Just inferring it, I thought
@flaparia @CattyJargon 💀💀💀
@Dan_H008 I think so, too
@Dan_H008 @chivon2go She’s been blanketing all day. I’m so disappointed. She gives such great DRs and feeds. I hope she cheers up soon.
@Tooms_BB I think this should be a requirement for all future DRs.
@ttrenae Thanks! I’m doing pretty well so far, but I’m pretty drugged up, lol. Having a ball watching #CBBUS2 and tweeting with one hand. 😂😂😂
Tom drinking a beer in the DR, lol #CBBUS2
@chivon2go Tamar
The Mooch Judy chopping like Caleb is actually very appropriate. 🙄 #CBBUS2 https://t.co/EVnU0gkv5N
@gmarie444 😂😂😂
Love this! https://t.co/dkhzkFpRIt
Lolo really just called Ryan and Jonathan out for a final two, lol #CBBUS2 she’s crazy! Keep that stuff in the back of your mind! It reminds me of the hg’s who call house meetings! https://t.co/7FmVYbslXX
Did NEM just out her final 2 with Lolo in front of Tamar? Lol #CBBUS2 #Busted https://t.co/aLR4NAiWn9
@modestvixen Ugh. Maybe just mess some stuff up? Or is she critiquing you, too?
@LizzerScizzor Tamar is smart, but she’s so emotional.
@modestvixen Yeah, that’s tough. Maybe start telling her to do some of your stuff, lol. See how she takes it, lol
@modestvixen I’m glad you spoke up for yourself. Sometimes that is really freeing
@vintagewingnut He’s a love. A love Nugget! ❤️❤️❤️
@imapettygal @seussey_cricket Weighed myself this morning, down 45, officially!
@CattyJargon 😂😂😂
@seussey_cricket You definitely didn’t put it all on at once, so it will take some time to come off. Did you set small goals to meet on your way to the bigger goal? That helped me
@Cindylou178 Cindy, that’s a lot to deal with! I’ll be thinking of you and all of your loved ones during this time. Hugs!
@seussey_cricket Well, take it easy! If you hurt yourself, you will quit. I’d start slower and build up to it
@CattyJargon https://t.co/9pj5Y1aLFm
@Cindylou178 Thanks Cindy! I’m in good hands here, lots of nurses to take care of me! 😂
@CattyJargon Is she going after CardiB?
@AuntieJafo From what I understand, she’s channeling Audrey https://t.co/NhhPrQbZXB
@ScaryDairy15 Thanks. I’m doing pretty well, staying ahead of the pain. And I got to eat, finally! 😂
@seussey_cricket Hmm. What kind of exercise are you doing?
@tracieTweetsTv @jimmy_G236 Yes, THAT, I agree with.
@Dan_H008 Honestly, I haven’t watched much of the feeds. I’ve got them up now, so hopefully I can catch up
@BellaKnack It’s a nervous thing, I think
Joey doing dishes. Is he trying to save himself? #CBBUS2
@Dan_H008 NEM was sick with a fever, so maybe antibiotics?
@AJDMaru Not bad at all. Heavily drugged, lol
@jimmy_G236 She’s an Italian grandma. You don’t mess with them
@CocoDaBear You’re such a giver! https://t.co/531xPns3yU
@BBTeamNorth I missed a lot, lol
@ddale8 This is the most truthful thing to come out of the White House communication team. We all know that he doesn’t do anything
@BBTeamNorth Who’s missing? I count 12 because Ryan is standing just under the camera. Dina is hiding behind Ricky.
@CattyJargon Ah, well, that’s great!
@vintagewingnut Aw, I love that https://t.co/oaPRMgV94u
@CattyJargon For accidents? Or pedestrians? Context is important, lol
@vintagewingnut 😭😭😭
@CocoDaBear Yes, I have a lot of servants taking care of me, lol. 😂 I’m sure I’ll heal quickly
@chivon2go I’m so sorry! Hugs to you all!
@BBFeedsFan Thanks. I’m happy to have it done. ☺️
@jennerific713 @CattyJargon Thanks Jen! ❤️
@CattyJargon It was elective surgery to remove a cyst, so it was totally planned. No accidents or anything. I’m good now!
@gmarie444 Thanks! With these two around, how could I not?
@GirlHasNoName62 Nugget is taking care of me, lol. He is laying right next to me and snapped at hubs when he tried to move him. He’s decided that he’s keeping watch and ain’t nobody gonna stop him
Nugget is using puppy love to heal. He’s also keeping a rambunctious Lily away https://t.co/gvpAHUkxyk
@BBnTagGames Thanks. Ready to eat now!
@okchristy88 Thanks. I could eat a moose, lol
@ohnonotagain13 Thanks! Going to eat and then sleep
Surgery was a success and I’m headed home! Hopefully I can watch some #CBBUS2 feeds and nap! https://t.co/YaJC5sIF3Q
RT @laurenduca: Just waiting for Nancy Pelosi to tweet "Leave me alone I will dog walk you" at Donald Trump
@igorvolsky Keep the lights and cameras turned off
@TimbaKity @PettyBettyBB But isn’t that where the gym is? Or is that another room up there?
@CattyJargon ☠️☠️☠️
@PettyBettyBB That’s new. I hadn’t heard that before
@ScaryDairy15 Already?
@CattyJargon 🙄 I love Tamar, but she’s the one stirring up this drama from what I have seen
He’s a quitter, for sure. https://t.co/2kSNmuUJCX
@maximusmom22 I just don’t know what Kandi did to Tamar. I mean, if this is from the past beef, Tamar needs to let it go. It’s affecting her game and people are going to get tired of dealing with her
@BBnTagGames Spin if I ever heard it
@imapettygal Thanks Debra!
@CattyJargon Sounds like NEM was sick? Had a fever?
@GirlHasNoName62 Tell me about it! At least we leave in an hour or so to head to the hospital.
@GirlHasNoName62 Yeah, so far the worst thing is that I’m starving and thirsty. I’ve already planned for hubs to have a bottle of water and some crackers in his pockets so that I can eat and drink after I’m out of recovery. 🤤
Hmm. https://t.co/HHYTEouAuK
@BBdemanda I mean, I have 3 more hours until I report, which means, surgery probably isn’t until noon. I’m so irritated already. 😡
@zombiegirl72 Lol, I don’t blame you. 😂😂😂
@zombiegirl72 Um, it looks like a penis. 😂
@BBdemanda Thanks! I think the worst of it is that I cannot eat or drink until surgery. I don’t report until 11am. It’s 7:30 now. I don’t know how I’m going to survive, lol
@GirlHasNoName62 I have a ganglion cyst that I am having removed from my wrist. It’s not that big a thing, but it’s been giving me pain and numbness, so they’re just going to take it out. I’ll have some occupational therapy afterwards to get motion back, 🤞
@KeishaBee626 @davidfrum @TheRickWilson That’s what I’ve gathered since the live feeds started. They’re going to spin it, probably.
@CDKTX Resist! He’s pretty, but dumb! Don’t do that to your babies!
@davidfrum @TheRickWilson Too cruel, since he’s apparently quit before the first eviction. He lasted more days in the White House, lol
@vintagewingnut Thank you. I’m a little nervous, but I know it will be fine. 😬
@megatron_jones 😂
@Carolinabbfan No, he was 1/11th of a mooch short. 😂😂😂
@BBdemanda I feel like they should always have celebrities that have feuds on together. This is exciting!
@Dan_H008 @tracieTweetsTv Is he really trying to tell an Olympic athlete how to work out? It’s like Joshua telling Mark McGrath how to sing. 🙄
@BBdemanda I hope they talk her down. I didn’t even see where Kandi did anything to make her so upset
@BBdemanda What? Is she gonna walk too?
@BBdemanda 😢
@stinaknits @vintagewingnut This aged well, like a fine wine or a stinky cheese. 😂
@jimmy_G236 ☠️☠️☠️
@BBdemanda Darn! I really wanted that to work out. Unless they are pretending to hate each other so they don’t become a target? 🤔
@ThatDameLana Thanks! And I don’t have to give them some popcorn, they steal it, lol.
@AuntieJafo Thanks! I hope to be back to crocheting soon!
@Mrs_ARockstar @ScaryDairy15 I imagine it must be surreal to see these celebrities in your house, lol
I’m having a late night snack because I can’t eat after midnight due to surgery for my wrist. I’ve got the live feeds on, yay! And these two are mad that I won’t share my popcorn. https://t.co/ZaZNGcQOFR
@AuntieJafo I’d love an endless pool.  Not sure how much use I’d get out of it during the winter.
@TVBossyPants @BBdemanda Do not want to see her at all https://t.co/nEQ88UnqTp
@TVBossyPants @BBdemanda 👀 wow. He lasted longer in the White House. 😂😂😂
@BBdemanda Someone said the Mooch self evicted. Is that true?
Well, it seems the guys are going to take each other out. I’m not too mad about it, but I hope Tom stays for a while. #CBBUS2
Ricky has laid so low, I forgot he was there. 🤷‍♀️ #CBBUS2
@PettyBettyBB He’s cracking me up. I love watching the faces he makes, too
@BBnTagGames Ouch! https://t.co/eb87vdnLla

@TVBossyPants Yep, you made your bed, now Mooch in it!
Lol, Kato walks in and says “Hi guys, my name’s Kato” #CBBUS2

Lol Tom, maybe they’ve resolved everything since we’ve been in here. 😂😂😂 #CBBUS2
Ryan thinks his training won’t stop. Um, they are locked in A LOT. That pool is going to dry out from un-use, lol. #CBBUS2
@IsItUpOrDown And a 7 person alliance out of 12 people? That’s gonna blow up epically
@tracieTweetsTv @bob_abooee Her dress today is like a reject from a flower girl shop. It’s god awful
Joey just shot down the idea of an alliance. 😳 #CBBUS2
@GirlHasNoName62 @BBTeamNorth Too true!
@grilled_cheeser Yes!
Tamar gives the best DRs this season, hands down. #CBBUS2

@politico I think she should agree to hold a vote. And she should let it fail, as it will. Elections have consequences. Trump wrote off the house and now he will pay for that move
@Carolinabbfan Happy Birthday to you!
@DebiMossScheler Well, he likes the warm towel and snuggles, obviously! He’s a smart boy!
@DebiMossScheler She has a lot more hair than he does. It’s thicker, so the snow doesn’t penetrate as fast. Poor Nugget hates being cold and wet, so he’s not as happy to see the white stuff, lol

@seussey_cricket The good thing is that this is only 3 weeks, so there is less chance for him to annoy us too much

@GirlHasNoName62 Oh my. I keep a blanket in the car, but I think I need to keep more than that. Water, blankets, granola bars, etc. I mean, we live in the city limits, so I don’t ever see myself being stranded at home, but if we’re traveling across country, then yes
@cmclymer Considering that these military members have volunteered to fight for this country when no one in the first family, including the so called POTUS, never even considered it, is the real cruel blow to transgender Americans who are willing to sacrifice to serve
@chivon2go Hopefully this crap clears up. My wrist surgery is supposed to be tomorrow, but it’s on the Air Force Academy, which is in the mountains, so....🤷‍♀️

This is a little terrifying to even think about https://t.co/7oBLqkngPt

@LeoRule4ever @CocoDaBear I’m not actually interested in dwelling on this anymore. I have my view on it and you have yours and that’s ok. I believe that the kids were being verbally attacked by the black protesters and that the Indian gentleman saw this and tried to diffuse the situation.
@chivon2go We don’t have much snow at all, but the wind is blowing it all over the place and visibility is crap. I wish I didn’t have to go anywhere, but Lily has a vet appointment today. Hopefully this dies down by then or the vet closes
Omg, same! No one wants to see that troll in the shower! https://t.co/vGFxEJnOCM
@CattyJargon 🔥🔥🔥 love that!
Welp, daughter’s school just got canceled for the day. Snow day!
@seussey_cricket One of the high schools in our district makes the students have an e-learning day, poor kids! They don’t get to sleep in or play. 😢
@Cindylou178 Yeah, we have more snow for Thursday, supposedly
@LeoRule4ever @CocoDaBear There are other videos showing more than just those cheers. I think they were doing a lot more than that and they deserve to be in hot water, but I don’t think all of Twitter should know who they are
@Cindylou178 Normally, I do too. I’ve been laying in bed for the past hour listening to the wind. Kid’s school is already delayed, but other schools are closing, so I think hers will, too. Lily has a vet appointment, so I have to drive in this crap. Hope it dies down by then
@Cindylou178 Nugget was snoring in my ear half the night, but I wasn’t sleeping well anyway because of the wind blowing. The whole house is shaking!
We’re having an actual blizzard and I just let the dogs outside to potty. Lily cried and peed on the mat outside. Nugget ran to the side of the house, peed, and ran back in. Both are now curled up under the blankets to get warm now. I need a grass patch in the garage, lol

@seussey_cricket That’s great! Relearning how to cook without all of the processed food has been nice. Now I know exactly what I’m eating and I feel good about it
@AuntieJafo Lol, yeah, that does put a damper on things
@AuntieJafo Come on over! We’ve got plenty! 😉
@jimmy_G236 That’s so sweet https://t.co/Z8BI2FaQkG
@seussey_cricket I’ve found that if I deprive myself, especially on vacation, I really resent it. That’s no way for success. You have to live and sometimes that means eating what you want. Just don’t let it be an everyday thing. Stick to steamed veggies or grilled chicken and fish where you can
@seussey_cricket I feel so much better eating healthier, so I just tend to gravitate toward healthier foods now.
@seussey_cricket I don’t really consider it a diet anymore. It’s my lifestyle now. I just make better choices now. But if I do want that bacon cheeseburger with fries, I have them. I just make healthier choices for my next meals. And honestly, if I eat too much crappy food, I don’t feel good
@seussey_cricket Every day is a new day, so you just leave the past behind you and get back to it. If you work the diet, it works for you.
@seussey_cricket After a year, I’ve found that I can have the cookie or glass of wine or whatever, but as long as I hold myself accountable for it, I can get back on track and still lose weight. I’ve gone on vacation for a week, eaten what I’ve wanted, gained weight, but lost it again
@melbrown0 I sure hope so!
@seussey_cricket I’m using 96% lean ground beef, so it’s healthier. I’ve been doing weight watchers for a year and I’m down 46 pounds. I’m a turtle, slowly losing, but still losing!
Since we are getting a storm this evening, or so the weatherman says, I’m craving comfort food. I found a recipe for a skillet shepherds pie that looks amazing. Making my homemade mashed potatoes in the instant pot and I’m already salivating at the thought of this dinner! 🤤
@notafanbaby @SoSofieFatale Exactly. With enough political pressure, candidates can and do follow the will of the voters
@SoSofieFatale It’s the reason they gave for not voting for the most qualified candidate we’ve had in decades. They didn’t agree with her 100%, so they either didn’t vote or voted for trump. It’s so stupid. I don’t agree with anyone 100% on anything.
@SoSofieFatale People don’t seem to understand that you can vote for someone even if you don’t agree with them 100%. They sort of stammer and stutter when I say, “Oh, so you do agree with all of trump’s racist policies, since you voted for him, right?”
@TVBossyPants @CocoDaBear @BBdemanda @Dan_H008 And I just want to boop his snoot! He’s so cute!

@GirlHasNoName62 @Dan_H008 @ParisZarcilla @CocoDaBear We got to go to Harry Potter world in Orlando at Universal and I was in heaven! The Escape from Gringotts ride is so fun!
@GirlHasNoName62 @Dan_H008 @ParisZarcilla @CocoDaBear Love that!
@GirlHasNoName62 @Dan_H008 @ParisZarcilla @CocoDaBear I was feeling really anxious and resentful after seeing some stuff on the news, so I decided a reread was in order. The Harry Potter books are full of hope and love and always are a comfort to me (mostly).
@Dan_H008 @BBdemanda @CocoDaBear It’s not a shopping catalog, lol
Lmao, Tamar just keeps putting grapes in her mouth as Tom asks Kato if OJ will be walking through that door. Then he asks her “How are the grapes?” He’s going to make her choke! https://t.co/fJA9chZTjC

@chivon2go This is my favorite marinade to use for poultry. So, this may sound gross, but peel up the skin and rub the marinade in between the breasts and the skin. It will make it really moist and will get the flavor into the meat
@chivon2go You don’t really need to do that, especially with the seasonings and oil, if you use that. It will brown nicely in the oven
@GirlHasNoName62 They love to be outside. Not so much when it’s cold and windy, but we’re at 57 right now, although once the storm blows in over the mountains, we will be in the teens, I think
@GirlHasNoName62 @Dan_H008 @ParisZarcilla @CocoDaBear Just started re reading the Harry Potter series again. I do it annually, sometimes more than that. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve read them. Dozens at least
@GirlHasNoName62 They gave up and decided to go outside. It’s just windy and the temps aren’t too bad now. We’re due to get a storm tonight, so they better enjoy the sun today

@teresasalas @CocoDaBear I agree. I don’t feel like he was trying to diffuse the situation with a smile, like he claims. He was smirking and all of his friends were recording it and egging him on. He’s had help writing this letter to put himself in the best light. Never takes responsibility at all

@DigitalBlunt_ @Cindylou178 In our school district here in Colorado, it’s up to the parents to decide if their kids go to school if the school is open during inclement weather. Normally our district delays or closes at the drop of a flake, but if they don’t, they will give excused absences if parents call
@CocoDaBear I think that there are several versions of the story, but if you try to think about the one that makes the most sense, the idea that the Indian elder was trying to diffuse an ugly situation between the kids and the black protesters, it makes more sense to me.

@okchristy88 He was smirking and his little friends were filming it. He wasn’t smiling to show the elder that he was being friendly. What a load of hogwash. I do believe that Nathan saw the confrontation between these kids and the other group and stepped in the middle to diffuse it.
