We think the beef industry will continue to be profitable. The early part of the next decade could see calf prices soften, but cow-calf producers should stay profitable says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Fake meat will become more cost competitive and will gain market share. “We’re not going to stop it.” The production costs are going to get lower. We’ll need to do what we can as an industry to keep it inbounds says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
This new group of consumers has higher expectations. Let’s not make the same mistake we made in the 1980s and 1990s says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
"Consumers love what you are providing" says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Since 1990, there has been an annual increase of 7.7% for beef, pork and poultry exports. Trade matters for protein producers. We’re forecasting that beef exports will be up 6% says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
This year we’re going to have 1.8 billion increase in beef, pork and poultry production. Where would we be if we didn’t have export markets for red meat and poultry? says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Cow-calf producers have been profitable as a sector since 1998. Those numbers haven’t always been high. But nobody in the beef business can be profitable unless cow-calf producers are able to profit says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Avoid #cattle transport during #PolarVortex - the negative temps are even more dangerous for #cattle in trailers at highway speeds 	- @LvstkWriter https://t.co/5dDvKDTfWZ
Going forward, are will willing to make those changes that consumers want. Whether that is source verified or traceability…we need to respond to consumer demand signals says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
If we didn’t respond to this demand signal to improve carcass quality fed cattle would be $20/cwt less and calf prices would be $50/cwt says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We have moved the Choice-Prime percentage from 55% in 2007 to 79% this past year and 80% for next year. This increase in quality has helped improve demand says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We are still in a cattle cycle. We didn't have much of a cycle in the 2000s or 1990s. However, we don't expect the same boom-bust cycle going forward that happened this decade says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Annual fed cattle marketings in Kansas have seen the largest gains from the cycle low of 2015 with 763,000 more fed cattle marketed in 2018 compared to three years ago says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Bottom line feedyards are full. The cow herd is up 3 million head from the cycle low says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
The Long Term Outlook is now being shared by Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
2019 Cattle Price Forecast Average		  · Fed Cattle = $117/cwt	  · 750 lb. Feeder Steer = $147/cwt	  · 550 lb. Steer Calf = $164/cwt	  · Utility Cow = $55/cwt	  · Bred Cows = $1,550/head	  	 @cattlefax #CattleCon19
About 22% of the value of a fed steer is exported. For 2019 it is projected that exports will add $360 in per head value says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
There is a lot of competition at retail. The percentage of ads by retailers is growing for beef while chicken has been losing says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We feel like African Swine Fever in other countries should help move more pork overseas, which should be beneficial to domestic meat competition says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Per capita beef consumption looks to hold around 57 lb. during the next year says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We are a net beef exporter in terms of tonnage. We’re pretty optimistic that trade will help continue to drive the market says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
There is a 3% difference in typical carcass weight because of the weather. This results in less tonnage and it is taking more time to get cattle to a finished weight, which is impacting leverage says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Prices could be up because of the weather impacting feedlot efficiencies. Since CattleFax started taking data, we’ve had the wettest winter for cattle feeding states since 1984 says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We expect the dairy industry to contract by another 30,000 to 40,000 head of cows that could be culled because of depressed milk prices says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
The cow-calf producers have been generally profitable during the past five years and during that time Mother Nature has been generally good to us says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Inventory numbers have rebounded due to profitability and good grazing conditions says Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
The 2018 Supply, Demand and Outlook for 2019 is being given by Kevin Good @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We’re going to raise a very large hay crop in 2019. As a result we should see relief for hay prices says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Trendline yield of 176.1 will tighten 2019-20 projected stocks to use near 11 percent says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
The lack of soybean export to China has resulted in more soybeans domestically in-stock. We’re projecting a flip of 2 million acres for soybeans going to corn because of this says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
The U.S. is the driver of the global corn market. The important part is where we sit domestically. USDA will release the annual update on Feb. 8. The key will be on demand says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Again, a key concern for economic growth is trade with China. The Purchasing Managers Index for China has had multiple months of contraction says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Unemployment is hovering around sub-4% and household income has been on the rise for the past five years. This has helped keep the economy going. We project GDP growth of 2-2.5% during 2019 says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
A major trade concern is the trade dispute with China. The biggest impact for agriculture has been the tariffs put on soybeans and pork exported from the U.S. to China. We need to have a trade agreement for stability says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
There is a lot of uncertainty with Brexit and its impact on the European Union. This could result in some market volatility from those countries says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19
It is critical that we have the USMCA trade deal go through to continue trading with Mexico and Canada says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #CattleCon19

Mike Murphy is giving an outlook on the Economy, Energy and Feedstuffs now @cattlefax #CattleCon19
From Texas to Nebraska it projects to be more rain during the Spring and the Northwest looks to have above normal precipitation as well says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19
The Spring should bring below normal precipitation through the Midwest dipping down to the Southeast. This should help at planting since it has been abnormally wet says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We’re getting ready for a big series of storms in the Southwest during the next few months, which should help with the drought says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19
In the U.S., drought has contracted in the Southeast and Plains after above average precipitation. The Southwest is the primary region of the country that is still experiencing drought starting out 2019 says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Australia could continue to go through drought during the next year because of El Nino says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19
There could be a big turnaround in South America for grain growing conditions. The models show more rain forecasted. China will be paying attention to this as they are buying increasing amounts of soybeans from Brazil says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Conditions look ripe to produce an El Niño weather pattern. This should result in good moisture for the western U.S. says Art Douglas @cattlefax #CattleCon19 https://t.co/S9OQFLSaPz
Now on stage is Art Douglas to give an outlook on the weather for 2019 @cattlefax #CattleCon19
Obviously one of the key factors was a good weather situation around much of the country in 2018 says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19
We’re in a situation where we could use more hooks says Randy Blach of the current beef packing rail capacity @cattlefax #CattleCon19
As we look back at the past year we had record red meat and poultry production. The concern is if we would be able to continue moving product to consumers, especially with exports says Randy Blach @cattlefax #CattleCon19

The markets have corrected back from the all-time highs we saw in 2014-15. With the demand growth there could a soft landing for profitability in the cow-calf sector, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
We think that it will be another profitable year for stocker producers. The market is going to give us an opportunity to contract and hedge, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
If we didn’t trade or export in 2018 you are talking about needing to consume 40 lb. more of protein, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
We think we are going to have more volatility. We have some challenges and trade is one, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
I would tell you that we will be a more risk managed business. The amount of money that it takes in our businesses is absolutely staggering, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
We have a higher percentage of cattle hedged than we have most years. We don't expect the basis to be as strong as it was last year but it will still be positive, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
We have to see these meat export markets grow. Production levels for all meat is up. We will produce the most beef ever in 2018, says Randy Blach @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
2018 Cattle Price Forecast	Fed Cattle: $115/cwt ($100-130)	750 lb. Feeder Steer: $145/cwt ($135-160)	550 lb. Steer Calf: $158/cwt ($135-180)	Utility Cow: $60/cwt ($50-70)		@cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Exports account for 20% of fed cattle value at $343 in 2018 @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
From a long-term perspective beef demand looks to be very robust. Retail prices will likely only drop 1%, says Kevin Good @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Beef production is slated to rise 5% to 1.3 billion pounds @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Total slaughter looks to rise 3.7% to 33.5 million head while carcass weights are expected to rise 10 lb. on average. Expect more beef production in 2018 @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Cattle feeders are losing leverage with profitability share from beef cutout expected to reach 52.3%, down from a high seen in 2018 of 58.4% @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Right now the corn yield looks to be right on the trend line of 172 bushels because of weather outlook and current moisture, says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Corn acreage looks to rise 800,000 acres to 91 million #beefmeet #CattleCon18
We continue to be a smaller player within the world for corn production, says Mike Murphy @cattlefax 		In 1980 the U.S. was producing 47% of the world’s corn. Now it is about 35% #beefmeet #CattleCon18

Interest rates will likely increase ¾ points in 2018 and potentially could go up a full point, says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
Unemployment rates look like they should stay low through 2018. Historically we are not where we would like to be for Gross Domestic Product, but it is promising, says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
We see tax reform as being positive for both corporations and individuals. All for that coming together it starts to build on the outlook for 2018, says Mike Murphy @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
The summer forecast looks good for crop growers in the Corn Belt. Drought conditions could continue for producers in the West and Texas #beefmeet #cattlecon18
February looks like it could be cool in the Plains states and Upper Midwest. Southeast and Southeast temperatures will be warmer. Precipitation will be short in the Southwest and there could be a more moisture in the Northeast @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
The vegetation index in the Southwest is showing a lot of red and brown. We have to watch this drought as it heads into the spring, says Art Douglas @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
There is one thing that hasn't changed over the past 50 years and that is the concern over weather for beef producers says Topper Thorpe @cattlefax #beefmeet #CattleCon18
