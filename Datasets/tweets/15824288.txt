The U.S. Army, deployed in wartime, is not an imperial play toy or extended palace guard of any temporary President. It is the Army of the People of this Republic, and Congress has a job and a duty to perform ‚Äî especially when American soldiers are dying in a war zone.
Trump‚Äôs canceling of the Speaker‚Äôs Congressional delegation trip to talk with our military leaders on the ground in Afghanistan was worse than just retaliatory, smash-mouth old New York-style politics. It was an authoritarian move.

Child abuse is not an American Value; nor should it ever be a border weapon. Shame on you, Gen. Kelly. Your Irish-American fore-fathers are rolling over in their graves.
General Kelly‚Äôs immigrant ancestors didn‚Äôt have their kids treated like this when they fled Irish famine, death, and genocide to come to the United States.
Trump = zero tolerance for American Values, and zero-tolerance for Judeo-Christian Values, or Human Rights. Stop using our government to abuse refugee kids.
Try this one Jeff Sessions ‚Äî ‚Äúwhoever welcomes one of these little ones, welcomes me....‚Äù Matthew 18:6.  Child abuse is not an American value. #Jesuslives

Every place of worship in U.S. should post a sign near their entrance this weekend that reads: 'Immigrants Welcome'
When @realDonaldTrump is done playing Emperor &amp; hate-monger, maybe he and his Republican Congress can pass Immigration Reform #NoBanNoWall
Cities and states are right not to allow their local police officers to be turned in immigrant round-up drag nets
The notion that cities and states are giving 'sanctuary' to dangerous immigrant criminals is factually untrue
If immigrants are afraid to call the police for anything, then crime will rise, not fall. Procedures exist to remove truly violent criminals
Just because many of our immigrant neighbors can't yet get through our broken immigration system doesn't make them a threat to public safety
New White House executive order of the day would punish churches &amp; places of worship that minister to immigrants. Very decidedly UN-American
The America we love does not build walls, ban refugees, or profile immigrants based on religion
