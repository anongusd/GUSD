@BubbleB It looks great!
@designandestroy Let me know how it feels after 4 weeks. =)
@designandestroy Next time, up the temps a bit (115-120F) and stick blend a bit more. That should help it emulsify and make it firmer!
@designandestroy If it's 9-10 pH, it's fine to use. Cure for 4-6 weeks and see what happens.
@designandestroy Wipe off the oil and pH test the soap (https://t.co/sRsqGIhmeN)
