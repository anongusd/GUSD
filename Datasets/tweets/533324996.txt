$1 trillion+ in student debt is crushing young Americans. This crisis is holding back an entire generation from participating in the economy, buying homes, getting married, and achieving the American Dream. We have an obligation to fix this ASAP.		https://t.co/UpB5kU5kcQ‚Äù
So despite historic success by my #FabFour sisters, we have a lot of work to do to create parity in PA politics to ensure women of all stripes are represented by their local, state, and federal elected officials.
Important note by @PennCapitalStar in this piece: "....Women hold only a 1/4 of the state‚Äôs legislative seats &amp; no statewide offices. PA has never elected a woman to the U.S. Senate &amp; women of color &amp; R women are especially underrepresented."
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all very different, but we do share the idea that we will go farther and succeed legislatively even better as we help one another" - @mad4pa on working together now that we are off the campaign trail &amp; in the halls of Congress. Couldn't agree more. 	https://t.co/W8u6vMDaM6
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anybody with political aspiration or in politics should have anything do with how those maps are drawn" - last night at the @Muhlenberg Town Hall on redistricting. Voters should be picking their politicians - not the other way around.		https://t.co/ISRvIOEbvs
"You have to work to represent everybody as much as possible... A lot of people think compromise is a dirty word and I don‚Äôt believe it to be. We are not clones of one another." - talking w/ @LVB_com on why I love representing a purple district like #PA07		https://t.co/S1UbtU87VQ
I don't take corporate PAC money because I want the people of #PA07 to know that I am on their side - that I can't be swayed by big donations from corporations looking out for their profit margins. I am answering only to people looking out for the well-being of their families.
I ran on a promise to get the government back to work #ForthePeople. #HR1 is sweeping government reform that will do just that by fighting the culture of corruption, expanding access to the ballot box, and reducing the influence of dark money. 		https://t.co/qdEi4sVzUs
Improving the lives of working families starts with creating an economy that works for everyone - not just those at the top. That means raising the minimum wage, closing the #paygap, and protecting our unions. 		To #PA07, I promise I‚Äôm working on all of the above.
We are long - looong - overdue for raising the minimum wage. America's workers deserve a raise and gradually increasing the minimum wage is an important first step to tackling income inequality. #RaisetheWage https://t.co/Xde1PR4IOT

Our soldiers deserve to be honored today and every day with quality and accessible care for veterans. We must ensure high-quality medical care, educational services and transitional services for the men and women who serve and for our military families.

We must confront and condemn anti-semitism and hate. Attacks on our Jewish community, in our synagogues and churches, are attacks on all of us. As a nation, we must stand up against senseless violence, we must stand for common-sense reforms that will make this madness stop.
My thoughts are with the families and victims at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill today. Our houses of worship should be sacred places in our community.  To see a time of celebration, prayer and reflection interrupted by a senseless act of violence is heartbreaking.

I implore Senators on both sides of the aisle to support this investigation and ensure proper time is allowed for it to be completed before taking any further action on Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs nomination.
I am glad to see that there now appears to be bipartisan support for conducting an FBI investigation into these allegations.
This is not how business in Washington should be conducted‚Äîit isn‚Äôt worthy of the institution of the Senate, and it does not meet the high standard of decency and deliberation demanded by the American people.
Republicans in the Senate seemed determined to rush through a lifetime appointment to the highest court, with no regard for the extraordinary testimony of Dr. Ford and with too many questions still left unanswered.
We must believe the testimony of women who have experienced sexual assault, we must stand up and declare that such behavior is intolerable.
Watching the vulnerable and grueling testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford yesterday was extremely difficult, I know not only for myself but for women across this country.
