@realDonaldTrump Should consider offering Julian Assange immunity, protection and citizenship in the United States in exchange for all of his intelligence.
@realDonaldTrump The Mueller investigation is a disgrace, and the world is watching.  Why has a Special Prosecutor not been appointed to investigate HRC, emails and Clinton Foundation?  You should release Fisa documents and show the world what the investigation was based on.

@RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump Quite frankly, anyone who is convicted of a crime resulting from the Mueller investigation SHOULD BE PARDONED, as the whole investigation is based on a foundation of lies.  FISA Warrants could never have been obtained had applicants been honest with court.
@RepJerryNadler @realDonaldTrump Save it, Nadler.  President Trump has said nothing about issuing a pardon to Paul Manafort.  That being said, he can pardon anybody he pleases, and there would be nothing you, or anyone else, could do about it.  Futhermore, Manafort never met with Julian Assange/Wikileaks.

@SnowPrincess930 @RandPaul It is not the place of USA to 'punish' Saudi Arabia for Jamal Khashoggi, who was not a citizen of our country.  He was an enemy of state to SA, and none of our business.  SA and Turkey are both guilty of gross humanitarian abuse.  Even still.. none of our business.
@SnowPrincess930 @RandPaul This is something we can agree on.  I wish the United States could withdraw from Middle East!  I have no love for Saudi Arabia or Iran.
