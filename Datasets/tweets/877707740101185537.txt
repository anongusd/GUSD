@TheImprovisor The Hiding Place by Corrie ten Boon.
@RJ_roro I suffered deeply as a youth because of my fear of public speaking. Now I want to help others who are suffering the way out.
From my upcoming ebook: How you resolve things, how you assess what happens to you, how you take care of what needs to be done—all these things delineate and predict how you will handle the public-speaking challenge. The mind confronts different situations similarly.

@jeanmaregag This year none because I am frantically trying to finish my own book and Vance is taking priority over all leisure time.But last year about 30. I feel reading is very important for a writer.
