@drmaltby I agree, which is why it's bad to report on it as "Trump directs" per the quote I tweeted.
@ItIsAllPolitics Nah, you are allowed to decide whether his intentions are more important than the outcomes ‚Äî which is why I prefaced it with an IMHO! What's most important to me is that outcomes be explicitly acknowledged and that choice about which is more impt actively made.
@ItIsAllPolitics I'm a reporter. It's not my job to tell you how to feel. And the idea that it is is perhaps the most pernicious misunderstanding out there.
Tweets aren't orders. 	Tweets don't necessarily reflect actual orders. 	How do we know this? Because a prior tweet in this genre has been conclusively shown not to have an order attached to it: https://t.co/jzxNESFKFF https://t.co/63GbmbWr5X

@ddayen Abuse of power is absolutely an intentionalist thing, I was just speaking consequentially.
@likeadog1974 To the extent that statement is true it is based on things we knew about before today, not on an anecdote about a private convo in which Trump yelled about the CEA not filing a lawsuit.
@EricColumbus No, we know he actively tried to get "Cohn to get this lawsuit filed." We don't actually know that he did anything to DOJ or even knew that was the pressure point.
(It's not exactly like there hasn't been speculation about whether the Time Warner antitrust suit was Trump-impelled before we knew about this anecdote.)
To clarify: yes the DOJ sued, but it didn't sue _because Trump ordered Cohn to do it._ 		It is theoretically possible the DOJ sued at Trump's direction but we don't have any more info about that now than we did yesterday, because the order we know about didn't go anywhere.
@EricColumbus Sure, but we don't actually have any more info about that possibility than we did yesterday.
(Of course, Trump added an extra veto point by not knowing enough about the federal government to know that the entity suing to block a merger would be DOJ and not the Council of Economic Advisers.)
IMHO the point of this anecdote is that the order went nowhere: "Don't you fucking dare call the DOJ."		As some of us have been saying since literally 2016, there's more to exec branch than POTUS, and lots of veto points btwn impulse and action. https://t.co/pMhPEcY0Wp
@justinrhorton @dylanmatt @MattZeitlin Dylan's logic is that if you start with universal PD you create a political climate that will lead to better-resourced PDs. I think that's not going to work because the immediate winners out of universal PD aren't PDs but prosecutors.
@justinrhorton @dylanmatt @MattZeitlin I have all the respect in the world for PDs. I am also well aware that PDs are both woefully underresourced and dealing with clients who would often prefer taking the plea to risking a trial penalty. Adding more clients to the PD docket isn't going to change that.

PS, props to @TedHesson and whichever source spoke to him for their prime citation in a future ACLU brief. DHS has been so anxious not to talk about this policy bc of litigation risk, and now a DHS official is saying they "created" a legal standard "out of thin air."
What makes this a big deal is expansion to people who cross between ports of entry and are apprehended by USBP. The US gov can't control how many people come in this way ‚Äî unlike ports of entry. So "remain in MX" is going from 20 ppl/day to a large swath of ppl coming w/o papers.

@emptywheel Does this brief give us any more clues as to what Country A is???
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt LOL yes ok. I knew that the story made that claim and was trying to make sure I wasn't crazy that the legal record was in fact not as clear as the article said.
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt Just to be clear: are you or are you not saying that this passage backs up the Politico claim that both parents "had been granted LPR status" at the time of Hoda's birth?
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt Right it doesn't change the outcome of the case, but I trust @joshgerstein and it's weird to me that both his legal analysis and his claims about what has _been submitted in the suit_ don't match what I'm seeing
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt To wit (sorry for page break) https://t.co/t59sHzZJn7
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt It wasn't! The complaint makes it clear that Muthana's mother was applying as an adult child of a USC (the mother's father).
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt Yeah, it's that next to last sentence that is confusing me because I have not seen those "documents" and my reading of the complaint was that they were NOT yet LPRs at Hoda's birth.
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt These are the relevant passages from the complaint. IMO, they strongly imply that Muthana's mother (and therefore by extension her father) was not yet an LPR as of her birth. @joshgerstein help? https://t.co/X78OglyZUn
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt Sorry, slight correction, Ahmed Ali Muthana's affidavit is silent on his immigration history.
@DavidKubat1 @joshgerstein @soonergrunt What docs are those, btw? I'm not seeing any submitted with the complaint, and the complaint and Ahmed Ali Muthana's affidavit both just say that they eventually got LPR status.

@VMMacchi Yeah, but I honestly also feel that the emphasis on localness and rootedness lets national and Acela-Corridor-located reporters and editors off the hook when they don't bother to learn about issues they'd be forced to encounter at a "local" paper.
PS to an extent this mindset plays into the idea that you cover immigration politics/policy either as a "Washington" story or as a "field"/"real people" story; that dichotomy is bad and anything that encourages it is also bad.
The lived experience you get on the border is most useful if you _know what to look for_ ‚Äî if you know the history and the policy &amp; can see the structure when it peeks up from the ground. Doing both is better than doing just one. But there's no reason, $ or other, to do neither.
Like, there is no excuse for not finding good sources and talking to them no matter where you are. There's no excuse for not reading good local coverage (and lifting it up!). 		And there is no excuse for not learning about the policy and the system ‚Äî wherever you are.
This is good; the LAT series it's about is good; the people responding that you can also hire reporters who already live on the border are also good.		(And I'm not going to deny I feel a certain defensiveness.)		But.	Even w/o doing any of that you can still cover the border well. https://t.co/yhsqo2FsXP

I would love to know more about the decision-making basis from the "pilot" to expanded zero tolerance, given that. But it's also important bc it's a reminder: we knew "zero tolerance" meant widespread separation. The surprise wasn't the separation, it was the eventual outrage.
When they rolled out nationwide zero-tolerance, they talked about the pilot, and claimed it had decreased border crossings by 64%. The publicly-available data showed a 64% _increase_ (&amp; DHS' stats didn't measure what they claimed). https://t.co/RQfEpFySTa https://t.co/GHtd7XUGsT

It's unfair for me to snark without remedy, so this is your occasional reminder that I am always happy to brief members of Congress on how immigration policy actually works, off the record, at no extra charge.
@ReichlinMelnick I mean...he's wrong when it comes to UACs specifically, but I think we can state pretty unequivocally at this point that the volume of individuals under 18y/o coming to the US has been on the rise consistently throughout the Trump admin
@robvato @scallisoncole Your case is (has always been) a q of emphasis: what's said first and most often. I understand this critique and it's fair as far as it goes.

(Answer key:	-the law enforcement force is called US Border Patrol, not the "Office of Border Patrol"	-There is no Office of Border Protection, it's CBP (Customs and Border Protection)	-All of CBP is a law-enforcement agency, not just Border Patrol)
"The office of Border Patrol is the law-enforcement arm of the Office of Border Protection," from Rep. Hank Johnson of GA, might actually be the most completely wrong sentence about the structure of immigration enforcement in the US I've ever heard from a member of Congress.
@scallisoncole It would be valid if it were true, but it's not true in this case. The policy of charging parents with illegal entry in the absence of extenuating circumstances was not something the Obama administration engaged in.

@FergusPeace My understanding of PN, and ccing @DriverWrites for help with this, is that a) about a dozen people a day were taken from facility and allowed to apply for asylum in US b) there was free-r movement in/out of the facility for those who had humanitarian visas issued by MX

@ReichlinMelnick Those statements don't make any claim about _why it's called MPP,_ though.
@ReichlinMelnick Wait do you have a cite on that?
@jenniferdeseo The former, with the asterisk that the US covers its non-refoulement obligations with asylum PLUS withholding of removal PLUS withholding under the Convention Against Torture.
There's also the fact that MPP doesn't apply at most ports of entry along the US/MX border, or to anyone apprehended between ports of entry by Border Patrol officials. So this seems an awful lot like deterrence messaging.
So this tweet says that "Central American citizens who seek asylum in the United States _have to_ wait in Mexico" (emphasis added). In theory, that's not true; in theory, MPP allows asylum-seekers who establish they'd be persecuted _in Mexico_ to stay in US. What gives? https://t.co/vgMYrIj9M8

@TalKopan Yeah, and it's frustrating to see the media adopting that uncritically
Like, it‚Äôs totally fair to criticize the idea that replacement barriers _should_ count as wall, but the fact of the matter is that there is nothing even close to a unified definition of ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs wall‚Äù so fact checking isn‚Äôt really viable.
I might have forgotten this ‚Äî I probably have ‚Äî but did Trump or the administration ever actually say that the only thing that counted as ‚Äúwall‚Äù would be new build where no barriers existed before? Bc otherwise, it seems a little circular to dunk on Trump for ‚Äúlying‚Äù about that.
Some new family separation stats:	-New gov stats identify 245 parent/child separations after June court order, mostly for "law enforcement" purposes.	-New report from @TXCivilRights: separations of siblings, etc. 6x MORE common than parent/child. https://t.co/nCBd0ww65p

@lomikriel @nytimes @AlOtroLado_Org Yeah I just personally am having a lot of feels about having been in TJ instead of PN where it feels like The Story Is Right Now, don‚Äôt mind me
@lomikriel @nytimes @AlOtroLado_Org I frankly think the other part of this conversation has to be that the story about asylum flows is still, to most of the public, the story of the fall 2018 caravan. That is so limited as to be misleading. But it still focuses what stories editors will run.
@lomikriel @nytimes @AlOtroLado_Org Some of us don‚Äôt have the budget to be less convenient places tho :/ and yeah, the infrastructure at TJ vs elsewhere is absolutely part of the story.
@lomikriel @nytimes (That said the Times‚Äô lead about ‚Äúsuccessful deterrence‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really track what I saw and DEFINITELY could have used some context about active dispersal of PN)
@lomikriel @nytimes As someone who recently came back from a reporting trip in Tijuana I can‚Äôt really blame the Times for this, it‚Äôs genuinely hard to figure out how to discuss the two together esp when we can‚Äôt see in at PN, and that doesn‚Äôt seem like a reason NOT to cover TJ

@Sirfoodalot "Constitutionality" isn't a synonym for "legal authority." The ruling was based in whether Obama went beyond bounds of _statutory authority._

Similarly, the authorities Trump is expected to invoke are specific authorities that unlock specific amounts of money. Is use of those authorities appropriate in this case? We'll see what courts say. But it's about those authorities, not some Unified Standard of Executive Power.
Broader args re "if Obama's actions were un/constitutional, Trump's must be too" don't fly. Bc not all authorities are created equal.	The power to grant deferred action to unauthorized imms is a statutorily defined power. Did Obama use _that power_ too broadly? Courts said yes.
IMHO, there are good and bad ways to compare Obama in 2014 (&amp; Trump's reax) to Trump now.	It IS analogous to point to arguments about "using the exec branch bc u can't get Congress to give u what u want." https://t.co/59M7pUDe9z	HOWEVER.
@JudgeNathan @adrianmryan I don't think that's an accurate assessment at all! If there's a mismatch between the specific emergency authorities being invoked and the thing they're being used to do, the judiciary wouldn't even have to look behind the four corners. See this convo: https://t.co/wZYEikmHv7
@lymanstoneky (IOW, if ICE really were maximizing detention of border-crossers now, we would see a different detention pop than the one we currently see‚Äîand we might well see less border backup as a result.)
@lymanstoneky I don‚Äôt think this logic is as solid as you think. There aren‚Äôt more people being apprehended at border than there are beds for; it‚Äôs combination of more arrests and (especially) more discretionary detention of ICE arrestees. Why wouldn‚Äôt more beds just lead to more of that?

@asgvisalaw @MikeDrewWhat I kept wanting to write one when it looked like the US was trying to negotiate it, but the status quo is basically a sentence: "Under current US and international law, asylum seekers from Central America are allowed to apply for asylum either in Mexico or in the US."
@MikeDrewWhat @asgvisalaw This conversation is going nowhere, to be honest, so I'm going to mute it now.
@MikeDrewWhat @asgvisalaw Well, for one thing, again, _some of these kids are themselves Mexican._ But also, IDC if it's a "good outcome" or not; I care that what the US and MX governments say about who has access to asylum, and what US law says, does not match what is happening on the ground.
@MikeDrewWhat @asgvisalaw No. You can't get asylum in the US if you're "firmly resettled" in a third country; having asylum in MX counts as firm resettlement.
@MikeDrewWhat @asgvisalaw a) in some cases these kids are themselves Mexican.	b) In theory neither the US nor MX governments say it is illegal for unaccompanied minors to seek asylum in the US; in practice they are making it impossible. That gap is a problem.
@MikeDrewWhat @asgvisalaw That the only reason these kids are coming into contact with the state is because the MX government is taking an active role in helping the US manage flows of asylum-seekers at ports of entry, which ‚Äî ostensibly ‚Äî is _not_ supposed to keep people from being able to seek asylum?
@MikeDrewWhat @asgvisalaw It's actually that under Mexican law any unaccompanied child who comes into contact with the state has to come into the custody of the state. It's not a migration thing.
@MikeDrewWhat It's a side consequence of the bottleneck at the port of entry. If unaccompanied kids were able to present themselves for asylum at San Ysidro without issue, this wouldn't happen. It happens because they have to wait on "the list", &amp; that's where MX authorities involved.

Time to remind everyone about an important distinction:		Unaccompanied kids: HHS responsibility, often housed by nonprofit contractors, nominally not in detention (tho this is more real some places than others)	Adults/fams: DHS responsibility, forprofit contractors, detention https://t.co/QhD5N8DWir

The detention levels in the new Congressional deal, in two screenshots. (40,520 is a number in both last year's and this year's funding, but it's gone from the _average_ to the projected  _low point._ https://t.co/iQmcGC29JL ) https://t.co/r9jDm00k3B
Of course, if Trump signals that he might not sign the deal, it will probably scare a lot of Republicans out of voting for it. So whether it passes by a "good margin" is in part up to Trump. https://t.co/dp6IGZM51I
@seungminkim @SenFeinstein (link https://t.co/iQmcGC29JL )
@seungminkim @SenFeinstein THAT'S NOT ACCURATE THO. It's comparing the 2018 average daily population to the "goal" of the new bill. Apples to apples comparison is 40,520 ADP in 2018 to 45.274 ADP in this deal.
@DavidKubat1 @immlawACHall Aha yes
@TalKopan I suspect that this isn't actually a difference of perspective on the "refugee" part, ut the "crisis" part. Large flows of _successfully accommodated people_ seem qualitatively different from flows (even slightly smaller ones!) without legal or logistical accommodation.
@TalKopan Refugee as it's used in the sense of "global refugee crisis" tends to be an umbrella term for displacement, so, not much.
@immlawACHall Never mind then!

It's really worth emphasizing that Congress has set down a list of criminal convictions that require someone to be put in immigration detention. In all other cases, it's discretionary. IOW, Congress doesn't think all convictions are equally dangerous. https://t.co/js3yatR4tq
Your explainer on what Congress actually agreed to re detention beds. Short version: it's not really funding ICE for 40,520 beds (2018 $ levels). It's funding ICE for an average of 45,000+ beds between now and 9/30 ‚Äî to encourage ICE to get down to 40,520. https://t.co/iQmcGC29JL

To be clear about this: 40,520 is what ICE is currently _funded_ for, and has been since March ‚Äò18. Problem is that ICE has been overspending and asking for help making the money up. In theory, under a D House they‚Äôll be constrained. https://t.co/HRHjcOXw0b

@TalKopan @Haleaziz @JuliaEAinsley Eh, I don't know that Albance saying 90 percent when the actual number for convicted or charged is 87 percent is that enormous a deal?

@rakishanis Trump's skepticism of immigrants goes way back ‚Äî though in the 80s and early 90s, it was focused on Asian immigrants (especially Japanese).
It's also not in the text as prepared. Which is to say, it's an ad lib along lines of most Trump ad libs ‚Äî superlativizing.

@fancypantsUSA When he says a thing that isn't backing down, and people claim falsely that he's backing down, it's my job to point out that the thing he's asking for is the same thing he asked for before. Because telling the truth, not helping politicians do things, is what journalists do.

What Trump is saying is true! Apprehensions dropped where walls were built, and _shifted to other sectors._ https://t.co/gMJiZJhehn That was also during a period when most people coming were adult men, rather than children, families and asylum-seekers less easily deterred.
I guess I'm going to have to update this post now huh
Trump also brought relatives of people killed by unauthorized immigrants to his 2018 SOTU and his 2017 joint session of Congress. And, of course, this is...not an unfamiliar topic for him the rest of the time. https://t.co/40sEQVqgnc

@lomikriel @DriverWrites @collazoprojects @ImmigrantFam @ColoradoCollege Right this is my concern, that they‚Äôre gonna end up trying to track down every kid released from ORR custody over that time
@lomikriel @DriverWrites @collazoprojects @ImmigrantFam @ColoradoCollege Yes yes yes thank you yes and also the people being like ‚Äúthey can track people down, they have ICE‚Äù are NOT THINKING ABOUT THE DOWNSIDE üò¨üò¨üò¨
@lomikriel @DriverWrites @ImmigrantFam @collazoprojects A reader was in my DMs with some stats from the latest court filing before I even had a chance to read and they weren‚Äôt even a professional and it made me SO HAPPY
@lomikriel @DriverWrites @ImmigrantFam @collazoprojects One part distrust of anything the Trump admin says that doesn‚Äôt confirm priors; one part that a lot of people, I think, never fully dislodged the idea that thousands of kids were separated and then permanently ‚Äúlost‚Äù bc that conflation is how they first heard about it.
@Sirfoodalot @jaketapper I assure you that the press (not to mention the ACLU in its ongoing court case) is going to continue to press for more info on this. Acting like we have info we don't have now is going to _diminish_ that effort.
@Sirfoodalot @jaketapper Honestly, our first job isn't to put pressure on the government but to tell you, the audience, the truth, and taking out "may be" means asserting something that we don't know is true and very well could not be.
@Sirfoodalot @jaketapper Yes, I would absolutely prefer "may still be" to "still separated," because there's a big big big difference there.
@Sirfoodalot The whole point of the HHS OIG report that introduced the "up to thousands" number is that they did not keep track. That's a good reason to say that per HHS OIG it could be as many as thousands. It's a bad reason to take something offered as speculation as if it were fact.
@DriverWrites @ImmigrantFam @collazoprojects (&amp; that's the population this segment and my tweets were referring to)
@DriverWrites @ImmigrantFam @collazoprojects The Ms. L filings also go into admirable detail on the current reunification efforts, but the HHS OIG report threw everything up into the air by putting focus on pre-6/28/2018 releases who might have been separated, &amp; the whole prob there is those can't be tracked w/o more info
Now, would I say most of those separated have likely been reunited? I wouldn't, because I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHETHER THAT'S TRUE. There is so much we still don't know about this group of people. Which is why asserting there are 1000s of still-separated kids out there is BAD.
a) Pls stop citing "1000s" as fact. HHS OIG said could be _up to_ 1000s, &amp; that was quote from provider (possibly speculating).	b) WE HAVE NO REASON TO SAY ALL ARE STILL SEPARATED. Some separated kids could've still been released _to parents_ or reunited after release by sponsor. https://t.co/9sG8pXT33C

@Lollardfish I think the reason you have policies is so editors don't have to make judgment calls like this, for surrrre, but I can kind of see going "welp at least this is a way to print our receipts"
@Lollardfish Best arg for it from ed's perspective:	-It was likely choice btwn anon quote/no quote	-Trump admin often lies about not being called for comment about stories	-Trump himself, in interview W/NYT last week, appeared unaware that WH wasn't just sending reporters to him for comment
@Lollardfish I have a very hot take that this was acceptable behavior by the reporter. I am not sure if the editor should have put their foot down anyway tho.

@cabbageridge @heidiheilig @CarlaShedd Because HHS' job is to place kids with relatives. Period. In May 2018 they started handing info over to DHS and DHS used some to arrest some sponsors and that caused outcry ‚Äî which is another reason asking them to track down families they had pre-May 2018 contact with is risky.
@cabbageridge @heidiheilig @CarlaShedd With all due respect that‚Äôs completely wrong. Many are unauthorized immigrants. They have very good reason not to want to pick up the phone when the government calls.
@CarlaShedd @DavidKubat1 @heidiheilig But that‚Äôs bc separation wasn‚Äôt standardized part of process. Identifying the closest relative living in US and available to sponsor, and placing them with that relative ASAP, always was.
@CarlaShedd @DavidKubat1 @heidiheilig So there are issues with the preexisting HHS system which have frequently been mixed up with concerns about family separation per se.	The current concern is kids were separated without note in files, then placed w/sponsors before gov had to go thru/find/reunite fams after 6/28/18
@heidiheilig @CarlaShedd Use of ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù in the headline here is extremely careless. HHS sponsors ARE PARENTS in nearly half of cases as a rule, and close relatives in roughly as many. We don‚Äôt know how this tracks for separated kids bc we don‚Äôt know a lot, but ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù leaves false implication.

Which is to say, missaying that fake court dates result in detention discourages immigrants from showing up to hearings, which...makes them more vulnerable to detention (and deportation order in absentia). Please be careful when talking about this stuff, getting it right matters.

@Krhawkins5 IIRC the plaintiffs in Grace aren't class-certifiable and aren't affected by this? As for East Bay...I assume lead litigants there will be in the constellation of groups figuring out litigation on this, but as I keep saying, I haven't seen evidence they're racing to file
@Krhawkins5 So they're explicitly not applying the existing regs but not issuing a new reg either? Hm
After a weekend of confusion, official guidance on the Migrant Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") has been formally issued by USCIS: https://t.co/J6ROgawTZf Fair to assume that means the policy is now (this time for real) live. https://t.co/z5hqLtxfuu
Correx: 1988 not 1998, ty @les_ja . Still seems that the survivors with "short" lives per @porszag's teacher in the anecdote would not be captured by the data
@Kevin_F_Maloney Orszag does mention that possibility (whereas he doesn't mention that the survivors in the study had also survived another half-century after) but given that they're only comparing people born in 1911-1945 and who died between 1998-2017, that seems likely to be attenuated.

@Immigration_QA @BeckyM318 For the record, I didn't post an image of the email because I wanted to erase any possibility that my source would be identified from it.
@TomJawetz I can't stop people from making that inference but it would suck for me if the upshot were to make government _less_ inclined to assist reporters in verifying claims!
@ddale8 LOL but see https://t.co/59QBCr0IpM
When public figures make claims, reporters often go to those who would know to ask if those claims are true. That includes relevant gov agencies. As a journalist I really hope that efforts to answer our q's don't get seen as improper politicking.
I want to be clear about something: I didn't make claims about the motivation in asking for this info. There are lots of reasons that USBP could have been asking that weren't "political"--not least, to respond to media inquiries about whether such cases existed. https://t.co/NFBgco27oI

@KayGonzalezcsl Or right! Today they were turning right.
@bayofarizona Yes, that's what the rest of the article in question is about. It does not in fact mean that no such incident has ever been recorded in an intelligence report. That's what "prove a negative" means.
(That said, uh, watch this space over thew weekend maybe.)
@lomikriel I'm being a little unfair here, I actually have something coming on this, but it's a bad look to criticize an outlet for clarifying that "multiple experts haven't heard of this" doesn't mean it never happened.
@KellyScaletta I'd say the fact that readers are capable of drawing those inferences makes it a good thing for them to do instead of reporters!

@WarmGingerTea It was in the context of ‚Äúwe have to release them into the US.‚Äù Which is literally the thing that this new policy is preventing.
Corollary: I really, fervently hope that media outlets will hold themselves to a higher standard than the president holds himself to, and work not just to ‚Äúactually‚Äù the things Trump said today but to educate readers about policy news like this.

@Haleaziz Yeah uh if anyone figures out what the AMLO administration's strategy is on this please let us know @karlazabs
You probably won't hear anything about it from Trump, but his administration is literally on the eve of its biggest asylum crackdown yet. https://t.co/z5hqLtxfuu
@ReichlinMelnick Uhhhh let me get back to you on that one. Damn. (And I got tripped up on this LAST TIME TOO)
@ReichlinMelnick "some form" = RFI
@jarais People who don't express fear of persecution in MX won't get CFIs, right, just NTAs. People who do will get RFIs to determine whether they need to stay in the US. (I tried to make this clear in the piece but it's a bit hard while using lay terms, lmk if I failed)
I HAVE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS https://t.co/z5hqLtxfuu https://t.co/KBiC7bZ0l1
@Haleaziz Furthermore, Mexican officials told Reuters about the Friday start date before anyone at DHS would confirm.
-Advocates tell Vox there's unlikely to be a lawsuit to stop this policy imminently, because they may want to see what it actually looks like on the ground.	-Some details on how it will work are answered; some still aren't. 	https://t.co/z5hqLtxfuu
üö®üö®BORDER NEWS:üö®üö®	-DHS confirms it will start returning legal asylum-seekers to Mexico after initial screening tomorrow. 	-Policy will start at San Ysidro, biggest port along US/MX border (where many have already been waiting to seek asylum). https://t.co/z5hqLtxfuu
"...My situation is nowhere near the worst, but it still hurts. It‚Äôs unconscionable that anyone would shrug and say, 'they'll deal.'" (2/2)
Fed working unpaid: "I‚Äôm a new law grad and new govt employee: I‚Äôve been furloughed for ¬º of my time with the govt. I‚Äôm living with my parents to save money so I can pay my state bar fees, rent, student loans, etc..." (1/2)
Furloughed fed: "As others have said, we swear an oath. Not to any president or administration, but to protect and defend the Constitution. Our loyalty is to our country and our mission. And THAT is why we show up."
"...When I joined the gov, I never expected for a food bank to set up on property to distribute food so we can eat for the week." (2/2)
Excepted fed: "I did not pledge allegiance to Pres. Trump or even to Pres. Obama when I was sworn in, I did it to the constitution, not to a figure head. Our daily briefings have changed from what we can expect for the day, to what kind of assistance is available to us..." (1/2)
Fed toggling between furlough and unpaid work: "So if I don't respect Trump, can I go home?"
Fed working without pay: "Kudlow is an idiot. I show up every day to do what I can to take care of my subordinates, not my superiors."
"Currently paid (for now). Helping my subordinates, who aren‚Äôt so lucky, find ways to pay daily expenses. Once strong support of the President in my office has devolved into angry, confusion, and malice. People are pawning valuables to keep in their rentals."
"FED K9 handler. Working without pay to protect passengers. Not for fidelity to a President. I serve the people and swore an oath to the constitution, not a man. I‚Äôll follow lawful orders but am loyal to my country."
"...The only positive is the most MAGAs watching as everybody turns on the dear leader." (2/2)
"Excepted fed for DEA. We are basically doing next to nothing as we have no money for deals, informants, travel. Lots of sitting around the office picking apart the insanity of a border wall to slow drugs. Morale in the crapper..." (1/2)
Contractor: "I‚Äôve lost $6,600 from lack of work. I‚Äôm a contractor who won‚Äôt get backpay. I am terrified. I am trying to find other work but no one calls back. I can‚Äôt sleep. No one volunteered for this shit."
"...I‚Äôm supposed to retire in April after 20 years‚Äô service, and it breaks my heart to be closing out my career in such a shoddy way. But I‚Äôm doing it for my country, not for this miserable excuse of a president." (2/2)
Recalled fed: "at State, they called everyone back this week, having 'found' enough money to pay us. They‚Äôve promised one two-week paycheck in the middle of February..." (1/2)
"...The messaging out of ppl like Kudlow and Ross is either self-serving spin or dementia." (3/3)
"...Working w/o pay just to keep the job I have isn't "selfless". The job was already in service to my country, for which I am glad/proud. This clusterfk is making it painful/difficult &amp; in some cases dangerous to do our work..." (2/3)
Exempted (unpaid) fed: "I left the military pursue civilian service. Yesterday I had to pay $2k for needed dental work that was put off due to shutdown. Tooth got infected and couldn't wait. Good thing I can't eat much bc I'm down to $800 in the bank to last me til ? ..." (1/3)
"... I am furloughed but if called in to work without pay I would be doing so because it‚Äôs my pleasure to serve the American people. I have no respect for Donald Trump, who is a cheater and liar at work and at home." (3/3)
"... A fellow federal employee came in and asked me whether she could get diapers for her baby without showing a birth certificate, because her baby was so young that she hadn‚Äôt received one yet..." (2/3)
Furloughed fed: "I spent this morning volunteering at the Resource Center Chef Andr√©s set up that was handing out produce and goods like diapers..." (1/3)
"...Most of the forward-thinking, high performers are considering the same. All under age 35. Our office would be decimated if they all left." (2/2)
Exempted (ie unpaid, working) fed: "I'll soon be interviewing for a private sector job w/ better pay and benefits, but doing it in secrecy. Gone are the days when I thought I would spend my entire career with the fed govt after this debacle..." (1/2)
"... I haven‚Äôt been working long enough to even have savings, I am lucky my fianc√© (who is also furloughed) has enough saved. My heart breaks for those that aren‚Äôt as fortunate." (2/2)
"I am a furloughed employee. I just finished school and got my first federal job. I didn‚Äôt do it to serve the president, I did it because it‚Äôs a good steady job where I know I am making a positive difference for the public..." (1/2)
"... I work because I took an oath to defend the Constitution, DEFINITELY not out of loyalty to him. I've become convinced he is incapable of understanding what that means though. Him and all his lackeys carrying water for him on this can rot in hell." (2/2)
"I'm working unpaid but it's definitely not a choice, and it's not like I had a say in the matter, so it's pretty galling to see Trump thank federal employees for being hostages..." (1/2)
"...I don‚Äôt want recognition for my sacrifice, as I am not a veteran. I want pay for my job well done. Don‚Äôt use pity for me to redirect attention from your insensitive and incorrect comments. Boom." (3/3)
"...I am an American so I pledge allegiance to this country and its founding principles, not a President that uses my dedication and dependability for his own personal vanity..." (2/3, sorry)
Unpaid working fed: "I am not volunteering. I am working without pay because my work is critical to the safety of the American people..." (1/2)
"...We all took the same oath of office the President did when we became federal employees. 'Volunteering' my ass." (2/2)
"I'm a fed and have co-workers who had to return their children's Christmas presents for cash to pay their bills. My co-workers spend hours every day on Facebook sharing information about local businesses and food pantries that are offering us support..." (1/2)
"...We come in because we have to, but also because we have integrity. It's quite the irony of being asked to push with integrity and patience when the leader has absolutely no integrity." (2/2)
Unpaid working fed: "Across the board, most of us have lost all faith in this government,  party not factoring in. But there's a level of resentment towards the president and McConnell that will never be repaired..." (1/2)

Mr. President, I have a Twitter thread for you. https://t.co/d4lSRGGQCg
"I'm currently working because we have some funding from other agencies but with each day I worry that they will come and tell us to go home without pay."
"...We could not have more clearly heard the message that the president doesn‚Äôt care about us or our work for the American people." (2/2)
Unpaid fed: "I have zero allegiance to Trump. I do this work because I love being a public servant and the purpose and pride it gives me (or used to give me). There is so much work not being done and this will be a drag on morale and productivity for months if not years..." (1/2)
"... I can't make rent, pay for utilities or maintain health insurance. I am not alone. People I work with will end up homeless. It's torture and Kudlow is just shrugging his shoulders." (2/2)
Unpaid contractor: "I am not outraged but mortified by what appears to be the sheer evil of guys like Kudlow.	I probably won't receive the money I'm owed but if I don't continue to produce, I won't get future work..." (1/2)
"... or indicating special appreciation for our work. (Also I run out of money on Feb. 5)." (2/2)
An unpaid fed DMing from work: "The most frustrating part is that no one in our chain of command (including, and especially political appointees) is disavowing these sort of comments..." (1/2)
"... But making zero &amp; still trying to make student loan payments at nearly 40 years old just isn‚Äôt looking as appealing as it used to." (2/2)
Unpaid (working) fed: "I wanted a career in public service despite my deep law school debt bc I wanted that sense of service &amp; purpose in my work. I already make significantly less than my counterparts in private practice..." (1/2)
(BTW there are some fedvents that I have not tweeted out yet but am including in the piece I have filed about this, so if you're wondering why I haven't tweeted yours out yet that might be why.)
Unpaid fed: "I wish I had something more eloquent to say. Sadly, I can only quote Henry Hill from Goodfellas. 'Fuck you, pay me.'"
Unpaid fed: "As a millennial, Kudlow can swallow his half-hearted praise and take our names out of his mouth. Unless he‚Äôs convincing Trump to put me back to work without making racism a part of the price, he can keep his pandering to himself. I won‚Äôt be part of his narrative."
"... and while I‚Äôm proud to see how hard people are working to keep the public safe, it‚Äôs demoralizing. This is an abomination and it‚Äôs all on Trump and his Administration." (2/2)
Unpaid fed: "Fuck Trump. I have zero allegiance to him. I‚Äôm working to serve the public, as I took an oath to do so when taking this job and to support my fellow co-workers. There are hundreds of us in my agency working unpaid right now..." (1/2)
"I'm essential personnel working on promise of eventual pay. The absurdity of the notion that I am remotely complicit in my non-pay status is surpassed only by the notion that I do it because I respect Donald. I don't. None of us do."
"....Feds are the whipping boys and girls of this administration. Trump, Ross and Kudlow have no idea. Screw them all." (2/2)
Funded fed: " I feel so guilty for even getting paid right now. Even though we are getting paid our proposed pay increases were frozen by Trump and insurance payments increased. Yet Pence and others will get a nice bump in pay when this is all over..." (1/2)
Paid fed: "At this point if I were furloughed my savings would be gone, my kids would be out of their daycare and I'd have to look for another job. After a decade of service. Back pay doesn't fix that."
Funded Fed in unfunded agency: "My unfunded colleagues worldwide put their lives on the line to help Americans in trouble. They don't do it for Trump or any President. Its because they want to make the US as good as it claims to be and an ethic of service."
"...and 2) working for the incompetent fools in the Trump administration makes me want to vomit." (3/3)
"... I've been in the government for ten years now but am starting to think of getting out because one of the main benefits of government service is it's a steady paycheck in the service of my country.  But 1) I'm now not getting paid and my country doesn't seem to care..." (2/3)
"I'm an unpaid fed and went on a business trip this week, unpaid, doing the government's business. Every minute that I work while not getting paid irks me just a little bit more..." (1/3)
"...I‚Äôm still young and have a lot of room for professional growth. (My metrics are among the highest in my office.) Oh, and I don‚Äôt do anything out of allegiance to POTUS. I walk into my office thru a separate entrance so I can avoid looking at his scowling photo." (2/2)
Funded fed: "Plan to resign by Sep. Have been willing to tolerate frustrations of govt bureaucracy bc I love having a mission that serves the public interest rather than serving wealthy clients, but I‚Äôm not putting up with the incompetence of our elected leaders anymore..." (1/2)
I'm behind on fedvents, sorry, turning this into actual content for the website for which I work. Posting 1-2 from the inbox to tide you over.
"I showed up today to make sure funding continued on the life-saving project I manage. I'm working in spite of the president, not because of him."
@TalKopan In fairness a lot of them are either furloughed or overseas where it might not be work hours but üòÇ
Furloughed fed: "I volunteer to stick my foot up Larry Kudlow‚Äôs ass."
"ATC, currently working 6 day weeks for no pay; my only allegiance is to my co-workers, if I don't show up, they're the ones that end up paying for it. We protect each other when the administration won't."
Unpaid fed: "I serve because I love my country. I serve because I swore an oath to the constitution. That this White House is so vain to think my service is about them suggests they don‚Äôt feel the same way about either our country or the constitution."
Furloughed fed stationed overseas:  "I'd like to volunteer to bloody his nose.  I have no choice but to show up or risk being fired.  Too close to retirement to take that risk."
"...I can't speak for others, but I sure as hell am not doing this for our current President." (3/3)
"...Employees are bombarding my boss with news clips about pay and benefits, wanting her to confirm, which she of course can't, because she's as in the dark as the rest of us. We still are showing up to work due to the mission..." (2/3, sorry)
Unpaid fed: "I've worked [here] for 9 years. Never talked about politics or the President in the office until this shutdown. It's historically been taboo. Now it is becoming a bitch fest about POTUS and his stupid wall..." (1/2)
Funded fed: "I'm currently being paid, but I've received three emails from buddies at contractors with links to job postings and general words of encouragement/offers to 'end the uncertainty'."
"...and they act like we should be grateful that (someday) we‚Äôll get the backpay we‚Äôve earned.  I‚Äôve already started to look for a new job." (3/3)
"...This job used to be about public service but if you look around it‚Äôs clear most people just don‚Äôt care about us.  A football player kneels and everyone loses their minds.  Public servants don‚Äôt get paid while being compelled to work..." (2/3)
"I‚Äôm a federal prosecutor.  If we don‚Äôt show up, we‚Äôll be disciplined when this is over (perhaps even fired).  Trump is a world class idiot but what is truly disheartening is the lack of real public support..." (1/3)
"A promise not to strike is on the same page as the oath of office. Working without pay is voluntary in the sense that people sign this form willingly but it‚Äôs‚Ä¶a stretch to call it 'volunteering.' https://t.co/aPIiuy6O4M "
"I'm a contractor, but the feds that I know who are working around-the-clock shifts are doing it because they're devoted to the public's safety. Unlike our illustrious president and his cronies, they are qualified for and devoted to their duties."
A quick note that if you're interested in the workforce-policy angles of the shutdown you could do worse than listen to the episode of #TheWeeds we recorded last week about this https://t.co/Znjq88DnWi
Unpaid fed: "Note to Kudlow:  Plenty of people are also working because OPM just issued a vaguely threatening memo reminding agencies they can discipline unpaid excepted employees who fail to report to work by recording them as AWOL."
"...we stood for the flag. We talked about honor and service. Then we went back to work. Not for Trump. Because we love our country, which I doubt Mr. Kudrow understands or appreciates." (2/2)
Unpaid fed: "This is how kings talk. Sat in on a federal ceremony yesterday. Half the folks weren‚Äôt getting paid. Indeed, some had picked up food from a shelter the day before..." (1/2)
Furloughed-but-excepted fed: "Kudlow‚Äôs remarks appear on target, with a notable exception. The allegiance is to the oath, which is to protect and defend the constitution. That includes the office of the President, but before Article I or Article II is 'We the people.'"
Furloughed fed: "Shit like this is why we moved the potted plant in front of the Trump portrait we're required to hang by the front door of the office."
https://t.co/3GsOv4CNzU
"...Who wants to stay and work for an administration that is so blatantly hostile to you?" (2/2)
"My husband and I are both feds.  (My agency is funded, but he's been working ungodly hours for no pay since this thing started.) We both thought we could spend our whole careers as civil servants, and both of us are now reconsidering... (1/2)
@mr_resnick Because you're replying to me instead of DMing I assume you're ok with my just retweeting this?
@SteelyMammoth Because they can't! We got into this on Friday's episode of The Weeds, which I really recommend if you're interested in this stuff https://t.co/Znjq88DnWi
Unpaid fed: "Kudlow is full of shit. Don‚Äôt know a soul in the Embassy that isn‚Äôt completely embarrassed by Trump and humiliated in having to represent his policies. #FromAShitholeCountry"
@warren__terra I'm planning to just thread them
Furloughed fed: "I'm not working, but it's not volunteering. Volunteering is what Jose Andres and all are doing at the Food Kitchens or Food Bank. What Fed workers who are working with no pay are doing is what I would call SLAVE LABOR."
Feds working unpaid: I will anonymously tweet out any reactions I get to Kudlow's assessment. DMs are open. https://t.co/aOJiAGEvgW
@EsotericCD My problem has been an influx of hashtag-resistance folks who are apparently uninterested in anyone being challenged who's not Trump
@SJinBend That said, that might not be the lesson of these layoffs at all, as it appears that in some of these cases ‚Äî especially BuzzFeed ‚Äî layoffs aren't happening because not enough revenue is coming in, but rather because the company wants to cut costs to boost profits.
@EsotericCD FWIW, I went from 45K to 55K in a day a few weeks ago, and the difference is such that I am seriously considering going from your standard to Nate's.
@SJinBend As an employee at a non-paywalled organization I think it's important to not see those two things as synonymous. Sites that don't sell subscriptions need your support, too. This is why my mantra tends to be "Support journalists; click on their links."

I am going to need to take a harder line on this if I'm going to remain sane on this website.		If I note that a thing has or has not happened, and you respond as if I have said it happening/not happening is good or bad, I am not going to engage and I might mute you.
@_ZD I feel like you're responding to "Dems should have claimed victory" which is not what I said or implied. I noted that it was an option for them they did not take. Being in the majority now is indeed a reason why that might have happened.
@LionelKitchy In 2018, Trump said he was getting money for his wall and Democrats said he was not. Compared to then, Trump is in fact using barriers more often now and wall less. Nothing happened to prevent Ds from drawing the same distinction in 2019 than 2018, it was a choice.
@LionelKitchy the Trump administration
Questions about why Ds would claim a victory over a bollard wall might be answered by reading either my piece or Jane's, both of which explain how prior D messaging would have been consistent with that.
A move that's gone mostly unnoticed during the shutdown but will probably matter a lot down the road:	Admin claims it's "conceded" on the wall by endorsing barriers that are in practice going to be bollards. https://t.co/2JPAh56oFB But instead of claiming victory D's retrenching. https://t.co/umd4K59MNL

The corollary to this is that none of his threats so far have been implemented even a teeny tiny bit. There have been no apparent steps even to turn them into reality. This is just total vaporware.

@David_J_Bier @immlawACHall @ReichlinMelnick @asylumist If the point is that kids with asylum claims have to process them in-country, then kids coming bc their _parents_ have asylum claims would be sensible to exempt.

@David_J_Bier @immlawACHall @ReichlinMelnick @asylumist Reporting
@DerekTigus But when writing about proposals to end it it's important to communicate the calculus that various sides are actually making, which involves the pain of shutdown only insofar as it increases political pressure on them.

@melisthreadgill I just worry because so many people respond to a tweet with a fact as if I am telling them they are not supposed to be angry or sad!
@ReichlinMelnick This is probably at the root of a lot of my discomfort with the continued primacy of the family separation story: the suspicion that had that conflation (the actual fake news of "2000 lost separated kids") not happened, there would never have been a nationwide outrage.
@melisthreadgill You should feel free to be sad about it, it is a thing that happened and will have lasting impact! But of course it's up to you how to direct your emotional energies, and I'm glad if I've helped stop you from being sad about a mistaken impression.
@ReichlinMelnick Furthermore, the 2000 "missing" kids story had _also_ been out for a month when it went viral ‚Äî NYT reported it in late April, it went viral in late May.		The virality was _because of_ the conflation of the two stories.
@ReichlinMelnick But it was widely public!		There had been at that time not only the reports about initial numbers (inc the NYT's 700), but the zero-tolerance announcements from both DHS and DOJ, including the Sessions speech where he said if you don't want to be separated don't come illegally.
@ReichlinMelnick No. It went viral when family separation had been in effect for a few weeks, and it's the reason that people started paying attention to family separation at all.		(I remember it all too vividly because I was in Australia and just baffled that this thing had suddenly blown up.)
@jbouie And not that it's going to deter anyone, but just a note:	I'm a journalist.	My job isn't to tell you how to feel about things.	And noting something that I think people don't know or understand doesn't mean I think it should change how people feel.
@BeckyBTaylor @jbouie https://t.co/SNBpwYDMDa
@RoshanNModi @jbouie I think we can talk about the trauma of what happened while accurately understanding what is happening now. A lot of people (see the rest of my replies) aren't willing to grant the premise that most kids were reunited at all.
@mr_resnick As of December 12, 131 ‚Äî though a) most of those parents had waived reunification; b) a lot of kids were discharged from custody over the holidays.		(Source for the 131: https://t.co/BDs5ZpyvCg )
@jbouie Source for the first clause of that: https://t.co/BDs5ZpyvCg (joint status report filed by ACLU and fed gov)	Source for the second clause of that: https://t.co/TRVIGaA7Hx (see in particular last section)
@Scairp114 @jbouie I mean, if you want to doubt the ACLU, which has stipulated with the government that most kids IDed as separated post-court-order were reunited, be my guest.	As for the second part of that, I recommend reading https://t.co/TRVIGaA7Hx esp the last section
@oandsometimesy @jbouie That's kind of conflating 2 different stories. They've had problems tracking kids after they're released to sponsors (almost always close relatives), but given that those sponsors are often themselves unauthorized immigrants there are good reasons they might not pick up phone.
Every so often I get it into my head that millions of people appear to think that 1000s of kids separated from parents are still languishing in detention centers and, what's worse, decide it's somehow in my power to fill in the whole picture https://t.co/PoPee1JHsg
@jbouie (Obligatory note, not for you but for followers, that most of the children that the government identified as separated were reunited with parents per court order, and it's most likely most of the children released before being IDed as separated were released to close relatives)

@andkenbr I speak Spanish (though it‚Äôs a bit rusty), and I had success learning a tiny bit of Italian with Duolingo two years ago, and frankly both of those are kind of messing me up with French
@pboogaard Not really. I‚Äôm doing a few minutes a day of French in the hopes of retaining enough to be able to order dinner on vacation in June.

@happycycling03 There‚Äôs that, but more broadly, the odds of apprehension at the US/MX border appear by all available evidence to just be a bunch higher than they were pre-recession
@happycycling03 I would bet you that a higher % entered through means already prevented by existing barriers and (crucially) increased staffing than by means prevented by new barriers. If you assume the border is currently at 0 percent security, yeah, probably 1/3 to 1/2 of current unauth
@happycycling03 Like, well over half of current unauthorized pop have been here &gt;10 years. Increasing security based on how they got here 10, 15 years ago is dumb.

@dylanrahe @mattyglesias If the standard for ‚Äúthings Ds can agree to‚Äù is ‚ÄúDonald Trump stops defending the idea of a wall,‚Äù seems like it might be easier just to say ‚ÄúDs will never agree to anything Donald Trump wants, because he wants it.‚Äù
@codytfenwick https://t.co/1hCW5UTrjo
@FaireComments That might be true but that is a gap between how voters see Congress and how Congress sees themselves.
@TheToddSchulte how in the hell did this go from "definitely not taking it up this term" to "decided not to take it up this term" to "decided not to take it up at all"???? World's worst game of procedural telephone
@CarolForden @shearm Yeah, it really sucks when people with massive platforms get things wrong but the only thing I can do in those situations is use my less-massive platform to help as many people as possible get it right instead.
@CarolForden Yes, that tweet from @shearm is wrong and I'm sure that it's encouraging a lot of this misunderstanding.
@FaireComments Honestly I don't think members of Congress think they're frozen. They think they have ideas that the other party is standing in the way of.
@FaireComments Discussion among whom? You can hear nuanced discussions at think tanks here in DC, it doesn't change what Congress says on the floor.
but a) maybe something weird will happen and they'll grant it Tuesday and want to schedule for this term	b) even if not, they are damn near certain to take it up and set it for next term.		What they are definitely not doing is _refusing to hear the case._
Y'all, I am seeing a LOT of people say things like "The Supreme Court is saying they won't rule on DACA."		They have said no such thing. They have said nothing about whether they'll take up the case.		Because they haven't, the assumption is they won't get to it this term.
@FaireComments Lol no. Commissions solve the problem of ‚Äúelites don‚Äôt know what a solution might look like.‚Äù That‚Äôs not the problem we have rn.
@dan_munz @LOLGOP I really just wish I felt reassured that everyone involved _knew and accepted_ that the existing build happened. Because as is it kind of feels to me like the lesson is ‚Äúnothing Trump endorses can ever be accepted by D base,‚Äù which might be true but isn‚Äôt what D base says now
@nayyeroar What do you mean what the $ was for was never defined? They have explained what they would build with the money they are asking for now. https://t.co/XSUur8xDNF
Every so often I realize just how many dumb DC fights could be avoided if everyone had just read my and @taragolshan‚Äôs wallsplainer when we wrote it in 2017 https://t.co/gMJiZJhehn but I guess it‚Äôs not too late to correct that!
@LindaCookinCO Ma‚Äôam, with all due respect I happen to know a great deal about what we‚Äôve learned about efficacy of border enforcement https://t.co/gMJiZJhehn but what you‚Äôre describing is not the position Ds are taking, which is what I‚Äôve been talking about.
@FaireComments That is a coherent position but not consistent with ‚Äúbuilding a wall sends the wrong message about what America is/endorses racism‚Äù which is now the prevalent attitude of D base
@dan_munz @LOLGOP I think in hindsight it‚Äôs easy to see family separation as peak unacceptable, but at the time the travel ban, and then DACA rescission, both served similar roles
@dan_munz @LOLGOP Erm evitable
@dan_munz @LOLGOP When would you say this ‚Äúbecame clear,‚Äù and do you think it was somehow editable?
@FaireComments And I won‚Äôt comment on 1 because while it might be true, it is telling that when people point out what barriers have been built without Ds throwing themselves in the road to stop it, the response isn‚Äôt usually ‚Äúoh wow I didn‚Äôt know that! That‚Äôs bad!‚Äù But rather ‚Äúnow is different‚Äù
@FaireComments No, SFA was a Bush proposal wholeheartedly supported by Ds on the merits without demands for a broader deal
@red8jwoe https://t.co/Y7AqsYQfzu
@AlexGodofsky The symbolic argument is usually framed as ‚Äúthe message we are sending to the world,‚Äù or even ‚Äúto the people trying to come.‚Äù It‚Äôs not really fair to say that either group isn‚Äôt aware of existing barriers, and certainly not the latter one.
@LOLGOP But that brings me back to the q of FY17/FY18, and why Senate Ds didn‚Äôt threaten to shut down the government until Rs took out the couple billion dollars in approps bills for Trump to build bollard fencing.
@car1ygoodman I feel like one could argue that all three of the D 2016 candidates substantially went there but didn‚Äôt use that word
@nchaseteeples I‚Äôm not 100 percent sure about this tbh, but it seems like there‚Äôs been a move to the left over the last month on this
@racquets100 So it‚Äôs okay that they have allowed Trump to build some wall as long as they don‚Äôt acknowledge that? Because it sounds like that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre saying.
I think that this de facto is the position of much of the party‚Äôs base, and what confuses me is that it isn‚Äôt being more explicitly fought within the party, and everyone is just pretending that new barriers are bad symbols but existing barriers don‚Äôt matter https://t.co/Ap8joc5FvD
@nchaseteeples Schumer getting dragged by the left for his $1.3B offer and Pelosi saying her offer was $0, and she could be persuaded to give $1?
@mattyglesias To the contrary, it seems like as Trump has finally picked up on the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not necessarily a wall‚Äù thing, Dems have moved away from it
@asking_honestly It‚Äôs more that they just are not acknowledging what they did in FY17-18 because it conflicts with their current position
@racquets100 This isn‚Äôt the argument Ds are making. They aren‚Äôt saying ‚Äúwe allowed some things to happen when we were in the minority that we now will not tolerate.‚Äù They‚Äôre saying now the same thing they said then: ‚ÄúTrump cannot be allowed to build his wall.‚Äù
(And regardless of why the shift happened, ‚Äúnot $1 for the wall‚Äù puts Ds in the rhetorically-odd position of insisting that any bollard fencing in FY19 is ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs wall‚Äù but the bollards they allowed built in FY17-18 weren‚Äôt. Unless they start saying ‚Äúnot $1 MORE for wall.‚Äù)
Maybe that‚Äôs an argument about Ds moving to the left as a party, or about the electeds misunderstanding the mood of the base, or something else. But it simply isn‚Äôt the case that Ds saw the $ in FY18 as wall and just couldn‚Äôt fight it. They could, but they didn‚Äôt.
Fwiw, I suspect that the accurate way to describe what‚Äôs happened re ‚Äúwall‚Äù and Dems is that in 2017-18 Ds were easily satisfied with the lulzy explanation of ‚Äútechnically it‚Äôs not a wall it‚Äôs the same barriers we already build‚Äù and now some do not appear to be.
@EricColumbus I think in FY17 there might have been nothing new (or maybe the only new thing was levee) but in FY18 there was some new build allowed. The talking point at the time was that bc it was bollards it was a) not ‚ÄúTrump‚Äôs‚Äù bc an existing type of barrier and b) not ‚Äúwall.‚Äù
@pablo_honey1 @EricColumbus But the ask for the $5.7B would also be for those types of barriers.
@DearSplenda It‚Äôs there inconsistently with no attempt to reconcile it. Eg that line Trump loves to repeat about mothers giving their daughters birth control before sending them off on the journey bc they expect them to be raped.
@DearSplenda Right, in my experience generally the prohibitionist move on migration is to _conflate_ the two and characterize all unauthorized migration as trafficking when that's not true at all.
I think there's an answer to this that is "D voters will forgive Ds things in the minority that are unacceptable with control of one chamber," but that's a statement about what is politically forgivable, not morally correct.)
@DearSplenda If they're doing it by choice and uncoerced throughout the journey it's smuggling but not trafficking
@Bouje99 But they had 40+ votes in the Senate, and if "no $1 for anything Trump can call a wall" was really the bright line, they could have shut down gov over it like they did on DACA.
@DearSplenda ("Empirically, over the course of the journey, a lot of them are at some time victims of trafficking" seems legit but definitionally not all smugglees are trafficking victims)
@DearSplenda ? how are they definitionally victims of trafficking?
@dandrezner But, like, there's a BIG difference between "Democrats brought this up in a meeting" and "these are things that Democrats have said would be sufficient to match the demands on our side"
@dandrezner Last week Pence spun some of the smaller stuff now carried over from the OMB letter ‚Äî $800M humanitarian*, $ for drug screening, in-country asylum for CentAmer minors ‚Äî as ideas that came from Ds 	*this appears to have been spin, DHS was pushing for it 	https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
@romano__dan But again, if the problem with giving "wall" money is that any money you give is an endorsement of Trump's stance, being "morally right" now is too late.
@kudzuplanet https://t.co/vNlUeYvOLH
@romano__dan But they had enough votes in the Senate to filibuster, and even shut down the government in early 2018 that way.
@kudzuplanet He's been more and more consistent about not always calling it a wall himself and being clear that he doesn't care whether Ds call it one.
The fact that CIS is on board with Trump's proposal and Heritage is not says a lot about how Heritage's identity has shifted over the last decade https://t.co/pDRwGkdvWa
Here's the thing tho: why haven't Ds _already lost_ this fight by giving funding to Trump for border fencing in FY17 and FY18?? You can claim "FY18 money was for fence not wall!" but you can say the same for what he's asking for now--he can still call any of it a wall. https://t.co/Yofe52CtgU
@ThankBernanke Operators' preference has always been for "bollards"‚Äîsteel poles ("slats") driven into ground with enough space for agents to see through them ("see-through wall"). Trump's been saying a version of this since early 2017. https://t.co/WYvHTruU7F
I admit to being baffled that "concrete wall," something border agents don't want, is a hill that immigration hawks are willing to die on https://t.co/uM79Od8a6A
@nerdybynature_ So these issues were all sort of mooted when the courts put Trump's plan on hold, because anyone who had trouble renewing by the old deadline was able to apply once DHS started accepting renewals again in Feb 2018.
If SCOTUS grants cert this term for oral argument early next term, they could issue a decision before June 2020, but that's definitely not something the WH can count on. They know that; it's why they're dealing. Dems know that; it's why they're not. https://t.co/NlfGEF605j https://t.co/ve6S1cWIYE
@jonathanvswan @leedsgarcia @ImmCivilRights Okay I take it all back y'all should tell your sources to keep me on speed dial, that's the only way we're going to prevent this sort of thing in future
@leedsgarcia @ImmCivilRights @jonathanvswan Eh fair, revised
@leedsgarcia Today's reporting has been pretty good! Huge props to @jonathanvswan for being specific in his first piece about the proposal being BRIDGE + extensions for TPS, thus preventing a lot of confusion.
You: "Dara, how can you say you're being a good person for literally just doing your job?"	Me: (makes some joke about Congress)		This one goes out to the folks working unpaid today due to shutdown
Because I'm a good person I updated our explainer about this deal to include all the stuff Trump just proposed, even the stuff I also explained the last time he proposed it. https://t.co/NlfGEF605j
@loununez57 @sahilkapur It's not a hard and fast deadline, just typical practice. If they want to announce next week they're hearing the case this term, they can. And yes, when they decide they're not hearing a case at all they _do_ announce that.
FWIW, this is the use of "amnesty" to refer to a plan that doesn't give official (much less permanent) legal status to anyone who doesn't already have it. https://t.co/PPmZLChls7
So it's this stuff ^ plus legislative extension of existing DACA and TPS protections https://t.co/NlfGEF605j
@ReichlinMelnick For real, the admin is insisting on in-country asylum processing instead of refugee processing if they restart CAM https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
For the wonks out there: yes this is a proposal to start CAM kind of, but with asylum not refugees, and it's only on the table with TVPRA changes https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
The stuff Trump is talking about right now is pretty much verbatim the stuff offered in the last version of a proposal, sent as a letter 2 weeks ago https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
"By including the priorities of rank-and-file Democrats in this plan," Trump says while introducing a plan on which rank-and-file Democrats were not consulted and which is way to the right of the party's consensus on the issue https://t.co/NlfGEF605j
@carolinehouck Sometimes I try to write that many words and it ends up 4000
@dcbigjohn Look I am not a reliable human being in pretty much any respect but you can always count on me for this
It's particularly odd for Trump to be giving the danger-of-the-journey spiel for a wall/DACA+TPS deal, which wouldn't address asylum-seekers at all.		Of course, we don't know if the Trump admin is also insisting on asylum changes in this deal.
@AlexParkerDC Interesting take but it seems less than brilliant to use that mechanism to secure adherence to a proposal _you haven't actually negotiated with Ds and are using to bring Ds back to the table_???
Hard to imagine they didn't understand that the Anns Coulter of the world would not be on board with this. The question has always been whether those folks can successfully turn the base against Trump; it's an open question, but one the WH has not yet been willing to test. https://t.co/KTXieYFqx6
Funnily enough, if you go to https://t.co/ZM0Eh0THaO right now you see a big splash for "Congress Must Pass a Bill That Ends This Crisis and Finally Secures Our Border."		It's a link to the primetime speech from last week.
@carolinehouck in our defense we didn't _try_ to write a 2500-word explainer
I think it's really important to understand this as the WH realizing that it can't count on a SCOTUS DACA decision as a pressure point for Ds anymore.		Problem for them: Ds are realizing the exact same thing.		https://t.co/NlfGEF605j
In which @liszhou and I (first time for that cobyline!) explain the deal Trump is about to propose and why it is DOA before he proposes it. https://t.co/NlfGEF605j
@loununez57 @sahilkapur That's not really true, as I've been tweeting: https://t.co/JOlyobbbaS
@TomJoaquin He didn't reach any deal, the thing he's about to propose was designed by WH and some Rs in Congress with no D input (which is why Ds are currently all over the record pre-rejecting it)
@BPC_TBrown I don't think we have details on that?
Also worth noting that a) as far as Ds are concerned, the plan he's about to propose is DOA because it _doesn't_ give anyone access to citizenship b) in past go-rounds, as @sahilkapur has noted, WH is unwilling to allow DACA recipients to get cit unless other legal imm is slashed
Naturalization ceremonies are generally tremendously anodyne things politically ‚Äî because both parties love the idea of people becoming citizens.		The idea that this could be seen as a political gesture is an indication of how unusual Trump's general imm skepticism is. https://t.co/WuND68ACYR
@davidagordon9 https://t.co/DqlF6hzpM2
@warren__terra @frogmanjack @jplesniewski ?
At this point, with so much on-the-record opposition before Trump even formally makes a proposal, hard to see what bully-pulpit benefit a "major announcement" even gets.		(Of course logical conclusion of that analysis is Trump might as well give another IACATBTKY speech).

The other thing I'm interested in, though I don't expect Trump to address it, is whether there's anything in this offer along lines of the $800M the WH asked for earlier this month to deal with the _actual_ humanitarian crisis of kids/families at border https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
It's going to be interesting to see how Trump characterizes the DACA/TPS extension offer in his remarks. So far, he and other WH messengers haven't always been on the same page about what's a concession and what's something they actually want.
@ElieNYC @amyep9 I agree, but "decided not to" isn't a safer bet, it's a sure bet.
@foswi I would love to hear so much more about this tbh. Spill me all your tea
@derkie313 Generally true but every so often there's stuff like this that bears a resemblance to something operators actually talk about (and is a little too far in the weeds for Fox).
Sometimes I wonder how it feels to be the person who briefs Trump on these things and sees articles like this a few days later.
I have actually seen a CBP drug-dog demo and I can tell you with confidence that this is not how it works.

@amyep9 @ElieNYC I can't think of one but a) "decided not to" strongly implies an action that was not taken and b) it is possible there are considerations we're not aware of re Ginsburg that made it appealing to wait over the weekend before official grant
@ElieNYC @amyep9 They didn‚Äôt decide not to, which implies denial of cert, they just didn‚Äôt take action on it yet? If they announce Tuesday they‚Äôre taking it and they want to squeeze it in this term they probably could
This is not necessarily true. The Supreme Court has not ruled either way on whether it will take up this DACA case. That means that it is more likely than not they won‚Äôt fit it on the calendar for this term. But they still could. &amp; didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdecide not‚Äù to take it. https://t.co/ByaTUyan8k

Here‚Äôs what I wrote about BRIDGE back in 2017: the most conservative proposal on the table for DREAMers; a longer version of Trump‚Äôs 6-month deadline to Congress on DACA (lol remember that); less support from GOP than more moderate bill RAC. https://t.co/sKTovlo1WH
@PeterHLemieux Ehhh I think it‚Äôs a little too soon to say that, but I def think them not acting Friday makes it a bunch less likely https://t.co/265h1rjswc
@jbarro Indeed, see @MarkSKrikorian‚Äôs tweeting about this!
@JeffJMason @ReichlinMelnick Long shot seems like an understatement, that would be moving Trump across a line he has CONSISTENTLY seen as too far
Rn, efforts to strip protections from DACA recipients/legal status from TPS holders are both held up in court.		Trump‚Äôs been talking big about how SCOTUS will rule on DACA but they may not take it up this term.		So temp extension is status quo for now. &amp; both sides know that.
The question is WHAT is being proposed on DACA and TPS.		If per @jonathanvswan‚Äôs reporting it‚Äôs BRIDGE ‚Äî a 3-year extension of existing protections‚Äîthat‚Äôs something Ds have never been super-enthusiastic about bc it _doesn‚Äôt resolve the issue_ or provide access to citizenship. https://t.co/JkFNMEizeG

@MikeSacksEsq You also have to wonder if the overt statements from Trump and Republicans that DACA was off the table legislatively bc they were anticipating a good court ruling made Roberts nervous/annoyed.
@kausmickey IDK about quick. Given everyone's propensity for tea-leaf reading from oral arguments, likely that both sides would come out of that argument feeling the political landscape had shifted.		I agree with the CW that not taking it today makes it less likely it will be up this term.

@Krhawkins5 Something similar at DOJ: contingency plan guidance pretty strict on civil case shutdown, but SDTX is steamrolling on with eminent domain cases https://t.co/qwE2oV7Ykc
@Krhawkins5 Yeah I think what makes it tricky is that the people who drafted contingency plans (DHS/DOJ) appear to have been operating on v strict legal interpretation of what was/n't essential, but there's plenty of discretion elsewhere in the institution that is making questionable choices
@Krhawkins5 I'm not sure how much choice ICE had in the matter (website updates are incredibly offline across the shut down depts) but it is truly wild that the field agents in this case are burning detention money they don't have to detain a pregnant lady with health issues
@Krhawkins5 Detainee locator is offline yeah
@BorderReporter @CBPArizona Considering means of entry as a negative factor in asylum cases was one of the regulatory changes being mulled by DOJ this summer, which they haven't (yet) acted on. At best we'd be talking informal discretion.

@TalKopan @Haleaziz There absolutely is a respect in which this is being used to indicate that we don't know everyone crossing the border bc even tho official stats say no Moooooslims, these people are clearly sneaking in so how can we know how many there are. A complex of bigotries!
@CharlesFLehman I find it fascinating that this isn't a prior that's been updated in 13 years, though. Either mat findings are so rare that it's unusual to encounter them more than once in a lifetime, or the assumption has persisted uncorrected for over a decade.
@wickedzeus75 @Haleaziz No, but it's a wrinkle.
@TalKopan Yeah as I told @Haleaziz this is slightly complicated by fact that they're being invoked as evidence of illegal activity, but you're right more broadly and I'm now imagining a rosaries panic.		Also, this is taking me back to the days when OTMs were an anomaly.
@Haleaziz I am ambivalent about this angle because the prayer rugs are here serving as evidence of illegal trespassing
(I think that it is almost certainly true that some ranchers genuinely believe that prayer rugs are recently/routinely found near them, and I find that dynamic telling, as rumors of ICE checkpoints are telling.)
Politifact did an incredibly thorough job on the prayer-rugs claim back in 2014...	...at which point it was already a 9-year-old trope...	...and the only photo they found was from a 2014 Breitbart story subsequently updated to clarify "conflicting reports" https://t.co/7HxoQ7cnXO

@JulyWolfe 170 from July-November, out of 14,260 kids placed with sponsors over that time. (The MOA sending would-be sponsors' fingerprints to ICE went into effect in June.)
This is a widespread perception  re family separations‚Äîthat separated children were held by gov indefinitely or sent to strangers.

@depthgrammar @Haleaziz Churches weren't much the target of enforcement actions, but schools sometimes were.

@atlemar Most reporting on this is bad (read my piece instead! https://t.co/TRVIGaA7Hx) but this morning's report isn't so much about lies as the consequences of carelessness. And there was never a policy on the books against separating families, as there is with church enforcement.
The point of the new HHS report about family separation is this: we will never know the true scope of the crisis, because we will never know how many "unaccompanied" kids had in fact been disaccompanied. https://t.co/TRVIGaA7Hx
@atlemar That's...not really true? Some history of field offices/agents doing things that officials say verbally aren't policy, and a LOT of history of pushing envelope, but generally when they are rescinding a policy they say so. There may not be a presser but the site text gets changed.

The single hardest thing to do as an immigration reporter right now is to _reflect_ fears of the people you're reporting on without _fanning_ them‚Äîby, eg, hinting the Trump administration is planning to do something when we don't actually have evidence to suggest that. https://t.co/76nAyVj24E
@Haleaziz Yeah, I get your bigger point that this is fearmongery...
@Haleaziz Well, not "create policy" but rescind the memo as they've rescinded every other memo on enforcement practices under Obama. (Not that we have any indication that's on the table, just that it'd be simpler than "creating" new policy.)
@ReichlinMelnick @amnestyusa Amnesty's numbers were based on the Reuters stats for 2017-early 2018, plus their analysis of April 19 2018-September 2018. I've been really wary of throwing the 8K number around because it is simply too apples-to-oranges to compare FAMUs to separated kids.
@DavidKubat1 I have a bunch of details on this in my forthcoming piece
(And of course, as @TalKopan has noted, even kids who _were_ in HHS custody and were supposed to be included in the court order kept turning up this fall. https://t.co/hEerbgKVnW )
@ReichlinMelnick @amnestyusa IDK how you're saying "close to ORR's numbers" when ORR isn't providing any estimates of what "thousands" means?
(Can't be handing out links here without crediting @lomikriel, who found out about the zero-tolerance "pilot" and the separations that resulted back in November 2017. https://t.co/EBHUEa5wjS )
Reuters reported 1,800 fams separated from 10/2016-2/2018. https://t.co/DIa8XwALYR NYT reported 700 from 10/2017 to 4/20/2018. https://t.co/1nJgaO9lj8 If those kids were released before June 26, 2018 ‚Äî &amp; most probs were ‚Äî they're in population this new report is about.
BTW: I'm not saying "1000s more than previously reported" bc we don't actually know how this fits into prev reports. It's more than the official government tally in the lawsuit. But reporters have been digging into scope/history of family separation prior to Apr '18.
@temacube That's...not true.
More from me TK, with context, I promise.
HHS OIG says "thousands" of kids who'd been separated from parents were released from gov custody before family-reunification order of 6/2018.		In general, most kids released from HHS custody are released to parents or close relatives. We don't have specific #s for this group.

@dcbigjohn https://t.co/nNoHDfNC5C ???
@BarryMacDoubleU @RepGonzalez Yeah, but the implications about what he might DO are different. Making stuff up about the border and ignoring POEs means they can proceed as usual; the danger is Trump getting enamored of the idea of shutting down the whole border again, bc he doesn't get importance of POEs.
@BarryMacDoubleU @RepGonzalez The thing about turning left yeah, but has he actually said "I don't even know why we have ports of entry"???

@nbeaudrot @BrendanNyhan Well, the IRS until today was doing substantially less than the TSA under shutdown, and we'll see what kinds of absenteeism rates they get.
And of course if you are a TSA employee or an employee working unpaid elsewhere at DHS, I totally want to know how it's going where you are, DM me or check bio for secure send options
anyway in case you can't tell I continue to be fascinated by the bureaucratic politics of the TSA and would definitely read an actual academic article at this point if not a proper ethnography

@schw_abyss Yes, that is what I meant by "some"
Like, if we're talking a higher pain/disruption threshhold than the one we're already seeing, there are going to be a _lot_ of people working (themselves without pay) assiduously to mitigate that pain because _that is their job_

@SPeitsch @OmniJeff Literally I was just pointing out something that I know as a professional but a lot of people on all sides of this debate appear not to be aware of and mixing up. The insistence on interpreting descriptive stuff as normative on Twitter will be the death of me, I swear.
@noboa Dodd-Frank counting as not big-ticket bc not progressive enough or not big enough?
Literally the only useful point I have to make about the CBS/black journalists thing is that "campaign correspondents" is a subgroup of "political reporters" is a subgroup of "writers who address current affairs."
@johnddavidson @emilyekins @FDRLST This is what happened with Republicans under Obama on immigration, too
@scottshuchart @dtfleisch At the point at which we're talking about people being arrested for EWI in the interior vs. prosecuted for illegal entry at the border, it is interesting that that seems a sufficient distinction to outweigh other factors eg lack of warning for interior arrests, ties to US, etc

@dtfleisch @scottshuchart Can you explain a little more why that distinction seems important to you?
@DinaPomeranz @nickthap @mattyglesias That hasn't been true since December of 2017. Currently, the full roster is Matt, Ezra, Sarah, Jane and me. The default lineups are Matt/Ezra/Sarah on Tuesdays and Matt/Jane/me on Fridays.
@MetalheadEsq @NinaBernstein1 Especially because so much of the continued attention to ORR custody conflates UACs and ‚Äúseparated kids‚Äù (still!)
@MetalheadEsq Yeah, @NinaBernstein1 made a similar point. I think what‚Äôs making it hard for me to think through this is that I genuinely don‚Äôt know, and I‚Äôm not sure y‚Äôall do either, how many of the outraged are actively distinguishing between the phenomena vs simply unaware of the latter
@NinaBernstein1 That‚Äôs a fair point! Though I‚Äôm not sure how many of the people for whom zero tolerance was a signature outrage of the Trump presidency are thinking about it that way.

@hortnon I can't answer this from an engineering standpoint but: the prototype contractors were...not our best people. Prototypes had a lot of basic problems (like buildability on any grade of slope). Fair to say they were simply shoddier than existing builds.

The thing to bear in mind about this is that they're not using the prototype designs for any of the contracts they have handed out, are working on, or (as far as I can tell) for their plans for the mileage they'd build with the $5.7B they're asking for. https://t.co/ZkNhcpggui

In conclusion, if you are a WH official counting on declaration--&gt;injunction--&gt;reopening, you better start leaking fast. My bio contains secure ways to reach me, if you want to get started.
And that was for a policy whose details had been disseminated in advance, giving litigators a head start.		No one could start drafting a complaint against an emergency declaration now because _we don't have any idea what emergency powers Trump might invoke._
It takes time to do this. It takes time for judges to set deadlines. Even "urgent" rulings can take days or weeks.		When Trump enacted the asylum ban, some in admin thought it was going to be stopped before it went into effect. There wasn't even a lawsuit filed until days later.
There's a HUGE problem here, which I'm familiar with from recent Trump imm actions but seems to be metastasizing.		Judges don't automatically review things and declare them unconstitutional.		It takes litigators to actually build a case, file it, &amp; persuade judges it's urgent. https://t.co/6LJjjicxnP

Seeing some folks speculate this is shutdown-related, ie USBP agents might be behaving differently bc they‚Äôre not getting paid. What you have to remember: overwhelmingly, families are _seeking out and turning themselves in to_ USBP. It‚Äôs not like street cops making arrests.
(Also possible, as @NickMiroff notes, that this is simply the result of a holiday-season lull. Almost certainly not a good idea to draw any conclusions until the end of the month.)

@car1ygoodman @voxdotcom This is actually part of a different trope‚Äîthe conflation of people with their governments as a way to turn the language of war into the language of migration policy. This + diversity visa + caravans (countries should be able to stop their people from leaving) + travel ban.
In the process of explaining to colleagues that the US/MX border is called the "southwestern border" because maritime borders are borders too, I said the words	All Borders Matter	and now in addition to wine I would like a hat
@candycat357 @voxdotcom luckily i did that in the second paragraph of the first tweet in the thread https://t.co/56Gz1cKLZR (but also on the website I am actually paid to write for I do not go to the trouble of the acronym, yes)
So I'm writing up the IACATBTKY speech for popular internet website @voxdotcom, a very good site which you should all read assiduously, and wow the language he uses is even more monotonous than I thought.
@hoofflefloof ...why would I have a problem with that
@ajcorchado yes I will also accept your tequila, DM so I can send you my address :D
@IChotiner @jbarro I read this as "mobbed by asylum-seekers"
Okay, someone on here offered to send me a bottle of nice wine if there wasn't an emergency declaration in this. Who was that? I would like the wine please.		I'm not gloating, I just need a drink.
@chuckpedro55 that's literally the phrase I gloss in the paragraph above!
The thing about the IACATBTKY motif is this: he's been hitting it since 2015 relentlessly. It is _the_ thing on which his rhetoric has been in emergency mode for, now, 3.5 years. There wasn't even an attempt to argue that now is the time for crisis. https://t.co/56Gz1cKLZR
RT @BenjySarlin: This turned out to be pretty on point. https://t.co/PaI99bIUSj
And as for the $5.7 billion, Pence said yesterday that was what _the president_ had said he expected. Trump is now, amazingly, claiming that ask ‚Äî which originated with the House of Representatives after Trump asked for $5B ‚Äî came from law enforcement. https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw

@dandrezner Sheer force of charm.
Sure am glad that I encoded a subliminal message in that thread that will make you want to log back in at 620 to read my 3k-word piece on the realities of the border
I think it's less important to judge his rhetoric tonight by whether it's extreme even for him, or what novel lies he invents, than to note that this is who he is and what he does. It's the message he has, as a politician, to offer the American people. That's it.
The point of all of this is that "immigrants are coming across the border to kill you" is Trump's very favorite rhetorical theme. It's the one he comes back to when the chips are down, time and time again. He has found various ways to get attention for saying the same stuff.
November 2, 2018: In the midst of his midterm "The caravan is coming across the border to kill you" closing argument, Trump gets CNN to air 27-minute speech about how immigrants are coming across the border to kill you. https://t.co/YBX75s7m2D
February 2018: Trump caps off a ramble at CPAC about how IACATBTKY with a reprise of campaign favorite "The Snake," a poem Trump says is about immigrants coming into your house to kill you. https://t.co/WHmE1ZTHVi
January 2018: Trump riffs during his State of the Union on the horrors of MS-13, and how tough his administration is being on them, because there isn't enough content in the scripted speech about how IACATBTKY. https://t.co/rAGuv8Hwji
July 2017: in a speech to law enforcement officers on Long Island, Trump explicitly endorses police brutality because IACATBTKY. https://t.co/ItHhigTXco
January 2017: Trump's inauguration speech is so obviously about how IACATBTKY that it's known by shorthand immediately as the "'American carnage'" speech. https://t.co/3ck1L7FsQr
August 31, 2016: Trump delivers major immigration address that is somehow hyped as a softening, but is actually about how America needs a president who knows that IACATBTKY. https://t.co/M7mWNd99fb
July 2016: Donald Trump accepts the Republican nomination for the presidency with a fully scripted speech about how IACATBTKY. https://t.co/6QS4fPmV3H
June 13, 2016: Trump's response to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando is to give a speech about how IACATBTKY. https://t.co/BUEj4Q9g77

I have a lot of words TK between now and the speech but in the meantime, I'd like to point something out: 		Donald Trump's very favorite rhetorical mode is that immigrants are coming across the border to kill you.		Heretofore IACATBTKY.		A thread.
Which would make the 5th day of 8 that Chuck and Nancy have been there. https://t.co/pyPQ5M4UwT
@EnduringBeta Trump was threatening a shutdown over wall money for several previous funding battles, though, including nearly doing it in spring 18.
@swarthmoreburke this litigation is already going to be a nightmare
I do think it's possible that there will be a last-minute revision to the script, or for that matter that the WH drafted a fake script to own the libs. Possible-not-likely and unlikely, respectively.
Multiple people pointing out Trump is bad at sticking to scripts, which is true, but a) if he's really going to keep it to 8 minutes he _can't_ really ad lib and b) the speech ad libs have never been _major policy rollouts._
Obviously this doesn't mean he won't, but I'm sure feeling validated in pointing out that some in the admin were working on the negotiation side https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw https://t.co/4Z92JzB49q

@MikeDrewWhat So they're not saying it's enough, they're saying that it's what they need right now and what they can actually spend in a year. The $25B was going to take several years to disburse.
It's possible to imagine a world in which this actually sets parameters for an ongoing negotiation focused on border/asylum, with only modest policy changes on the table.		But, um, LOL. https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
The demands from the Pence team, sent Sun night, are first effort WH has made to put $ behind  "humanitarian crisis" of women &amp; children coming to border: $800M to improve care. 		It's supposed to be a "consensus" ask. But it's dwarfed by wall noise. https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
So here's the thing:		Even as Trump aides hype "emergency" threat, there is an actual offer/set of demands to Dems on the table.		&amp; they're actually more moderate than previous imm fights. (Low bar.)		The q is whether anyone takes them seriously. https://t.co/mvFYDoY4Jw
@JoThoHalloran It‚Äôs much easier to grok this, I think, if you think about shifts in smuggling models. You don‚Äôt have to believe US policy is a pull factor because it‚Äôs too generous to believe that the 00s plummet in unauthorized labor migration led smuggling networks to build capacity for fams.
@JoThoHalloran I.e. argue that flows were less overwhelmingly single-adult than those estimates show or than officials have said.
@JoThoHalloran 2011 for USBP; 2016 for OFO. Which of course means we don‚Äôt have monthly stats for pre-recession, much higher-apprehension era. But there are informed estimates from 2000-era that 90+% of apps were single adults. &amp; I haven‚Äôt seen anyone argue that flows then were more diverse.
@da1sy38 It sounds like this thing got hammered together between Saturday afternoon and Sunday evening. I think it's totally fair to say they should have had it ready already. But since they didn't, not sure that 24h, over a weekend, DURING A SHUTDOWN is gonna get you that much more.
@MikeDrewWhat a) I'm hardly breaking news on an offer that's been out since last night	b) Actually, if I break news on Twitter instead of on Vox dot com that's not good for my website
@da1sy38 Yes, but, again, is this "they're not giving their negotiating partners what the negotiating partners requested" or "this seems _to me_ like they're not putting in the effort"?
@MikeDrewWhat In theory my job is not actually to tweet, but to write articles on the internet
@da1sy38 That's accurate, but Democrats weren't demanding more details, and never offered to like vote on any version of this. They're negotiating right now, it makes sense that they'll negotiate at high levels.
I appear to be the only person in DC taking the Trump administration's gov-reopening offer from last night seriously. So watch this space in the AM for a breakdown of what they actually want ‚Äî and why they're saying it represents good faith.
@da1sy38 Except they actually did? Or at least submit the OMB request Dems asked for?
@ReichlinMelnick @CramonBPC I think the underrated corollary to this is that similar dynamics can make an already-introduced prospect seem more imminent, eg: https://t.co/95OFSHkyGh (That quote, without the context, was then featured prominently in the article by the reporter who asked it!)
@CramonBPC The thing about both of those, though, is that he'd actually demanded them behind closed doors for some time...whereas this one genuinely appears to have been incepted in his brain by a question on Thursday.
This is a really live possibility and raises big q's about how to cover. Does one treat it as the president making mouth noises? Or as a real declaration that can be litigated for violating the National Emergencies Act by not posting the paperwork? https://t.co/Lq3RQetJKo
@happycycling03 in historical context that's nothing https://t.co/zWT2lJnwKA
@happycycling03 A) no	B) caravans are a low percentage of apprehensions	Cf https://t.co/UzUZKzOP7k for borderwide stats
I ask because I have not seen anyone actually bother to map out from ‚Äúemergency declared‚Äù to ‚ÄúTrump gets even as much wall money as he rejected in Senate CR.‚Äù And it seems that that might be a relevant factor in whether he pulls the trigger on it.
Has anyone explained to Trump (or those encouraging him) that it‚Äôs not like you say ‚Äústate of emergency‚Äù and billions of $ start falling from the sky? You have to actually unlock specific funding sources? And you can‚Äôt declare one until you spell out how you‚Äôre using it?
That DOES NOT mean article isn‚Äôt correct that Trump seriously weighing this. Sometimes you need to use on-record quotes that align with what you‚Äôre hearing on-background/off the record. But the briefing was about admin‚Äôs offer to Ds‚Äîthe opposite of giving up and calling emergency
It‚Äôs really disorienting to read this from a briefing where I was in the room. The article makes it seem like Pence was talking a bunch about emergency, instead of answering q‚Äôs asked by reporters about it (and pivoting where he could). https://t.co/wnJQHk1DR6
@BabiesFree https://t.co/fHMtTR28UM
@nbeaudrot Well, apparently the refs are easily worked...
I mean look, if the networks are all going to commit themselves to talking a bunch about immigration policy realities as a way of getting out of the ‚Äúfact-checking the president‚Äù dilemma, I personally would be appeased. Maybe.
And that was announcing a SERIES of major policy initiatives, including DACA+/DAPA and the prosecutional discretion policy that totally overhauled deportations in his last 2 years.		Trump will be talking about the need for the wall. https://t.co/pRP7YLrumY

To be clear, a question was asked about whether the White House Counsel's office was looking into it, and VP Pence said they were. And then pivoted to the idea of Congress passing an "emergency supplemental," as he did every time asked about the emergency thing. https://t.co/c3OYbdEWSX
@appliedsoft 1) that quote comes from a memo that refers to a policy that was in effect for only 11 days	2) quote is not about # of ppl coming in but where they enter	3) quote says the admin would prefer a situation of very long lines at ports of entry OVER apprehending people between POEs

@BillPotterNYC 1) Most apprehendees weren't detained for any meaningful length of time‚Äîeither returned w/o formal deportation (pre-05 or so) or deported via "expedited removal" w/o court hearing (post-05).	2) Adult &amp; fam detention facilities (not to mention kid custody) aren't interchangeable.

@malcubed The blue line here represents apprehensions (between ports of entry); the red represents those AND inadmissibles (at ports of entry). They started tracking the former in Oct 2011 and the latter in Oct 2016. https://t.co/oAqoUQbWmr
@malcubed Within the window they've been tracking, it absolutely is. (Hold on, I'll have a graph for you in 5m.) And while they haven't been formally tracking long, it does seem that the pre-tracking period didn't feature anything like this.
@_stvnmnl @delphi_ote Quite possibly!!
@_stvnmnl @delphi_ote I think that there‚Äôs a meaningful difference because ‚Äúit feels that way because...it feels that way‚Äù and ‚Äúno, literally, the basic function of my job is that when there is immigration news I write about it, and I can never trust that there won‚Äôt be immigration news‚Äù
(My condo board is pretty good and is stopped from taking necessary action by bad bylaws that they can‚Äôt get changed because of status quo bias, sooooo)
In fairness condo associations are by no means necessarily less dysfunctional than Congress https://t.co/RsyiTmN22Y
@Haleaziz Blurgh. Sorry.
@Haleaziz It seems to me that those of y‚Äôall with kids have perforce a less 100/0 work-life balance rn, and are immunized from the idea that your value in life is solely reducible to the production of market labor.
@gabrielmalor It's fair to say they're "working without pay" insofar as the labor they are performing right now will not be compensated until the shutdown is over, though?
@dan_munz I can certainly imagine that world but it's worth noting that such a president would be SUBSTANTIALLY to the left of Obama's response in 2014
@dan_munz I am trying really hard not to get into normativity, but it seems like there is an emerging consensus that the status quo isn't equipped to handle the current inflow of fams/kids, so trying to think of what would address that issue.
@dan_munz Where barriers needed, bollards are the best way that's been developed so far to do that. I think there might actually be a good argument that more barriers needed https://t.co/EgrWPwYTKz tho a) they're not making it and b) it'd have to come with a lot of expansion of capacity
@delphi_ote I'm saying that I've spent the last two years feeling some degree of burnout, and clearly under an unsustainable amount of stress, and it's overwhelmingly a function of non-discretionary pressure ‚Äî because simply doing the basic function of my job requires working all the time.
Anyway if I could disable @-replies on individual threads I sure would do it here, because I'm not fishing for praise, it's just putting it out there as we all digest that essay together.
This isn't about caring more, it's about literally having to follow this for a living. It's definitely a thing that other people in immigration-world also have (esp those without kids, tbh). Reporters on some other beats do too, esp if they're the only one at their outlet.
@BabiesFree Yeah, I suspect that those of us who literally have to pay attention to this stuff for a living all have this genre of burnout to some extent.
"Why am I burned out? Because whenever I feel like I ought to take a break, there is another policy change, or nationwide outrage, or a tweet that at the time seems like it's going to turn the world on its ear."
So I suspect this millennial-burnout piece won't resonate with me as much as it does with most of y'all. Because right now, this doesn't seem like something I've internalized so much as something the historical moment (and Donald Trump) have imposed on me. https://t.co/xjFRzqY5Or https://t.co/Eb9YFpjHKe
A wall wouldn't be SUFFICIENT response to this, by any means, bc there are big big q's about capacity at ports of entry. But in theory, the admin COULD say that a wall would help funnel families to places where government had the capacity to take them in. https://t.co/iEsHRARvYm
The admin is weirdly not making the best argument it could here. Most fams surrender _between_ ports of entry._ Increasingly they go to remote sectors to do it where there aren't resources to care for vulnerable populations. https://t.co/bHOTgbEN0N https://t.co/4ujlSkiLh1

That would give Congress some cushion. But it still wouldn‚Äôt be 6 months‚Äô worth like the original (failed) DACA legislation effort. 	And without Trump saying that, Congress/WH are going to have a REALLY tight negotiating window before lotsa ppl start losing DACA every day.
Now, because Donald Trump controls the executive branch, he could come out and say that if SCOTUS rules in his favor on DACA he will instruct DHS to create orderly winddown process (already-submitted applications for renewals still considered, etc.)
Also:	If SCOTUS rules with the admin on DACA, the opinion _isn‚Äôt going to come with a plan for what should happen next._	That‚Äôs going to be up to DHS.	Depending on how DHS does it, it‚Äôs totally possible large #s of ppl could be vulnerable to losing protections in matter of weeks.
How is he saying the second while saying that Dems are the ones who walked away from DACA in 2018 because of the court case? https://t.co/PN81o0iuye

PS it would be really nice if the iPhone stopped autocapitalizing ‚Äúborder,‚Äù a term that is pretty much never a proper noun.
I don‚Äôt think Trump is actually directing Kirstjen Nielsen to rip up the contracts they‚Äôve inked &amp; stop construction on the ongoing bollard projects. I think he‚Äôs just making mouth noises. But yikes, it would be nice if the president‚Äôs mouth noises corresponded at all to reality.
Meanwhile, DHS has multiple contracts out for existing build projects using 2017 and 2018 budget. They‚Äôre all bollard. So are the planned contracts for disbursement with the rest of that money, and what they wanted the $5B for. https://t.co/WYvHTruU7F
In the first half of 2017 DHS put out an RFP for prototypes for both concrete and non-concrete barriers.	Those prototypes were built at the end of 2017 and tested at beginning of 2018.	Per GAO, they all had big problems.	But that is how contracting is supposed to work.
1) this totally undermines everything both Trump and DHS have been saying about using bollard fencing because it‚Äôs the design that suits their needs &amp; the prefs of Border agents.	2) It is simply not how federal contracting works. https://t.co/Z15aMglk5Y

(a) if the "national emergency" thing were real this would be a genuine dilemma, b) the fact that they are "looking into" declaring emergency WHILE negotiating AND demanding Dems cave should be an indication that the "emergency" tactic is policy vaporware.)
@golikehellmachi Only to the extent that this whole "national emergency" thing is a fever dream. If it were real policywise so would my question be.

Bless the president for justifying my decision to spend my midday putting together a timeline of exactly what happened with the DACA negotiations in early 2018. (Spoiler alert: the judicial injunction wasn't the turning point!)
"We may add a few things onto our discussions over the weekend." That's the bottom line, policy-wise, from this ramble. The president is still unwilling to take any of his demands (which as of this AM went further than what he's discussing) off the table or endorse any tradeoffs.
Fact check: Barack Obama did not sign an executive order to create DACA, and he certainly did not say, when signing it, "This isn't gonna work."
I can't believe I have to fact-check the president on this, but you can't "apply for citizenship" at the US border. You can only apply for it if you have a green card, which you can only get if you have specific existing ties to the US.

@mattyglesias https://t.co/iLbnRful4o
The fact that conservatives are still using "brick" as the unit of wall rather than "slat" speaks to the perhaps-underappreciated extent to which Trump never actually brought conservatives along with his own Kelly-aided evolution in thinking about the wall in early 2017. https://t.co/J2wL8Siv6L

My kingdom for an actual theorist to talk about the symbolism of "the wall" instead of all these pundits using "symbolism" as a synonym for "signaling."

@chrissnowbeck üèÜü•Åüì¶:	If this ever becomes a real award y'all can attack me for awarding my own nominee, but seriously @hansilowang has been singlehandedly covering one of the lowkey biggest stories of the year, bow down: https://t.co/vvS9zGwNl4

(similarly disqualified was anybody who carries several beats at once, no matter how indefatigible they are ‚Äî sorry BuzzFeed legal team ‚Äî because it's really hard to distinguish multibeat reporters from just generalists.)
First of all, what I would lovingly call the "Basics' Choice Award" for @ddale8, who got more nominations than anyone else but THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION HAS ITS OWN AWARDS so I am categorically exempting him, not sorry, he's tremendous and essential anyway.
I got a lot of nominations and also uhhhh a bunch of news broke in the meantime so I did not exactly have time to follow some of the new-to-me journalists who got surfaced. But following are a handful of nominations, bylines and beats that stood out.
As most of you know, I occasionally climb on soapboxes about how journalism awards reward One Really Ambitious Piece over the day to day work of beat coverage, even when the latter can reveal more info/nuance over time. So I tweeted this a week ago: https://t.co/EhrqpxRBxc
::clangs some pots and spoons together::		HEY PEOPLE LET'S CELEBRATE SOME REALLY CONSISTENTLY AWESOME BEAT REPORTING
@MetalheadEsq That was @tvoti and I have not gotten to this yet but I have heard it's a TREASURE

@nhallfreelance cc @russellbrandom
@praddenkeefe @atlemar And I've definitely heard of marriage-fraud investigations opened on flimsier evidence than "they were married only a year, and he told his next partner he got married for the green card."
@praddenkeefe @atlemar It depends substantially on what form of legal status, if any, he had between getting out of LAX and getting his green card after marriage. But the idea that he just walks into the US with intent to immigrate, and then starts working immediately, seems rill hard to square.
@praddenkeefe @atlemar Good lord. Unless the law was different pre-86 in ways I was not previously aware of, there are three distinct violations of US law in here.

@atlemar Going to cc @praddenkeefe in case he has some details that didn't make it into the story but would satisfy a couple of immigration nerds WRT how, exactly, Burnett entered the US and whether he violated US law either by doing so or by working pre-green card.
@atlemar He came in 82, per Wikipedia; VWP created in 86.
@atlemar I just read it this AM and read over that passage twice because as written it sounds like he managed to get past customs with no visa, which sounds wrong, AND his first marriage seems like the sort of thing ICE would be investigating as potentially fraudulent today.
So far today 2 people have referred to this/next year as 2019/2020 respectively. How many more of these until we have just skipped ahead a year by acclamation?

@kebindoinwork Yeah, I specifically said "endorsed" because if you only hint at something as a way to complain that the other side isn't dealing, you can easily find fault in any actual proposal to that effect the other side makes.
1) Has any Republican in Congress or non-Trump member of the Trump admin publicly endorsed wall-for-DACA? 	2) It sure seemed to me, reporting on it at the time, that the Jan '18 injunction on DACA made GOP, at least as much as Dems, feel the pressure was off. https://t.co/ZUdPQSKspA
@dan_munz I guess the other part of this is that for whatever reason, a lot of people Google "Trump tweets" or similar, as if running around tasting water fountains for doses of acid.
@dan_munz Much more "since a third party spiked your drinking water with LSD, wouldn't you at least like to get some animal facts out of the experience"?
@dan_munz The news orgs aren‚Äôt necessarily creating the demand for content about Trump tweets! I am on record as supporting this strategy as a way to create some value out of posts that the market apparently demands.
(The $5.9B investment touted last week was inflated as I noted at the time. And it‚Äôs true that FY2019 budget proposal would cut NorTri aid relative to 18. But that‚Äôs bc it‚Äôs cutting aid EVERYWHERE.)

@SleepySteve95 Was based in specific provision in US law that I (&amp; others) wrote could give the president pretty broad powers even before 2016 election, and was something Trump actually followed through on rather than threatening with no action every 4 weeks, so I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre saying.

@spencerdailey @JamilSmith (I also don‚Äôt know where they got the idea that the ppl arrested were legal immigrants.)
@spencerdailey @JamilSmith Wonkette framed that in a really dishonest way.

Not applicable here.

@Wallacewriter Drought and crushing poverty in Guatemala. Gangs, unrest, distrust in Honduras. Innovations in smuggling techniques. Network effects of knowing someone who successfully came with family and was allowed to stay pending asylum. We know, but that's different from being able to fix.
@tznkai Yeah, this runs into the part of this problem I get into in the last section of the piece, which is that it's genuinely unclear what form of government custody would be trusted as humane rn.
@tznkai I've been trying to run that counterfactual in my head for several days and I really don't know if there's an answer because I don't know how foreseeable this was. A year ago, asking for more capacity at remote BP stations in New Mexico would have seemed an ENORMOUS boondoggle.
@tznkai I would love to have details on staffing and physical capacity at Lordsburg vs Brownsville vs Alamogordo or whatever, or even on daily apprehensions. We don't have any of that. The most granular I can give you is that 11/2018 apps of families were 2.5x previous peak in El Paso.
ok now you can read this and log off https://t.co/bmKiDIkxhA
It's not getting much attention (thanks in large part to Trump's crying wolf) but we really are seeing something unprecedented at border RN. More families than ever coming in, in bigger groups, in more remote places. Officials and nonprofits can't cope. https://t.co/bmKiDIkxhA
@atlemar We don't really have numbers at that level of granularity but I'm pretty sure the answer to this is no. There are some details in the piece about the # of fams coming in in historical context. We really are looking at something unprecedented.
@DavidKubat1 My understanding is that under the guidance issued to USBP, there would be NTAs issued before release from USBP custody. Not sure re tracking. Certainly wouldn't bet against chaos.
Given the scrutiny of Border Patrol detention conditions and recent deaths of kids in BP custody, Trump critics will likely greet this as good news. But it's not clear where these families are going to _go._ Many will likely end up dumped at bus stations. https://t.co/bmKiDIkxhA
ICE is already releasing families. But in policy shift, Border Patrol agents have been sent a plan that would allow them to release fams directly ‚Äî w/o holding them until ICE pickup.  https://t.co/bmKiDIkxhA

@FelipeDLH There's also the fact that the SRE still has that promise floating out there of visas/work permits for RiM subjects. STC doesn't create any obligations for the third country to actually grant any status.
@FelipeDLH The same phenomenon at three different scales:	-RiM = people actually being screened by US officials	-would allow third-country nationals to stay in US if they demonstrated fear of staying in MX	-legal responsibility under international law would belong to US as well as MX

Here's the thing. At every turn MX has said "no Safe Third Country." They have said this even in the statements that say they WILL cooperate with RiM.

@bradheath Or if journalism contests realized that their efforts to reward "Impact Journalism" were simply creating a known set of tropes to provide a simalcrum of Impact that was only recognized as such by journalism contests!
PS: there are huge structural things in the journalism industry favoring One Killer Human Story over months of incremental reporting. Even if the latter over time incorporate more information and nuance. This is root of my complaint re dearth of awards for beat reporting.
That's not to say that the craft folks weren't thinking about impact in policy debates ‚Äî indeed, this is similar to the reasoning you hear from advocates all the time about "stories not statistics." But it's not by any means the same as the grassroots movement Moore describes.
the virtue of using real people to tell stories wasn't simply bearing witness to them, or letting _them_ tell those stories. It was that the emotions of real people provided better raw material to be shaped with Craft into something truly indelible as a reading experience.
The magazine tradition gave us some terrific bottom-up policy journalism. I am FAR from the only journalist my age who does what I do because of "The Marriage Cure." https://t.co/CnCUzlHh2r But here's the thing:
What Moore describes as the old school of policy writing ‚Äî stenography for officials taking the actions ‚Äî was the norm for _daily newspaper reporting,_ but there was an entire magazine tradition that regarded it kind of high-handedly as mechanistic.
This is a fascinating account but does not AT ALL jibe with my experience. Storytelling/people-as-characters was being taught as the highest form of journalistic writing in my Ivy League school during the Bush administration. It was what elevated journalism to craft. https://t.co/eSMGl13DXV

It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see how reax to the latest death in CBP custody compares to reax to death of Jakelin Caal Maquin. W/Caal, the failure to acknowledge the death for a week or notify Congress created an obvious entry point for Dems in Congress to say CBP did wrong.

@andrewlevine Some prototypes were simply concrete per DHS RFP. But bc those don‚Äôt appear to make operational sense they don‚Äôt appear to be what they‚Äôre moving forward with. It appears that Lankford incorrectly believes neither bollards nor spikes was part of the discussion  before this week.
@christinawilkie And what they have said publicly they want to build with the $5B Trump asked for.		I understand the semantic fence vs. wall distinction, but I have NO IDEA what Lankford is talking about when he says bollard isn‚Äôt in any of the plans.
@christinawilkie The new vs. replacement fight is about WHERE barriers are built, not WHAT they look like. Bollards have been part of the conversation at every step in the process; were featured in every non-concrete wall prototype; and are what DHS is building for all non-levee new wall build.
@ReichlinMelnick Yeah I think the plaque is amusing bc it‚Äôs such obvious Trumpbait, but that makes it SO SAD that he doesn‚Äôt even notice or care!!

@dan_munz I would be lying if I said I did not also have this thought, if only bc it was awfully short notice
A locked follower points out that M-F gov employees won‚Äôt be affected unless the shutdown persists through Wednesday.	Of course, USBP and OFO frontliners often aren‚Äôt M-F and somebody still has to work Xmas.
@dan_munz Fairnuff and my b, but that does make it all the more ironic that USBP and OFO frontliners are going to be among the relatively few folks who are affected
I would advise the same to government employees who are about to go without a paycheck. Special shoutout to the ones who have to work anyway. Extra-special shoutout for irony to US Border Patrol. https://t.co/YkZVtXiYeK

@Tanvim tanvi save yourself
@tysonbrody Nah, what I was saying was that _to the extent this is criticism just about Trump_ then it is dumb criticism
@tysonbrody Wasteful is a separate conversation IMHO. But if by "ridiculous" you mean "a thing that wouldn't exist if not for Donald Trump's ego" then yes I definitely think that is not accurate.

Uh, hot take: that design is actually a decent representation of what bollard fencing looks like
@tznkai SCOTUS refused the administration's request to stay the asylum ban injunction
@NeonPlatypus To be fully honest: I think that denaturalization as it has happened in 2017-18 is largely the continuation of previous presidents' efforts, and the expansion people are talking about is still more feared than actual. (cf https://t.co/XKaLtxhDyS )

I know this isn't actually why the RBG-voting-from-the-hospital-bed thing is notable, but just to say: if RBG hadn't voted, a 4-4 tie would have resulted in the same outcome of allowing the lower court ruling to remain in effect unimpeded.
@TomJawetz @ReichlinMelnick IDK, after everyone assumed that the asylum ban would be enjoined from jump and then it wasn't, assuming something won't be is a better move. Especially if they really are rolling it out during the Xmas/New Year's stretch when it will be hard for court to calendar aggressively.
@TomJawetz @ReichlinMelnick Yeah, but I do in fact think it's not a good idea to assume RiM/MPP will be enjoined from jump.
@TomJawetz https://t.co/ZeQ8tdkRGQ
@ReichlinMelnick @Haleaziz Right, having both is definitely better for the WH than just having one, but I would bet you they'd rather have RiM than 212(f).
@Haleaziz I think that everyone and their mother is overestimating the possibility that RiM will be enjoined before it goes into effect.		I also think that bc of the foreign-policy nexus of RiM it's going to get more deference from SCOTUS.
The thing about the asylum ban remaining enjoined per SCOTUS, btw, is that it's basically superseded by the new return-to-MX policy that we are being told will be rolled out in the coming days. So from a policy standpoint it is not as huge a defeat for WH as it would've been.
@Haleaziz Ehhhh....kind of superseded by RiM anyway...
RT @chrisgeidner: BREAKING: The Supreme Court denies the Trump administration‚Äôs request to let it enforce its new asylum ban while the case‚Ä¶
@TomJawetz It's not a whole-cloth thing, it's a TVPRA makes them not subject to ER thing, right?
@TomJawetz Asterisk: theoretically they'd be exempt from the policy	Asterisk to the asterisk: if INM officials started letting them enter at POEs to begin with
@patrickwtimmons @roberto_suro @NickMiroff @ElisabethMalkin @JuliaPrestonNow I agree with all of this but I think that anyone assuming there will be activity in US courts before there is implementation on the ground is honestly making a huge assumption.
@patrickwtimmons @roberto_suro @NickMiroff @ElisabethMalkin @JuliaPrestonNow There're 2 different categories of unknowns here: the unknowns that will have to be resolved before the US begins to implement the policy on its side, and the unknowns that Mexico will have to work out (or not!) as it goes. 		Plausible that INM's concerns are in 2nd category.

@JJCarafano But they don't get paid until it's over, so when I talk to frontliners they're usually quite anxious about the possibility
@asgvisalaw @AlOtroLado_Org @ACLU I am not at all sure we are going to see litigation before this starts getting rolled out. And this has been one of the q's I've been reporting on today. If you have info I don't you are WELCOME to DM me.
@MikeDrewWhat LOL sorry yes fair. It has been a day, Michael.
@MikeDrewWhat I never subtweet just one person but this time I was subtweeting my entire home feed at the time, which I would not assume included you.
Help keep me from having an aneurysm by reading this article today https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii and the article that I have tomorrow (which may not answer a lot of q's bc there's still a LOT TBD, but I hope will do a better job of explaining WHY YOU OUGHT TO #$$% PAY ATTENTION) Bless.
Maybe (??) once we have more policy details and people are physically being returned to Mexico, there will be more attention paid to this. But honestly, there was never a ton of attention to the unofficial policy of making people wait https://t.co/iEsHRARvYm so I'm not sanguine
I NEED EVERYONE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE #$#$ WALL FOR THIRTY SECONDS	THE WALL DOES NOT MATTER	PPL COMING TO US ARE INCREASINGLY SEEKING ASYLUM, WHICH IS LEGAL &amp; CAN BE DONE AT PORTS (official crossings)	AND THOSE PPL NOW HAVE TO GO BACK TO MEXICO ANYWAY	https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii
@hectorcorr85 @patrickwtimmons @NickMiroff @MarkManly @Sleutert Yes, but honestly that mirrors the language in the US statements; the statement from Nielsen said aliens "may be returned to Mexico," etc.
@DavidKubat1 The thing is that the initial line was  $$$ in southern MX and the Northern Triangle was the "pro quo," and they had a big rollout of that earlier this week, but it _wasn't any new direct investment_ so either they are getting rolled or they have given up on their primary ask
In summary, while I get the appeal of the narrative of "LOL Trump announced a thing that Mexico won't do," right now it really does look like Mexico will in fact do it.
See also, back in November, when the very same AMLO official-in-waiting told the WaPo that there was a deal and then put out a non-denial denial statement. Everyone took the latter as dispositive then. It wasn't. We have the proof now. https://t.co/UHyTn1J9Cn
See also, the presser this AM where a legal advisor referred to this as a bilateral deal before calling it a unilateral deal https://t.co/2WFqQcM6Jn
Their migration agency answered "No" when asked "So despite the US announcement you're not going to take back migrants?" https://t.co/k2yg7FnehI	but there is an ENTIRE STATEMENT from gov about how they will do just that https://t.co/6kPa2BQjhP
AMLO admin's messaging around US returning asylum-seekers to MX is contradictory, but there are more/more serious statements indicating they will cooperate than won't. A very short thread.
@patrickwtimmons @NickMiroff @MarkManly @Sleutert FWIW, the English translation sent to press simply translates posicionamiento as "statement." And while it doesn't use the term agreement per se, it sure does say that MX has decided that it will allow ppl to return once they have a notice to appear before an immigration judge.
@patrickwtimmons @NickMiroff @MarkManly @Sleutert ??
@DavidKubat1 @SeanDupuis7 This is so, so much more detail than anyone in the government is actually willing to confirm about how any of this will work, BTW. This is also my intuition, but especially given that they're saying "it'll look different at different places" who the hell knows.
@patrickwtimmons @NickMiroff @MarkManly @Sleutert They LITERALLY PUT THIS OUT ALREADY https://t.co/6kPa2BQjhP
@yjtorbati Yeah, but plenty of stuff worth asking about has happened since then, so can understand why MOCs wouldn't want to waste time on q's that at the time seemed speculative? IDK
Hard to ask questions about a policy no one appears to have known was going to happen until just before the hearing!! https://t.co/eZTFaBwOAs
So Trump has just achieved the coup of his presidency on his signature issue by requiring asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii	And he's stepping on that story to demand shutdown over border wall that _doesn't matter if the US can just push people back._
This is weird as hell given a) that gov of Mex is saying policy is "in particular" for the benefit of minors https://t.co/6kPa2BQjhP and b) Mex officials have been preventing unaccompanied minors from presenting themselves at ports of entry for asylum https://t.co/JeNZVOTkJP https://t.co/BzelfzxkLg
@yjtorbati @msdayvt This totally goes against what MX is saying about it being "in particular" for the benefit of minors https://t.co/6kPa2BQjhP
@msdayvt ?? Have they said this? I haven't seen or heard anything about it in their communications
@lomikriel @Haleaziz i had forgotten about this and i am mad at you ALL OVER AGAIN
@asgvisalaw So purely from reading the public tea leaves, my interpretation is that Mexico sees it this way: it is ALREADY de facto their problem that thousands of people are waiting, and so at least this is making the de facto de jure?
@DavidKubat1 Yes, presumably.
@Haleaziz The thing to watch here is the possibility of "port courts."
@LeonKrauze Leon! ¬°Qu√© elogio!
Between this and careful parsing of the NYT piece Tuesday, which AT THE TIME made it sound like MX was taking a much harder line (partly bc NYT reporters appear to have missed the mark), it really does look like MX is cool with this but didn't want to get blamed for it. https://t.co/2WFqQcM6Jn
@brian_griffey @DHSgov @SecNielsen FWIW, this is at least part of what that statement refers to in practice: https://t.co/VIPLr6ODER
@Haleaziz I used term "persecution" in my question bc it is also in the CF standard for asylum https://t.co/komQfLWlox
@BorderReporter UNCLEAR.
@Haleaziz No clarity on CF, RF, or hypothetically some other mechanism. We'll have to see what operational guidance looks like I guess!
@karlazabs Karla I'm so sorry, that tweet had the wrong link, any chance you can redo with this one? https://t.co/VIPLr6ODER
This provision ‚Äî which was part of the deal being discussed by Trump and AMLO in November, but which DOJ (per @Haleaziz ' reporting) was trying to eliminate ‚Äî partly addresses human-rights groups' biggest concern that Mexico isn't a safe place for asylum seekers. (fixt prev link)
HUGE update: Admin official confirms to Vox that under the new return-to-Mexico plan, asylum-seekers WILL have the opportunity to stay in the US if they demonstrate they fear persecution IN MEXICO. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii (fixed link)
I can't get over this. While the US has been discussing this with the Mexican government, they decided to move forward unilaterally. And meanwhile, THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE DOING THIS DIDN'T GET A HEADS-UP. https://t.co/Yi8iWKYnUW
@jameslfredrick No because this is all so sudden, but I would be shocked if we didn't have anything by end of the week. If it takes any longer it'll be because they are still rolling it out and some key details aren't yet known.
That Donald Trump isn't all over Twitter and Fox crowing about this says only that Trump doesn't understand policy. It's a MUCH bigger deal than billions in wall money in terms of admin's goal of repelling entry of ppl to US without papers. Be smart. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii
There are a lot of details that are still TK. 2 frontline employees who'd be involved in implementing the policy told Vox they hadn't heard anything before the announcement Thursday morning. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii
It's not at all clear how the US or MX are going to protect the safety of people while they wait. Earlier this week, 2 teenagers were killed outside their shelter while waiting to be allowed to seek asylum at a port of entry. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii
The turnback policy applies to those who enter US between ports of entry (illegally) &amp; to those seeking asylum at ports of entry (ie following all US laws). 	Both have a right to seek asylum once on US soil.	Now they can't stay on US soil while they do it. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii
üö®DHS just rolled out the biggest move in Trump's ongoing asylum crackdown‚Äîarguably the single biggest immigration move he's made period.	Asylum-seekers will be forced to wait in Mexico during the months or years it takes to process their claims in the US. https://t.co/1vPecwE1Ii
@Bob_Ortega @CNNPolitics The question here is what impact the A-B- ruling had. People who are still getting CF approvals under A-B- by definition would not be affected by whether the policy was in effect or not.
Remain in Mexico is happening. (They're calling it the "Migration Protection Protocols.")		More from me TK, but see my piece on this deal when it was under discussion for background: https://t.co/UHyTn1J9Cn https://t.co/asaGDPDOmV

@Bob_Ortega @CNNPolitics Hm. My best read of the CF stats suggests we‚Äôre talking a few hundred a month (and bc this is just CF, not final asylum, those are the stats that count). https://t.co/37t8suMLO1 Eventually that adds up to many thousands, but eventually, so does anything.
@MikeDrewWhat Yes, actually ‚Äî see https://t.co/e1orzRs3iS ‚Äî but I suspect people on this thread might disagree with each other about how much stock to put in that.
@chrislhayes It's not! I had a follow-up tweet but it took me a while to compose it. https://t.co/1DS6zTMzJU
I just stay so worried about idea that the relevant standard for moral responsibility is "were you physically in the custody of a government official or not." A policy that worried about border deaths period would perforce be broader, bc more ppl die in desert than in custody.
I am never going to disagree with calls for more transparency.		But we shouldn't be ignoring the fact that when people (like this toddler) are already sick coming into CBP custody, there are also going to be more people not making it at all.		https://t.co/bHOTgbEN0N https://t.co/f2F4pxCBuc

@ombudsman4truth TED is probably closer to Davos/Bilderberg level, and I have been to that, kind of (was there for work the first 2 days and left after)
@ombudsman4truth One of these things is extremely not like the others. I've been to SXSW (for like 7 hours, I only went to the panel I was moderating, there were like 30 people there) and it is basically just a really big convention at this point?
@garrardwhatley ESPECIALLY because we have extensive evidence that UACs are being denied access to the list governing who gets asylum at San Ysidro

I feel like nothing I have ever read about Davos prepares me for every new thing I learn about Davos https://t.co/3ERB6y17D9
Of course, it's worth noting that even if we somehow get definitive answers to What Happened To Jakelin Caal Maquin, more people including more kids are probably still going to die. https://t.co/bHOTgbEN0N
But q's raised in last 2 days directly contradict a written letter to Congress from CBP commissioner Kevin McAleenan ‚Äî &amp; go beyond initial stmt from Caal's family, which challenged a few, but not many, parts of that account. So the stakes are higher now &amp; so is temperature.
The failure to report was 1st specific prob w/CBP's handling of Caal's case (identified Fri) &amp; is now 1st to generate policy response. Since then other issues raised, including, today, a challenge to CBP's account that Jakelin was given water in custody. https://t.co/u7r3jhN53r
Dems in Congress have said CBP violated an existing instruction to report deaths in custody by not proactively reporting Caal's; but bc there wasn't a firm time limit CBP contested that characterization. Their resolution is to issue a new policy themselves. https://t.co/uilk4hcPfB
@rachelwalexande The second sentence gets in the way of the first, of course :) There has not been a serious argument that a particular proposed build is un/necessary for X reasons. It is all getting overshadowed by "Trump wants a wall!"/"Well Trump can't get a wall!"
@rachelwalexande This is why this whole thing is dumb; no one actually wants a physical barrier across the whole thing, everyone thinks some physical barrier is necessary. Generally, looking at specific approps requests/proposals is best way to determine what actual "wall" is being proposed.
@rachelwalexande LOL, indeed. The president may not have been aware of this before he was inaugurated; his understanding of what counts as the wall continues to evolve.

@UnlawfulEntries (The argument for ending metering is a higher-level ‚Äúif you want people to enter legally help them enter legally‚Äù; it just gets trickier to draw any specific causal connection.)
@UnlawfulEntries I don‚Äôt think the connection is that straightforward tbh. There have always been more families crossing between POEs in RGV than at POEs across border. The smuggler control of routes matters there. That might be a factor here as well.

@dcbigjohn @CBP @JoaquinCastrotx Antelope Wells POE is only open from 10a-4p. I would be SHOCKED if they were encountering and detaining 100 inadmissibles during those 6 hours.
@dcbigjohn @CBP @JoaquinCastrotx 1) CBP said previously that Caal &amp; rest of group were held @ Bounds FOB, not at Antelope Wells POE itself. Are they now changing their story?	2) Are you sure that Antelope Wells detains 100 people _on a daily basis?_ That would be 2x the size of Nogales.

@estarianne Interesting. I haven't seen anything about this. There are the 1300+ sponsors who have already _cleared background checks_ but kids haven't been released to, which is different (&amp; not affected by this change).
@derkie313 Right, that's a different thing from what this policy would change tho. Merkley has said that those 1,300 sponsors have already cleared their background checks, meaning they've already submitted all relevant prints.
@Lauren__Bennett There is a separate question about them continuing to hold kids after sponsors have come forward and been identified, but that's not what this policy seeks to change.
@Lauren__Bennett Not precisely--the logic here is:	1) the reason there are so many kids in custody RN is that sponsors are afraid to come forward, so if	2) you get rid of the thing that freaked out sponsors, then	3) sponsors will come forward and 	4) fewer kids will be in custody.
Note also that we don't know how many of the sponsors afraid to come forward now are themselves unauthorized imms ‚Äî who will still have to submit prints under the new policy! ‚Äî vs. simply being afraid on behalf of relatives
@opendna The policy change is whether prints of the rest of the household will be collected--so easy to hold them to not use info they won't have. But they're not promising ICE won't continue to use the individual sponsor's info. &amp; seems like that would be enough to frighten folks.
The "could free" here relies on assumption that a lot of ppl currently afraid to come fwd will change their minds the minute the policy changes, which seems optimistic (chilling effects usually overbroad/overpersistent), but this is indeed big news https://t.co/wj2DTeoXuP

AMLO and the US just trumpeted a $5.9B US commitment to the Northern Triangle.		As State breaks it down, tho, it's $3.15B in already spent/pledged $, plus $180M in admin's FY19 budget request, plus a new $2.5B that "could" be spent "if commercially viable projects IDed" https://t.co/lAlsFIHasc

@Domhnall_G There are at least 2 ill-defined terms in immigration law that affect this ‚Äî "crimes involving moral turpitude" and "aggravated felonies" ‚Äî and both have spawned huge bodies of jurisprudence. And there probably are more ill-defined terms as well.
People who won't be affected:	1) US citizens	2) Green card holders who don't violate terms of their green cards	Pretty much everyone here since 1995 will fall into 1 of those categories. And a lot more fall into the safe categories than the affected ones. https://t.co/N7wlnHO9ca
@RoqPlanas i made u a cite https://t.co/N7wlnHO9ca
Ppl who'll be affected:	1) legal imms who lost status bc they committed serious crimes	2) ppl who have been here for 23+ yrs but are currently unauthorized...which is almost certainly bc they committed a crime that made them ineligible for green card https://t.co/N7wlnHO9ca
Here's what's up:	there exists an agreement between the US and Vietnam that people ALREADY ORDERED DEPORTED can't be sent back to Vietnam if they arrived pre-1995.	Trump wants to make it so they can.	But it doesn't change who can be ordered deported. https://t.co/N7wlnHO9ca

@chelsea_janes Did he mean it that way, or just as "pictures that are graphics"?
@Mark_Kawada this isn't a _but,_ it is the point in the piece?
@Mark_Kawada Oh it's a total fucking mess but the idea that these are a) legal immigrants who b) responded to a call to sponsor kids out of pure charity is a fiction. This might be a better way to look at it. https://t.co/9zDa2oeVfw
@Mark_Kawada That characterization is...uh, not good. In fact it's dead wrong. The people who step up to sponsor UACs are their relatives, usually parents. The 170 arrested were unauthorized immigrants. And they were arrested pursuant to a policy change that was publicly made this spring.
N.B.: it looks like the Atlantic wasn't able to ascertain whether Vietnam has actually agreed to this reinterpretation. If it hasn't, there isn't much the Trump admin can do. You can't deport (or indefinitely detain) someone whose home country won't take them.
@DavidKubat1 @AlanLCross This graf makes it sound like it is all pre-1995, which is a population that _wouldn't_ necessarily have final removal orders https://t.co/6I2dEHjrZM
@DavidKubat1 This ties into @AlanLCross' question to me about whether the shift here is from none --&gt; convicted criminals, or from convicted criminals --&gt; all.
@AlanLCross I honestly did not know about this agreement before the Atlantic article (there are some things in immigration policy I don't know, esp isolated carveouts like this) so I'm not sure.
This is the same situation TPS holders will be in as their TPS expires (tho in most cases those expirations are on hold in court https://t.co/pJzZJLndnQ). It's the same situation DACA holders will be in if SCOTUS allows Trump to go forward w/rescinding it. https://t.co/J5eUWMvXxo

8) The chilling effect stuff lasts. It's really, really hard to rebuild trust once it's destroyed. The Obama admin spent YEARS struggling to do this.	(I could go on but @dandrezner is a friend and a very smart dude and I don't want to pile on him too badly. FIN.)
6) The starving of the refugee resettlement program is killing an infrastructure that can't be rebuilt easily.	7) Let's not even talk about what happens if SCOTUS allows Trump to move ahead with DACA recission.
3) A lot of closed removal cases are being reopened.	4) Some people likely denied asylum under DOJ narrowing via AGs making new precedent.	5) 1000s of ppl losing TPS even with most TPS recissions put on hold in court. Some will leave; others may be deported if they stay.
1) A lot of people are going to have final orders of deportation/be deported at the end of Trump's time in office who wouldn't have been booked by ICE under previous guidance.	2) A lot of people are going to have visas/green cards denied bc of new RFE/denial stds.

In 1992, a reporter for the LA Times asked William Barr (then GHWBush's attorney general) if the LA riots had altered his agenda.	Barr's response, in part, was that unrest in LA was partly due to "the problem of immigration enforcement."	https://t.co/OmVjhdICbw

@dandrezner This is why we can't have nice things like bespoke article links.

Meet William Barr, everybody: a man who got the DOD to build border fencing, fought the courts to turn back asylum seekers, and blamed immigration, in part, for unrest in LA.		In 1992.		https://t.co/OmVjhdICbw
So um weirdly I guess we're still not talking about how William Barr is the perfect Trump AG nominee on immigration?		Guess everyone must be waiting for my forthcoming piece on this.
