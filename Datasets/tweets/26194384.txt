@PennieRushing @HillaryClinton @GabbyGiffords @lucymcbath @SpeakerPelosi When you make things that people want harder to get, it leads to the black market becoming more lucrative for the criminals involved (thus more tempting) &amp; more violent to protect their risky business. It happened with liquor during prohibition, happens with drugs today.
@dmbfan1201 Nice

@truth_isnt_hate @G_Dawg_Jones @Jim_Jordan You seem to feel pretty entitled to live here. And you did nothing to earn it but accidentally being born here.
@truth_isnt_hate @G_Dawg_Jones @Jim_Jordan I know what an enemy combatant is. Asylum seekers &amp; refugees are civilians seeking to escape a bad circumstance. If the drug problem in the US is Mex's fault, then you can't deny that innocent civilians in Latin America might actually need to seek refuge from the Cartels &amp; Gangs.
@truth_isnt_hate @G_Dawg_Jones @Jim_Jordan Army veteran here... The DOD is tasked with defending the Constitution of the USA against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same.	Unless we declare war on Mexico, the DOD has no business at the border, per the Posse Comitatus act.
@truth_isnt_hate @G_Dawg_Jones @bellarene7 @Jim_Jordan @POTUS But that "coaching" is on the USCIS website. **To obtain asylum through the affirmative asylum process you must be physically present in the US. You may apply for asylum status regardless of how you arrived in the US or your current immigration status.**	https://t.co/LGzyZ02mws

@bridget_joy_ @BillEaster10 It's not a federal holiday, but seven states celebrate that as a public holiday: CA, CT, IL, IN, MO, NY, and OH. I think the other states just conflate it with GW's bday, thus giving us the unofficial Presidents Day.
@bridget_joy_ @BillEaster10 Just refer to it by the official name for the holiday: George Washington's Birthday.
A happy George Washington's Birthday holiday to you all! 	(The official name of today's holiday is so much more appealing that President's Day, considering how the dignity of that office is gone)

@_taraleisa @PotusDjtVpMp @Jim_Jordan In this case, I think the left is correct and Trump is a threat to America's place in the world.
@_taraleisa @PotusDjtVpMp @Jim_Jordan It was a dumb campaign promise, too. But in general, I find most politicians distasteful and both major parties to be terrible, I do find Donnie to be an absolute disgrace and an embarrassment beyond the rest. And no amount of whataboutisms will change that.
@realDonaldTrump I laughed. The skit was a joke, like your administration.
@CrisB_13 @Jim_Jordan It feels more like POTUS has made demands of Congress and when he doesn't get his way, he throws a tantrum. His famed negotiating skills seem to be lacking.
@PotusDjtVpMp @Jim_Jordan I actually got that talking point from @LindseyGrahamSC:	https://t.co/xW38tdEbGz

@truth_isnt_hate @politicalGeoff2 @pappy63901 @Love_Cookin @Jim_Jordan It was easy enough for the entire @GOP to ignore the caravans after the midterms.
@PotusDjtVpMp @Jim_Jordan Which one of those is Mexico?
@truth_isnt_hate @Jim_Jordan You do realize that just because I think Trump is an anal fissure of a President, doesn't mean I'm a Democrat, however, I would take Obama back if for no other reason than he wasn't a daily embarrassment.
@PotusDjtVpMp @Jim_Jordan I prefer DACA to a failed, xenophobic campaign promise. Who's gonna pay for it??? The American Taxpayer!!!
@NancyOB49582905 @Jim_Jordan Are you referring to the release of Iranian assets frozen for 35 years to further nuclear talks to prevent an unstable country from getting nukes and destabalizing the world?	No, that is nothing like stealing from FEMA funds instead of getting Mexico to pay for a dumb ass wall.

@justinamash I'm no Congressman, but I think formal declarations of war are how it's supposed to work - not another AUMF. That's how we end up overextended EVERYWHERE fighting ill-defined wars that accomplish nothing (except making defense contractors [read: political donors] rich).
@realDonaldTrump It will. And we will all be better off for it. When you are indicted and removed from office, we can begin to Make America Great Again. Without you.
@LindseyGrahamSC So the Constitution &amp; the enumerated powers granted each branch of government no longer matter to you? I think that's a sign that you are unfit for public office.

@EanAngloSaxon @wanderingmil @NickAbuhl @RandPaul I know the difficulties of that statement; my last few years in the Army I was a public affairs officer.

@wanderingmil @NickAbuhl @EanAngloSaxon @RandPaul A better answer for you all: My comment was more aimed at the credibility of the statement I was responding to. Calling a highly polished turd a diamond does not make it so. Calling an epic clusterf**k a victory just makes you look stupid.

Since your party has placed @SteveKingIA on the sacrificial altar in order to reclaim some sort of moral high ground, there's probably room for another. https://t.co/oszk47xJoy
@realDonaldTrump If you didn't throw a tantrum and threaten to remove electric car subsidies after your steel tariffs forced @GM into layoffs, perhaps an American company would have built a plant in Chattanooga.

@_Jrlh_ @KellyMabry9 @APDW4MO @GOPChairwoman “The most common method employed by Mexican Transnational Criminal Organizations involves transporting drugs in vehicles through U.S. ports of entry,” the DEA reported in its 2016 National Drug Threat Assessment.		So instead of a wall, better screening technology would make sense
@_Jrlh_ @KellyMabry9 @APDW4MO @GOPChairwoman Well that's a silly conclusion to jump to. I proved that the use of statistics is flawed when you incorporate irrelevant data in an attempt to bolster a claim. Then I made mockery of the Republican small-government, fiscal-responsibility lie.

@KellyMabry9 @APDW4MO @GOPChairwoman According to CDC data (below), about 17k of those deaths were prescription overdoses.

@realDonaldTrump That's because the, "with victory" part is a lie. If you said, "I'm bringing our great troops home because I need a political victory but we totally did not win the tenth Crusade," you'd have at least got a shrugging nod from the grown-ups in the room.	Also, #TrumpResign
@realDonaldTrump So, about 115 years ago, these two brothers from #Dayton, Ohio, invented this whizbang gizmo that can defeat even the most "strong and powerful wall." I know you're familiar with it, since one of your failed businesses used them you even have one that we pay for: #ConAirForceOne

@realDonaldTrump If Comrade @BrianKempGA secure border and support Red Ar... Er... American Army, he is welcome addition to Central Committee... Maybe one day, Politburo.	#MAGA https://t.co/GgoegoKc0U
@GOP It may be irresponsible, but @TheDemocrats still let you play your game when you insisted on doing the same dumb shit; only seems fair.	There's also the part where @BarackObama wasn't being investigated for crimes that might end up before #SCOTUS like our dear #ComradePresident.
Yeah... I'm sick of winning...	#SoMuchWinning https://t.co/4NA2R3AdKX
@GOP @realDonaldTrump So... we're pretending that @POTUS @realDonaldTrump didn't throw the US under the Soviet Tank today? Is that what we're doing?		Neat.	#MAGA https://t.co/tSmJFGfOS6
@RepLoBiondo In all fairness to @realDonaldTrump, it's really hard to call your boss out as being wrong/responsible, especially in a public setting.
I don't see why #TrumpPutinSummit is such a big deal. I would hope the person driving US Foreign Policy would meet regularly with his key staffers, like @PutinRF_Eng is doing with @realDonaldTrump.	It's all pretty standard, really.	#TreasonSummit https://t.co/YgvuREVhu8

Would doing so make you a #patriot for doing what you thought necessary to defend your beliefs, or a #Traitor? https://t.co/UndVQzbwGQ
@DANorris74 @alllibertynews @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump No way, Top. Democrats are just as bad as Republicans. 	But @realDonaldTrump is a special kind of stupid, though. 	Like, box of grid squares, can of blinker fluid, 2LT with a compass level stupid.	Most important: a threat to the democratic republic you &amp; I both served to protect.

@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump Neat. Well, I hope all that coalition building works out for you, and you get the changes you hope for are achieved. I'm going to go ahead and enjoy the rest of my lunch, and keep trying to build a coalition without the cancerous segment that supports hate. Cheers
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump He's just the culmination. The event horizon from which I see no return.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump It must be frustrating trying to bait someone who doesn't respond to it, huh?
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump Like, more chill than I've been through this whole exchange? I mean, the neckbeard comment were fighting words, but somehow I managed to endure.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump "Again" implies that I was once a registered Republican. 	*I* refuse to enable.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump I understand that, truly I do. But if no one ever raises an unpopular opinion and fights for it, then all we sheep get is what the shepherd gives us.		And if you can tell me where that bridge leads, convince me that I need it, &amp; offer it at a fair price, perhaps I will buy it.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump I may lose every single time, but I will never again be an enabler of such madness.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump No. Not anymore. Not if the current outcome is what such a coalition leads to. Coalition is the wrong phrase: unholy alliance. I will exist in the netherworld of irrelevance before actively enabling the country I went to war for to disgrace itself further.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump My opinions aren't popular.	...	...	Phew, I was afraid my head would pop there for a second.		Now that's out of the way, those opinions are mine, based upon contemplation, reflection, and study. I refuse to be complacent with being fed shit and being told to like it.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump Fair re: elections; not a great record there. 	Maybe if someone were to encourage those who lean closer to #libertarianism than to the rotting remains of the @GOP to finally jump ship, maybe we can change that. 	I'm tired of settling for two *viable*, yet wholly awful options.
@ShawnBuell79 @RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash @GOP @realDonaldTrump I'm glad I've brought a smile to your face. We need more smiles in the world.	But really? Neckbeard?
.@RandPaul @AP4Liberty @JeffFlake @justinamash &amp; other #Libertarians in the @GOP: it's time.	Under #Trump, the #GOP has become a bastion of hate. When I can't vote L, my R/D vote% is ~50/50.

@AP4Liberty C'mon, AP - you've got to do better at connectong the dots.	@realDonaldTrump wants the #SpaceForce since he can't get #theWall.

Just "The @Twitter Rules." I was intrigued by the #AbusePolicy. 	Eagerly awaiting the suspension of @realDonaldTrump account for "behavior that crosses the line into abuse, including behavior that harasses, intimidates, or uses fear to silence another user’s voice." https://t.co/WEycg8gCt7
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Have you so little control over your DOJ that they won't tell you? Was @BarackObama so much better as being president that the agencies are still loyal to him? Sounds like you have incredibly poor leadership skills. Why don't you strike one of your famous deals?

.@nflcommish @NFL: when you fine players for #kneeling in peaceful protest... where does the money go? Maybe consider donating it to a #charity that protects #CivilRights. That would at least make it *seem* like you understand why they're protesting. @NFLprguy #BLM #TalkingPoints
I'm all for a free market &amp; letting bad businesses fail, but @RegalMovies @AMCTheatres @Cinemark &amp; other #Theaters: if you don't find a way to help @MoviePass become profitable (like w/tix prices), I wont be able to spend $45/wk on $0.45 worth of popcorn &amp; @DietCoke. Your call.
@VerizonSupport so... How do I cancel my voicemail? The only people who call me &amp; leave vms are robocallers from verizon numbers that cease to exist 2 mins after they call. In fact, 99/100 calls are robocallers. I want them to believe my number is disconnected. Help me out here.
@RepAdamSchiff So... Release them. You're an elected official, do something worthwhile with your responsibility.

@BlakeChasteen there's merit to that, but the Dems are tough to watch too. I'm an Ind, because I don't want to be half wrong all the time.
