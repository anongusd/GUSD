@BarackObama @SenatorReid #negotiate #endtheshutdown #openthegovernment Divided government requires compromise.  #LetsTalk
Aug 2011:  Obama/Boehner agree to $1.2 trillion in savings in the Budget Control Act.
March 1996: Bill Clinton/Newt Gingrich agreed to congressional review act for regulations, social security reforms and small biz reg relief
November 1990:  George HW Bush and Foley agree to 13 major domestic program reforms and discretionary spending caps as part of debt limit
Nov 1989: George HW Bush and Speaker Tom Foley agreed to repeal group health insurance requirements and spending reductions in debt limit
September 1987: Reagan and Speaker Jim Wright agree to budget process reforms and spending reduction in conjunction with debt limit vote.
Debt limit deals over the past 30 years:  December 1985: Reagan and Tip O'Neill agree on deficit targets, sequestration.
Truth:  Every major effort to deal with deficit reduction over the last 30 years has been tied on the debt limit.
Fact check: Obama claims that Republicans demands for spending reforms tied to the debt limit is unprecedented.

The Department of Defense &amp; Veterans Affairs are in the process of removing SSNs from 18 million beneficiaries‚Äô cards by 2016.
In 2007, President Bush‚Äôs Identity Theft Task Force found that SSN is ‚Äúthe most valuable commodity for an identity thief."
In 2008, the SSA Inspector General recommended that the SSN be removed from Medicare cards
By removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards we are eliminating an unnecessary risk facing millions of American seniors.
By advertising SSN's on Medicare cards, seniors are threatened w/ risk of identity theft &amp; it leaves program exposed to  fraudulent activity
There are nearly 50 million Medicare cards which currently display Social Security numbers.
The House is currently debating the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2012. Legislation I am proud to co-sponsor and support.

US has been a manufacturing ldr & can become one again by creating an environment  for businesses to thrive & grow
Appreciate the tweet of support! @jonathanrobles
My GOP colleagues & I in the House have been hard at work passing legislation that will give businesses the certainty to hire new employees
Govt should enact policies that allow and encourage businesses to grow and expand, rather than stifling growth with bureaucracy & red tape
The bottom line is that a thriving economy comes from businesses and entrepreneurs, not from government regulations and mandates
The best way for Washington to spark job creation is to create an environment where businesses can thrive & grow
