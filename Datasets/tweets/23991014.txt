@joncoopertweets @realDonaldTrump Would really like some facts, and not merely your opinion.
@funder You are lacking in facts but plentiful with opinions.
@ColtsFan_Rick @Teclaur @SenWarren I know corruption is normal, it's just sad we have to make rules against it.

Where is the Democratic outrage that a future Democratic Presidential candidate makes inaccurate and personal attacks and comments? https://t.co/2aYLawqTEV
@SpeakerPelosi Uh....why start now?
@SenWarren It's sad we have to make it against the law or rules to be corrupt.  Seems like it would be already understood and people would not be corrupt normally.

@funder You never worked in prison did you?  We used vulgar language in our work day, but never in public or when talking with public. Private conversations are one thing, public setting whole different arena.
@AOC It is my opinion a major difference between when he wasn't President, which doesn't excuse his behavior, and now when he is President. You and your "sister" are now Representatives and should act like one.  And no I don't care about past dancing.
