@united Thank you. It’s already frustrating enough being delayed, this whole travel experience has been a nightmare. I appreciate your response and understanding, though.
@united I didn’t get her name, but it seemed very unprofessional. Apparently there was something that could be done because she made a call and allowed them to be scanned at another belt at the spirit counter. It took the other passenger being persistent for her to even budge.
@united She said “they don’t work overtime” and they had closed at 9:30. It was 9:33. And our flight doesn’t even leave until midnight. Ridiculous.
Wow me &amp; another passenger almost just got screwed. Our flight is delayed FIVE HOURS, and gate agent almost refused to check our bags &amp; said there was nothing she could do bc there were no employees to scan them. she was RUDE about it. Worst customer service ever! @united

@b_sierraaa Girl lmao I feel you, I hate living in CA.. idk why I love the Dodgers. Prob bc of Clayton Kershaw.. who’s from Dallas.. so it kinda counts?
@LiamBarbwire Yes it will be! It can’t come fast enough!
@LiamBarbwire Mine finally switched to being shipped! lol
@b_sierraaa How houston acts towards the rangers during the regular season...it drives me crazy! maybe I’m just being petty 😂 I do love the Dodgers tho
Poor darvish - these memes are out of control 🙈
If it’s a DFW based team in the World Series, Super Bowl, finals, etc. do you root for them? #astros #houston #texas
To my #astros fans, congrats on a well-played Series. I do have a question/poll for y’all though - may affect how I cheer in the future 😅 :

2. The Dodgers have always been my favorite NL team. And I love Clayton Kershaw so... let’s go Dodgers.
People ask me why I’m not cheering for Houston. 1. As a Rangers fan, that’d be like a Red Sox fan cheering for the Yankees.
I’m glad I have homework because I can’t watch the rest of this game lol 🙈
All we can do is get his pitch count up and get into their bullpen
Finally a call that was even 👏🏼
Are you kidding me?  Make even calls, ump. What was a Strike for Verlander is a ball for Hill. Ridiculous.

@afrommi @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC No you’re right, Fox News is talking about Oprah running in 2020 🙄 they were talking about PR like 10 minutes ago
@afrommi @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC They just switched to PR (which is definitely more important) than what they were talking about.

@Correa24 @EmilyJonesMcCoy I get that, but he's a kid. It's just a ball. At the end of the day, it would be more impressionable on the kid. Just saying - my opinion.
