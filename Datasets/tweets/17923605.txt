@PeteBeu neat. thanks. and if I damage my cheap watch? no big deal.
@looplooks I've gone there, they charge $10/watch. I have like 5+ watches that need new batteries. Maybe it's time to buy a watch worth this
@NotAPreppie In some cases it might be cheaper to just get a new cheap watch. Or, uh, buy nicer watches. Like a "real" adult.
@looplooks I recently asked at the West Loop Target and they said they don't replace batteries. bummer.
@looplooks years ago, I had the batteries replaced at a Target (in the suburbs) and they only charged for the price of the battery ($2-3).
Is there anywhere to get a watch battery replaced for under $10/watch? All of my cheap watches have dead batteries.

@mtommasi at least that's my opinion. I also use a company-issued phone and they give us iPhones.
@mtommasi Now that any app worth using is avail on both iPhone &amp; Android, all that matters is will the phone last until your next upgrade
@ourmaninchicago I think Chicago handled our blizzard so well because it hit on a Sunday when most folks could stay home and off the roads.
@mtommasi The only time I've been unhappy with an Android was when I picked a cheaper model that started crapping out after a few months.

@looplooks put a piece of white paper or white sheet behind the item. I remember seeing a How To on Pinterest for creating great still shots
@looplooks Cycle Finder is realtime. I've refreshed it immediately after I've checked out or docked a bike and it updated.
@CompilationTape I've heard some couples shower together for that very reason. Only way they can have conversations with each other.
@looplooks for what kind of photos?

@scottkleinberg not stuck, just passing by while I was looking out the window about 10 mins ago to see what was going on.
@TheAngryRunner YES! Totally agree. That's what bothered me about the SELF thing, it was very Mean Girls, woman-on-woman hating. Never cool.

@TheAngryRunner also, Fashion Police et al never claimed to help you live your best life or whatever positive BS SELF put out there.
@TheAngryRunner I don't mind red carpet snark that isn't personal. the SELF magainze thing seemed to be a low blow IMO.
