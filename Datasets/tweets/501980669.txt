@TaritaC @onederwood @_EthanGrey @soledadobrien @BernieSanders Really? HRC never fired the guy she knew was harassing, Kamala paid hers off, they both have issues with justice. You have some blatant bias going. Enjoy your bashing I hope it all works out for you.
@TheNewCivility @HowardSchultz If as a society a better life can be easily provided it is better for people, community, country. EVERYONE has struggles &amp; works hard, why should the goal be to make life harder when we can come together &amp; make it better for all? Misery does shouldn't be required to prove value.
@TheNewCivility @HowardSchultz Life is hard regardless &amp; yes opportunities have diminished for some generations due to inequality &amp; shit policy. If investing in people is proven to work &amp; make lives better it should be done. Everyone has a right to live without constant worry for basic neccesities.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz It would have been a net loss for the taxpayers to have Amazon come in just like Walmart does, the Foxconn deal, building stadiums for sports teams etc. Business models that require taxpayers to subsidize their profit margins are leeches, corporate welfare queens.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz Socialism in a pure form hasn't been  implemented ever, it has always been undermined for capitalism. Forms of democratic socialism have worked in the US and abroad with great success &amp; greater equality, capitalism is by design unequal &amp; exploitative. Mixed economies have worked.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz Capitalism absolutely destroys social programs when resources go uncollected &amp; what's left is redirected to corporate subsidies, for profit war, healthcare, education, prison system, disaster relief, etc.	Why shouldn't equality be a right? Why shouldn't we invest in citizens?
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz So you've never lived in poverty, or even really seen it. The greatest wealth to very few hands which caused massive inequality in income, a volatile economy. Government can invest in people &amp; when they do it creates wealth &amp; a stable economy.
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz The ACA was a bad plan but deductibles &amp; premiums would be rising anyway because we are the only industrialized nation with a for profit healthcare system. It costs less to cover everyone &amp; provide better care with single payer.
@scwilson5804 Where? An average in Mississippi or Minnesota? We should just move right? There's opportunity everywhere,  we just aren't looking, aren't trying, bc nothing changed since 76 only a complete shift in policies to become an extraction economy instead of a stable labor one.
@scwilson5804 Really they get to negotiate when Amazon &amp; Walmart actively work against unions? I blame stubborn ignorance to why we got here, your self righteousness &amp; inattentiveness fucked the future generations, great work. Keep your head in the sand &amp; enjoy yours, no one else matters.
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz That's not enough to live on to pay rent, eat, have healthcare, transportation, education, save for retirement. There are no pensions, health deductibles are $8000 &amp; we pay a $700 plus monthly premium. Public transport won't get you to many jobs, a 1 bed apartment is $900.
@scwilson5804 How much did you have to work to go to college, it used to be a part time job. Now community college is 12k in tuition &amp; fees alone, they pay $9 an hour. Every one works hard but the economic situation has changed and you won't aknowledge it.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz Without unfettered capitalism, without a political system that can be bought we have had more social programs, more equality, more investment in communities, in people. We have done this &amp; destroyed it by letting capitalism run rampant without regulation or consequences.
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz For profit prisons are capitalism &amp; they are enslavement to the state, jails easily filled through poverty. There is no commons, no community, no greater good in unregulated capitalism which is where we have moved to. Workers should own their labor to equalize power.
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz It ain't been done. Capitalism is about ever increasing profit while reducing costs, there is zero human consideration in it. You can teach someone to fish but if all the fish are hoarded in few hands most people starve.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz Take a look at the net worth of every member of Congress, how long they have served, how much that net worth increased in that time, who their donors are, where their investments are, how they vote on policy &amp; come back about one of the poorest members of Congress.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz Tax breaks are money given directly to the corporations. They don't need the tax breaks, they don't invest in communities, they buyback stocks &amp; inflate value while paying shit wages that have to be subsidized with healthcare &amp; food. Why don't you understand this?
@scwilson5804 You do realize that inflation counts. Yes they earn more but pay more hence are not better. When did you last get your stats in 1985? People are mired in student &amp; medical debt, unable to buy homes, have families.
@scwilson5804 I ain't jealous &amp; you don't give a shit about the struggles or what creates poverty. It has not lifted more people out of poverty, it has increased income inequality. When people won't learn, evolve, or even have empathy the world gets a little shittier, self involved, &amp; arrogant
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz Wow,  you're an asshole that likes to belittle &amp; devalue other people,  their ability, and their work. You are why inequality soars. So you believe in a society where people can be judged as less than and they don't deserve a living wage, a life. Whatever makes you feel bigger.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz No, Bernie does not. LOOK outside of US exceptionalism propaganda to see how other economies work. Pure socialism has not been done it's always undermined. Mixed economies with socialist &amp; direct democracy aspects have been with success &amp; more equality.
@Frozen_Ps_N_Qs @HowardSchultz That's giving them money, giving a billionaire more money. They pay 0 in taxes yet use federal resources. That's giving them money.
@scwilson5804 Yes that's it, 2 generations of people doing worse than those before has nothing to do with changes in policy regarding labor, wage, education, healthcare, banking, monopoly, free trade, "free" market unfettered capitalism. Nobody understands making goals. I'm delusional, ok.

I did not take stronger interest in history until I lived  &amp; saw the difference in what I was told by those in power &amp; how it really plans out in the workplace and in retirement for most ppl.
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz They aren't socialist authors, they are history writers &amp; historical figures in labor rights, socialism, &amp; politics. It is a reality you're choosing to ignore in favor of propaganda &amp; ingrained bias.
@Row_Boat_Cop @Ange_Amene It was in the 90s but in the works before. There is a direct correlation between undermining unions, NAFTA, the WTO &amp; the timeline of outsourcing &amp; decline in manufacturing.
@knitbunnie @Ange_Amene I don't want 45 but that's what we will continue to get with status quo. People have been struggling &amp; it is being ignored by establishment 3rd way representation imo. At least we have the same goal of wanting better for everyone,  as long as we get there.
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz I'm older so I like the books &amp; library.	I see people working hard, production has steadily increased but wages haven't, people can't work hard enough to meet the rising costs. I think we deserve better than   what we've been getting the past 45 yrs
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz My local librarian started me off with Subterranean Fire by Sharon Smith, from there I found Eugene Debs, Floyd B. Olson, the Wobblies. It's a much more detailed history than the post WWII propaganda.
@Jaque_LeCaque @HowardSchultz Yet 75% of people work for someone, small biz can't compete with monopoly, income inequality soared while labor rights have been lost. Socialism has been undermined but the parts that get through are successful for more people to have equal opportunity.
@Row_Boat_Cop @Ange_Amene It was the combination of consumer &amp; investment the that directly caused it because it gave investment the consumer funds to gamble with. NAFTA was the basis for free trade agreements that has outsourced jobs worldwide. Were you even in the US since the 80s?
@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz 99% of people are just jealous or lazy,  that's it. Your history on socialism &amp; information on the economic structures outside the US is woefully outdated. Ask your local librarian for recommendations, I find they are a great resource.
@knitbunnie @Ange_Amene There isn't a perfect candidate, I can write a list too. There are however a few with consistent policy that will help people, that actually puts the foot work in &amp; doesn't cater to big $. I think pandering for votes, or saying we don't deserve better is more assholey.
@Row_Boat_Cop @Ange_Amene Are you joking? Manufacturing disappeared specifically bc of NAFTA &amp; "free trade" for US while every other country maintained a VAT tax to protect manufacturing. 2008 crash was a direct result of the loss of Glass Steagall, deregulation &amp; not enforcing anti trust.

@Row_Boat_Cop @Ange_Amene In consideration it was for more people. All goods used by gov were to be manufactured in the US a policy unenforced after NAFTA &amp; "free trade", blew manufacturing in the US. Anti trust not enforced, Glass Steagall dropped, unions &amp; labor rights undermined.

@XtamerlaneX @HowardSchultz You're welcome.
@knitbunnie @Ange_Amene There are fundamental differences you obviously are not willing to objectively look into. Surface level resistance doesn't do shit &amp; we all deserve better than superficial representation from top to bottom.
@Row_Boat_Cop @Ange_Amene Are we not still having issues from a recession? Are we not in multiple wars? Look at the evolution. Considering after WWII was the most prosperous time for all people, not just a few it would be a good idea to revisit the policy that brought that about.

@scwilson5804 @HowardSchultz Socialism is workers owning the means of production, democratic socialism is a societal choice to support each other &amp; those most vulnerable. Capitalism creates inequality &amp; oppression by design, particularly unfettered American capitalism.
@TheNewCivility @HowardSchultz That's not something people can just go do &amp; it's significantly harder now. Have you noticed some policy changes over the last 40 years? Lots of us have &amp; we deserve better.
@Ange_Amene Not by herself the 3rd way had &amp; still has a bunch of self serving politicians that fundamentally changed the party, many were unhappy it's why membership declined &amp; indepents are the majority of voters.
@Ange_Amene Can say the same to you but I'm not wrong, just offering a history lesson go check for yourself.
@AugustusTodd4 @Ange_Amene Yeah I got it. Enjoy your comfort, surface level insight. Makes it all so easy.

@SteelersGurlie @Ange_Amene Apparently you all do. DNC is a corporation, your interests, your needs don't matter, just your vote &amp; they will lie, cheat, &amp; steal to get it. Scratch below the surface on the history &amp; policy there.
@knitbunnie @Ange_Amene Your entire TL is Bernie bashing. Enjoy your vindictive agenda, some of us out here don't like how policy has hurt us &amp; want real representation. You don't even care, this is a game for you. This is our real fucking lives, our kids futures. 	You're a con &amp; just an ass.
@ClarenceMack3 @BernieSanders @HillaryClinton @DNC @shaunking Maybe he never joined because the dem party changed significantly with 3rd way and no longer held the ideals it had when it was a labor party. Many of us have left because of this. The majority of people are independent. Check the history of the dem party.  HRC was/is Republican
@Row_Boat_Cop @Ange_Amene No. I watched the evolution of the democratic party since the 3rd way &amp; their darling Bill abandoned the working poor, labor, the regular people to cozy corps &amp; wealthy. Compare policies &amp; effects from the depression to 2016. Russian bullshit  doesn't fly.

@Samwise_16 @HowardSchultz Opposing views?  None write their own course materials. If critical thinking is there the POV doesn't matter. Violence on campus isn't coming from politics. School has changed but I don't think you've kept up on the changes. I don't think you understand what tyranny is.

@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 Charity sucks bc jerks like you decide who might be worthy of your largesse. Why not just give people the opportunity to equally to access education &amp; or a living wage. Let people do the work they enjoy &amp; are able to do, that would make for a more productive society.
@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 There are no starter jobs. Not everyone has access to education or has the ability to do whatever job you deemed fit for them to deserve a life. Everyone even a teenager should have enough to live or save for education, a car, or just fun.
@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 No. I work in low income housing. Another area massively underfunded, but ya know people working hard, the disabled, the elderly don't deserve a home bc some bootlickers decided they don't work hard enough or have a prestigious job title so fuck em.
@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 There is actual legitimate medical reason for abortion. Not like your party gives a shit once a person (not a clump of parasitic cells) is born.	Forced birth with no support makes for a shitty life for all involved.
@Comrade_Star They ruin the ideals of feminism with their bullshit. People like this ruin any progress women make.
@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 So what happens to McDonald's when no one does that job, it's fucking hard work. Varied people varied jobs but they all deserve a living wage for the work they do. Corporations &amp; billionaires hoarding $ does nothing for an economy &amp; inequality makes an unstable economy.
@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 I'm going to make this country, MY country the best it can be. A country that invests in the people &amp; raises all people to the best most productive life they can have.
@partypete2017 @ethan_dewicki @mrsgordon586 @LynnS253 @EricShapiro3 Why should health care be tied to any job? It is a human right and really better for everyone to have access to healthcare. Do you bag on disabled people too? The TSA shouldn't even exist, it infringes on our rights. If you want an authoritarian country you should move.

@SilERabbit I don't believe a fucking word she says. She will say whatever you pay her to.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick You must have a great income since you ask &amp; receive unlike 90% there isn't a 1 bedroom within 20 miles of my job under $950. 50% is the norm now unless you are far rural which means no transportation, few jobs &amp; likely no internet at home.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick And 50k for a family of 4 is shit. Lucky but still shitty because it is paycheck to paycheck stress. Why doesn't everyone deserve enough for home, food, health, child care, ed, a car, a break once &amp; a while while some have more than they can spend bc of that 50k worker?
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Politicians throw money at nothing unless it serves their own interests &amp; that is their wealthy donors.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Trade school is great but only slightly less than community colleges. It can take yrs to pay back when you add health, liscense &amp;ins, rent is 50% of income now, you have to have transportation, websites, cell, equipment, tools.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Other countries &amp; the US have or has had policies that invested in people, community, &amp; did very well &amp; were very stable. It is capitalism &amp; greed that blows humanity every time. No one earns or needs billions or millions, they are hoarders drunk on power &amp; fine killing people.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick They have. I know it's not on MSM but there have been several strikes,  &amp; surprisingly bc they love the job regardless of being screwed they are asking students to be cared for 1st then a wage.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Why should I have to go into heavy debt to go get as shit wage. Loans are debt that cannot be erased per policy &amp; price has been overinflated to rob people. They don't earn shit, they exploit &amp; abuse their privilege to help themselves,  to monopolize, to keep people down.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Oh you wanna bet? Life expectancy going down. Over 50k die every year of easily preventable illnesses &amp; rising. That's bullshit. We pay more $ for less &amp; worse care. It is profit before health.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Actually most taxpayers would rather invest in universal health,  ed, infrastructure, etc instead of MIC &amp; subsidizing wealthy corporations yet we have a highly corrupted system hellbent on keeping it that way. Just fix that like your wage negotiation please.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick No it doesn't. Again everyone has value but cannot afford to wait for the right job, right pay, afford or has the ability to get those skills, &amp; they are fighting a system rigged against labor. Everyone deserves a living wage &amp; no one "earns" millions or billions.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick We don't have that in the US unless you meet 1962 federal poverty levels that haven't changed since &amp; don't include housing. For my family it is a 1k premium per month 7k individual deductible, 14k family. 3rd world has better healthcare.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick Really? You get to negotiate your wage? Where unless a CEO? Teachers make 30k to start &amp; loans or 60k plus. Dr is 56k 1st year with 300k in loans. This country doesn't value labor, it values wealth &amp; hoarding. There is zero interest in country, community, citizen.

@LOULOUGUINNESS @HootHootBerns I think many are but we have no voice or "value" compared to the money made in death &amp; destruction as well as the promotion of it. You are correct though that the years of propaganda have had their intended impact. Protesters get zero airtime here or abroad. US is funneling info
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick If you are doing the job for the sole purpose of food, shelter, &amp; healthcare it is by force. People are NOT inherently lazy &amp; willing to do reasonable work for a fair wage. It's not fair wages if it profits millions while employees struggle for basic needs.
@Swordofjanak @SpellNinja @GideonResnick YES! I'd be a hell of a lot happier at any job that gave me a life that provided outside of work. Even most working their dream job are pretty pissed about stagnant wages, healthcare tied to the job, &amp; if lucky sick or pto? We deserve better!

@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan They deserve a wage to exist because they show up &amp; make you $. They deserve a chance to contribute whatever skill &amp; be able to live regardless of your standard. 	No generation works as hard as you? Bullshit you had c students that could live.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan If you run a business where you steal all the profits of productivity &amp; expect everyone else subsidize your costs, you are the leach &amp; shouldn't have a business.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan So why does the employer deserve 300x as much as the labor that provides wealth? A living wage is not inflated worth, especially if that employer can't run the business without them. Everyone deserves a living wage regardless of your standard of worthy.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan People actually need that service,  as well as shit shoveler, fruit picker, cook, garbage man, artists, historians, launderer, Why are they undeserving of a living wage?
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan So let's kill everyone with a disability, a degree in art or humanities you don't deem worthy, your low lowly server, CNA, child care provider. You seem be the only stellar human in existence
@ElRayo76210 @jchutch2 @joshfoxfilm The majority of people work hard &amp; it doesn't pay off anymore. School is important but it doesn't mean you work harder &amp; not going doesn't mean you have less value so should not earn a living wage. Wages can vary but we all deserve basic needs met.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Untrue, everyone has value except to those arrogant enough to think they are better. Drain on economy is subsidizing &amp; hoarding of wealth, subsidizing corrupt practices,  selling publicly funded innovations or commons for pennies, the inanimate corporation, not the human labor.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Venezuela reveals you don't bother to question or expand your limited view. Literally every other response shows a complete unwillingness to attempt any other POV or critical thinking beyond yourself or your experience.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Actually there have been no truly socialist economies. Again you have put your own spin on earn. subsidizing biz, theft of resources, theft  of labor, outright slavery, inheritance, exploitation, bribery  who really "earns"? The speculators or the bricklayers?
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Go personal. You don't seem to be bothering to hear anyone else. I work &amp; even if my job was offering my "tart ass" to someone, I'm providing a service that is harder than many  "professionals". Demand creates jobs, my demand deserves living compensation.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan BULLSHIT. That is not the case anywhere in America. Name that college where it's 5k on a full schedule!
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan It is not communist or wishful thinking to believe everyone has value. Everyone has value even the person you deem less. They aren't less just different and deserve a life with basic needs met, they work hard, they have something to contribute.
@daveanthony Because losing pays just as well. Pelosi &amp; the majority of politicians don't give a shit about workers. It's a game on both sides and most of them can certainly afford the gamble, hell they get richer. The lives of workers is just a pandering tool.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Funny how when you look at history of labor rights, income inequality, etc, the general decline in every aspect of life is because 99% are lazy not because 1% is exploitative. I mean it's only been a struggle for thousands of years.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Seems to me there are people that had a very comfortable life with one job but ya know asking for better, the long history of people literally dying asking for a home life, a family,  a decent living are just lazy, &amp; unwilling.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan You were never a punk ass right? Never had goals, never cared about. A part time job doesn't pay for college anymore, pensions don't exist, costs have skyrocketed. People should be happy to work themselves to death. Nobody works as hard as you right?
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Age doesn't make you better or smarter necessarily, and as you have revealed some aging people never bother to learn,  evolve,  adapt, or even try to understand anything past their own prime time to understand the reality for people today.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Community college is $12000 minimum a year. Many kids are working to help family expenses &amp; save for a future.  Their ability deserves a living wage. Why is someone still getting an education less deserving if they work hard &amp; contribute?
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Each person has value and deserves a wage that pays for necessities like  food, clothing, shelter, healthcare &amp; in fact investment in those things are returned tenfold.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Minimum wage should be a living wage &amp; $15 doesn't coincide with inflation or inequality.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Well bullshit on income inequality, lucky sperm club or the ability to buy policy isn't talent or ambition it's luck. The American way has been quite socialist in some ways that are successful like fire dept, roads, unions, &amp; unsuccessful like subsidizing already wealthy corps.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Access to goods? Housing, health living wage, paid leave, equality, education, food. None of these are guaranteed. Earning? Income inequality, stagnant wages, outsourcing jobs, gig economy. Okay try reading past 1972 now.
@soundhound86 @joshfoxfilm @ThatChrisRyan Were you born in 1932? Times have changed .
@Alxandro @Justice10725446 @joshfoxfilm You sound classist &amp; ignorant.
@jchutch2 @joshfoxfilm Read any history or expand beyond a pie chart. If people just "work harder" it will totally even out.	The masses have just been collectively lazy since the dawn of time, there's nothing exploitative going on. Just hear me out &amp; try listening to the millions of laborers.

@dovesandletters @CNicPetrat I should have put religion in quotes. It is beliefs, tradition, &amp; way of life, not really an organized "religion".
@dovesandletters @CNicPetrat Actually both. There is no word for ownership of land. The attitude towards land ownership is absurd as it is your provider. Native religion is earth worship, it is nature based.
@charmcityvinyl @bourgeoisalien I get it but the policy the majority of Americans support is Bernie's and the older dem party values. I think the new liberals just have a bigger traditional media platform that largely ignores the regular folks.

@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton I'm genuinely curious what you think may work to help?
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Apologies the way it was used threw me off.	I wouldn't ascribe to one economic theory but I think history shows how the theories work &amp; don't work. Actually the high tax rate on $ over a  set amount did work.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton I agree the Fed is a major problem but so are the business models, the self serving representation that makes the rules and a winner take all mentality.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton This is true. But these boom busts have been going on throughout time. The corruption comes from too much $, too much power in too few hands. We can't seem to learn our lessons. We see it coming,  we tell &amp; scream but until it falls apart it isn't addressed.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton How has stimulating the already wealthy help? What are you referring to with "animal spirits"?	Government is going to be involved in an economy so what is the goal?
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Demand doesn't need "stimulation" it is cyclical in a stable environment. 	The only times demand needs a boost is when all of the money has been squirrels away out of circulation. Congress has been entirely corrupted bc they can create economics that enrich themselves.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Previous successes included breaking up monopolies to allow for competition,  a progressive tax rate that encourages investment &amp; expansion, an investment of the people's funds back into the people. 	Having the most $ isn't a win. Stability &amp; security is a win IMHO.

@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton The entire attitude for business changed in the late 70s. It became profit first, the business models without humanity continues. There are many factors that go into an economy, I don't think it should be taught without regard for impact &amp; consequences for humanity.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton I personally feel massive inequality is proof of failure in policy &amp; as a society. People can still earn a great living but not by exploiting others, your fellow citizens that are invested in country &amp; community as much as you. We are individuals but in this together still.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Keynesian economics is not fake. These economic theories have been put into practice throughout history  success can be measured &amp; improved but obvious failures for a nation have been beneficial for a few. It depends on what kind of nation you want.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Business expands when there is demand. People create demand. These bubbles happen because of monopolies, inflated stock value, corrupt banks &amp; corrupt business models. Check history as inequality booms the economy crashes. It is a pattern created by the greedy.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Working class spend every dime creating demand, a little more you expand demand bc people have $ to go out and on vacation. More $ than you can spend sits there doing nothing. A nation is people not just wealth. No economy with extreme inequality is stable.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton If a non corrupt government invests in people through health, ed, etc it comes back increased and supports long term stability. Supply side simply feeds money to the top where it is hoarded and left uncirculated creating highs &amp; lows based on speculation.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton The decline came with a Congress corrupted by money. We used to tax at a rate where businesses would reinvest &amp; expand instead of stock buybacks. Basic economy is demand based. Supply side, free market is a fallacy that has failed miserably.
@McResistanceD @iElijahManley Should people vote if they can, yes.  A concerted effort to corrupt checks, balances, policy for decades while we increasingly struggle to get by has soured people  on participating in a corrupt &amp; rigged game brought by those that are supposed to "represent" us.
@McResistanceD @iElijahManley The media at least MSM is a for profit endeavor of propaganda spouted by those in the same rarified wealth bubble. Very little in media resembles real life or even reflects on it.
@mtbaldhead @dannybaptista @JordanChariton Atlas Shrugged sucked. Ayn Rand was a sociopath living off the gov she so vehemently opposed. I'll read the history.
@McResistanceD @iElijahManley I think when they can they do but the choices suck. Not like anyone is making it easier to vote as the choices become more corrupt. When basic needs aren't met, then meeting those is the sole priority. They keep you down on purpose.

@scott_soulia @Im_honest_Are_U @IHave69cents @KiwiEV @Ocasio2018 @AmazingChevVolt I agree but we have to learn this &amp; have access to a variety of foods.

@BigBoyBobs_ @DefyMasters Also a person with a living wage or below puts every cent back into the economy, creates demand, creates stability. Unlike the hoarding &amp; buybacks that contribute nothing except chaos. Never has an increase in min wage tanked the economy.
@BigBoyBobs_ @DefyMasters Compared to cost of living increases $15 isn't enough. I work in low income housing &amp; rent for a 1 bed 20 miles from the city is $900. For most people rent is now 50% of income. Everything has gone up except wages. That means our kids r screwed, aging we are screwed.
@BigBoyBobs_ @DefyMasters The local community college here has a tuition at approximately $12,000 per yr. They pay $9 per hour. At 20 hours that gross is only $9600 a yr.  A student wage should pay for a chance to move up w/out debt or killing yourself. A state public is $35k a yr.

@ReallyRealDonny @chac65 @BethLynch2020 We qualified for expansion before &amp; it covered everything for $41 a month .A 75 cent raise kicked us out and plans on ACA were the same cost as employer so went with that.

@ReallyRealDonny @chac65 @BethLynch2020 Because it propped up for profit insurance, monopoly patents &amp; inc drug costs instead of starting an expanded single payer system on Medicare for all that covers everyone for less cost. ACA was designed to blow up at patients expense.

@TLAM59 @CodyOBr1212 @DonteStallworth Where is the common sense when the rehabilitation, the lack of prosecution of or even minimal accountability from war criminals has led to more wars, death, coups, regime change, occupation, cover ups, authoritarian policy, and massively bloated military budget.
@TLAM59 @CodyOBr1212 @DonteStallworth Absolutely.

@AndrewWeeraratn @profwolff @AndresManuelLo Agreed, it would be wonderful if this could be an example of triumph but history shows a triumph of the people is usually met with coups, regime change, occupation from the powers that be. I wish the people the best of luck in changing history.

@philosophrob Pretty sure Iran is just that the war criminals have had a boner for bombing them so long they have to seek medical attention which is unaffordable or finally bomb them which is super profitable.
@angiemndc Centrist Democrats moving ever right offering nothing but status quo while taking labor &amp; voters for granted have us trump.
@angiemndc @RareBlackBird The numbers work, more care less cost. Every other industrialized nation has had healthcare for decades &amp; tuition free college. Unrealistic is a stable economy based on status quo war for profit &amp; corporate rule with zero investment in people.
@angiemndc @kIsSeSpLuMs @TheDemocrats Untrue. Rigged primary, most popular politicians supporting policies the majority of Americans support.
@Criscollett @TheView @BernieSanders One of the main issues in his platform is income inequality. Bernie is one of the only people discussing policy regarding all poverty regardless of race.
