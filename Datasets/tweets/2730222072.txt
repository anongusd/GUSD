"He made sure, or he actually demanded, that we speak Spanish at home," @helenaguirrefer says about her father, a political exile who helped bring his family to Miami, FL. She says Spanish was a huge part of moving her career forward in media #TheHillLatina
Our first guest this morning comes straight from the White House: @helenaguirrefer is about to speak to the audience about her role in bringing President Trump's message to the Hispanic community #TheHillLatina https://t.co/qoWi71A6NX

"I think sometimes just bringing a little light..." @nancyroman1 says transparency can help patients make decisions without holding them unnecessarily accountable for certain medical decisions #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@EmilyG_DC says that greater price transparency is not the silver bullet for lowering costs. She says that only about 40% of healthcare services are actually "shopable" #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Healthcare on sight, access to perishable food on sight, and access to nutritional information on sight: @nancyroman1 on how we can work on prevention rather than pouring money into end-of-life care #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@EmilyG_DC says that it is possible to collaborate without merging &amp; Amazon is currently demonstrating that - although she and Cory Capps agree, "We have no idea what they're doing." #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@nancyroman1: "One of the problems with the current system is it has problems dealing with prevention." She says this is one of the positives of mergers for her: "Clearly there's an opportunity there." #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@BatesWhiteEcon's Cory Capps: "The anti-trust stove is less hot when it comes to lateral deals." Capps discusses recent mergers including stories surrounding companies such as Amazon and TimeWarner #TheHillTalksHealthcare
"In many cases it's our employer who does that initial round of shopping for us." @EmilyG_DC on how we access medical care: we shop for healthcare, not individual medical interventions #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Closing out today's event is our experts plane featuring @EmilyG_DC, @nancyroman1 and partner at @BatesWhiteEcon Cory Capps, joined by moderator @PeterSullivan4 #TheHillTalksHealthcare https://t.co/xtVAdnMTyZ

@DepSecHargan says we need to look at price and quality transparency to evaluate costs in the system and work towards outcome-driven procedures in healthcare #TheHillTalksHealthcare
"We're really looking for an opportunity, a platform, to do this work." @DepSecHargan "We're not trying to develop a government-devised solution for a government-devised problem," he said on public outreach. #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@DepSecHargan says we have a burden of regulation and too many agencies speaking to the exact same issue - that's where he would like to see coordination at a department level #TheHillTalksHealthcare
"We want to be able to enable helpful coordination among different players in healthcare to make sure the patients get the best care." @DepSecHargan on how we can coordinate healthcare to elevate the patient's needs #TheHillTalksHealthcare

Our last headliner this morning is @DepSecHargan of Health and Human Services, who is going to speak to how we can modernize the nation's healthcare system and adjust to changes as they come alongside partners such as regulators #TheHillTalksHealthcare https://t.co/SSnRGIXUcj
@RepGeneGreen says that if an employer covers an employee, it does no good unless they cover the rest of their family as well #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Question from the audience concerning the medical device tax which can hurt innovation and research - @RepGeneGreen: "In the House we voted that down in our committee... I don't want to stifle innovation." #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Advice for Dems trying to win states or looking at 2020 when it comes to the healthcare debate? @RepGeneGreen says that while Medicare for all and single-payer may be popular at rallies, any reform is going to have to pass through Congress #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@RepGeneGreen says the problem with ACA and healthcare coverage it provides is that all Congress has been able to do is keep it on the books even as it gets chipped away at #TheHillTalksHealthcare
RT @terrigpollock: At @TheHillEvents with @molliegel and @DrewVoytal hearing from @BillCassidy and @GeneGreen29 on the pros and cons of hea…
@RepGeneGreen has been listening to healthcare debate for 26 years. He says the leadership of the House dictates what gets the most attention and the opioid conversation currently dominates #TheHillTalksHealthcare
@RepGeneGreen on assessing mergers and acquisitions: "I'd like to see more expansive coverage of folks." He says employer-based coverage covers more people than the ACA can and that we need to find ways to expand that method of coverage #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Next up is @RepGeneGreen who as the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health is concerned with making sure the changing landscape of healthcare is patient-focused #TheHillTalksHealthcare https://t.co/tFJVHsOS01
"So that's why I'm so into this patient-physician relationship." Sen. @BillCassidy speaks to how physicians can use their expertise to promote better outcomes for their patients, especially when it comes to medical costs #TheHillTalksHealthcare

Question from the audience: Why is the cost of medication so expensive in the US compared to other countries? Sen. @BillCassidy: "There is no single thing which is driving up healthcare costs but on the other hand there are a lot of things on the margin.." #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Sen. @BillCassidy: "Congress can set up rules, but it cannot micromanage." He says pharmacists should publish the prices of medicine to make sure patients are informed before purchasing what they need #TheHillTalksHealthcare
"Hopefully, we grapple. I will say that to an extent, it has been lost." Sen. @BillCassidy on how we start to deal with this issue and bring power back to the patient #TheHillTalksHealthcare
Our first speaker this morning is physician and Senator @BillCassidy, a member of the Senate HELP Committee, who is using his position and experience to find ways to make healthcare more affordable while improving patient outcomes #TheHillTalksHealthcare https://t.co/dr0wMwO0l7
Sen. @BillCassidy says that the consolidation of insurers and hospitals leads to price rises for citizens on a budget who are spending more and more money on healthcare and less money on everything else #TheHillTalksHealthcare

Cont'd: other than white populations, Moussa says participation in clinical trials is less than 10% #TomorrowsAlzCare
Moussa discusses challenge of diversifying patients for clinical trials: Because of a lack of awareness and stigma, participation tends to be within a certain group of people...generally more affluent and have more [medical] access #TomorrowsAlzCare
Moussa: Clinical trials are taxing on people with #Alzheimers because they require a caregiver and a study partner #TomorrowsAlzCare
Moussa of @gumedcenter calls for a grassroots movement to fight #Alzheimers: "The reason we nearly defeated breast cancer is because all women came behind this cause. We need everybody in society to come out [to cure Alzheimers]" #TomorrowsAlzCare

Daisy Duarte on becoming an activist for Alzheimer's after her mother's diagnosis: "either you become a statistic or you take a stand. I didn’t think twice." #TomorrowsAlzCare

While smart technology is advancing, @real_djwilson says cybersecurity is a top priority: "there are people looking for any weak link" #SmartInfraFuture
.@kc_cio: federal government must be more active in promoting smart initiatives, but it "should not preempt us" and try to run the city #SmartInfraFuture
.@bpallasch: "The federal gov't. has not come to the table with enough money for infrastructure for about a generation" #SmartInfraFuture
Looking at investment, @bpallasch says gov'ts. must look at project costs for its total life cycle rather than initial cost. It may cost more, but Pallasch says this would improve project longevity #SmartInfraFuture
Privacy can be a concern to implement smart technology. @bpallasch says gov'ts. may be slow to adopt new tech because it is a new way of approaching problems. @AmalfiFranco emphasizes transparency w/ citizens of what data will be collected and why #SmartInfraFuture
.@real_djwilson discusses inoperability problem in tech, which upgrades every 18 months. Rather than changing hardware, smart cities need software updates to keep up with developing technology #SmartInfraFuture

.@StaceyPlaskett: VI has more bandwidth capacity than anywhere else in the US except for NYC. However, it can't be accessed because the cost of electricity is too high #SmartInfraFuture
.@StaceyPlaskett: Congress must fund infrastructure for VI to prepare for disasters. Major VI cities destroyed because roads weren't ready for hurricane flooding #SmartInfraFuture
Rep. Plaskett elaborates on damage: hit by 2 cat. 5 hurricanes. Both hospitals have been destroyed, clinic has been destroyed, most resorts will not open for a year and a half. 30% of the islands have power -- maybe power will come back by Christmas #SmartInfraFuture
