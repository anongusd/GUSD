@ChristineLSloc @tressiemcphd @pultuskpa I don't feel I'm wrong for reading "pub" as publish instead of publicize, if anything it would be the author's fault for not articulating. Still gross to beg for validation so blatantly. Just ewww.

@dclaytonbarnes2 @HoleLoverDL @TheMediaManiaxe @lincolnablades @TheCFullerton You know what would happen?  There would be frozen bleach on the ground where the attack occurred.
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless It's not because you just realized if you say yes then the story becomes highly improbable and if you say no then it was random?
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless Obviously he didn't since racism was the only factor at play according to you he would beat down the first one he came across.
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless So ur saying Liam couldn't find a single POC in a week?
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless Well actually simply being black was not enough of a provocation for Liam according to his statement it would require being black and starting beef. Both perspectives are wrong but they are not the same.
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless So it is your assertion that two magats were hanging out in -17 degree weather with unfrozen bleach and a rope looking for jussie to rough up in Chicago at 2am?
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless Jussie's story and the police reports combined with the -17deg weather, video and lack thereof, is what cast doubt on the story.
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless I'm not defending Liam. He wanted retribution and did not care to differentiate between the offender and a race,his only requirement to dole out that retribution was they start beef with him. that is wrong. That is not the same as someone being attacked with no provocation.
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless No people declaring it a hoax don't think it even happened or that it was a lovers quarrel. I replied with, paraphrasing here (this is an apples to oranges argument )
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless I didn't bring "random" into this ... OP did... I'm asking which scenario you are trying to apply random to. Liam or Jussie, cuz it seems like Liam but I'm not trying to assume what you mean. https://t.co/MZXCi4jaAq
@stfutaran @Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades I like to follow alt accounts.  They say the craziest shit.
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless You are applying random to which scenario?
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless While the idea of answering some sort of transgression with overkill is wrong there is at least some threshold that must be crossed to incite violence. Random = insanity  overkill = poor rationale. .. insanity = no fixing that   poor rationale = a possibility of reform
@ShebaofS @SirWruthless What is not digestible is the inaccuracy. None of liam's positions on this are acceptable. I disagree that wanting someone to start beef so you can beat them down and kill them is the same as random violence. Random violence is worse by far in this scenario.
@stfutaran @Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades a tendency toward or actual exercise of strong autocratic or dictatorial control.... yep
@stfutaran @Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades Sounds kinda fascist.
@stfutaran @Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades Why? Do I not have the right to point out the false equivalency?
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades I'm not bringing up the why...and again you are taking liberties with what he said. Small changes yes, but a much different meaning. Which is my point. Stop using poetic license to fuel racial division. Liam did not say he was looking for "any black to kill".
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades Post/tweet synonymous, unlike your assertions.
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades I'm not defending Liam. .. I'm questioning the validity of the OP
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades Wanting to commit a crime is not the same as a failed attempt, again false equivalency.
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades My apologies I didn't see that part hence my confusion as to how that entered the conversation . He was armed. But back to linguistics he wanted to, not trying to. There is a difference, one that can not be dismissed.
@SirWruthless Quote me where I tried to justify what he said or the idea of it.... you can use any of my tweets not just this thread... or anything you can find I said or did to support your statment.
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades We're in the weeds on this one but I will play thru anyhow since you are illustrating my original point of (You're taking liberties with language and misrepresenting the truth) he wasn't armed so what are you talking about?
@SirWruthless I would be amazed if people were objective. At what point did I attempt to justify what Liam said?
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades Ur gonna have to clarify.... who is armed trying to kill people in this scenario?
@Ledavincci @earthtoneone @lincolnablades But yet there is still a distinction between the two, so yes sometimes but no not always.
@nytimes Gonna have to have an @FBI investigation!
@earthtoneone @lincolnablades Literally "have a go at me about something, so I ca kill him" so literally not looking for unjustified violence but literally looking to deliver unjustified punishment.
@lincolnablades @Kaepernick7 Didn't he walk away from a contract with sf to go free agent? And then couldn't get picked up? Who's fault is it when he turns down offers because he wouldn't be a starter?
@lincolnablades No correlation in those two statements... Liam wasn't trying to beat up anyone randomly,  he wished that they would instigate a fight he would finish. Not defending Liam just pointing out how sloppy of an interpretation of the English language that was.
@ambertamblyn So even though he doesn't possess the skills to compete he says or does something that you approve of so you are willing to overlook his inability to preform in his job and assign him "legend" status?  You are what is wrong in this world.

Besides they weren't asking for forged or false info they have a reputation of accuracy &amp; are considered dangerous because what they release is legit

@JRobertSweany @Polychromantium Hey now...poly might have advocated for stabbing a white man but I didn't call her a racist.  Don't treat her like that I'm not preventing her from her opinion.
@Polychromantium That's sound advice for the 1800's
@Polychromantium All yours! Stay away from the blankets! And remember glass beads aren't worth much.
@Polychromantium All in all its not too bad, better than the 1800's

So that puts a little different light on the current incident. https://t.co/64ZhGQKvym
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano That's what he says with his words after the fact but that's not what his actions said.
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano To be honest if that were me @ 16 there would have probably been a fight I was too full of Test. And would not have dealt with someone challenging my personal space with a smile. I have native heritage on my mother's side and I still disagree with Nathan and his narrative.
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano Unfortunately that is the game when someone gets in your face, first to look away loses. So we are in complete agreement on every point but that. I ask you to put aside politics and look at it as a human interaction. You will see that kid is nervous but doesn't want to let on.
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano You see it as a sneer because of a hat. I saw a nervous kid with an adult in his face trying not to let on that he was nervous by locking on a smile and being very still. Which is a natural human response to a stressful situation.
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano Better question is why are people trying to doxx these kids? Do they deserve to be expelled and turned away from colleges? Is that the definition of what we strive to be in America?  Are we setting a standard for being better or ends justify the means?
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano We can't address the hypothetical. Only what actually happened. I would love to say Nathan walked between them to prevent an issue but his actions demonstrate the opposite.
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano Well we are on the same page there. So what prevents you from seeing Nathan as the instigator? The red hat in front of him?
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano This isn't about me. It's a conversation about being able to interpret a video accurately. P.S. I was fooled initially also and my first reaction was wtf is wrong with that kid. Then I got more information now I'm glad I held my opinions until I watched the whole video.
@ChasingOzPhotog @LorellLair Still pumping out that false narrative? Have some dignity and apologize for being that which you claim to oppose
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano It's not a game, cognitive dissonance is an issue that should be addressed.  But I understand that facing it is literally painful and most importantly you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. Have a nice day, don't get too dehydrated.
@PhilduranJ @frankdpi Lol @  PhilduranJ just as eager to block as hate I see. What's wrong? Too hard to argue with the truth? Just block the truth out, that will fix things.
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano It wasn't an insult,  cognitive dissonance is a human weakness.
@girlsreallyrule Note the use of the word "appears" you're writing this with the full understanding that you are pushing a false narrative that has been disproven.
@PhilduranJ @frankdpi Open your eyes, watch the video, Nathan was the instigator and the kids didn't react past a nervous smile.  Don't be so eager to hate.
@thehill Sugar hill gang was a bunch of posers
@KatieMarieDLS @Forrestman55 @Alyssa_Milano If you claim to have watched the whole video and still think Nathan was not the instigator then your cognitive dissonance prevents you from grasping reality. It also prevents anyone from taking you seriously.

@VVAmerica Since this story has been proven to be a false narrative and the video shows Nathan as the instigator in a situation where the kids didn't react past a nervous smile,  don't you think you should take this tweet down?
@ChrisCuomo We know the truth, we have seen the full video. .. why are you still pushing a false narrative?
@frankdpi I know you have seen the truth in the videos. Nathan absolutely instigated the incident in which the kids did nothing but nervously smile. Why are you still pushing a false narrative?
@MalcolmNance @Gillette https://t.co/NIS8HozoV1
@nativelawyer @lilrednacho Their outrageous behavior like .... not reacting past a nervous smile when someone gets in your face and beats a drum? I too was fooled by the way the story was spun at first. Now we know the kids had nothing to do with that situation.
@drbashir2018 Too bad the narrative presented here is not the truth. Nathan approached the kids, he was not surrounded and the kids were dancing with the drum chanting with the natives. It wasn't until he got in the kids face that they started to realize that Nathan was trying to provoke.

@benwa_d @TalbertSwan @atalanta44 @cdw021066 @blkth0ught They are going thru the same process that's why a physical check is not needed.  Different banks have different policies that doesn't make them racist.
@benwa_d @TalbertSwan @atalanta44 @cdw021066 @blkth0ught When I deposit checks with my bank via e-deposit it usually takes 3-4 hrs to accept the deposit and only gives me $200 until it is verified 2 days later up to 5 days for over 1k. Same security marks and scanners in play that you mentioned, 30+ yrs customer. Racist policy I know.
@benwa_d @TalbertSwan @atalanta44 @cdw021066 @blkth0ught Because our experiences were diff I am lying? With the same ease I could say the same of you The fact of the matter is you are trying to make a mountain of a molehill. I have had checks denied at banks for less than 1k because they couldn't get ahold of the issuer, cuz I'm white?
@benwa_d @TalbertSwan @atalanta44 @cdw021066 @blkth0ught That is not under contention, banks are much more wary of a non account holder and have called my employer to verify and there wasn't even any issues with my check. Banks are federally regulated. There is no trust or human emotion involved in such transactions.
@TalbertSwan @atalanta44 @cdw021066 @blkth0ught They tried calling the employer 3 times, he didn't have an account with the bank, it was in response to a recent increase in fraud at that branch. Since banks are not in the business of handing out money unverified It is a rational response.

@blueorange4life @SenateDems @SenatorDurbin Well I guess there goes your theory of "or anyone else to determine credibility" P.S. you just changed the accusation from sexual assault to rape and convicted him. Mark was the only witness according to ford and he said nay. Where are you getting these perjury claims?
@blueorange4life @SenateDems @SenatorDurbin Her witness denied that the party even occurred.
@blueorange4life @SenateDems @SenatorDurbin Besides the fact that your last response didn't make sense(far more of what?) We all watched the same testimony, unless you are claiming you have more right to form an opinion than I do. Ford couldn't remember 2 months ago much less 36yrs ago, she brought forth only an accusation
@blueorange4life @SenateDems @SenatorDurbin The fbi doesn't consider hearsay credible, only weak minds lacking logic do.
@nypost Is this professional journalism or a high school paper's first attempt?
@DearAuntCrabby Ur missing the point that the opposition to Kavanaugh is not the majority... so he is doing the will of the people. You can talk big and cuss all you want, it doesn't make you right. You will need logic and rational thought to sway voters, not creative writing and leaps of faith.

@honest_warrior @Daenumania @Brenter37 @TheVeganSociety I'm simply pointing out that it is not a self supporting system for complete nutrition without supplements therefore my evidence of risks to child development. Akin to the breastmilk/formula argument, natural sourcing of nutes are the key to development
@honest_warrior @Daenumania @Brenter37 Exactly my point... I shouldn't be shamed for not being vegan and @Brenter37 shouldn't be shamed for hunting the same way I am not shaming you for being vegan.
@honest_warrior @Daenumania @Brenter37 I know... that's my point. A strictly vegan diet requires supplications because the human body needs more than a strictly vegan diet provides... P.S. gelatin is most likely a binder component in your supplements
@Daenumania @honest_warrior @Brenter37 Unless you mean to say civilization has always synthesized b12 and injected it into animals. Your argument is not valid
@Daenumania @honest_warrior @Brenter37 Animal foods, including meat, milk, and eggs, contain B12 and are essentially the exclusive source of the vitamin in the American food supply¬†https://t.co/16QeQIar2K
@michellemalkin Duke lacrosse team?
@honest_warrior @Brenter37 Touche to we all die sometime, even though that is just a strawman argument. The answer is still no.
@Daenumania @honest_warrior @Brenter37 Besides the fact that your argument contradicts itself. Animals need b12 because they can't get it from the soil? Sounds like every vegan with a garden would be flush with b12?
@Daenumania @honest_warrior @Brenter37 That's a long no.
@honest_warrior @Brenter37 Quite simply can a strictly vegan diet support a healthy human life indefinitely without nutritional supplements?
@honest_warrior @Brenter37 According to the definition of ego it is a logical assessment. In turn I believe vegan is the most unhealthy dietary choice for most any human and I am also extremely concerned for any child who is forced to maintain such a diet. You worry about bears I will worry about kids.
@honest_warrior @Brenter37 I see I am the only one supporting the rights of any individual pursuit that is legal. I never attacked you for being vegan only pointed out that you will not wish extend the same individual rights to people you don't agree with.
@SenateDems So why didn't you stand with any of the women coming out against Clinton with sexual harassment or rape accusations?
@honest_warrior @Brenter37 I pulled the first one from Merriam webster, but either way you prove my point though you fail to see it... you assert your vegan status as an ego boost. You identify yourself by your dietary choice is my proof of that statement. Your hypocrisy is the point.

@AmStillNotYou this isn't 1776! But it didn't take long for them to start making regulations on immigration.
@AmStillNotYou a concerted effort of the left from day one to cause turmoil has been trumps issue
@AmStillNotYou to be exact... it's a temporary ban to give time to develop better screening. .. we don't share a border with any of them

@RachGiorgis sounds like voter suppression is also your inherent desire
@RachGiorgis and he says he wants to change it to a popular vote decision!  What more do you want?
@cmr4to it is the inherent desire of both sides!
@RachGiorgis I'd go as far as to say 50% of the people that vote might as well be voting for the Cowboys or the redskins
@cmr4to money and politics is peanut butter and jelly
@cmr4to doesn't have to be a bank. Chose any action that requires you to present id. .. is it oppression?
@cmr4to completely on point. How am I not?
@RachGiorgis ur end goal is big vote tallies for shite candidates. I did, I voted and talked to people. Everyone is tired of status quo
@cmr4to like politics isn't $? Where are u from?
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to I hope not! The last thing I would ever want is the most corrupt political dynasty in 30 yrs. That would b status quo
@RachGiorgis cmon! We get the shittiest choices time after time due to a fuked primary process and u only want to make  big numbers
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to that's it? You don't have a valid argument only an implied one.
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to not the first time.  And something he claims he wants to change despite the fact that he won that way.
@cmr4to @RachGiorgis how? There is no liability in voting?
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to if you showed id at the time of voting there would be no need for crosscheck
@RachGiorgis you are concerned about suppression? Can't see the forest for the trees. Take on a real issue like group thought primaries
@cmr4to @RachGiorgis is the bank oppressive because they make you show id even though u gave them much more info when you opened the acct?
@cmr4to no.. I'm on point. Voting is not a right... it is a privilege, one that you can lose. As you have acknowledged.
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to no! I'm sure there is more than 2 Jose Lopez in every state
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to it's common sense that you should prove who you are when you cast your vote. It's not repression just logical!
@cmr4to should? Or are eligible?
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to because it is a law in my state that I must have state identification. I show id to vote. I don't feel oppressed
@cmr4to really? Even felons?
@cmr4to were any closed? Or was it a budget cut being discussed then politicized?
@cmr4to who has the right to vote? Everyone?
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to you are dismissing the operative words... "can" is not equivalent to "is" besides now we r talking AK not AL?
@cmr4to ‚ÄúDespite what the Obama Administration claims, there were no driver license offices closed in Alabama. Apparently u didn't. Lol! C&amp;p
@cmr4to kid? Lol. Standard liberal.  Dismissive... while standing on a soapbox
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to @PtitsThompson @AriBerman nope just not naive... does everyone get to vote?
@cmr4to @RachGiorgis @PtitsThompson @AriBerman were you gonna post that link about the only dmv for hundreds of miles being closed?
@cmr4to @RachGiorgis @PtitsThompson @AriBerman no it's not. Only a perspective of entitlement could allow the idea that it is a right.
@cmr4to I disagree. .. I am equating following voting law to following any other law
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to @PtitsThompson @AriBerman voting is a privilege not a right.... just like driving
@cmr4to actually if we are discussing voting law we are discussing a legal matter so it is a lateral association
@cmr4to lol... like you won't get a criminal charge? Now who is in need of an iq test? P.S. personal attacks=logical fallacy exposed
@RachGiorgis @cmr4to @PtitsThompson @AriBerman does the judge care if you don't have a car and poor when he court orders appearances?
@RachGiorgis and I'm sure all of those qualifiers you mentioned will coincide with not knowing anyone going there for themselves?
@cmr4to @PtitsThompson @AriBerman great.  Then it should be in a newspaper. .. link please...
