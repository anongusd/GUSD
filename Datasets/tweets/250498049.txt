@steve_holder haha ya I moved on to bizarre foods... where they cook Harry the bunny.
The only thing well rounded about her, is her figure. Ouch bizarre foods...
RT @totalfratmove: Post-marathon hydration. #TFM http://t.co/njGwUxclx8
@steve_holder hoping for Harry but give me about 25 more minutes of premier programming, and I'll have an update.
Found Harry the Bunny &amp; the Rainbow Horse while channel surfing. Hey kids, I'm sorry but there's no such thing as a rainbow horse.
She said there is no time, house is on... Agreed. Everyone, hush.
Obvi. That's not even a word @murphy_1223 . Why don't you read a book oh wait here comes an elbow...
@murphy_1223 so fresh. So clean.
Had to let my mom know I was do e with Facebook... http://t.co/RaiTaiXUsP
@FSasujia yo bro, go fuck your sister.
I taste like green beans, really...? MAYBE IT WAS THE GREEN BEANS.
Good thing I brought the dogs inside, them bitches would have gotten wet.
It's fuckin gettin outside holy cow! ‚òîÔ∏è
I had know idea it was supposed to rain @murphy_1223, why didn't you tell me
Had to cover the grill. Ugh.. Rain rain, you here, to help me sleep, let's hope you...
What a beast. Little bad ass got the best of me. http://t.co/k4twzjTqGN
One paper plate. Using the resources. She knows, and so do I. http://t.co/oa8yGNijOO
Facebook done. Fuck that garbage.
Like, I'm so cool. If only they would have known it in high school I could have gotten them tickets to the after party...
A pair of 'yous... God I hate what she's done to me.
Hangin up another W. 5 straight, and today with Gordo driving the bus. Holland leads the league in saves at 6. #BeRoyalKC #Royals
Even when I hard close my alarm clock app it still goes off in the morning... Just can't get the hint can ya, bitch.
Looks like I'm at @PonDerek 's 200th follow. I expect all the fellatio and gentle good times a wild bee keeper can handle.
I wish I had more people to watch #Royals baseball with. Doesn't anyone truly care about what really matters?
Royals game starts at 1:10pm. Seats fill up fast, so get there early. That is all.
Ventura starts Sunday. Can we just skip to then?
"If her DNA was off by one point she'd be a dolphin", oh House, you sly devil you.
That's under the bed. $100 says somebody's gonna freak out when they wake up... http://t.co/5OdVwgd4J1
Roster math is hard... I guess that's fairly true but hey it keeps them guessing right? @JoshVernier http://t.co/snKB9TQhCr
House, "There's Waldo", inmate screaming during MRI from metallic prison tats.  "Keep him in there till you guys see it too...". Ruthless.
Maxwell playing anything but left (that's Gordo's), makes me smile. I don't know if there is anyone else as happy to play as him.#BeRoyalKC
I wish I missed her, really I do. But then again it wouldn't make doing whatever the fuck I want that much fun.
If only people on Facebook knew they were being unfriended, maybe they would stoping acting like FUCKING RETARDS. Good thing that's over.
House taking shots with an inmate. The methanol in the printer ink will mixed with the ethanol in the liquor... Just gonna pee it out.. Haha
Moose has a butter like swing that only knocks through grandmas cooking, and... Ricky Nolasco, Call him clutch. #Royals #BeRoyalKC
Mikey hit a two run dinger, and the boys in blue dealt it back to the twin cities after Vargas's 8 shut out. The ball is rolling. #Royals
12 K's over 8IP, jolly gee wilikers batman! Series sweep. #Royals #BeRoyalKC
Killed my first mosquito of the season. And so it begins.
Should have taken her on more dog walks, bitches love dog walks.

Who wants to go to pbar tonight?
I look down the street, and oh what do ya know, the trusty ole neighbors and your friendly 5-0! http://t.co/4hXm1y4sKU
63 pounds of pure ferocity. http://t.co/p18oAwB46O
I have yet to make it to the pillow, and it looks like the car across the street is being warmed up for the morning commute. Unfortunate.
Cherry's and Berry's, that was close. Hope she hasn't been drinking.
Well, at least there's baseball. And beer, can't forget beer.
7-3 putting up the W. Damn Esky, hands like silk! #Royals
And Gordo goes yard!!!! First homer of the year. Hands sting from clapping so hard. #Royals
Look at the kids face after Gordo slams into the wall with the catch. Got the feels on this one He's a Royal. #Royals http://t.co/jWAAruvcYe
RT @drewsilv: OK. https://t.co/8CaaM3Qivc
Moose knocks his first hit in 22 AB, better than Robin Ventura's 0-41 PA during his rookie season. Yost said it, bout to take off. #Royals
6 IP with 2 hits, Ventura KILLED IT, tonight!!!!! Jeeze... #royals
And the boys in blue put another W in the bag. Speed like the 80's and early 90's, not a lot of power. I like this. #Royals
Esky hoping for his first RBI this season... BAM!!!! Three run double. Royals lead it 4-0. Bottom of the 6th.
"To Moose. High throw but Hos is 6'4. They record the out. " Vargas is throwing 3 hit, shut out baseball after 6 IP. I like it.
Shields and Sale, a pitchers dual. Up next: a run scored?
Valencia is at 3rd today, giving Moose a rest. Already 0-2 at the plate. The third base curse continues.
Yes, I give you permission to accelerate into a turn, grandma...
Big game James takes the mound today and the White Sox are up for Sale. This will be fun.
Just beat Farcry 3. Eh. Anybody else as excited about Ubisoft's upcoming lineup, as I am? Watchdogs and The Division?
@steve_holder oh ya I saw the highlights. Talk about a nicely placed walk off dinger. "Just a bit outs- over the plate"
@steve_holder there is deep truth in your words. 0-15, it would've been like pitching to a pitcher. I'll take it though. Mr. Clutch.
"How good is it to be home?" 	"I like that, thank you fans."	Salvy's got a way with words, Royals win it 4-3.
Chen releases the opening pitch at 1:10pm, let the day begin.
That last twaught ( twitter thought ) was in poor taste, what was I twinking?
Alright I know you're all tired of hearing so much chatter. Bed time. I hope this MH370 flight lands soon, I'm getting air sick... Too soon?
If Toronto made fewer moves that a quadriplegic in the offseason, does Tamaks's win really count? Is that a little league win? Questions.
They used  swagger to refer to a white sock, notably Jose Abreu, do you hit him with a pitch or mow him down with 7th inning rakes?
Birthday this year. Just didn't think it would make it this year. Damnit if it wasn't  that little planet that could all over again.
Two utensils in order to piece together your PB&amp;J? I guess I do use a "pencil and and eraser" when I write a paper.
Yes I care about more than Royals baseball. The Cards lost in a Pirates rout and Yankee Tanaka picked up a win. Both a shame.
@steve_holder 7-5, so they won. I've gotta say I was pretty stoked. So ya there was that. Guthrie? Run support? Or Both?
Knock on wood. Ventura over Greinke. Doubt Ventura would complain about playing in the outback.
Even though I don't tweeter a lot, at least I don't just tweeter to tweet
Why do runners run on Gordo, why oh why?
Butler may have flew out as was expected (that or a double play), but wait. That 2013, .289 he's holding on to, that's for later...
@mutotuzea fuck you.
Friday may have had 40,103, if Saturday has less than 20k just wait those bandwagon "I've been a fan forever" fans will come out in the fall
"I shit on the toilet seat", no matter the tone they still proceed. Perseverance is an admirable trait.
If one drink is to many and 12 are to much, which hotline gets ahold of "someone who cares" if draino is consumed? That's who he asked for?
In town, staying with some friends. Mi casa es su casa? Or do I have to wear pants?
Tomorrow... Well I guess today, is Royals baseball, how does everyone else make it to sleep with out the same cheerful dream..? #BeRoyalKC
Watched a lady hobble to her car today. I was pretty sure she had to have the reaction time of a potted plant. Good thing she bought 3.
What do I have to do to find "haters"? From the looks of it, they make the best fans. So much chatter.
RT @totalfratmove: Taking things way too far to prove a point. #TFM
I wish my girlfriend was as beautiful as Kaufman stadium.
Do the Royals play today?
Was having the best dream I've ever had. In my life. Door bell rings. A package delivered by FedEx to someone who doesn't live here. Great.
Trucks rapidly flashing it's light at me while she's pointing down. Oh ya my lights. I just figured they were drunk since it's 2am.  So ya.
Ventura gets the start tomorrow. Pretty excited about that.
RT @jazayerli: Is there a way Ned Yost can call for a pinch-runner the moment the ball hits Billy Butler's bat?
Well royals lose again in walk off fashion, and butler hits into two double plays. So there is that.
RT @McCulloughStar: Billy Butler grounds into an inning-ending double play on a 3-0 pitch. So there is that.
Well opening day was...  How can I say, Royals didn't win, but hey I was able to find enough beer.
So if I'm at hooters and I don't like my waitress, can I switch tables? How do I go about this?
Alright, wings at home now on my way to hooters to do the same. Hope they're showing baseball.
I guess I'll watch the cards play now, that was nice Molina. Did you plan that? Cards lead 1-0.
First overturned call due to MLB's new instant replay, puts Braun out at 1st. Thank you MLB at bat, for that progressive update.
Well, that sucks.
@TheRealHos35 so where do I go for a haircut like that?
Castellanos goes for 2, Gordo says no thank you. Working for that back to back golden glove, I guess.
@McCulloughStar Salvy 3 for 3, lock his ass down. Once he figures out the US dollar exchange rate anyway.
Verlander walks in a run. Verlander, what is that? A country in Asia? Hmm...
Let's by a single and a bobble for it, Gonzalez. Verlander with the bases loaded.
2 for 2 with 2 doubles. Salvy's on par to hit somewhere around 323 doubles this season. I think.
Should be ready by the 4th inning. http://t.co/JNxohDWCcp
It's just a homerun everyone, shields knows that.
Kansas City. #BeRoyalKC http://t.co/SnP5ZEuIdr

Only 16 days.
6 IP 10 K's, 1 hit. Royals up 4-0 on 8 hits. Showing the cubbies why they call him big game. Oh and Johnny hit a 2 run dinger.#beroyalkc
@brittney_owrey so true.
The Braves go all in on Santana with a whopping $14.1mm... to match the qualifying. Makes it 4 in the first 57. Ok.
Whew 102mph, this kid's hot and with 6 K's. Moose goes the distance as well after Salvy sends one over the right. Game's still not over.
RT @McCulloughStar: He stuck with baseballs today. He is a man, not a Pokemon. RT @Brad_Hope: Would you say he threw 'fire' Andy?
@Kelsey_Dacus haha oh but you know I've gotta support my boys in blue!
J. Vargas with the Tuesday afternoon start.  Looking to throw another W in that bag of wild yet controllable pitches. I like what I'm seeing
27 pick offs, most of any active right hander. Ouch. Big games right for KC.
Big game James picks off cano in the 8th, for his first  pick off at first of spring ball. God I love it.
@peterkrause09 haha I'll agree
One of four to get 3,000 hits 300 homers and a career .300 batting average, anyone who knows baseball knows this but I think it's neat #GBKC
Three batting titles, in three different decades.... George Brett's pretty neat, and the only one...?!!

Mariners fall to the Royals, and moose keeps up his roll. Let's hope this isn't just a spring training flame.
