Discuss corruption and unscrupulous behavior you witness in real time via public forum (like Twitter), so others around you can connect patterns of behavior, empathize, and combat these behaviors as a group. More time that passes = more time to modify/erase the truth.

The longer you wait to make me a public figure, the more time you give others to steal all my ideas and modify them to suit their own needs.
Ideally, I travel the country with as many families as possible hosting my stay. We exchange ideas, stories, indoor/outdoor activities, media, business goals, gifts. I make money at events, or performing labor. Offer me a bed for the night, a female as well.
Plus, food is an important part of everyone's life, giving me valuable information about your family. Break bread with me. I will understand better your growth, habits, culture, chemical makeup, moral fitness, movement of resources, language, evolution..
You really need to start talking to me in public and inviting me over your house. The best way for me to analyze society is by breaking down millions of individuals into family systems.

@ShafUnlimited What are your thoughts?
@ShafUnlimited Then addiction can become wreckless behavior because you are so far from center, so stressed from manipulation, incapable of entering new relationships and supporting yourself financially that you turn to narcotics as a means to feel some semblance of happiness. Trust is broken.
@ShafUnlimited Then you alter the supply of drugs to change their behavior, ruin their social relationships because noone around them wants to get busted or be a snitch. You slowly mess with their financial means to purchase drugs and pay bills that they normally would afford. Downward spiral..
@ShafUnlimited This is how our society operates, because it is a profitable enterprise to involve so many people and then gain a bonus from a bust. The person is likely too use again, because narcotics do have a medicinal aspect if used correctly, so the profits continue.
@ShafUnlimited Then you speak to their family, friends, coworkers, and neighbors behind their back about their performance, and encourage them to participate in the quest to bring this person down by any means as a lesson. Blame it on the drugs, but leave them alone when they do not use.
@ShafUnlimited I think it is too easy to abuse mass surveillance, using circumstantial evidence to fake abuse; especially when you know when someone is using on a work night and can apply extra pressure on them the next day while 'investigating' for potential crimes.

When are vehicles, especially electric cars, going to start using solar roof panels to maintain battery charge, or supplement interior electronics like the radio? Put a rechargeable lithium ion behind that in-dash on trickle charge and tailgating just became an all nighter.
Pay me if you figure out how to make this work. Hard part is making the electromagnet powerful enough in a small size. Magnets fascinate me; maybe there is a chance. A turbocharger can be utilized with this design to increase efficiency of forced air induction. No detonation.
The idea is that every time the electromagnet fires it repels the piston into the power stroke. This negates the need for a fuel system so valves stay clean, weight is reduced, maintenance is reduced. It is essentially a zero emission electromagnet air pump.
I have an engine concept in my head where you start with an internal combustion engine, then replace the spark plugs with an electromagnet that fires in time with compression stroke. Next, replace pistons with a similar design piston that has a permanent magnet crown.

If we wish to improve the treatment of women in our society, we can begin with the way sexual relationships are portrayed in the porn industry. Next, stop insinuating that alcohol is a prerequisite to sex in the majority of tv/movie sex scenes.
Being single is the worst when horny. I normally just give females their space out of respect. Literally any girl that talks to me has advantage over any other girl, because others are waiting for me to say something, I guess? Who knows anymore.

If computers resemble the human brain, I'd say it is time for a quantum leap. Processing all the intricacies of the infantecimal decimals between 0 and 1. Humans don't have time to wait on shitty, slow politics anymore. The planet is dying. Wake the fuck up. Turn off your ego.
Gravitate towards the center of the spectrum, instead of choosing between polar opposites. Choose between multiple individuals, not only one party or the other. Decide based on human progress as a species, instead of arguing who deserves blame. Too many clowns causing friction.
