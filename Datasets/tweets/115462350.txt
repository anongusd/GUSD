What are your thoughts on the statements given by President Obama and Speaker John Boehner today?
President Obama has ended his press conference.
Obama: I'm not budging on the full faith and credit of the United States.
Obama to Boehner on 2011 financial crisis: You should've taken the deal I offered back then.
Obama says he won't "gut" Obamacare.
Obama: We've got to break these habits and get back to the point where everyone understands in negotiations there is give and take.
Obama: I know the American people are tired.
Obama: What people ignore is that ultimately what matters is what people who are buying treasury bills think.
Obama: My message to the world is the U.S. has always paid its bills and it will again.
Obama: What we're asking of the Republicans is to keep the gov. open at funding levels that Dems think are very harmful to the economy.
Obama: I've shown myself willing to engage all the parties involved...every leader on any issue.
President Obama is now taking questions.
Obama: Let's drop the gimmicks. Let's focus on what's good for the American people.
Obama: Whenever we do these things, it hurts our credibility around the world. It makes us loom like we don't have our act together.
Obama: We can't afford these manufactured crises every few months.
Obama: In an economic shutdown, every American could see their 401k and home values fall.
Obama: Debt ceiling does not increase our debt. All it does is allow the Treasury Dept. to pay for what Congress has already spent.
Obama: "As reckless as a government shutdown is, an economic shutdown caused by America defaulting would be dramatically worse."
Obama: "Let's end this shutdown right now. Let's put people back to work."
Obama: The WH, Senate Democrats have shown willingness to negotiate.
Obama: Senate Dems have asked to sit down with House Republicans, but have been rejected 19 times.
Obama: "Let's lift these threats from our families and our businesses and let's get down to work."
Obama: Members of Congress don't get to demand ransoms in exchange for doing their jobs.
Obama says he spoke with Speaker Boehner about the shutdown today.
President Obama will take questions from reporters.
President Obama will begin his press conference any minute.

Obama: Our ideals and principles, as well as our national security, are at stake in Syria.
Obama: The burdens of leadership are often heavy.
Obama: U.S. military will be in a position to respond if diplomacy fails.
Obama: We will continue to rally support from allies.
Obama: I have a deeply held preference for peaceful solutions.
Obama: We don't dismiss any threats.
Obama: The U.S. military doesn't do pin pricks. Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver.
Obama: I will not put American boots on the ground in Syria.
Obama: Many of you have asked, "Won't this put us on a slippery slope to another war?"
Obama: I've spent 4 1/2 years trying to end wars, not to start them.
Obama: I believe our democracy is stronger when the President acts with the support of Congress.
Obama: What happened to those people, to those children, is not only a violation of international law, it's also a danger of our security.
Obama: When dictators commit atrocities, they depend on the world to look the other way.
Obama is giving details on the chemical weapons attack in Syria on August 21st.
Obama: We know the Assad regime was responsible.
Obama: No one disputes that chemical weapons were used in Syria.
Obama: The images from this massacre are sickening.
Obama: We cannot resolve someone else's civil war through force.
President Obama has begun his speech.
About 15 minutes until President Obama's speech on Syria. We'll be live tweeting the address.

The hearing has come to a close.
The House is into the fourth hour of the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Syria.
Correction to earlier tweet. Rep. Castro, not Cruz.
Kerry: "It will invite other contests of conflict that will put us to the test and potentially with much greater consequences."
Cruz asks Sec. Kerry on the precedent America will set if we do not act in Syria.
A heated exchange between Sec. Kerry and Rep. Duncan from South Carolina.
Poe asks what America will do if Syria strikes back at US or its allies.
Poe: "We have a credibility problem because our foreign policy in the Middle East is inconsistent."
McCaul: "We saw what happened in Libya. My greatest concern is who is going to fill the vacuum when the Assad regime falls."
McCaul: "My concern is that any strike against this regime will empower these radical Islamists…these extremists."
McCaul: "This is a very dangerous step that we are taking. I believe we have to be very careful about how we proceed."
Connolly: "We’re not dealing with a president who is hungering to invade."
Chabot asks Kerry if President Obama would have come to Congress with vote if British Parliament passed Cameron's vote.
Chabot says he will consider any arguments the administration brings forward but has serious concerns on using military force in Syria.
Meeks says he is concerned about unintended consequences of using military force in Syria.
Kerry says he has not heard anything on the rumor that House will not have a vote on action in Syria.
Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee are now asking questions.
Hagel: "We are not unaware of the costs and ravages of war."
Hagel: "The US must demonstrate, through our actions, that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable."
Hagel: "We cannot afford for Hezbollah…to have incentives to aquire or use these chemical weapons."
Kerry: "This is not the time to be spectators of slaughter."
Kerry: "We are not asking America to go to war."
Kerry: "North Korea is hoping for ambivalence from the Congress."
Kerry: "We know that Assad will read our silence…as a signal that he can use his weapons with impunity."
Kerry: "The risk of not acting is greater than the risk of acting."
Sec. Kerry: "This is about the world’s red line. It's about humanity’s red line."
Sec. Kerry: We're here because against warnings from POTUS, Congress, the Assad regime unleashed chemical attack on its own people.
Rep. Engel says he strongly agrees with President Obama that the US must respond to sarin attack in Syria.
Secretary Kerry and Secretary of Defense Hagel have entered the hearing.
House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on Syria beginning soon.
Rep. Michael McCaul will be questioning Secretary of State John Kerry during the House Foreign Affairs Committee's hearing on Syria at noon.

Craig describes the different needles he had in his garage and their uses. Some were used for HGH other for steroids.
Prosecutors now show box where Craig says he saved his needles.
Craig he says FDA Agent Jeff Novitsky knock in his door before 6 a.m. in 2005. That's when he stopped taking HGH.
He says players would call him more often "during the dog days of summer" because players' bodies would start to break down.
He says some steroids he sold came from other countries. They would run from $300-$1,00. "For a ballplayer that's nothing."
RT @jimbaumbach: Radomski says his nickname is Murdoch and some ballplayers didn't learn his real name until they had to make checks out ...
Craig says he grew from 165 pounds when he graduated from high school to 225-230 pounds when he first competed.
He says he met McNamee in the late 90s early 2000s through a ballplayer.
He then switched to using human growth hormone in 2001 until 2005 because it was safer.
Craig he stopped using steroids in 2005. He says he took them to get "bigger. I was a small guy."
Craig says in 1986 he started "building" his body, meaning that he started lifting weights. He started taking steroids in 1991.
Prosecution shows a photo of the Mets celebrating their win in the 1986 World Series. Radomski appears in the photo next to players.
Radomski says he started working with the Mets in 1985 at age 15. He started as bat boy and worked his way up to club house attendant.
Next on the witness stand Kirk Radomski, Brian McNamee's drug supplier.
Craig now explains the differences in authority between strength conditioning coaches and trainers.
Craig says Clemens worked harder as he aged.
He was in excellent condition, well-conditioned athlete, worked hard at it, Craig says of Clemens' health condition during time at TBJ.

RT @ekt929: The back-and-forth between Hardin and Novitsky is getting pretty chippy. #Clemens Lots of dripping sarcasm.
Novitzky is now identifying shipping receipts that a group of agents seized at Radomski's house in 2005. Radomski shipped HGH.
He says he is familiar with Kirk Radomski. According to the Mitchell Report, Radomski sold McNamee the HGH.
Now on the witness stand Jeff Novitzky an agent with the Food and Drug Administration. He was part of the investigation against BALCO.
Barnett says that after the 2008 hearing, MLB commissioner and the head of the players' union strengthed the rules over the use of HGH.
Barnett says Congress' investigation showed Pettitte's and Knoblauch's use of HGH was greater than what they had told Mitchell.
Congressional staffer Phil Barnett returns to the witness stand for the retrial of Roger #Clemens.
Judge's interpretation of Pettitte's testimony is the pitcher is conflicted and doesn't know exactly what Clemens told him.
Pettitte's testimony is over. Judge calls for 10-min break.
RT @HoustonChron: Pettitte: I may have misunderstood Clemens about HGH http://t.co/4fXpP7Aw
Pettitte says in the 2005 conversation Clemens told him that his wife Debbie had used HGH but not him.
Durham asks Pettitte if the account he gave prosecutors of his conversation with Clemens in 2005 on HGH is accurate. Pettitte says yes.
Pettitte again says he had never heard of HGH before talking with #Clemens about it in either 1999 or 2000.
@rickdunham Walton sustained objection. He said it was completely irrelevant.
Pettitte says his job has gotten harder as he has aged.
Prosecutor asks Pettitte if he ever saw Clemens throw a ball to a player's head on purpose. Defense attorneys object. Judge sustains.
Andy Pettitte wipes his eyes while prosecutors and attorneys approach the bench. Not sure if he's tired or avoiding looking at Clemens.
RT @SMPChron: Reasonable doubt just introduced. Pettitte says there's a 50-50 chance he misunderstood #Clemens statement that he had use ...
Pettitte says Clemens didn't look defensive when denying his use of HGH in 2005. Pettitte says he believed he misunderstood Clemens.
Pettitte says the earlier conversation he had with Clemens didn't cross his mind in 2002 when he got his first shot of HGH.
Recess. Pettitte will continue to answer questions from Clemens' lawyer tomorrow morning.
Pettitte says neither him nor Clemens tried to block the Yankees from firing McNamee after trainer was involved in criminal investigation.
Pettitte says he doesn't remember the context of his conversation with Clemens about HGH in 1999 or 2000.
While prosecutors and defense attorneys approach the judge's bench, Pettitte leans back and continues to avoid eye contact with Clemens.
Vitamin B12 shots were common in the Yankees, Pettitte says. Trainers would administer the shots, not doctors. McNamee never gave him B12.
Pettitte says Clemens never suggested to him to use HGH.
Attanasio continues to tell many of Clemens' feats. Prosecution objects to Attanasio's questioning style.
While questioning Pettitte, Attanasio physically demonstrated to the jury how Clemens dominated the inside part of the plate.
Mike Attanasio, one of Clemens' attorney, begins cross examination of Andy Pettitte. Pettitte says Clemens was a loyal friend.
Pettitte identifies Clemens in courtroom. Pettitte says he hasn't talked to Clemens in a long time, calls him "good friend."
"Obviously, I was a bit flustered," Pettitte says of Clemens' response.
Pettitte says Clemens said "What are you talking about? I told you my wife had used it."
Pettitte says he talked with Clemens in Spring 2005 about the Congressional hearings taking place on the use of HGH by MLB players.
"I wish I've never would have," says Pettitte of his use of HGH.
"I heard it would help strength tendons and ligaments. My elbow was strained that's why I started using it," Pettitte says.
Durham pressess Pettitte for timeline of conversations with McNamee and Clemens about HGH.
"Roger had mentioned to me that he had taken HGH... and that in could help with recovery," Pettitte says.
"(He) did a great job training me, preparing me," says Pettitte of McNamee. Pitcher says McNamee sacrificed his family for him.
Pettitte says McNamee would stay in a room in his gym at his house because they would train in the morning.
Pettitte says he would do a lot of cardio, strength training with Clemens under McNamee's direction.
Pettitte says McNamee would sometimes stay at Clemens' house during the offseason. Clemens has denied that McNamee stayed at his house.
Pettitte says he would train during the off season in Houston at Clemens' house.McNamee "Mac" would trained with both players.
Pettitte says he got B12 shots in Yankees years. Those shots supposedly help players if they feel sick.He says head trainer would give them.
Durham shows Pettitte official photo of the Yankees in 2000 and asks him to find himself in picture. Pettitte can't identify himself.
Pettitte says McNamee returned to the Yankees in 2000 as assistant strength trainer. He says McNamee spent time in the club house.
Pettitte says he met Clemens' former strength coach Brian McNamee during his first year with the Yankees in 1995.
Pettitte says he worked out in a gym in Clemens' house.
Andy Pettitte is again answering questions by prosecutor Steve Durham.
A star witness for the prosecution in Clemens' retrial, pitcher Andy Pettitte, began to testify this afternoon. http://t.co/zt9aHJJA
Prosecutors have called Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte to the witness stand this afternoon. Court is on recess and will reconvene at 1:45 pm.
While questioning Barnett, Hardin is trying to show whether the 2008 hearing was necessary. Prosecutors object again. Judge calls for break.
Hardin is introducing information about a  2003 MLB steroids test that he says Clemens passed.
During his deposition in Jan. 2008, Clemens testified before 8 lawyers: 4 from the majority (Democrats at the time) and 4 from the minority.
But the committee declined Clemens' proposal. Hardin says then Clemens' options were to either appear voluntarily or be subpoenaed.
Before Clemens testified in Congress, his attorney proposed committee that the pitcher could appear w/chairman to speak against drug use.
"Memory is difficult sometimes,isn't it?"Hardin tells Barnett.Barnett says he cannot recolllect parts of Clemens' hearing.
"It's simply a report about private group, done by a private group about a private individual" Hardin says of Mitchell report.
Judge tells Hardin he's going "far field from what this proceeding is about" during his cross examination of Phil Barnett.
Hardin attacks Mitchell Report during cross examination of Barnett. Prosecutors continue to object to Hardin's questions.
We're back covering the retrial of pitcher Roger Clemens. Attorney Rusty Hardin is questioning prosecutors' witness Phil Barnett.
Clarence Thomas said nothing.
Clement said that catching those who are not of legal status can prevent serious crimes in the future.
Verrilli against section 5 saying that people who want to work are hard-working people and should not be the focus of deportation.
Roberts was concerned that it could cause tensions with other governments.
Clement argued that the laws don't authorize police to do anything against the 4th amendment or ad hoc.
... and it would be more difficult to find out who is and is not of legal status in the United States.
Verrilli expressed his concern that harassment would ensue, Arizona would have structural accountability problems....
Justice Breyer expressed his concerns that section 2B could lead to more arrests and longer detention periods
The 8 justices (Elena Kagan was recused) were presented with the right of the state to enforce federal law versus possible discrimination
This morning at the Supreme Court, Clement and Verrilli presented oral arguments of Arizona v. United States
Hardin: "Our Congress should never punish someone for trying to clean his name." Clemens has a "right for his name."
Hardin "begs" jury to look at evidence and see if case has only been about a man who's "tried to clean his name."
Hardin asks jury to keep in mind Clemens' career didn't change because of McNamee. The person who has lied in this case is McNamee.
"We are not going to talk bad about anybody, except for Brian McNamee," Hardin says.
Hardin tells jury prosecution is only presenting "half stories."
Hardin: gov's case involves 268 interview reports, 79 interview locations, 103 fed law enforcement officers to prove Clemens used drugs
Hardin: should Clemens had taken steroids, "where is the evidence he took it after 2001?" Only McNamee contends it.
Hardin tells jury Clemens may have been at a pool party in Fla. the prosecution plans to go after. He may have been there after golfing.
Fourth objection. "Oh man!" Hardin says.
Hardin plays audio of Clemens' deposition given previous to his before Congress. Hardin asks jury to listen to Clemens' voice.
"The evidence is always going to be in this side of this courtroom that Mr. McNamee manipulated the evidence," Hardin says.
Prosecution drops third objection 41 minutes into Hardin's opening statement.
Hardin says prosecutors will have to establish the evidence's chain of custody. He says FBI found no fingerprints of Clemens in syringes
Hardin says cotton swabs and needle that McNamee says to have used on Clemens were kept inside a beer can. He shows photo.
Next picture shows cover of the unpublished manuscript of "Death, Taxes, and Mac. The Autobiography of Brian McNamee."
*celebrity. Sorry for the mistake.
Hardin now shows photo of Brian McNamee in Howard Stern Show, enjoying "celebrety" status after testifying of Clemens drug use.
Hardin tells jury they must consider what the pitcher's career was like before and after McNamee claims he gave him steroids.
McNamee was a person who could help Clemens work out and to whom the player could pitch to. McNamee was a catcher, Hardin says.
Talks about his first three Cy Young Awards, and his move to the Toronto Blue Jays in 1997 when he was 34 years old.
Hardin now shows timeline of Clemens' professional career. He talks about the pitcher's efforts to become a professional player.
Hardin: Andy Pettitte's testimony will show that Roger Clemens did not use steroids.
Hardin shows pictures of Clemens to prove the pitcher didn't "bulk up" because of steroids. No medical evidence can prove it.
Sixteen minutes into Hardin's opening statement, prosecution drops first objection. Last trial, prosecution made no objections.
Hardin shows a picture of the room where Roger Clemens testified before Congress. The photo shows several reporters crowded around Clemens.
Roger Clemens  was an achiever, Hardin says. He became a great pitcher for his own work, not because of former strength coach Brian McNamee.
"Let it not be forgotten that he (Clemens) didn't want to (testify before Congress)" Hardin says. He did it to avoid subpoena.
"This man (Clemens) is the poster boy for Mitchell report," Hardin says.
Hardin now attacks Mitchell report.
"You're sitting in judgement of whether it's a crime to deny committing a crime," Hardin tells jury.
Hardin: dishonesty, betrayal... This is not what this should be about. It's about the evidence.
Good morning. We are back in court for the retrial of Roger #Clemens. Next, Rusty Hardin, pitcher's attorney, gives opening statement.
"Are you trying to confuse the jury?"an irritated judge tells attorneys, prosecutors battling over testimony. "Move on!"
Prosecutor finishes his opening argument asking jury to return guilty veredict. Defense lawyer asks to give his statement tomorrow. Recess.
Prosecutor says evidence will show that Clemens' "greatest adversary" four years ago "was Roger Clemens himself."
Prosecutor: "This is a man that could have hire any strength coach in the United State of America, but he chose Brian McNamee."
"We didn't pick McNamee to be a witness," prosecutor says. "This man (Clemens) chose him as a strength coach."
Prosecutor tells jury they will hear defene attorney discredit prosecution's witnesses, including Pettitte and McNamee.
Prosecutor says in 2008 McNamee gave federal agents the syringes and cotton swabs he used on Clemens. Lab found anabolic steroids on them.
Prosecutor says Clemens declined to cooperate with Senator Mitchell's report when the pitcher was approached through his agents.
Prosecutor says McNamee will testify that he had decided to take syringes, cottown swabs with Clemens blood as proof the pitcher used drugs.
Prosecutor says vitamin injections are a cover up. He says strength coaches are not allowed to inject any players.
Prosecutor says Clemens asked McNamee to take with him syringes and cotton swabs because he didn't want any evidence in his apartment.
Prosecutor says Clemens told Congress that McNamee had injected him with vitamins, not HGH.
Prosecutor says Clemens denied to Pettitte in March 2005 he had ever used HGH. Clemens then told Pettitte it was his wife who had used it.
Prosecutor says Pettitte will testify during Clemens' retrial about his use of HGH in the early 2000s.
Prosecutor says Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte didn't know what HGH is until Clemens told him about his own use of such drug.
Prosecutor says members of Congress held the hearing in 2008 out of concern of the role-model effect professional athletes have on children.
Prosecutor says Clemens had "a ten-year relationship" with McNamee. He says they trusted each other deeply.
Prosecutor says Kirk Radomski, a dealer of steroids, shipped HGH to Clemens' house in 2002 and supplied McNamee with drugs.
In 2000, Clemens is injured. Yankees not happy with him. He asks McNamee to give him steroids. McNamee gives Clemens the drug.
Prosecutor says Clemens asked Yankees GM to create a brand-new position for Brian McNamee in the team int he late 90s.
Judge says court has had many budget cutbacks for which they now can't replace jurors' pens "until they run out of ink."
Hardin says McNamee intended to make money out of the book. Judge just asked Clemens' wife to leave courtroom for opening statements.
Judge allows defense to introduce as evidence the cover of "Death, Taxes, and MAC. The Autobiography of Brian McNamee."
Discussing regression and the parabolic relationship between the number of shots you take& ur happiness level #practicalapplicaion
Judge says for now he won't allow Pettitte to say McNamee provided him with HGH.
Jury for Roger Clemens' retrial includes 10 women and six men. Twelve are jurors and four are alternates.
Judge reminds jury to stay away from news coverage of the trial and to not talk about the case with friends and relatives.
Judge: Jurors will be given breakfast and lunch throughout the trial so that they "are not out (and) about" in the courthhouse.
The 12 jurors and four alternates for Clemens' retrial have been selected.
Prosecutors and defense argue over the scope of testimony that key witness Yankees pitcher Andy Pettitte can provide: http://t.co/ZSc8pKwi
Clemens' retrial in Washington enters second week. Judge appears sympathetic to prosecution in early arguments: http://t.co/DWGqEhcH
Prosecutor argues that not letting Pettitte say who gave him HGH may leave the jury speculating who provided the drug.
Prosecutor now argues why Andy Pettitte should be allowed to testify that he got HGH from McNamee, Clemens' former strength coach.
Hardin says Clemens testified only because there was the potential of getting a subpoena; he didn't testify voluntarily.
He says congressmen themselves should testify, not their staffers. But judge says staffers are the "work horses" in Congress.
Clemens' attorney says congressional staffer Phil Barnett shouldn't be allowed to testify about Congress' intention with hearing

MI has an open primary. 30 delegates are at stake, but candidates will receive them proportionally  #miprimary
