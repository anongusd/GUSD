Finally, with @TheJusticeDept, we're investing nearly $2M to help young public housing residents clear their criminal records and find work.
When actions warrant it, local officials may evict, but families who pose no safety risk shouldn't be unduly punished. #NLIHClive
It used to be that if someone was arrested for a drug offense their entire family would be kicked out of public housing. No more. #NLIHClive
Further, arbitrary “One Strike” policies that bar anyone with a prior arrest cannot be used in public or private housing. #NLIHClive
Housing is integral to stability and opportunity, especially for those who've paid their debt to society and are returning home. #NLIHClive
An arrest only means that a person was suspected of a crime. An arrest shouldn’t keep you from getting a job or renting a home. #NLIHClive

@PeterBlairHenry @HUDgov Thanks for hosting! And congrats on all the great things happening at @NYUStern .
.@HUDgov will keep on empowering, keep on helping, and keep on investing to grow the middle class and strengthen the housing market.
President Johnson would be proud that we’ve kept the dream of homeownership alive during the greatest financial crisis of our lifetimes.
Two percent also shows that our books are among the strongest in HUD's history, cash reserves going up, delinquencies going down.
Two percent shows that we've found the right balance between strengthening our finances and fulfilling our mission.
Today, the FHA's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund capital ratio is 2.07 percent. https://t.co/Sw6caAQB4L
In FY2014, after falling into the red, FHA got back in the black thanks to $21 billion in growth to the fund over a two-year period.
FHA rescued the housing market at a cost. The Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund dropped below the mandated 2% capital reserve ratio.
During the financial crisis, FHA put a floor under the housing market and saved 3 million jobs and $500 million in economic output.
The progress in housing is strengthening the overall economy: a record 68 straight months of private sector growth. https://t.co/SLaYhLm0Bd
Home prices are at their highest levels since 2007, and families have built nearly $6 trillion in housing wealth since April of 2009.
Our housing market is full of momentum. Sales of existing homes are the strongest in years, home prices at their highest levels since 2007.
FHA's total volume is ↑ 50% over the first 6 months of 2015 and we’ve served 75,000 new, responsible borrowers with credit scores below 680.
This year’s MIP reduction was necessary for both the families being shut out, and the economy as a whole. https://t.co/t0IISrDm2p
Efforts like the Mortgage Insurance Premium reduction help build a level playing field for folks who are ready and willing to buy a home.
.@HUDgov is laser-focused on strengthening FHA for the long-term, and on bolstering a growing housing market so that it works for everyone.
The Federal Housing Administration has also insured loans to half of all African American and Latino homebuyers in recent years.
The Federal Housing Administration has: 	✓helped 44 million Americans become homeowners 	✓supported over half of all first-time homebuyers.
America is at its greatest when hard work is rewarded with opportunity. @HUDgov extends this opportunity to folks of all walks of life.
When President Johnson created HUD 50 years ago, he said our work could give every family a home of dignity, a community of opportunity.

Together, we can continue building a healthier and safer future for millions of public housing residents. #SmokeFree
Already, 612 Public Housing Authorities, representing 20% of @HUDgov’s housing, have voluntarily become #SmokeFree.
Smoking in the home causes more than 100,000 residential fires — fires that claim nearly 1,000 lives — each year.  #SmokeFree
According to @CDCgov, #SmokeFree public housing would save our nation $153 million each year. https://t.co/EaIjd0tKKh
#SmokeFree public housing would help protect the delicate lungs of 760,000 children living in #PublicHousing. https://t.co/O7R63nFprZ
Establishing a #SmokeFree rule would improve the health of 2 million public housing residents, including nearly 330,000 seniors.
HUD's proposed #SmokeFree rule means public housing units, indoor common areas and administrative buildings would be off-limits to smoking.

Homeownership is still the cornerstone of the American Dream — a fact you can see in the lives of everyday folks.

We have to help boost access to knowledge and employment by connecting housing to surrounding community assets. #BPChousing
We have to provide folks with a fair shot to secure decent, affordable rental housing. #BPChousing
We have to work together to give folks who are ready and responsible the opportunity to own a home. #BPChousing
I’m going to place special focus on broadband access. Access to information is as vital as jobs, good schools, and safe streets. #BPChousing
HUD will award $75M to nearly 750 Public Housing Authorities to connect residents with education &amp; job opportunities they need. #BPChousing
The answer for many communities is HUD’s Rental Assistance Demonstration initiative—also known as RAD. #BPChousing
Communities are wondering how they can preserve their public housing in this tough fiscal climate. #BPChousing
The nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year, mainly due to disrepair—as funding from Washington decreases. #BPChousing
Boosting homeownership isn’t the only part of the opportunity equation. So is combating our nation’s rental housing crisis. #BPChousing
We need to attract private capital back to the market, establish certainty for lenders, and protect taxpayers for the future. #BPChousing
On housing finance reform, a government-dominated market is unsustainable. #BPChousing
Before the housing crisis, it was too easy to get a loan. Now it’s too hard. The pendulum has swung too far the other way. #BPChousing
The truth is that the dream of homeownership is out of reach for too many Americans. #BPChousing
Homeownership helps families put down roots and secure their financial futures. It’s a cornerstone of the American Dream. #BPChousing
Across the country, HUD is providing help and hope. And we’ll spend the next 2.5 years expanding opportunity for all Americans. #BPChousing

I’m proud to be a part of the ceremonies today as we celebrate the seeds of rebirth blossoming across New Orleans. http://t.co/zFpxN3Z7af
History will look back on this chapter in New Orleans—and in America—and remember the city for its triumphs, not its tragedies.
The people of New Orleans never lost hope. Katrina was a strong storm, but the spirit and resilience of the people was stronger.
I’m in New Orleans today honoring the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, speaking with those who have persevered for nine years.

Our Blueprint for Access is expanding access to credit for responsible families, helping put the dream of home ownership in reach. @REALTORS
On my way to speak with the National Association of @REALTORS to talk about expanding opportunities for American families.
We'll continue working with our federal and local partners to ensure every American veteran has a stable home and an opportunity to succeed.
We've made incredible progress in reducing homelessness among veterans--and we'll keep working. http://t.co/vtDXJCPMG9
Big news to share: Our latest annual count shows fewer than 50K homeless veterans in America—a 33% drop since 2010. http://t.co/vtDXJCPMG9

Thanks again to Mayors @RahmEmanuel and @karenaboutgary for their hospitality today. I truly learned a lot. HUD will be there for you.
Here's a photo of today's ground-breaking ceremony at the Woodlawn Senior Living Building in Chicago. http://t.co/h6woCAL7VI
In the Windy City it’s clear the winds of change are strong in the Woodlawn neighborhood–and they’re blowing in the direction of progress.
Today's ground-breaking in Chicago shows how transformative change often begins at the community level and not behind a desk in Washington.
I also took part in a ceremony at the Woodlawn Senior Living Building in Chicago today. It’s funded through a HUD Choice Neighborhood Grant.
At the Sheraton Hotel in Gary, IN, I stood with @karenaboutgary and spoke about Strong Cities, Strong Communities. http://t.co/NgSo9bIpWv
Here we are in Gary, Indiana today speaking with three formerly homeless veterans who live at South Shore Commons. http://t.co/QFEMANglK0
Just left Gary, IN—a city in the Strong Cities, Strong Communities Initiative. Heard powerful stories from formerly homeless veterans.
Look forward to meeting @RahmEmanuel and @karenaboutgary today as we discuss solutions for homelessness, urban development, and more.
I’m visiting Gary, Indiana and Chicago, Illinois today to kick off my opportunity and investment community tour.
As I said again, HUD is the Department of Opportunity and I’m committed to ensuring every American has a fair opportunity to succeed.

I’m proud to be a part of this effort and stand with @usmayors as we work jointly to create #CitiesOfOpportunity.
Housing and communities are the foundation for strong cities, so to create #CitiesOfOpportunity, we must remain resolute and focused.
Today I spoke to the @usmayors #CitiesOfOpportunity Task Force about how we’re expanding opportunity for all Americans.
Thank you @NAHJ for 30 years of providing opportunities for Hispanic journalists and for giving our stories a platform and voice. #NAHJ14SA
In the next 30 years, @NAHJ will expand more opportunities for Latinos across media platforms and empower others with information. #NAHJ14SA
Journalism is good for government. It holds public officials accountable and gives people a voice when their reps don’t listen. #NAHJ14SA
Congratulations to @NAHJ for 30 years of covering the issues that are important to the Hispanic community. #NAHJ14SA
The pioneering work of @NAHJ founders has inspired hundreds of young Latino journalists and it will be recognized tonight. #NAHJ14SA
Looking forward to speaking at the #NAHJ14SA gala tonight and recognizing 30 years of contributions and journalistic excellence.

You’ll hear me say this more: We’re going to ensure every veteran has a place to call home in the country they risked everything to protect.
