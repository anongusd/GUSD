@BillGRinehart @npratc you are hitting me where it hurts Bill.
@npratc 10. Do goats think trade wars are easy to win?		Thus endeth my questions. Over to you @npratc
@npratc 9. Are there tryouts to be on the grass-eating/brush clearing goat team or is it more of an "everyone's a winner" culture?
@npratc 8. Do goats hate sheep?
@npratc 7. By that same token, is there a goat that's clearly smarter than the other goats but he's not good at walking on those damn goat boardwalk things so he's ostracized and always has to eat his grass alone?
@npratc 6. Is there one goat who's like really good at his job and all the other goats quietly seethe with resentment?
@npratc 5. Do these goats have work anxiety dreams?
@npratc 4. Do the goats ever feel like they're just selling out to the man?
Oh dude...this is a good one. @nprAudie make sure to get me an answer to this tonight. https://t.co/j68smZuV4L
@npratc 3. If stranded on a desert island what five albums would a goat take and would said goat eat a human?
@npratc 2. Are the goats deprived of food so they are hungry before their grass cutting jobs?
Yeah, I know you didn't ask @npratc but here are the pressing questions I want answers to: 	1. presumably these goats were hired to cut someone's grass (that's a thing) and they went rogue. Did they finish their first job before getting greedy for more?
As sad as I am that the rogue goats story broke too late in the day for us to update OUR show @npratc will be living up to its name tonight and giving it 3 minutes in their show. #thenewsuneed

@emilynussbaum One other thought on this Emily. Genuine question. If it really was supposed to have been a feminist show wouldn‚Äôt it have been told from Peggy or Joan‚Äôs POV instead of making Draper the centerpiece? Or maybe it had to be that way because women then only existed adjacent to men.
@madhulikasikka Right?!
@madhulikasikka Honestly I‚Äôd sometimes rather dissect Mad Men then think about the news.
@emilynussbaum I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm just thinking of it differently now. Draper is an easier call. Bad messed up dude. Roger Sterling is almost more complicated because he was made to be more endearing. I‚Äôm just saying the show would read differently today.
@pescami Disagree.
@ThePenDrake @JulietteWade Totally agree. We didn‚Äôt admire them but they were definitely made to be sympathetic characters and it was ok anyway bc it was all in the past.
@mbarmbarmbar Yes. That‚Äôs obviously what the show was about. However the show worked because it was behavior that was supposedly in the past. So we could watch it happen week after week and it felt ok because ‚ÄúThank God that‚Äôs not how it is now.‚Äù But clearly it is not in the past.
Remember when Mad Men was all the rage? When it seemed ok to watch a show where sexual harassers were ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù and we loved them anyway? That show couldn‚Äôt happen today. And that‚Äôs a good thing.
