This will be another bullet in the chamber for the House to use when the impeachment floodgates open. Trump's use of the military as law enforcement within US borders is tantamount to invoking martial law. I believe it will be the silver bullet.

@memphisnews This is how it needs to be done; quickly so there is zero time for the human ZEROES to plan there next HateFest. Also, this way towns/cities don't have to deal with the permit applica-tions and the First Amendment issues if the commdenies the permit for one of these HateGroups.
