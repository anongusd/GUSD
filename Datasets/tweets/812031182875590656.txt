@DavidSDePriest I am in no way endorsing either of them but I‚Äôm simply saying the job of a mayor certainly does count for something on the national stage. Big city mayors for example have budgets that are just as large as some states. Plus mayors know how to be resourceful and creative.
@DavidSDePriest I believe foreign affairs is the most important job of the president. Most policies and national standards derive from best practices with proven results from cities. Being able negotiate with any legislative body is a transferable skill that many of esteemed statesman lack.
