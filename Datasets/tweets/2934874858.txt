Politicians going on about the election like that explains things. We understand it happened. We know who won. Now go do your job and stop being a braggart.

@realDonaldTrump Um wasn't America and it's past wealth basically built by immigrants? Shouldn't we welcome people into America and show them the path to citizenship? Those that don't follow that path get deported. Those that are seeking asylum for a legitimate reason should be able to stay.
@realDonaldTrump Am I the only one who noticed the seemingly constantly rising debt of America? What can fix this?

@ladygaga First question, why are they inelligable to vote?
Break time and it's needed.

Looking forward to the new year and some new games. Witcher 3, ESO, and Dark Souls 2.
