@DallasWoodhouse How fascinating the NC GOP insisted this last election the ballot question on voter ID, but illegal electioneering gets a full pass, handling and touching of another person's absentee ballot, full pass. Collecting AB ballots..full pass.
@mwillis0315 @DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP @McCreadyForNC @WRAL No. Makes me think he is getting some sort of pass and anyone else would be in jail.
@mwillis0315 @DVJakeL @DallasWoodhouse @McCreadyForNC @WRAL @NCGOP That's hysterical because voter ID has absolutely nothing to do with this zero/ zilch/ negative.
@mwillis0315 @DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP @McCreadyForNC @WRAL Dowless should be in jail for illegal electioneering and ballot fraud this is despicable.  And taking advantage of the voters "will" in #NC09 .
@Jettlynnlato @mwillis0315 @DallasWoodhouse @NCGOP @McCreadyForNC @WRAL What I want to know is why isn't Dowless in jail? He obviously was involved in illegal electioneering. But he is getting some kind of pass...wtf.?

@OldHoleSnipe @MarkHarrisNC9 I second that. Signed an #NC09 voter.
@ThisMonkeyMind @mikemp71 @PoliticsWolf @nycsouthpaw A lineup?  Sounds a little early for a lineup...
@LeoTheLionIV Yes, I don't know if the Union County Boe could maintain something like that though.  I think using the touch screen for early voting is wrong, and they're only using the paper ballots for general election days I'd rather have paper every election.
@LeoTheLionIV People never know where they are supposed to vote.
@LeoTheLionIV Me too!!
@LeoTheLionIV I don't believe any of it.  I particularly really don't believe the results of the Brody v. Deese race. For a variety of reasons. That included part of Anson.
@LeoTheLionIV This gets deeper every time I dig on Twitter. I can't help but think some of the down-ballot races were victims of election fraud also.
@LeoTheLionIV Wow.  And so much time was spent in the urban areas.... ( good old-fashioned real canvassing not stealing registration and absentee ballot requests) while the cheaters were in the rural areas cheating voters.
@CarolineEDavis3 @DemofIniquity @TheRickWilson @TomArnold I sure hope so and I'm positive it had to take place in other counties. I hope they look at Anson and Union.
@sheppadl @CarolineEDavis3 @spiceychicken7 @TheRickWilson @CNN @CNNPolitics @nytimes @GOP I'm sure it did.
Mark Harris not only paid for the red Dome group but thanked Bladen County on Election night. https://t.co/PWyK41g3Jd
@DearAuntCrabby @molly_hegwood I sure hope law enforcement is closely looking at the Mark Harris campaign for fraudulent electioneering.  Really next time he says something like this someone throw Romaine at him.
@EveryVoiceNC @gercohen @EJSbrocco In particular a fascinating race to me is NCHD#55. Brody v. Deese.  Rep. Brody called all the teachers in Union County thugs and that was picked up by the teachers, parents, media, and I can faintly believe how the margin of this race ended up.
@SulgMadis @DKElections @neeratanden I hope we find out who offered the 40K....

@EveryVoiceNC @gercohen @EJSbrocco I do really think they need to look at other counties like Anson very very carefully I also can't help but think that the down-ballot races were also affected by these illegal election activities.
@PamCollier2 @monsoon2112 @effdot @tomwatson Trump came here I think 4x for Harris.
@FZirm @JuddLegum On top of absentee ballot scamming...the #NCGOP absolutely ass crammed a ballot amendment of voter ID to protect elections against voters. And NC bought that scam too!
@SamGreathouse @JuddLegum Robeson, Anson, Union County and Mecklenburg.  I particularly think they should look at Anson.
I love this so much. https://t.co/CPhfYDrJoV
@neeratanden @luvman33wife @McCreadyForNC This is Mark Harris election night thanking Bladen(home of the Absentee Vote "mill") and Union County(sadly where I live).  Admission to thank those ballot fraud workers! https://t.co/O06RkLBUDO
@MariaTammy @ElectProject @DKElections Yes. There are live interviews with these people.  This is the sad state of North Carolina they do zero voter education.
@PDSebastian @llawson @sistertoldjah @ElectProject @neeratanden @DKElections Sadly rural votes don't know the difference.
@BethR_27516 @NOJOgolf @neeratanden @NCSBE I'm new in the last few years to NC, so spoiled by well-run elections with high turn out in MN.  I've been so disgruntled by how they run and process elections here.
@chaboard2 @neeratanden I do not think they can just simply seat Dan McCready. We don't really know how many of these falsified absentee ballots there is out there or how many counties does happened in at this point. Believe me I don't want the Serpent's lover preacher cheater seated!
@ThisIsMarlee @neeratanden @joncoopertweets @NCGOP I couldn't agree more with you they call it the old White House of politics particularly here in my county of Union County, NC.
@neeratanden Not to mention the evening of the election Mark Harris was speaking and mentioned he wanted to thank Bladen and Union County. I'd call that an admission of guilt if you ask me. I also have fear in some of the counties this affected down-ballot races also.
@neeratanden As well as apparent people that were visiting a lot of rural voters both getting them to request absentee ballots as well as following up with collecting them unsigned, semi filled out.  Sadly there is zero voter education in North Carolina.
@neeratanden According to a lot of the local news on this: it seems like there was some illegal registration going on, and vote harvesting. There was a very strange large amount of unaffiliated Voters in certain precincts that voted for Harris.

@4ever2runval96 As it should be I guess instead of just obeying normal laws that people do when they're voting in an election season.  Cheaters should be prosecuted.
@4ever2runval96 Who says this is the only County that Harris had an AB mill in?
@realDonaldTrump That amount of money is a lot less than how much us Americans have to pay for you to go to your Resorts every weekend, and Flotus's weird trips where she doesn't really stay in the hotels.

@4ever2runval96 @dcircosta @NCSBE Yes. So does Bladen County, as well as the consulting firm that Mark Harris used.
@4ever2runval96 @dcircosta @NCSBE But the president is the king of unsubstantiated voter fraud but we're not even really specifically talking about voter fraud here I think we're talking about fraudulent absentee ballots. But I guess we'll learn more on Friday.
@4ever2runval96 @dcircosta @NCSBE It certainly wasn't unsubstantiated if the nine-member board would not certify it.

@NC_GoVote While it is a good failsafe, Election workers should absolutely not force someone to vote out of precinct but at least look up and try to assist voter to get to their precinct.
@NC_GoVote It is important that voters vote in the correct precincts.  I did not find the BOE offered enough training on getting voters that may be out of place -TO THE RIGHT PLACE!
@NC_GoVote I'd like to comment on this.  There is other issues with Provisional Ballots.  One issue is they absolutely should not be used to force someone to vote out of precinct.  If you are out of precinct your provisional ballot will not count.

@gercohen So it seems like and tell me if I'm wrong that North Carolina doesn't follow HAVA. I've had both standard training as an election judge in North Carolina and chair judge training and neither one of  covered registration at all.
@gercohen I am curious if they did not live in the precinct how they "counted" those ballots.
@TrulyRowena @Rosie God I hope so...
@gercohen I think it's really odd that they would accept provisional ballots for people who were out of Precinct.

@gercohen I don't think there's anything left that's not partisan is there?
@gercohen Union county is partisan.
@gercohen I had this happen over and over at the Precinct that I worked at as an election judge. It's so unfortunate you have to be registered unaffiliated in order to vote in Municipal races.
@gercohen I give the voter education in the state of North Carolina an F. Unfortunately they barely tell people where to vote. Let alone other relevant information.
@gercohen And this piece is really a voter education issue.  And I completely think that voters are confused about how they register with a party and then they show up for a primary to vote and they want to vote for municipal offices and they can't.
@gercohen Fascinating thread.  There is way too high of a number of provisionals. There is not enough training for the election judges to simply direct people to the correct Precincts.

@jonathankappler @ConstituPartyNC It's certainly possible as we saw with Jesse Ventura as a great example of electing a third-party candidate without having to register with a political party on your voter registration. Or even that being part of the voters information.
@jonathankappler @ConstituPartyNC And secondly how all Municipal elections are partisan now and if you are signed up with a party you don't get to vote in your local races sadly.
@jonathankappler @ConstituPartyNC I did come from another state and it was less comfusing. And we elected Jesse Ventura (3rd party) and several Green Party City Council candidates.  I think the confusion is NC making people register with the parties on their voter registration.
@jonathankappler @ConstituPartyNC Let alone I had one person show up to vote in the primary in the precinct I was working at that had registered as a Libertarian and she had no ballot she said you mean I don't get to vote?? I had to say sorry ma'am you have no ballot.
@jonathankappler @ConstituPartyNC This is so fascinating to me. Having to register with a party or unaffiliated in NC already blows my mind which causes less ultimate democracy during Municipal races, let alone several other parties during the general will really confuse voters.

I love you @RepMaxineWaters.  A true patriot. https://t.co/rtQj9rviev
@Acosta @avlgal Make me want a projectile vomit all over people that do that.
@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler Yes. There is a fine line between having every single thing partisan and State House and federal elections also.  The problem is all the municipal races are now completely partisan and judicial. The state can't behave. Voters have a right to vote for local races.
@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler And how many provisional ballots are accepted is absolutely frightening. Most people simply are in the wrong place I'm going to take a stab and say 99.5% of the people are simply in the wrong place and you can get them to the right place in time to cast their vote.
@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler I personally view elections as private and unpartisan. Getting people out to vote in general should be the goal of both parties in NC. And instead of that it is opposite.
@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler They are also extremely  confused by having to claim a "party" and then that in course limiting their ballot selection in primary. They don't know that nor how to change it. It is essentially voter supression.
@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler Well I have only a tiny slice of observations as I've only worked a Precinct in Monroe and then an Indian Trail/ Monroe chopped up Precinct. I am so saddened by just the general lack of voter information. People have no idea what's on the ballot, or how it works.
@lizzwinstead I love the transition from be best to Songbird.

@JillianDURM I also think Voters need a ton more information on candidates almost every voter that I encountered yesterday did not know who any of the candidates were or what was on their ballots. Union County.  Every election has been made partisan now which is disgusting in itself.
@JillianDURM Meaning: the easiest task for an election judge is to make sure the voter is in the correct place. Unfortunately they barely touch on that and it takes second to look up information for a voter of where they are supposed to be.  I am appalled that they barely train on that.
@JillianDURM I'd dream about RCV in NC. Amazing to have lived in a city that had it. But personally I think North Carolina needs to read educate voters about provisional ballots as well as huge priority re-educate election officials about provisional ballots.
@MichaelAvenatti @maddow Great interview.

@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler And also seemed like democratic Affiliated people were very disappointed they didn't get to vote for Sheriff.  Why on earth ever would North Carolina make their Municipal races so partisan all it does is cause voter disappointment, and lack of true democracy. In my opinion.
@waywardson2016 @jonathankappler From the trails of an Election Judge: seemed like most unaffiliated voters chose the Republican ballot.  Seemed like #1 when they saw the sample ballot and there was only one race on it in this Precinct in Union County, they simply opted for the ballot with more.

@lovebud1975 @Slate Lololo.
@realDonaldTrump Try to do it primetime when people have their TVs on.  Wag wag wag.
@gercohen @MarkEzzell @jonathankappler I will dig for it also?
@MarkEzzell @gercohen @jonathankappler Yes.  So mind boggling to me.  I feel like there could be an entire blog just written about this whole phenomenon of provisional balloting.  I am in awe.
@gercohen @jonathankappler So is there any information about who sits at the top of the board and is it a rotating position or lifetime position... and is it bipartisan? :)
@gercohen @jonathankappler Coming from a squeaky clean state like MN (yes share of recounts) it didn't matter who the SOS was the elections were managed consistently and at least from my POV clean and great turnout.
@gercohen @jonathankappler Wow.  I have been trying to figure out how it is an independent "agency" when it should have oversight by someone like a secretary of state.
@ASauer8 Well we just have to do everything possible to defeat Harris now.
@gercohen @jonathankappler One question at the top of my mind is: when did the Board of Elections separate from SOS office or was NCSBOE never connected to SOS?
@gercohen @jonathankappler Thanks for the answer. I'm absolutely fascinated by everything I'm learning about elections in NC.
@gercohen @jonathankappler So at 5 votes difference no relook even for errs?
@jonathankappler @gercohen So is there an automatic recount on this race because it was so close and it falls within the margin of error or no?
@gercohen Fascinating but not surprising for North Carolina.
@jonathankappler The public could also use better voter information about ID, provisional balloting, and pre election information about candidates seem to be really lacking.
@jonathankappler Voter Education definitely could use Improvement. 7/10 voters( app.) were not sure who was on their ballot and where they would have found previous information about the candidates. Also with every race including Municipal being partisan that caused a lot of voter confusion.
@jonathankappler @NCSBE This was my second time working for BOE in NC. I had previously been a head judge in Mpls since 1995. I find some general similarities however I sure see a lot of opportunity for streamlining and voter education as well as improved training for election officials in NC.

@cheesyscot @Jecoliah2 @CScottSilver @realMikeLindell @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump @amazon Not just amazon... what the Washington Post and Whole Foods has he no idea whatsoever how many jobs these three businesses produce and sustain.
