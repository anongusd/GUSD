@John_Darrah Southwest has no reason to fabricate the reason for your flt's cancellation, as that's not helpful to you or us. If we could've made this flt operate as scheduled, we would for your sake, the scheduling of our Crews, &amp; the placement of our aircraft. -Becca

@edonald Totally understand, Elizabeth. Our Baggage Handlers lift so may pieces of luggage a day, and it can be very hard on the legs and back when luggage is overweight. That being said, we have a strict baggage weight limit so that we can prevent injury to our Baggage Handlers. -Rachel
