It‚Äôs up to us to remember the sacrifice, and when we do, we‚Äôve truly honored our responsibility to never forget.
The men and women we lost on 9/11, the first responders who rushed in, and the heroes who answered the call to defend freedom around the globe are an embodiment of the idea that there are causes greater than oneself worth fighting for.
As they do, I hope they understand that #NeverForget is so much more than a slogan, a hashtag, or a graphic that‚Äôs shared on Facebook each year. It‚Äôs a responsibility.
It‚Äôs hard to believe that nearly two decades have already passed, and today there‚Äôs another generation of kids learning about 9/11 the same way we learned about events like Pearl Harbor and the Kennedy assassination.
We suddenly shared the ability to understand something we‚Äôd only heard our parents and grandparents discuss about moments in the past: where you were when you heard the news, what you remember, all of the emotions you felt.
It happened in an instant. For a new generation of Americans, myself included, the idea of a national tragedy ‚Äì the likes of which we‚Äôd only read about in books or watched in movies ‚Äì became a reality.

@Axs_Evl Each body sets its own rules of proceeding, they're not prescribed by the Constitution.
@Axs_Evl Senator Byrd (D-WV): "That's why we have a Senate, to debate and amend freely." #NotLikeTheHouse
@Axs_Evl If the majority party in the Senate set the rules for consideration of bill like the House, it would be the House.
@Axs_Evl If it was majority rule, we'd have two Houses of Representatives and no Senate.
@Axs_Evl That's not in works in the United States Senate. That's why there's a House and a Senate.
@Axs_Evl Changing Senate rules with only 51 votes? When has it happened between now and 2005?
@Axs_Evl Not afraid of up or down vote. Bad precedent for the institution to break the rules to change the rules.
@Axs_Evl They didn't in 2005, which is when this issue last came up (and when they were in majority).
@Axs_Evl Aside from the change itself, Sen. Reid wants to break the rules to change them with only dem votes.
@Axs_Evl It abolishes the filibuster on the motion to proceed.
@Axs_Evl That's simply not true, especially to the extent Senator Reid has gone.
@Axs_Evl Because then the minority is rendered powerless. Majority controls the floor.
@Axs_Evl When he brings up a bill and immediately files cloture and fills the tree, Republicans push back, want to offer amendments.
@Axs_Evl It's a perfect example. When the majority leader follows regular order = no filibuster. Same thing with the farm bill.
@Axs_Evl Why would the minority vote to end debate when they've been prevented from legislating?
@Axs_Evl No majority leader has blocked minority amendments than Senator Reid.
@Axs_Evl Great example of following regular order: yesterday's #NDAA vote. Hundreds of amdts considered, passed 98-0.
@Axs_Evl Republicans often vote to extend debate (against cloture) because the majority leader blocks them from offering amendments.

@GDGivens Ha, we did.
@GDGivens I can agree with you on that one -- the Senate needs an open amendment process.
@GDGivens Exactly. But the majority leader has certain rights, and one of them is blocking GOP amendments by filling the amdt tree.
@GDGivens That's why Republicans often vote against cloture -- because they can't get up or down votes on their amendments/ideas.
.@SenMikeLee: "We need an open amendment process. Our status as the world's greatest deliberative legislative body requires nothing less."
When senators are prevented from participating in the legislative process (filling the tree), many vote to extend debate (against cloture).
.@SenMikeLee: Sen Reid has filled the amdt tree (blocking GOP amdts) 67 times, more than any other majority leader in history.
Sounds like early cloture vote tomorrow AM Re: sportsmen's bill. Votes *possible* on amendments later tomorrow evening or Fri.
