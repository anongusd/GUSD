Murkowski also weighed in on Democrats' positioning in the SCOTUS debate: "I find it somewhat troubling that even before the president named judge Kavanaugh that there were those who were roundly condemning the nominee without knowing who the nominee is."
Example of his huge role: I asked Murkowski this morning whether Kavanaugh's extensive history, writings could slow the nomination. She said that was a question for Grassley who will be in charge of moving the nomination along in committee. https://t.co/RkuoVkEHcn
Murkowski on where  Kavanaugh is on Roe v. Wade: "I don’t have an impression on Judge Kavanaugh as to where he may fall on the issue of abortion as well as the many other issues that I will weigh... So again, that’s why I think all of us need to be doing our due diligence."
Sen. @lisamurkowski tells me this morning that this confirmation process is going to take time "there’s a lot of work to be done before I think a real, fair analysis of Judge Kavanaugh and his qualifications to serve on our highest court land."
Early readout this morning. Democrats are making this SCOTUS fight all about health care and pre-existing conditions and that's true from Sen. Joe Manchin to Sen. Chris Murphy.

The House passed its short-term spending bill in a vote that is just the first of. many this week to avert a shutdown.
Hours after saying he's feeling pessimistic on immigration, Graham says he's freely renewed optimism. "We're back in the ballgame"
Flake:"We don't need a shutdown. We obviously need a new border security, we'll do it as part of the DACA fix, but we don't need a shutdown"
@ELBordeaux Kaine said all people have to do is look at Trump's twitter to understand why Dreamers are afraid.
@KDbyProxy @chrisgeidner Ben Nelson is asked about DACA, answers questions politely and then says he wants to make some comments on the rocket. "We're going to Mars"

Tillis talking about bipartisan DACA negotiations. He says some Dems aren't willing to talk about reality of what it takes to secure border.

Corker has already announced he'd vote against the Senate tax bill, but funny to see him on the floor, glasses on, with the bill in his hand. I should note he was still on that first page.

Reminder that if Corker were the only problem, they likely wouldn't be trying to find ways to increase revenue. He probs isn't the only one who has latched onto JCT score.
it's been an hour since we started this vote in the U.S. Senate. Three Republicans have not voted: Corker, Flake, Johnson.
That feeling when it's 4:30 and you don't know when anything will happen and the Byrd rule is looming large.
"It's hard to see how you're going to fix this with some kind of trigger," Wyden says about the JCT dynamic score that was just released.
“This score that I’ve just gotten ends the fantasy about magical growth" and claims that tax reform pays for itself  -Wyden says.	https://t.co/ewKzwygXS6
Flake and Corker left lunch and would not give any additional insight into negotiations on the so-called trigger they want to secure.

@NickRiccardi Is it? If you include a repeal of the individual mandate, it get a lot easier for red-state dems to message against it. Without that repeal, you are right, messaging was incredibly tricky.
Per @deirdrewalshcnn: Pelosi aide says the White House was informed before Pelosi-Schumer released the statement about canceling due to the president’s tweet.
Trump said that he didn't think a deal could be made. Pelosi and Schumer say then there's no reason to go to the WH. They've canceled meeting, asked to talk with McConnell/Ryan instead.
Corker tells @mkraju this morning there's still some "more work to do" on the tax bill before he can be a "yes" REMINDER: budget committee vote is later today.
"I don't see a deal" seems like a tough way to start a meeting https://t.co/fHYJQaN8vk

Franken tells @mj_lee that the reason he cannot speculate about if more women will come forward with allegations against him is that he never ever thought two weeks ago any woman would allege what they have so far.
"I want to be someone who adds something to this conversation. I hope I can do that," Franken says.
Franken says he does not remember some of the instances in which women allege he touched them inappropriately as he posed for photos with them.

Rob Portman sounds optimistic about state flexibility in Graham Cassidy although he says he would like more money for Opioid treatment.
Hatch says he scheduled a hearing on Graham-Cassidy in Finance next week because members "will benefit from a public discussion" on it.

Orrin Hatch says that "this committee is going to consider tax reform through regular order" aka he isn't just going to accept a House bill.

Trump urges crowd to "speak to your senator" on health care vote. He means call McCain.
"No one wants me to talk about your other senator who is weak on borders, weak on crime."- Trump says about [Flake]
This is the moment...will Trump mention names?
"We were one vote away," Trump says on health care.
If you are watching Trump talk about why some health care polices take 60 votes and are confused, you can read this! https://t.co/RSgfEIlAnw
Evergreen reminder: The filibuster did not stop health care.
Here is what @JohnCornyn said today on the border wall. https://t.co/c9ahDAUsL7

"I think he's gonna be just fine, OK?" Trump says of Arpaio. Remember, Trump can pardon him if he wanted to. "I won't do it tonight."
Trump talks Arpaio, asks the crowd if they like Sheriff Joe.

@brennawilliams This was really good!
A very sustained boo for the "very dishonest media." as Trump points them out as the "people with all the cameras."
"It's all happening very fast," Trump says of making America great again.
"I'd love if the cameras could show this crowd because it's rather incredible," Trump says.

@mj_lee WOW!
Schumer says McCain is "blessed" with an "internal gyroscope of right and wrong."
"Sometimes you need a little spark," Schumer says of getting back to bipartisanship.
"Women are in so many instances stronger than men," Schumer says of Murkowski and Collins.
"He's just a wonderful man," Schumer says of John McCain.
Schumer starts by saying he only has a few minutes before 12 p.m. Amtrak (which he says should stay well funded.)

Staff cleaning the gallery whisper amongst each other "it failed," one of them says.
Instead, McCain chatted with Murkowski and Collins, who was very invested in the talk and set down her pink purse! https://t.co/wE3IKrVbeL
There was a moment when Flake was clearly dispatched to try and change McCain's mind. He traded seats with Graham, but McCain not moved.

Covered a lot of things on the hill over the last five years. Think I'm gonna remember tonight clearer than anything before.
RT @Phil_Mattingly: Full McConnell statement on repeal failure: https://t.co/9KXjm7BdxW
In McConnell's address tonight, he was turned entirely to his conference. He didn't stand forward for the cameras. He was talking to them.
Murkowski and McCain endured the last hour together. Mostly next to one another on the Senate floor.
Leadership was really trying to convince Murkowski up until the last minute. Blunt, Thune huddled with her until minutes before the vote.
Very clear earlier Flake sat down and wanted to talk to McCain and then McCain just kept talking to Collins and Murkowski.
A little clapping there from McCain after Schumer speech.

This "skinny repeal" doesn't touch Medicaid. Doesn't touch it. Important to remember that major piece of information tonight.

Capito also has decided how she will vote, but won't say what she has decided.

Sen. John McCain said "right now I am voting 'no'" on skinny repeal unless he sees a guaranteed path to conference.
Graham says Meadows called him and said he was concerned there was chance House would bring "skinny repeal" directly to House floor.
Johnson says he needs a "guarantee" that whatever the senate would pass would go to conference.
"When we passed Obamacare in 2009, it split us."- McCain says.
McCain says that he needs to have assurances that this "skinny repeal" is going to go through conference "right now that is not the case"

Per @mj_lee, @LindseyGrahamSC calls skinny repeal as an end goal a "cop out," graham says it's a vehicle for conference and not final bill.

Cruz won't say whether he'd support "skinny repeal" per @mj_lee. Worried about death spiral? "This is a journey and we're not there yet."
Question now is will the pressure to do something be great enough to get members to take that leap? https://t.co/ATemucByXm
Dynamics on HC haven't changed. Members being asked to vote to debate a process that has an uncertain outcome. That's always been the case.
Goal today is to get onto debating the health care bill. Still unclear of where exactly they end up, but gets harder to vote "no" after MTP.
