Just saw @LindseyGrahamSC speak to the Allen County Republicans. What a delight! Smart and hilarious. We need more politicians like him. Come back any time Senator! Praying for your re-election in 2020.
@mtwatts1 @senrobportman Wouldn't it be better to read something intellectual? This isn't Oprah's book club for bored and uneducated women who sit at home all day.
@knigdan @senrobportman Awww...was the busy senator ignoring your personal messages? :(
@senrobportman My dad always had a great big book he was reading. No wonder I went on to pursue my MA in English! We have several thousand books in my home, and I am trying to fit in more.
@MattWalshBlog Intelligent and honest people don't use the term "anti-choice" because they know that being pro-life is not that simple. Of course, they also understand that a person can care about infants while still believing in personal responsibility.
@Msewick27 @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden It is stunning that the #metoo movement isn't all over Joe Biden. He's the creepiest creeper around...and he does it for all the world to see. I guess the left doesn't like cases that have actual evidence and credibility when they can scream that others are guilty without proof.
@JPatrickRealtor @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden I don't think the nation can handle that much South Carolina at once....
@Write_Sense @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP @SenJohnMcCain Graham appears to be fully conscious. 		Perhaps you mean conscience? But seeing as you don't know the meanings of the words, perhaps your comment is meaningless.		Just don't led Biden grope the women in your family.
@jon_mcconville @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP For real. I remember when Obama started it. No one could worship him like he worships himself.
@EdKrassen @LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden @realDonaldTrump @VP Democrats only said nice things about McCain because he was on their side. It is fact that Trump's policies have lowered unemployment rates--for minorities in particular. That enrages liberals. Trump has plenty of accomplishments for those honest enough to admit it.
@melissaeweiss @benshapiro @IlhanMN Everything about her religion and culture tells her to hate Israel and the Jewish people. It is what drives her. She doesn't care about the US. She wants to play a role in harming Israel. It is disheartening to have a terrorist in Congress.
@lyndseyfifield @kmac5999 @Ilhan Pro-terrorism and anti-Israel Trojan horse.
@secularprolife @March_for_Life I hope Jen Gunter isn't really a doctor because she's either ignorant or a manipulative liar. Considering her position, she's probably both.		That some abortions fail and babies survive cannot be honestly doubted as it is well-documented.
@SethAMandel @benshapiro She is a radical, pro-terrorism Muslim, which means her only goal in life is to destroy Israel and the Jewish people. She should be treated like the dangerous terrorist sympathizer and abetter she is.
@benshapiro Please don't insult intelligent people by counting Omar and Tlaib among them. Both are dedicated to their anti-Israel hatred, and neither is worthy of being considered intelligent or educated. Both subscribe to the worst evil on earth--radical Islam.
@realDailyWire Sounds like an abusive deadbeat bum....
@benshapiro I have a LOT of friends who are coders. Not a one of them majored in computer science or anything close to it. (Several studied history.) I think of coding as a way for a bright person to get work without returning to school for a new degree.
@allahpundit @benshapiro That's nice. People who actually DO matter--like the president--do recognize him.
@BFT_Podcast She must hear a constant buzzing in her ears when she talks or tweets then.
@tannerstake I am 40 now. I guess this means I still have plenty of time to accumulate millions of dollars and multiple extra homes! If it weren't for these pesky ethics....
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden I can't agree on this one. Why is he always groping and molesting women and young girls? I'd be disgusted if someone did that to me. We all should. I call him "Groper Biden."
@HashtagGriswold @benshapiro Pence is more than just a decent guy. He's a good man. I am divorced from a cheating, violent abuser. I wish I'd married a Christian man who respected me the way Pence respects his wife. THAT is decent.

@RealJamesWoods By "running into the ground," he must mean bringing record low employment to African Americans, but I can't see why he is so angry about it. He must be repeating what MSNBC told him to "think." Either way, I think people who address the president with ignorance and bile are scum.
I don't think it's that she cares more about herself. I think it's just because she is incredibly stupid and didn't understand the point of tax breaks to bring jobs. She thought NYC was giving Amazon money instead of taking less. https://t.co/6i0eLklLpV
@washingtonpost Why bother investigating and reporting when you can just write about conservatives pouncing, right?
@AOC I used to work for Job and Family Services issuing food stamps. The income guidelines are federal. Someone making Amazon wages would not qualify for them. You are ignorant and full of crap. As usual. Manipulating your equally ignorant fans.

@Acosta Imagine hating Trump so much that you have to look for FOUR pounds. Or analyze photos to guess his height and weight, and develop conspiracy theories that they aren't accurate even though a doctor certified them. That's nuts, kids.
@Acosta Four pounds is meaningless. It could be a difference in timing of bowel movements or glasses of water. SMH. I can't believe you thought it was worth mentioning.		Resting heart rate and BP look good.
@MarkYoungTruth @Acosta @realDonaldTrump I gained 8 lbs a couple winters ago when I still had a desk job. Cookies are good. I had to buy new pants. I guess Trump is doing better than I did.
@RealSaavedra I like you Joe @Sen_JoeManchin . You are sensible. You need to come the conservative side where we will appreciate you. The left mocks and has nothing but disdain for the people of your state. We won't call them deplorables like your Democratic colleagues and voters do.
@EWErickson @benshapiro A veto wouldn't be a smart idea since he's already said he'll approve it. Neither side wants to play that head game.
@benshapiro @realDailyWire He should use the funding he gets for now, and push for more when the initial money is running out.
@GovMikeHuckabee I think it is time she invested in a nice, green bicycle.
@BreitbartNews BS. The right has always supported Judaism and Israel. The Christian right in particular is taught and encouraged to honor the Jewish people. At the UN, it was conservative Haley against the rest of the anti-Semitic world. We have Israel's back...and the left has Palestine/Islam.
@realTylerZed I reported someone on Facebook who said he wanted to shoot Trump's brains out, and posted a drawing of it. Facebook determined it did not violate their rules. SMH.

@GoldenEscalator @senrobportman I'm one of his constituents, and I want more funding for the parks. So yes, Rob Portman speaks for me and my family in this matter.
@senrobportman I'm not rich, or even comfortable; however, my family visits the National Parks as often as possible, and the entrance fee is a bargain. I'd gladly pay more to help fund them. It's far cheaper than an amusement park.
@PrisonPlanet @prageru I've never seen any single mom look that well-rested and fashionable.
@BernieSanders Or, instead of trying to violate the Constitution and all gun owners, we could acknowledge the reality that hundreds of people ignored the blaring red flags of a boy who was born to be a sociopath.

@GandSMortgage @KrisKevel @BryanKBaskin @AOC Oh, so 25,000 low paying service jobs will magically appear?! Super! Exchange good Amazon jobs for low paying, part-time service jobs. Great idea! Maybe every intellectually challenged bar tender can be in Congress!
@oab999 @ronwikso @AOC Don't blame that dumpster fire on the Republicans! AOC is representative of the far left. Remember, Elizabeth Warren is also excited that all these jobs were lost. Liberals are a disaster for the economy.
@DrumsjoeC @AOC Stop insulting rocks!
@AOC You are cheering the fact that your constituents just lost thousands of decent-paying jobs. You understand that, right? It is about the most stupid thing you could cheer for. Entirely foolish. I guess they will have to aim for lower paying bar tending jobs and prostitution.
@gaye_gallops @freightfrogger Minorities tend to vote by color, while white people vote by agenda while trying to be more open-minded. In this case, they voted against all of our best interest because now their terror-sympathizer is in OUR Congress.
@Education4Libs I've had my IQ legitimately tested above the 99th percentile, (to join a high IQ society,) and I can't count the number of liberals who have called me "stupid" or 	"white trash," or whatever else here on Twitter. When I vote conservative, I'm also voting against their culture.
@RandPaul Very romantic. Here I was just going to stay home and watch a Hallmark movie, but now I have delightful reading material!
@RealJamesWoods I was interested to note which three Democrat senators voted for Barr. Sinema is proving to be saner than expected, and Manchin should just join our side. He's too sane for the left. Besides, liberals mock his state with a cruel disdain. Same with Jones.
@RealJamesWoods AND now they won't be able to work for Amazon and earn better wages. She's just an all around disaster.
AOC is so incredibly stupid, that she fought AGAINST good jobs for her constituents. How can you want people to make better wages while pushing to make sure they have fewer options? She is truly intellectually challenged. I hope her voters know how much this hurts them. https://t.co/BZapPgd2vF
@RealJamesWoods Guys what guys? AOC CAN indeed be even more stupid than we previously thought!
@MattCasdorph I think he sometimes contributes to Psychology Today--which is often mocked by serious psychologists. He is a "professional," but not a sane or educated one!
@MattCasdorph I encountered him some years ago in a support group for survivors of sociopaths. He was spamming the group against the stated rules, and didn't care. When called on it, he went insane. It became very clear that he was a raging narcissist. Not every psychologist is mentally well.

@TomFitton @IlhanMN @JordanSchachtel Lobbyists are great...as long as they aren't pro-Israel? Got it.
@Imamofpeace @SheilaMei33 @IlhanMN @realDonaldTrump The way she spoke to Jewish Elliot Abrams on the House floor was vile. She was seething with hatred because he was Jewish. It was appallingly disrespectful and disgusting. She has no place in our Congress with that behavior. She needs to grow up.
@Tweets4MAGA @SheilaMei33 So when she claimed that her anti-Semitic remarks were only about opposing lobbyists, she was a liar. She specifically attacked a group that works to protect Israel, and spends far less than most lobbying groups--including Planned Parenthood. Double standard due to anti-Semitism.
@chowdallas @kmac5999 @IlhanMN Given her intense anti-Semitism, I believe it is a threat. I saw how she treated Jewish Elliot Abrams yesterday....
@ToumsyBell @8rareddy @ElizLanders @SpeakerPelosi @VP Nonsense. It wasn't about lobbyists in general. She made a specific attack on a relatively small time lobbyist looking out for Israel. Her target was Israel--not lobbyists. That was her later rationalization. Let's see her attack Planned Parenthood lobbyists who spend far more.
@8rareddy @ElizLanders @SpeakerPelosi @VP It is not a first offense. She has been openly anti-Semitic for years, and was previously warned by other groups. After her "apology," she continued and escalated her anti-Jewish behavior.
@ElizLanders @SpeakerPelosi @VP Way to distract from Omar's disrespectful, appalling, and anti-Semitic behavior that has continued to escalate since the "apology."
When the extremely wealthy politician who seems to have accumulated far more money than her salary would allow tells you that she is going to help you by punishing the bad rich people. it shouldn't take much thought to realize you are being conned and used as a pawn.
@realDailyWire Odd. I always say he looks like he wants to punch a woman with his perpetually angry face. I can't see him wanting to choose a woman willingly for...well, pretty much anything.
@BreitbartNews Test to determine if you are a good potential Democrat candidate:	Are you nuts? Do you commit crime and get away with it? Do you push ideology that would destroy our economy? Are you anything but a white male? Do you refuse to put America first? Do you love taxes? If so....
We need to make this happen. Contact your representatives because her vile behavior is not acceptable in Congress. The way she spoke to Abrams on the House floor was reprehensible. Her anti-Semitism is increasing. She does not stand for decent Americans. https://t.co/MtYnUDSgUN
@grgbkr37 @RoseDC11 That image includes some of the worst representatives in Congress. Intellectually challenged and uneducated people, anti-Semites, mentally unstable people, terrorism supporters. Scary group there. None are fit for their positions.
@joelpollak @SheilaMei33 @IlhanMN @Ilhan She doesn't want peace, justice, or human rights. She is a radical Muslim and it shows in her extreme anti-Semitism. She wants the destruction of the Jewish people and Israel. Abrams is Jewish, so she treated him with disgusting disrespect and disdain.
@Pedal2DMetals @SheilaMei33 @GOP @IlhanMN @RepMattGaetz @sendavidperdue @realDonaldTrump @RepBuddyCarter @AustinScottGA08 @Jim_Jordan @SpeakerPelosi @1980reagan It is almost guaranteed that she has ties to terrorist cells. She should be monitored closely. She's obviously too dangerous for the committee.
@repocrazio @ADL Soros is just plain evil. That wouldn't change no matter what his religious or cultural heritage. Realizing Soros himself is a bad guy is very different from Omar's hatred of all Jewish people and her desire to destroy Israel.
@marklevinshow @SheilaMei33 Ted Kennedy was a killer, but he seemed like a decent guy in comparison to this evil woman. The way she speaks to Abrams is despicable, and we know she is doing it because he is Jewish. She should be admonished and removed from her committees for this "questioning" alone.
@jaynordlinger @JebBush She doesn't care what he's done. Her religious hatred for Israel and the Jewish people is at the heart of her behavior.
@ChelseaClinton @IlhanMN Nonsense. She continued her anti-Semitism just today with her extremely rude, disrespectful, and accusatory attacks on Elliot Abrams. She hates Israel and Judaism to her core. She wasn't "cured" in one day.

@RealJamesWoods I hate seeing her face. You can see the disdain in her dead, soulless eyes.
@BreitbartNews Too bad we can't convict her of treason.
@megdogwuff @RoseDC11 From Omar...whose entire life goal seems to be the hatred of the Jewish people and working towards the destruction of Israel. She can falsely accuse the president, but her actions show us the truth about her. She is a danger to our society.
@GOPLeader Now what do we do to get Ilhan Omar--the radical anti-Semitism Trojan Horse--out of Congress before she becomes more of a national security threat? She makes a mockery of our civilized nation and our Congress. She is unfit to represent sane Americans.
@michaeljknowles @IlhanMN The whole world is watching Omar's extreme anti-Semitism. Her fellow terror-sympathizers are loving it, but the decent and civilized people are horrified. The ONLY reasonable choice is for Nancy Pelosi to remove her from her committees. Her hatred for Jews is a danger.
Omar's behavior towards Elliot Abrams--a Jewish man nearly 35 years older and with far more credibility--shows what she thinks of the Jewish people. It was disgusting. How dare an unqualified terror-sympathizer talk to any grown and experienced adult that way? Pure anti-Semitism
@PaulieD55 @RoseDC11 AOC is clearly intellectually challenged and delusional. Omar is also barely literate, but she is pure evil. AOC is a dangerous fool, but Omar is willfully malicious.

@Duckyv72 @Reblyn1963 While I agree with the sentiment and I know assistance is abused, I also used to work for Job and Family Services, and I know these numbers are not accurate.

@MatthewJshow @RealJamesWoods I doubt it. Her constituents knew what she stood for from the start. They knew she was anti-Semitic, just like Rashida Tlaib's voters know she is also anti-Semitic.
@RealJamesWoods It is a deflective non-apology. Guaranteed, she won't change or stop spouting anti-Semitism. Hatred for Israel is the core of her being and her religion.

@RealJamesWoods It frustrates me when I see politicians I respect responding to her attacks on them or referencing her like she matters. She truly isn't worth the response or time. She's unintelligent, uneducated, delusional, and simply bratty. She is the embarrassment of congress.
How can Republicans regain a majority in the House? Introduce and pass a bill requiring a minimum IQ score to serve in congress. Buh bye AOC, and a whole slew of other delusional socialists!
AOC thinks everyone is mocking her Green New Deal because it is so good.  SMH.
@chixbriter @Reblyn1963 The fact that AOC was given a high school diploma and a college degree shows how badly schools are failing. I am confident that standardized tests and IQ tests would show her true intellectual ability is well below average.

@amy_elfstrand @LindseyGrahamSC It would be entirely foolish to think the bill is only about "saving the planet." But, I suppose "entirely foolish" describes AOC's naive and ignorant, but very emotional base.

@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Liberals have their pitchforks out. They don't care about facts. His followers will buy every lie he tells.
@EricpNBC12 @NBC12 I wonder how much Northam paid for this phony story?
@jordanbpeterson Having children leads to opportunities lost. It's not unfair. It's not fair. It just is. It's hard for the care giving parent to give 100% to both kids and career, and it's really hard to keep perfect attendance when kids get sick or have weekday appointments.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Pelosi is such a liar and manipulator. Her party repeatedly refused to vote to pay federal workers, they refused to meet with Republicans, they refused to compromise. She doesn't care one bit about Americans. She's an arrogant and petty narcissist.
@RealJamesWoods As an animal lover, I agree with this, but it seems so discordant with the huge push for late-term abortion last week. Why can't we protect animals AND babies?
@brithume @DineshDSouza Yeah...she didn't love him. The things she did to get ahead in politics are so nasty. I don't know how some women can use sex to get ahead. I'd rather be broke and celibate.
@jonhart123 There are professionally published failure rates. As long as kids, (or adults,) think they are 100% protected, they are in for a surprise. The typical use failure rates are high. The pill is 7% and condoms 13%. Very different from "perfect" usage rates.		https://t.co/I4xxj77AZU
@jonhart123 Odd. I practiced it as a teenager, and it worked for me. The foolish thing is to tell kids that birth control will always protect them. I know multiple people who got pregnant when a condom broke or birth control failed. All birth control has a failure rate. Kids should be warned

@Ryan80587915 @E4LDeev @Education4Libs @AOC @IlhanMN Public schools don't need more money. They need less bureaucracy and real standards.

@Ryan80587915 @E4LDeev @Education4Libs @AOC @IlhanMN Raise standards.

I went through a teaching credential program and was horrified at how low the average was.
@SenSchumer Does Schumer think his voters are so stupid they can't get to a poll within twelve hours on election day or during the many days of early voting? Let alone figure out an absentee ballot? If someone can't handle ALL those chances, maybe they really are stupid.
@HimJlevy @JustinB38905980 @RockTheFred @SenSchumer If for some reason, you truly are working over twelve hours in a row on election day and can't make it to the polls between 7 am and 7pm, (or later,) you always had days or weeks of early voting, as well as absentee voting. If you aren't smart enough to vote during that time....
@JamesKirkLives @SenSchumer And if a citizen can't handle that, they always have days or weeks of early voting and absentee voting. Voting is already stunningly easy for Americans. To pretend it isn't is a lie.
@TheLazySlackerX @SenSchumer Many democrats--including Stacey Abrams--have outright stated that they think everyone should be allowed to vote--here legally or not. Citizens or not. Even if the wiser politicians don't state it, that is *exactly* what they want.
@SenSchumer It is already easy for Americans to vote. Early voting, absentee ballots, at least twelve hours of open polls on election day.... It's hard to mess that up. What you want is to make it easier for people who aren't supposed to be voting to vote. Your statement is disingenuous.
@dbongino Thank God for Lindsey Graham who is asking and saying everything the normal people outside of Congress are thinking.
@RudyGiuliani @jedder217 I'm not even sure he qualifies to be called a "man" at this point.
I am stunned that Ralph Northam hasn't stepped down yet. He is completely clueless about his image right now.
@AlisQ45 @RoseDC11 @SpeakerPelosi It is 100% impossible to be a Christian and support abortion. It is nearly as impossible to be a Christian liberal. What an oxymoron.
@RepLeeZeldin @kmac5999 The adults get it. Most of the followers for AOC, Omar, Tlaib, etc... are ignorant and angry kids who just want, want, want and believe socialist propaganda. They suffer from the Dunning Kruger Effect. Omar has no place in civilized American society. Anti-Semitism is vile.

@TomExposesLibs @Reblyn1963 How much easier can voting be? We get at least twelve hours on election day, plus plenty of time for absentee votes and early voting. It need not be a month long marathon. What the left really want is to make it easier for people to cast illegal votes.

@Bmac0507 @benshapiro Heck, I like what he has to say lately, and I'm really far from being a Democrat.
@Heminator @benshapiro Most liberals support abortion up to birth, but many of them are clever enough to avoid saying it or commenting on it. Look how many of them pretended they didn't know about Northam's comments. Oh yes, they knew.
@SHP1972 @michaeljknowles Your argument was that the infant wasn't an infant because it hadn't been born yet...and yet Northam clearly said "infant" more than once and recognized that it was already born. Doh. Better change the goalpost!
@DandD04 @freightfrogger Dumb huh? I have one of these and you don't. :)		I suspect logic is just hard for you, so you strike out and call others "dumb." Bless your little tiny heart. You suffer from the Dunning Kruger Effect and don't even know it. https://t.co/gVCjVwS4uw
@SHP1972 @michaeljknowles No wait, he literally said "infant" more than once. So..."infant" it is.		His words:	https://t.co/WHf2UR0chC
@EWErickson @benshapiro His conduct lately has not shown any improvement in character. He pushed to kill infants a few days ago, he admitted to blackface yesterday, he changed his story and admitted to a different instance of blackface today. He is a flip-flopping, lying disaster.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @Alyssa_Milano You know, you could have left off "before you tweet" at the end of that first sentence.
@KrajicekTravis @michaeljknowles Here, let's have Northam describe it:	https://t.co/WHf2UR0chC		He says he can resuscitate the already born infant, (his wording,) and they can have a discussion about whether or not it gets to live or die.
@SHP1972 @michaeljknowles In Northam's infamous video, he referred to the mother and the BABY that had already been born. He said the baby would be kept comfortable while they decided whether to kill it or not.		So yeah, "infant" applies. Cute attempt to deflect, though.
This idiot has been tweeting all day about how racist conservatives are. (With a couple posts condemning Northam in there.) Gotta deflect, right? https://t.co/QpXMbMauz7
@mattmfm @JerryDunleavy And yet this jackass has posted anti-Trump "whataboutism" all day to deflect from his candidate's overt and proven racism. SMH. He's so filled with rage against Trump that he can't use logic.

@AFBaylorBear @KathyKLTran I'm sure they will enjoy eternity in hell together.
@KathyKLTran Great! You go with him. You stood there with a sociopathic smile and admitted you would allow infanticide. No remorse. No doubt. You are sick and have no position in civilized society.
@bixbot If that confuses you, then you weren't intellectually capable of attending college. Did someone stand over you and force you to sign your promissory notes? Did you not understand the meaning of "loan?" Too many dumb kids going to college. Uggh.

@RealJamesWoods I'd be broke and celibate for the rest of my life before I'd sleep with someone as nasty as Willie Brown for money and career advancement.
@RealJamesWoods Abortion is the biggest killer of black babies. Now we know why Northam was pushing so hard for abortion. I wonder if the reason he won't resign is that his lieutenant governor is black?
Nope. He didn't put the Michael Jackson blackface photos in the yearbook. https://t.co/OJlFDJa8OD
@realDonaldTrump That was very ugly race filled with libel and slander from Northam. And now we learn that Northam has the real history of racism. Too bad Gillespie can't have a "do-over" since he was unfairly defamed by a guy in KKK robes.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump No one is limiting "access" to birth control. Every drug store sells condoms. The dollar stores sell them. Gas stations sell them. The sleazy ones have vending machines. Grocery stores sell them. There is plenty of access. You are confusing "access" with "free." So disingenuous.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump It shouldn't be a question for sane people, but it is pure bullshit to claim that "every single doctor" would help the baby survive. Remember Kermit Gosnell? He certainly wasn't alone in his actions or his beliefs.
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Except Democrats literally have introduced bills to do just that. New York approved and cheered for it.		SMH.
@realDonaldTrump Uh oh...Trump spoke against Northam's behavior. Now the left is going to have to figure things out. Do they "resist" agreeing with Trump and support Northam's racism? Or do they speak against Northam's racism even though Trump did the same? Painful decision for them!
Ralph Northam: I know I admitted to blackface, but that wasn't me after all. To distract from that story, I will now admit to a completely different incident of blackface which will now lead you to realize I did it more than once. And I won't resign because my successor is black.
@RightHookUSA @9NEWS Typical narcissistic, Dunning-Kruger liberal jackass.
@smod4real I think she was trying to hide behind that screen. It's the smartest thing she could do.
@Solmemes1 @MattCasdorph To be fair though, she didn't discriminate against them. She just insulted their intelligence and defrauded others by pretending to be one of them.
@tedcruz Howard Schultz, though...how quick they were to look for reasons to degrade him. As a self-made leftist, he destroys their socialist agenda.
@tedcruz I tested using the "news" search on Google the other day. Most conservative politicians' names came back with a majority negative articles featuring one-sided manipulation. Most liberal politicians's names brought fluff and praise, but little substance and no criticism.

This is what sociopathy looks like. Kathy Tran. https://t.co/i8tJymVLUg
@RealJamesWoods And he's still too arrogant to resign. His latest backtrack and fake story just made his situation exponentially worse. Now he will be remembered as one of the most spectacular political disasters of all time, and he deserves all of it.
@TimRunsHisMouth We all know that's not true, but if indeed he was wrongly included as a Klansman, any sane person would have put up a huge fight to get that taken care of when it happened.
@RepLeeZeldin He needs to hide out in a remote cabin in the woods where he can't keep saying idiotic things.
Political Public Relations specialists are going to be using Ralph Northam as a negative case study for years to come.		*Don't do this, kids!*
Ralph Northam is exhibiting exactly how NOT to survive a political crisis. If he has friends or family who love him, they need to get him to resign and step away from all media for at least a year. He needs to pull a Kevin Spacey instead of fanning the flames.
@michaelbdeane @kurteichenwald @GovernorVA @edokeefe They can't find any. Haven't you seen the lunatics they are pushing for president?
@GovernorVA Thank you for allowing us to watch the must stunning, amazing, and ridiculous destruction of a political career and reputation in all time. You are a disaster, and you don't have the sense to stop digging your hole because you are so arrogant.
@GovMikeHuckabee He just gets worse and worse. This is a disaster.
Scumbag Ralph Northam has changed his story about the photo he admitted he was in, and still refuses to resign despite leaders on both sides, (and the majority of Virginians,) calling for him to step down.	https://t.co/fam5jXwSfG
@michaeljknowles True, but the left adores infanticide, so the only way Virginia gets rid of him is by using the racism expose. Whatever it takes. Unfortunately, his replacement will be worse, but he might have learned a lesson and may decide to avoid infanticide promotion for a while.
If Catholic white boys are falsely accused of "disrespecting" the drifter who antagonized them, the left wants their heads. If a liberal wants to kill full-term babies, meh. If a liberal poses in KKK robes, they notice, but it's still not as bad as a white kid in a red hat....
@Sopeman4 @DrOakley1689 @gcu Bring people "together" by eliminating other view points. Sounds like the opposite of education to me.

@RealJamesWoods I have no doubt CNN did that on purpose knowing their ignorant viewers would rush to hate Republicans. Even if they issue a lame correction, the original seeds are already sown. (Just as with the Covington smear campaign.) The lies stick.
I just got up. Sad to see that racist, murderous Ralph Northam is still governor of Virginia. It must be because he doesn't want the black lieutenant governor to replace him.
@DiamondandSilk Oh he knows. He also knows who the other person is.
@RealSaavedra @atensnut Tran should resign next. She is despicable.
If only leftists hated Ralph Northam's racism as much as they hate white boys in red hats.
@MatthewCarro1l @willwilkinson @benshapiro @cjane87 Research has consistently shown that personality traits are set at a young age--even as early as three. There are dozens of psychological studies on this topic. People mellow, but they rarely do an about-face. Here is a fairly simple overview: https://t.co/KdLUyS9weI
@RickS0222 @RoseDC11 @KamalaHarris @RalphNortham @POTUS Liberals label any white guy who doesn't like illegal immigration a "racist," while the real racists are running around in their own party. Hypocrites.
If your party is screaming to "resist" economic success and kill newborns, and is making up false stories about Supreme Court nominees, while protecting a man who thinks dressing in black face and KKK robes is funny...you are on the wrong side.
@TheReady1775 @OMiquel4 Obama and I have very different ideas about integrity. His version is distorted.
@BellaInxs2 I think she's clinging to life and near the end, but liberals are unwilling to accept reality.
@RealSaavedra He always look angry like he wants to hit a woman.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Abrams fought very hard to steal and election and refused to acknowledge the real winner. She fought to count unauthorized votes and even admitted she wanted to let illegals vote. The Democrats admire her dedication to their cause and will reward her efforts.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery There are actual pictures and hard proof of Northam's racism. The rest of those examples are more cases of stupid word choice.
Don't let the Northam expose distract us from this evil woman:	https://t.co/8aJY9VavO5	Kathy Tran calmly supported infanticide *during* birth.
@RealMAGASteve @TryAgain1955 @KamalaHarris More recently, Harris bullied and gas lighted William Barr and tried to minimize his experience by emphasizing how long ago it was. Why do leftists hate their elders so much?
@E4LDeev @Education4Libs @AOC @IlhanMN Bad schools, poor education, and areas filled with poverty. AOC's constituents are ignorant and angry about their positions. All they can do is rant that the rich folks "owe" them. A charismatic buffoon came along and promised them the impossible, and they fell for it.

@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @Montel_Williams Liberals don't know what "racist" means. They throw it out as a way to shut down conversation, and they misuse the term by labeling anyone with whom they disagree. In the meantime, research shows it is liberals who talk down to minorities and assume they are less intelligent.

@RealJamesWoods My best memories of my dad include his constantly having a big history book by his side, and his taking me on trips to historical sites. I model the same for my kids--to value reading, history, and curiosity about the world around us. It makes us better. (And more conservative!)
@superyayadize @RoseDC11 @GovernorVA Sometimes I suspect more decent people never think to play dirty, and unfortunately, it hurts them.
Virginia is one of my favorite states to visit. I love the Blue Ridge Parkway and Skyline Drive, and I love the historical sites. I'm not sure I want to visit again until Ralph @GovernorVA is out of office. He and Tran have made a mockery of their state this week.
@thebradfordfile @kmac5999 She is following popular opinion because she wants to be president. She's not demanding his resignation because she thinks a Democrat has done anything wrong.
@brendaroun @RealJamesWoods Maybe Ralph Northam will keep her comfortable while they decide what to do.
@TomFitton This sounds pretty serious. Will it warrant an early morning FBI raid with CNN on hand to record it all?
@BreitbartNews SMH.		She keeps making anti-Semitic comments and then can't understand why people don't like it.
@RealJamesWoods I feel the same way about her as I feel about my ex-husband. I would never wish her harm, but if she dies, I guess I could find the bright side. It seems crazy to think the left is hiding her death, but they are crazy, soooo..... I think we need a wellness check.
@M2_MeasureTwice @RealJamesWoods @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer @JoeBiden @LeaderHoyer I like old white guys! https://t.co/lCKxwHj0K5
@RealJamesWoods Why are liberals so intent on minimizing people as "old?"
@GovernorVA Do the kids in this photo, (and their parents,) know about your racist yearbook photos?
Stunning that Ralph Northam maliciously smeared his opponent as a racist, when Northam himself was the proven racist. What a dishonest predator!
@seanhannity If she keeps talking and spreading her hatred of the Jewish people and Israel, she can only hurt herself more.
Kavanaugh drank as a teen, so leftists claimed he was an alcoholic and rapist. Northam expressed a desire to be a drunk and posed in racist garb as an adult...and yet some leftists still support him. Are they entirely without morals? Oh wait...I know that answer.
@allidoisowen Yes.
@AnCatDubh1980 @GovernorVA He's become a "GOP talking point" because he stands for everything your party stands for...and he got exposed.
@GovernorVA How entirely narcissistic and selfish to decide NOT to resign.
@GovernorVA Scum bag. Even your immoral fellow baby killers realize you've gone too far. Your peers want you to step down too.
@RealJamesWoods @CNN @nytimes Maybe another dramatic raid on an old white guy related to Trump?
@prageru He is a disaster, and the only correct response is his immediate resignation.
RT @NikkiHaley: The people of Virginia deserve better representation than what they got this week.
@Jamit48877795 @TomFitton Covington boy didn't actually do anything wrong. Northam clearly did.
@willwilkinson @benshapiro @cjane87 More likely, he is the same exact person, but he learned to mask his true colors to be elected. Adults do not change personalities.
Leftists rationalizing and minimizing the horror of Northam's behavior by crying "Trump!" 		SMH.
@myeucatastrophe @SenatorTimScott @GovernorVA There are photos of Trump in black face or dressed as a Klansman? Wow.
@SenatorTimScott @GovernorVA Between this and standing by infanticide, it is clear he is a psychopath with no conscience.
Ralph Northam issued a lame apology because he was outed as a racist, but he stands by his support of infanticide. This is what evil looks like. He has no conscience.
@MikevWUSA @CorporaCallosa Sorry he got caught....
@STACEYDUBOIS4 @RoseDC11 @staceyabrams She will talk about how bad things are anyway. The left doesn't care about reality, and the media won't fact-check her.
@DaveJHalstead1 @ABC7Annalysa @benshapiro @GovernorVA The left will rationalize it just like they minimize all of their evil.
@RepLeeZeldin Omar stands on the side of evil.
@_barretme @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN We know she is anti-Semitic because she repeatedly makes anti-Semitic comments. Guaranteed she agrees with the hate mail but she will dance around admitting it. Again.
@MarisaKabas @RepLeeZeldin @IlhanMN What a mockery to call her his equal. She is not fit for her position.
@RepLeeZeldin Omar and her fans are simply ignorant, hypocritical, and evil.
@IlhanMN A woman who constantly makes anti-Semitic comments and claims not to know why they are offensive pretends to be against bigotry? What a laugh!
@allahpundit @benshapiro It's disturbing that anyone that dumb and lacking in ethical standards even got into medical school. He was never morally qualified to be a doctor. What a mockery of the profession he is.

@GovernorVA Did you post this with a straight face after advocating to kill babies during birth? Does your heart actually beat?
Northam is going to step down, right? Or will the left and the media hold him to a different standard than what they allowed for Kavanaugh or Covington? https://t.co/RS1Jj3aJOV
If you type a liberal politician's name into Google and choose the "news" link, you will find almost all positive articles from MSM. If you type in a conservative's name, you will find almost entirely negative and biased articles. Regular people aren't getting straight news.
@Kimmerztweets @RoseDC11 Of course it was stolen. McSally was in the lead for days and Sinema suddenly took over in a matter of hours. "Found" votes always seem to favor the left. How odd....
Pelosi has made it clear that she and the left are more interested in being petty and mocking the president than getting any work done. They most certainly don't care about what is best for Americans. This feels like junior high, except she's about 80 years too old for it.
@DineshDSouza Like all con-artists, she is more upset about being caught than about the lies she told.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump They don't just hate Trump. They hate everyone who voted for him.
I just saw a Facebook post claiming it is "classist" to expect teachers to be educated and able to use basic third grade grammar.		This is how liberals are destroying schools. They think it is "classist" to have educational standards. SMH.
@conservativma @RoseDC11 Pretty much all of these conditions--including "mental health," are discernible long before 40 weeks. Too bad we can't consider the mental disorders of the politicians and doctors who wouldn't flinch at killing a baby as it's being born.
Abortion has been legal for decades, and pregnancy lasts long enough for a person to decide whether or not they want a baby, so it's bizarre that the left is pushing so hard to abort babies as they are being born. It is not necessary by their own laws.
@michaeljknowles Lol, that was literally my first thought.   		So, is it?
@michaeljknowles @nytimes @GovernorVA @NYGovCuomo And this is how we get the term "fake news."
@jimgeraghty @benshapiro He always looks like he's about to punch a woman. He has anger issues.
@benshapiro The dollar store sells name brand condoms. Why are these leftists always whining about access to cheap birth control? They have it already. What they really want is for someone else to pay for the better kind.
Wouldn't thinking twice require that they think in the first place? https://t.co/dvl8ej3Gfl
Oh yes. This must be what liberals are "resisting." https://t.co/FR28i4PMlX
I  think I've heard more about people being harassed for wearing MAGA hats than I've heard about people in MAGA hats harassing others.
@GW1stPOTUS @RoseDC11 Takei is never logical or bright. The real problem is that Harris was given political appointments in exchange for sex. She isn't in politics because she was qualified; she's moved up by having sex with a married man and getting favors. That should bother any ethical person.
@KyleKashuv What is truly disturbing is that Democrats aren't equally horrified. Any decent, non-sociopath should be stunned at the idea.
Made me laugh... https://t.co/5ckM6dXmZY
@Noremacsmada Since when does the left want to "work together to come to consensus?" What she really means is they want to keep beating down anyone Trump nominates.
@1rebmun1 @RealJamesWoods As I said: Patterns. If this came out of the blue, it would be sketchy--as the false accusations against Kavanaugh were. But this guy is already being sued, has been investigated, and has a history, (a la Bill Cosby.) He has repeat issues.		WTF does being gay have to do with it?
@RealJamesWoods RBG is on the wrong side of decency all too often.
@RealJamesWoods Daniels went straight to minimizing the alleged victim and his, (lack of,) singing talent. That is classic abuser. But even more telling is his patterns that have been documented even though he's never been held accountable. As a DV advocate, these things make me believe Schultz.
@benshapiro We aren't "painting" them as radical; we are acknowledging the radical and horrifying behaviors they exposed on their own.
I've always liked old white guys.		https://t.co/lCKxwHj0K5
@RealJamesWoods The moment someone types tRump instead of "Trump," they have self-identified as intellectually challenged, (not to mention perpetually childish.)
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery If she wants to be paid what she is actually worth, she is in for a rude awakening.
@smalltownandrew @SusieJustsayin The left is anti-Israel and full of anti-Semitism. Her party won't care.
@jordanbpeterson @DrNinaMReich @benshapiro She doesn't have to hear or think about logic and facts if she just labels them "hate speech." The exaggerated label allows her to automatically dismiss anything he says as not worthy of hearing.
@MattWalshBlog My main grocery store usually has them on sale for 69 cents a dozen. Sometimes they go up to $1.19. The prices vary between stores, but eggs are always a cheap, versatile, and delicious protein source.
@henryrodgersdc @benshapiro @GovernorVA Oh they heard them. And most of the left supports the same. They are just crafty enough to realize they can't outright say it. They will continue to push for legislation that makes late abortion easier and more common, though.
The average American earns just over $40k a year. Since some of the new Democrats in Congress are worried about income equality, perhaps they should tax themselves at 70% or more since at $174k they make more than four times the average. (And they aren't even earning it.)
@seanhannity She looked bad for co-sponsoring it, so she tried to back out. Now she looks really stupid for not reading it. Either way, she's unfit for her position.
@JerylBier @benshapiro @verumserum She's okay with it, but oops, it's illegal in her state. She has still made it clear that she supports and promotes infanticide. Too bad about that pesky law.
@verumserum @benshapiro She didn't misspeak. She stated what she believes and supports, then tried to back track when it didn't go over well. 		She may have children, but she is no mother.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro It's interesting that she thinks her baby is worthy, but it's okay to kill other babies. Considering how many black babies are aborted, this seems like racism.
@DiamondandSilk He got into some "trouble" some other way and made up a story to avoid embarrassment.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro Pure sociopath rationalization. He's sick and dangerous.
@RepLeeZeldin @benshapiro Ilhan Omar is little more than an arrogant, anti-semitic sociopath.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro She is deflecting--most likely because she knows that publicly agreeing with him will hurt her a little. I say "a little," because her supporters are mentally unwell and most probably support infanticide anyway. They are the party of evil.
@realDonaldTrump At this point--after this week of liberals cheering for infanticide--anyone who still supports the party is simply evil.
@RepSmucker That woman belongs in the psychiatric ward of a prison--not the government. She's sick.
Ralph Northam should step down. He is an example of all that is evil. Kathy Tran too. We don't need murderous, conscienceless sociopaths advocating to murder newborns.
@Ginny__Wilson @GovernorVA Just wait until he's rotting in hell. He'll really be toast then!
@TinaHol27450287 @just_mindy @GovernorVA Statistics show that about 4% of the population consists of sociopaths. They don't have problems with evil like this.
@GovernorVA You are worried about guns but cool with infanticide? Did you experience oxygen deprivation or are you just evil?
@GovernorVA Stop gas lighting. Your comments are available for all to hear. No has to "insinuate" anything because we can hear it first-hand. You are a very sick monster, and you shouldn't be allowed near any children. Such pure evil in your beliefs.
@DLoesch I'd say a self-made billionaire has already worked his way up and demonstrated leadership qualities and work ethic. AOC has so much trouble with basic logic and false equivalencies.
@TryAgain1955 I don't think she's ever thought anything through....
@Liz_Wheeler What a very sick and evil woman. At that point, the baby has to come out no matter what. Why murder it? She must be a total sociopath to remain so calm and disinterested at the idea of killing a baby during labor.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Her logic is flawed. A feed filled with liberal bashing makes a person racist? Is liberal a race now?
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @RepAdamSchiff The nonsensical have many fans too. I mean, have you seen what passes for popular music these days? Or have you seen how many people buy AOC's illogical posts? Numbers do not equal quality, integrity, or accuracy. They equal mass insanity and unreasonable mob thinking.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @RepAdamSchiff For days after that Buzzfeed nonsense, he left the link on his Twitter feed. It might even still be there. I don't think he cares about evidence, honesty, or facts.
The left is now trying to delay William Barr's confirmation. I can't imagine what insanity they will pull to delay the confirmation of RBGs replacement. I hope Senators Graham and Collins are ready to call out nonsense and introduce reason.
@michaeljknowles She must have impressed them with her persistence in trying to overcome and steal a valid election.
@SenKevinCramer @RJC She is a very sick woman, but look at all the other sick folks who defend or minimize her disturbing ideas.
@AOC Serving for twenty years IS earning it. It is hard WORK and contribution, which is more meaningful than "hard organizing." It is stability and quality over personality. Yes, they deserve it far more than you do. Wearing out shoes spreading nonsense isn't contributing to society.
@RealJamesWoods Thought most know not to admit it, most of the Democrats also support illegals voting. It goes hand in hand with wanting open borders.
@dcexaminer Better than sleeping with a much older married man to get unfair advantages and start a political career?		Yeah, I think we are better than this.
@marieFranckowi1 @benshapiro @IlhanMN AOC is ignorant and intellectually challenged. Omar is just pure evil.
@benshapiro It's stunning that anti-Semite, pro-Isis, pro-Palestinian terrorism Ilhan Omar--who represents the worst kind of evil--dared tweet about the Holocaust and dared blame it on the right. The hatred of Israel is most definitely coming from the left--from people like her or the UN.

@charliekirk11 Because liberals don't play fair. There are studies showing the Republican politicians are far more likely to compromise for both sides, while Democrats rarely do. The right will try to work together, but the left has nothing but disdain for conservatives.
When liberals refused to compromise in any way, they showed the other half of us that they think we are worthless and our needs don't matter. Note that the conservatives were willing to compromise and tried, but the left stuck by party lines. Thank God for the Electoral College.
@MattWalshBlog I follow a Libertarian party page that constantly trashes anyone who strays from the party line, and says they aren't real Libertarians. I think that a bit hypocritical considering what the party is supposed to stand for.
@DaveWhittum I think he will. That's why the left has launched a smear campaign against him. So far their "compromised" theory hasn't gone anywhere because decent humans were appalled by it, but they will try again.
@AMike4761 @SusieJustsayin Universities have lowered standards so much that kids graduating are no longer the best and the brightest. They are usually average kids who learned to parrot their liberal instructors but were never truly intelligent and will never become educated. Just look at AOC and her fans.
The real "manufactured crisis" in this country is the one the media and liberals have created by constantly looking for ways to smear the president.
Nathan Phillips is a deadbeat. He is the opposite of the type of person we should respect. https://t.co/RdaVjGGcX4
If Democrats really thought Trump had done something wrong, they would be sober and sad for our country. Instead they cheer with glee at the idea that he did something wrong because they are filled with hatred and want to see him fail at our expense.

@PardesSeleh I'm not mad at Trump. He was the bigger person to allow workers to get paid. I am just disgusted that the vile Pelosi and Schumer refused to compromise and gave the rest of us a big "f you."
Now that the shutdown is over, federal employees who make above average income can go back to their comfortable lives knowing their pay is coming. In the meantime, the people who really do struggle will still be struggling. There is no back pay for the poor.
@Breaking911 @DineshDSouza Oh, and don't forget: the media had a head's up so they could catch all this drama and broadcast it for the chucking Trump haters. Anyone who thinks the investigation isn't biased or partisan is a fool.
@FaithImportant @prageru I have a 1st grader who scored at 6th grade levels for math and reading. I have pushed for him to get harder work and the school refuses. We too, do the real learning at home. I won't hold a curious child back if he wants to know more. He gets baby books at school. Uggh.
@Jik447Scott @prageru Homeschooling provides superior results. When I was in a teaching credential program, one of the first things we learned was that individualized instruction is always superior. Public schools can't offer that.
@PlayaManhattan @prageru I went to a state college near my house, (that I bought before I finished college,) and earned a 4.0, then joined Mensa with an IQ in the 99th percentile. I've had people mock my university, but hey, I owned a house in my early twenties and I have a card showing I'm super smart.
@Baklava_in_CA @prageru Similar for me. I lived in a well-off suburb with "excellent" schools. Kids smoked pot in the stands at football games and sold it in the halls in my public school. Christian school wasn't perfect, but highly-involved parents demanded better and modeled better.

@RealJamesWoods I am against abortion, but it seems like if you don't want to be pregnant, it shouldn't take months to realize that.
Re: Roger Stone. How can we trust an investigation when someone alerted the media ahead of time to maximize drama and smearing? The ones investigating have a clear agenda to promote ahead of truth.
@m_j_taylor @Harlan @SusieJustsayin "Surprise" doesn't require a team that is big enough for Waco. This is overdone drama. Add in the fact that the media was alerted to film it, and you get soap opera levels of ridiculousness.

@theblaze Those aren't Christians.
The left has voted THREE times against paying workers during the shutdown. Then they go on TV and pretend they care about the poor, unpaid workers while blaming Trump. They use people as pawns for their games as they appeal to emotion rather than facts or logic.

Thank you to the Republicans who voted to fund the government with a bipartisan compromise today. Not you Cotton. Not you Lee. Manchin, you should come to our side. We have Lindsey Graham and he's highly entertaining.
@michellemalkin I went to a mix of Christian and public schools. The public schools were in a good area. The Christian schools were still better schools. Involved parents, higher quality and more advanced classes, less bullying, more unity, and higher average test scores. I loved it.
If anyone on the left still values facts and critical thinking...pay attention to how bad Pelosi is screwing up. https://t.co/dcQYLpZgHu
@ShaneGoldmacher @benshapiro "Media-savvy" means she can play the ignorant masses well while convincing them to ignore facts. I think that type of propaganda has occurred in the past....
@benshapiro Christian schools tend to graduate higher achievers if only because the parents who send their kids there are more involved. Involvement leads to results. Nearly any private school will out perform a public school.
Rashida Tlaib painted Mitch McConnell as an out-of-touch filthy rich politician, when he barely makes the top 50, and many of Democrat colleagues are much wealthier--including Nancy Pelosi. How dishonest of her. He's rich, but by her "reasoning," she should target the richer.
@Squid_Ewart @RashidaTlaib More realistically, over $100 million.		https://t.co/wqd1PLamFy		That same source puts Mitch at $19 million, which seems tiny by comparison. Tlaib ought to be out to get Pelosi by her own "standards."

@NBfromLB @RashidaTlaib @SpeakerPelosi @SenFeinstein Or Senator Mark Warner--a democrat from Virginia worth over $240 million. Funny that Tlaib would focus on a guy who is worth such much less. Shouldn't she be angry at these Democrats who are worth far, far more than McConnell? It's almost like she's lying to her followers....
@Burnoatus @RashidaTlaib Even scarier, Nancy Pelosi is worth nearly $100 million. Talk about out of touch. I wonder why Tlaib didn't mention that. I guess it didn't fit the agenda.
@Box_of_Joe @RashidaTlaib Nearly $100 million! https://t.co/HmjhiMIDjp		Makes Mitch seem like a lightweight, right?
@RashidaTlaib And Pelosi, (who lives with a wall around her home,) is worth as much as $100 million. 		Did you have a point? Or are you posting disingenuous, one-sided stories meant to manipulate emotions?		https://t.co/HmjhiMIDjp
@benshapiro Tlaib is even more stupid than I thought. There is far more wealth among the Democrats than among the Republicans in the Senate. The House might be more even. McConnell is a lightweight compared to Warner or even Feinstein.
@prageru He seems intelligent and well-spoken too. What a classy boy!
@bihit @SaraCarterDC AOC stated on TV the other night that the world is "like" going to end in twelve years due to climate change. He's mocking her. It's hilarious!
If there is anyone intelligent remaining on the left, they should be looking at these facts and realizing they are on the wrong side. https://t.co/CIWkOeCevc
@Debber66 @DineshDSouza Are those folks on the left actually *supportive* of the political disaster that is currently Venezuela?
This says all we need to know about the goals of the left. They play up the hardships of unpaid workers to use them as pawns and emotional tactics, but they don't actually care. https://t.co/FK9fOzl602
@realDailyWire @michaeljknowles There is something to be said for the mob effect or as I call it--"the circle jerk." People tend to do what they think is accepted by the people around them--logic be damned. She is spouting emotion and entitlements that appeal to low IQ young people.
@20Schmidty @RealJamesWoods I have eleven and a half years left on my mortgage. This sucks.
@realNateRankin @RealJamesWoods Her fans are freaking out that he "disrespected" her even though she targeted him. They are also pointing out that her posts have more "likes." I'd say that is because smart folks are rarer than the mass of dummies who take her seriously ;)
@RealJamesWoods And her fans are so darn stupid that they don't see how smooth he is. I loved it!
@bdomenech @benshapiro Nathan Phillips said he served in Vietnam--repeatedly. He purposely misled others to get special treatment.
@GDabda @LindseyGrahamSC @AOC AOC stated on TV the other day that the world is going to end in 12 years due to climate change. He's mocking her dramatic and ignorant claims.
@33JamesT @LindseyGrahamSC Nah, she's just great fodder for sarcasm and jokes.
@InorOnWater @LindseyGrahamSC What is trendy isn't always what is best. The masses like all kinds of crap and nonsense--just watch any awards show or look at the highest paid entertainers. AOC is a dummy talking to other dummies. Of course they love her.
@Principalaz @LindseyGrahamSC Nobody said the masses were especially bright.
@MusicalDuffer @LindseyGrahamSC She hasn't been right about much of anything. Even mainstream media has been fact-checking her. She's a hilarious train wreck.
@ladolcevitaone @LindseyGrahamSC AOC has gone after dozens of her more experienced elders from both political parties. Maybe she needs to learn a little respect--especially as the clueless newbie. Double standards much?
@nattynatlite @LindseyGrahamSC AOC's followers aren't that into thinking.
@LindseyGrahamSC Comments like this are the reason Lindsey Graham is the absolute coolest senator. This is hilarious! AOC can't even keep up because she's not clever enough.
@LindseyGrahamSC @AOC At least she'll get to hit her 40th birthday before the world ends. There's always that milestone.

@Lori_B_777 @TryAgain1955 @thecjpearson @Rambobiggs Uh oh, her tweet is unavailable. She usually stands by her evil comments. I guess she realized this one was too much. Maybe the adults in her party are warning her.
@chuckwoolery There is more wealth within the Democratic party than in the Republican party. And yet the Democrats are always attacking "the rich." Let's see Pelosi give away 100 million dollars since she hates the rich so much.
@SarahPalinUSA Did she delete it? That surprises me. In the past couple weeks, she has defended her anti-Semitism and her slanderous comments about Lindsey Graham. She is a sociopath. She doesn't feel shame.

@thecjpearson @iamcardib @realDonaldTrump Leftists keep screaming that Trump has done nothing and is a disaster. They are too consumed with hatred to look logically at facts and statistics. Most of us are better off. Why not be glad about that instead of trying to tear it apart?
@robbystarbuck @DaveWhittum The left fully believes it is okay to bully Trump supporters, but the bullying leftists are victims if the Trump supporters respond.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro Why bother telling her? She'll refute it all five minutes before he goes on.
Nathan Phillips is just a mess. His entire life is a mess straight out of a sociology text book. AWOL, chronically homeless, jobless, drunk, in and out of jail. Professional protestor and grifter. That the media would exalt him as a peaceful and wise leader is insanity.
@JohnCornyn It's amazing that one evil woman--Nancy Pelosi--has the entire country on edge because she refuses to compromise. She's not mentally or physically competent for any leadership position.
@TryAgain1955 @IlhanMN That's what she does. Lie. I don't expect anything better.
@DavidAFrench @benshapiro He's guilty of being a white Christian. Anything he says will be used twisted and used against him. Of course his family sought help to protect themselves from a slanderous mob. Shame on the people who elected Omar. She's dishonest and a vile excuse for a human.
@IlhanMN This evil woman is spreading more libel, slander, and nonsense, I see. Despicable Omar is the lowest of the low in society.
@DavidAFrench @benshapiro I think any sane person knows that Omar is an evil and vile anti-semite who slanders innocent people on TV and Twitter.
@DLoesch Intelligent people debate with facts. Low class bullies just use vulgar insults. It's scary that people like Lee walk among us. Social media makes those bottom feeders feel emboldened.
@gus_constantine @Rambobiggs @roflinds So if she said something to piss them off it is irrelevant, but if they respond, they are the big evil? We can't even see the boys in this video. SMH.		The logic is not strong with you, I see.
@roflinds Oh yeah...a seven second video. I'll bet that really tells the full story! We can't even tell if there are any Covington boys in this scene or what happened before the seven seconds she shared.
@joelpollak @michellemalkin A person would have to be very sick in the head to celebrate abortion, let alone the most violent type of late-term abortion.
@RubinReport @KyleKashuv When white Catholic boys stand up for themselves while being bullied and abused, they are "harassing" their bullies. When conservatives stand up for the truth after the media lies, they are "pouncing." When liars are called out, they are "victims."
@DannyCalidonia I wonder how much "Native American" he is. He has a very long history of sketchy behavior, crime, and more. Even his tribe disassociates from him because they don't like the way he acts. https://t.co/SpomG4yflW
RT @MarkYoungTruth: This needs to retweeted to everyone. https://t.co/RIGeFUEysE
@karol @benshapiro @DavidAFrench Phillips is a con artist, professional trouble-maker, grifter, bully, and perpetual liar. He's most likely a sociopath. Does he have any history of having a job?
@Cooey1967 @SusieJustsayin I can only imagine what kind of low class people walk around like that in public.
So Nathan Phillips was never a Vietnam vet, but claimed to be to avoid being held accountable for his pathetic behavior. He's solicited Paypal donations with this fake story. At this point, I wonder how "Native" he is. As much as Elizabeth Warren?
@LiveAction @March_for_Life 38 sociopaths voted.
@benshapiro Critical thinking certainly isn't her strong point. What is her strong point again?
@JacobAWohl I wonder if he is as native as Elizabeth Warren? Since he lies about being a Vietnam Vet and lied about the incident with the teenagers, can we believe anything he says? He is a very toxic and dishonest person.
@RealSaavedra Joy is so crazy, she made Whoopi look reasonable. But hey, at least she was honest.
@ComfortablySmug @benshapiro Odd. I wonder why it was okay for the elder to approach the boys and antagonize them. I see a fundamental problem with that. Why does she want the boys to accept abuse and shut up? Would she have told a woman the same thing if the elder got in a woman's face?
Paraphrase of a comment seen on Twitter: "How dare those Covington kids harass that girl!" Followed by: "If she harassed him first for his MAGA hat, GOOD." 	SMH. They literally think it is okay to bully a conservative, but they are victims if their target responds in kind.
@chuckwoolery I've seen people blame the kid for "getting in" or "staying in" Phillips' face when the video makes it very clear Phillips was the one who walked right up to the kid to intimidate him. All the left sees is the MAGA hat. Then their hatred kicks in.
@JoeyDiZoglio @CitizensBank They forced kids to take out more loans than they could afford? Or they prevented kids from learning basic finance skills?
@CitizensBank Google "how much house can I afford" and test it. Try it with one amount of monthly debt, then drop it by $200. Your affordable mortgage amount increases dramatically. The standard mortgage is for thirty years.
@CitizensBank For those who don't understand, lenders look at your outgoing monthly debt. Dropping your debt by a couple hundred a month makes a difference of tens of thousands on a mortgage--about $40k depending on rates.

@RoseDC11 @SusieJustsayin There is definitely a huge difference between us and them. I see so much rage and hatred from the left. And they all seem to perpetuate it among themselves so that they become dangerous, ignorant mobs who don't care about facts.
@RealJamesWoods Well then, he should do his part and stay out of the 2020 race. It wouldn't be fair of him to use his white privilege to try to be president.
@chuckwoolery Sounds like a perpetual deadbeat and grifter.
@RyanAFournier Because the folks at Twitter share her views.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery I don't think white guys are allowed next time around. No matter how poorly qualified, the left wants a novelty--a "first."
@RobWill33568469 @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Many teenagers or even adults would have punched Phillips for getting in their space. I personally wouldn't do that or condone it, but the reality is, a lot of people would get physical to defend their space and pride. Beating a drum in his face was meant to intimidate and bully.
@MarkYoungTruth The liberals believing this story are running on rage and emotion...but not one bit of logic. If you try to use logic with them, they jump to different arguments or name-calling. They also function as a single-brained group. Scary. They are too stupid to know they are stupid.
@MarkYoungTruth It's interesting that liberals think it is okay to bully and attack a conservative, but they go on a rampage with pitchforks if those people defend themselves or fight back. That's very typical abuser logic.
@bacampbellsoup @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump We should only care to the extent that she is a danger to others.
@lori8288 @BreitbartNews I remember him having a lot more hair in that 80s movie I saw him in many years ago.
@LouDobbs @DiamondandSilk @realDonaldTrump A congressman who runs with slander and delights in false rumors and gossip hoping our president will be impeached is guilty of treason. Even if you don't like Trump, it's foolish to hope our country goes through that level of turmoil and drama. It's not good for anyone.
@chuckwoolery What a psycho. I went through legitimate domestic violence and still never felt the need or want to assault my abuser or anyone else--let alone a kid who was the victim of a manipulated smear campaign. That desire for violence is sick and disturbed.
@PatriciaHeaton The damage was already done. The rabid left will still believe what they have chosen to believe because they wanted an excuse to hate. They have their pitchforks out. No need for facts, logic, or truth.
@gosayruhgo @ksweark @Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Wow. You are the worst kind of woman out there.		Condoning bullying kids for their hats, but screaming harassment if they don't like it and respond? SMH.
@ItzGetty @melanatedgirl @Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson She only posted that short blip for a reason. There is an excellent chance it's because the first part makes her look bad. Oops!
@melanatedgirl @Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson That is simply a retarded comment. The fact that she purposely shared a teeny tiny video certainly doesn't determine what really happened. Noting poor grammar from a girl who self-selects what part of the story she tells is nothing more than an observation. Who was raped here?
@bTheResistance @gosayruhgo @Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Yes. Everyone who uses logic or critical thinking must be a bot. SMH.
@gosayruhgo @Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson For real. Knowing how to use proper grammar depending on the object or subject of a sentence. Being smart enough to realize there is more to the story that a little video blip. Simply awful!
@LeeHoll01994008 @NRizenz @brucewilson @freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson He literally walked up to them and got in one boy's space to bang a drum in his face.

@NRizenz @brucewilson @freedom_moates @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Only a fool would believe an 8 second video gives the full story.
@ScottFantasy @Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Liberals believe they are morally superior so it is okay to bully anyone who doesn't share their beliefs. Different standards for different parties.
@Damania_lolley @EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson An 8 second video from a girl who can't use proper grammar?	*friends and me
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson It also shows Phillips approaching the kids first and beating a drum in a boy's face to intimidate him. But don't let reality get in the way of your tunnel vision. You have hating to do!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Even after the original false and one-sided reports were debunked by the media, the crazies on the left continue to foam at the mouth. They don't care about the whole story or the truth. They just want to hate the conservative pro-life kids.
@adamcbest @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Mocking Elizabeth Warren isn't "racism towards Native Americans" because she isn't a Native American. He was making fun of the fact that she was making fraudulent claims. SMH. Many Native Americans don't want anything to do with her phony self.
@MattWolking @michellemalkin @CNN @Bakari_Sellers How do you "bother" someone when they approach you and start banging a drum in your face?
@patsajak I actually prided myself with similar talent, but it all changed when I had sons. In my defense, the kids never manage to put both socks in the hamper at the same time, which makes it harder for me to wash both together.
@seanhannity Investigated for being nominated by Trump? Will these crooks ever stop smearing anyone conservative? I'd rather see them investigate the false accusers.
@BreitbartNews John Cusack? Wow. I had totally forgotten he existed!
@JacobAWohl Gillibrand used to be far right? When did she experience brain damage and go left?
@AnnCoulter Pray to God she doesn't post video of her gynecologist visit.
@DiamondandSilk @Alyssa_Milano She's a rich white liberal. She thinks she knows what black people need more than black people do.
@realDonaldTrump I just want to know about the wall around her house. She must feel really guilty about that immoral thing on her property.
@chuckwoolery Many--if not most--National Park hotels and restaurants are staffed by contractors--often Aramark or such. That's why there was a big deal last year over the trademarked names for Yosemite's Ahwahnee hotel and other sites. Park Rangers don't even staff park hotels!
@Sci101Poli @christy_teter @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I hope this is simple enough for you: Compromise means each side gets something they want. The left claims to care about Dreamers, so Trump offered something for them. He wants a wall, so he asked for something for him.
@tupacschildd @CathyMo30990780 @ColumbiaBugle @DineshDSouza This isn't a "Trump supporters" issue. It's a social intelligence issue for anyone of any political view. Reasonable adults KNOW that you don't walk up to someone, get in their space, and beat a drum in their face. That isn't an honor. He was deliberately intimidating a kid.
@tupacschildd @CathyMo30990780 @ColumbiaBugle @DineshDSouza Do your elders walk up to the kids and beat drums in their faces then get mad that the kid is standing awkwardly in front of them? Or do you just lack logic and context?
@TigerfangLacey @charliekirk11 You missed the point. Not everyone or even a majority of voters want or need most of the pet projects the government funds. More people support the wall than do the bridge to nowhere, the Big Dig, or the airport for 75 people.
@neontaster So white women, (because calling them girls would really piss her off,) don't need to empathize? I guess that explains all the hatred spewed by people like Chelsea Handler, Joy Behar, Bette Midler, Kathy Griffin, and worse.
"Manufactured crisis," "compromised," "temper tantrum..." It's almost as if the liberal buzz words all come from the same place. If you tell a lie enough times, fools will believe and repeat it.
@DineshDSouza He makes America great by intimidating teenage boys by beating drums in the faces when he doesn't like their pro-life stance and MAGA hats? I don't think his level of closed-minded hateful bullying makes anything great.
Slanderous and unfounded gossip about Lindsey Graham, fake Buzzfeed stories about Trump, stories trashing Catholic school boys without the full truth....	What do you have next for us MSM? Which figure or politically incorrect group are you going to smear now?
In a smear campaign, it never matters what is true. It only matters who tells their story first. Even when the false story is debunked, the target's reputation is ruined.
In 2016, there were so many Republican presidential candidates, that they all evened each other out and we got Trump. Now that the left is offering so many potential options already, will they get stuck with the least likely choice too?
@DineshDSouza Will they attack Phillips for his role as quickly and harshly as they leapt on the white, conservative, Christian, pro-life males?
@almostjingo @DineshDSouza Phillips didn't like that the boys were white, pro-life conservatives, so he walked up banging his drum in a boy's face to intimidate him.
The left is gathering all of their worst potential candidates...no white men allowed, (except Bernie because he's nuts.)
The left was quick to run with the Covington story, and quick to trash teenagers. Some outlets have admitted that there was more to the story, and a couple have issued lame apologies. Now will they go after the liars as hard as they went after their original targets?
@charliekirk11 They keep screaming that no one wants the wall, (which isn't true.) But the fact is, tens of millions of us DO want the wall, and there are plenty of pet projects out there that benefit far fewer people.
It doesn't take facts or truth to drive a smear campaign. Whomever lies first gets the foothold in the public's mind. People still believe the debunked Buzzfeed story and people will continue to hate the Covington kids. Those who start smear campaigns know that rumors stick.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Gosh, I never realized Bette hated women so much. What a nasty misogynist.
@DineshDSouza It's a miracle they even acknowledged the "different side." In the past few days, the press has taken a beating. I guess they realized that and they realized that viewers ARE noticing their lack of professionalism.
The left hates Trump, conservatives, and Christians so much that they keep running with fake stories and half stories. They salivate over anything that makes their target groups look bad. They've given up on integrity, journalism, and facts. Don't even think about due process!
@ColumbiaBugle @DineshDSouza The older guy is a classic bully and abuser. He feels free to intimidate and attack his target, but plays victim when the target doesn't like being bullied and responds. What a sick person he is. I won't call him a man, because he isn't one.

@RealSaavedra Yeah, can you believe the horrible Trump administration wanted to move the capital to Jerusalem and stood alone by Israel while the UN supported Palestine?		AOC is intellectually challenged.
@JohnCornyn Even normal people can act like bullying maniacs when they subscribe to group think--a la "Lord of the Flies." Right now, the left hive mind is raging without logic or reality, and they are running as a blind group. They are louder than the logical adults.
@ChippySuave @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The illogical confuse promoting laws and legal immigration with "racism." I guess using dishonest labels is easier than thinking about the real issues. Why think critically when you can throw out emotional buzz words?
@diablos49 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I do want a wall, but I applaud your wise reasoning. REAL compromise occurs when BOTH sides get something they want. Unfortunately, Pelosi refuses to give a little. She wants the agreement to be all one-sided on her behalf.
@christy_teter @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump She determined her response before she even knew the proposal. Kind of like they had a pre-made rejection of Trump's Supreme Court nominee before they knew who it was. Her only plan is to refuse to work with the president. What a petty and evil woman she is.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump So what you really mean is, even though you haven't seen it yet, you are pre-rejecting it because you hate Trump and YOU refuse to cooperate and compromise.
@BreitbartNews She is an example of why critical thinkers know MSNBC is not a reliable "news" source. Any channel that allows their "journalists" to spout biased opinion instead of facts should not be taken seriously. Unfortunately, the unintelligent will just absorb her views.
@BreitbartNews She's a typical sociopath. She wants to blame her victim for the consequences of her own bad behavior.
@KayaJones She is literally intellectually challenged, but other less-than-intelligent people think she's great. Scary stuff. While the adults saw her debacle for what it was, her followers thought she was brave. SMH.
@KellyannePolls Anyone who thought Buzzfeed was a news source rather than an entertainment site is a fool. Many of them have left the erroneous post share, and new people are still believing it because they don't know it was debunked. Irresponsible.

@PatrickRuffini @benshapiro Universities have a very strong liberal bias which is self-perpetuating because the people who are indoctrinated/educated are the same people who go on to indoctrinate/educate.

@RealJamesWoods When I graduated from high school, I was required to pass US government class. There was also a required government class for my college degree. Do kids today not have these classes? This is not how impeachment works. Liberal schools are promoting uneducated, mindless drones.
@RealJamesWoods She is human trash of the lowest kind. No wonder she looks a good twenty years older than she really is. It's all the evil and bile seeping out her wrinkled pores.
@wizardtechny @BreitbartNews BS. The "Compromised" conspiracy theory was recently spouted by leftists Jon Cooper and Chelsea Handler and it has spread through Twitter. When Omar said "compromised," everyone knew that's the rumor to which she was referring.
@SteveKl00655958 @BreitbartNews She used the same "compromised" theory that suggests Graham is gay without actually saying he was gay. That was sneaky. The haters all knew what she meant, but she can deny it and her enablers will support her. Either way, she is scum to insinuate blackmail with no evidence.
@JoniHolinger @BreitbartNews She alluded to the well-known conspiracy theories circulating on Twitter that do indeed claim Graham is "compromised" due to sexuality. Everyone knew that's what she meant. It's disingenuous and enabling to pretend she didn't. Her unfounded defamation exposes her poor character.
@ricotorrea @BreitbartNews Even if she didn't specifically refer to sexuality, she repeated the "compromised" theory that originated on Twitter with homophobic attacks. We all know darn well that she was insinuating the same thing, and so do you. Either way, she defamed him with no evidence. Scummy.
@SarahPalinUSA He's the same person he's always been--willing to work with the winning team to keep himself electable and relevant. The left is just smearing to undermine his credibility because he promises to push through lots of conservatives judges in his chairman position.
@GovMikeHuckabee @RealJamesWoods Who needs substance in government when AOC can excite brainless millennials with demonstrably inaccurate nonsense and attacks on wiser and experienced politicians? This is about image over quality.
@I_Vicere @GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @Delta Why don't you be really cool and add hand clap emojis in there?
@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump @Delta She can afford to pay for herself. Somehow, she's made tens of millions of dollars in politics while making under $200k a year. Funny how that works.
Senator Graham says he is not gay, so I believe him. The fact that vile  people on the left are using unsupported rumors of homosexuality to attack him is entirely despicable. They are running a smear campaign because they are afraid of his power as judiciary committee chairman.
@BreitbartNews There are a handful of incoming leftist representatives that are dangerously stupid and evil. She is one of them. Let's hope that their despicable behavior is a warning to the more mature and responsible Democrats.

@ellencarmichael @benshapiro Graham has become more powerful and influential lately, and now he is head of the judiciary committee. Of course they are out to smear him. He's been bullied before and seems to get energy from it, but I feel bad for him having to put up with such malicious hatred from the left.
@RichLowry @benshapiro It is nothing more than junior high bullying. It is also slander and libel in this case. The newbies on the left are nasty and dangerous. Let's hope the adults on the left take control so this isn't their future.
@RealJamesWoods She shows the dangers of social media group think. Humans are not so advanced as we think and will follow even the stupidest group leader. The real danger is the number of completely ignorant and illogical people who love her insane posts. They don't care about facts.
@kenwalsh77 @atrupar @benshapiro @IlhanMN This gal is just doing what it is cool to do on the left these days--mock and trash Graham because he stood up for Kavanaugh and is a conservative hero these days. She's just joining the other junior high level bullies. Yawn.
@jswainhart @atrupar "Looking out for himself so he can be re-elected and stay on Trump's good side" is an even better theory. He also worked closely with Obama and Hillary despite calling Obama a terrible president and Hillary a horrible candidate. That's what he does.
@fawkesthisshit @davidisnotdave @atrupar He is infamous for NOT using email. SMH. Stop with the crazy conspiracy theories.
@BOOBSPACE @atrupar Ignorant people say that because they saw it on Twitter. Anyone who looks at his entire career knows that he has always been willing to work with election winners despite previous spats. Even as a representative over two decades ago, that was his reputation. 360 is right.
@atrupar Sooo...the same Senator who worked well with Obama despite despising him as a president is also willing to work with Trump? I'd say he's the same guy he's always been and is looking out for himself. Grown-ups work with the "enemy" even if they don't like the election results.
@KyleKashuv Anyone who believes peace is possible does not understand human nature. At best, there will always be personality disordered and sociopathic people, and just one of them can poison a group environment.

@SecNielsen @GOP We all know Pelosi is just playing petty games. It will backfire on her. The adults are watching.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump She and Schumer looked so foolish and comical in their last address, that they are afraid Trump will win the next round too. Trump gave a calm and thoughtful speech and they kept lying and said he was throwing a "temper tantrum." That's called gas lighting. They were clowns.
@dbongino It all reeks of paranoia and delusion. I call it tin foil hat fodder.
@RepMarkMeadows There ARE some members of Congress who are trying. Unfortunately, the left has chosen not to cooperate or compromise. Maybe only those who refuse to meet should have paychecks withheld.
@chuckwoolery Historically, false accusations were rare and real rapes went unreported, but the left showed dishonest people that false accusations pay off. You can get fame and fortune--maybe even a book deal--for making up a story about a politician.
@lmfenex @GOP @realDonaldTrump Yeah, because Trump.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump I never realized that Biden has more hair now than he did way back then. Interesting.
@senjudiciary Since Barr has already been AG, the left can't make the case that he is not qualified. So instead, they focused on how loooong it has been and how the world has changed soooo much. Anything to discredit a Trump nominee.
@RepMikeTurner As one of your constituents who has voted for you over the years, I really hope you do your part to make sure we get the wall. Maybe not everyone wants it, but tens of millions of us do. More than anything, we are tired of Pelosi and Schumer bullying the president.
@benshapiro She is almost as qualified as a hooker.
@_That_Weirdo @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump They refuse to compromise in any way regarding the wall. They want what they want but refuse to give Republicans anything in return. All one-sided.
@Copy_Culture @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump The Republicans offered concessions--including DACA. It is clear that the left refuses to compromise. I don't think you understand give and take.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Oh, they will support walls again...when we have a Democrat president.
@LindseyGrahamSC @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump She is too childish and petty to compromise.

@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Eye roll. Stop projecting. I used logic and a factual source. You have turned personal. That is what happens when you can't keep up.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC I am almost never on Twitter. I usually hang out in my Mensa groups for more logical conversation. I just called out your illogical and non-factual nonsense. I provided a link with reality and you turned to an insult. Sigh.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Lol! You wouldn't know logic. You have repeatedly said the rich "owe" what they simply do not owe.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC I didn't say it. A major news network did in that link. Seriously. Economic facts. I know facts and logic are scary, but they are wonderful things.

@susan_perino @BlancaCamachoNY @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Simple reality:	https://t.co/0EDs9Rl4Bv		Anyone who says the rich aren't paying enough is either ignorant or delusional.
@susan_perino @BlancaCamachoNY @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Here are facts from a well-known source. Don't hurt yourself: https://t.co/0EDs9Rl4Bv		The rich are carrying us all.

@jenshetterly @tomasacat @tomjensen6 @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Close. The Mayflower arrived in 1620. You do know that thirty years for a generation is an average and not an exact number, right? Do I need to explain averages?

@jenshetterly @tomasacat @tomjensen6 @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC 14th generation in the US. So, yes.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC They aren't taking one of your toys. They are taking fewer away from the rich guy and giving you fewer of his toys.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC You still don't get it do you? The rich pay more taxes than everyone else combined. Your "increase" is probably still far less than what a wealthy person pays. And your bracket is lower. Sounds like you are paying more of your fair share now and you don't like it.
@tomasacat @tomjensen6 @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Unless you are new to society, you may know that all candidates make promises. Most never meet them, but they can certainly try.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC You are the one wanting people to pay extra taxes that you claim they "owe." I am okay with my taxes. I don't want to pay a "fair share" in the highest tax bracket. The rich pay far more than the rest of us.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC The tax codes determine that. Entitled and illogical folks scream that the rich "owe" more. Reminds me of toddlers wanting other kids' toys. Waaaah!
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC No, the rich are not "literally" putting money back. They are *literally* not paying more out in the first place. Sigh.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC You have an arbitrary and entitled definition of "owe." If they pay their already high tax rates, then you don't decide they "owe" more.
@xIceBurg @jennilamb007 @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Compromise occurs when both sides set out their top demands then give and take to get to an agreement.
@susan_perino @BlancaCamachoNY @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Oh, "fair share." Their share is far more than that of the rest of us even after cuts. You should check out tax brackets. It is the majority of us who aren't paying in.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC If you take money out of your pocket and give it to someone, you give them money. If you refrain from taking it out of their pocket, that is not giving them money.
@BlancaCamachoNY @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Literally, no.		Who says anyone "owes" anyway. You think the rich "owe" you?
@browndog1117 @susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Sigh. If I don't steal your wallet, that is not the same as giving you money. Seriously.
@susan_perino @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Taking less money from the rich is not actually giving them money.
@octoberskeye @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC You need to adjust your tin foil hat.
@tomjensen6 @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC For real. Every other president has fulfilled all of their campaign promises with every detail, right?
@jennilamb007 @CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC Adults refer to it as "compromise." Both sides get something. It is a very exciting concept for grown-ups!
@CNNSotu @LindseyGrahamSC That is how compromise works. Let's hope the democrats grow up and work with the right.
I find it interesting that when one simply posts or replies on social media, some leftists jump in and insult. That isn't mentally well behavior, and it emphasizes the differences between right and left. They are like bratty kids whose parents don't supervise them.

@BreitbartNews What a nasty entitled and disrespectful brat she is. She won't go over well with any adults.

@KyleKashuv Obviously, since she is "4" humanity, she is morally superior and subject to different rules of civility.
@seanhannity Someone should tell her that wearing the glasses doesn't actually make her smarter.
@SarahPalinUSA Why is this psychopath still roaming the streets?
@KyleKashuv He's gotten to the point where all he does is brag about the things he buys and owns. You can't make a living that way.
@KyleKashuv The shirts also double as a preliminary IQ test.
@DiamondandSilk She is even more narcissistic than her husband, and both are extreme narcissists. Scary that people blindly worship them, but that is common with charming predators and con-artists.

Leftists always whine about the "old" people running congress, but they need to understand that these "old" people were once young and they had to gain experience and EARN their ways up. You don't just jump to the top.
@DiamondandSilk The Hallmark Channel is more realistic than CNN. It has better looking actors too!

@benshapiro She is so entirely stupid and shameful, that I think our mature congressmen and women should not legitimize her nonsense by responding to her as if she is an equal. She's a fool who was elected for novelty. What a slap in the face of qualified people.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery I joined Mensa and finished two graduate programs, and I voted for "Not Hillary." I'm pleased with Trump's results and I'm not rich.  When some leftist says Trump supporters are stupid or uneducated, I just roll my eyes. Actually, I roll my eyes a lot these days....
@realDonaldTrump It is taking a long time to find a bunch of nothing.
@benshapiro Killed but still alive? Sounds like Jesus.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery The people who are hurt worst by the "white privilege" myth are the poorest whites who start with little to nothing and no family to boost them. They can't get as much help because of their "privilege," and yet they don't actually have this mythical privilege.
@michaeljknowles Does that make Michael pretty or Maddow handsome?
@LindseyGrahamSC @cindyhydesmith @realDonaldTrump And how refreshing that it ended in just one easy night instead of taking a week or more. This is how all elections should go!
I follow politicians I like to see what they are up to. I see leftists following these same politicians that they hate in order to make nasty, juvenile comments. Just another example of the huge divide between conservative and liberal culture.
An entire ethnic/religious group was targeted for annihilation due  solely to their heritage and religion. To compare the Jewish Holocaust victims to a group of people fleeing poverty is thoughtless and cruel. How dare someone minimize the horrors of the Holocaust!

@BreitbartNews Does she think anyone in this world is stupid enough to believe that debacle was about anything other than trashing Trump? It was so tacky and disrespectful to McCain.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I hope they begin to embrace conservatism. They will find that it is much better for them. We need to boost our black Americans before we take in illegal immigrants, and the Republican party is best suited to do that.
@BreitbartNews Yikes. What is wrong with her face?
@BreitbartNews He's a charming predator. People like him have fooled many people over the years. They even fool professional psychologists. Monica wouldn't be the first young woman to fall for a sociopath.

@SirMxy @LindseyGrahamSC Which would be out of line with his history and views. But of course, the left is never partisan with judges, right?
@MikeDrost28 @lori_dee1 @RealSaavedra She's about to make more than three times the average US household income. Spare us the lectures about the poor thing having to use her savings for two months. Adults have to use their own money for bills all the time.
@RealSaavedra @benshapiro She has more savings than the average American...despite only making $26k last year. How was she paying rent, let alone saving?

@TomFitton No. As with most liberals, their brains are not fully developed and they cannot make rational decisions. Raise the age to 25 for better choices and results.
@realDonaldTrump They are still confident fraud will work in their favor. After all, Sinema mysteriously pulled forward and won, and Abrams is still hoping activist judges can delay her concession.
@SarahPalinUSA Melania is an impressive woman with strong boundaries. She doesn't seek attention and adulation like Michelle does. I'm sure she can sense the intense narcissism and self-worship that seeps out of Michelle's every pore.
@thealexvanness @benshapiro Not bad for a low IQ idiot who has never held a real job.
@SarahPalinUSA The guy was wrestling with a petite young intern over a microphone. How petty, aggressive, and pathetic. Any decent man should condemn Acosta's bullying behavior.
@SarahPalinUSA Abrams refused to concede because she knew her party was going to come through with fraudulent votes. She was counting on it.
@BreitbartNews We're scared of her because she is nuts and promotes violence--not because she is black, and definitely not because she is strong.

@lyndseyfifield @benshapiro @vogue Why do leftists keep telling women what their own best interests are?
@BuckSexton @DineshDSouza Even most of the leftists know this is fraudulent. They just don't care, because all that matters to them is getting their people in office.
@DiamondandSilk It's almost as if they expect us to believe that only Democrats are too stupid to vote correctly or fill out a ballot. Odd. The Republicans never have so much trouble with selecting boxes.
After twenty years of loyalty to KOA campgrounds, I had the experience from hell. I also learned that their company is willing to throw customers away rather than do the right thing. Exceptionally poor customer service. Their response is to refuse to respond. Foolish of them.
@RepMattGaetz @DineshDSouza They cry wolf about it because they are so used to committing fraud themselves that they think others are just as unethical. Just like a cheating spouse always accuses the other of cheating. It's projection.
@BreitbartNews Leftists are vile bullies, and when we vote red, we aren't just voting for conservatives, we are voting against the mentally ill behavior of liberals. Sane adults simply do not act like that.
@marcorubio What is there to hide? Very bizarre.
@LindseyGrahamSC They arrogantly and erroneously believe that they know what is best for the world, and they self-righteously think that the ends they desire justify their crooked means.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Since when do the French defend themselves from anyone?
@ReaganBattalion @benshapiro @RepJNunez @marcorubio @LopezCantera @BarackObama People of any color should be worried about voting for incompetent candidates. Some of us white folks didn't vote for Hillary either. Those folks LOST because they were pushing an agenda that normal Americans don't buy.
@usminority @DineshDSouza It is clear he touched her, but even if he hadn't, his choice to wrestle a microphone away from a young woman was pathetic and cowardly. What a scumbag. Ladies...avoid raging bullying men like Acosta.
@JebBush That privilege should be accompanied by mature and considerate behavior. Unfortunately, the leftist media is not capable. They'd rather wrestle microphones from petite young women. Pathetic.
@RealJamesWoods The party that bullies and abuses women is up to its usual tricks. Acosta is a raging bully. Any decent man should be disgusted by him.

@staceyabrams Con-artist.
@staceyabrams You are shameful and need to grow up and respect the process. You lost. Now you are harming the people of Georgia by refusing to move on.

@BreitbartNews Too much time with crazy co-hosts will do that to a girl.
@marcorubio Things are great. The left just doesn't like it. They create the "problems" with their inability to accept reality.
@frogautistic @primalpoly @clairlemon People bragging about a specific score usually didn't take a real test. (Maybe they took an inflated online test?) A real score comes with a percentile which tells you where you stand in comparison to others.
@MyTakeOnThings2 @primalpoly This has been discussed within Mensa groups time and time again. Hiring managers usually don't have especially high IQs. They may be defensive when reviewing an application showing a high IQ score because they don't have the same.
@MarkGilroyAB @primalpoly @clairlemon Mensa stopped accepting SAT as an indicator of IQ in the early 90s. There may be a small correlation, but not enough. Education that is learned and innate IQ are not the same thing.
@MYZEROACADEMIA @primalpoly @Ryona_Violet My IQ scores above the 99th percentile. I grew up poor and took out loans for college. Won academic awards as a top student. Graduated summa cum laude. Finished two graduate programs. Later joined Mensa. Excuses, excuses.
@KStylePodcast @primalpoly We could stop "educating" low or average IQ people and wasting their time when a trade would better serve them. Stop the dumbing down of higher education by limiting it to those who can really use it.
@primalpoly IQ is genetic, and it runs in my family. I consistently find that just the idea of IQ offends liberals because they don't like the idea that not everyone can "earn" a high IQ. No one gets angrily defensive about height or beauty, though.
@ISPVersailles How shameful to ignore all the impatient speeders and harass the person following the lawful speed limit. I thought police were supposed to enforce the law? I guess you enable speeding and breaking the law instead. How entirely backwards. It speaks poorly of your department.
