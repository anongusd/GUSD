Pres says his call for $5.6-billion to build a border wall is "such a small number." He compares it to the cost of 1 month for US forces in Afghanistan. Actually, the Pentagon has said US costs in Afghanistan come to $45-billion a year, which is $3.75-billion a month. https://t.co/OLp9Nh4IfN
On decision to withdraw US forces from Syria, Pres doesn't have a timetable, but says, "we don't want Syria." He says we want to protect to the Kurds, but don’t want to be in Syria forever. "It's sand and it’s death," he says of Syria. https://t.co/2F1GVbl1hi

On the lighter side, Pres Trump today "pardons" two Thanksgiving turkeys: "Peas" and "Carrot." If WH rules for reporters apply to poultry, it'll be one gobble per turkey unless a followup gobble is permitted. The two 42-pounders were pretty chatty at yesterday's unveiling. https://t.co/xvnf0XR01f
Today at the WH: Pres Trump has said there'll be a US intelligence report on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and whether the Saudi Crown Prince ordered it. @POTUS said Sunday that MBS told him - "maybe 5 times...he had nothing to do with it."
.@CBSNewsPoll out this morning shows 72% want Pres Trump to let Mueller investigation continue, 24% favor steps to stop it. Same poll shows 52% want Congress to pass bill protecting Mueller probe, 43% would oppose such action. More at: https://t.co/40dLfGOEV7
Pres has said he expects to receive Tuesday "a very full report" on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, including the U.S. intelligence assessment of the role played by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Pres says MBS has repeatedly denied ordering the killing.
After the Turkey event on Tuesday, Pres &amp; Mrs. Trump depart for Mar-a-Lago, their estate in Palm Beach, to spend Thanksgiving. Will be the president's 18th visit. He has spent all or part of 72 days there since taking office. The turkeys go to a gobbler home at @virginia_tech.

Sanders goes on to say she hopes rules of conduct for the press won't be required to govern behavior elsewhere in the WH or on Air Force One. She says it would be "a great loss" if a "lengthy and detailed code of conduct" had to be imposed on press for other White House events.
.@PressSec says new rules for reporters created "with a degree of regret." Says WH would have "greatly preferred" to conduct news conferences "on a set of understood professional norms," as opposed to rules. Blames @cnn for the change.
From @presssec: new rules for reporters at WH press conferences.	- one question per reporter, then yield floor and microphone.	- followup question "may be permitted."  Then yield floor and microphone.	- "failure to abide" may result in suspension/revocation" of WH press pass.

Pres says he "probably" should have made a Veterans Day visit to @ArlingtonNatl on Monday. Says he will, "virtually" every year from now on. As for visiting US forces in war zones, "I think you will see that happen," said @POTUS. Says things "are being planned."
"There’s no reason for me to hear it," says Trump of the recording of the Khashoggi murder. Says "it was very violent, very vicious and terrible." "I know everything that went on in the tape without having to hear it," he said in FNS interview taped Friday and aired today.
Pres says he deliberately has not listened to the audio recording of Khashoggi's murder. "We have the tape, I don’t want to hear the tape," he told FNS. "No reason for me to hear the tape." Says "it's a terrible tape" and he's been briefed on it.
Pres Trump says Saudi Crown Prince MBS continues to deny any role in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi. "As recently as a few days ago," said @POTUS in interview on @FoxNewsSunday. "At the same time we do have an ally and I want to stick with an ally."

WH readily accepts call of GOP retaining control of Senate. "That's a huge moment, a huge victory for the president," says @PressSec. Not ready to accept Dems control of the House, "still a lot of races to close to call." And won't change what @POTUS came to do, she says. https://t.co/aWQwlImvEX

"So far we feel good about where we are, but have a long way to go," says @PressSec on @FoxNews liveshot. She cites win of GOP Senate candidate  Mike Braun in Indiana over incumbent @SenDonnelly.
Before we see if the election wave is blue or red, @PressSec issued statement saying Pres Trump "made the choice clear to the American people: continue down the path of American prosperity and security or we can go backwards." A polite way of saying Trump validated or rebuked.
@DoriToribio In 2014, Obama did 7 rallies in these states:	  MD - 1	  IL - 1	  WI - 1	  ME - 1	  MI - 1	  CT - 1	  PA - 1
