The "sky is falling" propaganda tactics of the robber barons haven't changed since the 1930s, but facts are facts. Pro-worker legislation like the $15 minimum wage is good for workers, our communities, and the economy. 		Support it here: https://t.co/IqD8XyeYWF
These studies tend to get news coverage because of the PR push behind them and the doom they portend, and they exist not to convince the public to be anti-minimum wage (polls show we're not) but to confuse the issue and weaken pro-worker legislation.
Why does the job-killing myth persist? Because billionaires and corporations want it to. They pay think tanks like the Employment Policies Institute to put out misleading studies with headline-grabbing titles like "A $15 minimum wage will kill millions of jobs"
Since then, more modern studies have thoroughly debunked the myth. In fact in 2017, researchers examining data culled from *137* minimum wage increases from 1979 to 2016 found that minimum wage increases have no impact on employment for 5 years after the raise.
In 1992, NJ raised it's min. wage while neighboring PA did not. David Card and Alan Krueger used this natural setup and found that relative to fast-food restaurants in PA, fast food in NJ increased employment by 13 percent‚Äîshattering the myth of "higher wages, fewer jobs"
(Thread) This week, the New Jersey legislature passed a $15 minimum wage and reactionaires predictably said "just wait and see what happens to business." Funny thing is that NJ is home to one of the most influential studies on the effects of minimum wage in 30+ years #FightFor15
