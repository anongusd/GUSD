He has been a leader in finding ways to make our schools safer, and I am proud to continue working with him to obtain these funds.
I thank @maxschachter, who tragically lost his son at Parkland, for his ongoing commitment to this issue. He worked diligently with my staff and I to include language in this funding bill, encouraging schools to use federal grant money for these hardening measures.
Metal detectors + other deterrents can help prevent another devastating incident like Parkland from happening again. The legislation also ensures school districts and local law enforcement officers have the proper resources to mitigate + respond to emergency and crises situations
This legislation includes $100 million for the STOP School Violence Act, of which I was a co-sponsor of and was signed into law last year by President Trump. This grant program is a critical investment for localities who seek to improve their school hardening capabilities.
On the anniversary of the Parkland tragedy, I am honored to say we approved additional funding for school safety in tonight‚Äôs government funding bill.
I congratulate @RepKayGranger @NitaLowey. It‚Äôs because of their willingness to negotiate in good faith that we were able to reach this bipartisan agreement. I look forward to working with them + our colleagues to begin the FY20 process to fund critical programs families rely on.
‚Ä¢$9 billion for anti-terrorism programs, international trafficking prevention, the Countering Russian Influence Fund, and other key national security efforts
‚Ä¢Robust funding to study the devastating algal blooms that hurt Florida‚Äôs water supply+tourism industry last year, looking into mitigation for better response + preparedness against future outbreaks
‚Ä¢Reaffirms the U.S.‚Äô commitment to Israel, one of our strongest allies, bolstering its self-defense and security.
BUT! That‚Äôs not all the bill includes. Other items important to #SoFla:	‚Ä¢$37.5 billion to help mom and pop #smallbiz through @Sbagov 7(a) and 504 loan programs 	‚Ä¢$1.01B to combat citrus greening and other invasive species harming Florida‚Äôs iconic crop and our farmers+growersüçä
Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) + the Home Investment Partnership Program, which allow municipalities to expand access to affordable housing, continue to see strong $ levels. I recognize the importance of ensuring our neediest receive the housing and care they need.
In respect to housingüè†, the bill prioritizes funding for our most vulnerable populations, helping the elderly, disabled individuals, veterans, and those living with HIV/AIDS.
Just one example:Over $800M is provided for Transit Infrastructure Grants, including $350M for Bus+Bus Facilities Grants that support our local public bus systems. @MiamiDadeCounty received 2 grants from this program last yr + will hopefully see further dollars in the coming year
In fact, Southern Florida has already reaped the benefits of these programs in the previous year, and I am confident we will continue to see investments made in our communities this year. #SoFla
The legislation continues the strong levels of funding for BUILD grants, Capital Investment Grants, + Airports and Highway Grants, allowing localities like those in @CollierPIO, Hendry County, + @MiamiDadeCounty to compete for federal money to upgrade and expand their facilities
I‚Äôm proud of my work to support Florida‚Äôs seaports and I look forward to building on this program in the future. Sailing away from ports and into other #transport items in this bill...
This seaport funding will have a direct benefit to the Sunshine State. $93 million is set aside for the top 15 container ports, which includes both @PortMiami @PortEverglades, with priority given to projects with a critical issue both ports face - fumigation fees.
Over the past year I heard from so many port authorities in Florida and across the nation on the need for a dedicated port funding pool. That‚Äôs why nearly $300 million is delivered in this legislation to improve our nation‚Äôs seaports.
It furthers historic levels of funding to repair our nation‚Äôs aging infrastructure. It‚Äôs continued progress towards revitalizing our roadways, bridges, airports, transit systems, ‚ùóÔ∏èand for the first time‚ùóÔ∏è, our seaports! üö¢
Tonight, the House approved the remainder of the bills to fund our government for FY19. This package includes the #transport #housing bill I drafted as Chairman last Congress working with my Democratic counterpart, @RepDavidEPrice. Here‚Äôs some info about that bill:
@maxschachter Because of Max‚Äôs leadership, we were able to increase funding for school hardening measures in the government spending bill.  I will continue work with my colleagues, Max, and others to do everything we can to make sure our schools are safe for our children.
Today, we remember the 17 students and faculty members that were lost in Parkland a year ago. I deeply admire folks like @maxschachter who have turned their grief into advocacy to achieve results.

@jguaido Continuar√© trabajando con mis colegas y la administraci√≥n para promover un futuro libre y pr√≥spero para el pueblo de #Venezuela.
@jguaido Ahora es el momento para que otros miembros de la comunidad internacional lo apoyen y apoyen la democracia para el pueblo de Venezuela. Con suerte, la pesadilla de Chavez-Maduro est√° llegando a su fin.
Una abrumadora mayor√≠a de naciones en nuestro hemisferio han reconocido la legitimidad del presidente interino @jguaido y han comenzado a trabajar con √©l hacia una transici√≥n a la democracia.
Se est√° acabando el tiempo para el r√©gimen de Ch√°vez-Maduro, y los causantes de estos cr√≠menes ser√°n responsables. Los que est√°n en el ej√©rcito no deben lanzar sus armas contra sus propios compatriotas que simplemente est√°n exigiendo libertad y elecciones reales.
Felicito a la Administraci√≥n del presidente Trump, una vez m√°s, por el audaz liderazgo de hoy con relaci√≥n al pueblo de Venezuela y la oposici√≥n a los opresores del r√©gimen de Maduro.
El r√©gimen de Ch√°vez-Maduro ha explotado y robado ilegalmente los recursos del pa√≠s rico en petr√≥leo durante demasiado tiempo, y las sanciones tambi√©n lo proteger√°n de un mayor saqueo.
Estas sanciones paralizar√°n el sector petrolero estatal, impidiendo que el r√©gimen siga financiando el terrorismo global, el narcotr√°fico, y la represi√≥n contra su propia gente.
Los grupos de derechos humanos han denunciado la despiadada censura de los medios de comunicaci√≥n, los ataques a las instituciones democr√°ticas de Venezuela, los arrestos arbitrarios, y los asesinatos extrajudiciales y la tortura. #Venezuela
Noticia de √∫ltima hora: la Admin del presidente Trump anunci√≥ imposici√≥n de sanciones contra PdVSA. Por mucho tiempo, Maduro y sus matones han saqueado los recursos estatales que le pertenecen al pueblo, corrompiendo a las instituciones gubernamentales y financieras de #Venezuela
@jguaido I will continue to work with my colleagues and the administration to promote a free, prosperous future for the people of Venezuela.
@jguaido Now is the time for others in the international community to stand with him and stand with democracy for the people of Venezuela. Hopefully, the Chavez-Maduro nightmare is nearing its end.
An overwhelming majority of nations in our hemisphere have recognized the legitimacy of interim President @jguaido and have begun working with him toward a transition toward democracy.
Time is running out for the Chavez-Maduro regime, and those responsible for these crimes will be held accountable. Those in the military should not turn their weapons against their own countrymen who are simply demanding freedom and real elections.
I commend the Trump Administration once again for today‚Äôs bold leadership in standing with the people of Venezuela and opposing their oppressors of the Maduro regime.
The Chavez-Maduro regime has exploited and illegally stolen the oil-rich country‚Äôs resources for far too long, and the sanctions will also protect it from further plundering.
These sanctions will cripple the state-owned oil sector, preventing the regime from funding global terrorism, narcotrafficking, and repression against its own people.
Human rights groups have reported ruthless media censorship, assaults on Venezuela‚Äôs democratic institutions, arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, and torture.
Big news: Trump administration announces sanctions against PdVSA. For too long, Maduro and his cronies have plundered state resources that belong to the people, corrupting Venezuela‚Äôs governmental and financial institutions. #Venezuela
‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre seeing now is democracy once again on the march. A big part of that is because of the leadership of the U.S,‚Äù said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who has been huddling with White House officials, Rubio + others to hammer out Latin American policies. https://t.co/sJ8sogTFOu

Unfortunately, another week has been wasted and we are no closer to a resolution.  Democratic leaders refuse to even begin a conversation that would lead to legislation being considered in the Senate, and eventually reaching the President‚Äôs desk.

The steadfast determination of the opposition in VZ, the growing support of the international community, and the commitment of the United States to democracy and human rights in #Venezuela have been crucial.
Today‚Äôs acknowledgment of new leadership, with the backing of Venezuela‚Äôs powerful opposition, is a definitive step forward.
The United States has made it clear it will not tolerate Maduro‚Äôs power grab and the egregious abuses of his regime that continues to oppress the democratic aspirations of this once prosperous country.
Over the past two years, the Trump administration has imposed tough sanctions on dozens of the Maduro regime‚Äôs corrupt cronies, including those that have participated in human rights abuses, and Maduro personally.
This is a significant milestone for the #VZ people and their pursuit for democracy. I commend the Trump admin for taking a strong stand in support of democratic aspirations of the VZ people by recognizing the legitimacy of @jguaido as democratically elected interim leader of VZ.

Once again, I urge Democratic leadership to consider a real solution to ending the shutdown, whether it be one of my proposals or that of another Member of Congress, that will have a fair chance at Senate consideration and becoming law.
My amendment not only gets us closer to reopening our government, but also protects our national security, addresses vulnerable immigrant communities who seek legal status, and helps those who are rebuilding after Hurricane Michael.
I am exceedingly disappointed Democratic leadership has yet again rejected an amendment which would garner bipartisan support and will not have the opportunity to be debated on the House floor.
This shutdown is unnecessary and is hurting the thousands of federal employees furloughed and the countless American families who depend on federal programs.
At Rules Committee tonight, I presented a commonsense solution to end this shutdown. The amendment I proposed includes funding for border security, provides permanent relief for #DREAMers + #TPS recipients, + delivers critical dollars to communities impacted by natural disasters.

Espero continuar trabajando con la Administraci√≥n para asegurar que los que se benefician del tr√°fico de bienes robados rindan cuentas, y que las v√≠ctimas reciban la justicia que merecen desde hace mucho tiempo.
La decisi√≥n de hoy es un paso firme en la direcci√≥n correcta, y felicito al presidente Trump y al secretario Pompeo por su audaz liderazgo.
Sin embargo, la decisi√≥n de las sucesivas administraciones de ejercer la autoridad de suspensi√≥n del estatuto puede haberles dado confianza en un falso sentido de impunidad.
Desde 1996, las empresas que decidieron explotar estas propiedades confiscadas con el r√©gimen han estado al tanto de que las demandas para proteger los derechos de los propietarios estadounidenses son inevitables.
Aquellos cuyas posesiones fueron robadas por el r√©gimen de Castro han sufrido la p√©rdida durante d√©cadas, mientras que entidades sin escr√∫pulos se asocian con el r√©gimen para sacar provecho de ese robo.
El movimiento sin precedentes de la administraci√≥n Trump para acortar la duraci√≥n de la autoridad de suspensi√≥n legal del T√≠tulo III debe servir como una se√±al para aquellos que contin√∫an violando la ley de los Estados Unidos mediante el tr√°fico de propiedades confiscadas.
Let‚Äôs come together to help disaster-impacted communities, reopen the government, and fix our broken immigration system, including securing our border and providing a solution to DREAMers and TPS beneficiaries.
Bipartisanship is the solution to fund programs that support veterans, house vulnerable populations, and protect our national security.
This bill has zero chance of either Senate consideration or becoming law, + everyone knows it. We also cannot leave the thousands of fed employees in limbo w/o a paycheck+financial certainty. I continue to call on Dem leadership to participate in good faith negotiations.
Today Dem leadership orchestrated another political stunt, this time putting critical supplemental disaster funding at risk. Hurricane Michael devastated parts of the Sunshine State, and these communities are desperately awaiting federal support to continue rebuilding.
I look forward to continuing to work with the administration to ensure that those who profit from trafficking in stolen property are held accountable, and that the victims receive the justice which is long overdue.
However, the decision by successive administrations to exercise the statute‚Äôs suspension authority may have lulled some into a false sense of impunity. Today‚Äôs decision is a firm step in the right direction, and I commend President Trump and Sec. Pompeo for their bold leadership.
Since 1996, businesses who decided to exploit these confiscated properties with the regime have been on notice that lawsuits to protect the rights of American property holders are inevitable.
Those whose properties were stolen by the Castro regime have endured the loss for decades, while unscrupulous entities partner with the regime to profit from that theft.
The Trump administration‚Äôs unprecedented move to shorten the duration of Title III‚Äôs statutory suspension authority should serve as a signal to those who continue to break U.S. law by trafficking in confiscated properties.

As every member of this House and every journalist who covers Congress plainly knows, this bill will not reopen the government.
Unfortunately, today‚Äôs bill is not reflective of our hard work, nor does it provide for these critical infrastructure and housing programs with the proper levels of funding, so they may best serve our communities.
I am grateful to my colleague Rep. Price for his work over the last several years and look forward to continue our bipartisanship during his Chairmanship. He has always been available and willing to work with my staff and I, and I am confident we will continue that collaboration.
Formula funds that go directly to states to rebuild our aging highways and bridges, also takes a major cut in this bill. It leaves every corner of America without the federal dollars it requires to maintain and upgrade its infrastructure.
For the first time, our bill also included funding for ports, a major priority in Florida and across the country.
Programs that go towards housing for disabled individuals, including vets, mobility vouchers to help families w kids, + assistance to those living with HIV/AIDS. The bill today severely undercuts those programs or zeroes them out entirely, putting those with the most need at risk
In our House bill, we funded several essential programs above the Senate level.
Instead of acting in good faith and working with the House, Democratic leadership is pushing through a bill that does not move us any closer to reopening our government.
I am proud of the bill my colleague Rep. Price and I were able to negotiate last year that funded critical programs to rebuild our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, house our most vulnerable populations, and reduce bureaucracy.
After the hours Rep. Price and I spent negotiating the House bill, I could not support the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill that does not reflect months of bipartisan work, and the priorities of the House.

Something that could reopen the government? My amendments to fund border security + offer a solution for #DREAMers and #TPS that were rejected by Speaker Pelosi in Rules Committee on Tuesday + weren't even given the opportunity for debate on the House floor.
@HouseFloor It is clear this bill does not reflect our work or the hours of good faith bipartisan, bicameral negotiations that took place here in the House.
@HouseFloor Mobility vouchers, which give families w small children the ability to move to neighborhoods with greater economic opportunities, is completely zeroed out in today‚Äôs bill. The House bill funded this program at $50M, giving countless families a better chance at the American dream.
@HouseFloor That missing $18M would result in 1,700 people losing their housing. It is vital to #SoFla that this program receive the necessary funding to ensure no individual is left behind.
@HouseFloor HOPWA is a housing program that helps those living with HIV/AIDS, a vulnerable community I‚Äôm proud to support. We funded it at $393M, and the Senate dropped it to $375M.
@HouseFloor Disabled vouchers, a major priority of mine, drops ‚Üì from $390M in House bill to $154M in this bill, + includes *no new vouchers*. How many needy people could be helped by that missing $236M, including our nations veterans, and the tens of thousands of new vouchers we provided?
@HouseFloor Funding for ports, a first for the #transportation bill, was included in our House bill. This version completely zeroes out that account. That funding is critical for Florida and other parts of the country that have seaports, which are huge economic drivers for the country.
@HouseFloor This funding goes directly to states, thereby avoiding bureaucracy and red tape.
@HouseFloor Highway funding, which is critical for the repair of our roadways and bridges, is lowered from $3.8B in our bill, to $2.4B in the Senate bill. That $1.4B is huge, especially to communities that are still rebuilding from natural disasters.
Happening now ‚Äì I am on the @HouseFloor talking about the Senate‚Äôs version of the #transportation #housing Appropriations bill that does not include many House priorities.
Florida is still recovering from recent natural disasters that have decimated our citrus crop. The Senate #Ag bill currently being considered on the House floor falls short of helping Florida's farmers + our iconic #citrus industry.

Whether in D.C. or in Florida, he has spent countless hours presenting the town‚Äôs case for a unique ZIP Code and I am grateful for his support. Together, I am confident that we will get this bill signed into law.
I thank Mayor Cid for his continued efforts and engagement on this critical issue. He has been a great partner to work with and continues to be Miami Lakes‚Äô strongest advocate.
I will continue to work with my House and Senate colleagues to get this bill to the President‚Äôs desk and am hopeful that Mayor Cid and the town will be granted the unique ZIP Code they so desperately need.
That is why I will not relent until Miami Lakes and its residents are granted the relief they need, and why I am introducing similar legislation again this Congress.
The impact a unique ZIP Code would have on Miami Lakes residents cannot be understated. From higher insurance rates to election and census confusion to branding and economic development ‚Äì lack of a unique ZIP Code has been a costly and burdensome issue for my constituents.

I reiterate my commitment to working with any Member of Congress, Republican or Democrat, Representative or Senator, who wants to resolve this issue once and for all.
Just tonight, I presented four amendments that would address the legal status of DREAMers and TPS beneficiaries, yet Speaker Pelosi was not willing to consider even one of them.
We must find a solution to the more than 11 million undocumented individuals who are living in the shadows, + that solution must be reasonable and humane. Lastly, a bipartisan solution to immigration reform must bolster the economy + respect the rule of law of this great nation.
We must modernize our visa system so that American business owners have the power to lawfully hire employees for job vacancies that are hard to fill. Modernizing our visa system also allows us to better track who is traveling through our borders.
The US has the responsibility to determine who and what goes through its borders. There are numerous issues that are problematic and remain unsolved.
Speaker Pelosi: let‚Äôs put aside the political games, reopen the government, secure our border, and give permanent, legal status to DREAMers and TPS beneficiaries.
Every day that passes, this shutdown becomes more damaging, hurting hundreds of thousands of federal workers, as well as Americans across the country that rely on government programs affected by the lapse in funding.
Sadly, this is not the first time the rhetoric of Democratic leadership does not align with their actions.
Just last year, Speaker Pelosi spent eight hours on the House floor, demanding a vote on a DREAMer bill. Yet, here I am, giving her not one, not two, not three, but FOUR opportunities to help DREAMers, and she is handily rejecting them all.
Democratic leadership is so focused on political gimmickry, they refused to even allow consideration of amendments that would reopen the government and resolve an issue they claim is one of their top priorities.
Earlier this evening, I presented four amendments to four different bills in the House Rules Committee that would provide funding to secure our border and offer a permanent solution for #DREAMers and those with expiring Temporary Protected Status (#TPS).
Thank you for your work as Chair, Commissioner Solis! Looking forward to working with Chairman McDaniel and Vice Chair Saunders to continue serving @CollierPIO residents! #SWFL https://t.co/LZFsFUwd1v

I am proud to stand with @RosLehtinen as the President signs the NICA Act into law. I commend her leadership on this crucial legislation, and so many other bills and issues that she has championed during her three decades in Congress
Since April, the ppl of Nicaragua have taken to the streets to denounce the oppression+violence carried out by Ortega+his thugs. This imp bill supports the Nicaraguan ppl in their demands for rule of law, #humanrights,+free, fair elections by denying resources to their oppressors
It provides @POTUS w additional authority to impose tough sanctions on operatives of the Ortega regime, and cuts off resources to the regime as well as providing sanctions against countries that assist it.
After swift passage in Congress of the #NicaAct and its signing into law, the US once again stands in strong solidarity with those seeking freedom from tyranny.
This afternoon, I participated in the bill signing of H.R. 1918, the Nicaraguan Investment and Conditionality Act (NICA). I am an original co-sponsor of this bill and have ardently supported sanctions against members of Daniel Ortega's regime. #NicaAct

Expanding transit in our community is critical to alleviating the traffic and gridlock that we face daily, and I am grateful for these much-needed dollars.
The BUILD grant will help support continued growth+expansion of the South-Dade Transitway corridor. Specifically, the grant will help increase capacity at two park-and-ride facilities along the corridor, directly supporting the County TPO‚Äôs vote to move toward bus-rapid transit.
True to my word, in my working with the Administration and with the County‚Äôs application moving forward at DOT, here is the first installment of federal dollars to compliment the implementation of the SMART Plan.
As the County continues to work with DOT, specifically the Federal Transit Administration, on the project development phase of the South Corridor Rapid Transit Project, I stand ready to assist in any way possible.
For years, I‚Äôve told the County that I am willing and able to help fund their transit needs, once a viable plan had been submitted. To their credit the County has finally taken real, tangible steps forward w the SMART Plan over the last several months, &amp; I commend their progress.

@NRFnews In the last 10 months, we have seen the rolling benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on both small businesses and working-class families. In that same time, Congress has also worked to reduce burdensome regulations that stifle innovation and hurt entrepreneurs‚Äô bottom lines.

As a Member of @HouseAppropsGOP, I was also pleased to craft and vote for a funding bill that allocates $6.6 billion across several agencies to provide our first responders and those struggling with addiction the support needed from the federal level to combat this crisis.
I have met w local law enforcement+other first responders, and I understand the difficulties they face as they deal with addiction-related emergencies. This past summer, the House passed over 50 bills that work towards prevention, treatment,+enforcement to curb the opioid crisis.
Opioids are ravaging our communities, and with the support of the President, Congress is continuing its commitment to address this dangerous epidemic.
Every day, an average of 115 people across the United States are dying due to opioid-related causes. It does not discriminate against color, age, ethnicity, or socio-economic status and continues to take loved ones away from their families far too soon. #opioidcrisis

I worked tirelessly with my Florida delegation colleagues and leadership to champion the EAA Reservoir in the House, which protects the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee and the Sunshine State‚Äôs coastlines, and I applaud its enactment.
The bill also makes way for a major component of greater #Everglades restoration efforts underway in #Florida. It ensures that progress towards the expedited completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike seamlessly coincides with Lake Okeechobee‚Äôs water regulation schedule.
It also authorizes a 5-year harmful algal bloom technology development demonstration. Along with funding I have helped secure through @HouseAppropsGOP this provision will go a long way towards addressing this critical issue.
Florida‚Äôs businesses, its tourism industry, and its ecosystem continue to suffer because of this toxic substance. I have met with individuals affected by this and seen the impacts to our community firsthand.

@HouseAppropsGOP Read more about the bills and the provisions included in the @HouseAppropsGOP minibus bill here: https://t.co/LeKeEwo2mB
@HouseAppropsGOP I'm proud to have had a part in securing the necessary funding from Congress. As an Appropriator + Founder and Co-Chair of the House Everglades Caucus, I will continue to be a stalwart advocate for Everglades restoration and ensure the necessary funds are delivered to our state.
@HouseAppropsGOP These funds, combined with the $514 million I helped secure this July from the hurricane relief and recovery funding package, are anticipated to complete this much-needed rehabilitation project by 2022-2023.
@HouseAppropsGOP Similarly, w passage of the Appropriations bill, #SoFla will continue to see dividends as the bill contains provisions that further the expedited completion of the dike, as well as #Everglades restoration. Specifically, it provides the dike with $96M, $14M above last year‚Äôs level
@HouseAppropsGOP The bill also includes a provision to ensure Lake Okeechobee's water levels coincide with the expedited completion of the Herbert Hoover Dike, reducing the risk of flooding in the surrounding Hendry County communities.
@HouseAppropsGOP The EAA Reservoir is a much-needed solution as Lake Okeechobee + Southern Florida's coasts continue to suffer from algal bloom. The reservoir has been a top priority for #FL, and I am glad we could work together with our partners at the local and state levels to address the issue

As Chairman of @HouseAppropsGOP Transportation Subcommittee, I have successfully secured record levels of funding for transportation and infrastructure. I remain ready and willing as ever to help however I can to bring these much-needed dollars home to Southern Florida.
Though this process is far from over, County leadership is finally showing they are serious about building a more modernized and efficient transit system, and I am optimistic this will lead to eligibility for federal support.
For years, I have watched in frustration as concrete solutions were never presented to federal partners and the County was unable to qualify for the billions of $ I have made available for infrastructure projects around the country.

It is totally unacceptable, for any reason, to purposely separate minor children from their parents. Any and every other option should be implemented in order to not separate minors from their parents, which I believe is unconscionable.

The #JCPOA was a bad deal from the very beginning. Instead of suppressing #Iran‚Äôs illicit and destabilizing activities, it provided the mullahs with the funds to support Hamas, Hizbollah, and other terrorist activity around the world. https://t.co/anQfM8bcy6

I am pleased with the work we have done to upgrade our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, and am humbled that my Subcommittee Chairmanship affords me the unique opportunity to help our nation and our local community. #SFL
Housing for the elderly is funded at $632M, vouchers for disabled citizens is funded at $390M, and housing assistance for those living with HIV/AIDS is funded at $393M. I am confident we are helping those with the most need in this legislation.
Also included is $1.2 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which leverages this funding with private investments to create more affordable housing options.
Expanding access to affordable #housing is also emphasized in this legislation. CDBG grants are funded at $3.3 billion dollars, providing localities with the opportunity to apply for grants that address community development, poverty, and other infrastructure needs.
With this bill, our local community is empowered to revitalize the roads, bridges, buses, and rail lines we use every day.
Our local #airports can pull from $500M provided to Airport Grants, our community will receive needed funds from $4.25B provided for Highway Grants, + our bus&amp;rail systems can benefit from $2.6B provided for Cap Investment Grants or $800 million for transit infrastructure grants
In turn, this will create jobs across the country and locally, and will lead to a boost in our economy. Right here in #SFL, localities can compete for the $750 million provided to the multimodal BUILD program for new infrastructure projects.
For the second year in a row, I have worked to protect hard-earned taxpayer dollars and reduce waste and abuse, while providing historic funding levels to improve our airports, roads, bridges, and seaports.
Just now, I introduced the @HouseAppropsGOP #Transportation and #Housing bill for FY19. Here are some details about this bill and how it can impact #SFL.

The regime in Iran cannot be trusted, and today‚Äôs withdrawal gives the United States and our allies a chance to forge a better path toward global stability and a nuclear-free Iran.
I commend the Trump Administration for taking this bold step to withdraw from this reckless deal that poses a threat to the United States, and for standing with our close ally Israel.
Additionally, Iran has continued developing its missile arsenal, launching over 20 ballistic missiles since the deal was signed in 2015.
Iran continues to assist its terrorist proxies and international terrorist networks, directly endangering U.S. soldiers and America‚Äôs allies, has exacerbated violence in Syria, Yemen and Iraq, as well as instability in Lebanon.
Since then, the deal has provided legitimacy and millions in economic relief to a murderous, oppressive regime that opposes U.S. interests and threatens America‚Äôs allies.
As I said after my vote opposing it in 2015, the Iran deal paved the way for a dangerous state sponsor of terrorism to achieve what it wanted most ‚Äì nuclear weapons, and the means and funds to deliver them.
I strongly support the Trump Administration‚Äôs withdrawal from the reckless and dangerous Iran deal, a serious threat to our national security that finances global terrorism.

2018 #TaxDay is the last time you'll file your taxes through an archaic system. The #TaxCutsandJobsAct simplified our tax code and lowered taxes for American families! Read more: https://t.co/auOChViCm7 https://t.co/IU01s5fKBn

I look forward to continue working with @POTUS, @VP, and my congressional colleagues to provide more opportunities for American families across the country.
I was honored to welcome @POTUS to #Hialeah this afternoon to continue the conversation on tax reform and discuss the impact it has had thus far with local business owners.
Lower taxes and a simplified tax code are also helping individuals and families, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks.
More than 4 million workers (and counting) are seeing wage increases, obtaining bonuses, and receiving other employee investments; companies small and large are passing on the benefits of the bill to their workforce.
Since the passage of the #TaxCutsandJobsAct in December, we have seen the positive impact #taxreform has had on our economy. At 4.1%, the unemployment rate continues to drop as employers are able to create more jobs, expanding opportunities to more Americans.
Doral's @BiscayneBayBrew owner Jose Maella tells @POTUS that his small craft beer brewery was able to purchase $100k in new equipment, increasing their production by 40%, and adding jobs. #TaxCutsandJobsAct
Irina Vilari√±o, owner of Las Vegas Cuban Cuisine, says that in the short time since the passage of #TaxCutsandJobsAct, her hourly employees have seen an average of 20% in wage increases. #FL25
"#TaxCutsandJobsAct has allowed many hardworking people, including many here in #Hialeah to keep more of their paychecks." -@MarioDB
.@POTUS' support for a free #Cuba and a free #Venezuela is so important to our community. #FL25

His retirement after this session of Congress is a huge loss for Wisconsin and our country; there are few people who are as passionate, dedicated, and patriotic as Paul Ryan. He is a good man, loving husband, and devoted father, and I am lucky to count him among my friends.

.@SpeakerRyan has dutifully served our Congress and the American people as Speaker of the House.  But for me he is much more than just our Speaker; he is a dear friend.  We both come from very different backgrounds, but we formed a bond and friendship that went beyond our work.
