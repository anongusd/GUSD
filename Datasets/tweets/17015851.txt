Meeting about new Fort Collins brewery is void of answers http://t.co/pB13VL3QHg via @coloradoan
@jawtry Tense at times, overall I think people were frustrated with not getting a lot of answers on a project that could impact their lives.
@hansincolorado I actually asked them why the secrecy. Their response: "no comment."
One of the applicants just told me "no comment" when I asked what his last name was?!?
Check out Fcgov.developmentreview for the notes on the meeting or read my story in tomorrow's @coloradoan
Property owner closes meeting calling for "collaboration."
@NapaofBeerGirl @FeastingFC It sounds like they have a plan, but don't want to disclose it.
One resident said the location makes a lot of sense based on the brewers fest and tour de fat.
One resident said they will always fight this because it is not the best neighborhood and they should find a new location now.
We're no going to be a club we're not going to have booming bass we want to be part of the community, brewery applicant says.
Applicants say they will be the same size as @paterosbrew and @equinoxbrewing in terms of square feet.
This could become more of an issue as breweries start to open near homes.
One woman said the increased activity from the brewery would make the area safer.
Applicants have not determined if they will offer growlers yet at they brewery.
Residents saying the applicants need to give them information if they really want to be part of the community.
One resident just assigned the applicants a "C-" on their performance.
Residents are getting irritated with not getting any answers to their questions.
Residents are demanding another hearing with more information. Calling for a "do over."
The architectural drawings are still in the works for the brewery.
@kyle_mccall apparently so. I don't get up that way enough to see it personally.
Opposition to the brewery appears to be growing here. Some disagreement over ability to keep drunk patrons out of the neighborhood.
Applicants say that they don't anticipate generating that much traffic, they are banking on bikes.
And ... We're back on parking. I think this area has a serious parking problem brewery or no brewery.
Brewery applicants could not say what the production of the brewery would be, said they may distribute.
Resident asked if they could do without the taproom, applicants  declined to answer.
@FeastingFC indeed.
@NoCoBeerFool @FeastingFC http://t.co/ukFBerjmiK
There is a school nearby that is causing some residents to question the brewery's potential location.
The building has been vacant for a bit but it appears to have been a trucking co. at one time.
@FeastingFC I asked and they said "no comment," thus it will remain a mystery.
The applicants declined to disclose the name of the brewery.
Lots of questions about traffic congestion with the location for this brewery.
Applicants say they can't disclose the brewery's business plan but promise something different that beer drinkers will like.
Applicants don't have their hours set yet and there is no liquor license planned.
Residents concerns are focused on noise, parking and occupancy as well as hours.
Applicants say this would not be an Odell or New Belgium in terms of size.
Building is 5,000 SF, they are not sure what the occupancy would be.
Applicants say it will have a tasting room with a focus on sampling. Stress it is not a bar.
The next step from here would be a formal application with the city for this project.
There are about 20 people in attendance.
Neighborhood meeting on the mystery brewery at 302 N. Meldrum is underway.
