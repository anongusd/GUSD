@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul Despite the fact the tweet you replied to berates both parties, but whatever. I like exploring the cognitive processes of people who think in binary terms. It‚Äôs fascinating.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul No you continue to reply don‚Äôt you. You understand the basics of conversation right. I replied to your the tweet on how you were victimized. In fact I didn‚Äôt start this, you replied in an overly simplistic manner and with contradictory evidence assumed my political position.

@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul I‚Äôm a disabled veteran with time to kill. What‚Äôs your excuse for continuing this exchange?
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul Additionally since you can‚Äôt read I didn‚Äôt once defend Democrats much less claim to support them. In fact I‚Äôve consistently berated both parties equally. It isn‚Äôt my fault that you can‚Äôt read English.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul And since apparently you can‚Äôt read I was a lifelong Republican. That‚Äôs hardly a liberal. Just in case you‚Äôre wondering that‚Äôs insult. You‚Äôre reading comprehension sucks. It also appears you‚Äôre think skinned snowflake like the liberals you despise.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul I didn‚Äôt call you stupid. I‚Äôll say it again stupidity destroys. End statement. New statement you think in binary terms. If you think they are connected that‚Äôs your perception.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul Stupidity destroys and it‚Äôs apparent that you only think in binary terms.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul No, I know it‚Äôs more complex than Dems are socialist and GOP are Nazis. The need to accept easy answers for a myriad of systematic political failures is one of the problems occurring in our political culture. However, if you choose to be a sheep that‚Äôs your business.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul Can‚Äôt read can you? That‚Äôs an overly simplistic view. Perhaps you don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs more complex than that.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul I was a lifelong Republican, and my point still stands. It‚Äôs your choice to be overly simplistic about complex political issues. Go ahead blame one party it only plays in to the highly charged partisan atmosphere that is making our collective problems worse.
@Louisebucher3 @mbradhoo @RandPaul That‚Äôs overly simplistic, that‚Äôs like saying Republicans are Nazis. Neither of which is accurate.

@Christner_A95 @mbradhoo @RandPaul Think that is pretty apparent from both sides.

@Tim62146528 @marcorubio @POTUS I'm an idiot? 300,000 is still less than million moron. Also, we're going in debt so yeah it really is one or the other but definitely not both.
@njwindward @AnnCoulter It's estimated that they pay more in to the system than they can get out but without any data, it's impossible to come to a conclusion as they are unlikely to share the fact they are illegal. One can only come with an educated answer.
@njwindward @AnnCoulter Not as much as you think and it's impossible to estimate it. The only services they can obtain is public education for their children and healthcare in emergency situations. Offsetting this is the fact that they pay all local taxes and some state/federal taxes.
@Tim62146528 @marcorubio @POTUS You want 50k over millions. That's your choice, it's stupid choice but feel free to feel good measure that doesn't even address the issue.
@Tim62146528 @marcorubio @POTUS I'm not ignoring it, I said it's the smallest part of the problem. You're arguing to spend 5 billion dollars on a problem that won't be solved since they'll simply cross somewhere else on the 2000 mile border and government funds are limited. What makes more sense?
@irheaum @marcorubio @POTUS The wall in question would only cover 1/20 of our southern border which makes in ineffective as migrants will only cross somewhere there isn't a wall. Hopefully that explains the difference.
@irheaum @marcorubio @POTUS Democrats have already offered money to replace/improve the barrier/fence that is already in place. Since Trump refused it, then it isn't just a matter of a barrier/fence. He wants a wall, which isn't all that more effective than what Democrats have already proposed.
@njwindward @AnnCoulter Reform our immigration process. It's the cause of most of these issues anyways.
@Tim62146528 @marcorubio @POTUS What's more effective a wall that only covers 1/20th of our southern border in which those 50k people will just cross somewhere else, or giving ICE more money to get the millions who over stay their visa. You call it an opinion I call it logic.
@Tim62146528 @marcorubio @POTUS Fact is that most illegals are here on overstayed visas not border crossers. A wall is literally an argument for the smallest portion of the problem. If one really wanted to deal with illegal immigrants, they'd give ICE more money for more manpower.

@LindseyGrahamSC Tit for tat? That doesn't help the situation Democrats were voted in to oppose the wall. Unstoppable force meet immovable object the partisan base of both sides won't accept it.
@RabidDogsBite @AnnCoulter It is literally feel good legislation designed to pander for votes from people who fear brown immigrants. Majority of illegals are people who overstay their visas (and flew here), 90% of the drugs are smuggled at entry points and plane. A wall doesn't effect either of those.
@RabidDogsBite @AnnCoulter History has shown no wall to be effective, the Berlin Wall was created to stop defectors from crossing in to West Berlin and it was the site of where most people were smuggled in to the west.
@njwindward @AnnCoulter This what Trump, Coulter, and Limbaugh done to the GOP prayed on their fear offer ineffective plans that won't solve the problem to pander for votes and sell books. Now Republicans are as doe eyed and unrealistic as liberals.
@njwindward @AnnCoulter Really you want us to spend money on the hope of it being effective? As  a fiscal conservative that's a waste of government resources. Additionally, in order for a wall to be effective it must be manned and maintained. The cost of manning a 2000 mile wall is beyond our budget.

@IngrahamAngle I thought migrants were demographic changes we didn't vote for? Now your concerned about their livelihood?
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Yes, when Fox reports critical facts against Democrats, that isn't bias that's just good journalism right? It's ridiculous that media can't report anything critical about Trump without being called bias yet you want people to accept anything critical about your opposition astruth
@OpinionatedAlc1 @Ronnie_D_Lynch @SenTedCruz @SenSchumer So in other words Sen, Cruz criticism bullshit because it's two different things. Which is my point hence saying it out loud about the 4 billion additional dollars. Thought it was obvious...
@Melchizedek1972 @LindseyGrahamSC @Jim_Jordan Obviously I don't dispute that as a fact. Whether one believe it's abusive is entirely a different matter that tends to be based on one's partisan bias. As I think both parties are wrong in regard to opposition research, so that aspect has no value to me.

@anderso_alex @justin__rosado @patrickianrice @mr_consuelo_ @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Honestly I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about that. On one hand a crisis forces GOP to make a decision possibly splintering the part which I like. Gives us folks who aren‚Äôt Trumpists and not liberals a choice, on the other hand it could invest even more power in to the presidency.
@anderso_alex @justin__rosado @patrickianrice @mr_consuelo_ @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Rule of law counts, if we wouldn‚Äôt convict him in a trial given the evidence, logically you can‚Äôt condemn him either.
@anderso_alex @justin__rosado @patrickianrice @mr_consuelo_ @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I lean conservative as well and believe Garland should have been confirmed. I also oppose Trump and don‚Äôt find that he isn‚Äôt a conservative.
@justin__rosado @anderso_alex @patrickianrice @mr_consuelo_ @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Nothing Alex stayed supports the conclusion he‚Äôs a centrist. He simply stated that there isn‚Äôt enough information to condemn him. Politics isn‚Äôt a binary choice.
@patrickianrice @justin__rosado @anderso_alex @mr_consuelo_ @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I won‚Äôt argue that finding a judge without a scandal is the better choice but arguing that he wasn‚Äôt on trial while ignoring the consequences of letting an allegation become the standard of proof against someone has potentially devastating impact on our country is irresponsible.
@patrickianrice @justin__rosado @anderso_alex @mr_consuelo_ @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake You do understand the implications right? Being rejected for this reason but not going forward with any prosecution is no different than conviction without a trial. His career would have ended over an allegation. 1/2

A more thorough investigation was warranted.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I can't find the tweet when you said you weren't a Democrat but I don't really care. You're all over the place anyhow.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Yes, I get you want Republicans to not be Republicans. Not hard to follow.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I'll just pretend this tweet didn't happen for posterity. https://t.co/nKbJCSS3xL
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake LOL! So Republicans are evil right.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake LOL this just keeps getting better and better.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I would tell the difference but it would go over your head.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Well since Trumpist hate establishment Republicans good luck with defining them the same.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake LOL, Republicans aren't evil yet now they are and you had problems being called a Democrat/liberal OH man. I just want to keep this going because I can't believe someone would be dumb enough to think people would go against things they wanted because of single individual.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake So you wanted him to not be a Republican, wow!
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Oh my God! You finally got it, he's an establishment Republican which would not make him a Trumpist praise Jesus.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake So you're saying he should have not voted for people he would have voted for anyways that any other Republican would have nominated. Ok I got what I needed.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I'm going to assume that for you to accept opposition of Trump one would have to the opposite of what he supports for them to qualify even if they advocated for it prior. This why tribalism is so stupid.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake You kind of made my point the legislation didn't get drafted till Nov 18, at which point he didn't vote for a single nominee. 		Are you daft? Why can't you understand that he voted on Republican positions just because Trump was for it doesn't mean he voted with Trump.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake No, I didn't. I said Flake didn't vote for a single nominee after he said he wouldn't and he didn't. 		What a term "Republican resistance" again at what point would Republicans oppose their own positions. If you read correctly I said he voted against him when they differed.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake You do realize that the move to protect Mueller didn't became a thing until Sessions was on his way out right? Until it was confirmed he was out early in 2019 Flake any many others were perfectly ok with Rod Rosenstein handling the investigation.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Damage according to your perspective Republicans wanted it, so again why would he oppose something he advocated for. I mean I don't know how I can say it any simpler. You're equating Republican positions and Trump positions as equal. They aren't hence why many Republicans left.

@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake There wasn't anyone else to vote for at that point OMG.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake He has low approval rating among Republicans, the admission is lose a primary to a pro-Trump Republican which he is correct. Republicans love Trump.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Here's one from a national news source just in case you needed it. https://t.co/HL5zVfZcik
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Kavanaugh and Pruitt were both confirmed before Nov 18 of 2018. 		https://t.co/9GTJRgf6pA		https://t.co/OjVTga7c6B
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake No you can't. https://t.co/kTOhj1CDM8
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Sigh..... He drafted the Mueller legislation AFTER the Kavanaugh vote. Look it up.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake And no we don't. I'm done this expectation that people should stop doing things they support because Trump supports it too is idiotic.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake So you don't care that he's been advocating for policies long before Trump was even in to politics. Makes perfect sense, you're right Flake should oppose things he's been advocating for years. Perfectly logical.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake My first reply. Try again. https://t.co/yiFV00F8zA
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Really then explain him not voting for a single nominee until the Senate voted for protecting Mueller and no I'll say it one last time he's voting on Republican policies which makes sense since he's a Republican.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake A strawman is when one refutes an argument you never made. Your making the argument that Flake didn't oppose him, when he did, and point out a policy Republicans have campaigned for decades as his support for Trump and not for Republicans.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Curious what exactly is the strawman? You claim Flake agrees with Trump but then cite specific policy that Republicans have been campaigning on for decades. Most of the things he supports are Republican policies and you're angry that he does that despite being a Republican.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake You're missing the point.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Agreeing with Trump because he does things one likes doesn't make one a supporter. Trump administration worked to end mandatory sentencing should I oppose that just because I don't like Trump. That sounds stupid.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Because you called Republicans evil and used centrist as a pejorative term....		He did oppose Trump, after he stated he wouldn't vote for a single nomination until the Senate voted to protect Mueller which is the epitome of opposing Trump. 1/2
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Some people value security over freedom which how that policy began.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Well you seem to support Democrats despite voting for it during the Obama era, that's a policy Obama continued after Bush started it with the Patriot act. Why just blame Republicans and Flake?
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake One topic does not make a case, and I'm sure you know every citizen in Arizona personally to make such a claim.		Again, he's a Republican supporting Republican policies, remind me what party Trump is in? Thinking he was going to go against everything Trump did is wisful thinking.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake And better extra-curricular activities, despite both of us coming from a  family that couldn't help with tuition. The only difference between us  is he's white and I'm not. I call that creating a special class which I find disgusting. Doesn't stop me from supporting Dems though.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Second, evil is a subjective term based on personal perspective. Liberals support affirmative action without any regard to the problems it caused. I got a full ride scholarship from a university while my step-brother did not despite having slightly better test scores 2/3
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake First I'm not a centrist, I just don't treat politics as a team sport. I  support policies and candidates based on its/their own merits not  because some party supports something. 1/3
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Yeah, your point? Isn't that his job? The majority of Arizonans who voted for him liked what he what he stood for should not do it because another group who didn't vote for him want something else? This coming from a guy who couldn't stand him when he was my Congressman.
@justin__rosado @patrickianrice @trogo24 @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake My point is that he's still a Republican, I'm assuming you're a liberal so of course you aren't going to like the things he voted for. Flake however did vote against him on the things he said he would which is what he's getting credit for. We'll see in 2020 if he makes good.
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Yes, we've had a history of SCJ who were perfect, the equal but separate ruling that gave birth to segregation was an example of such perfection.		I'm done this is asinine.
@neudman @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Till money gets out of the system it isn't likely to change.
@neudman @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake It is, but it's the fault of a myriad of things but if you want to blame someone blame both parties they both are in the pockets of health insurance. I worked as a therapist,
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Clarence Thomas would have been a better comparison, but in any case faulting people for being human beings with flaws is certainly one way to judge someone. I suppose you're perfect.
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake 1)Apparently Supreme Court Justices can't be human. 		2) Comparing HRC isn't to Kavanaugh isn't apples to apples. She's a politician who's been scrutinize for over 20 years and she has lost her cool in the 90's. He's a judge with little to no experience in the public eye. 1/2
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Wow, what a strawman! Read carefully since I made a simple statement of fact. It isn't unusual for someone to display anger or hostility when they feel they are being unjustly persecuted that fits in "normal behavior". Regardless of my personal feelings about it.
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake No. It's highly unusual for someone to not get emotional over being accused of something they claim they didn't commit /sarcasm
@neudman @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Not really, trying to attribute an opposing viewpoint as evil is stupid and only promotes tribalism. Conservatives think Republicans capitulate too often to Democrats, all that thinking does is cause division. I'm happy when both sides don't get what they want.
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Asking a Republican to vote on something against their constituents' wants is political suicide. It was an impossible situation for them, without anything corroborates her testimony. For Republicans it absolutely was required anything less risked being primaried by someone worse
@txmedic37 @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Sigh.... Let me connect the dots, lawmakers rejecting someone on allegations alone without prosecuting (it wouldn't have gone anywhere) is a literal example of irony. 1/2
@neudman @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake You mean money.
@patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Unfortunately there wasn‚Äôt any real facts to support her testimony, that‚Äôs how our justice system works. I believed her but I understand why others didn‚Äôt or wouldn‚Äôt act on it. Unless of course you think someone‚Äôs word alone merits a conviction.
@neudman @patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake That‚Äôs hyperbole, wouldn‚Äôt take long for me to find laws/policies that Democrats supported that got people killed. Here‚Äôs one mandatory sentencing for non-violent drug offenders. Quit treating politics like a team sport.
@patrickianrice @hazardc @neudman @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Please learn to read, I said there isn‚Äôt a case of him voting for anything he hasn‚Äôt already advocated for and voted against Trump where they differ. TL,DR: Republicans voting Republican shocker...

@patrickianrice @trogo24 @justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake I‚Äôll never understand the need to attribute malice to opposing viewpoints. He voted for things his constituents voted him in for and there isn‚Äôt a single instance of him voting for something that he didn‚Äôt advocate for prior to Trump.
@justin__rosado @YouGetGOD @JeffFlake Are you criticizing him for voting conservative? Newsflash he is one, one can‚Äôt expect him to not vote for things he advocated before Trump was even in politics. The things they differ on he voted against Trump and has consistently called for legislation to protect Mueller.

@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 I know, it requires some thought on your part to connect the dots. Since interest rates are raised in preparation for a downturn I‚Äôm obviously referring to the predictions not current status. Raising interest rates during a sluggish economy makes it worse...
@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Growth began under Obama using your logic undoing them would hurt not help, nor are you giving Obama credit where its due.

@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 I‚Äôll say it one last time FED hike is direct response to criticism from economists who said that if a downturn occurs we can‚Äôt use monetary policy because interest rates were already low. The criticism of raising it was due to the fact that raise=slowing growth.
@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 I stated that a downturn is predicted as we‚Äôve had an unprecedented bull market for 8/9 years. I also stated the economy is cyclical means I‚Äôm neither blaming or giving credit for economic circumstances to politicians. I never voted for Obama FYI.

@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Reducing economic growth seems counter productive until you realize that the FED main strategy to incentivize economic growth is to reduce interest rates to encourage borrowing and spending from consumers and businesses. Thus if the FED raises rates its due to predicted downturn.
@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Not sure if your being dense on purpose. When you raise interest rates that decreases borrowing from banks and encourages savings which reduces consumers and business spending. When you reduce spending that slows economic growth.
@Marymac6 @RanWiz @mattweathers15 @adamiswright @Trumponomy @hi_hat_truth @charliekirk11 And I‚Äôm not from California, full of assumptions aren‚Äôt you.

@Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @Trumponomy @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Obviously it isn‚Äôt since you somehow believe that I as a former Republican wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with it then. Additionally, you have no evidence suggesting that I didn‚Äôt.

@Marymac6 @RanWiz @mattweathers15 @adamiswright @Trumponomy @hi_hat_truth @charliekirk11 No wall in human history has ever controlled any border. Plus in order for a wall to be even remotely effective it needs to be maintained and manned. The cost of that would be trillions over a 10 year period.  We share a 2000 mile border with Mexico, think about it.

@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Economics 101 Its monetary policy FED wants to reduce spending (which fuels economic growth) in preparation so they can reduce rates when the economy slows down. Typically they raise rates a few years before a predicted downturn because the economy is cyclical.
@Trumponomy @Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Seriously? Stock markets will react to some policies the President will enact but that alone isn‚Äôt an indicator of total economic health. Hence the drop due to the China deal but yet our economy is growing. Like I said indirect influence which is what most policies do.
@RanWiz @Marymac6 @adamiswright @Trumponomy @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 I‚Äôm a fiscal conservative, or a conservative leaning libertarian to be more precise.

@Marymac6 @RanWiz @adamiswright @Trumponomy @hi_hat_truth @mattweathers15 @charliekirk11 Economy is cyclical attributing to the President whom for the most part only has indirect influence is laughable.

No one is arguing that HRC cover up wasn‚Äôt worse but the action that begun the scandal before deleting emails was using an unsecured server. The amount of usage or position is trivial.
@garybox4 @jameslfregosi @bookkeepPLUS @BobbyL_AZ @rickwtyler @Sweetpea593 @IvankaTrump The cover up isn‚Äôt even all that relevant as of yet.

@jameslfregosi @garybox4 @BobbyL_AZ @bookkeepPLUS @rickwtyler @Sweetpea593 @IvankaTrump Curious what‚Äôs the difference? They both are handling classified information. I know it‚Äôs because one of them has a D by their name.... God your transparent.

@jameslfregosi @BobbyL_AZ @bookkeepPLUS @rickwtyler @Sweetpea593 @IvankaTrump As someone who held secret clearance in the military I knew better and the information I dealt with was far less sensitive than Ivanka. Funny thing to me from both crowds either side is rarely criticized their own.
@jameslfregosi @BobbyL_AZ @bookkeepPLUS @rickwtyler @Sweetpea593 @IvankaTrump But it is the same thing obfuscating this with a relatively trivial point with exact position is weak argument at best. The scandal was HRC used a private server to conduct official business, Ivanka did the same. (1/2)

@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand You‚Äôve said nothing to contest the fact this is completely a partisan argument meant to capitalize on Trump‚Äôs unpopularity with women voters.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand No it hasn‚Äôt how about you practice that reading comprehension you complained about. I‚Äôm saying that any inequalities we have had nothing to do with arbitrary numbers that hold little relevance to the larger picture which is the lack of choice.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand You replied to my tweet jackass, how about you leave me to my life. I responded to a reply you made.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand There was a lack of reading comprehension I stated on multiple occasions that my point is the Senator‚Äôs tweet has nothing to do with statistics. I didn‚Äôt choose to argue that you did.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand And yet here you are replying. You already knew I wasn‚Äôt going to agree with you. I wasn‚Äôt trying to convince you of anything you chose this fight.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Bottomline it takes money to make money. The only color that matters is green.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Because it ignores the circumstance that the current socioeconomic status of minorities is reflective of years of economic inequality. That doesn‚Äôt change overnight nor does our current economic system foster the same opportunities.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand The inequality as you call it can be better explained by the inefficiency of our electoral process than any gender bias.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand You‚Äôre only willing to accept one conclusion because it supports your politics. I accept that most people couldn‚Äôt care less about the optics and in a system where at most we only get two real choices.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand I did a thesis on systemic inequality in terms of the justice system. The results wasn‚Äôt that our system was racist it was due to socioeconomic status. The racism resulted from the stereotype of eschewed proportions when it came to who was being jailed more often.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand No that‚Äôs where you led the conversation and I didn‚Äôt bring in proportions or statistics you did. There are also several tweets stating that wasn‚Äôt my point to which you ignored.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand No there isn‚Äôt just one explanation. I can come up with innocuous one that easily fits the criteria. Several districts are gerrymandered resulting in unopposed elections. Thus several thousand people are voting for a man when if given a choice they may have voted for a woman.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand This can be adequately explained by not attributing any nefarious motives from any one opposing it. My argument was never the statistics it was the rhetoric being used don‚Äôt confuse the two.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand No it‚Äôs political rhetoric in regards to keep people emotionally involved because that how to get people to vote. The number itself is completely arbitrary and you know that. The tweet itself wasn‚Äôt from the point of any statistics analysis, you‚Äôre trying to argue that it is.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand At first I was being rough on you because I thought you were being obtuse on purpose. I get the feeling you‚Äôre an idealistic kid. You‚Äôre attempting to find an explanation to fit your agenda rather than looking for the simplest answer.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand It isn‚Äôt example of inequality, most people don‚Äôt think about that and it‚Äôs an error to assume malice when stupidity can explain it. In most cases red or blue people vote based on a single issue. The two things aren‚Äôt related at all.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand And no statistically it is not a foregone conclusion that it will happen. The distribution of outcomes just need to be within a certain tolerance. We‚Äôre not there yet but at the same time statements like these only serve as ammunition to people who see the obvious bias.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand It only requires that people aren‚Äôt influenced by ethnicity or gender. At any rate the senators tweet isn‚Äôt reflective of statistical analysis, it‚Äôs an argument to use gender as a factor largely due to the unpopularity that Trump has with women. Not that he doesn‚Äôt deserve it.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand It isn‚Äôt just rich men, it‚Äôs also boards of directors, and interests groups with a cause all using any information to further their agenda. In any case for equality to be achieved it doesn‚Äôt require representative make up to proportional.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Most money being donated is generally from wealthy individuals, interested groups, or companies and the individual bias is at play when they donate money. Again it‚Äôs a poor argument looking at the bigger picture objectively.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand It *could* be one of the results it doesn‚Äôt mean that it *has* to be. This also ignores several other factors such as voting trends in specific districts and the all important factor being money is required.
@jasoninthehouse Wasn‚Äôt her lawsuit to stop counting votes in specific counties?
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Like I said it isn‚Äôt exact and you should get a refund from whomever taught you statistics.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand 51% is an arbitrary number to begin with. Never hitting doesn‚Äôt imply gender bias. If we are vastly above or below a threshold that would imply it.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand There would be a margin of error for the smaller sample if women are 51% of the population assuming equality in all other variables would still leave any sample representing it in a range of percentages below and above the proportion given.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Seriously dude? When you take a sample from a larger group it‚Äôs make will be approximately the same ratio. That‚Äôs math, to propose an exact proportion is using statistics wrong. Math doesn‚Äôt support your premise.

@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand It‚Äôs also not the point I made either. It‚Äôs an argument to justify gender as a factor in voting. Quit trying to use statistics as an exact science it‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs a margin of error in any random sample.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Not if you‚Äôre trying to argue that proportions are exact. There would be range of percentages to reflect smaller groups taken randomly from a larger one.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Doesn‚Äôt apply here. There are more variables at play then simply being a good politician.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SenGillibrand No I‚Äôm not saying that at all. I‚Äôm saying the exact proportion is irrelevant.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Why should we expect it? More to the point why is it even relevant? It‚Äôs a poor argument to make. Either we live in a world where ethnicity or gender matter or it doesn‚Äôt.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SenGillibrand Then to what are you referring to in the previous paragraph of what I‚Äôm arguing for? https://t.co/9uJw6zpvTl
@BeerGuy33068907 @SenGillibrand Funny, you‚Äôre accusing me of putting words in your mouth stating I was arguing to vote women in arbitrarily. When I‚Äôm obviously arguing that gender shouldn‚Äôt be a factor anyways. You‚Äôre right it won‚Äôt be fruitful.
@SuzzanahB @SenGillibrand Let‚Äôs follow your logic. I‚Äôm Asian and we‚Äôre largely underrepresented in the US should I use ethnicity as a factor as who should represent us. Of course not ethnicity doesn‚Äôt matter, what matters is this person the best person for the job. Don‚Äôt be biased.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SenGillibrand You seem to be trying to argue both. Either gender is a factor that influences one‚Äôs decision or it isn‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs the former that‚Äôs showing gender bias if you‚Äôre ok with that accept but don‚Äôt use statistics to justify it.

@BeerGuy33068907 @SenGillibrand What this equates to is using statistics to justify gender biased argument. If the country had more men than women you wouldn‚Äôt argue that men deserve equal representation.
@BeerGuy33068907 @SenGillibrand So you believe that gender should be a qualification in who you vote for? Wasn‚Äôt that the problem in the first place? Equality would mean that gender isn‚Äôt relevant in the decision on whom should lead the country. (1/2)

@amybettys @SenGillibrand You‚Äôre right there are more women in this country and in the world for that matter but that‚Äôs not the argument I made. To require gender as a qualification is wrong. Voting on that basis of gender alone created an inequality that needed to be addressed. (1/2)

Because the GOP doesn‚Äôt like their politics. I don‚Äôt agree with their politics either but I can live with it every one has an opinion.
@2shotOlympia @9ei8ht7 @AnnCoulter Gee how easily manipulated you are. Liberals aren‚Äôt changing demographics they choose to come here. Sad part a larger percentage of immigrants used to vote Republican. The fact you can‚Äôt see it makes me almost sympathetic that you‚Äôre being manipulated.

@1bullcon2 @CNN @CheriBustos Thank you that was my point. If you‚Äôre angry about Kavanaugh which I was there isn‚Äôt any of evidence but not angry at this baseless accusations you‚Äôre a hypocrite.
