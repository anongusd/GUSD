@donedadanada @ECrocker34 @dillondanis @TheNotoriousMMA 		Lol... they’re plain stupid letting Nevada and UFC take advantage of them.		MMA deserves its reputation for harboring low-IQ savages. 		Conor couldn’t even find an attorney from a well-ranked law school.		Might as well let his son play football and get CTE.
@donedadanada @dillondanis If Dillon had gotten the right lawyers as soon as he was suspended in October, he’d be set for life. 		Instead, he has to put up with people taunting him for being dependent on Conor’s largesse and slog through low-pay fights that will certainly give him even more brain damage.
This is good.		https://t.co/bLEF7en4E6
@dillondanis Your attorney negotiated that settlement with Nevada, and you signed it.		If you didn’t agree with it, why did you sign it?		It’s a damn shame you couldn’t afford to get your own lawyers to advocate for you, but instead had to rely on Conor’s. 		You were thrown under the bus.

@GerardAraud @PoliceNationale  		Perhaps your government should focus on taking good care of French citizens instead of coddling Kadyrov’s murderous henchmen and their vulgar offspring. 		France should represent French first, and not spend resources harboring Chechen terrorists.

@veronichka1 @OGSonnyBlanco @TheBadGamerYT @TheJivemaster @arielhelwani @RusHammerMMA #khabib #ufc #ufc229		He applied. 		Ukraine denied his application all times he tried. 		Word in Poltava is that Khabib was not happy — not happy with Russia, then not happy with Ukraine. 		Now whom is he not happy at? 😂
@MikhailSeven @arielhelwani @RusHammerMMA Dude, we don’t care if Conor through (sic) a whatever. 		We’re not MMA or UFC fans. 		We’re just here to call out #Khabib’s hypocrisy on behalf of our Muslim and Russian followers. 		Noblesse oblige of a large account. 		Now scoot.
@arielhelwani @RusHammerMMA 	#khabib #ufc #ufc229  		This is how Khabib’s fans celebrated his victory. 		Guess how the reporters literally or colloquially translated  “конор – петух!” into English depending on whose side they’re on. https://t.co/A064SmtAoj
RT @JillKwi: @HallyuWebsite That looks like tremors in the hands kind of issue.
@veronichka1 @OGSonnyBlanco @TheBadGamerYT @TheJivemaster @arielhelwani @RusHammerMMA #khabib #ufc #ufc229 		And in case you missed this tidbit as well... 		Khabib applied several times for Ukrainian citizenship. 🇺🇦 🇷🇺		https://t.co/JKF3wSRMey

@arielhelwani cc: @RusHammerMMA 		When a Conor fan calls Khabib a  “петух” in Russian, it gets translated into English as “p-ssy” or “f-g”		When team Khabib uses the same word, it gets translated into English as “chicken” instead of the literal rooster.		What could be more biased than that?
Hallyu fans... 		How much credence do you give to a troll account with no profile pic and fewer than 15 followers?
@veronichka1 @OGSonnyBlanco @TheBadGamerYT @TheJivemaster @arielhelwani @RusHammerMMA Hello???? 		They say “конор – петух!”		And surely, you know the word Khabib used for Timati on Instagram. 		Instagram had to take down Khabib’s post because the vulgar language “Violated Community Guidelines.”
@arielhelwani @RusHammerMMA Sorry to spam, Ariel, but we’ve been telling you guys this for months. 		Why did you MMA reporters never call Khabib out on the “chicken” thing? 		https://t.co/4a6xoiZ28P

@RTSportNews @TeamKhabib Still protesting your selective editing of the five-minute interview. 		You know very well most people will watch your edit instead of the full interview. 		@PutinRF’s disdain for what Khabib did deserves to be heard. 		RT staff = unprofessional scum
@RopeGang570 @TroyD92 @novacane08 @arielhelwani @dillondanis @TheNotoriousMMA Lol... 		Instagram had to take down Khabib’s post because of the vulgar language he used in a rant against a singer he was hinting to his Dagestani and Chechen followers was gay and should be attacked. 		Violated Community Guidelines. 		When’s that happened to Conor McGregor?
@shortall_eileen @MoeAbdulmalik @TeamKhabib @ufc Funny thing about that too... 		Before this incident, Muslims would have simply shrugged off being offered alcohol. 		All of a sudden, after the presser, it’s become some huge anti-Muslim offensive gesture. 		Ask any regular Muslim outside MMA interest, it’s no big deal.
@RopeGang570 @TroyD92 @novacane08 @arielhelwani @dillondanis @TheNotoriousMMA Double standards much? 		Khabib and his clan have referred to Conor as a drunken Irish chicken over the years.		They call him a drug addict and alcoholic without reservation.		They say Ireland is a nation of drunks.		Media gave him a pass because the UFC had a narrative to sell.

@xurshidi @novacane08 @arielhelwani @dillondanis @TheNotoriousMMA A ver...  		What does “конор – петух!” mean then? 		Lol
@arielhelwani Ariel, 		Hope you watched the full interview and not only the selective cut that RT posted. 		@PutinRF lectured #Khabib on sportsmanship. 		Notice the venue, Khabib’s posture, and his father’s embarrassment. 		Crazy the way Khabib-related things are always being spun.
@riplip11 @bokamotoESPN It’s part of Putin’s scolding of #Khabib for being disgraceful. 		The 2-minute video that RT has been circulating is very misleading in how it was edited. 		Five minutes... Putin saying that sports have unwritten moral rules... like don’t do what Kabib and his crew did.
@THE_MMA_PIG @jaredwilbert @bokamotoESPN Contrary to the media reports, Putin actually scolded him for violating sports’ moral code. 		Even his dad was embarrassed. 		Worse, Khabib had the temerity to talk back and justify what he did. 		The scorn on Putin’s face was priceless. 		“They’re as dumb as they say.”
@AbdelMaximus @bokamotoESPN What a liar you are, Abdel. 		Just look at the venue chosen for this. 		Putin severely reprimanded him for breaking the moral code of sports. His father was so embarrassed. 		Why do you think Khabib’s posture is like that? 		Crazy the revisionism around that religious hypocrite.
@TeamKhabib You are so dumb. You even had the chutzpah to talk back to him.		After all that, you're still nothing. Worse, you’re a disgrace. https://t.co/AdtQAVVrwA
@roqgalvao @CondorYT_Gaming @TeamKhabib How about the vulgar disrespect that #Khabib and his clan have directed toward Conor, the Irish and Ireland over the years? 		How about his religious hypocrisy? 		The media gave him a complete pass because of the narrative the UFC was selling to their stupid paying fans.
@PutinRF Thanks for attempting to scold him. 		But as you saw for yourself, his IQ level isn’t that high. 		He’s a disgrace.
@TroyD92 @novacane08 @arielhelwani @dillondanis @TheNotoriousMMA It’s also what #Khabib’s fans in the Caucasus always chant, like in this viral video. 		https://t.co/uyR4cUYuvU

It’s vulgar slang. 		He’s said other disgusting stuff that English-language media didn’t report because of the narrative UFC wants to hype the fans on

@TeamKhabib Part 2: #Conor being attacked inside the ring post-fight by #Khabib’s crew at #UFC229 		This happened AFTER the attack on Dillon Danis in the crowd. 		https://t.co/N2dQqd3gUu
@nicoleartukovic That’s the weird thing. 		They’re celebrating all over social media and in Dagestan like they did something great. No shame whatsoever. 		And without repercussion for doing the same thing at PFL 7 in August, they’ll do it again.
@KrunkVegeta @shafiq_amin96 @spaceman200000 @TeamKhabib Hope you’ll never be placed in a situation to realize what real racism is. 		The things you perceive as racist in your safe Western society, such as inappropriate word choice etc, pale in comparison to what actual racism is. 	 	And since we’re here...		#JusticeForZelim 🏳️‍🌈
@USEmbRu @USEmbRuPress		In case you overlooked it... 		these were the very same hooligans in that video from San Francisco about two months ago. 		An associate of theirs reportedly went all the way to Morocco last week to get a visa for the US approved. 		🤷🏻‍♀️
@KrunkVegeta @shafiq_amin96 @spaceman200000 @TeamKhabib Calling people out for their medieval attitudes towards gays and women is racist? 		Lol... You have no idea who you’re siding with. 		#JusticeForZelim 🏳️‍🌈 https://t.co/tGkcgp4xto
@TwizzleStick73 @spaceman200000 @TeamKhabib Surprise, buddy. 		We don’t really follow MMA. 		We never have and never will pay to watch an MMA event. 		We’re here to call out the hypocrisy of that religious fundamentalist Khabib.
@countryboy24577 @OneTonTestes @TeamKhabib #ufc229 #khabib #ufc  		Exactly... Does this look harmless? https://t.co/KmFnP79JAY
@spaceman200000 @TeamKhabib Clearly shows the difference between animals and civilized peoples.
@TotalDoomsayer @Chisanga_Malata Looking at it another time... The man in a dark suit that threw another (?) punch to the back of Dillon’s head... That was Rizvan. 		https://t.co/z0VbDjbcP8

@USEmbRu @USEmbRuPress 		So who approved the visas for these Dagestani and Chechen hooligans? 		This is what they did Saturday night at the T-Mobile arena in Vegas. 		https://t.co/IlQCi7hy0u
@arielhelwani #ufc299		That’s their interpreter / translator Rizvan @Rizvan_RM 		He also trains to fight like them and shoot guns like them. 		Islam Makhachev @MAKHACHEVMMA in pic with Khabib @TeamKhabib below. https://t.co/ONgWHfZIQB

@AdamCavo @arielhelwani His crew did the same thing at PFL 7 six weeks ago. 		Attacked the cornermen of Saidyokub immediately after the fight in which Omar Nurmagomedov defeated Said.
@FuckYouCombat @arielhelwani Dillon will likely be pursuing the case.
@arielhelwani Khabib #ufc229 		He went after @dillondanis 		https://t.co/IlQCi7hy0u
@DamonMartin Also, Khabib’s crew did the same thing at PFL 7 six weeks ago. 		Because they weren’t punished then, they thought that was the norm. 😏		That they’re allowed to physically attack the losing side’s corner men immediately after the fight. 		Culture 🤦🏻‍♀️
@gazmurf9 @sportbible Yep... 		https://t.co/IlQCi7hy0u
@espn @arielhelwani Ariel, 		@teamkhabib went after @dillondanis — looks like another clansman may have hit Dillon on the back of the head https://t.co/IlQCi7hy0u
@HoelessWolf @randlsa @vedaddel @Armando9012 @TapouT1369 @danhardymma And it’s not the first time Khabib’s crew did it. 		They did the same at PFL 7 six weeks ago — attack the losing side’s corner men immediately after the fight.
@danhardymma Khabib’s fight license will likely be revoked. 		His clan should’ve been reprimanded after doing the same thing at PFL 7.
@dillondanis 		Dillon,		Post an update to show you’re ok.
@kacie_kellfire @_The112 Sure... Khabib and his crew will face charges as well. https://t.co/v5IUemxVGf
@iIPadre That looks like @TeamKhabib’s translator / interpreter  @Rizvan_RM 		He loves guns.
@_The112 #ufc229		Will they suspend @TeamKhabib’s fight license?
@alexscaffidi_ @Ginger_Guy_ They did the same thing at PFL 7. 		After Umar won, Khabib’s crew physically attacked his opponent’s corner.
@arielhelwani Ariel, 		Khabib’s clan did the same thing after Umar’s win at PFL (?) on August 30.		They attacked the losing side’s cornerman.
@lthomasnews Khabib’s clan did the same thing a few months ago after Umar’s win at PFL (?)		They attacked the losing side’s team.

@Zman_El3jaib @TeamKhabib @Assimalhakeem You need to study Islam. 		MMA is haram because hitting the face is absolutely forbidden in all cases.		Remember what Khabib did to Al Iaquinta. He butchered the man’s face for no other reason but money. https://t.co/rH1ptnspMr

@DaMMACorner @MMAjunkie @joannamma @TheNotoriousMMA 🤦🏻‍♀️		Conor did everything right in his visit to Moscow, and even Khabib has been busy alienating himself from most Russians 		then that boorish woman somehow managed to sic Conor’s rabid fans on that reporter		has made it difficult for Russian fans of Конор
@DaMMACorner @MMAjunkie @joannamma @TheNotoriousMMA Suit yourself 🤷🏻‍♀️		Russia may look Western, but their culture — even the concept of face — is somewhere between Asian and American.		When you are a celebrity guest in a country, you don’t humiliate reporters		Russians saw how Conor respected their culture. Joanna was a boor

@DaMMACorner @MMAjunkie @joannamma @TheNotoriousMMA https://t.co/pTyvpLJ0s6
@DaMMACorner @MMAjunkie @joannamma @TheNotoriousMMA Are you that clueless?		Khabib speaks Russian almost as poorly as Kadyrov. 		And after recent scandals, especially the Timati one, even Dagestani youth unfollowed him and switched to Conor.		Conor had practically sealed Russian support, then this insulting shit had to happen.
@DaMMACorner @MMAjunkie @joannamma How shocked would you be to learn that the reporter is actually a huge fan of @TheNotoriousMMA ? 		Know of any ethnic Russian sports reporters who aren’t big fans of Putin and Conor? Because we sure don’t. 		After being lynched by her and his supporters though... really bad taste
@J_Noble07 @DMatherne21 @shaqs777 @MMAjunkie @TheNotoriousMMA Quoting @FilipinoFood, the reporter didn’t understand even after she repeatedly said “nsultkoner” and he didn’t have it in him to ask her to speak more clearly.		We think she picked up on it, being a non-native speaker herself, but she wanted to make fun of him.
@J_Noble07 @DMatherne21 @shaqs777 @MMAjunkie @TheNotoriousMMA What’s funny though..		We don’t get why everyone is assuming the reporter is anti-Conor.		If you had asked us to guess before this blew up, we would’ve guessed he’s a Conor fan.		The Russians we know, including sports reporters and our followers, are huge fans of Conor and Putin.
@J_Noble07 @DMatherne21 @shaqs777 @MMAjunkie Uhm... not following what’s been happening in Russia these recent weeks? 		After all the scandals, the Timati one was the last straw. 		Many Russians now want @TheNotoriousMMA to win. 		But even before the hullabaloos, many were already supporting Conor over Khabib.		Guess why.
Seoul weather right now https://t.co/H4AdPtCv7L
@ConorSteele1 @MMAjunkie @joannamma She and you assumed what his motive was?		He is a member of the press. In a foreign country.		Ask @TheNotoriousMMA what that means. 		Hope he doesn’t go out of his way to prove us wrong, but we bet Conor has more empathy for the media and for the non-English reporters especially.
@Bobbzzyy @filipinofood @KnowThisFood @MMAjunkie @joannamma @RTSportNews @DenisGeykoRT @TheNotoriousMMA @RusHammerMMA @kosti1gnusariov @dillondanis @pascuion1 That’s not how we read it.		How many Russian acquaintances and reporters do either one of you know that you or she can correctly assume what their intent was, aside from plainly asking a question?
@Bobbzzyy @filipinofood @KnowThisFood @MMAjunkie @joannamma @RTSportNews @DenisGeykoRT @TheNotoriousMMA @RusHammerMMA @kosti1gnusariov @dillondanis @pascuion1 Good for you that it made PERFECT sense, because it sure as hell didn’t make sense to many others why she was being purposely rude.
Poll, you all answer truthfully		Have you had anyone make fun of your English?
@Bobbzzyy @filipinofood @KnowThisFood @MMAjunkie @joannamma @RTSportNews @DenisGeykoRT @TheNotoriousMMA @RusHammerMMA @kosti1gnusariov @dillondanis @pascuion1 What’s your native language?
@John_Kavanagh 👩🏻‍💻👩🏻‍🏫		Let her try that same shit on a Korean reporter, we’ll sic the Kpop and Kdrama fans on her. 		You’ve been warned @joannamma 		It is extremely rude to behave that way towards reporters whose first language isn’t English or yours. 		You have no sense of decency.
@MMAjunkie @joannamma She was so rude. 🙎🏻‍♀️		He obviously did not grasp the connotation of that word she used, yet pressed on. 		Horrified to think of how she would’ve treated an equally earnest Korean or Japanese reporter. 		Poland MMA rep keeps sinking. Hope karma catches up soon.

@HulsTK63SqdV8vu @TeamKhabib @ufc @PutinRF No, because they are not religious hypocrites like Khabib and his clansmen.

@subjecttochance @sallywilts @lumidek Talk to anyone outside the UK / US sphere of influence.		Those two countries have no credibility.		Neither China nor Russia has droned civilians. 😇		If it weren’t for the US / UK residual legacy of a powerful hold over countries’ economies etc, no one would take them seriously.
@subjecttochance @sallywilts @lumidek Made-up estimate for world figures, though opinion polls and Putin bio sales are among reliable indicators in China. 		Those expelling countries follow the UK / US lead in any event. 		After the Iraq War and Tony Blair, normal people just roll their eyes at whatever the UK says.
@subjecttochance @sallywilts @lumidek Would estimate that 90% of the people outside the UK are leaning towards Russia’s denials and are very doubtful of the UK / USA accusations. 		Putin is considered a great leader in China and in Africa.
@sallywilts @subjecttochance @lumidek Oh? Didn’t know of promotional items like that. 		Must google images. 😛

@subjecttochance @lumidek To portray the Russians as evil just as they were experiencing the positive PR glow for hosting the World Cup? 		Russians can devise better ways of surreptitiously bringing in novichok... Isn’t it riskier to have it in a perfume bottle? And to so dispose said bottle is weird.
@subjecttochance @lumidek If the conspiracy theory is true, then the British or the Americans must’ve placed those there. 😅		How were the two able to have that bottle with them and spray the novichok on the doorknob?		Why throw the bottle into the trash? 		Questions to be answered... 💁🏻‍♀️
@lumidek Didn’t mean they were Asian... just that “foreigners” in general even from St. Pete have a different perception of what’s noteworthy to visit.		If a certain Korean show mentions some obscure historical tidbit about Poznań, by next year Seoulites will have it on itinerary. ))
@lumidek 😁		Knowing how Asian tourists get fixated en masse on certain “weird” out-of-the way areas like Tblisi or some obscure town in the middle of nowhere, their Salisbury story is plausible. They don’t seem GRU either. Plus, the evidence against them is so far only circumstantial.
