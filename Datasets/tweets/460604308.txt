@h8Wankmaggot45 I might risk it until I get my lists fixed and those I need to follow followed.  I've been at it all day and I still have like 450 folks to go through that aren't following me back and then I have to do those that I missed, either by accident or because I'm not sure about them
@h8Wankmaggot45 Hmm, I'm using Unfollowspy but I copy and past the address of the person into twitter.  Then I can see everything before I follow or unfollow or add them to a list.  If we avoid using the app to unfollow or follow, are we safe?  I guess I'll find out LOL

We handle it differently and butt heads a lot.  My son does his best to put up with both of us.  It's hard not being the mom I want to be, I fall short all the time which, of course, adds to it all.

Then I lost my mom 2009, my grandma 2010, my husband 2011 and grandfather 2012.  That was everyone but my kids.  I couldn't save my husband who had a heart attack.   I totally lost it.1/2

I have had it (and before PTSD depression and anxiety) for a really long time so I have a bag of tricks and know when to employ some serious self care.  But the guilt?  It NEVER goes away.

@lanewsa Absolutely!  We can do this!  WE actually remember history and can look at the facts.  The resistance is strong!  And most of us do our due diligence.
Foreign bad actors &amp; GOP will try to divide us again.  Indep candidates will try to split the vote.  We know this now and we're not stupid.  Let the dems fight it out in the primary and then we come together for the winner in the general.    https://t.co/W0c6IR9EdN
@dougarrell Exactly!

i won't be voting for Bernie but I am more than fine with him running.  It's up to us, though, the resisters, to stick together in the General and any candidate who does not support the winner of the primary can FO.  We cannot let anyone divide us.  We can't fail to vote blue.
@Bevin802 Exactly!  We can vote for whomever we want in the primary and then come together to put the winner into the WH in the general.  We cannot do otherwise.  The numbers are on our side if we 1. Vote and 2. Vote blue
@DiscePatiDuncan I'd rather see Bernie on the Dem ticket than as an independent who could take votes in the general.  Anyone who doesn't like him on the ticket will simply not vote for him.  But an independent spoiler who has a following could get Trump in office for four more hideous years.
We cannot allow what happened in 2016.  The GOP/Foreign propaganda made the Never Hillary folks either not vote, vote for an Indep, or vote for Trump.  They played us.  If we simply all vote blue, we will win.  We're smarter than this and we learn from history!
@RaeLyn1994 @Dax_x98 You're both still on my candle.  Hugs! https://t.co/1fDlmTwGNw
Does it honestly matter who runs in the democratic primary?  We all vote for our pick. As long as we all vote for the winner in the general and the candidates who lose support that winner as well, then our vote can't be split by the GOP OR Russia.  We can do this!

@HalmMary @Cindela_Oculary It is what it is.  We all have our struggles  :-)
@Cindela_Oculary Same here, going in for surgery in five months.  Hopefully some will be resolved then.  I'm there with you, though.
@cynajane My adult daughter has PTSD and she has MANY fewer coping mechanisms than I do.  I, too, wish my magic wand wasn't broken.  It hurts so much watching her hurt and be powerless.  Life does, indeed, suck sometimes.  I'd take her PTSD and add it to mine if it would make her well.
@Cindela_Oculary @HalmMary California  :-)
@Cindela_Oculary Truly.  I usually give up and get up and write.  Might as well be productive!
@Cindela_Oculary @HalmMary I know, RIGHT? Love that it's totally legal now!

@Kimmbberr @ChasingOz_ @mayadylan Music is my usual trigger.  And, boy, when it happens in the car, I can't pull over fast enough.
@ChasingOz_ @mayadylan Then, unfortunately, it was time for one.  Crying actually removes toxins from your body.  Let it go so you can let it go.  Ugly cry, no one is watching.  You'll feel better soon and I"m here for you.
@mayadylan @ChasingOz_ Most folks don't get it.  But ti's real and it's not just the depression, anxiety, panic, and nightmares.  ti's the lack of concentration, the inability to remember jack, and the overwhelming whatever it is this time that kicks your ass.  It's pure hell and can be debilitating
@hfpnygiants @ChasingOz_ aw, thanks!  back atcha!
@mayadylan @ChasingOz_ Support is always around, truly.  Just look at us this morning!
@mayadylan @ChasingOz_ I used to be a hospice RN and then lost four family members (mom, grandmother, husband, and grandpa) in four years.  That gave me PTSD to go with my depression and anxiety.  It's brutal and was made worse by an abusive relationship.
@Kimmbberr @ChasingOz_ Exactly!
@ChasingOz_ Breathe.  Find something, ANYTHING, that usually makes you happy.  Even if it doesn't, it wont 'make it worse.  Breathe again, give yourself self care and, if all else fails, crawl back into bed and cry.  Just remember, this WILL pass.  This is NOT how it wills stay.  Real hugs.

And now is the time to get to it.  #Resist #TakeBackOurCountry #TogetherWeAreStrong #UseYourPrivilegeForGood #KeepFighting #TakeAKnee #BLM #MeToo @AOC Sorry not sorry for the rant 11/11
I may be tired of fighting, cuz there always is something to fight for and against.  But I refuse to think America is done for, that our democratic experiment has failed.  We WILL rise.  We need to own and repair our past and move forward united.  We can do this 10/11
We can WIN this fight.,  We can fumigate the roaches back into oblivion.  We can save our planet, get healthcare for all, get free education for all, and end systematic racism and the war on the LGBT community.  We CAN do this all and we WILL.  But only if we stand together 9/11
So, where do we stand?  We can see the enemy now.  Young people, women, people of color and white folks who have had enough and see the truth are fighting back, and it's about time. 8/11
And it worked.  We can be ashamed to be white and be quiet OR we can embrace our privilege and use its power to fight for what is right.  We can speak up, we can vote, we can show the opposition a better way.  in fact, that's our duty.  Call out the evil and empower others 7/11
their ugly hateful faces.  These scared men and women so afraid of losing their privilege and status.  This construct created by rich white folks to convince poor white folks that there was someone below them in status and that they should be proud of their whiteness 6/11
The fight for women's rights, civil rights, and LGBT rights continues and I'm tired.  But the future must be insured for generations to come.  In one way I'm grateful to Trump ... the cockroaches who lived among us are coming out of the muck and have been emboldened to show 5/11
knew how it was passed, they were often shunned by many they called friends.  We bi women (raises hand) and lesbians often provided care.  I did laundry, cooked, cleaned, wiped asses &amp; snuck notes past hateful family members to a dying man the hospital fr his partner 4/11
I knew that racism existed and that my friends were hurt by it.  In the 80s, I graduated from HS and started college and I hung out in West Hollywood.  Tons of my friends were gay men.  And then AIDS started killing them.  Since it was a "gay disease" and no one 3/11
We fought for civil rights and, growing up in a suburb of Los Angeles, we had forced integration (PITA for the kids bused across town, but great for us all)  I had friends of all colors, beliefs, and thrived in the diversity.  BUT, I saw the news and I heard the talk  2/11
About me, cuz it's time.  And I'm tired but still fighting.  I'm 53yo, a grandmother, mother, wordsmith and proud activist.  I've been an activist since I was 6yo when I served lemonade and tea to my mother's friends in the Young Democrats ... 1/11
