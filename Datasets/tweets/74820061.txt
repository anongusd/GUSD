Of the 13 House Rs who voted against national emergency declaration, most (7) come from districts where Trump won 53% or less. 		But 78% of all House Rs come from districts where Trump took 54%+. Crossing POTUS in those seats = potentially career-ending.
Trump's approval among Rs in current Gallup: 89%. As long as that's true, there's no such thing as "too far" for cong Rs, even on actions thought unthinkable not long ago/now. 		Crossing him = possible primary doom. Hard to overstate how much this dynamic drives R cong behavior.

An under-appreciated bloc of 2020 Dem primary voters: moderate suburban Republicans who are functionally now Democrats in the era of Trump.
P.S. The vast majority of U.S. voters don’t give a crap what goes on in Senate office buildings...and aren’t planning to apply for a job with Amy Klobuchar anytime soon.
4) In a zillion-way prez primary field, there’s only one thing worse than bad press: not being talked about.
Possible ways comb-gate etc. could *boost* Klobuchar:		1) She owns it: i.e. "Want a tough as nails boss, or dude in executive time?"	2) Critical mass of D primary voters views narrative as sexist	3) Derision from NYT/Hill types reinforces Heartland appeal		https://t.co/msvBnnHHhD

Another obvious place where Republicans would be well-served by drawing a new Dem "vote sink" district in 2021: Austin, TX.
One more thought on #GA07: if Dems win both #GA06 &amp; #GA07 in 2020, it's easy to imagine GA Republicans merging them into one super-Dem "vote sink" district in the northern ATL burbs &amp; creating a safe new seat for themselves in 2021.
Btw, along these lines, the @FiveThirtyEight pod folks may have given the award for "best politicking of 2018" to Manchin, but my vote for most impressive '18 performance would have gone to...Jon Tester.

In fact, so far it's not a case of "voter fraud" at all. It's a case of voters being defrauded.
This is not a case of "Republican voter fraud." 		This IS a case of a shady operative w/ a checkered past, who has peddled his "services" to D &amp; R candidates in the past, engaging in *absentee ballot fraud* on behalf of a GOP candidate. 		Qs now: how extensive &amp; who knew? #NC09
The key unresolved #NC09 question in my opinion is: what accounts for the enormous &amp; anomalous share of unreturned absentee ballots in Robeson Co.?
@bobvanmeter3 @DKElections The CA SoS site is behind. Riverside only has 11k left to count now.
It’s likely fewer than 37% of Stacey Abrams voters bothered to vote in yesterday’s GA Secretary of State runoff. Had even 40% showed up, Dems would’ve probably won the office.

Projection: Brad Raffensperger (R) has defeated John Barrow (D) for GA Secretary of State.
Things you wouldn't guess from Twitter: turns out more Kemp voters than Abrams voters care who GA's next Secretary of State will be. #GASOS
These kinds of statistically dubious vote swings &amp; aberrations don't occur naturally in the realm of sub-county election results, except for instances of bloc voting by certain religious sects, etc. That's clearly not what was going on here.
It's also amazing no one scrutinized the results closely enough the last two razor-thin primaries to cry foul &amp; fully bring to light what was going on (I'm kicking myself, but I wasn't a losing NC campaign). 		If there were a "dumb election criminals" show...Dowless would star.
The '16 GOP primary, '18 GOP primary &amp; '18 general elections in #NC09 were all decided by fewer than 1,000 votes. In all three cases, Dowless's absentee ballot scheme was hidden in plain sight - in the election results. Amazing anyone thought they could get away with it forever. https://t.co/d9vKZDugCq

23 Republicans won House races by less than 5% (that's actually more than the 21 Dems won by less than 5%). Had the Trump base been less energized - as in a lot of the specials - many of them would've lost.
There's strong evidence massive 11/6 turnout aided Rs. For example, #OH12 Rep. Troy Balderson (R) got 68k more votes than he did in 8/7 special, Danny O'Connor (D) just 56k more.		This thing could've easily gone +50 for Dems had the Trump base not woken up at the 11th hour.
The winning party's margin in votes the past 4 times the House has flipped:		1994: Republicans +6.8%	2006: Democrats + 8.0%	2010: Republicans +6.6%	2018: Democrats +8.4% and counting		https://t.co/0pm7oW1pFE
The House Dem "leadership table" is getting so crowded to satisfy various groups/tastes that it's looking more like a Dem leadership buffet restaurant.
There are potentially huge redistricting payoffs for many members of the new Dem freshman class *if* they can win reelection in 2020.
Have a feeling that the next time Dems win the White House they'll be doing so without carrying Vigo Co., IN (Terre Haute), which has voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1956.

@NateSilver538 We've got 450k in CA, perhaps another 200-300k in NY, and maybe 200-300k more in random other states like IL/KS/MS/MO/NE/OH/PA. If those ballots break 2/3 for Dems, we'll end up right around 8.7%.
What's even scarier for CA Republicans than being reduced to just 7/53 House seats in January? Four of the remaining seven Rs survived by single digits.
To be clear, #CA22 is still a safe call for Nunes, but like all the others, it's pretty remarkable how much the gap has closed since Election Night.

The only question now is the final margin. This looks like a mid-to-high single digit Hyde-Smith (R) win at the moment. #MSSEN

It would be something of a mindf*** for both parties if Dems were to blow #FLSEN by 10k votes, then pick up #MSSEN in a runoff. Still unlikely.
The ultimate bellwether tonight might be Madison Co., wealthier Jackson burbs + heavily AA city of Canton. Only 17% reporting there so far. #MSSEN
DeSoto Co. is now 92% reporting &amp; Hyde-Smith (R) is up to 57.9% there, which is a hair above her statewide win target. Likeliest outcome for now is still a narrow Hyde-Smith win. #MSSEN
Hinds Co. starting to pour in for Espy (D). He's at 90.1% there w/ 18% in. Doesn't mean much b/c it's part of the county &amp; to be expected. #MSSEN
Espy (D) at 43.2% in DeSoto Co. w/ 85% of precincts in. That's a really impressive showing for a Dem there, regardless of whether he wins/loses statewide. Still need to see whole county though. #MSSEN
I'd still rather be Hyde-Smith (R) than Espy (D) based on the balance of very early results, but this is clearly not shaping up to be a blowout. #MSSEN
Almost all of Warren Co. (Vicksburg) reporting &amp; Espy (D) down to 52.9% there. He probably needs to be in the ~57% range there to win statewide. #MSSEN
Pretty remarkable for Espy (D) that this race is in single digits w/ very little of Jackson or the Delta reporting so far. #MSSEN
Two thirds of DeSoto Co. is now reporting and Hyde-Smith (R) up to 55.6% there. She's not far off her win number there (~57%) now. #MSSEN
This certainly does not look like a Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) blowout so far. #MSSEN
About 68% of Warren Co. (Vicksburg) is reporting and Espy (D) at 55.3% there. Probably eventually needs to be at ~57% there to win statewide. #MSSEN
Now w/ 56% of DeSoto Co. reporting, Hyde-Smith (R) lead there up to 8.6%. Eventually needs to be up ~15% there. Her numbers still weak but headed in right direction. #MSSEN
Nearly half of DeSoto Co. is in and Hyde-Smith (R) is still only leading by 5.8% there. A weak showing so far there. Plot is thickening in the Memphis burbs... #MSSEN
We have partial results from four counties &amp; Espy (D) is exceeding his statewide breakeven numbers in all four. But b/c MS is so racially polarized, it's extremely hazardous to infer who's ahead based on partial counties. #MSSEN
A quarter of DeSoto's precincts now reporting, Hyde-Smith (R) up by 6% there. She eventually needs to be up by ~15% there. Still too early to read too much into it. #MSSEN
First six precincts from DeSoto Co. (Memphis burbs) &amp; Hyde-Smith (R) leads there by 1%. Intriguing for Espy (D), but it's a tiny sample of precincts. #MSSEN

Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R)'s #WA05 just became the 2nd district (other is #MTAL) where 2018 House votes have surpassed 2016 prez votes, at 100.1%.
Preliminary '18 House votes cast vs. '16 prez levels by district type*:		Entirely vote-by-mail: 93%	R-to-D flips: 87%	&gt;40% college grads: 87%	Trump-won: 85%	All districts: 84%	Clinton-won: 83%	African-American majority: 83%	Latino majority: 80%		*Excludes unopposed races
Preliminary highest turnout CDs (based on House votes/adult citizens):		1. #MN03 - 73%	2. #CO02 - 73%	3. #VA10 - 71%	4. #WA07 - 71%	5. #CO04 - 69%	6. #MN05 - 69%	7. #MN02 - 69%	8. #FL04 - 68%	9. #WA01 - 68%	10. #MI11 - 68%	11. #GA06 - 68%	12. #CO06 - 67%
It's far from final. Will go higher. https://t.co/gukY1YywYh
Also in January, House Dems will represent:		78% of Whole Foods locations (up from 65% today)	27% of Cracker Barrel locations (up from 21% today)		By far, the widest culture gap ever. (h/t @GrantrGregory) https://t.co/X9L2lXD1Ek
To be clear, @CookPolitical's final outlook was a Dem gain of 30-40 seats &amp; it'll end up at the very top of that range. But late on Election Night, it looked like Dems were poised for 35-37. Then virtually every uncalled race went Dems' way. https://t.co/HmuEbr9vhr
@KFILE This story appears to be incorrect. Democrats won about 13 million more votes than Republicans in 2008, far above their 9.1 million margin in 2018. https://t.co/NuzZqpspjg
Another way of looking at it: in January, House Dems will represent:		79% of all Asians	72% of all Latinos	66% of all African-Americans	66% of all Clinton voters	60% of all college grads	54% of all House seats	45% of all whites	39% of all Trump voters	20% of America's land area
These stats are contingent on Dems picking up #CA21, btw. Also, if it weren't for narrow Dem wins in #ME02 &amp; #NM02, Rs would be ceding just *1.7%* of their land area despite losing 16% of their seats.
The share of Asian voters turned out to be a pretty good indicator of Dem House pickups. Of the 50 GOP-held seats w/ the highest Asian populations, Dems flipped 27 - which accounts for two thirds of Dems' net gain in the House.
House Republicans will represent 17% fewer seats in January. But they'll also represent:		37% fewer Asian constituents	28% fewer Latino constituents	22% fewer college grads	22% fewer Clinton voters	13% fewer Trump voters		Bonus fact: they'll give up just *5%* of their land area.
If Rep. David Valadao (R) loses in #CA21, as is likely, House Rs will have lost 6/10 of their districts w/ the highest Latino populations. They've already lost 17/25 of their districts w/ the highest Asian populations.
Per the House clerk, in 2008 Dems won about 13 million more votes than GOP. Their current 9 million margin, however, is the largest in a midterm. https://t.co/cdgrSyOmpr

If you'd told me before the election that Rs would win an average of 83% of Trump's '16 votes in contested House races, I would've told you they were probably on track to keep their majority.		But Dems are averaging 93% of Clinton's totals &amp; are on track for a 40-seat rout.
@CaseyMPrichard @actuarialopinio Tbh, if Rs drew a new safe Dem district in Austin to make surrounding R districts safer, that's a trade a lot of Austin Dems would take.

There are 233 congressional districts w/ a Whole Foods Market (h/t @GrantrGregory), nearly the same number Dems will control in 2019.		Dems will control 67% of those 233 districts come January, up from 55% today.
@ShawnFetta @Jayhawk81 No, +42 -3 = 39
Fact: of the 42 House seats Dems have flipped from GOP control so far, exactly two thirds - 67% - contain a Whole Foods Market. None of the three seats Rs flipped from Dem control have one.
@JustCameron__ Actually #UT04 is the *only* Utah district without a Whole Foods, but it's surrounded on all sides by them and may have the largest share of shoppers.
Dems' national lead in raw House votes - now 8.8 million - just broke the record for largest for either party in the history of midterm elections (previous record was 8.7 million set by Dems in 1974). https://t.co/0pm7oW1pFE
Love’s defeat also ensures that Rs will lose 43% of their women in the House, from 23 to just 13. 90% of House Rs will be white men.
Rep. Mia Love (R)’s defeat to Ben McAdams (D) in #UT04 gets Dems to +39, w/ the possibility of +40 in #CA21 (I still think Rs will hold #GA07 &amp; #NY27).		The past two weeks have almost gone worse for House Republicans than Election Night itself.
The more votes are counted, the more stunning the beatdowns for Rs in Whole Foods burbs:		#IL06: Rep. Peter Roskam (R) now down 22k votes (-7%)	#KS03: Rep. Kevin Yoder (R) now down 30k votes (-10%)	#NJ11: Mikie Sherrill (D) now up 47k votes (+15%)		These Rs never had a chance.
Dems' fundraising dominance in 2018 wasn't just the result of anger at an unpopular GOP president in a midterm; it was as much the result of wealthy voters' relatively recent abandonment of GOP/migration to Dems.		This isn't a problem that's going away for GOP anytime soon.
Without much fanfare, #NE02 Rep. Don Bacon (R)'s lead has narrowed to under 5k votes (2.0%) &amp; #KS02 Rep.-elect Steve Watkins (R)'s lead has narrowed to under 2k votes (0.7%). Tantalizingly close but no cigar for Dems. https://t.co/0pm7oW1pFE

This is a really ominous batch for #CA21 Rep. David Valadao (R). There are still plenty of votes left in Kern &amp; Fresno for T.J. Cox (D) to make up the gap &amp; get House Dems to a 40 (!) seat gain. https://t.co/LLBGpnXdtV
So there were fewer Salt Lake Co. provisionals counted than some originally predicted - around 8,100. But McAdams (D) won them 5,176 to 2,921 - a much better-than-expected margin for him. Now, it's extremely hard to see how Rep. Mia Love (R) overcomes that deficit. #UT04
@FlipBlue2020 @RobertGehrke We put ourselves &amp; our predictions out there and try to interpret the data the best we can. Occasionally the result surprises us &amp; that’s what keeps our job interesting.
The last time Mitt Romney was on the ballot in 2012, Mia Love (R) lost #UT04 by 768 votes. This time, she’s trailing by 739. Wow.
Breaking: Ben McAdams (D) takes the lead over Rep. Mia Love (R) by 739 votes in #UT04 (and my apologies to @RobertGehrke!). https://t.co/EfA7XHLMgv
Right now, the Utah Co. portion of #UT04 is at 90.2% of its 2016 ballots cast and the Salt Lake Co. portion is at 95.9%, so I'd be surprised if there are 9k SLC/#UT04 ballots left to count as @RobertGehrke estimates. We'll see soon enough.
Important point: the 16 signatories aren't enough to cost Pelosi the speaker's gavel by themselves, since McAdams (D) would be Dems' 234th seat. https://t.co/oiloHPq3fi
My only hesitation here is that there’s no guarantee #UT04 houses a proportional share of Salt Lake Co.’s remaining ballots. In fact, most of the urban/Dem-leaning/pro-marijuana areas of Salt Lake Co. are in other CDs. Still think McAdams (D) needs a little luck here. https://t.co/P1pEcGDtVB

Last year, in a surprise to many CA observers, all seven House Rs from Clinton-won districts voted for the GOP’s healthcare bill. Depending on #CA21, it’s possible all seven seats could be totally wiped out.
In 2016, Clinton carried 46 of CA’s 53 districts &amp; Trump carried 7. There’s still a chance Dems could wipe out all 7 Rs in Clinton districts without picking up a single Trump seat.
Trivia: if it weren't for narrow Dem victories in #ME02 &amp; #NM02, Dems would've won just 1% more of America's land area despite increasing their share of all 435 House seats by 8% as a result of the 2018 midterms.

@AriBerman @BrennanCenter Of course. But Dems also won far more seats than their share of votes in states like CA, CT, IL, IA, MD, MA, NJ, NM, NY, OR &amp; WA. In the end, Dems won ~54% of votes and - very likely - 54% of seats.
In March, the @BrennanCenter put out a wildly wrong, outrage-provoking projection that an 8% Dem vote margin would produce only a 15 seat gain, leaving them well short of a majority. 		Actual result: Dems are on track to win ~8% more votes than House Rs &amp; pick up ~38-39 seats. https://t.co/zhLl6qiMev
Biggest surprise to me so far: how much House Dems were able to overcome their geographic disadvantage w/ $$, R open seats, PA remap, etc.		In 2012/14/16, Dems won a 4-5% smaller share of seats than major party votes. In 2018, they're on track for 54% of votes *and* seats.

If you're right that there are 10k missing Utah votes (not 5k as the @sltrib article states), that would not only make much more sense, it would also make Rep. Mia Love (R) the favorite to take the lead in #UT04. https://t.co/U1bw7MHLpM
@baseballot @NateSilver538 @RobertGehrke Not really. @RobertGehrke's article estimates there are 34k ballots left in Salt Lake &amp; 5k ballots left in Utah. But you just said there are probably 10k ballots left in Utah, which would make more sense...and it would also put Love in great position.
Either way, based on the current differential in counted votes between Salt Lake Co. &amp; Utah Co., I'd characterize #UT04 as closer to a Toss Up than "Lean McAdams."
Why not? The Utah Co. part of #UT04 isn't *that* demographically dissimilar from parts of southern Salt Lake Co., and it's also the fastest-growing part of the CD.		It's *possible* a higher share of what's out in Utah Co. is in #UT04 or a lower share of SLC's remaining votes are.
Fwiw, I have a hard time buying the @sltrib's estimate that there are 34k #UT04 ballots left in Salt Lake Co. &amp; just 5k in Utah Co. That would put Salt Lake Co. turnout at around ~99% of 2016 turnout &amp; Utah Co. turnout at just ~84%. Doesn't make sense. https://t.co/WYe5xkbLMv

#UT04 update: Salt Lake County gives Ben McAdams (D) 5,059 new votes, Rep. Mia Love (R) 4,722. McAdams's overall lead stands at 1,357, but the latest batches have skewed slightly more R than the initial, making this a nail biter.
The more I find out about the types of ballots still outstanding in CA (esp. provisionals), the more I'm convinced it would take a miracle for Republicans to hold onto #CA45 (Walters) &amp; #CA39 (Kim).
Thanks Paul! https://t.co/d2RRyzErt9

So far, the median Dem House nominee is receiving 91.3% of Clinton's 2016 votes &amp; the median R nominee is receiving only 80.4% of Trump's votes (only counting the 394 races contested by both parties).		These figures will change slightly as more votes are tallied.

In the final month, several concerned Dem (and delusional GOP) consultants peddled garbage rumor that #VA10 was "more like a 50/50" race. 		Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) ended up losing by 12.4%, tied for the worst showing for a GOP incumbent. The race had been over for a long time.
@NateSilver538 Kern listed 68k ballots out on 11/9 and just reported around 52k more votes today...only about 1/4 of Kern voters are in #CA21 so there may only be ~4k #CA21 ballots left in Kern. That wouldn't really be enough for Cox.
@NateSilver538 But what about Kings? That's Valadao's home base (Hanford) and as of 11/9 there were still 9k ballots remaining there. Meanwhile, looks like Kern reported about 3/4 of their 68k remaining ballots today. If 9k in Kings are still out, Valadao's fairly safe imho.
You can see the "green shoots" of a future TX Dem statewide breakthrough in counties like Tarrant, Collin, Denton, Williamson, Hays, Brazos, Lubbock...all counties where Beto outperformed Clinton by 5%+. https://t.co/zUPu2kE4nl
The reason this is so fascinating: we don't usually get to answer "What would've happened had the old lines remained in place?" But in PA, we had two races taking place *simultaneously* under two maps. Old lines: Dems won #PA07, lost #PA15. New lines, Dems won both.
Interesting: former Olympic gold medal cyclist Marty "The Blade" Nothstein (R) leads Susan Wild (D) by *58 votes* for #PA15 Rep. Charlie Dent (R)'s unexpired term (Wild easily beat Nothstein in the redrawn #PA07 for the full term).
Dems' national lead in House votes just surpassed 7 million (now 6.6%): https://t.co/0pm7oVJOh4
Btw: this is confusing to many people b/c Fresno is generally a Dem county and Kern is generally a heavily R county. But #CA21 is a bit backwards: it includes the more R parts of Fresno &amp; all the heaviest Dem parts of Kern. Valadao's still got this, in my opinion.
Delaware isn't messing around when it calls itself the "First State:" it's already certified its election results, making slackers out of the other 49. https://t.co/zrO1WwhdNe
I'd caution that this Kern update isn't unexpected and #CA21 Rep. David Valadao (R)'s lead is likely to bounce back up when additional ballots are counted in the two big R counties: Fresno &amp; Kings. https://t.co/hRXfLIZFEK
I’ve been wrestling w/ the question of whether Beto would be a senator had Hispanic voters made up same proportion of electorate as ‘16 &amp; given him Clinton margins. Certainly true for Nelson in FL. What say you @Nate_Cohn? https://t.co/iVdX3dHGt8
Having a hard time wrapping my head around this one: Chickasaw County, IA voted 55%-44% to reelect President Obama in 2012. Six years later, it voted 51%-45% to reelect #IA04 Rep. Steve King (R).
The difference-makers that got Dems from +30 to nearly +40 House seats were the districts that voted for Trump between 0-5%, mostly middle-class burbs like #IL14, #IA03 &amp; #VA02. 		Dems held 8/20 such seats heading into 2018. They'll likely emerge w/ 18/20. (h/t @PatrickRuffini)

Projection: Rep. Kyrsten Sinema (D) has defeated Rep. Martha McSally (R) in #AZSEN. This thing has been over for a while.
Dems have a lot to be thrilled about in the House, but they can’t be thrilled by #MN07 Rep. Collin Peterson (D) &amp; #NJ02 Jeff Van Drew (D)’s paltry margins over horrendously bad opponents. They’ll be prime GOP targets in 2020 (if Peterson even runs).
To illustrate what I mean: Republicans are on track to hold 191/199 (96%) of the districts Trump carried by 7% or more in 2016. Democrats are on track to hold 226/236 (96%) of the others. #BigSort https://t.co/cgQbUcxykl

@TylerDinucci @CoreyinNYC Hadn't seen...guess we think alike.
Staggering: if every uncalled race breaks as I expect, House Dems' class of 61 freshmen would include *35* women &amp; just 19 white men. By contrast, Republicans' class of 31 would include 29 white men &amp; just *one* woman.
Overlooked: at the moment, Republicans are on track to lose nearly half of their 23 women in the House; there could be just 13 in the next Congress.
The story developing as the full picture of Tuesday's results comes into focus is significantly more favorable to Dems than the narrative that emerged on Election Night.
On Tuesday, w/ a few exceptions, America didn't hold elections between two candidates so much as a census of how many Ds &amp; Rs live in given areas.

In #CA50, Ammar Campa-Najjar (D) is gradually narrowing Rep. Duncan Hunter (R)'s % margin. But he's not really narrowing the vote margin, currently 12,340.		Are you a normal R in a Clinton CD? You've most likely lost. An indicted R in a Trump CD? Congrats on your reelection.
Two years after Trump became the first R to lose Orange County since 1936, House Dems are on track for a *total shutout* of the GOP in the OC.

The irony: Dem arch-nemeses #CA22 Rep. Devin Nunes (R) &amp; #CA50 Rep. Duncan Hunter (R) will easily survive, while many of the Trump-skeptic House Rs likeliest to collaborate w/ Dems just got kicked out.
Btw, if all of these races go Dems' way, CA would go from 39D-14R to 45D-8R, a delegation so lopsided it could capsize into the Pacific.
So, let's get this straight: Rohrabacher &amp; Knight are done in #CA48 &amp; #CA25. Dems already picked up open #CA49. Denham now well behind in #CA10. Walters &amp; Kim hanging on for dear life in #CA45 &amp; #CA39.		This could easily turn into a six seat bloodbath for CA Republicans.

This is also...not good news for the Dems running for re-election in 28+ Dem/Trump districts in 2020 (esp. the Dems who promised new leadership and now can’t deliver).
Best of both worlds for Pelosi: Dems cleared 218 by 12+ seats, but relatively few of the Dems who pledged they wouldn’t support her won.		(They didn’t lose b/c they opposed her, but b/c they were mostly running in really red districts).

Bottom line: right now I have a really hard time seeing how McSally comes out ahead at the end of this. #AZSEN
Here's the evidence ("Raw votes vs. 2016" column): https://t.co/0pm7oW1pFE
So far, House votes tallied in Kyrsten Sinema (D)'s home district, #AZ09, are only at 67% of 2016 prez level, vs. 79% in Paul Gosar (R)'s #AZ04, the reddest CD in the state. 		That tells me there are still a hell of a lot of votes left to be counted in Sinema's backyard. #AZSEN

It's astonishing how far VA Republicans have fallen. And *if* Luria, Spanberger &amp; Wexton survive in '20 (a big if), there could be serious redistricting prizes in store for them: Norfolk, Charlottesville &amp; Reston respectively - entrenching a Dem majority in the House delegation.

For the serious election geeks &amp; night owls out there, I'll be un-quarantined and on @MSNBC sporadically between 2am-7am. https://t.co/AZPzk1un8z
There are currently 84 women serving in the House (61D, 23R). Our pre-election estimate (before knowing anything about returns) is that there could be 103 women sworn in in January (86D, 17R).
During election night, I'll be entrusting my Twitter handle to @CookPolitical's brilliant &amp; capable web editor Ally Flinn, pride of Dayton, OH. If we "call" everything w/ no errors/typos, I take full credit. If we don't, we're going to be hiring for a new web editor. J/k Ally.
I'll be part of @NBCNews's House Decision Desk team tonight (tune in!), so @CookPolitical staff will be taking over my handle &amp; results here may be slower/more cautious than usual. The observations reported here don't reflect the judgments of @NBCNews unless explicitly stated.
Have had this nagging feeling all day that if we see upsets in House races, they’ll be in places like Dallas/Houston/Austin (Beto), Atlanta (Abrams) or Miami (Gillum).

One of my favorite parts of 2018: nerding out about the House has been all the rage. Sad it's ending, but today I thought it'd be fun to compare final predictions w/ those of 4 friends. May the best prognosticator win! (only races where we disagreed shown): https://t.co/k08C4IrHyY

If there's a long shot race in our Solid R column that really intrigues me, it's #TX25, which includes UT Austin campus &amp; where Julie Oliver (D) just went up on TV vs. Rep. Roger Williams (R) over the weekend. 		R+11 CD but w/ Beto on the ballot, curious the margin there.
Trump's cultural appeals have energized his base more than tax cuts did in special elections &amp; it's contributing to today's sky-high turnout.		But they could also generate backlash &amp; surprises in "melting pot" burbs like Gwinnett, GA; Fort Bend, TX; Dallas, TX etc. Keep eye out.
If you're looking for surprises/Dem upsets tonight, I'd look at the few remaining Republicans in districts that are (or recently have become) majority non-white. Suburbs of Atlanta, Miami, Houston, etc.
Bottom line: if every Lean/Likely/Solid race breaks as expected, Rs would need to win 23 of 30 @CookPolitical Toss Ups (77%) to keep their House majority. 		Not impossible, but very difficult. https://t.co/evxFYMqJfH

@Nate_Cohn Also: how much demog change/turnover has taken place in #GA06 over the last 16 months? I have to think it could be relevant to the result.
Wow, the end of this closing ad by #PA10 Rep. Scott Perry (R) is something else (@CookPolitical moved from Lean R to Toss Up in our final ratings). https://t.co/VdUyj2kXE5
If the 30 Toss Ups were to break evenly between the parties, Dems would score a net gain of exactly 30 seats. However, "wave" parties typically win solid majorities of Toss Ups &amp; even a few Lean/Likely races.
Here's how to track the House: 		If every Lean/Likely/Solid race were to break as expected, Dems would need to win just 8 of 30 Toss Ups (27%) to win the majority. 		By contrast, Republicans would need to win 23 of 30 Toss Ups (77%) to keep theirs. Not impossible, but difficult. https://t.co/6DhjWGju4S

In some ways, it feels a little like the lead-up to 2012, when the cable TV chatter was obsessed w/ national polls showing Romney closing in on Obama, but in reality Obama retained important advantages in key Electoral College battlegrounds.
This morning's new NBC/WSJ *national* numbers are really positive for Rs: they suggest Dems' &amp; college+ voters' enthusiasm edge is virtually gone.		But we just haven't seen much movement towards Rs in *battleground* House races, where Dems continue to dominate spending/airwaves. https://t.co/sIZgzfr8Mq
It's fascinating to watch the disconnect between cable news, where there's a lot of freaking out about whether the "blue wave" is a thing of the past, vs. district-level polls and spending, which clearly continue to favor Dems.

R incumbents have long had massive problems in elite, upscale Clinton-won burbs like #CO06, #IL06, #KS03 #MN03 &amp; #VA10.		The difference now: R problems are worsening in mixed, middle-income burbs Trump won by single digits like #IL14, #IA03, #GA06 #MI08, &amp; #UT04.
Update: Steve King (R)'s lead has bounced back up to 48%-43% w/ 248 #IA04 respondents. Bouncy &amp; a long way to go, but so far King's own poll - which had him up 52%-34% - looks either outdated, wrong or both.
From a House control standpoint, however, the worse news for Rs is that two incumbents who were thought to be favored a few weeks ago - #GA06 Rep. Karen Handel (R) and #IL14 Rep. Randy Hultgren (R) - are both sucking wind, trailing their Dem opponents at the moment.

New nonpartisan Alaska Survey Research poll finds the *dean of the House* trailing by 1% in #AKAL, the state's lone House seat:		Alyse Galvin (Undeclared/D): 49%	Rep. Don Young (R) 48%		Two weeks ago, @CookPolitical moved the race from Likely R to Lean R.	https://t.co/ZlBM5ccHKr
Then again, you could make the case Spanberger (D)'s current 51%-39% lead in Chesterfield is coming in "hot." Which is why I generally try to avoid critiquing polls by pointing to small, regional subsamples (failing in this case).
Try my best not to "unskew," but interesting results so far in #VA07, where Brat (R) currently leads Spanberger (D) 48%-41%, powered by a 52%-39% lead in Henrico (by far the most Dem part of the CD). I'm guessing it'll tighten. https://t.co/86XwsdF8kO
Wouldn't beat myself up if that happens. We think anything from 20 to 45 is well within realm of possibility, but 30-40 is the most likely outcome as of *today.* https://t.co/uo7KbdeTFV
The fact that many of these "single digit Trump" suburbs - along with Trump-won open seats like #FL15, #NM02 &amp; #VA05 - are now in serious jeopardy is what could push Dem gains into the 30-40 seat range (vs. 25-35 before).
3) Finally, middle-class burbs where Trump won by single digits that will decide the majority: places like #IL14 Hultgren, #IA03 Young, #MI08 Bishop, #PA10 Perry, #UT04 Love, #WA03 Herrera Beutler. *This* is the bucket where we've seen Dems make the most progress recently.
2) Competitive races in redder, working-class districts that Trump won by double digits in '16, such as #IL12 Bost, #MN08 OPEN, #NY22 Tenney, #WV03 OPEN, etc. Overall, things have slightly improved in "Trump zones" for Rs, w/ notable exceptions in districts like #KS02 &amp; #ME02.
1) Vulnerable Rs in upscale, suburban, Clinton-won "Whole Foods" districts like #VA10 Comstock, #KS03 Yoder, #CO06 Coffman, #MN03 Paulsen, #CA45 Walters, #NJ07 Lance, etc. These Rs are mostly trailing &amp; their numbers haven't gotten any better recently.

I'm skeptical. @SusquehannaPR's Trump approval %s in both #PA11 &amp; #PA16 are both 12% below his share of the vote in each CD, which to me suggests a sample that's too "hot" for Dems. https://t.co/FenxuEpWpI

No doubt it's a great internal number for King - and reinforces that he's still the clear fave in #IA04 - but it's also a week older than the @ChangePolls survey &amp; also may help explain why King hasn't aired any ads/taken the race seriously. https://t.co/VbklLENyoF
To be clear, Rohrabacher's still in a lot of trouble. It's just amazing he's still in the game given the other three OC R's are women w/ more conventional GOP appeal &amp; are running more robust campaigns.
Remarkable: of the four R-held Clinton CDs in Orange County, the Republican w/ the best chance of winning is probably #CA48 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R).
King's only response? An Oct. 22-24 @WPAIntel (R) poll showing him leading 52%-34%. https://t.co/yN0JFdzu4K
This is a *very* different situation than '12 or '14, when King ran was less of a pariah, ran a robust TV campaign &amp; won #IA04 convincingly. He's now completely dark on TV &amp; his campaign's YouTube channel hasn't been updated in 4 years. https://t.co/4DkGQbvA6X https://t.co/9H7WXpCzbh

King is virtually broke (had $176k on hand in mid-Oct. and badly outraised by Scholten) &amp; with a week left, it's unclear who's going to bail him out. The only thing he's got going for him now is #IA04's 27% Trump margin &amp; R+11 PVI. https://t.co/8v5GWFm7tY
So far in #IA04, J.D. Scholten (D) has spent over $1.4 million &amp; has been on air *unanswered* for 2 weeks. An Evan McMullin-backed PAC has joined w/ $300k calling King (R) "Klan &amp; Neo-Nazi approved."		King's spent $782k, but mostly on fundraising/family salaries. No ads yet (!).

New at @CookPolitical: #IA04 Rep. Steve King (R) moves from Likely R to Lean R. This is the first serious challenge he's faced in his R+11 CD since '12, except this time he's almost broke &amp; not running a real campaign.

Of all the Republicans in R+11 PVI districts who have no one to blame but themselves for their tough re-elections (Collins, Hunter, King), King is unique in that in that he’s not running a serious campaign. He’s spent most of his $ on fundraising and only has $176k on hand.

There are a few reasons to doubt they'll break in the same pattern as '06/'10:		1) R voters are far more engaged in '18 than they were in '06 or Dems were in '10.	2) Far more polling this year, giving us more opportunities to "diagnose" R problems. Still, a few surprises likely.
I went back thru @CookPolitical's final ratings for 2006 &amp; 2010 last night.

R improvement has been most pronounced in the Senate, but Rs have also seen uptick in plenty of CDs where Trump was over 50% in ‘16: #AR02, #IL12, #MN08, #NY22, #OH01, #TX31, #WV03.		Are there exceptions? Sure. But overall, I do think this *probably* lowers Dems’ ceiling a bit.
To extent there's been movement since Labor Day, we've *mostly* seen House/Sen races polarize in the direction of partisan fundamentals, which is...what usually happens.		That *probably* limits how deeply Dems can drive into Trump country, but still a high degree of uncertainty.
@bgold1711 Right, I'm saying it's the opposite of the rural/anti-Obama CDs Dems were defending/losing in '10.
Like many Ds sitting in rural, anti-Obama CDs in '10, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R)'s problem is she's got too many #VA10 voters to please: Fairfax/Loudoun ppl who can't stand Trump, and Valley ppl who think she's not pro-Trump enough. 		At some point, you fall off that tightrope.
Interesting thing in #NY23 is that Reed (R) has succeeded several times by running against part of *his own* district - calling his opponents "liberal Ithaca extremists" - several times. Same dynamic working in his favor yet again this time. https://t.co/auGCz1Fc9V
New Post/Schar poll finds Jennifer Wexton (D) leading #VA10 Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) 56%-43%.		Ralph Northam (D) ‘17 margin in #VA10? 56%-43%. 		Fundamentally, the political enviro hasn’t changed that much in a year. @CookPolitical rating: Lean D.
Shocker: turns out culture wars (Kavanaugh, caravan) are better-suited than tax cuts for awakening the Trump base for R candidates.		Even so, late surge in young/nonwhite engagement keeps Dems poised for big House/Gov gains. 		Folks, this is gonna be a very high turnout midterm.
District-level polls bolstering national evidence Latino voters are *finally* engaging after weak numbers all year. https://t.co/59RWiJWz58
Next time you hear "What happened to the wave??," keep in mind:		1) Trump's %s w/ college+ women are still horrendous	2) Rs have ticked up in areas Trump surged in '16, but not in the bulk of suburban CDs that will decide House	3) 23+ seats (still consensus forecast) *is* a wave

I find myself looking at the @FiveThirtyEight "Classic" model a lot, comparing notes. https://t.co/GiMzLNYCFG
For a sober discussion of how voting laws will affect the midterms, I recommend this week’s @FiveThirtyEight podcast moderated by @galendruke: https://t.co/WFWwFN77lj
There are a ton of valid concerns about the restrictive impact of new voting laws &amp; voters improperly removed from rolls, but there's also a lot of outrage-stoking and sloppy journalism in this realm that are counterproductive to fixing real problems.
Too many stories ascribing sinister motives to "voter purges" need more:		1) Prominent context that removing inactive voters from rolls is a necessary &amp; standard practice in every state w/ registration	2) Hard evidence that election admins disregarded laws/procedures in doing so.
Of the 46 R seats we rate as most vulnerable (Toss Up or worse), *33* are predominantly suburban. Only a handful more rural like #IA01 or #ME02.		So yes, Dems are holding their own in Obama/Trump districts. But any House takeover is very likely to be driven by anti-Trump suburbs. https://t.co/qVNIisX5Rq
Yes, they’re performing about as well in both &amp; agree w/ you on mean reversion. But b/c Dems already hold 14/28 Obama-Trump seats and *zero* Romney-Clintons, it’s accurate to say Dem *gains* are likely to be concentrated in burbs where Trump is weak. https://t.co/CaT9aIhkAc
Biggest remaining question in #VA05: will there be a Bigfoot sighting in an ad?
Btw, how are those predictions that pro-impeachment/single-payer Andrew Gillum would tank Dems chances in #FLGOV working out? [end 1am rant]
In addition, today’s warnings that Dems “can’t afford to fall off a socialist cliff” are likely just as wrong as the RNC’s post-2012 autopsy.		The people Dems badly need to win back - young and/or nonwhite casual voters - wouldn’t mind. Authenticity, not ideology, motivates them.
Also, the more I watch ‘18, the more convinced I am that Dems’ ideal nominee vs. Trump probably isn’t someone in their 70s.
The more I watch ‘18, the more convinced I am Dems badly want to nominate a woman in 2020.* 		*and if not a woman, Beto or Gillum

@NateSilver538 @Nate_Cohn Can confirm there has been polling in #CO03. Our rating: Likely R.
Good news for Dems in #MN01, a rural Trump CD rumored to be getting away from them. https://t.co/gasRDXcQEI
@Ja_Bresler i'm all ears
New must-read @amyewalter, including what she learned "tromping around newly built golf course communities" while tagging along w/ canvassers in #VA07. https://t.co/VvVfsWp6Qc
@MarkP21 There's one Dem-held seat (#MN01) in Toss Up, so they need 9.
By contrast, Republicans would need to win 22 of the 30 Toss Ups (73%) to hold their majority. That's pretty hard to do when your president's at 43% approval.
At the moment, there are 17 GOP-held seats in Lean/Likely Dem and 2 Dem-held seats in Lean/Likely R. If all those races break as forecast, Dems only need to win 9 of the 30 Toss Ups (30%) to win the majority.
New @CookPolitical House ratings: 72 competitive seats (68R, 4D), including 30 Toss Ups (29R, 1D). If Toss Ups split evenly, Dems would net 29 seats. Here's a presentation-ready PDF to help you keep track: https://t.co/cKEDkSNlXu https://t.co/LsBknoLSVt
Lots of GOP-drawn maps are unraveling at the moment, but the 2011 IL map Dems drew also looks pretty shortsighted today.		Dems could have easily made Roskam's #IL06 &amp; Hultgren's #IL14 much more wave-winnable &amp; drawn one solid Dem downstate seat. Sold themselves short.
But, consider this scenario:		1) Pritzker wins #ILGOV in '18	2) Bost (R) #IL12 &amp; Davis (R) #IL13 win reelection in '18 &amp; '20	3) IL loses a House seat in '20 Census		In '21, Dems could easily merge Bost &amp; Davis in one super-Dem CD combining Champaign &amp; E. St. Louis. Huge swing.
Most frustrating race for Dems? Maybe #IL12, where Rep. Mike Bost (R) has pulled ahead of prized recruit Brendan Kelly (D) in a coal/steel CD Trump won by 14%. Trump rallying w/ Bost on Saturday. Today, @CookPolitical moved from Toss Up to Lean R.
Reality check: Trump’s job approval among female college graduates in newest NBC/WSJ poll: 27%/70%. The “blue wave” = suburban women. https://t.co/jt0sOI70qA
Of note in Tom DeLay’s old seat: between 2010 and 2017, #TX22’s population grew 28%. Its non-Hispanic white share fell from 45% to 40% &amp; its Asian share rose from 16% to 19%. In ‘16 it voted for Trump by 7.8%, down from Romney’s 25% win in ‘12. 		I’d watch this one. https://t.co/mQraPvpZLv

We’ve also revised our ratings in two TX races at @CookPolitical, including #TX22, perhaps the most rapidly diversifying seat in the country:		#TX22: Olson (R) - Likely R to Lean R	#TX31: Carter (R) - Lean R to Likely R

Wow, probably not the best look for this Dem self-funder. #PA01 https://t.co/dVNgqHEOvV
Beware the tendency to group all Hispanic voters into one voting bloc. Similar variances between urban/rural, men/women &amp; education levels exist *within* the Latinx electorate as outside of it (just not quite as large disparities as among non-Hispanic whites).
If you’re looking for places where Dems might score shocking upsets, I’d focus much more on places where Trump’s ‘16 % was weak over places where Dems have raised a whole bunch of $$ but his % was strong.
Again, I'd be cautious about Latinos at 71% interest, especially b/c NBC/WSJ measured it at 47% less than a month ago. But there's no question this will be a younger, far less white electorate than 2010/2014.
Hard to overstate how much different this midterm electorate will look vs. 2014/2010, which were utterly dominated by older &amp; white voters.		If 2010 was the "Year of the Angry White Senior," 2018 is most definitely the "Year of the Fired Up Female College Graduate." https://t.co/tsCKPefo25
Latest NBC/WSJ data: Republicans have narrowed Dems' enthusiasm gap from 10% earlier this year to 4% in mid-October. 		The even better news for Dems: new data shows huge, unprecedented last-minute surge in Latino/18-34 voting enthusiasm. Is it an outlier? We'll see. https://t.co/rnWq78lDt2
New NBC/WSJ poll shows Trump job approval rating w/ college+ women at 27%-70% (!) vs. non-college men at 64%-32%. 		Biggest GOP problem in 2018: women w/ college degrees are the likeliest demographic to turn out in a midterm election.

Wave elections can also be realigning elections. If Rs take over #MN08 &amp; keep #KY06 but Dems still net ~30 seats &amp; win control, that's still a wave in my book.		Remember: in 2010 GOP wave, Dems still flipped 3 seats in DE, HI &amp; LA. https://t.co/cw35Uqxm5m

Just ran the numbers: of the 46 GOP-held House seats in the deepest trouble (Toss Up or Lean/Likely D at @CookPolitical), 63% contain a Whole Foods Market (vs. 38% of all 194 other GOP-held seats). https://t.co/pF3pt9mrbS
Trivia: I was running the data, and because of the way Salt Lake City’s districts are divided to dilute Dem votes, Rep. Mia Love (R) is actually the only one of UT’s 4 reps whose district doesn’t contain a WF.
Strange things happen in wave elections... https://t.co/m0UV0UXszB
Tbh, a huge problem for House Rs is that they still hold a lot of Whole Foods districts where Trump’s numbers suck: #CA45, #CA48, #CO06, #IL06, #KS03, #MN03, #NJ07, #NJ11, #TX07, #TX32, #UT04, #VA10 &amp; more. Now, those seats are in deep trouble.

Three big reasons Dems remain the clear favorites for House control:		1) A historic number of GOP open seats	2) Republicans in white-collar districts where Trump's numbers suck	3) GOP incumbents who have no one to blame but themselves for their reelection troubles
My latest for @NBCNews: the 75 districts - and nine types of races - that will decide the fate of the House. https://t.co/QbyQp72Z1H
@NateSilver538 Makes sense, thanks. I'd argue these two also had unusually strong challengers in '16 relative to other R incumbents, which helps explain their underwhelming margins.
Actually "less elastic" refers to an entirely different effect: voters are much less likely to ticket-split or be swayed by things like candidate quality than in past decades. https://t.co/Dw4182beR8
@d_mccarthy37 Nah this would be a 6-5 map.
It's entirely premature yet irresistible to look at potential impacts of '18/'20 election outcomes on 2021 remap dealmaking.		For example, let's say Dems hold #VA07 &amp; #VA10 but Rs hold #VA02 &amp; #VA05 in 2021. There'd be very easy &amp; effective trades to shore all of those up. https://t.co/tmUgrUvAts
@NateSilver538 Randomly, I'm curious why the model shows #CO03 &amp; #MI07 as Toss Ups, when few of us pen-and-pad pundits view them as competitive. They seem like outliers vs. similar districts the model rates as Likely/Solid.
@NateSilver538 Oh believe me, the question of which Solid R seats should be in our Likely R column (and there are like 20 I could make a case for) is what keeps me up at night. I’m sure a few will end up being close &amp; it kills me not to know which ones. Partly what makes this so much fun.
@NateSilver538 I certainly see it as a decent proxy for those things too. But sometimes $ can reflect enthusiasm from outside the CD (e.g. MJ Hegar, Andrew Janz). And sometimes candidate quality doesn’t end up mattering much. My point is, the tale $$ tells can vary a lot from race to race.
@NateSilver538 Also think you’d agree Q3 FEC reports can be an imperfect gauges. For example, I’m not convinced McMurray’s $460k-$6k quarter over Collins suddenly swings the margin +8 for Dems in #NY27, considering Collins could prob write himself a late 7-figure check. https://t.co/VUtAfD71oT
@NateSilver538 Entirely fair. I’m betting on “too much” and we’ll see which way it goes. In my experience, the importance of $$ is frequently overstated in House analysis &amp; the role of fundamentals (PVI/partisan lean/turnout dynamics/demographics) undervalued.
P.S. This is not to downplay the magnitude of Dems’ fundraising success or argue $$ is a bad thing to have. It’s obviously a really, really good thing to have. We just don’t have a lot of recent, consistent examples of *how much* massive $$ disparities actually move races.
A lot also depends on *how* these Dems spend their $$ and whether they truly have an airtime edge in the final weeks or already had their chance to be on air unanswered. 		Personally, I might still be in the 75% chance &amp; 30-35 seat range. We’ll see.
Dem fundraising numbers &amp; cash advantages over R incumbents are without precedent. But there’s no guarantee lots more $$ will move races by a lot, especially in a hyper-partisan era when districts are less elastic than they used to be.
The 538 House “Classic” forecast now has Dems at 84% to take control &amp; an average gain of 39 seats. I suspect both are slightly too high, b/c the model is reading a bit too much into Dems’ staggering Q3 $$ bonanza. https://t.co/k8K9YCvnzg

@henryolsenEPPC @SteveKornacki Actually, only a tiny sliver of Salt Lake City is in #UT04. Its suburbs are the bulk of the CD.

Races where long-shot Dems have outraised R incumbents can look intriguing, but keep in mind 1) cash on hand and 2) what that $$ buys. Horn's $178k cash on hand isn't going to buy a ton of airtime in Oklahoma City. https://t.co/OWcmmX4DHc

The opposite end of the $ spectrum: #CA22, where Andrew Janz (D) outraised Rep. Devin Nunes (R) $4.4 million to $3.1 million in a district that gave Trump a nearly identical margin. @CookPolitical rating: Solid R.
What if you held an election in a CD Trump won w/ under 52% and no one bothered to run a real campaign or raise money?		Welcome to Grand Rapids, where Cathy Albro (D) outraised #Mi03 Rep. Justin Amash (R) $70,000 to $43,000 in Q3. @CookPolitical rating: Likely R.
To beat Trump, I'm of the mind Dems are going to need nothing short of the absolute best they've got.		Right now, in terms of bio/charisma/natsec appeal, several of the 1st-time women running in '18 imho outshine many of the household-name pols most often polled for '20.

This is awful for Senate Dems, who need to win every Clinton state + 11 Trump states for control.		But it also probably limits upper gains for House Dems, since 47/69 competitive seats are Trump CDs. Dems still clear faves for control, but maybe not 79% as @FiveThirtyEight says.
October polls: Dems mostly doing better than we thought in Clinton-won areas &amp; Rs better than we thought in Trump-won areas. 		Could be Kavanaugh...but it could also be the same “base homecoming” we’ve seen in the final weeks of pretty much every election in the past decade.

The reality is: Trump won 46.1% nationally &amp; lost the popular vote by 2.9 million but carried 60/100 Senate seats. Not sure how many Dems fully grasp how huge a problem that is going forward.
@chrislhayes @NickBaumann Yes
The reactions to Kavanaugh in the House vs. Senate battlefields could be night &amp; day. More on this divergence dynamic (from August): https://t.co/KoZbvK7gMq
Remarkable: of the 68 most competitive House districts (Lean/Toss Up), only 16 are taking place in states with a competitive Senate race. That’s almost unheard of &amp; a big reason we could be headed for a divergent outcome on Election Night.
Not sure if it’s blissful ignorance during a “blue wave,” but IMHO many Dems are majorly underestimating/overlooking how weak their hand could be in Congress over the long term when these red state seats finally fall.
@mattyglesias I’d say there’s a big asterisk next to that one.

Keep in mind, the Kavanaugh effect will likely be *VERY* different in the Senate (red/rural states where Dems have to vote on him) vs. the House (swing suburban CDs where Rs are already battling Trump's unpopularity).
There's still plenty of time for conditions to change, but right now the likeliest outcome appears to be a Democratic gain of between 25 and 40 seats (Democrats need +23 for House control).
@mcjenmcg @Bencjacobs @CookPolitical No.

Andrew Janz (D) announces $4.3 million raised against Rep. Devin Nunes (R) in #CA22. That’s quite a lot for a Solid R race.
When I think about some of the Dem "recruitment failure" districts that could still be close b/c the environment is so terrible for Rs, I think of CDs like #AZ06 #MI03 #TX10 #TX24. I'll still be watching these closely on Election Night despite an utter lack of spending.

Republicans are still spending in #VA10 out of personal loyalty to Comstock (R), not because she has a good chance of winning. @CookPolitical rating: Lean D. https://t.co/URE4JKwcB5
This is precisely what happened to ‘17 VA Dems, who *underestimated* the wave and failed to adequately fund a bunch of 2nd-tier Dems who fell just short while many of the best-funded won by a mile.
By contrast, there are still a lot of races without star candidates that are *underfunded* for Dems. Dems risk leaving a few of them on the table on Election Night.
McGrath (D)’s problem is that she’s well past the point of diminishing returns in a market as cheap as Lexington &amp; even risks fatiguing #KY06 voters (see Ossoff, Jon). https://t.co/xorY9VVcBr
Btw, #OH01 also interesting bc the Dem base in this heavily gerrymandered CD isn’t upscale suburban whites as much as African-Americans. Part of why we might not be seeing as much elasticity/pro-Dem movement here.
Yes, Dem $$ numbers for Q3 are going to be insane &amp; unprecedented. And no, having a lot of $$ is not a guarantee of moving votes/victory in a polarized era.

An extra few million $$ spent on one cash-saturated race would probably be better spent polling dozens of long-shot districts and identifying a handful w/ potential. Every cycle, a handful of races w/ no $$ are squeakers, and many multi-million $$ affairs are blowouts.
In my experience, the parties in Sept/Oct over-obsess about the *hyped* races w/ millions of $$ already committed, when they should be putting more effort into identifying *close* yet overlooked races that could effectively be bought.

Just watched this debate. On paper, should be a great match up for Dems: young businesswoman/outsider vs. R incumbent who's been running for decades &amp; more comfortable w/ spreadsheets than voters. But without any Dem $$ in an expensive market, may turn into a missed opportunity.
A possible sleeper House race: #AZ06, where Rep. Dave Schweikert (R) is under an ethics probe in a Phoenix CD that gave Trump 51.6%. 		But so far the DCCC &amp; underfunded nominee Anita Malik (D) haven't been able to get on the same page. May be too late. https://t.co/xoXdZsj2ki
The House polling we've seen - both public and private - was already pretty terrible for Republicans, but has gotten noticeably worse since Labor Day (with a few exceptions, mostly in substantially Hispanic districts)
@PatrickRuffini ...and that's his biggest problem right now. Any statewide Dem "perfect storm" in TX likely requires big Latino support/enthusiasm. Otherwise, math just doesn't work.
Fact: in the last midterms, 27% of eligible Hispanics voted vs. 46% of eligible whites. And just 20% (!) of eligible 18-29 year olds voted. vs. 59% of seniors.		These enthusiasm gaps are still *big* obstacles to Dems (especially Beto) fully capitalizing on 2018. https://t.co/JtlLNVtkwh

#FL26 Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) has erased a 13% lead &amp; stormed into a tie w/ about 3/4 of the poll done. Unique CD where non-white voters are the R base. https://t.co/bRAsa25CwB
This would be a mirror image of what happened post-Labor Day 2010, when a lot of polls suddenly showed the bottom dropping out for previously popular incumbent Dems in districts Obama had lost by a lot.
The only NYT/Siena polls so far that have fundamentally changed my view of a race: #CO06 &amp; #MN03, both in Dems’ direction. 		These CDs have a lot in common and it could be a sign of the bottom simply falling out for Rs in upscale suburban Clinton zones.
For example, Davis (D) is up 1% in #KS02, but the fact he’s better-known than Watkins (R) by 17 points says he’s still the underdog, imho.		The fact that Roskam (R) is up 1% in #IL06 despite being better-known than Casten (D) by 27 points should tell you he’s in *deep* trouble.
A district’s partisan lean is likely to tell you a lot about the nature of the undecideds, a too-often overlooked group in 2016. 		And, candidates’ images are valuable indicators of their upside vs. a poll. In many races, candidates’ leads are really temporary name ID advantages.
Knowing who’s truly “ahead” in a poll involves a lot more than reading the top line numbers.		For example, I’d *much* rather be Sean Casten (D), who’s trailing by one in #IL06 (Clinton +7) than Paul Davis (D), who leads by one in #KS02 (Trump +18). https://t.co/7dexcV9uRJ
Quite a few Dems now regretful Shalala (D) effectively pushed Jose Javier Rodriguez (D) out of #FL27 months ago. Clinton +19 district, but Dems are stuck with a problematic candidate matchup.
DCCC announces 9 new additions to “Red to Blue” list of 83 supported candidates. An odd omission: Anita Malik (D) in #AZ06, who’s running vs. an R incumbent under ethics investigation (Dave Schweikert) in a CD Trump won by single digits.
Interesting rumblings out of #FL27, a seat that should be "in the bag" for Dems in this enviro. Donna Shalala (D) hasn't put Maria Elvira Salazar (R) away.

That said, most district-level polls that *do* comport w/ what we know about changes in the political enviro vs. '16 are still really bad for Rs.
To me, the Trump # isn't a "whoa." It's a sign this #NC02 poll's sample is likely too generous to Dems (as Civitas's #NC09 poll was as well). Trump at -14% approval in a CD he won by 12% doesn't comport w/ national movement vs. '16. https://t.co/wA3zd0faQf

Projection: Chris Pappas (D) wins #NH01 Dem primary, defeating Maura Sullivan (D). Eddie Edwards (R) looking like favorite on R side.
Trivia: #NH01 Chris Pappas (D) would be the first Pappas in Congress since my childhood congressman Mike Pappas (R), who did *this* on the House floor in 1998 (and proceeded to lose reelection in a massive upset that fall): https://t.co/zD2V0QJXeE
#NH01: Pappas (D) is also winning some towns closer to Seacoast like Strafford &amp; Rollinsford...good sign for him over Sullivan (D) so far.
#NH01: Maura Sullivan (D) takes Brentwood, 161 to 140. To the extent she has a base at all, it'll be closer to the Seacoast.
FWIW, Bernie Sanders's son Levi Sanders is currently in 6th place with 2% of the Dem primary vote in #NH01.
#NH01: No surprise, Chris Pappas (D) leads Maura Sullivan (D) 63%-21% in Manchester. Impressive, but need to see how rest of CD develops.

Reminder: weird, unexpected things can happen in waves. In July of 2010, #TX27 Rep. Solomon Ortiz (D) led his GOP challenger, a random dude named Blake Farenthold, 90-to-1 in cash on hand. Guess who won?
To be clear: Dems don't even have a credible candidate vs. Marchant in #TX24. But it gave Trump 50.5% in 2016, and Cruz's numbers in high-education TX burbs are worse. These types of CDs are worth watching.
Three more House rating changes in deep red districts at @CookPolitical:		#MO02 Rep. Ann Wagner (R) - Likely R to Lean R	#TX22 Rep. Pete Olson (R) - Solid R to Likely R	#TX24 Rep. Kenny Marchant (R) - Solid R to Likely R

Fact: so far in 2018 Dems have nominated women in 50% of House races, excluding incumbents (125/252). On GOP side, 18% (33/188).
Update: so far in 2018 Dem House primaries featuring one woman, one man &amp; no incumbent on ballot, a woman has won 69% of the time (98/142). On GOP side, 34% (16/47).
In #AZ06, Anita Malik (D) has pulled ahead in primary to take on Rep. Dave Schweikert (R). This district's worth watching: it's about 4% less Republican than neighboring #AZ08 (where Dems came close in April) &amp; Schweikert is under an ethics investigation. Potential sleeper.

Projection: Rep. Al Lawson (D) survives primary, defeating fmr. Jacksonville Mayor Alvin Brown (D) in safe Dem #FL05.
Projection: Mike Waltz (R) wins primary for open #FL06, will face Nancy Soderberg (D) in November. @CookPolitical rating: Likely R.
Projection: it's Andrew Gillum (D) vs. Ron DeSantis (R) for #FLGOV in November. Wow, what a turn of events.
Hard to see a path for Graham (D) at this point. Rarely have we seen fortunes turn so quickly moving from early to E-Day votes in a primary. #FLGOV
In fact, I'd rather be Gillum (D) at this point. #FLGOV
I take that back - Andrew Gillum (D) turning in a sensational Election Day performance. Not sure Graham (D)'s lead can survive Broward. #FLGOV

Another @CookPolitical rating change coming this week: #IA04 Rep. Steve King (R) moves from Solid R to Likely R.
Following last night's Alaska primary results, @CookPolitical will be moving 85-year old #AKAL Rep. Don Young (R), the dean of the House, from Solid R to Likely R. He faces Alyse Galvin (I), who will appear as "endorsed by the Democratic Party" on the fall ballot.
After reading more of the indictment, we've moved Hunter two columns from Solid R to Lean R at @CookPolitical. To put it in perspective, at R+11, #CA50 is three points less R than Alabama. https://t.co/mAdCOttOtp https://t.co/jn0OvuBAWZ
Some news: the @CookPolitical Report has an exciting project debuting later this week. It's our first-ever collaboration with election geek/mapmaker extraordinaire @JMilesColeman. We can't wait for our subscribers to see it.

In case you're wondering: the third member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump in '16 was then-Sen. Jeff Sessions. https://t.co/l56mPOGNJo
There are no write-ins in CA general elections &amp; no mechanisms for Rs to get Hunter off the ballot. Another headache for Rs in what should be a safe seat. #CA50
#CA50 Rep. Duncan Hunter (R) will be moving from Solid R back to Likely R at @CookPolitical &amp; has the potential to get more competitive.
When it rains, it pours. #CA50 https://t.co/VuXrPTVxAy
Put another way: a majority of the Senate now represents Trump-won states that make up 34% of the country's population. Keep in mind: this body has the final say on any impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/7AQlcUFN20
#NC02 Rep. George Holding (R) has been telling GOP donors for nearly a week that his own poll showed him trailing Linda Coleman (D) by 3%. It's an R+7 district, but something may be going on in the Triangle/Wake Co.
If that red-state Dem dam breaks - and it *could* in November - we could be headed for a Senate that's largely accountable to a white, rural, pro-Trump minority of the country. At some point, the coastal/urban majority could run out of patience - threatening democratic stability.
For all the gerrymandering in the House, it's actually the Senate that's vastly more unrepresentative. The fact it's remotely close owes to 11 red-state Dem senators - almost entirely up in 2018 - who have hung on thanks to an extraordinary combination of skill &amp; luck.
And, 60% of the Senate now represents just 24% of the country’s population. This penalty for Dems is on full display in 2018: https://t.co/qmCDpXQkLy
A long-term problem for Democrats: a majority of the Senate now represents 18% of the country’s population.

A lot of Dems tend to forget: this year's median competitive Senate seat gave Trump 56% in '16 &amp; is 80% white. 		Median competitive House seat: 49% Trump, 74% white.		U.S. as a whole: 46% Trump, 62% white.		https://t.co/qmCDpXyJmY
We've never seen this little overlap: of the 64 most competitive House races, just 14 are in states with competitive Senate races. This suburban vs. rural dynamic could have long-lasting consequences. https://t.co/qmCDpXyJmY https://t.co/4Q8M0zIkrI
Mars vs. Venus: in 2018, the median competitive Senate seat is 7% more pro-Trump, 4x less dense, 5% less college-educated &amp; 7% whiter than the median competitive House seat. https://t.co/qmCDpXyJmY https://t.co/hP4jCQx5b6
Fact: if every state/district's result in November were an 8% uniform swing in Dems' favor from the '16 prez result, Dems would simultaneously gain 44 House seats (almost twice the +23 they need), but *lose* 4 Senate seats. https://t.co/qmCDpXyJmY https://t.co/d00c4PyRkd

@JMilesColeman Wow, I guess the margins in those rural counties were huge. Threw me off a bit. Thanks.
@JMilesColeman Miles are you sure? Looking at the county turnout map I don’t really see a way #WI07 could be 58%-42% R. Looks much, much closer.
Reason 12,345 why 2018 is weird: 		Trump won #WV03's open seat by *50%* &amp; *lost* Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R)'s #FL26 by 16%. Today, @CookPolitical rates both races the same: Lean R.

That leaves 12 Clinton-CD Rs in Toss Up/worse:		#CA10 Denham	#CA25 Knight	#CA45 Walters	#CA48 Rohrabacher	#CO06 Coffman	#IL06 Roskam	#KS03 Yoder	#MN03 Paulsen	#NJ07 Lance	#TX07 Culberson	#TX32 Sessions	#VA10 Comstock (Lean D)		Together, that's 20/23 seats Dems need for majority.
Remember, another 8/25 Clinton-CD Rs aren't running:		#AZ02 McSally	#CA39 Royce	#CA49 Issa	#FL27 Ros-Lehtinen	#PA05 Meehan	#PA06 Costello	#PA07 Dent	#WA08 Reichert		It's possible Dems could pick up all 8 of them. Incumbent parties have batted 0/23 in these situations since '94.
@BobbyBigWheel @ppppolls not public.
@BobbyBigWheel that one's a serious outlier. also, it's @ppppolls.
Keep in mind, this is a Dem poll showing Curbelo (R) still decently ahead in #FL26. https://t.co/Q0V3QFvWCu
Of the 25 House Rs in Clinton districts, only 5 currently appear well-positioned to defy a "Blue Wave:" 		#CA21 David Valadao	#FL26 Carlos Curbelo	#NY24 John Katko	#PA01 Brian Fitzpatrick	#TX23 Will Hurd		Why? They built pretty strong moderate brands *before* Trump took office.

Outside of the redrawn #PA14, I think the Iron Range #MN08 (Stauber vs. Radinovich) is probably Rs' best House pickup opportunity in the country.
There you have it, just about every major race is done/called/put to bed. Wow, an early night for once.
Projection: former Gov. Tim Pawlenty (R) has lost the #MNGOV GOP primary to Jeff Johnson (R).
Projection: Jim Hagedorn (R) wins GOP primary in #MN01, will face Dan Feehan (D) in November. @CookPolitical rating: Toss Up.
Projection: Joe Radinovich (D) wins DFL nomination in Iron Range's #MN08, will face Pete Stauber (R) in November. @CookPolitical rating: Toss Up.
In #MNGOV, Jeff Johnson (R)'s lead over Tim Pawlenty (R) has narrowed a bit to 53%-44%, but it's just really hard to see where Pawlenty makes up that ground.
Projection: Randy Bryce (D) wins Dem primary, will take on Bryan Steil (R) in November for Speaker Paul Ryan's #WI01. @CookPolitical rating: Lean R.
Projection: state Sen. Leah Vukmir (R) wins primary to face Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D) in November. @CookPolitical rating: Likely D.
Projection: Tim Walz (D) wins DFL nomination for #MNGOV.
Projection: UW system regent Bryan Steil (R) wins GOP primary for Speaker Paul Ryan's open #WI01. Looks likely to face Randy Bryce (D) in fall.
Projection: Somali-American former refugee Ilhan Omar (D) wins the DFL primary for #MN05. She and #MI13's Rashida Tlaib (D) will become the first Muslim women in Congress.
Projection: Tony Evers (D) wins #WIGOV primary to face Gov. Scott Walker (R).
Tim Walz (DFL) performing impressively in #MNGOV primary so far. Meanwhile, Tim Pawlenty (R) in some real trouble vs. Jeff Johnson (R).
Projection: Jahana Hayes (D) wins #CT05 Dem primary, will face Manny Santos (R) in November. @CookPolitical rating: Solid D.

I could add many more:		5) your incumbents in tough districts are calling it quits	6) voters start caring about your side’s scandals a lot more than your opponents’	7) you recently started voting against your own party/president but voters aren’t giving you any credit
Signs you’re in danger of a wave:		1) your voters aren’t turning out	2) your incumbents are getting outraised	3) the other party has candidates in virtually all 435 districts	4) you keep waiting for things to “get better” and they don’t.		2010, meet your mirror image: 2018.
@JoeySchmittPhD @FiveThirtyEight I totally sympathize with you. Alas, the PVI metric predates my time at the Cook Political Report.
This is slightly different from @FiveThirtyEight's also-useful "partisan lean," which averages parties' past *margins.* Hence why our R+7 might be their R+14.
To clarify @CookPolitical PVI: it measures how much more D/R each district votes relative to the nation in the last 2 prez elections. 		So in a neutral political enviro, an R in an R+7 seat might expect 57% of the two-party vote. A Dem in a D+4 district might expect 54%, etc.
@philbrown1787 @SteveSchmidtSES PVI measures how much more D/R the district votes for prez than the nation as a whole. 538 measures the margin b/t Ds/Rs, so effectively double.
*checks 2017 gubernatorial results in #VA10* 		Ralph Northam (D) 55.6%	Ed Gillespie (R) 43.3% https://t.co/jLhcae9tWR
Of the 62 seats we rate as "competitive" (Lean or Toss Up), Dems now only need to win 25 (40%) to win the majority. Republicans need to win 38/62 (61%).
If Dems hold all of their own seats (except #PA14) &amp; win all 10 R seats rated Lean/Likely Dem, they'd need to win 14 more for a majority. There are 25 R seats in Toss Up &amp; 26 more in Lean R.
Latest @CookPolitical House ratings: 66 at-risk seats (61 R-held, 5 D-held rated Lean or worse). https://t.co/mAdCOtLpRZ https://t.co/8sj7yyyxnD
To give you an idea: if Dems were to overperform PVI by 8% in all 435 districts this November (won't happen b/c of R incumbency, etc.), they'd pick up 81 House seats - more than triple the 23 they need.
Now *final:* Dems overperformed @CookPolitical PVI by an average of 8% in this cycle's 9 House specials where both parties appeared on the final ballot. https://t.co/xJTbCBsnaG
Lines up pretty well w/ '17/'18 results. https://t.co/3CLbN2YAYR
But it's also why CDs w/ big urban/rural divides are especially dangerous for Rs. For example, high D energy in Portland/Spokane/Seattle burbs &amp; low R energy in rurals is a potentially toxic combo for #WA03 Herrera Beutler (R), #WA05 McMorris Rodgers (R), #WA08 Rossi (R).
That's why I'm skeptical when I hear, for example, @SteveSchmidtSES say #OH12 is evidence districts like Rep. Bob Gibbs's #OH07 are "in play." It's an R+12 seat w/ far more rural areas/far fewer anti-Trump suburbs than #OH12 (R+7).
Pattern in #ALSEN, #PA18 &amp; #OH12: Dems aren't necessarily making huge % strides in hardcore Trump zones. There, it's more a story of pathetic R turnout, which then allows anti-Trump energy in burbs to put Dems in contention.
@SeanTrende @nathanlgonzales @kkondik @geoffreyvs Virgil Goode (R) became obsessed with Islam/immigration &amp; lost #VA05 in ‘08. Mike Pappas (R) sang about Ken Starr on the House floor &amp; lost #NJ12 in ‘98. Both used to be my congressmen.
2018 quirk: some of the GOP govs in best shape are in the bluest states (MD, MA, VT), while Dems are surprisingly competitive in some of the reddest (KS, OK, SD?).
This erases 11% of Balderson's lead, but margin still at 1,564 votes. We're still likely on pace for a triple digit Balderson margin when finalized. #OH12 https://t.co/lyXaH7LtDI

Update: so far in 2018 Dem House primaries featuring one man, one woman &amp; no incumbent on ballot, a woman has won 83/121 times (69%). On GOP side, just 12/35 times (34%).
A modest winner last night: NRCC Chair Rep. Steve Stivers. If Dems couldn't win #OH12 under ideal circumstances, hard to see how they compete in #OH15 (also PVI R+7, but wider Trump margin &amp; Stivers got 66% in '16).
New rating changes coming this PM to @CookPolitical:		#KS02: OPEN (Jenkins) (R) - Lean R to Toss Up	#KS03: Yoder (R) - Lean R to Toss Up	#NY27: Collins (R) - Solid R to Likely R	#OH15: Stivers (R) - Likely R to Solid R	#WA03: Herrera Beutler (R) - Likely R to Lean R
1) Dems don't have to win districts as Republican as #OH12 to win the House.	2) These tailwinds aren't media-driven, they're Trump-driven. https://t.co/VlQqtHxlsv
These should narrow Balderson (R)'s lead, but keep in mind, not all of them will be counted. O'Connor (D) would need a miracle. #OH12 https://t.co/vaJOI3RuvO
FWIW, #NY27 voted for Trump by 24% &amp; has a @CookPolitical PVI of R+11. Grand Island Supervisor Nate McMurray (D) had $81k on hand at the end of June. https://t.co/HlK5UPDwRV

Projection: Sharice Davids (D) wins Dem primary in #KS03, defeating Brent Welder (D). Faces off against Rep. Kevin Yoder (R) in the fall, who took just 68% in his primary. @CookPolitical rating will be moving from Lean R to Toss Up.
RT @daveweigel: I thought that Whitmer's ads had made the most use of the Michigan aaaaaccent but oh my https://t.co/CHdnU44n4J
This weird split is still possible in #MI13, although Tlaib (D) will win the full term. Would be 2nd time in last decade MI simultaneously elected two different candidates for partial &amp; full House terms. https://t.co/N1zQtdU0T4
Projection: Rashida Tlaib (D) wins #MI13 primary to replace former Rep. John Conyers (D), will become first Muslim woman in Congress (several possible).
Projection: Haley Stevens (D) &amp; Lena Epstein (R) win their primaries in #MI11, where Rep. Dave Trott (R) is retiring. @CookPolitical November rating: Toss Up.
So far tonight, in Dem House primaries featuring at least one man, one woman &amp; no incumbent on ballot, a woman has won 9/11 times (82%). On GOP side, 1/5 (20%).
To clarify, I meant Rs are the current incumbent party in all of these seats. Yes, Reichert (R) is retiring in #WA08.
Not making this up: in #WA02, Uncle Mover (R) is currently leading race to face Rep. Rick Larsen (D) in November. Last place: Stoney Bird (Green).
Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) allies shrug off 47.5% showing by noting 2 other Rs &amp; a "Trump Populist" party candidate on ballot combining for 5.4%. But still not a confidence-inspiring showing for 4th-ranking House R. #WA05
Meanwhile, four-term Rep. Kevin Yoder (R) is losing a non-trivial 33% of the GOP primary vote to token opponents. #KS03
We've got a close primary brewing in #KS03, where AOC/Sanders-backed Brent Welder (D) is ahead of EMILY's List-backed Sharice Davids (D) by 6% but a lot of pro-Davids Johnson Co. is still outstanding.
Projection: the Levin machine hangs on as Andy Levin (D) wins #MI09 Dem primary for his retiring father's seat over Ellen Lipton (D).
A Dem recruitment failure: #MI03. Rep. Justin Amash (R) sits in a CD where Trump took 52%. But nominee Cathy Albro (D) had $4k on hand in mid-July.
These are pretty dismal top-two primary numbers for Rs in WA. They're at 49.7% of major party votes in #WA03, 51.7% in #WA05 &amp; 48.6% in #WA08 (they're incumbents in all of them).
Meanwhile in #WA03, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R) leading Carolyn Long (D) just 41%-37% in first batch of returns. That's a bad sign for Rs in an R+3 CD Trump won 50%-43%.
In 2016, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R) showed softness in her base, taking just 42% in the #WA05 top-two primary &amp; losing 11% to a Tea Party R. So far tonight, she's leading Lisa Brown (D) by an unimpressive 48%-47%.
There are 68 R-held House seats less Republican than #OH12, per @CookPolitical PVI, and 119 less Republican than the #PA18 seat Dems won in March. Dems need to flip 23 to win House.
If anything, tonight's #OH12 result reinforces our view that Dems are substantial favorites to retake the House in November.
Projection: Steve Watkins (R) wins GOP primary to face Paul Davis (D) in #KS02. @CookPolitical will be moving November rating from Lean R to Toss Up.
You can call Troy Balderson (R) "Mr. 1%." May: defeats Leneghan (R) 29%-28% (btw, she would've lost). August: defeats O'Connor (D) 50%-49%. #OH12
Needless to say, this is not how it works. #OH12 https://t.co/Oehm9V6wrh
Remember these. #OH12 https://t.co/R55j2iWrOX
In the end, Franklin Co. cast impressive 35% of the #OH12 vote &amp; came thru big for O'Connor (D). Turnout was weak in heavily R rurals. But Balderson (R) held onto enough trad R suburbs in Delaware Co., likely thanks to Gov. Kasich (R).
Republicans deserve credit for hanging on here. But I've never seen one party go 8/9 in consecutive House special elections this unimpressively. #OH12
Projection: Troy Balderson (R) defeats Danny O'Connor (D) in #OH12 special, barring a tabulation error/provisionals we don't know about.

Projection: Matt Longjohn (D) wins Dem primary to face Rep. Fred Upton (R) in #MI06. @CookPolitical November rating: Likely R.
UPDATE...here's where Danny O'Connor (D) stands in each #OH12 county:		Delaware: 46%	Franklin: 65%	Licking: 39%	Marion: 32%	Morrow: 29%	Muskingum: 33%	Richland: 41% https://t.co/YZwVaxYJcq
To my eye, it looks like most of the remaining Delaware precincts are in Genoa Twp., which should be ok for O'Connor (D), but probably not enough to put it back in range of what provisionals could overcome. #OH12
Breaking: Balderson (R) expands lead to 1,685 votes (0.8%) w/ 152/159 Delaware precincts now in. That's *probably* the ballgame in #OH12.
Breaking: 26 precincts in Delaware Co. just reported, Balderson (R) retakes lead by 741 votes (0.4%). Still 28 precincts left there. We're in territory where provisional votes could matter. #OH12
Projection: Laura Kelly (D) wins Dem primary for #KSGOV.
In #KS04: Rep. Ron Estes (R) wins GOP primary, defeating Ron Estes (R).
O'Connor (D) retakes lead by 201 votes (0.1%) w/ 12 more Franklin Co. precincts in. But that's probably not enough to offset remaining Delaware Co. #OH12
If Troy Balderson (R) pulls this out, he'll have Gov. Kasich (R) to thank, not POTUS. Delaware Co. coming through for him, rural Trump base not. #OH12
Breaking: 23 more Delaware Co. precincts put Balderson (R) back in the lead by 1,031 votes (0.6%). That *may* be too much for O'Connor (D) to overcome in Franklin Co.'s remaining 13 precincts. #OH12
If Danny O'Connor (D) had Joe Manchick (G)'s 1,037 votes, it might be a different story right now. #OH12
Breaking: O'Connor (D) clinging to 155 vote lead w/ 172k ballots counted. Just 77 Delaware &amp; 13 Franklin Co. precincts remain. Extremely tight, would *maybe* rather be Balderson. #OH12
Franklin Co. is already at 57% of its raw 2016 turnout &amp; there are still 13 precincts left to count there. By comparison, the most R county (Morrow) is at just 46% of its 2016 turnout &amp; it's entirely reported. #OH12
Breaking: 6 more Franklin Co. precincts in. O'Connor (D) adds 1,892, Balderson (R) adds 1,054. O'Connor needed that. #OH12 still a total Toss Up w/ 81% in.

100% of Licking Co. now in, O'Connor at 38% there (we estimated he needed 42%). But turnout is only at 49% of '16 there, well under where Franklin Co. will be. #OH12
Breaking: O'Connor (D) takes 1,291 (0.8%) lead w/ 88% of Franklin Co. reporting. Delaware Co. burbs loom large, Balderson (R) may have ever-so-slight edge overall. #OH12
Breaking: Latest batch of 46 Franklin Co. precincts gives O'Connor (D) a 9,955-6,816 margin. That might *not* be good enough for him there. #OH12
We may not know tonight. "Barnburner" an appropriate term here. #OH12
Breaking: Licking Co. is now 96% reported and has put Balderson (R) in the lead by 1,838 votes (1.3%). But most of what's out is Columbus burbs. REALLY tight race at the moment. #OH12
UPDATE: can confirm many of the 25 Delaware precincts in are heavy R rural precincts like Radnor, Porter, Harlem, Concord Twps. Still awaiting most of Delaware's high-college burbs, which are better for O'Connor (D). #OH12 https://t.co/qHLMBvn2nJ
First 25 Delaware Co. E-Day precincts: Balderson (R) 3,954, O'Connor (D) 2,466. We don't know where in Delaware yet, but encouraging for Balderson. #OH12
Breaking: all of Morrow Co. is in. Balderson (R) wins it 70%-29%. We estimated he needed 69%, but same story as Marion Co.: turnout is at only 46% of '16, which is really weak rural R turnout.
Latest Franklin Co. batch: O'Connor (D) 9,104, Balderson (R) 6,196. That's actually a positive batch for Balderson. #OH12 still very much a Toss Up.
Here's what we know: O'Connor (D) exceeding his targets in Franklin Co., Balderson (R) exceeding his targets in Zanesville/Newark areas. Turnout in rurals relatively weak. Delaware Co. E-Day votes will decide this race. #OH12
Dems have to like the fact O'Connor (D) is hitting 64% of the *Election Day* vote in Franklin Co. so far. He won 80% of early ballots &amp; needs ~64% there overall. #OH12
The big question mark right now: Delaware County. #OH12
Breaking: all precincts are reporting in Marion Co. (smallest, most R county). Good news for Balderson (R): he won it 68%-31%. But the bad news for him: it's at only 41% of '16 turnout, which is *really* weak turnout there if those numbers are final.
Correction: Numbers just updated, O'Connor (D) got 31% there. BUT the real story is weak turnout among Rs there. More in next tweet. https://t.co/eu8H9PVa3t
Marion Co., the smallest in #OH12, is the first to finish reporting. Balderson (R) wins it 67%-32%. O'Connor (D) needed 32% there...that's what he got.
It's hard to lose $$ betting on a widening urban/rural divide this year. #OH12
Projection: Bill Schuette (R) wins GOP primary for #MIGOV.
Projection: Gretchen Whitmer (D) wins Dem primary for #MIGOV, defeating Abdul El-Sayed (D).
First 16 Franklin Co. E-Day precincts: O'Connor (D) 2,533, Balderson (R) 1,324. So far, both candidates are exceeding targets in their home bases. #OH12
15/45 Muskingum Co. precincts in, Balderson (R) up 64%-35% there. That's on par w/ Trump &amp; a pretty good number for him in his hometown. #OH12
First few E-Day precincts decent for O'Connor (D) in Richland Co. (Mansfield), where he only needs ~43%. But it's a racially polarized county, so need to see a lot more. #OH12
First few precincts in ruby red Morrow Co. looking decent for O'Connor (D). Still extremely early. #OH12
This baby is...far from over. #OH12 https://t.co/AZe86NrSHI
Our estimates said O'Connor (D) needed ~42% in Muskingum; he'll probably end up below that based on EV. But Balderson (R) was always going to get a hometown boost there (question was how much), so it's not a deal-breaker for O'Connor. Need to see *a lot* more precincts.
Early vote a good indicator of passion: Dems passionate in Columbus burbs, Balderson's friends/neighbors passionate in Zanesville. But it's not a good predictor of who will win #OH12.
Franklin Co. made up 38% of the #OH12 early vote. If Franklin casts at least 1/3 of the vote once everything's in, that would be a great share for O'Connor (D).
Early vote in #OH12 is entirely in: O'Connor (D) leads Balderson (R) 62.9%-36.4%. That's more or less what we expected. Keep in mind, this is 35k votes out of the 210k+ we expect total.
Balderson (R) wins Muskingum Co. early vote 61%-38%. That's a sign he's getting a good hometown bonus. O'Connor (D) will need to post big numbers in Delaware/Franklin to make up for it. #OH12
O'Connor (D) wins Richland Co. absentees 54%-45%. Balderson (R) wins Morrow Co. absentees 55%-45%. Nothing really unexpected so far. #OH12
Balderson wins Licking Co. early vote 50%-49%. So far doing 31% better there than in Franklin Co. We're looking at a *big* urban/rural divide tonight. #OH12
Remember: this is O'Connor's best batch of votes in the entire CD. His % will only go down from here...needs ~64% in Franklin Co. w/ all E-Day ballots in. #OH12 https://t.co/EvTfguBrlW

Keeping Delaware Co. close is the key for O'Connor (D) tonight. But keep in mind, it's not a monolith...part high-income burbs, part small town, part rural. #OH12
5 mins til polls close. Watching @SteveKornacki talk Mueller/Giuliani gossip but it's obvious he's itching to be breaking down key counties in #OH12.
@daveweigel Sounds a bit extreme. Leave some room for benchmarks for the next 100 specials
Of the 65 most at-risk House seats, 7 are what we'd call Urban/Rural divides, where this high/low dynamic poses risk for Rs. #OH12 is one of them; #WA05 (Spokane/McMorris Rodgers) is another. https://t.co/LszqUv2OCX https://t.co/ewWVLJT5dN
Both #OH12 and #PA18 highlight a danger for Rs: districts that combine high-education suburbs (where Dem energy is sky-high) w/ more rural Trump zones (where R energy is comparatively low).
Fact: there are 68 R-held House districts *less* Republican than #OH12, per @CookPolitical PVI (there are also 119 less R than the old #PA18, where Conor Lamb (D) won in March).
Huge Dem enthusiasm in TX’s professional burbs is a big threat to Rs at House &amp; state leg levels. But relative lack of Hispanic/non-white engagement still holding Beto back statewide.
This. The big story in TX this Nov. may be Dem breakthroughs in suburbs of Dallas/Houston/Austin etc., not an O’Rourke win in #TXSEN. https://t.co/YCQmDcyzJH
Keep in mind, O'Connor (D) only needs to carry 1/7 counties in #OH12 to win the district. Also keep in mind: there are no meaningful inferences to be drawn from early vote totals tonight.
Here's my latest estimate of what Danny O'Connor (D) needs in each #OH12 county to win today's special election (2-party vote share):		Delaware: 47%	Franklin: 64%	Licking: 42%	Marion: 32%	Morrow: 31%	Muskingum: 42%	Richland: 43%
If O'Connor (D) can't win today, though, it's really hard to see him winning in November. #OH12
Happy #OH12 special election day. It's a Toss Up, but a win/win for Dems. 		If Danny O'Connor (D) wins, terrible sign for Rs in R+7 seat. If Troy Balderson (R) wins, it'll be the *least* impressively we've ever seen one party go 8/10 in consecutive House specials.
Actually, Matt Morgan (D) will almost certainly appear on the fall ballot in #MI01 (I was in the district today &amp; saw tons of signs for his primary write-in bid). But Dems are *without* a nominee in #NC03. https://t.co/z5oyovgTfD

@TweedEsquire Huh?
Remember: in Nov. '17, virtually every R in Clinton-carried NoVa/Richmond delegate districts got crushed. But Dems fell just short in a lot of less elite, Trump-carried districts. 		IMHO that's a better indicator for '18 than the small sample of Trump CD House specials.
Hearing more talk about how D House gains *won't* be clustered in professional 'burbs, in part b/c they've impressed everywhere except #GA06.		Not sure that's right. There are ~20 white-collar R seats where Clinton did *better* than she did in #GA06. They could power Dems to 218.
Tomorrow's TN primaries highlight the House's growing gender gap. Reps. Diane Black (R) #TN06 &amp; Marsha Blackburn (R) #TN07 are running statewide &amp; will be replaced by men.		Overall, of the 23 R women in the House, 6 are leaving &amp; 6 more are at risk of losing to Dems in November.

A few positive developments for Rs in #OH12 homestretch:		1) Danny O'Connor (D) bungles Q on whether he'd vote for Pelosi	2) Anti-Trump Gov. Kasich (R), still popular here, agrees to cut ad for Troy Balderson (R)		These could be the difference in a tight race. We'll see on 8/7.
Would be mildly surprised if it’s anything other than a Balderson lead within MoE. But potential for Dem intensity edge is why @CookPolitical has had #OH12 in Toss Up since April. https://t.co/DvS8V9VEYk

To be sure, regionalism still matters a bit: a rural white voter in NH is much more likely to vote Dem than one in TX. 		But to say "regional cultures" outweigh divides in urban/rural, race &amp; education these days is the political geography equivalent of Flat Earthism.

Just b/c overperformance vs. Clinton has been larger in red/rural/working-class doesn't mean Dem gains won't be concentrated in high-income suburban seats. Dems don't need a big overperformance vs. Clinton to win a lot of them. https://t.co/JI2dijnJOr

And which party is living in more of a bubble? Notice that it depends on what threshold you set. At "most neighbors," it's the GOP. At "two thirds," it's Dems.
The growth of the "bubbles" is even more dramatic at the extremes: in 2016, 39% of Trump voters &amp; 42% of Clinton voters lived in precincts where more than *two thirds* of their neighbors voted the same way.		In 2012, just 32% of Romney voters &amp; 38% of Obama voters did.
@mike_klain The numbers from prior years would illustrate this even more drastically, but sadly I don’t have 100% complete data sets before ‘12.
By my math: in 2016, 72% of Trump voters &amp; 66% of Clinton voters lived in precincts where most of their neighbors voted the same way.		In 2012, 69% of Romney voters &amp; 65% of Obama voters did. That's how steadily America is sorting into like-minded bubbles. https://t.co/iiyCCJJng7

Today we're scheduled to sit down w/ our 82nd &amp; 83rd House candidates of the cycle. The @InsideElections crew has likely met as many/more. A few highlights to date:		- A Dem who's an avid oryx hunter	- A GOPer whose Olympic cycling nickname was "The Blade"	- A Dem w/ 36 tattoos
In many House races, public polling is sparse &amp; many important factors are difficult to quantify. That's why accurate House forecasting requires *both* 1) a grasp of data &amp; trends and 2) real conversations &amp; reporting.
Midterm PSA: Beware quant-only models that attempt to project individual House races. They're not going to tell you everything you need to know because, it turns out, *candidates still matter.*

UPDATE: so far in '18 Dem House primaries featuring at least one woman, one man &amp; no incumbent, women have won in 70/106 cases (66%). On GOP side, just 11/29 (38%).
It's a done deal: Lucy McBath (D) #GA06 &amp; Carolyn Bordeaux (D) #GA07 have won their runoffs. @CookPolitical ratings: #GA06 Lean R, #GA07 Likely R.
#GA06 looks like McBath's to lose right now. #GA07 a closer call.

To bookmark: here's what I'd estimate Danny O'Connor (D) needs in each #OH12 county to win the 8/7 special election (2-party vote share):		Franklin: 65%	Delaware: 48%	Licking: 41%	Richland: 41%	Muskingum: 41%	Morrow: 29%	Marion: 30%
Franklin Co. is just 1/7 counties in #OH12 (and just 28% of the district's population), but by our math it's the *only* county Danny O'Connor (D) needs to carry to beat Troy Balderson (R) &amp; win the seat.
Reminder: we're 15 days away from the #OH12 special election. Here's why @CookPolitical rates it a Toss Up: https://t.co/sbIK5N3zFW https://t.co/Tcbswcp8Vj

Early vote data in April's #AZ08 special was pretty meaningful because it was such an overwhelming share of overall votes cast.		That's *not* the case in #OH12, where some are prematurely inferring an enthusiasm edge for Danny O'Connor (D) from absentees cast/requested, etc.

@TiffanyBond There are literally thousands of candidates across the country who have worked really hard to get on the ballot. Sorry, but most of them *are* side notes. Too bad.
This week, @Amyewalter &amp; I sat down w/ 12 top Democratic House candidates for an hour each. Here were our takeaways (including some caution flags): https://t.co/7mFmQd5W8l
A few ways to look at it: if the 26 Toss Ups break evenly, Dems would net 19 seats, 4 short of majority. But if the 60 competitive seats (Lean/Toss Up) break evenly, Dems would net 28 seats, 5 more than they need.
Keep in mind, the 60 competitive seats in Lean/Toss Up don't include three R seats Dems are near-locks to pick up (#NJ02, #PA05, #PA06) &amp; one D seat GOP will pick up (#PA14). IOW, Dems net +2 seats off bat.

Yes, #PA01 voted for Hillary Clinton by 2%. But Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R) has endorsements from Gabby Giffords &amp; the AFL-CIO, and so far, Dems' nominee is a walking disaster. This house may be spared from the storm.
#PA01 proves why 1) good candidates matter as much as good maps and 2) purely quant models can't always predict House races well. 		By the election/$$$ numbers, this race should be a golden Dem opportunity. Instead, the Dem wave may skip over Bucks County, PA.

UPDATED w/ latest results: so far in '18, female candidates are overperforming by an average of 12.2% in Dem primaries vs. 4.8% in GOP primaries (graphic credit: @CookPolitical intern Jacob Link). https://t.co/Iqjc8kP0Gt
Right now, Dems are all kinds of excited about what taking over the House (I'd put odds at ~60%) would mean for governance.		In reality, managing a caucus that could include *both* pro-DSA Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez #NY14 &amp; Trump-voting Richard Ojeda #WV03 sounds...hard.
For those insistent that @Ocasio2018's triumph was all about progressivism vs. corporatism (and less about demographic contrast &amp; hustle), here's a reminder of some past Dem primary results in #NY14:		2014: Cuomo (D) 76%, Teachout (D) 24%	2016: Clinton (D) 58%, Sanders (D) 42%
This 65% on the Dem side is actually down from 71% before the 6/26 primaries. While Ocasio-Cortez dominated the headlines, women had a relatively mediocre night in Dem primaries/runoffs elsewhere.
UPDATE: so far in 2018 Dem House primaries featuring at least one woman, one man &amp; no incumbent, women have been the top vote-getters in 71/109 cases (65%). On GOP side, 11/29 (38%).		This doesn't even include Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's upset in #NY14.
That Dems didn't overperform '16 by much (if at all) in Saturday's #TX27 special isn't all that surprising. 		Which demographic group is most likely to drop off in off years vs. presidentials? Latinos (2nd only to 18-29). Who are Dems' base in Corpus Christi? Latinos.
Another aspect getting less attention than it should: vast majority of critical '18 races taking place in swingy/suburban districts. But safe seats like #NY14 are going to have an awful big say re: whom Dems nominate in '20.
Ironically, I think the #NY14 result says much more about the kind of profile that would excite the Dem base in '20 than it does about other '18 House primaries/races, where virtually all other incumbents will win.
Besides, in convos w/ labor Dems in Howard Co., IA (only place that voted for Obama &amp; Trump by 20%+, 98% white), barely heard about Russia/latest POTUS tweets/scandals. Top 3 refrains?		1) Get big $ out of politics	2) Medicare for all	3) Tax wealthy more		https://t.co/TxFYMyExUf
Lots of warnings Dems risk falling off a socialist cliff. But let's say @Ocasio2018 were eligible to run in '20. Would Ds be better off w/ her or say...Biden? To me, not that close a call.		Outsider/insider &amp; idgaf/canned now matter more to voters than ideology (see '16 result).

IMHO, the viral &amp; accelerated nature of today's politics means there's a real chance the 2020 Dem nominee will be someone virtually no one's talking about right now.
After watching @Ocasio2018 become her party's biggest star overnight, it's plain to see what Dems desperately crave (need?) in '20: a young, charismatic woman w/ working-class street cred &amp; a powerful story.		But here's their problem: who of constitutional age fits that bill?

To clarify, source says about 80% of the ~4.5k outstanding in #CA48 are provisionals (which favor Rouda) and 20% are vote by mail (which favor Keirstead). Rouda still favored but not by much.
Now hearing most #CA48 provisionals have already been counted b/c OC registrar is counting #CA48 first. About 4.5k #CA48 ballots left will be counted tmw. Headed for a tight finish, margin likely under 100.
As expected, provisionals coming in big for Harley Rouda (D) in #CA48. With 1/5 of them counted, he’s cut Hans Keirstead (D)’s vote lead from 335 to 114. Still on pace to advance.

Projection: Corey Stewart (R) wins the GOP nomination for #VASEN, defeating Nick Freitas (R). @CookPolitical fall rating: Solid D.
Corey Stewart (R) lost the #VAGOV primary by a point in '17. He may win the #VASEN primary by a point in '18. This is the new direction of the VA GOP.
With 23/29 precincts in Alexandria, VA counted:		Justin Wilson (D) 7,569	Allison Silberberg (D) 7,177		Going down to the wire, Wilson w/ slight edge vs. incumbent.
Comstock (R) is TRAILING Hill (R) in Frederick Co., the GOP bedrock of #VA10. Not a good sign of enthusiasm for her for fall vs. Wexton (D).
Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) is up 59%-41% vs. Shak Hill (R) in #VA10 w/ 78% reporting. That's astonishingly weak for this two-term incumbent.
Corey Stewart (R) takes 2,037 vote lead (0.8%) vs. Nick Freitas (R) w/ 91% reporting. Math getting a bit harder for Freitas now. #VASEN GOP.
Rep. Mark Sanford (R) currently trails Katie Arrington (R) 2,267 to 2,224 in early #SC01 count, per @DecisionDeskHQ. Long way to go here.
With PWC absentees back in the mix, Stewart (R) lead back up to 1,375 (0.5%) w/ 90% reporting. He might have tiny edge at this point.
Updated AP count: Stewart (R) leads by 382 votes (0.1%) over Freitas (R) w/ 90% precincts reporting. Anyone's guess in #VASEN GOP.
Breaking: Stewart (R) takes 1,109 vote lead (0.4%) over Freitas (R) w/ all of Prince William reporting. Lots of Stewart-friendly Fairfax still out. Freitas better hope for a lot of help from remaining downstate precincts.
VA board of elections site has Freitas (R) lead over Stewart (R) down to 312 votes w/ 88% reporting. #VASEN
Del. Nick Frietas (R) lead vs. Corey Stewart (R) down to 1.2% w/ 84% reporting. Bulk of outstanding precincts friendly to Stewart. Total coin flip. #VASEN
Alexandria, VA update: Justin WIlson (D) takes 53%-47% lead over Mayor Allison Silberberg (D) w/ 48% counted. Looking grim for the incumbent.
But Silberberg's best precinct, City Hall (anti-development voters), has already reported. So we could be looking at a slight Wilson edge.
We've got a nailbiter in the Alexandria, VA mayor's race, w/ Councilman Justin Wilson (D) leading Mayor Allison Silberberg (D) 3,214 to 3,204 w/ 38% counted.
In #VASEN GOP, Del. Nick Freitas (R) leads Corey Stewart (R) 45%-43% w/ 72% reporting. But still not much from Fairfax/PWC, Stewart's base. Just like Stewart's #VAGOV primary last year, this thing is going down to the wire.
Lesson from tonight's #VA10 Dem primary: when you're endorsed by WaPo &amp; Gov. Ralph Northam in NoVa, it's pretty hard to lose.
Lindsey Davis Stover (D) turning in some impressive %s in Winchester &amp; Manassas areas, now on track to come in 3rd in #VA10. But Wexton (D) is just destroying competition in Loudoun &amp; Fairfax (represents both in state sen).
Right now, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) &amp; Dem nominee Jennifer Wexton (D) leading their primaries by about same amount: 23%. Wexton's margin will shrink a bit, but a real sign of weakness for Comstock. #VA10
Wexton (D) even takes first Fairfax Co. precinct to report 263-187 over Friedman (D). Icing on the cake for her primary victory. #VA10
In the *unlikely* event #SC01 GOP primary goes to a runoff, Trump's 3-hours-before-polls-close endorsement of Arrington (R) could matter after all. https://t.co/3b7Sy966Za
Projection: Elaine Luria (D) has defeated Karen Mallard (D) in #VA02 primary to take on Rep. Scott Taylor (R). @CookPolitical fall rating: Lean R.
Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) lead over Shak Hill (R) just 62%-38% w/ nearly half of #VA10 precincts counted, per @DecisionDeskHQ.
#VA10 runner up: Alison Friedman (D), who moved from DC to VA last year to run &amp; self-funded $1 million. Dan Helmer (D) likely 3rd.
Projection: state Sen. Jennifer Wexton (D) wins #VA10 primary to take on Rep. Barbara Comstock (R), perhaps most vulnerable GOP incumbent in country.
Looks like Jennifer Wexton (D) is poised for a rout in #VA10 primary. That means Dems will have nominated women in 4/4 of VA's vulnerable GOP seats.
Projection: Abigail Spanberger (D) has defeated Dan Ward (D) for #VA07 nomination to take on Rep. Dave Brat (R). @CookPolitical rating: Lean R.
In #VASEN GOP primary, we've got a close one between Corey Stewart (46%) &amp; Del. Nick Freitas (44%) so far.
Meanwhile on R side, #VA10 Rep. Barbara Comstock (R) leads Shak Hill (R) 63%-37% w/ 12/97 Loudoun precincts reporting. Comfortable, but VERY unimpressive so far.
With 13/97 Loudoun precincts in, Wexton (D) extends #VA10 lead over Friedman (D) to 2,036 to 915, per @DecisionDeskHQ. No surprise here.
Breaking: first 4 precincts from #VA10 give Jennifer Wexton (D) a nearly 2-1 lead over Alison Friedman (D), no one else remotely close. Q is whether that's from within her state sen. district or not.
@Jewelyn4ACPS Why not!
Polls close in a few minutes in VA. Favorites in key Dem House primaries include Elaine Luria (#VA02), Abigail Spanberger (#VA07) &amp; Jennifer Wexton (#VA10). But are we in for any surprises?

#CA48 update: Keirstead (D) extends lead over Rouda (D) to 372 votes, but still no E-Day provisionals counted, which should strongly favor Rouda.
@SteveKornacki That's likely because the first ballots counted post-election were the small batch of older mail ballots, which lean R. The huge batches of provisionals &amp; E-Day drop-offs still to count much likelier to lean D.
@SteveKornacki Steve, correct me if I'm wrong but I think that's because the post-election updates have been from the GOP counties of #CA21 (Kings, Fresno) rather than the Dem county (Kern)
This is a good explanation for why Rep. Pete Sessions (#TX32) may be more vulnerable than Rep. Will Hurd (#TX23) or why Rep. Mimi Walters (#CA45) might be more vulnerable than Rep. David Valadao (#CA21).
Why is the 2018 "Blue Wave" most powerful in suburban districts w/ lots of female college grads but less threatening to Rs in districts w/ lots of young/Latino voters? Look no further (h/t @CarrieNBCNews): https://t.co/JiLKlGMlhb
Also odd that her intro ad doesn't more prominently highlight her background as a prosecutor or endorsements from Gov. Northam/Washington Post, credentials that distinguish her in a crowded #VA10 Dem field.
State Sen. Jennifer Wexton (D) is still the fave in tomorrow's #VA10 Dem primary, but this is a strange ad. Let alone the "fake cops" snafu (since edited out), it's oddly upbeat for a Dem base that's pretty angry about guns/Trump.	https://t.co/xNXgH92yPm
Might as well go full sociopath here: I also really enjoy top-two primaries. There, I said it. *hides in corner*
Confess your unpopular opinion: I really enjoy CA’s slothlike vote count.
Despite his 20 vote lead, I don’t really see a path for Keirstead (D) in #CA48. Based on what we know about what’s out, fairly confident it’ll be Rouda (D) vs. Rohrabacher (R).

#CA48 Update: more mail ballots put Hans Keirstead (D) back up over Harley Rouda (D) by 45 votes. But via an OC source, there are ~55k votes left to count, and ~2/3 of them are E-Day drop-off ballots, which *should* favor Rouda. They likely won't start counting them til Friday.
To clarify, late counting has Dems in 3rd place in #CA08, held by Rep. Paul Cook (R). But it's a Solid R seat &amp; more counting could still put Marge Doyle (D) back in top two.
@miss_alden Solid Dem
Here's how we'd rank/rate CA's Dem targets after last night:		#CA49: OPEN (R): Lean D (was Toss Up)	#CA25: Knight (R): Toss Up	#CA48: Rohrabacher (R): Toss Up	#CA39: OPEN (R): Toss Up	#CA10: Denham (R): Toss Up	#CA45: Walters (R): Lean R	#CA21: Valadao (R): LIkely R (was Lean R)
Here's how we rate/rank NJ's Dem pickup opportunities following last night:		#NJ02: OPEN (R) - Likely D (was Lean D)	#NJ11: OPEN (R) - Lean D (was Toss Up)	#NJ07: Rep. Leonard Lance (R) - Toss Up	#NJ03: Rep. Tom MacArthur (R) - Lean R		We'll have more at @CookPolitical soon.
In #MTAL Dem primary, state Rep. Kathleen Williams raised just $286,000 but still defeated John Heenan ($968,000) and Grant Kier ($772,000).
Meanwhile, so far in 2018 GOP primaries w/ at least one woman, one man &amp; no incumbent on the ballot, women have won the most votes 8/21 times (38%).		BUT, GOP women did have a terrific night last night, winning 5/7 of these races, including in competitive #CA39, #CA49 &amp; #NM02.
I've never seen anything quite like it: so far in 2018 Dem primaries w/ at least one woman, one man &amp; no incumbent on the ballot, women have won the most votes 59/84 times (70%).
This is very helpful to get a sense of how much D/R %s can change between June and November in CA. Typically, Dems do better in Nov., particularly in outer burbs. https://t.co/VcuM7wLk7g
The only exception may be Valadao (R) in #CA21, who is currently 25% ahead of Cox (D). But even there, primary turnout was abysmal and Cox hasn’t had to start communicating because he didn’t have any top-two concerns.
Remember: the raging Bernie/Hillary contest inflated Dem %s in ‘16 CA primaries. Ordinarily, CA primaries skew quite R. Last night’s R % majorities in Dem target districts don’t really change my priors (and they’re far from final).
Keep in mind: not only is it too early to draw conclusions about party %s from primary (still lots to count), Nov. electorate will be more Dem than primary. https://t.co/DqFNHbk8oI
BTW, #CA25 has been my top pick for most fascinating district to watch this cycle. ICYMI, here's some background on the race from February: https://t.co/JEvFOQbFAz
Projection: in #CA25, Katie Hill (D) has advanced to November vs. Rep. Steve Knight (R), defeating '16 nominee Bryan Caforio (D). @CookPolitical rating: Toss Up, but in this political climate, it should be Hill's to lose.
Republicans have to love numbers in #CA21, where Rep. David Valadao (R) is out-polling T.J. Cox (D) 63%-37% in a CD Hillary Clinton won by 15%.
Breaking: Dems get a little more breathing room in latest #CA10 vote update.		Josh Harder (D): 9,635	Ted Howze (R): 8,826		Harder's lead just grew from 608 to 809. Lockout odds decrease.
CA districts where one party will *not* appear on fall ballot, as results stand now:		GOP: 10/53	Dems: 0/53
RT @LarrySabato: Thanks, Dave. Now, if I could just be rid of the MyPillow guy... https://t.co/atGprk3Rgq
#CA25 Update: Katie Hill (D) extends lead over Bryan Caforio (D) to 732 votes:		Steve Knight (R): 30,375	Katie Hill (D): 11,230	Bryan Caforio (D): 10,498		Not sure how Caforio makes up that deficit at this point.
Worth noting that Josh Harder (D)'s lead over Ted Howze (R) for 2nd slot in #CA10 continues to shrink slightly w/ E-Day counting. Too soon to say with certainty that Dems have avoided a shutout here:		Jeff Denham (R): 22,272	Josh Harder (D): 9,014	Ted Howze (R): 8,406
#CA49 Projection: Mike Levin (D) advances to November election vs. Diane Harkey (R). Both parties avert shutout. @CookPolitical rating will move from Toss Up to Lean D.
BREAKING: Harley Rouda (D) overtakes Hans Keirstead (D) for 2nd November slot in #CA48 by 70 (!) votes:		Dana Rohrabacher (R): 31,790	Harley Rouda (D): 18,129	Hans Keirstead (D): 18,059	Scott Baugh (R): 16,890
UPDATE: Katie Hill (D) expands lead over Bryan Caforio (D) in #CA25 to 513 votes w/ more E-Day counted:		Katie Hill (D): 10,535	Bryan Caforio (D): 10,022
Hill (D) beat Caforio (D) 2,016 to 1,350 in Ventura Co.'s E-Day votes, which is a pretty good sign for Hill re: outstanding LA Co. E-Day votes.
Projection: in #CA50, Ammar Campa-Najjar (D) advances vs. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R). DCCC's preferred candidate, Josh Butner (D), currently in 4th.
BREAKING: Katie Hill (D) has taken the lead over Bryan Caforio (D) in #CA25 w/ new Ventura Co. votes.		Katie Hill (D): 9,250	Bryan Caforio (D): 9,018
Still a lot of counting to do, but my hunch is we're looking at Rohrabacher (R) vs. Rouda (D) in #CA48, w/ @DCCC support switch making the difference. https://t.co/q4Y11tFNcZ
I think it's gonna be Rouda in #CA48.
Moreover, some of their stronger general election candidates (Hill in #CA25, Rouda in #CA48, Levin in #CA49) still have fighting shots to advance based on the numbers I'm seeing.
Dems have to be pretty happy w/ CA results right now: they look like they'll avert shutouts in EVERY target district (albeit very narrowly in several).
In #CA25, Katie Hill (D) catching up to Bryan Caforio (D) quickly in Election Day vote. Leads 1,672 to 1,347 w/ LA E-Day w/ 81/251 precincts reporting, still needs to make up 333 vote deficit. Looks pretty doable.
Dems currently pulling 50.6% of primary votes in #CA49 (and likely to go higher in late counting), a pretty good omen of their fall chances for a pickup there.
Breaking: Scott Baugh (R) now looking likely to come in 4th place in #CA48. Race for 2nd likely coming down to Hans Keirstead (D) &amp; Harley Rouda (D).
Projection: in #CA45, Katie Porter (D) advances to November vs. Rep. Mimi Walters (R). @CookPolitical rating: Lean R.
Projection: Dem lockout averted in #CA39 as Gil Cisneros (D) advances to November vs. Young Kim (R). @CookPolitical rating: Toss Up.
Let me explain the #CA48 mystery. Right now, here are Orange Co.'s reported absentees by state Senate district for Keirstead/Baugh/Rouda:		#SD36: 2,296 / 1,929 / 1,527	#SD37: 5,024 / 4,971 / 4,553		But now take a look at:		#SD34: 5,065 / 4,964 / 2,007		That makes zero sense.
And that's not even taking into account a likely tabulation error that could be costing Rouda 2k votes. https://t.co/SvKVql1Qjl
@ElectProject @DemJasonPaul It's Election Day vote, not a glitch fix.
I'd still guess Katie Hill (D) has a shot to catch up to Bryan Caforio (D) in #CA25, given that she started off w/ lower name ID &amp; could do better w/ late ballots.
Breaking: Harley Rouda (D) still has a good shot at moving into 2nd place vs. Dana Rohrabacher (R) in #CA48 based on what we're seeing from E-Day votes.
Projection: state Sen. Kevin de Leon (D) advances to November election vs. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) in #CASEN. Republicans locked out.
If you gave Harley Rouda (D) an extra 2,000 votes (our best estimate of what he's missing), he'd bump Scott Baugh (R) into 4th place in #CA48. This possible tabulation error is a big deal.
The plot thickens! Here's the evidence: if you go through the #CA48 detailed report, Rouda's numbers in #SD34 are inexplicably low vs. #SD36 &amp; #SD37. Very unlikely attributable to geographic variance. https://t.co/JcqRg0VHkF
BREAKING: hearing word of a possible tabulation error in Orange Co. that could be costing Harley Rouda (D) ~2,000 votes in #CA48. If confirmed, we'd have a very tight race for 2nd between Keirstead (D), Baugh (R) &amp; Rouda (D).
On NYT site, #CA10 looks like a top-two danger for Dems, but once you add in San Joaquin's votes, Harder (D) has more breathing room over Howze (R).
Now, are Dems getting the best/most ideal general election nominees in these CA districts? That's less clear. But beggars can't be choosers.
Lots of foaming at the mouth on networks right now re: potential for CA Dem lockouts. At the moment, #CA48 is in question, but to me the likeliest scenario looks like zero lockouts.
Breaking: updated #CA10 results w/ San Joaquin Co. first batch added:		Jeff Denham (R) 15,870	Josh Harder (D) 6,081	Ted Howze (R) 5,318		To my eye, a Dem lockout here still looks pretty unlikely.
The next member from #NM02 will be a woman: Xochitl Torres Small (R) &amp; Yvette Herrell (R) win their primaries. @CookPolitical rating: Lean R.
Rep. Devin Nunes (R) has increased his lead over Andrew Janz (D) to 58%-32% in #CA22 w/ Tulare Co. first batch in. Dems were hoping for a closer margin.
Breaking: updated #CA25 numbers w/ LA/Ventura first batches:		Steve Knight (R) 54.9%	Bryan Caforio (D) 19.9%	Katie Hill (D) 17.7%		Should be close fight between Caforio &amp; Hill as more ballots counted.
Breaking: updated #CA39 results w/ LA/Orange/SB first batches:		Young Kim (R): 9,656	Gil Cisneros (D): 6,060	Phil Liberatore (R): 4,577		Looks quite likely Kim/Cisneros will advance &amp; Dems will avoid shutout.
If past is prologue, CA ballots will skew more Dem as counting goes on. That's decent news for Dems hoping to avert lockouts in #CA10, #CA39 &amp; #CA48.
In #CA04, another Dem long shot, Jessica Morse (D) looks like the early favorite to take on Rep. Tom McClintock (R). So far:		Tom McClintock (R): 51%	Jessica Morse (D): 19%	Regina Bateson (D): 15%
#CA08: A long shot for Dems, but Marge Doyle (D) currently in 3rd place behind ultra-right Tim Donnelly (R) after raising $398,000 to take on Rep. Paul Cook (R).		Paul Cook (R): 44%	Tim Donnelly (R): 21%	Marge Doyle (D): 19%
Breaking: close three-way race for 2nd place in San Diego Co. #CA50, where Rep. Duncan Hunter (R) is under federal grand jury investigation.		Duncan Hunter (R) 47.6%	Ammar Campa-Najjar (D) 15.5%	Josh Butner (D) 13.8%	Bill Wells (R) 13.4%
Breaking: actor Antonio Sabato, Jr. (R) in danger of getting locked out of the top-two in #CA26. Also breaking: @LarrySabato is still the best Sabato. https://t.co/yIFq5EwdMP
Breaking: Dems narrowly averting top-two shutout for time being in #CA10. It could get even closer.		Jeff Denham (R) 38.3%	Josh Harder (D) 15.1%	Ted Howze (R) 13.5%	Sue Zwahlen (D) 10.8%	Michael Eggman (D) 10.1%
Breaking in #CA25: Katie Hill (D) &amp; Bryan Caforio (D) TIED In Ventura Co. first batch:		Steve Knight (R): 4,871	Katie Hill (D): 1,719	Bryan Caforio (D): 1,719
Breaking: #CA22 Rep. Devin Nunes (R) leads Andrew Janz (D) 56%-34% in first batch of Fresno votes. About what we'd expect. @CookPolitical rating: Solid R.
Breaking: shutout averted in #CA49. Orange &amp; San Diego first batch votes:		Harkey (R) 16,471	Levin (D) 11,189	Jacobs (D) 10,288	Applegate (D) 8,956		No one else with a chance.
Dems currently making the #CA48 top-two runoff by just 0.7% at the moment w/ non-DCCC preferred candidate Hans Keirstead (D). Meanwhile, *withdrawn* Dem candidates currently combining for 5.6%.
RT @Nate_Cohn: Not quite the early vote that Democrats were hoping for in CA-48. A Dem is in second, yes, but barely and not the DCCC prefe…
Breaking #CA45 first batch:		Mimi Walters (R) 54%	Katie Porter (D) 20%	Dave Min (D) 17%		No shutout risk for Dems here, but Porter/Min too close to call.
Breaking #CA49 (Orange Co. portion) first batch:		Diane Harkey (R) 32%	Mike Levin (D) 19%	Sara Jacobs (D) 12%	Doug Applegate (D) 8%		Harkey looks like she's assured a runoff slot. Need to see San Diego.
Breaking #CA48 first batch:		Dana Rohrabacher (R) 30%	Hans Keirstead (D) 19%	Scott Baugh (R) 18%	Harley Rouda (D) 15%		This could be a close one, esp. if Dem E-Day votes skew Rouda.
Breaking: #CA39 (Orange Co. portion) first batch:		Young Kim (R) 29%	Gil Cisneros (D) 16%	Phil Liberatore (R) 12%	Shawn Nelson (R) 9%	Andy Thorburn (D) 8%		Dems breathe slight sigh of relief.

It's quite possible Republicans will have zero federal officeholders from North Jersey post-2018. Can't remember a time that was the case.

Another reason why #CA39 may now be Dems' biggest lockout fear: a drive to recall state Sen. Josh Newman (D) over his gas tax vote in overlapping #SD29 is helping turn out far more GOP voters than Dems.

Another big problem for Dems in #CA39 is that their base there is dominated by non-white &amp; young voters who despise Trump but turn out at much lower rates than white &amp; older voters in primaries.
The irony: Trump lost #CA39 by the most out of all 4 Clinton/GOP districts in Orange County, but it might still be home to the highest share of primary voters who still think of themselves as Republicans.
In #CA39, Dem voters seem genuinely conflicted between two unsympathetic millionaire front-runners (Cisneros/Thorburn) and others w/ less $$ (Tran/Jammal). Gives GOPers (Kim, Nelson, maybe Huff) a chance to finish in top two in a CD Trump lost by 8%.
Democrats' greatest top-two shutout risk in CA might now be #CA39, inching past #CA48 (where Baugh (R) has faded). And Harkey (R) surge in #CA49 gives Dems (Applegate, Levin or Jacobs) a better chance of moving on there.

Had all Dems on the ballot received the same % (regardless of gender), women would've collectively averaged 39% across these 65 mixed-gender House primaries. In reality, they've averaged 54%. 		In other words, so far there's a "gender bonus" of ~15% for women in Dem primaries.

So far, GOP House members seeking statewide office are 2/6 in '18 primaries. Should be a bit of a warning to the other 7 House Rs running statewide.
There are currently zero women representing PA in the House. After last night there could be four Dem women from metro Philly alone (Dean, Scanlon, Houlahan, Wild)
Not that great a night for several former Republicans running in Dem primaries (Brad Ashford in #NE02, Rachel Reddick in #PA01)
Now clear that #PA05 is going to come down to Rich Lazer (D) vs. Mary Gay Scanlon (D), w/ Philly for Lazer &amp; DelCo for Scanlon. Too close to call.
State Rep. Madeleine Dean (D) looks like the next member of Congress from MontCo's #PA04. Would end PA's all-male congressional delegation (and likely will be joined by at least one other).
Even though Philadelphia makes up less than a fifth of new #PA05's population, Deputy Mayor Rich Lazer (D) could break through in 10-way field if he runs up the score there. Currently up by 50% in Philly vs. nearest opponent.
There's gonna be a huge freshman class out of PA, w/ no incumbents on ballot in 7/18 House districts. Tonight determines who emerges.

@NateSilver538 @NickRiccardi Do I dare ask you about a turnout bonus? ;)

RT @amyewalter: If the Dems are doing so great, why don't they have a bigger lead on the generic ballot? 	Here's my attempt to explain it.…
@Barnes_Law @CookPolitical An R+13 PVI means a GOP candidate should get 63% in a neutral environment. Lesko got 52%. 11% Dem overperformance.
There's a lot of talk about what could get in Dems' way between now and Nov., but less about how much worse things could get for GOP.		In my mind, #AZ08 outcome raises the slight chance this thing could turn into a 1974/Watergate-style wipeout in the House.
@Jonatha99037619 Emerson was quite wrong that Dems were headed for a "surprise upset in the desert." The EV never suggested what the margin would be, but it did point to a normal enough electorate to assure a Lesko win - and that's what happened.
Next big problem for Rs: #OH12 special on 8/7. 1/3 of the vote is Franklin Co. (Columbus) &amp; Trump lost that area by 18% in '16 (only won CD w/ 53% overall).
Not an unreasonable guess as to how registrants broke down. FWIW, I still believe the 21% R early vote edge was a meaningful indicator turnout was "normal" enough for #AZ08 to be out of reach for Dems, even if only by a few points. https://t.co/IIZVqSt6Ee
Lesko (R)'s margin is now smaller than Joe Arpaio (R)'s was when he carried #AZ08 by 5.0% while losing Maricopa County by 13% (and he would've gone down in flames in a statewide race).
New batch of #AZ08 drop-off ballots counted today:		Tipirneni (D) 4,453	Lesko (R) 4,109		That brings Lesko's margin down to 4.8%. No excuses for Rs.
If the only data point you had to go on was last night's #AZ08 result, you'd think a 30-40 seat Dem House gain in Nov. would be way low.
If you discard #ALSEN as a special case, Dems' House overperformances have been remarkably consistent: all in the 6%-12% range. What's the PVI of the next special in #OH12 on 8/7? R+7. A big problem for Rs.
To win the House, Dems need an average overperformance of 4% vs. @CookPolitical PVI. Here's their overperformance in the past 8 specials:		#KS04: 12%	#MTAL: 8%	#GA06: 6%	#SC05: 7%	#UT03: 6%	#ALSEN: 15%	#PA18: 11%	#AZ08: 11%
New batch of 9k #AZ08 votes just in: 		Tipirneni (D) 4,588	Lesko (R) 4,408		It's all about margin now. Down to 5.2%.
One seat that should newly worry House GOP is Rep. Dave Schweikert (R)'s #AZ06, which voted for Trump by just 9.9% (vs. 20.7% in #AZ08).
RT @SteveKornacki: First batch of same day:	Tiperneni (D) 1,073 55%	Lesko (R) 878 45%		Remember Tiperneni needs 63% of what's left. We thin…
There are 147 GOP-held House seats less Republican than #AZ08. It's time to start rethinking how many of those are truly safe in November.
In '16, Joe Arpaio (R) carried #AZ08 by 5.0% despite losing his job by 11% county-wide. It's possible Debbie Lesko (R)'s final margin tonight could be even smaller. We'll see.
In a special with relatively unremarkable candidates in an R+13 seat, Dems appear to have hit at least 47%. Only 92 of the House GOP's 240 seats have a @CookPolitical PVI score more Republican than #AZ08.
Dems are still extremely unlikely to capture #AZ08 tonight. But Hiral Tipirneni (D)'s 47%+ showing is absolutely consistent w/ Dems on track to take back the House or win a statewide AZ race.
The average Dem overperformance vs. Cook PVI in the 7 special elections so far: 9%. Tipirneni currently overperforming by 10%, and could be more when E-Day ballots are counted. #AZ08
Early votes in #AZ08 (likely 3/4 of all ballots):		Debbie Lesko (R) 82,294 (53%)	Hiral Tipirneni (D) 73,188 (47%)		Lesko's got this, but a 6% margin in an R+13 seat is *terrible* for GOP.

Think of #AZ08 this way: its @CookPolitical PVI score is R+13. #PA18 is R+11, AL is R+14. In other words, Hiral Tipirneni (D) would need to be more of a rock star than Conor Lamb, or Debbie Lesko (R) would need to be Roy Moore-level toxic, for Dems to prevail. Both...unlikely.
Because mail ballots make up an overwhelming share of the vote in #AZ08 (maybe 80%) whereas they're tiny shares of the vote in states like MI, PA, WI, etc. https://t.co/vJHvi6tAfq
A GOP loss in #AZ08 would be genuinely shocking. That said, a good showing for Hiral Tipirneni (D) might be 43%+. That'd be consistent w/ Dems on track to take back House or win a statewide AZ race.
Happy #AZ08 Election Day! Reminder to people hyping this as a coin flip: Rs have a 17% voter reg advantage &amp; lead by 21% (!) among the 154k who mailed in ballots so far (likely 3/4 of total vote). A case where actual voter data &gt; polls.

What's a good showing for Hiral Tipirneni (D) in #AZ08 on Tuesday? Probably 43%-47%. Really anything above ~41% in #AZ08 (R+13 PVI) would be consistent w/ Dems on track to win the House or a statewide AZ race.

@afshop All years using current locations.
Stay tuned to @CookPolitical this morning for 7 House rating changes in light of new FEC reports.
By contrast, there are only 5 Dem-held seats where the top R outraised the top D in the last quarter. @CookPolitical will be publishing both lists today.
New House FEC reports: there are at least 60 GOP-held seats where the leading D outraised leading R in the last quarter -- more than twice the 23 Dems need to win House.
Another red flag in the Emerson poll: 64% of their sample was college+. Share of the voting age population in #AZ08 w/ at least a college degree: 28%.
The main reason I'm skeptical of Emerson poll showing dead heat in #AZ08: only 51% of their sample is 55+. With 139k ballots already cast (likely 2/3 of total vote), median voter age is 68.
Any special election for Dent's seat would be held under old #PA15 lines (R+4), not new #PA07 (D+1), potentially setting up a scenario where Rs win a lame duck term &amp; Ds win full term -- IF special takes place in November. https://t.co/o8fBlvXqpz
What we know about #AZ08: 128k ballots have already been cast (likely over 60% of all votes), w/ R registrants leading 48.8%-27.6%. Median voter age: 68. Emerson poll doesn't change our outlook.

Stay tuned to @CookPolitical this AM for 13 House rating changes.
Fun fact about #WV03 (where POTUS spoke today &amp; where Trump-voting Richard Ojeda (D) is running for an open seat): it still retains a 50%-27% Dem voter registration edge, despite voting 73%-23% (!) for Trump in '16.
RT @ForecasterEnten: A conspiracy theory is a conspiracy theory no matter who says it.
Btw, if a statewide Dem candidate were pulling 43%-45% in #AZ08, they'd probably be on their way to victory.
Considering #AZ08 has a @CookPolitical PVI of R+13 (meaning an R typically gets 63% of the vote), a good showing for Hiral Tipirneni (D) might be 43-45%.
So far, 68% of the 55k #AZ08 early voters are 65+ years of age and 85% are 55+, w/ a median age of 71. This will drop on Election Day (4/24), but still explains a big part of why GOP are the heavy favorites in this special. https://t.co/XCY5YBK0yR
Rather than "the details will all get worked out later" after a SCOTUS ruling vs. partisan gerrymandering, I want to hear more specifics from reformers on how clear &amp; precise standards *could* be worked out.
Many proposed tests to detect partisan gerrymandering (such as Breyer's) sound great. But they're so vague that in practice, they could unleash a flood of claims without giving lower courts necessary guidance to navigate them. https://t.co/RyZMpQgc7b
Nonetheless, if SCOTUS does break new ground, this type of approach strikes me as a likelier outcome based on oral arguments than a math formula or something more drastic like mandatory independent commissions (which might produce better maps &amp; save courts future hassle).
Recommended thread on principles (rather than mathematical formulas) SCOTUS could adopt to detect &amp; outlaw partisan gerrymandering. However, "not easy" nor will "people will 100% agree" strike me as severe understatements.👇 https://t.co/bxXdvgueI3
@mcpli Perhaps I should've said "bright line" rather than "explicit." If you believe it can be done with principles rather than formulas, I'd love to hear the specific principles/tests you see as judicially manageable.
I've yet to hear a clear articulation of how the Efficiency Gap could be uniformly applied to approve/reject a proposed map. What election data would be used? What's the threshold? What's gerrymandering vs. geography? But curious to hear your ideas for how SCOTUS should proceed.
Don't necessarily agree w/ this column's conclusion, but I've heard several well-intentioned reformers suggest that SCOTUS outlaw partisan gerrymandering w/o spelling out an explicit standard. That's a recipe for years of legal chaos at all levels.
The debate over partisan gerrymandering would be better served by less dwelling on its evils &amp; more discussion about judicially manageable standards. https://t.co/YGsxPquKxb

@gelliottmorris It's true candidate quality may even out and the overall seat projection could be on the mark, but swings are never uniform. Just my 2 cents.
@gelliottmorris What if there were recent polls showing Valadao up by 15%+ and Bost trailing? My unsolicited advice might be to include a caveat that it's perilous to project national polls onto individual seats, esp. at this point.
@gelliottmorris Do you have plans to build race-by-race dynamics into this forecast? For example, you've got Valadao in #CA21 at a 73% chance of losing but Bost in #IL12 at an 73% chance of winning. Will that change?
Excellent @baseballot piece on geography of Dems' overperformance in '17/'18 elections. My takeaway: Dems restoring much of their old strength in Trump country, GOP restoring little of their old strength in the suburbs. https://t.co/B7lRavhC0c

Breaking: Dems' leading candidate in #IA03, Theresa Greenfield, announces she'll be "baking banana bread" instead of running for Congress after her campaign staff forged petitions. A setback for Dems in a competitive district.
@mattyglesias Actually, it's not. It's a consequence of the partisan distribution of voters.
Here's the "proof" of mathematical impossibility, for those still confused by this riddle:		To draw 6/8 D+7 districts in WI, you'd need to draw two remaining districts that are R+21. There aren't enough R+21 precincts in WI to form two districts, even setting contiguity aside. https://t.co/CbJIyZOfqm
Nice try, but actually it would still be mathematically impossible, unless there were to be wide partisan variance within precincts that you could prove. https://t.co/X7IvchQyQG
@ElectProject Fine, go ahead
@_justinlevitt_ @ElectProject The solution, then, might be to calculate the difference between the extreme map and the median simulated map, rather than distance from the statewide average.
@Doctor_MPhD @mattyglesias If you can do it, I've still got $7,000.
@ElectProject Btw, I'm still willing to pay $7,000 for the map if you have verifiable election results at the sub-precinct level.
@ElectProject I don't disagree on that. "Possible" is not the same as "what would likely emerge from a partisan-blind process"
@ElectProject Within the bounds of what was possible, sure. But in PA, the median simulated map will always be to the right of the statewide average (which is not shown here).
@ruthgreenwood @ElectProject I don't have a problem w/ anyone arguing for the maps they think are #FairMaps. But in most cases, the maps you want require mappers to actively compensate for an R geography advantage. And it's time to be honest about it.
@ElectProject Ward/precinct splitting doesn't even come close to explaining the partisan asymmetry of WI's political geography. What a strange hill to die on.
@ElectProject Twisting my "prediction" into evidence I declared the PA court "couldn't" adopt the plan you think is fair is called putting words in my mouth.
@ElectProject Oh yeah? How many census blocks are split in the current WI GOP gerrymander?
@ElectProject Um, I never said anything of the sort. #strawman
Ha. This is 100% untrue. I didn't care at all about compactness in this challenge. Go ahead, divide Madison &amp; Milwaukee in as many directions as you want. https://t.co/0I0dhXLDfG
@JoeAKendrick @mattyglesias Not true
You're not alone. Even a few well-known academics in the redistricting field have a hard time wrapping their heads around such a thing as spatial partisan bias. But it exists. https://t.co/rt3lzvXOhC

@PoliticsWolf The irony: under your nonpartisan map, Rs would have had a great shot to win 6/8 seats in '16, which is more than the 5/8 they won under the actual R gerrymander.
@gelliottmorris Yup. D voters are more hyper-concentrated in cities/college towns than R voters (far more D+&gt;25 precincts than R+&gt;25 precincts). As a result, on balance, maps that prioritize compactness lead to more D wasted votes.
For the last 7 years, I've argued that for Dems to win the House before 2022 (post-2021 redistricting), they would need either:		a) A resettlement program of their own voters	b) An unpopular GOP president in a midterm year		Guess what?
@gelliottmorris see above
The bottom line: Dems don't "deserve" to lose because they're inefficiently clustered in big cities/college towns/coastal America. But the fact that they are *does* moderately hurt their ability to win power in U.S. elections.
Is it possible to draw maps that create lots of competitive elections &amp; treat parties symmetrically in these places? Of course it is. But in many places, you have to make conscious pro-Dem mapping choices (like breaking up cities) to compensate for a GOP geography advantage.
We could play out this exercise in dozens of states where the D vote is hyper-concentrated in cities/college towns (MI, PA, etc.). It's also why a *partisan-blind* cong. map, on balance, would slightly favor Rs: https://t.co/SjXWkIALI0
Answer: It's easy to draw the GOP gerrymander, but the inverse Dem gerrymander isn't just hard - it's mathematically *impossible.* Despite WI's even partisanship, there is such a thing as a partisan bias in spatial distribution. https://t.co/q24WlSz7k0

By our estimates, Dems need to win ~7% more House votes than Republicans to win an equal number of seats this November. But gerrymandering's not the sole culprit. Voter geography, incumbency &amp; uncontested races are big factors too.
@trowaman @Nate_Cohn Where I take exception is when people talk about gerrymandering as if it's the exclusive reason Dems need to win ~7% more votes than Rs to win an equal number of seats. Geography, incumbency &amp; uncontested races are big factors too.
@trowaman @Nate_Cohn Well, actually, I agree.
1) I don't think this is what the @BrennanCenter report is concluding and 2) the report's assertion that Dems need an 11% margin in popular vote to take back the House is simply ridiculous. https://t.co/H4B0geMnL6

@jonlovett Drawing districts that are convex rather than concave &amp; avoid splitting existing county/municipal boundaries more than necessary.
If you don't care about compactness, you can. That's fine. But one of the main arguments against GOP's PA gerrymander was that it wasn't remotely compact.
Maybe this illustration will help: WI was basically tied in 2016. It's really easy to draw a compact 6-2 Trump CD map by packing Dems in Madison &amp; Milwaukee. Now try to draw a similarly compact 6-2 Clinton map. You can't. https://t.co/z6EjCPQ2mV
In the last midterms (2014), Rs won 5.7% more votes for House than Ds and 13.6% more seats, a difference of 7.9%.		In '18, maps are less favorable to Rs in FL/PA/VA than in '14. Even a Dem vote advantage of 6-7% could flip House, though 7-8% is a better bet.
That is also...very incorrect. If Dems win the House popular vote by 10% and fail to take back the House, I'll buy lunch for you &amp; the entire @BrennanCenter. https://t.co/zhLl6q1bmX
@mattyglesias @Nate_Cohn I'd estimate 7-8%

BTW, Dems have strong '18 pickup opportunities on most of these "extreme" maps. These R maps were drawn in 2011. Now, they're beginning to unravel b/c a) suburbs have trended away from Rs and b) anti-Trump midterm wave. https://t.co/oaepLxWbiU
It's possible to make the case other states are "mild" GOP gerrymanders. But there are also a few states w/ Dem gerrymanders: IL, MA, MD. The takeaway: GOP gerrymandering is clearly an obstacle to Dems retaking the House, but not as huge of one as commonly thought.
Here's an exercise: what % of 2018 House elections will be held in states w/ "extreme" GOP gerrymanders still in place? I bet it's smaller than a lot of people think. If you add up GA, MI, MO, NC, OH, TX, UT, WI - that's still only about 26% of all 435 House seats.
No. Dems' problem is that they're winning a few urban districts by 60%-70% and losing many more suburban seats by smaller margins. This could change in an '18 wave. https://t.co/0r1LwQQ4yB
Lastly, I'm well aware we've debated this a million times &amp; I'll be criticized/ratio'd for arguing gerrymandering's effects are overstated. But, I'd propose a friendly wager to @mcpli &amp; @lauraroyden: if Dems' seat/vote margins are &gt;10% apart, I'll buy lunch &amp; vice versa. Deal?
3) In the past 3 elections, Dems have won ~4% fewer seats than votes. We estimate Dems would need to win House popular vote by ~7% to win barest possible majority. If Dems win the popular vote by 11%, they'll be well on their way to a clear majority.
2) It isn't so much "technology and data-fueled 21st century gerrymandering" that's enhanced the effectiveness of partisan maps. It's the heightened geographic polarization of the American electorate, which has made it easier for parties to draw "safe" seats.
1) It's always misleading to cite "extreme gerrymandering" as an obstacle to Dems retaking House without citing the extreme urbanization of the Democratic vote that's led to millions more wasted votes. These two phenomena coexist &amp; are both important drivers of the GOP advantage.

If he wins the Dem primary, he might attract some Rs &amp; repel many Ds. If he loses the primary to a very liberal candidate, Rs could also have an opening. By the way: the R frontrunner in #PA07 is Olympic cycling gold medalist Marty "The Blade" Nothstein: https://t.co/0bQenlMf0P
Here's an example: Dems should have a golden opportunity to pick up Rep. Charlie Dent (R)'s open seat in #PA07 (D+1). But Dems' primary frontrunner is a hardcore anti-immigration local DA who warns against "turning the United States into Guatemala:" https://t.co/K1H1O6NoMt
At the moment, there are all kinds of fancy models flying around projecting out the relationship b/t national polls and the House seat count. That's all well and good. But there are limitations to data. Candidates &amp; campaigns are going to matter.
The only path left for GOP to keep its House majority involves some combo of these two things:		a) Generic ballot deficit ends up at something more manageable than double digits (say, 6-7%).	b) GOP succeeds in individually turning Dem candidates into unacceptable alternatives.
@SeanTrende So are parts of VA. But we didn't see Dems massively overperform in HoD races in the far southwest of VA, for example.
True of congressional specials, of which we don't have a very large data set. Also true that the most staggering Dem overperformances vs. '16 have come in extreme low-turnout state leg. specials (KY, MO, OK, etc.) and weren't matched in high turnout VA HoD races. https://t.co/Yt1n0BJuE1
Taken together, off-year results suggest:		a) Dems enjoy an intensity gap that looks like '10/'14 in reverse	b) Dems are regaining ground in places Trump surged in '16 while Rs are regaining none of their old strength in the suburbs.	c) Dems are modest favorites for the House.
But congressional specials have been powerful indicators too: they've been federal, high $$ fights w/ generally awful results for the GOP. To me, they're most useful in highlighting how much Rs could struggle to hold onto their own open House seats this fall.
IMHO, the most telling off-year results for 11/18 purposes have been VA's HoD races, which featured:		a) GOP incumbents (unlike specials)	b) Gov turnout (similar to midterms)	c) Big Dem gains (could've won majority had Dems funded more "2nd tier" races where they fell just short)
@NateSilver538 @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @Nate_Cohn @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris I'm with you on the 2nd pt. It's foolish to extrapolate extremely low-turnout state leg specials to cong midterms.		On #PA18, Lamb was as superior to Saccone as you can be while staying within the realm of "normal" candidates. Dems aren't going to get that biography everywhere.
@NateSilver538 @SeanTrende @Barnes_Law @henryolsenEPPC @ForecasterEnten @Nate_Cohn @djjohnso @Peoples_Pundit @gelliottmorris I'm not so sure. #PA18 and #ALSEN featured some of the widest/rarest Dem advantages in candidate quality among high-turnout races. If you factor in state leg specials, the most staggering Dem overperformances (Long Island, KY, MO, OK) have come amid extremely low turnout.
Breaking: Sean Casten (D) takes lead over Kelly Mazeski (D) by 616 votes in #IL06 primary. Looking like it'll be Casten vs. Rep. Peter Roskam (R) in November. Apologies for earlier error.
This could be a mild setback for Dems' chances of defeating Rep. Peter Roskam (R) in #IL06, a CD that voted for Clinton by 7%. Most DC Dems preferred to run a woman vs. Roskam, but there were 5 women splitting the Dem primary vote.
DuPage Co. appears to have taken a break from counting, but there could easily be another 5-10k votes left to count in #IL06, which would be more than enough for Sean Casten (D) to overtake Kelly Mazeski (D).
If both #IL03 Newman (D) and #IL06 Mazeski (D) lose their primaries, it would be a rough night in the Chicago burbs for EMILY's List and Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D), who endorsed both.
Mazeski (D) lead over Casten (D) falls to just 260 votes w/ 91 DuPage precincts left to count. Casten increasingly looking like narrow favorite in #IL06.
Mazeski (D) lead down to 683 votes w/ 103 DuPage precincts left to go in #IL06.
Another 14 DuPage Co. precincts cut Mazeski (D) lead from 760 to 724 in #IL06. Still 120 precincts left to count.
Another 28 DuPage Co. precincts cut Mazeski (D)'s lead over Casten (D) from 976 to 760 votes in #IL06. Still another 134 DuPage precincts left to count.
To be clear, I'm not saying Mazeski (D) or Casten (D) is more electable than the other, but #IL06 Rep. Peter Roskam (R) is in Toss Up that will help decide House control. #IL03 is a safe Dem seat.
In #IL06, Kelly Mazeski (D) clinging to 976 vote lead (2.4%) over Sean Casten (D) with 162 precincts in DuPage Co. (Casten home) left to count. This is going to wind up closer than #IL03, with much bigger fall implications.

Projection: Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) turns back primary challenge from Marie Newman (D) in #IL03, virtually assuring him another term.
Betsy Dirksen Londrigan (D) wins nomination against Rep. Rodney Davis (R) in downstate #IL13. For now, @CookPolitical November rating: Likely R. Could get more competitive.
Rauner (R) &amp; Lipinski (D) both looking like they'll barely hang on. #ILGOV #IL03
Lipinski's 4,090 vote margin in the city of Chicago is making all the difference in the #IL03 primary at the moment. Machine looks like it'll live to fight another day.
In #IL06, first few McHenry Co. precincts give Kelly Mazeski (D) a 19% lead over Sean Casten (D). Not many votes there, but she may need every one to fend off his E-Day strength in DuPage Co.
Now corrected: Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) still leads Marie Newman (D) by 1.8% w/ 87% reporting. Newman now needs something close to a miracle. #IL03
AP has Marie Newman (D) surging ahead of Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) by 1,562 votes (1.9%), but I'm not so sure. Could be a big error in Will Co. reporting. #IL03
Actually, the most R district held by a D is still #MN07, Rep. Collin Peterson (D). PVI R+12 (#PA18 is R+11). Most D district held by an R is #FL26, Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R), D+6. https://t.co/FviXWlsBTi
With 81% reporting, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D)'s lead over Marie Newman (D) down to 2.2%. Newman needs better numbers in final suburban Cook/Will precincts to have a chance. #IL03
With 78% reporting, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D)'s lead over Marie Newman (D) down to 2.5%. Going down to the wire, but Lipinski still with tiny edge. #IL03
I'd argue it's safer for Dems than its PVI of D+6 b/c there are an awful lot of Trump Democrats in this part of Chicagoland who won't vote for an R at House level. https://t.co/ot4QbcI1y3
With 74% reporting, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) lead down to 3.0%. 80% of his Chicago base reporting, so Marie Newman (D) needs some better suburban margins to catch up. #IL03
Eek, may have to take this back in #IL06. Sean Casten (D), who benefited from some late outside spending, doing surprisingly well w/ the Election Day vote &amp; has initial lead in DuPage. My bad. https://t.co/cki6Vt8yl9
With 73% of precincts reporting, Lipinski's lead holding steady at 4.5%. Slightly more suburban precincts remaining than Chicago. Lipinski may be slight favorite to hang on, very close. #IL03
With about half the vote counted in the Cook Co. suburbs, Newman (D) leading there w/ 51%. Still looking very close overall. #IL03
Rep. Dan Lipinski (D)'s lead down to 5.3% w/ 54% of precincts reporting, including a lot of his home base. Still looking like a jump ball. #IL03
Now 65% of Chicago's #IL03 precincts are reporting and Lipinski's share down to 57%. That may or may not be good enough to hold on district-wide.
Projection: Chuy Garcia (D) wins #IL04 primary, defeating Sol Flores (D). Virtually assures him a seat in Congress in November.
It looks like Lipinski's good Cook Co. showing so far is all from the city of Chicago, which could include the wards friendliest to his family. #IL03
So far, Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) winning 60% in Cook Co. but just 41% in Will Co. We won't really know what's up until we see which parts of Cook that is. #IL03
Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) may have the opposite problem. A lot of the Catholic, culturally conservative Dems who used to vote in his primaries are now pro-Trump. Those who are left are at risk of being displaced. #IL03
There's a new name for social moderates who used to vote in GOP primaries: Democrats. Turns out that's a slight problem for people like Rauner. #ILGOV
Biss not surprisingly a hit w/ Champaign's progressives, but otherwise Pritzker looks like he's in good shape. #ILGOV
So far these Rauner numbers are looking pretty reminiscent of Gillespie/Stewart early on #VAGOV primary night last June.
First results show EMILY's List-backed Lauren Underwood (D) totally cruising in #IL14 primary w/ 61%. Could turn into a real race vs. Rep. Randy Hultgren (R).

If Marie Newman (D) prevails, don't call it the start of some progressive wave about to topple the Dem "establishment" in primaries. Lipinski is an extreme outlier in today's Dem caucus, at least in districts as Dem as #IL03. There are virtually no analogous situations elsewhere.
That said, #IL03 is an old-school Chicago, Dem machine CD where his family name (and family) could still help him across the finish line. Even in the burbs (which were carefully selected to protect him in 2011 redistricting).
A few thoughts on tonight's #IL03 primary: Rep. Dan Lipinski (D) has long been holding this D+6 seat on borrowed time. As a pro-life, anti-ACA Dem, he's been lucky to avoid a one-on-one against a strong primary challenger up until 2018. 1/

As a result of PA's new map &amp; Conor Lamb's #PA18 win, there are now 25 Republicans sitting in districts carried by Clinton in 2016 &amp; Democrats only need to pick up 23 GOP seats for a majority.
The new PA map is a done deal. Under new lines, Dems have excellent chance to pick up 3-5 seats in addition to Lamb (under old lines, 1-3). Net change: ~+2D. https://t.co/kj2n0kBnhg

New at @CookPolitical: 10 House ratings changes following #PA18 result. Full new ratings here: https://t.co/zhMCDp7gSh https://t.co/slS1FlTPHV
Remember, though: this doesn't mean Dems are about to win 80+ seats. It's much easier for Dems to win impressive %s in open seat situations (as is the case with specials) than vs. well-funded GOP incumbents, as will be the case in most districts this fall.
Dems have outpaced their "typical" share of the vote (as estimated using @CookPolitical PVI) by an average of 9% in the past year's 7 special congressional elections. They'd only need to overperform by an average of 4% to win the House majority in November. https://t.co/RJckdTDFMn
As @gelliottmorris is aware, it's difficult to assess what % of '16 Dem/GOP voters actually turned out yesterday without looking at the voter file once we have it. All Dem overperformances in specials have been combos of differential turnout &amp; some persuasion.
Very cool charts. But caution: the Dem/GOP turnout differential wasn't quite this large. A big element in #PA18 outcome was crossover from Trump to Lamb. https://t.co/Y0022i4h9V

I can't remember the last time a PA congressional candidate lost the Election Day vote and won with absentees. Conor Lamb (D) appears to have done so in #PA18.
@djlavoie Because absentees have always skewed more Dem
Not a surprise: Lamb (D) expanded lead with Washington Co. absentees. Hard to see why Rs would want to drag this out when they've got so many other races to be worried about. #PA18 https://t.co/hl0HKqq4fs
@KSoltisAnderson Clairton was carved out of #PA18 on purpose in the 2011 map.
Most fitting #PA18 result of the night? Midway, PA (Washington Co.):		Lamb (D) 108	Saccone (R) 108
Breaking: @VaughnHillyard reporting Rick Saccone (R) plans to file to run in new #PA14 next week. Very possible both Saccone &amp; Lamb (D) could be serving in the House together come Jan. 2019.
I've gotta hand it to the @UpshotNYT/@Nate_Cohn crew tonight, who predicted a turnout of 228k. We're at 227,015 votes counted w/ around 1k absentees left.
Hard to see how Conor Lamb (D) wouldn't start out as the favorite vs. Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) in new #PA17. It's a full eight points more Dem than current #PA18.
UPDATE: Here's what Lamb (D) got in each #PA18 county (two-party vote):		Allegheny: 58%	Greene: 42%	Washington: 46%	Westmoreland: 43% https://t.co/9MdirYxKsW

Libertarian Drew Miller's vote total, currently 1,372, will almost certainly exceed Lamb (D)'s margin of victory (again, barring tabulation error). #PA18
According to a source, one of the outstanding precincts (N. Ligonier, Westmoreland Co.) voted Saccone (R) 479-285. That's about what we expected, and it's consistent w/ Lamb (D) lead holding at around 400-600 votes.
Story of the result: Lamb (D) &amp; Saccone (R) both hit roughly the %s they needed in each county of #PA18. But here's the difference:		Allegheny Co. (Dem) turned out at 67% of '16 levels, Westmoreland Co. (GOP) turned out at just 60% of '16. Another pro-Dem enthusiasm gap.
It's very possible (even likely) that Saccone (R) won the #PA18 Election Day vote. But barring an error, absentees will have put Lamb (D) over the top.
Safer for #PA18 to be a midnight oil burner than a barnburner. https://t.co/G37614dX0S

Projection: Barring a major tabulation error, Conor Lamb (D) has defeated Rick Saccone (R) in #PA18.
Breaking: Lamb (D) won 57% of the Allegheny Co. election day vote, but 62% of its absentees. That bodes really well for his chances of breaking nearly even in the other counties' absentees.
BREAKING: Allegheny Co. absentees break 1,930 to 1,178 for Lamb (D). Lamb now up 847 votes (0.4%) w/ 2 precincts left. Barring a tabulation error somewhere, that should be enough for him to prevail.
It looks like the latest vote surge that put Lamb (D) up by 845 was from Allegheny, not remaining Westmoreland precincts. Am I wrong? #PA18
Ok, so...this wasn't the best prediction I've ever made. #PA18 https://t.co/67GzKdEMVo
UPDATE: Lamb (D) lead down to 95 votes (0.04%), with two Westmoreland Co. precincts outstanding. Still, assuming no tabulation errors, absentees should be enough to keep Lamb ahead by at least a few hundred. #PA18
Democrats don't have a clear leader. That's also one of the best things going for them in 2018: the face of the party becomes whoever's running in each state/district (e.g. Lamb), while GOP candidates tied to Trump.
Also, don't lose sight of how Conor Lamb (D) was able to do so well tonight. When the opposite party's president is unpopular, turns out you can keep your base AND break from your own party on guns/energy/trade/etc. to get to 50% in a really tough district. #PA18
Sorry, but a Dem probably winning a CD Trump won by 19.6% is a *really* big deal. Result will hugely impact not only races in western PA's new districts, but GOP morale nationally. https://t.co/p1tRG7jhtn
This #PA18 situation is crazy: not only is a recount possible, but Lamb (D) &amp; Saccone (R) must decide which district(s) to run for in the fall &amp; collect 1,000 valid signatures before the filing deadline (3/20) in just ONE WEEK.
Lamb (D) should expect a pretty healthy boost from uncounted absentees. Why? 1) They've historically skewed Dem 2) More than half of them are from Allegheny Co. (despite Allegheny only being ~43% of #PA18). https://t.co/SAth8WtnY0
Breaking: Elizabeth Twp District 2 just came in and cut Lamb's lead by 170 votes. Lamb (D) lead down to 585 votes (0.3%) w/ 13 precincts left to go.
It's been reported that there were about 6-7k absentees cast in #PA18. In the past, absentees have run slightly more Dem than the overall vote and I don't believe they've been counted yet. They may matter here.
One of the 7 outstanding Allegheny Co. precincts, Elizabeth Twp. #2, went for Trump 652-320 and is prime Saccone (R) turf. The rest of them are burbs that should break even. Not much insurance for Lamb (D) there. #PA18
Lamb (D) lead back down to 918 votes (0.4%) w/ 99% of Westmoreland now in. That's probably not the boost Saccone (R) needed, but still 13 Washington Co. precincts left. #PA18
Lamb (D) up 1,238 votes w/ 96% of precincts counted. Of the 25 outstanding precincts, 18 are in Washington/Westmoreland Co. and should favor Saccone (R). *Probably* not by enough to overtake Lamb (D) in raw votes. #PA18
Another few Allegheny precincts just came in and went 929-823 for Lamb (D) (98% reporting there). A few Bethel Park precincts left that should break even, and one in Elizabeth that should be pro-Saccone.
The odds are still very slightly in favor of Lamb (D) finishing w/ more votes tonight, but probably by less than 1k votes and w/ less than 50% of the overall vote. We'll see. #PA18
UPDATE: Lamb (D) lead falls to 928 votes (0.4%) w/ 95% of precincts reporting. Nearly all Westmoreland in. The remaining Allegheny precincts lean Lamb, remaining Washington precincts lean Saccone. #PA18
Lamb (D) lead falls to 1,976 w/ 91% reporting. Remaining precincts still *slightly* favorable to Saccone (R). #PA18
Needless to say, the fact #PA18 is headed for a photo finish is pretty bad news for Republicans nationally.
Lamb (D) lead down to 2,493 votes (1.4%) w/ 87% of precincts reporting. The remaining precincts lean *slightly* Saccone. This might be a good time to look up PA's recount provisions. #PA18
The 9% of Allegheny Co. that's still out is still *really* important...and actually, it could be favorable to Saccone (R) b/c a lot of Moon Twp. is still out. #PA18
We're headed for a photo finish, folks. Lamb (D) still the favorite by a hair. #PA18
Breaking: 100% of Greene Co. now reporting. Final precinct there pushed Lamb (D) up to 42. That's 1% above what thought he needed there to win #PA18.
Breaking: Westmoreland just jumped up to 77% reporting. Lamb (D) holding steady there at 43%. That's right about where he needs to be...but just barely. #PA18
With 95% of Greene Co. reporting... guess where Lamb (D)'s at there? 41%. https://t.co/lgjMfODDbh
Right now, all the counties are breaking as they would in a tied #PA18 outcome. The reason I might but a thumb on the scale for Lamb (D) is higher intensity/turnout in Dem-heavy precincts vs. GOP-heavy ones. But it's super-close.
Quite possible at this point. https://t.co/okxtIAniUy
What Saccone (R) really needs is a big boost from the remaining Washington Co. precincts. His % should improve there as more report. #PA18
So far, Lamb (D) is doing well enough in Westmoreland to pull this out: he's above 43% w/ 53% of precincts reporting there. BUT, unclear what precincts are left there. #PA18
I'd still maybe rather be Lamb (D) but this is a *very* close special. #PA18
Lamb (D) doing maybe a hair better than he needs to do in Allegheny precincts &amp; turnout pretty robust there. Saccone (R) doing hair better elsewhere, question is what's Westmoreland/rural turnout like? #PA18
A lot of what we're seeing in Allegheny right now are Lamb's best precincts. Looking really close &amp; we won't have a better idea until we see some Westmoreland. #PA18
Face value those numbers look good for Lamb, but they're also from central Washington Co., which is the most Dem-friendly part of the county. https://t.co/C0ZOZ3nI3e
Just in...Moon Township #6:		2016: Trump +15.2%	2018: Saccone +5.2%		That's where Trump was the other night and it's the first decent precinct for Saccone we've seen. But turnout lagging some Dem-heavy precincts. #PA18
The most GOP-heavy Allegheny precinct that's reported so far (Jefferson Hills) is only at 54.7% of its 2016 turnout, while most Dem-heavy precinct (Mt. Lebanon 5-7) is at 75.2% of its 2016 turnout. 		That mirrors 2017 specials and it's pretty ominous for Saccone (R). #PA18
Rick Saccone (R) better hope that he beats expectations in Westmoreland, otherwise tough to see a route for him to win #PA18. Still nothing there.
Just in...Scott Township 2-2 (Allegheny Co.):		2016: Clinton (D) +9.2%	2018: Lamb (D) +30.2%		Lamb is exceeding what he needs in Allegheny. Need to see more of #PA18...
More good news for Lamb. Bridgeville precinct 2 (Allegheny Co.):		2016: Clinton (D) +0.5%	2018: Lamb (D) +25.3%		Lamb's above where he needs to be there.
First 2 precincts in Greene Co. give Lamb (D) a 212-196 lead. Clinton (D) didn't come close to winning a single precinct there in 2016. Good news for Lamb. #PA18
That's right about on pace for a very tight contest. But we have to wait to see what the swings are like elsewhere. #PA18
Breaking: first precinct IN! Pleasant Hills (Allegheny Co.) district 6.		2016: Trump (R) +14.9%	2018: Lamb (D) +5.5%
Another thing we'll be watching for as results come in: is there a big turnout differential between Allegheny (pro-Lamb) vs. Westmoreland (pro-Saccone)?
ICYMI: Here's what I'd estimate Conor Lamb (D) needs in each #PA18 county to win tonight:		Allegheny: 58%	Greene: 41%	Washington: 47%	Westmoreland: 43%
It's go time, #PA18. Let's see some precincts.
Tonight's outcome will reverberate beyond PA's 18th district https://t.co/ocCt0vf4E8 via @nbcnews
Have a feeling tonight won't be *that* late a night. There are extremely few early/absentee votes in PA, meaning we should be able to match #PA18 precinct results to past results fairly quickly &amp; see what's up.
Been wondering this too. Btw (unrelated): current #PA18 is an often-overlooked GOP gerrymander, artfully slithering between Clairton &amp; Monessen to avoid picking up Dems. https://t.co/UUuZqCoNCO
A much bigger potential problem for GOP: #OH12 special on 8/7.
If Dems win #PA18 tonight, some will turn their gaze to the 4/24 #AZ08 special for Trent Franks'a seat, another Trump +20 seat.		Two reasons I think GOP will be in much better shape there: 1) unlike #PA18, #AZ08 has virtually no Dem DNA 2) vote by mail lowers GOP drop-off.
RT @amyewalter: The  ‘Saccone is terrible candidate’ excuse is silly. He’s no rock star but he’s also no Roy Moore
@SalenaZito Umm... https://t.co/ZOKjuBfHsu
But the outcome also has much larger implications for party messaging. If GOP can't sell tax cuts effectively in a CD that voted for Trump by 19.6%, where will they be able to in the fall?
If Lamb (D) wins, he'll be in a much stronger position to take on Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) in #PA17 in the fall (in fact, he'd probably be a slight favorite). If Saccone (R) wins, he'll have inside track for #PA14 to the south.
Beware downplaying of #PA18 as a special for a district that's "going extinct." Tomorrow's outcome matters a great deal not only for what'll unfold in new Pittsburgh area districts (#PA14, #PA17, etc.) in Nov. , but for both parties' morale in larger fight for the House.
This 51%-45% Conor Lamb (D) lead is pretty consistent w/ other polling that's led me to believe Rick Saccone (R)'s been a slight underdog for weeks. #PA18 https://t.co/QJLLfOJEFv

@Nate_Cohn I'm in the 220-240k range...you?

@mcpli @_justinlevitt_ @AriBerman @ruthgreenwood That's exactly the problem. Because there's no clear SCOTUS standard, the decisions to bring suits vs. over-packing of minority voters are driven largely by partisan considerations, not protection of minority voters.
@_justinlevitt_ @mcpli @AriBerman @ruthgreenwood I'd like to know how the racial intent in VA and NC was provable in a way the intent in AL and LA isn't. My point is that under the current VRA regime, equal protection for minorities across state lines is lacking. Same could be true for partisan minorities.
@_justinlevitt_ @mcpli @AriBerman @ruthgreenwood Then why haven't #LA02 and #AL07 been struck down the way #VA03 and #NC12 have been? They clearly overpack African-Americans in a similar way.
@mcpli @AriBerman @ruthgreenwood I'm skeptical of an "it'll all get worked out later" approach. I doubt appellate courts of varying/evolving ideologies will settle on a lasting standard for partisan harm. Just look at race: what's considered unconstitutional packing in VA/NC still stands in AL/LA.
@mcpli @AriBerman @ruthgreenwood If the court articulates the harm we should be looking for without adopting a measurable standard to outlaw it, wouldn't there be a risk of lower courts adopting their own varying standards and gerrymanders being struck down incongruously?
@AriBerman @ruthgreenwood That's a fair place to start. But in your opinion, which elections should be used to calculate the efficiency gap/partisan bias? What threshold do you favor for how much bias is too much? How should judges assess what % of bias is attributable to mapping choices vs. geography?
I'm open to the possibility there's a workable anti-gerrymandering standard for SCOTUS to adopt. I also believe those who argue it's destroying democracy should be prepared to advocate for specific proposals to fix the problem &amp; make maps fair.

Calling it a night so I can sound mildly coherent discussing the results on @ThePollsters podcast tomorrow. On to the IL primary in two weeks!
Dems accounted for ~40% of all TX primary votes cast this year. That's up from 29% in 2014 &amp; 31% in 2010, but it's a bit lower than some Dems were hoping (they were 44% in 2006). Despite Trump's mediocre standing in TX, it's still a pretty Republican state.
Dems' turnout spike was far from evenly distributed on the map. Biggest jumps relative to '14/'10 came in major metros/wealthy suburbs. That bodes well for Dems in #TX07 &amp; #TX32 and maybe #TX23. Less so in statewide races.
Does this mean a blue wave is about to wash over TX? Most likely not. Does it confirm a spike in Dem enthusiasm relative to past midterms that should concern the GOP in a lot of places? Yes.
Breaking, w/ nearly all of TX's precincts in: Dem primary voting has spiked 84% vs. 2014 midterm, GOP voting just 13%. Not terribly far off from what early voting in TX's 15 largest counties predicted. https://t.co/qelSSCQySs
Allred (40%) starts as clear favorite over Salerno (17%) in Dem runoff for right to take on Rep. Pete Sessions (R) in what should be a very competitive #TX32 race. https://t.co/UrFmgq3Ak8
In #TX21, fmr. Cruz staffer Chip Roy &amp; perennial candidate Matt McCall advance to GOP runoff. Much-touted Joseph Kopser (D) advances to Dem runoff w/ disappointing 2nd place showing.
Releasing this cheesy jingle on primary night might be peak Ted Cruz. https://t.co/bHaRAfdq3y
Also, she might win the award for awkward stump speech of the year: https://t.co/mHPgvNbsUg
For starters, $6 million should've bought her better video production value. Her ads looked like early '90s public access television. https://t.co/Ok8t7HkBij
Looks like the #TX02 GOP runoff will come down to state Rep. Kevin Roberts vs. former Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw. Either would be strong favorite vs. Todd Litton (D) in November.
Remarkable: self-styled "female Trump" Kathaleen Wall fails to make #TX02 GOP runoff after spending $6 million of her own $$ to win around 12k votes.
@CrassPolitical Dems cast more primary ballots there in '14 and still lost general. The major primary turnout gains from '14 to '18 have come in #TX07 &amp; #TX32.
So far, Dems are seeing big turnout gains vs. '14/'10 in major metro TX, but not nearly as dramatic elsewhere. Bodes well for them in #TX07 &amp; #TX32, not as well for them in other contests.
Let this be a cautionary tale for using $$ to project votes in upcoming primaries. https://t.co/wX9Oso7FDu
At the moment, #TX02 GOP candidate Kathaleen Wall is in danger of failing to make the runoff despite self-funding to the tune of $6 million.
Hard to disagree. Dems will still show great gains over '14/'10, but GOP will still hold very solid lead in primary vote and lots of DCCC-favored scenarios not panning out. https://t.co/IVsapjLHXG
National Dems/Castros were really high on Hulings. Looking like he won't even make #TX23 runoff. Ouch. https://t.co/Gby1Bm3Mj7

@chriscostantini Sorry, not my job to shield ppl from data they don't like.
TX primary turnout in recent midterms:		2006: 56% R, 44% D	2010: 69% R, 31% D	2014: 71% R, 29% D	Tonight: ??, ??		But so far, a whole lot closer to 2006 than 2010/2014.
@Nate_Cohn @SeanTrende who could you possible be referring to...
Won't come as a great surprise to most, but I'll disagree slightly. Final turnout will show (as EV predicted) that Dems are *much* more engaged than they were in 2010/2014. Consistent with wave environment. https://t.co/Hwnk97akL1
Tonight's a pretty stark reminder that Beto O'Rourke isn't yet a statewide phenom in #TXSEN. He's at 87% of Dem primary vote in Austin, but:		31% in Orange	34% in Beaumont	41% in Laredo	46% in Brownsville	57% in Dallas		He's got more work to do to consolidate Dems.
There was never any question Rs would cast more TX primary ballots than Ds. Question is what final ratio looks like. Was 2-1 R in both 2010 &amp; 2014.
Despite self-funding to the tune of $5.9 million to run poor quality ads, Trump self-comparing Kathaleen Wall (R) currently running 2nd in #TX02 GOP primary behind state Rep. Kevin Roberts (R). Will head to runoff.
Actually, Kopser (D) currently leading w/ only 30% of the vote in #TX21 - headed to runoff. Pretty weak showing so far for someone who's supposed to be Dems' great hope in that CD.
Hard to believe, but TX has never elected a Latina to Congress. That's ending in 2018: #TX16 Veronica Escobar (D) and #TX29 Sylvia Garcia (D) both look like they'll avoid runoffs, assuring them safe Dem seats in El Paso &amp; Houston.
#TX21 GOP primary looks very likely to head to runoff between William Negley (R) and Chip Roy (R). Winner will face Joseph Kopser (D). Likely R in November.
Beto O'Rourke (D) is at 64% statewide and will obviously avoid runoff for #TXSEN, but so far his numbers in lots of rural TX aren't living up to the 254-county tour hype.
In #TX07, EMILY's List-backed Lizzie Fletcher (D) has made the runoff. Only question: will late attacks deny Laura Moser (D) the other runoff slot? We'll wait and see whether her 2.4% lead holds.
In Dallas's #TX32, Colin Allred (D) seized momentum in last few months and looks like he'll be heavy fave in runoff to face Rep. Pete Sessions (R).
Gina Ortiz Jones currently dominating Castro brothers-backed Jay Hulings in #TX23 Dem primary...can she avoid a runoff and head straight to general vs. Rep. Will Hurd (R)?
@Nate_Cohn can't believe a Bakersfield Dem wouldn't be interested in a year like '18.
I'd expect this to be true of Dems' fall gains vs. '16 prez margins, but much more consistent across district types vs. past *congressional* margins. https://t.co/IBV91KWnxp
Yes definitely a real possibility in Rep. Duncan Hunter (R)'s #CA50, where electorate is super GOP. https://t.co/DVN1zecVV8
Why I'm skeptical Dems will end up getting "shut out" in CA's top-two House primaries: amped Dem voters poised to make up greater share of primary electorate than in past years.

@JustCameron__ You're not following. Dems have great chance to pick up 4-6 under new map. They had great chance to pick up 2-4 under old map. Net difference: ~2 seats. Hope that makes it clearer.
Also be skeptical of pronouncements that "Dems will pick up 4-6 seats" because of the new map. The new map replaces 4-6 existing Dem pickup opportunities with much stronger ones. Net difference? Maybe 2 seats.
Be skeptical of pronouncements that "PA's new map is 10R-8D" (going by Trump/Clinton). It's a highly competitive map &amp; Dems have excellent chance to win 10+ seats in November.
@_justinlevitt_ We don't disagree. The GOP map the court overturned was an extreme gerrymander. But it took Dems winning a 5-2 majority on a partisan court to make it happen. If the GOP were to win control of a partisan court, more than a few Dems would be suspicious of their motives.

@stevesingiser @PoliticsWolf You also might want to mention that the GOP effort to impeach PA's judges is likely headed nowhere - in part because the gerrymander they passed in 2011 was so obvious/egregious, they have little public sympathy.
@PoliticsWolf Maybe they didn't because the CA commission's map resulted in Dems *gaining* four House seats in 2012. Note I didn't say "all Dems" - I think most are sincere in desire to end all gerrymandering. But many don't care about procedure, only best outcome for their side.
To be clear, this was likely to happen under any map that valued compactness &amp; reunited Lehigh Valley. But Cartwright's new CD could've also gotten considerably more Republican &amp; didn't.
Another winner in PA Remap: Rep. Matt Cartwright (D), whose GOP opponent John Chrin ($915k on hand) saw his home drawn out of the new #PA08. Will Chrin switch gears to open Lehigh Valley #PA07 instead?
Also, this is a logical choice for Rep. Brendan Boyle (D). When he first ran for NE Philly/Montco #PA13 in 2014, he crushed it w/ 69% of Dem primary vote in Philly, got just 16% in Montco.
As predicted. Could this clear way for former Rep. Allyson Schwartz (D) to come back now that her old Montco seat is back as new #PA04? https://t.co/wVzgMyUAEP
Redistricting has become a never-ending game of partisan one-upmanship. If PA roles were reversed, no doubt many Dems would be howling at a "partisan court" for overturning the will of a duly elected legislature (tho both are elected bodies in PA).
Remember: the PA ruling wouldn't have been possible had Dems not won key PA Supreme Court races in 2015. Which is why you aren't about to see other states' GOP-drawn maps dismantled en masse, at least not in 2018.
@JohnAnzo I think D is at the core of C
Personally, I'd probably answer c). The PA Supreme Court's answer was by far closest to a). But here's what we can say for sure: the old GOP-drawn map didn't meet any of these definitions.
What's the definition of a "fair map?" Is it one that:		a) aims to award a proportional share of seats to votes?	b) maximizes competitive districts?	c) disregards partisanship altogether?		Answer: it's in the eye of the beholder. But if you agree w/ a), you'll like PA's new map.

@Nate_Cohn pending Lamb or Wolf?
New PA map raises interesting possibility: even if SCOTUS can't settle on a workable definition of partisan gerrymandering, it could place limits by requiring that lines respect existing county/city boundaries to extent possible (as PA did).
@geoffreyvs Wait, the special is March 13. That's a whole week.
Under the old lines, here were the PVIs of the six vulnerable GOP seats:		#PA06: R+2	#PA07: R+1	#PA08: R+2	#PA15: R+4	#PA16: R+5	#PA18: R+11	Median: R+3		Under new lines:		#PA01: R+1	#PA05: D+13	#PA06: D+2	#PA07: D+1	#PA10: R+6	#PA17: R+3	Median: EVEN
The most accurate way to think about partisan impact of new PA map isn't "Dems gain x seats from it." It's that the new map replaced 6 existing Dem pickup opportunities w/ 6 *much stronger* opportunities: (#PA01, #PA05, #PA06, #PA07, #PA10, #PA17).
@pwthornton Fact: PA's political geography naturally advantages GOP. It's tough to draw 9/18 districts to elect Dems without splitting Philadelphia/Pittsburgh many ways. Just the way it is - sorry you don't get this concept.
@mlbroeske The "very definition of our democracy?" No, that's called proportional representation. If you favor that, fine. Our single-member district system is ill-equipped to guarantee PR. Example: Dems won ~1/3 of the vote in WV - but it's impossible to draw a Clinton district there.
Terrific explainer of why the new PA lines are even better for Dems than expected. Dems' pickup opportunities in ~5 seats just got a lot better. https://t.co/DW2QA8H96X
P.S. Dems' natural geographic disadvantage has *zero* to do w/ land mass/density. It has to do with concentration of their voters in Philadelphia/Pittsburgh - made it difficult to spread Dems across many PA districts without violating the court's compactness criteria.
Examples: new PA map splits Berks Co. (Reading) in a way that gives Dems an advantage in #PA06. Splits York Co. in a way that helps Dems in #PA10. Splits Luzerne Co. in a way that protects Rep. Matt Cartwright (D) in #PA08.
Make no mistake: this is the PA map Dems wanted. It's a ringing endorsement of the "partisan fairness" doctrine: that parties should be entitled to same proportion of seats as votes. However, in PA (and many states), achieving that requires conscious pro-Dem mapping choices.
Holder statement on new PA map: “The fair map issued by the state Supreme Court is a major victory in the fight against gerrymandering in Pennsylvania and around the country...Republicans all over the country should be on notice - their days of partisan map-rigging are numbered."
A caveat for Dems: two Lancaster Dems, Christina Hartman &amp; Jess King, have raised $300k+ for #PA16. Now that $$ is pretty useless &amp; Dems need a Harrisburg candidate against Rep. Scott Perry (R) in new #PA10 instead.
The result: Dems have a great shot to win 8-11 of PA's 18 seats in November. Under a truly partisan-blind compact map, maybe 7-10. Under old GOP map, maybe 6-9.
Bottom line: the PA Supreme Court's map doesn't just undo the GOP's gerrymander. It goes further, actively helping Dems compensate for their natural geographic disadvantage in PA.
New #PA18 (old #PA14): Rep. Mike Doyle (D) keeps a safe Dem Pittsburgh seat. PVI moves from D+17 to D+13.
New #PA17 (old #PA12): Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) gets much more of Allegheny Co., making him MUCH more vulnerable. PVI goes from R+11 to R+3. This is a logical place for Conor Lamb (D) to run in Nov., whether he wins 3/13 or not.
CORRECTION: New #PA08 (old #PA17): Rep. Matt Cartwright (D) gets to keep a seat that's R+1, PVI essentially unchanged (earlier Tweet referred to wrong new CD's PVI - perils of district renumbering).
New #PA16 (old #PA03): Erie is reunited &amp; Butler Co. is once again split, moving PVI from R+11 to R+8. Rep. Mike Kelly (R) potentially at risk if right Dem runs.
New #PA15 (old #PA05): this rural western PA seat becomes by far the most GOP in the state at R+20. Safe for Rep. G.T. Thompson (R).
New #PA14 (old #PA18): this new SWPA district loses Allegheny County (Conor Lamb (D)'s home) &amp; becomes safer for GOP. PVI moves from R+11 to R+14.
New #PA13 (old #PA09): this is a reconfigured version of the Shuster (R) open seat centered on Altoona. Still safe GOP.
New #PA12 (old #PA10): Rep. Tom Marino (R) gets to keep a safe GOP seat centered on Williamsport. PVI moves from R+16 to R+17.
New #PA11 (old #PA16): Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R) a big winner in this remap. Unites Lancaster &amp; rural York, loses Reading. PVI moves from R+5 to R+14.
New #PA10 (old #PA04): Rep. Scott Perry (R)'s new district now takes in all of Harrisburg, moving PVI from R+11 to R+6. Potentially competitive in a wave.
New #PA09 (old #PA11): a reconfigured version of the Barletta (R) open seat centered on Schuylkill County. Remains safe GOP, PVI R+14.
New #PA07 (old #PA15): reunites the Lehigh Valley, making Dent (R) open seat much more winnable for Dems. PVI moves from R+4 to D+1.
New #PA06 (keeps same #): unites all of Chester County plus city of Reading. Rep. Ryan Costello (R) now in big trouble. PVI moves from R+2 to D+2.
New #PA05 (old #PA07): safe Dem seat for a Delco Dem. Meehan (R) is the retiring incumbent here &amp; now GOP doesn't have a prayer of keeping it. PVI D+13.
New #PA04 (old #PA13): safe Dem seat for a Montco Dem. Boyle (D) could choose to run here but lives in new #PA02.
New #PA03 (old #PA02): safe African-American majority seat for Rep. Dwight Evans (D). PVI D+41
New #PA02 (old #PA01): this should be a safe NE Philly district for Rep. Brendan Boyle (D). PVI D+25
New #PA01 (old #PA08): Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R) - takes in a less GOP-friendly portion of Montco, PVI ticks down from R+2 to R+1
Breaking: @CookPolitical PVI values for the new PA map (h/t @bycoffe). Note: districts were totally renumbered, so careful on before/after. Will walk thru the biggest changes below. 1/ https://t.co/BL6JpgzXbQ
The only GOP incumbent who's a big winner in this map is Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R), whose Lancaster district gets MUCH safer.
Actually, not quite fair to call 10th CD (Harrisburg) open. Rep. Scott Perry (R) lives there &amp; could run there, but it's a much more competitive CD than what he currently has.
New map: 8 Clinton CDs &amp; 10 Trump CDs, but Dems have strong opportunities in 3 Trump CDs: 8th (Cartwright/Scranton, they already hold), 10th (open/Harrisburg), 17th (Rothfus/Pittsburgh burbs).
This map actively helps Dems compensate for their natural geographic disadvantage in PA. Much more favorable to them than what I expected.
One wrinkle for Dems: if Conor Lamb (D) wins 3/13 special, he may have little choice but to challenge Rep. Keith Rothfus (R) to keep his seat in November.
Also, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R) seat in Bucks barely becomes a Clinton district. Overall, Dems have a good chance in up to 11 CDs &amp; an outside chance at a 12th seat in Erie.
Biggest changes to GOP seats: open Meehan seat becomes safe Dem, Costello/Rothfus seats get much more Dem, open Dent seat becomes a Clinton district, open 10th CD becomes a Dem opportunity.

@darwinleuba Whoever's map this is, it'd be a pretty great outcome for Rep. Ryan Costello (R) in #PA06...keeps both him &amp; Rep. Lloyd Smucker #PA16 on safe ground.
BTW, this isn't necessarily a criticism of @dccc. They've let Lamb run his own race &amp; many Dems calculate that an arms race would turn out far more GOP voters, sinking Lamb. Still, it's a novel strategy.

@gabesmall @skyywise Not an error at all. If the goal is to match the partisanship of PA's seats to the electorate (a 9/9 split), you'd have to gerrymander in Dems' favor. Situation varies from state to state.

Exactly. Prez results far from best way to evaluate this plan. Dems would certainly pick up #PA07, likely pick up #PA06/#PA15 and have great shots at #PA08/#PA11...obviously friendly line choices abound. https://t.co/3if6SUKPSu
My guess: dueling Dem/GOP gerrymandered proposals pave the way for PA Supreme Court &amp; @persily to impose a truly nonpartisan map that splits the difference.
@mattyglesias Dems would keep all 5 of their own seats &amp; increase their odds in #PA03, #PA06, #PA07, #PA08, #PA11, #PA15, #PA18. So if everything went their way in a wave, 12D-6R, but far more likely 9D-9R.
Among the goodies PA Dems included in their proposal: a #PA06 that stretches to include Reading, a York/Harrisburg/Lancaster #PA11, a much better #PA18 for Lamb. Also, splits more counties than the GOP proposal. https://t.co/nBvrKwQiTz
Now if PA Dems REALLY wanted to get crazy they could have drawn #PA11 up to State College like we did here: https://t.co/UbZcX6E21x. But let's not kid ourselves, the PA Dem plan is still (surprise!) a partisan gerrymander.

My latest: 2018's Dem primaries aren't about Hillary vs. Bernie. The real question is whether Dems can nominate candidates who fit their districts. https://t.co/zmT5Io0eH3
In 43 GOP-held seats, there are at least two Dems who entered 2018 with more than $100,000 in the bank. But remember: fiercely fought primaries didn't prevent Republicans from winning the majority in 2010.
Latest House FEC data (sorry, took a while to compile): There are 179 Democratic candidates across 94 GOP-held seats with at least $100,000 in the bank. 		By comparison, there are only 29 GOP candidates across 21 Dem-held seats with at least $100,000 in the bank.
By comparison, current GOP map keeps just 40 of 67 counties whole &amp; splits Montco 5 ways (possible to split just 2 ways). GOP replacement proposal would've kept 52 of 67 counties whole but still split Montco 4 ways.
This map ^ proves it'd be possible for PA SupCt to keep 55 of 67 counties whole, including big ones like Bucks, Delco, Berks, Lancaster, Lehigh, Northampton, Dauphin, Lebanon, York, Erie, Lackawanna, Schuylkill.
@Nate_Cohn That was my best attempt at a @persily impression after studying his past maps but only he knows what approach he'll take.

@jkocher156 See the hypothetical court map I posted yesterday vs the GOP plan
And to Republicans who say the legislature's proposal wasn't a gerrymander - sorry, it was. Used strange shapes to connect Harrisburg/Erie with heavily GOP counties, split Berks/Montco unnecessarily.
And to Dems who argue winning half the votes entitles you to half the seats, that's fine - what you support is called proportional representation. That's not what the PA Supreme Court is asking for here.
Just as GOP shouldn't feel entitled to a 13-5 PA map, Dems shouldn't expect a 9-9 court map either. Given PA's political geography, an 11-7 Trump/Clinton district breakdown might be a reasonable expectation from a maximally compact map.

Other possibilities in a hypothetical PA court map: #PA03 could become a Dem opportunity if Erie is united w/ more of OH border, #PA17 could get a bit more vulnerable for Dems if Easton/East Stroudsburg are taken out. https://t.co/nG8ztwR11p
@Nate_Cohn It would be an Obama '08 district 54%-45%, but not sure about '12. Would've been very close.
Also, in this hypothetical, #PA06 would become a narrow Trump district but #PA08 &amp; #PA15 would become narrow Clinton districts. Dems might also have sliver of hope in an open #PA11 if it's redrawn to unite greater Harrisburg.
In this version, Boyle's home in Somerton would actually be in #PA08 w/ Bucks, but his clearest paths to reelection would be in either #PA01 or #PA13.
Rumor about PA remap: Retiring Rep. Bob Brady (D)'s #PA01 could take in more of NE Philly &amp; Rep. Brendan Boyle (D) could run there, creating two new safe open seats for Dems in Delco (#PA07) &amp; Montco (#PA13). https://t.co/T7DBPMMWGI
GOP Reps. Ryan Costello in #PA06 and Lloyd Smucker #PA16 would get slightly safer under proposed R map - weakening two key Dem pickup opportunities.
Dems would already have a near-sure pickup in #PA07, so this would be a setback for Dems overall. https://t.co/7l2hCo1jk4
This map sacrifices #PA07 to Dems, but otherwise it's just a less aggressive GOP gerrymander. https://t.co/FXVKS1RBDf
Great thread on what happened last night -&gt; https://t.co/7GhxrW13xh
Rep. Rick Nolan (D) retirement doesn't change our Toss Up rating for #MN08 at @CookPolitical. He was already the most vulnerable Dem incumbent in the country.
@Nate_Cohn @DKElections Also, another critical piece of evidence: if incredible MO/OK/WI special performances were purely result of persuasion and not turnout, national generic ballot should be ~D+30. It's ~D+6.

For the first time this cycle, there are 24 GOP-held seats in our @CookPolitical Lean D &amp; Toss Up columns. Theoretically, Dems no longer need to win any seats in our Lean R column to win a majority.
@DKElections You guys generally do great work. But if you don't think at least a part of Dems' amazing 20%+ overperformances in deep-red specials isn't attributable to tiny turnout (when it hasn't been matched in high-turnout scenarios like VA HoD or GA-06), you're smoking something.

New House Ratings at @CookPolitical: 21 rating changes reflect more visible GOP district-level vulnerability, even as generic ballot tightens. https://t.co/rHegfEtrZE https://t.co/FDzi9BAOft
@DKElections PS If you check out our 21 ratings changes tmw, I think you'll see we're taking Dem opportunities in Trump-won CDs pretty damn seriously.
@DKElections It's fairly obvious Dems are taking advantage of tiny turnout in specials in a lot of deep Trump districts in places like MO/OK. That doesn't mean they can't win modestly Trump districts this fall. I just don't think they're gonna win a lot of 65-35 Trump districts, that's all.
@DKElections What's your evidence it's not?
@DKElections Possible both are true
@DKElections And tbh, I really don't think our observations of the landscape are wildly contradictory.
@DKElections That's not my conclusion. I haven't criticized Dems' failure to target Trump HoD seats because I didn't think they were that vulnerable either. My point: the closeness of those districts proves the battlefield is wider than thought prior to November, and that's a lesson for '18.
@DKElections I'll say it again: 17 of 66 VA GOP HoD seats were Clinton seats. Only 23 of 241 GOP House seats are Clinton seats. Dems overperformed everywhere in VA, but House map is just tougher. Also, I still think Dems are slight House faves. Don't really get your attitude.
RT @allymutnick: “You have Democrats who are willing to put their money where their mouth is. These numbers should wake everybody up, even…
This is also the reason why Dems didn't see as huge swings/gains in VA HoD races held in Trump zones. There was a gov race on ballot, so much smaller R voter dropoff.
Turnout in those state leg races has been microscopic, so energized Dems are only ones voting, hence huge swings. Harder for Dems to turn these places blue w/ much higher turnout in November. https://t.co/88Fw9o0mG1

If passed by voters in May, would have big implications for OH lines post-2020. https://t.co/Tv19Rfo4ut
For all the chatter about Nunes's political standing back home, latest FEC data show Dems' task in #CA22 is still pretty daunting:		Rep. Devin Nunes (R): $3.8 million	Andrew Janz (D): $85k (not counting surge in last few days)
FWIW, here's a possibility for western PA. Makes #PA03 &amp; #PA12 marginally more realistic targets for Dems, but still uphill. https://t.co/Bd6ooiGPqN
Here's my example of a PA map fix (drawn a few weeks back) that would vastly help Dems in #PA07 &amp; #PA15, keep #PA06 &amp; #PA08 roughly the same breakdown and slightly strengthen GOP in #PA16 &amp; #PA17. https://t.co/dthIvwNFWF
Overall, though, a win for Dems. Makes it much likelier they'll pick up open #PA07 and #PA15 from GOP. More uncertainty surrounding other districts.
Big news: PA map will be redrawn for November. But keep in mind: Dems already had a shot to win up to 6 GOP seats. A new map will enhance some opportunities, could weaken others. We'll see. https://t.co/L9zE3jzpja
It's already here -&gt; https://t.co/25gnlmUfqX
@stevesingiser There's a growing body of evidence suggesting 16-20 are just as competitive as 1-5
@stevesingiser FWIW, 17 of VA GOP's 66 seats were Clinton districts (26%). Just 23 of House GOP's 241 seats are Clinton districts (9.5%).
@donnermaps Hindsight 20/20, and I certainly didn't expect many of the lower-tier races to be so close. But lesson for '18 is that Josh Cole/Larry Barnett type races should be taken just as seriously as Karrie Delaney/Danica Roem type races. 2/
@donnermaps This is a fantastic chart. It does show, however, that there were ~8 narrow R wins (&lt;10%) where Dems didn't spend nearly as much $$ as some of the best takeover targets they won by a fair margin. 1/
@JimBoston2014 Handel raised &amp; spent about $5.8 million. That was enough to win #GA06 vs. Ossoff's $29.1 million.
My takeaway from 2017 is, if anything, Dems could risk *undershooting* a wave in November. Dems won many of the VA HoD races the party/donors fully funded by wide margins. But many of the races that turned out to be the closest barely got any Dem $$ &amp; fell just short.
Are Dems raising more $$, landing better candidates &amp; competing in vastly more districts than in recent cycles? Absolutely, by light years.		Do they still have a long way to go to take maximum advantage of a great pol environment in 2018? Yes. These things can both be true.
To be clear, a few of these 41 CDs really are unwinnable (e.g., 3 in Utah where McMullin did well). In others, quality Dems just announced. But overall, it makes Dem donors' exuberance for one race look irrational.
New FEC data: of the 100 GOP-held House districts where Trump took &lt;55% in '16, there are still 41 where no Dem has &gt;$100,000 in the bank.		If Dems could take back &amp; reallocate the $29.1 million Jon Ossoff spent losing #GA06, they'd have ~$700k for each of them.

Yes. Because a bright line legal standard on VRA districts doesn't exist, we had to choose an approach for our simulations. We preserved *all* existing 50%+1 minority seats in 5 of our maps, and even maximized them in our maj-min map. I'm proud of our work. https://t.co/zaA0eTLupr

Yup. I wouldn't buy a used (or new) car from someone who tells you the courts have settled on a definitive interpretation of the VRA as it pertains to redistricting. https://t.co/0Kwzo4Pig5
@Nate_Cohn Maybe not, but it's also possible a nonpartisan map could make Cartwright more vulnerable in #PA17 by giving him Pike/Wayne/Susquehanna/Wyoming
Republicans would like 1) #PA06 (Costello/teal) takes in all of Berks &amp; gets 1% safer, 2) #PA16 (Smucker/lime) gets all of Lancaster &amp; gets 3% safer, 3) #PA08 (Fitzpatrick/lavender) basically gets to keep the Bucks district he has.
Democrats would like 1) #PA07 (OPEN/Meehan/gray) turns into a safe Dem seat, 2) #PA15 (OPEN/Dent/orange) moves from Lean R to true Toss Up, 3) #PA17 (Cartwright/dark purple) loses Schuylkill Co./gets a bit safer.
Here's my version of a possible "compromise" map of eastern PA w/ more regular lines &amp; several things for both parties in Harrisburg to like: https://t.co/oeePJXakPo
Any chance PA Republicans &amp; Gov. Wolf (D) would agree to a normal-looking compromise map that sacrificed open Meehan (R) &amp; Dent (R) seats but mildly helped Costello (R), Smucker (R) &amp; Cartwright (D)? Hmm...
@SeanTrende would argue that's also a bit different dynamic. low turnout, etc.
@SeanTrende Nah, just counting retirements/runs for other office.
Wow - you've got to go back 28 years to find the last time a prez's party has successfully defended an open House seat the prez lost 2 years earlier (0/20 since). Just a terrible omen for Rs trying to hold open Clinton districts in '18. https://t.co/VHvCSo7K6U
@JRodinDC @NRafter not counting specials
Answer: I'm still not sure, but the party in WH has batted 0% in these situations since 1994 (0/20). Doesn't bode well for GOP chances of holding 6 (so far) open Clinton districts: #AZ02, #CA39, #CA49, #FL27, #PA07, #WA08. https://t.co/5fFwSZ1Hvd
@blamasters Good guess, but Clinton won both narrowly!
Trivia: in midterm cycles, when's the last time a president's party has successfully defended an open House seat the president *failed* to carry 2 years prior?
@DemocraticLuntz You're right, I just realized that I've been going about assembling this wrong. I'm going to reassess and correct the stat.
For the 1st time this cycle, the ratio of House Republicans not running for reelection in Clinton districts (6/23) is now (barely) higher than the ratio of Dems not running in Trump districts (3/12).
@_justinlevitt_ @s As much as I wish our population variations/VRA maps could have conformed to strict legal standards, that wasn't possible in DRA. But this interactive is designed to illustrate tradeoffs between various approaches to redistricting, and I'm proud of how it turned out.
@_justinlevitt_ +1
@_justinlevitt_ Fair point. Had it been up to me alone, I'd have included all the details down to streets. But it was a team effort. I still hope someone will use the shapefiles to enable further evaluation.
@_justinlevitt_ If our "compact" map isn't your map, that's 100% fair. However, I'd challenge that it would predictably lead to less representation of minority communities -- I think that's up for debate. If I thought it would, I wouldn't advocate for it.

@DavidWayneEvans because the current map's breakdown of Dem/GOP leaning seats actually matches the statewide proportions of the vote.
@marcatracy @mattyglesias @FiveThirtyEight correct, as does the VRA
By prioritizing compactness/following county borders, we were able to reduce the total length of boundaries dividing states into districts by 27% &amp; split counties 39% less often than the current map.
Many Dems don't realize that as bad off as they are in some GOP-drawn states, it could actually be worse. We turned the GOP's 12R-4D Ohio advantage into 14R-2D: https://t.co/IIvOLI9P8p https://t.co/I9kY9j89sa

Will Dems benefit from a map makeover? Of course. But does it change priors by 4-5 seats in favor of Dems? No. More likely 1-2.

Here's a stat that should be telling on the Royce/Issa seats: in the last 3 midterms, in situations where incumbents have retired from districts carried by the opposite party in the most recent prez election, the incumbent's party has batted 0% trying to hold it (0/10).
@MiltShook @BautistaBomb Wrong. It's actually the map NC Dems enacted in 1992!
@MiltShook Lol except that's *not* the GOP gerrymander map.
RT @nathanlgonzales: Republicans drew more seats because they won more legislative elections. Democrats would have done the same thing. htt…
Here's the truth, whether you like it or not: Republicans haven't really gerrymandered more egregiously/aggressively than Democrats. They just had 4x as much power to do so in 2011, hence our current conversation.
Yes, it's true that SCOTUS/Bush DOJ maj-min maximization doctrine led to the Rorschach versions of #NC01 &amp; #NC12 in the '92 Dem map at right. But this exercise pretty clearly shows which party's won the messaging war WRT gerrymandering.
Facepalm... 🤦‍♂️ https://t.co/fv8VF9xEvv
And I don't think people have fully priced in how much *worse* things could get for House Republicans in the next 300 days. https://t.co/79UCwpX8vN
GOP Rep. Darrell Issa retirement isn't as big a game changer as Royce was, but it moves #CA49 from Toss Up to Lean Democratic at @CookPolitical https://t.co/5PMKxtzvng
FWIW, if this ruling does stand, Dems would be in terrific position to pick up House seats in the Triad &amp; Raleigh, and perhaps Wilmington. https://t.co/wbZ6z0Ndeo
@PoliticsWolf Actually, if you read my tweets, I've never made such a claim.
This -&gt; https://t.co/5DjedwSJkB
@CRB1079 The Bush Sr. DOJ did require maximization of maj-min seats everywhere in '92, hence #NC01 &amp; #NC12. But Dems still did their best to distribute their voters favorably, hence the tortured shapes of #NC05 &amp; #NC07.
Fact: If 2018 Dems win *every* state/district Clinton either a) won or b) lost by 17% or less, they could pick up 106 House seats &amp; still lose 2 Senate seats. https://t.co/wlFbNs34Ub
@alanblinder FYI, Alan - you're showing a picture of the 1992 map drawn by NC Dems. Can you fix it to show the current GOP gerrymander?
Dear @alanblinder/@nytimes,		In the interest in truth in reporting on gerrymandering, please feature a picture of the NC GOP's current gerrymander to go w/ this story. This is literally a picture of the gerrymander NC Dems drew in 1992.		Respectfully,	Dave https://t.co/xZQ1Q9k3Mk
@RandiLittle20 @BautistaBomb So which one do you think is which?
@davidgaliel @YePirateLiberal nope

Shelby County, AL (Birmingham suburbs):		2016: Trump 73,020, Clinton 22,977	2017: Moore 36,424, Jones 27,251		#ALSEN
Trump voters in rural white counties didn't move much towards Jones, but they utterly failed to turn out for Moore. #ALSEN
It turns out there are still limits to partisanship. #ALSEN
No question: Urban Alabama &amp; the Black Belt came through for Doug Jones. #ALSEN
Damning statement from SLF's Steven Law: “This is a brutal reminder that candidate quality matters regardless of where you are running. Not only did Steve Bannon cost us a critical Senate seat in one of the most R states in the country, but he also dragged POTUS into his fiasco.”
Breaking: AP calls the race for Jones. I'm still waiting on more Jefferson, but Jones very likely to prevail. #ALSEN
All of Tuscaloosa in, Jones wins there by 16%. We estimated he needed to win by 5%. #ALSEN
If Jones prevails, as looks increasingly likely, a major reason would be that the black share of Alabama vote is way up vs. past elections. #ALSEN
Selma in. 75% Jones. Tied ballgame. #ALSEN
Looking really good for Jones, but we still don't know enough about the nature of what's out in Birmingham to say anything w/ certainty. #ALSEN
Good areas remaining for Jones:		Montgomery	Jefferson	Dallas	Mobile (?)	Tuscaloosa (?)		Good areas remaining for Moore:		Baldwin		I *think* Jones is the favorite...but need to see more Jefferson. #ALSEN
Still no Selma. Not *that* many votes, but will be great for Jones. #ALSEN
Amazing: turnout is at 72%-77% of '16 presidential race in heavily black counties, but just 55%-60% in rural white counties. Black voters punching above their weight tonight &amp; giving Jones a chance. #ALSEN
This thing is headed for a photo finish. #ALSEN
For example, Covington Co. (76% Moore) fully reported and only at 57% of 2016 turnout. That's a very pro-Jones turnout differential. #ALSEN
Another strong Jones turnout in the Black Belt: Bullock Co., where turnout is 72% of presidential. Not seeing comparable in Moore zones. #ALSEN
Folks: these Jefferson numbers are going to narrow. We don't know how good it really is for Jones. #ALSEN
We still don't have a full county reporting in major metro Alabama. Big unknowns: Shelby, Baldwin, Mobile, Montgomery. #ALSEN
The county-by-county margins point towards a really tight race. The turnout, however, points ever-so-slightly to Jones. #ALSEN
Turnout is down relative to what I expected just about everywhere counting's done, but that's especially true in heavy Moore areas. #ALSEN
Yep. https://t.co/vyBof5qVXO
Wow. Look at turnout in Perry Co. (Black Belt). It's at 76% of 2016 turnout and Jones is winning by 59%. Meanwhile, Houston Co. (Moore base) at only 58% of 2016 turnout. Jones has to like that. #ALSEN
Moore doing better than we expected in his base, and Jones doing better than we expected in his base. What else is new: it's a base election. #ALSEN
A bit of good news for Jones: Russell is now all reporting. He needed to win by about 26% there, and he won it by 30%. #ALSEN
This race is very, very close. #ALSEN
Limestone now 25/26 precincts, and Moore lead shrinks back down to 19%. The reason it's so difficult to tell what's happening so far: Alabama's precincts are so racially polarized and quick swings are the rule, not the exception.
Tonight feels like a rollercoaster. Now, you might rather be Moore than Jones. #ALSEN
Jones losing Houston Co. by 28% w/ 18/28 precincts reporting. Our estimate says he needs to be within 17% of Moore there. #ALSEN
The last few minutes' results have been pretty good for Moore. Now back to a dead heat. #ALSEN
RT @McCormackJohn: Now with 77% of Limestone reporting, Moore ahead by 25 points there https://t.co/dKiOEeBCeM
Just like that, Limestone Co. ticks up to a 22% Moore lead, right on pace for what he needs there. #ALSEN
So far, you'd rather be Doug Jones than Roy Moore. #ALSEN
Half of Limestone reporting, Moore up 18% there (likely needs +22%). So far, Jones hitting slightly more benchmarks than Moore. #ALSEN
So far, Doug Jones is holding his own in rural Alabama. Still extremely early. #ALSEN
Very early, positive news for Jones: he received 31% of the vote in one Cullman County precinct. This is important because Hillary Clinton failed to break 15% of the vote in *any* Cullman precinct in 2016, save for one black majority precinct that's deep blue.
One thing you're not going to lose $$ betting on tonight: a much, much wider urban vs. rural divide than past close Alabama races.

The last week, #ALSEN has felt a little more like '15 #LAGOV (when an above-average Dem beat a damaged Vitter) than '16 Pres. But this is federal office, and tonight I'm just not at all sure.
@Nate_Cohn @CookPolitical That's a fair criticism. I've revised model slightly to account for your wisdom: https://t.co/mk2f3mkv8l
@Nate_Cohn @CookPolitical Pt well taken but my model doesn't have black share anywhere near 39% b/c some Jones votes in majority black counties are whites crossing over. Still, I think a Jones win scenario involves a higher AA share than the file.
@Nate_Cohn @CookPolitical Keep in mind, '16 turnout in rural black AL counties was pretty weak relative to '12.
@Nate_Cohn @CookPolitical Obama got 9,045 votes in Macon in '12. So, with a huge Dem push to turn out Tuskegee, I don't think 7k Jones votes in Macon (about what Clinton got) is *that* far-fetched.

Finally, an election where midday turnout reports actually told us something meaningful about the results.
In 2011, Dems got to draw VA's Senate map &amp; ended up losing it. Ironic twist: GOP's House "dummymander" could now cost them the HoD.
Irony: if GOP had drawn a few more Dem "vote sinks" in places like PWC, Henrico &amp; VB in '11 remap, they'd have held their majority tonight.
Dems' VA House of Delegates pickups (so far) by geography:		Prince William: 5	Fairfax: 2	Loudoun: 2	----------------------	Henrico: 2	Virginia Beach: 2	Chesterfield: 1	Blacksburg: 1

Across VA today, raw votes cast were up 16% vs. '13. 		In Charlottesville, raw votes cast were up 31%.
Here's a handy primer from NCSL on what could happen if there's a 50/50 House of Delegates (it happened in 1997): https://t.co/W1bgyHBfYT
VA DELEGATES COUNT: 48D, 47R. 5 seats to decide control:		#HD27 (Chesterfield): Del. Robinson (R) up by 129 votes.	#HD28 (F'burg): Thomas (R) up by 86.	#HD40 (Fairfax): Tanner (D) up by 68.	#HD68 (Richmond): Adams (D) up by 316.	#HD94 (Newport News): Del. Yancey (R) up by 12.
CORRECTION: I added an extra seat to GOP's tally. 48D, 47R, 5 still too close to call (including #HD28, where GOP margin is 86 votes).
BREAKING: Del. Glenn Davis (R) has defeated Veronica Coleman (D) in Virginia Beach's #HD84. New count: 48D, 48R, 4 still too close to call.
BREAKING: Cheryl Turpin (D) has unseated Del. Rocky Holcomb (R) in Virginia Beach's #HD85, reversing the Jan. special election result. Dems +14, need 3 more for control.
In a sign of just how bad tonight was for VA GOP, a Dem is within 47 votes in retiring House Speaker Bill Howell's #HD28. Likely headed to recount.

Del. Tony Wilt (R) is currently *down* 8% in Harrisonburg's #HD26, which voted for Trump by 9%, but a few very red Rockingham Co. precincts left.
You can't really look at tonight's results and conclude that Democrats are anything other than the current favorites to pick up the U.S. House in 2018.
In a 7th race, Larry Barnett (D) still has a great chance at upset vs. Del. Roxann Robinson (R) in Chesterfield's #HD27. He's down 4 (!!!) votes w/ only absentees left. Absentees should be friendly to him.

Projection: Justin Fairfax (D) has been elected VA Lt. Gov., defeating Jill Holtzman Vogel (R).
Pattern: Gillespie matching Trump's %s in a lot of red strongholds, but not his turnout. Meanwhile, seeing big enthusiasm edge in Dem strongholds.
Northam's lead looks decisive enough that it will sweep the entire Dem ticket (Fairfax, Herring) into office. #VAGOV
Projection: Ralph Northam (D) has been elected next governor of VA, defeating Ed Gillespie (R). #VAGOV
This is looking like a pretty early night, folks. #VAGOV
Bull precinct, Buchanan Co., deep in the heart of SWVA's Trump country: 		Gillespie: 178	Northam: 37		In 2013, Cuccinelli won 197-55. Gillespie's getting the support level he needs, but not the turnout he needs there.
So far, so good for Ralph Northam. #VAGOV

Remember: Look below #VAGOV results. If Dems pick up 10+ seats in House of Delegates, it'd be a good sign they're on track for the House in '18.

Based on various reports, VA turnout seems a bit up vs. '13 in places w/ lots of college whites, a bit down in heavily AA areas. Mixed bag.
@ElectProject That's a pretty impressive Cville number for 1pm.

@Nate_Cohn @ForecasterEnten Very cool. We're not too far off from each other. I'd guess Gillespie does a sliver better in inner DC burbs, but we'll see who's right!

@VA11independent theoretically, someone could vote for a write-in
@NBCNews The difference between a good night &amp; great night for Dems is whether they pick up seats OUTSIDE NoVa: Richmond, VA Beach, Blacksburg, etc.
@NBCNews Whereas the gubernatorial race is more personality-driven, HoD races driven more by voter attitudes towards the parties. Better '18 gauge.
@NBCNews Bottom line: if Democrats pick up more than 10 seats in the House of Delegates, it could be a sign they're on track to pick up the House.
New piece is up at @NBCNews: Why Virginia Statehouse races could hold key to the 2018 midterms. https://t.co/F76m6s6xki
Final thought: what if a few confused colonial interpreters in Alexandria &amp; Williamsburg put John Adams (R) over the top in the AG race?
It's not up by as much in heavily AA cities like Hampton/Portsmouth/Danville. But it's also not up by as much in rural/GOP localities.
One positive sign for Northam is that election interest is up vs. '13 in Dem/Latino localities like Manassas/PWC. https://t.co/LkLwnUAJzM
If Gillespie can match his '14 Sen %s in Northern VA and Cuccinelli's '13 Gov %s in rural VA, he'll be governor. Off-year VA ≠ prez. VA.
In my view, that means Northam must count on overperformance in Tidewater (home base) &amp; higher Dem engagement across board thanks to Trump.
It's also difficult to see Northam doing much better than Clinton in rural VA given confederate monuments drama/muddled pipeline position.
There's real support for Gillespie in Northern VA that didn't exist for Cuccinelli or Trump. Being a DC insider not a liability in Fairfax.
RCP avg/result in off-year VA:		'09: McDonnell (R) +13.4/+17.5	'13: McAuliffe (D) +6.7/+2.5	'14: Warner (D) +9.7/+0.8		Northam (D): +2.8/??

@CTIronman True. The shortest-splitline part of the algorithm would address the R gerrymander.
And to avoid dividing communities, require algorithm to limit county/city splits to the minimum necessary to achieve equipopulous districts.
Not that it's remotely in play in this SCOTUS case. But If you're a programmer and think you could write this algorithm, I'd love to talk.
Here's a standard that can fit in a tweet: Require use of an algorithm to draw shortest line(s) necessary to achieve equipopulous districts.
If SCOTUS adopts the Efficiency Gap, these are just several questions that could be litigated ferociously in courts for many years to come.
Do you have to wait for an election to take place before invalidating a gerrymander? And what about Ds/Rs who defy their district's leans?
Another layer of complexity: which elections do you use to calculate the gap? The most recent cycle? Most recent 5 cycles? Cong/pres?
Terrific explanation of the Efficiency Gap's pros/cons. A real con: it has a hard time telling what's gerrymandering vs. natural sorting. https://t.co/ClXkKiXwbQ

@JudgeNathan I stand by it 100%. 94 counties = a historic level of geographic concentration that negatively impacts Democrats' ability to win power.
@Nate_Cohn Mostly agree, with caveat that given power to redraw all 435 CDs, GOP could still draw itself a few more safe seats than Dems right now.
They'd also only carry 36 Senate seats, down from Clinton's 40 https://t.co/VASZLr1q10
@Nate_Cohn Agree it's not a big deal in the E.C., but would argue it's a pretty big problem in the House, esp. if other side has power to draw lines.

@ElectProject Actually, that's not my premise. Show me data to refute yesterday's @FiveThirtyEight article. I'll wait.
@tucker_doherty @xenocryptsite would definitely agree w that after the last hour. whew
My point is not that complicated, guys: Democrats' historic geographic concentration is negatively impacting their ability to win power.
@tucker_doherty @xenocryptsite my point is Democrats' historic geographic overconcentration is hurting their ability to win power. The end.

@rickhasen And to be clear, I'm not advocating tossing entire Section 2 VRA. I'm talking about algorithms superseding its redistricting interpretation.
@rickhasen Don't get me wrong, though. As long as redistricting is in the hands of partisans, Section 2 is needed. What I support is ending both.
@rickhasen Yes, actually. Whereas it was once essential to electing minority candidates of choice, it's now suppressing new opportunities.
@NavyYardPirate It would create more 35%-50% minority districts where a candidate of choice would have excellent chance at winning both primary &amp; general.
Would this approach preserve most grotesquely-shaped maj-min districts? No. 		Would it increase minority representation? I'd argue, yes.
This approach is one of many partisan-blind solutions. Another: @boooolson's compactness optimization algorithm. https://t.co/ldLXKCel6U https://t.co/m9UypqUuAD
@mattyglesias Because, why not? I'm open to ideas. This just strikes me as the most straightforward approach &amp; far fairer than what we have now.
It's not that hard: redistricting is a problem computers can now solve. Draw the shortest line(s) needed to achieve equipopulous districts.
@Nate_Cohn @PoliticsWolf As Nate said, wouldn't argue there's anything concretely wrong w/ any of your maps. There are infinite maps we could each argue are "fair."
My belief: partisanship shouldn't play a role in redistricting, period. https://t.co/qqcQ2oOhLh
@mattyglesias How so? Given today's levels of polarization in many states, you'd have to actively gerrymander to achieve a proportional outcome.
@xenocryptsite Sure. Look at Jowei Chen's work running 1000s of computer-simulated maps and take the median GOP seat share vs. vote share.
@PoliticsWolf The point being, this is all subjective. I can just as easily propose maps that are "fair" to my eye that give Dems +8, not +19.
@PoliticsWolf I totally get that. I'm just questioning whether those line changes would've been sufficient to alter '12 results there.
@PoliticsWolf I'd argue plenty of the outcomes in those maps are shaky. For example, how are #PA03 #WI01 or #WI07 blue?
In other words, Ds need 24 seats to take back House. In a world without gerrymandering, they'd need ~12. But they'd still need ~52% of vote.
Rs won 4% more seats than votes for House in '12, '14 &amp; '16. In my estimates, neutral/random maps bring that gap down to 2% - about half.
The reality of both parties' geographical distribution means neutral/algorithmic maps would result in an inflated GOP seat share vs. votes.
I'm open to persuasion on the "efficiency gap." But main drawback: it has a hard time measuring what's gerrymandering vs. what's clustering.
It's misleading to run vote % vs. seat % data and call it a gerrymandering analysis. Dems' over-concentration has dramatically worsened too.

Dem primary votes in VA just surpassed 500k. GOP votes at 350k. Can someone map out Gillespie's path in November for me? I don't see it.
For Corey Stewart fans banking on that last Liberty U precinct erasing deficit, remember '16 results: 1. Rubio 2. Cruz 3. Carson 4. Trump
Projection: Ed Gillespie (R) has won the GOP primary for #VAGOV, defeating Corey Stewart (R). But wow, was it close.
Also, Loudoun/Prince William/Henrico are no longer "suburban bellwether" counties.
Another new thing people need to get used to: VA is not a swing state.
Projection: Jill Vogel (R) has won the GOP Lt. Gov. primary, defeating Bryce Reeves (R). She'll face Justin Fairfax (D) in the fall.
Ed Gillespie's lead back up to 1,400 w/ 90% reporting, still lots of Fairfax/Lynchburg to count. Looking like he'll barely hang on. #VAOGV
One thing working in Gillespie's favor: he's doing really well (56%) in Lynchburg, and Liberty U's huge precinct hasn't reported yet.
Dem turnout in the '09 #VAGOV primary was 319k. It's already at 431k, with most of Fairfax's votes still out. Can't deny the enthusiasm gap.
Still, you have to think Fairfax's absentees, which usually skew pro-establishment, will keep Gillespie ahead by a nose in the end. https://t.co/y9g2WEpckK
You can't even bank on Fairfax County as Gillespie's great savior tonight. He's up just 7% there w/ half of precincts reporting. #VAGOV

The perception, at least in Northern VA, was that the Dem primary was by far the more interesting race. May have hurt Gillespie. #VAGOV
Current #VAGOV GOP primary results:		Ed Gillespie 125,749 (43.5%)	Corey Stewart 124,728 (43.1%)		81% of precincts reporting.
Hard to say who that favors on balance, but Fairfax County certainly favorable for Gillespie. The Liberty U vote will matter lots. #VAGOV
Gillespie clinging to 1,700 vote lead in #VAGOV. Big areas still out: Fairfax, Lynchburg, Norfolk, Powhatan, Roanoke, Winchester.
The best thing to happen to Corey Stewart's campaign, which was recently on life support: New Orleans/Charlottesville monument fights.
People were shocked when VA's GOP nominated E.W. Jackson, then Trump. Stewart? Folks, these aren't aberrations. This is today's GOP.
Irony: Corey Stewart (R) would be a nobody if Prince William elections coincided w/ prez races. Trump lost PWC by 22% last November. #VAGOV
In '16 Prez primary, 57% of VA voters pulled a GOP ballot. 		So far in '17 Gov primary, 57% are pulling a Dem ballot.
Ed Gillespie (R) lead narrows to 1,700 votes (0.7%) w/ Prince William (Stewart base) now reporting. Wow. #VAGOV
Imagine if Corey Stewart had actually had a decent run in VA GOP politics instead of grew up in MN/gotten fired from Trump campaign.
Gillespie's current lead in #VAGOV R primary almost entirely attributable to Arlington/Alexandria/Fairfax. Think about that for a minute.
There's a new name for the voters most people thought of as VA's moderate Republicans a few years ago: Democrats.
Corey Stewart (R), Confederacy nostalgic running to right of Trump, trailing Ed Gillespie (R) 44%-42% w/ 53% of precincts reporting. #VAGOV
Even if Ed Gillespie (R) makes it thru #VAGOV primary, bad news for him is Corey Stewart (R) wing of party is now something to reckon with.
VA's African-American voters also making huge impact in #LtGov race, where Justin Fairfax (D) has defeated Susan Platt (D).
A huge reason why Northam won tonight: AA voters. Whether it's skepticism towards "Bernie wing" of party, I'll leave to others to debate.
@ForecasterEnten Or, that's why you don't look at this poll: https://t.co/pj9jtIFmrx
And it's not even really that close. We're probably looking at double digits. Cville hasn't come in, but neither has Norfolk.
The Washington Post's editorial page preaches to the choir. In this case of the #VAGOV Dem primary, the electorate consists of the choir.
Projection: Ralph Northam (D) has won the #VAGOV Dem primary, defeating Tom Perriello (D).
Surprise, surprise: Corey Stewart (R) may be the more interesting insurgent tonight as Tom Perriello's (D) chances fade. #VAGOV
Wow. Northam at 61% in Arlington and 57% in Fairfax so far. Not looking good AT ALL for Perriello in the early going. #VAGOV
Statewide, Northam (D) leading Perriello (D) 52%-48%, but much of that is rural where Perriello is doing well. More upside for Northam.
So far, Ralph Northam (D) at:		84% in Hampton 	70% Newport News	66% Suffolk	55% Richmond	51% Loudoun		He has to like those numbers. #VAGOV
Northam (D) leads Perriello (D) 59%-41% in first heavily AA precinct in Henrico Co. Need to see more, but that bodes well for him. #VAGOV
Early results indicate very close Dem race for Lt. Gov.: Justin Fairfax (D) leading Susan Platt (D) 47%-42%, doing well in heavy AA areas.

First precinct in #VAGOV Dem primary is from Pittsylvania County, where Perriello leads w/ 64%. But that's his old #VA05 seat, so expected.
If there's a guide for #VAGOV Dem primary, it's probably '13 LG. But Northam needs to do better in NoVa to offset Perriello's Cville base.
The last contested VA Dem gubernatorial primary in '09 drew 319,168 voters. I think you can expect considerably more than that today.
America's corporate royalty lives in #CA45 #GA06 #IL06 #KS03 #MN03 #NJ07 #NJ11 #TX07 #TX32 #VA10 - districts Rs need to watch in '18.
@Nate_Cohn #MTAL special turnout was 74% of '16 general. Applied to #GA06 that would be ~245k. So 250k very much in the ballpark.

So far in #KS04, #GA06, #MTAL, Dems have won an average of 72% of Clinton's 2016 vote totals, GOPers 56% of Trump's.
Black Voters Aren’t Turning Out For The Post-Obama Democratic Party by @PatrickRuffini https://t.co/qoprKgb0Ii
In #MTAL, Quist (D) received 94% of Clinton's vote total, while Gianforte (R) received 68% of Trump's. I think this is a problem for GOP.
Here's what I know: several polls showed Gianforte (R) doing better w/ E-Day voters than absentees. In the end, he did slightly worse. #MTAL
To clarify, this is estimated two-party vote in a "neutral" environment via @CookPolitical PVI vs. actual two-party vote in specials.
Generic Dem/Actual Dem, 2017 House specials:		#KS04: 35%/47% (+12%)	#GA06: 42%/49% (+7%)	#MTAL: 39%/47% (+8%)		Median '18 House seat: 47%/??
#MTAL w/ all 681 precincts fully reporting:		Gianforte (R) 50.2%	Quist (D) 44.1%		Missoula/Glacier narrowed gap about 1% overnight.

Bottom line: given the absentee results, it was never going to be realistic for Quist to erase his deficit on Election Day. #MTAL

Projection: Greg Gianforte (R) elected to Congress in #MTAL special, defeating Rob Quist (D).
@KSoltisAnderson .Gianforte
Quist is doing decently in much of the west, including Kalispell/Missoula. But he's just not keeping up in Billings/Great Falls. #MTAL
Still, it's unlikely to compensate for Quist's weak performances elsewhere, particularly in Billings. #MTAL
Flathead County just reported in 22k votes. Not bad for Quist! Gianforte leads there 55%-41%, trailing his '16 Gov. slightly. #MTAL
Right now, Gianforte is up 48%-46%-6% in #MTAL. Hmm...where have I seen that set of numbers before?... https://t.co/j58GawYdY7
Based on everything I'm seeing, I'd guess Gianforte ends up winning this thing in the 5%-10% range. #MTAL

Quist up 62%-29% in Deer Lodge, where Bullock won 70%-26%. Not looking like a good night for Dems here. #MTAL
Quist really has to keep things a lot closer in Billings to have a chance. So far, he's way under Bullock's numbers. #MTAL

In Montana, the Dem accusation that "NJ billionaire" Gianforte blocked stream access on his property was/is a BIG deal for voters. #MTAL
And it's not just the assault - it's the clumsy/far-fetched denial and refusal to quickly apologize for losing cool under stress. #MTAL
Neither GOP nor indies have favorable attitudes towards media - esp. a UK paper - but assault plays into an existing Gianforte narrative.
Pre-assault, GOP consultants emphasized that Gianforte's image started #MTAL at 1-to-1, and a big part of that was perceived arrogance.
It's a lot easier to brush something like this off if you had a favorable impression of the candidate. But '16 badly damaged Gianforte.
Here's why "Tough guy plays well in Wild West" may not hold in this case: voters already didn't like Gianforte, going back to '16. #MTAL
If Quist wins #MTAL tonight, I'd expect his coalition to be a bit more urban/less rural than Bullock's given federal nature of race.

@JMilesColeman I just tried using Durham &amp; Pitt as the only split counties in #NC01 and couldn't get it past 46% AA VAP...
@JMilesColeman Under my rules, I'm pretty sure NC GOP would dump all of Orange/Durham into #NC01 and move #NC04 entirely within Wake to comply.
@JMilesColeman I think that's close to the mark. What's the AA CVAP in #NC01 under that map?
Would Minimum Split Districting eradicate partisan gerrymandering? Of course not. But would it outlaw the most egregious cases? Absolutely.
MSD could boost minority voting strength in long-term. Current glut of packed, gerrymandered CDs hurts minority representation overall.
It might actually look a lot like the 2016 plan. Still pro-GOP, but maybe 4th CD entirely within Wake &amp; more compact/competitive. https://t.co/Km5S2xBspz
If you can create a compact minority-majority seat adhering to these rules, it must be drawn. If not, too bad: gerrymandering not allowed.
Moreover, if subdivisions are large enough, full CDs must be drawn within. For example, Wake/Mecklenburg get their own, no ifs/ands/buts.
MSD would require states to adhere to the absolute minimum # of county/city/precinct splits needed to create equally populous districts.
But here's an idea for a bright line, SCOTUS: mandate "Minimum Split Districting" to curtail most egregious racial/partisan gerrymandering.
As von Spakovsky notes, SCOTUS's jurisprudence on redistricting has long been hopelessly vague, contradictory, and unworkable.
NC's GOP map was an obvious partisan gerrymander. Dems convinced judges it was a racial gerrymander -- in order to achieve a partisan aim.
As best I can tell, the Supreme Court is just super-confused by redistricting. And it's been that way for decades. https://t.co/l3LH6xbBix

@CookPolitical Dems need to be *way* outperforming in specials, b/c it's generally easier to flip an open seat than defeat an incumbent. So far, they are.
Keep in mind, Rs to underperform @CookPolitical PVI by 4% on average to lose the House. If special average stays ~7%, bodes well for Dems.
Cook PVI generic R % vs. actual % in '17 House specials:		#KS04: 65/53 (-12)	#GA06 (I): 58/51 (-7)	#MTAL: 61/?	#GA06 (II): 58/?	#SC05: 59/?
Lots of areas w/ high levels of education were already voting Dem. The ones that migrated Dem this time included lots of country club Rs. https://t.co/OXx9aoM7e8
