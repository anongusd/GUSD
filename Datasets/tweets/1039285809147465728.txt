@AriaaJaeger If liberals are so, well, liberal... why can't they open their hearts and support our issue, too? We can have drones and be environmentally sound. There just seems to be so much to lose and so little to gain by just allowing whomever wants in the ability to do so.
@AriaaJaeger Ma'am, we're probably really different people but I really hope you consider the wall. We do have a decades long legacy of human trafficking and violence we could help fix immediately with relatively little money. #AmericaFirst #DrainTheSwamp¬† #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall

@BornaTroll The Jews will have Israel. As a Christian, I believe that. But that doesn't mean we have to get involved politically. America can be neutral and focus solely on her own people.

@Mary78127111 @realDonaldTrump He loves his country and works tirelessly to protect us.
@RepMcGovern @RashidaTlaib @realDonaldTrump Trump's success came from never giving up. As a wealthy man, he has a perspective on the international banking system most don't have. If only one out of ten businesses takes off, you could be rich. He's done so many interesting things for the country. Try harder.
@gtconway3d Whether you like the man or not, he does have a crazy life experience. I have my disagreements with the man, but I still respect his love for this country. America needed someone like him. He's very self aware. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@QuantumSane @Cone41 @realDonaldTrump People are hardly being locked in cages. There is a real humanitariam crisis because of the border situation. This is bigger than just Trump. This is decades of failed policy from every administration.

@FJBoccadoro @mkraju I hope more active duty can come home and serve in some capacity on our border. I think that's a wise way to handle both the shutdown and war effort.
@FJBoccadoro @mkraju Yes. If its a national emergency maybe Trump can get the Army Corps of Engineers to build it with those tied up funds or debt. Slash through some red tape. He could start the project and leave it in a way that compels them to legislate. But that's the nuclear option.
@LikeTheeMonth @TheAlanvargas The drugs, music and media are all influencing us. We're being trained. Some people have violent triggers. I think some of these sickos are groomed for years.

@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse I hope something substancial is decided. It's becoming a nightmare in America. That wall could keep America going for another one hundred years. I really hope you win and save the Republic. Those of whom that are against it have been duped. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall

@DrDavidDuke Could I please have a run down on who the yellow vests are? I've heard nationalist, but some of their demands seem socialist. Hard to follow. Thanks.
@GKMC18 @davidhogg111 @chancetherapper @kamilalyciaa @ladieversatile @OrtegaAlySammy @sabaPIVOT @MalcolmLondon @heyo__tayo @Anthony87599324 @melody_madi I pray we as a nation can come together and educate our youth to love one another. Such a lack of respect for human life.
@Smudge0199 @ScottSell5 @waywornwoodshop @gndowd @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Geographically we are all the Americas, correct. But, The United States of America is a sovereign constitutional republic. We operate as a different state. Many considerations have been made for both the environment and wildlife.
@PauloMartins10 @jairbolsonaro Thank you for breng the kind of leader to show the world the truth. Please defend Brazil and Western Civilization.
@MitziRuth72 why isnt trump your president?
@EmpressMelissa4 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump How will immigration reform help an undefendable border?
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Trump is a hero for standing up to tyrany. He's doing the right thing in spite of not having the majority. Democrats once said they stood up for the little guy. Now you all are asleep while the hoardes are attacking #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@MFOL_California @davidhogg111 Stop marching? Don't make yourselves a target. Be with your loved ones at home.
@mwrab @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats Trump can and may do this as long as he is President.
@MolonLabeTN @realDailyWire Nothing in American politics is as important as the wall.
@realDailyWire @tedcruz I don't like this idea. It reeks of globalist meddling. Its the stench of half bakes logic. Instead of arbitrary eroding the Constitution, let people suffer the consequenses of their ignorance. The blame goes to a lazy, uninvolved citizenry. Vote no.
@VP @WhiteHouse @SecNielsen @POTUS No money is spent rightfully unless it's for the interest of our people. We must secure the border now and forever. God no doubt has chosen you two, so please don't waver. #KeepItShutDown #BuildTheWall
@davidhogg111 More guns, more walls. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@Ready1M Why?
@SenatorRomney @MittRomney We need to elevate that border wall! #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@shannonrwatts @davidhogg111 @NRA @MomsDemand This is not an issue. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@ScottSell5 @waywornwoodshop @gndowd @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump There will be no America without a wall. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall

@marcorubio You need to be posting snippets of the Constitution. You're such a farce. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@DavidFoody @FJBoccadoro @RepAdamSchiff Haha, funny. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@FJBoccadoro @realDonaldTrump It will be the most work they've done their whole career üí™ü§£üëå#KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@caroline3167 @FJBoccadoro @robportman What work would they have been doing? This is a dream come true.  #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@RonPaul We didn't listen. #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@FJBoccadoro @realDonaldTrump What exactly would he impeached for? He wouldn't get the votes anyway. Isn't this just more Democratic obstruction?
@VP #KeepItShutDown #maga #BuildTheWall
@realDonaldTrump Keep fighting for America. Please don't cave in.   #BuildTheWall #KeepItShutDown #maga
@realDonaldTrump The Democrats have been totally exposed. They stand naked as nothing more as a liason for an international clique that wants America to lose its sovereignty. If we don't have a border we don't have a country. #BuildTheWall #KeepItShutDown
@Divamanda23 @MittRomney Funny. There won't be a wall. This country is too polarized.
@realDonaldTrump #buildthewall
@realDonaldTrump Please, don't taunt the man. We elected you to "win" for us. I hope maybe he could be an asset to negotiate with Democrats.
@MittRomney Governor Romney, when the time comes please put your differences aside with President Trump and support his national security agenda. These are dire times for America. No institution could defend us better now than a wall. We can only be United so long as we're sovereign.
@FJBoccadoro @Evy_reid @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats @DHSgov I will. Don't take my tone as belligerent, please. My understanding is that money can only be spent a certain way. I don't know.
@FJBoccadoro @Evy_reid @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats Well, then they need that five billion. There several estimates for the wall. Five must seem arbitrary, but a little now is better than nothing. 		How should the wall get built?
@FJBoccadoro @Evy_reid @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats Show me where this money is available.
@VP You're one cool customer. I knew I could proudly vote trump when you were chosen. I pray that God can use you to protect this nation. No money for anything other tha  our security! #BuildTheWall
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Keep fighting for this country! We need to sober up. The government has one job and that's to defend our life. America is going to have some withdrawals, but we have to have a wall. #BuildTheWall

@realDonaldTrump What do the Democrats support and believe in if not the security and well being of the nation? #BuildTheWall
@Evy_reid @FJBoccadoro @realDonaldTrump @SenateDems @SenateGOP @HouseDemocrats The so called "wall" encompasses many technologies. Concrete walls, metal slats and expanded funding for things like drones.
@realDonaldTrump Dangerous game by the Democrats. I pray you stay strong and wait for a bill that includes the wall. #buildthewall
@richardthelh @realDonaldTrump He never changed. He ran on the wall and getting rid of nafta.
@drkiyangogg @realDonaldTrump Why are you really against the wall?

@chxlsd @realDonaldTrump @Ace_QK I don't always agree with him, but he can be funny. This nation needs to take a deep breath and realize what we do agree on.

@realDonaldTrump Please save our Republic. Keep fighting for the wall!
@narakxm We don't need nonessential employees if we cant defend the republic.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Where's the wall?
