@AndrewGumbel @ivn Right. Institutions don’t like it. Voters do. So what “I” institutions don’t like it, as you tweeted without that clarification? Sorry I didn’t know about your sensitive nature.
@AndrewGumbel @ivn Also, your statement that Rs Ds and Is is just flat out untrue. Look at the polling. Voters love top-two. You should, as a journalist, should be more careful with assertions like that. Might lose trust.
@AndrewGumbel @TheShawnG @ivn Point is they are spending more money without being able to determine/predict/select the outcome. More power to voters. You just made the point.

RT @IVNetwork: Couldnt agree more! RT @TheMuserGR: Many ideas here need nuanced discussion--lets keep talking when event is over! #indyvote
@NoLabelsOrg What procedures should we change? #indyvote
@Indie_Voters Do we assume independents are centrists? I think indies are all over the map.  #indyvote
@Lord_lucaseaves solutions and ideas should not be "r" and "d." That's the prob. #indyvote
@Indie_Voters Yes. Whether they can win not as important as the questions they force to be answer. Spark real debate. #indyvote
RT @TheShawnG: To win in the GOP Primary in TX a candidate only needed just under 6% of total registered voters. Dem only 3%. #indyvote

@Censored_Voice bi-partisan gerrymandering. bi-partisan opposition to open primaries. congress=bi-partisan club #indyvote
@IVNetwork Of course. Can donate $1M to an unaccountable PAC, but not directly to candidate? Law needs to change #indyvote
@georgemanty agreed. starts with who reps are accountable to, and where they get their money. #indyvote
RT @Indie_Voters: @IVNetwork @NoLabelsOrg non partisan redistricting commissions, open primaries, campaign finance reform #indyvote
@Indie_Voters term limits have not helped California. Money buys inexperienced candidates.  More easily manipulated. #indyvote
@HeatherRogers11 starts with primaries. 30% turnout. Partisan only, so 5% of population picks candidates for general. #indyvote
@IVNetwork Average voters embarrassed by political dialogue. Only sensationalism and extremism drive interest. #indyvote
@NoLabelsOrg: what rules and procedures you referring to? #indyvote
dead on RT @KRBays: .@IVNetwork No incentive to appeal outside base, then no incentive to cooperate outside party lines. #indyvote
