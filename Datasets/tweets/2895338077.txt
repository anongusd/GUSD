@DannyPellegrino I've recorded all if it
I ate cool ranch doritos today and felt like I was transported back to high school
Johnny and Moira Rose are relationship goals @SchittsCreek
@ByeByeBynum I think there are plenty of examples on both sides and it should all be denounced. You can even go back to the Weather Underground or Rules for Radicals. It all sucks and a civil society should not tolerate violent rhetoric/actions. Trump definitely throws fuel on the fire

@Jezebel Heather Graham
@DannyPellegrino I just listened to the new episode and 1. The Holiday, is a perfect movie. 2. I am loving Kameron on RHOD more and more, I don't even skip the tag lines because I love how she says "standards" she is one of the best cast additions in years! @KamWestcott @Bravotv
