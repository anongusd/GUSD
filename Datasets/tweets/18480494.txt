A8: Due to workforce shortages in mental health treatment along with the potential stigma of accessing mental health care, tele-mental health provides patients w/access to a provider w/o the potential stigma associated with receiving mental health care services. #RuralHealthChat
A8: Some health centers are using tele-mental health to provide patients with access to behavioral health care services.  #RuralHealthChat
A8: America’s Community Health Centers are using telehealth, remote patient monitoring, &amp; utilizing community health workers to ensure that patients in rural areas can stay in touch with their providers &amp; access the care they need. #RuralHealthChat
A7: Employing telehealth programs in rural areas allows primary care providers to address barriers to accessing care such as transportation issues and costs, loss of work/unpaid time as a result of traveling to appointments and access to specialty care providers. #RuralHealthChat
A6: The elderly, low-income, migrant populations, minority groups, and individuals who lack access to transportation are more likely to be impacted by access issues in rural areas. #RuralHealthChat
A5: The closure of rural health facilities impacts local economies due to job loss, requires patients to find new providers at other facilities, travel further to access care, and can increase the risk of skipped primary care visits. #RuralHealthChat

RT @ruralhealthinfo: #RuralHealthChat https://t.co/HHHzLAWU04
A4: Specialty care is often difficult to access in rural areas. #RuralHealthChat
A3: Also, lack of access to care, specifically primary care, leads to increased reliance on costly emergency department care.  #RuralHealthChat
A3: Health care access is important to the vitality of rural communities. Without proper access to providers, rural patients are more likely to suffer from complicated &amp;  high-cost health conditions like diabetes &amp; hypertension that can be life-threatening. #RuralHealthChat
A2: Limited provider types, long distances between patients and providers, and a dwindling health care workforce all impact access to care in rural areas. #RuralHealthChat
A1: Access in the healthcare context means ensuring that all patients can be seen by their provider of choice without substantial financial, transportation, or linguistic burdens standing in the way. #RuralHealthChat
