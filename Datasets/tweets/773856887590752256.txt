@TheKindCromang @SamTracy @lynn_bianchi @KFILE Bernie will get screwed again if he can’t get dnc support	And	If he does run as Independent then he will almost insure Trump win. 	Lots of time before 2020 election
@TheKindCromang @SamTracy @lynn_bianchi @KFILE This is what I found		https://t.co/qrzdbAm1tD
@JacksonLeeTX18 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS What was in that envelope you handed to Dr Fords lawyer after her hearing?
@TheKindCromang @SamTracy @lynn_bianchi @KFILE DNC/Debbie Wasserman Schultz screwed Bernie in 2016 and left Dems with a deeply flawed HRC candidate who obviously lost to a deeply flawed Trump. So my question is now that DNC changed policy to only support a registered Dem, will Bernie run as an Independent?
@RepMarkMeadows @SandraTXAS Declassify???? Trump could declassify these and other documents today so the REAL question is why doesn’t he	Transparency leads to accountability 	Until we have both this country is going to continue to deteriorate

@WalshFreedom This is POLITICS plan and simple	Dems want to deny Trump his signature campaign promise of the wall despite the fact they have provided border funding in the past	AND	Trump lacks the basic communication skills to explain the need to seal the border.
@SteveRattner Boston University especially the Economics dept has to be cringing every time @AOC speaks on economics
@maggieNYT You will be sued very soon unless you walk back your inaccurate comments on the Catholic kids
@PD3598 @WalshFreedom I believe it. We need to seal the border now and not to fulfill a campaign promise	it’s long over due	If Trump wasn’t such a poor communicator then maybe he would get the support to pressure Dems but he’s too busy insulting ppl and lying

@maggieNYT He’s just talking shit. He knows nothing	The far lefties and righties are all whackadoos. 	Throw the media in that group as well. The MSM are interested in $$ so they are constantly trying to make you hate or fear ppl who think differently. Disgusting
@WalshFreedom We have an open border which allows people to just walk in undocumented and the Dems won’t support sealing our border so it is an emergency.

@JackPosobiec I’m a Va resident and didn’t vote for Northam but I don’t think he should resign 4 something he did 35 years ago especially since there is no pattern of racist behaviors after the photo was taken. 	Dems have no choice but to ask him to leave after treating Kavanuagh so shamefully

@Kratochvil88 @WalshFreedom So there isn’t a huge caravan of non-US citizens coming here?
@MarcusHUSA @allahpundit The govt does not do anything well....nothing. There is so much waste and fraud across the board. Why would we give the govt even more money and responsibility?	The answer is balance. Govt with private sector (Bids) etc with oversight.

@jimsciutto I cant believe you allowed Debbie Wasserman Shultz come on your show and lie to you and to us without calling her out. She blatantly lied and you allowed her to do it which makes you and CNN complicit in misinforming the public	WTF https://t.co/K4bot67Yk3
@WalshFreedom @Acosta Hey Joe	 FYI Acosta can still get into the White House. He just has to get a day pass...not sure how this stifles the press
@benjaminwittes Why don’t you/others ask Andrew Cuomo how this happened?
@ArthurSchwartz @JessieJaneDuff What the hell is wrong with you? Jim Acosta isn’t the only reporter reporting the news. CNN can send someone else and Acosta can cover dog shows
@JayCostTWS You cant blame the crumbling subway system on Amazon.	25,000 jobs makes it worth it to NY and NOVA	Think of the income tax and employee tax $$$
@WalshFreedom @Acosta Trump might not be able to pick who covers him from a media outlet but he can revoke press pass of any reporter who continues to act inappropriately like Acosta has.
@real_farmacist @NHKathySullivan After what she said? she is too stupid to hold public office
@steelers Bell is a POS and other teams will think twice when hiring him after what he did to the Steelers. 	Wonder if he could pass a drug test....
@freedom_moates Arizona spoke very loudly voting in a Democrat which says a lot about how they feel about Trump. Glad Flake is gone.
@BillKristol Lots of transparency Bill
@CoryBooker You are going to continue to be disappointed Sparty
@SenWarren Hope Warren runs so she can see what Americans really think of her. Disgusting human being
@davidhogg111 @tinamichelehaze Idiot
@dagenmcdowell @andrewcuomo @NYCMayor She is “enthusiastically stupid”	Can’t wait until Pelosi straightens her out and tells her to fall in-line.

@atensnut Look his Mom up....he is probably living in her basement
@Susan_Hennessey What a shock...a cnn analyst criticizing Trump. 	Even a typo in his tweets draws the ire of the unhinged left. 	Trump Derangement Syndrome is real and these msm clowns have it bad.
@dcexaminer He couldn’t even win re-election in His own state
@aplusk @glennbeck Can I have that gun your friend gave you since u don’t want it? I love guns. Guns are the ultimate equalizer.

@Yamiche You are so far gone you cant even see you are no longer a journalist. You and other MSM stoped covering the news of the day a long time ago. Now you/MSM try to create the news. 	Shame on you-get back to journalism
@charly277 @Acosta You don’t get to speak for the country and Acosta doesnt represent the whole of the free press. He could not separate his hatred for Trump and respect the office of the presidency. Activism has no place in journalism. CNN can someone else.
@Acosta Dear diary	I lost my White House credentials bc I’m an insufferable ass. 	Now what are you going to do? Cover dog shows?
@nedryun If Romney was an ice cream flavor, he would be vanilla
@jpodhoretz Acosta is frequently inappropriate when it comes to all things Trump. Reporters should never be the story.	Trump should take his White House credentials and tell CNN to try again
@jpodhoretz NBC is so dishonest
@RebekahWorsham @Kira_Media @FoxNews What was the stunt Fox pulled. Didn’t see it
@Trumpmerica You can bet Mueller has seen Trumps tax returns. 	Congress cant access them. It is not a requirement even if Trump said he would release them they cant see them.
@benshapiro Not sure about HRC getting indicted but Tony Podesta might be
@jpodhoretz I like Trey Gowdy for AG
@jpodhoretz NOT RUDY!!!!!	We need a true nonpartisan. Someone both parties can trust to do the right thing. 	Wishful thinking
@tonyposnanski You do know Beto is planning on running for president, right? As Senator, he would not have been working for Texas and miss a lot of votes like Obama did when he ran.	And Beto has a crap ton of money already.
@benshapiro Too soon to be a Debbie-Downer Ben. Political landscapes change very rapidly with Trump as president. 	House Democrats will definitely overreach with talk of impeachment of both Trump/Kavanaugh and continuing the Russia investigation. Not a good look for Dems
@featherbeds Coney even said that Russia more than likely hacked her server and we know China did. Clinton’s are awful ppl. Do you believe the woman Bill raped and sexually assaulted or do you have your head in the sand on that too.
Dems do not stand for anything except trying to bring down Trump. Pathetic.	I hope like hell Repubs keep the house. https://t.co/3RNvB10dfQ

@DailyCaller I have to say Pete Davidson is a punk and a puke who lost his father during 911. It’s his 1st amendment right like its my right not to watch SNL or buy from any of its advertisers
@yashar I have a good friend that says he doesn’t want to go to heaven if Christians will be there.	Quit using the Bible to judge other ppl. Worry about yourself and pray for others.
@dbongino What She and other Democrats fail to understand is that they will never take guns away from law abiding citizens. 	Guns have a trigger that requires a finger to fire the gun. Stop blaming guns and prosecute criminals.	Cmon Georgia
@featherbeds U do know that these indictments have nothing to do w Trump.	HRC should have been indicted for sending/rec classified information from a private server &amp; private email address she chose to use. FBI McCabe complicit in cover up. The evidence should have been put before grand jury.
@CNNPolitics “Coulda Woulda Shoulda”	CNN/guests/lefty pundits have been talking about “bombshell” this and “bombshell” that since this Russia collusion investigation started. 	And	“THERE IS NO THERE THERE” Andrew McCabe said this
@CNNPolitics Melania is not on the ballot. 	As usual, MSM nitpicking everything Trump.	Over 90% negative coverage of this president.	It’s disgusting and dishonest.
@CRTV Cmon Massachusetts-Elizabeth Warren is a true opportunistic POS. Wake up
Did you say journalist? Most “journalist” are Trump hating “activist” these days. 	Proof? When over 90% of coverage by MSM is negative towards Trump then you know there is a problem.	Walter Cronkite is rolling over in his grave https://t.co/wCLwVGNMj0
@ChicagosMayor How many ppl in Chicago get shot everyday bc you are a shitty mayor???

@ktumulty Bc you have a moral imperative? 	Stop taking yourself so seriously.
@Ginbatch_ @BigFatDave Not true... you can get an AR-15 chambered in 308, too	But what Bernadette is failing to realize is that guns are the ultimate equalizer. Nobody need fear being physically assaulted if you have a gun and know how to use it.
Just saw @Ana_Navarroe on CNN blaming Trump for the violence. She definitely has Trump Derangement Syndrome.	This picture says it all. You do know that Bill Clinton is a sexual predator, right Ana? https://t.co/jzSEBYY8jl

@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump I really hope Repubs keep the house and Streisand leaves the country and takes most of Hollywood with her
@markknoller @POTUS Trump cant change the 14th amendment with an executive order and you know it. Very dishonest of you to even pose this question but typical journalist turned activist these days. Let’s misinform ppl in order to elicit a negative response towards this president.
⁦@donlemon⁩ is a racist. He said white men are the real threat to freedom in this country. By the way, his partner is a white man. Disgraceful statement https://t.co/jD1lr6p0TS
@CarolC You see racism bc You are racist. It’s obvious you are trying to overcompensate for your white shame. Pathetic really.	We have laws against just walking into this country
@JuddLegum Don’t tell me....this is a bombshell development and the beginning of the end for the Trump presidency. 	Do you know how many times the left has said this yet Trump persist. 	You have zero credibility 	The sky isn’t falling
@NewsPolitics @juliaioffe CNN continues to devolve, devoid of journalistic integrity. Activism not journalism is the norm at most MSM. They are violating their FCC mandate/broadcast licensing contract which states that they must provide news to their broadcasting area. They should lose their license
@guypbenson HRC looks drunk or high on pills. Should have asked her if she still carries hot sauce in her purse.
Just as bad, the Women’s March would not allow Pro-Life woman to march. https://t.co/KrUjOIo2PC
Good advice-morning shows like CNN and Morning Joe are all extremely critical of POTUS-both the hosts and their guests. It’s so predictable and boring. It has to hurt their ratings. Unwatchable https://t.co/qKzviEAyem
@mcaark @JasonButtrill I think the cluelessness on the left you speak of is due to where they get their news from. They watch Colbert or Bill Maher and other extreme liberal/Trump hating shows. No balance there.
@EllenTPrice47 @MSNBC @morningmika Snap!!
@WalshFreedom These ppl are just plain stupid when it comes to stopping an active shooter.
@samstein You were always someone I trusted to get the truth and now YOU are full of shit too	Disappointed
@peterbakernyt Trump talks to the press more than all 4 of the last presidents put together 	He will answer every question and asks if there are any more questions most of the times.	You might not like his answers
Then write stories that cover all sides of an issue instead of writing in your diary. 	Your are practicing ACTIVISM and not journalism. 	You actually walked out of a press con bc you got your feelings hurt. https://t.co/nC5iORDxkr
@trish_regan @PhilippeReines @POTUS Please ask this clown the next time he is on if he has accepted the results of the 2016 election. That will tell the true story of his motivation and intentions by attacking Trump
@CharlieDaniels The Charlie Daniels Band was the first concert I ever attended in 1979 in Williamsburg, Virginia. Good Times!
@WayneDupreeShow HRC wont run for president again. The sheer effort it would take is beyond her physical ability. Trump outworked her in 2016 and will probably will outwork everyone in 2020.
@KirstenPowers @juliaioffe @washingtonpost Have you forgotten	Madonnas rhetoric	Johnny Depps rhetoric	Snoops music videos	And all of those who rec fake bombs have been lying abt Trump/Repubs 	MSM also responsible for amping up rhetoric and misinformation		Wake up
Left likes to point out Trumps divisive rhetoric but what about the rhetoric on the left? Every person who rec a fake bomb is a Trump hater and used over the top divisive rhetoric and CNNs coverage of POTUS is over 90% negative. 	Why doesn’t the left take any responsibility? https://t.co/SHuHfKyO45
@secupp No but it is the media’s job to report the news without bias and malice towards any political group in order to advance their narrative

@SenGillibrand My daughter is a third year law student at a pretty good law school. She earned a full three year academic scholarship there. She studied and practiced the LSATs for 4 months before she took it. She knew what she needed to score to get a full ride bc she knew I WOULD NOT PAY 4 it
@SenGillibrand I have a car loan that I don’t like so I guess I shouldn’t have to pay that back. 	Nobody made you sign that paperwork. You knew what you were getting into. It’s YOUR responsibility .....not mine as a tax payer to pay your loan off. Tough lesson.

@TheRickWilson 	You still think Republicans will lose the House Rick?
@WalshFreedom It’s just going to get worse after the election. 	The left is way more intolerant than the right at this time especially MSM. 	If Republicans keep the house then the radical left will lose their minds and the chance of violence will go way up.	Violence is wrong no matter what

@StephenKing @pedi_suzanne You are better at writing than speaking so by all means write and don’t talk. Talking makes you sound ignorant
@StephenKing @pedi_suzanne Apparently men aren’t allowed to talk to women who have claims of sexual assault or haven’t you been paying attention.
@Cassand29017794 @realStephenK62 @docrocktex26 @peterdaou @RepMaxineWaters @sarahkendzior @RVAwonk @Shakestweetz 14 yr allegation not 30	Ppl need to get their facts straight
Cosby was convicted for a 14yr old allegation not 30 dumbass	also there was a pattern of history of sexual predation when it came to Bill Cosby	if you support bill Cosby then you are more fucked in the head then I thought	Just write and don’t talk dumb dumb https://t.co/yJaPbFxVnV
@NormEisen Man are you ever f’d in the head	Aren’t you an attorney? The constitution gives him the presumption of innocence until he can be proven guilty. Ford couldn’t even bring a civil suite with the lack of evidence

@chuckwoolery @Dave13593715 Call for a vote and end this Shit Show
@christyNHC We have something called due process in this country where the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty or do you not care about the rule of law. You should be ashamed of attempting to deny Judge Kavanaugh his constitutional right AND attempting to destroy his life
@Golfinggary5222 @superyayadize She would be unwise to show up-she can not change the facts or lack there of. There is no upside
Innocent until proven guilty...where have I heard that before??? https://t.co/2XiwIhOIKb
@Jim_Jordan Repubs need to stop over reaching like during the Benghazi hearings. You made HRC look like a victim when she was guilty as hell. Potus will get to the bottom of rosenstein Thursday. Why don’t you get to work to repeal ACA or cut the deficit which you have never delivered on.
@brianschatz I hope the men in Hawaii step up and vote your sorry weak ass out. 	You are pathetic. 	You are actually ashamed of being a man.

@atensnut Clintons should be in jail, Juanita. Where’s the courage of our DOJ? Sessions is such a disappointment. He cares more about marijuana prevention than high crimes. 	There is a reckoning coming. Electing Trump was just the beginning.
⁦@CNN⁩ ⁦@ChrisCuomo⁩ ⁦@Acosta⁩ will not report this story about Tony Podesta getting a criminal referral to Manhattan prosecutors. Doesn’t fit their negative Trump narrative  https://t.co/LVu1Wkd9gj

@seanhannity Where’s Sessions? He is worthless-time to fire him
@WalshFreedom Is this what happens when someone has too much money and time on their hands? 	They either turn into a drug addict/alcoholic or get stupid or both. Regular ppl don’t want their thoughts on modern day life bc they are so out of touch they say really really stupid things!
@PlaysTrumpCard @steph93065 March their ass before congress like they did with Facebook
@kasie You know damn well that Kaitlin “Billy Bob” Collins tried to embarrass Trump in front of the EU leader. 	Her ban doesn’t restrict CNN from using another so called “journalist” (activist) to cover the WH. Acosta is next	Feigning outrage is pathetic.
@jpodhoretz @JohnJHarwood This is another example of Repubs overreaching like when they voted to overturn ACA knowing Obama would veto-over 35 times. No chance of passing and they knew it. 	also blew the Benghazi hearings by overreaching. They could have buried her but evoked sympathy for HRC instead.
@Golfinggary5221 @superyayadize @JayneQPatriot @cjdtwit @mandymendez90 @LaylaAlisha11 @vachilly64 @LadyKnightFury @Maggieb1B @Lady_Vi_2U @PatriotJenn The DOJ should have put her email crimes before a grand jury but there is a different standard for the Clintons. And I bet Hillary will try to run for president in 2020, Gary. The Clintons know no shame. Hopefully the dems will shut her down
@SenGillibrand Don’t think Americans have forgotten about your close personal friendship with the Clintons over 20 years while Bill Clinton was seducing an intern and sexual predation and Hillary bullied his victims.	You are no woman’s advocate-you are an opportunist-#phony
@MichaelSteele @SenatorLeahy Sessions was just repeating their words and NOT joining in the chant and you know it. 	You can lie to us and everyone else but dont lie to yourself.	You ppl are getting so desperate its pathetic

@ABCPolitics Time to go, Pruitt. Typical politician looking out for #1. He should have been fired long ago. 	Little dignity in what lobbyist do. Not sure why our govt allows them to talk to our leaders. Should be banned.
@CillizzaCNN @MarkWarner did look and act like he was drunk. Red faced and and speech a bit slurred. Warner is my Senator here in Va so Ive seen him speak quite a bit over the years.
@HollaBlackGirl @pattonoswalt I dont agree...ignorance is color blind.
@_Darcizzle_ Good luck and send pics!
@TimRunsHisMouth @TomArnold is drunk or high on something here. He is pathetically trying to be relevant. But in the end, he is just another phony suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome
@TraceySRogers1 @superyayadize I believe 99% of DOJ and FBI folks are fine, honest, hardworking ppl.  B U T there are those corrupt few that have been exposed. It doesn’t help that Rosenstein and Wray are dragging their feet when it comes to providing full transparency
@atensnut I assume you dont watch Shepard Smith either, Juanita....he should be working for CNN or maybe he is
@davidhogg111 You prove once again that you are just a naive kid. 	You would rather not protect schools with ppl with guns thinking the govt will take all guns and there will be no need to harden a soft target? Won’t happen	The only way to stop an active shooter in a school is with a gun
@AndrewNBC12 	Hey Andrew	Why so much rain this year? Is there a scientific explanation?
@Sailguy62 @morningmika @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @DHSgov That show is unwatchable now days. Use to be good with differing views but now it’s predictable and boring-all hate for trump -wonder what the ratings are comparatively
@RadioFreeTom @SteveSchmidtSES @MaxBoot @GeorgeWill @BillKristol I left the Republican Party after Charlottesville riots “fine ppl on both sides”	Just go Independent and not have to support a party. Judge each issue without having to consider party position.  	I’ll still never vote Democrat-Big govt doesn’t work
@NormEisen Have you ever been right, Norm?
@HLAurora63 @MareLovesUSA_00 How stupid of Sec Nielsen to go to a Mexican restaurant-she doesn’t have a clue	What are the chances her food would have been spit in	I really question her judgement across the board now....clueless
@ChrisCuomo Cmon Chris-you know damn well that the Democratics aren’t interested in solving the immigration issue. They think they have a winner in denying Trump border wall/technology	Why dont you ask your Dem guests why they dont come to the table? Their actions dont match their mouth
@RadioFreeTom Let's not forget that Lewandowski man handled a female reporter during the 2016 election....he really is a creep
@SteveSchmidtSES Labels are for soup cans but.....are you now a conservative Independent?
@realDonaldTrump No potus won’t interfere w the immigration laws but even more shameful are the Dems who won’t participate in sealing the border to prevent this kind of thing. Why not talk about the root cause,Cuomo?
@CillizzaCNN Msm doesn’t want to talk about Obama’s immigration policies. He deported millions and detained Kids separate from law breaking parent illegals. 	Hell, Obama’s smoked cigarettes when he was a candidate/pres but you never heard a word from msm. 	Look in the mirror-
@CillizzaCNN It isn’t ok for the media to aid smugglers and traffickers so why are you/they doing it?
Chelsea Handler is a truly stupid person		Chelsea Handler slams Trump's border policy, claims US will end up like Nazi Germanyhttp://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2018/06/19/chelsea-handler-slams-trumps-border-policy-claims-us-will-end-up-like-nazi-germany.html
@atensnut Shepard Smith will be on CNN or MSNBC soon I bet.
@KellyAvellino Maybe its an over simplification but Figure out how much sleep YOUR body needs and subtract from when you need to wake up and go to bed that same time every night except weekends or days off. Be consistent -if its 930 then be in bed by that time. It will work
@kasie So does Congress
@Lrihendry Why give any publicity to @kathygriffin 	You give her a platform and relevancy -that's what she wants
@RadioFreeTom I think it's pretty clear that Trump is trying to Manipulate Kim with flattery to get him to "yes" on denuking. Trump says nice things abt Putin too so he doesn't interfere in our world affairs.
@SteveSchmidtSES @sarahkendzior Oh Shut up	Trumps been in office over 500 days now and you still fall for the outrageous things he says-pay attention to what he does not what he says dummy
@Acosta 	You got owned by Sarah Sanders
@WayneDupreeShow Wayne, I just lost my mom 6 weeks ago. The loss is overwhelming. 	Stay close to your mom and let her know she is not alone. 	Be strong for her if she receives a bad prognosis. 	Life Happens!
While I support this but it Won’t happen....can you imagine the whining if @Acosta did lose his press pass? 	It benefits potus to keep this unhinged “fake news” reporter around. https://t.co/YF3qmFHDuP
Is anybody surprised that this lawsuit was announced the day of the IG report? https://t.co/Q1PgCuKWkO
@CillizzaCNN Unless the media lies
@CGasparino Why not throw in “at the end of the day” too.	These and other sayings show a lack of knowledge of the English language not to mention BORING
So true! I use to love Morning Joe when they were balanced but now it’s all Trump hating and I mean the whole show. 	I wonder what the ratings look like in morning cable shows. Can’t find them but they have to have nothing but Trump haters for an audience. 	Predictable = Boring https://t.co/mVb1G2RsBe
@JackPosobiec Truth? 	I think Kim was told by China to deal bc potus was not backing down and China needs us to be accommodating regarding trade etc. 	China is willing to give Trump a win if it helps relations and doesn’t cost them too much. 	NK is protected by China so why have nukes?
Have you noticed that CNN/MSM are the only ones IN THE WORLD rooting against this NK deal. 	Pathetic
@nedryun I just bought a vp9 in that same color,love it
@bjaninemorison @realDonaldTrump It’s going to be a long 6 1/2 years for u Janine
@RealJamesWoods This is truly hard to watch-Philadelphia Mayor so excited to help protect illegal criminals. The question is why isn’t he excited to help hurting American citizens? He should be embarrassed but doesn’t Know any better-He needs to be called out by his constituents
@davidaxelrod @POTUS So now you are going to claim that TRUMP is crazy and should not be POTUS. So what are you going to pronounce next? Don’t Tell me......Impeachment? 	ppl like you are predictable and boring Axe
@jaketapper What ever happened to your take on Drunk History called Trump History?
@BuzzFeedBen @BuzzFeedNews Oh Really! Were you concerned when Obamas AG Eric Holder signed a subpoena to have James Rosen and his parents phones monitored AND THEN LIED ABOUT IT TO CONGRESS? You phony hypocrites make me sick and that goes for @mitchellreports  too
@JohnBerman dont forget Obamas AG @EricHolder signed a subpoena to monitor Fox News James Rosen phones to include his parents. Eric Holder went on to lie to Congress about his knowledge of this when HE actually signed the subpoena.
@BillOReilly Tazored 	Especially ppl who write for a living
@WalshFreedom While I thank Ralph Peters for his military service, I have to say that I think he has a different motive for criticizing potus and Fox. 	He was kicked to the curb ($$$) by Fox for openly voting for HRC.
@HuffPost There is Drunk History and then there’s Trump History
@JackPosobiec “I never talked to her”. 	I’m a dad w 2 young daughters. He would have been talked to for sure
@danpfeiffer Not against the law you tool. Trump can lie to the press anytime he wants. DNC went to Ukraine to get dirt on Trump but that doesn’t matter to u or other Dems.
@Lrihendry @prepper1776 Does anyone really care-get a life already
@WalshFreedom Keep speaking truth Joe
@DonaldJTrumpJr Time to boycott TBS
@jnabors Too soon?
@KirstenPowers @secupp @CNN Good for you! Olbermann is “out there” and is a perfect example of extremism (HATE) which exists on the RIGHT and the LEFT.
@RoseHasMoreFun @ArizonaKayte @MareLovesUSA_11 @LoriinUtah @KatTheHammer1 @RuthieRedSox @VFL2013 @sewwutnow @Golfinggary5221 @SBelle1950 Your sub dermis is the same color. It’s just a very thin layer of pigmentation that give us all different skin tones. The human tissue from donors is all the same color once the epidermis is removed. God Bless
@JackPosobiec He probably thinks its his moral imperative to run against DT in 2020. Romney,like so many others, has an inaccurate self-perception. America doesn’t need or want him....
@kimmi_chelle @President1Trump Potus promised to PIVOT to being presidential.............still waiting. I know now that he will never pivot.	He cant control himself-no filters	Better him than her but I’m still waiting
@ScottAdamsSays Don’t forget Van Jones election night meltdown	https://t.co/cXnb0ZDwEN
@WalshFreedom POTUS alswys treats Military and 1st Responders with great respect.
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ As soon as the Mueller investigation is over, I would bet good money POTUS will fire Sessions the same day.
@Gerard_Dow @tedmulder1 @jamesplake721 @therealroseanne A sycophant is a brown-noser, butt kisser, suck up
@Ettam15 @Afraid4OurUSA @brithume True-It’s like road rage. Take the cars from around us and we would never scream and yell at other drivers.
@Jake_Bernstein @maggieNYT USA gives billions to other countries every year. Let’s help ppl stay in there own country with this money. We should weed out corruption in these countries or not provide any support
@Jake_Bernstein @maggieNYT Ppl need to enter legally. 	Legal immigration!
@ClemsonColorado @WalshFreedom I also believe labels are for soup cans. We should scrap both parties and all become independent -ppl before party and follow the constitution and laws on the books.
@TellUsWhyCo Why are we even in Afghanistan still? Our blood and money should not be spent there anymore. If that govt doesn’t have it together now-it likely never will
@WalshFreedom So much for Republicans being fiscal conservatives. They are worse than the Dems so far in this administration
@nedryun FBI talked to DNC during 2016 election about Russia hacking their servers and offered to help them. FBI didn’t inform Trump campaign about Russia interference -instead they placed ppl in and around the campaign to include unmasking ppl within campaign
@JennJacques Now that’s funny
@dbongino @prepper1776 Don't forget NYTs broke the HRC email scandal	They are very bias when reporting anything trump
@dbongino Dan, you have to admit that POTUS lies all the time and doesn't give a damn about detail or getting the facts right. He says what he wants when he wants and ppl like Sarah Sanders have to clean up his bs.
@ChrisCuomo Yet you keep having Avenatti on cnn. Over 50 times. 91% negative coverage on your network.
@Golfinggary5221 @ArizonaKayte @bbusa617 @DineshDSouza @jcpenni7maga @Jamierodr10 @wvufanagent99 @smartiekat123 @lilbulli1031 @GartrellLinda @KatTheHammer1 Last person we need as speaker is a partisan interested only in party and not people. Speaker should find common ground with Dems and pass legislation. Not sure who that would be right now.
@ChrisCuomo 	Has anyone asked @AdamSchiffCA or any other dem if they would like to attend this meeting?
@mkraju @AdamSchiffCA is not interested in attending this meeting or he would have asked. Instead he chose to act like a victim. 	He is a disgusting partisan interested in advancing his party and ignores his role to provide transparency and accountability
@gaye_gallops Do you know that Trump could pick up the phone and call the DOJ and get any and all the information TODAY if he wanted to but instead he just wants to play the blame game in the media to appease his base.
@WalshFreedom I see your point but Joe Walsh calls them like he sees them. He doesn’t blindly follow a party or a platform. 	I hate political partisanship. Spinning the facts to fit a party narrative is no different than lying.
@kylegriffin1 He should have been put in jail when he lied to congress about Americans being surveilled. I guess its ok to lie to congress
@thehill She should be in jail for putting ICE officers lives in jeopardy.
@SiddonsDan @kwilli1046 @DeplorableChoir Awful music
@charliekirk11 Provide a list of countries who do this	Iran rec billions from Obama but what other countries burn our flag and wish death on us
@kwilli1046 I’m not Mexican so I’m not paying
@JoeXpressauto @prepper1776 @yournewswire I know you well enough to call you a kool-aid drinker. Why blindly support everything trump says or does. Why not admit trump is his own worst enemy. 	I voted for trump but can’t support all he does.Terrible communicator. 	He could control msm with the right communication person
@JoeXpressauto @prepper1776 @yournewswire You are truly gullible and maybe stupid if you believe this but I dont know you. You may want to stop drinking the kool-aid long enough to have an honest moment with yourself. 	This is fake news. Kerry is rich
@ChrisCuomo How many ppl over thousands of years have been murdered in the name religion? 	Take care of your own house first-
@Thomas1774Paine I think the charges will follow the other IG report which they have completed and will be available in a couple of weeks.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Perfect example -POTUS is a terrible communicator	He should have mentioned ms-13 	Instead potus allows haters to quote his exact words not what he meant.	Time to let others speak for you if you cant stop getting in your own way
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump You are purposely misleading ppl. That’s called lying. You lie for a living-no foundation in real journalism.
@CBSNews CBS and MSM would love it if the meeting with N Korea is cancelled
@GartrellLinda Lie detector tests are not reliable
@AMike4761 Give him to Jordan. They will know what to do with him according their laws
@1776Stonewall These “tick Tock” rants never pan out	Just a bunch of zombie followers desperately clinging to fake news facts	Ill follow this story and check back to say I TOLD YOU SO
@benshapiro Time to move then	Texas	Florida	South Carolina
@JimCarrey Put down the crack pipe, Jim! 	It’s pretty clear that you are afraid of guns yet you support having ppl with guns protect you. 	Go to. Shooting range and rent a gun and get a shooting lesson from a professional but go to a mental healthcare professional first.
@CillizzaCNN Congrats Chris!
@jimsciutto LEGAL IMMIGRATION!!!  	Wake up, Jim! 	It’s not the immigrant -it’s the way they immigrate. 	Millions waiting in line but I never hear you talk about them
@DrMartyFox @cvpayne Great but What’s the worker participation rate? There are more than 3.9% of Americans unemployed
@ChrisCuomo But unlike cnn, the host apologized by the end of his show
@ChrisCuomo 	What a lame interview. You didn’t even ask the guy how much time Iran had under the nuke deal to be inspected. 	You looked scared to ask him any challenging question 	What the hell
@jaketapper Thanks for the correction
@CNNPolitics Politics as usual	She is too partisan to ever be considered for president
@jimmyfallon @FallonTonight Ha	 So funny
@brhodes @EaterofSoles It was a terrible deal AND YOU KNOW IT! Inspections never included military sites and instant inspections were never allowed. 	Please don’t tell me you actually believe the Iranians. 	Pathetic
@ComfortablySmug Reminds me of Al Sharptons shakedown of Walmart
@jimsciutto @MartinHeinrich How many lives were saved is the REAL question you should be asking.
@PolitiFact Not the same. Bill Clinton asked ppl to cover up and lie as did Richard Nixon. Not the case w trump.
@RealJamesWoods @JessieJaneDuff Don’t forget about failed Solyndra deal (700 million)and Shovel Ready debacle.
@CNNPolitics Why didn’t you ask Sen Kaine  if he agreed w Obama payment to Iran when they will use to try to kill Americans-Kaines son is active duty Marine.
@kwilli1046 Can you provide documents proving Pelosi was briefed? I believe she was but want real proof
@mkraju What about balanced coverage??? Is he wrong about the 91% meg coverage?
@JackPosobiec Let Iran put a toe out of line now	Let’s see what happens when they run those small attack boats at our ships to test our resolve
@JackPosobiec Is Germany paying their fair share to be a part of UN?
@JackPosobiec @Dave13593715 What is the worker participation rate? 	Nobody bragging abt unemployment rate ever mentions worker participation rate	You can’t believe there are only 3.9% of Americans are unemployed 	We are headed in the right direction!
@ChrisCuomo Wish you covered the Clintons cash conduit known as the Clinton Foundation as well as you do a pornstars shake down of trump. She was and still is an opportunist and CNN has her attorney on various shows day and night.	I’ll do my part and keep changing the channel
@johnnymcdowell @JackPosobiec My insurance jumped 78% when ACA kicked in.
@JackPosobiec Jack! Don’t forget Obamacare is still around and that’s his “signature” law
@DineshDSouza How much money did Obama give Iran knowing they would use it to sponsor terrorism around the world?
@mkraju @jaketapper Flake needs to just shut the hell up and leave already. He and the other leaders not running for re-election find their voices all the sudden.  Cowardly and proves they lack character and integrity
@samstein Can’t believe you think this kind of thing is new.
@ChrisCuomo tell you what	If CNN keeps having a pornstars lawyer on the show then I’ll keep turning the channel
@CillizzaCNN That’s a joke....right?
@DineshDSouza A dying person
@ChrisCuomo It’s only 26 billion to secure our southern border-$ should be allocated for border security at presidents discretion. Dems playing politics-dont want to give trump a win or see him honor any campaign promises.
@Sgtgs1 @prepper1776 @MSNBC Not getting my guns
@CBSThisMorning @CBSNews @ChrisCuomo You can blame MSM on Americans not knowing enough about the Iran Nuke deal. MSM only reports on details favorable to staying in the deal. Example-If Iranians are allowed to monitor their own sites then its a bad deal
@TexasLo4Ever @President1Trump Where does she get her news from? You cant just 1 news outlet. You have to watch as many as you can stomach to get a real feel for what’s really happening in this country and the world.
@Golfinggary522 @RealEagleWings @DineshDSouza So will she be charged?
@kwilli1046 Why hasn’t potus invited him to the White House?
@kwilli1046 What did he lie about again?
@amandacarpenter Unwatchable
@essenviews Duh-Is McCain just now admitting it?
@RadioFreeTom How do you know? Talking out of your ass....again
@jonathanvswan @benshapiro @jontester should be censured by ethics committee
@stephenfhayes I hope Michelle Wolfs career goes the way of Kathy Griffin
@TheNYevening @JennaNeen 2) weight to piston downward-high rises are not built to withstand pistoning forces. That’s what happened. That’s why the terrorist used this form of terror. 	If you believe the govt did this then you probably believe SandyHook was faked. #shame #stupid #gullible
@TheNYevening @JennaNeen 1) 2 jumbo jets full of jet fuel crashed into the tours. The fire reach 1800 degrees which isn’t hot enough to melt metal but hot enough to weaken metal. The floors started to buckle in the middle causing the outer structure to fail with 1000s of tons of...
@TimRunsHisMouth @ChrisCuomo Let’s not forget that Kellyanne Conway as the 1st woman to run a successful presidential campaign. MSM has never given her her due
@NicholsUprising @Reince You blame TRUMP for this crass comedians performance but where is YOUR sense of dignity, John? To attack a persons looks should have YOU crying foul but....	You TRUMP haters have lost your soul
@kwilli1046 Another irony is that Bernie THE SOCIALIST owns 3 houses-	I wonder if his wife is still under FBI investigation
@DineshDSouza I’d like to remind everyone how @amjoyshow treated @SteveScalise after he was shot and fighting for his life in the hosp. She attacked him and his record painting him as a racist. SHE is the racist homophobic bigot and her past writings prove it. Boycott MSNBC until they fire her
@brithume @EricHolder belongs on MSNBC with the rest of the backwards thinking America hating stooges.
@TheBeatWithAri @ACLU How can it be a Muslim ban if 85% of Muslims can still apply to travel to America???
@RadioFreeTom @SonnyBunch Get in the boat Fredo!
@LiberPatriot @realDonaldTrump The potus is allowed to leak anything he wants or didn’t you know that?
@dbongino @prepper1776 If he really didn’t know who paid for the dossier then it proves the FBI never fully investigated the facts of that dossier yet used it to spy on Trump associates
@RyanAFournier @prepper1776 @realDonaldTrump Too early to start giving anyone credit. Ill remind u that Kim just went to China and received his marching orders. China does not want American nukes or advanced weapon systems on that peninsula-too close to the China main land.
@WalshFreedom @foxandfriends You are right again Joe. You have a good handle on all things Trump so I’ll follow your lead
@NormEisen Bill Cosby needs a lawyer like you Norm.
@brandon_beatnet @cinkay22 @JackPosobiec Cmon man... think...I didn’t vote for him for a tax cut. At the time of the election 2016 It wasn’t even offered. 	I’m an independent not beholden to any party
@cinkay22 @brandon_beatnet @JackPosobiec Lol	Everyone should check their pay stubs. Look how much you are paying in taxes and ask yourself if you are getting your moneys worth. No is the answer. 	Big Govt doesn’t do anything well-especially when it comes to managing our money. The waste and fraud is ridiculous.
@AveryDaymond @PoliticalShort Oh thx a lot for telling me that. Good to know	So just because people give up looking for employment doesn’t mean they are employed now. A lot are under-employed like my friend who has 2 part-time jobs. 	I think the only metric to use is worker participation rate.
@JackPosobiec I voted for him and am going to enjoy my extra $2k per year due to tax cut BUT He needs to stop lying so much. If he would just honor his pledge to pivot to being more presidential.He really is his own worst enemy but nobody will show him that. Better him than her but....
@PoliticalShort What is the worker participation rate? Nobody talks about it but more closely describes real unemployment rate. We have way more than 4% of Americans out of work.
@CBSNews We give billions of dollars every year to other countries. Why not help them in there own country so they can live there. Help them eliminate corruption and crime.
@MiamiMaxHydro @TomFitton @JudicialWatch Exactly	I resent having to keep a close eye out on my government leaders these days. 	Term limits
@kwilli1046 It’s not over yet, Kevin. More coming out about McCabe and Comey. Justice is taking its own sweet time but there is a reckoning coming. Just ask Bill Cosby.
@MiamiMaxHydro @TomFitton @JudicialWatch There are a lot of things I want looked into like uranium one and fast and furious and exactly who in the CIA told George W there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
@kwilli1046 @GrizzleMeister Too bad we don’t have a better communicator as POTUS-if he could show how Big Govt which is what Dems want,doesn’t do anything well like 	VA Admin	Medicare	Medicaid	Social Security	Obama Care	Etc....so much waste and fraud	If Trump could focus on balance btw Govt and private sec
@MiamiMaxHydro @TomFitton @JudicialWatch I’m trying to figure out who Rod Rosenstein reports to since sessions recused himself of the Mueller Russian probe.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch I’d let that whole HRC email scandal go if they put the evidence before a grand jury and they wouldn’t recommend indictment.
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Why don’t they put evidence before a grand jury

@TomFitton Question-who does Rossenstein report to on the Russian investigation since Sessions recused himself.
I wish @dagenmcdowell and @MariaBartiromo would have asked their last guest who said the bags of cash Obama gave Iran was their money if he thought it was ok to give a terror sponsored state trying to kill Americans all that money they will use to cont doing just that

@dagenmcdowell 	Gettem Dagen
@MaxBoot @PostOpinions While I support civility towards one another in both chambers, there is no way Repubs are going to support a Dem or vice versa. Your hatred for Trump has seriously diminished any understanding you might have had about politics.
@AIIAmericanGirI @BreitbartNews @LibbySchaaf should be arrested for warning illegal CRIMINAL aliens regarding ICE raids which make their jobs more dangerous. Do your job @jeffsessions
@JewelFraser2014 @ChrisCuomo You are right. I just lost my mother (80) 10 days ago. She was sick and very tired so she refused treatment and died on her own terms. There is nothing to prepare you for the loss of a parent. My faith continues to assuage my grief. I pray for peace to you and your family-
@FransiscaMangi4 @GartrellLinda I hope she loses. She is over ambitious and backed legislation for less control of Big pharma regarding opioids. Cmon Tennessee -pick someone worthy
@OregonJOBS2 @boredofmyself97 She is very special
@TPM @joshtpm Rudy needs to keep his mouth shut. He just joined the team and he has already screwed up by announcing the end of the investigation in a few weeks. He doesn’t know and has zero power over Mueller.
@mkraju @maggieNYT No sense of propriety or decorum 	I’m speaking of @JimAcosta
@RealJamesWoods @instapundit And if Bernie had any sense of loyalty to all of his supporters then he would join the suit.
@CBSNews This happened in 2014-would someone please tell me why it took over 3 years to decide whether or not to charge someone. Govt is so dysfunctional.
@kwilli1046 @SparkleSoup45 Time to watch for N Korea trickery -they claimed to have miniaturized nukes they could just walk into this country with the porous state of our borders. I dont trust N Korea especially since they are playing so nice
@ChrisCuomo McCabe lied to the FBI 4 times-3 times under oath-game over. The law must apply to everyone equally-just ask Martha Stewart
@1776Stonewall @KathyTa57912064 You ask what lead to a special counsel being appointed? It was bc POTUS fired the FBI director who was investigating Russian collusion. POTUS made things worse. He should let Mueller finish and keep his trap shut AND just be president. His #s would rise
@yogagenie I just finished the book and believe THE #1 takeaway is Don’t ever take yourself too seriously like Comey. I’m surprised he doesn’t refer to himself in the 3rd person.  Ego aside he is so obsessed with his own integrity that he questions everything to the point of seeming naive
@AlanDersh Labels are for soup cans!	Rule of law	Civil liberties 	Due process	This is what matters	Not hate speech and vitriol -take emotion out of your thinking ppl	Ppl/principle before party-PERIOD

@RepSwalwell @MalcolmNance You are so partisan you should be ashamed. There are plenty of despicable behaviors by Dems that you dont have the courage to expose. Why not start w Debbie Wasserman Shultz and her IT scandal
@BillKristol You wouldn’t mention her in this way if she was a man-check yourself Bill-heroics isn’t an exclusive man trait. It’s like you are surprised a woman could do something extraordinary. The woman in my life are brave and capable. There are all kinds of gender bias-#teachable moment
@RobProvince @instapundit On leave? Is that code for the University suspending her?
@codeofvets Trump promised to drain the swamp and Pruitt is the swamp. He should be fired. Wasting tax payer $ is  unacceptable.	Sessions should be fired for other reasons. He is almost worthless when enforcing immigration laws.
@kwilli1046 Where is the oversight on Judges and what constitutes recusal?The optics alone is terrible if you actually care about the judicial system, this makes you not trust those in charge.
@GeorgiaDirtRoad @RepDeSantis I would love to know what takes so much damn time. Are they incompetent? There were 8 memos....with at least 1 classified element so that is game over and Comey -should be questioned and evidence presented to grand jury. The law applies to everybody or nobody.
@EWErickson Hannity probably didn’t know Cohen had him listed as a client if they never signed a deal to represent. Not sure what to believe but I like Transparency 	Where is the @aclu?
@Phil_Mattingly @SenatorMenendez Menendez should be in jail for corruption
@rafaelshimunov @CynthiaNixon She doesn’t even watch TV....cant trust anyone who doesn’t watch television lol	She has an inaccurate self perception if she thinks she can get elected.
@ScottRickhoff @younglady037833 @EricHolder lied to congress when he said he had nothing to do with monitoring a reporter and his families phones when he actually signed the subpoena AND he authorized the sale of thousands of guns to Mex cartel which led to the murder of a border control officer-#JAIL
@danpfeiffer @ChairmanBuckley And you to an oath to Hillary Clinton-how is that working out for you?
@RepSwalwell @MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump Those hard working ppl you talk about were given a tax break by this president and not you.
@DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump Trump could get those documents and declassify them if he wanted. Potus could get those now

@CNNPolitics Kelly has helped create problems with his comments on Porter and other issues. He needs to keep his mouth shut and stay out of the spotlight

@ChrisCuomo you forget how gaffe prone Biden is. “Uncle Joe” told an African American church in 2012 election the Repubs want 2 put y’all back in chains
@amyklobuchar Its 1.5 million and most are not kids. Please quit lying and spinning the truth. If the govt shuts down again over non-citizens then it will fall on Dems again-Schumer shutdown once again. 	Border technology funded	DACA given pathway to citizenship	End lottery and chain migratn
@mkraju Brannon's conversations with POTUS is protected. It was for Obama admin folks. Take your head out of your ass manu and find Strzok and Page to ask them questions. So bias it's ridiculous. Time to boycott CNN until they return to real journalism which is unbiased
@GeorgiaDirtRoad Dems just want their votes. if how Dems treat African Americans then Hispanic votes will be taken for granted.  @Ana_Navarroe needs to shelve her hatred for POTUS and help hispanics not denigrate herself and her party with vulgarity
@AriFleischer I remember the McDonald's French fries from the 70s. Man those were so good!
@ponymule @benwikler This is not that hard to understand. Not a citizen + break the law= get deported. If you are not a citizen and don't have legal status then you don't belong here. what about the thousands waiting in line legally? Do you care about them and the rule of law?
@ponymule @benwikler Think about it...if I commit a crime as a US citizen then I get charged but not deported bc IM AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, now if you are not legal(undocumented immigrant) and you commit a crime then you do get deported. P.S. U dont know me so don't say u don't get to say I break laws

@DrMartyFox @younglady037833 @marklevinshow Rosenstein would have to recuse himself if DOJ investigates this matter.
@kwilli1046 @Dab7One Again....where is the proof? I wouldn’t be surprised but want proof this is true
@ponymule @benwikler DACA gets gr cards w pathway to citizenship	Fund border security	Undocumented immigrants need to come out of the shadows and rec legal statice w NO pathway to citizenship at the time
@ponymule @benwikler I’m a citizen.....you do understand that right? Nobody made him break the law or ignore a judges order. 	I believe compressive immigration reform is an easy fix but our leaders lack courage.
@benwikler @ponymule He broke the law....that’s why he was arrested. He overstayed his Visa and was told by a judge in 2011 to leave the country. He didn’t but he is now. It’s a shame he put himself at risk by BREAKING THE LAW
@imillhiser Smacks of the very liberal 9th Circuit-is the point
@chuckwoolery @Stonewall_77 HRC is delusional and has yet to take responsibility for her loss continuing instead to insist it was misogyny which is total BS. She was a weak and compromised candidate.
@kwilli1046 	Hey Kevin-I know I can count on you to provide the proof of or source for the narrative that McCabe said there would have never been a FISA warrant issued if they didn’t have the Steele Dossier. Can you provide this proof? I cant find it...thanks!
@CNNPolitics @jaketapper @joemanchin knows he is vulnerable due to the tremendous support for potus by West Virginians. He will break with his fellow Dems on this pending DACA and CR on the debt ceiling. He acts more like an Independent-which is a good thing.
@JohnBerman I heard him speak differently on another network. Sorry about your Pats and thx for your response
@SpockResists Vote Dem if you want bigger govt-more govt control of your life, paying more taxes. Vote Dem if you think the govt does a good job with your tax money. 	Vote Repub if you want smaller govt with states having more control with governing their citizens and want to pay less taxes
@JohnBerman 	John, I just watched ur interview with Rep Himes. Why didn’t you ask him why he claimed the memo would hurt natl security before the Memo was released and then claimed it was all about nothing when we saw the memo. Just another biased interview by CNN
@JoeNBC 	Great questioning of Rep Swalwell. He squealed fowl before memo was released. Hold him accountable!
@TomFitton @JessieJaneDuff @realDonaldTrump How do you know that McCabe said the FISA warrant would never have been given without the Steele dossier? You didn’t hear McCabe testify so how do you know what he said?
@dcexaminer Flake is so unpopular w repubs he wont run. Kasich will

@CROWENATION2016 @codeofvets @realDonaldTrump In the end,Wray is a lawyer and lawyers do what’s best for clients not what’s right. In this case he is trying to do fbi reputation damage control caused by a few rogue agents. He was Chris Christie attorney and hid CC cell phone during bridgegate investigation.
@foxandfriends @RedOwens Joy Reid is a POS. I’m not watching MSNBC or NBC anymore. The have Ly’in Brian, Morning Joke, etc all of which are unwatchable
@ktumulty Pantsuits? 	Wear what you want.
@KNP2BP @POTUS @GOP Schumer and Pelosi will be replaced
@JohnJHarwood What they did find re Benghazi is extreme incompetence resulting in 4 needless American deaths.
@ChrisCuomo But Chris you have to admit that Schiff is one of the most partisan politicians in DC and has been spinning this fact-less Russian collusion story for the past year-always “hinting” there is evidence but nothing there. 	And you know he will leak his 10page memo
@jpodhoretz I think they did find a few more classified emails. I remember ppl calling for her to be locked up
@NormEisen @POLITICOMag Wow I’m surprised you didn’t say Nazi too	You are the big lie Norm-f’d in the head backwards thinking numbskull
@GeorgiaDirtRoad Spicer recommends potus delay the release of the memo to ride SOTU speech. But any delay gives Dems a chance to leak their 10 pg memo before. You know it’s going to leak or at least portions of it. #releasethememo

@DrMartyFox I think @SenGillibrand should witness a 20 week abortion. There is no doubt that at 20 weeks-its a baby and NOT a viable tissue mass

@NormEisen Hope he doe fire Rosenstein
@DearAuntCrabby @middlechild91 @Lowes Going to Lowe’s? Can you pick me up some fertilizer? Ask for a bag of DNC Bullshit
@ChrisCuomo Of course it doesn’t meet the standard for obstruction which is why Mueller will be trying to trap potus into committing perjury
@zenjen53 @maggieNYT If its factual then i will be happy. Transparency and accountability. Im just sick of all the law breaking and bias media.
@AriMelber McCabe should have recused himself way before 1 week before the election. You can try to put a positive spin on his career but he was up to no good
@maggieNYT You still cant accept that Donald Trump is President. Your bias and unprofessional journalism is on record. Cant trust you. I actually wonder what you will do when Mueller doesnt find obstruction of justice or collusion.
@DrMartyFox Comey has a distorted sense of right and wrong. Needs to be brought up to capital hill
@kwilli1046 Ima social progressive and a fiscal conservative and I dont believe FBI/DOJ on anything Obama. They are protecting him for some reason. Need a special prosecutor now
@SharylAttkisson SSpecial prosecutor needs to be appointed on FBI/DOJ involvement in a conspiracy to affect a presidential election. Anything short of that will cause a tremendous amount of distrust of these institutions known for unbiased investigations
@TheLeadCNN It’s your last hope to end Trump Presidency. That’s why you are pushing for him to testify.
@SteveRattner Yet you had a fund raising dinner for HRC who is married to a sexual assaulter Bill Clinton	You have ZERO credibility	GFY

@WalshFreedom Exactly right Joe! Transparency and accountability across the board.	A reckoning is coming
@jaketapper Do you remember who Chris Christie’s lawyer was during bridge gate? Wray. Investigators asked Christie for his cell phone but it turned up missing. Guess where they found it-in Wrays safe after investigation concluded.

@CillizzaCNN That would be the end of McConnell if he doesnt address DACA with that hard deadline looming in March. Its going to get done regardless so get border security $$ and end lottery and chain migration.
@DrMartyFox @realDonaldTrump With this new revelation of "lost" text messages, we now need a Special Prosecutor appointed. Where is the oversight.
@SRuhle @DonaldJTrumpJr You think you are being clever but all you are doing is showing your hatred for POTUS and allowing your  hatred to compromise your journalistic integrity if you ever had it to start with. You know DAMN well what he meant.
@dbongino @prepper1776 March Director Wray up to the hill! He has a lot of explaining to do. Might be time to fire him too if he cant straighten that shit show known as the FBI out. #specialcouncil

@angelijka8 LOL? Pathetic self aggrandizing selfies. Me Me Me	 I didnt blame Russia 4 any problems I simply pointed out that they interfered in our election.Putin kills or jails political opponents and u are proud of that? Perhaps... you are a fake Russian account providing disinformation
@_Jrlh_ @angelijka8 Good idea	How about Russia involvement into US election
@angelijka8 U are so shallow that u think everyone who follows you is doing so bc they like or respect you. They dont. Russia tried to tank our election and as far as im concerned that includes shallow Angie who prob takes selfies every 2 minutes. 	WE dont kill political enemies-Putin does
@angelijka8 S T U P I D 	Your profile pic is a picture of YOU taking a picture of YOU.	Russia sucks and so do you. Russia is an extremely corrupt govt and yet you are PROUD to be Russian. You should be ashamed if you had a soul.	All you really care about is YOU YOU YOU	Pathetic
@angelijka8 Ok-YOU are stupid. I responded bc Im sick of you and your distorted view of the facts. Should I define distorted for you?
@rolandsmartin Dinning out in Chicago? It might be warming up but make sure you dont get your ass shot off. https://t.co/xTd1NxkQv4
@angelijka8 You are not very smart are you? You should probably think about not talking about things you really dont understand but you are too stupid to realize this. Russia sucks-run by a muderer.
@rolandsmartin Cmon Roland-That's bc they are students and they dont get to make money while attending college.
@DanOHerrin @GeorgiaDirtRoad Asshole with teeth
@JoeMyGod I hope she loses based on her unwillingness to do her job. She could have passed on all same sex marriage license to someone who didnt feel like it violated their religious values.
@KingAbdullahII God bless you King Abdullah
@ChrisCuomo your interview of Samantha POwers was a joke. You didnt ask her any tough questions like Do you believe Iran is involved in state sponsored terrorism? Then why did the Obama admin give Iran MILLIONS of dollars which will be used to kill Americans? #biasedreporting
@GeorgiaDirtRoad @realDonaldTrump the fact that Mueller is requesting an interview with Trump signals an end to the investigation like when the FBI interviewed HRC last before ending that investigation.
@1776Stonewall @DrSueDVM what study? 	Is this Fake news?	Provide a source please or STFU
@IngrahamAngle @JoeNBC Unwatchable-Truth is they had such low ratings that they decided to go negative 24/7 on POTUS to attract those viewers which are more numerous. Ruined what was a good balanced show even if the 3rd hour is a repeat of the first 2.
@DRUDGE_REPORT Obama should have his library built in the Chicago inner cities where there is so much murder and suffering. 	He has done nothing to help curb the violence
@MarshaBlackburn @Sailguy62 @realDonaldTrump You are just another Professional Political Phony-you are for sale. RESIGN and let a real person take your seat
@BillKristol Keep it up Bill and I will mute you
@CBSNews Miller had Tapper on the ropes!
@JuddLegum @ezraklein wasn’t right about the last presidential election-Trumps victory so it’s hilarious that he thinks he knows what will happen 3 years from now.
@WayneDupreeShow It is a joke	Oprah is too smart	I think she would have a better shot at winning over Michelle Obama and Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren
@RealJamesWoods Morning joe is unwatchable anyways. They only hate talk potus. They ruined a good show by neg coverage of trump
@steelers @heinzfield Get ready for an ass whooping Jax!
@YoureInTheKNOW @rolandsmartin @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @SHSanders45 @SarahHuckabee Too big! So you agree! Thx
@jpodhoretz @benshapiro Cmon @SteveRattner -you are being shady here. What are the numbers Jan 20 to Jan 19 for each?
@rolandsmartin @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump Barrack Obama could have had so much more success if he wasn't so hell-bent on adding 1000s of regulations. You see... thats the problem with you Dems-you think Big Govt is the answer for everything. Its not. Name 1 thing the govt does well-I dare you
RT @brunelldonald: Lord many Americans don't have or can't afford health insurance, others are pawning valuables to make ends meet, homeles…
@rolandsmartin @BarackObama @realDonaldTrump @PressSec @SHSanders45 @SarahHuckabee Cmon Roland-you know damn well that this administration is just getting going when it comes to the economy. It is true that Pres Obama was given a terrible situation. 2 wars-bad economy and thats why he should have never been elected. The job was to big for his skill set
@President1Trump @kwilli1046 @POTUS Dr Evil should have never been invited into the WH-thats on Steve Bannon. Its all about the money which makes me sick
@PoliticalShort Get on this story @ChrisCuomo 	Quit putting your party (Dem) before truth
@BillKristol There you go again Bill-Wishful thinking.	Im an Independent so I have no loyalty to either party but I think the Dems will get hurt more when this Russia investigation concludes.
@WalshFreedom Time for Sessions to go. He is not doing his job. He misrepresented what he would and wouldn’t do re weed during his conf hearings. His views represent the 1950s like Roy Moore. 	#fireSessions
@ChicagosMayor  https://t.co/U9nfctlCH8
@cedthatruth @rolandsmartin @realDonaldTrump I think you are exactly right Mr Hall- they are all trying to get rich with book deals starting w HRC but she couldn't sell enough books -followed by Donna Brizile who provided very revealing insight into what really happens behind the scenes.
@rebeccaballhaus @RosieGray @bykowicz @hookjan Man i hope they get rid of Bannon. He is toxic and frankly self-important. He thinks he is a co-prez or something.	Toxic-say bye bye Mercers

@NormEisen HRC used an illegal server and sent/rec classified information. She broke the law. Its about transparency and accountability-my question to you Norm is what do you have against everybody being held to the same standard? I hope Sessions looks into Eric Holders fast and furious too
@TerryMcAuliffe @realDonaldTrump I live in Virginia and I know you as a liar. You allowed 1000's of convicted felons to get their voting rights back just in time to vote in the last election no doubt for the Democrates. 	You are a true sleeze and I hope you run for prez in 2020-you will be exposed

@davidfrum I want to know what brand of whiskey Bannon drinks. I’m buying that stock!
@jimgeraghty Watch to see what potus does regarding someone going after his kid. This should be great fireworks.
@TheMikeClayton1 @MAGARoseTaylor They could make a lot of money selling tickets for ppl to watch
@TrumpsDC @prepper1776 Evidence gathered by the FBI on the illegal HRC server/send-rec classified emails should be put before a grand jury. Nobody gets a pass
@TheTweetOfGod @ChairmanBuckley Hell no
@michellemalkin Bachman needs to stay gone. She was under investigation for campaign finance corruption the last time she was in office. We need new blood not old retread politicians.

@President1Trump @RuthieRedSox @RepMattGaetz This guy has a dui	Can’t you find someone in congress that hasn’t blatantly broke the law? 	No credibility
@GeorgiaDirtRoad @RepMattGaetz NO no no-Let Mueller finish-if there are any bs indictments then potus can pardon but the goal should be to get this over with.

@chuckwoolery Who cares. Obama will go down as one of the worst presidents in history.
@SenFeinstein No exceptions needed. How about taking care of your own citizens first for a change. It’s what u pledged-to defend the constitution !!!
@MichaelJMorell Don’t trust Morell	He protected And supported HRC. 	Do not trust this conniving ex spy.
@Zac_Petkanas @TheDemCoalition That’s bs and you know it. Why don’t you try to be honest here and not spin or distort the truth.

@KatrinaPierson You are contributing to fake news here until the facts are revealed.

@DanRather @sweepea909 You lost your job for lying about Bush-can’t trust anything you say. A journalist willing to write lies should be run out of journalism. 	So STFU
@RealJamesWoods Aptly named Flake found his courage to speak out against potus after he decided not to run again because he couldn’t win. 	He is a coward and a phony

@GeorgiaDirtRoad @RepMattGaetz We don’t need a new law we just need to follow the ones we have and make sure nobody gets a pass bc of their celebrity. 	HRC email/server evidence needs to be put before a grand jury. 	All Russia interference/collusion needs to be exposed no matter who gets caught up in it.
@steph93065 Where did you get those numbers?
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch Let the Mueller investigation cont to its conclusion and the country will be better off. 	Let’s get this behind us-
@TomFitton @JudicialWatch The truth is, if you will allow it into your psyche, is that potus firing Comey, caused the appointment of Mueller. 	That is a fact
@benshapiro Stupidity
@Karoli Another closed-minded bias “journalist” cnn did not need.
@gopgirl13 @GeorgiaDirtRoad Sick of you @Ana_Navarroe 	Here is a pic of you and the sexual predator @BillClinton that you bragged about seeing and taking a pic with. Did you not believe the many women? 	There is something wrong with you https://t.co/DJh9jUvqv7
@nycjim @Fahrenthold Shame the tax cuts couldn’t include hedge fund mgrs who dont pay taxes like the rest of us. Not sure why he couldn’t get that done-its very disappointing especially since he promised to fix that while he was candidate Trump. Maybe those rich hedge fund mgrs will contribute to RNC
@hotfunkytown @prepper1776 Fire Mueller and this Russia bs will never be over. Let him finish and keep an eye out for those investigators with extreme bias like McCabe	Let’s face it-if Trump didn’t fire Comey then there would have never been a special prosecutor appointed.

@DrMartyFox I’d guess McCabe will be able to retire before the 90 days. He will be subpoenaed and will plead the 5th
@DrMartyFox @RepMattGaetz Evidence of HRC use of private server/send-rec classified emails should be put before a grand jury. PERIOD	Anything less is a scandal and needs to be investigated
@SRuhle @IvankaTrump Fuck you- you POS	You know nothing
@mkraju @alexburnsNYT @mj_lee The disgusting Farenthold deserves due process like all citizens. The real cowardice is not calling for ethics investigation which would surely force him to resign.

@PoliticalShort Ohr is a POS and needs to testify under oath what he knew and who he told. His wife worked for Fusion GPS for gods sake. Cant make this stuff up.
Well said @samstein regarding Al Franken and his sexual misconduct allegations-ur right-he did bring this trouble on himself.	Even if these photos were just an attempt at humor, he deeply offended the women and doesn’t belong in govt.

@DrMartyFox Wish we would send SEALS and other special forces to attack drugs at the source no matter what country. Drugs are an attack on our society-
@KellyannePolls What’s the difference? Your lack of condemnation of Roy Moore IS an endorsement for him.

@kwilli1046 Ah cmon-I despise the clintons but nothing illegal here-it wasn’t weapons grade uranium and 9 cabinet members signed off on the deal. Too much misinformation and wishful thinking

@SenFeinstein What’s your tax plan Dianne?
@larryelder @RevJJackson Sounds right to me
@kwilli1046 Took her how many years to call him out?	Pretty clear the left wants the Clintons gone for good
@DrMartyFox While few can stand the likes of Gloria Allred/self promoting POS-I believe the women. Roy Moores racist/homophobic comments disqualify him
@NewtTrump Its the fault of the prosecutors for not making a good enough case and over cooking the charges. Focus on obvious felonies and no overreach
@ChicagosMayor How many ppl got shot?
@GretchenCarlson Doctors do the same thing Gretchen-
@RealJamesWoods If it were weapons grade uranium then yes
@RepByrne That money will have to go to paying for the increase in healthcare costs you pos. Do your job and fix healthcare which starts with transparency in ins costs and increase competition. 	Quit playing politics-disgusting

@carrieksada @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL Thanks Carrie
@JudyChristner @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL I get that-anybody who hates someone can just make it up. Witness needs to come forward and tell their story. Easy to deny story too
@LilesSr @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL Both parties for sure-	Msm bias is systemic-
@jackcellis48 @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL That's the court definition of a criminal act-not the same burden of proof in the Public Court of Oppinion
@jackcellis48 @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL I dont know that you can prove it 30 years later-just need to examine the account of what each side says. Innocent before proven guilty but
@SilverSummerSun @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL Accuser account of the sexual assault should be examined-bc of Weinstein -sexual assaults are being revealed all over the country
@SilverSummerSun @DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL Sexual assault victims dont always report the assault immediately or at all sometimes due to shame or guilt etc..BUT
@DrMartyFox They timed the Billy Bush/Trump open mic rec too it doesn’t mean it didn’t happen. Innocent until proven guilty-yes but I believe the women
@MooreSenate Moore looks and thinks like George Wallace of the 70s. His views on gays and Muslims should disqualify him. He will lose Bigly
@Vanniivy007 @TIME I know and that is unbelievably sad but here are his own words-sorry it’s from Fox	https://t.co/U298OoFFy6

@DrMartyFox @judgeroymooreAL I can’t believe u could support this man Doc 	If Moore had sex with a 14 year old then game over. He needs to step aside
@SenJohnBarrasso @SenateGOP You probably couldn’t even pass gas the way Congress is operating these days. Recent midterm results should have ur warning bells dinging

@RealJamesWoods @prepper1776 The blame belongs to Trump-his piss poor leadership, constant tweeter attacks, and his lack of understanding of legislative process
@1055anton @CLIFF_IT_Aero_ @JenniferGassman @docrocktex26 @Dolores22967974 Funny-anytime Sessions is on a show you can tell he is tiptoeing around all the potus questions. Definitely afraid of losing his job
@AndrewWiggin502 @CLIFF_IT_Aero_ @docrocktex26 @Dolores22967974 Maybe but I think he has a problem listening too which,in some ways, is worse	We deserve better
@JohnPaul_USA @2000Armyofone Guns are the great equalizer-nobody can lay a hand on you if you are trained to protect yourself w a gun
@JohnPaul_USA @2000Armyofone I recommend every gun hating lib to go to ur local shooting range and take a lesson from an instructor,rent a gun and learn to shoot.
@peterdaou @Dolores22967974 @BarackObama AND Obama sold more guns and ammo (indirectly) than any 1 person in history so this small victory but please look at all he did,didn’t do
@peterdaou @Dolores22967974 @BarackObama Obama was responsible for landslide defeat of Dems in 2010 which Dems have still not recovered from-Repubs own Congress/WH-
@docrocktex26 @Dolores22967974 Sessions is so happy being AG but most of us are not. He is incompetent at best and a liar worst case. Fire and replace

@GovHowardDean Trumps team would have accepted help from the devil to get elected but so to would have Clinton campaign-No dignity in politics including u
@Amy_Siskind You just prove that there is no dignity in partisan politics. I couldn’t spend 1 second in your mind the way you think. #bigpicture
@Amy_Siskind You truly are out of touch. Have you even spoken out against Chicago Mayor who does nothing abt the over 500 shootings just this year
@shondarhimes @ChairmanBuckley Then what do you recommend? And please don’t say “common sense” gun control measures without specific details.
@BetteMidler @ChairmanBuckley WE are a gun nation-guns are not going away...certainly u realize that. Over 300 million guns in America only criminals and nut jobs abuse
@Daily_Express Prince William left his wedding ring by the kitchen sink and forgot to put it back on after he did dishes....duh
@ChrisCuomo Why doesnt MSM stop broadcasting the shooters name. It just encourages other sickos to do same. MSM complicit? Responsible journalism?
@PeterSweden7 @Dab7One That gun was not illegal...need to make it more diff for sickos to get guns but congress is run by cowards
@GovHowardDean The DNC has undermined American democracy...but u don’t want to admit that and Dems r going to keep losing
@davidfrum @GovHowardDean Want proof nothing will happen re guns by congress? You can still buy bump stocks-congress =cowards
@davidfrum @GovHowardDean Wrong-prayer and a gun in the hands of a responsible gun owner will mitigate evil. Ur thinking is why u liberal Dems lost&amp;will keep losing.
@BarackObama Shame you couldn’t have been more of a leader-with the exception of blowing up most ppls insurance-you did nothing-Nobel peace prize my ass
@KamalaHarris You can start with the mayor of Chicago....incompetent and does not care abt his owns citizens as much as undocumented immigrants

@ScottPresler That’s ignorant-Don’t compare sexual harassment with DNC corruption

@SaraCarterDC This is the kind of crap that drives ppl crazy. DWS should be investigated now. Shady leaders like her are not above the law.Wheres DOJ?
@mmurraypolitics Remember how DNC kept their donor list from Bernie?
@maziehirono Truth is nobody knows what companies will do w the extra $. All public co have to show everything.

@NIVIsa4031 @kwilli1046 HRC is fading into irrelevancy along w Bill. Schumer and Pelosi need to step aside too but there are no good leaders to take over.
@JulianAssange Brazil’s just making sure that HRC will not be able to run again. Watch out for a Michelle Obama run in 2020
@kwilli1046 @ArizonaKayte Anybody who thinks HRC will be investigated by this doj is smoking crack-they haven’t even cut $ for sanctuary cities. Dysfunction continues

@UriBlago @TIME @RevJJackson doesnt seem to care-the incompetent mayor still in office-ppl keep getting murdered https://t.co/vk6h0NXzwO

@AjadeanPiper @mc8896 @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo 	I recommend somebody that’s going to Marshall local and federal resources and not play politics
@AjadeanPiper @mc8896 @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo i’m on the side of the suffering people in PR not the mayor wanted to make a political statement
@AjadeanPiper @mc8896 @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo you need a new news source then
@mc8896 @AjadeanPiper @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo 	Sorry but ITS HER JOB to make sure she attends FEMA meetings to get what she needs 4 her folks
@AjadeanPiper @mc8896 @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo 	I personally find potus tweeter attacks disgusting- but that mayor is playing politics-
@AjadeanPiper @mc8896 @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo 	I wouldn’t let politics get in the way of helping ppl-again...reporters are on the ground also
@mc8896 @AjadeanPiper @pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo Instead of addressing the human suffering she decided to play politicsand it￼
@mc8896 @AjadeanPiper @pomiwi66 there are reporters on the ground who have yet to find one dead person to blame on trump.
@abbydphillip They refused bc they don’t trust you to tell the truth or to provide real updates and not witch hunts. Bias all the way
@pomiwi66 @ChrisCuomo 	Maria devastated the island but There are over 70 mayors in pr and she is the only one complaining
@ChrisCuomo Yet you are not reporting that the mayor is not attending crucial meetings with FEMA etc...	CNN incapable of balance in reporting

@ChrisCuomo @NewDay And ur dislike of @KellyannePolls is palpable when she is on. 	DNC/Ukraine meeting is a story u nvr report but Russia is 75% of CNN coverage
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay When Bernie is on you never ask him abt FBI investigation of wife and u have yet to report Bob Menendez (dem)corruption trial.
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay New Day may be more of a news show than Morn Joe but it's still an opinion show	Evidence: softball questions to Dems show ur bias like
@amjoyshow @MalcolmNance @JoyAnnReid @DavidCayJ Joy Reid-classless hack who attacked Rep Steve Scalise while he was fighting 4 his life in the Hosp. FYI-I turn the channel when she is on
@superyayadize And if he doesn't get a pardon then he will spill the beans on Repubs	He is lucky Hillary didn't win-she wanted to "drone" him

@RWPUSA @WSJ Pardon is a Non-starter
@superyayadize Rev Al once encourage the murder of police officers	How can NBC allow him on the air?
@hrkbenowen @lisafedup Congressional Subpoenas mean nothing these days-unfortunately 	Not sure he broke any laws but he does have some explaining to do

@Billybobtn @hrtablaze @TrumpOnly2020 It's not Trumps job to do Congresses job-way past time 4 term limits	Nothing's getting done	Potus can push agenda w bipartisan help
@BillKristol DTs becoming a politician-should not worry abt base-should focus on fixing the problems as he promised		Infrastructure 	Tax cuts	Healthcare
@BillKristol Some of us voted for Trump bc of all the disfunction in DC-has nothing to do w $ or ed.Repubs and Dems NEVER do what they say they will do.
@laurie_voss @GovHowardDean This is Dirk	I just wanted to learn more abt ur "criminal" comment-	MSM continues to speculate but offers no proof-facts matter
@TheRickWilson As an Independent I don't support either party but	How did u come down on Obamas "if u like your dr u can keep ur dr-period"???
@laurie_voss @GovHowardDean Repubs? Proof? 	Lots of smoke but no smoking gun -if Mueller finds criminality then I'm all for prosecution but no real proof...yet
@GovHowardDean Again, Governor....time to focus on the Dems lack of having message voters can get on board with-don't worry abt England-u live here-right?
@GovHowardDean You should focus on ur own party Dr Dean-Dems don't even have a message anymore except Hating all things Trump and a Russia nothing burger
@ClayTravis Skipper and Hill should be fired-there are certain things in our society that should not be tolerated. Boycott ESPN sponsors now.

@WayneDupreeShow We have to end this type of BS and elect ppl who will address illegal immigration once and for all. EITHER WE HAVE LAWS OR WE DONT
@WayneDupreeShow The entire council should be arrested and fired. It is illegal for non-citizens to vote. Sessions better step in or he should be fired
@WayneDupreeShow Fire her and the rest will fall inline - I'm not watching espn until they do and we should boycott the sponsors
@stephenfhayes And Obama gave $1.7 billion to fund Irans terrorism-	Obamas "strategic patients" is way more dangerous than Trumps NKorea rhetoric-
@rolandsmartin Her continued employment is unacceptable-by allowing her to stay, ESPN has endorsed her misguided message. 	I will not watch anything ESPN
@WayneDupreeShow ESPN just fired a bunch of excellent reporters. Time to let her go and hire back
@brianstelter @MalcolmNance @jemelehill 	Are you going to call her a "gal" too Brian?
@brianstelter "One tough gal"????	In the progressive world, you just made a huge mistake. "Gal" as a descriptor is never acceptable 1/2
@RealMikeWilbon @gingrpimpernel She will lose her job	ESPN has no choice
@RealMikeWilbon @gingrpimpernel If that's true and you really do support Jemelle Hill then why don't you call Trump a white supremacist publicly?
@JulianAssange She already blames Bill-his Meeting w Loretta Lynch on the tarmac in Arizona caused Lynch to recuse herself and Comey to take lead
@FrederickARuss @elphiegale
@AC360 She would not be blaming so many others now if she truly understood that it was HER decision to obfuscate the truth. She lost to a clown
@AC360 She lost bc she chose to use a private server to do State Dept business AND refused to take responsibility when it was revealed. #Flawed

@williamlegate @sweepea909 Cmon-thats not Fox its @EboniKWilliams personal opinion which I totally agree with but its not a Fox News position-they support TRUMP
@Marshall_Cohen @davidfrum Was this before or after he manhandled a woman reporter? He lied about that and cant be trusted to tell the truth.
@ChrisCuomo Thoughts?? I would like to hear abt Debbie Wasserman Schultz IT scandal...and DNC meeting w Ukraine re DT dirt	You lack courage-CNN is bias
@ShaunKing @rolandsmartin Did you report this to the police?
@CillizzaCNN Define bias as it relates to journalism.....CNN? MSNBC? CBS? ABC?
@donnabrazile What now? Leaking questions to Dems before a presidential debate..shame on you
@VanJones68 you don't have to be a victim… You know that don't you van
@matthewjdowd 	Don't you just get tired of being negative all the time and spreading negative propaganda ? Pathetic
@DWStweets You owe the American ppl your resignation
@AlisonForKY She wasn't even honest enough to admit she voted for Obama. She lost the election bc of her lack of transparency-not to be trusted
@EvelynNFarkas @WIRED You worked in govt during Obama years-why didnt he do something abt Russia hacking in 2014 when he was given proof by intel agencies?
@KateBolduan why would you allow 1 out of 3 guests on your show talk over everyone? Terrible
@davidaxelrod @RepGutierrez This guy is being investigated for paying his wife campaign money and was arrested protecting undoc immigrants-should be serving citizens
@GovWalker How much will it cost tax payers in subsidies?
@dcexaminer Nazi is the other "N" word that should never be uttered.	He did it to himself
@kthalps Who....TRUMP?
@CillizzaCNN @gabrielsherman DT is probably trying to have it both ways-condemn but not offend part of his base. It back fired
@jaketapper He was going 2quit anyway-DT is going after drug prices 	Keep an eye on big pharma lobbyist-they will attemp to "BUY" politicians to stop
@dcherring Obama was a terrible president-did nothing to prevent Russia from hacking our election when he knew abt it in 2014-
@MarkDice @Billybobtn That's right-remember the riots in Maryland after Freddie Gray death-Obama did nothing
@stephenasmith @ChrisCuomo @CNN @VanJones68 Respectfully disagree-Coumo has had Bernie on the show plenty of times and has yet to ask him abt FBI investigation of his wife-dem bias
@RevJJackson @MakeItPlain @ministter Time for you to get angry Rev and work to remove Mayor Emanuel 	How many murders in Chicago this year? https://t.co/rhRr8N0ZyE
@DRUDGE_REPORT Need tax reform not tax cuts

@ChrisCuomo "At the end of the day" has to go
@brianstelter @seanhannity Yes go on	Discrimination law suit against CNN	95% of CNN reporters are opinion reporters-we should never know what a real journalist thinks
@MyREButterfly @Harlan @realDonaldTrump 	Their warheads can't survive the heat of re-entry. So put the breaks on
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump 	You want war so badly then join up and request SKoria deployment 	Your master got 5 FIVE deferments.
@Stafford2cj @mitchellvii @tessyto @HillaryClinton There is a reason Podesta never ran for President-his past couldn't take the scrutiny
@SenSanders @StateDept Well Bill Clinton allowed N Korea to develop nukes and Obama did nothing to make sure they don't launch a deliverable warhead #wakeupBernie
@brianstelter @KJ_Online FURY
@GlennThrush @brianstelter I liked Pres Bush (43) response to DT inaugural speech	"That's some weird shit"
@BillKristol @Harlan But his high school is out for summer break!
@ChrisMurphyCT Doesn't matter	You can't treat uncivilized ppl in a civilized manner-they take it as weakness	Rest easy-Generals know what to do
@WayneDupreeShow Short answer is DT could ask DOJ/Sessions to look into it but hasn't. 	Why?	AND	Why hasn't John Koskenin/IRS Commissioner been fired?
@politico This is why Panetta would make a terrible president-comments like this show how low he will go...in the gutter w trump
@CillizzaCNN It means that if N Korea actually launches even 1 missile at us or our allies-they will cease to exist. Anybody doubt DT would nuke them?
@MeetThePress Well.....it was good to see Russert again at least
@rolandsmartin Nice of Stephen Miller to take his head out of Trumps ass long enough to do interviews. This is a guy who walks around w FU expression
@TPM Ask the women who have had to endure unwanted sexual advances by powerful men.
@RevJJackson https://t.co/CDuIg8KjE5
@WayneDupreeShow Time to arm Japan with nukes unless China can step in.
@koester_liz @markknoller @maggieNYT @SecPriceMD You can tell he is lying-his lips are moving	Reminds me of a sleazy used car salesman
@markknoller @SecPriceMD Did Price receive discounted shares of the company producing the vaccine??
@Billybobtn @Harlan @trish_regan @FoxBusiness We need that yesterday but how do we get there?
@matthewjdowd They are worried about N Korea
@brhodes That 2015 attack was committed by a hateful racist kid. There is no extremist movement to kill ppl of color. Wouldn't b tolerated by society
@SteveRattner There is ZERO uncertainty here	DT is defundingACA to accelerate collapse 	He &amp; Repubs will pay a price at the polls if enough ppl get hurt
@RealJamesWoods @FoxNews 	Bill Clinton had a chance to kill OBL in the 90s and didn't.
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay 	any news on Debbie Wasserman Schultz IT issues. It's a real story that you're not covering.
@Amy_Siskind 	I like her too but I have a friend from South Carolina who says there are lots of rumors about her multiple affairs
@RevJJackson @rolandsmartin @Suntimes Do something Rev-Mayor has to go and u know it	Putting non citizens before our hurting citizens is a dereliction of duty-organize&amp;fire rahm https://t.co/bAZFiuMvFI
@RWPUSA @rolandsmartin @newsline Well deserved "calling out" of Maxine Waters-she is disgusting	She always over plays the RACE card-She doesn't even live in her own district
@nytmike @rolandsmartin NYT also broke Clinton emails,private server story too	NYTs Trump hating campaign is inappropriate 	Should stick to real journalism,facts
@billclinton In 2015 Clinton Foundation took in more than 140 million and only distributed 9 million.
@seanhannity Facts matter too so quit making them up
@elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump You lied about your heritage to further your career-what else are you willing to do or lie about-you cant be trusted	https://t.co/8Cr1jowAwR
@seanhannity You are truly F'd in the head-	You along w potus/MSM serve only to divide us	Not sure why anyone would watch your show	It's full of lies
@seanhannity From the phony Seth Rich conspiracy which almost got you fired to suggesting firing of Mueller which will prolong the investigation
@davidaxelrod B I N G O
@mitchellreports Dems either	Switch to Independent	Be loyal to country and rule of law instead of being loyal to a party
@Evan_McMullin U have a Burden of Proof problem	Mueller sitting 2 grand jury's is a good thing but doesnt mean guilt. Should have had a grand jury for HRC
@SteveRattner Would anybody be surprised if DT decides to go back to his old life after 1 term?
@brianstelter How's that CNN discrimination lawsuit coming along, Bri?
You are clearly bias-so why didn't u ask the question and why aren't you covering wasserman-Schultz IT story? I'll answer 4 you-bc u r bias https://t.co/LxneZF2mPk
@ChrisCuomo Clear bias on ur part
@ChrisCuomo If DTs wife was being investigated by the FBI and he came on ur show-would you ask him abt the investigation? YES-butYou did not ask Bernie
@amjoyshow @MaxineWaters UNWATCHABLE
@Billybobtn @StevieDougie @JayS2629 Its the uncertainty of how many ppl will be dropped by repeal-I like Grahams bill that would give Governors block grant $ direct to States.
@StevieDougie @Billybobtn @JayS2629 McCain just wanted a bill he could work with. He is also trying to get the Senate to work together again. U should respect his service
@FoxNews Not sure why we even bother w Afghanistan -
@Harlan Pelosi would never allow @MaxineWaters to be speaker nor would other members. Max is a lightening rod for crazy
@Billybobtn @JayS2629 How many years did you spend in a Vietnam prison Bill?	You may be frustrated w McCain but you should never disrespect him-apologize
@RealJamesWoods @Billybobtn Single Payer will worsen fraud and waste-Fed Govt does NOTHING well so why add to its responsibility when it cant handle what they have
@HeyTammyBruce 	Can't trust ANY politician to do the right thing these days unless the polls show they can gain votes/support	#termlimits
@erindmorreall @goldengateblond That is disgusting-Uncle Joe is a great American.
@matthewjdowd @GretchenCarlson 	These pics were from a few years ago right? Nothing recent-they suspended him so they have fixed the culture
@DrMartyFox Good point Doc	Still can't believe MSM is not reporting this and Wasserman Schultz story
@dcexaminer @RevJJackson 	Do something Rev-Mayor has got to go https://t.co/IwFAjFIASB
@rolandsmartin @DLoesch @NRATV @nytimes @Trevornoah @iamsambee If you were a real journalist ppl would not know your opinion-you would report the news...you know...facts?	No pure news outlets left #bias

@trish_regan what's the workforce participation
@RealJamesWoods Trumps lying is pathologic
@marclamonthill Mistakes made, debt to society paid	Creating Productive member of society should be priority.
@marclamonthill Need rehab thru education and training of a trade with pathway to a job after released. Not sure why anyone would disagree-
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump @ThisHour Need to impanel a grand jury for HRC crimes
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump @ThisHour Mueller is widely respected. The fact that he is hiring dem supporters is a good thing. Dems cant claim inside job
@Harlan @realDonaldTrump @ThisHour Ken Star/Whitewater was truly a waste of tax payer money. Clintons left a whole list of destroyed/dead friends/supporters in their wake
@BoDietl You watch-Blaz thinks he can be president-he has such an inaccurate self perception-disgusting person
@MarthaP14109814 @fab4mam @mitchellvii @Tomvegas1 Find your local townhall w congress person if they have the courage to have one

@JohnBerman 	Don't feel bad-nobody has been right about anything since before the last election cycle
@GottaLaff @PrincessBravato 	just in time for tromp to get locked up. Thanks
@GottaLaff @PrincessBravato so what was the big announcement
@GottaLaff @PrincessBravato 	Do we know what trumps announcement is?
@matthewjdowd 	Stay on POTUS et al	Grand jury will sort them out	Can't wait to see who they charge
@seanhannity @SHSanders45 You are unwatchable-you love to hear the sound of your own voice but I think you learned ur lesson on Seth Rich BS
@davidaxelrod 	POTUS lies so much that it is easy to believe he would say something like that instead of being humbled to live in OUR WH
@ChrisCuomo 	We have too many citizens hurting to devote resources to non citizens 	But parents should be let in to be with family
@brianstelter Here is a lawsuit you will never report Bri	https://t.co/2Gyto39yc2
@Amy_Siskind He announced that policy to distract MSM from Russia and it worked....for a day or so
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay Ok u have the Russia story covered but what about dnc/Ukraine story for balance and Wassean Schultz IT story???
@CNNPolitics @NewDay @ChrisCuomo Why are you silent on DNC/Ukuraine story and Debbie Wasserman Schultz story?
@SteveRattner The wall is not a priority-illegal immigration dropped 70%	Tax cuts	Infrastructure 	Healthcare
@SteveRattner Please tell the whole truth-complete picture	I follow you to get the truth about real numbers to hold leadership accountable
@SteveRattner You also know that during the Obama years the stock market was the only place to make money bc interest rates were so low
@SteveRattner Show the worker participation rate-do you have that info?
@SteveRattner Cmon Rattner-You know that its about worker participation. You dont actually believe that we are only 4.4% away from full employment
@jamalhbryant @rolandsmartin @AprilDRyan Omarosa has to earn her 179k some how	Smacks of J Edgar Hoovers FBI back in the day	Keeping records on ppl
@donnabrazile Hannity isnt a serial sexual harasser and brings in the advertising $	BUT	Ive nvr heard anyone love the sound of his own voice more than him
@peterdaou Nobody was more surprised Trump won than Trump	White working class really likes DT and actually voted
@peterdaou Not sure how you can say that-	DT + Populist Message + Wiki leaks/drip drip + Comey + No Dem Message + poor candidate/HRC = Trump win
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump If you are honest-which you are not then you would admit low interest rates were the reason for strong stock market during Obama not so w DT
@CNNPolitics I bet he still puts it on his resume
@AprilDRyan @CNN @Scaramucci 	My gut says Scaramucci wife won. 	Put her thing down with the threat of the big D-he didn't want to lose fam
@ericgarland 	Kelly ann ?
@TPM I believe Zinke	But	He didn't deny just said "laughable"
@BillKristol Now you are sinking to DT level	Just making yourself look bad, Bill	Beneath you	Don't let DT steal ur dignity
@goldengateblond You cant trust anything Dick Morris says-Remeber when he said Romney would beat Obama easily-even Fox fired him.	He makes a living by lying
@CNNSotu @SenSanders Bias alert: @jaketapper never ask @SenSanders about the FBI investigation of his wife...he would have if he were a repub
@RevJJackson @swoolhandler 	Except there would be even more waste and fraud. We need real solutions Rev-why not help Chicago=murders
@adrienneelrod His wife just had a baby......not sure if he went home	He did a terrible job w MSM since he took over comms so he was reeled in
@realDonaldTrump Idiot-you couldreplace ACA with the help of dems	3 repub senators aren't budging-u have to know that, right?	No amount of bullying will work
@AprilDRyan @jk_rowling Reince should feel like Dobby from Harry Potter	Dobby is free https://t.co/7WzRk9R9Pv
@brianstelter Marital bliss......
@PrincessBravato POTUS is unteachable
@RTDNEWS They have a brand new slogan that was ripped off from papa Johns pizza
@foxnewspolitics @brookefoxnews Question is will MSM report it
@chucktodd	Idiot=POTUS
@ericgarland @steph_bello 	Broken clock is right twice a day!
@maggieNYT Where is the reckoning of this administration? Guess we have to wait until 2018
@maggieNYT Trump doesnt even realize that his speech hurts the police in reputation and in lowering tensions-that speech promotes hate towards police
@radleybalko @markos Just 1 more example of TRUMP dividing us even more	No sense of decorum or appropriateness 	Divider in Chief
@Amy_Siskind That's not even close to being true	Trump knows he can trust generals-they keep there mouths shut for a living-no leaking-Duty 1st
@DrMartyFox Conservatives = Intolerance	FYI -its not just your country	Join Independent movement so you dont have to support BS from either parties
@ericgarland And....anytime he is on MSM they never ask him abt the FBI investigation of his wife
@chuckwoolery Yes he did -He needs to show leadership and not try to bully 4 YES. He is a coward to blame anybody but himself-his 5 deferments are ex.
@mathieuvonrohr 	You know that's not true-McCain said ACA needs to be repealed and replaced. He voted NO bc there was no substance in bill
@BillKristol Spot on Bill	POTUS is unteachable	Ego and arrogance 	Self delusion will be his downfall	Lying will be his legacy
@foxandfriends @KellyannePolls thinks she is so clever...she is not	Even Fox is starting to distance itself from Trump
@DrMartyFox The difference between John McCain and Donald Trump is McCain puts America before himself-Trump and his ego would never do that.
@SenSanders This from someone who didn't have a real job until they were 40
@SteveRattner @WSJ 	Doesn't quite sound like winning-I hope Scott walker and Paul Ryan get called out on this
@ericgarland 	Russia is putting a permanent base in Syria and could supply nuclear material to Iran. Feels like we are heading to war
@matthewjdowd 	The world would be better off with women running things.
@JohnBerman @Scaramucci Yet CNN has yet to ask Bernie about the FBI investigation of his wife when he is on........why is that?
@gatewaypundit @DLoesch 	Unbelievable!	https://t.co/zHJlulKu7a
@GovWalker @CNBC Challenge: count how many times Scott Walker says Wisconsin 	I counted 30 times in a 5 minute interview
@heatherscope @instapundit @DWStweets Hope FBI cuts him a deal to get to the truth-all agree @DWStweets is corrupt-should be removed from office before she does more damage
@JayRBryant @EboniKWilliams Now I'm hungry!
@shaneferro Why are we so consumed with labels?Labels are for soup cans.	Plenty of common ground btw Dems and Repubs if they could quit acting like kids
@matthewjdowd 	Limbaugh was wrong when he illegally bought prescription drugs from his house keeper....
@ChrisCuomo 	Why doesn't anybody ever ask Bernie about the FBI investigation of his wife when he is on?
Hey @ChrisCuomo @brianstelter Is CNN going to report on this story this morning?	 https://t.co/pzrDJQu30Z
@RevJJackson And Chicago residents are one step closer to dying from all the gang shootings bc YOU wont do anything-DO SOMETHING REV
@nedprice as president he is allowed to disclose any information he wants
@MikeLevinCA @RepAdamSchiff @POTUS 	Cmon! @AdamSchiffCA is a partisan hack and everyone knows it-Russia nothing burger is all he talks about
@ChrisCuomo 	Maybe not illegal	Still inappropriate 	Optics important no matter what party	Please stop pretending to be unbiased reporter
@ValerieJarrett @AprilDRyan That's another lie from you-do u even know when u lie?	U should be ashamed of yourself for putting Obama/Dems before ur country and truth.
@stephenfhayes Unpresidential also comes to mind
@stephenfhayes Obviously Trump wont/cant fire another AG so will try to humiliate him into resigning. "Cut off your nose to spite your face" comes to mind
@ericgarland Either Sessions lied during conf hearing or he "misheard"the question from Franken-which makes him incompetent-both unacceptable
@CillizzaCNN Difference is Bush never committed a crime &amp; HRC committed several-so did Holder by the way but you aren't interested in unbiased reporting
@CillizzaCNN Crazy coming from you-Do you even watch CNN??
@DrMartyFox @instapundit Who cares what Holder says or thinks-I hope he runs in 2020-It will focus attention on his contempt charge and Fast&amp;Furious
@BoDietl Neither Blaz or Maxine could beat "Rents too Damn High" guy
@DWStweets You are despicable-You probably don't even think how much you disgrace Florida and this country by your actions-shame on you
@Voices4Humanity @Billybobtn His base won't allow him to work w POTUS -they protested outside his office last time he appr DT nominee-sick
@ericgarland @washingtonpost Trump is still conducting himself like a billionaire bully businessman-vail threats to his own ppl-can't pivot
@RLR58 @foxandfriends Plenty of Repubs will be going home if Trump doesnt deliver healthcare bill-remember the 2010 midterm-Huge losses for DEms
@DrMartyFox @LouDobbs 	I don't understand why they don't pass clean repeal as they voted for 36 ish times in 2015. Sunset ACA-bipartisan fix
@cvpayne Clean repeal with bilateral replacement down the road-sunset obama care
@FoxNews @brunelldonald @POTUS POTUS can ramp up the drama all he wants but showmanship isnt going to get this bill passed-he has 4 solid NOs and thats lights out
@benjaminwittes Surprised Brian liked	What about these polls	Not sure we can trust due to oversampling of Dems
@markknoller Bernie said that? Wow
@brikeilarcnn @KateBolduan Did you ask her who she voted for in 2012?
@lee_junior1 @jax_superdave @Harlan Irresponsibly Stupid I call them.
@aravosis @ChairmanBuckley Such a stupid theory-only fools and conspiracy theorist will believe this crap-look at how many Dems took meetings w Russians
@jax_superdave @Harlan Susan Rice is corrupt but she is scheduled to testify in a closed session
@Harlan Rice is scheduled to testify so what are you referring to?
@AlanDersh opinion piece re Trump innocence until proven guilty  was not accepted/run  by NYT proving just how bias the paper is-cancel now
@CillizzaCNN Yet that is how MSM is serving it up 	Check your words and the words of your CNN colleagues
@CaCooYankee1 @patch1000 @ChrisCuomo 	Ask Arizona folks on ACA. You are full of poo-
@JudicialWatch Trump wont fire Koskenin bc he will leak his tax returns-I feel certain that must be it or he would have fired him day1
@JudicialWatch Commissioner Koskinen should be fired TODAY along with an investigation into the stone walling of congressional oversight	TODAY
@ColMorrisDavis @MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump 	Actually he is a bit TOO engaged	Tweeter battles
@RosieGray @EvelynNFarkas @TheAtlantic Which Diplomats????	Dem base might care but nobody else cares abt the Russia narrative
@FakeLiberal_USA @CillizzaCNN Much of trump disgusts me but I would vote for him again	Wish he would pivot already
@CillizzaCNN Don't need Democrats to check Trump-The repubs are doing that. POTUS has majority across the board and cant pass healthcare,tax reform, wall
@ccpatter74 @Morning_Joe 39 i think	Waste of time and taxpayer money	They will vote next week and put everyone on record
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS 	ACA works? 	If you like your dr you can keep ur dr-PERIOD! Lie	Lower premiums? Lie	Can u tell the truth?
@markknoller Tick Tock
@TPM Nobody cares abt Joe leaving the REP party-get out already 	Joe is a partisan punk who has zero musical talent-quit embarrassing yourself
@DailyCaller I trust Gen Mathis-he knows what to do
@seanhannity @JoeNBC @POTUS You are soooo right Sean-Morning Boring is Un watchable	Seriously-they only bash POTUS and nothing else
@ericgarland What??? Cmon-what do you really think will happen to him? He is rich and well connected so PLEASE tell me what U Think Will happen???
@seanhannity @greta Sounds right but dont forget Joe no Mika pretending to be journalist-Bernie was on the show and they nvr asked abt FBI investigation
@mawj46 @donnabrazile @USATODAY Lying Donna and Hillary are sitting at home...they lost...irrelevant players in today's politic	We are better off without them....be honest
@donnabrazile @USATODAY And what r you doing these days Donna?	Not running DNC	Not working for CNN	You might as well hangout with your ole buddy Hillary-#irrelevant
@ericgarland Independents are the future-back a person based on individual views/beliefs/policy and not party-too much money in party's -no dignity
@AnnCoulter @Delta Im canceling my DELTA frequent flyer account and credit card	I encourage others to do the same
@nickconfessore @RadioFreeTom So condescending-Once again the MSM insults Americans by saying they r stupid and dont know abt policy etc-NYT is in trouble financially-why
@CillizzaCNN MSM are the only folks whining about off-camera pressers. By doing this,WH denies MSM of video clips of Qs abt Russia which r the ONLY Qs
@brianstelter @RepAdamSchiff 	Bernie Sanders wife unde FBI investigation-u have him on ur show yet u do not ask him abt it-bias reporting
@brianstelter 	Ukraine/DNC collusion actually happened-have you reported? @RepAdamSchiff admits it
@Amy_Siskind 	Don't see how they are in trouble when they did nothing illegal but the optics look very bad
@mitchellvii @Billybobtn 	D+12 poll???
@BillKristol Optics
@AprilDRyan Sanders wont last-maybe they can have Clint Eastwood to conduct pressers with a empty chair and no media
@AprilDRyan He was promoted obviously-incompetence rewarded	Sanders needs to be replaced too	Need someone like Tony Snow
@matthewjdowd Midterms are too far off for this poll to matter	A lot can happen before Nov 2018
@matthewjdowd Don't think these polls mean much. Its a snapshot of how Americans feel abt POTUS and we know ppl dont always tell the truth abt DT#election
@RalstonReports @jmartNYT We just need a clean repeal-sunset ACA while working on bilateral healthcare bill-not sure why thats not on the table
@Billybobtn @hispanic4DTrump @USTreasury trying to figure out why he is still there. Im sure u want him gone too along with most Americans-maybe DT knows his taxes would be leaked
@Billybobtn @hispanic4DTrump @USTreasury Hey Bill-wondering why John Koskenin still Commissioner of IRS? Should have been fired day 1-right?
@nickconfessore @dcherring If stupidity were a crime-I wonder how many Trumps would be in jail
@ColumbiaBugle that is hilarious -well done
@CillizzaCNN Silly like you	Not a serious journalist	You are a CNN waste of money...again
@CillizzaCNN You are a punk Cillizza	You are as indignant as potus
@MSNBC 	Drip Drip Drip	Stupidity is no excuse
@DWStweets Are you lying again Debbie? Nobody can believe anything you say after screwing Bernie over. Hope the ppl in your district fire you.
@hardball Bc it shows how ignorant @DonaldJTrumpJrr is when it comes to politics-shows how willing the TRUMPS are to cheat to "win"	Amateur Hour at WH
@mikebarnicle Why didn't you ask Bernie abt FBI investigation of his wife yesterday? Either u r a journalist or just someone pretending-
@gato_danger @SenatorCantwell @SenateGOP Bc Big Govt doesn't do anything well. Single payer = more waste and fraud. Combo using private payer + Medicaid would be better
@Billybobtn @mitchellvii Right Bill-clean repeal-sunset ACA and work on bilateral bill so all in congress have to own it
@TerryMcAuliffe You always seem like a used car salesman to me and I feel like I need a shower	You are my Govt and I'm deeply disappointed
@Daily_Express Serious Black????
@dcexaminer Our potus doesn't have a filter
@MSNBC Glad Corey took the time to take his head out of DTs ass to do an interview-He has no credibility	He manhandled a reporter during campaign
@RevJJackson Cmon Rev-people are dying in YOUR own city and you don't seem to care. Reporting the shootings on ur part is ridiculousDO SOMETHING
@Acosta @Fahrenthold Thanks for reporting the exact same thing 50 other reporters reported. Serenity now!
@AlecMacGillis @EvelynNFarkas So you are saying Obama listened to Mitch McConnell? 	Put down the crack pipe
@DavidAFrench Begala is and always will be a Clinton butt boy! Everybody knows it-he has zero credibility
@EricBoehlert Coulda Woulda Shoulda	Wishful thinking on your part	Need to expose any and all politicians 	Don't be so bias-hold all accountable
@matthewjdowd Very true-no dignity in politics OR Trump business practices	Anything to win	Not worth losing your soul over
@kylegriffin1 Always so painful to watch DT with an open mic
@cspan @NancyPelosi Nancy may have some mental issues-she has called Donald Trump Pres Bush 5 times.....time for a checkup Nancy but don't worry YOU are covered
@mitchellreports That's a good thing
@WayneDupreeShow 	Stay on him Wayne!	Gutierrez cares more about non-citizens than American citizens. 	Our tax dollars pay his salary
@JoeNBC @BBCNews You never even asked Bernie about the FBI investigation of his wife. 	I'm done with you Morning Ho
@JoeNBC @BernieSanders 	Did you ask Bernie about the FBI investigation of his wife?
@mikeallen @axios You are lucky DT isnt going anywhere or you might actually have to report on Dems and real news. Have you looked into John Podesta russia $?
@davis1988will @ThePatriot143 Congress will have to ask her about this when she testifies-I have a feeling that she wont recall.
@ericgarland @ChairmanBuckley You got that right! Obama did nothing bc he thought HRC would win. Now thats treason!
@JoeNBC @morningmika @mikebarnicle 	Any of you "journalist" going to ask Bernie about the FBI investigation of his wife?
@Morning_Joe @SenSanders I bet Joe doesnt ask Bernie about his wife being investigated by FBI over multi million $ land deal
Dems have real Russia ties/money	John Podesta was given 75k shares from a co backed by Kremlin	https://t.co/7ugXYohYup
@owillis Treason-man you have lost your mind-
@greta It's called being an Independent who put country 1st-willing to find common ground to get things done
@Amy_Siskind @bi_politics If you don't know the facts of the case then perhaps you shouldn't comment-makes you look stupid
@DailyCaller is not a very likable person and her obvious disdain for POTUS is palpable and contributes to CNN reputation of bias-@ChrisCuomo knows this
@dhookstead @DailyCaller This is the same guy that use to, or still does, an American flag as a shirt-he knows no respect of country
@FoxNews @SHSanders45 DonJr did nothing illegal but made a bad, irresponsible decision which really hurt his dads admin-shows incompetence/duplicity
@FoxNews @SHSanders45 This DonJr/Russia meeting proves a couple things and that is he is stupid and has no real sense of morality-simple Right vs Wrong	#wining?
@FoxNews @SHSanders45 Amateur hour in the WH-I voted for DT but still waiting for him to pivot into being presidential AS PROMISED-
@FaceTheNation If being stupid were a crime then DonJr would be in jail.	Lots of smoke but no fire but more importantly this admin is so incompetent
@johnfkirby63 @brianstelter WH is going camera-less to deny MSM vid clips to rerun over and over of inane Russia questions &amp; they know it irritates MSM.
@samstein @HuffPostPol She should be careful-Russia/Wikileaks's prob not done w her-expose even more Clinton fraud and pay to play
@ChrisCuomo 	Soviets got what they wanted which is to disrupt/divide our country-this happened on Trumps watch. 	Needs to clean up his mess
@ChrisCuomo Trumps would do deal with the devil to "win" but nothing happened here to rise to the level of collusion let alone break the law
@brianstelter @smerconish Anything to fit your Trump Hating Agenda!!!	No Bombahell just speculation-no proof
@EricBoehlert @PrincessBravato 	We? Do you have a mouse in ur pocket?	You didn't read 30k plus emails and you know it-liar
@billoreilly It just proves how out of sorts and out of touch the MSM is and how desperate they r to get rid of DT.
@JoshSchwerin @PaulBegala 	HRC asked why we (USA) didn't "drone" Assange back when she was Sec State. I bet she wishes we did-
@AprilDRyan @POTUS like father like son. It's like having a little puppy you have to clean up after constantly. Unteachable
@brianstelter @jaketapper @CNN 	why do you report what another reporter says? The media should never be the news they should just report it
@davidaxelrod @Reince 	where's the beef?	No proof of collusion or do facts even matter to you.
@EricBoehlert @Shareblue did you watch the same interview I did? Gorka waxed her. Crawl out of that bubble so you can see truth
@SenSanders 	what does your wife's attorney have to say about it?
@brianstelter CNN should lose its broadcasting license for misinforming the public not informing. FCC should yank u off the air today
@brianstelter MSM has no evidence of collusion yet cont to SPECULATE -that's why no camera pressers-which disallows video clips too
@brianefallon you would've taken that meeting in a heartbeat if it would've helped Hillary. You have no soul let alone honor and integrity
@brianefallon 	I think it's hilarious that you,of all ppl, take issue w DTjr et al taking meeting to see if dirt on HRC could help campaign
@ChrisCuomo 	No collusion proof and to not take a meeting to see what damaging info there was re HRC would have been irresponsible
@ChrisCuomo Woulsnt any campaign take a meeting to see what neg info there is.
@mitchellreports @Yamiche 	Report the facts Can't believe you think it's ok to report what reporters think-nobody cares
@mitchellreports @Yamiche Once again Andrea you make the reporters/news outlets THE news. Who cares what reporters think? Report the news
@RadioFreeTom 	snap!
@Crystal1Johnson @PearlThusi That does not even qualify as Free Speech-10 time worse than yelling FIRE in a crowded theatreand more incendiary. True Ignorance
@brianstelter 	Both were on the ropes at some point of the "rumble" 	Like not having to break for commercials-got to give CNN credit 4 that
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay 	Can you report on the discrimination lawsuit against CNN? or are you allowed to? Prob need permission what u can report
@brianefallon @markos @YouTube When will you admit that HRC was a deeply flawed candidate? DEEPLY FLAWED! DT beat her bc she was unelectable

@brianstelter @Reince45 You weren't in the meeting either Brian-not sure how you can even suggest what was talked about.....dishonesty = Ratings????? 	Pathetic

@samstein @alivitali Why are you not reporting on John Podesta part ownership in a Russian co during 2016 election? U report on stories that fit DT hating agenda
@donnabrazile @ChairmanBuckley Which cost @donnabrazile her CNN gig AND DNC chairperson job.	CNN made the right decision	Brazil's reputation gone
@donnabrazile @ChairmanBuckley This is a fake story but @donnabrazile did leak questions to HRC team before a town hall meeting during 2016 election which cost her
@StockMonsterUSA @Billybobtn Wonder if Secret Service will visit Sarsour for her comments re Jihad on POTUS
@TeaPainUSA Does John Podesta own part of that Russian company? He admitted to Maria B owning shares in at least one during the election
@rolandsmartin @CUhlmann @realDonaldTrump Americans dont care what Australian media thinks

@brianefallon	Curious-what didyou think you would be doing with Hillary Clinton in the White House? Bc u r sitting at home Right now
@EricBoehlert Obama did 0 when he learned of Russia's interference in Aug 2016 bc he thought HRCwould win or do u have the courage to admit?
@LuxAeterna2020 @StopTrump2020 And I bet he wins again bc politicians don't care. Dems keep moving to the Left. America is in the middle.

@brianstelter U and most other MSM spend 90% of time reporting on Russia/obstruction when there is zero evidence. That's why no pressers-

@HuffPostPol @SpeakerRyan The country is hurting monetarily so why not take more from those who can afford it rather than give them more which is what DT has done
@HuffPostPol @SpeakerRyan Imagine being Ryan who is a deficit hawk wanting to balance the budget but cant without hurting the poor unless he targets the rich 4 more $

@ChrisCuomo Honestly-we know why POTUS fired Comey...He didnt get the answers he wanted after that dinner regarding Russia/Flynn investigation
@hale_razor @EWErickson The killer was A deeply conflicted self-loathing person
@seanhannity @CNN @NBCNews Bc Alex Jones is disgusting-how can you not see that? Not every dirt bag needs to be interviewed and given an opportunity to spread hate
@brianstelter @sallykohn Unwatchable interview
@cnnbrk I thought immigration was the most important case
@elainaplott Just ask Katie Couric-there is editing and then there is EDITING
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Can you provide 1 example of Trump getting a free pass ever by MSM? Just one and Fox doesnt count
@ChrisCuomo 	Not sure intensity is the right word-more like embarrassment to admit you were/had voted for DT.
@DavidLimbaugh There is a massive amount of intolerance in both parties-racism xenophobia misogyny should not be tolerated in America
@DLoesch What is the breakout? Gang vs domestic mass shootings?
@hiphopsrevival This makes no sense-was the mom a violent criminal? Convicted felon?	Would be ethically and morally better to have her stay with her son-sad
@brianstelter @NBCNews @megynkelly should be ashamed for giving Alex Jones a mouth piece-very hurtful to Sandy Hook families	I wont watch anything NBC now
@seanhannity @NBCNews I DECIDED not to watch it or Megyn Kelly from now on-disgusting
@amjoyshow @instapundit I repeat-You are a special kind of dispicable for attacking a man fighting for his life-you should be ashamed -hope your sponsors r aware
@JPShalvey1 @Billybobtn Problem is congress cant make Rice or Lynch testify	So its not going to happen
@JackBaileyUSA @ThePatriot143 If POTUS keeps tweeting about Russia/investigations we may be talking prison TERM	He needs to pivot already and let Mueller do his job
@JoyAnnReid 	You are a special kind of despicable for attacking Rep. Scalise while he is fighting for his life	Shame on you
@realDonaldTrump @davidwebbshow 	Backdoor healthcare bill is a way to guarantee the Dems win back Senate and House. 2010 mid terms reversal
@christogrozev @dialogician POTUS has no sense of decorum or appropriateness 	Its about him 24/7	Still waiting for him to pivot to being Presidential
@cvpayne You are a good man, Charles	Happy Fathers Day!
@mitchellvii 	Yes BUT you have to admit POTUS has made things worse due to his constant tweeting about it.
@JulianAssange @instapundit U broke your word-you promised to turn yourself in if Chelsea Manning was pardoned-you coward. U r lucky HRC didn't win-she wants to drone u
@chicagotribune @RevJJackson When are you going to hold the mayor accountable??? It's his job to keep citizens safe-he seems more concerned abt being a sanctuary city
@samsteinhp @CitizenCohn @HuffPostPol 	Most disturbing	We need to Depoliticize healthcare so naturally that means term limits
@ChrisCuomo 	POTUS policy on Cuba is the right one. Castros got to go-for the Cuban people's sake.
@TheSoundOfEco @CNNPolitics Makes sense	I found this https://t.co/OJJGr0582W
@DrMartyFox POTUS has done the wave with a sexual harasser though	https://t.co/Z4DFkqHtDl
@JanHale19 @CNNPolitics Yes but I would like to see what the breakout is-guess I will goggle
@CNNPolitics The question is what percent are gang related
@dcexaminer 	Why hasn't Trump fired IRS Commissioner? Should have done 1st day. Might b afraid of him releasing taxes
@Bakari_Sellers 	Trump is not anti Obama-he is just keep campaign promises-too bad he didn't promise not to tweet
@RealJamesWoods @IngrahamAngle 	Don't for get obamas selfie too while in Cuba
@DrMartyFox @newtgingrich 	This kind of BS is why ppl voted for Trump
@DrMartyFox @newtgingrich Talking about obstruction-Loretta Lynch caught obstructing by ordering Comey to call email investigation a matter
@samsteinhp 	Also good thing he was a bad shot. 	Leaders need to put the word out abt getting help from counselors if you r consid violence
@samsteinhp
@brianstelter @latimes 	1st HuffPost now LA Times	NYT next. Can't compete w cable news I bet. Plus bias reporting-inaccurate reporting
@samsteinhp 	It's almost like DJT wants to be impeached and resign-all the right moves to head back into his wonderful life
@brianstelter 	That's a good thing	Now if he could just stop tweeting
@KeithOlbermann 	You forgot to mention illegal immigration is down 60% even without a wall.
@HillaryClinton @joanwalsh 	Your time has passed	You are irrelevant 	And lucky you are not in jail. 	You lost bc of YOU	Wake up and fade out
@danpfeiffer 	Talking about dumb?? You worked for John Podesta who's email password was P A S S W O R D 	Now that's dumb and irresponsible
@realDonaldTrump @ThePatriot143 	Suck it up buttercup!	You created this but will never take responsibility.
@samsteinhp 	That will make things worse. POTUS may be getting excellent advice but ignoring it. No self discipline-needs to pivot already
@janjez9 @ChrisCuomo 	he had every right. What do you have against Transparency? And do you believe trump or Comey?
@janjez9 @ChrisCuomo 	I trust the word of Comey/Mueller over DT and I voted for DT. He lies all the time-disgusting and shameful
@janjez9 @ChrisCuomo 	How could you know mueller is the source of leaks. Comey had every right to leak his memos and did so bc DT lies
@dcexaminer Cant believe anything @MarkSanford says	https://t.co/Jux2kKAVBi
@ChrisCuomo Time for everyone to get out of the way and allow Mueller et al to do their job and get this Russia "matter" behind us.POTUS lead the way
@RevJJackson Your turn to do the same with Chicago-fire the incompetent mayor and get rid of the gangs https://t.co/BVi2VZ5uDG
@KattyKayBBC That's bc WaPo thinks Trumps obstruction story more important 	NBC,ABC,CNN all followed WaPo on Mueller investigating POTUS on obstruction
@SenFeinstein Majority of Repubs dont want it done in secret either-shady leadership-we deserve better	Anything that hurts the poor is UNACCEPTABLE
@brianstelter @washingtonpost 	and you wonder why people think all of those networks listed are in cahoots ? 	What's WaPo source?
@FoxNews @Billybobtn @JaySekulow 	Comey was just being honest. Most Americans find him more credible than the president. I know I do
@seanhannity @NBCNews 	you need to cite specific examples of NBC's fake news narrative. You can start with the Alex Jones interview
@mlcalderone @HuffPostMedia 	yet he won't comment on the discrimination lawsuit against CNN of 175 African-Americans employees
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews 	why would you believe anything from this adulteress clown. Still can't believe South Carolina elected him
@ananavarro 	why not ask Claire McCaskill and Nancy Pelosi? They too had meetings with the Russian ambassador ordoesnt that fit ur agenda?
@RevJJackson 	And if it doesn't fit u must acquit?	They need your help in Chicago Rev	That's ur town-murder rate?	clean up your own house
@GOPChairwoman @POTUS 	put down the crack pipe Ronna-Mueller has made no such accusations
@ananavarro 	Where do these people get their news?	Can someone please show me where Mueller made accusations re POTUS?
@samsteinhp just about everything POTUS does is at lease a little weird. 	HuffPost pull him out of Entertainment section yet?
@GovWalker 	what about worker  participation?
@amjoyshow @RevJJackson @nytimes 	how can anybody support a law that we don't know anything about.Should be debated on the floor of Congress
@BraddJaffy @PaulBegala 	Also-POTUS had five deferments so that he did not have to go to Vietnam. 	I trust Mueller to do the right thing
@chucktodd 	@newtgingrich has been bought off by POTUS w. Ambassadorship for his wife  and maybe a gift certificate from Tiffany's!
@mattyglesias Firing Mueller wont end the investigation so why would POTUS do that?	Firing Comie just made things worse
@DLoesch @Trent_Humphries What do you think would happen if it were Dems being shot at by nutter Repub?
@AriMelber @adamentous @maddow I voted for him to get things done-put teams of experts together to fix problems and not play politics-needs to put USA 1st-not himself
@AriMelber @adamentous @maddow And Trump caused all this to happen with his undisciplined "fly by the seat of your pants" style of leadership.
@MSNBC Yes you do have a roll like report both sides of an issue equally. News fatigue will lead to fewer viewers
@danpfeiffer You better clean up your own house before criticizing Repubs
@DaShanneStokes @realTonaldChump Obama never did anything about mental illness/guns	BTW-Obama sold more guns(indirectly) than anyone in history-he'd Mention guns=guns sales
@RevJJackson @CocaColaCo Do something Rev	Chicago is your town https://t.co/uQvOQsQIYa
@Lrihendry @Billybobtn No facts yet
@PatDollard @PRyan Not this Repub majority congress-bought and paid for by NRA	I love guns but want universal background checks &amp; mental health check too
@mitchellreports No facts available so he shouldn't speculate but I see that wont stop you, Andrea-can you just report the facts for a change?
@chuckwoolery Not sure how you got there	I think this shooting will put pressure on NRA &amp; guns will be blamed-blame the finger not the trigger
@ChrisCuomo The king of the Dodge Tactic was AG Holder. How can you not mention him while talking about AGs not discussing convos w president
@JoeNBC Well said Joe-1st positive thing u have said re potus in months
@ananavarro bet Trump gets the blame some how	Also bet the shooter is mentally disturbed but no law yet on preventing mentally ill ppl from getting gun
@donnabrazile @esquire I think you interfered more than Russia when you leaked questions of debate to HRC
@CillizzaCNN Careful Chris ur bias is showing	We must have not seen the same hearing-Sessions won	AG Holder wld never talk abt conversations with Obama
@JoeNBC And Trump would win again if the election were today and we had the same choices
@jpodhoretz 	Vanilla is a very popular flavor-what you see is what you get-	Anybody see Lieutenant Dan in the crowd?
@HuffPostPol 	Why should any woman ask for deference when they are equal-she would not let Sessions answerso she was asked to let him answer
@DWStweets @AIGTweets 	You are a disgrace who doesn't have any sense of decadency or you would get out of politics. You r a liar-shame
@mike_Zollo @Billybobtn 	Seriously though, what is wrong with the ppl who voted Maxine waters in office. Didn't she help her husbands bank?
Sessions tends to ramble when Dems ask questions to waste their time. Quick response when Repub asks questions- They all do it
@JoeNBC 	Newts wife is going to be ambassador to the Vatican -that's what's going on! Quid pro quo....pay back for his support
@Newsweek @NBCNews allowing @megynkelly to interview and air shows just how desperate they are for ratings-I hope advertisers will pullout
@Newsweek Be more specific....Obama created ISIS by leaving Iraq abruptly without leaving a fighting force close by
@Suntimes @RevJJackson Do Something REV JACKSON https://t.co/UWOhpKgcv4
@Suntimes @RevJJackson  https://t.co/ZU3ZUdXBRL
@Suntimes @RevJJackson Do something Rev-help fire the mayor-justice delayed in this instance is unacceptable and IS PART OF YOUR LEGACY!!
@ananavarro @nbc @megynkelly That guyshould lose all his sponsors if he says SandyHook didnt happen. Does he think the Holocaust happen?Shame on him and all who believe
@davidaxelrod @SenWarren Yours is another example of Hyper-Vigilance from the left. Nit-Pic everything to try to cause chaos bc they have no plan. Pathetic antic
@EricBoehlert Republicans will pay a price in 2018 if they do a back door healthcare bill. Needs to be passed after debate-regular process-transparency
@brianstelter 	Hey Brian-what's going on w that discrimination law suit by 175 African American  against CNN? 	That's news you won't share
@tedlieu @dialogician Ted-why don't you endeavor to serve ALL your constituents instead of being a partisan punk
@JudicialWatch Transparency is a good thing-we need more across the board.POTUS NEEDS TO PIVOT as promised and stop taking bait of left
@chuckwoolery @BreitbartNews 	Was that before or after Gore invented the internet?
@TPM 	Sources	Sources	Sources	Hold your ppl accountable
@blessinow @desiderioDC @brianstelter @sallykohn Chris Wallace is the only journalist I like and trust.Registered Dem and asks tuf Qs of all
@blessinow @desiderioDC @brianstelter @sallykohn 	Where's the dignity and honor in politics and journalism? Spinning the truth is lying
@blessinow @desiderioDC @brianstelter @sallykohn 	Bc journalist/networks should not be bias. Look at Fox News-Fair&amp;Balanced my A$$
@samsteinhp	Is that an official RNC entity or a think tank attached to Repub super PAC?
@blessinow @desiderioDC @brianstelter @sallykohn 	I watch all networks and never hear what I want which is balance and factual reporting
@samsteinhp True but POTUS will come across like the Clintons-getting off but behaviors always in the gray area of lawfulness and truth
@desiderioDC @brianstelter @sallykohn That's bc you DONT report the other side of an issue or have guests with other views that often-your support of Dems is also obvious-#mirror
@EricBoehlert Not sure how many ways Coats has to answer the question-was he pressured? He said NO in his testimony yesterday that I viewed-move on man
@AprilDRyan I think Comeys testimony will leave you "shaking your head"
@Morning_Joe Yet another boring and predictable show-constant Trump bashing-unwatchable	How about reporting facts with no spin for a change
@ananavarro Ana-you have devolved into a Trump Troll....bashing Trump is all you can contribute? Shame
@brianstelter @ReliableSources Where is CNN correction?????	https://t.co/eIIdsNsnTS
@samsteinhp Hope Jacobs sues Gianforte AND judge throws the book at him. Need to make an example-violence towards press unacceptable
@ChrisCuomo Does not rise to level of obstruction but does show that POTUS lied once again-said he didnt ask Comey to "lay off" Flynn	Lying is DT legacy
@CillizzaCNN Any laws broken? Attempted obstruction?? Stupidity??
@WayneDupreeShow There was nothing illegal or Comey would have reported it-Comeys wife refers to him as a boy scout
@BryanDawsonUSA Taken out of context????
@NicolleDWallace These ppl do not parse words so no trickery 	They say what they mean and I trust them not congress
@brianstelter Funny bc the Trumps are Democrates-DT couldn't get Dem Nomination but could Repub.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS You should know
@ananavarro POTUS coat tails are not attracting the folks he needs and he creates most of the problems himself-sad he cant see it-Unteachable
@JoeNBC CNN wins when you allow them to quote you disagreeing  w another Repub. 	Why would Hanity be jealous of any part of your life-self-check
@CNN Great story-nice break from the political scene and the Washington "shit show"
@kaitlancollins @JoeNBC Cant trust either one to do the right thing. Even Cotton is partisan which is dispapointing
@brianstelter Brian-please report Obamas claim last summer that HRC emails etc and Russia involvement was not happening. Obama said hacking was not issue
@JoeNBC Joe-dont act like you and ppl on your show are hardcore journalist.Truth is you hate Pruitts boss (DT)and wanted to TRY to make him look bad
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay 	The truth is DT has created this hatred towards him and will not take responsibility. He is truly Unteachable
Joy from The View thinks it is ok for Maher to say the N word.
https://t.co/HTDvmkuOgu
@JoeNBC he did answer Joe. He said POTUS said he believed in climate change. Did Mika ask you to ask that?
@TIME Kellyannes husband is right-POTUS hurts his admin and agenda everyday-That's not what I voted for	Time to stop talking &amp; b Presidental
@ChrisCuomo Its a travel ban that POTUS has the constitutional right to execute
@ChrisCuomo Wrong-If its a Muslim ban then why doesnt he ban the other 85% of Muslims in the world?	SCOTUS will sort the lower  courts out-
@thehill Assange said he would turn himself in if Manning was pardoned. What happened
@CAinc @Eurosport_UK I think the motor is in the rear hub
@CNNPolitics Obama provided 300k to defeat Netanyahu last time he ran but why is MSM not reporting that?
@HallieJackson @MSNBC Makes me sick to see MSM congratulate each other on reporting only 1 side of the news
@ChrisCuomo Different read than yours-I think Gorka explained his veivery well and Cuomo did not keep up
@Brittanyhaynez @foxandfriends @michellemalkin so predictable and intolerant of other ppl who think and live differently. We know what we need to do as a country-stick together
@bearhawk33 @TMZ I just don't like that Mayer thinks that just be he is a liberal that he gets to use that disgusting and always inappropriate N word
@KeithOlbermann You got fired....rights.
@JoeNBC Let me know when you get serious again Joe
@foxandfriends @michellemalkin I am so uninterested in what Michelle Malkin has to say. The conservative intolerance is INTOLERABLE. Boring and predictable
@Rosie I have watched y ou enough and read your tweets and I have come to the conclusion that you are stupid-might not be your fault but you r DUMB
@mike4193496 @Billybobtn He should be silenced for his violent rant-if there is terror perpetrated by him or ppl inspired by him and England did nothing then SHAME
@tekaldas I saw a piece on TV w actual Israel pilots talking about attack. 	Why in Yemen?
@MSNBC It's not a Muslim ban and to call it so is helping ISIS recruiting-85% of the 1.7Billion Muslims can travel to US-#dangerousdialogue
@agfhome @brianstelter I did-Russia told you what Qs to ask but it ties into the larger picture of CNN attacking Trump on Russia collusion so bash anything Russia
@ChrisCuomo Thx for providing that interview but I have to say that I cant believe that U tried to tie Gorky/Trump admin into admitting it was MusBan
@agfhome @brianstelter I think you are being used by CNN as a part of the Russian collusion narrative -don't you?
@bearhawk33 @TMZ Im an Independent and do not identify with either party-	Guess you dont mind when the N word is used
@brianstelter @agfhome Now who is in bed with the Russians...CNN	You would have the devil on your show if he would bash Trump
@MSPOA @JudicialWatch You would think Obama et al would have negotiated him out with the 170billion
@TMZ Time to cancel my HBO
@JudicialWatch Think about it-Iran sponsors terror around the world &amp; they have shouted death to America yet Obama gave them over 170 million-irresponsible
@JoyAnnReid Big Govt does not work-we need balance between private sector and Govt	Look at ACA website-never bid out and cost over 120mil 10 times more
@JoyAnnReid Name 1 thing the Govt runs well....just 1
@cathymcmorris @townhallcom So its not 23 Million losing their healthcare coverage...its only 10Million ppl getting screwed. Is that suppose to make us feel better???
@ChrisCuomo Can you post the interview? I missed it
@CillizzaCNN I'd use the money from cancelling my HBO and any other sponsor Bill Maher has
@ananavarro Good 4 u Anna-first thing I've ever agreed w u on-send that troll back to his flat earth
@ChrisCuomo how is it a Muslim ban win 85% of Muslims can travel to US?
@ChrisCuomo where's your facts Cuomo ?
@RevJJackson @KingJames @Kaepernick7 @ministter You need to focus on Chicago, Rev	How many ppl have to get murdered before you call for the Mayors resignation? https://t.co/FdFHVC9iLI
@RVAwonk @rolandsmartin Tough to find good/qualified ppl willing  to hitch their wagon to POTUS.
@BraddJaffy I wonder if DT uses a "foot wedge" when he plays to improve his "lie" or says he got a 4 when he really got a 7 and nobody corrects him.
@billoreilly @CNN Bias?? More like outright hatred but the shame of it is bias reporting is allowed and comes down from the top.
@davidaxelrod @donnabrazile @billmaher 	Maher thinks bc he is a liberal that it's ok o use N word. It's not ok
@HuffPostPol 	POTUS is so UNpresidential- would never put the country before himself. Self aggrandizing Trump First agenda.
@PaulBegala Donna Brazile? She supplied debate questions to HRC and you still support her? You are dishonest too
@brianstelter @foxandfriends That's disgusting-who was the guest?
@Impeach_D_Trump @krystalball 	1.7 billion Muslims in the world-	99.9999% are peaceful god loving ppl. 	ISIS distorts Islam 4 own purposes
@dcexaminer Time to go after HBO-if they dont fire him then im cancelling 	N word should never be used
@aquiroga72 @dailykos 	Oh I was mad as hell when Obama care past and happy as hell when 2010 republican landslide BUT GOP same in 2018
@jaketapper @mchancecnn 	WELL it was widely reported that John Podestas email password was 	P A S S W O R D 	Can't disagree
RT @gehrig38: WHY on earth have you NOT told this story publicly? https://t.co/MfaaBWn8eb
@dailykos 	The poor are getting ready to be screwed over-again -but the GOP will pay a price in 2018. Not sure they understand this failure
@washingtonpost 	Anyone know if Has he apologized?
@bigricanman 	N word and C word should never be used
@larryelder You have way more hair!
@mmfa This is China now-they dont have to reduce greenhouse gas until 2030. We would have to pay billions to stay in it-no thanks https://t.co/3vr0mdEBBV
@digitalspy @Fox5Teresa When is the movie coming out???
@brianstelter 	MSM reports everything DT says and doesn't say. Where are the real journalist? Real journalist Report all sides of an issue
@ananavarro Bill Maher couldn't stand to be upstaged by Kathy Griffins ignorance so he had to prove his own ignorance.
@CNN @smerconish Wrong-DT need not throw his base a bone-they will stick with him no matter what bc the alternative is unacceptable to them
@Crystal1Johnson You got that right. Also, many police afraid of black men so they over react. Shame-not sure if the training for right confrontations
@DLoesch @instapundit 	Obama has done nothing to curb gun violence-fitting that he is from Chicago enough said!
@CHSommers @instapundit @CollegeFix 	I wonder how many students/faculty would be there on Anti-Dumbass Day?
@RepAdamSchiff @dialogician 	You are a partisan POS who has no interest in being honest and public knows it
@WayneDupreeShow I bet they try to sue Donald Trump now. Crazy
@greta she needs to stop talking and take a break from public life for a few months
@gatewaypundit @Cernovich She is another example of how disgusting the Professional Political Class thinks they are above the law-we need term limits badly
@MSNBC Isn't it true that China doesnt have to reduce greenhouse gases until 2030?	This is what China looks like these days https://t.co/2yNBlDpxJt
@JoeNBC @morningmika Stop already Joe-you would never be tweeting about Brzenzinski if you weren't engaged to Mika-disingenuous and phony
RT @Spinozasrose: @JoeNBC @morningmika We, your previous fans, noticing this easily recognizable pattern of your role model in your recent…

@JasonMillerinDC @Mediaite China https://t.co/rOc9QEYxD9
@JackPosobiec Clarke is too over the top-POTUS needs ppl who go about their jobs quietly. Clarke is better suited to serve outside admin
@dcexaminer I wonder if @johnpodesta will change his email password. His password was P A S S W O R D when he ran HRC campaign-no wonder he was hacked
@nytimes @ChairmanBuckley May Have?? May Have??? Your whole paper is May Have and Unnamed Sources and FICTION

@true_pundit @ChrisCuomo Hillary has a new cash cow-a super PAC designed to oppose all things Trump Clintons know no shame especially HRC-she has been shown the door
@AC360 @VanJones68 You have been whining since election night, Van. Unwatchable
@JoyAnnReid He did lead-he led us out of a really bad deal for this country but ppl like you care more about world problems than our own which r many
@chuckwoolery Both Griffin and her attorney are shameful opportunists-what wont they do for publicity
@vinniemgupta @davidaxelrod cleaner fuel is the answer not losing $$$ on supporting a co like Solyndra. Solar panels aren't quite there yet
@chuckwoolery Lib pundits think it's Obama economic policy finally paying off. Sad but at least they are not blaming Bush for everything
@KattyKayBBC 	can you not see that, KattyKay? MSM is sooo clueless!
@KattyKayBBC 	OMG History will judge Kerry as being a part of the Iran deal which gave them 170 billion and ability to get nukes. Shame
@JeffImmelt 	Do you fly on private jets? Bet you don't answer...disingenuous
@SarahBurris @DanaBashCNN	 Do millennials even vote? Low info part of our electorate. They get their news from MTV and bill marh-very bias
@vinniemgupta @davidaxelrod 	How Then? We are down 15% since we entered accord because we are using cleaner energy like natural gas.
@vinniemgupta @davidaxelrod 	Love to have science I can trust. Climate change is soooo political. 	Virginia has been cool and rainy
@ThomasARoberts @POTUS 	Footprint???Are you ok with Obama taking private jets? So disingenuous of you and MSM "journalist".
@CillizzaCNN @FareedZakaria 	Drama much??? 	We need to address climate change but we would be the loser in jobs and economic chaos
@davidaxelrod @POTUS 	That's dishonest of you to say, Ax. Most countries joined so they can get money for being a member. Guess who pays?
@CheriJacobus You REALLY are a Trump Troll....pathetic
@maggieNYT And @DWStweets allowed that to happen. DNC would not provide data on dem contributors
@ChrisCuomo Spicey not allowed to say anything that might make DT look bad, obviously-real story is that this admin cant even tell a simple truth-typo
@Ab_Synthia @nprpolitics Now that the election is over, ppl have had time to look at just how much of a bad candidate she was. DT should have never been able to win
@Phil_Mattingly Sanctions!!!!!!
@nprpolitics Vast Clinton Fatigue is real-she is only hurting the dem party and is clearly in denial. Her base might buy-in but most Am ain't buying it
@dcexaminer DNC did sink Bernies candidacy
@mitchellreports @HillaryClinton It was the fact that she would not release the speech-obviously hiding something there too....elections over
@RepKevinBrady @USCBO AND leave 24 million without insurance. You ok with that Congressman? Taking from ppl who don't have anything is cowardice
@DailyCaller They are not interested in talking about anything but bashing Trump
@KimDotcom @FBI @DNC 	and why was HRC allowed to have her attorney w no security clearance allow to hold on to the server and flash drives
@Cernovich @DineshDSouza They just fired her
@StefanMolyneux @DineshDSouza Griffin just got fired by CNN
@prageru @kathygriffin She just got fired by CNN
@VicenteFoxQue @Rosie @realDonaldTrump You leaving your country in the hands of drug lords and corrupt politicians is your legacy!
@JoeNBC Your show does suck these days-the constant trolling of POTUS makes you unwatchable. Use to be balanced with great guests
@NicolleDWallace @DonnyDeutsch Donny does not have an ax to grind either-straight analysis -smart guy and his comedy is hilarious
@CillizzaCNN reporting on it is dumb.
@EricBoehlert Im sure he did give money to Booker-Jared and Ivanka are democrates
@ananavarro I wonder how you will act if the investigation proves zero collusion?
@EricHolder @rolandsmartin I just hope AG Sessions will investigate your role in Fast &amp; Furious. You are directly responsible for those murdered by those guns
@ChrisCuomo That's your takeaway? Have you even asked @RepAdamSchiff /Dems why they no longer wants to talk to Carter Page?
@danpfeiffer You talking about the Clintons?
@IngrahamAngle @kathygriffin Let's see if CNN does the right thing
@TIME He is lying and will end up getting off the hook.
@brianefallon You hope but remember that you backed a deeply flawed candidate @HillaryClinton and DNC screwed Bernie-EXPLAIN COWARD
@JakeSherman Thought he didn't take breathalyzer
@IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump 	They did want DT to win so they could exploit him to get what they wanted. Can you not see that? Didn't wrk
@RealJack @Billybobtn Some have paid taxes by stealing SS#s -I think the # is 200,000 stolen SS#s. IRS Commissioner Koskenin has done nothing to stop
@WayneDupreeShow It shows his intolerance toward non-whites. Maybe he doesnt know that many Japanese served honorably in Europe during WWII.
@CillizzaCNN Not sure the DNC would allow her to be the candidate, again. They didnt allow Bernie even though he enjoyed broad support. Too soon
@MSNBC Clapper also said no proof of collusion but you won't report that fact. Do you have ANY real journalist working at MSNBC?
@BCAppelbaum 	Germany (and other countries) should pay the 2% GDP as promised to UN. Why should we the tax payers pay? Contemplate that!
@molly_knight In case you haven't noticed @realDonaldTrump is never embarrassed by anything he does no matter how embarrassing his actions are-unteachable
@kwilli1046 @Billybobtn Chuck did not like the truth that Newt laid on him.
@AnnCoulter Hard to do with Russia investigation building steam-need to sanction the hell out of them so no alliance is possible
@politico You are kidding, right? After what HRC did regarding her emails/private server-not even an admonishment
@jaketapper Wow-what a gift-god bless him and his sacrifice
@JoeNBC You should change the name of our show to The Hate Donald Trump Show.	UNWATCHABLE
@ghenson08 @MSNBC You dont get 1 Clinton without the other-they are a package deal-did you ever call her the co-President in the 90s? Both irrelevant
@jaketapper That story so old Jake-why not report on Obama admin getting smacked by FOIA judge or maybe CNN wont allow you to stray off bashing POTUS
@RevJJackson @msu Clean up your own house in Chicago Rev......what's the murder rate so far this year and what have you done about it? Sanctuary city????
@RevJJackson @FlintGate @BetsyDeVos What is the hell does Betsy DeVos have to do with Flint? 	You cant even cleanup your own mess in Chicago-murders?? What r u doing about it
@BillKristol POTUS cant help himself-its clear that he is mentally ill-the question is how far gone is he....bring on Pence
@TheRickWilson Its very telling when polling suggest that the American ppl trust the MSM more than @realDonaldTrump when it come to telling the truth
@SenSanders How's that new lake house Bernie. By the way, why dont YOU pay your fair share of taxes???Hypocrite https://t.co/XMNelkkA0p
@DRUDGE_REPORT Shame on you Mayor Emanuel -putting illegals before your own citizens https://t.co/W8zx2pqMFM
@ghenson08 @MSNBC Now since the Clinton Foundation has no "pay to play" value anymore, she is going to be bilking an anti-Trump super PAC for $$$-#deploarable
@ghenson08 @MSNBC I think it is RICH for her to even utter the word impeachment-shows how out of touch she is with reality.
@ghenson08 @MSNBC Also, George Stephanopoulos in his book said it was HRC who did not want Bill to admit the affair and move on. She wanted to keep denying
@ghenson08 @MSNBC Think about it...she was married to him when he was impeached-its a big deal and they never mentioned it. Real Journalism would have done
@MSNBC Why no mention of her own husbands impeachment in your story?	Story is so one sided #patheticjournalism
@ABC @MarthaRaddatz 	And I'm betting that Adam Schiff will get softball questions &amp; will b allowed to prattle partisan rhetoric #journalism?
@TrumpTrain45Pac Yet no MSM accept Fox is reporting the story. Who decides what gets reported at these other media outlets? Editors? Where's real journalism?
@ananavarro Besides being a part of amateur hour at the White House-What law(s) has he broken?
@RevJJackson Its your turn Rev to do something profound (again)	How many ppl have to die before you stand up to Mayor Emanuel	You have the power&amp;support https://t.co/lETN7om88Z
@chuckwoolery Not sure why they wouldn't be charged with treason
@georgmike19 @MarkSZaidEsq @CoryBooker her and O admin wld have looked bad if they told the truth which was it was a planned attack (Sept 11!) instead of false video narrative
@NatashaBertrand @davidfrum You are forgetting something-She denied everything and its not like the MSM is going to press her or Obama
@SteveKrak @redsteeze @BBCJLandale @samsteinhp @mitchellreports You are dead right Steve...they feign moral outrage as they pretend to be a paragon of virtue. A bunch of phonies -sickening really
@MarkSZaidEsq @CoryBooker Mark-did she lie to the families while standing next to their coffins? Can you answer that question?
@RevJJackson @facebook  https://t.co/sWc17ZBnbM
@brithume Funny!!@HillaryClinton -You should know all about impeachment Hillary-ur husband was impeached 4 lying to grand jury &amp; was disbarred
@samsteinhp Sam-So you were ok w HRC sending/rec classified documents? That's ok with you?
@CodeBlueNTexas @Billybobtn @vnuek @ACLU Never thought I would see the day where colleges are intolerant of free speech-where's the ACLU?
@chuckwoolery We need to enlist the help of Muslims to rid the world of ISIS. Stamp them out wherever they stick their heads up
@chuckwoolery Chuck-you are never too old to learn and evolve-1.7 billion Muslims in the world and 99.9999% are not mudering ppl of other faiths
@politico There was a reason 60 Minutes investigated Boehner and Pelosi. They become wealthy while in office...How?	https://t.co/wIxkGmtirb
@MSNBC Secure lines? No such thing these days w all the illegal surveillance and leaks. Seems all intel agencies against POTUS-nothing to see here

@papacarl1956 @JoeNBC @tedlieu @Tedlieu is a disgusting political hack-he isnt interested in representing ppl w different views than him-intolerant
@IngrahamAngle Question no Republican will answer is What happens to those ppl dropped? 23million! You may have killed ACA by hurting the poorest amount us
@davidaxelrod Bc they have insurance and a job.....for now	there is a reckoning coming to rival the 2010 midterms	Sick of out of touch fat old white guy's
@CillizzaCNN @samsteinhp @ChrisCuomo 	Why aren't you covering this story?	https://t.co/EimCDt0wma
@WayneDupreeShow Worse than that....Dems take advantage of the minority vote. Trump rec way more black and Latina votes than expected.
@CillizzaCNN Now you know damn well its way too early to start looking at the mid-terms. You were wrong last November so.....
@BraddJaffy @KatyTurNBC This POTUS is proving everyday that he is unteachable. 	@realDonaldTrump Just stop talking and be president.  Put your country b4 ur ego
@BraddJaffy @KatyTurNBC It gets better-POTUS is thinking of having Corey Lowandowski as his crisis mgt person-you know the guy that manhandled that female reporter?
@GregAbbott_TX @mayoremmanuel needs to adopt these techniques for Chicago. https://t.co/i8ppo2Mj4W
@WayneDupreeShow Chicago is his home town and this is part of his legacy https://t.co/Ct9CHEw4Gj
@WayneDupreeShow Any one truthful with themselves know that Black people have been undervalued and underserved since slavery-Obama did nothing to help
@ChrisCuomo Yes but doesnt this budget just move money from Fed coffers to States to manage their constituents and if anyone gets dropped blame States?
@GMA Stop running this video....it feeds right into what ISIS wants...to spread terror and encourage more terror-you are complicit
@chuckwoolery The Left fail to realize that You cant treat uncivilized people in a civilized way-our enemies view it as weakness. Vote Strength
@RealJamesWoods Remember-John Podesta was hacked bc his password was PASSWORD-He takes no responsibility and cont to play the victim
@RealJamesWoods @johnpodesta is hoping this Russia narrative will absolve his responsibility for losing to Trump-pathetic-the man has no honor or dignity
@RealJamesWoods That's so pathetically funny-the ignorance of @katyperry is alarming-its as bad as J Lo saying music will bring America together and heal
@IanDunt @dialogician What...no thumbs up pic with the Pope?
@CheriJacobus @seanhannity Didn't Assange imply that Seth Rich was a source for Wikileaks?
@MSNBC @clairecmc She is disgusting. POTUS could cure cancer and she would have a problem with it. So much hate but no solutions to real problems
@CarlyFiorina @CECPtweets Please keep talking about term limits-Professional Political Class is your call for term limits. WE ALL AGREE
@DailyCaller Truth is it should have never been that close of a race.HRC/Podesta/Mook never took responsibility.Blame HRC for being compromised candidate
@CillizzaCNN The real question is Can DT learn from his mistakes? Probably not if he thinks he has made no mistakes-Unteachable-He needs to clean house
@ChrisCuomo POTUS hasn't broken any laws. He can leak whatever info he wants and he can tell Come et al to drop investigation-still legal@alandershowitz
@MZHemingway @IngrahamAngle Bashing all things TRUMP is good for ratings-Colbert is proof BUT the prob is they don't care about facts
@larryelder Because they hate DT and what he stands for BUT not sure how they can use DT words from campaign and ignore what's in the travel ban
@politico @sbg1 Remember Podesta's password was P A S S W O R D... which makes him S T U P I D
@JoeNBC You are still pissed from when DT outed you and Mika	https://t.co/WRfxyURzyA
@JoeNBC https://t.co/WRfxyURzyA
@samsteinhp Bill Clinton LAWYERED UP and his lawyer either killed himself or was murdered-not sure what to believe
@dialogician @JakeSherman Politics probably-hate comes in all forms I've noticed but none more toxic than MSM journalism.I wish they would get back to reporting facts
@RevJJackson @CAU  https://t.co/SzCaTuJbgF
@seanhannity They should sue Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She was DNC chairman at the time and never really was held to account for nixing Bernie
@surfermom77 @GeorgiaDirtRoad @AshleyWarrior @JohnTDolan @JustMy_NameHere @bradcrain @tteegar @VFL2013 @gearmeister @comermd @Corrynmb Dems are so desperate and Repubs are having to support a POTUS that cant stop hurting his own presidency.Glad to be Independent-Country 1st!
@dialogician @JakeSherman Well lets remember that she is a Jew so she would cover her head in Israel but didnt in Saudi Arabia bc thats not her religion	/culture
@jaketapper I never see you write neg stories on democrates. Let me help you out jake	https://t.co/AMuoiOP5fW
@washingtonpost Free Speech or pathetic protest? Its disrespectful to the university,faculty, and alumni to do this.Feigning moral outrage-low info students
@WayneDupreeShow Not sure why @EvelynNFarkas isnt in jail if she leaked info....must not be true
@Harlan @JoeBiden He is way too old. Plus if ppl r bothered by DT loose lips then they will be horrified by Joe Bidens inability to have disciplined message
@JakeSherman Ivanka covered her head bc its so windy
@ChrisCuomo Read your tweets Cuomo-You are so in the bag for Dems and will never give DT credit for anything positve
@FornewsJon @WayneDupreeShow I respectfully disagree-DT is not a detail oriented planner obviously but he knew the optics would be bad to keep him so he canned him
@jaketapper Jake -Clintons accepted millions from Saudi Arabia to Clinton Foundation-did you report that? NO. Your bias is showing or should I say hate
@WayneDupreeShow No doubt that DT did try to influence Comey to drop investigation but did not order him to do so which is a big difference
@RealJamesWoods Question is can he reduce these constant attacks by having a disciplined message and if he could JUST STOP TALKING and be POTUS-
@RealJamesWoods Its just more hyper-vigilance by the Left-they are  "nut snapping" him and his administration at every opportunity.
@JoeNBC @WillieGeist Your constant TRUMP bashing is helping your #s but there is no watchable content beyond that. You use to hammer progressives w tuff Qs
@JohnKStahlUSA Yet they are starting to win in the ratings as are late night shows bashing Trump which is the common thread-all 3 shows unwatchable-
@robbystarbuck @langlotz1 @GlennThrush @Reuters Not to mention the fact that Pres Clinton could have killed OBL and didnt even though he knew he was planning to hurt USA
@GlennThrush Did you write about how the Clinton Foundation took millions from rich Arabs? Crickets.....you feigning moral outrage is a joke right?
@brianstelter That's the OReilly factor-Fox had no choice but to fire him but lost viewers and sponsors anyway
@JoeNBC Really Joe-you are such an intolerant puke when it comes to anything Donald. You are truly hard to watch these days
@politico @ChrisCuomo Why has POTUS allowed The Commissioner of IRS, John Koskenin, to keep his job? Maybe fears leak of his tax return
@brithume POTUS is unteachable...unable to learn how to NOT hurt himself and move this country forward. 3juststoptalking
@EWErickson Can POTUS pardon himself?
@realDonaldTrump 	Time to quit and go home. Pence can take it from here.
@Liz_Wheeler @Billybobtn Fire Bannon and Priebus is a good place to start
@seanhannity Do you agree that POTUS brings it on himself, mostly?
@IngrahamAngle @POTUS That's speculative horse poo-Trump didnt try to obstruct bc he didn't ORDER Comey to drop investigation but u weren't there so #speculation
@JoeNBC The real reason is Bill Oreilly is gone
@RevJJackson This is your legacy too Rev bc you have done nothing to stop the murders in Chicago https://t.co/hEqXwhaiLL
@samsteinhp and the incompetence continues....
@chuckwoolery @Billybobtn Yes but Chuck its all self inflicted errors. DT is so UNpresidential and his own worst enemy. Clearly-politics does not = business...#sad
@ccpatter74 @Morning_Joe @RepAdamSchiff POTUS will go down as a liar. Think about it....the press has higher approval ratings. Not sure how he gets this turned around
@jabolori @ChrisCuomo @NewDay Im so disgusted by both parties these days thats why Im an independent-truth and transparency should b the goal in reporting but sooo bias.
@Morning_Joe @RepAdamSchiff You didnt ask him 1..not 1 tough question. You are no better than a liberal reporter. Journalism lite is why I cant watch anymore
@Tommy_USA All the best to y'all !!!!!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Time to expose all these alleged violations-we need to stop being loyal to party and be loyal to our country. Be an Independent/citizen 1st
@JoeNBC @nytimes @WSJ @washingtonpost @morningmika You guys are soooo full of hate for POTUS is palpable-Its so hard to watch your show these days-so bias towards DT haters
@samsteinhp @lbarronlopez And why would they???? Give Dems an opportunity????? You know by now how all this works, Sam. Trump is a "shit show" but better than dems
@ChrisCuomo @NewDay Not True Chris-Alisyn Camerota continues to inject her "feelings" and opinion on all things Trump-NOT A REAL NEWS SHOW WITH OPINIONS
@JRubinBlogger @CheriJacobus How do you know? Sources?
@cathymcmorris You were just on TV and dont even know when IRS tax deadline is which is April 18th and you said 15th. You are not worthy of our faith
@jaketapper @kimguilfoyle is a climber and will step all over Sean Spicer to get that job. Bad news for SNL as Melisa McCarthy-cant pull that off
@brianstelter @NewDay If POTUS wld just stop talking and be pres it might work for him. Rise above the BS and deliver what he promised. MSM hates him-accept it
@Newsweek 	That's a good thing-Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies. Iran nukes threaten them so maybe they can take care of this threat
@IngrahamAngle 	not sure if POTUS is mentally ill or just stupid-no press briefings means that that  IS the story everyday...all day
@chuckwoolery 	put down the crack pipe Chuck-DT is for himself. He has no clue and if u have an honest moment w yourself u would c it too
RT @larryleclair: @MEPFuller America's White House has gone from Camelot, to that Shining City on the Hill, to the Twitter on The Shitter.
@THEHermanCain Well get your butt down there &amp; straighten them out,Herman! POTUS et al reputation is toxic-&amp;misunderstood bc he is a terrible communicator
@AllenWest If POTUS was an animal then he would be a cat bc cats LOVE to lick themselves...all day...lick lick lick
@AllenWest Is it a 10 foot portrait of POTUS bc Donald LOVES Donald?	Donald and Donald 	Sitting in a tree 	K I S S I N G!
@cardfin @CillizzaCNN I voted for the clown bc HRC is a criminal-I just want him to shut up,stop lying, and keep his promises. Too many unforced errors
@KarlaNBC12 @AndrewNBC12 Happy Birthday, Andrew.	I want sunshine for your birthday present
@CheriJacobus Stay on POTUS-eventually he will get tired of sticking his finger in the light socket and start telling the truth-lying costs him big time
@CillizzaCNN POTUS is in the deep end of the pool treading water.....look at his approval ratings...no confidence in POTUS
@ChrisCuomo The question is Does the FBIs investigation continue?It's not like Comey was doing the actual investigating. He should have been fired Day 1
@billoreilly I guess Fox owns the phrase No Spin Zone!
@JoeNBC Firing Comey is Yet another unforced error by Trump	Hope Comey sets the record straight
@JoeNBC 	Might be something THERE there
@BernieSanders Comey wasn't investigating -the FBI was and will continue to do so. Any proof they won't Bernie or are you just spewing vial
@JoeNBC 	No surprise-Trump is a walking-talking contradiction -he really is his own worst enemy -functions under false temerity
@RevJJackson 	Start with the mayor-start a movement to have him removed from office. He puts illegal immigrants before Chicago citizens
@RevJJackson 	In the mean time what are YOU doing about all the gun violence in Chicago?
@davidaxelrod @POTUS 	Maybe not sued but there will be consequences come 2018 elections
@RevJJackson Better stay focused on Chicago Rev https://t.co/Yxmgye6lF8
@SenSanders That's was Then and this is now-wait 5 minutes and POTUS may choose another view.
@brianstelter 	You only seem to report stories in such a way to support you and CNN bias narrative against anyone who doesn't think like you
@brianstelter 	What abt wapo chasing the hate symbols of graffiti on a church. Never told readers the pastor did it 	https://t.co/DHbEcI7wqE

@CillizzaCNN Someone save that picture of all those fat white guys (Republicans) to see how many get there smile wiped off their faces at the polls

@SenSanders 	Single Payer? Name 1 thing the govt does well. Why give them more responsibility when they can manage what they have.
@brithume Worst thing is there are people that watch his show and thats their only source for news.
@CillizzaCNN And if she never had that EMAIL problem then no letter-Clintons dont take responsibility for any failures-blamers and victims

@samsteinhp Will you acknowledge that Obama sold more guns(indirectly) than any person ever just by being anti-gun?
@ValerieJarrett @AprilDRyan @GBLAimpact now I'm shaking my head......

@jessebwatters You are lying but you learned from the best @billoreilly 	Nobody believes you -you disrespected your family. You should be ashamed

@JasonMillerinDC Hows Mulvaney impressive by threatening to take healthcare from millions if POTUS doesnt get his way. Its cowardice to take from those folks
@seanhannity @nytimes Like you r extremely bias but from a conservative perspective. You have certainly gulped the DT cool aid so why not admit it and move on
@seanhannity @nytimes Was NYT fake when they broke the Hillary email server story? Why not just be honest when talking about NYT and say they are extremely bias

@AndrewNBC12 No way Andrew-very gross -now do your magic and make the sun come out!
@brianstelter Hey Brian-Have you ever reported on Donna Brazil-who was a CNN analyst-giving debate questions to HRC/Dems?
@cafedotcom @MattBinder These are the same people that laughed when others predicted Donald Trump would be president. They never learn. Where is HRC? Not in WH
@JLaroc318 @politico @SenSchumer Very Funny!-wished i would have thought of that one! Cheers
@SenatorLeahy Why dont you retire already....seriously-You are partially responsible for the SHIT SHOW that is Washington DC. How about some new blood
@brianstelter Tucker has more of a confrontational style like Bill O-needs to work on his interview skills.Bit 2 partisan-needs to defend truth not party
@RealJamesWoods 'Shattered' exposes HRC campaign culture of her never wanting to hear criticism and blames everything on staff. Terrible person her and Bill
@ggreenwald @GovHowardDean That's why he isnt running the DNC-wonder what the ACLU would say about what he said-if they actually had the courage to comment
@Billybobtn @maggieNYT Source?
@brianstelter Notice how POTUS didnt send a pallet of cash like Obama did.
@brianstelter Bills next book title is Killing Bill OReilly
@nickconfessore @jmartNYT @npfandos @rachel_shorey What? The swamp is the Professional Political Class-That is the swamp.	Carly Fiorina was and is right. Term limits! Get them out

@MichaelCohen212 @ChrisCuomo @CNN @NewDay Dems are so desperate-they do not care about truth when a lie will better fit their Trump bashing narrative.
@davidaxelrod @GOP @realDonaldTrump You fail to mention that the Repubs had over a dozen candidates against 1 Dem. Dishonest of you to quote #s didn't get over 50%

@CillizzaCNN she was a deeply flawed candidate/person. DNC backed her and screwed Bernie-Russians exposed her-that's what happened-PERIOD
@SenSanders how's that new lake house, Bernie
@samsteinhp Email list? How about the 30k emails she never turned over.
@brianstelter @DanRather You really are a low life Stelter-cant get your own ratings so you have to try to rip ur competition to take from them-Shame on CNN

@JoeNBC Bannon should have never been a part of admin-too controversial and polarizing. Getting rid of him will bolster DT poll #s

@RandPaul Oh we forgot you are a Libertarian-you dont care what happens in the world. Glad you never got out of the gate when running for POTUS

@DLoesch 	Karma! https://t.co/kMP5YYNtoD
@GlennThrush @POTUS @maggieNYT Mr Thrush- you have an inaccurate self-perception. Being a "bad ass" is different from showing ur ass-evolve
@USATODAY Reason? O'Reilly asks tough questions of all guests and u can't find that on most shows. He bullies them into answering

@CillizzaCNN Bill looks like he could use a $12 beers!
@CillizzaCNN It's the new journalistic standard-the phrase "may have" 	No proof needed these days-just look at ur colleagues
@CillizzaCNN It's Trump world-not having a plan IS the plan until he has a plan-clear as mud?
@LeoDiCaprio Disingenuous at best as this guy hops private jets etc......phony Hollywood feigning outrage over the environment.....again
@KennedyNation Funny-Its the other way around-Lawyers obscure the illegal and reprehensible facts for their own gain
@CNBC Does Ivanka. Trump still have a stake in the Trump International Hotel in DC?
@maggieNYT What-did YOU just criticize Obama? Glad I was sitting down-you write zero positive stories-so write about failed ACA,IRS, Benghazi, Syria
@SenJeffMerkley Pathetic attempt to stop a confirmation that you cant stop. Typical of Professional Politcal Class-we need term limits NOW
@eucopresident @maggieNYT To include Obama-inaction itself is support for the Assad regime. bad enough that Obama helped to create ISIS by remov all troops from Iraq
@ByronYork @SteveDoocy Schiff is a true partisan hack and the fact that he is not willing to at least foreshadow the intel he saw as disturbing is telling
@nprpolitics Obama did nothing so he does share responsibility BUT it is Putin and Assad who are to blame-Obama allowed this to happen
@ezraklein Will POTUS approval ratings improve if he takes action on N Korea and Syria in a timely manner?
@ChrisCuomo Rice chose Andrea Mitchell bc she knew she would not be asked tough questions-pathetic. We deserve the truth
@ChrisCuomo Rice knows damn well that you will ask REAL questions regarding her involvement in "surveillance/unmasking" so she will not be on ur show
@foxandfriends Marketing? They spend their time trying to figure out how to trick people into buying products they dont want or need-1 mind-F after another
@NBCNews TERM LIMITS!!!! Its time we limited the partisan BS with term limits. Its a shame there are only 2 parties-Libertarians are not viable
@mitchellreports And Benghazi was caused by a video? She lies yet you give her safe haven on your show to cont lying. Where is your journalist integrity?
@GMA Im not sure how Obama can sleep at night. His lack of resolve and leadership created a vacuum which Putin filled. Shame
@GMA It is Obamas fault-He did nothing to stop over 500,000 ppl being murdered-652 children last year alone AND Puttin/Assad cont the killing
@CillizzaCNN Petty Chris

@brithume Watch out Brit @brhodes will play the race card next. Rice has lied in the past and cant be trusted
@CillizzaCNN Truth is Bill O a record of sexual harassment-needs to be suspended but ......money over morals is how Fox chooses to address this issue
@CillizzaCNN Not weird-US not giving that punk anymore attention in the media. Smart. China better step in -N Korea is Chinas red headed step child
@RealJamesWoods Valerie Jarad probably has her hand in this as well. MSM will not lift a finger to investigate and report anything neg re Obama admin
@ChrisCuomo Given Rices proclivity to lie, why would anyone doubt she did what she did for political reasons? She needs to be held to account
@ChrisCuomo Its too bad NATO is so worthless. Time for POTUS to fly a cruise missile up Assads a$$. Over 500k ppl killed 652 kids last year alone
@JoeNBC Damn Right Joe! Spot on-DT needs to fly a cruise missile up someone's A$$! Enough is enough already !
@secupp That's a RED LINE! Chemical weapons are not to be tolerated. Time to fly a cruise missile up someone's A$$.Do something POTUS
@T_LoPurple @Billybobtn very disappointed in Diane Feinstein. She is usually "less political" than the rest of senate Dems.

@ChrisCuomo This is what Karma looks like https://t.co/uxdlgFanLn
@ChrisCuomo Senate is suppose to be above such partisanship. Longer terms and a different mandate than House. I think the bad blood started w Harry Reid
@ChrisCuomo Repubs might find those 8 votes to get Gorsuch to 60 votes. We will know this week
@WayneDupreeShow So stupid-not slaves. Time to stop giving Rev Al air time if he is going to distort and misrepresent the truth. He is a POS and opportunist
@BernieSanders How's your new Lake House Bernie?
@greta go Greta-thank you for always seeking truth and fairness. I don't care what network you call home..I'm watching. Integrity matters!
@ChrisCuomo so funny-nobody AND I MEAN NOBODY from DT team thought he would win including DT. So disingenuous.
@CNN @brianstelter They should fire Bill OReilly on principle. Fox chooses ratings over right. Time to boycott
RT @FoxNews: WATCH: @JudgeJeanine's full interview with @KellyannePolls. https://t.co/d89vGqdPAc
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @KellyannePolls 	Wish Judge Jeanine would have been suspended for being Intolerant. America is diverse-adjust already
@RealJack AND @BernieSanders calling the travel ban a Muslim ban gives ISIS recruiting narrative-not a Muslim ban if 85% can travel here.
@RealJack Right-and dont forget climate change is more dangerous than ISIS according to Obama and Bernie.
@larryelder Why is John Koskinen still the IRS commissioner? Seriously??????
@AprilDRyan Keep shaking your head, April! Its working

@FesterGaris @GSDDogLover @Billybobtn 	I stand for that good news except the hating on other religions and is WHY our cntry was founded.
@blazinbling91 @GSDDogLover @Billybobtn 	it's called civil discourse-name calling reveals ignorance and intolerance.

@PhyllisCobianc1 @StockMonsterUSA @jessebwatters 	If you keep moving to the right you are going to fall off of your flat earth
@PhyllisCobianc1 @StockMonsterUSA @jessebwatters 	I voted for DT who promised to pivot and be presidential. I'm still waiting
@DanScavino @realDonaldTrump @DailyCaller 	Morell has zero credibility. He is a dem who helped craft Obamas Benghazi talking points.CIA lies
@inocel_l @WayneDupreeShow	No other MSM even covering this story. I hope there is a subpoena coming her way to explain
@EvelynNFarkas @nytimes 	Knock Knock....who's there? Take that subpoena !
@StockMonsterUSA @jessebwatters Talking over people and not allowing them to finish their point is unprofessional-learned from Bill O
@EvelynNFarkas @nytimes Better keep your lawyer on speed dial. You have some explaining to do so please make yourself to other news outlets
@GSDDogLover Then why are you hating on Muslims? It's not us against them. What would Christ do? Not hate or ridicule people of other faiths
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews POTUS name calling just gives credibility to Chuck Todd-too dumb to realize it. Very unpresidential
@mikebarnicle@ProPublica Professional Political Class always increase wealth while in DC. Needs to be investigated but MSM can't see past DT
@mikebarnicle @ProPublica Remember this story? 	https://t.co/ssvpm4ubuk
@GSDDogLover @Billybobtn Do you even know a Muslim or do you like to generalize Islam. Love and acceptance of others-that's Christianity
@KellyO @IvankaTrump How about that Evelyn Farcas story Kelly?
@Rambobiggs HRC and Clinton Foundation pretends to care about woman's rights yet took money from rich Saudis
@greta Why not cover that Evelyn Farcas story?
@AprilDRyan Why aren't you covering the Evelyn Farcas story? @EvelynNFarkas has come forward with very relevant information-
@morningmika why aren't you covering the Evelyn Farcas story Mika?
@morningmika No- I like Spicer going directly after media but he needs to be respectful and not BE the news. Respect goes both ways
@Newsweek Religious Left and Liberal Republicans. It's a movement to becoming Independent-never have to back a party again
@billmaher Funny Bill-It took a village to cover up HRC crimes and to never hold Obama accountable. But YOU would never lose your doctor....period
@SenSanders So disingenuous -@JaneMayerNYer Have you looked into George Soros? If not then you have ZERO credibility when it comes to big$ in politics
@BraddJaffy @maggieNYT And then there is the Trump Hotel right there in DC just down the road from the Whitehouse -inappropriate -should be sold
@thehill Jen Psaki should know-she helped cover for HRC while working at the State Dept-shame on you for helping to deny the truth from USA
@EvelynNFarkas You wanted so badly to be relevant and in the spotlight. Well, repubs are coming for you-Better get a lawyer handy.
@porcelli_mike @mrntweet2 @Leisure199 He feigns journalistic outrage all the time. Like when POTUS goes after the media. False sense of journalistic integrity and fairness
@CillizzaCNN Pathetic-what's the latest polls say re press approval ratings? Has to be in the teens
@seanhannity Witch hunt? Sure but its POTUS unforced errors that are hurting him. But like Spicers approach in press conference-he goes righ at them!
@BraddJaffy Up is down and down is up. Welcome to Trump world. Like Mattis and Kelley though.Solid picks and Mattis has set N Korea straight
@Bronco_7777 @IngrahamAngle Freedom Caucus are a group of Conservatives who want to repeal and NOT replace ACA.Right wingers intolerant of others to middle/left
@IngrahamAngle OR it was just a bad bill. POTUS should have not rushed and put together a bill he knew would pass. It's on Trump
@ShannonBream @JoeManchinNews I trust Joe- Glad he is voting for Gorsuch!
@JoeNBC In the words of W	That's some weird shit!
@IngrahamAngle @LifeZette Kasich wins in that case. He should be the POTUS
So we all enjoy these medical advances yet no anti-salt pill or anti-sugar pill! WTF or as my wife says MFL
@SenFeinstein Stop playing politics! Gorsuch is highly qualified and you voted yes 4 him in the past

@ChrisCuomo I hope that Kasich challenges Trump in 2020. HE should have been president. He doesnt have an extreme bone in his body-real experience
@ChrisCuomo Wrong-POTUS knows there is a lot of hate for Hillary out there. Speaks to his base
@washingtonpost Her getting the name wrong doesn't excuse Obamas lack of respect for the Foley family by playing golf same day.
@washingtonpost She just got the name wrong-when James Foley was murdered.Obama played golf and was photographed laughing etc. O apologized
@Morning_Joe Trump hating has increased your viewership at the expense of your conservatism. You are no longer a conservative or journalist!
@ezraklein @voxdotcom POTUS legacy will be his serial lying to the American people. He lies about almost everything.
@USATODAY Spot on! There will always be division and strife until he apologizes for all the hurtful things he has said
@zerohedge @MariaBartiromo Dems don't realize that every time they quote NPelosi and Schumer they lose credibility re Bi Partisan fairness
@larryelder So what about the vulnerable Larry? The least among us need help. Where do they get healthcare? Solution?
@CillizzaCNN Question is why arent POTUS approval #s lower?Epic fail on Healthcare reform but pelosi/schumer #s should be same#goIndependent
@CNNPolitics Truth before Trump-should appoint independent investigator for Truth and Transparency sake not to unseat Trump.
@Eugene_Robinson @washingtonpost Bill Clinton finally learned how to get things done by moving to the middle. But Trump is unteachable
@WillieGeist How many??? 10 people?
@foxandfriends Better to ask for forgiveness than permission? Nunes has to go and he can give Bannon a ride when he leaves
@theblaze It was a bad bill PERIOD. Ryan et al tried to get repubs onboard by arm bending rather than deal making. Bannon needs to go-
@SonnyBunch @redsteeze Govt doesnt fund PP in any way-PP provides healthcare for woman which allows PP to bill Medicaid for these services. Abortion cant be billed
@Morning_Joe Joe-in addition to bashing POTUS for 2 hours(3rd hour is a repeat)are you going to ask any of your guests tough questions?#journalismLite
@SenSanders Healthcare Not a right but an obligation we should have to take care of each other. How's that new lake house Bernie?

@Peggynoonannyc Oh its moving alright-more like bowel movement-print media is so bias they lack credibility. That's moving?
@RepHensarling @POTUS That's Freedom? Let's be honest-Conservatives want to repeal and NOT replace ACA. Fine w dropping 24mil people. Bad law Bad leadership
@Jim_Jordan You sound like Obama/Gitmo re campaign promise. Its clear that you are fine w 24 mil losing healthcare to keep a promise-thats conservative?
@RealJamesWoods @HillaryClinton You can bet #assange would have been very concerned about HRC as POTUS. She would have him zapped to keep him from leaking her BS
RT @pollack_steven: @maggieNYT Yes, she was spotted about an hour prior to death of bill. Here's proof. https://t.co/vnvnKbkNtN
@samsteinhp Not a DT fan but I think he meant that people will suffer and they can blame Dems-They voted for Obamacare and its on its last leg
@julieroginsky Now Dems have to continue to own Obamacare which is failing and will hurt dems in 2018
@JessieJaneDuff She lied as did the Obama administration and was never held accountable. Obstruction and false narratives worked for them-shame
@ScottAdamsSays @Billybobtn The problem is that there is a lot of smoke here but no smoking gun. DT had a campaign empl travel to Russia before election-lots of smoke
@kb_wakeuppeople Why not allow lead in their water too like in Flint MI. We shouldn't take from people who already have very little
@kb_wakeuppeople Its 3%-So you would take healthcare away from low income women just bc you dont believe in Abortion? Not ur body or ur choice.
@jaketapper Well this POTUS is a blamer and never takes responsibility for any of the messes he creates. Hold him accountable MSM

@brianefallon Pathetic-you know damn well Gorsuch will be confirmed whether Dems try to stop him. He will be SCOTUS-deal with it and pick another fight
@ChrisCuomo Just send the same bill they sent to Obama and repeal ACA w 2 yr sunset and replace it w thoughtful/inclusive healthcare bill.
@GlennKesslerWP POTUS lies are called out by every MSM except @FoxNews. Not fair and balanced when hosts always give own conservative views.
@ChrisCuomo That's one of the problems w this POTUS-He favors expediency over excellence. This is a bad bill -go back and do it again the right way
@TheFix @RepChrisCollins I hope you get voted out-Its bad enough that our POTUS is inarticulate. Clean this up

@dillion_fath @ReliableSources @brianstelter You could plug that guy into IMAX or any video format and he is not credible. You a Brietbart fan? Not credible

@NancyPelosi @POTUS Hold your breath......PLEASE hold your breath!!!
@Castlette7 DT won't go to Hawaii. you do know that Obama is out of office? Right?
@TheSportsSavior Too much $$ but it was Obama home state so once per year is understandable. DT owns Mar-a-logo-inappropriate to go there
@RevJJackson @borosage Rev-You live in Chicago...how can you support a mayor who does nothing about the murder rate. Get ur head out of the 60s and do something https://t.co/hFGM176N2E
@HallieJackson @PeterAlexander This kid is just mimicking how he sees coaches and players act when things dont go their way.
@samsteinhp I wonder if POTUS lies about his score too or if he uses the ole foot wedge to improve his ball position.
@CNNSotu @CNN @SecPriceMD Price is a snake oil salesman and should not be trusted. He reeks of dishonesty -make him answer ur questions-24 mil dropped in this plan
@ChrisSnyderFox @BretBaier Why do we even have Camp David? How much does it cost tax payers everytime he goes to Mar-a-Lago? Did we magically pay off our natl debt?
@Szvetitz @RTDNEWS Virginia never disappoints to disappoint-hard to pull for them in any sport except Lacrosse
@larryelder @maddow Is it too late to blame George Bush?
@jaketapper It all comes down to T&amp;A-Transparency and Accountability. Tillerson must think the press is a personal option-Free Press nec for democracy
@TheSportsSavior It costs about 200k per hour to fly AF1 and ALL presidents show total disregard 4 that expense.DT will never use Camp David
@brianstelter @CNNMoney Doesn't the judge have high level friends in FBI and DOJ that he gets info from?
@ChrisSnyderFox @BretBaier How much does it cost American tax payers every time he goes to Mar-a-logo?
@RTDNEWS @TerryMcAuliffe Great idea-adding another layer of protection is very good. Bad people will think twice if they know armed guards r presnent
@samsteinhp Need to add breakfast too where needed

@WillieGeist @VandyMBB Glad to see you have Virginia going so far. Cant get hopes up bc Virginia never disappoints to disappoint.
@foremitchell1 @ChrisCuomo Roger Stone is a bad guy but got kicked to the curb fairly early on by DT.
@julieroginsky ACA is failing so you can name it anything you want but it wont fix the problems. Need to take politics out of caring for fellow citizens
@RevJJackson Don't you live in Chicago? How could you possibly support the mayor? https://t.co/WRH8uUKE57
@ChrisCuomo This level of dishonesty by a sitting president is beyond disturbing.DTs lies and distorts the truth so easily-will be a part of his legacy
@NancyAFrench @NRO @DavidAFrench Someone needs to tell you that Muslims are PEOPLE-ISIS distorts Islam for their own murderous purposes. 1.7 billion live peacefully-EVOLVE!
@RepGutierrez @RepGutierrez Why dont you fight for American families and our citizens? Plenty of hurting families here so do your job and protect them
Well at least her blaming alt-right for her special bombing is hilarious!	https://t.co/eagjtgIqGJ
@thehill Its not a Muslim ban if 85% of Muslims in the world can travel here. There is no DIGNITY in politics if you lie to promote a false narrative
@washingtonpost GM doesnt want to get bad mouthed by POTUS-bad press but GM doing the right thing for what ever reason
@TooMuchHate2017 @DanOh1970 @ChrisCuomo @NewDay
