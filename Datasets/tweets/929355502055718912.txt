@egavactip Right, because if someone wanted to do harm to police officers the best way to do that is to soak a bunch of paper in an ethenol / fentanyl bath, dry it out (scrape off the fentanyl crystals) then print out a political flyer and stick it in their windows. Checks out.
@egavactip What's more ridiculous, the idea that a police department is lying, or that a bunch of conspiracy theorists figured out how to somehow dissolve a synthetic drug and lace it with printer paper then use it to put flyers in peoples car windows for....no discernible reason at all?
@egavactip Here's another question, how does one 'lace' printer paper with an opiate without smearing the ink?
@egavactip Considering these flyers are from a 501(c) who is fairly readily identifiable, I'm going with the HPD is lying.
@egavactip Make people addicted to consuming information about microwave weapons? No....this doesn't even remotely make any sense.
@egavactip Ok, so you can't get high by touching fentanyl, and it's rather expensive. So lets think about this. Someone printed out a bunch of flyers about police and military use of microwave weapons (conspiracy theory territory), then they spent a bunch of money on a synth drug to what?

@Urbscholar I used to.
@Urbscholar @CNN Pentest their infrastructure products, then come back and tell me it's not about 'phones'.
@CNN Huawei is not a 'smartphone maker' they are a telecom company that is operated by the Chinese Intelligence apparatus. Their products are designed to be exploited and are sold en'masse in nations that the Chinese government wants to exploit.
@Urbscholar WTF are you talking about? Do you work for Huawei or something?
@Urbscholar Nice non-argument.
@Urbscholar How many hours of your life have you spent disassembling Huawei code? How many of their cellular infrastructure products have you actively pentested? Tell me, what are the default credentials that are shared across their products.....what database backend do they use?
@Urbscholar You don't know what I know.
@Urbscholar @RepDebDingell No, they are not. Not even close. I refer you to my responses in this thread.
@RepDebDingell As one of the few subject matter experts on this topic, I can confidently say, that Huawei is not a company, they are an extension of the Chinese Intelligence apparatus. It is imperative that this company and it's products be isolated from all foreign markets, especially the US.
@RepDebDingell I have personally analyzed these products, and have found them to be intentionally designed to be vulnerable to exploitation at levels that far exceed a system that was simply poorly designed by incompetent programmers.
@RepDebDingell Not only is Huawei a national security threat to the US, they're a threat to multiple nations. Their products contain built in vulnerabilities that the Chinese MSS exploit, as well as other nations and individual hackers. This company dominates the middle eastern/African markets.

@r0wdy_ Build a database of known image MD5s, supply all AV vendors with those MD5s create a channel of communication between Federal agencies and AV vendors to alert them of the customers who have CP on their drives. That one is totally doable, and is kind of a shitty comparison. TBH

@CerebralMisjif The truth is, the Civil Rights movement was the greatest thing that ever happened to those in power. The popularization of non-violent resistance has lead to the development of a social paradigm where anyone who perpetrates violence is the villain, no matter the reason.

@AmandaRTubbs @jenniferemorrow @JenniferMorrow Why are you so devoted to this? Honestly I thought that echo chamber comment would get like 2 likes and zero responses. However, you and your responses are becoming increasingly fascinating to me. What is the catalyst here? Am I actively making you angry?
@AmandaRTubbs @jenniferemorrow @JenniferMorrow This discussion is venturing into the realm of the non-constructive. If you want to hate me because of my gender, that is ok. We're dicks, I fully agree. I was just trying to offer some constructive advice to avoid the pitfalls that others have fallen into.
@AmandaRTubbs @jenniferemorrow @JenniferMorrow The point I was attempting to make was that we as leftists should avoid the problems that the right is having. Robert Frost said  "A liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel." I agree with that. All points of view should be considered, and debated.
