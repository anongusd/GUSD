I couldn't agree more. Members of Congress should work #ForThePeople, not for corporate special interests. @RepAngieCraig's legislation has my full support. https://t.co/DEesH1Z5RM
March is #WomensHistoryMonth. I‚Äôm honored to be part of a historic class with a record number of Congresswomen &amp; thankful for the women who paved the way for us to serve. https://t.co/Qpl35Xjvsk
I proposed my first amendment today, which would require a study on how firearm possession affects survivors of domestic violence &amp; give Congress the info we need to improve our background check process to protect survivors. It was adopted on a bipartisan basis. WATCH &gt;&gt; https://t.co/QMi0mhq2We
Gun violence interacts in harmful ways with domestic violence. I ensured that that legislation we passed today to close the Charleston loophole would also give us data on what changes we might need to our background check process to protect domestic violence survivors. https://t.co/ZdH2Aaw8o5
I‚Äôve decided to cosponsor the Medicare for All Act of 2019.		Read my statement &gt;&gt; https://t.co/17NZuG6EDK

The disclosure of sensitive, personally identifiable information is a harm. Just ask @Equifax CEO Mark Begor. https://t.co/wkoaBsHRUf
The legislation also includes designates over 1 million acres of wilderness‚Äîincluding 5 new recreation areas in California. As a Cub Scout Mom, I understand the need to preserve our nation‚Äôs rich natural landscapes for future generations to enjoy. This is a big win #ForThePeople.
I‚Äôm joining my House colleagues now to permanently extend the Land and Water Conservation Fund #LWCF, which takes royalties from offshore drilling to fund conservation of our #PublicLands. This commonsense program has already protected millions of acres of lands from mining.

Happy to see my friend @GavinNewsom tonight for a bipartisan briefing on issues impacting California, especially wildfires. Whether Democrat or Republican, the CA delegation is fighting for our state in Washington. https://t.co/zsKljzgJ9k
It‚Äôs time to close the #CharlestonLoophole. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm supporting a commonsense bill sponsored by @WhipClyburn that will extend the waiting period for firearm purchases to 10 days, to ensure that guns don‚Äôt end up in the wrong hands.
In 2016, the Charleston loophole meant that 4,170 guns were sold to people with criminal records, mental illnesses, or other circumstances which should have prevented them from being able to buy a gun‚Äîbecause FBI background checks weren‚Äôt completed in a three day window.
In 2015, the Charleston loophole in our gun safety laws allowed a self-proclaimed white supremacist to buy a gun that he then used to kill 9 black parishioners at a Bible study‚Äîdespite a record of illegal drug possession that should have disqualified his purchase.
President Trump will be in Vietnam for a summit this week. I sent a bipartisan letter with 26 colleagues, including @BradSherman &amp; @RepTedYoho‚Äîthe Chairman &amp; lead Republican on @HouseForeign Subcommittee on Asia‚Äîasking the President for his help in securing Michael‚Äôs release. https://t.co/8uIwvuflRV

Unintended pregnancies put a huge financial burden on women, particularly women in workplaces without family leave policies. A woman‚Äôs right to choose when/if she has a child is critical to economic justice. Attacks like these threaten progress we‚Äôve made toward gender equity. https://t.co/4j86PynYbp
I‚Äôm backing @JoaquinCastrotx‚Äôs resolution to end the #FakeTrumpEmergency as a cosponsor. Declaring an emergency to circumvent Congress‚Äôs power of the purse tramples on our nation‚Äôs tradition of checks and balances. It‚Äôs unconstitutional. https://t.co/DLqRQAlySu
Happy Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day! We‚Äôre fortunate to have the @UCIEngineering School right here in #CA45‚Äîand we should do all we can to break down the barriers for women and girls accessing and succeeding in world-class engineering programs like @UCIrvine‚Äôs. https://t.co/ebGaP6QCRq

Keeping our communities safe is at the heart of Orange County values. It‚Äôs past time for Congress to take action to prevent gun violence‚Äîlet‚Äôs start by passing #HR8, the Bipartisan Universal Background Checks Act, and then continue to work together on gun safety.
Happy to see so many faces at my #CA45 Mission Viejo town hall! Our democracy works best when I can take your voices with me to Washington to fight for OC families like yours‚Äîand I promise to do just that. https://t.co/Axk4aKnNqD

.@usedgov should have held Argosy and Dream Center responsible for making empty promises to students. Instead, they were given free rein to make a quick buck at students‚Äô and taxpayers‚Äô expenses. If @BetsyDeVosED won't bring accountability to these con artists, I will.
It‚Äôs unacceptable that Argosy University and parent company Dream Center defrauded students in the 45th District and across the country. Some students are unable to pay rent or buy groceries, and $9 million of taxpayer-funded student aid has gone missing. https://t.co/MR6BeIFz7i
Western State law students in #CA45 still haven‚Äôt received the federal financial aid from their school that was expected in early January. I met with these students today to hear how I could best support them. This will be one of my top priorities until the situation is resolved. https://t.co/O1NPfF5tib
@BetheeH There will be more to come!
I will cosponsor a bill to end this #FakeTrumpEmergency and continue to support efforts to restore checks and balances to our government.
The President cannot use an emergency declaration to advance a personal project that the majority of Congress and the American people don‚Äôt want to fund. This runs counter to our country‚Äôs commitment to the rule of law.
@LT92692 @VivAd73 Looking forward to seeing you there!

As a single mom of three young kids, I know how hard work-life balance can be‚Äîand I‚Äôm committed to working on bills that make life easier for working families, whether it‚Äôs paid family leave or allowing more pre-tax income to go towards childcare. https://t.co/fDEvgUapdg
FACT: 11 million families in America with children under age 18 are single parent households. Single parents need to have a seat at the table when we talk about how Washington can do better for working families.

The @CFPB‚Äôs decision to roll back rules for the payday lending industry is just the latest sign of the Trump Administration putting corporate profits ahead of protecting American families from abusive practices. #CultureOfCorruption https://t.co/HZctbJaxcd
It‚Äôs no secret why the payday lobby spends lavishly at Trump properties. It pays off when Trump‚Äôs @CFPB sides with loan sharks over consumers.
.@MickMulvaney once said ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn‚Äôt talk to you. If you‚Äôre a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.‚Äù I‚Äôm sure the payday lending lobby is happy they gave him so much money when he was in Congress. https://t.co/8qoxzodGF6

I fought for my seat on @FSCDems to make sure what happened in 2008 never happens again. There will be aggressive oversight if Otting tries to undo the work we‚Äôve done so far (much more left to do) to make homes affordable for ALL Americans.
Buying a home is the largest purchase most Americans will make in their lives. If we ever want to live in a country where equality is more than just a concept, it is critical that we enforce fair mortgage lending terms.
The same Joseph Otting who *before* he was appointed claimed he does not believe discrimination exists in America. Remember this? https://t.co/8IDqyZuQbM
Joseph Otting was appointed by @realDonaldTrump to head the @USOCC: the agency responsible for policing discriminatory lending practices. He just gave @citibank a free pass on discriminating against people of color. https://t.co/RXe4e6C8LU

My heart is sick to hear of the loss of Noah Domingo‚Äîa bright freshman at @UCIrvine. As a mom, I can‚Äôt imagine the immense sadness his parents are feeling. I know the staff at UCI and @OCSheriff are working hard to provide answers &amp; support to loved ones in this difficult time. https://t.co/bLLZ3ZNQ3Z

Over 40,000 Californians are furloughed or working without pay because of the #TrumpShutdown. Some have resorted to borrowing from retirement accounts or GoFundMe accounts or missing loan payments. That‚Äôs unacceptable. #EndTheShutdown #GetGovtGoing	https://t.co/0GqMDqs4PH
Our TSA officers are working without pay‚Äîincluding mandatory overtime‚Äîbecause of the #TrumpShutdown. That‚Äôs not good security, and puts all Americans at risk. #EndTheShutdown
RT @RepAndyLevin: To mark Day 17 of the senseless #TrumpShutdown, @RepKatiePorter from #CA45 joins me to explain the devastating impact it'‚Ä¶
I was thrilled to have my kids for my first week in DC, but it also helped me reflect again on the challenges of balancing work and being a mom. As I told @politico, work-life balance is not like perfectly balanced scales‚Äîit‚Äôs balance like riding a bike; just keep moving forward! https://t.co/ubppZgh24r
Last Friday, I joined @HouseDemocrats in introducing #HR1 to reduce the influence of big money on Congress. With Washington working again for Orange County families instead of special interests, we can act on:	‚úÖ healthcare,	‚úÖ clean energy,	‚úÖ gun violence prevention,	and more.
My thoughts are with the victims of last night‚Äôs shooting in Torrance and their families. One of the first things I did after being elected was join the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, because we must do more to prevent tragedies like this. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/d04E7FDirh
Yesterday, I was sworn in to represent #CA45, with my kids at my side. I‚Äôm ready to get Washington working better for OC families. Follow here to see how I‚Äôm fighting for healthcare, campaign finance reform, clean energy, and gun violence prevention #ForThePeople. https://t.co/w6mNFkYiRN
