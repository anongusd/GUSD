If he's concerned w/ safety then why did he cancel key missile defense programs in Europe which are key 2 our safety and our allies?
He says Wash. should increase transparency-no backroom deals yet that's what he's overseen-closed door discussions, late night amendments.

Great visit at Lebanon at Bailey's.  The democrats must be worried-put a video tracker on me who's taping everything I and others say.
