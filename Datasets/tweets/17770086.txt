But the nature of journalism is to engage -- in exposing of truth, telling important stories, synthesizing information, hounding public officials. It's such an essential component to our democracy that the First Amendment assumes there will be effective watchdog news media.
If any other industry were in this kind of distress, wouldn't there be an organization forming to use political pressure to help stop the carnage? A modern Fairness Doctrine? Updated anti-trust statutes? Tax consequences for hedge funds? But journalists can't engage, right?

“This absolutely crossed a line. It’s disregarding possible human health consequences for whatever reason,” Beitsch said. “To be doing it for reasons that are bad, like political process and elections, that would be intolerable, unacceptable and shouldn’t be permitted.”
At a meeting on Nov. 2, in the midst of early voting for @ScottforFlorida, Beitsch said his boss, DOH Secretary Celeste Philip, made it 'very clear' that they were not to do 'anything right now'" about notifying residents of their toxic water. https://t.co/i5s8Z9j9Kc
The Department of Health said it “immediately notified well owners of results” and have “worked diligently to obtain the necessary permissions to conduct additional private well sampling.”
.@FLGovScott office rejected the suggestion that political considerations played any role in the notification timeline and directed reporters to the Department of Health for comment.
Must read story by @samanthajgross and @elizabethrkoh here: https://t.co/i5s8Z9j9Kc
What happened to Les Beitsch, the deputy secretary at the Florida Department of Health, when he complained of the delay by the @FLGovScott administration in notifying residents that their wells were contaminated with toxins by the state-run Fire College? He was fired.
The state officials in @FLGovScott administration scheduled an open house to inform the community but, alas, it had to be rescheduled - until December. It took 20 more days - until the eve of the election - to send letters to residents that their drinking water was toxic.
Whose else had water tested? "the Lowell Correctional Institution (a women’s prison), a convenience store/gas station, the mining company and seven residences."
Why is this timing significant? Because it was two months after the state-run Florida Fire College "started using bottled water and three days after test results showed contamination in their wells."
Must read from @samanthajgross and @elizabethrkoh about how officials in the @FlGovScott administration delayed informing Ocala residents that their well water may be contaminated with toxins until, guess when, the day before the Nov. 6 election. https://t.co/i5s8Z9j9Kc

@alevine014 @ryan_tyson I’ll accept that but after a look at the data and a look at what the “models” were based on. If it’s 2012, 2014 and 2016, the question is what else?
In this media-polarized age, @SenBillNelson may be last of a dying breed. In the 'death of the statesmen' era, it's not how you handle yourself in office that matters to voters, it's what you say -in the media. via @stevebousquet and @scontorno #mppdigital https://t.co/bjswRoIDg9

Inquiry and questioning of these massive social media platforms is needed, argues @sivavaid because “many of our important areas of life we have not been able to interrogate because they are proprietary” #mppdigital

The FDLE report also included some inconsistencies. For example, it twice noted that Latvala “denied having sexual intercourse in his Senate office.’‘ Neither McLeod, nor any of the other Senate witnesses interviewed by Swanson, ever accused Latvala of having sex in his office.
While Swanson distinguished between McLeod and Latvala’s relationship in his first term in office and his second term — noting that the degree of consent was distinctly different — FDLE and Campbell merged the events, referring to it as a “20-year consensual relationship”

Over the past six years, the coalition reported Carr received between $40,000 and $130,000 annually as part of that retirement plan, totaling $540,000. 8/8
Carr has income beyond her base salary. The year she made $761,560, the organization reported an additional $40,050 in deferred compensation and benefits. The coalition also reported she received $105,000 as part of an unusual supplemental retirement plan.
.@FlGovScott and several state legislators once criticized the domestic violence organization for overpaying the boss. But that was back in 2012, when it was reported that Carr was making $316,104. In fact, records show, Carr was actually receiving compensation of $457,164.
A @MiiamiHerald review found that Carr’s salary, as reported in the 990s, is far higher than those of the leaders of other state-funded nonprofits, even much larger ones.
The state, which provides slightly more than half of the coalition’s funding, apparently had no idea Carr was pulling down a hefty salary. In response to @MiamiHerald, DCF secretary ordered a “comprehensive financial audit" of all DCF "funds allocated to FCADV executive salaries”
She hit that mark after receiving pay raises totaling $313,475 over a two-year period...“We’re talking almost 2 percent of the budget being paid to one person. That’s pretty unusual.”

@FLGovScott Don Hinkle answers that it won't be moot and that this case applies to all citizens. (Note: Whatever is ruled here will be precedent when all those millionaires running for gov also decide to use blind trusts in the future.)
Judge Bilbery notes that @FlGovScott is in a contested Senate race "and the governor will have to have to disclose the assets in his revocable trust...Is this whole thing going to be moot before we can get an opinion out to both of you?"
This case exposes yet another flaw in Florida's ethics laws: the Ethics Commission can't order someone to disclose all finances, even if they think they haven't
Don Hinkle tells the court the core of the issue over @FLGovScott financial disclosure is "if there is a failure to make a full and fair disclosure, there has to be a mechanism to ensure that constitutional right to the citizens."
Attorney for @FLGovScott says the governor, Legislature or Supreme Court can remove the member of the Ethics Commission.
First DCA Judge Bilbrey asks: "What do you do if the Ethics Commission totally messes up the law. Does a complainant have no remedy whatsoever?"

What was Scott's role in either the company's decline or the shake-up of executives at his top investment? Neither he nor his advisers would respond to repeated attempts by the Herald/Times to get answers to questions.
Jon Smith, who replaced CSP's CFO in the management shakeup, said that when he took over "many things weren’t being done with any regularity or in any kind of systematic way" and equipment maintenance and customer communication was "equally scary."
"But loaded with debt, CSP struggled. In 2010, Scott disclosed that his share of the plastics company was valued at $19.4 million. By 2011, when Scott opened his first blind trust after taking office, he reported that the value of the CSP had dropped to $14.2 million."
"By 2006, with Scott at the helm, CSP acquired the plastics materials manufacturing and molding operations of ThyssenKrupp Budd Co. and the company reported revenues of $300 million. At this point, Scott saw himself in the business of automotive parts for the long haul."
When the governor led a state trade delegation to Japan in 2013 and met two of the would-be bidders in the sale of CSP — Mitsubishi and Teijin.
Scott's son-in-law, Jeremy Kandah, served as a non-voting member of the board of directors of CSP for two years before it was sold. Scott's longtime financial adviser, Gregory D. Scott, was also a longtime member of the CSP board.

Having so nailed their answers last night, Florida GOP candidates @adamputnam and @RonDeSantisF, tell the #Florida Press Association today they won't attend the FPA-hosted debate scheduled for Aug. 1 in West Palm Beach. It would have aired in all major TV markets.
@AlCardenasFL_DC Good suggestions. I'd be happy to come up with the specifics for the broad categories. Sounds like another debate is in order.
@fineout @adamputnam @AlCardenasFL_DC @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott @RonDeSantisFL Bottom line: These candidates should answer these questions. If the debate didn't focus enough on FL, it was the fault of the gov candidates, not the @FoxNews reporters.
@fineout @adamputnam @AlCardenasFL_DC @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott @RonDeSantisFL 6. Trade and tariffs: brought impact of a federal problem home to FL. Don't FL voters expect gov of third largest state to try to influence prez of his own party on this when it's could have a neg impact on an industry, and job growth? Q is very appropriate. Answers was dodged.
@fineout @adamputnam @AlCardenasFL_DC @realDonaldTrump @FLGovScott 5. Allegiance to the NRA: this issue is very relevant to both federal and state as it continues to play out for candidates of both parties. Both @RonDeSantisFL and @adamputnam got a softball Q for which they were able to recite their talking points. No FL news here.
@fineout @adamputnam @AlCardenasFL_DC @realDonaldTrump 4. E-Verify was an issue @FlGovScott campaigned on and faced legis defeat because he failed to understand the influence of ag industry. @adamputnam talks tough on immigration tough, but will he allow for penalizing industry employers? It was a good Q but answers were elusive.
@fineout @adamputnam @AlCardenasFL_DC @realDonaldTrump 3. Immigration: Anyone who doesn't think the national policy on immigration isn't a FL issue, doesn't live in FL. The gov can influence it's enforcement -- by supporting or pre-empting local control, allowing coordination with FL prisons,  support systems, safety nets, much more.
@fineout @adamputnam @AlCardenasFL_DC 2. Question about Trump's tone, civility, and Putnam's calling him "vile." Why this matters to FL? Because a pivotal to GOP primary is who is closer to @realdonaldtrump. It's the reporters' job to flush out the waffling each pol has exhibited. Good try. Didn't work.
@fineout @adamputnam Okay @AlCardenasFL_DC and others. Here's why I thot GOP gov's debate asked good, Florida focused Qs - but failed to get FL-focused answers: 		1. Should next chief justice overturn Roe v. Wade (not answered)? Why matters to FL: if abortion rights moves to states, next gov decides

Winners of the @FoxNews GOP debate: @marthamaccallum and @BretBaier. They asked well-prepared, FL focused, and tough questions. Predictably, the well-trained pols @adamputnam and @RonDeSantisFL avoided direct answers.
@fineout @adamputnam Thread:
Asked if he supports the trade war that's hurt citrus, @adamputnam pivots, blames the trade war of 20 years ago (wasn't he in Congress then?) and says @realdonaldtrump 'is fighting for us' and 'I'm excited to see a prez take on the trade wars'
Good question on FL losing 25k jobs because of @realDonaldTrump tariffs,  @RonDeSantisFL says he trusts prez's negotiating skills 'this is not the direction he's going...he's trying to get concessions'
The @FoxNews team has asked some hard questions of @adamputnam and @RonDeSantisFl, while others have been softies. The hard ones have not been answered yet according to my Tally.
RT @AP: Official: Suspect in newspaper shooting mutilated his fingers in apparent effort to prevent him from being easily ID'd. https://t.c…
Reminded that he said he would have vetoed the law approved post-Parkland. @RonDeSantisFL blames the Broward sheriff, the FBI and the schools 'they should have been removed'
Do you still describe yourself as a 'proud NRA sellout?' @adamputnam is asked. Softball question is used to repeat his talking points: 'defend our rights and protect our students in the schools'
E-Verify was one of last big legislative initiatives by @FLGovScott and killed by the agriculture community. Asked if he was right, @adamputnam pivots and compliments gov, doesn't endorse the policy.
Pivoting to blaming DC, @adamputnam says FL pays $100 m a year to house criminal illegal immigrants in prison system and accuses @RonDeSantisFL voted to give illegals food stamps.
With FL's 1200 migrant children housed in the state after @realdonaldtrump zero tolerance immigration policy, should prez have separated them? @RonDeSantisFL doesn't answer, says they never should have come here.
Good question by @marthamaccallum who asks if @realDonaldTrump is responsible for restoring civility. @RonDeSantisFL defends the prez: 'he is facing attack unlike any president we've seen'
RT @fineout: .@adamputnam says he never called Trump "vile and obscene." Here's the story with his comments: https://t.co/26amPOCX99
Good question by @BretBaier quoting @adamputnam for calling @realDonaldTrump 'vile' and setting the tone. Putnam denies he called him that and drops red meat crumbs, naming Maxine Waters, Tom Steyer, saying 'we can't let the left hijack FL politics'
RT @MitchEPerry: .@RonDeSantisFL can't quit talking about @POTUS
Do people know what 'constitutionalist' is? Most don't. They do know what it means to overturn Roe v. Wade. Neither @RonDeSantisFL nor @adamputnam answered the question. Both said they support appointing a 'constitutionalist' - which is not the same thing.

@FLGovScott Instead, this gives a signal that the Cabinet may look favorably on the locals that seek comp plan amendments to bend rules requiring permanent Keys residents to evacuate in 24 hours and for them to have a transportation model that shows that.
For anyone writing about the Florida Keys discussion at the Cabinet. The pro-affordable housing vote pushed by @flgovscott appears to have been just for show. DEO confirms they didn't need it, since the law allows the state planning agency to process these kinds of changes.

@foswi Excellent point. Turnover story.
@foswi I'm all for standing desks. Will reduce health care costs if every desk-sitter had one. However, there is a protocol for this kind of thing and some of the invoices raise questions about whether they went outside the protocol.
@foswi Because that's how it was identified in the records returned from the public records request -- desks and chairs for executive office and general counsel.
@Mdixon55 According to an undated letter of  resignation that metadata shows was created after his last day and when we asked for it.
The records also show $12,818 spent on several standing desks and chairs in DOR executive offices.
DOR's Biegalski enlarged his personal office by taking over the conference room, installed a big-screen TV that cost $1,408 to wire with cable, purchased a $1,451 desk and credenza from Amazon and a $578 chair from an executive office supply company.		https://t.co/Ys91LqQmBa

She said she told her doctors she would quit for three to four days to see what happened and they told her not to. She also admitted that she grows it "in my yard."
She said doctors have told her that her lungs are at 78 percent, "which is unheard of for ALS patient" and she credits it to smoking marijuana for 30 years.
"It just makes my life a lot more bearable,'' she said. "My doctors are not concerned about the risks because I'm still alive. in '86 I was given three to five years to live and I'm still here."
Jordan said she used medical marijuana in Oregon and has used other forms, including vaping but it "made me gag incessantly." She said the only method that works for her is smoking, which increases her appetite, helps her muscles and her excessive saliva, to preventing choking.

"The question is, does anybody care about prisoners?" asked Sen. @JeffreyBrandes. "I would feel better if the prisons were staffed and well maintained but they are 2,000 prison guards short."
An estimated 600 people working for companies that provide treatment programs will be laid off. An estimated 1,000 inmates will go back on the streets without training and transition programming. About 39 prison chaplains and prison librarians will go from 40 to 20 hours a week.
On Friday, Corrections Secretary Julie Jones submitted a budget request  seeking approval to make another $29.6 million in cuts. The money will come from 33 contractors who provide treatment and transition services to inmates at the end of their sentences.
The officers point to a policy at the agency that allows some offenders to mail in their own probation reports, significantly reducing home and office visits by probation officers.
It is not clear whether probation officers could have caught any warning signs that Ables could turn violent against Gentry, but the agency, which has been chronically underfunded by Gov. Rick Scott and legislators for years, has eliminated hundreds of probation officers' jobs.

After session, Corcoran again delayed a decision to consider a special session on gaming. Rumors surfaced he'd switch to attorney general's race. "The uncertainty gave the donor class hesitation,'' said @NickIarossi. "He was kind of left without a chair when the music stopped."

@joenegronfl .@joenegronfl adds: "I wouldn't ask for a carve out. I wouldn't vote for one myself.' He supports expanding slots to the 8 counties that had referendums 'but if there is going to be only 6 of 8, it should be fair'
.@joenegronfl says 'this carveout thing is a false narrative...a complete distraction' and House and Senate had worked out a process for how to selected 6 slots counties
@BillGalvano The uncertainty of replacing lost Seminole revenues, along with the special treatment sought for a carve out in St. Lucie County were among the last obstacles.
.@BillGalvano confirms: There will be no special session on gaming.

@JeffSolochek @FLBaloney Actually, that was directly discussed and addressed in debate on the floor today.
Write-candidate trick to close primaries is being blasted as a 'mockery' and a 'absolutely ridiculous' but @FloridaCRC Commissioner Tom Grady, a lawyer former state rep, says 'I don't see the loophole'
E-verify dies 12-24 as @FloridaCRC rejects idea after heavy business-backed lobbying effort.
Charter school companies show their might as @FloridaCRC defeats amendment to allow high performing public schools to compete with privately-run and for-profit charter schools. Only proposal defeated today.
Dog racing amendment by @TomLeeFL gets moved from the end of the list, having now become the top priority of @AGPamBondi.
Ethics proposal to end the ability to former legislators, local government officials, governors, agency heads and Cabinet officers to make money as lobbyists after they leave office makes it to the ballot 30-4.
Responding to @TomLeeFL, @ArtheniaJoyner, a lawyer, tells him: 'don't be so easy to offend your friends because I thought we were friends and you offended me'
Ethics reform will never happen says @TomLeeFL 'until we deal with the lawyers, and they don't want to practice law. They want to rain make, and they're doing one hell of a job with it.'
In a surprise admonishment, Don Gaetz chastises @FloridaCRC Style and Drafting committee for changing his ethics proposal, suggesting that it was rewritten against his wishes. He proposes a clarifying and somewhat watered down substitute.
Moving right along, @FloridaCRC votes 33-3 to ban oil and gas exploration on state waters while also banning vaping in indoor workspaces.
.@FloridaCRC votes 27-10 to put  "game changing" amendment on November ballot to open the door to allowing charter schools to be authorized by state officials instead of local school boards.
RT @doug_hanks: MIA confirms Mayor Gimenez wasn't there to great @realDonaldTrump. https://t.co/4qRKerAiJl
.@FloridaCRC votes 30-7 to give college scholarships to survivors of certain first responders and military, require a supermajority to raise fees at universities and a plan to establish the state college system as a constitutional entity. Likely to appear on ballot as Amend 7
.@FloridaCRC votes 34-3 to put onto the ballot a plan that creates a new constitutional right for crime victims as well as a plan to expand mandatory retirement age for judges and plan to change interpretation of administrative law
Predicts Commissioner @ArtheniaJoyner: 'if you put with the good with the bad  then they're just going to vote them all down'
Sixth @FloridaCRC bundle deletes obsolete language in three different parts of the constitution  relating to property rights, high speed rail and criminal statutes.
Here's fifth @FloridaCRC bundle: Create a new department of veterans’ affairs with a plan to create an office of counterterrorism and a plan to require Miami-Dade to elect its sheriff and a plan to move the legislative session to January every other year.
The fourth bundled proposal connects two things most people always think of together: oil drilling and vaping - banning exploration or extraction of oil and natural gas beneath from state waters and banning vaping in indoor workspaces
Here's the third @FloridaCRC bundle: Imposing 8-year term limits for school board members with a plan to require civic literacy in public schools and a plan to open the door for the state board of education to authorize charter schools in local districts.
Here's another amendment, logical right? 2. Giving scholarships to survivors of certain first responders and military with requiring a supermajority to raise fees at universities and a plan to establish the state college system as a constitutional entity.
Bundles under consideration at @FloriodaCRC: 1. creating a new constitutional right for victims in same amendment as raising the mandatory retirement age for judges and changing interpretation of law for admin law judges
In defense of the bundling plan he created and proposed @FloridaCRC commissioner @BrechtHeuchan says about the claims of logrolling: 'the whole process is being attacked'
Kids sue @FlGovScott to force Florida to take action on climate change https://t.co/gaGCJvfJky
Lawyer Roberto Martinez argues that the @FloridaCRC bundled constitutional amendments will confuse voters, is 'logrolling' and 'we have undermined the work that we have undertaken to make sure that each of the ballot summaries clearly informs the voters'
Should voters have the ability to decide on 23 separate proposals to change the constitution on the November ballot, or should they be bundled together by the powerful @FloridaCRC even if it leads to voter confusion?

Faced with shifting demographics and a competition to use legislation and regulations for competitive advantage, the pari-mutuel industry is traditionally one of the most reliable contributors to legislative and statewide campaigns in Florida.
Legislators say they worry that when the forbearance agreement ends, the tribe may stop payments to the state — even though the tribe continued payments while it was suing regulators and has given no indication it would want to antagonize the state now.

In her testimony under oath, McLeod referred to her personal journals and text messages that documented her interactions, frustrations and angst about dealing with Latvala. The judge requested copies of that evidence... She allowed that evidence to be reviewed by @MiamiHerald
“Lobbyists and legislators are all tangled up in a whole lot of different ways, whether it is client stuff or sexual stuff,” McLeod said. “Women are sexualized in virtually every arena — particularly where power can be wielded to force and exploit outcomes”
“The fact that it happened also for a short period while I was married represents a weakness of mine which I am currently addressing,” @JackLatvala He denied violating state corruption laws.
Why didn’t Laura McLeod speak out when she was tormented by harassment? Read her story and why she hopes breaking her silence will result in a Tallahassee culture change. https://t.co/Q0fQo3bRWN
"It became a pattern, and nearly every time McLeod went to Latvala's Senate office, 'he went to close the door and he turned around to hug me and then would grope me or touch me inappropriately,' she recalled." via @MiamiHerald @SayfieReview.

@JackLatvala Witness tells Holtzman @JackLatvala made a request that she wear something specific: “I see you have your pearls on, but the request was nothing but.”
@JackLatvala Witness told Holzman that @JackLatvala would ask '“What do I get?” in certain verbal exchanges in connection with her work, but she perceived that the implication was a suggested quid pro quo for	sexual favors based on a steady pattern and constant “hitting on her.”
@JackLatvala Witness told Holtzman 'she is aware of women who were contacted by @JackLatvala's legal counsel to provide sworn statements...	they felt intimidated and threatened to make those statements, that it was impressed upon them...to say that the allegations couldn’t be true'
@JackLatvala Holtzman report on @JackLatvala: 'One witness reported that when she met with Sen. Latvala to conduct business,	he closed the door, gave her a big hug, grabbed her buttocks, kissed her mouth, and	put his hand in the top of her dress, grunted in her ear, and made a sexual comment'
@JackLatvala Fear of retaliation is a theme in Holtzman report: "many witnesses reported that based on their observations of Senator	Latvala and his past actions, providing information critical of Senator Latvala could yield negative	consequences for them and their clients"
Holtzman report on @JackLatvala: Several witnesses reported concerns about retaliation	for speaking to investigators about Sen. Latvala in light of his power, particularly in his recent	role as Chair of the Sen Appropriations Comm with control over an approximately $83	b budget.
Senate independent investigator report is now out: only one of the other 5 accusers in Politico article came forward and she cancelled.

@MacStipanovich @JackLatvala Actually, I believe it's Swanson who is being paid to investigate the only claim there is. Holtzman is being paid to try to get the six unnamed sources to come forward, including the claimant who filed the rules complaint, and any corroborating witnesses. Different tracks.
@MacStipanovich @JackLatvala So why limit the scope of services to allegations made only "by six unnamed individuals who have alleged claims in media reports against Sen Latvala"? What if there are more than 6 or more than Latvala? Does she get paid for investigating that? Do they amend/cancel the contract?
