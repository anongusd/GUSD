President Trump is going to declare a "national emergency" on the southern border. He speaks of violent people pouring into the country threatening to harm us.		But this isn't about violence. 		If this were about violence, he'd have done something about gun violence.

This address wasn't a call for "bipartisan unity." This was Trump doubling down: pro-life, anti-immigration, the whole list. #SOTU

"I promised to tell the truth, people believed me. And I think they were ready for something different." 		The Party elite initially ignored Carter's run for President. But he was successful at relating to the American voter. #HEADLINERS
Jimmy Carter wrote a letter to everyone who lost a Democratic primary in 1974 and said, “I know that you lost, but you ran a really good campaign." 		I know this cause I got one of those letters. And that's how Carter invited others to join his campaign for President. #HEADLINERS
"The time for racial discrimination is over." 		These first words put President Carter on the national political map. #HEADLINERS

The idea that Dr. Blasey Ford is a part of some left wing conspiracy is an insult to her. She has every right to petition Congress. And Congress should listen to people, otherwise why are they there?
If Dr. Blasey Ford doesn't testify, the historic loser will be Donald Trump. Her story will not go away even if, especially if, Kavanaugh is confirmed. Imagine her on 60 Minutes the Sunday before the midterms.

James Comey embodies the FBI as an institution. So does Robert Mueller. And that spirit is going to bring this epoch to its head. https://t.co/F6qrQiXFv2
Fearing a potential “Saturday Night Massacre,” President Bush worked with then Deputy AG Comey on surveillance. It shows Comey’s resolve and sense of principle. #HEADLINERS
James Comey made his bones by standing up against torture. He was a made man before Trump came along. #HEADLINERS
The firing of James Comey may be the most historic act of the Trump Presidency. And also the most self destructive. #HEADLINERS
James Comey outpolls President Trump on credibility. He’ll probably do better after Sunday night. #HEADLINERS https://t.co/NlbjCBqjKi
We’ve got the first half of the Comey double header tonight at 9. Tune in. #HEADLINERS https://t.co/cdMTYnAwW0
Trump’s afraid that Comey’s going to dominate this week’s news. We’ll talk about his life and his book tonight. https://t.co/Y0BWOBrxoD

Trump didn't want anyone to see his taxes. Now, everything he ever wanted fixed, every problem he's ever had, may be available to the FBI from the Cohen raid. It's like lifting up a rock to look at the bug life. Trump must hate that.
We found out what it takes for Republicans to tell the truth about Trump: retirement.

After the #MarchForOurLives, people who care about gun safety have to keep the pressure on Congress. They need to be as focused as the gun rights advocates and the NRA. As David Hogg said, this is just the beginning.
The #MarchForOurLives is great, great for the young people, and great for the country to have its youth so enthusiastic to participate in strengthening the public dialogue.  https://t.co/2bt5hfdieF
We lost a patriot today. Senator Zell Miller and I had a wild exchange at the ’04 GOP convention in NY. We later exchanged letters and he was wonderfully gracious. He deserves respect for his service to the country, the military, and political life.

John Bolton pushed for the war in Iraq, he pushes for war with Iran, and he's the godfather of regime change. This could mean war. 2/

The Parkland shooting victims are the most trusted people in America. https://t.co/55yjYJZnYY
I think it's fascinating that the Florida high school students are calling BS on the NRA and its supporters. It's not about ideology, it's about double talk. The NRA believes guns don't kill people, people kill people. But they're against universal background checks.
Why do Republicans support restrictions on voting but oppose any rules on guns?
.@johnlegend's right about the President's lack of curiosity. Trump starts every day with the same "I got you" music from Groundhog Day. The trouble is we got him. https://t.co/SBkxKE8nt0
Some of Trump's problems begin with his recruitment. Desperate, he took whoever came through the door. A lot of problems come in that way.
With all the chaos in the White House, I still wonder who is in Trump's circle. Kelly's under fire, Kushner still doesn't have security clearance, and two staffers recently resigned.
As long as I've been following politics, there has been one distinctive Republican trait: the the near-religious contempt for deficit spending. With Trump, a Republican controlled Congress passed a $1.5 trillion tax cut and a giant deficit. https://t.co/asOgAZrcrf

General Kelly acted presidential today. He acted like a leader and a father. Maybe he should give Trump some lessons.
And a country that loses its moral direction will face a terrible time finding the patriotic unity that is the heart of national strength. 5
The decision was to blockade the island rather than invade it. It worked. Today, we have a leader who appears to lack a moral compass. 4/

.@KatyTurNBC and .@JoyAnnReid were incredible tonight on Trump's refusal to kill birtherism. #hardball
I think the big story is who clears this up. Does the mayor retract what he said tonight or does Trump retract what he's said for years?
Giuliani on Hardball says .@realDonaldTrump has given up on birtherism. "Donald Trump believes now that he was born in the United States."
Trump looked like he was feeling pressure from Matt. He was reacting almost under duress, whereas Hillary grabbed the ques. and ran w them.
Strong finish by Trump.
So it's not clear if he has his own plan.
Matt's pressing him hard on whether he has a plan himself-or if he is relying on the Generals to come up with one a month after he's elected
Trump's problem is that her performance was near perfect, which makes it very hard to beat.
Trump's coming up in a few mins.  I expect he will point out that Sec. Clinton attacked him 3 times.  He'll make the most of that.
There's the third shot against Trump.
Better intelligence is all you can promise.  You can't promise no terrorist attacks.
Good for her!
Trump is going to say she attacked me, I am going to attack her.  She ignored the rules - I'm going to ignore the rules.
I liked the way HRC took the hit on Iraq and didn't quibble. She says she made a mistake personally.  Strong!

Kasich is running for VP right now! You're hearing it. #GOPDebate
I'm sorry I must have missed that. When did Obama apologize for radical Islamic terrorism? I thought Cruz said he never used that phrase.
I think @realDonaldTrump hit it out of the ballpark. He just forgot to mention the firefighters going up when everyone else was going down.
.@JebBush looks like one of the guys on the bench at an NBA game that ony gets in the game for the final minutes. #GOPDebate
William F. Buckley ran the National Review out of New York City. #GOPDebate
Why are they all so literal about right to bear arms, but don't accept the phrase "natural born citizen?" #GOPDebate
Wait a minute... the second amendment was an amendment.  It wasn't part of the original text.  #GOPDebate
I think Dr. Carson just took a chunk of Iowa votes from Cruz. #GOPDebate
Carson is going to take away votes from Cruz. #GOPDebate
If Kasich isn't on the ticket I'll be shocked. They need Ohio - he gives them Ohio. #GOPDebate
Marco is killing himself here going after Christie. Puts him at the little kids table. He must be running for second place in NH. #GOPDebate
Now we know what "New York values" means to @tedcruz #GOPDebate
Full force and fury? @tedcruz would have gone to war over the ten sailors?  So we'd be at war today against Iran. #GOPDebate

My old boss Pres Carter on @hardball 2nite. Says he won't support US attack on Iran even if it built nuclear weapons. http://t.co/5lxLGSiloW
Basing his case on Boehner–“son of a barkeep” – &amp; his own upbringing by “single mother, “ he offered “opportunity agenda” of  skilled worker
This speech was a masterful pitch for center-left policies wrapped in centrist American language....
Did the President really just say “unclogging our highways” and with mayor of Ft. Lee up in the gallery, a guest of Congressman Pascrell.
That line about America being a better bet for investment world-wide than China got the Republicans off their feet!  #SOTU

Three cheers for fixing the voting system.   Best of luck to Bob Bauer and Ben Ginsberg!
This is a Bill Clinton #SOTU. It’s got a lot of content, strong on detail.
“Rebuild America!”  He’s said the magic words.  JUST DO IT!  #SOTU
Boehner looks determined not to smile.  Is that a deal-breaker for Republican leaders?  Why is his tie happy but he isn’t?
Jobs, jobs, jobs! The President needs to begin a "jobs" campaign tonight. That means a big investment in re-building America.
Looks like Cardinal Scola of Milan has inside track on the next Pope. If this were a betting situation, I'd go with the man from Milan.

I'll be up on the stage tonight at the #alsmithdinner within handshaking distance of both Romney and Obama.  Love the tradition!
Just finished @hardball. The President has 20 days to sell his economic future for the country.
Romney keeps ignoring what Obama inherited.  He keeps going back to January  '09 with all of his numbers.  #debate
Obama won big on W policies and equal treatment for women and on taxes before that.  He is way ahead.  #debates
Romney is doing to Candy Crowley what he did to Jim Lehrer #debate
First round - auto industry bailout - goes to Obama. #debates
Two words for President Obama: women power.  #msnbc2012 #hofdebate
Obama killing Romney on Medicare. Best line: "If you're 54 or 55, pay attention." #debates
Two more tips for tonight: any self-deprecation will work; and salute both wives.
The rules tonight are table stakes. Don’t be caught reciting some pre-fab line. It's what made Scott Brown look bad this week.
It's clear that a lot of good people watch @billmaher. The show's great - he's just as good in person. I love free speech.

Final call: Big Win for Romney. Bad night, another, for Perry.
Romney has passion and spontaneity tonight. It was his night. Perry is 0 and 3.
Romney can talk on a stage as can Huntsman. Perry and Bachman are robotic.
A real debate there between Santorum and Huntsman over Afghanistan -  an important one.
Perry is dying. He can't answer real questions on foreign policy.
Bachmann to build a fence across southern border. Who would pay for it? She said tonight people should keep all their money.
#Romney comes alive and refuses to be boxed in to calling #Obama names.
The robot is speaking again. It calls itself "we" when defending itself.
#Bachmann said people should keep all their money and not pay taxes. Who should pay her congressional salary?
#Obama has rung the bell.  The campaign’s on.  He’s asking the American people to say they want a fair tax burden.  Gutsy move.

95 bridges in Boehner's district are "structurally deficient." Obama should visit one Tuesday to make the point there's work to be done.
JFK would say his prayers kneeling at his bedside. Squares with my book on Jack coming out Nov 1.
Jackie tapes on JFK's religious devotions:"He never missed church one Sunday that we were married. He wanted to have that on his side."
So great to be in PA to salute the Flgt 93 heroes who defied the boxcutters and hate of the terrorists and kept that plane from Washington.
In Shanksville, PA, Bill Clinton and Speaker Boehner agreed to help raise 10 million dollars to fund Flight 93 memorial. #flight93

I sense we're hearing the first refrain of "Give 'em hell, Barry."
"Structurally deficient" - by the way - is what that Minnesota bridge was before it collapsed.
There are now more than 90 bridges that are "structurally deficient" in Speaker Boehner's district. Is that why he looks to be in pain?
Time to name the below-code bridges in Boehner's district! And Cantor's! Hit him now! Name the dangerous bridges in their districts! Now!!!

Big result of last night: with Bachmann falling and Romney denying membership, Perry is the Tea Party nominee. #reagandebate
Romney did well enough for No. 2.  No changes in order of support after tonight.  #reagandebate
Perry on top by open to media attack on "Ponzi scheme" description of Social Security and his refusal to accept manmade climate-change.
Bottom line: The standing of the candidates was unaffected by tonight's performances.  #reagandebate
Perry looks unsteady trying to question climate change.  He's an oil patch politician saying what they must.  He's not solid and shows it.
Good for Huntsman, standing up for science and against the ludites.  #reagandebate
Have these people forgotten that this country is at war in 2 countries? Are they walking away from wars like they did from financial crisis?
Romney is dead right. Illegal hiring is the key reason for illegal immigration.  But business won't stop.  It pays. Cheap labor pays.
Perry said Obama might be an "abject liar" on issue of southern border defense. This langauge is good for the hall, maybe not the country.
Finally Newt speaks well. He's right on charter schools, especially inner cities like Philadelphia.  A broken clock is right twice a debate!
What neo-con came up with the word "homeland?  What was wrong with saying "defending America," of good old civil defense? #reagandebate
The Gyro Gearlooses have taken over the debate - all this jabber about the TSA and Homeland Security will not decide who leads America.
This is becoming a two-ring circus: the anchormen - Perry, Romney and Huntsman in one ring, the Gyro Gearlooses in the other.
Perry's got the headline - for better or worse. "Ponzi scheme" leads the NYT banner tomorrow AM!  #reagandebate
Perry just called the current Social Security System a "Ponzi scheme," a "monstrous lie."  This will be a headline. He's now Paul Ryan.
I give the first half hour to Perry.  He combined calm confidence and easy repartee with the red meat this crowd eats up.  #reagandebate
Huntsman made a good point: President Obama should get out from behind his teleprompter and tell us where he wants this country to go.
Romney's problem is that he's a businessman trying to be a "career politician." He's been running for office since 1994.  #reagandebate
Perry just pulled a smart one, quoting JFK.  Republicans who do that - Ronald Reagan - Scott Brown - tend to win.  #reagandebate
Say what you will, Santorum believes what he says. He's not here to play games like Newt.  #reagandebate
Newt just attacked the media for getting Republicans to fight with each other. He's attacking the moderators for running a debate!!!
Perry just scored on Romney by tying Mitt's healthcare plan to Obama's. He's now giving the strong red meat argument the right loves.
Romney just made a good case for the individual mandate.  He should be selling Obamacare.  #reagandebate
Leave it to Newt Gingrich to throw the first bombs about "class warfare" and "bureacratic socialism." It's what he does. #reagandebate
Debate looks like audition for Anchorman. Lots of clever ad libs. No passion. #reagandebate
Bobby Kennedy's final advice to Jack before Nixon debate: "kick him in the balls." Who'll do it tonight?
