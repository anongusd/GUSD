@tomwatson Untrue. I blockwalked for Beto. I would still blockwalk for his senate race. He is not free from criticism - no one that friendly to corporations is. 	The left across the US embraced him, warily, for a chance at turning Texas. He needs to show up.

To all parents across the nation who have lost their children to gun violence of different forms - feel our embrace. And our willingness and conviction to change our tomorrow.
Or, more aptly put, how far do we have to go to visibly shrink the window of factors that allowed this to happen?

Last year, Austin got rid of this ordinance. It is time for Dallas to do the same this year. 		A group of coalitions has come together to make this happen, all with different perspectives but one goal: to end this youth stop-and-frisk
In addition to the child, parents and business owners risk being fined as well if they allow kids to remain outdoor/ at public premises “after hours”
Black and Latino kids make up 88% of the offenses although black people and Latinos make up 65% of the Dallas city population
Just recently heard a story about a teacher whose student had to quit their after school job because of this curfew. The kid got off late and risked getting a fine for being outside after WORKING!
The curfew targets kids of color with either a $500 fine or the option to do community service.  Let’s be clear that the option to do community service still requires resources		- transportation 	- time	parents could but might need to arrange around work and hire child care
Did you know that Dallas still has a DFW curfew ordinance for minors? 		This curfew overwhelmingly targets kids of color - 90% 		The Curfew makes it a Class C misdemeanor for young people between the ages of 10 and 16 years old to be out of home or school during curfew hours. https://t.co/ImAd81Jw9p
