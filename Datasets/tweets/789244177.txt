@TheChappedHide The private sector is also automating but people out of work as well

@TheChappedHide Many coal plant are moving to automation - regulations aren't forcing them to
@TheChappedHide And modernization has hindered coal
@TheChappedHide Also have you considered that technological advances &amp; automation are replacing workforce demands in that industry?
@TheChappedHide I'm sure you know that coal has been on a sharp decline since the early 2000s.  Natural gas has proven to be a cheaper alternative
@TheChappedHide @RepCurbelo @WaysandMeansGOP What jobs have those regulations killed specifically?
