Another missed paycheck for 800,000 federal employees today. The workers I’ve been talking to say bills are piling up and stress is mounting as they try to make ends meet. We need the President to reopen the government while we negotiate a bipartisan border security deal.
I expect that we will learn more about Mr. Stone’s campaign role, his communications regarding Wikileaks, and who else knew about Stone’s efforts. It remains essential that the Special Counsel be permitted to finish this work without any political interference.
It appears Mr. Stone also lied to Congress and tampered with witnesses in order to obstruct these investigations into the Trump campaign – yet another example of senior Trump officials concealing the truth about their Russia-related contacts during the 2016 election.
And, he publicly claimed on several occasions to remain in regular contact with then-candidate Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race, even after he formally departed the Trump campaign.
Roger Stone and Donald Trump have known each other for nearly forty years. Mr. Stone played a key role in recruiting Paul Manafort to run the Trump campaign.
Roger Stone has been indicted for covering up his engagements with Wikileaks, which U.S. intelligence officials and the Senate Intel Committee have publicly designated as a hostile intelligence service, regarding the public release of emails stolen by the Russian government.

This is a waste of these people’s talents. It is an insult to their service to the country. And it is not how people should be treated by their government.
These Virginians came from all across the federal government — safety inspectors, lawyers, a DHS employee unable to work on actual border security improvements, and even someone who had to leave work supporting efforts in Iraq on his desk because he was furloughed.

Every time we wait until the last possible moment to resolve the issue of government funding, we waste time and taxpayer money as agencies are forced to plan for a shutdown. With the New Year approaching, the White House and Congress should resolve to stop doing this in 2019.
Although I voted in favor of the continuing resolution, I remain disappointed with the short-sighted budgetary dysfunction that leaves federal agencies operating on one stop-gap measure after another, unable to function on any long-term basis.
This will ensure that federal workers across Virginia continue to receive their paychecks through the holidays, while allowing the White House time to decide whether it truly wants to go all-in on an outdated, ineffective approach to the challenge of improving border security.

.@SenAlexander has spent his career approaching our nation's challenges not as partisan battles, but rather as problems to be solved by whoever would work with him, Republican or Democrat. That's an increasingly rare trait, and his retirement is a tremendous loss for the Senate.
That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media.  I hope these reports will spur legislative action in the Congress and provide additional clarity to the American public about Russia’s assault on our democracy.
Bottom line: these attacks against our country were much more comprehensive, calculating and widespread than previously revealed. This should stand as a wakeup call to us all that none of us are immune from this threat, and it is time to get serious in addressing this challenge.
The truth is, Russia attempted to use our greatest strengths — our open society, freedom of expression, and cultural and political diversity — as weapons to undermine the stability of our society and democracy.
As one report puts it, “The IRA created an expansive cross-platform media mirage targeting the Black community, which shared and cross-promoted authentic Black media to create an immersive influence ecosystem.”
But no group was targeted more extensively by Russia than black Americans — both to exploit issues related to police violence and the Black Lives Matter movement AND to suppress the black vote ahead of the 2016 election.
Communities targeted by Russia include: Christians, Muslims, gun enthusiasts, Native Americans, law enforcement, LGBTQ Americans, liberals, conservatives, veterans, feminists, and Bernie Sanders supporters, among others.
We see this in the fact that Russian information operations went far beyond partisan politics, exploiting deeper divisions in American society.
There is no doubt that Russia favored Trump over Clinton in 2016, but politics is only part of the picture. Putin is not a Republican or a Democrat. The ultimate goal here was to undermine Americans’ trust in our democratic institutions.
Not only were they posting pro-Kremlin content and leveraging it with online ads to influence our political discourse; they were also specifically trying to recruit Americans as unwitting Russian intelligence assets through these efforts.
The IRA continued its efforts well into 2017, when these accounts were finally shut down. In fact, they actually accelerated their efforts on Instagram after the election.
Russia’s reach was widespread. The Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency reached 126 million Americans on Facebook, and 20 million via Instagram. They were active on other platforms including Twitter, YouTube, Google+, Tumblr, Pinterest, and PayPal.
Incredible. These bombshell reports demonstrate just how far Russia went to exploit the fault lines of our society and divide Americans, in an attempt to undermine and manipulate our democracy. Here's what we’ve learned:	https://t.co/GTfDX4roLP

In filling that void and in light of the actions by the Saudis both in Yemen and in Jamal Khashoggi’s murder, the Senate must send a message that America’s moral voice will not be diminished.
Unfortunately, at a moment in which it is most needed, the Trump Administration has abdicated America’s moral leadership.
Saudi Arabia remains an important partner in confronting shared threats like al-Qaeda &amp; ISIL and in countering Iran, and we will continue to work on shared security interests, but we should be clear that we will not provide unconditional assistance to their operations in Yemen.
Despite stated commitments by the Saudis to improve the targeting of their air strikes, scores of innocent civilians continue to be killed by careless bombings, and deep lasting progress towards a negotiated end to the violence has remained elusive.
As the years-long conflict drags on, the people of Yemen are suffering one of the most devastating humanitarian crises in the world.

I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation that finally puts an end to a ban that has held back our farmers from participating in the emerging industrial hemp market, an industry that will help bring new business to Virginia and create new jobs.
And, after decades of waiting, states will be allowed to choose the best way to regulate production of industrial hemp.
There are some significant victories for Virginia in this legislation, including measures to expand successful Chesapeake Bay clean-up efforts, protect Virginia commodities like dairy and cotton, and maintain funding for a nutrition assistance program that families depend on.

This is a reminder that we need to take seriously the risks of doing business with companies like Huawei and allowing them access to our markets. I continue to strongly urge our close ally Canada to reconsider Huawei’s inclusion in any aspect of its 5G infrastructure.
It's my hope that the Trump Administration will hold Huawei fully accountable for breaking sanctions law, as it failed to do in the case of ZTE.
It has been clear for some time that Huawei, like ZTE, poses a threat to our national security. Now we know that Huawei, like ZTE, has violated U.S. sanctions law.
There is ample evidence to suggest that no major Chinese company is independent of the Chinese government and Communist Party – and Huawei, which China’s government and military tout as a ‘national champion,’ is no exception. https://t.co/fcoGibM9tO

There are serious questions about whether the current enforcement model is up to the task of consumer protection in this space. It’s clear that Congress needs to step in.
In fact, that's exactly what I told @Jack and @SherylSandberg at our hearing last month. Had Google decided to show up, the company would have had a seat at the table for that important conversation.
Rather than keeping the public and Congress in the dark about issues like this, Google should work with Congress to develop some smart, reasonable guardrails that protect Americans and their data.
I was frustrated that Google refused to send senior executives to testify before the Intel Committee last month, but to learn that the company was sitting on news of a potential breach affecting hundreds of thousands of users at the time is pretty outrageous.
This is a big deal. Google's cover-up of its privacy breach is the company's latest attempt to evade scrutiny – both of its business practices and its treatment of user data. https://t.co/Bw120W12jE

The President shouldn’t be declassifying documents in order to undermine an investigation into his campaign or pursue vendettas against political enemies. He especially shouldn’t be releasing documents with the potential to reveal intelligence sources.
The Judiciary Committee simply cannot vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination this Thursday. There should be a full investigation, and Professor Ford deserves to be heard. This is a serious allegation, and we have a responsibility to listen.
Any attempt by the President to pardon Mr. Manafort or otherwise interfere in this investigation would be a gross abuse of power and require immediate action by Congress.
The guilty plea also underscores the seriousness of this investigation. The Special Counsel must be permitted to follow the facts wherever and however high they might lead, because in the United States of America no one is above the law.
Today’s admission of criminal guilt by Paul Manafort clearly demonstrates that the President’s 2016 campaign manager conducted illegal activity in conspiracy with Russian-backed entities and was beholden to Kremlin-linked officials.

While the Administration has yet to share the full text, an executive order that inevitably leaves the President broad discretion to decide whether to impose tough sanctions against those who attack our democracy is insufficient.
Unfortunately, President Trump demonstrated in Helsinki and elsewhere that he simply cannot be counted upon to stand up to Putin when it matters.
In order to deter foreign interference in future elections, we must make it clear to Russia and other adversaries that interference is unacceptable, and will have painful consequences.
If we are going to actually deter Russia and others from interfering in our elections in the future, we need to spell out strong, clear consequences, without ambiguity.
We remain woefully underprepared to secure the upcoming elections, and an executive order is simply no substitute for congressional action, such as the strong measures included in the bipartisan DETER Act. https://t.co/1SWkPLDMXf
Update: President Trump just signed a federal emergency declaration for Virginia. https://t.co/9Meuk58TqK
In this country, no one, not even the President, is above the law. Should the President's legal team decide, as they have threatened, to contest that principle in court, it is imperative that the Supreme Court ensures that the President is held accountable.
But in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Kavanaugh refused to say whether he thinks it is constitutional for presidents to be investigated, and whether he continues to believe that the President has the power to fire a prosecutor criminally investigating him.
We currently have a president whose conduct is at the center of a federal criminal investigation.
I am also deeply troubled by Judge Kavanaugh's views on executive power.
His past rulings, writings and evasive answers before the Judiciary Committee lead to the inescapable conclusion that, as a Supreme Court justice, Kavanaugh would seek to undermine and eventually overturn Roe v. Wade, and would fail to protect people with pre-existing conditions.
But what we have seen provides reason enough to vote against this nominee.
Thanks to unprecedented efforts by the Trump Administration to conceal large portions of Judge Kavanaugh's record and his unwillingness to answer basic questions before the Judiciary Committee, much of his record and judicial philosophy remain a mystery to the American people.
This is the most consequential Supreme Court vacancy in a generation, yet it has been the least transparent confirmation process in recent history.
I would have liked to meet with Judge Kavanaugh personally before deciding how I'd vote. Even attempted to set up a meeting with him, though unfortunately the White House never responded. So I’m just going to say it.	 	I’ll be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh. Here’s why:
Today is a somber day to remember those killed on 9/11 and the bravery of the first responders who ran towards the towers and into the Pentagon that day. Americans came together following the attack in a remarkable way, and I hope we won't lose sight of that either. #NeverForget

I still have significant questions about how high that information went, and I know the Senate Intelligence Committee would like to hear directly from Mr. Papadopoulos.
He also had access to, and communications with, the campaign’s top leaders. That’s not conjecture – that is according to Mr. Papadopoulos himself.
As an influential foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, Mr. Papadopoulos was informed that Russia had ‘dirt’ on Hillary Clinton in the form of ‘thousands of emails’ at a critical time during the campaign.

The bad news, I’m afraid, is that there is a lot of work still to do.
We have also seen important action by Facebook and Twitter to make political advertising more transparent by complying with the terms @AmyKlobuchar, John McCain, and I put forward in the #HonestAds Act.
The social media companies have identified and removed *some* of the bad actors on their platforms.
In the time since, each of the social media companies has come a long way towards recognizing the threat.
It took the pressure that was brought to bear by the Intelligence Committee to get Facebook, Twitter, and Google to uncover the malicious activities of the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency on their platforms.
Even after the election, the social media companies were reluctant to admit there even was a problem.
Both Facebook and Twitter failed to anticipate how their platforms could be manipulated and misused. Like the federal government, they were caught flat-footed by the brazen attacks on our election by Russian-backed operatives.
It would be a serious understatement to say that much has changed in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. campaign. With the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that serious mistakes were made by each of the social media companies – as they were by the entire U.S. government.

Given its size and influence, I would have thought the leadership at Google would want to demonstrate how seriously it takes these challenges and to lead this important public discussion.
From Google Search, which continues to have problems surfacing absurd conspiracies, to YouTube, where Russian-backed disinformation agents promoted hundreds of divisive videos, to Gmail, where state-sponsored foreign intel operatives attempt countless hacking attempts...
As Senate Intel kicks off its social media hearing today, I’m deeply disappointed that @Google chose not to send its top corporate leadership. Our members have tough questions about structural vulnerabilities on a number of Google’s platforms that we need answered.
And you can tune in to today’s hearing starting at 9:30 AM: https://t.co/IwmwoX1xpC
I’ve put these and other ideas into a white paper that I’ve circulated to get this discussion going. You can read the whole thing here:	https://t.co/YkV2hbS9gc
After witnessing numerous episodes of misuse, what further accountability should there be with respect to the flawed advertising model that you utilize?
Why shouldn’t we adopt ideas like data portability, data minimization, or first party consent?
Why are your terms of service so difficult to find and nearly impossible to read, much less understand?
Isn’t there a public interest in ensuring more anonymized data is available to researchers and academics to help identify potential problems and misuse?
Don’t your users have a right to know when they are interacting with bots on your platform?
I’ve put out a series of ideas to start this long-overdue national conversation about privacy, data and social media, and I’m hoping to hear some constructive thoughts from these tech leaders this morning. For example:
Today’s hearing is not about “gotcha” questions or scoring political points. Our goal is to begin to tackle the challenges posed by foreign adversaries and other bad actors who are abusing these platforms to undermine our democracy and harm American consumers.
This morning the Senate Intelligence Committee will hear from @Jack and @SherylSandberg about their companies’ responses to foreign influence operations on social media platforms. Here’s what’s on my mind:
I would very much like to hear @Google’s answer on this, and I don’t think I’m the only one. https://t.co/Tja5kb15us

Congress can and must stand up to the President and reject this assault on our federal workers by passing the 1.9 percent pay raise that the Senate approved on August 1.
I can think of nothing more hypocritical or disingenuous than to turn around and throw hardworking federal employees under the bus on the pretext of fiscal responsibility.
Instead, the President ballooned the deficit by trillions of dollars with a tax giveaway primarily benefitting big business and the wealthiest Americans.
But let’s be honest: the President and his party, which controls both houses of Congress, have had every chance over the last 18 months to get serious about tackling our fiscal challenges.
I’ve worked for years in the Senate to reduce duplicative and wasteful spending, and make government more efficient. If President Trump seriously wants to make that a priority, then I’d be happy to work with the White House on that effort.
Let’s be clear: this is not motivated by a sudden onset of fiscal responsibility. This has nothing to do with making government more cost-efficient. It’s just the latest attack in the Trump Administration’s war on federal employees. https://t.co/y6vQS0P8MN

Any attempt by the President to pardon Mr. Manafort or interfere in the investigation into his campaign would be a gross abuse of power and require immediate action by Congress.
The President’s campaign manager was just convicted of serious federal crimes by a jury of his peers, despite the President’s continued attempts to undermine the investigation which has brought Mr. Manafort to justice.
Today’s guilty verdict makes it absolutely clear that the Mueller probe is a serious investigation that is rooting out corruption and Russian influence on our political system at the highest levels.

It’s time for the President to show some respect — for Mr. Mueller, for the rule of law, and for the good of the country.
That’s the man the President is attacking, and for no reason but that Bob Mueller has been tasked with investigating Russia’s attack against our democracy, an investigation which has already produced 35 indictments and five guilty pleas.
That was the *beginning* of Bob Mueller’s career in public service. He spent the majority of his adult life prosecuting murderers, drug smugglers, and terrorists before President Bush appointed him Director of the FBI.
A couple months later, Mr. Mueller took an AK-47 round through the leg, earning a Purple Heart. He was back on patrol a month later.
"…and, on one occasion, personally led a fire team across the fire-swept area terrain to recover a mortally wounded Marine who had fallen in a position forward on the friendly lines.”
“Second Lieutenant Mueller fearlessly moved from one position to another with complete disregard for his own safety, he then skillfully supervised the evacuation of casualties from the hazardous area…”
You’ll never hear Mueller talk or tweet about this, but the author @Vermontgmg managed to dig up the citation for Mr. Mueller’s Bronze Star with Valor that he earned in Vietnam for “courage, aggressive initiative, and unwavering devotion to duty.” It reads:
Bob Mueller is a lifelong public servant, a Purple-Heart-decorated Marine veteran, and the man who led the FBI with distinction in the years following 9/11. No unhinged tweet can tarnish that record of service to our country. https://t.co/63Z8sCThd0

These same tools that spread misinformation can negatively affect other aspects of our lives.  I think we need to start pushing ourselves beyond just recognizing the problem and start to push actual policy ideas forward.
Today we focused on what happened in 2016 and what is happening now, but Russian active measures have revealed a dark underbelly of the social media ecosystem.
That’s why we will be hosting senior executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Google for a hearing on September 5th.  To hear the plans they have in place, to press them to do more, and to work together to address this challenge.
I’ve been hard on them because I know they can do better to protect our democracy. They have the creativity, expertise, resources, and technological capability to get ahead of these malicious actors.
Before I went into public service, I spent more than 20 years in the tech business. I have tremendous respect for these companies and what they represent. When they are at their best, they are a symbol of what this country does best: innovation, job creation, changing the world.
But all the evidence the Senate Intelligence Committee has seen to date suggests that the platform companies – namely, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google, and YouTube – still have a lot of work to do.
I’m also concerned that the U.S. government is not well positioned to detect, track, or counter these types of influence operations on social media.
Today, it is becoming clearer that activity represents just a small fraction of the total Russian effort on social media.
Much of the initial focus was on paid advertisements. But it quickly became clear that ads represented a tiny percentage of IRA activity – compared to the hundreds of thousands of free Facebook and Instagram posts, pages &amp; groups, and millions of tweets from IRA-backed accounts.
Russian active measures on social media have two things in common: They are effective. And they are cheap. For just pennies on the dollar, they can wreak havoc in our society and in our elections.
That’s the good news. The bad news is that we have a lot more work to do.
We have helped reveal the Russian playbook. We have raised public awareness regarding the threat. And we’ve succeeded, however incrementally, in pressuring the social media companies to take steps to address the problems on their platforms.
These revelations eventually resulted in the indictments of 13 Russian individuals and 3 Russian companies by the Special Counsel’s office in February 2018.
It was pressure brought to bear by the Intel Committee that led Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to uncover malicious activity by the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency.
Our Committee has invested a significant amount of time, focus and energy – both in public and behind closed doors – in uncovering and exposing Russian information warfare in our own backyard.
This morning, the Senate Intel committee heard from top experts on social media manipulation and foreign influence operations like the one we saw during the 2016 election.

I plan to carefully examine Judge Kavanaugh's record and judicial philosophy. I cannot and will not support a nominee who would take this country backwards by undermining our fundamental rights and American values.
That simple fact, and that this nominee comes from a list put together by ultra-conservative groups who do not support these core values, give me grave concerns that Judge Kavanaugh is not the right pick to serve on our nation’s highest court.
Time and time again, President Trump has said that he will only nominate candidates who will vote to undermine those rights and who will work to overturn Roe v. Wade.
The stakes are made that much higher by an Administration that routinely violates longstanding norms and pushes ethical boundaries past the breaking point. We need a Supreme Court that can act as a check on the executive branch now more than ever.
The next Supreme Court justice will determine whether we are a country that lives by our values when it comes to voting rights, women’s rights, workers' rights, and the rights of LGBT Americans.
The next Supreme Court justice will determine whether women will maintain their constitutional right to reproductive health care and whether we will continue to protect people with pre-existing conditions from discrimination.
There is much at stake with President Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to fill the vacancy created by Justice Kennedy’s retirement.

Happy Fourth of July!
Russia will be back in 2018. We need to be ready.
While our investigation remains ongoing, we have to learn from the 2016 election so we can be ready for future interference attempts by Russia and other foreign adversaries in future elections.
Evidence and intel we have seen since the ICA was written further supports those findings and tells us that the Russians aren’t going to stop.
Bottom line: the overall judgments issued in the ICA were well-supported and the tradecraft was strong.
We found that the ICA assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered this influence campaign to destabilize our democratic institutions is well supported.
After 16 months of reviewing the intelligence that went into this report, we have found that the ICA’s finding — that Russia interfered in the election to help Trump and to hurt Clinton — is well supported.
Today Senate Intel released the unclassified summary of ​our findings on the ICA report into Russia's Interference in the 2016 election. Read it here: https://t.co/qcFQAAKjHz

I am grateful to Justice Kennedy for his many decades of service to our country, and wish him all the best in his retirement.
In just four months, the American people will determine the makeup of the United States Senate. Given the precedent set by Leader McConnell in 2016, it is only appropriate that the Senate wait until the new Congress is seated to consider any nomination to the Supreme Court.

After visiting one of the ‘better’ detention facilities, all I can say is we need a lot more compassion for these kids. We need to reunite these families now, then come back to the negotiating table and work on real, bipartisan immigration reform so this can never happen again.
We’ve heard a lot of denials, a lot of counterattacks and blame shifting from this Administration, but we haven’t heard a lot by way of compassion for these children.
What this facility cannot do is reunite them with their parents. That’s the responsibility of the Trump Administration, which created this mess.
But no matter how well they’re being treated by the staff, the fact remains that they’re being held in detention, separated from their parents, because of this Administration. Housing them in the Ritz wouldn’t make that better.
I’ve known this facility for a long time, I’ve visited before, and according to the kids I spoke to, they’re being treated well there.

It’s important to remember today that President Trump has already said, on camera, why he fired James Comey – to stop the Russia investigation. No claims the Administration might make will change that fact.
The President will surely attempt to use this to discredit the ongoing criminal investigation into his campaign, so let’s be clear: this report has absolutely nothing to do with the Mueller investigation, which must be allowed to conclude without interference from the President.
The release of this Inspector General report confirms what has been clear for some time: though FBI leadership made errors in judgment in the run-up to the election, those actions were not influenced by any political bias and, if anything, helped Donald Trump’s candidacy.

If there is a clear and compelling need to brief Congress on sensitive intelligence matters, it should be handled through the Gang of Eight.
The Gang of Eight exists in custom and in law to ensure that Congress can oversee intelligence matters without putting sensitive sources and methods at risk.
They will also be sending a terrible message to anyone who works in or with our nation’s intelligence community that the White House will always prioritize partisan politics over protecting the people who help keep this country safe.
If they insist upon carrying out this farce, the White House and its Republican allies in the House will do permanent, longstanding damage to the practice of bipartisan congressional oversight of intelligence.
The White House’s plan to provide a separate briefing for their political allies demonstrates that their interest is not in informing Congress, but in undermining an ongoing criminal investigation.

Anyone who is entrusted with our nation’s highest secrets should act with the gravity and seriousness of purpose that knowledge deserves.
It would be at best irresponsible, and at worst potentially illegal, for members of Congress to use their positions to learn the identity of an FBI source for the purpose of undermining the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our election.
Publicly outing a source risks not only their life, but the lives of every American, because when sources are burned it makes it that much harder for every part of the intelligence community to gather intelligence on those who wish to do us harm.

My statement on the nomination of Gina Haspel to be CIA Director: https://t.co/eEgyBXC1tW
Here’s the point: we should be investing in our nation’s cyber defense, not rolling it back.  We also need to articulate a clear cyber doctrine. I don’t see how getting rid of the top cyber official in the White House does anything to make our country safer from cyber threats.
That’s just a snapshot of the threat we face from state actors. We can’t forget about the threat from non-state cybercriminals. The Administration’s own economists estimate cybercrime cost the U.S. economy between $57-$109 BILLION in 2016 alone. https://t.co/i9YgVLwrrB
Not to mention the Russian threat to our state and local election systems — in 2016, Russia targeted at least 18 state election systems, and although no votes were changed, in some cases they were able to access restricted elements of our election systems. https://t.co/6zkIZnfpQ7

The President should continue to engage in the important diplomatic work we witnessed this week. We’ve been told that “America first is not America alone.” I hope President Trump will do what it takes to live up to that mission.
This week’s visit from President Macron also highlights the importance of our alliances with countries who share our values. It’s a reminder that building, strengthening, and preserving these alliances takes work.
The truth is, there are people who want to use technology to drive us apart. We must resist this.
And it means all of us, as consumers of information, must treat the information we see on the internet and social media with a healthy dose of skepticism.
It also means tech companies need to embrace their civic responsibility as American companies and tackle these challenges head-on.
That means working with France and our other Western allies to confront Russian cyber aggression. This, by the way, will require the President to recognize Russia’s attack against us in the 2016 election and lead a government-wide response to this ongoing threat.
It’s on all of us, from the US and our allies to tech companies and consumers, to work together and make sure the internet continues to be a force for good, not a safe harbor for our adversaries and other bad actors.

I hope the Administration will take another look at my bill with @SenRobPortman, the National Park Service Legacy Act, because it really begins to solve this $11.6 billion problem.
The point here is we need a bipartisan solution that doesn’t just put a band-aid on the problem. If we want to preserve the beauty and history of our national parks for future generations, we need to work together to fully fund the National Park Service’s maintenance backlog.
That doesn't mean new taxes or new drilling, just spending our money more wisely and solving the problem.
I introduced a bill last year with @SenRobPortman that has a straightforward solution: use existing money already collected by the federal government from oil and natural gas revenues to fix our parks.
Here’s a better idea:
tl;dr – Tying funding for national parks maintenance to unrealistic projections about the price of oil doesn’t solve much of anything in the long run. Frankly, it puts us right back where we started.
The Administration has started to come around to the idea of using existing revenue to fix this problem. Unfortunately, they’ve landed on an idea, supported by some Democrats, that isn’t sustainable in the long term.	https://t.co/noz8wIkjT3
First, the Trump Administration proposed hiking fees on our national parks, sticking families with the costs of Congress’ mismanagement. No one liked that idea, prompting the #HikeTrailsNotFees backlash and forcing the administration to reconsider its position.
Most people agree that something must be done to address our national parks maintenance backlog. The problem, as usual, is how you pay for it.
Virginia ranks 5th in terms of states with the greatest need for maintenance. Over $800 million in deferred maintenance has left Shenandoah, Jamestown, Fredericksburg, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and other national parks in need of significant repairs.
Unfortunately, years of underfunding has produced a massive $11.6 billion (with a B) maintenance backlog at our national parks. Many are in a critical state of disrepair. https://t.co/FDguODrCgN

On Russia: In his prepared testimony, Mr. #Zuckerberg highlights that Facebook pulled down 30,000 accounts in the lead up to the 2017 French election, yet it has only taken down 470 accounts related to the U.S. election.

In Facebook’s view of its responsibility, Mr. #Zuckerberg says that Facebook has not taken a broad enough view of its responsibility but doesn’t define that responsibility.

With the midterm elections fast approaching, the Administration needs to step it up, now, if we have any hope of deterring Russian meddling in 2018.
Yet these sanctions do not go far enough. Nearly all of the entities and individuals who were sanctioned today were either previously under sanction during the Obama Administration, or had already been charged with federal crimes by the Special Counsel.
This is a welcome, if long-overdue, step by the Trump Administration to punish Russia for interfering in the 2016 election. Our nation’s top intelligence officials have testified that Russia continues to interfere in our democracy, with no intention to stop. https://t.co/ToSdx2v16K

The House of Representatives should move swiftly to take up and pass this sensible, bipartisan bill.
While this bill does not include everything Democrats wanted nor everything Republicans wanted, I’m proud of my colleagues for putting differences aside, finding common ground, and passing this bipartisan legislation.
This bill is the result of years of tough negotiations between Democrats and Republicans and will help small lenders provide mortgages and other credit to hardworking Virginians and small businesses.
It will roll back unnecessary and burdensome regulations on credit unions and small community banks while ensuring that larger banks remain subject to the rules I helped put in place after the financial crisis.
The bipartisan bill we passed today will provide meaningful #Relief4MainStreet. https://t.co/yBI4KwY4XB
We need bipartisan legislation like the #HonestAds Act to bring true parity between digital political ads and ads running on broadcast, satellite, and cable services.
While no one law alone will completely protect our democracy, updating our election laws is a simple and important start.
Congress must recognize that our current laws are simply not adequate to deal with the national security threats we face from foreign adversaries like Russia and other bad actors.
The FEC's plan, with yet another round of comments, means rules concerning online political ads remain woefully behind the commonsense standards we apply to political ads on TV &amp; other media – just as we're beginning the primary season for the upcoming mid-terms.
While I applaud the FEC for moving forward today, my hope was that the simple and overdue act of strengthening these disclaimer rules would have been completed by now. https://t.co/i2xW28KmzZ

The Administration must go into any meeting with a plan to ensure that negotiations with Kim Jong-un produce real results, not a photo op that lends legitimacy to North Korea’s murderous regime.
President Trump’s record of cozying up to authoritarian governments, his consistent failure to appoint, empower or value the expertise of professional diplomats, and his overall lack of focus on critical details also give me pause.
I am deeply concerned that the White House has not laid the necessary diplomatic groundwork and coordination for direct talks with North Korea. Even President Trump’s own Secretary of State appeared to be taken aback by this announcement.
Diplomacy is the right path forward to deal with North Korea. At the same time, due to Pyongyang’s history of obfuscation and international defiance, the United States must proceed with caution.

When I say this bill is about #Relief4MainStreet, I mean it. The sponsors of this legislation have worked hard to make sure this bill stays focused on the community banks, credit unions, and regional banks. https://t.co/r1LGpL8kAL
If you’re concerned about rural banks closing up or consolidating into bigger banks, you should support this bill.
So if you’re concerned about consolidation in the banking sector and the threat that poses to the stability of our financial system, you should support this bill.
As Fed Chair Jay Powell testified recently, these changes will not undermine the Fed’s authority to regulate regional banks, and the Fed will continue to provide strong oversight of these institutions. https://t.co/8hf1bsliOz
The bill also tailors the rules affecting mid-sized community banks, but those who would characterize this as a giveaway to Wall Street are simply wrong. Here’s why this is important: https://t.co/RZ6OkQAIBd
This bill is targeted towards small community banks and credit unions. They’re the ones who do the majority of small business &amp; agricultural lending, and this is going to make a huge difference for rural Virginia. https://t.co/mbnfSl0LOX

Now that the Nunes memo has been thoroughly debunked, the White House and its allies in Congress must put a stop to the dangerous partisan sideshows that jeopardize classified sources and methods...
This memo makes clear that there is no reasonable basis to suggest otherwise, except to undermine the Special Counsel’s investigation.
Americans deserve an accurate picture of the actions taken by the FBI, which were fully appropriate and entirely lawful.
It is deeply unfortunate that House Republicans decided to release classified information in order to mislead the American people for partisan political purposes.

Just yesterday a new poll showed two-thirds of Americans wants stronger gun safety laws – the highest level ever recorded by Quinnipiac University since it started polling the issue after Sandy Hook. There’s no excuse for Congress not to act.
The Parkland students are making a difference. The millions of Americans who refuse to accept 35,000+ gun deaths per year as normal are making a difference.
Words need to be followed up with action, and those modest steps alone aren't an adequate response to this epidemic of gun violence.
Unfortunately, this wouldn’t be the first time the President tweeted a good game but failed to deliver. The President needs to either lead or put down the phone.
I’m encouraged by the President’s call to strengthen existing background checks and ban bump-stocks. Whatever you think of the President, that’s a lot more than most politicians have been willing to say on the matter.

As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I will continue pressing the nation’s intelligence leaders and the social media companies to be far more aggressive and proactive in responding to this ongoing threat.
This indictment also tells us we all have more work to do. While social media allows Americans to communicate and share ideas in ways unimaginable just a decade ago, we each bear some responsibility for exercising good judgment and a healthy amount of skepticism online.
The indictment confirms what we heard this week from the nation’s top intelligence officials: Russia is still using social media to attack our democratic institutions and sow division amongst Americans.
This indictment vindicates the Senate Intelligence Committee's bipartisan investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, particularly its focus on uncovering and exposing the role that social media disinformation played in that effort.
This indictment shows that the "Internet Research Agency," a Russian troll farm, was a key component of Russia's interference in the 2016 elections, and that it continues to spew divisive and false content aimed at undermining the United States.
With this indictment, the Special Counsel and his team have taken an important step to hold Russia accountable for its attack on America's democracy.
I’m extremely disappointed that our reasonable, bipartisan compromise failed to garner the 60 votes needed to move forward. I will continue to work with my colleagues to #ProtectDREAMers, who know no other home but America.

This action was also taken without regard to the damage it could do to our ability to protect Americans from threats around the globe.

Even Trump-appointed officials at the FBI have voiced “grave concerns” about its accuracy, and his appointees at the DOJ have warned that releasing the memo would be “extraordinarily reckless.”
FISA warrants and other classified intelligence materials aren’t toys for members of Congress to use in partisan games. They’re important tools that the dedicated men and women of the Intelligence community use to keep us safe and literally save American lives.
There are processes in our government that allow for declassification in a reasonable, rational way that protects the sources and methods of our intelligence community. This political charade with the #NunesMemo isn’t it.
As a member of Congress, getting appointed to an Intelligence Committee is a very sobering proposition. You hear things that you have to keep secret, that you can’t share with anyone, because you know if you do reveal classified information, people can die.
This is not the way the United States government operates, and it is not the way members of the Intelligence Committees are supposed to act.
I’ve seen the underlying Intelligence documents behind the #NunesMemo, and it is a distortion of the facts. Anyone can selectively pick documents out of a huge storyline and cook up a case. That doesn’t make it true.

But tonight President Trump showed that he is not willing to stop catering to the most heartless, extreme elements of his base who want to restrict nearly all forms of legal immigration.
I also believe that there is a bipartisan deal to be had that would grant Dreamers – the undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children –  a pathway to citizenship, and increase funding for border security.
He has been saying for months that investing in our nation’s roads, bridges and tunnels must be a priority. And I agree. But after months of talking, it’s time for the President to move beyond rhetoric, start offering specifics, and be serious about real funding solutions.
The President missed an opportunity tonight to show he’s serious about being a bipartisan dealmaker. Despite the length of this speech, there was little in it that reached beyond the divisiveness and partisanship of his first year in office.

This is not fake news. This is not a witch hunt. It is a clear and unanimous conclusion that Russia attacked the United States. Frankly I’m astonished that our President has failed to even acknowledge this ongoing threat to our democracy. It begs the question: WHY? https://t.co/1p65WLQBzT
You can read the entire ICA report here: https://t.co/LLak67wbuh
“We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes.”
And here’s the conclusion that should give every American pause:
“Moscow’s influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations—such as cyber activity—with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls.’ “
“We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump’s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.“
We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.”
Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.
“We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.
…but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.”
“Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order…

I hope my concerns are unfounded, but there are troubling signs.  It is critical that we as elected officials, and as citizens, speak up against these threats now…before it is too late.
Congress must make clear to the President that firing the Special Counsel, or interfering with his investigation by issuing pardons of essential witnesses, is unacceptable, and would have immediate and significant consequences.
In the United States of America, no one is above the law. Not even the President.
Firing Mr. Mueller or any of the top brass involved in this investigation would call into question this Administration’s commitment to the truth and the rule of law.
While the President has said he is not considering removing Special Counsel Mueller, the President’s track record on this front is a source of concern.  I’m certain many of my colleagues believed that he wouldn’t possibly fire Mr. Comey, either.
These statements are reckless. They are inappropriate. And they are extremely worrying.
In recent weeks, a growing chorus of voices in Congress, the media, and the White House have begun pushing a coordinated narrative undermining the credibility of the Special Counsel’s investigation and the FBI itself.
Any of these actions would be a gross abuse of power and a flagrant violation of Executive branch responsibilities and authorities. These are red lines, and we simply cannot allow them to be crossed.
That means:	 	- Firing Robert Mueller or top FBI or DOJ brass overseeing the investigation.		- Pardoning key witnesses in an effort to shield them from accountability		- Any other attempt to shut down the investigation
It's time to draw the line: any attempt by President Trump to interfere with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation would provoke a constitutional crisis.

What happened tonight is a disgrace.
Even if Senate Republicans had written this bill through regular order — which they didn’t — it wouldn’t have mattered. Leadership rewrote the bill this afternoon and dumped the crumpled, handwritten bill text hours before the vote.
This was a wasted opportunity to do once-in-a-generation, bipartisan tax reform. Instead, Senate Republicans passed a partisan bill tonight that cuts taxes for wealthy on the backs of the middle class and leaves our children with $2.2 trillion in debt.
The Senators who vote on the tax legislation tonight won’t be around to pay the bill. Our children and grandchildren will be paying off this $2.2 trillion increase to the national debt for years to come.

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence takes seriously our responsibility to continue a thorough, bipartisan probe that follows the facts wherever they may lead.
Members of Congress from both parties must make clear that those actions would be fundamentally unacceptable and incompatible with the rule of law.
It's part of an alarming pattern in which POTUS has already fired the FBI Director; pressured the AG &amp; top intel officials to interfere w/an ongoing investigation; &amp; contemplated issuing pardons for his associates or firing the special counsel, according to numerous press reports
This guilty plea also comes on the heels of a new report about the President’s efforts to silence the independent, bipartisan Senate investigation into ties between Trump associates and Russia.
This follows the guilty plea of a Trump campaign aide; charges against a Trump campaign manager; and charges against a key aide to the Trump campaign and transition.
Mike Flynn has pled guilty to criminal conduct, while he was serving as National Security Adviser to the President of the United States, involving his contact with Russian officials.
The Special Counsel’s probe has found illegal behavior stretching into the senior most levels of the White House.

@AARPVa And you can't be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
@AARPVa *Access* to healthcare is much better thanks to the ACA. Millions more have coverage.
@AARPVa Last question: Is healthcare better today than it was before the Affordable Care Act?
@AARPVa Both parties should have learned by now that we shouldn't pass legislation making massive policy changes without bipartisan support.
@AARPVa Right now I'm hopeful we can move past partisanship &amp; the chaos it causes, and focus on Sens. Alexander &amp; Murray's bipartisan negotiations.
@AARPVa It's definitely a problem, particularly for insurance companies figuring out if they're going to offer plans in markets like Virginia's.
@AARPVa Bob asked about the Trump Administration's Executive Orders attempting to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
@AARPVa 1. Allow insurers to sell plans across state lines.	2. Reduce ACA's reporting requirements	3. More pooling of #SmallBiz purchasing power
@AARPVa Austin from Locust Grove asked what we can do to bring costs down for #SmallBiz owners like him, who've seen insurance costs go up. Fair Q.
@AARPVa More good news is that the Senate unanimously passed our bipartisan CHRONIC Care Act, which will expand telehealth &amp; in-home care.
@AARPVa The challenge is that we do need to reform &amp; improve the Affordable Care Act. Keep what's good, fix what's bad &amp; do it in a bipartisan way.

But to actually do bipartisan healthcare reform, we need a willing partner. Senate GOP crafted #Trumpcare in secret with 0 hearings.

This investigation will move forward in a bipartisan way. We need to follow the facts wherever they lead.
For all the denials we’ve heard from the administration, for anyone who’s said there’s smoke but no fire,  I’m curious what they’ll say now.
There are no excuses for what we’ve seen in the last 24 hours. Lying is not a rookie mistake.
We now know the denials of contacts with Russians that we've heard during the campaign, transition &amp; administration are all patently false.
This is black and white: Trump officials at the highest levels knew Russia was working to aid Donald Trump &amp; welcomed Russia's interference.
That’s why we have to continue this investigation. There’s a lot more work to do.
Trump officials keep conveniently forgetting about mtgs with Russians, only to recant after being confronted with evidence to the contrary.
More importantly, this follows a constant and troubling pattern from the Trump campaign and administration.

The U.S. is behind the curve when it comes to providing benefits for a changing workforce. Here's my idea for turning things around: https://t.co/uX0r6FpEOL
At the end of the day Capitalism 2.0 is about making sure everybody’s got a fair shot in a changing economy. #AspenIdeas @AspenFutureofWork
If companies can’t reform on their own, consumers (and voters) may demand these kinds of changes on their own terms #AspenIdeas
Beyond what government can do, consumers are demanding more responsible practices from the businesses they work for &amp; buy from. #AspenIdeas
We need a portable safety net with benefits that can follow these workers throughout their careers, wherever they work. #AspenIdeas
With the rise of the part-time, #Freelance, &amp; #GigEconomy workforce, fewer workers are spending their careers at one firm. #AspenIdeas
Tax credits &amp; capital gains reforms could incentivize reinvestment and reduce outsourcing &amp; short-termism. #AspenIdeas
And that money sure as heck isn’t going to the workers. It’s disproportionately benefiting investors and the management team. #AspenIdeas
Many companies are prioritizing short-term profit - buybacks and dividends - over workforce development and long-term investment #AspenIdeas
Our economy has changed since the Great Recession, and we need to hack capitalism in order to fix it. Here's where we can start. #AspenIdeas https://t.co/HY8443uXbb
