I can bet dat Barca European domination has ended! They are very beatable only that teams were impatient wit their possessive football style

I respect Guardiola's decision.. He is a man of honour! Unlike Mancini that goes back on his words. #just like a dog going back to his vomit
Guardiola's eminent departure will cripple Barca. Big names might leave the club this summer! Time for Man Utd to stamp its authority in UCL
@ManUtdMyLife Farewell to Pep Gaurdiola. I have alwayz admired him a lot as a manager! I think he possesses the qualities to lead Man Utd..

@Cristiano For me, there are only two players in this world: C. Ronaldo and others... U were simply class tonight
I think CR7 is a better player in 2012 than Messi. His performance tonight was unbelievable. I love dat dude. A complete professional
Without referee's assistance, Barca is very venerable..My shout out goes to CR7! He proved his critics wrong! Where was Messi today??

@ManUtdMyLife Parker has been all over the place for #thcf#. I wonder why English fans don't like the dude..
@OnlyJonnyEvans Ur use of the balls dis season has been excellent. I have never doubted ur ability even after that performance against Milan
Wonderful strike from Drogba.. Gallas was practically sleeping on duty.. How I wish Chelsea will be this clinical against Barca in the UCL
