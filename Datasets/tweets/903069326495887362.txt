As the Students Demand Action Leader for Nebraska, I am proud to say we are doing great. We have a voter registration drive coming up and are getting more and more people every day. #StudentsDemandAction
I'm glad to see such a response from the American people to these horrible Neo-Nazis. The President won't stand up for the people, so we are standing up for ourselves. https://t.co/radBeQpV6R
Just got my yard signs put out for @Clure4Congress, @bobkristne, and @JaneRaybould. I believe one day Nebraska will finally elect a Democratic candidate and I'm going to do everything in my power to make that day come sooner.

I would like to bring some attention to an amazing woman running for office. Yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting @LorenceForNE and campaiging for her at the Cass County Fair. Go support her, she is a fighter and a great candidate for Nebraska.
It has been 1 year since Charlottesville. The same Neo-Nazies who killed #HeatherHeyer a year ago are still marching in our streets. Our President refuses to stand up for her or any of us. Has we remember we must also continue. The fight is not over!
#TYTLive I will say it now. If Kansas results magically change after this "computer glitch" the people of Nebraska will march down there, because we are Mad As Hell, with the rigging of America elections.

My old account @realjaydenspeed was lost due to a mistake with Twitters system. Instead of fighting to get it back, I am going to be using this account from now on.
