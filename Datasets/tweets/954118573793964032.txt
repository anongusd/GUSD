@Riffraf26662469 @AiG I spoke of the Christian god because that seems to be the god discussed in this forum.  I hold that whether gods exist depends upon the definition of a god.  If the Christian god is the archetype, then no gods exist.

@DarthKiller2 @GodDanC @IsaiahBucur @curious_more @AwayFromTheKeys @Through_Science @RandallMathew @AiG I'd call creationism worse than flat earth because, to date, there is no cadre of flerfers taking over government.
@TubeRider The Constitution stipulates that a President may be impeached for treason, bribery, and "high crimes and misdemeanors" but does not specify what those high crimes and misdemeanors might be.  I suppose that that would be up to the House, when drawing up Articles of Impeachment.

@AiG The gospels differ for the same reason the 2004 version of "The Manchurian Candidate" is different to the 1962 version, and both differ to the novel.  Each of the screenwriters changed some of the details of the story, and even elements of the plot, to make their fiction new.

@CeleryVase @A__Stout And it doesn't stop there.  They think of Social Security in exactly the same way.  This is why they are not happy about Social Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income.  They see recipients as stealing from their magic pot.
@Corde61944395 @IwearCrocsAlot So, I shall apply your objections back to you.  Maybe you are lying about being a theist.  Maybe you are afraid of being considered... rational.
@Corde61944395 @IwearCrocsAlot I maintain that gods do not exist within reality.  That violates the definition of "theist".  Checkmate.  Again.
@Corde61944395 @IwearCrocsAlot Maybe you have a disorder of reason.  Theists tell us that we won't accept the drivel they (and you) call "evidence", yet you refuse to accept satisfaction of a definition, which is the strongest evidence there is.
@CeleryVase @A__Stout They don't want to pay for genital surgery for me.  The upshot of that is that treatment for kidney disease is beyond my reach, as well.  They tell me that Medicare, etc. covers this.  Medicare covers 80%.  20% of a shit-ton is still a hell of a lot.
@Corde61944395 @IwearCrocsAlot I maintain that gods do not exist within reality.  That is literally one of the definitions of "atheist".  Checkmate.

@AllHallowsNight @YouTube Thank you manymuch.  I'm settling down a bit, just waiting for the next hammerfall.
@crandallgold @BamUFTNYC @Ashluelaroe Well thank you!  These days, I need all the points I can get.
@AiG Your question is worded to imply that there is a good argument.  There is, in fact, *no* good argument for the existence of your god.  They all boil down to "I want my god to exist, therefore it exists".
@BamUFTNYC @Ashluelaroe What makes you think that they're trying to keep them *out*?  My guess is that the firearms in their vaginae are *bait*.

@AiG First, evolution does not address the origin of life.  Second, it's not that evolution has anything to do with religion, it's that you attack all rational theories of how the universe works because they disprove the faerie stories you use as your "authority".
@BrantLafrenz I actually had wanted to try to get there this year.  Not so sure it will work out.
@Grandma_Mo_Says First, he wants more blood tests and an ultrasound.  From there, who knows?
@AntiOrdinary__ For all I know, I may be dying.  I probably am dying.  But there's a lot I don't know.  The doctor wants more tests, then we'll know more.  Maybe.
@Woo_Debunker @AiG Yep.  Pretty much.  That's got to be it.
@Oli88764063 I've had the privilege of seeing a few of those places, and the memory of them will remain with me as long as I have a memory.  I count myself lucky in that respect.
@Oli88764063 I've done a lot of thinking about the alternative.  Not to sound dark or anything, but I wonder whether I'm the lucky one.  There's a lot in store over the next few decades, even the next few years, and none of it is nice.  Looks like I get to miss it.
@DAngelo136 @IwearCrocsAlot It gives me hope for mankind that there should be such an outpouring of support for one such as me.  Unfortunately, there are also so many who want what they want, to the detriment of all.  I wish that that could change.
@DougCarpenter5 Thank you.
@Oli88764063 I'm not sure that that would work.  I'm assuming that, at the very least, there would be citizenship and residency requirements.
@RangaRob2 There's a lot I need to find out.  My doctor wants more tests (I'm not sure why, he told me that I'm at ~20% function), so it will be a while before I know anything more.  I just hope, given the rapidity of decline, that there is enough time for the tests.
@AntiOrdinary__ Let's not go overboard, there's no talk of transplants yet.  I just woke up; feel free to ring me up.
@AntiOrdinary__ No, I won't tell you to fuck off.  We have a difference of opinion on one subject; it's not overarching.
@AiG If that be the case, it is only because Jesus Christ is fan fiction based upon the fiction of Noah's ark.
@vingAints I'll do what I need to do, whatever that may be.
@millzebub @AtheisticSnail @NotJahWitness So am I.
@AiG Even if there was an historical Jesus, his claims would have made him a madman, not a god.  Your New Testament Jesus could be anything the authors or you wanted: just as powerful as Superman, and just as fictional.
@BJPrice1 @AtheisticSnail @NotJahWitness Don't think that I haven't thought of this.  Unfortunately, Pennsylvania doesn't approve of ending needless suffering.

@NotJahWitness Take it easy, Sweetness ‚ô•Ô∏è  I'm the only one around here who gets to cite worst-case scenarios üòò
@divorcereligion @NotJahWitness Not to worry.  There are priorities, after all.
@NotJahWitness Hey Sweetness, in the US, a kidney will run about a quarter-million, with $17000/year for the immunosuppressants.  I looked.
Today, I received some rather unwelcome news from my doctor.	A Day in a Life #013: Not with a Bang, but with a Whimper https://t.co/LqQKC6V0DV via @YouTube
@AiG "Bibliolatry" describes you to a tee.
@CaseyAnne @IwearCrocsAlot Not problematic.  I'm just a little less than all smiles today.  Please forgive me.
@PurpleWOrange @IwearCrocsAlot @CaseyAnne You can get dentures?  Lucky SOB!  I've had to pay for my dentures (three sets over the last 22 years) out of pocket.
@CaseyAnne @IwearCrocsAlot Not a problem.  Please forgive me, I'm kind of all over the place at the moment.
@CaseyAnne @IwearCrocsAlot Again, I'm already on Medicare.  I have been since 1991.  And Medicare pays 80% of covered costs.  20% of a shitload is still a hell of a lot, a hell of a lot that I don't have.
@domenictiso4 At a quarter-million dollars for the procedure and $17000/year for the immunosuppressants, I don't think so.
@Nicks2007mom What is that?
@_LauraLulu @IwearCrocsAlot My doctor is referring this to his social work branch, but this is the US and I'm not optimistic.
@CaseyAnne @IwearCrocsAlot I've been on Medicare for 28 years, with a so-called supplement for the last 10 or 12.  Even so, I've been hit with some pretty stiff charges for tests and procedures.  Some, I've left unpaid, but I rather doubt that I could do that for months or years ongoing.
@IwearCrocsAlot Kidneys failing.  This is the US, which means that I can't afford to do anything about it, so I guess that I'm dying.
I got a call from my doctor.  My kidneys are failing.  After a lifetime of hypotheticals, I finally get to face my own mortality.

@de_school @RegTheDude @CreationMuseum And you are equivocating.

I give up.  I tried to get a straight answer from Karlo Broussard on Catholic Answers Live, and all I got was the long-form circularity I explicitly asked him to avoid.  I can only assume that whatever comes out of his mouth regarding his apologetic is dishonest, and he knows it.

@joel_edmund @Lead1225 @IwearCrocsAlot @SonOfManPlay @DarthKiller2 @Aron_Ra @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind @jeranism Let me say it again:  The Jesus *of the NT* is either a myth or a legend.  If there was a living human upon whom the legends were based, he is lost to us.  We cannot know him because nothing verifiable was written about him.
@ABranesample @Corde61944395 @Aron_Ra @joel_edmund @Lead1225 @AdamKeneinan @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind Hey Arti, are you going to drag your butt to Movie Night?

@joel_edmund @SonOfManPlay @DarthKiller2 @IwearCrocsAlot @Aron_Ra @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind Historical fiction, perhaps, but certainly not biographies.

@joel_edmund @SonOfManPlay @DarthKiller2 @IwearCrocsAlot @Aron_Ra @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind If you are claiming that the physically impossible events described in the NT are historical, then I'm sorry, but you have lost all credibility and any pretense to it.
@Aron_Ra @joel_edmund @Lead1225 @AdamKeneinan @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind May I say that that is the best definition of "faith" that I have yet heard?
@Lead1225 @Aron_Ra @joel_edmund @DarthKiller2 @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind @MikeWingerii You're speaking of prophecy here, which is physically impossible.  Besides, the same passage of Daniel 9 is said to predict two events separated by 19 centuries, and the Suffering Servant of Isaiah 53 is the kingdom of Israel.
@joel_edmund @SonOfManPlay @DarthKiller2 @IwearCrocsAlot @Aron_Ra @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind The gospels simply cannot be historical biographies because the significant events within are physically impossible.
@joel_edmund @TheEld2 @Aron_Ra @IwearCrocsAlot @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind This is what I get for getting my hopes up.  Genesis borrows heavily from pre-existing creation myths likely encountered during the Babylonian captivity.  Genesis reads so badly because whoever edited it did a hack job of it.
@joel_edmund @DarthKiller2 @SonOfManPlay @Aron_Ra @Lead1225 @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind Ham doesn't represent historical Christianity, but neither does modern Christianity.  The earliest Christians were apocalypticists; in their view, we weren't supposed to exist.  Their Christianity dictated that their new age was supposed to arrive within their lifetimes.
@joel_edmund @IwearCrocsAlot @TheEld2 @Aron_Ra @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind Oops, I see that you did point me to it!  Thanks!
@joel_edmund @IwearCrocsAlot @TheEld2 @Aron_Ra @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind Could you point me to it?  I'll give it a read.
@joel_edmund @SonOfManPlay @Aron_Ra @DarthKiller2 @Lead1225 @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind I got this from Dr. Michael W Jones, back when I worked with him at NCG Studios.  He didn't, and you don't it seems, get that we are not interpreting Gen 1-11; we are refuting the claims made by certain people *about* Gen 1-11.
@joel_edmund @AdamKeneinan @Aron_Ra @IwearCrocsAlot @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind The problem with that is that people have been trying to verify the claims in the "historical books" and have failed miserably.  Finkelstein and Silverman come to mind, showing that Moses was not an historical person and that the Exodus did not occur.
@joel_edmund @SonOfManPlay @Aron_Ra @DarthKiller2 @Lead1225 @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind We agree on that, at least.
@Lead1225 @AdamKeneinan @Aron_Ra @joel_edmund @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind I'm not remembering "Mythical Man".  Let me look that up.  And thank you for citing the video!  I definitely appreciate that!

@AdamKeneinan @Aron_Ra @joel_edmund @IwearCrocsAlot @Lead1225 @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind The difference between a history book about modern space exploration and a science fiction novel is that the events in the history of modern space exploration can be independently verified as having occurred.  Try that with your bible.
@joel_edmund @AdamKeneinan @Lead1225 @Aron_Ra @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind That was a direct answer to Adam Keneinan's statement.
@Aron_Ra @joel_edmund @DarthKiller2 @Lead1225 @IwearCrocsAlot @YouTube @craigreedholy @kenthovind I would call the Christian bible an 'anthology' rather than a 'book'.

@PleasureOfDoubt @SyeTenB @dustdevildeity @Jakeology90 @Shann_Q0 @idiolekt He'll contest whatever he has to, to make his point, even if that means reducing reality to abject chaos.
@SyeTenB @dustdevildeity @Jakeology90 @Shann_Q0 @idiolekt Ah, so you've gone to your wild card.  So soon?  Truth is the quality a statement has when it accurately describes the common reality; it is known via peer review.  The person who demands a self-contradictory reality reveals his own disorder of reason.
@SyeTenB @dustdevildeity @Jakeology90 @Shann_Q0 @idiolekt No, I am saying that it is true that your god does not exist, because it can be shown to be self-contradictory.
@ItsGonnaGoForIt @Frankendr01d Hey look, Jen upvoted.  Could she be thinking of suggesting Chuck Tingle? üòÅ
@ItsGonnaGoForIt @Frankendr01d I maintain that there are more than that, as it seems that every believer invents his own god.  Perhaps substantial groups of believers employ a common template, but The Gods Themselves (hat tip to Isaac Asimov) are individual constructions.
@Frankendr01d @ItsGonnaGoForIt https://t.co/JkbUxRroY6
@SyeTenB @dustdevildeity @Jakeology90 @Shann_Q0 @idiolekt At all, since your god is self-contradictory and therefore does not exist.  https://t.co/JkbUxRroY6
@SyeTenB @dustdevildeity @Jakeology90 @Shann_Q0 @idiolekt So you are saying that it is impossible to make sense of truth at all.
@dustdevildeity @Jakeology90 @SyeTenB @Shann_Q0 @idiolekt Truth is the quality a statement has when it accurately represents reality.  There can be true statements, but there is no Truth.

@SteveMcRae_ @LetruneInedil @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd I need two Excedrin‚Ñ¢.  This happens every time I contemplate philosophy ü•¥
@SteveMcRae_ @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd I did read that.  It sounded to me much like the Deflationary Theory of Truth, which I find to be redundant.
@SteveMcRae_ @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd So once you have a way to deduce, it becomes a priori even if it took observation to originally formulate the deduction?
@SteveMcRae_ @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd And what I am trying to say is that observation and axiom are separated by millennia, and thus not necessarily obviously linked.
@SteveMcRae_ @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd Maybe I am wrong; I'd like to come to understand how.  One of the reasons I am at best lukewarm toward philosophy is that it often appears that it is used to phrase questions in such a way as to get the desired answer.
@SteveMcRae_ @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd But that's my point.  "One", "two", "plus", and "equals" had no meaning before they were invented, and that was long before the advent of number theory.  As I understand it, mathematics was based upon the observation of counting.
@GodlessOzzy @SteveMcRae_ @RealistDotNerd Well, I thank you manymuch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@SteveMcRae_ @GodlessOzzy @RealistDotNerd I don't suppose that I'll be making any friends with this, but:		The concept of a single object grouped with another single object producing a pair of objects existed long before mathematics, or even people to think about it.  Mathematics was invented to *codify* the concept.

@AiG "The creation model‚Äîwhich proposes that God created unique seafloor communities during Creation Week that were later destroyed during the Flood‚Äîmay provide a clue."		You denigrate scientists for using language like "could be" and "might be" while using it yourself.  Hypocrite.

@CatholicForLife @Nathanie1Thomas @SpeakerPelosi @catholiccom Then you have no understanding of how reproduction works.  Fully half of all fertilised eggs fail to implant and are lost is the woman's next menses.  So much for your "natural course of life".
@Nathanie1Thomas @CatholicForLife @SpeakerPelosi @catholiccom Please put away the theistic "arguments"; they only undermine your position.  An abortion is an invasive procedure with its attendant risks.  There is no need to use it as birth control when there are better methods.
@CatholicForLife @SpeakerPelosi @catholiccom With that statement, you've demonstrated that you do not understand the issue at all.
Okay, I think that I know how I'll handle my next response video.  And let's see whether I can finish it by the end of tomorrow.
@Nathanie1Thomas @CatholicForLife @SpeakerPelosi @catholiccom And yes, I would like to reduce the number of abortions, which is why I stress access to contraception.  The number of abortions necessary will never be zero, however, because of threat to the woman's life, pregnancy resulting from rape, etc.
@Nathanie1Thomas @CatholicForLife @SpeakerPelosi @catholiccom Healthcare, housing, and many other things that the far right forced-birth proponents detest contribute to the quality of life.  Actual life.  Living, breathing, suffering humans.  That's the motivation of the initial response.  1/2
@e1ais "He doesn't want to look like a loser."		I've been saying that since this started.  We need him removed from office yesterday.  And McConnell must go, while we're at it.
@Nathanie1Thomas @CatholicForLife @SpeakerPelosi @catholiccom Yes, I would.  I maintain that it should not be a preferred form of birth control, but it must be available for the sake of the women who need the procedure.  If you want to reduce the number of abortions, the answer is accessible birth control, not a ban on abortions.

@lawowl343 @AiG It's a matter of control.  The guys at the pulpits need tithe and the hard-right votes of their congregations, so they indoctrinate, indoctrinate, indoctrinate.		"Give me the child for the first seven years and I will give you the man." -- attributed to Ignatius of Loyola

@604Atheist I am in absolute agreement.
@AiG Every diagnostic characteristic that describes apes describes humans.  Humans are apes.  That your fragile ego can't deal with that is of no concern to rational minds.
@stoneyweasel @AtheistCapslock @TheFTProphet George Washington has had legend built around him, but the historical character is quite available.
@stoneyweasel @TheFTProphet @AtheistCapslock Your Jesus was resurrected, but your Jesus is a storybook character.
@stoneyweasel @AtheistCapslock @TheFTProphet Point blank: Your Jesus exists only in legend and fable.  If there was an historical Jesus, he is lost to us.
@stoneyweasel @TheFTProphet You might want to look into clozapine.
@stoneyweasel @AtheistCapslock @TheFTProphet I agree that you're not being honest.
@stoneyweasel @AtheistCapslock @TheFTProphet No, you aren't.  Based upon actual people, possibly, but the scriptural characters are as fictional as their Jesus.
@stoneyweasel @TheFTProphet A fictional character called Jesus claimed to be one with another fictional character called The Father.		Fixed it for you.
@stoneyweasel @AtheistCapslock @TheFTProphet And Superman conferred with Batman, Wonder Woman, and other members of the Justice League.  What's your point?
@stoneyweasel @TheFTProphet Sorry, but those two descriptions are contradictory.
@stoneyweasel @TheFTProphet You'll have to be a little more specific.  I can say this, however: The Jesus worshiped by current Christians certainly never existed outside of legend and fable.  If there was a Jesus upon whom the stories are based, he would not recognise himself in the texts.

@nlmnewzealand @APoulikakos I'll help you out.  How is it known that "Bellum Gallicum" was written by Julius Caesar?  Now, apply that sort of analysis to your bible.  (Spoiler: It wasn't written by your or any god.)
@stoneyweasel @TheFTProphet What you cite only makes references, contemporary to the authors, to Christians and what they believed about a character they called "Jesus".  Where are the reverences to this Jesus, himself?
@APoulikakos You think that you'll get a sensible answer?

@AiG "Scripture calls Christians to refute false views."		Then why aren't you refuting your scripture?  It's so easy, a "damned atheist" can do it.  Oh, wait, we're not vested in your scripture to justify bigotry...
@muchrefraction And this, my dear, is why I remain a staunch fan of C.  Or assembler, even, although I haven't written in assembler in years.

@AiG If all of the evidence pointed to a creator, I would have to accept the existence of a creator.  That's the way it works.  Note, however, that *a* creator is not necessarily *your*creator.  *A* creator could be Brahma, depending on how the evidence points.

@fabrsport @AiG You are hopeless.
@fabrsport @AiG As I said, you can't even get the concept right.  Right and wrong are not blindly following orders from an imaginary sky-daddy, they are understanding the consequences of actions as they pertain to those affected.
@fabrsport @AiG You wouldn't know right from wrong were it to bite you in the arse.  Instead, you pull whatever sounds good to you at the moment from an horribly inconsistent anthology of disparate books.  I, on the other hand, hold to Mill's utilitarianism.  Look it up.
@AiG You can bequeath them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life, but you must not rule over your fellow Israelites ruthlessly.		In what universe is this an utter condemnation of slavery?  3/3

@Genesis31292337 @AiG So you are telling me that you are not related to your parents.  Good to know.
@AiG Explaining DNA similarity by means of a common "Creator" is actually quite difficult.  You first must try to establish the existence of the "Creator", then pull your face from the brick wall you ran into when you couldn't do it.
@AiG Your god didn't make anything.  Par for the course for something that doesn't exist.

@AiG Hey, broken record, what I said last week still stands: you weren't there either.  Your insisting that your magical imaginary friend told you the story doesn't make it so.
@AiG "But why does the earth look supposedly old?"		Earth looks old because it is old.  About 4.5x10^9 years old.  Additionally, you look like a lying piece of crap because you are a lying piece of crap.
@StevenDJBaumann This is manymuch the prettiness!

@Floridaline Hey SJ, I have challenged you.  I would do it again, but you blocked me, likely because I'm a transwoman.
@AiG You criticise the flat earth claim, yet you can't critique your own beliefs.  Telling, isn't it?
@AiG "What a nose! If you‚Äôve ever seen a bloodhound at work, you can‚Äôt help but be impressed. Such tracking skills could never have arisen by accident. Only one explanation makes sense."		Artificial selection.  Humans designed the bloodhound with the ability to track.

@AiG Yes, we do.  Now, will you hard-right religionists shut up and go away, so we can have the freedom, transcendence, and wholeness?
@Woo_Debunker If he truly believes his spew, he is psychotic, in need of psychiatric help.  If he's using his enterprise to scam his followers, without believing it himself, he's a despicable son of a bitch.  Which is worse?
@Sikools @Simons67692003 @Prophecy_YEC @AiG Perhaps you haven't the intellectual capacity to read that "Ok" for what it is.

@BadTemperBadger @604Atheist @Can_Atheist Okay, kids: My thought is that it requires no great effort to address someone as the person they are.  In my experience, there are natal women who look more masculine than most of us transwomen, but are still routinely addressed as "ma'am".

@Floridaline SJ announced on air that she had blocked me because I said that I didn't like her.  I may or may not have said that; odds are that I did.  But I'll bet a cup of coffee that she really blocked me because she couldn't face me.  Go diddle with Eve Keneinan, SJ.
@Floridaline She supports my right to "do whatever [I] want with [my] body".  How generous.  And if she had an ounce of reason and compassion, she'd know that that's not what it's about.

@BluesDecember @Lead1225 Don't be obtuse; I didn't say that.  I said that there are rules to be followed once a random event occurs.  When you flip a coin and it comes up heads, you can read the date.  Coming up heads was random, reading the date depended upon the rules of minting coins.
@BluesDecember @Lead1225 I'll try again, not that you'll get it or even want to: Holes are not puddle-shaped, puddles are hole-shaped.		And by the way: DNA did not assemble "by chance".  Chemistry is deterministic.  Even if a random event started the process, the process followed the rules.

@ZJemptv It appears that some revision of my definitions may be in order üôÇ
@ZJemptv Hey!  I learned something, today!  Thank you!
@ZJemptv And then, when it comes to the sociology of it, I'm hopelessly lost.
@buttonsandfluff @AshKSkeet @ZJemptv I'm with you there.
@ZJemptv characteristics, e.g. testes do not become ovaries nor does a clitoris become a penis.		Interestingly enough, by my stated definition, I am a woman (gender) but am still male (sex).  That's the way the dice roll. 4/4
@ZJemptv intervention.  For example, my vasectomy in 1985 did not change me from a male to an agametic person.  The secondary sexual characteristics would come under the heading of "gender" by this approach.  Also, medical transition does not change the primary sexual 3/4
@ZJemptv (1) The addition of the terms "isogametic" and "agametic" to "male" and "female" to account for organisms whose mating types produce gametes of equal size and organisms that produce no gametes, and (2) the gametes are to be evaluated prior to any medical or surgical 2/4
@ZJemptv I'm ten years into my medical transition.  Your answer, here, has given me a good idea of where you're coming from; we seem to differ on the definition of "sex".  I go with Joan Roughgarden's gamete-size approach, with the following caveats: 1/4
@ZJemptv Could you refer me to the medical and scientific literature on this, ZJ?  I'm not trying to be an ass or anything, but my training in biology has me a bit skeptical.  On the other hand, if there's a good case to be made for your claim, I'm on board.
@RickeyDale07 @Lead1225 You can stop now.  You went off the rails a long time ago.
@whomeverett @ExMissionary I'm saving this.
@RickeyDale07 @Lead1225 You cite the claim as "proof" of itself.  That is called "begging the question", and is fallacious.
@whomeverett @Floridaline According to Isaiah 26:13, there are.
@pbcmike98 @twdtunes @Lead1225 This is probably the most honest answer I have received, ever.  Thank you.  So it's all confirmation bias and what a person wants to believe.  Would you, then, prevail upon your fellow Christians to refrain from legislating the word of the god whose existence isn't convincing?
@thistallawkgirl I'll be right over üòç
@Lead1225 I have to disagree with your first statement; please hear me out:		The way I read the Pauline epistles he is describing a theology that allows for atonement, even though the Temple was destroyed and propitiation could no longer be made there.  So I find him writing for security.

@Lead1225 Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on "degrees of truth" rather than the usual "true or false" (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based.  1/2
@AiG It's amazing, how much humans are like other animals, isn't it?
@Lead1225 I will take your question to be "Can evil co-exist with any gods in the common reality", and the answer will be "No" because gods do not exist outside the minds of believers.
@AiG Abraham likely never lived at all.
@BionicDance It occasionally happens to me, as well.  It happened a couple of days ago, in fact.  I polished off a tub of creme cheese frosting over the span of 48 hours.
Finally woke up at 1500hrs.  Changed out two of the case fans on the new machine (can't get to the third), and it is 32768x quieter.  Yay, I guess.
@LinuxGal I'll give it a look.
@HondaGuy4 @LinuxGal Ubuntu 16.04.05 occasionally freezes for no discernible reason on the new machine.  I just may see how 18.04.01 works on the spare partition.

@TheGodlessIowan Do what you can to prepare, should you have to make a break for it.		This may sound harsh, it may sound pessimistic, but always hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
@TheGodlessIowan I was not in the situation you describe, but as you know, I was in a similar situation.  My take is: never trust anyone upon whom you depend for anything.  Ever.  And always be looking for a way out.  Always understand that you are alone. 1/2
@chesspiercy @Anti_Ordinary_ @CAPBrony1 I suppose that I have another project to add to my list, namely picking this paper apart.  Oh.  Yay.
@chesspiercy @Anti_Ordinary_ @CAPBrony1 I find so many problems with the treatise that I could (and probably should) write a book, and I'm not past the first section!

@AiG Morality is evident throughout the mammals, so must have evolved with them (~200 mya to present).  On the other hand, your god was invented around 2800 years ago; and not even by Israelites, rather by Moabites.
@AiG One doesn't do much of anything through a dead 1st-century Jew.

@AiG Many chances, over and over.
Scratch that.  Make it 1st tenor.  I'm matching Neil Young note-for-note.
I hope that I'm not speaking too soon, but after 66 days without tobacco, I may be regaining my voice.  I'm well into 2nd tenor again.

@Lead1225 @AStratelates @joel_edmund @JMDapologetics @craigreedholy @EveKeneinan @JCsGirl83 An atheist is better equipped than a theist to study religious belief, since the theist can never view religious belief dispassionately, while the atheist can and usually does.

@Lead1225 @Squircifer What is funny is that I have asked this question many many times, and never have I received an answer.  Never.  It's almost as if these people know that there is no way to distinguish their god from their own thoughts.
@SyeTenB @Lead1225 If you "love your sin", be a Christian.  You can have all the sin you want, then appeal to sky-daddy and all is forgiven.

@Woo_Debunker @GeorgiaPurdom @AiG "What bothers me is that SHE KNOWS that evolution deals with life after it already existed."		That doesn't merely bother me, it ANGERS me.
@drlemail @DemWrite @twin1todd What twisted logic are you employing?

@drlemail @DemWrite @twin1todd An action or position is "moral" if it in some way increases well-being, decreases unnecessary suffering, or both.  An action or position is "immoral" if it in some way decreases well-being, increases unnecessary suffering, or both.  So much for "no morals".

@AiG There is no contradiction whatever.  This is two people, writing 500 years apart, about two different gods, neither of which exist in reality.  There is the appearance of a contradiction only when Christians claim that these books describe the same god in a unified text.

I bit the bullet and ordered the rest of the hardware.  I suppose that this was a good thing because it will take two weeks to receive some of it (the switch from China), probably two days to build the machine and at least a month to shake it down.
@BionicDance I wouldn't say "crap", but Wes Montgomery's original "Bumpin' on Sunset" is, to my ears, lacking compared to Brian Auger's cover.		Montgomery: https://t.co/MQ6fvfg1CC	Auger: https://t.co/PJmeObWorN

As there is often confusion about these terms, I prefer the use of "gynephilic" (anyone attracted to women) and "androphilic" (anyone attracted to men).  This helps avoid confusion, as only the target gender is specified.

@Truth2Power7 @GirlNamedBoston But the Christian holy book insists that YHWH did those things.  Thus, we have a self-contradiction, and you just don't find self contradictions in the real world.
@Truth2Power7 @GirlNamedBoston A supernatural entity, however, could not deliver commandments to Moses, command Abraham to kill his son, or issue congratulations upon the baptism of Jesus, because that requires being present in the natural realm in order to be observed. 2/3
@Truth2Power7 @GirlNamedBoston YHWH, the Christian god, is most often depicted as "spaceless, timeless, and immaterial", which places that god outside the natural realm, i.e. "supernatural", because that is how that god allegedly created the universe, from the outside. 1/3

@geomrian My most recent ex- is a DD cup.  She hates the necessity of constantly wearing some type of bra.
@SpaceMonkey111 They're not attached, they're silicone forms.
@geomrian I wear prostheses (my natural breasts are AA cup, at best).  So, I have the additional joy of sweating under the forms.  With the temperature at 85¬∞F, can you guess the first thing I did after dropping the backpack on the side table (gently, as there was a laptop in there)?
@SpaceMonkey111 Not much to see here, dear.  Mine come off with the bra. üò¢
@SpaceMonkey111 You like that, huh? üòÅ
Q: What is the difference between a transvestite and a transsexual?	A: The transvestite can't wait to get home to put on a bra.	     The transsexual can't wait to get home to take the damned thing off.	     (This one, anyway...)

@LadyGirlPerson Sorry to say, Sylvia, but Miranda still holds a dear place in my heart.  I miss that neurotic little bitch.
Okay, kids, time to roll.  I even remembered the ticket ü§™
@LadyGirlPerson I think that we're thinking of different kitties.  My Sivvy had me years ago.  But Sivvy was adorable, and so is Sylvia üòÉ (Come to think of it now, I recycled a name.  My dear friend named Sivvy for Sylvia Plath.)

@fred_knotts Sure! I've been to one football game, and I really didn't like it.  Granted, it was the Browns at Cleveland Stadium (playing the Saints), but still...
@fred_knotts Not a football fan.  I did like the way Gib Shanley would call a Browns game, though.  You could listen to him and know exactly what was happening on the field.  Jim Donovan was the same way.
@fred_knotts I miss that team of the early 90s.  I really liked Don Slaught, Andy van Slyke, and Doug Drabek.
@fred_knotts Reminds me of the Indians, way back.  Stouffer would develop players, only to sell their contracts.  Think Graig Nettles.
@Floridaline @LadyGirlPerson @stoneyweasel I'm pretty damned sure that *hers* doesn't exist.
@fred_knotts The Pirates are already 12.5 games back, well on the road to nowhere.  I'm still pissed that they traded McCutchen.
@LadyGirlPerson Me!  Me!  Me?
@fred_knotts Yes, the game is at PNC Park.  I have a special affinity for the Nationals.  You just have to have baseball in the nation's capital.  I was so disappointed when the Senators left DC to become the Texas Rangers in 1971.

@CH2517Joan @CosmologicalYT The two times I heard Radu Lupu were twenty years apart, both times playing Beethoven's 5th Piano Concerto.  I was amazed at how the arrogant young genius matured into a brilliant interpreter.
@RealityRevInc Show me the evidence!  https://t.co/iF1lqiQ0j3
@CH2517Joan @CosmologicalYT As favorite performers go, it's a close call between Radu Lupu and Emanuel Ax.  I've had the privilege to hear both live, Lupu twice.		Of others I've heard live, I love Itzhak Perlman, Count Basie, Larry Carlton, Dizzy Gillespie, Maynard Ferguson, Neil Diamond.
@CH2517Joan @CosmologicalYT I manymuch love music listening, of most types and kinds.  My favorite form, though, is the piano concerto.
Would someone please tell me how I managed to get 400 Twitter followers?  Not that I'm complaining, or anything...
@CH2517Joan @CosmologicalYT No, unfortunately.  When I've tried to play any guitar at all, my left fingers simply will not work.  I could barely play piano, but that was 25 years ago.
@CH2517Joan @CosmologicalYT As I say, it's nothing glaringly obvious.  I wish that I could play classical guitar, but the motor area damage prevents that, as well üò¢
@CH2517Joan @CosmologicalYT I doesn't hinder me much, but if you look closely, you can see that I hold my left arm and hand in a "strange" way.  It also annoys me when I'm trying to put in earrings, but not much beyond that.
@CosmologicalYT I cannot, likely due to damage to my motor cortex.  Fine motor co-ordination on my left side is for shit, as well.

We are studying from the perspective of fundamental research.  When I entered the University of Pittsburgh, the department had just changed its name from "Behavioral Neuroscience" to simply "Neuroscience".

Neuroscientists seem, to me, to want to study effectively everything, from its biological basis, and when you spread yourself that thin, it's difficult to build a significant body of knowledge.

As I say, though, my feeling is that you have to have an idea of what a phenomenon -- be it gender or consciousness -- is, in order to be able to study its basis.

Had I been able to obtain my PhD in neuroscience, I would be studying the biological basis of gender, which means that I would need an idea of what gender is.

@SecUllr @AtheistTatted Oh, come on!  The damned stream is MADE to be derailed üôÉ
@Frustd_Atheist @LadeauDavid I like it!
@TheGodlessIowan @kylercurtis What's next?  Will The Lavender Lady turn out to be trans? üòÜ
@Letha_Hughes 1) The claims were just too silly.	2) &gt;40 yrs.	3) I call myself an atheist as a matter of convenience.  In actuality, like Steven Weinberg, I don't think about gods enough to know whether I am an atheist.
A word on the upcoming 100 subs party: The time displayed on my main YouTube page is PST.  Please adjust for your time zone.
@AtheistTatted @SecUllr I can't send an invitation until the chat is in progress, as far as I know, but I can send you a link via Twitter DM.
@SecUllr @AtheistTatted You KNOW that you're invited, Sweetie!
@AtheistTatted @SecUllr Oh, absolutely!  The more, the merrier!
Hey, kids, I've scheduled an open chat party for my breaking 100 subscriptions, 23 June at 2PM EDT.  Come one, come all! ü•≥üçæ	https://t.co/q3DUoAwkxd
Hey, kids, I could use a hand.  @LadeauDavid is looking for bad arguments atheists make in response to theists.  Anyone have any?
@LadeauDavid I'll have to do a bit of thinking on that one.
@itsnaturalpixx @Lead1225 One of my most favorite places in all the world.  Another is the Sonora Desert.
@fred_knotts Perhaps we should get together for a beer or a cup of coffee, one day üôÇ
@LadeauDavid When one realizes that the Jews of the 1st century CE were living in a time of great social stress, fearing the wrath of their god as the cause of their misfortunes, and eventually losing their Temple, the site of the atonement sacrifices, Paul's epistles make a lot more sense.
@LadeauDavid Actually, a lot of the New Testament is read out-of-context.  Keep in mind that the NT is, as Dr. Michael W Jones puts it, "time and target sensitive", meaning that the authors were writing to a specific audience living in a specific era. 1/
@Shann_Q0 &lt;slap&gt; Shut up, Clarion! üòá
I don't see it show up in the tweet, so, for reference, it is "www (dot) youtube (dot) com/c/TheLavenderLady"
@AllHallowsNight I've got to get around to making meat pies again.  It's been a while.
Well, kids, I've claimed a custom URL for my channel.  Yay?	https://t.co/7EvhqT1e0F
@AllHallowsNight You're making me hungry!  Dammit, dammit, dammit!!!!! üòÅ
@fred_knotts By the way, wouldn't be local to Pittsburgh, would you?
@fred_knotts I LOVE the Strip District!  I would bike to Strip District Meats, buy a beef heart, bike it back home (Homewood), and have heart sandwiches for a week üòÅ
Another flash flood warning.  Welcome to Pittsburgh.
@DonMichaud1 @SpaceMonkey111 Offended?  Who's offended?  Hey, @SpaceMonkey111 , rest assured that only a very few people have offended me (you are not one of them), and they had to work hard to do it.
@SpaceMonkey111 @DonMichaud1 Yeah.  I was trying to be a boy, at the time üòÅ  Life is so much better since I came out.
@SpaceMonkey111 @DonMichaud1 No problem.  That was over half a life ago.
@SpaceMonkey111 This isn't the specific plant she ate, but one just like it.
@SpaceMonkey111 @DonMichaud1 So, here it is üòÅ  I was 16 at the time. https://t.co/H1RdJUYcKp
@SpaceMonkey111 @DonMichaud1 I really did have cranial surgery, in 1976.  It left an horrendous scar.

Hey, @chesspiercy has but 61 subscribers?  Come on, let's get her over the 100 mark!  https://t.co/RN12zWqW2Q
@LynnMCo @realDonaldTrump Honestly, I'd rather see a President Biden nominate Barack Obama to the Supreme Court, and a Democratic Senate confirm him.
@DonMichaud1 @SpaceMonkey111 A Photoshop job would likely look better than my own head, after that neurosurgeon got through with me üòÅ
@LadeauDavid @MissusSnarky I took him to task in my own rebuttal of another of his "Atheists Can't Read" series.  Notice, also, that all he had in reply to @MissusSnarky was ad hominem and logical fallacy.  That's all he has.
@LadeauDavid @MissusSnarky I wish that he would take the time to learn.  Believe you me, it was a joy to research my own rebuttal.  Learning is life!
@MediocrityMaze @MissusSnarky It's a joy, in its own way.  I learned quite a lot in researching Joe's claims.
Hey, @MissusSnarky !  Have you seen Cleveland Street Preacher's response to your video?  https://t.co/pt605CDpjy
Hey, Black Sofa!  Joe is responding to you, live!	https://t.co/xzzyh3ekRU
@SpaceMonkey111 She eats them.  She recently ate a fittonia down to the soil, then broke the pot.
Back from a full day of Stuff‚Ñ¢.  I have a renewed driver's license, a DVD of "Quiet Earth", a new headset, and a potted plant to show for it.  Now, to keep the plant safe from Sylvia...
@DonMichaud1 @theomachyv @IwearCrocsAlot @chesspiercy Done, hon!  Let's get a few more retweets on the wire!
@DonMichaud1 @theomachyv @IwearCrocsAlot @chesspiercy I wouldn't be here without you folks.  Now, let's get behind Chess!
@LadyGirlPerson @theomachyv @DonMichaud1 @YTWonderLady @Shann_Q0 @DukeBonanza @Lucianowrites If you're looking for English translations of the texts, Bible Gateway is as good as any.  I use it manymuch.
@AiG Of course that idea is problematic, because there is no evidence to support it and much to refute it.
@sallyforthe @factCQ @SkepticNikki The fortune-tellers are charlatans as much as the clerics.  Show me the actual prophecies (i.e. not written after the fact) that are accurate.  And are you telling me that your god was holding the pen when the books contained in your bible were written?
@sallyforthe @factCQ @SkepticNikki I have asked this many times, and I'll ask it again because it bears repeating:  How does one reliably distinguish between the word of a god and the word of a man claiming to speak for a god in an attempt to gain credibility?  When God speaks, only human lips move.
@NotJahWitness @skeptic_pork @TheGodlessIowan @SecUllr @ladyunicornejg @BlackSofaVlogs @EdgyEmoAtheist @RazielPanda @atheist_justin @LadeauDavid @acce245 @DonMichaud1 I am thanking you manymuch!
@SpaceMonkey111 Sure do, especially since the first landing occurred on my 12th birthday, 20 July 1969.

@boholbo "Long hair? Check.	Citations and fact checking? Check.	Laying down  the law? check.	Real goddamn clear about what you're saying? Check.	Calling them out every time they screw up? Check."		I am surely flattered.
@boholbo The way I read it, and the comment from the same person that followed (after I had posted my original tweet), it was meant to be a compliment.  See below: 1/
@SpaceMonkey111 Well, Fathers' Day and Mothers' Day are not my favourite days, as my sister and I had a couple of arseholes as "parents".  On the other hand, my absolute favourite week is 16 - 24 July.  T -28 days, 2 hours, 4 minutes and 52 seconds!

Those who know my story know that today isn't exactly my favourite day, but to those who actually ARE fathers, who love their children and work to help those children learn and grow, I extend the wish of a happy Fathers' Day.
@SpaceMonkey111 @SkepticNikki I'm older than I look üòÅ
@SpaceMonkey111 Not problematic in the least.  If you'd like to see his work, you can find it here: https://t.co/lAnz9ljWLs

@TheMadGaytheist A friend told me that it reminded her of Thai cuisine.
@TheMadGaytheist It's delicious.  Seriously.  The chopped garlic packed in glass jars with oil works best.  Fresh garlic is MUCH too strong.

@ThinkAtheist But, but, but...  Sharia is the WRONG KIND of theocracy!  Not like ours!
@604Atheist I hold that "religious" and "education" are mutually exclusive, and that a law school is the LAST place where religious influence should be allowed.
@LadyGirlPerson @ABranesample My thoughts tended in the same direction.
@AtheistRepublic Big enough.
@LadyGirlPerson @HondaGuy4 Agreed.  Seek for thyself a physician.  Those symptoms are nothing to play with.

@matty_lawrence No assumptions can ground a proof of heliocentricity via stellar parallax because STELLAR PARALLAX IS NOT A PROOF OF HELIOCENTRICITY.  Stellar parallax is a means of measuring distances to celestial bodies.  Oh, for the love of St. Gulik...

@matty_lawrence "Inductive rationalization" is better known as THINKING.		"I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."	-- Galileo Galilei
@matty_lawrence Romans 1:18-23 is the presuppositionalist go-to.  Please, please tell me how you know that your bible is the word of your god and not the words of a bunch of guys attempting to gain credibility by claiming that those are the words of a god.  In my sixty years, nobody has done it.
@TheStrawAtheist @Lead1225 Pretty much.
@matty_lawrence @SteveMcRae_ I looked at it before you directed me to it in your tweet.  All I see are claims with nothing to support them.
@matty_lawrence Your premise is that your god cannot lie.  Your premise is incorrect.  Your god can lie and has lied.		1 Kings 22:23  2 Chronicles 18:22  Jeremiah 4:10  Jeremiah 20:7  Ezekiel 14:9  2 Thessalonians 2:11
@TheStrawAtheist @Lead1225 I'm with @TheStrawAtheist here.  Take it to the appropriate channels.  Going to a bully's friends won't do much if it happens that the bully's friends are also bullies.
@matty_lawrence And how do you know that your bible is correct?  Please don't quote your bible as saying that it is true and correct, as that is the claim, itself.
@matty_lawrence @SteveMcRae_ Could you show your work, please?  No points if you don't show your work.
@matty_lawrence Incidentally, my Sylvia, who is a cat, firmly believes that she was specially created by Bastet.
@matty_lawrence Why would humans not have evolved, when every other animal did (and continues to do, by the way)?  The methods that have shown us other lineages also show us our own.  What would rule out human evolution aside from human arrogance?
@Floridaline No, Stephanie.  "Evil" is a descriptor applied to a class of actions; it is not a thing in itself (neither is "good" a thing in itself, by the way).  As such, it can have no purpose, even if the actions it describes have purposes.
@Floridaline I need to buy this book, perhaps as a birthday gift from me to me.
@Janice_Resist @KenBlac80899148 What is sad is that I was raised by people like that.

@ChefBurnsEveryt @sawers912 @AiG When we are surrounded by friends, we smile.  When we are isolated, we cry.  The same for other situations.  Without these clear responses, we never would have made it as a social species.
@ChefBurnsEveryt @sawers912 @AiG Well being is actually not that difficult to establish, as is suffering.  Consider Shylock, in "Merchant of Venice", Act III, scene 1:		"If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die?"
@evilme202 @AiG One of the reasons I don't have many friends in meatlife is that most people talk to me only to ask for handouts, and I have nothing to give, even though I may look "wealthy" to them.
@Lead1225 You know, that doesn't sound like a bad idea.  Now, to find room in my schedule.  I already do four shows per week with NCG Studios üôÇ

@millerrsm_jt @skeptic_pork @ClassicalTheis Even small amounts of nicotine and ethanol have mind-altering effects, the former as a stimulant, the latter as a depressant.  This is why people have used them for millennia.  This is what they are supposed to do.
@Lead1225 But how do you *know* that your god and your church "found you", though?  Why not simply changing environments to a place where that to which you were already receptive was easier to see?
@IwearCrocsAlot @RealityRevInc @Twitter @jwarnerwallace I didn't know that, either.
@IwearCrocsAlot @RealityRevInc @Twitter @jwarnerwallace I'm with you there.
@RealityRevInc @IwearCrocsAlot @Twitter @jwarnerwallace It's not okay, but it is within his rights.
@604Atheist Some of the stories do have cultural value, but none of them are the Word of God.
@TheGodlessIowan Sure, you can say "Thank you" enough.  You do it every day, with everything you do.

@scottch01 @AiG Sorry, but I'm going to remain unconvinced because I have no way of knowing that the purported truth you find is your god's rather than your own.  At least I know that the ideas I have are my own.
@scottch01 @AiG But that's my point.  I'm not trying to be difficult, really I'm not, but how do you know that the truth you find is your god's truth, and not an idea of your own?  This is an important question to me because pastors are telling people to do things based upon this purported truth
Congratulations to @TheGodlessIowan for making it to 1000 YouTube subscribers!  YAY!

@scottch01 @AiG When God speaks, only human lips move.  How does one distinguish "God's Word" from the words of some guy claiming to speak for a god in an attempt to gain credibility?  There's the question...
@ChefBurnsEveryt @sawers912 @AiG An action is "moral" if it promotes well-being, reduces needless suffering, or both.  An action is "immoral" if it reduces well-being, promotes needless suffering, or both.  How much more objective can you get?
@evilme202 @AiG Most are online, but that doesn't make them any less friends.
I am happy that we were able to produce this video, and I hope that it can be available for those who need it.	MIRROR: The Godless Iowan | Life Extension and Self Harm Prevention https://t.co/9QoJL2cXmP via @YouTube
@evilme202 @AiG Well, the coin has two sides.  I don't mind being alone, but I hate being lonely.
@TheStrawAtheist Thank you.  I've been in that situation, and occasionally need to be reminded of my own worth.
@CreationMuseum My guess is: "Another in a series of wastes of time and money."  How did I do?
@Atheist_Geek48 @FreeThoughtPgh @AiG Actually, I'm partial to "Star Trek: Generations", in no small part because my friend Al played Captain John Harriman üôÇ
@evilme202 @AiG As it happens, I am not in a relationship at this time, but I am and have been very much my own person, even when my wife would disagree.
@AiG "Indeed, God‚Äôs Word needs no defending, for it is truth (John 17:17)..."		We women need to know, as we all need to know, that there is no way to distinguish "God's Word" from the words of a man speaking in the name of a god in an attempt to gain credibility.
Come to think of it, it's 2055hrs and I might as well take the rest of the day off.  Sort of.  I have quite a few ideas for videos; I can get hard to work in the morning.
Back from PrideFest, and back to work.
@Technologyoffe4 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Nobody may be allowed to decide his own case or set his own sentence.
Okay, kids, I'll be off to the Pride Parade in a few minutes.  Remember that we are all beautiful!

@CherylPerugino @MarkAgee It's too bad that you're in the opposite corner of PA (I'm in Pittsburgh); I'd have you over for chicken paprikash!
@AiG The quote in your article you claim from Richard Lewontin is a misrepresentation, and you damned well know it.  You know it because you misrepresent the source and modify the quote yourself, and because Lewontin complained about being misquoted in 1981.  https://t.co/McGVdkUoRp

I've been doing some thinking (always trouble), and I'm considering a birthday live stream, Friday 20 July.  Would anyone want in, and what might be a good starter topic?  (Apollo 11 is not off the table üòÅ)
@proviewsusa @Noratoriou5 "A source familiar with the discussions told Yahoo News, however, that the rule wasn't targeted at Sanders."		The hell it wasn't.

@SpaceMonkey111 "Strange" is a good talent to develop.  Keep them on their toes.
@SecUllr @ABranesample @NotJahWitness @GrumpyOleDave If Vegemite is anything like the Brewer's yeast I tried eating, many years ago, I might use it as a crack filler, but little else.

@boholbo I was a big kid, so the school coaches all wanted me to play American football.  I couldn't see the point of, in George Carlin's words, 11 guys lining up against 11 other guys, beating the shit out of them, and taking their land.

@paulogia0 Should there be any doubt as to the veracity of a statement, that doubt must be clearly conveyed within the statement; thus, "I believe that Bob rides a purple unicorn", rather than "Bob rides a purple unicorn." (2/2)
@paulogia0 I've been looking at the replies, and I'll go on something of a tangent.  A regular commenter at NCG Studios stated that I am very careful with my words.  He was quite correct.  I believe it an imperative to state as fact only that which one is certain is fact. (1/2)
Two years ago, today, I finally obtained a legal change of name.  So,  it's off to PNC Park to celebrate my meniny (Name Day)!  Yes, I'm a  Dodgers fan, which doesn't make me very popular in Section 325, but I've  never been one to "fit in" üòõ https://t.co/cfbp1SzveW

@Floridaline @LilithLiberated But WHY is it "vicious" behaviour, Eve?  Or will you not state that for fear of being challenged?
@viccallan Yay? üòõ
@viccallan Somebody was less than successful?
@Shann_Q0 I can't comment, because Eve has me blocked.
