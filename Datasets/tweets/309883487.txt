Have little doubt Cohen telling truth today. But why have sitting behind him a Democratic operative-lawyer Lanny Davis with his own dubious  ties. Opening for disingenuous Republicans.
Cohen hurt Trump. His remorse, however, dubious; says turned after Trump bowed to Putin in Helsinki, yet for years hge dealt w/ Russian mob connected Felix Sater; and turned after Charlottesville; yet tolerated Trump's racist demagoguery for decade.  He was no John Dean.
Who's the  racist ? NC Rep, Mark Meadows, insisting in Michael Cohen hearing today that Donald Trump is not racist --even hauling up an African-American woman --had, embraced the birther movement accusing Barack Obama of being born in Kenya. That was about nothing but  race. .

A FAKE AMERICAN ? In Ann Selzer's Grinnell College national poll, respondents are asked what are the most important traits of being a "real American."  First 90% say "treating people equally."Next  88%  say "to take personal responsibility for one's actions." Trump flunks both.
Easy call: Trump tweets that author  Jill  Abramson's books says New York Times is "totally dishonest." Abramson says that's absolutely untrue. Who to believe: the author of the book with impeccable reputation for integrity or a pathological liar ?
