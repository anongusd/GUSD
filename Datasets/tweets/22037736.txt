Or a 3Xer, 2nd epi = engagement party &amp; final could be wedding, w/your music at both...	of course (pun intended).
@rolandscahill I admit, I'm shocked...but not surprised.	#KnowledgeIsPower	#RiseUpAgainstTyranny

@SaszeSoul @FarmBureau @realDonaldTrump The struggle was real before this ridiculous #Shutdown and it gets worse with each passing day.	#PetulantChild needs to get over himself and his poor excuses like "I don't want to look foolish" and "Then they won't give me what I want". 	#Resist #notMYpresident #MAAA
Did he also say that he would rather *feed* ppl cold, greasy fast foods instead of supporting American farmers by offering up fresh well-prepared produce?		#Resist #SupportLocalProduce https://t.co/qlTBtVDHZE
@jadelson The best is not "art for art's sake" but pieces that are evocative and tell a story.	Job well done!	#TheResistance #NoWall	#notMYpresident
@kaitlancollins @fierdang I'll bet that #PetulantChild didn't mention he could have helped out more had he used farm-fresh produce to feed #Clemson et al, instead chose to offer up cold, greasy burgers, fries, pizza with little to no nutritional value. Yum...not!	#Idiot	#Resist #NoWall #notMYpresident
@hunterw All this *food* ain't cheap, even though the quality is just that at best.	Where did that #PetulantChild get the money to pay for all that crap?		Clearly #notMYpresident does not understand the value of $. He could have fed 2x the amount of ppl a real meal for less.	#Resist
@hunterw Instead of directly helping out the many, many farmers in America that could use the financial support by feeding those people simple, well prepared fresh foods, #PetulantChild gives them greasy, fatty, processed *food*. Nice move, #Idiot.	#notMYpresident #NoWall #RESISTANCE
@hunterw Liar, liar, pants on fire! That's right. It's to the point were my communication skills have slipped to lowly childish sing-song retaliations.  Trying to reach #notMYpresident on a level he *might* understand...
