@AOC A public credit registry will develop algorithms that diminish the impact of past discrimination, deliver transparent credit scoring, provide greater data security and offer a publicly accountable way to resolve disputes.  Full proposal coming soon from @Demos_Org
@AOC Past discrimination is baked in to current determinations of creditworthiness. As a result, decisions drawing on credit data reproduce and spread existing racial inequality, making it harder to achieve true economic equity.
@AOC Worse: generations of discrimination in employment, lending, education and housing have produced big racial disparities in credit history. Our credit system is built on‚Äîand continues to reinforce and expand‚Äîdeep racial inequities
@AOC Private, for-profit credit reporting companies are unreliable and unaccountable to consumers, reports are full of errors, consumers must pay to access their own credit scores. Credit reports were developed for lending, but are used for employment &amp; insurance with little basis.

11/ With racial tension and white supremacy used as tools to undercut and restrict access to public goods and services for everyone, especially people of color.
10/ Social exclusion is not just a concept or a complex of rules. Its a set of decisions and actions which concentrates the wealth and power of the economic and political few in this country. https://t.co/tsBZtYphKv
9/ To help you make sense of these experiences, we developed a new series to explain what social exclusion is, explore its impact, and examine the decisions we can make in policy and practice to build a more inclusive democracy and economy. https://t.co/WJtesGIoRQ
8/ From white neighbors calling the police on their black neighbors to Starbucks employees calling the police on would-be customers to white supremacists marching with their tiki torches held high‚Äîthese actions are driven by social exclusion.
7/ A student of color behaves as millions of other students‚Äîfinding a quiet campus space to eat, napping while studying, attending a party. 		Yet, passers-by and law enforcement officers who carry with them the capacity for lethal force, subject this behavior to extra scrutiny.
6/ In 2017 the @splcenter found +300 instances of racist flyers and other materials distributed on college campuses. https://t.co/GUhjSxtOjE
5/ This is all happening amid a rash of high-profile incidences of racism, social exclusion, and over-policing on elite college campuses in the past few years. 		Colleges have not been immune from the re-emergence of open white supremacy and racist hate crimes. https://t.co/OeAtx2YLcM
4/ He found that nearly half of these schools are enrolling a lower percentage of black students than they were in the mid-90s. 		Nationally, 1 in 6 college-age people are black, but there is only one African-American among every 20 students at large, elite public schools.
3/ In a new report, ‚ÄúSocial Exclusion: The State of State U for Black Students,‚Äù @MarkHuelsman analyzes the enrollment of black students across 67 selective public institutions across the past 20 years. Here‚Äôs the report: https://t.co/LbnGRDq7RI https://t.co/GYssAsEv1A
2/ Amid budget cuts and attacks on affirmative action, elite public colleges are enrolling fewer black students than they were a generation ago.

We at Demos remember the communities shattered by the events of the last week, and commit ourselves to the shared struggle to building an America were all of us are valued, safe, and respected.
We commit to hold accountable not just these perpetrators of violence, but also those who would deliberately plunge our country into further bloodshed and division for their own gain.
We must come together, in service of our shared humanity and common hopes and dreams, but also to resoundingly reject the politics of hate.
All of us together are America‚ÄîBlack, brown, white, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, Christians, and members of many different communities.
Those words and actions have created a dangerously unsafe and violent environment directly threatening to so many of our communities, our brothers and sisters.
Hate crimes have been on the rise, as elected officials and political leaders have deliberately fanned the flames of anti-Semitism and racial animus for the cynical purposes of advancing their own agenda.
But we also take note of the grim reality that these acts, while perpetrated by extreme and troubled individuals, are sadly not isolated incidents.
Our love, comfort, and strength go out to the families and communities that have been torn apart by these horrific acts of racism and anti-Semitism.
And then yesterday, In what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in American history, 11 people were senselessly murdered at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh‚Äîat a ceremony to celebrate the naming of a new life.
It continued with the apprehension of the alleged pipe bomber, a right-wing extremist who spewed hate-filled messages online against Democrats and people of color and marginalized communities.
It began on Wednesday with the murder of two senior African-Americans at their local grocery store, by an assailant with a long history of violence, only moments after he tried and failed to infiltrate a Black church.
THREAD. In the last few days, we have borne witness to three heinous, hate-filled acts of violence that have rocked our communities.

Climate justice means radical inclusion of impacted peoples in the political process, so that black and brown bodies don‚Äôt have to absorb the brunt of climate catastrophe. https://t.co/KexzSYcLDw
Climate justice means ending the fossil fuel industry‚Äôs stronghold on politicians.
What do we do now? Climate justice means fixing our broken democracy!
This was in direct violation of the NVRA as it requires language accessibility requires for U.S. citizens. So @Demos_Org sued. And won! Now bilingual materials will be provided in time for the November election.
In Florida, 32 counties did not provide Spanish election materials, even as the state‚Äôs Spanish-speaking electorate continued to grow.
When Puerto Ricans arrived to the states they found themselves scapegoated as Spanish-speaking migrants, and disenfranchised of their rights to equal participation in democracy.
‚ÄúNot only do the most vulnerable communities absorb the disproportionate burden of these disasters‚Äô impacts; in recovery, they continue to face discrimination and disenfranchisement.‚Äù - @adrien4ej @Demos_Org
Now in North Carolina, the poorest communities and communities of color will bear the brunt of the ongoing damage of #HurricanceFlorence because of the historic inequality of the region.
The intensity of these storms reflect how weather events are becoming more extreme in a climate-changed planet. They also reflect how the impacts of environmental disaster are not borne equally by all.
What has come to pass for Puerto Ricans since #HurricaneMaria is a prolonged humanitarian crisis driven by a legacy of colonialism and extraction.

With equal representation in our democracy, we will help ensure that the benefits of our economy are shared fairly; and with a more balanced economy, we will help ensure that Americans across race and class can fully and fairly participate in our democracy.
When workers have the freedom to band together in unions and negotiate with their employers, they and their families gain from improved wages and benefits, safer working conditions, and fairer treatment on the job. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/CWPTcYF3I9
Harassment and discriminatory hiring, firing, promotions, and pay continue to shape the U.S. labor market. Yet these practices systematically disadvantage people of color, women, LGBTQ workers, people with disabilities &amp; other targeted groups. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/5DARuzjEkr
Millions of hourly workers also face rigid and unpredictable work schedules. Workers with erratic schedules cannot predict their hours or pay, cannot plan time for education or a second job, and must scramble to arrange child care at the last minute. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/Yw0B4uMMci
Employers pay less than $15 an hour to more than 40 percent of working people. With wages below this rate, even families supported by a full-time, full-year worker struggle with poverty or near-poverty. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/C9iRZIUYbP
Even as corporate profits grow, millions of Americans go to work each day facing low pay, unstable work schedules, stolen wages, and the lack of even a single paid sick day. Americans work hard, and that should provide enough to sustain our families. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/a6tjS2Rwo2
Today, these laws continue to disempower people of color, particularly African Americans, by linking our fundamental freedom to vote with the criminal legal system. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/3AQD6Zamt9
It‚Äôs time to ban laws that disenfranchise people convicted of felonies and expand voting rights to those whose rights have been taken away. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/ZCNEQHvn1K
Felony disenfranchisement laws have an ugly history. They were	part of the Jim Crow laws that maintained white supremacy and kept African Americans from building political power. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/v9ARv0ExDS
More than 6.1 million Americans‚Äîabout 1 in 40 American adults are barred from voting because of state laws stripping voting rights from people convicted of felony-level offenses. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/hYTPgKpbMh
We need to invest in election infrastructure to make voting and administering elections more accessi- ble, inclusive, and efficient. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/WFhjWUc7Ih
Voter registration is the on-ramp to participating in elections, but the registration system can be complicated and daunting, and does not ease participation in our democracy. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/dHNOHxrTl1
Voting is critical to the health of our democracy. Yet the logistics of voting‚Äîrestrictive polling times, long lines, inaccessible polling places, and limited language access‚Äîimpose barriers to democratic participation for far too many people. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/bZ9l4FupT3

When our government is most responsive to the will of a wealthy, unrepresentative donor class political participation drops. We need a democracy that represents all of us and doesn‚Äôt dilute the power of the American people to elect their leaders. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/MdU0XGmCKt
Because running for office is so expensive, wealthy individuals and corporations who can spend big money on state elections and campaign donations have the largest say in who runs for office‚Äîand who wins. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/9U9efKuZVk
Too often, the strength of a person‚Äôs voice in our democracy is determined not by the power of their ideas but by the size of their wallet. We need to empower voters and small donors by providing adequate public funds for public election campaigns. https://t.co/RzJhReRFi9 https://t.co/v8UVRTdIm5

.@EileenAppelbaum: Everyone pays ordinary income tax on their ‚Äúperformance pay‚Äù except private equity which has ‚Äúcarried interest‚Äù loophole and pays much lower taxes.  #EveryonesEconomy
.@EileenAppelbaum: Private equity firm puts up $1-2 for every $100 they use to buy companies ‚Äî rest is from ‚Äúlimited partners‚Äù with no decision making power. #EveryonesEconomy
.@dashching: Many tax expenditures are ‚Äúupside down‚Äù which both feed inequalities, and increase racial inequities. #EveryonesEconomy
.@dasching: There is now new research showing mobility and  opportunity impact of tax credits extends into next generation. #EveryonesEconomy
.@dashching: Tax revenue can fund investments with widely shared benefits ‚Äî can push back on rather than exacerbate racial inequalities. #EveryonesEconomy
.@markhuelsman: Debt and college completion are ‚Äúnot mutually exclusive‚Äù ‚Äî esp for students of color. 		Ability to complete degree does not inoculate communities of color from defaulting on loans. Impacts housing, starting a business, and much more. #EveryonesEconomy
.@MarkHuelsman: Our national story about education doesn‚Äôt talk about debt ‚Äî but 3/4 students now borrow an average of $35k for college. #EveryonesEconomy
.@algernon_austin There are 7 policies in #EveryonesEconomy will shift these households from debt to positive net worth.
.@algernon_austin: Raising job standards &amp; health care for all &amp; retirement accounts can reduce households with negative net worth. #EveryonesEconomy
.@algernon_austin: African Americans have lowest rate of vehicle ownership, but lots of car loan debt. This is one reason why we need to improve public transit. #EveryonesEconomy
.@tamaradraut: Young people and people of color much more likely to self-ID as working class. Addressing economic insecurity means addressing gender and racial inequality.  #EveryonesEconomy
.@TamaraDraut: New working class is much more female, racially diverse, and working in ‚Äúserving and caring‚Äù sectors. #EveryonesEconomy
#EqualPayDay acknowledges that women need to work an extra three months to close the pay gap with their brothers, uncles, nephews, husbands and co-workers - and they've waited long enough for equal pay:  https://t.co/XDt7oJfGut
@EileenAppelbaum: There needs to be rules to limit Private Equity incentive to fire workers or cut pay / benefit such as severance pay. Private Equity firms should be a ‚Äújoint employer‚Äù so workers have recourse. #EveryonesEconomy
@EileenAppelbaum: In the case of Toys R Us bankruptcy, there are repercussions for workers huge, but private equity managers made millions. #EveryonesEconomy
@EileenAppelbaum: Public companies = 30% debt, 70% equity. Private equity is the reverse ‚Äî can top 80% debt, which is a big bankruptcy risk. Private equity partners take less than 1% of risk but get 20% of profit. Formula for excessive risk. #EveryonesEconomy
@EileenAppelbaum: Generally need $10M to invest in private equity. Much of that comes from pension funds. Investors have no say over what happens with that money for 10 yrs. #EveryonesEconomy
@EileenAppelbaum: People think private equity is just finance and doesn‚Äôt affect workers ‚Äî that‚Äôs completely wrong. #EveryonesEconomy
Our new report, #EveryonesEconomy highlights 25 policies to lift up working people: https://t.co/W55jzLEU6K
@dashching: Many tax credits like housing are tilted towards higher income people. Tax code‚Äôs negative impacts exacerbate racial wealth gaps. The Demos report sets out a number of excellent priorities. #EveryonesEconomy
@dashching: The US  tax code could shape economy to fight inequality ‚Äî like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) #EveryonesEconomy
@dashching: Tax code could be a tool to push back against wealth inequality ‚Äî but we‚Äôve moved in the opposite direction.	#EveryonesEconomy
@MarkHuelsman: Currently, 3 in 4 students borrow for bachelor‚Äôs degree ‚Äî  it wasn‚Äôt this way in the 90s. #EveryonesEconomy
@algernon_austin: Moving  from negative to positive net worth = virtuous cycle. #EveryonesEconomy
@algernon_austin: Student loan and vehicle debt strongest contributors to negative household worth. Debt Free College and investing in public transit = solutions.
@algernon_austin: There is a $150k gap between white and Latino household wealth. #EqualPayDay

When the #DebtFreeCollege Act becomes law, 32 states will immediately be able to provide debt-free education to all Pell Grant students at public colleges in their state.
Student loan debt is holding back an entire generation of Americans from pursuing their dreams. It‚Äôs time to guarantee that all Americans have a #DebtFreeCollege option if they need it.
Higher education needs to be a practical, attainable option for our students. The #DebtFreeCollege Act will ensure that people who can‚Äôt afford to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt can still attend college.
Want to learn more about the Debt-Free College Act? Read our fact sheet: https://t.co/8OwJRBTy5B

During Trump‚Äôs first year, we‚Äôve seen his administration try and take away health care from millions of Americans and roll back voting rights. We also saw millions of people show up‚Äîsome for the first time to defend democracy. We win when we stand together. #SOTU
Political leaders across the board must confront this strategic use of racism. Failing to do so demobilizes black, Latinx, Asian-American and Native American voters, who seldom hear their representatives address the ways that racism constrains their lives. #SOTU
No wall or Muslim ban will help the thousands of working families put food on their table or provide a world-class debt free education for their children. These are the policies we need to create.
Our futures are inextricably linked. We need an economic agenda that places both race and class at the forefront motivates working people of all races to engage in the civic life of their communities and our nation.
The American people deserve a better deal than what the Trump administration is offering. We need an economy that belongs to everyone and uplifts the most vulnerable among us. #SOTU
