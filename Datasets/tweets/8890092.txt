@Delta According to our pilot, #DL2001 may need returning to the gate because of FAA rules about planes taking off within 3 hours of boarding.
@Delta Wouldn‚Äôt it be safer to put us on a flight which has already been de-iced and flown safely today? I don‚Äôt understand why our plane would be left outside on the tarmac all day if de-icing would be needed.
On the plus side I finally found enough time watch ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù. 		On the other hand, I‚Äôve spent enough time on the ground to watch a feature length film... https://t.co/B06CCSvXEV

@sefrost @StLouisBlues @HOFBlues16 @TJOshie77 @Lions @DetroitRedWings @tigers @Cardinals @NFL Related: I think the Pistons had a few runs too? STL was the only ABA City left out of the NBA merger in 1974
@sefrost @StLouisBlues @HOFBlues16 @TJOshie77 @Lions @DetroitRedWings @tigers @Cardinals @NFL I might be a little bitter about this because St Louis has lost 2 NFL teams. And hockey is my favorite sport.
@sefrost @StLouisBlues @HOFBlues16 @TJOshie77 @Lions @DetroitRedWings @tigers @Cardinals @NFL But the wings won in 2008, 2002, 1998, and 1997? Played back to back  in 08 and 09. I have never seen my Blues play in the SCF once in my lifetime.	2-1 in World Series predates both of us (1935, 1968). Lucky to say the #STLcards have won in my lifetime, coincidence vs Tigers.
@sefrost @StLouisBlues @HOFBlues16 @TJOshie77 @Lions @DetroitRedWings @tigers @Cardinals Wings have won 4 cups since the modern expansion era (my childhood). Cards are up 2-1 vs Tigers in World Series all time, but 2-3 in my short lifetime. What‚Äôs you‚Äôre #1 sport?

11.) So I‚Äôm going to miss @Klout, that strange service which tried to measure influence within Social Media.  What were your experiences with Klout?
10.) Ultimately @klout was a service before its time, and social networks have raced to draw similar interest graphs using their own data. But it could have been a lot more by working across multiple services.
9.) It‚Äôs hard not to think of how something like @Klout might help out in this era of #FakeNews, to help ID those voices which carry credibility and have earned trust.
8.) Personally I always saw the need for something like @klout: in an era where the playing field was leveled for anyone to share an opinion, there remains a need to pick out experts and thought leaders.
7.) @Klout was never a big business beyond the Web 2.0 boom, but it was a forerunner of targeting niches and made an honest effort to provide some kind of empirical measurement across multiple services. Lots of others tried and failed to do the same.
6.) @Klout‚Äôs analysis was never perfect at IDing expertise, but it did a good enough job most of the time. As a marketer, it was part of my toolkit for a long time, and helped me make quick decisions in social media.
5.) Marketers like me could now easily have the chance to target not just ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù, but experts in specific niches with promotions. @Klout grew its AI to understand what shared interests made people SMEs and thought leaders.
4.) Not long after, @Klout realized the importance of opt-in for tracking a wider audience, and began offering incentives for people to sign up for its system. Ironic now given #GDPR predicated it‚Äôs demise.
3.) As a social media marketer, I made extensive use of @Klout at first, to show clients that I was targeting those influencers who could make a difference for their business.
2.) In many ways @Klout was a product of its era - trying to make sense of explosive social media growth, and learning to tell whose voice carried weight in this new meritocracy.
1.) On the eve of #GDPR and the sunset of many apps, I want to share a few thoughts of the imminent demise of @klout, the ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù rating service we all loved to make fun of...

I‚Äôll get off my soapbox, but choosing a recognizable video game console was a deliberate choice. Whatever review process the advertiser used was a failure, and the result is much less effective ad.
On the other hand, they started to erase the cord on one controller, but left a remnant stump on the 2nd. The result is an unpolished, contradictory   Ad - at least finish what you started! https://t.co/kqmV0KenNu
On one hand, removing the controller‚Äôs cord seems optional. If anything, having dangling wire winding ‚Äòround would reinforce the idea of removing clutter that no longer fits your lifestyle through this service.
