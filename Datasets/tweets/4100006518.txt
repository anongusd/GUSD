@LWalshNHL what do you mean by big loss? lol
https://t.co/29z0W6TcAa		A big win here.
https://t.co/IjA8XPQkfS		Back to ancient civilization to when the world started first billion years ago.
@ProgressPolls What a low blow, now the Dems plan on using CNN (Clinton News Network) Press reporters to take a shot at Trump.
@CBSNews The Reds still have 100 or so more. So I am assuming its got to be red.
Blue up by 7 pts.
Come on, Reds, drink some red bull, do you some wings like superman.
What?!!! Dems gaining ground.
The blue wave is beat in the US senate.
Red wave need a boost more heat, need 77 degrees more.
Different sites are projecting near results, however, Politico has projected the Dems to win house. I am staying put on the Red Wavies tho.
Hopeful Red Wave
Go Republican, you can do it. Pull ahead.
Stay strong, red wave.
@BlackTechieD @TeriGRight @JeffBir86 @leodunson Couldn't agree any further.
@LWalshNHL Lava-wave rocks!
Please no, don't need a tsunami wave.
Go, Go, Red-o-Rangers.
Rooting for the Reds. Lava-nami beats Tsunami.
Go Republicans, you can do it. Need to retain control.
@LWalshNHL I am anxious and nervous too. Liam, however for me, its Go Republicans!
@JimCarrey @LWalshNHL I vote for LAW and ORDER.
Watching closely as results come in. Dems are attempting to spike up, and Reps are holding on. Big hopes on the Republicans retaining control.
Be careful, Democrats are spiking momentum. Hope the Republicans retain control.
Come on Republicans! Win Republicans! Please.
Vote Republicans!
Go Republicans.

Kavanaugh advances to final floor vote. Yippee.
@senorrinhatch Since polarization of Congress, political vengeance has always been the name of the game b/t Republicans and Democrats. There's no doubt and question about that.
I agree with this https://t.co/h0Px5fy1H2
https://t.co/QQ7ckhQh2E		This is true. If Kavanaugh is confirmed, Trump has solidified his campaign promise and that ups his chances of re-election and smear fails, if Kavanaugh isn't confirmed, Trump still wins, b/c this proves the Dems to be sores.
@senorrinhatch Democrats are just playing the oldie trick in delaying a vote to confirm, they are just afraid that the court would end up with 7 conservatives and 2 liberals. It was a widely held belief that the court should be 5 conservatives and 4 liberals, now the tides turned.
Getting ready and preparing for Auxiliary training.
2 more days and Auxiliary training starts. I am mixed in emotions. I am excited but at the same time, wished for it to be next next week instead of this coming week.

Cuomo supports diversity, so he should indeed attend to a mosque so we could see how he likes it there. After all he's turned NYC into a sanctuary state at the pleasure and fun of just poking at the 45th and at the expense of Nyc-ers. https://t.co/DPMbo4a6um

Only thing I admire about Trump is his bravery. Talk the talk, walk the walk.
Trump is getting at little out of touch. Only thing I think I now have a problem with the Trump administration is that Trump decides on one thing, then switches, and then keeps switch, there is no certainty. However, I stand by my convictions.
Failed by 4 points on the police exam, will try the exam at another time.
Taking the Police MC exam today, and hoping to pass it.

@ProgressPolls In New York or any territories where democrats are in charge, yes.
@ProgressPolls Here is my first strong disagreement. Cancelling the meeting is just going to revert everything back to cold war. I suggest to Mr. Trump to try out the waters and test the currents. If the currents are strong, we can always say no, its not like we haven't b4 dealing with NK.
Just praying and hoping I pass all my six course, after that, restraints on me are loose. Yippee, but then would have to find a job.
CUNY Tuition is just getting higher and higher by time. And Dems believe making it free is gonna get them votes. Since when was tuition for Colleges ever free?

My last semester is killing me with full electives. The Competency test is a way I can fill up 6 credits of electives. However only req. is that it has to be course I've not taken b4. So I just want to know what you all think?
The only other way out for me at John Jay is to take the competency test which is a test of knowledge. The only requirement is that I have to take something I didn't take b4. That will fill all my electives up.
But now Trump is putting himself in a weaken state for 2020. He basically got rid of the loyalist that will be vital to his re-election if he ever wants it. https://t.co/BCgf79aREn

I am stuck, should've did four courses in the last 2 semesters, then I would have ended up with 4 this semester.
My options are narrowed down to using Friday to which I was intending it to be used as a free day to do all my hw.
Last semester, should've done 4 courses, then I wouldn't have had to do 6 now. At the least I've would've be done by now.
Why is it so hard to find the wanted courses, and never an easy thing to get an overtally from chair even when the professor has approved of the overtally.
Oh great, hard to change a APTS back into Full-Time TAP (Tuition Assistance Program). Praying and hoping TAP does fully cover me for my last semester,
@ProgressPolls I mean that global warming is a problem, but shouldn't be current problem nor do I believe it a problem facing us yet. It will be, I believe 15-20 years later. Furthermore, economy and security are more important.
Taking a full 6 courses for the Spring Semester of 18, b/c financial aid wont cover me for the Fall of 18-19.
Financial Aid registering is a real pain. When transforming form a hen to a phoenix, growing the feathers are not easy. Easier said than done.
@CollinRugg Fully agreeing to the irony. Democrats lose, they want a recount, Republicans lose, Democrats don't want a recount.
If I do a cram 6, then I can't do the daily chores assigned to me, if I do 3 and 3, 4 and 2, or 5 and 1, I risk paying for Fall '18. What should I do? Is there a nuclear option I can use to blast all 6 courses and get my diploma.
Damn it, why is Financial Aid so limited. Now I have a nuclear option on my hand. Its either to cram 6 courses in one semester, or face payment in Fall '18. I can't afford both in a way.
Can any1 tell why it is always so hard to find courses that you need and want to take in your last 2 semesters? Darn it, can't even find 3 courses that I need and want to take in the Spring of '18 comfortably. https://t.co/kIlYrrLsdC

Recount in Alabama is the Call of the Wild. Wooohoooo!
@ProgressPolls Bad move for the FCC. Net Neutrality is needed to keep Freedom of Speech open. Banning Net Neutrality is like saying censorship. Also a reason why Socialist HRC and Bernie didn't win '16. US is not #2 China. Censorship is crap.

Well, the President is just like us, he has the right to tweet whenever he wants. I don't see that being a problem. What I see is a coup from the Dem and the Rep side to overthrow Trump, and they think they can get away with it? What a world do we live in? Looks to me NWO! https://t.co/T1lo6Afjbw

@Independent Really? I don't think it'll work. Leaders from both sides don't think it'll work either and it might serve to boost Trump in his ratings. If impeachment succeeds, it looks like we are experience history all over again, the Nixon impeachment era.

Rampaging through essays for college course work.
@ProgressPolls Time will be the best revelation. If claims are surfaced to be false then the accusers will most likely find themselves on the hot bed not the accused.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Any1 with a clue knows what the Dems are up to and they are trying to take down Moore who's running on the rep ballot knowing he's strong to win with or w/o rep party support. So they give him the lame blame treatment. My story here connects. Paying people to do the job.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Targeting vulnerable reps in some states while committing to blunt accusations to take down strong reps in other states. Alabama for instances is a strong republican territory, Dems never won there at least they can't be like NY where Dems do whatever they want w/o opposition.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Dems lost badly in the election in 2016, they are desperate and are still trying to play that lame blame game on who's to blame for their purge in both US chambers and the presidency.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls The facts are simple, all the girls accusations twenty years ago would have been recorded, if nothing was done then, try it now and see what happens. Why wasn't there any record. The answer: Cause it didn't happen.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls I am looking into both sides, and that is why I said the three words: "PAID DEM OPS". 	Anyone who has a clue knows how politics work, The Reps did it when dems were in power, the dems did it back, its called political slandering.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls But it doesn't look like you're even considering all the facts, it looks as if you're just one-siding with the girls. If they were afraid twenty years ago, they are should be more afraid today especially when they are accusing someone that powerful of something that serious.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Samiam, looks like you're just coming up with excuses to prove validity. Could have told someone and they would have stood up for you. And have hardened proof b4 you accuse someone of being a sexual predator? This is not a light crime, this is something that is serious.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Question is do you have sympathy? What if you did nothing and was running for election, some girl comes up and accuses you of sexual molestation, something you did not do, she claims to know you, how would you feel?
@09samiam @ProgressPolls If she were my sister or my daughter and told me, I could have helped. I would have spoken up. I have sympathy, but not towards those who attempt to wrongly use it.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls No point accusing him now if you didn't accuse him when you had the chance to. People do things for a reason, these women probs paid by the dems to do this so they can win election against the Reps in retal for '16.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls My point is stand up when you can and have the chance to or forever shut up.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Trump wasn't as powerful as he is now, so therefore an accusation against him 20yrs ago would have did some harm. Why accuse him now, what benefits will it sow for these women, the answer is nothing so your point is as invalid as their accusations.
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Confronting him then and there at least would have left evidence that would be preserved still today. Pillar of society or not, what is your point if you didn't confront him back then, why now? The accusations are invalid. The accusations just don't add up.
And also it wouldn't have made her less of a laughing stock then she would have been 20yrs ago. https://t.co/xLGkAmIRTn
@09samiam @ProgressPolls Furthermore, who was Trump 20yrs ago, who is Trump now? Why did it have to happen when the person is running for office and when all evidence have dissolved? For anyone with a brain to see the evidence as it's said, its would be very safe to say her claim is invalid. Paid Dem Ops
@09samiam @ProgressPolls 20 yrs ago, evidence is still there, just like the Monica Lewinsky case. If she confronted Trump 20yrs ago, Trump would not have been POTUS today. Why wait until all evidence have dissolve b4 of accuse someone of something. Who was Trump 20yrs ago?
@ProgressPolls The women had the chance to confront him as a predator 20yrs ago, and at the time there would be right on the spot evidence, they didn't, this is obviously a paid democratic operation.

I mean $15 is not bad on the rise, however a quick rise and you can see what restaurants are doing in California, overcharge for the cost. https://t.co/P9mmdfVK6G
@ProgressPolls I think it should be a slow raise to $15 and not a quick one. $15 dollar raise in a quick session is just too much.
https://t.co/xXzHnkg6sk		John Kelly gone berserk mode on Trump train.

Obama's 2008 words hurt Clinton's integrity real bad mixed in with the Healthcare law, and public distrust of Dems over hypocrisy.
Be careful what u wish for, Dems, boycotting Trump's inauguration would come one day to haunt the party like it did on Obama.
De-Moc-Rats are boycotting Trump's inauguration over Senator and Civil Rights icon John Lewis is a rope that can possibly rebound.

If being "educated" means stealing Trump signs just bc you disagree, and beating someone up, then I don't think I want to be educated.
Hillary supporters and allies are then calling Trump supporters uneducated, how educated are they then?
First Hill supporters encourage women to vote, then when 53% of women vote Trump, they say the women who vote Trump are dumb.
Its funny how the people who once wanted the E-College to decide US next Pres-Elect now wants it by popular vote.
Give the guy his four years then judge whether he should get another four years or not.

@dialosexy @NBCNews First start off with small things, then a little bigger, then bigger then bigger, and then the large ones.
@dialosexy @NBCNews When one food resource is not suitable anymore, you move onto the next or bigger thing. This is common sense.
@dialosexy @NBCNews What makes you think this alligator won't do the same?
@dialosexy @NBCNews Titanboa the big snake first went after little guys and then it started going after alligators and crocodiles.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Things are better off early then late.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Just to say the list goes on, end point is that its gonna die one way or another, if not, turns into a Mosasuar.
@dialosexy @NBCNews I don't agree with the killing of that gator, but nor would I want it in the ocean, don't want a Mosasaur on the loose.
@dialosexy @NBCNews All possible scenarios. I know you're angry at the killing, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Alligators are apex predators, also there are animals who could defend themselves and will like kill that gator off.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Then when whales die off, what is it gonna go after?
@dialosexy @NBCNews Relocating it to the oceans serves a big ton of problems, first of them is its gonna go after the whales at some point.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Firstly, what you're actually saying is that we relocate it, its found in a lake or river, relocate it to the ocean.
@dialosexy @NBCNews I will just make a few points.
@dialosexy @NBCNews There's just too much to explain to you, that I don't even know how to.
https://t.co/x7TdEWfZDr		"I am a top government official but I don't know what [C] means in an email".		Is this believable in any way?
@dialosexy @NBCNews Face it, facts are that its either gonna die off due to other factors or its gonna grow monster, and monster down on us
@dialosexy @NBCNews As if we didn't have enough Godzilla, or Titanboa. Moreover I am an animal lover, but I am also a truth person.
@dialosexy @NBCNews or 2) It becomes Alligat-ermintor which is that last thing anyone wants is a Jurassic monster on the loose.
@dialosexy @NBCNews 1) That alligator dies off because of several factors.
@dialosexy @NBCNews All I am going to say that that if you put that alligator in a larger part of the ocean, two things will/can occur.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Humans are not the only thing that affect an animals survival, note that there are other factors that come into play.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Adaptation is my point, there is too much to explain to you in a single tweet for you to understand.
@dialosexy @NBCNews No, I am saying that the survival of this alligator is low.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Yeah, but there are people who are against this to preserve threaten species that are near extinction. The sole problemo
@dialosexy @NBCNews Then three types of civilization in one, the dinosaur period, the Lost Ancient World Atlantis, and modern civilization.
@dialosexy @NBCNews And create a jurrassic/trassic/cretaceous period, recreating the lost world, and then Atlantis at the bottom of the sea
@dialosexy @NBCNews But still shouldn't have killed it, maybe put it in an observation aquarium, and see how big it gets.
@dialosexy @NBCNews Its getting too big, and afraid it no longer sees fish or other animals as its plausible and edible food source.
@NBCNews Maybe that gator will become the first living Triassic or Jurassic alligator, never seen one that large, noted a croc that large.
Philippine's President is going all out on drug dealers, on a summary killing spree.

@MSNBC NC is a definite red state.
Trump is right to appoint 2 new executives to lead the campaign.
Trump's campaign manager is getting at the worst saying that Hill should be shot by a firing squad. That is plain incitement of violence.
Trump is sabbing his own campaign, should have dignity in his choices.

Obama's term plus Hillary's term with then been equivalent to 3 terms in office of Obama, and then if elected again, that will be four.
Similarities that since Obama can't do four terms and his term is up, he wants Hillary to do it with him pulling the strings from behind.
As much as Obama wants to be FDR of our time, he has only proven himself the democratic version of Hoover.
Obama is the democratic version of Herbert Hoover, Obamaville. Four years of Hillary is four more years of Obamaville.
Senior Republicans are falling out, rather to support Hill for the bill then stump for Trump. Calling for RepUnite.

@USNatArchives @HooverPresLib Yeah, Hooverville. Clinton to make another Hooverville history.
@NBCNews @billclinton looks like Big @WWETheBigShow only skinnier. Hahahha.

@FamousAnus223 @politico However I support him, because what he says is reality, period, end of story.
@FamousAnus223 @politico No doubt Trump is gonna fix the illegals up, but the % of illegals is high, therefore hate against Trump is high.
@FamousAnus223 @politico Question for you is do you know why I said that, and do you know how many illegals are in the US?
@FamousAnus223 @politico I do. I support Trump, what he says is reality. But what I said is also reality, illegals hate him.
@FamousAnus223 @politico Dems and Reps are fighting over this issue, Dems want to keep illegals in the US, Reps want them out.
@FamousAnus223 @politico Yeah, but their daughters and sons aren't.
@FamousAnus223 @politico I am a Trump supporter, so what's your point, he's got my support.
@FamousAnus223 @politico They can't vote, what about their sons and daughters, born and raised in the US?
@FamousAnus223 @politico Yeah, but this is the key issue of 2016 election, illegal immigrants are tied to the economy.
@FamousAnus223 @politico All I got to say is, FamousAnus223, face reality.
@FamousAnus223 @politico No doubt that I believe in him. But him saying that he's the best that ever happen to SS, that's false, alright.
@FamousAnus223 @politico My point is that SS will have to protect him 24/7, That is problematic, not the best thing for SS. He says it is.
@FamousAnus223 @politico Now that he said what's the reality is, SS will have to be more cautious in protecting him.
@FamousAnus223 @politico Reality is that illegals shouldn't be in the US, he's gonna do something about that.
@FamousAnus223 @politico How am I proven wrong? He talking reality, therefore loads of illegal immigrants are after him.
@FamousAnus223 @politico I am a heavy Trump supporter. So what is your point?
@FamousAnus223 @politico How am I proven wrong, much of what he says is reality, but also hate on one specific group of people.
@FamousAnus223 @politico but listen to me as your elder, the more we hate him, the more it proves we love him.
@FamousAnus223 @politico That is true that the US pop hates what he had to say.
@FamousAnus223 @politico And reality nowadays is what people hate to hear.
I am a Trump supporter, I am saying is that much of what he says is reality. https://t.co/GuYRV0BWfE
@politico since he feeding reality, much of the US pop must hate him, therefore creating problems for the SS to solve rather.
@politico This is the one other thing I disagree with Trump.
Hillary has picked Virginia former governor who also is a former senator as her vp pick. Good choice but doesn't change the game much.

@MutantMonkey2 @CNN That is also Clinton's strategy to lie and deceive.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Calling someone a racist is uncalled for until you see them actually in action. Walk and Talk are 2 different things.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Well, then I'll end it here, by saying I am all in for Trump, period, like it or not.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN I believe Clinton is much worse, after the Benghazi event.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN My point is the Clinton fam is liars. 	https://t.co/wjuemlHbEB	then 14 years later 	https://t.co/EBBgSe1Fg9
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Well, Clinton is BS as well, so it doesn't prove your point.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Clinton whole campaign was on lies as well.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Because his taxes are currently in audit.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN You didn't prove he lied, instance would be he didn't say he wasn't going to release his taxes, he says he can't.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Which candidate in history running for President has never lied?
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN The Dems are doing all the talk too, and no walk, so? Dems are actually making the economy much worse.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN And I do question, I don't sit around, I am not uneducated.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN How do you know he can't, are you the worm in his stomach?
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Again you didn't prove Trump a liar, good try though. I stump for @realDonaldTrump.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN The Dems, $15 min wage is only talk, let's see them walk.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN I have to say that there not one candidate that is pure. "Every raven in the sky is black."
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Basically you're getting it on his personal stuff, what I am talking about is political, Clinton's lies cause deaths.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Trump didn't he wouldn't release it, so how the hell is he lying there. He said he will release when audit is over.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN He didn't say he wouldn't provide it, he says he'll provide it when the auditing is over. That is no lie, reality check.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Audit is when IRS is checking your taxes to make sure you're not tax dodging.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN And do you know what an IRS audit is?
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN The national debt can be paid off little by little, dems rather not pay it, rather do other stuff with it.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN If you rather lies that cause death, I would wonder what kinda person you are. Every candidate lies a little.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Trump has began his walk yet, so how do you know? The Dems have, and look a $15 min. wage, talk is easy, do the walk.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Plain and simple, talk the talk is easy, let see the walk.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Well, the guy isn't in office yet. Clintons have been in there too long.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN How do you know he would not be able to? After all Dems got it for 8 years, and all they do is make problems in Asia.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN The economy is still in turmoil, Obama promised to fix it, and then look, even worse.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Clinton lies cost death, Trump's lies did not. Which would you rather have? Its Trump or Clinton. Pick Your Venom.
@MutantMonkey2 See that you're a never trump guy, but I am a stump for Trump guy. Being unrealistic and lying are two different things.
@MutantMonkey2 Point is all the things you're saying is basically him saying stuff that doesn't sound realistic.
@MutantMonkey2 Like Obama, returning all the troops, and in the end having to put more troops in Afghanistan.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Just like Obama won't release his birth certificate until the very end when he was forced to by public pressure.
@MutantMonkey2 Please clarify how trump is lying by saying he has to make products overseas. US factories are currently in other countries.
@MutantMonkey2 Clarifying my last statement, the US unemployment rates is obviously much higher than 45%.
@MutantMonkey2 45% is a little bit off, considering New York's unemployment is 9%. So get your facts straight.
@MutantMonkey2 Deport illegals and let them re-enter legally will solve the problem.
@MutantMonkey2 Illegals are taking jobs from America underlying the American system. That accounts for high unemployment of citizens.
@MutantMonkey2 How do you know he doesn't have a net worth of 10 Billion, please get the facts before you talk. He has businesses.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN Furthermore at the committee question of FBI Director, Comey unveiled Clinton's lies. This is reality check.
@MutantMonkey2 @CNN How's Trump lying, can you even prove it?
@CNN Its not believable, but at the least its do-able, and a liar for president is not what the country needs, no more lying dems.
