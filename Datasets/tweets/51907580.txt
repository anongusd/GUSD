There are many reasons why rapid transit is needed on the NShore. Often overlooked is the lack of access to Logan and the unbearable traffic congestion caused in large part by ‚¨ÜÔ∏è flights.

The time is now for expanded transit on the #NorthShore. Let your voices be heard! https://t.co/FkwPqdRZDK
