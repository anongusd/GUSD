@blackenterprise @Sifill_LDF 2 of 2: My recommendation is to leverage your greatest advocacy block ie. @CBCInstitute #CBC members of Congress to diversify the selection pool of candidates (the list that's been out since 2016 that a staffer could have easily worked on in preparation for this moment). #Tactic
