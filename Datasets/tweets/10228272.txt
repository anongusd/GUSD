@elijahdaniel @YTCreators @YTAdvertisers Hi—you can keep these ads from appearing by setting an ad exclusion for a specific advertiser URL, general ad content categories, or sensitive content categories. Here's the link: https://t.co/eF5JdYjrNG. We are looking at ways to improve our policies going forward.
@ChaseRoss Hi Chase. Re: ads, creators are not required to accept ads from groups they disagree with. You can set an ad exclusion for a specific advertiser URL, general ad content categories, or sensitive content categories. Here's the link: https://t.co/eF5JdYjrNG
@ChaseRoss We're constantly working to improve our systems and meet with a group of LGBTQ creators quarterly to find better ways to serve and support LGBTQ creators. We'd like to talk to you too—we will follow up! 3/3
@ChaseRoss We understand how these mistakes can hurt and make it appear we don’t support trans creators. Please know that we do deeply care about and support the trans community that's grown up on YouTube. 2/3
@ChaseRoss Hi, Chase. We’ll discuss more with you live but want to follow up here as well: To be super clear, our algorithm doesn't use LGBTQ-related words to trigger demonetization by themselves, and we are regularly evaluating our systems to avoid mistakes like the one we made here. 1/3

It’s taken us a long time to respond, but we’ve been listening to everything you’ve been saying. We know that the actions of one creator can affect the entire community, so we’ll have more to share soon on steps we’re taking to ensure a video like this is never circulated again.
We expect more of the creators who build their community on @YouTube, as we’re sure you do too. The channel violated our community guidelines, we acted accordingly, and we are looking at further consequences.
Suicide is not a joke, nor should it ever be a driving force for views. As Anna Akana put it perfectly: "That body was a person someone loved. You do not walk into a suicide forest with a camera and claim mental health awareness."
Like many others, we were upset by the video that was shared last week.
