VOTE
“You can be the generation that stood up at a critical moment and reminded us how powerful democracy can be. I will be there with you every step of the way." - @BarackObama
@ksccostello Yes!!
“People ask me what are you going to do for this election. No, the question is what are YOU going to DO” - @BarackObama
“If you do not like what is going, and you shouldn’t, don’t complain, hashtag...don’t boo-Vote” - @BarackObama
“The claim that everything will turn out okay, because there are people inside the White House who secretly aren’t following the president’s orders, that is not a check. I’m being serious here, that is not how our democracy is supposed to work.” - @BarackObama
“Fewer than 1 in 5 young people voted in the last midterms.  Is it any wonder this congress doesn’t reflect your values and your priorities?" - @BarackObama
“If you think elections don't matter I hope that the last two years will correct that impression!" - @BarackObama
“ With Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, without any checks or balances whatsoever, they’ve provided another $1.5 trillion in tax cuts to people like me, who I promise, don’t need it.” - @BarackObama
“We need more women in charge." - @BarackObama
@michaelsoy @BarackObama Indeed
“The civil rights act didn't end racism, but it made things better. Better is always worth fighting for." - @BarackObama
“It shouldn't be Democratic or Republican to say that we don't threaten the freedom of the press because they say things or publish stories we don't like." - @BarackObama
"I complained plenty about Fox News. But you never heard me threatening to shut them down or call them enemies of the people." - @BarackObama
"We’re supposed to stand up to bullies, not follow them!" "and we're sure as heck supposed to stand up to Nazi sympathizers" - @BarackObama
“Walls do not keep out threats like terrorism or disease” -@BarackObama
"It should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents” - @BarackObama
“What happened to the Republican Party? Its central organizing principle in foreign policy was the fight against Communism, and now they're cozying up to the former head of the KGB."  - @BarackObama
“Demagogues promise simple fixes to complex problems. No promise to fight for the little guy even as they cater to the wealthiest and most powerful." - @BarackObama
“It did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause. He's just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years, a fear and anger that’s rooted in our past but also borne of the tremendous upheavals that have taken place." - @BarackObama

@DeanObeidallah Remember: “I don’t care, do you?”
Donald Trump at joint presser with PM May:		"CNN is fake news. I don't take questions from CNN."		Trump then called on a Fox News reporter: "Let's go to a real network."
His definition of a dentist is literally different than everyone else on the planet. 		#PeterStrzokHearing #VoteThemOut2018 https://t.co/Tea3P8XKde
From Joshua Green’s book, “Devil’s Bargain”:		"You think you've gotta go on TV to talk to me? You treat me like a baby!" Trump said to Manafort.		"Am I like a baby to you? I sit there like a little baby and watch TV and you talk to me? Am I a f--king baby, Paul?"		#FridayThe13th https://t.co/QA82jGDitk

@Delores275 @morningmika @JoeNBC So many lies!

@MalcolmNance @Plot2Destroy Congrats!! Yay!
This 👀		The revelation that the Trump administration could essentially be kidnapping its own citizens was by far the most shocking finding. https://t.co/M0GmhHGcs5
While Trump is embarrassing us overseas with our NATO allies. We can not forget that his admin missed the court ordered deadline of reunifying babies &amp; toddlers they ripped away from their parents. We must keep fighting until everyone of the kids are reunited with their parents!
This is astounding.		It’s incredibly difficult to win a write-in campaign and to do it with out trying. 		The definition of a movement in action. https://t.co/wrXOOo1FlD

AMAZING NEWS: All 12 boys including their coach have been rescued.  #thaicaverescue 		This has been an incredible story to follow for 18 days. Glad that this part of the story ended with great news. We should not forgot that a rescue diver lost his life. May he Rest In Peace.

If you care about Votings Rights, now is the time to speak up. Call your US Senators, take to the streets to peacefully protest, than make your voices heard even louder by voting in November to stop the runaway Trump Administration.Everything is at stake! Everything! #SCOTUSPick https://t.co/hXpCVzoOQM
This is just awful. https://t.co/K9e0MT5wQi
Trump, you are behaving like a puppet for the Kremlin. Putin meddled with our 2016 elections which helped your awful candidacy. So now, you are awarding Putin with a solo meeting (only translators in the room) in the hopes of solidifying your teenage crush on him. https://t.co/Ultf1wJtRV

Reality check: Donald Trump is under  investigation.  He should not be allowed to make a #ScotusPick that will change the complexion of the court for decades and could play a major role in the investigation. This process is abnormal on so many levels. #resist https://t.co/R1lOGE59zI

A federal judge has turned down President Donald Trump's request to alter a decades-old legal settlement to allow long-term detention of children who entered the U.S. illegally with their parents.	#EndFamilyDetention https://t.co/nDXUELpRsN

Good, that’s what the U.S. should be doing.		How about the kids you cruelly ripped away from their parents, some were babies who were still breastfeeding. Your incompetent&amp; morally bankrupt admin has no clear plan to reunify the kids with their parents. Many parents deported. https://t.co/GoIqIOzuc3
Trump and Pence are both very clear on the priorities of this incredible dangerous administration. It’s self preservation above all else for them. https://t.co/Uwsclg0jcW

Could not have said it better myself. Ryan and McConnell own all of it. They have been enablers, picking party over country at every turn. Ryan retiring doesn’t absolve him of this fact, it only makes the argument stronger. https://t.co/HvxRMR3kux

Happily for the Kushner family, Jared was then admitted. But several officials at Jared’s high school outright told Golden that they found the choice puzzling, since his grades and academic record really didn’t seem to merit it: https://t.co/Q4qN6rtY0T
