Parents have one year, if they discovered the school is not fulfilling the IEP, to make a complaint. State complaint indicated they only required teachers to certified based on their guidelines, while Federal indicated that they defer back to the state. https://t.co/SNxguDJvyT
So when I was getting an IEP that did not address phonics, I was so perplexed as to why it seem like they did not get it. Even when I went to the State level and then to Federal. https://t.co/qeqRvSTcBx
The concept of teaching phonics have not change; technology confirms that there is a different wiring, which can be adjusted with a more structured approach. For example,  Learn how to play the piano with a teacher versus figuring it out solo.
Now I understand why my son's preschool Montessori teacher (GA) said that he would struggle if we did not put him in another Montessori school, when we moved to (HI). I did not realize phonics was what she was indicating. https://t.co/traHINdLIN

In 1970, when British left, they did so without a synergistic relationship.  The native Fijians did not play a critical role in ruling their country. China is there now, but the tension between the Natives and the Indians still looms.
As I got off the ship and met some of the natives, I shared their concern with the Fijians near me.  Coming from a large family, they just looked like family to me. I paid for a tour and was told how the natives own the land, yet lacked work &amp;   funds to make a living.
I took a cruise from Australia to Fiji some years back. As we arrived in the port, majority of the Europeans were very concerned because some many native Fijians were at the dock.

The data from the reading/math assessments was detailed: each question was analyzed by subject topic, mastery, and how the student's compared to their classmates. I also tried to find ways they could learn by doing, like drawing their own map to remember the regions.
We spent time building community, memorized/read poems, did a reader's theater, ensuring our sentences had the 5 key components. When it was time for 1st P/T conferences, I gathered the BOY assessments from the school's data, similar to what you get with a SAT score. https://t.co/4yGfmJTXH7
What concerned me was my mentor would look into my room and close the door.  I would have been very open to feedback: "...hey, we do it like this here" I knew I did something wrong by BEING SENT TO THE OFFICE.
Student surveys to get to know the students. Too strict there was anarchy. Too lenient and boys were wrestling. My goal was to find a happy medium and it was a lot of hit and misses through the first/second qtr. https://t.co/Rabjz6B8uI
With the help of the school technologist, I was able to use google forms to get the parents contact info.  Parents were wonderful with sharing their insight about their child via parent surveys. Nervous, but was excited to teach such a diverse group of students.
My HR manager said: "Who is going to write you an evaluation?" I do not know if it was her stalling or the process was time consuming, yet It took a while for my contract to be signed.  I had limited access to the school's database which I shared with my mentor via email.
My team made it clear that they had someone else they wanted on the team besides me.  That was okay, I reasoned, they would get to know me eventually realize I would work just as hard as anyone else.
Fast forward 20 years, with a degree and 2 children of my own. I worked for @fcpsnews. I had subbed the previous yr and was now super excited to have my own classroom, I was looking forward to planing out that year &amp; working with my team.
Most of my military awards came from improving systems that had a problem: missing evaluations, delayed travel claims, locating military journals. This was all before the days of automation.
The military people I worked with did not resist working with me: I respected their time and they respected I had a job to do.  As a result, I was awarded the JSCM.  no degree, no harassment  and the job was done! https://t.co/RkWBgHEL1S

@veganroundtable @ATDyslexia @cloth_mother After I took O-G training and tested my daughter, I found her phonological much lower than my sons, despite doing well in school.
@veganroundtable @ATDyslexia @cloth_mother My sons phonological needs are improving and we are working on affixes and vocabulary.
@veganroundtable @ATDyslexia @cloth_mother Our Apple computer helps with reading back text to the writer. I am learning more from your video -- thanks!
@veganroundtable @cloth_mother Yes, our Wilson reading tutor stated we would see the effects in high school/college when the demand will be too great for memory.

I share so others can be aware, to become a better educator, and for students to feel empowered to develop a growth mindset. #Dyslexia
When my daughter was in 2nd grade, she read over 100 AR books but could not produce nonsense words; I was not aware of what that meant.
As with my son, I went to SLP for articulation; it was not until college that a voice/diction class helped with my omission of word endings.
I wanted them reading because I struggled with writing; a college professor gave me two grades: 1 for analysis and 1 for syntax.
I read to my kids when they were in my womb, they have been surrounded by books, reading time at the library for preschoolers, etc.
As a mom when I found out my son had dyslexia, I searched the internet because school was not willing to address the issue.
