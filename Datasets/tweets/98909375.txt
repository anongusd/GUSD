In conclusion, Universal Basic Income (UBI) is an old idea getting new attention‚Äî but there are serious reasons to be cautious about its promises. We've listed the 5 reasons why UBI may not be the modern solution we need. Read more here: https://t.co/g6dTAGFQMA
6. Instead of pinning all hopes to UBI, policymakers should instead focus on ambitious policies that help Americans have the opportunity to earn a good life.
5. The idea has been scarcely tested. Only 1 of a handful of UBI experiments is relevant to the US economy, but the study is still in its early stages.
4. UBI could leave many disadvantaged Americans more vulnerable if programs they depend on are cut. One leading proposal eyes cuts to SNAP, EITC, and Section 8. In NYC that could leave a single parent with 3 kids $19,000/yr worse off.
3. UBI is incredibly expensive: A $12,000 annual UBI would cost the government $2.4 trillion every year. That‚Äôs roughly the cost of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, UI, and VA benefits.
2. As workers transition away from full-time work, UBI would shrink the labor force ‚û°Ô∏èslow GDP growth ‚û°Ô∏èand lower tax revenues to invest in American workers and the safety net.
1. UBI supporters fear work is vanishing. But jobs aren't disappearing‚Äî25 yrs after the digital revolution, the US economy employs 37M more people and has a record-high 6M job openings. The nature of work is changing.

With the modest, yet consistent, commitment to retirement #savings fostered by UP, workers and employers would create nest eggs worth well over half a million dollars for retiring middle-class couples.
UP will:	1. Require employers to contribute at least 50 cents per hour worked into a retirement account for every worker.	2. Give every worker without an employer plan an UP Account‚Äîmodeled after those for federal workers.
UP retirement will guarantee that every worker has both Social Security and a private, employer-fed #retirement account.
Today, nearly every worker in America has Social Security, but many in the middle and working classes are at risk of saving too little for a comfortable retirement. Universal Private (UP) retirement could be part of the solution. [thread]

With the Regional Minimum Wage, we can make low-wage and entry-level work pay while still setting the bottom wage at a level that won‚Äôt result in job loss.
The Regional Minimum Wage will:	1. Set a national average minimum #wage at $11.	2. For each geographic area in the U.S. adjust the federal minimum wage up or down based on local-area cost of living.	3. Index each minimum wage to average wage growth.
The Regional Minimum Wage increases wages nationwide but in a tailored way that‚Äôs sensitive to the micro-economies throughout the country.
The U.S. has one national #MinimumWage but hundreds of micro-economies. It‚Äôs no wonder lawmakers radically disagree on how much to raise it, leaving it stuck at $7.25 for more than a decade. So let's look at how a Regional Minimum Wage would change things [thread]

By addressing all 3 of these challenges together - the first weeks, year, and five years of raising a child - Paid Parental Flex will empower workers to earn and raise kids at the same time.
The Paid Parental Flex Plan will:	1. Provide federal parental leave #insurance of $600 per week	2. Encourage flexible work for 12 months by reimbursing half of employer-paid health premiums	3. Raise the Child Tax Credit to $5,000 for children under 5
That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre proposing a Paid Parental Flex Plan, to remove the penalties imposed on working parents so that families no longer have to choose between providing for their children and caring for them.
All types of families face a series of penalties in the workplace as they attempt to raise their kids. When new parents leave the #workforce (most often women), it can put them on a slower career trajectory that affects their earnings for the rest of their working lives.

The Working Wage Break will:	1. Exclude employee Social Security and Medicare tax on the first $15,000 earned	2. Raise the individual standard deduction to $15,000	3. Recoup all revenue for Social Security, Medicare trust funds with modest rate increases
A Working Wage Break will eliminate all taxation on the first $15,000 of earned income to boost the return on work.

It‚Äôs 1 of 3 ways we propose to reinvent postsecondary education and skills. See the others in our Social Contract for the Digital Age. #OpportunityToEarn https://t.co/SPYeKucP9X
Over the past 2 centuries, we established free primary and secondary #education and public two- and four-year colleges in every state. Now, we must add the missing piece, making apprenticeships a ubiquitous part of our educational system.
Apprenticeship America will:	1. Finance 100 Apprenticeship Hubs that connect employers, schools, and unions to new apprentices. 	2. Create a new Federal Apprenticeship Loan, to help employers get new #apprenticeships off the ground.
Apprenticeship America will create one million new training positions to fill these targeted gaps and give workers the opportunity to earn while they learn.
The #skills acquired by U.S. workers do not match the needs of our employers. Apprenticeships are a clear solution: Employers can fill targeted gaps, and workers can earn while they learn. But in the U.S. today, apprenticeships are shockingly scarce.

The innovation surge can be fully financed in a way that actually further helps American manufacturing jobs: by ending perverse loopholes in the Trump tax law that entice companies to produce overseas.
The Innovation Trust Fund will:	1. Ensure $200 billion in additional federal #innovation funding over 10 years	2. Expand the R&amp;D tax credit to commercialize new innovations
That‚Äôs why we need an Innovation Trust Fund: a 10-year surge of public and private R&amp;D financed by ending the offshore tax bias so that 21st-century products are invented and manufactured in America.
The most fundamental ingredient for good-paying American #manufacturing jobs of the future is American innovation. But America‚Äôs innovative edge is eroding because DC has defunded its most critical ingredient‚Äîscientific research. [THREAD] https://t.co/rqO8hJaH6w

That‚Äôs 1 of 3 big ideas that can reinvent postsecondary education and skills in America. #OpportunityToEarn https://t.co/SPYeKucP9X
With RI, labor productivity and workforce participation would rise. Most critically, it would transform unemployment from a safety net into a springboard to work.
RI will provide:	1. Income support during unemployment	2. Grants for certified, short-term training programs for in-demand jobs	3. Moving vouchers for those choosing to relocate for work
So we‚Äôre proposing to replace Unemployment Insurance with Reemployment Insurance (RI): a new system that provides not only temporary income but also grants for training or vouchers for moving.
New jobs being created are dramatically different than the ones going away. Disrupted workers badly need help acquiring new skills, navigating the complex job market, or moving to new opportunity if that‚Äôs what they choose. https://t.co/hId4AXF7qJ

@lukefuszard A trend we've seen across the U.S. (see our American Investment Bank thread) and a big reason why we need a new economic message.
The #OpportunityToEarn a good and secure life is what Americans want for themselves and their families. Democrats must create a new social contract that makes this goal a reality for all Americans.
Democrats‚Äô defining #economic cause should be combating the devastating concentration of opportunity in America. Simply put: Too many people in too many places believe that they and their children do not have the #OpportunityToEarn a good life.
The American Investment Bank is just one way to reimagine investment in good-paying jobs. See more ideas in our Social Contract for the Digital Age! #OpportunityToEarn https://t.co/SPYeKucP9X
All of AIB‚Äôs investments will be backed by the federal government, but none will be selected in DC. Participating banks and local investors will select ventures with additional incentives for locations and populations bypassed by opportunity.
The American Investment Bank will:	1. Expand government guarantees of private small business loans	2. Promote, capitalize, and support new community development venture capital funds in underserved areas
So we‚Äôre proposing the American Investment Bank: A new public fund that backs small and medium business loans and investments so that risk capital is available to millions more entrepreneurs.
In 2/3 of U.S. counties, there are fewer businesses up and running today than there were a decade ago. It‚Äôs not a lack of ideas that‚Äôs the problem. It‚Äôs a lack of capital. https://t.co/Gp2nPTNxF3

Even with very good planning and coverage, family caregivers still face uncovered expenses. Long-term care insurance &amp; Medicaid leave gaps and are inadequate to offset caregiving expenses. (4/4)
Family caregiving has become a widespread and financially challenging responsibility, and while it‚Äôs a basic cost of living like parenting, caregiving costs are not supported by the tax code. (3/4)
The number of family caregivers is not keeping pace with demographic changes. And without family caregiving, the health &amp; well-being of individuals would be worse and costs would be higher. (2/4)
We need a comprehensive strategy that enables communities to improve their support for family caregivers. (thread) https://t.co/macODkfTNR
