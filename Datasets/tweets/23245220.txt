@damirperge thanks. But it wasn't bravery. It was the realization that I was taking my power into my own hands. Being "fixed" liberated me.

@Thegr8Kadazmo What if we smiled because we saw the same beautiful person in both bodies?
@Thegr8Kadazmo What if we could move beyond reacting to "cute". What if we we're afraid of what the adult said back?
