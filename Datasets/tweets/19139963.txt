@PMEthiopia @fitsumaregaa Events in #Ethiopia are being watched to see if new regime is different than crooks in the previous regime.  A major positive step in right direction was made by Judge Kedir who stopped sale of stolen property, the National Alcohol Liquor Factory (NALF).

@clementine1901 @hrintuitive serious communication with my constituents 4 many years. Feel free 2 run next time &amp; see with whom they agree
@hi_its_kari @IndivisibleCA48 I am totally open about what I believe. u may disagree with my conclusions, but it is from honest assessment
@IndivisibleCA48 @niosha @TheFix @indivisible_oc the debate is over. u lost. Next election cycle U get another chance.
@burchrhodes @rbwilson so did you miss the debate with my opponent. I was at numerous public events in last four months. Election is over.
@soleilani @dombek13 I don‚Äôt know it. If Fed $ given to an abortionist it is irrelevant that other services are provided.
@niosha @TheFix @indivisible_oc it‚Äôs blatant.if U disagree then you Should oppose ID necessary 4 licenses,4 vet benefits, 4 gun purchase ect
@hi_its_kari @hfrankly I have not seen details of all of them. So I can only say I agree with most of those I am aware of
@hi_its_kari @hfrankly I suggest U google to find lots of my interviews on this issue. It does not lend itself to short answer
@hi_its_kari @hfrankly water boarding was issue.special forces troopers undergo it as part of training. It should be used on terrorists
@niosha @TheFix @indivisible_oc that pathetic case not indicative of major fraud,unlike Dems insisting  NO PHOTO ID, enabling illegal voting
@niosha @SheilaGinHB @womensmarch @NAACP Ya think being holiday season &amp; start of new Congress could have made it harder to get appointment
@hfrankly U know where I stand. I argue my case.Unless U believe honest people can disagree that can be disconcerting.Too much name calling
@tptotpltotprlit @hi_its_kari @dombek13 I would rather U see my point of view than a part of my body
@rbwilson our next will take place when Congress more into legislative process. time chosen when max number home. All reg voters called.
@hi_its_kari @IndivisibleCA48 R U just now educating Urself on those issues? Yes, I am a national advocate on number of significant issues
@hi_its_kari @IndivisibleCA48 Y R U unaware Of my leadership role in opposing amnesty which would increase of flood of illegals into USA
@hi_its_kari @dombek13 OK ignore question about forcing those opposed to pay for abortions. R minority abortions more likely if gov pays?
@dombek13 do U believe those who believe abortion is taking life of baby should be forced to pay for abortions?
@SheilaGinHB @womensmarch @NAACP constituents dneeding assistance make appointments&amp;meet in District office everyday.    Ur antics expose U
@ukayer @justnisdead @gidgetgirlhb thanks 4 respect, I‚Äôm obliged to do what I indicated in  last election, if Not that needs explaining
@TheFix if he is totally  wrong if he claims  GOP doesn‚Äôt want to take steps like demanding photo ID, to prevent voter fraud
@hrintuitive once legislation in  process of becoming law public needs to know how their Rep votes to decide keep or replace next election
@hrintuitive We have just completed the discussion cycle. It is called the election. now is  the time to implement what decided in election
@justnisdead @gidgetgirlhb what I believe right as expressed in the campaign guides my legislative  decisions in this secession of Congress
@ZetaHeiter not sure what the schedule will permit. my town halls go directly to my constituents phone, &amp; usually have thousands on line
@Badawyyia @IndivisibleCA48 The slaughter of unarmed civilians here &amp; Europe by Islamic fanatics should not be ignored by US policy.
@gidgetgirlhb is it arrogant or silly 4 a constituent with opposing views to tell official, just reelected by a large majority, to move on
@Lala_LaurenAnn I respect all people by telling the truth even though it gets some people mad at me. Pointing out inconsistency is proper
@DorisJuneHB @woodsey_allen @IndivisibleCA48 info is now emerging that Ukraine gov was targeting Trump. The whole thing is phony issue
@alexsmathews we don‚Äôt want radicals driven by theology &amp; fanaticism 2 enter our country. Procedures &amp; tests should be used to keep them out
@mosesthegolden1 @IndivisibleTeam @govtrack vulgarity suggests a lack of intelligence coupled with arrogance. Y do U use it 2 express Urself
@soleilani @Indivisibleca30 @IndivisibleCA48 tweets R about whatever participants focus on. I focused on hypocrisy of anti-trump feminists
@woodsey_allen @IndivisibleCA48 yep, needs to be an investigation into voter fraud, including organizing illegal aliens to vote
@Indivisibleca30 @IndivisibleCA48 how could U support clearly corrupt Clintons, even after Bill‚Äôs rape victim described Hillary covering up
@niosha @ShannonBrooke01 @indivisible_oc I believe voter fraud extensive, an investigation should prove that one way or other
@abushofghosts nope
@ShannonBrooke01 yes
@oc_moni @In4mdCndn oh so U stuck with the candidate who facilitated the coverup of the crimes of her serial rapist husband
@ShannonBrooke01 yes
@DrMichelleSays @KarenABCDEFG a liar told that lady I didn‚Äôt believe Hispanics should have pride in their race.Only that was misrepresented
@DrMichelleSays leading Cong fight to legalize marijuana
@KarenABCDEFG thanks 4 agreeing with me that Hispanics, &amp; everyone else, should be proud of their race. Lib/left disagrees
@DrMichelleSays why not question specific point rather than dismissing those who disagree, which takes no understanding or knowledge base
@ericwhatchaneed  U should try to aggressively state Ur opinion without profanity. Otherwise people think U R arrogant or ignorant or both
@Garrett42618594 @eliasatalah @KamalaHarris @biannagolodryga yes what stinks is the on-going drive promoting WAR with Russia
@chanelle927 now that reply had substance
@chanelle927 heck if U R going to call names at least U could be a Little creative about it
@Jaccuse1 Ur level of intelligence clear to everybody who saw Ur vulgar proclamation as to the nature of my being
@eliasatalah @KamalaHarris @biannagolodryga to bad your description of my confrontation with Brianna is Not consistent with reality
@stuartglick just as many without health insurance now as before Obamacare, only quality&amp; cost 4 everyone now is way up from what it was
@stuartglick obviously US healthcare needs improving, but it is better than most of the others. Obamacare has made situation worse
@stuartglick
@stuartglick Obama himself guaranteed Am people what he knew to be impossible. Such lies are the worst kind of dirty trick. Now round two
@stuartglick U  seem to be the personification of a dirty trick. Weren‚Äôt Obama‚Äôs lies about ACA enough
@ConservativeJQP Russia, like US, targeted by Rad IslamicTerrorists. Ru backs Egypt &amp; wants 2 work with us, we exaggerate Ru flaws&amp;shun them
@ConservativeJQP compared to China, Russia transformed since it was Soviet Union. There R opposition parties, public demonstrations, &amp; flaws
@ConservativeJQP China has had no political liberalization,no opposition parties, no unions, forced abortion,&amp; massive territorial claims
@jdwynnyckyj @PaulNiland any harm done by Yano signing Ru Econ deal could have been undone by next election.Instead violence led to violence
@jdwynnyckyj @PaulNiland I have spoken to Ukr of all stripes. EU &amp; US pushed Ukr into violent confrontation from which there was no return
@ConservativeJQP parts of Serbia have Kosovar majority&amp;vice versa. Borders should be realigned so Serbs live in Serbia &amp; Kosovars in Kosovo
@ConservativeJQP that is why immigration important. If a majority legally residing in an area want to be part of Mexico. adios Texas
@ConservativeJQP like in Am Revolution, if majority of people in a specific border area want to out or to be new country that is their right
@Garrett42618594 the info on which U base Ur views is selected by people who hate Ru 4 sins committed by Ru when it was communist, Soviet
@emanddaughters @indivisible_oc no other Congressman engages as much. Perhaps one needs a bit more open minded to recognize it
@jdwynnyckyj @PaulNiland I have no doubt he was rotten but It was those opposed to Yano who destroyed Ukr democracy encouraged by EU &amp; USA
@jdwynnyckyj @PaulNiland Yano was elected &amp; been defeated by voters but EU conspired to trash Democratic process &amp; violently force him out
@mtighe15 @SenJohnMcCain @LindseyGrahamSC @MitchMcConell did U bother to check any of the many indications that the Clinton‚Äôs broke the law
@JAY_PEEZUS @MimiWaltersCA @RepEdRoyce so you represent ‚Äúthe people‚Äù Ya think anyone out there who disagrees with U might make same claim?
@IndivisibleCA48 @ocregister @latimes @TheDailyPilot because they rarely ask,but I usually comply with a specific request
@jsreveille there is enough common ground, mutually beneficial cooperation we can start there. Late make rational compromise from both
@odinsspyd people pushing War with Russia R lying or exaggerating: no Ru military aggression in Baltics. Human rights like half our allies
@MonicaMaravilla Monica,  thanks for offering specific challenges rather than just calling names. Good job.
@MonicaMaravilla a number of Ru journalists murdered,because they dug up corruption, Whether it is Putin or local officials is question,
@MonicaMaravilla yes we bomb cities and invalid countries
@MonicaMaravilla do U know the so-called political opponent was high level Ru I nteligence officer in the process of defecting
@MonicaMaravilla guess Our gov doesn‚Äôt bug phones, hack computers or send our military into other counties. Oh yes, we never bomb cities
@MonicaMaravilla if that is what U call Putin. How do U define war criminal in a way that does not include most US Presidents?
@ConservativeJQP @Ronald_Spitzer @danyval8902 @OANN @YouTube if majority votes for independence in Scotland, Catalonia or Crimea, it‚Äôs OK
@skrutsick my base not rich but hard working Americans.All the big $ interests &amp; billionaires supported Hillary
@skrutsick OK if what I do inconsistent with values of my voting constituents I lose... but every time such claims R made, voters reelect me
@ConservativeJQP @Ronald_Spitzer @danyval8902 @OANN majority in Crimea positive about Ru. Not the case in other areas occupied after WWII
@ConservativeJQP @Ronald_Spitzer @danyval8902 @OANN Baloney, people in Baltic states hate Ru because for years Soviets murdered them
@skrutsick right! I do what I think right rather than  put my ear to ground or let a wet finger in the air.determine. My voters respect that
@IndivisibleCA48 I am accessible to my constituents &amp; will remain so. If U think my election victory reflects a lack of voter info:WRONG
@indivisible_oc dream on.
@IndivisibleCA48 @skrutsick sorry lib/leftists claiming 2 represent my constituents Ignore that 2 of 3 voters here consistently vote 4 me
@skrutsick U repeat same self aggrandizing threats I have heard from lib/left for 30 years. My voters have mutual respect 4 each other
@Ronald_Spitzer @danyval8902 @OANN @YouTube only citizens of Crimea should determine status of Crimea
@danyval8902 @Ronald_Spitzer @OANN @YouTube a second&amp; final referendum  monitored by OSCE should let people of Crimea decide future
@CanningCooke @Ronald_Spitzer @OANN @YouTube close Ur eyes, shut Ur mind &amp; blame Ru for what EU &amp; US did in UKr.
@jdwynnyckyj if it was a Nazi coup it had the support of US &amp; EU. That is what created the chaos in UKr. Am people clueless to this travesty
@jdwynnyckyj we sent nuclear weapons carrying ships &amp; B-52s to the Ru border turning around at last minute.&amp; now we add thousands of troops
@jdwynnyckyj EU &amp; US orchestrated violent overthrow of elected UKr president precipitated Ru intervention.What does US do in such situations
@Ronald_Spitzer @OANN @YouTube Baltic hatred of Ru understandable. Sending US tanks &amp;  nuclear bombers to Ru/Baltic border now hostile act
@Ronald_Spitzer @OANN @YouTube Look closer,Georgia broke truce Ru retaliated. In Ukr EU &amp; US conspired in violent coup against elected gov
@cawilliamson we hack,bug &amp;politically interfere globally,last yr caught bugging Merkle.attacking Putin 4 this billigerent &amp;pure hypocrisy
@Ronald_Spitzer @OANN @YouTube no Ru military actions taken against Baltics or any Euro country. US spending $billions more ridiculous
@cawilliamson I am chairman of the congressional committee that oversees our relations with Russia. Talking to our Ru counterparts is good.
@cawilliamson sorry, Ur conversation just slipped into word game playing.
@cawilliamson I do not SUPPORT Putin. His gov has done unacceptable things but much claimed is based on double standard or Just not true.
@auburn_mike @BreitbartNews so U support Rubios efforts to have a war between Russia and US. I do not &amp; will continue to oppose it
@kbaxter going to bed now. Thanks for conversation
@kbaxter spent all my life fighting communism. Helped Reagan beat them. Now appalled to see systematic attempt to push us into new Cold War
@kbaxter propaganda campaign against Ru intense and unrelenting. Someone wants war. We have pushed military bases right to their borders.
@kbaxter Ru is a major power. It has interests. We have ours. Judging them with double standard undermines cooperation against common enemy
@kbaxter  so detail acts of Ru military aggression in Baltics. Do U believe EU &amp; US not involved in violent ousting Ukraine‚Äôs elected gov?
@kbaxter In past r&amp; even today many of our allies have far worse records than Putin‚Äôs Ru, but we had a common enemy, as Rad Islam is today
@kbaxter Not an apologist, but refuse to hypocritically condemn Ru 4 hacking, bugging or interfering in other countries when it is SOP 4 US
@kbaxter really, what did U say Ur credentials R that makes It acceptable to label I gnorant &amp; pathetic someone  as active as I have been?
@kbaxter why exaggerate misdeeds &amp; label Ru EVIL 4 doing what US has been doing 4 decades,unless Ur goal is war with the Ru U hate so much
@cawilliamson so when someone disagrees you automatically think they R immoral
@RevDJEsq if you really believe that, you are a fool
@kbaxter cooperation with Putin‚Äôs Ru needed 2 defeat Rad Islam. exaggerating  regime flaws will make them our enemy not ally in this fight
@clickclack1 Ru should not have invaded Ukr. EU should not have orchestrated violent overthrow of elected gov of Ukr. Crimeans should vote.
@XSovietNews @ReaganBattalion one can make waves or ride waves
@erinalibrarian @DiamondTrimOC if U need to ask U need to open your mind. The issue is only abortion, not availability of health services
@TCassa89 Jeff clear he will enforce the law. Don‚Äôt forget Rohrabacher/Farr, mandates Feds not supersede state medical mj laws, is fed law
@JenWey did U support Hillary knowing she covered Bill‚Äôs sexual assaults? If U did please don‚Äôt act outraged at what another politico said
@DebLimaBean fed policy been: taxpayers provide med services but not abortions, because honest people disagree if abortion=taking human life
@Garrett42618594 @DiamondTrimOC dismissing a fact like thousands of clinics available to women with a snide personal remark doesn‚Äôt cut it
@Passoonn @BillMendocino result was Soviets driven out of Afgh &amp; Taliban driven out of power. Yes US made mistakes after achieving war goals
@DiamondTrimOC There R thousands of clinics providing women vital medical service, but not abortion. Planned Parenthood insists on abortions
@BillMendocino @Passoonn blow all U want. with Muj fighting Soviets &amp; my part in creating Northern Alliance to defeat Taliban well known
@Garrett42618594 I enjoy challenging exchanges. Others R vulgar&amp; or calling names &amp; some even I hired to make personal attacks.I block them
@gbmnyc U seem to have overlooked that I chair the congressional cmttee that oversees US-Russian policy.
@socalbyrd @HBRefugee read tweet, not somebody‚Äôs interpretation. Yes, 	Leftist neo-fascists targeted force&amp;violence against Trump supporters
@socalbyrd @HBRefugee U mean when I call people to task, even constituents, 4 false claims based on their own self serving interpretations
@kevintripp a constituent? To answer U anyway: mechanical problems delayed my early morning flight from LAX. arrived in D.C.about midnight
@socalbyrd @HBRefugee who taught U the distasteful &amp; dishones tactic of incorrectly summarizing statements those who disagree.
@singhKing1947 Surat, you are a dear friend and an American Patriot. More good things to do this year. Now we have a chance. Dana
@HBRefugee I enjoy dialogue, but sometime find an encounter depressing it‚Äôs detached inane responses.your retorts fit into that category
@HBRefugee cowardly, disagree with me all U want but no Democrat or Republican in the House claims I lack the strength of my convictions.
@HBRefugee my constituents reject neonazi libs which is why I have been winning my elections last here last 26 years
@HBRefugee the Nazi like Libs R not criticized by lib establishment in my district or elsewhere
@Vikshtrum @LibertySeeds Ur vulgarity reflects Ir ignorance &amp; arrogance
@taxmary1 i‚Äô i‚Äôve heard this uneducated position before
@wmfnichols Does the US hack foreign  computers, YES, only we keep from the people whose gov we hacked the info.?
@LibertySeeds With their street thugs disrupting opposition rallies, beating up Trump supporters &amp;teachers spouting propaganda. Same as Nazi
@ConservativeJQP the controls, arrests, jailing of opposition has reached a threshold: Turkey isno longer a free country.
@PangeaDC @RepTomPrice @JackKingston @NeilWMcCabe Tom Price is an unrelenting fighter. We R lucky to have someone of such caliber in cabinet
@tristan14532 @timwillette2007 I blame Siri for all spelling errors
@JamesKahrs @SebGorka @NeilWMcCabe @DaysOfTrump @JackKingston absolutely right
Turkish people now being robbed of their freedom
@quicomalparit Am founding fathers(&amp;smothers)struggled for liberty &amp; self determination.The people of Catalonia now face the same challenge
@bikejourno Ru wrong for prosecuting bloggers, but is no different than many other US allies. Cut the double standard
@Briseida_Elenes @tweetinglavoz how long will take to bankrupt USA if education &amp; healthcare provided to anyone who gets here legally or not
@FaridYFarid @LockheedMartin notice contributions to my campaign R far less than what most Cal Dems get. Do you have a double standard?
@RyanSmith_OC if Palestinians violate two state solution by launching rockets&amp; refusing to give up right of return, why condemn Israel?
@Briseida_Elenes @tweetinglavoz not using scarce tax $ providing services to those here illegally is hugely popular in my district.
@mosh426 @kdeleon @realDonaldTrump offshore drilling much safer than getting oil from a tanker
@JanetLevinson1 @SenBobCorker @SenTomCotton @SenJoniErnst @DarrellIssa @SenatorIsakson @SenatorSessions @WSJ that is likely to happen
@Passoonn Afghan =major ethnic groups tied to bordering countries. Centralizing power in Kabul creates conflict.
@Passoonn they were fighting each other because Saudis &amp; PAKs blocked return of former king,beloved moderate who could have unified country
@Passoonn mujahdeen coalition of existing ethnic &amp; tribal leaders,Warlords. After suffering Taliban tyranny they became Northern Alliance
@Passoonn ethnic &amp; tribal leaders primary force throughout Afghan history. Taliban created by Saudis &amp; PAKs to control&amp; radicalize Afghans.
@timwillette2007 @POTUS Sometime we‚Äôll have a discussion instead of debate. Time for bed.
@timwillette2007 U claim Obama as champion of deportation is he Nazi-like? So what nation does not deport illegal immigrants?All Nazis?
@timwillette2007 my message not garbled. U  contradict Urself: immigration hardliners R like Hitler, claim Obama hardliner &amp; U like Obama
@timwillette2007 Sure U can compare those who disagrees with U 2 Hitler,but U can‚Äôt explain Y U like Obama if his deportation record so good
@timwillette2007 so you believe Obama has been lying.that he has been stamping out sanctuary cities and refusing gov benefits to illegals,
@timwillette2007 Obama brought in millions of illegals.If U were right liberal/left would compare him 2 Hitler instead of singing his praise
@timwillette2007 try comparison to most other Nations which brutally deport  illegals. Picking Nazi is an ad hominin not refutation
@timwillette2007 Ur name calling response exposes a sever limitation of your ability defend your beliefs. Calling somebody a nazi= ignorant
@timwillette2007 calling somebody a Nazi rather than dealing with issue of limited $, attracting millions more, which hurts Americans: shame
@Passoonn wrong! So-called War Lords leaders of regional ethnic groups and clans. Taliban are religious fanatics.
@Passoonn wrong! It takes men on ground to win. Soviet army beat by mujahideen(who later became Northern Alliance)with no air support.
@JamesKahrs @NeilWMcCabe @JackKingston @DaysOfTrump this military waste is common.Check out $400 billion to develop F-35. It must be fixed
@timwillette2007 so U want to provide those here illegally education,healthcare etc.  so others with families will  flood here &amp; bankrupt us
@kevintripp no one should support Hezbollah, as Obama just did in UN. Russia &amp; Syria need to reject rotten partners &amp; so should US
@georgeiosifyan don‚Äôt know anything about it
@midliferider @mitchellreports no one, including Hillary, has claimed otherwise.So we R treated 2 spectacle of lib/left protesting discloser
@randylichner @MJINews @GOP this is a freedom/personal responsibility issue. protect kids but  adults should be free to run their own lives
@ConservativeJQP I will have to look at it. It will have to be reintroduced next year
@kevintripp no crutch, election is over, who‚Äôs worse hacker disclosing truth or Hillary destroying subpoenaed e-mails to hide information
@kevintripp Would like 2 know if U think hacker providing us factual info is worse than Hillary destroying subpoenaed e-mails to hide truth
@LAEB5Developer @realDonaldTrump will look closely at specific proposal
@BlackBelted why when Russia a commie dictatorship did lib/left bad mouth Reagan 4 being tough now insist being belligerent &amp; hostile to Ru
@ThJohnsonNPS if my harsh response was inaccurate I apologize. Having worked with anti Taliban forces I am aware Ur statement was wrong
@kevintripp hope  Hope U R consistent &amp; support criminal investigation of Hillary‚Äôs destruction of Subpoenaed E-mails.
@BlackBelted @biannagolodryga @Peggynoonannyc I am not an ass nor apologist. I just don‚Äôt have Double standard in judging Russia.
@real_paul_allen It was wrong 4 Serbs 2 destroy Croatian Catholic Churches &amp; Kosovar Mosques &amp; wrong  4 anyone 2 destroy Serb churches now
@kevintripp @sullydish BS I not only condemned that attack but I was engaged in President Reagan‚Äôs response. R U paid to make stupid claims
@real_paul_allen @ThJohnsonNPS To ethnically cleanse &amp; rule Balkans,20 yrs ago Serbs burned Croatian Catholic Churches &amp; Mosques in Kosovo.
@real_paul_allen @ThJohnsonNPS 20 yrs ago Serbs engaged bloody supresson of independence of Roman Catholic Croatians &amp; Muslim Kosovars
@ConWebWatch @cnsnews foreign or domestic election meddling providing accurate info less important than Hillary destroying supeneod e-mails
@earlyelliott @CAGOP Assad,like other Middleeast regimes would do,is brutally putting down insurrection. He has given Christians safe haven
@BlackBelted @yashar @biannagolodryga @Peggynoonannyc notice my‚Äùbaloney‚Äù referred to putting Russia &amp; China in same human rights category
@AntiTru79869670 @StevePh49215783 @albreeh how creative of U. Unfortunately Ur ignorance &amp; name calling still noticeable
@ThJohnsonNPS Anyone pushing that BS must be a agent of Rad Islam. Northern Alliance defeated the Taliban and other Radicals.
@MikeySunshine more name calling. Too bad U are intellectually unable to argue Ur case without such personal jabs
all on the record, I played major roll organizing resistance to Taliban.Then after 9-11 they became Northern Alliance that defeated Taliban
@chris_wip not now, but I did until surfing wore away all the cartilage in my shoulders, one of which I just replaced
@albie401 @mitchellreports @MSNBC sorry Ur vocabulary is so limited U have to use foul language to make a point
@StevePh49215783 @albreeh @AntiTru79869670 Ur lack of info clear. Cal redistricting done by independent commission.
OK expose Trump taxes but don‚Äôt back Hillary destroying under subpoena of evidence of wrong doing.
@ArtistCal I appreciate being appreciated
@sanford943 Hillary‚Äôs  e-mails were under subpoena. If mine are subpoena I will gladly give them up and if hacked won‚Äôt feel threatened
@SueSmith587 @mitchellreports @MSNBC yes, now U quit supporting Hillary‚Äôs coverup of wrong doing by destroying under subpoena e-mails
@LibNewsDaily @kevintripp That is correct. I am consistent &amp; U R not
@albreeh @AntiTru79869670 Boy=Wow Ur onslaught of vile &amp; hatred toward others is the kind of intolerance &amp; negativity that pollutes twitter
@albreeh @AntiTru79869670 my constituents know I surf &amp; tweet &amp; reelected me by large margins.Such obnoxious personal jabs don‚Äôt cut it
@albreeh yes, I have more traditional view of marriage, however, leaving it up to states or just getting gov out of marriage OK with me
@FloridaGal0814 spineless? U R the only one who ever claimed that
@albreeh OK U have no idea what my record is or U wouldn‚Äôt say such nonesense. So I will list a few for U in next tweet.
@AntiTru79869670 boy are U an accomplished name caller. To bad your energy is being wasted on personal attacks and reigniting the Cold War
@scurtainrod no one I am aware of claims the material hackers released is inaccurate misinformation. who told U that,or you just make it up?
@albreeh @HBRefugee @MichaelMoncure @AJDelgado13 my, my I thought U were criticizing me for having a closed mind.
@doeshecook @kevintripp Reagan ended the Cold War. The Lib/left hated him and now they are trying to reignite the Cold War.
@24AheadDotCom_ anyone providing Am people truthful info, known to our adversaries, is doing US voter a service.
@HBRefugee @MichaelMoncure @AJDelgado13  Over years I admitted errors in judgement &amp; changed position on several major issues, how about U?
@thisisjmp any more info about Hillary Ud like to keep from Am voters? Our lib/left media, fixated on bringing Trump down, unreliable
@kevintripp I don‚Äôt know who provided it but it resulted in true information reaching the voters so the source is not significant
@FloridaGal0814 Ur vulgar name calling  reflects ignorance and arrogance. Always happy when critics like U expose themselves
@albreeh if U ignored Hillary‚Äôs decades long coverup of Bill‚Äôs rapes &amp; molestations Ur outrage of Trumps swagger not convincing
@albreeh @billmaher Ur vulgarity reflects arrogance &amp; intelligence. Ur name calling hurts Ur cause not mine
@albreeh if you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, my detailing it won‚Äôt open Ur eyes.
@albreeh use language that reflects well on you. Then direct Ur attention to HILLARY who‚Äôs been breaking law &amp; getting away with it 4 yrs
@MichaelMoncure @AJDelgado13 @BrittPettibone dismissing rather than refuting argument indicates ignorance &amp; arrogance on part of dismisser
@broncofisch R U sure U‚Äôve read both sides of the issues &amp; know all the significant facts?
@kcordell1 Take a closer look. Powerful forces here R pushing us toward war with Russia, or at least a new Cold War.That isn‚Äôt the way to go
@I_zaaq @AJDelgado13 that is what the USA does and it is the wrong thing to do
@Leedleladle did not say that
My latest op-ed on Russia: https://t.co/NMuRwPIF85
@yashar @biannagolodryga Joe labeled a lie my challenge to his question‚Äôs premise.Yet his guests refuted his charge Nothing done by US
@bryguy2729 @Morning_Joe @MSNBC which is better than having the Nazis and Japanese militarists dominating the entire world
@BasicKoell @AJDelgado13 we must focus our efforts, not just on repressive regimes, but on the enemy who will mass murder Americans.
@GrabienMedia I threaten to walk when I was rudely interrupted five seconds into my first answer, as happened last time on that channel
@CliffJWilkinson I appreciate being appreciated. Thanks
@mohdkhan @hammalhaidar @Johnny5024 @fireboy01111 @tomkawczynski yes, people of Kashmir have right to a referendum to determine status
@wilthahwa thanks for sending the article. I read it and I am certain that it reflects something that needs reform in that country
@MarsInsider I guess U‚Äôve studied issues &amp; options enough to use profanity in dismissing those who disagree rather making a serious retort
@dianeneve53 @biannagolodryga I am the Congress #1 advocate of the eradication of Rad Islamic Terrorism, what more do U want?
@TessEractica that was a very creative jab
@appalachiaheart @biannagolodryga @YahooNews she didn‚Äôt ask tough question she just interrupted when the answer was being given
@jvarada this option could end an on-going conflict. Russians &amp; others may want to take it for practical reasons
@MikeySunshine @stuartglick claim person ‚Äúhas a long history of racism &amp; xenophobia‚Äù is labeling.question then who is an‚Äúilliterate crony‚Äù
@stuartglick putting labels on those who disagrees with U reflects combination of ignorance and arrogance. Y not argue specific issues
@jvarada so if Crimea is solidly in RU camp then letting them verify it against in a totally transparent won‚Äôt do harm &amp; could do much good
RT @MatthewTyrmand: Potential Sec'y of state selfie w/foreign policy maven &amp; totally unique House member (CA-48) @DanaRohrabacher. Really g‚Ä¶
@balkan_princeza @Johnny5024 U R just dead wrong, I opposed what Serbs did to Croats &amp; Kosovars 3 decades ago, today I am their best friend
@balkan_princeza @Johnny5024 Opposing Serbian subjugation of Croatians &amp; Kosovars in past doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not Serbia‚Äôs best friend today
@balkan_princeza Despite ur name calling, since Serbs quit genocide against Croats &amp; Kosovars, I've become Serbia's best friend in Congress.
@balkan_princeza @Johnny5024 @bakedalaska actually I was in Balkans&amp; personally witnessed  Serb bloody ethnic cleansing Croatia &amp; Kosovo
@Johnny5024 @remzelk1 @Cernovich @transition2017 U don‚Äôt acknowledge Serbian slaughtering Kosovars &amp; Croatians,which precipitated atrocities
@Johnny5024 @remzelk1 @Cernovich @transition2017 I supported US policy of thwarting Serbian slaughter of Croatians &amp; Kosovars. U did not
@Johnny5024 @bakedalaska OK where is your condemnation of Serbian ethnic cleansing of Croatians &amp; Kosovars, which started that Balkan war?
@Johnny5024 @bakedalaska U obviously unaware of my long record, risking my life at times, to defeat and destroy radical Islam terrorists
@Johnny5024 @bakedalaska  crimes on both sides but Ure attacking US for stopping Serb genocidal efforts to subjugate Croatians &amp; Kosovars.
@Johnny5024 @bakedalaska the USA &amp; Europe stopped bloody Serb ethnic cleansing of Croatians &amp; Kosovars, Ur ignoring those Serb crimes absurd
@Johnny5024 @bakedalaska I condemn,&amp; always have,any attack on Innocent civilians, including any &amp; all such actions by KLA or anyone else
@Johnny5024 @NPete2 @bakedalaska @Patriotress  Kosovars &amp; Croatians were victims of Serb terrorism, which is why US &amp; rest of Europe acted
@Johnny5024 @bakedalaska  I publically advocate eradicating radical Islam terror, not unlike 90s Serb ethnic cleansing of Kosovars &amp; Croats
@SerbRepublic @Johnny5024 @realDonaldTrump @FX_Ops Serb bloody attempt to subjugate Croats &amp; Kosovars was criminal. Since then Serbs R best
@MakeGreeceGreat @Johnny5024 @realDonaldTrump baloney, Serbs attacked Croatians as well as Kosovars who did want to be part of Serbia
@Johnny5024 @PamelaGeller @jihadwatchRS Kosovars pro USA since we supported their right of self determination, Islamists now making headway
@Johnny5024 @PamelaGeller @jihadwatchRS In Balkans I sat in Croatian Catholic Churches burned out by Serbs. Proud USA opposed Serb terrorism
@Johnny5024 @PamelaGeller @jihadwatchRS Serbs invaded slaughtering civilians to subjugate Croatia &amp; Kosovo.U call victims terrorists,baloney
@Johnny5024 U excuse Serb destruction of Croatian Catholic Churches, indiscriminate shelling of Dubrovnik &amp; slaughter of Kosovars &amp; Coats
@Johnny5024 U say Croatians were Nazi &amp; Kosovars Islamic terrorists, so Serbs had to keep them brutally subjugated.US opposed Serb terrorism
@Johnny5024 vast majority opposed being part of Serbia so Serbs burned Catholic Churches &amp; murdered Croatians &amp; Kosovars to terrorize them
@MikeySunshine @teddyschleifer @joshtpm U say picking fights with constituent but is treating critics like adults challenging their views
@064784 yes, whites like blacks, Hispanics &amp; Asians should be proud of their culture...but we should all be most proud of being Americans
@tomkawczynski @Johnny5024 @fireboy01111 I advocate internationally supervised referendum in Crimea so they determine their own destiny
@Johnny5024 it was a brutal war as Ur photo suggests. Serbs slaughtered population of Croatia &amp; Kosovo because vast majority rejected Serbia
@Johnny5024 So U say Kosvars &amp; Croatians wanted to be part of Serbia. Hell,Serbia terrorized  them,even burned Croat Roman Catholic Churches
@Johnny5024 @RealDonaldTrump vast majority Kosovars&amp; Croatians  opposed being part of Serbia.Rampaging Serbs were terrorists in Balkans
@Johnny5024 @fireboy01111 @tomkawczynski I believe right of self-determination 4 all people of Kosovo,Crimea, Baluchistan, Biafra, Scotland
@davidpwil We patriots just have to do our best. Thanks for doing youR part and more. Dana
@BeyondBelief12 a special prosecutor should be authorized by Congress to investigate the Clinton Foundation.
Trump Secretary of State Update: https://t.co/F8yz4iXpoi
@BeachDreamin291 I can‚Äôt even get GOP leadership to bring to a vote my bill HR 4017 Save Christians From Genocide Act, which sets a priority
@RAWTheTerror01 US gave $billions to PAK but corrupt PAK stole it from its people. PAK used US military aid to murder &amp; supress own people
@tedtwong so they R so stupid they don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre hurting Trump?That maybe not,but probably true. Like leftist America haters hurt Dems
@tedtwong leftists dressed as Nazis have acted as supporters to soil GOP &amp; frighten public.Whoever they R, those guys R nuts &amp; Rejected
@NHHome12 @wesearchr @realDonaldTrump @Turdykins Ur Trump support appreciated. Respect Ur love of dogs but saving humans always my priority
@billiamclitoris have a happy holiday, a merry Christmas, and a GREAT new year!
@billiamclitoris yes, 59o/o voted for me. They like me cause I like them, even those who are angry at me. That is why I tweet when I can.
@HBRefugee better a live dinosaur than a dead Turkey. Have a great day!
@wearepepito @briansikma if Islamic radicalization not reaction 2 Assad‚Äôs repression so stupid, refute it instead of a personal attack.
@gfre1  Everybody out there has seen videos of attacks on Trump people, yet no videos of the attack claims U talked about. Hmmm
@wearepepito OK let‚Äôs see a racist statement U claim I‚Äôve made.
@nottoogullible sorry I don‚Äôt have time to follow your directions. Have a happy holiday and a merry Christmas
@tedtwong USA made up of every race, religion&amp; ethnic group, all proud of their ancestry but prouder now to be part of the American family
@gfre1 so how come no video?Only folks being beaten up on video have been Trump people.As far as personal jabs, it indicates who U R not me
@RandFanshier have a great holiday. You just made my day
@gfre1 Including personal attack at the end undercuts credibility point Ur trying to make. Yes people who R not jokes can disagree with U
@gfre1 Unlike attacks on Trump people caught on video, claims of up surge in other politically motivated assaults not verified
@TALlama Oh really. U R unaware of widespread post election looting, Trump supporters beaten(caught on camera), rally disruption, ect. Hmmm
@gfre1  post election violence, attacks on Trump supporters wearing hat, organized disruption of opponents rallies. who ends up called Nazi?
@TALlama did U miss post election violence? Or organized disruption of Trump rallies, people wearing Trump hat being attacked on the street?
@Rep_Revolution @transition2017 I appreciate being appreciated. Thanks
@briansikma Sure all the anti-rad Islamists regimes cause ordinary people to chop heads off Christians &amp; stone women to death.
@briansikma internationally supervised referendum should let people of Crimea determine their future.
@briansikma @politico many false charges made against US &amp; Russia in Middle East. If Assad gone Rad Islamist will shortly emerge like Libya
@jsheppard18 to repeat ADL report I personally read specifically concluded Bannon not anti-Semitic.Ur too anxious to conduct personal attack
Do U believe black or Hispanic pride in their culture evil? Recent violence overwhelmingly from left, as is name calling &amp; stifling debate.
@jsheppard18 ‚Äúoccasional praise‚ÄùBS, its basis of his world view. Ur anti-Semite charge bogus.So  who‚Äôs the bigot? Good people can disagree
@jsheppard18 most evident hatred in our country has been that pouring out of lib/left toward those ‚Äúdeplorables‚Äù thinking of voting Trump
@jsheppard18 Bannon repeatedly praises Jewish contributions to Western Civilization. Perhaps U disagree on the value of Western Civilization
@jsheppard18 spineless?attacks against me based on my unabashedly advocating what I think right. Peace with Russia, legalizing marijuana,etc
@briansikma @politico I carry America‚Äôs national security water. Our Cold War enemy communism not Russia. We now need Ru to defeat Rad Islam
@MikeySunshine @jsheppard18 I don‚Äôt remember commenting on Hamilton. Is this just another lib nightmarish delusion or is my memory fading
@MikeySunshine @jsheppard18 grow up. After described in pejorative terms explaining why name caller wrong is not picking fight,nor bullying
@jsheppard18 Leaders R what they believe &amp; do,judge them not by street whackies like Hillary supporters who excused cop killers &amp; terrorists
@jsheppard18 didn‚Äôt ignore it,refuted it. ADL report I read concluded Bannon not anti-Semitic.Bannon should be judged on what he says&amp;does
@jsheppard18 instead showing clip of Hillary encouraging violence &amp; calling Americans who disagree ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù I wish U good night.
@jsheppard18 A number of Hillary leftists found wearing Nazi regalia at Trump rallies. Others organized riots &amp; violence B4 &amp; after vote
@jsheppard18 Nazis known:street violence, shouting  down opponents, breaking up opponent rallies.Who acted more like nazis in last election?
@jsheppard18 that‚Äôs the point. Praising Western civilization labeled racist yet Dems call 4  black pride. Neither racist but hypocracy clear
@jsheppard18 yes policy backed by some so called leaders betray GOP Patriots &amp; even their fellow Jews, who he is thus praising in contrast.
@jsheppard18 no, I dismiss personal attacks. Point out anti-semitic language even while the vile white hate mongering is promoted by Dems
@jsheppard18 baloney, yes, backs Israel. He also credits Jewish culture &amp; faith with positive shaping Western Civilization, which he lauds
@jsheppard18 I read ADL analysis saying  oppposite. Where R anti-Semite quotes? Bonner holds Judaism in high regard. This attack dispicable
@jsheppard18 U mean the Trump people wattacked by real haters encouraged by left. Open Ur eyes. Little or no Evidence of other hate crimes
@jsheppard18 Conservatives&amp;working class(so deplorable)declared in election leftist name calling(nazi) &amp; street intimidation not acceptable
@jsheppard18 leftists who claim that R modern Nazis. Bannon praises Jewish culture every time he describes his own philosophical foundation
@jsheppard18 @SenSanders Ur memory weak. I endorsed Cruz over Trump specifically because level of propriety in campaign.Am people disagreed
@jsheppard18 no Ur buddies &amp; Bernie are conducting a personal attack rather trying to refute ideas. That is how real bigots act.
@jsheppard18 Nazi=national Socialist. The left now exemplifies the intolerance, racial analysis, street violence, &amp; economics of Nazis
@a_certain_woman that other countries can get away with bombing our friends &amp; defenders is Obama&amp;Hillary‚Äôs legacy, but we pay the price
@superbello123 @Janx53 @a_certain_woman sounds right to me
@KulbariB @VP the Baloch courageously fight for their freedom against a corrupt &amp; brutal oppressor. They are not forgotten. They will win!
@queenadrock@ I appreciated when discussion got specific rather than general put downs. I am going to sleep now. Hope U get good sleep 2nite
@queenadrock  I am not Ur researcher. U apparently have not read ADL rather lengthy statement even though Ur use this personal attack 	.
@queenadrock oh so Ur astounded &amp; concerned an intelligent person disagrees or do U think no intelligent can disagree unless he is evil
@queenadrock his writings R full of praise for Jewish culture. This BS charge exempflies fascism of the left. Even the ADL says it‚Äôs bogus
@queenadrock if U think Black pride or Am Indian pride as bigoted then consider his defense of Judeo/Christian culture bigoted. I don‚Äôt
@queenadrock In lengthy lecture he related Western Civilization &amp; Europe‚Äôs Judeo Christian Heritage to White pride,like Africa&amp; black pride
@changserang @queenadrock I have yet to make full assessment, but if he is called a bigot I feel comfortable challenging that name calling.
@changserang @queenadrock OK rather than calling him a bigot, what policies does he advocate that so disturb you
@queenadrock @changserang so U say labeling name calling ‚Äúdespicable‚Äùsame as calling people names, like deplorable. Verb vs noun not same
@changserang @queenadrock no I challenged Ur using word bigot to describe someone,not a dismissal a condemnation of that approach
@WC_ScottyP @SenSanders no I am answering him
@changserang @queenadrock read it. I label actions not people. Name calling &amp; dismissing rather than refuting disagreement not acceptable
@princeof416 @DineshDSouza @JoshuaThifault congrats to Dems with full media on their side &amp; spending mega$ more, yet lost solid Dem states
@queenadrock Baloney. Calling someone bigoted is name calling, which is arrogant and,yes, mirrors Hillary‚Äôs despicable deplorable comment.
@queenadrock  Hillary lost, labeling those who disagreed deplorable didn‚Äôt work.calling someone a racist doesn‚Äôt work anymore either.
@SenSanders Bernie, why not just disagree with the policies our new president is advocating rather than calling names &amp; personal attacks
@JenWey sorry U sound like someone who calls names &amp; dismisses those Who disagree with U. The hate I see is coming from lib/left neofascists
@A_peacemonger I am flattered. If offer is made I will take it seriously. If not offered, will keep doing what I think is right&amp; being happy
@JoziDad I believe people of Kashmir Will vote to remain part of India if given the opportunity. They would be insane to choose Pakistan
@JoziDad yes, if the people of California would vote to be part of another country, or independent, they should be permitted to do so
@JoziDad Kashmiri people deserve a referendum on their sovereign status, just as the Baloch and others. This would undermine terrorists
@CarmenSanCarlos @TamrikoT @trumpservative baloney, with that language the USA would still be under the rule of English Royal family
@CarmenSanCarlos @TamrikoT @trumpservative what percentage of votes who voted supported independence. That all that counts.
@CarmenSanCarlos I don‚Äôt advocate they leave but People of Catalonia have a right to a referendum to decide that with ballots not bullets
@Miles_Sofa @shillstudios Ur vulgarity reflects an inability 2 defend Ur beliefs or simple ignorance. Whatever just be aware U hurt U not me
@Miles_Sofa haven‚Äôt seen evidence yet. I will keep an open mind, remembering that liberals call anyone who disagrees with them racist.
@chadenelsen don‚Äôt know him personally, but will look close before giving him my confidence,
@skandinova making clear points using common words is far more valuable in achieving goals than artistic flourish or elitist vocabulary
@Ivashka08244141 didn‚Äôt understand point U R trying.to make
@ProofreadingHQ RReagan instructed his speechwriters not to use the words ‚Äúimportant‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúvery‚Äù so that very important lesson served him well
@cartoon_villain I make my own decisions. No two politicos think totally alike, so I‚Äôm sure there will be differences
@Gidg562 @KTLA sorry U R not educated enough to make a coherent argument against a policy I advocate that U disagree with
@cartoon_villain I will decide what Trump proposes an issue at a time.lI am likely to support efforts to stop massive inflow of illegals
@JenWey everyone has equal rights no one has special rights.
@Lupa2220 U seem to think calling names demeans a person with whom U disagree. Actually it makes U look stupid &amp; unworthy of attention
@JenWey My decisions R based on what I think right, then honestly informing my constituents. Every 2 yrs voters then decide if they agree.
@coralangs thanks for Ur tweet reflecting the inner feelings of open mindedness &amp; benevolence toward others that guide Ur decision making
@MGPaterson have no idea what you are talking about, but neither do you...especially when you claim I am hateful because U disagree with me
@tifdog1 Obama backed Muslim Brotherhood regime in Egypt.In future,negative impact of his Islamic&amp;Marxist upbringing will be more evident
@tifdog1 Looking back, Reagan looks better. I can not imagine how Obama will look a few years from now.
@hannahjswift Ur use of the language says a lot about U
@Lupa2220 guess it is 2 difficult 4 U 2 advocate a contrary position or 2  express Urself without using profanity or free Urself of hatred
@SusheelaM3 @immivoice guess as a poet U don‚Äôt care if a foriegnet comes here &amp; takes Ur job, a lot of Americans R not so well off as U
@tifdog1 Obama sent out message to illegals: no repercussion if they vote.Not dumb.He used confused wording to give cover to his  betrayal.
@tifdog1 R U claiming Obama did not intend to send message to illegals encouraging them to vote? I doubt U believe that. Read it &amp; see it!
@zsbradt @savarysue spoken like a committed socialist, which is what you label yourself
@SpecialRider @SteveJessup_ U don‚Äôt seem to know in Cal an independent commission  determines shape &amp; make up of Congressional districts
@SpecialRider @SteveJessup_ my district is made up of the coastal cities in Orange County. It is compact &amp; residents have shared interests
@SpecialRider @SteveJessup_ U don‚Äôt seem to know in Cal independent bipartisan commission decides shape &amp; make up,of Cong Districts.
@SpecialRider @SteveJessup_ 4 ur nfo, majority of my district staff foreign born. That‚Äôs right legal immigrants who R proud Americans. U lie
@JoanneWales1 tell everybody
@jameslocke thanks for well wishes. You too.
@jameslocke look it is OK to care more about dogs in danger than people in danger. Fine. Just don‚Äôt claim those who don‚Äôt R heartless
@jameslocke so Ur telling me how politics works,wrong. Same effort to save dogs in China would have saved a number of political prisoners
@jameslocke Time expended pushing dog bill could have saved at least 1 political prisoner in China.Have U tweeted support 4 such a prisoner
@clarinet_ayslin I am here and win big because the vaste majority of voters in my district don‚Äôt think like U or share Ur values
@clarinet_ayslin sorry but your views do not reflect the vast majority of my constituents. Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be here
@clarinet_ayslin such cold hearted nonsense. U live in society dominated by Christians yet U don‚Äôt seem 2  give that fact much credit 4 good
@clarinet_ayslin 11 people murdered in abortion clinics in 20 yrs, which everyone should condemn. Christians killed thousands times that
@clarinet_ayslin so pointing out the heartlessness of Ur question is shoving my agenda down Ur throat.
@jameslocke insisting Chinese gov stop its murderous attack on religious peoples trivialized if accompanied by demand they stop eating dog
@clarinet_ayslin to compare religious people with contrary views to terrorists who slaughter Christians is bigoted
@clarinet_ayslin So U believe those believing abortion is killing a baby have no right of free speech to carry a sign near abortion clinics
@clarinet_ayslin a couple of violent acts against abortion clinics over yrs, not comparable to Islamic terrorists slaughter of Christians
@clarinet_ayslin U seem unable to simply accept that there R Radical Muslims who R committing horrific terrorist crimes. Just like Obama
@jameslocke Signing on to save dogs in China will be used to trivialize my efforts to save religious people in China from being executed
@icedartgun I know nothing of this case
@icedartgun will have to look through my notes on that one
@mbsevans @jewelofark @Iheartd0gz @darlingdogss well, I know Ur name calling &amp; profanity indicates a lack of ability 2 make Ur point.
@CaroleWadeNpBch care about kids is Y police should be protecting us from criminals rather than wasting time protecting adults from selves
@GuileSN_BR @jewelofark can‚Äôt undermine efforts 2 save human beings in China 2 save dogs. Chinese murder Falun Gong &amp; sell their body parts
@rubyduuu @pamnsc I appreciate Ur sincerity, but putting my name on a list to save dogs in China will undermine efforts to save people there
@pamnsc I‚Äôm criticized 4 ignoring plight of dogs &amp; focus on saving Syrian Christians, Falun Gong in China, Baloch in Pakistan from slaughter
@pamnsc I‚Äôm attacked 4 ignoring plight of dogs &amp; focusing on saving Syrian Christians,Falon Gong in China, Baloch in Pakistan from slaughter
@pamnsc thanks 4 reminding others that people R  being slaughtered because of their Christian faith &amp; we must save them or they have no hope
@jsheppard18 if U want to restart dialogue day before election will be happy to intellectually spare with U then.
@jsheppard18 After denying Clinton crimes against women &amp; dismissing video creating violence at Trump rallies Ur request lacks credibility
@jsheppard18 U can deny Bill‚Äôs assaults or Hillary‚Äôs role of keeping the lid on. The public waking up despite minimal media coverage.
@jsheppard18 hard to read the copy U sent. Whatever it was it is no excuse 4 U to deny conspiracy to create violence at Trump rallies.
@jsheppard18 thanks again, we can revive this discussion weekend before election. Will be interested in Ur take of events between now &amp; then
@jsheppard18 Ur criticism of Trump may or may not be true. Again I see him as flawed as compared to Hillary who I see as far worse.
@jsheppard18 Ur claim O‚Äôkeef‚Äôs clandestine videos edited to deceive indicates a partisan &amp;closed mind unable to see what in front of face
@jsheppard18 only ones I saw conspiring to bring violence were Hillary staffers. Got to go now. Nice discussion. Thanks
@jsheppard18  label it whatever, there R legitimate economic &amp; security concerns with massive influx of illegal immigrants into our country
@jsheppard18 only Nazi tactics I have seen: top Hillary campaigners caught on video clearly plotting to cause violence at Trump events
@jsheppard18 4 yrs Ted Kennedy heralded conscious of Dem party while living a Clintonesque sexual  lifestyle resulting in young girls death
@jsheppard18 U R consistent if U R not voting 4 her. 4 me, there R two alternatives that might win authority.I  take the least objectionable
@jsheppard18 well, I totally disagree Trumps alleged groping worse than Hillary keeping the lid on issue,including intimidation of victims
@jsheppard18 OK when U include a hit on Trump 4 sexual misconduct as a reason to vote for Hillary then I assume a double standard.
@jsheppard18 I see allegations of Trump groping &amp; verbal abuse voluminously reported vs rape victims stepping forward ignored or dismissed.
@jsheppard18 Ur dismissal of rape victims ‚Äúvague claims‚Äù suggests a certain partisanship on your part.
@jsheppard18 open Ur eyes, these R not ‚Äúvague claims‚Äù U choose to ignore a rape victim who disclosed Hillary intimidated her into silence
@jsheppard18 when choice is Donald with all his faults vs Hillary who amassed her family $ &amp;facilitated her husbands rapes.I‚Äôll take Donald
@realLouChampion depends on who he is running against
@flatcatcanyon @zenmastermiller why don‚Äôt U call UCI gov Liason office they will give U a list.U might ask for Alberto who used to work 4 me
@dswilder My office has worked with hundreds vets to ensure their rights &amp; benefits? Obama has had authority &amp; made situation worse
@aljtamsam @CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton long list of bills passed this yr by House &amp; blocked by Prez or Dems in Senate
@CHHolte so U refuse to condemn DOD Obama appointees 4 not ending harassment &amp; then play political games. It shows the real U
@CHHolte @aljtamsam @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton baloney, when U excuse Obama appointees 4 not ending harassment U betray vets
@aljtamsam @CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Y U ignore Obama appointees refuse to end harassing our vets, over my objection
@dswilder @aljtamsam @CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Obama appointees could 2 stop harassment of our Vets &amp; aren‚Äôt doing it
@dswilder @aljtamsam @CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton R U a political hack or do U care about Vets &amp; just don‚Äôt know my record
@aljtamsam @CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton it is Obama DOD appointees who refuse to stop harassing our California vets.
@CHHolte @aljtamsam @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Obama appointees targeted vets rather than let DOD get blame.
@CHHolte @aljtamsam @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Baloney, Obama DOD on its own temporarily halted attack on vets, but won‚Äôt end it
@CHHolte @aljtamsam @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Baloney,so pro Obama U ignore his power to end harassing vets, he still refuses
@CHHolte @RealEmmaGoldman @timmyforefinger @KamalaHarris Obama DOD appointees had power to end harassing Vets.didn‚Äôt end it &amp; still won‚Äôt
@CHHolte @KamalaHarris Obama DOD instead of ending harassment of our Ca vets will create bureaucratic panel to lake judgement case by case
@CHHolte @KamalaHarris On the call with DOD Dep Sec Bob Work. Obama‚Äôs DOD will temporarily halt but refuses to end harassing our Cal vets
@aljtamsam @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton No, Obama‚Äôs Sec of Def could have stopped this harassment of Vets long ago,as he did today
@aljtamsam @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton why did  take political pressure 4 Obama‚Äôs Sec of Defense to suspended attack on Vets
@CELongated @In4mdCndn yes, criminal justice should be local &amp; state responsibility and violence should be crime equally enforced
@CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Congress does not micro manage VA so screw ups belong to Obama appointed VA managers Obama WH
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta @billmaher so U don‚Äôt like my marijuana stand or my efforts to prevent war with Russia.
@In4mdCndn If U reject Hillary over her role in her husband‚Äôs serial rapes,  Ur outrage of Trump‚Äôs behavior is consistent &amp; not just BSing
@spo1981 fine take concerns but don‚Äôt let ego tell U it is fitting to send tweets by the half dozen &amp; act entitled to be focus of attention
@In4mdCndn so U want fed gov to enforce criminal law when woman involved .Sorry policepowers should be local &amp; crime victims treated same
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta So U oppose my efforts 2 legalize med marijuana &amp; preventing the warHillary wants with Ru
@In4mdCndn so Trump is like taking Meth. How creative, U didn‚Äôt even have to offer an issue which makes her Ur candidate. Honesty? Loyalty?
@spo1981 I personally take more time with more people on Internet than almost any other congressman, which limits time For each conversation
@In4mdCndn @SavarySue guess what U see is product of mega$ donated by billionaires to Dem campaign or loote given to Hillary‚Äôs foundation
@In4mdCndn @SavarySue get serious.Dem party on trade treaties, amnesty for illegals flooding our country, bailouts, betray Am workers
@CHHolte @FlipItDem @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Obama‚Äôs VA &amp; Vet benefit administrators caused the problems U blame Republicans 4 not fixing
@libby_breen @FlipItDem @yodaquoter @SavarySue @HillaryClinton Time to ask what a lib/left crook like Hillary will do to the country
@6grade56 @FlipItDem Obama appointees runs the VA &amp; administer veterans benefits &amp; have royally screwed it up. I‚Äôve supported reform .
@In4mdCndn @SavarySue Ur Democrat president runs VA &amp; administers veterans benefits has a horrible track record when it comes to veterans,
@6grade56 @FlipItDem I assume Ure not just a political hack, but U R dead wrong alleging I am not mobilized on behave CAL Vets
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta Is toeing party line mean House leader on marijuana reform or pushing peace with Russia
@OCTeaPartyBlog @SteveJessup_ @hambone_alex @matijaabicic @AngelBGuerrero @teuta that was typical of the degenerate mind set that plagues us
@CELongated @AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta we know what Trump talked about. We know what Hillary&amp;her husband have done.
@intentionmentor well said
@RealJamesWoods agree it is really funny
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta why not research something before making negative personal claims.
@CELongated @IvanDCruz1 @spo1981 while you ignore Clinton‚Äôs rape &amp; intimidation of victims U play word games
@IvanDCruz1 @spo1981 Dismissing OKeefe‚Äôs videos   Shows how low Dems will go to cover up wrong doings. what OKeffe exposes is illegal u
@RizziMike to put Hillary in power  press held back negative Trump info until nominated, such lib/left manipulation rigged election outcome
@DRUDGE_REPORT thanks 4 sending article. It appears a number of our heroic  defenders  have been wronged. I will do my best to make it right
@matijaabicic finally, I raise far less from special interest PACs . It makes Rhonda‚Äôs salary appear larger because it is higher 0/0.
@matijaabicic Y partisan BS? wife pro campaign manger before me &amp; has had market rate salary. it appears large cause raise less than others
@matijaabicic so U pass on such  BS yet U can‚Äôt recognize danger  letting people who don‚Äôt have photo ID to vote. Sounds partisan D to me
@spo1981 guess Ur News sources haven‚Äôt mentioned O‚Äôkeefe hidden camera documentaries release three days ago. Newt called 4 FBI 2 investigate
@spo1981 thanks for sending on the Rollinf Stone article. Fitting reading 4 day when RS in court for falsifying  Frat House Rape story.
@hambone_alex @matijaabicic @AngelBGuerrero @teuta glad to have heard from someone who has such class to ignore Clinton rapes &amp; corruption
@matijaabicic @angelbguerrero @hambone_alex @teuta I speak my mind to win people over. Hillary slick and polished trying to manipulate you
@teuta @matijaabicic Wrong! Clintons R a team. She covered his serial rapes. He paid big bucks 4 speeches overseas when she was Sec of St
@spo1981 yes it is. So U ignore video reports released three days ago&amp;7email exposures.Eliminating photo ID before voting doesn‚Äôt  worry U
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta so U just ignore Clinton victims who have come forward, but dump on Trump far less
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta Didn‚Äôt support Trump in primaries. Media ignores Hillary is worse on most every count
@spo1981 already seen evidence of well financed plot to steal election. Dem leaders secretly taped explaining their political mayhem
@sp o1981 Al Gore went all way to Supreme Court. Voter fraud intent evident in heavy handed opposition to requiring photo ID before voting
@cartoon_villain @FlipItDem GWarming advocates repeatedly cite credentials to obscure faults in logic or accuracy of information.
@dswilder @kurteichenwald I block tweeters Using foul language, name calling or part of  pile on team.  one of few electeds doing own tweets
@dswilder @kurteichenwald @FlipItDem Ur knowledge of how system works seems rather limited. Elon Hosted 3 of my most successful fundraisers
@ValGozi @XenoMullerCoach @elonmusk I am leader in commercial space &amp; revolutionary new  battery tech. Elon One of my biggest backers.
@XenoMullerCoach @ValGozi no impasse with me. I listen to other side &amp;if I wrong I admit it. GWarming advocates,when wrong,simply call names
@XenoMullerCoach @ValGozi when GWarming advocates stop calling names, I listen closely to their arguments which do not stand close scrutiny
@XenoMullerCoach GWarming advocates blame CO2 when it rains or if there is no rain, for18 yrs no temp increase despite major increase of CO2
@ValGozi @XenoMullerCoach Global warming advocates focus on CO2, which is NOT harmful to human health,but stimulates plant growth=more food
@RizziMike A just released documentary shows major effort made by Dem leaders to steal election: https://t.co/6sNP3OWzHC
@XenoMullerCoach @BernieSanders if global warming caused by human fossil fuel use what caused all other dramatic climate cycles in the past?
@RizziMike Dems argue against requiring photo ID at voting place. That is insult to those trying to maintain ntegrity of our voting process
@matijaabicic @AngelBGuerrero @hambone_alex @teuta if U can‚Äôt if you can‚Äôt understand something.maybe what U believe is not accurate
@CaroleWadeNpBch respectfully disagree. Hard drug use down in Colorado. Plus police now can use time saving victims of real criminals
@teuta @matijaabicic @hambone_alex sounds a bit like group I embraced,THE DOORS, my music taste is a bit more mellow now.
@SavarySue @FlipItDem those promoting man-made global warming theory simply repeat credentials of pro scientists rather than analyze issue
@RizziMike  election already rigged via establishment conspiracy Bad news kept from  American voters until Trump nominated, then unleashed
@AngelBGuerrero @matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta how about intimidating a woman who had just been raped by her husband.
@JayrippsJay I have studied both and consider Trump to be the best candidate and will make a better president than Hillary. That‚Äôs it
@SecularSapien so U back up those using phrase ‚Äúyou are full of shit‚Äù as part of issues discussion. Guess U R in that group not fit 2 talk 2
@matijaabicic @hambone_alex @teuta now only two alternatives. He is better of the two. Anything wrong Trump has done, Hillary‚Äôs done worse
@babakmo1 only really stupid &amp; really arrogant people call names, use foul language &amp; expects their opinion to be taken seriously.
@francishumes thanks for the good feed back. Proud to have your vote.
@erictpaine so Ur 4 Hillary who has enriched herself while in public office, covered up Bill‚Äôs crimes against women, &amp; destroyed evidence
@AngelBGuerrero Trump only needs being better than Hillary. entire strategy against Trump is personal attacks thus comparisons legitimate
@AngelBGuerrero @TomJPyle younger voters always add to my margin of victory. U think they want to pay more for gas or raise airfares. Wrong
@FlipItDem @Moo57556470 so U call Bill‚Äôs victims hussies. U just demonstrated the hypocrisy of Dem claim to champion women.
@rarussel3_bob Wrong,I told him calling names was arrogant &amp; stupid. U get worked up over that but not Hillary‚Äôs corruption &amp; wrong doing
@hambone_alex @matijaabicic @teuta Bill impeached,disbarred&amp;barred from practicing law 4 perjury to investigation of sexual assault
@hambone_alex @matijaabicic @teuta sure &amp; FBI director lets Hillary off after destroying evidence. U call 4 Bill‚Äôs arrest if he was GOP
@TomJPyle one bright spot:America‚Äôs enormous new energy potential. Not long ago enviro fanatics swore the world had reached ‚Äúpeak oil‚Äù
@kurteichenwald @realDonaldTrumpsorry do U see difference between covering up evil behavior&amp; intimidation vs inviting victims over 4 tea
@matijaabicic @teuta  shouldn‚Äôt be but I am shocked when people refuse to acknowledge Clintion corruption &amp;Hillary‚Äôs role in Bill‚Äôs rapes
@spo1981 good question. I did not support Trump in primaries, Now that he fairly won GOP nomination only real choice:Trump or Hillary.
@SavarySue @jfk117 @Moo57556470 @mike20169 @FlipItDem I just can‚Äôt get over accounts Hillary intimidated Bills sexual victims into silence
@jfk117 @Moo57556470 @mike20169 @FlipItDem @SavarySue U R in denial, ignoring numerous victims accounts of Clinton assaults&amp;abuse
@SavarySue @jfk117 @Moo57556470 @mike20169 @FlipItDem when U say ‚Äú get over it‚Äù R U talking to the victims who Bill raped or abused?
@jfk117 @Moo57556470 @mike20169 @FlipItDem @SavarySue read the victims accounts. The pattern is clear.
@Moo57556470 @mike20169 keep ignoring Hillary‚Äôs corruption &amp; coverup of Bill‚Äôs multiple rapes. Arrogance alienates  voters
@wck461 @coehren @FlipItDem @Moo57556470 do you always repeat lies if they are aimed at people with whom you disagree
@Moo57556470 @mike20169 anyone who refuses to recognize Hillary‚Äôs cover up of her husbands multiple rapes should not complain about Trump
@Moo57556470 @mike20169 U R in denial. Over decades,Bill &amp; Hillary enriched themselves, covered up wrong doing, including multiple rapes.
@JanVanSchaik53 not tolerance of intolerance. This is comparing 2 alternatives rather than judging only one. Vulgarity vs facilitating rape
@SheilaGinHB @hardball @hughhewitt like father of commercial space industry, the savior of Am Patent system, reformer of med marijuana law
@sasmaster521 @Moo57556470 @mike20169 @FlipItDem @SavarySue U are dedicated to making Hillary President.
@ShellySure primary was in June. General election in November.
@SheilaGinHB name calling don‚Äôt work no more. Illegal immigrants flooding into US hurt Am citizens who R black, Hispanic, &amp; even Muslim.
@Moo57556470 @mike20169 @FlipItDem @SavarySue people who ignore Hillary‚Äôs intimidation of Bill‚Äôs rapes victims have no room criticize anyone
@SheilaGinHB @hardball if I am being attacked by them It must mean I am having an impact. Thanks for alerting me
@AngelBGuerrero now U R making real points rather just calling names. Hope Ure wrong. Mex-Americans worst hurt by flood of illegals into US
@MichaelGodwinNY America will survive. After eight yrs of Obama we can survive anyone
@AngelBGuerrero guess U can‚Äôt read or U wouldn‚Äôt have to ask that question
@NewsJunkieJo @hughhewitt Ur comment reflects Ur intelligence not mine
@kelw719 I have found that those labeling people with whom they disagree as disgusting idiots R usually discusting idiots
@smarple865 @SpeakerRyan So It is OK with U  to ignore decision of voters &amp; give election to woman who silenced her husbands rape victims
@Melindacricket @realDonaldTrump So U label Trump pervert but ignore Hillary intimidating her husbands rape victims &amp; pocketing  $ millions
@chmayer R U still pushing a bogus number of believers instead of specific science based argument, U know like there R no more Polar bears
@Formquest that was a fairly good dig for someone with no followers
@lunn_b @mloucel @AZConservative1 @RepMcClintock @RepJohnCarter U have no following so guess calling names is all U R capable of
@AZConservative1 @RepMcClintock @repjohncarter whatever Trump is Hillary is worse
@JayrippsJay easy...Hillary will be elected if Trump is not.
@inductivemacro @Samoan_Attorney @TCleveland4Real you really have no shame do you? Traitor? I have risked my life for my country have you?
@AngelBGuerrero R U still supporting Hillary knowing she intimidated several of Bill‚Äôs many rape victims into silence? She had no response
@AngelBGuerrero if U disagreed in an intelligent way instead of just calling a grotesque name, U would have more respect,&amp;maybe a follower
@Samoan_Attorney @inductivemacro @TCleveland4Real nobodies mouthpiece but my own, support co-operation oppose creating new Cold War
@TCleveland4Real like Trump I disagree with those specific  positions taken by Pence
@TCleveland4Real I did not concede anything about who did the hacking. I suggested  accuracy of information more important than who hacked
@Jborman9 no!! Ur job is vote in a way that will have most positive result for USA. Any other than Trump vote lifts Hillary. That‚Äôs Reality
@TCleveland4Real only thing important is if information now available to Am people is accurate. U.S. Tries to impact foreign election too
@TCleveland4Real important question is whether the information is accurate not who exposed it to the American people &amp; what was the motive.
@TCleveland4Real yes it is a yes
@TCleveland4Real Trump‚Äôs sexual brags in private conversation of 10 yrs ago is no where as evil as Bills rapes &amp; Hillary‚Äôs coverup
@jdhenchman I sympathize with freedom movements as long as goal isn‚Äôt replacing an oppressive regime with religious or ethnic fanatics
@vijendersachdev @RAKhan8844 Baloch denied referendum determine status. Denied ballots they now R earning their freedom with bullets
@bigtimeart will be a lot more tired when U succeed feeling Holier-than-thou by empowering  Marxist/left to rule our country for decades
@bigtimeart sad to hear U R using Ur influence to make a woman Prez who enabled her husband to continue raping women, silencing victims
@BrentWagner sorry it was intended for averycounts.
@ecarpen Am people will compare serial rapist enabler Hillary to Donald  &amp; make up their own decision
@Vasiliskander2 people do their best but R thwarted by evil or stupid well meaning people. Ukraine tragedy need not have happened,
@Vasiliskander2 I hven‚Äôt heard of a jump in Am investment in South America. China,however,stepping up its acquiring businesses &amp; land there
@Vasiliskander2 Hillary covered up Bill‚Äôs rapes. Lib/left media now covers up Hillary‚Äôs wrong doing. Hacked E-mails may be her undoing
@bekahdon @FoxBusiness @JBaker31826004 what is Obama‚Äùs middle name?
@Miles_Sofa Trump short outbursts wrong. Kaine‚Äôs disregard of female moderator&amp;right of public 2 hear otherside arrogant&amp;abusive as it gets
@Kinnare786 @rsprasad I support Kashmir referendum, but that no excuse 4 repression &amp; murder of  Baloch. Do U support it or R U hypocrite?
@BrentWagner Trump‚Äôs outbursts not appropriate.Kaine disruptions&amp;arrogant disregard 4 female moderator undermined public right to hear both
@stuartglick Indiana women&amp;families R safe &amp; properous compared to Dem controlled states. Hillary‚Äôs support 4 rapist husband not forgotten
@Vasiliskander2 Hillary‚Äôs running mate made Trump look courteous. Public fed up with such arrogance.Trump will win election by five points
@Kinnare786 @rsprasad if all parts Kashmir given vote to determine future They would never put themselves under corrupt/repressive PAK gov
@yurko40a @JayO304 I have no double standard. Ur hate that clouds Ur vision. U ignore what destroyed Ukr Democracy &amp; Georgia broke truce
@yurko40a @JayO304 Ur hatred 4 Putin &amp; Russia, and blatant double standard, would reignite Cold War instead cooperating to thwart terrorists
@yurko40a @vasil70407612 just maybe it was accident like when U.S. &amp;‚ÄôUrkraine shot down Iranian &amp; Russian airliner. Hatred obscures vision
@yurko40a @vasil70407612 U ignore US shoot down Iranian Airlinr &amp; Ukraines shoot down Russian airline, Ur hatred of Russia impacts Ur vision
@yurko40a @JayO304 Few countries R truly democratic. Rad Islamic Terrorism primary threat to all so We need to work with Russia.
@yurko40a @boggled102 @SavarySue @nadianboone @MJoyce2244 that is what OSCE is all about. Look U don‚Äôt believe in self determination, Fine!
@yurko40a @jayo304 status of those 2  provinces need be determined by people living there just like when Georgians &amp; Ukrainians left Russia
@yurko40a @jayo304 OK U don‚Äôt believe in self determination. No reason to BS. People living in Crimea have right to vote on their future
@yurko40a @JayO304 breaking 7‚Äôyr truce,Georgia troops went into 2 provinces which did not want to be part of Georgia, Russia retaliated
@boggled102 @yurko40a @SavarySue @nadianboone @MJoyce2244 to peacefully solve issue honest referendum must take place in Crimea
@koda1950 @jewelofark Scum &amp; shame not way to convince someone to shift some of his efforts saving Chinese people into effort to save dogs
@koda1950 @tcot While deeply involved in saving Religious people in China, I will not trivialize the effort by bringing up how they eat dogs
@yurko40a @boggled102 @SavarySue @nadianboone @MJoyce2244 People living in Crimea should decide what country to be part of
@yurko40a @boggled102 @SavarySue @nadianboone @MJoyce2244 self determination means U decide. British would have voted to keep US.
@SoulSurvivor60 @MJoyce2244 @yurko40a @Reality_Alert Ur fanatics hatred for Christians is evident.
@MJoyce2244 @boggled102 @SavarySue u relate Christianty to bigotry. You wanna see bigotry, look in the mirror
@boggled102 @SavarySue @yurko40a @nadianboone @MJoyce2244 I support the Minsk agreement as a method of ending the conflict in Ukraine
@boggled102 @SavarySue @yurko40a @nadianboone @MJoyce2244 the  people of Crimea should decide in an internationally observed referendum
@boggled102 @MJoyce2244 @SavarySue @yurko40a  Mh17 hit was unintentional, as was USNavy downing Iranian airline &amp; Ukr downing Ru airline
@MJoyce2244 @SoulSurvivor60 @yurko40a @Reality_Alert U may not exist, but certainly opinionated &amp; not inclined to save targeted Christians
@yurko40a @savarysue @mjoyce2244 @matildabress @nadianboone OK U hate Russia, especially Putin, such negativity only makes the world worse
@yurko40a @savarysue @mjoyce2244 @matildabress @nadianboone we worked with Stalin to defeat Hitler. U must think that was wrong,
@MJoyce2244 @SavarySue @yurko40a @nadianboone repeated lie Russia hacking &amp; impacting  US elections exposes a sinister push 4 new Cold War
@MJoyce2244 @SavarySue @yurko40a @nadianboone good example, intel hacking specialists testified no US election has been hacked into by Ru
@jewelofark who said it‚Äôs OK? My limited time goes to save people. How U use Ur time &amp;set your  priorities reflects Ur values.
@SavarySue @MJoyce2244 @yurko40a @matildabress @nadianboone voters will decide: I say work with Russia to defeat Islam Terrorism; U say No
@MJoyce2244 @SoulSurvivor60 @yurko40a @Reality_Alert no apologizes 4 specifically designating Christians when they R targeted 4 extinction
@MJoyce2244 @SoulSurvivor60 @yurko40a @Reality_Alert oh so U send boat load of Jews back to Hitler because giving preferences is craven
@SavarySue @nadianboone @matildabress @Nerthsophia good choice, unlike me Susan rejects working with Russia to defeat Rad Islamic Terrorism
@boggled102 @MikaPeltokorpi US shot down Iranian airliner, Ukraine shot down a Russian airliner, both unintentional, as I believe this to be
@MJoyce2244 @SoulSurvivor60 @yurko40a @Reality_Alert I would not use same words but agree: idiotic to attack saving targeted Christians
@organic2016 @pnehlen @true_pundit @realDonaldTrump yet another reason for me to vote against the US subsidy of the UN
@SavarySue @matildabress @nadianboone @Nerthsophia working with Russia to defeat our mutual enemy Rad Islamic Terrorism will make US safer
@erhortopan @NRO so if U don‚Äôt exist neither does Ur cause
@Nerthsophia so I will discuss it no more. My priority is life &amp; well being of people. U R surely good person, but look at world differently
@Nerthsophia The time spent dealing with supporters animal-rights in China I could‚Äôve saved Life of a Chinese or Baloch dissident. Not right
@organic2016 thanks 4 recognizing responsible &amp; humanitarian way of dealing with flood of immigrants who have come to our country illegally
@MrsSHaber excruciating arthritic pain gives me better understanding of the stupidity in preventing cannabis from alleviating suffering
@Vasil70407612 my opinion: Ru shot down airliner, just as US accidentally shot down Iranian airliner and   Ukrainians shot down Ru airliner
@merrinbuchan opinion different,  but not rubbish. Swing state No Carolina polls show Trump‚Äôs law&amp;order beat Hilllary‚Äôs claim of racism
@JayO304 thanks, it gets depressing hearing intelligent people who seem to want Russia &amp; USA to be at each other‚Äôs throats again
@zzzzbarb 5 months from now Obama will be gone. If the Am voters give us ability to turn our gov in a different direction it will be done
@Baloshi_issue I will try my best to make it happen!
@aushaki @NateSilver538 thanks for assign on the bad news
@dpwitte Gee whiz, Dan aren‚Äôt U intelligent enough to argue against what I advocate rather than just call names?
Hillary lost votes by suggesting US violence based on racism. Trump won votes repeating a commitment to jobs,fair trade as well as law&amp;order
@AbcarianLAT Trump surging ahead. Tonight he was soft on Hillary &amp; that‚Äôs OK cause the left wanted to portray him as a bully.
@Samurai_Lucy @CrittersRevenge @axhaer @SenateFloor @senatorfain I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôve been focusing on China‚Äôs murder of religious activists
@LibertySeeds agree!!
@FranzihoNza @chimdiya1 people of Biafra have same God given right to self determination as Americans in 1776. Let them vote on it.
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA commercial areas of town, not Family neighborhoods, best place for drunks&amp; Addicts
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA crime associated with drug &amp; alcohol addiction  not welcome in family neighborhoods
@nathaliepeace1 had nice several hour tweet discussion. my focus on saving people discussed with those focused on animals.time to move on
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA families who don‚Äôt expect gov to put drunks&amp;addicts next door won‚Äôt be forgotten
@mustikhan @TulsiPress @RepMattSalmon @tedcruz @JudgeTedPoe @SKSk785 @GenFlynn @PashaSehgal the debate is on &amp; unless PAK change it loses
@JayO304 we need to find mutually beneficial ways to cooperate with Russia rather than set the stage for a new Cold War with Russia
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA more drug addicts &amp; alcoholics placed in family neighborhood = families less safe
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA they should live with their families not drag inothers in other neighborhoods
@beachmama7777 great anyone wanting their rep to focus on saving animals rather than people should take that consideration when voting
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA those making good life choices should not be  burdened by  those who did not
@bakingbarrister @DarrellIssa @KenCalvert @MimiWaltersCA alcoholics &amp; drug addicts should not shoved into family neighborhood by federal gov
@ZubairMohal @Shaheengatt Saudis financed Bin Laden in Afghanistan,&amp; also financed 9-11 terrorist attack that slaughtered 3,000 Americans
@ZubairMohal @Shaheengatt The Afghan who bombed New York visited a Taliban terrorist camp in PAK before committing his evil deeds.
@robmehood can honest person disagree with U without being paid off. Open your eyes. PAK gov is corrupt,oppressive&amp;supports terrorists
@erhortopan who elected you?
@mcorpo @julesandfurries Several years ago I submitted legislation calling for a referendum in Kashmir
@SeanHTX @JudgeTedPoe too bad U R  too ignorant to state your opinion so you end up using  gutter words, which makes U look bad, not me
@SeanHTX @JudgeTedPoe where do U get Ur info. Well, it is wrong! I have been to Pakistan a number of times.
@AmithaColley already spent too much time on well being of animals instead of human beings
@GingerHads @claybaumung sorry I have already spent more time discussing the well-being of animals when I should be focusing on human beings
@ClayBaumung I‚Äôll prioritize saving people thank you
@Nerthsophia those trying to do everything for everybody end up getting nothing done for anybody. I prioritize people, thank U
@valentina_amici I appreciate being appreciated every now &amp; then
@Nerthsophia Hope  animal rights advocates are also against abortion
@jewelofark @AfricanWoman14 why focus on dogs? Do U hate Asians? Cattle, sheep, chickens, ect all suffer same fate. Saving people priority
@ahmetsipahioglu assault on freedom of press &amp; other democratic rights started long before coup to silence those exposing corruption
@ahmetsipahioglu opponents arrested &amp; newspapers closed or taken over long before coup. Coup crime...followed by long planned power grab
@ruthmen @brittykini @erhortopan Ur statement says more about U than me. Name calling is both ignorant and arrogant
@TobyandWinston appreciate being Ur congressman, we may disagree:confronting China on how they treat dogs vs how they murder people
@Melania02 U have no idea of what I am doing or have done, yet U call me names. Shame on U
@brittykini @erhortopan I say save the girl not the dog
@erhortopan U made Ur point. I made mine. Now go save animals while I go save people.
@Melania02 Ur anti-people side is coming out. R U a vegetarian? Do U ware leather shoes?
@laurabertram like I said, I prefer to focus my limited time saving people.  debating fine people with other priorities is waste of time
@diannnaaa U obviously care more about dogs than China‚Äôs executing religious people&amp;selling body parts. Public will decide who is disgrace
@GingerHads @julesandfurries U hit their killing&amp;eating dogs, I helped expose Chinese execution of religious followers&amp;selling body parts.
@JoanneLisle Ur name calling tells it all
@jojomojo243 @julesandfurries pathetic is thinking  Ur superior by using limited time saving animals when so many people R suffering
@julesandfurries once the millions of people who suffer torture and oppression are saved I will focus my attention on animals
@Gercekne1 @AfSV_US gquestion is how much U R paid to cover a power grab by a corrupt  Leader who is destroying democracy in Turkey
@crimsonboudoir @RepMikeCoffman @SenJohnMcCain @repbenraylujan @RepBarrettRich  demanding all voters show photo ID like necessary to buy gun
@JayO304 thanks 4 good review. I usually hear from those	 who want to call me names because I disagrees with their particular orthodoxy
@TamrikoT @Hermius1 @loondale @yurko40a some fear&amp;criticism of Putin is justified,but much is paranoia  based on Cold War &amp; commie crimes
@TamrikoT @loondale @yurko40a whoever shot it down did so unintentionally, like the Ru airliner shot down by Ukr army couple of years ago
@SoulSurvivor60 @Reality_Alert U would have sent Jews back to be killed by Nazis. Ur reaction to saving Christians from genocide ugly
@KiraOnClimate so floods now,unlike many in past, R cause by CO2. Hmm. Were1930s hotter than anything  up till now, even though CO2 higher?
@SoulSurvivor60 @Reality_Alert so Christians in Middle East targeted for genocide must priority in being granted immigrant or refugee status
@RyanSmith_OC OK if Am people vote for Hillary, as they did for Obama, don‚Äôt expect Congress to get a 2/3 vote to override Prez vetoes.
@brookestewart @TomStewart Dem convention disgracefully highlighted families of blacks shot by police, result: murder of police around US
@RAWTheTerror01 Baloch &amp; Kashmiris independence decided by vote or killing will get worse. Those sympathetic with only one R hypocritical
@HBwriterMike will do my best, but if Hillary elected all our freedom at risk by her leftist appointees 2 Supreme Court &amp; gov agencies
@loondale @yurko40a takes 2 to turn conflict into peace. Minsk agreement is path. Ru should leave &amp; Kiev allow local people run provinces
@loondale @yurko40a
@loondale @yurko40a Today‚Äôs crisis tied 2 EU power brokers&amp;Ukr Oligarchs conspiring overthrow elected gov instead of waiting 4 next election
@loondale @yurko40a MH17 mistake.Ru should have admitted it as such &amp;could have compared it earlier downing of Ru airliner by Ukr forces
@yurko40a Ur hatred blinds U to path to peace. If democratically elected Ukr gov not been forcefully overthrown there would be NO Ukr crisis
@loondale @yurko40a U use MH17 downing 2 promote hatred&amp;war. I believe it not Intentional, same as when Ukr shot down Russian airliner
@AmishJihadi @loondale @yurko40a if U R doing what U think right &amp; stay with Ur agenda , nothing wrong with minor contribution from anyone.
@One_Man_BoyBand shameful corporate USA shields Red Chinese bosses from outrage over brutal repression of Valun Gung&amp; other spiritualists
@yurko40a those portraying me as Putin buddy do it to stifle a debate in which I am arguing that peace,rather than war, be our goal with Ru
@RAWTheTerror01 U seem to think that a lack of freedom in Kashmir excuses the bloody suppression of the Baloch people by PAK oppressors
@TALlama it is my opinion that this policy is consistent with what he is advocating.
@RAWTheTerror01 yes, if majority in a specific region do not want to be part of the United States they should vote to determine status
@RAWTheTerror01 don‚Äôt talk about elections, when you refuse to give Baloch right to vote on their own destiny
@chimdiya1 Kanu should be freed. Keeping him in jail undermines stability if people of Biafra R denied vote to determine who is their gov
@mtc6951 obviously we can‚Äôt afford to police the world or garrison every trouble spot. That will take a longer discussion. Good night
@mtc6951  level of US taxation can meet all needs&amp;responsibilities. Option of higher taxes hurts incentive 4  improving efficiency &amp; reform
@mtc6951 Ur a good person. i‚Äôm glad we had this conversation. someday I‚Äôll have gone that way too. Till then, will do my best,as I see it.
@roommom27 when Ur praying 4 me, which I welcome, make sure U ask 4 strength not to judge others, especially if they Politically disagree
@mtc6951 wrong! I feel strongly on this issue. Viewing all those who disagree as giving into sinister pressure  undermines respect 4 others
@mtc6951 thanks 4 sending that video. The few snickers didn‚Äôt even reflect that audience much less the Am people.  Romney didn‚Äôt push it.
@chimdiya1 Biafra needs to make its case. It is difficult to get attention of world‚Äôs free people, but there are nonviolent ways to do it
@mtc6951 Romny never argued this case. American people will support it if they hear it. This is alternative to brutal mass deportation.
@mtc6951 it stops with citizens &amp; legal immigrants. Jobs should go to them, as well as limited health&amp;education $, not people here illegally
@michaelbrollo right, E-verify for all jobs &amp; gov benefits, strictly enforced on employers &amp; those running gov programs.
@chimdiya1 the demand should not be independence but instead for an internationally supervised referendum to determine independence.
@mtc6951 OK let‚Äôs discuss illegal immigration, but none of the items U presented as mine has anything to do with me.
@chimdiya1 Biafran people have right to self determination. Permit vote on independence. Violent suppression will not bring peace or freedom
@mtc6951 Romney never argued his case. At a time of limited $ demanding jobs &amp; gov benefits go to Americans not illegals is right solution
@noreallyhowcome @lpaulsen769 No, it‚Äôs FU 2  voters when fanatics dismiss issue focused policy debate &amp; go 4 personal jabs:yes it‚Äôs typical
@noreallyhowcome @lpaulsen769 rad enviros hitting personally rather than  discuss Issues halted brush removal &amp; dumped H2O into ocean=fire
@noreallyhowcome @lpaulsen769 wow how  arrogant! u just confirmed personal attack rather than  dialogue on issue is typical enviro fanatics
@zenmastermiller the GOP Congress has passed numerous bills &amp; Prez Obama has sat on them
@RAWTheTerror01 Baloch &amp; Kashmir should decide national status with ballots not bullets via an honest referendum on self determination
@lpaulsen769 OK,like Gore, U obviously don‚Äôt want to discuss validity of policies that would control our lives to prevent GWarming. Typical
@latimes right, Al Gore warned of a 20 ft sea level jump, rad environs predicted a major jump in Temp. How many times can they be wrong?
@lpaulsen769 Gore aggressively proclaimed false info &amp; frightening predictions that served him well politically &amp; made hm big $ on his con
@baluchgurl @imPakistanii @Skrish_ @DrNeelakshiGswm no scum is someone who is Baloch but opposes right of Baloch a vote on independence
@zenmastermiller Al Gore, for example, refuses debate GWarming theory. His predictions failed &amp; he‚Äôs taken big $ from those he claims R bad
@lpaulsen769 not 15 yrs ago. To this day he refuses to debate GWarming theory, his predictions of gloom have not happened &amp; he‚Äôs taken big $
@RAWTheTerror01 they R same. They both deserve self determination vote
@RAWTheTerror01 I have been consistent in calling 4 self determination votes in Kashmir &amp; Baloch. Have U Ben consistent or R Unthe problem?
@apurvme @JanBalochistani @ArchenBaloch @SoosanBaloch @ShahmozG give Baloch vote &amp; there will be peace. They R courageous &amp; fight 4 freedom
@imPakistanii @Skrish_ @DrNeelakshiGswm if that is true then permitting Baloch to vote on staying in PAK or being independent should be easy
@Skrish_ @impakistanii @drneelakshigswm agree all people, be they Baloch or Kashmiri, have right to self determination via voting = peace
@lpaulsen769 false, not 15yrs ago, Gore 2 this day refuses Global Warming theory debate maybe cause his movie filled with failed predictions
@lpaulsen769 #OK in House Sci Cmtee hearing asked Prez Obama‚Äôs Science advisor if he backed 97o/o claim, even he wouldn‚Äôt back obvious lie
@lpaulsen769 why do U think Gore has refused to debate GWarming theory? Why do U think tangible challenges to claims, like 97o/o, R ignored
@lpaulsen769 open Ur mind. Slogans &amp; cliches(name calling) R being used to dismiss rather than refute arguments against CO2 AGW theory.
@lpaulsen769 only one‚Äôs denying sci R scare mongers &amp; fanatics refusing  2  argue specific CO2 theory related issues, but call names instead
@zenmastermiller OK U believe gov should mandate what we consume. I do not!what chemical put into one‚Äôs  body is up to the individual
@zenmastermiller give some real examples instead of blabbering personal insults. I confir with UCI scientists frequently, &amp; others weekly
@zenmastermiller is that photo of ship load of rad enviros trapped in ice they had gone to prove wasn‚Äôt there, then icebreaker stuck too?
@RAWTheTerror01 @hrw @KenRoth @amnesty @UNHumanRights time 4 U 2 be consistent  &amp; support referendum in Baloch &amp; Kashmir. If not U R problem
@Nick_Borquez Read both sides on Internet. 1st thing clear:prominent scientists on both sides thus xposing 97o/o claim, like others, fraud
@fruiteddragon OK how did U get rid of Ur pain?
@zenmastermiller How many scientists have U spoken to about this?I have spoken to hundreds, many prominent, who oppose GWarming theory.
@zenmastermiller my stands often based on principle gov should not mandate personal behavior, like forcing us to take a drug as part of H2O
@zenmastermiller that U  believe this obvious lie  means U‚Äôll believe anything. Even Obama‚Äôs sci advisor refused defend it. Open Ur mind
@zenmastermiller climates been changing 4 millions of yrs. blaming CO2 4 today‚Äôs climate is an excuse for global gov &amp; control of our lives
@Pakilander @Sukhia_Bugti @DrNeelakshiGswm @JITENDERGILL13 @Fatima_Baluch @UN @javaidShaikh open Ur eyes US has given PAK $billions
@SwiftWriter if U use fraudulent 97o/o number U destroy the credibility of other claims.
@SwiftWriter R U aware of the method used to come up with the fraudulent 97o/o claim?Even Prez Obama‚Äôs sci advisor refuses to defend it
@jagoo_123 @Fatima_Baluch if U R confident BALOCH don‚Äôt want independence U would support a referendum for Baloch to determine future
@suhailmaddie @Fatima_Baluch @DilSeyDesi I do what I can
@baz2000 had a corrupt democratic gov not been overthrown it removed in an election This horrible Ukr crisis would not have happened
@j_laumann @kittenninja42 @tsnowbird5000 Ru is run by tough people &amp; has no democratic tradition. That does not make their gov an enemy.
@tsnowbird5000 @j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky sabotaging should stop &amp; cooperation begin.Ru &amp; USA have common threats &amp; interests.
@j_laumann @tsnowbird5000 @SteveKomarnycky Those agreements good start in bettering Ru &amp;US.relations so our economies &amp; security Improve
@Sukhia_Bugti @DrNeelakshiGswm @JITENDERGILL13 @Fatima_Baluch @UN US can‚Äôt do it for Baloch but we can Stop PAK from using our weapons
@tsnowbird5000 @j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky good relationship with Ru vital 4 peace &amp; prosperity of my country. New Cold War horrible 4 both
@Sukhia_Bugti @DrNeelakshiGswm @JITENDERGILL13 @Fatima_Baluch @UN US military aid to PAK must end if murder/repression of Baloch continue
@j_laumann @tsnowbird5000 @SteveKomarnycky US expanded NATO, economically isolated Ru, attacked  Iraq &amp; other Pro Ru regimes, before Putin
@tsnowbird5000 @j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky @kittenninja42 one way or	 other U.S./Ru need cooperate. If Putin gone, hostility toward Ru same
@JB_Bugti Baloch do not stand alone. PAK has declared war on humanity in its mass murder &amp; repression of Baloch &amp; it‚Äôs support of terrorism
@j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky @tsnowbird5000 @kittenninja42 Erdogan is destroying freedom in Turkey to cover corruption at high levels
@GooseNetworkUSA @emretrk76 @faruktaban @Andrey123419 @Andrey123418 Gulenists seem open minded,pro freedom&amp;Positive Islamists.
@tsnowbird5000 @j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky @kittenninja42 forces in USA &amp; Ru want new Cold War instead of cooperation against Rad Islam terr
@iJITENDERGILL13 @Fatima_Baluch @UN @DrNeelakshiGswm @sudhirchaudhary all who love freedom,especially Americans, must respect&amp;support Baloch
@JITENDERGILL13 @Fatima_Baluch @UN @DrNeelakshiGswm @sudhirchaudhary Americans waking up to PAK terrorist support &amp; murder of Baloch
@tsnowbird5000 @j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky @kittenninja42 US elites aggressively hostile 2 Ru,not just Putin,benefiting mutual Islam enemies
@SteveKomarnycky @j_laumann @tsnowbird5000 @kittenninja42 @TheJusticeDept @FBI I despise communism &amp;long fought their tyranny, U mirror them
@SteveKomarnycky @j_laumann @tsnowbird5000 @kittenninja42 @TheJusticeDept @FBI Our discussion  enlightening as to Ur anti democratic mindset
@j_laumann @SteveKomarnycky @tsnowbird5000 @kittenninja42 @nytimes @washingtonpost commies have the same conspiracy mindset as U. Get real
@SteveKomarnycky @j_laumann @tsnowbird5000 @kittenninja42 @TheJusticeDept @FBI Ur denial of honest disagreement = Same as commies.
@SteveKomarnycky @j_laumann @tsnowbird5000 @kittenninja42 @TheJusticeDept @FBI U know ittle of how  demo gov works &amp; nothing how US works
@IVAN04544391 Rad Islamic Terrorism would have been obliterated by now had Obama not been Prez, what he did or did not invent irrelevant
@ChrisDornbush it didn‚Äôt work but good try
@RAKhan8844 @vijendersachdev PAK gov will kill anyone who resists their tyranny or terrorism
@RAKhan8844 @kirankhan0152 @narendramodi your double standard undermines your credibility
@RAKhan8844 @kirankhan0152 @narendramodi Your double standard is disappointing
@airscottdenning thanks for stepping in. Do it more often
@SteveKomarnycky @IVAN04544391 right my spelling is poor but my logic and up frontness is OK
@lostson_ @kittenninja42 @b_ofrights @sergeiolevskii @SteveKomarnycky @TheJusticeDept @FBI does that mean even current Ukr gov is commie
@Tenax_Imperii @SteveKomarnycky when U have fought communism as long as I, then U can  ask that question until then Ur an ass
@vijendersachdev I agree
@sergeiolevskii @SteveKomarnycky @b_ofrights @TheJusticeDept @FBI keep proclaiming all those who disagree Ru agents. It exposes U not them
@SteveKomarnycky like in Odessa!
@SteveKomarnycky I have said it many times. By the way the USA has invaded countries when a democratically elected leader overthrown
@kirankhan0152 @narendramodi I applaud anyone who supports Baloch self determination &amp; wants to name a street after me
@b_ofrights @SteveKomarnycky @TheJusticeDept @FBI what is it
@timreckmeyer @MichaelEMann answer is no, but remember acquiescing to demands for yes or no answers is not requirement for tweeter dialogue
@b_ofrights @SteveKomarnycky @TheJusticeDept @FBI my observation people calling those who disagree ‚Äúpuppets‚Äù R either ignorant or arrogant
@timreckmeyer Only CO2 impact on human health is greater production of food, a plus. More efficient energy with less particulents good goal
@timreckmeyer @MichaelEMann B 4 CO2 theory same bunch opposed oil&amp;gas development, like Alarskan pipeline &amp; offshore. BS excuses then&amp;now
@SteveKomarnycky so politicians who replaced Yano R not corrupt? All the violence Ru‚Äôs fault? The EU &amp; Oligarch military units not involved?
@SteveKomarnycky again, I side with Democracy &amp; self determination. Yano corrupt &amp; not popular thus voters would have removed him right way
@SteveKomarnycky I believe some of those shot were murdered by Ukr Oligarch thugs in collusion with EU power brokers to justify overthrow
@SteveKomarnycky Mannafort is a political operative. He has legally contributed to large number of campaigns, mine was at the very low end
@SteveKomarnycky @b_ofrights @TheJusticeDept @FBI if Yano thrown out by voters in next election Ukr crisis would not have happened, right?
@SteveKomarnycky @b_ofrights @TheJusticeDept @FBI I laid out basis of my position on Ukr crisis, Ur answer seems yet another personal jab
@timreckmeyer economic sense says free market will produce less polluting energy. Global gov mandates based on GWarming absurd power grab
@airscottdenning five yrs ago CO2 meant more hurricanes, tornados &amp; dead polar bears was Baloney. Now floods, draught, rain &amp; fire blamed.
@timreckmeyer CO2 increases food production has minuscule impact on global temp, because it is minuscule part of atmosphere,unlike the sun
@kirankhan0152 I do not make comments on every occurrence concerning Baloch or any other subject
@zakavkaza they were replaced in next election which is what should have happened to Yanocovich
@zakavkaza I sat in Maidan tent encampment to get rid of last commie. The free election brought my anti-Commie friends to power, corrupt too
@SteveKomarnycky Mannafort=hired poly advisor not corrupt. Ukr politicians on both sides are corrupt, that‚Äôs why Yanocovich got elected
@SteveKomarnycky @b_ofrights @TheJusticeDept @FBI I hear horrible stories about both sides. Time to implement the Minsk agreement.
@SteveKomarnycky cut the accomplice crap. Trying to intimidate people into silence is what U claim to oppose yet U exemplify it.
@SteveKomarnycky Demonstrators free to protest 4 long time. Why did it change? Did protest turn violent? Oligarch street warriors showed up
@SteveKomarnycky how many snipers been prosecuted? BBC had video of police being shot before any demonstrators.
@NATOAustritt @DrJillStein @Snowden Pardon if he only exposed gov over reach. If he provided Ru with US secrets jail him 4 a long long time
@b_ofrights @SteveKomarnycky @TheJusticeDept @FBI U R just being frivilous? Frightening someone may believe policy decisions made that way
@b_ofrights @SteveKomarnycky @TheJusticeDept @FBI time is on the side of truth. I keep calling the shots as I see them.
@SteveKomarnycky yes the EU power brokers &amp; th Ukr oligarchs couldn‚Äôt for next election so they overthrew elected gov &amp; created crisis
@Pdweanwa7654 Ur name calling is evil &amp; sinful. U ignore Ukr crisis created when EU power brokers &amp; Ukr oligarchs overthrew an elected gov.
@SteveKomarnycky No I never suggested he was not corrupt, as R those Power brokers who overthrew him rather than waiting for next election
@SteveKomarnycky when did I boast of a relationship with Manafort. A minor campaign contribution one year? U make personal attacks &amp; lie
@SteveKomarnycky When President corrupt let voters kick him out...that‚Äôs democracy which U &amp; Ur Oligarch team clearly don‚Äôt believe in.
@SteveKomarnycky U lie about what I believe. Ukr plagued with corrupt leaders, even now. But the EU &amp; oligarch buddies couldn‚Äôt wait 4 vote
@SteveKomarnycky elected in OSCE certified election, overthrown by corrupt oligarchs &amp; EU power brokers unwilling to wait for next election
@SteveKomarnycky who R U to say he is my buddy. U can‚Äôt even argue an issue without resorting to personal attack, exposing U not me
@SteveKomarnycky yes he was elected in an OSCE verified election then overthrown by Ukr oligarchs in collusion with EU power brokers
@TCleveland4Real @j2JaneJerome he donated so little suggests Ur personal jab has no substance &amp; U   approach is not logical refutation
@surjoo @JLenczowski @SteveKingIA @SputnikInt  After arrogant unrelenting hostility from US, we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised Ru leans toward China
@BreeneMurphy I put enormous energy into building a electric self financing container mover system for LB&amp;LA ports. They had no vision
@BreeneMurphy when millions of illegal immigrants R permitted to drive older more polluting vehicles we get worse air quality.
@Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss get real! under Obama only step forward Mj done in Congress. Hillary promises schedule 2 which makes things worse
@Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss @chiefgreenbud U obviously have a gross perspective if that‚Äôs the best creative put down U can come up with
@Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss @chiefgreenbud both sides curtail liberty,unlike Obama,GOP elected advocating what they support once in office
@Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss @chiefgreenbud if voters choose advocate of position then he does the opposite, like Obama on Mj, it is betrayal
@tellmore27 U must mistakenly believe that Tweeters have obligation to explain whatever anyone demands of them.
@kirankhan0152 @tellmore27 open Ur eyes
@emretrk76 @faruktaban @Andrey123419 @Andrey123418 guess that represents the best arguments U R capable of
@RadicalRuss correct
@Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss @chiefgreenbud elected advocating issue is an unborn child is far different than Obama‚Äôs betrayal once elected
@ATLbpckr @Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss @chiefgreenbud Unlike other politicians, Obama, himself,had the power to make the change. He did not.
@kirankhan0152 @faujitweets try H Res 123 of 104th Congress &amp; H Con Res 162 of 105th Congress, then apologize to.Baloch &amp; other PAK victims
@tellmore27 should be referendum in Kashmir &amp; Baloch. hypocrites who support a vote only for one should shut up &amp; admit they R the problem
@tellmore27  while murdering its own people(like Baloch)PAKgov supports Islamic terrorists in neighboring Afghan &amp; India
@Hardrock1a @RadicalRuss @chiefgreenbud Wrong, Obama called this one. the liberal/left wants power&amp;control to protect us from ourselves.
@HwkUk I haven‚Äôt seen it. Thanks for the good review.
@kirankhan0152 @faujitweets I submitted Kashmir legislation 2 ultimate forum, USCongress. Ur hypocracy &amp; condoning murder of Baloch evident
@kambocya @ZehraakilL @Andrey123418 @Andrey123419 @faruktaban @hizmet_news @YouTube U &amp; our friends,the Turkish people, R losing Ur freedom
@annamarienzi I am a fan of brave patriots keeping us safe and energetic activists who struggle to keep us free of oppressive gov at home
@kirankhan0152 @faujitweets  not Ur researcher. My support self determination,including Kashmir, well known. Ur hypocrisy on Baloch evident
@annamarienzi @YALiberty I am flattered
@zoyyaa4 well, thanks for appreciating those things we agree upon
@kirankhan0152 @faujitweets Ur inability 2 find my many Kashmir statements doesn‚Äôt excuse Ur hypocrisy &amp; lack of principle concerning Baloch
@InfoAgeStrategy is someone paying U to personally attack those who disagree or R U just to stupid to argue Ur own beliefs
@kirankhan0152 @FatimaAli52 @AyishaBaloch if U R can‚Äôt figure ind even one Baloch who wants a referendums no wonder U can‚Äôt find anything
@mags_cooney @POTUS Obama elected President not King. His ‚Äúmy way or the hwy‚Äù approach, ignoring oversight requests, nixed cooperation
@molodyko look in mirror to see the Soviet mindset. This led to the overthrow of a Democratically elected UKr gov instead using elections
@molodyko Ur name calling, rather than arguing issues, same as Communists I‚Äôve fought all my life. Shame on U for accepting gangster mindset
@Sukhia_Bugti @Gen_VKSingh @SushmaSwaraj @narendramodi @IndianDiplomacy Baloch freedom movement seeks same self determination as Kashmir.
@erythingistaken @Siddiq_bugti @hindustanse @POTUS @rajnathsingh Comparing women to animals says more about U than it does about them.
@mags_cooney too bad our Prez refuses to compromise or even make a deal &amp; thus is unable to work within a democratic process of give &amp; take
@kirankhan0152 @AyishaBaloch give it up. U exposed lack of morality by complaining about Kashmir but supporting same repression of Baloch,
@kirankhan0152 @FatimaAli52 @AyishaBaloch knowing U do not oppose suppression of Baloch makes Ur support for Kashmir meaningless
@kirankhan0152 @FatimaAli52 @AyishaBaloch PAK refuses to let Baloch determine future via a vote then kills them if they demand it.
@BeauJaxe might support it as policy for all Congress. Would not do it unilaterally. However,it will shift power to unelected gov employees
@kirankhan0152 @FatimaAli52 @AyishaBaloch U ignore I condemned it 4 over decade, U then ignore death of innocent Baloch who want referendum
@kirankhan0152 @FatimaAli52 @AyishaBaloch be clear on this, PAK murders Baloch to terrorize them into submission. Let them have a vote!
@kirankhan0152 @FatimaAli52 If U don‚Äôt see similarity between 2 peoples denied self determination vote, U R not guided by moral principles
@kirankhan0152 if U oppose for the Baloch what U support for Kashmir U R a hypocrite &amp; an apologist 4 murder &amp; suppression of Baloch
@kirankhan0152 I support Kashmir referendum &amp; condemn force used against those demanding it. U R hypocrite if U oppose it 4 Baloch
@MehroozAhmed what is your specific question? I thought I had given you an answer that covered the issues you asked about.
@Andrey123419 @Andrey123418 Erdogan is covering up his own attacks on Turkey‚Äôs democratic institutions &amp;suppression of those who opposed him
@Andrey123419 @Andrey123418 Erdogan destroying democracy in Turkey 4 yrs one step at a time .Now with an excuse he becomes Islamic dictator
@arb7656769 @faissal82175 Leaders in powerful countries fear PAK gov, influenced by Radical Islamic fascist, will give A-bomb to terrorists
@BanRadicals @hrw Baloney! Same said about Baloch or Kashmir or any nationalist group denied a vote to determine their status. U R 4 murder
@BanRadicals @hrw First consideration is basic principle in question,in this case self-determination. U R unprincipled thus failed phase one
@BanRadicals @hrw Ur Kashmir &amp; Baloch double standard exposes U as enemy of freedom unless it benefits U. U condone murderous PAK oppression
@BanRadicals @hrw I already have. Ten years ago. I have  been consistent now U so same by supporting referendum for Baloch
@BanRadicals @hrw that is correct and the same is true of Baloch
@BanRadicals @hrw a referendum needed so people of Kashmir can decide their future. PAK so brutal&amp;corrupt they R not likely to join PAK
@ChrisDornbush Chris I never am impressed when someone tweets me something that is exactly like what a number of others tweeted.. Hmm
@Baloshi_issue many people from my district &amp; throughout the world, especially Baloch, tweet me. I don‚Äôt have time to answer them all.
@Ceist8 keep telling Urself that dribble. u can‚Äôt argue Ur case because U haven‚Äôt been open minded enough 2 consider the arguments of others
@Ricky_Llerandi I appreciate thanks but not necessary this time. Arecibo telescope vital to warning earth of dangerous meteors &amp; astroids
@cartoon_villain I‚Äôve always been available 4 debate with my opponent. Last time around Susan‚Äôs schedule did not match mine&amp; vice versa
@Ceist8 Ur method personal hits rather than arguing a case 4 what U believe. R U in High School? State Ur case &amp; discuss it like an adult
@spo1981 Ted appears to be a sore loser. He broke his pledge to GOP voters to support the winner, unlike Reagan who rallied behind Ford
@Ceist8 that‚Äôs a bit of wisdom
@Ceist8 only people who R stupid &amp; can‚Äôt think for themselves claim everyone who is intelligent agrees them
@Andrey123418 sorry Andrey I don‚Äôt remember Ur admonition &amp; I don‚Äôt know what you mean by US breaking Turkey
@Ceist8 I enjoy creative digs, Urs was not. Better 2 argue points of contention than amateurish dismissal as if all Intelligent people agree
@mystic_saahil I have long advocated referendum so people of Kashmir can decide own destiny.  People denied ballots will turn to bullets
@jamalnasir72 all U R doing is covering fact that U oppose giving Baloch a vote, which would solve the issue with ballots not bullets.
@Ceist8 typical of AGW advocates, all I‚Äôve heard from U is personal attacks rather than scientific argument over fact or interpretation.
@jamalnasir72 Sovereignty=consent of the governed.PAK murder of Baloch,not exposing ISI crimes &amp; corruption, makes mockery of sovereignty
@FiliusLiberatus enough of Ur efforts to elected Hilary. I am a mouthpiece 4 nothing except what I believe. I was Cruz guy, Trump won
@FiliusLiberatus had enough of Ur  efforts to help Hillary. I am not a Mouthpiece for anything but what I believe
@jamalnasir72 PAK can stop this madness by permitting a vote on independence. If Baloch nationalists lose election their freedom fight ends
@jamalnasir72 I do something first, I‚Äôm not U.S. Gov. If U oppose ending PAK systematic murder of Baloch by giving them vote, U R accomplice
@jamalnasir72 Ur inability to support referendum for Baloch to decide their fate undermines any credibility U have about Kashmir.
@jamalnasir72 For 20 yrs I have been on record that a referendum in Kashmir should let the people there decide their future...same as Baloch
@cr8iveminority U R mistaking the mujahideen with the Talibn. After 9-11 Muj became Northern Alliance and defeated Taliban.
@IT4America thought U were hitting elected officials who haven‚Äôt accomplished their mission, even though they tried.
@JAlvarez1189 Erdogan systematically undermined Democratic gov in Turkey:destroyed vibrant free press, jailed opponents,Turks deserve better
@wmdpossessor some of us tried hard to end aid to PAK. At least we stopped F-16s.
@CalgaryGuy1 what a joke: a complaint others R interfering, even supporting terrorism, in PAK,which supports terrorists &amp; murders own people
@cr8iveminority Taliban created by Saudis &amp; Paks. U.S. went along, which was mistake. Former King should have returned. PAKs blocked it
@RAWTheTerror01 I condemn brutal attacks on Muslims in Burma. I was a major supporter of  Kosovos right to independence from Serbs.
@jamalnasir72 I have long supported referendum for Kashmir. Whatever happens there no excuse 4 bloody suppression of Baloch
@jamalnasir72 then let Baloch have referendum to determine future,like Scotland. Opposing vote confirms Baloch R help against their will
@FiliusLiberatus I am guessing that the photo is of leftist paid to go to GOP rallies. I am wondering  who pays U 2 help Hillary get elected
@FiliusLiberatus here‚Äôs it tip, Ur activity is electing Hillary. I am comfortable with the result of the GOP primary elections&amp; caucuses.
@IT4America guess U believe soldiers who fight for freedom R worthless unless they win...Shame on U
@FiliusLiberatus I take it U R being paid or self motivated see Hillary elected President, which explains the targets of Ur negative focus
@FiliusLiberatus guess U think all those guys fighting the Nazis in WWII sold out by agreeing to cooperate with Stalin to defeat Hitler,
@CalgaryGuy1 what a joke: Pakistan partisan claiming someone else supports terrorists because they oppose Pakistan‚Äôs pro terrorist regime
@JRGrayThunder nope
@sbwest I did just that!
@Baloshi_issue there are so many things &amp; so many people vying 4 the attention of US decision-makers. The courageous Baloch go unnoticed
@rebel_romantic thank you for the generous praise.
@Aleksandr1212B many of us trying to prevent conflict between Ru &amp; USA. Am political elite hostility toward Ru does not reflect Am people
@LoneStrStatment I support their right to vote on it.
@YesCalifornia right, all people, including us in Calif. have a right to determine our future with a direct vote of everyone here legally
@YesCalifornia NO!!
@hiralald he should never have been President.
@ashleydavidovna I enjoy a funny put down. Unfortunately, this one was slap stick &amp; personal abuse not thought provoking humorous refutation
@MAPoladian a former staffer, no longer works for me thus ree to advocate what she wants. I told her I disagree with her on this
@KMartinezReport good exchange...thank you
@SpaceSherpa too bad Salon never bothered to fact check or even ask me. A significant part of their article is total BS.
@KMartinezReport because an SOB likes it, it doesn‚Äôt means it‚Äôs wrong. It may mean it is the one thing he‚Äôs got right..but he‚Äôs still an SOB
@valjean00 So war with Russia would be good for USA?Russians can help us defeat Rad Islamic Terrorists, which Obama can‚Äôt do or even say
@rebel_romantic I am certainly a voice opposing a new Cold War with Russia. If U think that not in america‚Äôs interest don‚Äôt vote 4 me
@Ceist8 U think that because U R afraid 2 look &amp; consider other people‚Äôs opinions.U dismiss rather than refute arguments contrary 2 Ur views
@gabrielroberts the most affective way of accomplishing Ur goal is be very active getting out the voter for the GOP nominee &amp; exposing fraud
@Ceist8 so Ur mind is so closed that U R unaware of large number of prominent scientists &amp; their specific disagreements.
@KMartinezReport it makes no sense to permit those here illegally same as citizens &amp; not expect tens of millions more to come illegally
@KMartinezReport Ur initial tweet indicated No one should be denied healthcare, which would bankrupt system. Now U change the subject.
@KMartinezReport sorry, I read Ur tweet &amp; thought U called 4 gov paid healthcare 4 everyone, including illegal Immigrants, which is undoable
@FiliusLiberatus irony, some patriots R actually ensuring 4 more Yrs lib/left control of White House by refusing to back GOP nominee
@RyanSmith_OC OK will do
@KMartinezReport so when do we go broke &amp; R unable to care for US citizens. Free healthcare will attract at least another 100 million here
@TheBigAssholes Your tweet name is well chosen
@Iceblue52Roth I support creating fed no-sale-to list of all convicted felons, psycho-drug users, &amp; others who R put on by court order.
@Iceblue52Roth If honest citizens can‚Äôt get guns that statistic will dramatically change, once bad guys know  victims R unarmed
@Iceblue52Roth exactly right!! I bounce between outrage &amp; despair when it comes to F-35. Why:Ike called it the military/industrial complex
@GildedCage_ if it is secret how do you know
@CaroleWadeNpBch great picture. Your a well motivated person, but we disagree on this one.
@CaroleWadeNpBch no more people will drive under influence than today. More law enforcement time &amp; resources available to fight real crime
@CaroleWadeNpBch respectfully disagree. If legal cannabis use won‚Äôt go up, but product will be labeled &amp; $ won‚Äôt finance terrorist&amp;mobsters
@FeedPhilosophy time to stand for right of honest citizens to defend themselves rather than on side of criminals who want to disarm them
@FeedPhilosophy don‚Äôt disarm honest citizens so criminals will be empowered to kill them. Help the victims not the criminals
@jennxlai I will see that the criminals R punished rather than trying to make it more difficult for honest citizens to defend themselves
@FeedPhilosophy we just disagree on what best for Public Safety. I believe disarming honest citizens empowers criminals &amp; make things worse
@KhanEsq what would be worse is having Rad Islamic Terrorist in control of Egypt, which is what was thwarted when SiSi stepped up
@brainouty OK I didn‚Äôt support Trump in primary either. Using Ur revulsion of him no excuse 2 lie &amp;  undermine integrity of election system
@Ceist8 not about U publishing a paper. About U recognizing there is large number of prominent scientists who don‚Äôt support AGW theory
@KulbariB Baloch have same right as Brits &amp; Scots to self determination. The murderous repression by PAK gov is to grotesque to be ignored
@KulbariB time 4 good people of world 2 quit ignoring murderous repression of freedom seeking Baloch by the corrupt/terrorist PAK gov
@MHBugti  brave Baloch people R in heroic struggle 4 basic right of self determination.Scotch &amp; Brits have their right so should Baloch
@FiliusLiberatus U find creative ways 2 describe it but U advocate betraying those who voted in the primaries &amp; Breaking a commitment
@RandyMetheny Randy thanks for being so vocal about it. Ur strong endorsement of my opponent should push voters in the right direction,
@FiliusLiberatus scanning what U sent left me thinking Dem crossovers hated Trump thus did it to vote against Trump
@RandyMetheny
@Earth_Architect yes, Hillary‚Äôs self enrichment, cover up of husbands rapes &amp; her stone walling on Bengazi will at last catch up with her
@Earth_Architect voters may be more upset with Hillary enriching self &amp; covering up husbands rapes than  legal campaign donations to GOP
@Commoncents4me For years Cong compromise held:no fed funding of abortion providers. Now left fanatics insist prolife taxpayers must pay
@RandyMetheny based on Ur self description, it is a bit presumptuous to threaten to kick out republican office holders in Orange County
@Uturkey1 will support no-sale-to fed list of all felons, selected psycho drug users &amp; those put on the list with a court order
@atdor Some people don‚Äôt know enough to refute the . arguments of those with whom they disagree &amp; thus make personal attacks. Shame on you
@atdor I live in Orange County 10 minutes from the beach. My family is there. Ur gratitude 4 my willingness be away from them is noted
@MiddlewayA that is a stupid word game
@Earth_Architect Ur arrogant name calling exemplifies closed minded Global Warming fanatics who believe all those who disagree R on the take
@MMandil will do so in a few days. A little dicey to do that now
@flatcatcanyon if U haven‚Äôt seen me admit being wrong U haven‚Äôt been looking.Try my admitting my support 4 Bush invading Iraq was mistake
@MiddlewayA I am overseas working to defeat Rad Islamic Terrorism. u know the gang Prez Obama can get himself to mention
@Ceist8 overseas &amp; a bit busy.Will send U a few names &amp; studies when I get back. If U R open-minded U might Google &amp; U‚Äôll find lots of them
@Ceist8 baloney. major figures in various fields of science have aggressively refuted Gobal Warming claims only to be ignored &amp;/or vilified
@FiliusLiberatus I was pro Ted Cruz. All candidates gave word to support winner of primary process. Lying  wrong, as is ignoring GOP voters
@ReaderJoy yes, and many more may have died if gov made it harder for victims to defend themselves
@jennxlai don‚Äôt know the details but in most cases it certainly wouldn‚Äôt help to make it harder for the victim to defend him or herself
@Ceist8 when Prominent scientist rejects Global Warming Theory his reasoning ignored &amp; personal attacks begin, honest discussion thwarted
@ReaderJoy I don‚Äôt see why people want lots of things, but if they are honest citizens it‚Äôs their business. Other aproaches better.
@ReaderJoy U may not have noticed compared to almost all other Members of Cong, I raise very little, most of it from OC residents
@Tbonekitty71 how about the fact that for 26 yrs I‚Äôve been re-elected here by solid majorities. who elected U to speak for OC voters?
@gabrielroberts i‚Äô i‚Äôm not as good at this as you are. Thanks for understanding
@_Beeeeebo I enjoy dialogue with regular people, especially my constituents.
@gabrielroberts when mentioned I try to respond, not paying attention to who. If you don‚Äôt want to hear my response I suggest U block me
@ReaderJoy I enjoy spirited dialogue, especially with my constituents. Unfortunately too many can‚Äôt disagree without calling names
@Normsmusic the shame is Ur repeating the lie that Dems denied vote on gun control.  They had every right to offer it as  motion to recommit
@terencemyers If U would retire 2nd Amendment do you feel same about the freedom of speech &amp; press guaranteed by the First amendment
@ReaderJoy After setting that as Ur standard, U can‚Äôt possibly support Hillary...right?
@ReaderJoy Ur idea that those who disagree with U R just bought off is both arrogant and ignorant. Further, Among incumbents I raise little
@ReaderJoy Ur lack of knowledge breadth taking. districts were drawn by independent commission. Before that by Dem controlled legislature
@_Beeeeebo yes many I have been radical Islamists, which Prez Obama refuses to acknowledge
@GoGoAliza U bend over backwards not to relate this monstrous crime to the radical Islamic terrorism that motivated the other slaughters
@_Beeeeebo I‚Äôve been talking about a compromise but it is ignored cause Dems only want to control honest citizens not criminals
@_Beeeeebo one of the prerequisites to obtaining  a psycho drug is agreeing to be on the no gun list.
@_Beeeeebo no and yes
@ReaderJoy how open-minded of you. If someone disagrees with you they must be bought off. Get a life, honest people can disagree
@GoGoAliza One is intrusive to those who have never committed a crime the other focuses on criminals &amp; psycho drug users
@BrentWagner what would U think about someone unable to use word nazi when dealing  with an anti-Semitic street thug wearing a swastika
@raylancione cut the word games. Prez Obama can‚Äôt even say Islamic terrorist to describe him. That‚Äôs what I call him
@BrentWagner Obama‚Äôs inability to say Islamic Terrorist &amp; his lying about Bengazi &amp; other terrorist attacks, undermines our security
@_Beeeeebo be active get involved in the democratic process. I respect that.
@cartoon_villain It takes more than a tweet 2 answer Ur question. We will give it a try on another occasion.
@bhubbard_j I am not on vacation. I will be in the Middle East doing a job that needs to be done.
@GoGoAliza I support a fed list of all felons &amp; psycho drug users 4 whom guns can‚Äôt be sold. Dems focus on controlling honest citizens
@BrentWagner so U make a totally false statement about ability of Dems to get a vote in their issue and U label my position as bullshit.
@BrentWagner U have bought the Dems lie. Dems have right to offer any issue as a Motion to recommit &amp; it will be voted on by full House
@skrutsick my constituents directly argue their case with me via tweeter.
@_Beeeeebo Don‚Äôt force a blaze attitude toward being murdered on others. Do U live I n a gated community? Do U have children?
@_Beeeeebo more difficult for honest citizens to own a gun= robbers &amp; other criminals more likely to break into home &amp; hurt you
@thesum Dems could have had a vote on any gun issue they wanted. Instead they pretended not to have that right&amp; destroyed rules of order
@_Beeeeebo no, Prez Obama‚Äôs soft peddling Islamic terrorism impacts on FBI who twice interviewed Orlando killer, but didn‚Äôt get job done
@julianna12369 fewer guns in hands of honest citizens means they are more vulnerable
@julianna12369 not sarcasm, straight disagreement.
@julianna12369 oh so U just will keep guns from everybody(except criminals, of course)
@julianna12369 yes, when it is hard to get permit to carry, few people have gun to stop these mass killings
@LarryTenney no, terrorist in Orlando would have been in captivity if FBI ignored Prez Obamas 	Refusal to even say Rad Islamic Terrorism
@_Beeeeebo So you want to take away guns from Honest citizens,
@LarryTenney Dems R lying when they claim they can not get a gun control vote. They R lying to justify their destruction of rules of order,
@_Beeeeebo if After terrorist attack U focus on disarming honest citizens you are putting more Americans  in danger
@LarryTenney Dems can bring any gun control issue up for a vote. Instead they arrogantly destroy rules of Order that protect rights of all
@julianna12369 disarming honest citizens instead of criminals and terrorists will cause more to die
@noelleann2 Please show compassion by not blaming a gun rather than a terrorist, then disarming other Americans making them vulnerable
@policyconcerns @GavinNewsom @SenatorBoxer Is that your position, that  marj should only be an infraction?
@policyconcerns @GavinNewsom @SenatorBoxer it is a freedom issue. gov control the private behavior of adults is not consistent with liberty
@efinkelnburg @_Beeeeebo I have solution: no sale list of felons &amp; psycho drug users, the Dems instead insist on disarming honest citizens
@efinkelnburg @_Beeeeebo That is up to the voters and they have known my position on this for 27 yrs and reelected me with large margins.
@efinkelnburg @_Beeeeebo tell that to victims in Orlando, San Berdu, Boston, Ft. Hood, ect,ect.
@_Beeeeebo @efinkelnburg How about terrorist lady in San Berdu or Boston bombers. Even the Orlando terrorist,US born, but in&amp;out of Saudi
@efinkelnburg @_Beeeeebo  I mentioned 2 policies that contribute 2 threat.Lives saved if lady in San Berdu  thoroughly  vetted,
@policyconcerns @GavinNewsom @SenatorBoxer So take it off books not enforced. Even misdemeanor status costs cop time and court time.
@_Beeeeebo @efinkelnburg Prez Obama's Immigration and terrorist policies have put us in danger &amp; Americans are paying a dear price
@_Beeeeebo @spo1981 Yes&amp; refusing to state flat out Rad Islamic Terrorists R the major such threat our Prez Obama has left it an open ended
@spo1981 @noelleann2 No way. I voted to pass legislation that the President threatened to veto. His veto would have shut down the gov.
@spo1981 absolutely right and he points you have brought up are legitimate issues.
@noelleann2 I support a list of all felons and psycho meds users and it be illegal to sell a gun to them. Dems want 2 disarm honest citizens
@Tbonekitty71 Anyone can be put on a no fly list. How about a list of felons &amp; pycho medicine users. Will not disarm honest citizen
@CapitalRadioOne More name calling doesn't make Ur case. In all Ur yrs of surfing did U notice the oil wells off Huntington &amp; Seal?
@_Beeeeebo @spo1981 Obama's unwillingness to state a number of mass killings committed by Rad Islamic terrorist thwarted prevention
@_Beeeeebo @spo1981 Obviously most Muslims R not &amp; do not support terrorism. Just as clear,a segment of Muslims R susceptible to terrorism.
@noelleann2  U think all with strong views should prevent system from functioning  unless they agree with you?
@efinkelnburg @_Beeeeebo remember the fellow who misquoted me on that already admitted he got it wrong. "immigration &amp; terrorist polices"
@mattfiller @SpeakerRyan Our Prez can't even use the words Rad Islamic Terrorist &amp; you think making it harder for honest citizens to the way
@CapitalRadioOne I believe convicted felons and those on Psycho drugs be on don't sell guns ist. That would not disarm honest citizens
@CapitalRadioOne Guess U think anybody who disagrees with U is a bad person and doesn't care like you do. Get a life. Have you ever surfed?
@cartoon_villain you can‚Äôt see there is a difference?
@cartoon_villain no but I may be it interpreting differently.
@TaraSetmayer we sure did, maybe even more in the time ahead
@cartoon_villain the two are not same. Forcing people to act as if they R &amp; base public policy on it will have negative consequences
@jennxlai many gang shootings involve illegal immigrants &amp; or convicted felons, disarming honest citizens will make that problem worse
@spo1981 right U have made no attempt to refute basic premise nor my charge Obama‚Äôs ultra weak stance on ISLAMIC terrorism makes it worse
@spo1981 guess U can‚Äôt read I said tough standards on TERRORISM and immigration. So U think no impact of tougher standards on terrorism
@spo1981 immigration policy has made us more susceptible to Rad Islamic Terrorism. Our President can‚Äôt e even use the words
@waterfrontcomic I am advocating that any Muslims with Rad connections be more intensely scrutinized than what our Prez is providing
@spo1981 look you‚Äôve ignored central point I have been making. That doesn‚Äôt seem strange because You obviously disagree with basic premise
@ModmanTracy not shooter. In short meeting his father talked about on current situation in Aghanistan. He is not a friend or even aquaitence
@spo1981 simple. Instead of more strenuous efforts to thwart Rad Islamic terrorists, Prez advocating more   control of honest citizens
@RandyMetheny this President unleashed IRS &amp; fed regulators on political opponents thus untrustworthy to put names on no fly-no guns list
@spo1981 why don‚Äôt you try advocating what you believe rather than characterizing what I believe and why I believe it.
@cartoon_villain Ur fixation on limiting rights of honest citizens is absurd. where R Ur tweets asking tougher scrutiny of Rad Islamist inUS
@cartoon_villain credible studies means the one‚Äôs U agree with. I won‚Äôt support more  restrictions on honest citizens rather than criminals
@cartoon_villain correct people‚Äôs private lives should be kept private rather than forcing others to accept.
@spo1981 guns &amp; uncontrolled immigration &amp; attitude down playing Islamic terrorist threat = slaughter in Orlando
@spo1981 When Prez can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúRad Islamic Terrorist‚Äù investigators don‚Äôt push too hard on suspects, as happened with Orlando terrorist
@PrideandPop he was a US citizen who is in contact with terrorist and whose threatening behavior &amp; statements had been reported
@PrideandPop I am pleased U aggressively argue your case. I do my own tweets and enjoy the dialogue. If I was your teacher I‚Äôd give you an A
@PrideandPop might I point out had there been tougher standards on terrorism and immigration, that shooter would not have been among us
@jkirchick my record clear I advocate what I Believe right&amp; true. If in this 4 $, I would‚Äôve left long ago. Sad so many personal attacks
@PrideandPop then U have a lot to https://t.co/yxsKIUQihd based on controlling honest people, in this case disarming them, make things worse
@CassKris that would have to be discussed and defined in a very responsible way by those writing the law
@TawniVixen oh yes, I loved Taliban so much that I was a major player in organizing the Northern alliance which defeated &amp; drove them out
@TawniVixen your source of information gets most of its revenue from sex ads &amp; does not feel compelled to be accurate, as in this case
@aussieontheroad that definition would take a lot of thought and discussion by those shaping the law
@carube7 can I count on U to vote against  politicians letting millions, including terrorists &amp; criminals, swarm into our country.
@prugtiv made a statement two days ago. Did not know him. He spoke his mind about Afghan in my office for 20 minutes. We had no relationship
@prugtiv as a senior member of foreign affairs cmtee I meet with variety of people. For 20 minutes he pontificated about Afghanistan &amp; left
@PrideandPop most people who read these tweets are interested in my position as an elected official.  I address the issues they raise
@CassKris that would be determined by experts testifying before lawmakers
@PrideandPop U R fixated on solving problems by increasing gov controls over honest people even as gangs, terrorists&amp; criminals roam free
@TawniVixen photo of me in Afghanistan with mujahideen fighting Soviet army. After 9-11 my muj friends became Northern Alliance beat Taliban
@LaureniumFalcon NO lack of rules or laws here,nor gov employees to enforce them. Fed gov focused on controlling us not criminals is problem
@PrideandPop rich liberals who live or work with armed guard at gate or door would disarm honest citizens making us,not them, vulnerable
@PrideandPop if criminals have all the guns you will have a lot more to fear
@PrideandPop U would be more afraid if gov disarmed honest people so criminals would have no fear of breaking into anybody‚Äôs house
@CassKris not sure what the legal definition would include but certainly those who using psycho related drugs
@eossipov nope. I have positive role in public debate &amp; the enacting of federal policy in Congress. I can do this &amp; still have my family. üòÄ
@PrideandPop do U live in gated community or work at a company with a gate? Ur focus on controlling innocent people will make US less safe
@HelloMeganO to get gun controls passed they must be aimed at controlling criminals, terrorists &amp; psychos not honest citizens
@LaureniumFalcon We in Congress do not give orders, the president does. We have given Obama all authority he needs, but he has not used it
@MrSaltyOC  I disagree because there are so many criminals &amp; kooks with guns &amp; so many terrorists why focus on what honest citizens R doing
@derderdebonair I have had a long career so the relatively small amonunt  has had little impact on my elections &amp; no impact on my ideas
@SamnRickisMom I‚Äôve been re-elected 14 times &amp; have had same position on rights of honest citizens to own guns. Yes,my cocstituents matter
@PoliticNutt sorry, he was just one of thousands with whom I briefly met &amp; heard what they had to say. It goes with the job.
@spo1981 after terrorist attack Ur focus on gun control inconsistent with my rage against Radical Islamic terrorism, unrecognized by Obama
@AnthonyFolsomSr part of the job is briefly meeting with people and hearing what they have to say, even when you disagree.
@octriallawyer yes I have briefly met with thousands of people &amp; heard what they had to say, which often I disagree with.
@octriallawyer What lying SOB said I supported the killers father? Or did U just make that up yourself?
@spo1981 list on Internet all convicted felons &amp; individuals on psych meds ineligible to buy, then illegal to sell a gun without E-verify
@GammaRae206 this was terrorist attack on free Americans. In San Berdue it was social workers. In Boston it was Marathon runners
@cartoon_villain lots to do to keep guns from felons, potential terrorists, or psychos. U seem to focus controls on honest citizens
@cartoon_villain I oppose if aimed at honest citizen with no criminal record or indication of mental illness or terrorist inclination
@TommyLeeAllman sorry I don‚Äôt engage in conversations that include that kind of language
@GammaRae206 I thought We were engaged in rational discussion. Ur declining language level &amp; suggestion I‚Äôd applaud Christian killers not OK
@brontyman all Americans have protection under law but Prez inability to focus on Rad Islamic Terrorists puts us all in danger
@brontyman no but I expect leftists will try to decoy attention from Prez refusal to say Rad Islamic Terrorist by making such absurd claims
@spo1981 I thought my responses delt directly with points you made.
@cartoon_villain nothing will convince U that gun controls that make burdensome to own a gun &amp; mostly illegal to carry= dead honest citizens
@brontyman this was not a hate crime against gays. Even if our Prez can‚Äôt utter the words, this was a RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST attack.
@tbeer46 the father is activist Afghan living in U.S.. He button holed Congressmen. No one was impressed enough to see him a second time
@brontyman politicians who vote to protect specific groups rather than severely punish all murderers also oppose honest citizens owning guns
@cartoon_villain sorry but I do my own tweeting &amp; don‚Äôt use talking points. How about refuting arguments rather than personal attacks?
@DriveLikeGW guess U can‚Äôt advocate without obscenity &amp; grossest kind of personal Attacks. Sorry but can‚Äôt continue discussion such person
@DriveLikeGW now that U have exposed the real U, unable to defend Ur beliefs without using obsinity
@cartoon_villain whoa, anyone who prevents honest citizen from owning or possessing a gun, who later is  murdered, has contributed to murder
@DriveLikeGW my how intellectual of U. Guess U R so superior U can call those with whom U disagree assholes &amp; still think highly of Urself.
@spo1981 how marvelous our Prez used word ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù Did he happen to use word‚Äù Islamic ‚Äúbefore he feeling compelled to say terrorist?
@cartoon_villain Keep Ignoring his abuse of power &amp; the victims of terrorism &amp; criminals who end up dead when unable to protect themselves
@DriveLikeGW so Ur out of touch with Ur friends &amp; neighbors who vote for candidates who will focus on controlling criminals &amp; terrorists
@bhurst no it‚Äôs Ur fault and all those making it difficult for honest people to own &amp; carry a gun
@spo1981 ask me that when we have a Prez capable of using words ‚ÄúRad Islamic Terrorist‚Äù &amp; unwilling to target political opponents 4 audits
@cartoon_villain how many of the victims had concealed weapons permits? If you disarm honest people monsters like in Orlando run amuck
@cartoon_villain if it aimed at restricting  honest citizens You have targeted wrong people. How about focusing on terrorists, murderers ..
@cartoon_villain making it harder for honest people to get guns, rather than focusing on criminals &amp; terrorists=more innocent victims
@nutritiousbig generally opponents of targeted laws like Urs, support execution 4 all murderers&amp; Islamic terrorists.those on Ur side don‚Äôt.
@DriveLikeGW the blood is  on hands of those making it harder 4 honest people 2 defend themselves
@brontyman if common sense does not include disarming honest citizens by making it impossible for them to get a weapon, I am open to ideas
@FiliusLiberatus wonderful U think if voters reject what U want it is mob rule. Grow up this isn‚Äôt getting what U want or gutting the system
@FiliusLiberatus my seat less important than integrity of our democratic process. Politicos on both sides think they R superior 2 Am people
@FiliusLiberatus USA has competing elites, so don‚Äôt trash lost elections, undermining direct election opens door 2 elite manipulation
@FiliusLiberatus trash canning votes of those who won GOP primaries is siding with Boehner &amp; the establishment elite &amp; electing Hillary
@FiliusLiberatus Those unAmerican elitist suggesting negating results of free,fair&amp; honest primary elections &amp;caucuses will destroy the GOP
@FiliusLiberatus no Washington would not be siding with an elite contemptuous of our electoral system &amp; dismissive of the will of the people
@FiliusLiberatus this issue decided by voters not a self serving elite. I supported Cruz. Now Integrity dictates loyalty to voters choice
@FiliusLiberatus if convention rules over ride GOP voters &amp; other than winner of primaries nominated, GOP will soon be discarded by voters
@FiliusLiberatus those delegates elected to support Trump should do so. Candidate who gets majority of delegates is our nominee
@FiliusLiberatus Trump played by the rules and won. The honorable course now for those who backed a losing candidate is to support Trump
@FiliusLiberatus nomination should go 2 candidate who wins vote of majority of GOP delegates. Delegates should vote as they declared 2voters
@Rep_JaniceHahn thanks 4  making that number part of discussion.  What fund should it be taken from?
@curtisky Have decided to face reality. Election results are so different than your prediction, maybe U should be a bit more humble
@shesova it appears if sunk ppay did not stop 4 vast majority of MM who were semi gov employees, nor if wounded denied hospitalization
@shesova was pay of 50,000 union guys same as 200,000 semi gov employees? Did pay of semi gov stop if hit water?If wounded no hospital care?
@shesova OK Janice what amount of cash payment is mandated by this legislation?disconcerting 	the promoters keep ignoring this key issue.
@TheNathanHoward gov should not control private behavior of adults, especially if an adult in pain &amp; gov prevents using an herb 4 relief
@shesova I am taking seriously Ur arguments. But quit ignoring cost issue: how much is the cash payment being sought?
@shesova By 1944 vast majority of MM considered quasi gov employees. Do U claim their pay stopped if they were sunk? Please show that.
@shesova will look into it but it appears As War went on MM better treated &amp; more benefits,which went with MM becoming quasi fed employees.
@shesova this no back up 4 what U R saying. Early in war MM on private vessels benefits provided by Union or ship owner. That status changed
@shesova these documents do not back your point.
@shesova thought U said there were no med benefits
@shesova Wanda just confirmed that when MM were private they had the pay and benefits.
@shesova was there no Union in those days? With no health insurance? Pay same as military?I will look into Ur points.
@shesova so if they didn‚Äôt ship out they‚Äôd get their draft notices...like everybody else in WWII. They were different than the draftees.
@shesova Cut the game,U R asking for more than recognition, which has already been done, U R asking for a cash payment.
@ShoelessJoe__ patriots like Tara shouldn‚Äôt jab Trump. Choice: unpredictable Trump or a leftist who without doubt will irrepairably hurt USA
@KingofWanda1 my impression WWII MM opted 4 more pay than military, but few gov benefits, which Union or employee contracts provided.
@KingofWanda1 so WWIIMM had no healthcare benefits from the union or the company &amp; no more pay if hit the water. Will look into that.
@shesova R cash payments in this bill only going to those who hit the water &amp; were then cut off the payroll with no benefits or 2 all WWIIMM
@shesova I will look into charge  MM had no healthcare.I assumed as private employees &amp; possibly union labor they had health benefits
@shesova over the years I have supported several Cong. Resolutions, enacted by Congress honoring them&amp; recognizing the heroism of WWIIMM.
@shesova refusal to pull cash payment out of legislation honoring WWIIMM shows  intent is obtaining $. U need to say how much &amp; justify it
@shesova  U keep repeating the heroic deeds. No one disputes that. My dad was WWII Marine. Marines were paid a pittance. They R all heroes
@shesova WWIIMM heroes everyone. I have co sponsored &amp; voted for legislation honoring them. Ur goal is not honoring,but in cash 4 relatives.
@AMMWWII U keep claiming the issue is honoring these elderly heroes. It is not. It  is about $ that will end in hands of relatives.
@shesova Y keep claiming goal is honoring elderly war heroes? No one opposes that. Clearly a desire 4 $ is driving force, not louder praise
@shesova so now U want US 2 borrow $ to give.to elderly heroes which upon passing away ends up in pockets of children &amp; grandchildren.
@shesova no elected official opposes honoring these heroic Americans. Only obstacle is cash payment. Posturing won‚Äôt change that.
@ahmedbaloch03 Baloch struggle for freedom &amp; independence. PAK ISI =Fanatic Islamists who use terrorism to suppress own people project power
@shesova Over the years I have supported a number of bills honoring WWIIMM, even making them eligible for veterans benefits, but no cash
@shesova MM were heroes who did their important &amp; dangerous job well. But unlike our military they were paid well&amp; often had Union benefits
@shesova when drafted into army or navy he earned almost nothing. MM were paid well &amp; had med benefits from their private shipping companies
@shesova Filipinos fought as part of US Military operation. Like soldiers &amp; sailors were paid very little. MM paid at professional level.
@shesova then not about families getting $ 4 what elderly heroes did yrs ago, simply present bill that honors them without $ provision
@shesova so it‚Äôs all about $, which in reality will end up in pockets of children or grand children.Honoring  these heroes doesn‚Äôt require $
@gabrielroberts I will take a look at it,including the fine print. If makes easier 4 honest citizens to protect themselves then I am for it.
@shesova so it is all about the money isn‚Äôt
@shesova if bill honors these elderly Heroes &amp; does not include cash, ikely be spent  families not heroes, I will gladly support it
@Ontheotherhand I know &amp; like Bernie, personally.  As dedicated socialist he believes  gov should mandate what is produced, by whom&amp; 4 what
@Thurt451 it is difficult not to laugh when a tweeter with no followers claims my views irrelevant.
@Ontheotherhand because Bernie wants to tax and regulate everything and everybody.
@shesova I have honored the MMWII many times. This legislation however includes a major cash payment which I cannot support.
@Thurt451 what makes U think God has given any one the right to determine what adults can uses to alleviate their pain or suffering?
@Ontheotherhand I know &amp; like Bernie personally, but R few items other than cannabis Bernie would permit us to freely produce, buy or sell
@demandmyth every system has its strengths &amp; weaknesses
@Andrey1978Aks I don‚Äôt judge people that way. I voted for him don‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell.
@spo1981 politically active since 15 yrs old. Soon 69. have found our system adversarial &amp; sometimes compromising, but rarely cooperative.
@Andrey1978Aks more to worry about than sexual preference
@spo1981 I supported Cruz, so believe much criticism of Trump is legitimate, however, even after reading article, Trump better than Hillary
@CaroleWadeNpBch so U want alcohol illegal, bad impact on people‚Äôs lives and drunk drivers kill innocent people OR is that just rhetoric
@HaseebAK14 Russia‚Äôs been playing positive role against Rad Islamic Terrorism. Sad American hostility undermines fight against terrorists
@CaroleWadeNpBch respectfully too, A solid majority of constituents favors legalizing Adult use &amp; vast majority favors legalizing medical MJ
@VictorConkle ur willingness to use an inaccurate personal attack as to achieve political end does not speak well of your values.
@VictorConkle Ur knowledge base deficient.  4 last ten years I advocated what passed into law 2 yrs ago. treating my arthritis last 2 weeks
@VictorConkle t is now fed law. I wrote it. Still no excuse 4 inaccurate personal attack to achieve political goal. Drags down US discourse
@CaroleWadeNpBch 2 save us from drunk drivers outlaw alcohol? Gov controlling private life of adults 2 protect them from themselves=tyranny
@VictorConkle Ur description of my use cannabis infused candle wax on my arthritic shoulders was false. Tying it to political pitch rotten
@CaroleWadeNpBch As patriot U want best 4 USA, founded on political, economic &amp; personal freedom not gov control of our lives, USA=Liberty
@CaroleWadeNpBch now available so how many accidents traced to Pot as compared to alcohol? No excuse 4 controlling private adult behavior
@NayNayy256 even if I wasn‚Äôt suffering a lot of other people R. Glad To use my situation to open eyes of good hearted opponents of mmj
@carlusmartellus thanks for the good wishes.
@Weed4WorldPeace actually mmj just smothers the pain but does not get U high. If I want to relax I go for tequila or ginger beer&amp; vodka
@CaroleWadeNpBch why do U want to waste law enforcement $ &amp; time trying to control private lives of adults when criminals rob, rape&amp; murder?
@DogSurfRoadshow next week call Ken in DC at 202-225-2415. Work out details with him to Set up an Rendezvous here on OC
@cjsthegirl suffering arthritis, Last night after flying home from DC with sever pain so up late to apply cannabis to shoulders, it worked
@DogSurfRoadshow The basic difference: how much authority over our lives will be given to the federal gov &amp; global gov. &amp; R claims accurate
@Stevendiego there are doctors who can tell you. Seek them out
@cjsthegirl I guess U R 4 alcohol prohibition &amp; 4 police, courts &amp; jails to  control private behavior rather than target violent criminals
@firmgreen U share Ur insights to makes things better...me too
@frenchie1916 not ‚Äúin office‚Äù ‚Äúwhile holding public office‚Äù is a bit more accurate
@AmishTerrorism hope to end that kind of tyranny and injustice
@stevedeangelo great to hear from you. Thanks for good thoughts old friend
@DogSurfRoadshow We share love of surfing, but there is a price. At least med mj can ease surf related arthritis pain. Applied not smoked
@Mariamistan I appreciate a good review. Thanks usually only the ones who bother to comment are those who disagree
@moskovaliturk many Americans like myself grateful for Turkey‚Äôs solid friendship, but we R concerned Ur Prez becoming hostile &amp; oppressive
@JustinJimenez7 sever arthritis pain prevented sleep. Wax from Cannabis infused candle eased pain enough for good nights sleep. That is GOOD
@Ahmed01raAhmed the US involvement is only factor stopping Ur entire region from being a prison run by perverted blood thirsty fanatics
@nationallampoon the wording is wrong. It is supposed to be ‚Äúused medical marijuana on arthritic shoulders while holding public office
@NayNayy256 worst part of cannabis prohibition has the total restriction on research into plant to determine possible medical benefits
@HaseebAK14 U define a fair weather friend anyone refusing to give more $ to corrupt gov that murders own people &amp; supports terrorists
@CaroleWadeNpBch is travesty 4 gov 2 prevent using cannabis 2 end suffering of vets or even of those with arthritis like me.
@Scribbles646 we undermine do-able projects trying to fund projects whose time has not come
@spo1981 All people free in private lives, others need not accept. Is counter productive 4 bosses to snoop in private life of good employee
@JNBaloch PAK leaders have betrayed their own people. They support terrorism &amp; sell out to China minerals &amp; Ports owned by  PAK people
@Scribbles646 Pushing Mars mission to soon will defund numerous other worthwhile space programs &amp; make catastrophic failure more likely
@ArmIPunk tougher gun control on honest citizens has certainly had its impact on New York City
@81george I talk to everybody who can provide valuable insights or new info. Have him call my office in DC. The number is easy to find
@Andrey1978Aks system will not stop major attack nor is it an offensive threat. It should not be such an issue on either side
@81george have U looked at both sides or R U committed to hurting Russia no matter what issue? Newsweek, Wall St Journal have doubts as do I
@spo1981  Private lives whatever one chooses,but so many sexual IDs impossible 4 society 2 adjust rules 4 them, so they need to adjust 2 us
@spo1981 Legislation working its way brought system.
@SpacerockDodger I‚Äôm frustrated we spend $billions on impossible mission 2 Mars but can‚Äôt focus on threat 2 whole planet until it‚Äôs 2 late
@zeb01cah I am not a Bush Republican.
@zeb01cah that is corrects ,
@policyconcerns R numerous studies of drug legalized countries &amp; states. Some differ from basis of Ur question so Ur facts may not be facts
@policyconcerns my position on the issue is well known. Demanding a discussion of that issue be on Ur terms arrogant &amp; dishonest.
@hiralald Unlike Ru, China‚Äôs had NO political reform since Mao. Ino opposition parties, no free press, no unions, controlled religion
@XxPlixsterxX I did my best for Cruz. Trump has most support of GOP voters so I will support the GOP nominee
@policyconcerns demanding  yes or no is  arrogant,  if that‚Äôs Ur style:, yes or no is it possible other studies contradict yours?
@EffyDuhay cause I like Allen, although we disagree.
@policyconcerns only arrogant &amp; ignorant people believe they can set up a false dichotomy &amp; then demand a yes or no answer
@vilnisschulz excessive CO2? is bminuscule part of atmosphere &amp; vast majority not man made. False Prediction:dead polar bears &amp; temp jumps
@BallotBoxOwl yes
@spo1981 I can‚Äôt figure it out either!
@helpmedienowplz talk to someone who knows U &amp; loves U. Life gets tough at times for everyone, so real people sympathize with others
@policyconcerns R U one claiming prohibition would‚Äôve worked if labeled drinks not proceeded it? What limit to gov control over us adults?
@vilnisschulz U must enjoy name calling. As far as plastic bags around one‚Äôs head, does it really mean CO2 is threat to human health
@spo1981 If beaten In process of selecting GOP candidate 4 Prez, honorable option is supporting nominee, not. Going 3rd party
@boggled102 if U want war fine,but don‚Äôt claim options impossible to cover fact U don‚Äôt want a settlement. monitored elections R possible
@boggled102 as for kidnapping incident: Ru clearly wrong, but has happened once. The victim had border duty. Could be something more to it
@boggled102 B52s deliver nukes. formation head 4 Moscow &amp; went right to Ru border.quit ignoring this reckless hostility on our part.
@boggled102 disagree with your conclusion but appreciate your responsible style of advocacy
@boggled102 one of the many hostile US acts was sending a B52 formation from England directly to Ru border in Estonia. This is insanity
@boggled102 thanks for sending your analysis of the timeline of the Ukrainian upheaval . Will compare to others. &amp; thanks 4 no name-calling
@Tenax_Imperii Assad like Saddam Husiane not our enemy. If overthrown, shortly radical Islam terrorists will control Syria. Do U want that?
@boggled102 greatest threat to USA is Radical Islamic terrorism. Ru major ally, if we push solutions good 4 all  sides 2 current upheavals
@Non_Disclosure The people who live in Crimea should determine their destiny OSCE supervised referendum. Past status is less important
@violator1234 when are you going to learn that people will not take you seriously when you are  using that kind of rhetoric.
@boggled102 where R other UKr leaders who looted their country. UKr Oligarchs similar to Ru. Time to end UKr upheaval implement Minsk plan
@Tenax_Imperii how does it feel to be so ignorant that U have to call names rather than discuss or debate issues
@bangkokdave I am the poorest man in the USCongress. I have zero economic ties with Ru. Quit calling names it makes you look bad
@Tenax_Imperii U sure know how to call names. To bad that detracts from Ur credibility not mine.
@ECGuillet the snipers seemed to be shooting people on both sides of the confrontation.
@boggled102 this upheaval nothing to do with yet another UKr Prez stealing. everything to do with a power-play by EU elite&amp;Ukr oligarchs
@boggled102 so EU &amp; USA did not engaged in destabilizing Yanochovich gov? Baloney !  &amp; oligarch troops did not ratchet up street violence?
@boggled102 UKr leaders B4 Yanacovich were anti-Ru &amp; corrupt. Currently Anti-Ru UKr politicos R corrupt. Don‚Äôt blame Ru 4 all Ur problems
@violator1234 You demand?
@JakoVarrd I have found those who R impolite &amp; call names rather that focus on issues of disagreement R closed minded &amp; mean spirited
@dariomarchetti9 he would have been kicked out legally next election, instead was removed by force in collusion with EU elites &amp; Oligarchs
@dariomarchetti9 Yanocovich was corrupt, like those before him and like those who deposed him.
@PaulNiland does being arrogant &amp; dishonest help your family? Paul your level of argumentation is closer to the gangsters U claim to oppose
@PaulNiland still ignoring my question about Minsk requiring actions from both sides &amp; U still R arrogant enough to demand yes or no answers
@GrayB88 isn‚Äôt it despicable for someone to ignore issues and attack someone personally? Shame on you.
@policyconcerns your read of history is different than mine, but got to get one sleep now, good night
@friedtex I think many of The criticisms of Putin are justified, others are not. Yes, rad Islamic Terrorism is primary threat today not Ru
@JakoVarrd guess it‚Äôs too hard for some people  to have an extended polite conversation
@policyconcerns I will check the stats, but I would not support banning all alcohol to make it harder for children to buy booze
@PaulNiland which is why he would‚Äôve lost next election. Too bad that process not permitted to work. He would‚Äôve been gone with no turmoil
@policyconcerns outlawing cannabis created foreign drug cartels &amp; drug selling gangs here but has not made drugs any less available
@JakoVarrd A prominent anti-Putin Ru journalist says that is not true. Do U suggest it be ignored or looked into?
@bangkokdave every time U use a pejorative word attack rather than rational argument, it brings you down not me
@policyconcerns protecting children to justify controlling lives of adults even when children not directly involved is unAmerican tyranny
@SteveKomarnycky no U only expose that U R unable to defend what U advocate but rely on personal abuse of those who disagree
@trojoan1963 Drug War totally failed: drugs R available &amp; enormous $ wasted on protecting adults from themselves rather than from criminals
@PaulNiland how arrogant is it to think U can demand yes or no to any question U pose &amp; ignore Minsk requires actions by Kiev.
@PaulNiland no wonder the conflict goes on. Look in the mirror. Bringing peace should be primary. It isn‚Äôt for Putin and isn‚Äôt for U
@PaulNiland so that is all U think there is to the Minsk Agreement. No wonder the conflict goes on. U ignore one half &amp; blame other side
@trojoan1963 if U insist on controlling the lives of adults as if they R children is a violation of there freedom
@trephann I can‚Äôt say that but I wouldn‚Äôt argue against that case
@PaulNiland will look at what U sent. Get back to me tomorrow
@PaulNiland thank you for engaging me in discussion about how this UKr mess happened in the first place, then maybe we can find the way out
@PaulNiland he has influence. Him knowing of fair minded people trying end UKr conflict &amp; improve relations between Ru &amp; USA might help
@PaulNiland thanks 4 sending Niland article. My site sources don‚Äôt confirm Minsk agreement being implemented &amp; artillery destruction all Ru
@PaulNiland it is time all sides start implementing Minsk Agreement.
@dariomarchetti9 so R U suggesting EU not in collusion with those who forced Yanocovich from office. Current crisis started there.
@SteveKomarnycky so U believe there was no EU complicity in destabilizing UKr &amp; removing Yanochovich? It so blatant EU proposals were public
@JakoVarrd yes I am a Congressman. I also did more to defeat communism than any of those trying to push US &amp; Ru into a new Cold War
@friedtex so challenges 2 Ur claims always FBS propaganda &amp; validity of any anti-Putin claims should never be questioned. U R not 4 truth
@vsaluki strange that U don‚Äôt have any idea what U R talking about, but R arrogant enough to attack me for looking into an accusation
@winstoncdn so U refuse to even consider what a prominent Anti-Putin Ru journalist is claiming before initiating a major policy
@JakoVarrd my position is that when a prominent anti-Putin Ru journalist claims something is based on lies, it deserve a closer look,
@policyconcerns What works is Personal responsibility. Parents given false security that police will do the job of protecting their children
@policyconcerns
@friedtex serious questions about him being beaten to death. When anti-Putin journalist says not, then situation deserves honest look
@burningsun2004 yes, it started with violent removal of democratic elected President
@mhmck after how many weeks of free expression. Disruption of free speech never justified, as wrong as EU destabilizing elected gov of UKr
@mhmck corruption in Ukraine not Ru fault.
@mhmck Supported Orange revolution whose leaders once in power corrupt then defeated for election by corrupt Yanochovich who was overthrown
@mhmck I watched peaceful protest in Kiev for weeks. when Oligarch thugs arrived violence ratcheted up to bring down gov. With EU approval
@mhmck cut the ‚Äúyour master‚Äù crap. If U can‚Äôt honestly disagree then Don‚Äôt complain about someone else‚Äôs proclivity to be overbearing
@Zimbru you must do the best you can in the circumstances that exist.
@BabaHates U R willing 2 project anger, but R too lazy 2 even google up some of the massive amount of info about my issues &amp; record.
@trephann I will support the nominee of the Republican Party.
@trojoan1963 if U support gov controlling our lives rather than liberty as our founding fathers proclaimed it, U should not have voted 4 me
@CaroleWadeNpBch wasting law enforcement $ 2 arrest &amp; imprison those consuming marijuana drains ability 2 get real criminals who hurt others
@BabaHates if Ud get hate factor out of Ur calculation U might not end up attacking elected officials who champion what U claim to believe
@meggymish nothing Mysterious, we R looking into reports by anti-Putin Ru journalist Andrei Nekrasov that Magnitsky case based on lies.
@burningsun2004 So U don‚Äôt believe officials from Ru &amp; USA should talk? like U There R those in U.S. pushing a new Cold War, I disagree
@burningsun2004 We discussed implementing Minsk Agreement. U think that ‚Äúbullshit‚Äùor is that Ur reaction to suggestion it be implemented?
@Mr_Bundesliga so U ignore Report of courageous anti-Putin Ru journalists Andrei Nekrasov that Magnitsky story is lie
@Zimbru If Our gov so weak, corrupt &amp; despised. that foreign troops R present an OSCE supervised election might be an acceptable option
@friedtex Don‚Äôt ignore courageous Ru journalist who exposes Putin‚Äôs sins, Andrei Nekrasov. He reports Magnitsky case is a lie. Open Ur mind
@meggymish truth is what stalls passage of Magnitsky Act. When anti Putin journalist Nekrasov says not true it should be looked at carefully
@friedtex worked closely with Prez Reagan campaigns &amp; White House. After fall of communism he wanted to embrace Ru&amp;condemned hostility
@korneev14 do U hold US allies and U.S. Leaders &amp; business to same standard as  Putin &amp; Russia?
@Zimbru If Ur mind was open U would have seen this answer before: if majority of Texas citizens vote to leave US its Adios Texas
@iptuttle passing Magnitsky Act even if prominent anti-Putin video journalist claims it lies about Magnitsky case =ignoring truth 2 hurt RU
@mel_huang note outspoken Putin Critic docu film maker claims west duped about Magnitsky case. Seeking truth labeled pro-Putin.
@spo1981 I will endorse the nominee of the Republican Party

@AllGreen_ITAD thank U 4 kind remarks &amp; 4 professional way U help meet daunting challenge of tech waste&amp; making profit doing it
@trevorfdane Ru military stunts in Baltic widely known unlike simulated nuclear attack on Ru with B-52s from England turning at Ru border
@BabaHates maybe Am voters should not have elected Obama or Brown to be chief exec &amp; command our police &amp; military.Don‚Äôt blame Cong.
@trevorfdane When Ru wrong I call it. When public fed lies to reignite Cold War I call it. We share same Islamic enemies we should cooperate
@trevorfdane kept hearing‚ÄùRu military aggression in Baltics.‚ÄùI went there &amp; met top leaders, been no Ru military intrusion nor fear of it
@AnthonyFolsomSr you know more about him than I do
@AnthonyFolsomSr U mean Don or Fred? GOP sexists yet Dems gave us 2 worst Prez philanderers &amp; now nominates wife who covered up rape
@AnthonyFolsomSr Ur fixation on sexism may indicate more about U than the GOP. Politics is equally abusive to everyone who runs 4 office
@BabaHates language level indicates intelligence. Vulgarity undermines Ur point. Congressmen work in DC not OC. Rioters will be arrested.
@AnthonyFolsomSr all political leaders abused during election.Only a sexist mind would claim it sexist when it happens to a woman candidate
@trevorfdane EU &amp; US conspired with UKr oligarchs to forcibly remove Elected Prez Yanocovich instead of waiting 4 next election
@MariviGarces No! I did not fire Tara. She did a great job 4 me &amp; 4 the patriot cause. She moved on after 7 yrs for more pay &amp; more glory
@trevorfdane the voters of my district seem to disagree with you in a big way
@Zimbru if like Scotland the people of Texas vote to become part of Mexico &amp; safeguards taken to ensure a free election, then adios Texas
@vsaluki what do u care about elections. u support overthrow of elected Ukr gov &amp; U demand I resign from elected office because we disagree
@vsaluki by groping U mean like destabilizing then overthrowing elected governments if they even consider economic treaty with someone else
@vsaluki U claim I favor Putin. If Ur other claims R just as inaccurate I fear them used to justify overthrowing elected gov, perhaps war
@LateefJohar thanks for being up front with your beliefs. Nevertheless, I am Enemy of those who use religion to justify murder of innocents
@vsaluki U support violent overthrow of elected Uk Prez and now you demand this elected official resign because U disagree.
@Zimbru The people of Crimea should have internationally supervised referendum to decide if they will be part of Ukraine or Russia
@vsaluki U keep claiming to know other people‚Äôs thoughts &amp; motives. This will not justify Ur hatred 4 Russia &amp;!desire for war
@vsaluki If U supported overthrow of democratically elected Prez Then U R enemy of democracy. Ur hatred 4 Russia &amp; desire 4 war is evident
@vsaluki really, why no convictions on snipers? no fan of Yanochovich, but predecessor‚Äôs corruption elected hm &amp; corruption still prevails
@vsaluki Yanocovich won OSCE verified election. Had his domestic &amp; EU detractors waited for next election he would have lost &amp; no upheaval
@Zimbru encouraging both sides implement Minsk Agreement. EU complicity in overthrowing democratic elected Prez Yanochovich caused crisis
@GailEvoy No need 4 naturalization process,authorities recognized Ted mothers US citizenship, automatically made Ted citizen at birth
@GailEvoy wherever born, anyone with one parent a U.S. Citizen is a citizen. Often legal immigrants who become citizens R the most patriotic
@LibertySeeds U sound like a high school kid. How anybody supporting Trump can attack Cruz for having to big an ego is remarkable
@spo1981 now not time to change rules. If no winner first round conventions keeps having votes till one candidate manages to get a majority
RT @NobbeChristine: @VoteForSpace @LacyClayMO1 @DanaRohrabacher Would love to but I'm a teacher and hard to get away. When is the meeting?
@KingofWanda1 if this legislation provides cars payments. I am opposed. We borrow too much already
@tyrthwr thanks for the tip.I will look into it. Dana
@AVechera those engaged in personal attacks rather than discussing beliefs expose their own arrogance &amp; ignorance&amp; despicable values
@isthewallbuilt the Am people would also look at his accomplishments.
@surferchecker thanks for taking time to express a positive note, I usually  only hear from those who adamantly disagree
@DublishVibhor PAK gov murders Baloch &amp; others at home while supporting terrorists &amp; fanatics in Afghan, nearby countries&amp; around world.
CA Cruz Crew Tomorrow Night! - https://t.co/uTxUUeScwT
@boggled102 Uk plagued with corruption Yanocovich corrupt. Should have been voted out not forced out by street violence &amp; EU power play
@AVechera shame on U scumbag. Extensive Video taken the day we vacated the property verifies the article U circulate is a bogus hit piece
@yurko40a I am a friend of truth &amp; peace as opposed to those so stuck with past hatred they can‚Äôt see they can‚Äôt see the truth
@AVechera shame on U for being a slime ball personally attacking people U disagree with, all my campaign expenses are reported and approved
@vsaluki Putin not Obama has been actively supporting SiSi.
@yurko40a none of this would have happened had Democratic gov not been overthrown
@boggled102 when Ru withdrew its military was it  let into NATO? Was it let into Common Market? US didn‚Äôt even cancel Jackson/Vanik.
@SarniamakChris I don‚Äôt enjoy lies and I am willing to get people mad at me to expose them. Time to end hatred of Ru for Cold War crimes
@AHBonenberger I am pro freedom, pro truth and Pro USA
@AVechera like overthrowing elected gov of Ukraine. Had EU elites waited for next election to remove Yanocovich current turmoil averted
@yurko40a now we know just to spite Putin U would support policies that would have resulted in Rad Islamic Terrorists control of Syria
@yurko40a if elected gov of Yanocovich been removed by voters in up coming election none of the mayhem in Ukraine would have happened
@boggled102 many attacking Putin were bashing Ru before Putin emerged. They treated Ru as a pariah, isolated &amp; exploited it economically,
@vsaluki Putin,while bad in some activity, is taking bold actions to defeat Rad Islamic Terrorists in Egypt, Syria other Mideast countries
@LibertySeeds that is the type of rational, in depth understanding that Trump is relying on to get elected &amp; run our country
@jethrotoll sorry, Ur knowledge &amp; lack of language skills makes it impossible to understand what you are trying to say
@JanBalochistani aid to PAK hurts PAK people and empowers Islamic extremists
@KennyLowell pledged to truth, USA, Cruz
@Tedderman1 was a war on drugs long before Nixon. Maybe Nixon meant Black Americans needed help to rid their neighborhoods of drug dealers
@Bonfiredesigns hard to understand Ur point.  Trump all over map almost every issue but Ure saying this one vote is defines Cruz
@emmanuel_maris brain dead people call those they disagree with names like ‚Äúbrain dead‚Äù cause they don‚Äôt know enough to challenge issues
@SarniamakChris Without RU military action Syria would now be controlled by Rad Islamic terrorist putting US at risk thanks to RUphobia
@SarniamakChris I support truth &amp; USA, Cold War over &amp; irrational anti-Russian hostility blocks efforts to defeat Islamic terrorists
@SarniamakChris many US politicos believe no religious freedom in Russia, ignorance blocks cooperation with RU to defeat Islamic terrorists
Ted Cruz in OC Next Week! - https://t.co/rDdRXgzy3v
@AHBonenberger which is the specific statement or position U disagree with?
@AVechera So U believe Russia is still communist state?So what have U done that anyway thwarted Communism?
@AHBonenberger I am not anti-Ukraine nor anti-RU . I am pro truth. Those who disagree but can‚Äôt refute what I say just claim I‚Äôm bias
@Tedderman1 guess all those other non black folks who get arrested for drugs don‚Äôt really exist
ITed Cruz in Orange County Calif, home of  Reagan revolution, Cruz this generations Reagan, a leader mobilizing patriots to save America
@flatcatcanyon So U think this due to them an made  CO2 not just one of the many ups and Downs evident in geological history.
@spo1981 I support Cruz. No need to go into hypotheticals now.
@spo1981 if Trump is to support winner of a majority of votes at GOP convention, I too must support any candidate who wins such a majority
@SHADOW_TWEETS that is what you THINK will happen based on your experience. My experience   Tells me the opposite
@RAWTheTerror01 Mumbai a murderous attack U claim the Indian cov killed their own people?  PAK gov may do that which is why Bangladesh split
@ShutGuantanamo released Gitmo terrorists went on to kill more innocents,including Americans. How many more must die B F U change Ur mind
@mgc_rrt thanks for taking time to express appreciation, usually I just hear from who disagree &amp; they can get mean
@CodeRedShell they declare themselves Muslims U say they aren‚Äôt. I struggle to imprison terrorist murderers U say I don‚Äôt care about victims
@ShutGuantanamo U R so committed to wrong side when we  try to determine how to defeat fanatic Muslim terrorists U try to distract attention
@ShutGuantanamo U have no sympathy innocent people murdered by released Gitmo terrorists. U blame us not Rad Islam 4 motivating their crimes
@dirtrhino So U really blame those trying to stop terrorists for murderous attacks on innocent people in Paris, Brussels, Africa. Nonsense
@P8ntgal so terrorists must be treated as criminals &amp; restrictions placed on law enforcement in U.S. must apply in thwarting this threat
@akbussey oh, I‚Äôd have been happier if it was my hair U were panning
@ShutGuantanamo shame on U. Excusing the murder of innocents by blaming others than the terrorists themselves
@jethomme total baloney. Shame on U for excusing the slaughter of innocent people in Paris, Brussels and yes, New York.
@P8ntgal finish Ur sentence ‚Äú and terrorists need to be freed
@TrumanDem ur great concern for the rights of terrorist is out of balance with Ur minimal concern for victims
@dirtrhino Ur willingness to see 100 babies killed to prevent a denial of rights to 	even one terrorist should win U the Obama peace prize
@colinjcole yep U prefer 20 innocents murdered by terrorists than to have one terrorist mistreated.
@colinjcole Foriegn terrorists do have same rights as U.S. Citizens. Do U care more of rights of murderous terrorists than innocent victims
@akbussey sorry my looks are just important and my beliefs and principles.
@_ElizabethRB U support release of Gitmo terrorists even if it means more innocent people murdered by those released. Shame
@JDanaStuster witnesses testified terrorists released from Gitmo have murdered innocent people. Yes it is a sign of weakness to release them
@Doing_it_today I wish I could do more.
@borngeek Y do fed research $ still flow into nonsense AGW projects, a recent travesty: a study on how G Warming will impact our sex lives
@TEEBOXADONIS Is Moscow mule a Russian drink? I toasted with Yakoff Smirnoff, who helped me provide Prez Reagan with pithy anti-Soviet jokes
@RAWTheTerror01 Ur assumption that I don‚Äôtlike Muslims is wrong. I don‚Äôt like terrorist or those refraining from condemning terrorists

@TenneyNaumer such fanatic fantasy. Doesn‚Äôt excuse destroying Ca Ag putting tens of thousands out of work. Same mindset as GWarming fanatics
@TenneyNaumer enviro fantasies no excuse 4 fanatics destroying tens of thousands of Ca ag jobs,by massive clean water dumping to save a fish
@TenneyNaumer Cal farms victims of fanatic enviros in Dem party who keep dumping billions of gallons of fresh water in Ocean to save a fish
@TenneyNaumer so those little wooden ships just plowed right through those frozen waters. Have U heard of what proceeded the mini ice age?
@TenneyNaumer oh so floods in Louisiana &amp; droughts in California R traced to man produced CO2. Baloney
@TenneyNaumer what does ‚Äúever recorded‚Äù mean?  Greenland was Green &amp; Iceland a colony in Viking times&amp; in 1940 Arctic waters navigitable
@TenneyNaumer  ‚Äú97o/o scientists‚Äùclaim bogus, as is claim tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fiercer&amp; more frequent. What is Ur claim now?
@yung401k I would vote against such a proposal. not gov job to control our lives. Already been enormous $ invested in electric transport
@CongressPulse actually, Karen was letting me know there was a young man from my district who wanted to meet me in the side room
@jim_hunt oceans just started trapping more heat? NOAA stonewalling Cong. Info requests about how that was determined.
@clickchoiceauto Will look at bill
@yung401k if U ask I will try to answer
@jim_hunt So MMann, &amp; all those deniers R wrong about almost Two decades of nearly no global temp jump, despite major CO2  increase
@icarus62 U live in dream world because contrary points of view blocked out &amp; any one in want of gov grant must the toe AGW line
@icarus62 what if there are scientists who disagree?
@MichaelEMann will do.
@mike_cal glad to hear that U R someone who really knows what is in the public interest, Bet U R proud about that
@spo1981 we agree on much of what you are saying
@MichaelEMann will get a copy and alert U. If it is not accurate I will quit saying it.
@toxicpath I admit I am cautious about the medicines my doctor recommends, especially for my children. My wife reconfirms what we R told
@MichaelEMann absolutely right. And even those of us who argue the toughest for what we believe need to admit we could be wrong.(me too)
@LibertySeeds let‚Äôs get this straight. U back Trump &amp; R trying to portray Cruz as unreliable. U‚Äôve  got to be kidding. R U on Trump payroll?
@spo1981  just as concerned about GWarming Crowd calling opponents deniers or corp whores...also liberals labeling opponents racists/bigots
@rgnldprrn so someone has again altered the data put into the computers to provide a brand new method of defending AGW theory.
@flatcatcanyon MMann, along with 18 other prominent AGW advocates, now acknowledge 18 yrs of steady temp. R U a denier?
@not_that_actor When Paglia used Cruz physical features to justify her rejection, thinking people should realize her opinions are worthless
@spo1981 Trump is not an issue for GOP, he is a person...although how he handles himself is a huge issue for his own candidacy.
@spo1981 YES
@LibertySeeds attacking the candidate personally instead of his policies is bad enough. attacking his wife is about as rotten as it gets
@RAWTheTerror01 thanks and good luck to you as well
@RAWTheTerror01 there is no Indian threat to invade, only PAK paranoia which leads it to send  terrorists into India to murder hotel guests
@RAWTheTerror01 if that an reflects Indian threat 2 PAK, U undermine Ur case by showing it. Honest viewer sees no threat only PAK paranoia.
@istvanasz sure like Jonas Sauk and a large number of other I who didn‚Äôt go along with the herd
@istvanasz so claiming those who disagree R paid off is not disparaging. Guess that reflect Ur frame of mind. You should open up.
@istvanasz of course climate change is happening. The question: is a result of man madeCO2 or is it changing like it always has
@istvanasz were U taut to attack someone‚Äôs integrity rather then confront their ideas? It is typical of Gwarming advocates
@RAWTheTerror01 thank you for that expression of kindness and rationality
@istvanasz arrogant fanatics usually don‚Äôt understand that large numbers of intelligent people, including voters, disagree with them
@RAWTheTerror01 As most Americans, I Believe in freedom of religion. Clearly not  true in many countries, which are dominated by fanatics
@RAWTheTerror01 She seems like a wonderful person, but if she claimed to be motivated by Jesus PAK Muslim fanatics would murder her

@tonydunc Cong oversight cmtee info requests stonewalled by EPA, NOAA, DOE. NOAA request specifically about integrity of temp research
@LoriPatriot baloney, Trump uses weasel words concerning his supposed opposition to amnesty from beginning, why I endorsed Cruz.
@LoriPatriot none of those you mentioned would stand for the scurrilous personal attacks you and your candidate are utilizing
@LoriPatriot hope attention given to this example of Trump values. Policy debate becomes personal attacks, even on spouse of opponent. Shame
@LoriPatriot R U kidding, last debate Trump reversed hard amnesty stance, calling it negotiable &amp; illegals  can come back once deported
@LoriPatriot oh so I‚Äôm a traitor. Thanks for demonstrating the influence Trump has on people. U might want to list Ur service to our country
@LoriPatriot Ur attack on Cruz wife disgusting, scurrilous rhetoric.Husbands not responsible wife‚Äôs decisions...same true for Trumps 3 wives
@LoriPatriot U don‚Äôt speak for military. We‚Äôre you in military? Was Trump? So don‚Äôt push on us another bogus claim,
@LoriPatriot like Ur guy you can‚Äôt make a positive point, without a denigrating personal attack.
@LoriPatriot R U still Trashing Cruz wife. Shame on you
@LoriPatriot after attacking Cruz wife your opinions are irrelevant. Typical of the mean spirited candidate U claim to support
@LoriPatriot R libs paying U? This disgusting attack on Cruz wife, who rightfully has her own life &amp; opinions, is mean&amp;meaningless. shame!
@GooseNetworkUSA yep,Ure defending gangsters alright. Keep it up, U expose the anti-democratic power play in Turkey by trying to defend it
@tonydunc the mounting evidence includesEPA, DOE &amp; NOAA failure to provide requested info about growing list of phony claims
@tonydunc how much hotter did it get or did AGW ideologues in bureaucracy change method of determining temp? &amp; not providing all info
@tonydunc how about agencies promoting AGW changing method of determine temp &amp; then covering up by refuse to disclose research documents?
@Lary9 Unruh walked Reagan to plane when he left for DC. Wished him well &amp; gave good advice...a classy guy
@DMStringerAssoc no dig at Mrs Carter or Mrs Ford intended or expressed. Like WH, economy &amp; foreign affairs in disarray as well.
@Iservedrinks 1981 when we got to WH it was a mess, there wasn‚Äôt even a complete set of dishes for formal dinners. Nancy corrected that
@wrmspr only ones denying science R scientists so dependent on gov grants they ignore mounting evidence the CO2 AGW theory is wrong
@faithkeepersmov Christians needs to meet with their Representative in Congress to request they co-sponsor  HR 4017 stop Cristian genocide
@JEFFHAWKE you just haven‚Äôt been paying attention
@CaroleWadeNpBch with limited $ available to protect us, spending it on preventing adults from smoking a weed is totally wrong priority
@ushadrons U R right. Bad call.
@sleeplessmedia Ur vulgarity reflects a lack of enough intelligence to communicate a rational point of view. Furthermore, U R dead wrong
@RAWTheTerror01 someone arguing his case or criticizing my views is not an insult. One can totally disagree&amp; still be an honorable person.
@RAWTheTerror01 if that brave PAK soldier killed by terrorists, why did PAK gov hide &amp; give safe haven to OBL, mass murderer of 9-11
@RJSadiaSattar got to go now. I hope someday PAK gov will again be a friend of the U.S. &amp; democratic people‚Äôs of the world,
@RJSadiaSattar yes, military makes mistakes, the PAK gov murder of its own people&amp; support for drug dealers &amp; terrorists is intentional
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 Many Muj later helped defeat the evil Taliban, which was created &amp; supported by Saudi &amp; PAK gov
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 US not perfect, but ISI infamous for its terrorism, drug dealing, murder of fellow PAKs
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 I don‚Äôt care what it is called, people in Kashmir &amp; Balochistan should be able to vote to determine their status
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 whoever provided US support, PAK gov wins prize for ingratitude, betrayal, dishonesty, &amp; brutal repression of its own people
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 PAK ISI created&amp;armed Taliban, supported world‚Äôs worst terrorists&amp;drug dealers, &amp; gave safe haven to mass murderer bin Laden
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 I support referendum so people Kashmir &amp; Balochistan can exercise their right of self determination. Who goes first irrelevant
@G0_NAWAZ_G0 PAK ingratitude will end U.S. Generously giving  $billions to PAK gov which has stolen it before it reached its people.
@javaidShaikh I do not oppose allowing the people of any state to vote on whether they want to remain part of the United States.
@Pakilander don‚Äôt hate Chinese or Pakistanis people. Each have monstrously corrupt and repressive governments.
@Pakilander that‚Äôs right. With the help of paid off PAK officials, Chinese will own all PAK assets &amp; minerals and even ports
@javaidShaikh I don‚Äôt oppose honest referendums. Much of world‚Äôs turmoil, like in PAK, caused by corruption &amp; repression self determination
@sleeplessmedia where R Ur funny photos of Dems?
@Pakilander I am on record &amp; have firmly spoken out in support of referendums in Kashmir &amp; Balochistan.
@Pakilander I support referendums in Kashmir as well as Balochistan. U can‚Äôt ignore PAK gov corruption &amp; it‚Äôs bloody repression of Baloch
@Pakilander Chinese will help PAK gov murder &amp; steal from its own people. Shameful for years USA has provided PAK gov weapons &amp; $billions
@Pakilander China gov murders its own Muslims &amp; brutally repressed its own people &amp; is corrupt as hell. It fits as a partner of PAK gov
@javaidShaikh yes, some in U.S. know that is how U feel so we will quit propping up Ur corrupt &amp; repressive gov with weapons &amp; $
@javaidShaikh if corrupt/deceitful PAK gov betrays Chinese gov, which murders its own Muslims,	they will each get what they deserve
@sleeplessmedia OK  I get it, Ur opinions need not be taken seriously because you‚Äôre because you‚Äôre just spouting off.
@sleeplessmedia How many other major accomplishments does one have to show before U admit a lack of knowledge
@sleeplessmedia how about being point person in laying the legal foundation for the commercial space industry, &amp; that‚Äôs just one example
@TheMPHayze When considering Ur opinion I will remember U R the one claiming Cruz is the anti-Christ
@HellerExposed ‚Äúlongest on record‚Äù Oh so how long is the record? So coral retreats didn‚Äôt happen before internal combustion engine.
@TrumpBrady appropriate 2 fire staffer 4 putting out info before verifying. Insulting 2 divert attention from policy differences with trivia
@TheMPHayze we obviously disagree.Cruz has a long track record verifying his fundamental beliefs. Trumps track record is different
@TheMPHayze we obviously disagree. Cruise
@TrumpBrady the major effort of Trump‚Äôs team to  draw attention away from policy differences by attacking Cruz personally insults US voters
@spo1981 Obama will be treated by Congress with the same respect he has given to the legislative branch.
@mworobec  had EU elitist &amp; Uk opposition waited 4 next election &amp; not violently ousted elected Uk prez, this tragedy would‚Äôve been averted
@MehroozAhmed PAK gov supports Islamic terrorists who kill foreigners &amp; PAK citizens not fanatic enough Muslims.blasphemy laws reflect this
@mworobec if elected president overthrown in corporation with outside powers a revolt would be justified as would support for that revolt
@MehroozAhmed death penalty for murder is OK , blasphemy laws are not
@mworobec players in this tragedy agreed in Minsk what is needed to go in right direction. So far neither side has made the steps agreed to
@AliSalari1965 Ru is preventing Radical terrorists from coming to power in Syria when supposed moderates pushed aside if Assad removed
@AliSalari1965 Assad brutally suppressing uprising, as would every other gov in region. Jihadists will push aside moderates if Assad loses
@noortiwana1 a peaceful referendum, not the dictate of some American armed murderous PAK oppressor, should decide future of Baloch people.
@mworobec hatred of Ru is distorting view of Russia &amp; the potential for peace
@mworobec Soviet era mass murder=most Ukrainians hate Ru=violent overthrow of elected Uk Prez seeking Ru trade deal &amp; violent cycle since
@rebel_romantic war always civilian victims. WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq = many civilians killed. Better than letting Nazis or Jihadists win
@mworobec Putin believes he watches out 4 interests of his country,not running amok. Irrational hostility&amp; double standard hurts USA &amp; Ru
@Andrey1978Aks Your anger is no excuse for vulgar language
@Andrey1978Aks being committed to truth doesn‚Äôt make one pro or anti- Putin. Like every other national leader he has faults &amp; strengths
@LeonardCohen2 the question is of whatever such change: is it caused by human use of CO2.
@BalrogsLair only till one space rock hits &amp; destroys a city. Then astronomers will be our heroic first line of defense
@Siddiq_bugti PAK gov  corrupt &amp; brutally oppressive. The murder of Baloch &amp; support for terrorism despicable. Some day USA eyes will open
@not_that_actor Republican Party needs to be fair &amp; honest. Not doing so will destroy any chance of unity in November
@bd1949 I am dismayed by US F-16 sale even after all the evil the ISI has done and all the PAK supported terrorism and repression
@mworobec it is easier for those trying to start a war with Russia to claim those who oppose them R pro-Russian rather than peace advocates
@discjocke52 those who want a new cold war use personal attacks to discredit those promoting peace.
@n_bakhsh I may not get to White House protest U.S.weapons to PAK used to kill Baloch leaders &amp; people. Arming such bloody repression sinful
@LeonardCohen2 so U ignore the credentials &amp; arguments of those who disagree with the conclusions U have reached by not examining both sides
@LeonardCohen2 have you even googled ‚Äúglobal warming hoax‚Äùto see what the other side has to say?
@LeonardCohen2 don‚Äôt kid yourself. There R thousands of scientists,engineers &amp; climatologists who oppose theory man-made CO2 heats planet
@HellerExposed I obviously don‚Äôt believe the CO2 theory. It is a minuscule part of atmosphere with a minuscule impact on climate &amp; ocean
@Grant___White U name the  so-called mistakes and I bet they R just disagreements.
@not_that_actor if Cruz had movie star face &amp; deeper voice U would feel better. It is his pro freedom&amp;progress&amp; security agenda that counts
@HellerExposed same thing that made them disappear many times before, I tweet that as I look at the snow in the mountains above Southern Cal
@not_that_actor thanks for sending on the thought provoking analysis
@not_that_actor I worked with Prez Reagan for seven years in the White House. America desperately needs another such principled leader: CRUZ
@booster_early I am honored 2 be part of fight 2 ensure our vets R not denied any treatment their doctors believe can relieve suffering
@spo1981 anyone of our GOP candidates better for the freedom, prosperity &amp; security of America than those running in Obama‚Äôs Party
@HellerExposed Oh claiming me &amp; my party making this a worse world 4 somebody‚Äôs children isn‚Äôt arrogance? We disagree on science &amp; civility
@LeonardCohen2 fires no more frequent &amp; often: Rad Enviros prevent Forrest thinning or brush removal, so small fires becomes huge
@HellerExposed old trees absorb less CO2 &amp; produce little oxygen compared 2 younger trees. clear cutting &amp; replanting should be AGW position
@HellerExposed such fires here often result from Rad Enviros preventing clearing of Forrest brush, leaving more combust able to ignite
@HellerExposed such arrogant BS
@LeonardCohen2 oh calling someone dumb white flat earther not arrogance. Hmm
@LeonardCohen2 that‚Äôs really a great slogan. Ignoring many highly credentialed scientists who disagree with AGW claims doesn‚Äôt help Ur case
@LeonardCohen2 when skeptics raise issues, AGW advocates talk about how many experts agree,then call names. Hard to trust such arrogance
@LeonardCohen2 AGW advocates repeatedly claimed 97% scientists agreed with AGW claims.Not angry but they too called names. The 97% was bogus
@LeonardCohen2 yes it is bad manners to call those with whom U disagree dumb white flat earthers.
@LeonardCohen2 calling those with whom U disagree dumb white flat earthers = bad manners. citing examples of disagreement better approach
@sweettweettdude so the video was fake &amp; the prosecutor not political? Not the way I see it.
@sweettweettdude so the video of PP execs describing the cost for the tissue from various body parts and organs was a fake?
@LeonardCohen2 be angry but dismissing people  and calling names reflects more of a closed mind than the folks U despise
@sweettweettdude Americans who disagree with abortion will be severely punished investigating $ transactions of specific body parts. How sad
@LeonardCohen2 U R so sure man made CO2 is major factor in determining climate that U hold those who disagree in contempt &amp; call them names
@TaraSetmayer not sure. I was with Reagan the entire 76 campaign, but when he ran again I rejoined him a few months after the Iowa caucus
@Jakep12321 I really think direct contact &amp; media contact are about equal in impact as to how my constituents feel about me
@Jakep12321 no. Media is best used to notify those not my constituents. As for constituents direct contact most important
@TaraSetmayer Tara is a tremendous spokes person for limited gov, maximum liberty &amp; a secure America. Hope she runs for Congress someday
@Jakep12321 both staff &amp; media, &amp; personal contact. I am accessible to constituents in my office &amp; attend various district functions
@indyfly1 priorities pretty well covered last night
@indyfly1 lots of vital goals can be accomplished if time&amp;effort not wasted on symbolic unwinable fights that depend on 1/2 of Senate Dems
@indyfly1 U think possible 1/2 Senate Dems voting to remove Prez? Committing time&amp;energy on this mission impossible is not helping US
@1CalifDreamin thanks. I always try to call it as I see it. Not so Prez Obama, who has hidden much of what he believes from Am people.
@indyfly1 Lesson #1: it takes 2/3 Senate vote to remove an impeached President. Anyone thinking that is possible is not being rational.
@sugarcone4 last week I met with constituents in my office. Within 2 weeks plan a telephonic town hall, if the snow doesn‚Äôt get in the way
@sugarcone4 I answered that tweet. You just didn‚Äôt like the answer
@sugarcone4 I even answer that tweet. U just don‚Äôt like the answer
@BalochZeerak Rep. Poe &amp; I managed to halt delivery of F-16s to PAK because of PAK gov backing terrorists &amp; murdering Baloch &amp; others people
@jan_baloch1 Shameful that U.S. Providing weapons PAK gov using to murder Baloch &amp; others resisting PAK‚Äôs corrupt &amp; brutal oppression. I
@not_that_actor this view deserves an honest heartfelt discussion.
@brianhund sounds like a great memory
@NEDinPOL Ur continued personal abuse indicates a lack of integrity thus your words R no longer worth reading
@SIMON98756999 Ru giant steps since Communist fell. Putin flawed but trying 2 watch out 4 his country. Rad Islam now major threat 2 Ru &amp; US
@NEDinPOL Ur tactic of saying pejorative things about those who disagree with U indicates how seriously to consider Ur opinions
@NEDinPOL I seek truth in Congress &amp; ask tough questions, only those trying to push US into conflict with Russia react with personal attacks
@sportyjimmy Guess Ur plan for better world is treating Russia as if there‚Äôs been no change since Stalin
@sportyjimmy so U condemn American leaders who advocated cooperation with less than free regimes, like Stalin, to defeat Hitler &amp; Japan
@NEDinPOL oh how wonderful U can call someone a troll rather than making intelligent points. That speaks more of Ur mentality than mine
@NEDinPOL that is how U describe it &amp; that is BS.  Whatever Ur background there seems to be deeper reason for hatred of Putin.
@sportyjimmy Who R U 2 claim I don‚Äôt support my country. I have long record of taking risks &amp; service. What have U done that earns Am trust
@NEDinPOL so anyone who disagrees with gets labeled with such BS?
@sportyjimmy only thing clear is that U hate Ru &amp; Assad, which distorts Ur view so U want killing not peacemaking. I see&amp; listen both sides
@Margaret3786 atrocities on both sides, stumbling blocks to peace from both sides. Minsk agreement first good step needs to be implimented
@Tyroist yes, American voters, because of my loyalty to them, have re elected me with heavy majorities every time since 1988.
@sportyjimmy only idiots who cannot refute the arguments with which they disagree label the other side idiots
@discjocke52 I was journalist &amp; after 4 seven years a special assistant &amp; speechwriter 2 President Reagan. Our enemy commie Soviets not Ru
@discjocke52 Ukr non combatants killed by both sides including indiscriminate artillery shelling of Eastern towns by Kiev &amp; oligarch forces
@sportyjimmy Ur approach to an issue seems to be to dismiss an issue by a personal attack on the advocate without addressing the point
@sportyjimmy Adsad no more brutal than all the other tyrants &amp; kings in his neighborhood. Only he will kill those who would kill us.
@Beach_Mail thanks for the spelling tip. I miss such details when I answer tweets on the run.
@sportyjimmy Assad, like Saddam, no threat to US. He kills ISIS terrorists, who will kill Americans. Targeting Assad is anti-American BS
@Beach_Mail How intelectual of U.
@Beach_Mail climate changing for entire history of planet...nothing to do with man made CO2, which is such a microscopic part of atmosphere
@agamjd PAKs arrogantly rub US nose in their contempt by holding in jail Dr Afridi,who helped bring to justice murderer of 3,000 Americans.
@agamjd Taliban&amp;other terrorists created by Pakistan. PAKs use AID&amp;U.S.weapons to kill Americans,Afghans, Indians, Baloch&amp;repress PAK people
@goldenstatemade the company U highlighted is in Torrance, which is not in my district. They sound pretty good any how.
@KennethEugenePa you need to contact Ur current Congressman. We try to focus on problem solving for our constituents.
@SIMON98756999 I fully understand Ru frustration with US gov hostility when Ru is fighting terrorists which threaten both our countries
@BalochShaib I am trying my hardest to oppose US weapons going to Pakistan to be used against Baloch people Who are seeking their freedom.
@spo1981 I endorse Cruz, who opposes Global deployment of U.S. Military, he cares about threat to civil liberties, stands 4 constitution
@SIMON98756999 many Americans R grateful 2 Russian people 4 Ru military attacks in Syria against Radical Islamic terrorists who threaten us
@YugeTrumpnado we are calling on the American voters to remove the Obama gang from office when they go to the ballot box
@KathyTavoularis thanks for passing on the photo. Is my stomach really that big?
@RestaurantsAct The restaurant industry provides good jobs &amp; good food. My first job was an ice cream scooper at Marineland of the Pacific
@spo1981 I enjoy exchanging views, even with those with whom I disagree. Keep in touch.
@SIMON98756999 I don‚Äôt understand
@dcmarti1992 how intellectual of you. Guess this reflects your intelligence. Good luck
@dcmarti1992 do you always have such depth of understanding? You must have an intellectual
@spo1981 Obama won‚Äôt say ‚Äúradical Islamic Terrorist‚Äù but labels minor vandalism of few Mosques as Islamophobia, as terrorist slaughter us
@Banfael As proud Californian I cherish our Hispanic heritage. As Americans we should care more 4 each other rather than illegal immigrants
@KennethEugenePa where do you reside now?
@Doc_ChrisMoore U R right the Prez implied just that. I totally disagree. Thanks for the in-put. Going to bed. Good night
@Doc_ChrisMoore funny hit!
@Doc_ChrisMoore my Afghan connections in 1990s resulted in creation of anti-Taliban Northern Alliance after 9-11, which defeated Taliban
@danzig138 get a good nights sleep.
@Doc_ChrisMoore Risked life to fight Taliban. Our Prez can‚Äôt even utter words ‚ÄúRadical Islamic Terrorists‚Äù as Americans being slaughtered
@danzig138 R U trying to cover for Ur first stupid complaint?
@danzig138 U must be ignorant of method used in tweeting to minimize letters used, thus undermining the credibility of Ur complaint
@DickTracyOrlndo leader who won‚Äôt Say ‚ÄúRadical Islamic Terrorists‚Äù should not picture Americans as over reacting.Concerns totally legitimate
@DickTracyOrlndo quick interview while walking sometimes does not result in perfect grammar. Americans are not over reacting to terrorism
@DickTracyOrlndo a leader unable to utter words ‚ÄúRadical  Islamic Terrorist‚Äù should not suggest America is islamophobic
@sbrinton will look into it. Allowing it is different than Mandating it.
@PatrickHilsman language level &amp; use of profanity indicates who U R &amp; what U know. So I don‚Äôt need to hear from U again
@DrSamStrauss In the White House I had one of the first word processors.
@SIMON98756999 I support Cruz who is similar to Trump on Ru cooperation. Don‚Äôt get to pessimistic. Some of bad things U hear R inaccurate
@evarierac people of Catalonia have right to control their own destiny. having chosen a leader who is practical&amp; principled is positive step
@SIMON98756999 sorry my friend, I understand why U so distrust USA, but there R good people here who would not tolerate the evil U fear
@JoelCRosenberg spread word El Sisi a courageous champion of tolerance &amp; respect between people of all faiths, opposing radicals&amp;terrorists
@QueenOPortugal when it is difficult for someone to express disagreement without using profanity it is clear something is wrong
@surfcitysocal thanks for the memory. US going down &amp; RR put us back on upward path. He reminds me of Ted Cruz
@retiredfirstsgt what a great example U R, keep using vulgar terms and personal attacks. Is that acceptable for a teacher?
@retiredfirstsgt Ur vulgarity and personal attacks on those with whom U disagree reflects who U R. I don‚Äôt care to hear from such folks
@sugarcone4 U suggested some question as to my deferment, which was aimed at me personally...and it was wrong.
@sugarcone4 one month in Central Highlands, Plieku with Montanyards. So if U feel compelled to make personal attacks, make sure Ur right
@sugarcone4 I was not in Vietnam as a journalist. My draft status examined with micro scope a dozen times.
@SteveJessup_ Ur account demonstrates Ur willingness to repeat ugly lies about those with whom U disagree. That is about as low as it goes
@sugarcone4 I meet constituents in HB office monthly but those focused on specific policy or legislation or regulatory snafu R high priority
@MaxIgneous what are you talking about?
@sugarcone4 bitter views? Bitter, is not me. A questionable deferment? Shame on U? In 1967 I was in Vietnam, some danger but not in military
@shurup39 Ukr turmoil must end. Minsk Agreement a good road map. No steps yet establishing real fed/state    system &amp; nor legit Crimea vote
@spo1981 I believe that bill was part of the huge Omnibus bill that just passed. Will check.
@bigmacmcneely U have obviously joy studied my record. Perhaps U should before suggesting that I am in lock step with GOP
@shurup39 US has made mistakes. It did‚Äôt take US to create Rad Islam.That evil has been around a long time. Try not to believe worst in U.S.
@spo1981 please give me title of legislation. I do not remember bills by the number
@sugarcone4 Even as they slaughter innocents here, Paris &amp; elsewhere Prez Obama won‚Äôt say  Radical Islamic Terrorist. Dems won‚Äôt step up
@bigmacmcneely I have no idea what U R talking about
@shurup39 Kadaffi nor Assad no threat Rad Islamic terrorists want to terrorize West with mass murder like 9-11 &amp; random attacks like Paris
@AsteroidDay keep loudly warning till issue taken seriously. Everyone on planet vulnerable till defense against space objects in place.
@spo1981 I don‚Äôt memorize bill numbers. What is the title of the legislation?When was the vote?
@shurup39 some interesting points. Some stupid. foreign threats matter,not fiction: Nazism, Japanese Militarism,Communism, now Rad Islamism
@LibertySeeds I don‚Äôt know who David Brooks is talking about. Not one Republican has privately confided in me anything positive about Obama
@sugarcone4 Face realty, they R killing US &amp; Our Prez can‚Äôt say Radical Islamic Terrorist. This is a global phenomenon not one incident
@ArmIPunk the more honest people owning guns the less violent crime against honest people
@Hrh1942Harris I don‚Äôt remember bills by its number
@AndriyLesyuk I sent staff to Odessa. no one there suggests a massacre didn‚Äôt happen. Ur response indicates  how much U value life.
@AndriyLesyuk OK U just confirmed what Putin used as excuse. Will try not let it cloud my judgement, but will remember Ur cavalier attitude
@AndriyLesyuk U speak of Odessa Massacre with no remorse, or mention of how bad it was? Such attitudes, not Ru, created Ukr tragedy.
@AndriyLesyuk Forcing out elected Prez &amp; slaughtering his supporters in Odessa is what created the UKR nightmare &amp; brought RU intervention
@CALIF2010S when a nazi dictatorship or a commie dictatorship:staying out right thing to do...then Japan attacked US &amp; Hitler declared war
@AndriyLesyuk basics:elected Prez Yanocovich forced out. His supporters slaughtered in Odessa. That resulted in war &amp; uncontrolled violence
@myroslawabrulak Soviets &amp; Nazis started WWII, then the Russian &amp; German people suffered more than anybody
@flatcatcanyon  been many expansions/contractions of ocean levels, none human caused. U should ask 1 of many scientists who agree with that
@beachvetlbc sometimes it is. When fanatics or gangstersget control gov. They don‚Äôt respond to normal diplomacy.
@flatcatcanyon Currents, volcanic activity(like under South Pole),ect.However,sea level rise may not be the scourge it is portrayed to be
@NkSibco sorry fella, Ur conspiracy theories are nonsense. There R good &amp; bad Jews on every side of every issue.
@flatcatcanyon do Ur own research, note what founder of Greenpeace, Dr Michel Moore, is saying. polar bears still here, 16 yrs temp flat
@bigmacmcneely so if U R independent as U claim please tell us three issues which U reject a Dem position &amp; support the Rep position.
@NkSibco I don‚Äôt think they secretly coordinate together. That is unrealistic paranoia
@bigmacmcneely Obama betrays US: work permits 4 hundreds of thousands,legalizing status of millions. Who benefits? Leftist Dems, not US
@bigmacmcneely how much richer must Clintons or Al Gore  become, how much longer Obama refuse to acknowledge Islamic terrorists B4 U wise up
@bigmacmcneely baloney, Obsma inherited a bad situation &amp; turned it into catastrophe.,never able to say the phrase radical Islamic terrorist
@beachvetlbc correct!!
@SheriffPokins The decision on NATO membership should be made by free people not elitists. If majority oppose is wrong to force it upon them
@SheriffPokins if South would not permitted all residents to make decision, they would‚Äôve had a right to secede. Slaves &amp; others left out
@flatcatcanyon sea levels have fluctuated as has  ice coverage at the poles. Currents created by sun  &amp; volcanic activity have major impact
@SheriffPokins The right of self-determination was proclaimed by our founding fathers in our declaration of independence.
@islandjohnny2 I don‚Äôt check who has contributed the meager funds raised by my campaigns.Ur oil donation claim is a stupid personal  jab
@islandjohnny2 my opposition to AGW theory not based on what prominent Ru scientists have determined, but nice to know on what they believe
@islandjohnny2 that‚Äôs a good way to ignore points U can‚Äôt answer. advocates of AGW known for personal attacks rather than addressing points
@islandjohnny2 so no honest person disagrees with U. AGW advocates respond to factual arguments with personal attacks. Shame on U
@islandjohnny2 on 3 occasions I met in Russia with senior members of Ru Academy of Science who opposed AGW theory&amp; believed world is cooling
@meerakbaloch287 I have some credibility but no authority. The best I can do is mobilize opposition to US military aid to PAK
@jordi_salvia 2015 a good year 4 Catalonian resurgence. In 2016 may U achieve the democratic goals of sovereignty for which U have struggled
@meerakbaloch287 thank U. May 2016 be the year when the Baloch people triumph over evil &amp; R blessed with the peace &amp; freedom they deserve
Merry Christmas from the Rohrabacher Family - https://t.co/1Ny87phyKF
Merry Christmas from the Rohrabacher Family - https://t.co/1Ny87pza9f
@flatcatcanyon there‚Äôs many ways the sun can have its impact. There have been so many climate cycles &amp; what‚Äôs happening now is not unique
@NkSibco please refrain from vulgarity. It takes away from your credibility anyway.
@NkSibco nobody controls the U.S. Gov but those Americans who vote. There R  many groups with influence, often competing with each other.
@NkSibco could be, there have been so many changes in earths climate, none of them a result of human activity
@flatcatcanyon 16yrs of major increase in man made CO2 in atmosphere, yet global temp flat;earth cycle now not dissimilar from past cycles
@meandrums his removal would require a vote for impeachment &amp; conviction by half the Dems plus all the Reps in the House &amp; Senate.
@meandrums what can be done is that we learn a lesson and be tough on election fraud so we never get another Obama.
@MexicoNoAvanza Feliz Navidad, amigo
@meandrums the Am people twice voted him to be their President. We need get the message out as to the disaster his regime has been
@timesofpak123 Americans R at last becoming aware of evil doings of the Pak gov. The corruption, murderous repression, support for terrorism
@ColeStewart9 good luck and smooth sailing
@doctor_R12 trying my best. keep Ur spirits up.American people are beginning to understand the ugly reality of Pakistan.
@JeffNnaka Ur cause is just. There is so much turmoil good people unaware of Ur heroic struggle. Keep Ur spirits up. The truth will prevail
@MarcieDreyer Randy is one of the best in Congress. I disagreed with him on this one.
@DrSamStrauss U have been an inspiration. Thanks for taking time for God words &amp; best wishes. You too buddy
Why I voted against the trillion dollar fiasco - https://t.co/g3hTsaiqvV
@BaseZombie Y do U feel compelled to attack personally those with whom U disagree? In this cases by passing on lie that was exposed long ago
@BaseZombie we released video &amp; photos of the whole house upon exiting that showed totally different tale than the ugly lie U R repeating.
@EconomyRadio My motto: fighting for freedom &amp; having fun. It is time for us to get the word out &amp; mobilize the patriots. Great meeting you
@NoVaSnark of course  I am deeply engaged in supporting opposition to Iranian Mullah regime, so Ur Middle East word game is nonsense
@NoVaSnark Our criteria differs. Opposing el SiSi, as U advocate, means a dramatic Increase in power of Rad Islamic terrorists who hate USA
@NoVaSnark  freedom in Egypt gone forever if Saudi financed radical liar succeeded in turning Egypt into a anti-western Califate
@NoVaSnark so U want us to refuse to support groups or gov that R fighting terrorist who would destroy our country &amp; terrorize our people
@NoVaSnark Ur criticism focuses on those less than free governments which R at war with terrorists &amp; regimes that kill Americans
@NoVaSnark  so siding with Stalin to defeat Hitler was wrong. Do U hit america‚Äôs Enemies, as much as U do  those who side with us.?
@BaseZombie A recent study has me third poorest in Congress?If seriously opposed to self enriching politicos try 2 Cal senators &amp; Hillary
@NoVaSnark too many want war with Russia again. Same gang focuses on flaws of those who would help us defeat rad terrorist who would kill us
@UrsocUrsol the female shooter went through Visa process which was obviously inadequate. Prez wants more to flood in before fixing system
@007Rousseau US will continue down road to economic oblivion until Am 	voters elect a different kind of president.
@EspuelasVox no I listen &amp; consider opinions of Russian &amp; many other scientists many of whom who disagree with CO2 theory. Open Ur mind
@XxPlixsterxX not up till tomorrow
@BryanKillett Do U claim no AGW advocates have misrepresented any facts.? Well, U just misrepresented my comment &amp; refuse to admit it
@BryanKillett I don‚Äôt use word liar 2 describe those who disagree with me &amp; I don‚Äôt remember such an exchange with U. Now U can‚Äôt show it
@BryanKillett U claimed I called U a liar &amp; fanatic. Now U can‚Äôt admit U were wrong. Guess there is a reason U thought I was referring to U
@BryanKillett so U‚Äôve no admission U were wrong when you claimed I called U a‚Äùliar‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúfanatic‚Äù. So RU a scientist unable to admit mistakes
@BryanKillett I don‚Äôt use the word liar &amp; do not believe all scientists who disagree with me R liars. I believe there are such scientists
@BryanKillett I don‚Äôt know U so I would not assume U R a fanatic or a liar because we disagree. So I guess U admit I didn‚Äôt call U that
@BryanKillett I keep looking at my tweets I don‚Äôt see any calling U anything. Do U assume saying fanatics push AGW that I‚Äôm referring to U
@BryanKillett maybe when I claim there R fanatics who advocate AGW, U assume I‚Äôm talking about U? Hmm
@BryanKillett I don‚Äôt remember tweeting U or mention U before U jumped in claiming I called U a ‚Äúfanatic‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúliar‚Äù Where is Ur verification
@BryanKillett still waiting for U to back up Ur accusatory slam, give me my quote callimy someone a liar and U  a fanatic, can U admit error
@BryanKillett where did I call U a fanatic. Where did I use word liar. If U can‚Äôt show it. Can U admit U were wrong, or was it intentional
@drmstix21 there is no ban. There‚Äôs been enormous research on this issue. If one of the many well financed foundations wants to do more, OK
@BryanKillett A joy to discuss AGW with Alley.Unlike those who can‚Äôt seem to disagree without personal jabs, he is smart enough 2 B civil
@BryanKillett copying my retort is not creative. So where did I use the word liar. That is a specific question
@HellerExposed only those incapable of intellectually defending their beliefs dismiss critics, claim consensus, &amp; label others as stupid
@drmstix21 would be many more deaths in my district if more honest people disarmed, leaving them more vulnerable to criminals &amp; terrorists
@HellerExposed AGW appears fraudulent when specific objections to theory ignored, answered by dismissal, name calling or claim of consensus
@HellerExposed that is what each side of this issue is saying about the other.
@BryanKillett being wrong means the wasteful destruction of wealth that could be used for improving the lives of human beings
@BryanKillett beautifully done, but not intellectually convincing.
@Rockin_48 right!
@HellerExposed so U believe U have better understanding of science than the many prominent scientists who don‚Äôt accept CO2 GWarming theory?
@HellerExposed some day you may realize otherwise. Or maybe I am wrong. Keep in mind that may be true for you as well.
@MailOsta your statements are becoming a bit too much for me to deal with. Not sure if U celebrate, but I wish U a great Christmas&amp;NewYear
@MailOsta power is profit goal of tyrants. Soviets had huge army &amp; beat into submission Russians &amp; others in name of creating no $ world.
@HellerExposed U R as confident in Ur world view as I am in mine. Info about past, present &amp; future global conditions will tell the tale
@HellerExposed it was an announcement from NASA three weeks ago. Did you miss it?
@frankgideonnna1 internationally supervised referendum should let Biafrans determine their status. U.S. Declaration of Independence model
@HellerExposed right, That‚Äôs the way I viewed the recent admission that Antarctica has been cooling for six years, hmm. Stay warm
@MailOsta more paranoia.
@MailOsta during 60 Soviet yrs millions of Russian &amp; Ukrainians brutally murdered &amp; enormous wealth squandered pushing Marx on others
@MailOsta I have no idea what you are referring to
@MailOsta The Russian people fundamentally good, as are most Americans. Some power manipulators stuck in the past here, in Ru too.
@MailOsta US has been dramatically expanding its oil &amp; gas production so no need for weird conspiracies.
@MailOsta Soviet Union based on evil atheist philosophy which used Russia‚Äôs wealth&amp; influence to implant in other countries. USA flawed too
@MailOsta Soviet goal: dictatorship of proletariat, an atheist dictatorship,evil &amp; forced upon Ru neighbors. USA has had many flaws too
@iam_ipob I support right of Biafran people to referendum that will determine their sovereign status &amp; oppose violence used to oppress them
@insprme labeling yes. Banning no!!!
@chimdiya1 I support the right of the Biafran people to a referendum on their independence.
@chimdiya1 I support the right of all people, including Biafrans, to determine their national status via an honest referendum
@clay_sears which specific bill are you asking about. Been two bills one of which I supported the other I opposed
@ArmIPunk how many more people in my district would be victimized or killed by criminals or terrorists if honest people are disarmed.
@futuretechgrp boy was that an intellectual attack on...opps U forgot 2 try 2 refute a position I advocated &amp; made a personal attack instead
@Livn2BFree I‚Äôd ask how much do U get from anti-Americans like George Sorros, but Better to refute arguments rather than personal attacks
@CynicalCenter keep using 97%rather than trying to make those other bogus science claims like weather is now more sever &amp; Antarctica melting
@Livn2BFree how come U R compelled to asses me personally rather than refute my what I advocate. That is standard approach for AGW advocates
@CynicalCenter U R dead wrong. even Prez Obama‚Äôs science advisor when asked at a Congressional hearing would not endorse this phony ploy.
@RockDots does calling voters morons make U feel superior. Try refuting specific challenges to the issue rather than being personal jabs
@CynicalCenter keep using 97% claim. It is so bogus even Prez Obama‚Äôs science advisor won‚Äôt back it up. GWarming based on many false claims
@Amelia98 how about presenting Ur argument rather than verbally punching someone for disagreeing with you
@khwalz NASA finally admitted Antarctic cooling of last 6 years. Seems like yesterday frantic GWarming advocates just the opposite.
@Livn2BFree why do U feel compelled to attack personally &amp; destroy those who disagree with U. U obviously don‚Äôt think U can make Ur case
@CynicalCenter thousands of U.S. Scientists don‚Äôt support GWarming theory, as do foreign scientists, including top level Russian scientists
@jefflemberg the harder U make it for an honest citizen to posses a gun, the more power U give to criminals &amp; terrorists
@Youxia88 glad U  admit U would put us at mercy of criminals &amp; terrorists by disarming honest Americans.
@rhimp don‚Äôt distract helpless Americans. U want them disarmed &amp; at the mercy of criminals &amp; terrorists.
@rhimp wrong. ‚ÄúI am pro freedom, not pro gun, Honest citizens have the right to possess a gun. If U would disarm them U R anti freedom
@MailOsta I hope that what U say is nothing more than paranoia.
@MailOsta I hope what U say is paranoia of one person. If leaders  believe they R about to be attacked gov can make disastrous mistakes
@rhimp these terrorists were also making bombs. Does this mean we need to outlaw pipes?
@GonzaloMarginet they expect me to do what I believe in. Because you disagree with me does not justify your vilification &amp; personal attacks
@GonzaloMarginet anyone donates to my campaign does so because he or she agrees with what I believe &amp; do.Pretending that‚Äôs wrong is BS
@RNHbjen I oppose any tax on Internet activity
@DannySkarka I raise very little &amp; don‚Äôt pay attention to who donates &amp; how much. Is the figure U quoted over a period of years?
@DannySkarka I don‚Äôt pay any attention details about contribution to my campaign. Over how many years were those NRA contribution given?
@RNHbjen oppose any internet based taxation
@DannySkarka I don‚Äôt pay attention to who has donated. Over how many years does the figure U sent reflect, maybe 20 yrs?
@MailOsta thanks for sending on the Wesley Clark video. It is important for people to see it. Will make sure it is part of our debate
@teuta have read On Liberty. John Stuart Mill would wonder how U justify telling others they can‚Äôt own a gun because that is what you want.
@roryaronson U R a true believer, as indicated by thinking those who disagree R ‚Äúoff their rocker‚Äù
@roryaronson For years gloom &amp; doom predictions based on CO2 used to justify global gov control of of our lives.
@KCholaks dislike lying which is what global warming fanatics do.
@MailOsta don‚Äôt be so pessimistic. 50 yrs ago this type of positive interaction not possible. We can make things right between our countries
@MailOsta powerful political players here continue to see Ru as a Cold War enemy. Their negativity &amp; double standards undercut cooperation
@teuta wonderful, then don‚Äôt buy one,but leave other honest citizens to make their own choice. Do U have a NO GUNS HERE sign on Ur door ?
@roryaronson U R still using that discredited claim of 97%. Keep using it, it undermines your credibility.
@InmigrantNacion Hispanic Americans descent oppose giving to those here illegally the jobs &amp; gov benefits that should go to U.S. Citizens
@ahmedm_ human rights violations happen in crisis 4 non-extremist gov. Rad Islamic regime terrorism &amp; on-going rights violations
@matijaabicic So if I‚Äôm wrong just say it: U do not seek to disarm honest people, especially light of terrorists random attacks on them
@yankefan only jerks lacking intelligence label those they disagree with as jerks, rather than trying to refute arguments or question facts
@teuta people in gated communities or live in guarded upper income apartments already protected&amp;can‚Äôt see why regular folks want a gun
@plettkeman if born overseas to non-citizen parents, even if naturalized that person not eligible to be Prez.
@plettkeman like John McCain or Ted Cruz, if parents R US citizens, wherever born he is a U.S. Citizen, no naturalization process needed
@MailOsta I won‚Äôt lecture, but with all our flaws I still believe US to be freest &amp; most opportunity filled for ordinary people
@matijaabicic keep advocating the disarming of honest people. They know it will put them at the mercy of criminals &amp; terrorists.
@matijaabicic OK compare Chicago to any city in Texas. Inhaven‚Äôt seen latest figures but in past stats backed up what common sense suggests
@MailOsta conspiracy no. Stupidity yes. I really did not like either Bush, but unlike current Prez, the people knew who they were electing
@MailOsta Clark honest but not wise. His reaction to info about Bush war plans not appropriate. Bush elected, it was no coup. It was stupid
@matijaabicic u want honest people disarmed but can‚Äôt admit it will result in more violent deaths. Heavy gun control = more murders.
@matijaabicic yes, terrorists in Paris &amp; elsewhere are likely to kill fewer victims than they intend if some of their targets are armed
@MailOsta There is good reason to be depressed even angry at the hostility shown Russia since the fall communism, Syria may wake up America
@matijaabicic the Paris massacre would not have succeeded, just as attacks on our campuses, had a number of victims been armed.
@MailOsta I have pointed out senseless hostility toward Russia evident in many U.S. policy makers. I don‚Äôt believe they want to attack
@MailOsta my faith protects me from hatred &amp; other destructive temptations. But must be accompanied by respect others or it is destructive
@MailOsta admittedly JFK murder reports do not inspire trust, but there is as great a chance Oswald was a commie as their is that he was CIA
@MailOsta I agree with that
@MailOsta I think in last 20 yrs some US moves in Middle East were result of Cold War mind set(hostility to Ru)even though Cold War was over
@MailOsta have worked highest level of U.S. Gov &amp; never met anyone who would plan the death of Americans, others maybe, not Americans
@MailOsta there was no excuse for Syria to shoot down Russian plane. It was clearly no threat. Turkish planes stray over Greece all the time
@MailOsta Iraq invasion stupid &amp; arrogant from beginning. My mistake to back Bush then. Don‚Äôt know of 7 country plan, but it could be true.
@MailOsta I don‚Äôt know of US plan to bomb seven countries.
@MailOsta  as a boy Prez Obama mentored by Marxists &amp; Muslims. Many believe today he has wrong ideas &amp; is sympathetic with wrong people,
@MailOsta many Americans don‚Äôt know there is freedom of Religion in Ru. Russian courage in attacking terrorists will capture their hearts
@MailOsta thanks for music. My kids &amp; I really enjoyed it.
@MailOsta I issued a statement today thanking Russia for fighting against Radical Islamic terrorists in Syria &amp; condemning Turkey
@MailOsta Today our families gather to feast &amp; give thanks to God. Peace &amp; good will between Ru&amp;US would be greatest blessing both peoples
@MailOsta try to understand hate filled people are in both our countries. They want to reignite Cold War &amp; manipulate less thoughtful people
Update from Egypt - https://t.co/VNytZ8pEpg
@MailOsta what R U talking about?
@rhimp many refugees take risk 4 better life. All Christian refugees targeted,fleeing 4 their lives, desrve special consideration
@JackMeHoffTX Was Cruz granted Canadian citizenship? Was he the child of US Citizen?
@plettkeman permitting election of legal immigrants who resided in U.S. &amp; been citizens 20 yrs irrelevant to definition of ‚ÄúNatural born‚Äù
@plettkeman that is Ur definition. It is my understanding Cruz was born to US citizens &amp; thus was a U.S. Citizen at birth.
@rhimp I‚Äôve condemned Muslims persecuted in Burma. If it continues there‚Äôs refuge Bangladesh. Targeted Christians no homeland 4 refuge
@rhimp they were the ones who are targeted for genocide. You can ignore that and talk about other points but that is the stark reality.
@honeybee7885 most legal immigrants are more patriotic and freedom loving than home grown candidates, who often take America for granted
@mpchc1 obviously we think each other is out of touch. The Am people will decide unless U cancel their votes out by letting illegals vote
@rhimp I am in Paris. 130 people slaughtered &amp; 300 wounded here 1 week ago. a short pause 2 ensure it doesn‚Äôt happen in U.S. Is reasonable
@HellerExposed your faith in me is magnanimous
Rohrabacher Endorses Cruz for President - https://t.co/shh3Xj0TJe @tedcruz
@mpchc1 U have a low opinion of America and could careless that bringing into our country could result in the slaughter of Americans
@mpchc1 those claiming I am only advocating letting Christians in R lying and U repeating that lie.
@mpchc1 if U really believe that U should go live somewhere else. Ur view of America is distorted by negativity  that U extenuated our flaws
@CongressPulse when Christians are targeted for genocide they should have priority for immigration status over those who are not targeted
@mpchc1 baloney, U Insist that Christian targets of genocide not be given priority. Same reasoning that resulted in Jews sent back in 1938
@mpchc1 R U volunteering 2 take refugees into Ur home? Do U care if terrorists posing as refugees R given chance 2 murder Americans?
@mpchc1 not stunning. consistent with Ur refusal to give priority to Christians when they R in most danger,  same happened to Jews in 1938
@mpchc1 duh! Middle East Christians, just like European Jews 80 yrs ago, R targeted 4 genocide. Those in most danger should get most help
@mpchc1 would you have sent back Jews fleeing Hitler so more Christians could get here &amp; shrugged off the holocaust as a set back?
@zzzzbarb preventing the genocidal slaughter of Christians is a valid reason to let a some of them come here, after venting of course
@jayteegee will do my best, which at this point means giving priority to Christians to come here
@thevaliumsofa my legislation, because they are targets of genocide, would give priority to Christians to come here.
@mpchc1 children targeted 4 mass slaughter by genocidal maniacs should get priority over those who might or might not be randomly killed.
@mpchc1 Obama‚Äôs &amp; Ur unwillingness to prioritize refugee &amp; immigration policy 2 save Christians targeted 4 genocide tells a lot about him&amp; U
@TCassa89 4th highest gun rate IN EUROPE, that doesn‚Äôt mean much
@meandrums that is up to our governor &amp; legislature
@SpacerockDodger thanks for keeping us reminded about this ultimate yet ignored danger
@chimdiya1   Will be paying more attention to plight of Biafran people
@zzzzbarb certainly Christians under threat of genocide should not be excluded from the USA
@lover_weather taking guns away from honest citizens means terrorists &amp; criminals will more likely break into homes &amp; hijack cars
@ricfouad those Northern Alliance fighters fought Taliban. We could use their help against ISIS.
@lover_weather most U.S. gun deaths by criminals 4 whom it is already to possess a gun in cities with heavy gun control laws
@cburns926 US has spent $billions on intelligence tech. Sharing info with France would be of help
@ArmIPunk Paris terror attack shows why disarming honest citizens is the last thing our gov should be doing
@mpchc1 Nothing wrong prioritizing efforts so those targeted 4 genocide R first 2 save because terrorists have made them first to be killed
@jasperhutchings history of Middle East countries:Despotism, squandering wealth, blood feuds, religious persecution, subjugation of women
@hammettmi1 I agree with you and will do my best
@mangan_mike  he should hear from his voters, not me. Californians pay one dollar more for each gallon of gas because of such nonsense
@GonzaloMarginet isn‚Äôt it wonderful U can send such a negative message 2 an elected official without fear of reprisal? Can we agree on that?
@yuri_nahl I try to promote peace and freedom by insisting on truth. It ain‚Äôt easy
@JoshuaNehmeh Middle East Christians are targeted for extinction. We must do what we can to thwart this evil and save them from genocide.
Capitol Hill Update - https://t.co/avoPOo4Z6Y
@firmgreen it is such a joy to see the many public expressions of gratitude to our Vets. Ur event on Saturday exemplified that spirit
@NaderHasan63 highest standard is majority determines through election who controls gov, but the gov itself respects rights of al citizens
@_missingBaloch I‚Äôm dismayed no matter how loud I speak  Am leaders don‚Äôt pay attention to the slaughter Baloch by U.S. Armed Pak military
@NaderHasan63 yes, just like most countries there R double standards, but we try to have the highest standards.
@brookestewart have him call in advance. We do this for dozens of wonderful young people. 714-960-6483
@NaderHasan63 people of Bahrain should determine their gov through an honest election
@surfcitysocal shutting down fed gov to force this Prez to acquiesce is costly: $2 to $20 billion, so good chance of success or don‚Äôt do it
@NaderHasan63 steps to prevent murder of those in Camp Liberty should have been taken long ago. I have no power but to draw attention to it
@TPP4Jobs if our trading relations with Pacific countries so good Y the push 4 new ground rules &amp; an arbitration panel to rule over it
@MailOsta I have strong disagreement with McCain on significant issues but I do not believe he would conspire to shoot down a U.S. Aircraft
@MailOsta I don‚Äôt agree with those guys, but do not believe there is a conspiracy
@LibertySeeds leftists election wins reflects basic change brought on by decades of propaganda &amp; importing people with different values
@insyyte unfortunately, many of my colleagues refuse to see military waste or even consider any new more cost affective defense strategy
@Mr_Bundesliga  you intentionally misrepresented what I said about Neo nazis role in Ukraine upheaval. They high jacked a peaceful protest
@Mr_Bundesliga extensive film footage shows people peacefully using their freedom to protest hijacked by fire bomb throwing street nazis
@SchoolerRobert  I am studying it
@cburns926 thanks for the thought. How are they doing now. I am as frustrated about the speaker as you are.
@Mr_Bundesliga presence of Ru troops known since Odessa massacre, question is R pro-Kiev oligarch troops still a major force on battle field
@hbagainsthd OK
@meerinjo wrong guys, Louie and I are about the only ones speaking up for Baloch and opposing military aid to Pakistan
@HellerExposed getting late, got to get to bed. Keep singing, I wish you a good night sleep.
@HellerExposed if Ur reading something in the New York Times U might consider it is information being fed 2 U by the establishment.
@HellerExposed Oh I thought that was a way to call me a dummy. I must be one for thinking something like that?
@HellerExposed R U back 2 calling names? OK, what was the jump &amp; the actual numbers?Guess only a dummy would notice it missing in article
@HellerExposed not hottest since 1880, ‚ÄúLIKELY hottest‚Äù since recording temps began in 1880. How hot &amp; size of increase, not mentioned.
@HellerExposed I must of misread the article. U mean it didn‚Äôt say this was hottest year since 1880? If that is case it was hotter long ago
@LibbyHuyck I am obviously not a Ryan supporter.
@LibbyHuyck U don‚Äôt know Webster. More important he has been far to short a time to understand what the speaker‚Äôs job entails
@HellerExposed hottest since 1880, really. So 1880 was hotter even with all that CO2 since. how much hotter this year than last?
@LbrtyNews thanks for calling my attention to those bills. I will be co-sponsoring them tomorrow.
@cbclark777 U don‚Äôt know my resume. Ur retort has all the sophistication of high school letters editor.
@cbclark777 so if amnesty, over a ten yr period, would result in 40million more foreigners here you would oppose it?
@debra_rohrer is violation of law established by Congress 4 fed prosecutors to attack medical marijuana in states that have made it legal
@XxPlixsterxX I oppose Ryan but if he wins GOP vote over my opposition I will not insist I get my way or I won‚Äôt abide by vote.
@cbclark777 that U know nothing about except militaristic cliches. I have seen war &amp; conflict up close and that jingoism creates quagmires
@TenneyNaumer predictions of major temp jump failed to materialize thus  CO2 theory on which theory based is wrong, thus AGW studies R bogus
@pietie68ps in WWII US+Stalin against Hitler, in Cold War US+China&amp;other murky characters against Soviets. now RU+US against Islamic Terror
@pietie68ps like Assad, Saddam repressed his people but no enemy 2 US or Euro countries. Our intervention freed radicals from restraint
@spo1981 keeping GOP reps together not easy &amp; a thankless job.Having temp Speaker till next election could keep us attacking Dems not GOPers
@MissionIsraelTM Assad is severely flawed but he is not our enemy. He is the enemy of our enemy: Rad Islamic Terrorism.
@spo1981 neither one
@cbclark777 U know nothing about Syria. Israel neighbor, but no conflict for over 3 decades. Assad has protected Christians. Think 4 Urself
@SpacerockDodger 4 20yrs warning that we R not prepared to deflect a big rock from space that could destroy the earth. I will keep trying
@cbclark777 anti -Israeli?Assad regime at peace with its neighbor(Israel) for decades. If Russia friend region could be stabilized
@cbclark777 we can defeat Rad Islamic Terrorism &amp; stabilize region if Russia on our side. Knuckle heads stuck in Cold War will defeat us
@cbclark777 ‚ÄúUS vetted opposition‚Äù U fall 4 all the BS they feed U. Bush destabilized region, Obama turned bad situation into catastrophe
@cbclark777 thousands of ISIL R Chechnyans.Islamic Terrorists kill Russians. Ur Cold War mentality undermines effort 2 beat terrorists
@cbclark777 An influential clique wanted us 2take out every 2bit dictator,like Sadam Husaine&amp; Assad, destabilizing region/launching radicals
@cbclark777 yes, the WSJ also supports open boarders(amnesty=40million newcomers)and most favored nation trade status with communist China
@cbclark777 Russia hitting enemies of Assad, many R ISIL. Assad bad but never our enemy. If belligerent 2 enemies of our enemies, we lose
@cbclark777 Russia can help us defeat mutual enemy: Rad Islam Terrorists, unless Americans stuck in Cold War mentality insist on hostility
@cbclark777 primary threat 2 US:Rad Islamic Terrorism. If nuclear blast kills 100,000 in U.S. It will be Islamic terrorists, not Russia
@EWCrushin more &amp;	More evidence everyday that AGW is a fraud being used to justify enhancing Global Gov power over our lives.
@HaiwtanBaloch I‚Äômsad I have not been able 2 get my countrymen to see the brutal &amp; murderous repression of Baloch people, I will keep trying
@MailOsta trying to promote peace &amp; cooperation between Russia &amp; USA is hard enough...but progress is being made
@flatcatcanyon studies of ice cores show temp jumps followed by hike in CO2. Ur source says it is ‚ÄúHypothesized‚Äùthat magnetism released CO2
@HellerExposed I have enjoyed our exchange. U offered legit challenges, unlike other AGW advocates who seem to focus on calling names
@flatcatcanyon isn‚Äôt there research indicating temp jump proceeded jump in CO2? Coral reefs may be victims of human pollution but not CO2
@HellerExposed So coral declines happened even before humans yet this time it‚Äôs us. Doesn‚Äôt research indicate temp hikes proceeded CO2 jump?
@TamrikoT if true, another stupid decision by U.S. Foreign policy elite. Russia &amp; US natural allies in fight against Rad Islamic terrorism
@Network_Citizen how can anyone support Webster if he refuses to pledge support for winner of GOP  leadership race ?
@Network_Citizen Webster refuses    At g
@TamrikoT not me. &amp; a growing  number of Americans aware campaign smearing Russia not accurate &amp; undercuts mutually beneficial cooperation
@HellerExposed after checking, there has been several near mass extinctions of coral reefs. Blaming current situation on AGW is typical BS
@sugarcone4 I agree. Will have telephonic town hall soon.
@dingbat so I don‚Äôt value police lives unless I do what you want. A bit arrogant don‚Äôt you think ?
@NJSnowFan yes, he postures a scientist, but Let‚Äôs see if he ignores question if there have been past  reef die offs in past.
@NJSnowFan appreciate Ur advice. AGWadvocates focus on personal attacks &amp; he at times makes points without such abuse. U may know him better
@dingbat people disarming selves?I oppose gov disarming honest citizens which will embolden criminals who now refrain from home attacks
@HellerExposed has there been past large scale die off of coral reefs? Polar ice shows ample evidence of water temp changes,
@HellerExposed So R U telling me this has never happened before? Does volcanic activity have any impact? Anarctic ice is impacted by it.
@ArmIPunk do U know how many more of my constituents would have been killed by criminals if they knew honest citizens were disarmed?
@HellerExposed so many claims of average earth temp to 100th a degree in whatever sphere make no sense when hourly variation is evident
@flatcatcanyon how many degrees warmer,how many cooler? no pause claims based on Global average temp at 100th a degrees: baloney
@sugarcone4 Depends on how the law is written. It certainly less a threat to a persons rights than most gun control proposals
@TenneyNaumer opinion of oil Company Scientists are considered as  bogus as the claim 97o/o of scientists support man made Global Warming
@TenneyNaumer
HellerExposed Earth is one degree  warmer than last years of mini ice age.  That is nothing abnormal
@LbrtyNews Yes.. Will check HR 14
@HellerExposed how about the Sun, same source as made the earth hotter a thousand yrs ago, then cooled it&amp; warmed it again.
@greengoddess892 maybe challenge my beliefs with facts or logic rather than claiming because I disagree with U that I am a shill or liar
@TenneyNaumer plenty of scientists verify global temp only up 1 degree in 150 yrs since Mini Ice Age bottomed out. Oil Co info not needed
@greengoddess892 I don‚Äôt find it ironic that people with closed minds Believe that those who disagree with them are shills
@HellerExposed my answer indicated that if the phenomenon is result of temp it may have nothing to do with human activity,
@GordBolton EU &amp; US must cease belligerence toward Russia &amp; reach out 2 find ways to cooperate, especially when combating Rad Islamic terror
@HellerExposed Global Temp up 1 degree since low point of mini Ice Age 300 yr temp decline. Predictions based on CO2 theory fail to appear
@ggeett37aaa Webster is an intelligent patriot, however, he is a newcomer
@OCTeaPartyBlog Ryan is man of integrity who believes in policies that will dramatically hurt American people to help foreigners
@cbclark777 Comdemning Putin in Syria puts U on side of Rad Islamic Terrorists
@cbclark777 I side with those, including Putin&amp;Assad, who R fighting primary threat to Am people: Rad Islamic Terrorists
@mangan_mike thanks for the reminder. I requested the hearing to the chairman of the science cmtee, but got caught up on other things since
@pat2pat2pat hope for care taker speaker who will step aside in14 months. Dana
@SpacerockDodger until we can protect earth from astroid hit, pouring $ into Mars mission is not rational use of limited $.
@DrSamStrauss I‚Äôm flattered by the suggestion, but got 11 yr old triplets who need a dad. Best a senior member do the job till next election
@cbclark777 applaud Putin when his action is mutually beneficial to his country&amp; ours, like killing rad Islamic terrorists in Syria
@jrg0569 thanks 4 praise. I spent 50 yrs defeating communism. God znow blessed me with 11 yr old triplets. Speaker is never home: no can do
@Network_Citizen Wenster is a patriot &amp; a good man,but hasn‚Äôt been around long enough to get the Top Job
@cbclark777 we should applaud Putin for eliminating Rad Islamic terrorists in Syria and elsewhere.
@Commoncents4me Reagan never tried to get everything he wanted. He aggressively advocated his goals but was willing to accept compromise
@spo1981 not Kevin
@DiegoUK do U ever think your knowledge base is too limited to justify insulting people who work hard because they disagree with you?
@Commoncents4me not voting for Kevin
@StupidBoomers not voting for Kevin
@catpaq do Ikudt ignore the 2/3 vote needed to over ride Prez veto
@OCTeaPartyBlog so U simply ignore the 2/3 vote needed to override a veto.
@spo1981 Ed Royce
@catpaq correct,and the vote no on the budget was a show vote
@OCTeaPartyBlog we placed bill defunding PP on his desk, we placed budget not addressing PP. If we do it right we can win this in 18 months
@OCTeaPartyBlog sorry I will vote against funding PPbut will not shut gov. Voters likely to see closing gov as fanaticism hurting next year
@OCTeaPartyBlog I voted defund PP &amp; 4 budget not dealing with PP but Gov kept open. I meant gov shut most GOP NO votes would have been YES
@surfcitysocal Vote against funding PP not good enough,U want gov shut down. Look, Am people gave Obama Presidental power, that‚Äôs reality
@catpaq we voted to defund PP then in seperate vote passed legislation that did not deal with PP but kept gov operating
@MailOsta I have an idea. It wasn‚Äôt one source.
@1CalifDreamin sure all OC reps R sell outs 4 not shutting down gov. by focusing negativity on GOP reps U r doing Obama‚Äôs dirty work
@mpchc1 good discussion with U
@OCTeaPartyBlog wrong,we specifically voted to defund PP, then we voted 4 bill with no designated $ 4 PP but prevented gov shut down
@MailOsta I agree
@MailOsta hopefully the American people &amp; their leaders can be convinced that cooperation with Russia is in our mutual interest
@mpchc1 I do what I believe to be right...same with you. Too many R only playing politics or calling names rather than exploring issues
@MailOsta it‚Äôs NUTS. Am leaders complain Putin backs a thug gov that is killing terrorists who murder Christians &amp;want to kill us.
@sugarcone4 those definitions would have to be part of any law passed. For example it might include anyone taking certain psych drugs
@atlauren enjoyed our discussion bye bye
@madeinhb sorry I don‚Äôt get Ur point but it has been a good discussion. Bye bye
@atlauren sorry don‚Äôt get Ur point
@sugarcone4 a national ‚Äúno gun sale to‚Äù list of convicted felons &amp; mentally disturbed people would make it crime to sell to anyone on list
@mpchc1 my job: let U know how &amp; Y  I vote. Ur job:vote me out if U oppose my stands. My open dialogue rare &amp; no excuse 4 personal abuse.
@madeinhb Ur personal attack is way out of line. My position on guns based on rational analysis that  armed honest citizens deter criminals
@madeinhb no but there R criminals who will feel more secure in attacking people in their homes of the gov takes away their guns.
@atlauren someday u‚Äôll realize U are not thwarted by a lobby, but by fellow citizens who won‚Äôt give up their ability to defend themselves
@mpchc1 Do Ur talking points say to make personal jab claiming someone disagreeing must be using talking points
@mpchc1 U would use limited gov $ sending police into honest citizens homes to count guns rather than focus on criminals&amp; gangs
@mpchc1 then putup Ur sign; no guns here. If U don‚Äôt U R admitting unarmed citizens more likely to be robbed or attacked thus more violence
@atlauren that should be left 2 state &amp; local gov. If simply a cover for preventing people from owning fire arms it is unconstitutional
@mpchc1 bad guys R criminals who would love 2 see their victims disarmed. Also on list: mentally disturbed people taking psych related drugs
@atlauren it isn‚Äôt imperfection. A policy of taking guns from honest people results in more violence not less, the basic strategy is wrong
@mpchc1 so tough luck if U can‚Äôt afford a big dog . U believe disarming others wlll not make them vulnerable yet U hide that Ur not armed
@mpchc1 I did not agree with RR on everything, but his focus was on controlling criminals not honest citizens.
@KateFangman sure, and when our fed bureaucrats fail, U‚Äôll tell us we must have controls enforced by the UN,
@Crossbearer1956 Webster is a good man &amp; a fine Congressman, but he has only been around a short time
@JasennZaejian wrong, bill aimed at defining GMO so labeling makes sense. Constitution gives fed gov task of defining weights&amp;messures
@atlauren OK take Chicago which has strict gun laws vs Houston. Which has more violent crime?
@mpchc1 it suggests if U really believe having a gun doesn‚Äôt deter criminals U should notify them with a sign on Ur door that U have no gun
@mpchc1 U‚Äôd register good guys I‚Äôd list bad guys. My only demand of good guys is don‚Äôt sell guns to bad guys on the don‚Äôt sell to list
@MailOsta the Americans who run various Intel agencies may be incompetent but they aren‚Äôt traitors to the American people
@MailOsta 9-11 worst intelligence failure in US history reflected massive bureaucracy now undermining America‚Äôs ability to get anything done
@Gatortrapper that U ignored that I am on Twitter &amp; direct dialogue with my voters &amp; others, U don‚Äôt need to clutter my Twitter
@Youngpatriotcat there is dramatic need changes in law&amp; policy. Constitution requires Prez signature or  two thirds vote.
@mpchc1 after 9-11 I didn‚Äôt vote to eliminate privacy give gov right to spy on honest people, guess you support the so-called patriot act
@mpchc1 Do U have a ‚Äú no guns here‚Äù sign on your door?
@Gatortrapper so a Congressman who engages in direct dialogue over Twitter resents being questioned by constituents?
@mpchc1 we disagree on the fundamental: restricting criminals is justified, restrictions on honest people  is not.
@mericanrefugee he is a great patriot, but he hasn‚Äôt been in Congress long enough to understand the system or the players
@mpchc1 with so many criminals &amp; psychos around why do U keep focusing Ur efforts on Controling honest people?
@atlauren sure, gun laws in Chicago &amp; DC &amp; LA have made it safe for honest people. That is nonsense
@atlauren such legislation would start in judiciary cmtee, so it would be best to be introduced by a member of that cmtee
@atlauren when honest people carry guns there is less crime and fewer murders. Focus gun control on criminals &amp; psychos &amp; I will support it
@atlauren I would support such legislation. I‚Äôve got other issues on which I am playing a lead role.
@mpchc1 a do not sell to list of those convicted felons not an invasion of their lives by gov. life details of honest citizens not justified
@atlauren he was right more often than most &amp; often misrepresented.
@atlauren we don‚Äôt need to do background checks on everyone, just put the felons &amp; psych drug takers on a no sale list
@mpchc1 a fed list of felon &amp; takers of meds with psych impact could mandate no sales to these people
@atlauren list all felons &amp; takers of meds that have psych impact, leave everybody else alone
@mpchc1 I support federal listing of felons &amp; those taking drugs with possible psyc impact. That could be a can‚Äôt buy a gun list.
@soxsher Webster is new &amp; just now getting 2 know Washington &amp; how Congress works or doesn‚Äôt work, a fine Congressman not ready 2 be Speaker
@MarkLevinParrot when I see one who has any chance of winning you can bet I will support him
@atlauren because I don‚Äôt believe in disarming honest citizens, which would put them at the mercy of crooks, tyrants &amp; terrorists
@MarkLevinParrot that is the point. There are in a number of accomplished conservatives, if they run I will support them
@atlauren it would take a change in the Constitution that would permit the government to restrict honest people from owning firearms
@cindiperez48 what issues has he championed?
@MarkLevinParrot then who is your candidate? Yes, there is major frustration when the constitution grants power to a President who is so bad
@ArtistCal If Tom wants it I will support him with my max effort, but he doesn‚Äôt want it &amp; neither do I.
@mpchc1 how many more women would be murdered if criminals knew they were disarmed. Do you have a ‚Äúno guns here‚Äù sign on Ur door?
@not_that_actor sure, &amp; world reached peak oil 15 yrs ago. Baloney
@jsmithOC who is it that U find acceptable who wants the job? Or R U just blowing off steam
@MeerZaibBaloch1 yes SHAME US arms PAK military who make A-bombs &amp; slaughter innocent Baloch to steal their wealth &amp; give it to China
@MeerZaibBaloch1 I‚Äôve  struggled alert Congress to murderous PAK repression of Baloch &amp; others, They have averted a Cong hearing so far
I will be introducing a bill on the floor of congress aimed at protecting Christians from genocide in the Middle East.
@LibbyHuyck I will vote 4 any bill defunding PP, but I will not vote against a bill simply because it does not address the issue
@kevinjcoleman7 so U get Ur information from a magazine that gets its $ by selling sex ads. The story is a lie and typical of the OC weekly
@ArtistCal who do U have on mind for the job?
@HellerExposed I‚Äôm suspicious of repeated claims that large number agree with them. Say, doesn‚Äôt Aussie ruling party agree with GOP?
@eachus I enjoy an energetic exchange of views. Sometimes that openness is abused or exploited by fanatics. It goes with the territory
@chimdiya1 I don‚Äôt have enough information about Ur cause to endorse or condemn it
@412V70  U &amp; dumb scientist seem frantic to engage me in multiple elongated discussions. I‚Äôm going to use this space &amp; time 4 other folks
@412V70 yes that is pretty funny. You guys have a good night it‚Äôs time to go to bed
@DumbSci pardon me, did I accuse U of lying or claim U parroting someone‚Äôs points rather than using Ur own logic?
@412V70 you don‚Äôt think suggesting that someone who disagrees with you is basing that disagreement on talking points is a personal jab?
@DumbSci my,my U like to jump into all kinds of discussions.
@DumbSci I appreciate U countering my point with info.The talking point comment was a personal jab typical of AGW advocates&amp;not appreciated
@SpacerockDodger Will to my best to get the job done before this job gets done with me
@Trockenholz the Senator &amp; I are not on speaking terms
@chimdiya1 all people have right to self determination. No one should feel enslaved by borders established by 19th century Colonial powers
@SpacerockDodger mankind unprepared to deal with the ultimate threat to all life on earth, a huge space  rock. U.S. should lead effort
@DumbSci I still remember the sincere advocates of Global Cooling back in the 70s. Russian scientists still believe long term cooling cycle
@Trockenholz thanks for compliment but I am content being a voice in the debate of important issues rather than the custodian of power
@Trockenholz thanks for the good thoughts.
@sixfootfour20 I will continue to do my best to make it happen, but don‚Äôt count on my success
@Trockenholz I speak what I believe to be truth to anyone who wants to interview me. Reagan taught me that.
@Sovereign_CA all people have right to intros their own destiny through an honest referendum, includes inh Calif
@DumbSci actually Chris Beale made that point after I noted stats U used only went back to 1979. Neal then challenged Ur basic proposition
@DumbSci I thought U were suggesting that, or at least that‚Äôs what you said, so I thought I‚Äôd make the discussion a little less intense
@brianhund I like your puns.
@DumbSci actually, the intervention in our discussion by people more educated in these matters than I eviscerated your argument.
@brianhund now your talking like a patriot
@brianhund think tolerating views U disagree with is a prerequisite for maintaining a free country.
@DumbSci yep, agree 2 disagree,been wonderful discussion. Appreciate both sides, but how could Greenland been hotter before man made CO2?
@brianhund booing is not courteous to other regular people, much less the Pope.
@sixfootfour20 1940 waiting cmtee action before getting full House vote. The states right med marj amendment looks like will remain law
@butte_tocks I have not supported non-military USA to Isreal.
@NJSnowFan so Those claiming an ominous trend of arctic ice loss due to Man made CO2 only have stats going back to 1979. Thanks 4 insight
@DumbSci hard to forget shipload of GWarming advocates out to prove ice melt who ended up trapped in ice,even rescue ship iced in
@HellerExposed interesting, U send report saying as of 2012 ice retreating. What about last three years?Is there  major ice cap expansion?
@MailOsta apparently this story was inaccurate.
@MailOsta American foreign-policy is enough to make one believe in reincarnation. That is no one could get that stupid in one lifetime
@NJSnowFan thanks for the tip off
@MailOsta never blame conspiracy what can be explained by incompetence or stupidity
@HellerExposed who said this is a debate? I‚Äôm just expressing my views and having discussions
@MailOsta everything is not a conspiracy. Sometimes reality just sucks
@not_that_actor read Ur material. Agreed with most of it
@HellerExposed how about answering  some of my challenges instead of throwing out prestigious names &amp; asking Y I don‚Äôt totally believe them
@HellerExposed read it. Classic example of changing methodology till U get what you want.
@DumbSci untrue like claiming no polar ice cap by now? Or claiming more hurricanes? Or baseline at end of 300 yr decline to show temp rise
@HellerExposed method of calculating temp changed so 15 yrs of no increase disappears like a Hockey stick &amp; expanding ice caps ignored=fraud
@HellerExposed when even more predictions based on man made CO2 theory fail to materialize lib professors will ignore it, but I won‚Äôt
@suvirsaran U R blanking out what U don‚Äôt want to see.The wave of indignation sweeping Am is a result of the sale of specified body parts
@suvirsaran U heard no mention of any human body part or organ? No description of removing the little body in way to keep body parts intact
@TheVeni1 have him call my staffer Scott at 202-226-5071
@barbaramccarren what will kill artistic freedom in our country is getting gov involved deciding who and what will be financed or subsidized
@suvirsaran guess U haven‚Äôt seen videos of PParenthood execs talking about delivering specific human body parts.
@barbaramccarren if U don‚Äôt like me base it on fact not on false claim repeated by publication that makes its $ on sex ads. Not a good find
@TheVeni1 it will be fixed when we have a new president who will not appoint such people.
@TheVeni1 VOA has a tarnished history of employing unacceptable advocates of anti-American regimes &amp; ideologies in the name of diversity
@quimsb I can‚Äôt speak for Obama
@412V70 how about looking North &amp; seeing the ice caps, not disappearing as predicted by world recognized AGW advocates, but expanding
@mcavero my basic belief in self determination is clear. Argue Ur constitution with fellow Spaniards
@jaimegarciabo we disagree on whether constitutional procedures are more important than natural law.
@jaimegarciabo good comeback, but wrong these people have every right to advocate how Spain should solve the issue through an election
@mcavero Czechs &amp; Slovaks showed what to do. British &amp; Scots showed how to approach the issue &amp; determine it consistent with Democracy
@RickWoollams U ignore argument of those who disagree, thus they must have better case cause U R just calling names not refuting arguments
@HellerExposed have followed up on several claims and found them baseless, maybe others are more accurate, but I doubt it
@jaimegarciabo Expressing my opinion cost taxpayers nothing. glad 2 hear u support my efforts 2 cut fed spending,which has earned me awards
@mcavero our declaration proclaims God gave right to all people to determine their destiny.
@mcavero our founding fathers had a different standard.
@mcavero Declaration of Independence more important than constitution in determining a people‚Äôs right to self determination
@RickWoollams I think any advocate who keeps claiming how many others agree does‚Äôt have a good factual or logical case to make
@jaimegarciabo how about reading the Declaration  of Independence
@BarnesBryan that was my vote
@DumbSci many prominent scientists disagree with U &amp;AGW theory.Y? No temp jump, ice caps now expanding, disappearing hockey stick,ect,ect
@DumbSci yes there R lying fanatics who push AGW theory. There R also serious intelligent advocates who I respect but with whom I disagree
@jaime_corner if Texans want 2 vote if they stay in union they should be given right to vote &amp; outcome of vote should determine status
@RickWoollams how do U think those many scientists who disagree with Man made CO2 creates Global warming theory came to their conclusions
@_Nikator_ marriage should be left to church, IF gov involved it should reflect values of people.Gays can call themselves whatever they want
@menara2408 yes, if majority of people in any state vote to leave USA they right to vote &amp; leave if they choose
@cansoprano he can laugh, I can express my belief in self determination. I do not pretend my views same as the rest of the U.S. Congress
@jaimegarciabo if majority want to leave we should let them go
@mcavero our Declaration of Indepence makes it clear all people have right of self determination
@javiotondo of course.
@ShaktiviryatY so show me that as part of a study and I will consider the point
@formerjetjock thanks for backing us up. Patriots are in this together, as it has been since 1776
@MANX38 core issue: human baby or a piece of tissue(like a tumor.) the debate flows from that. good people can disagree.wish U well
@DumbSci numerous prominent scientists who disagree R more qualified than me. I‚Äôd be happy to debate Al Gore, but he won‚Äôt do public debate
@tastemongerchef I am grateful for the blessings of here &amp; now. My daughter was recently cured of  leukemia in 50s she would be dead
@MANX38 nice back &amp; forth with you.
@RickWoollams perhaps AGW advocates,rather than denigrate many prominent opposing scientists, should agree to debates &amp; answer challenges
@MANX38 so I believe unless one supports a bureaucratic gov run program to control us one does not care about less fortunate people.
@MANX38 yes, I want laws that prevent the termination of yet-to-be born babies, except when mother‚Äôs life on danger.
@RickWoollams why do so many AGW advocates tout support from organizations rather than make case that CO2 caused planet to warm?
@tastemongerchef so illegals R not bidding down wages? They R taking any jobs that otherwise would pay more &amp; go to a U.S. Citizen?
@tastemongerchef No lumping. If 1 American is saved from rape or murder, if 1 family provider‚Äôs job is saved, illegals should not be here
@MANX38 Broken homes, substance abuse, many causes for plight of less fortunate children but not that their life was not terminated
@Matthew_Kupfer I actually have written lots of songs and several screen plays.
@tastemongerchef so U deny illegals take Jobs  &amp; that there R illegals committing crimes here that would not happen if they were not here.
@tastemongerchef wrong, more waiting to adopt baby than there are babies available
@MANX38 false, there‚Äôs long waiting list 4 those wanting to adopt a baby.thus no excuse for terminating a yet-to-be born baby‚Äôs life
@Mark_Brooks been no 2% jump in global temp! Man made or otherwise for this fraud starts in final years of 300 yr decline in temp.
@williaminxs Bill has an audience who is treated like Pavlof‚Äôs dog to applaud &amp; laugh when a sign flashes. Rest of guests on their own
@Mark_Brooks U ignore all arguments made by those many scientists who reject theory that man made CO2 is overriding Earth‚Äôs natural cycles
@Matthew_Kupfer yep, in my college days he was one of my heroes.
@tastemongerchef it takes a jingoistic bigot to claim those who disagree are jingoistic bigots
@tastemongerchef this totally false argument is no excuse 4 abortion. There is a long line waiting to adopt younger children.
@tastemongerchef freedom does not include killing one‚Äôs child. Real question is when unborn entity deserves 2 be treated as an unborn baby
@Mark_Brooks changes in global temp have been constant &amp; forever. CO2 has had little to do with these cycles as compared 2 solar activity
@Mark_Brooks yes, 20 yrs ago we were told CO2 would soon cause major jump in Global temp. It never happened cause CO2 theory bogus
@MANX38 got to go. Will continue later. Ur questions thoughtful and provocative.
@MailOsta my thoughts different than US policy. Assad could be part of effort to defeat Rad Islamic terrorists. Removing Saddam mistake
@MANX38 just remember the majority of babies being aborted by PP are children of color. Yes, there should be other alternatives for mothers
@MANX38 thank U 4 respectful discussion.I am sincere &amp; U R too. I remember early sonograms of my children, especially the tiny heart beat.
@MANX38 Glad to hear that once a HUMAN fetus has reached a certain stage U would outlaw killing it even if derived from rape.
@MailOsta I am surprised but I if they are assisting forces opposed to Islamic State then we should applaud not complain
@JamesTMcCarthy that is one reason I raise considerably less in campaign donations than most members of Congress
@Mark_Brooks many drugs &amp; chemicals could help general health by adding them 2 water supply thus force feeding public=destroys freedom
@MANX38 can I ask you a direct question? Do you believe in abortions open till the moment of birth? If not when do you draw the line?
@MANX38 this is core issue:at which moment is it human life? I respect those who insist not till birth, but, with 3 kids, I must disagree.
@MANX38 how about caring for such a baby after it is born? Would U permit the extermination of such a baby because it is product of rape?
@MANX38 U may speak 4 Urself, but it is beyond arrogant to demand the kind answer U want. Honest &amp; good people disagree on this issue
@Mark_Brooks if he is so famous why did those claiming 97% believe they could get away with misrepresenting his position? Arrogance I guess
@MANX38 U don‚Äôt dictate answers.Moral people oppose killing babies whether after they are born or before, no matter how conceived.
@Mark_Brooks Ur high standards in form hopeful is accompanied with a high commitment to substance. Sometimes I‚Äôm loose on form
@MANX38 can‚Äôt answer? If a minute after birth we would not want it killed, so too before it is born we wouldn‚Äôt want it killed
@Fieryreddragon that is correct. It is why employers who hire illegals should face legal action of some kind
@cjcmichel the group was called ‚ÄúThe Patriots Four‚Äù after election became ‚ÄúThe Blue Bay Trio‚Äù played at some bars and parties
@OverviewJohn appreciate hearing from someone who agreed. It seems like only the pro abortion crowd takes the time to comment
@TertleKatie editing to ensure flow part of all videos. No attempt to mislead or alter the meaning of what PP execs readily admitted.
@funnicegoodkind thought O made a few good points.
@TertleKatie have no idea what U R talking about
@MarcVegan thanks for sending on that very enlightening discussion. Please send it to as many others as U can
@JamesTMcCarthy working, making $ , is good for everybody except illegal immigrants. Sorry, they R lower on my priority list than Americans
@fullofbalogna sorry U R so full of hate for USA that U fail to notice that people struggle to get here which indicates  U R dead wrong
@fullofbalogna children can go back to home country with parent if parent is here illegally. Parent is responsible 4 that situation
@CATS_PAWS happy to discuss specific issue of disagreement but U don‚Äôt seem to be able to channel Ur rage into a reasonable discussion
@dongstreth that was a really intelligent thing to say.
@_Molon_Labe_ The obvious reason is that it takes a two thirds vote to override a presidential veto.
@CATS_PAWS U use word liar not me. Some can be wrong &amp; not be a liar. However, fanatics have to vilify all those who disagree as liars
@CATS_PAWS so how can U support bringing millions more poor illegals into USA consuming all the Ed &amp; Healthcare $
@CATS_PAWS dem response bring millions of illegals into our country let them consume the limited health &amp; education $ available 4 Americans
@Youngpatriotcat how about reminding me with a tweet next Wednesday
@MailOsta not good to be so vulgar. unR intelligent use tough words not insulting words
@JamesTMcCarthy entry level jobs once went to US teens. Now illegals take jobs keep wages low.
@JamesTMcCarthy prisoners can pick fruits &amp; veggies &amp; get paid, some going to restitution. When freed prisoner has work ethic &amp; some $
@HaiwtanBaloch the world is paying attention to other evils so Pakistan‚Äôs slaughter &amp; subjugation of Baloch is relatively unnoticed.
@CATS_PAWS I try my best to follow the message of Jesus &amp; part of that is not judging others. Better to argue rightness of ideas or policies
@_Molon_Labe_ well, thanks. Ur apology restored my faith in tweet land &amp; ,of course, it is always nice to be appreciated.
@JamesTMcCarthy correct, again!
@JamesTMcCarthy correct!
@Youngpatriotcat sounds good. will look at it
@chateu21 this is a blatant inconsistency for many Republicans. The Democrats have heir share of contradictions as well
@irenepamela I am voting &amp; speaking that way
@HaiwtanBaloch Baloch people victims of brutal oppression by both PAK gov &amp; Iranian Mullah regime. Free &amp; honest people support Baloch cause
@CATS_PAWS we have fundamental different view of the world.
@not_that_actor hey pretty wild bunch of people on the Internet these days.
@JHVI1 poison mind comes from fanaticism be it religious or even anti-religious
@CATS_PAWS Ur criticism about supporting Bush war on Iraq is somewhat justified
@fullofbalogna The USA takes in more legal immigration than all other countries of the world combined. That is generosity. No apology needed
@CATS_PAWS yes you certainly belittle the fear of empowering gov at the expense of personal freedom and individual rights.
@MichaelBrowne33 very cool answer. Hope U have a terrific week...after that you‚Äôre on your own.
@412V70 thanks 4 taking challenge of arguing Ur case rather than personal attacks, which is standard procedure 4 most AGW advocates
@DistantOcean there have been cycles, droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, moving glaciers &amp; ice caps, hot spells&amp;cold ones long before humans
@mpchc1 When U say act does that mean taking away guns from honest people who then would be at the mercy of the fellows who shot that cop?
@fullofbalogna why do you always have to attack the person rather than debate the issue?
@SkepticPugilist Y only fluoride? Let‚Äôs add vitamins or how about an energy enhancer, or even adative that calms nerves
@fullofbalogna Ur source is rag that gets revenue by publishing  sex ads. I receive less campaign donations than almost all my colleagues
@indistarr I think giving gov power to do tasks that not essential for gov to do, in the long run puts our freedom at risk
@412V70 when prediction based on CO2 theory fail that means theory wrong.
@lowetze1 sometime no. I support ‚ÄúFree trade between free people‚Äùotherwise only benefit 2 our crony capitalists &amp; foreign despotic cliques
@lowetze1 agreed
@lowetze1 agreed
@indistarr fine if Aussies want gov to have power to add chemical or Meds rather than just providing basic pure water, that‚Äôs their option
@DimeStoreNinja that was creative but not substantive. What position do I take on what issue that U object to?The rest is name calling
@noreallyhowcome what a cliche. So anyone who disagrees with U is just doing the bidding of insidious backers. How about arguing issues
@lowetze1 US workers betrayed by Dems &amp; unions opposing efforts 2 halt invasion of our country by those taking our jobs &amp; bidding down wages
@DistantOcean Baloney it was stated &amp; restated that the claim was 97% of all scientists. This kind of fraud is what altered us to be suspect
@DistantOcean all I know is he says he was misrepresented, that he did not support conclusions of IPCC report
@n8r0n74 if a podiatrist tells me something that doesn‚Äôt make sense, i‚Äô i‚Äôm not going to let him cut off my toe.
@Wind2Energy I generally mention that I am an Eagle Scout at Eagle Scout presentation because it seems to fit, never had any complaints
@412V70
@RotatingHead so U R for chemicals &amp; Meds to be put into our water &amp; food by gov for our own good. Where do you stand on GMOs &amp; gultan ?
@theKimansta I am on recorded fighting a lot of bad stuff, including stuff you think is bad stuff
@theKimansta thanks 4 pleasant response. scare tactics so often used to justify all kinds of gov misconduct &amp; controls I am indeed a skeptic
@DimeStoreNinja go ahead, accept principle gov can  medicate Ur water(&amp;food) with chemicals 2 achieve social goals, tooth decay or whatever
@ParadisTweets You got it wrong. God,not gov,gave us our rights. The constitution simply recognizes fundamental acts of privilege as rights
@ParadisTweets a right is a privilege that can‚Äôt be taken away because it is granted by constitution.
@PisseArtiste really which things do U disagree with and why. Start with most recent accomplishment: leading fight to legalize med marijuana
@theKimansta well, then blame lib/left Democrats. They have controlled re districting in California
@gordonrios had trouble getting it could U send it again, thanks
@theKimansta R U sure U‚Äôve actually taken a look at my record. Got lots I‚Äôm proud of, even when I knew it would get people angry at me
@sreddi_515 U pitty my staff...I pity those who don‚Äôt  know enough 2 counter arguments they disagree with so they have to hit the person
@theKimansta I‚Äôve been hearing that from arrogant liberal/leftists for 28 year.
@TheJaredSkye if only one American is murdered by someone not in our country legally, that is one too many and justifies removing illegals
@RotatingHead that really wasn‚Äôt a very creative dig
@DistantOcean the fraud is the repeated claim 97% of  ALL scientists agree. Even the claim for all authors of a selected group is suspect
@DickeyFuller no, Reps want education run at the local, state&amp; parental level, The people Can decide how much to fund local schools
@KevinMcReynold2 oops U were looking into a mirror when U said that
@guner1357 being attacked for demanding water system should strive 4 pure water &amp; NOT add chemicals claimed to have positive health impact
@mike_stark why can‚Äôt U be accurate &amp; not claim the mujahideen was the Taliban
@mike_stark that is my work with mujahideen, which later, with my support became the Northern Alliance who defeated the Taliban
@n0strildamus what are you referring to?
@wubster I hope U understand honest people can disagree.Some people R compelled 2 claim anyone who disagrees is being paid off. that‚Äôs 2 bad
@cesiumcs fine, you want the government to be able to put chemicals in your body how trusting of you
@jt_home maybe you have missed several major international conferences on global warming
@jebocanegra1 no lies, everything besides abortion availed in other clinics this PP is only about abortion.
@gordonrios we waste billions on drug war that can‚Äôt be won &amp; makes things worse. Little enforcement on employers&amp; gov benefits 4 illegals
@jebocanegra1 the pattern U just used demonstrates the point: Lots of attack but not one issue hit, just person hit which takes no knowledge
@sueday1970 R U deaf. I just complimented Bernie on the air &amp; in a tweet. U must be upset liberals&amp;fascism=same economic structure
@neurosophical there R unstable people in this world &amp; if they R unstable enough to be prescribed certain drugs, best they can‚Äôt buy guns
@BalochukKohi the Baloch people are being repressed,murdered&amp; robbed by PAK gov. There will be a Congressional hearing exposing this crime
@MichaelBrowne33 OK that is certainly an honest response
@sueday1970 fascism is a form of socialism. In fact modern liberalism is fascism minus the flags&amp; boots
@Newsericks services planned parenthood provides R available 2 all at community clinics, except abortion, so only reason 4 them is abortion
@Newsericks 9,000 community clinics service poor without insurance, thousands of other hospitals serve rest of population.
@fullofbalogna putting chemicals into our public water supply to protect our teeth is an example of gov protecting us at expense of freedom
@fullofbalogna I agree with that Pelosi, Sanders and others R good people with whom I happen to disagree
@gordonrios disagree with Ur assessment on this one
@tonydunc so everything deemed as a problem become reason for more bureaucracy, more mandates, more controls, more regulation enforcers
@MichaelBrowne33 how profound. So Not knowing enough to combat any idea I expressed, U tell mr to look into a mirror
@jebocanegra1 the really dumb people don‚Äôt know enough to criticize someone‚Äôs ideas so instead make personal attacks
@Newsericks only purpose of planned parenthood is abortion, 9000 community clinics provide everything else.
@Newsericks U missed central fact. 9,000 community clinics service more of women‚Äôs special needs, except abortions, than planned parenthood
@Newsericks Obama justice Dept.will not enforce laws they don‚Äôt like against people they do like. They like Abortionists selling body parts
@fullofbalogna claiming Global Warming they create powerful Global gov. Claiming tooth decay they mandate chemical fluoride in our water
@fullofbalogna Ur freedom will be taken to protect U.Mandating seat belts led to laws making it a crime not 2 wear Ur seat belt.
@fullofbalogna you made a good point
@DeaconessBlues glad U‚Äôve been spared the negative community impact of massive  flow of impoverished people into our country.
@RosielLauritzen it is same. Massive influx of cheap labor has hurt Am working people
@gordonrios whatever other negative factors, massive inflow of cheap labor has made it even worse for working Americans
@RosielLauritzen trade policy that I (and Trump too) oppose gives US approval &amp; incentives to do business in China
@mpchc1 I mowed lawn and did other chores.
@jaythebeastman community clinics 4 those without insurance. Most Am women have private insurance thus don‚Äôt go to these community clinics
@Newsericks community clinics offer more women‚Äôs services, but not abortions, that really what planned parenthood all about, aborting babies
@dancingbeanbob Even when We disagree Bill is creative &amp; funny.
@RosielLauritzen right!
@MissTanya if one believes an abortion is the killing of an unborn baby, do U believe anyone has right to kill a child?
@MissTanya I ‚ù§Ô∏èMexico &amp; it‚Äôs people. They &amp; everybody else should respect our laws when &amp; if they come here as we should respect theirs
@MichaelBrowne33 U obviously know nothing about the policies I advocate
@fullofbalogna some Republicans don‚Äôt believe in individual freedom, others do, Democrat basic belief:doing good through more Gov control
@RosielLauritzen if illegals not here corps would have to pay more for labor.
@gordonrios resentment result of working Americans seeing wages bid down &amp; jobs taken, schools &amp; hospitals overcrowded clearly by illegals
@RosielLauritzen foreigners here illegally bid down wages, take entry level jobs, consume limited Health &amp; Ed $= hurts average Am
@RosielLauritzen correct!
@gordonrios I agree
@gordonrios first &amp; foremost decisions should be in interest of Am people, not illegals who take jobs&amp; bid down wages, consume health&amp;Ed $
@RosielLauritzen criminals punished then deported, but no general deportation. Just deny jobs &amp; gov Ed &amp; med benefits=illegals will leave
@RosielLauritzen which lie? WMDs  not there. Freeing people from bloody Saddam didn‚Äôt work. Mistake to follow Bush into the Abyss
@DumbSci sorry, I‚Äôm trying to handling too many tweet debates at once.
@gordonrios sorry, my commitment is 2 Americans, whatever their race, religion, ethnic or jobs. Lib/left  betrayal of Am people now rejected
@RosielLauritzen I agree. also agree US drug war fueled organized crime here &amp; in nearby countries, spurring illegal immigration from there
@RosielLauritzen if perpetrator of crime here illegally. That murder, rape or robbery would not have taken place. Reason enough 2get tougher
@gordonrios I haven‚Äôt defended Trump. I civilly oppose foreigners here illegally taking jobs &amp; consuming limited Education &amp; healthcare$
@gordonrios if some here illegally murders or rapes an American it would not have happen if he would have not been here.
@gordonrios immigration policy should be based on what is good for the Am people(who R every race, religion &amp; ethnic group).
@ODeeCS I made no such claim but Ur assumption 2 the contrary reflects on U not on those with whom U disagree, many of whom R honest&amp;moral
@fullofbalogna do U always feel compelled to personally attack those who disagree? How do U know much I have worked?
@fullofbalogna Republicans no more hypocritical than others so just try to decide based on policies being advocated.
@DumbSci the Russian scientists  may have mishandled their disagreement with the IPCC conclusions about Man made Global Warming theory
@ODeeCS do U think it is possible that an honest &amp; moral person can disagree with U? So why attack the person rather than the policy
@gordonrios Latino Americans oppose amnesty 4 illegals just like all other working class US citizens...&amp; legal immigrants also oppose
@gordonrios only race baiting is amnesty advocates coupling illegals with legal immigrants, and interchanging ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù with immigrant.
@gordonrios guess Ur mind so closed that U missed my agreement with Bill about Trump on several significant counts
Russians, kept out of discussions of Kyto Protocol because they disagreed &amp; were misrepresented, like Botkin &amp; Vongraven.
Scientists Dr Richard Tol , Dr. Nor Shaviv, Dr. Nicola Scafetta among many misrepresented as supporting IPCC AGW conclusions part of 97%lie
Prez of Rus Acad Sci, Yuri Osipov, met me yrs ago expressed opposition to AGW, as did several other RAS scientists, contrary 2 IPCC report
@Goldinhart those 9000 Tronics wouldn‚Äôt exists if we as Americans didn‚Äôt care
@Goldinhart 9,000 community clinics over free healthcare to our poorest citizens, including women but don‚Äôt provide abortions
@Goldinhart taxpayers are already paying millions of dollars for community health clinics that offer all services to women except abortion
@mpchc1 that‚Äôs BS, U can‚Äôt claim an office holder U disagree with sells his vote &amp; then reject being called to task for name calling
@mpchc1  Y not lecture U on name calling? U start out claiming those who disagree with U R bough arts ff
@tufkaa those who would reignite the cold war label anyone who opposes their hostile policies as being pro Putin.
@mpchc1 If U do not respect that honest &amp; thoughtful people can disagree with you there‚Äôs no sense in communicating with you
@mpchc1 yes, Trump is both insulting and arrogant
@mpchc1 Ur first concern should be improving Urself B4 preaching to us. Starting off with an insult is both arrogant and counterproductive
@mpchc1 yep, U want to treat all as if they R killers. U would make all law abiding people vulnerable to criminals who wouldn‚Äôt obey law
@DumbSci many complaints from respected scientists who can‚Äôt get research grants because they disagree with man made global warming theory
@motinka all prisoners on both sides should be returned and a truce should be proclaimed &amp; respected.
@mpchc1 take away guns from honest people and honest people will have to live in fortified apartment buildings
@DumbSci at times fanatics have impacted various gov agencies. For a long time research that might disprove AGW has been trash canned
@timreckmeyer U believe all the apocalyptic predictions.
@DumbSci I respect that many advocates of AGW theory R sincere &amp; honest...fanaticism of some evident by claims 97% of scientists support
@timreckmeyer yes, based on man made CO2 theory we heard Predictions of major jump in temp. It didn‚Äôt happen cause theory is wrong.
@DumbSci tthousands of scientists don‚Äôt agree man made  CO2 cause of current warming cycle, some don‚Äôt even believe earth in warming cycle
@DumbSci oh yes, &amp; 97% all scientists agree with U. Baloney. Cycles reflect massive impact of Solar activity, not microscopic level of CO2
@timreckmeyer earth‚Äôs climate constantly changing 4 millions of years. The question is whether or not today‚Äôs change due to man-made CO2
@caerbannog666 R U &amp; callinglikeitis buddies? Seeing U guys take personally criticism of GWarming theory no need 2 upset U more. Goodnight
@CallingLikeItIs OK I get it now. Because I‚Äôve derided bogus GWarming claims U take it personally. am I threatening Ur livelihood?
@caerbannog666 that is Better than calling him a liar
@sugarcone4 let‚Äôs see, didn‚Äôt NASA‚Äôs top scientist put out a graph that eliminated any indication of the mini Ice Age? So some good some bad
@DumbSci the 97% claim &amp; use of words like denier part of an arrogant suppression of honest debate.
@caerbannog666 R U one of the guys who claim that Global Temp not flat cause it went up a hundredth of a degree,even Hansen rejected that
@DumbSci if Someone promotes the arrogant lie that 97% of all scientists agree with AGW theory, then I guess that person lacks credibility
@caerbannog666 sorry I don‚Äôt believe the temp of the planet, which is in constant change, can be measured accurately to justify many claims
@caerbannog666 this wasn‚Äôt one incident.
@caerbannog666 that has been widely reported on. Do Ur own research
@firmgreen thanks for sending me info on Vet legislation. It sounds good to me,but I try to read the fine print before committing.
@DumbSci notice most references R 2 falsity of claim not honesty of the advocate. Even Prez Obama‚Äôs sci advisor refused to defend 97% claim
@DumbSci Will have 2 admit The 97% claim is so brazenly untrue hard not to believe those using it R not knowingly making a false claim
@DumbSci so where is the example of me calling someone a liar? questioning facts &amp; logic is honest disagreement U should try that approach
@DumbSci ok give me the name of the person or persons I have called a liar.
@TamrikoT Am people believe Russia responsible 4 conflict &amp; killing Ukr civilians. don‚Äôt know of Oligrach  army, nor shelling of civilians
@TamrikoT We agree on something‚Äôs but I don‚Äôt support anyone eager reignite Cold War &amp; 2 deploy US troops everywhere. McCain not my favorite
@TamrikoT time when our interests made us enemies is over. No more Cold War, now is time to focus on mutual goals like thwarting rad Islam
@TamrikoT remember WWII started when Soviets partnered with Nazis to carve up Eastern Europe, then allied with Hitler till he attacked them
@TamrikoT see, U get slammed if U question those painting Putin as Hitler, rather than uleader watching out 4 his country‚Äôs interests
@DumbSci R U a high school student?
@eossipov There R people of goodwill trying to get West to focus on federalist type solution rather than Kiev domination by military force
@eossipov Annis solutions similar to others offered by people of goodwill: federal or Canton(Swiss model), with no military ties,Crimea vote
@eossipov Annis video valuable in presenting accurate picture of what is happening in Ukraine. His Marxist views get in way of explanations
@CallingLikeItIs
@CallingLikeItIs recognizing AGW as bogus nothing to do with Russian graphs. Arrogant claims like 97% &amp; failed predictions enough
@caerbannog666 I meet Ru Scientist every visit, trouble digging up names from schedule overseas because arrangements made by State Dept.
@caerbannog666 Russian scientists I spoke to skeptical about AGW, not IPCC research. They had graphs showing world in cooling cycle.
@caerbannog666 as I indicated, in conversations leading Ru scientists told me they endorsed research but not conclusions of IPCC report.
@CallingLikeItIs Not wrong, but even if I was, only Fanatics claim people who believe in what they R advocating R liars if they R wrong.
@CallingLikeItIs I don‚Äôt lose my temper &amp; I don‚Äôt call people who disagree liars. The way U disagree consistent with most GWarming advocates
@CallingLikeItIs U‚Äôve exposed the level discussion to which GWarming advocates sink. Yep, pretty sad labeling some who disagrees a liar.
@caerbannog666 let me get this straight U checked the RAS. U found what U call a AGW skeptic. Did U find any scientists who agreed with U?
@caerbannog666 while waiting 4 my staff to find specific names Y don‚Äôt U google names of Ru Aca members &amp; see their position on AGW
@CallingLikeItIs U won‚Äôt even check if senior Russian scientists buy into AGW theory &amp; use words like lying, how typical of AGW advocates
@CallingLikeItIs AGW advocates claim 97% &amp; all academies of science. The first is obviously BS. Second, U refuse 2 verify when challenged
@CallingLikeItIs U sit there calling names but can‚Äôt get Urself 2 google Ru Academy, find list of leaders &amp; track their position on AGW
@Network_Citizen R U being paid by lib/left to get Republicans to attack each other rather than Obama
@DumbSci Honest people can be wrong or disagree.Ur claim I‚Äôm lying about Ru Academy leaders opposing  AGW indicates more about U than me?
@CallingLikeItIs be skeptical, but check it out yourself. search 4 name of Ru academy member then find out that scientist‚Äôs position on AGW
@DumbSci which Ru scientist did U google?None, cause U know claiming all academies support GWarming theory is as bogus as 97% claim
@fjt452 what city do U live in? R U a constituent? My staff helps people with problems everyday, if they R my constituents
@DumbSci this started when I challenged claim all national academies support GWarming theory,contradicting what Russian scientists told me
@DumbSci I take it that U have googled major figures in Ru Academy of Science &amp; found them in disagreement with HWarming theory.
@DumbSci There R many prominent American Scientists who disagree with GWarming theory. My position derived from their research &amp; analysis.
@BryanKillett oh so U R sending out the same tweet which indicates GWarming  fanatics can‚Äôt think for themselves.
@DumbSci have U spoken 2 anyone  in Ru Academy of science. I have &amp; accurately passed on their belief world in cooling cycle contrary 2 IPCC
@BreeneMurphy CO2 theory basis of predictions 20 yrs ago that have failed.=theory is wrong. Failed Warming predictors now say climate change
@CallingLikeItIs R U a high school student? U don‚Äôt seem to grasp that intelligent &amp; honest people can disagree with U,
@not_that_actor excellent video
@CallingLikeItIs some Russian scientists agree ...others don‚Äôt. Same as in U.S.
@fjt452 I have no idea who U R or what U want.  What city do U live in? R U a constituent? My staff helps many people on my behalf
@CallingLikeItIs Not only is Ur tweet illogical, it‚Äôs intent is saying something negative about me personally. U AGW guys have no shame
@CallingLikeItIs U R really reaching on this onea I
@caerbannog666 In meantime, U google Ru Academy to see if their leaders have published anything on AGW in last ten years.
@TamrikoT too many, here &amp; there, anxious 4 Russia &amp; USA 2 be enemies again. respect &amp; cooperation will uplift us both &amp; make a better world
@caerbannog666 I have numerous meeting per day, especially when overseas. I‚Äôve asked my staff to do a file search for specific names.
@chimdiya1 I will look at your cause. People should determine if they stay in a country via an internationally supervised referendum
@Climate4Rev Is using vulgarity &amp; personal attacks accepted by Global Warming scientists as a means of promoting their theory?
@TamrikoT speaking truth gets people angry at hearing U reject their opinions. Then rather than refute, they get personal &amp; mean.
@caerbannog666 have met top members of Russian Academy on my trips there. They claimed earth in cooling not warming cycle.
@gracielap123 I don‚Äôt like Trump, but reason 4 his high poll numbers is the American people, including hispanics, Totally oppose amnesty
@LiveSwell247 Bolsa Chica, Termilane(in San Diego), San Onfre, however, severe arthritis in my shoulders has made it tough
@not_that_actor the article U sent spends most of its space on personal comments on various players. No discussion of policy.
@Climate4Rev have U ever read any of the many scientists, several of which R Nobel prize winners, who disagree with AGW theory?
@CallingLikeItIs so U have never spoken with any leader of Ru Academy yet U R adamant they did not tell me they disagree with IPCC on AGW
@JuliaDavisNews did U call my press secretary?
@Climate4Rev ever thought of arguing 4 what U believe rather than sounding stupid with some phones bravado about pissing on my grave?
@Climate4Rev hope everybody pays attention 2 Ur approach to defending CO2 based G Warming theory. It defines not only the issue, but who U R
@CallingLikeItIs Who is it U have spoken to in the leadership of the Russian Academy? Have u met anyone in the Russian Academy of science?
@TenneyNaumer Ur insults R so expressive is difficult to determine what U advocate. Guess U‚Äôve got no answer about failed temp predictions
@caerbannog666 oh yes, 1967 was when the science establishment preached global cooling before switching to global warming
@capital_climate sohow come CO2 based temp predictions failed&amp; ice caps R now expanding...wrong again
@LabradorIce when predictions by AGW advocates fail to materialize, I don‚Äôt feel compelled to understand why they believe in a bogus theory
@ahadis1 supported and fought along side mujahideen. Opposed Taliban, after 9-11 worked to mobilize northern alliance to kick Talis out
@shesova it is the $25,000 cash payment U seek that‚Äôs the roadblock. Honoring our merchant Marine heroes is not question.
@Climate4Rev what a joke. You don‚Äôt or forgive, but you can‚Äôt even make your case when confronted with failed predictions &amp; altered stats
@TenneyNaumer more name calling. Shame on you. Notice name callers answer fundamental challenges to AGW theory by personal attacks.
@CallingLikeItIs Sorry U don‚Äôt command what must be discussed in a tweet. U never seem to address challenges 2 Ur core AGW belief.
@Ceist8 notice name calling is so often reply to points I make, verifying often exchanging tweeter views with politicos posing as scientists
@picrene people behind this R ones who notice CO2 minuscule bs solar activity huge influence
@Ceist8 maintaining faith in  a theory when predictions based on it aren‚Äôt happening is fanaticism.
@tonydunc inaccurate predictions indicate basic CO2 theory is wrong. Ice caps now expanding not melting,  no major jump in global temp, ect
@TenneyNaumer guess saying Someone stupid is Ur way of refuting an argument. Who is being stupid in that case?
@CallingLikeItIs an unwillingness to accept that as truth reflects a closed mind &amp; hostility toward those with whom U disagree.
@CallingLikeItIs when I met Ch of Ru Academy he rejected AGW. he claimed his signature on IPCC cover endorsement of research not conclusions
@CallingLikeItIs As senior member of House Foreign Affairs Cmtee I have traveled to Russia numerous times  meeting science leaders
@CallingLikeItIs so have U met with leaders from the Russian Academy? Which ones? Did they tell U they endorsed the conclusions of the IPCC
@caerbannog666 tell me if stratosphere is cooling wouldn‚Äôt that contradiction the predictions that CO2 makes earth warmer, doesn‚Äôt heat rise
@caerbannog666 not being scientist don‚Äôt even know if Ur question based on fact. I can easily see AGW contradictions &amp; failed predictions
@caerbannog666 The earth has always had warming &amp; cooling cycles. The slight warming since end of mini ice age in 1850s no cause for alarm
@CallingLikeItIs There are prominent scientists Who totally disagree with you. some of them are a bit more modest
@CallingLikeItIs I will check out CO2 impact when volcanoes erupt. Thanks  for challenging my correctness with a specific number
@CallingLikeItIs I consider whatever arguments thrown my way. I do not have time to read everybody‚Äôs treatise on why they R right
@mohsinsohailz fine, don‚Äôt take US$ &amp; use it 2 kill Ur own people, support religious extremists &amp; arm terrorists who attack Ur neighbors
@mohsinsohailz US not corrupt free, but not corrupt dominated like PAK. We got problems but No slaughter of ethnic or religious minorities
@CallingLikeItIs sorry, CO2 level so low an increase due 2 humans is irrelevant &amp; often overshadowed by volcanoes &amp; other natural sources
@mohsinsohailz if U don‚Äôt understand corruption in a poor country like Pakistan is evil then U won‚Äôt see why people R so upset with PAK gov
@lordtiberius not in US military like U, but I was in harms way in Vietnam in 67 &amp; in Czechoslovakia in 68 &amp; in Afghan with muj in 80s
@lordtiberius policy disagreement does not excuse vulgarity or personal attacks. Good &amp; intelligent people can disagree.
@lordtiberius U can be proud U served in Iraq. Our leaders, including me, should not have sent U there. Saddam, like Putin, not our enemy
@caerbannog666 at times when there was higher levels of CO2 the earth had an abundance of plant &amp; animal life on land in the oceans
@caerbannog666 how about comparing CO2 to other factors like solar activity. CO2 has minuscule impact Solar activity is a dominating factor
@CallingLikeItIs in the meantime solar activity makes a huge difference in global temp &amp; CO2 has minuscule impact
@CallingLikeItIs Claiming dire consequences if no CO2 is about as relevant as lamenting outcome if Sun goes dark. it ain‚Äôt gonna happen
@CallingLikeItIs understand what? All scientists admit CO2 minuscule part of atmosphere &amp; between most of it natural caused.
@CallingLikeItIs U mean like admitting failure of CO2 based predictions of major tempt jump &amp; irreversible ice cap melting?
@ahadis1 is no anti-PAK lobby, only people who don‚Äôt ignore PAK gov brutal murder of own people, support for terrorist &amp; blatantly corrupt
@ahadis1 face reality. PAK gov gave save haven to Bin Laden &amp; still imprisons Doc who helped US bring justice to this mass murderer.
@lordtiberius you‚Äôre animosity, reflected in your use of a vulgar term, does not lend itself to rational policy decisions
@caerbannog666 as a senior member  of the science committee I have heard firsthand all the global warming predictions from both sides.
@CallingLikeItIs why should I care about a hypothetical that will never happen?
@caerbannog666 As chairman of foreign affairs sub comtee I overseeUS Russia relations. When there I always ask 2 meet Science leaders
@mohsinsohailz wake up! Pak gov recognized around world as corrupt, brutally oppressive &amp; a partner to various terrorist organizations.
@CallingLikeItIs wrong. My reference was minuscule impact of increasing or decreasing current levels not a hypothetical if it didn‚Äôt exist
@CallingLikeItIs so U believe I didn‚Äôt speak to ch of Russian Academy of Science? Or that I am lying or mistaken about what he said to me?
@JuliaDavisNews call my office &amp; ask for my press secretary.
@CallingLikeItIs CO2 so minuscule its impact on global temp minuscule as compared to Solar activity
@JuliaDavisNews Ur negativity &amp; bias R evident by Ur arrogant threats. U may call my press secretary to get answers.
@JuliaDavisNews U may call my press secretary to get all the details
@CallingLikeItIs so U claim less than 1/2 of 10 of 1 percent is not minuscule. And that vast majority of it natural not significant
@JuliaDavisNews U have already proven Urself so bias &amp; inaccurate as to destroy my faith that U have journalistic  standards
@CallingLikeItIs I will eventually track down name 4 U, but sufficent to say several times I met Ch of RU Science Academy who denied AGW
@CallingLikeItIs yes I am trying to sound the alarm that rad enviros R broadcasting false information to justify taking our freedom
@CallingLikeItIs yes, between 5 &amp; 20 percent of the minuscule amount of CO2 in atmosphere is man made rest is naturally occurring
@JuliaDavisNews U repeatedly misrepresented my inadvertent Janocovich assassination tweet so Y detail anything 4 U?
@CallingLikeItIs OK go ahead tell me ice caps R shrinking as so ominously predicted &amp; all the Polar bears are dead
@Rm0786 was mistake 4 US to waste our soldiers lives &amp; $billions to free Iraq people from Saddam‚Äôs bloody dictatorship.
@mohsinsohailz Ur hostility &amp; lack of any appreciation 4 US aid to PAK underscores why PAK gov should not be receiving one penny in U S aid
@JuliaDavisNews ‚Äúhobnobbing‚Äù that must mean those with whom you disagree shouldn‚Äôt be meeting with officials you don‚Äôt like
@JuliaDavisNews I just returned from trip to Minsk, Saint Petersburg &amp; Baltic states.
@mohsinsohailz Ur statement on PAK-bin Laden collusion reconfirms the evil that should not be tolerated, much less subsidized by US aid.
@JuliaDavisNews as I said U claiming I‚Äôm biased is a joke. There is nothing open minded about views U asserted
@lordtiberius China much more oppressive and Rad Islam terrorism more threatening. Need Russia on our side, which won‚Äôt happen unless we try
@lordtiberius the Minsk agreement was a good start toward ending the bloody Ukrainian conflict. It won‚Äôt end by discouraging compromise.
@JuliaDavisNews U claiming I‚Äôm biased undermines any point U might want to make.
@Rm0786 that joke isn‚Äôt funny. PAK gov murders its own people &amp; sends Taliban fighters into Afghan &amp; terrorists into India
@mohsinsohailz PAK gave safe haven to  mass murderer bin Laden, abundant evidence of PAK gov support for terrorism at home &amp; abroad.
@elisatrevino17 US citizens of Hispanic descent oppose amnesty. Illegals take their jobs, bid down wages, use health &amp; Ed $, increase crime
@CallingLikeItIs Ice caps now expanding, no predicted jump in earth temp, peak oil exposed as myth, alteration of temp data exposed
@sugarcone4 August is a bad month cause so many on vacation. End of Sept or in October probably.
@lordtiberius so you believe US should not talk to authoritarian governments even those acting as intermediaries in a conflict like Ukraine
@lordtiberius U guys really want war don‚Äôt you. The Minsk process is one of the few paths to peace in Ukraine &amp; U condemn exploring it
@OhThatCoke should we agree to a deal that results in $150 billion transferred to Mullah regime to finance even more terrorism? No way
@AJWALMINTON I love freedom &amp; the Am people, hate no one,was Pak‚Äôs best friend until they betrayed us &amp; own people by support of terrorists
@AJWALMINTON Wrong, instead of battling Soviets most Taliban were in Madras schools in Pakistan:Taliban means student.
@AJWALMINTON wrong. Muj like Masood, Abdul Hoqu, Rabanni, King Zahir Shah never Taliban. Fought Soviets joined N Alliance 2 drive Talis out
@defencepk OBL always financed by Saudis. They didn‚Äôt need our $. The headline U sent confirms the PAKs were promoting his evil gang.
@AJWALMINTON Afghan Muj I supported not Taliban(which was created by PAKs). Muj who later became Northern Alliance fought the Soviets
@mohsinsohailz PAK ISI partners with terrorists &amp; drug dealers...murders PAKs demanding freedom &amp; honesty...gave  bin Laden safe haven
@alakshya2 I offered amendments to eliminate funds going to Pakistan till they quit supporting terrorism and murdering their own people
@sugarcone4 maybe. August not best time.
@not_that_actor OK enough similar voters gives US another Obama then see how left Supreme Crt can be. Not some but all decisions horrible
@rebel_romantic stopping the bloodletting in Eastern Ukraine through compromise is doable, but instead we opt to build Ukr military.
@not_that_actor Ross Perot gave us Clinton. Trump will give us another Dem President and a rad left Supreme Court for next 20 yrs. WAKE UP
@rebel_romantic that indiscriminate artillery shelling of separatist Ukr towns major cause of civilian deaths has been kept from Am people
@not_that_actor supporting Trump means 4 more years of liberal/left control of Presidency, which includes appointing Supreme Court judges
@rebel_romantic thanks for sending me the challenging letter. It reminds me of the letters I have wanted to send to liberals in my country.
@not_that_actor Trump won‚Äôt pledge to support GOP nominee thus is only factor that will insure our next Prez will be liberal-left.
@felipepiresrj flattered but with seven years in the Reagan White House I know I can accomplish more as an aggressive advocate in Congress
@felipepiresrj thank you for the compliment.
@caerbannog666 yep what you believe is high school stuff
@CallingLikeItIs in 2 weeks been across Am continent twice &amp; now in a distant country. Ur analysis on my time as off base other speculation
@capital_climate why is it so hard for you to admit the largest amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is not man made, maybe up to 90%?
@CallingLikeItIs That is a stupid hypothetical question. If most CO2 in atmosphere is not man made we can assume CO2 will always be there
@caerbannog666 names should be on old schedules. Yes, I have more 2 do than searching old schedules trying to figure which days I met whom
@caerbannog666 I hamy schedule hopefully with the names and spellings.
@caerbannog666 so if I send U names  of Russian Academy leaders who confirm they do NOT support AGW theory, U will concede  falsehood
@caerbannog666 nothing to do with trust. RU ACADEMY of SCI shows falsity of claims 97% of scientists &amp; all academies agree with AGW theory
@CallingLikeItIs hypothetical &amp; irrelevant . Many time periods earth had much more CO2 with it an abundance of life on land &amp; in sea
@CallingLikeItIs if the vast majority of a substance is naturally occurring then the vast majority of that substance is naturally occurring
@caerbannog666 CO2, most of it from nature, is minuscule part of  atmosphere &amp; compared to sun has minuscule impact on global climate.
@hammalhaidar The congressional hearing on Pakistani brutal repression &amp; terrorism was not canceled but postponed till Sept or Oct.
@robertaguilarjr call my office in Huntington Beach 714‚Äì960 - 6483.
@DionnehillOC you did not answer my question. I am seriously interested in who you think would be a better leader
@SnowSox184 in the end Iran‚Äôs Mullahs will have at least $50billion more to arm terrorists &amp; repress their own people
@Trev_Geer if foreigners let their gov pick and choose winners &amp; losers no reason for us to emulate their crony capitalist.
@ColleranUSA yes
@DionnehillOC Who do U want as Speaker?
@JoshTuransky we four best to help vets &amp; other folks from my district all the time. Have your friend call my office at 714 ‚Äì 960-6483.
@not_that_actor On Fox tonight he refused to rule out a third-party race. That scenario is a disaster from which there is no return
@ArtistCal but of course
@MailOsta Is difficult but don‚Äôt blame our nation(USA). Our people R free 2 run their own lives thus a small clique focuses foreign policy
@Trev_Geer I do not support taxing &amp; controlling&amp; regulating most US firms while subsidizing, assuming risk &amp; guarentees for others
@CallingLikeItIs
@CallingLikeItIs I have had numerous meetings with Rus Sci Acad. After ignoring all the AGW shenanigans be careful who U call liar
@CallingLikeItIs Sounds like even Ur sources claim around 3rd of CO2 man made. So a small part of minuscule element is man made.
@CallingLikeItIs Spoke directly 2 person U claim supports Ur GWarming scenario. He does not. Rus Academy believes earth in Cooling cycle
@CallingLikeItIs I will ask him to repeat this for me a 3rd time when I visit Russia in. Few weeks. Meeting with Ru Sci Academy routine
@CallingLikeItIs that‚Äôs typical of GWarming fanatics. Ur case not a refutation of any point I made but instead a string of personal attacks.
@CallingLikeItIs spoke directly 2 head of Russian Academy who claimed his name only meant verifying IPCC report research not the conclusions
@paulgfoster support labeling. consumer choice,especially important in areas of dispute like GMOs. Definitions still hazy, needs refinement
@JayQPublic an alarming story, some will say isn‚Äôt true. Point is in our country today it could well be true &amp; that must change.
@PaulNiland RIGHT, when someone challenges what U advocate,rather than refuting his arguments, U say bad things about that person.
@caerbannog666 Russian academy of Science believes planet cooling. That must mean every other scientist must be an AGM advocate. baloney
@JayQPublic never write anybody off. The world is often not what it seems atbanynpsrticular moment.
@reddit_ama underway! https://t.co/yx3t8KOtL9
@rdegucht CO2 is minuscule element of atmosphere...whatever it‚Äôs impact is tiny &amp; the vast majority of it is from natural sources not man
Currently doing a Reddit Ama. Ask me anything!
@PaulNiland I can‚Äôt remember saying ugly things about someone because they disagreed with me. guess U‚Äôre more sure of Yourself than I am
@mustikhan call Paul Berhends in my DC office to give suggestion for who would be good witness for the hearing
@pegasusepsilon non-voting stoners,like lots of others,leave the on-going struggle for liberty up to the rest of us.
@Sean_POG thank you for your good thoughts
@DonnHallman1 today we just passed legislation attacking the sanctuary cities. Ur jab and Republicans is counterproductive 2 what U believe
@mustikhan The congressional hearing on PAK repression of ethnic minorities, especially Baloch &amp; Sindhi, is postponed till September
@MailOsta must do everything we can to prevent Russia &amp; USA from becoming enemies again. Is enormously beneficial for us to work together
@MailOsta I enjoy those making a point or disagreeing with facts or logic but I block those who call names &amp; make personal attacks
@Red_Shirt_no2 No where report is exact temp that makes 2014 the hottest year. This report smells of mislabeling &amp; misrepresentation.
@AnonBaluchistan A congressional hearing in two weeks will examine Pakistan repression of ethnic minorities
@LibertySeeds interesting!
@shesova he is all our hero!!
@shesova it was a pleasure to discuss the issue with you. You are obviously an appreciative patriot who cares deeply about these Heros
@AlexanderBalkn sounds good to me
@shesova I support providing those benefits to WW2 MM vets, but not $25,000 in cash
@MailOsta thank you for the wonderful message and the wonderful music
@kevinjcoleman7 I support people of Crimea deciding their destiny via honest election. Guess U were just BSing about favoring my own tweets
@shesova I read tweets &amp; thus hear variety of opinions but rarely have no time to read material I am sent to back up those tweets.
@kevinjcoleman7 sorry I don‚Äôt understand ur point.
@shesova would support legislation providing to WW2 MM vets hospital &amp; other benefits equal to WW2 military vets, but not $25,000 cash
@caerbannog666 obviously some years higher some lower but max I was told 20percent, mini 5. Fact is most of CO2 in atmosphere not man made
@shesova the Philippines were US territory in WW2. Those who served in military given payment.
@shesova yes, got numbers turned around but we found it
@shesova we found it. it provides $25,000 one time grant to WW2 MM vets. Honoring them YES. Just giving them $ I don‚Äôt think so
@shesova that‚Äôs what our legislative summary said, that it provides for burial and other vets rights to WW2 MM vets. Will ask again
@caerbannog666 that is based on answers I have received at science Cmtee hearings over the years when asking verity of expert witnesses
@windoverthelea go back and watch it again. I went out of my way to complement her and to put forward my question in a respectful way
@mtobis Ur example actually reinforces The argument that CO2 level so minuscule that it can dramatically increase without a problem
@mtobis U did not confront main point: before humans Planet had more CO2 &amp; abundance of earth &amp; sea life thus increasing CO2 is not threat
@shesova I already cosponsored HR 1288 honoring WW2MM. HR536 gives each one $25,000. WW2 vets don‚Äôt get this so I can not support
@caerbannog666 CO2 in atmosphere so minuscule today increases mean almost nothing. B when it was more Except sea &amp; land life abundant
@nooribaloch1 Congressional hearng July 29th on treatment  of ethnic minorities in Pakistan. Brutal repression of Baloch highlighted
@windoverthelea far too many advocates of man made CO2 Global Warming theory R like religious zealots, unable to rationally argue their case
@windoverthelea do U teach Ur students 2 look at specific arguments on both sides of an issue &amp; 2 challenge facts &amp; logic &amp; no name calling
@caerbannog666 did humans produce the CO2 U claim caused an extinction? CO2 is so minuscule in atmosphere no impact on global temperature
@shesova In Cal where it is not so late
@shesova I will check.
@windoverthelea debate not about CO2 level but that gov regulator didn‚Äôt know even though pushing policies based on importance of that level
@caerbannog666 so how much of atmosphere was CO2 then. So it is obviously not man made
@shesova will check but I think I have endorsed that bill.
@SteveSGoddard thanks for passing on specific info on how GWarming fanatics are altering numbers &amp; fixing charts to deceive Am people
@windoverthelea U think it partisan 2 ask gov official what percentage of atmosphere is CO2, when it is being used to justify fed controls?
@windoverthelea U attacked with pejorative words rather than challenging my facts or arguments. Yes, U carefully did not hit my person
@mel_huang I try to hear all sides from &amp; other countries as well. I suggest you do the same rather than trying to undermine dialogue
@Red_Shirt_no2 CO2 levels had nothing to do with any historic extinction. I am champion establishing global defense from space objects
@mel_huang If merting requested U see the delegation or U don‚Äôt. Picking who is in their delegation is up to them.
@windoverthelea I have asked that question of Scientists &amp; never been told it was inappropriate. instead of calling names challenge facts
@ebaq67 baloney, I have been at hearings &amp; read reports @ articles with CO2 discussed as percent of atmosphere.
@mel_huang is that Y U hate Hungary to the point of undermine an Hungarian parliamentary delegations chances to confer with US Congress?
@tremoraction voted yes
@kevinjcoleman7 don‚Äôt know how extensive, but it likely has more to do with pesticide and not global warming.
@mel_huang Meeting Hungarian Parliament delegation. Guess U hate Hungary by trying to prevent such exchanges of view. Quit acting like nazi
@Mr_Bundesliga Y U Lie?Hungarian parliament all party delegation visiting DC asked for meeting. Ur description under cuts credibility
@SninkyPoo $billions wasted trying to prove man made CO2 causing Global Warming. That $ borrowed(kids debt)or taken from vital gov programs
@ Celazul1 several times in history of planet CO2 levels much higher yet there was abundance of life on land &amp; in the an sea
@not_that_actor is wrong to vilify poor Mexican people, the vast majority of whom R honest, to justify securing borders &amp; opposing amnesty
@not_that_actor truth is right. They shouldn‚Äôt be here &amp; no amnesty granted, but that doesn‚Äôt negate fact most R honest &amp; hard-working
@LibertySeeds Paul is a good man but we totally disagree on immigration, and on free trade with China and other hostile dictatorships
@Medvedev123456 those most energetically opposing amnesty R immigrants who are here illegally and Americans of Mexican descent.
@ga_girl730 what the heck are you talking about? I voted against no Child left behind. Get your facts straight or you will be ineffective.
@not_that_actor most illegals hard working &amp; seeking better life 4 family, in doing so bid down wages&amp;draining ed&amp;heathcare funds=hurting us
@Commoncorediva if the federal gov pays for education the federal governme will control it. Education should be left up to state &amp; local gov
@not_that_actor no amnesty. Illegal immigration must be stopped not rewarded. That said, Trump wrong &amp; mean spirited.Most illegals Good folk
@Jonnyhibberd after weeks of energetic protest suddenly cops attack? Did thugs join demonstrators &amp; throw .fire bombs? Who shot first?
@Jonnyhibberd U excuse shelling civilians to terrorize them. Just like U ignore violence that drove Ukraine‚Äôs elected prez from office.
@Jonnyhibberd U mean the gov that indiscriminately lobs artillery shells into separatist towns.
@cd5762 how about going to our jails and prisons and seeing what percentage of violent criminals being held are illegal immigrants.
@MailOsta what is important is what do the people of Crimea want.
@berthasanles claiming illegals evil people is wrong &amp; mean. Claiming illegals R not committing a substantial amount of crime is stupid
@timreckmeyer when I make an argument against what U advocate,(former high CO2 level included abundant life on land and sea U ignore. Shame
@BverInFL Trump‚Äôs  rant was based on wrong info, so is Ur misplaced sympathy on illegals.
@kevinjcoleman7 that‚Äôs the logic that guides U to all Ur conclusions. If dodge constituents why was in the July 4th parade?
@Rich_893 oh so instead of challenging facts or logic of one who disagrees, U just claim something that reflects badly on his character
@caerbannog666 claiming 97% scientists agree with man-made global warming theory undermines the credibility of any other argument U use
@timreckmeyer when CO2 levels much higher life flourished in sea &amp; land.
@MailOsta Russia gets no credit for efforts to be friend, or for freedom of religion or political protest in Russia. US being manipulated.
@gracielap123 trump wrong &amp; mean spirited. There R criminals here &amp; illegals  taking jobs &amp; benefits, but most R hardworking good people
@Kummernuss not baby steps, but steps. Did Oregon legalize med first or go directly to full legalization?
@DanaRohrabacher
@natewags do not despair we can get gov under control and recapture that spirit of America
@YuriyPartyka got to go now. Thanks for exchange of thoughts. I wish you well and hope this turmoil can be ended, for everyone‚Äôs sake
@YuriyPartyka UKr birthplace of Ru. I have traveled extensively in UKr &amp; a fan of UKr &amp; Ru culture, hated Reds was a ferocious cold warrior
@YuriyPartyka no country has that right, but is common, usually happening when democrat process trashed thus creating an unnecessary crisis
@YuriyPartyka third option: open hand not clenched fist =Ukr democratic &amp; friend/trading partner of all neighbors &amp; enemy of none
@Kummernuss I have endorsed it but I‚Äôm Smart enough to do it one step at a time.
@YuriyPartyka it started with violent overthrow of elected Prez. Had that not happened the conflict that followed would not have erupted
@YuriyPartyka Went to Russia &amp; checked freedom of religion. An unwilling 2 recognize this positive change fuels hostility &amp; creates conflict
@YuriyPartyka for many years Russia actually charged UKr less than market price for gas. Offered to restore lower price for long term deal
@YuriyPartyka not my reading, Russia offered better deal. EU wants as much control as Russia. EU uses banks Russia uses oil&amp; gas.
@not_that_actor absolutely right. Interesting this is happening here when in Russia Putin opened churches, opposes abortion &amp; gay marriage
@YuriyPartyka both EU &amp; Russia long term economic maneuvering. It isn‚Äôt just Russia‚Äôs fault. It could have avoided &amp; now must be stopped
@YuriyPartyka Janocovich opted 4 Russia‚Äôs offer,better than EU. If removed in next election all would now be OK. Don‚Äôt blame just Putin
@YuriyPartyka of course there are. Putin lied about it same way US Presidents have lied about such matters. Look for peace &amp; U will find it
@YuriyPartyka when Putin wrong I‚Äôm critical? not hard 2 see double standard of crowd who want ,not peace,but a new Cold War with Russia.
@YuriyPartyka thanks 4 addressing issue. Oligarch troops not as disciplined often commit crimes like shelling civilians 4 righteous cause
@YuriyPartyka They R &amp; should not be, just as Ukr army artillery should not be indiscriminately shelling separatist towns to terrorize
@YuriyPartyka Putin persona nor mine is the issue. had Janocovich been kicked out in next election there would be no conflict in Ukr today
@YuriyPartyka rather than assessing me how about trying to refute specific points like: is large Portion of Ukr army on oligarch payroll?
@YuriyPartyka  tweeting on the run I misspoke once not even realizing I‚Äôd stated that. Repeatedly bring that up as if it was a lie is a lie
@YuriyPartyka I am not on the side of Russia I am on the side of truth. I do not call names nor dismiss arguments, which prevents peace
@YuriyPartyka So anyone disagrees with U is corrupt or a clown. such arrogant dismissals easier than refuting arguments with logic or info
@eossipov Americans told Ukraine violence Russia‚Äôs fault. People of goodwill must stop this vilification, seek truth &amp; create peace not war
@kevinjcoleman7 got to sign off now. Thanks for the exchange.
@kevinjcoleman7 there R cycles of warming &amp; cooling but not caused by human activity
@kevinjcoleman7 so tell me Ur so-called facts that no numbers altered, no computer models manipulated, the predicted temp jump occurred
@kevinjcoleman7 I don‚Äôt claim to be. Scientist but as a journalist I saw fanatics exaggerate to the point of being untrue.
@kevinjcoleman7 so U believe 95% of scientists agree with Gwarming theory. Even Prez‚Äôs Science advisor  won‚Äôt back that bogus claim
@kevinjcoleman7 again when CO2 levels much higher, Life on planet thrived. humans irrelevant unless U claim man made CO2 worse than natural
@kevinjcoleman7 There R respected scientists on both sides of GWarming debate. Claiming 97o/o yet another bogus claim now glossed over
@kevinjcoleman7 what is it that U claim was wrong?
@kevinjcoleman7 thought U were referring to level of CO2. R U claiming Man made CO2 more impact than natural CO2?
@kevinjcoleman7 The numbers U rely on bogus, U ignore disclosure of fabrication just like U ignore failure of predictions based on CO2,
@kevinjcoleman7 One volcano can undue any man made CO2 reduction. When in long past planet had more CO2  life in oceans &amp; earth abounded.
@kevinjcoleman7 so to be cool surfers should go along with bogus global warming PR campaign to justifying global gov controlling our lives?
@kevinjcoleman7 numbers recorded B 4 they were altered 2 make it appear there‚Äôs been warming &amp; contrary stats from satellites expose fraud
@kevinjcoleman7 U &amp; Ur buddies can‚Äôt make personal attacks because your logic is flawed &amp; so-called  facts are based on bogus numbers
@krystalevy Global Warming advocates confronted with failure of prediction based on CO2 theory &amp; disclosure of bogus numbers ignore reality
@MailOsta correct
@AchtungBaby786 they will give you info
@Karee_news   I appreciate being appreciated. Thanks
@mgc_rrt good point
@JohnDelacour I would like to have seen it. Send again. Thanks &amp; good luck
@Frank_Myers01 not so creative hit
@kevinjcoleman7 that was a well thought out cut, very creative
@not_that_actor I wouldn‚Äôt force them, but would recommend good &amp; decent people of Mississippi 2 end official use of the Confederate flag.
@cjcmichel disputed claim that human activity changes world‚Äôs climate used to justify Global government control of human activity(us)
@_Molon_Labe_ sound like U R totally ignorant of my record. Half the time U‚Äôre accusing me of opposing something I voted for.
@PaulNiland more than one witness: Witness participant. BBC Videoed police hit first. Intercepted call between diplomats admit it.
@arthureace1 only trying to speak truth.
@PaulNiland bbc reported sniper fire hit police before any protestors were shot. Americans have not seen fire bombing  of police lines
@ECGuillet he was so bad instead of waiting 4 next election he had to be removed amid violence and chaos,making mockery of democracy
@ECGuillet so overthrowing elected Prez rather than waiting 4 next elections OK because it prevented economic cooperation rotten Russia
@ECGuillet so Ukraine‚Äôs situation with oligarchs &amp; violent overthrows of an elect President is demonstrably better than in Russia
@Todd_Ruffner so go ahead and tell us that Egypt would be better off with a Muslim brotherhood radical Islamic regime.
@ECGuillet what is important is if what I am saying is true, that it is being pushed by someone you don‚Äôt like.
@ECGuillet so far U have simply used pejorative words 2 describe me rather than discuss rightness or wrongness of any idea I advocate
@MailOsta horrible that Russia &amp; US again positioning as enemies.There R those in both countries who want Cold War to return.
@Todd_Ruffner Sisi first Egyptian President to reach out to Coptics and plead for a more tolerant Islam to the Muslim hierarchy
@ECGuillet anyone labeling those who disagree as useful stooges shouldn‚Äôt be complaining about Kremlin humiliation tactics
@JPNunno by excluding murderers &amp; terrorists the victims of these power seekers are now included in a coalition of the humane &amp; tolerant
@sivkai don‚Äôt Believe everything you read. That comment was meant to be a joke in answer to a reporters question
@mgc_rrt thanks for tipping me off. I am sure much information given to Congress is not accurate
@MailOsta I see your tweets. Next week you can call me at my office after sending a tweet to alter the me to your call.
@MarcVegan too many adjusted Numbers, the using of historical lows as base lines &amp; failed predictions based on CO2 warming theory.
@sivkai my goal is to determine facts , speak truth as I see it &amp; find path that both sides can take to end this mayhem &amp; bloodshed
@sivkai where we disagree: Who started violence that led to overthrow of a democratically elected president? level of violence by Ukr forces
@sivkai I have not endorsed Russian invasion &amp; believe people of Crimea should decide their status via a legitimate referendum
@sivkai U don‚Äôt know my positions: I have not endorsed the Crimea referendum. One that is observed &amp; legitimate needs to be held
@_Molon_Labe_ yes if the shoe fits deserves an answer: the shoe doesn‚Äôt fit U R sending vulgar tweets to someone who voted the way U wanted
@lllorik try can again
@sivkai so where is this hypocrisy U refer to? I advocate free &amp; fair elections to determine sovereignty
@_Molon_Labe_ if you aren‚Äôt smart enough to say something without using vulgarity why should I care what U think on any particular issue
@sentinel058 many members of Congress support TPP because businesses in their district ask them to.
@AchtungBaby786 yes
@cjcmichel The people who live in Crimea should decide the status of Ukraine,
@SohrabAhmari not so. I am pro freedom &amp; Pro peace. The Ukraine conflict started when elected President overthrown by street violence
@AchtungBaby786 On July 15 Chris Smith&amp;I will co-chair Congressional hearing into PAK violation of human rights
@AchtungBaby786 there will be a major congressional hearing about Pakistan violation of human rights July 15
@cbclark777 Serious reasons 4 concern but at least Turkey still democratic enough 4 an election that went against the party in power.
@_Molon_Labe_  I guess U R not intelligent enough 2 make Ur case without vulgarity. Reagan stayed away from anyone who used the F word
@_Molon_Labe_ look in the mirror idiot. I  opposed the trade bill &amp; voted against it.
@orach24463_cj Ur criticism was stupid. I voted against fast track.
@_Molon_Labe_ The vote U referenced was on the rules of the debate not the issue. Ur pejorative greeting was as stupid as it was hostile
@dzert91 I intend to vote no
@33Quince I intend to vote no.
@fubaglady I intend to vote no.
@SchoolerRobert I will be voting no
@caerbannog666 &amp; only high school students would ignore manipulation of data &amp; failure of predictions based on CO2 theory
Rohrabacher's Medical Marijuana Amendment passes the House http://t.co/IzG5n8RlDu
@JSQimprovements what votes R U talking about? Maybe U don‚Äôt know I voted against the so-called Patriot ACT
I'll be on Floor of House shortly presenting my amend respecting states' rights to set laws on med mj not fed gov http://t.co/HQoGXpgQLk
@JSQimprovements what are the issues that concern you. What votes that I have made upset you.
@AdorationServe thanks for good thoughts but it is hard enough being a member of Congress
@NormanDeArmond both USA &amp; Russia  have so much to gain by being friends. There those who want to restart Cold War. We can‚Äôt let that happen
@gracielap123 leaving off word ‚Äúillegal‚Äù Is racist &amp; insulting to legal immigrants.
@JSQimprovements U won‚Äôt agree with every vote I‚Äôve made which has 4th Amendment implications, but on most of them I think we‚Äôre in sync
@SpacerockDodger our lack of a prepared response is insane
@StagingAuthor it sounds good to me
@TNTweetersCA Y do U always mix illegals with legal immigrants who oppose amnesty &amp; support republican?Mixing the 2 is dishonest &amp; racist
@elisatrevino17 better never if so-called reform means amnesty to 25 million here illegally &amp; bring millions more as family reunification
@cdr999 right
@j2JaneJerome OK now I know your smart, confident, but not serious. It has been an interesting exchange.
@j2JaneJerome rad enviro $ used 2 impact public policy far out weighs Kochs, who R ideological, motivated by more than self interest
@j2JaneJerome By Focusing on Koch support permits U to personally attack those who disagree with U without refuting their arguments.
@j2JaneJerome Blatant lying, targeting of political opponents, cover ups that include destroying evidence, but U Focus on Koch contributions
@j2JaneJerome article U site starts with bogus claim 97% of scientists agree with global warming theory, typical of false AGW evidence.
@j2JaneJerome oh, so you don‚ÄôtI think that the IRS targeting of political enemies is more important than catching someone who broke rules
@MarcVukcevich certainly volcanoes &amp; rotting jungle wood put more in CO2 than humans.
@j2JaneJerome if after IRS targeting scandal U can‚Äôt recognize D‚ÄôSousa case as selective prosecution Ur vision is ideologically impaired
@j2JaneJerome So I Missworded something once &amp; not knowing that I did,denied it, that reflects on my character? Do Hillary &amp; Obama upset U?
@JoshuaNehmeh went to six Memorial Day events today. Glad to see the expressing of heartfelt gratitude for who gave their lives for US
@j2JaneJerome yes, pointing out one of my tweets was inaccurate is fine, ignoring it was misswording used only once is not
@j2JaneJerome exposing major corporation‚Äôs politically correct censorship by manipulation of  public data is not inconsistent with my ideals
@j2JaneJerome a poor but legal immigrant. Puts together two films critical of Obama...targeted by IRS&amp; Google. Shame on U 4 not condemning
@j2JaneJerome I no longer feel compelled to be 100% consistent on everything, especially when powerful abusing a little guy
@j2JaneJerome how clever making an ad hominem attack out of a challenge to attack issues and policy differences rather than personal jabs
@j2JaneJerome The challenge is to find ways to disprove my ideas rather than attacking my person. Leftists can‚Äôt seem 2 tell the difference
@j2JaneJerome yes,‚Äùdeep roots‚Äù is fanatasy. Met Koch once 30/40 yrs ago. willingness 2 cooperate doesn‚Äôt mean I do. Better 2 attack my ideas
@aaronscherb thanks for paying attention to the details and to the impact   Of my proposals on government accountability
@j2JaneJerome We disagree man-made CO2 causing earth current climate cycle. U claim my bias but not U. Ur Koch fixation is leftist fantasy.
@SninkyPoo do U believe everyone who disagrees with U on an important issue is blinded by bias?
@SninkyPoo if current climate trends caused by man made CO2,predictions based on that theory would be evident. Instead predictions failed
@JamesMuncy and thank Jim Muncy 4 the significant role he is played in creating the commercial space industry.
@SninkyPoo believing climate cycles in past nor present R not caused by human activity, Prez Obama‚Äôs prioritizing it over terrorism absurd
@clminakowski Ur right! I I am so grateful to have known him and work for him. He was a wonderful person and a great leader.
@DrSamStrauss thanks forgoes thoughts. Always believed in technology &amp; freedom...&amp; having fun. That swim with astronauts was really fun
@DrSamStrauss I‚Äôve got a photo of that swim with the astronauts on my wall in DC. Clearing debris &amp; planetary defense R now my NASA priority
@firmgreen call my office 714 -421-0090 and let me know hey bout in the event, large or small, that you would like me to attend.
@firmgreen Will do what I can. My father was a proud Marine.
@gracielap123 looks like we agree on something
@JeannaC100 Orange county has plenty of water because we prepared for dry periods. In the rest of state, rad enviros have prevented it.
@strongriley man made CO2 small portion of atmosphere‚Äôs CO2,enough to accomplish any positive role it plays in equilibrium of our planet
@astroEdLu In cooperation with other countries we need to set out a specific game plan to defend the earth from a threatening space object
@CA_Lady keeping secret provisions of a major trade treaty, like TPP, which would dramatically impact our lives, totally unacceptable
@strongriley CO2 is a microscopic &amp; inconsequential part of atmosphere. The sun is major factor in earth climate. CO2 almost no impact
@DrVanNostrand Using so-called trolls as excuse multinational corps R pushing  reforms that Will destroy our patent system 4 US inventors
@strongriley bogus CO2 theory already cost Am people hundreds of billions $ in energy prices &amp; nonsensical regulation &amp;  research grants
@strongriley Congress warned of major temp jump within 10 yrs. A tipping point they said. one of many inaccurate predictions.
@ImmigrantNat1on  A large percent of legal immigrants and citizens of Hispanic descent do not support Amnesty for those here illegally.
@strongriley small action? They have already channeled $billions to scientists  pushing AGW to justify major controls on our lives.
@strongriley pay attention to arguments &amp; evidence not orgs. To often AGW advocates provide false or inaccurate info &amp; predictions fail
@AdamMossoff powerful multi national corps R trying 2 destroy our patent system so they can use creative genius of inventors without paying
@SpacerockDodger 4 15 yrs been trying 2 get my fellow colleagues 2 understand this danger. It‚Äôs been like beating my head against an astroid
@AchtungBaby786 those suffering from Pakistani terrorism and oppression should know they are not forgotten. I am not their only friend in US
@strongriley DOD proclamation, like NASA, mandated by Prez Obama‚Äôs team. question not if there is climate change but if it is man made.
@gracielap123 Glad to see you don‚Äôt disagree with me on everything.
@SouthHumanist not sure what you are referring to
@SouthHumanist earth could well be in yet another natural climate cycle reflected in anarcticice, 1920s had similar arctic ice flow as today
@DirtyDemocrat rather than being vulgar U should focus on making Urself clear. I can‚Äôt figure out what U R asking
I'll be on House Floor in 15 min 2 offer amend calling on Pakistan 2 free Dr Afridi, hero who risked his life to help us locate Bin Laden
@MarkMcCurdy OK mark
@BreeneMurphy sever arthritis, haven‚Äôt been surfing over a year
@2protectandsurf limited revenue should be used to protect people from rapists, robbers&amp; murderers, not preventing someone from smoking weed
@j2JaneJerome wrong, 47 percent of Latinos polled, not 47 percent of Latino voters. Education, healthcare &amp; jobs Impacted by illegals
@gracielap123 majority of Americans of Hispanic descent &amp; vast majority of legal immigrants oppose amnesty for illegal immigrants.
@timreckmeyer now franking has US energy self-sufficient,any mandated change is costly redirection of resources at expense of other needs
@SpacerockDodger  alerting public &amp;organizing planetary defense against very real threat of space objects  is a legitimate task for NASA.
@1ladyforliberty will check it out
@OrionKarlDaley I certainly agree with that
@timreckmeyer we are already weaned off of Middle East oil. Franking has made us independent. AGW theory destroyed jobs &amp; sapped our economy
@tensiontest BS, rad enviros care more about plants &amp; animals than people. They‚Äôve destroyed massive food supplies of food upping cost 2 eat
@mdcolliM ignorant 2 pointout AGW advocates(rad enviros)forced Cal 2 teardown dams,neglect H2O system &amp; dump billions of gallons into ocean
@MangoIvy I don‚Äôt stand with gov control of our lives. I don‚Äôt stand with criminals who would harm us.I stand with Constitution &amp; citizenry.
@not_that_actor that‚Äôs right, more people need to be saying it.
@hadifalbalooshi The brutal PAK murder of Baloch will be documented at a Congressipnal hearing in July
@Commoncents4me I don‚Äôt sign up, but  I vote right
@gracielap123 GOP deterred Obama from permitting massive flood of illegals into our country. an accomplishment for which Am people grateful
@SninkyPoo human CO2 production has minuscule, if any, impact on climate. Flawed AGW theory being used to justify tyranny by global gov.
@mtobis WRONG
@MarcVegan having been a journalist I recognize hype &amp; flawed logic. It doesn‚Äôt take a scientist to see failed predictions &amp; bogus numbers
@caerbannog666 if it is so easy Y do U skip around a direct challenge to specific claims made that numbers altered
@CColose this discussion about George Schultz memory of Reagan response to Reports of an Ozone hole. He does not write scientific papers.
@caerbannog666 I am not Ur researcher. This was widely reported less than a year ago. Google it.
@CColose sounds like dismissal instead of refutation. Might try a specific challenge, otherwise is same mindless name-calling as AGW crowd
@caerbannog666 several investigative reports exposed differences in temp levels as recorded on monitor site vs those issued to public
@CColose lucky I‚Äôve got someone like you,who is always right, to make general statements rather than challenge specific errors.
@AchtungBaby786 In 2 weeks I will provide place to send evidence PAK atrocities. The hearing will take place July.
@AirborneInfVet Anyone can use my tweets. I consider them part of the public record.
@AbnInfVet anyone can use my tweets. I consider it part of the public record.
@82ndAbnInfVet use anything I tweet. I consider it on the public record. Good luck I used to be a journalist myself. U R the new journalism
@AchtungBaby786  there will be a major investigative hearing to expose PAK massive violation of human rights &amp; heinous war crimes.
@SpacerockDodger I agree
@jesse_holbrook U R free to be as nasty, mean &amp; arrogant as U please with those elected officials with whom U disagree. I prefer dialogue
@timreckmeyer my memory of ozone scare differs from George. Hole, cyclical, discovered shortly before crisis declared, then shrank naturally
@SteveWorks4You glad to see my good friend Steve Stockman. Every time I get used to having him around...he disappears
@tensiontest clearly, more CO2=global warming is hoax used 2 justify giving global gov control over our lives, a monstrous attack on freedom
@contzor let‚Äôs make America free like the patriots intended. Liberty not nanny government oppression.
@tensiontest controlling CO2 excuse to control housing, energy development, parking, airplane fares, manufacturing, even diet=fascist state
@gracielap123 U R always mixing illegals in with illegals. It is racist &amp; great disservice to legal immigrants, who strongly oppose amnesty
@tensiontest not drought, nenviro-fascism destroying Cal jobs &amp; food. U claim global warming justifies even more gov Control over our lives.
@tensiontest typical lib insanity, look in mirror. U R  defending dumping billions of gallons fresh water into ocean when crops R dying.
@gracielap123 taking jobs from citizens &amp; bidding down wages doesn‚Äôt raise standard of living or tax revenue needed 4 better life in USA
@VikkiHeelsOC haven‚Äôt thought that much about it
@j2JaneJerome I guess that was a compliment..maybe
@gracielap123 people who come 2 USA illegally should not have equal rights 2 gov benefits &amp; jobs that belong 2 legal immigrants &amp; citizens
@PoseidonAsset can‚Äôt figure out if U are  with or against me
@luke_keith Obama wants us to support a treaty that would regulate our economic lives even before we know what‚Äôs in the treaty. No way
@LibbyHuyck I intend to vote that way, against crony capitalism.
@cwhite30 huge multinational corps trying to steal from America‚Äôs inventors. Don‚Äôt get suckered into their cover story about trolls
@GunnetteP will see if GOP is serious about individual freedom, limited government, personal responsibility&amp; 10th amendment.
@Hinton2016 fed gov should not be controlling our lives, especially med treatment of pain. US 4 freedom. I am one of us, patriots will win
@tensiontest yes, time 2 stop stupid Rad enviros policies like massive dumping of fresh water into ocean,not filling reservoirs&amp;downing dams
I'll be on House Floor in 10 min to talk about patent rights &amp; legis I authored today that will respect states rights wrt 2 marijuana laws.
@j2JaneJerome U don‚Äôt believe that anyone who disagrees with U can be intelligent &amp; honest. That says a lot about U.
@PaulNiland thanks for Ur courteous challenges. I am on road now, so in couple days start again, time for bed, best wishes.
@PaulNiland my understanding EU offer was no chance of Common Market, Russian offered fundamental new Econ relationship not just more debt
@PaulNiland that is fair, but when juxtaposing negotiations, specific day of offer may not be as relevant as you suggest.
@PaulNiland yes, appreciate polite challenges. Back in DC I should be able give U more specifics, until then answers more general in concept
@PaulNiland offer more money in long run as part of integrated economic system. EU meant more debt &amp; Econ decline in long run.
@PaulNiland however long it took, even Merkel admits treating Yanukovych better would have averted crisis.
@AndrewScheidl Unlike Afghan, current conflict won‚Äôt end if target is a winner and a loser. A good deal makes sense &amp; benefits everybody
@shulika77 I will look at specifics when I get back to DC, however, I understand that cash isn‚Äôt only consideration. Goal now: End conflict
@PaulNiland I understand EU did not open Econ door 2 Ukr as compared  2 Russia‚Äôs offer of immediate steps toward tangible econ cooperation
@PaulNiland OK that is a great challenge. I will be back in DC in couple of days and get the specifics to send you. Thanks for real debate
@AndrewScheidl think lowly of me if U want. Perhaps U have heroic battle record, but we don‚Äôt need a new Cold War &amp; I am trying to avert it
@AndrewScheidl that is Ur view. As a special assn‚Äôt to President Reagan it was a bit dangerous, as the members of my team bombed found out
@PaulNiland Even Merkel admits had EU offered more there‚Äôd be no Ukr crisis. Will be in DC in few days &amp; get U specifics of U want
@PaulNiland I am not in my office to be more specific but offer made by EU, which I saw, was clearly inferior to what Russia offered.
@PaulNiland thank you will try to give you answers if I can
@AndrewScheidl my unit poured dozens of 120 mm rockets into Soviet positions &amp; was on receiving end of Soviet artillery reply.
@AndrewScheidl I spent a week in Afghanistan with a muj unit at the battle of Jalabad in late 1988. Spent seven years in Reagan White House
@PaulNiland I don‚Äôt know who you are. I don‚Äôt understand how the text works. And I don‚Äôt feel compelled to talk to everybody.
@FaizMBaluch I am doing everything I can to stop US weapons from going to PAKs who then used them to repress ‚Äò kill innocent Baloch
@circleofinsight call Ken in my DC office and see if it can be scheduled
@Mr_Bundesliga have enjoyed our substantive tweet discussions.There R, however, other issues so my tweets will not be as frequent. Good luck
@baloch_bhadur a congressional hearing on PAK human rights crimes against Bsloch people is being prepared
@Fareed_Bugti slaughter of Baloch by Pak military armed with sophisticated US weapons a monstrous crime against humanity.US must end PAKaid
@MrJeanBruno guess those folks who have elected me with solid majorities for last 26 years disagree with you
@chester_ward thank U. Got nothing 2 prove. I fought Soviets troops &amp; was a senior speechwriter to President Reagan for 7 years. Never hated
@Mr_Bundesliga Putin Will do what is in his interest in the interest of his country, as he sees it. Maybe something mutually beneficial
@chester_ward you are‚Äôs are so smart to say something like that.
@Mr_Bundesliga I judge Putin with the same standards that I judge those responsible for the violent overthrow of the last Ukrainian Pres.
@Mr_Bundesliga  because I believe it a wrong decision for Putin to send troops into Ukraine, maybe I can help find a way out of this crisis
@bangkokdave it is not on my list of things to do
@Mr_Bundesliga let me add to that again, I not only publicly opposed sending Russian troops to Crimea but anywhere in Ukraine
@Mr_Bundesliga did I not confirm that Putin  sending Russian troops into Crimea was wrong. I have repeated that several times.
@lovatt_harry whoever lives in Crimea should be able to vote as to what the Crimea‚Äôs status should be. Any force or violence on them wrong
@Mr_Bundesliga the principle is self determination anyone going into areas of conflict should respect rights of local populations
@Mr_Bundesliga sorry, but the kind of discussion you want to have does not go well on tweeter. Detailed analysis better on another venue
@ExpatOd missworded means I used wrong word 2 describe event.only deception is effort to draw attention away from ‚Äúviolent overthrow‚Äù
@ExpatOd so one missworded tweet gets U upset as compared to dozens of others referring to violent overthrow of an elected President. Really
@lovatt_harry Russia, Germany, Japan all had such crimes in the not so distant past
@connor_medcalf that is why without OSCE supervision prerequisite for such referendum
@bsuphi644 southern states would not have had slave population which was prevented from voting on the issue, they would have had that right
@chrisbrulak all donations R public. Too bad repressive mindsets drive people to focus on personal attacks &amp; hurting those who disagree
@DF_Edwards No U are unaware of statements I‚Äôve made and policies I‚Äôve supported.
@bangkokdave My policy positions not always based on what law is, but often on what law &amp; or public policy should be
@Vieta_Rusanova guess U have trouble identifying a policy decision based on principle.in this case it is self-determination
@LouisCasiano call Ken Grubbs in DC office to set it up.
@j2JaneJerome it should be left to people who reside in Crimea. Anyone who opposes giving theman honest vote is opposing democracy 4 them
@vorobyov not me. Maybe U don‚Äôt know Ur history. US &amp; NATO backed Kosovo‚Äôs struggle for independence
@bungdan of majority of Alaskans vote to become part of Canada or even Russia then that is their right
@ExpatOd enough about one unintentional misswording among a hundred tweets. Bringing it up is more stupid than the original mistake
@uamuzik yep!
@SpilnoTVEnglish Yes I was a journalist for about tens years. Younger years I was a janitor, an invoice clearly &amp; an ice cream scooper
@StanleyBonk I have been in a number of war zones, mainly fighting communists
@j2JaneJerome no excuse for not letting Crimea voters decide their fate through an honest vote
@PaulNiland  I haven‚Äôt had Time to get up to everybody.
@Mr_Bundesliga I think there are a lot of forces at play in this whole crisis. Pardon me for not being able to give you a total analysis now
@agiamba if the majority of the people of a state vote to be part of Canada or Mexico or just independent then that is what should happen
@lovatt_harry I am not pro Putin. Before Putin Russia haters were just as vehement,
@DarbyFreeman2 do feel same about Grmans &amp; Japanese. Should Americans feel that way about British?
@DarbyFreeman2 if people R permitted to legally reside in a country they have rights to vote to determine future
@cjcmichel my view: sovereignty resides with the consent of the governed.
@cjcmichel yes, it is called self determination which is what NATO did 20 years ago in Kosovo with my support
@JuliaDavisNews not sure right now.Not sure I‚Äôm going
@SpilnoTVEnglish excuse me for being elected 13 times with solid majorities even though my campaigns spent very little compared to others
@StanleyBonk those kind of people exist. Usually they have never seen combat up close
@tnmc I do not assume those who disagree with me are stupid or corrupt. honest discussion of is up lifting
@Mr_Bundesliga I want to look at the situation more closely.
@Mr_Bundesliga that will be a major step in the right direction if he is willing to take it.
@lovatt_harry I‚Äôve made my disagreements with Putin clear. grudges left over from Cold War, before Putin,  R driving us back to hostility
@Mr_Bundesliga I don‚Äôt have a certainty about all the facts like U &amp; other tweeters seem to have. Things going on out of sight
@Mr_Bundesliga yes, any legitimate referendum must meet acceptable standards, as U‚Äôve outlined.
@cjcmichel no, any legitimate election needs to have OSCE oversight
@JuliaDavisNews as a senior member of US Congress US taxpayers pay for my travel. Russia is part of my Cmtee oversight responsibilities
@cjcmichel For third time, I believe that is a question to be answered by an OSCE supervised referendum in Crimea.
@DarbyFreeman2 those stuck in hatred for Russians for sins of Soviet Union are driving us into new Cold War with the Russian people
@DarbyFreeman2 there needs to be an OSCE supervised referendum. Let people of Crimea decide
@AlyaShandra repeating my miswording of one tweet as compared to ‚Äúviolent overthrow‚Äù used in all the rest undermines honest discussion
@AbbottIT repeating a lie harms public debate. Is that or has that been my belief or was it a miswording in one of many many tweets
@javalinarage those who claim that those who disagree must be stupid or corrupt are talking about themselves
@Mr_Bundesliga atrocities on both sides. The indiscriminate shelling of separatists towns by Ukr military source of many civilian casualties
@Mr_Bundesliga there should be an OSCE supervised referendum in Crimea. The people there should decide to be part of Russia or Ukraine
@MrJeanBruno time to find compromise and quit ignoring what precipitated this bloody mess
@cjcmichel I have a long history of supporting self-determination, Kosovo, Kashmir, Blochistan, Scotland. Crimea &amp;. Ossetia not exceptions
@cjcmichel we should look for a way out of this mess. One part of a compromise might be to have OSCE supervised Referedumin Crimea
@JudytaPapp I earned my rights with Reagan, spending 9 years of my life working directly with him every day. That was a stupid thing to say
@Mr_Bundesliga , more control over media, permitting oligarchs too much power, not reaching out to West with dialogue rather than posturing
@Mr_Bundesliga to name few, I‚Äôve publicly opposed his decision 2 send Russian troops across border,2 appoint rather than elect governors
@Mr_Bundesliga A number of my tweets blocked. I assume by hate Russia crowd who R acting like commies they claim to oppose.
@cjcmichel what is important is what do the people of Crimea think. There should be OSCE supervised elections in Crimea to let people decide
@Lavionne nope, repeatedly said he was violently overthrown, gang who keeps focus on one admittedly misworded tweet is practicing deception
@free_democrat and anyone who disagrees with U should have tweets blocked like they‚Äôve done to mine. Yes, communists had such arrogance too
@JudytaPapp the Russia haters don‚Äôt understand Reagan was against communism not the Russian people. We don‚Äôt need new Cold War
@Mr_Bundesliga some Russia hater decided to act like a communist by blocking me
@carmenvellon I have tried to answer but haveÔøº been blocked by some Russia hater posing as freedo lover
@szaulo good graphic for a guy who answers challenges on issues by claiming other guy doesn‚Äôt think
@carmenvellon keep telling Urself that, but clear Dems &amp; Obama demand their way or no way, then blame GOP for not giving into everything
@RandomHero30 we passed bill to keep fed gov operating Dem Senate rejected it cause Obama threatened veto...so U think Ll GOP fault
@Nigel_Holland no, but there would likely have been no Russian reaction had he not been violently removed with EU blessing
@j2JaneJerome excuse me but haven‚Äôt I already said it was a one word mistake. Ur repetition is little more than excuse not to address issues
@j2JaneJerome The last few Ukr Presidents seem to have that in common.
@SteveKomarnycky I have no idea what about any Rus survey. So U think EU didn‚Äôt have a hand when Elected Ukr Prez violently driven out?
@j2JaneJerome The discussion:the violent  nature of Ukr Presidents exit from office. Focusing on mistaken use of one word is diversion
@j2JaneJerome I do my own tweets. Is amazing how many try to avoid discussion of an issue by focusing on a mistaken use once of one word
@olenalukashchuk animosity on all sides. hostility toward Russia continued rather than gratitude for troop pullback &amp; discarding communism
@PaulNiland I still can‚ÄôR figure out how to pull up that material. How about making Ur point rather than passing on material
@MrJeanBruno yes,I Condemn it without reservation.do U acknowledge large number killed by Ukr army indiscriminate shelling of seperatist
@UFSGroup so instead of trying 2 argue Ur case or advocate Ur beliefs U opt 4 pressure and or intimidation. Did U claim U oppose Communism?
@SteveKomarnycky if the OSCE verifies an election, I tend to accept it as the will of the people.
@cjcmichel Trying to find technical errors in the tweets prevents honest discussion of differences. Of course, that is what some people want
@ThatLime Like Kosovo &amp; other places of conflict, local people should determine their destiny through the ballot box.
@ArianaGicPerry mistakes are mistakes not dishonesty...more word games as part of personal attack, rather than confronting the ideas
@JonasHalo U could be right about those graves, will check. but U ignore indiscriminate artillery shelling of eastern towns by Ukr army
@syadoz1 wrong, Reagan had to overcome hate Russia crowd in Washington in order to bring down the Soviet Union. otherwise, still in Cold War
@AlexPanchenko2 The hostility has been coming from people stuck in the Cold War mentality. Is pushing our countries into needless conflict
@olex_scherba what is this ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù stuff. I am one of the poorest, if not the poorest, member of Congress.
@Mr_Bundesliga I am not in Moscow. I don‚Äôt gov should I own and run radio stations. I disagree with a significant number of Putin decisions
@Ashtray_Cowboy oh that‚Äôs just what U tell everybody uses agree with. How democratic of you.
@XSovietNews no, it was when he was violently removed from elected office by those opposed to an Econ agreement with Russia rather them EU
@ThatLime The only thing that matters is whether what I say is truthful and accurate. I am open to hear info that indicates I am wrong.
@SteveKomarnycky I have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about
@tnmc The operative word you used was ‚Äúthink‚Äù I would suggest U use the word ‚Äúfeel‚Äù which is more consistent with the rest of your message
@Divsock it was 1988 and many times since
@FJKapanina guess those bloody hands belong to Palestinian terrorists who launch rockets into Israel knowing retaliation will come to Gaza
@yer_conscience try being specific and see.
@ArianaGicPerry so U R playing word games rather than having an exchange of views. So sad, it is jugstaposing ideas &amp; views that‚Äôs of value
@PeterRiebeek1 no, I have publicly criticized Russia for sending troops across border. The fighting should end ASAP
@ArianaGicPerry I wouldn‚Äôt use word ‚Äúassassinate‚Äù that already got me in trouble. I would say: call into question
@ArianaGicPerry The answer was yes. U think my answers R canned? I even make mistakes &amp; then have to admit it? Other electeds don‚Äôt do this
@MisterQuadruple there were reports at one point most civilian casualties traced to indiscriminate Ukr army artillery shelling Eastern towns
@PlenumTriune I was hoping some people who don‚Äôt want a newCcold War would send a positive tweet. Thanks
@GordBolton there is ample evidence that a number of police were shot before snipers shot demonstrators. This was a monstrous power play.
@dokpress yes, I understand there R neo nazis on one side &amp; fascists on the other. ending this should be a priority &amp; it won‚Äôt be with guns.
@ArianaGicPerry yes, former gov was violently overthrown by domestic forces in collusion with EU power brokers out to keep Ukr in Econ orbit
@RonWordwelder got 2 get some sleep before I mistakenly use another word which will enable people 2 ignore points of contention. Good night
@SergeHalytsky you want to send yet another elected official to Moscow because he disagrees with U. Yes, there seems to be a pattern
@yer_conscience I have made wording mistakes. If I was aware of it, it wouldn‚Äôt be mistake. Violent overthrow was description in all but one
@IgorGreenwald it isn‚Äôt family values. It is truth. We R being pushed into new Cold War with Russia, by those who have grudges from last one
@tnmc that pretty much reflects Ur side of the debate. It takes superior knowledge to make a case like that.
@ThatLime there U go again:elected official disagrees with U &amp; instead of debate U want him out of office. My voters don‚Äôt want new Cold War
@olex_scherba I sympathize with suffering Ukr people. All of them including those in eastern towns indiscriminately shelled by Ukr army.
@ThatLime not a long time friend met him once. I don‚Äôt agree or condone half of the decisions he makes and the things he does
@theBlushMedia yes, I am not sure of all tweet abbreviations, often made upon spot
@XSovietNews have followed events &amp; reviewed BBC news clips. Peaceful protest went on for weeks, guns &amp; violence then evident on both sides
@MichaelRCaputo Ukrainian people deserve better. This crisis started with EU power play when UKr Prez accepted better Russian Econ offer.
@owl156 calling names when someone disagrees with U does not reflect a democratic spirit, like forcing out democratically elected President
@RevelationXVIIl EU encouraged chaos when Ukr President accepted better deal offered by Russia than what was offered by EU. Violence evident
@owl156 so all those fire bond not thrown &amp; snipers never fired &amp; EU kingmakers never tried to interfere with UKr internal politics? Really?
@PaulNiland He won an OSCE monitored election. Like every Ukr gov before he was corrupt.Ukr needed help Russia offered much more than EU.
@doublebo7 that elected gov fled because level of violence overwhelming nothing to brag about, especially when outside manipulation involved
@PaulNiland UK on this discussion obviously means Ukraine
@ScrewMugabe yes, I have been elected just like Yanukovych was, and the EU has no business engaging in power play to negate that election
@StopAgitprop that is correct. The peaceful protest went on for weeks. The upsurge of violence, including sniping, was not just from Ukr gov
@MichaelRCaputo I was anti-Communist, not anti-Russian. Those stuck in the Cold War are pushing the world towards a new era of hostility.
@hoi_polloi23 the elected President fled. That he was corrupt isn‚Äôt surprising. street violence not exposure of corruption sent him fleeing
@whereismymon since when it legitimate 4 the German gov to dictate who will govern another country that has an elected President?
@whereismymon he was obviously not assassinated. He was violently removed, with the support of the EU in a travesty to democracy
@Mr_Bundesliga thanks 4 reminder. I thought I consistently described events as violent overthrow,apparently once I used word assassination.
@chebatron peaceful protests for weeks then surge of violence. Videos show police firebombed, then sniped then they ruthlessly retaliated
@jatrius why do you keep talking about assassination? I‚Äôve never used that word or suggested Ukr Prez killed.
@UKreality If EU had waited to next election, not encouraged violent overthrow, there would be no crisis in Ukraine today.
@intensionality EU offered little help to Ukr in economic crisis. Ukr elected President turned to Russia for help. EU set out to destroy him
@UKreality I wrote many other speeches for Pres. Reagan, but not that one. However, I helped smuggle it to him.
@Eminescu yes that‚Äôs the mentality: if someone challenges Ur opinion, attack them personally. &amp; U claim to be against the commies
@doublebo7 should have been decided at ballot box. Peaceful protests went on for weeks. Someone manipulated situation to remove elected Prez
@UKreality Review BBC coverage. Peaceful protests, then firebombing of police, then sniping at police then surge of retaliation. EU‚Äôs plan
@eyes21st1 Is the rationale for EU to drive out a democratically elected Prez. This is what the old commies used to do
@Vonnachtigal that‚Äôs right, call names but don‚Äôt confront arguments. How admirable your commitment to Democratic gov
@chebatron the violence that led to the exit of Ukr Prez was preconcieved. No that is not democratic.
@imratea propaganda not issue. Shooting &amp; Fire bombing police till they over react is old communist tatic, apparently now used by EU
@Mr_Bundesliga I never said assassination.shows honesty of supporters of violent removal of elected Ukr prez,precipitating current crisis
@UANews4ENMedia I have not used words kill or assassinate, violent overthrow of elected Uk Prez bad enough. Shameless attack on Demcracy
@SanhoTree If fed prosecutor targets med marijuana operation in state that has legalized it, the prosecutor is arrogantly breakering law
@UANews4ENMedia total BS. Peaceful demonstrations went on till Euro enlisted outsiders who wanted to nix trade deal began attacking police,
@UANews4ENMedia he was elected Prez, was violently removed. Like what communists did, now U justify it because U disagree with Econ policy
@UANews4ENMedia U may have missed it but the last Ukrainian Prez who was elected in an honest election was violently overthrown by Pro Euros
@lovatt_harry don‚Äôt wait for me.
@UANews4ENMedia Ukraine mess started by assassination of elected president. Hostility toward Russia not justified.Will create new Cold War
@lllorik I am traveling for the next few weeks. Will be in Berlin and Moscow. If it could be arranged I will do it
@gracielap123 those who immigrated here legally vehemently oppose giving amnesty those who thumbed their nose at Am law &amp; came illegally
@UANews4ENMedia those trying to create a new cold war between Russia and the US are as intolerant of disagreement as were the old Commies.
@gracielap123 if U want a dialogue U have to confront the issues brought up by Ur adversary
@ToddKolod I have been waiting for report.
@1ladyforliberty I am inclined to vote against it.
@TNTweetersCA by mixing legal &amp; illegals in same group U R the most anti- immigrant of all
@JordanRJensen thanks for alerting me,in your own Humble way, to the upcoming distribution of your thought-provoking speech.
@ACTBIGOBAMA so U want how many millions more to come here, attracted by  amnesty for those who came here illegally?
@JeffguyJg numbers U refer to mix illegal &amp; legal immigrants. Just illegals consume far more Ed&amp; healthcare benefits than taxes they pay
@gracielap123 If U R native to this land No worry when those not native or legally here R denied jobs &amp; gov health &amp; Ed benefits &amp; sent home
@JeffguyJg my problem:millions of poor foreigners drawn by amnesty will take jobs &amp;drain $ 4 health, education, retirement hurting Americans
@JeffguyJg  mixing illegal with legal immigrants blurs truth &amp; is a disservice to those who respected our laws &amp; waited their turn
@BruceGoewey  mixing legals with illegal is disservice to those Who went through the procedures and waited in line to come here legally
@GOTV16 I‚Äôve never been anti-immigrant. I support America‚Äôs large annual intake.  I oppose treating illegals the same as those here legally
@insiderwisdom25 no schools healthcare or social security when my family got here. Amnesty=millions more illegals taking these programs down
@fullofbalogna tough 2 understand. R U claiming I claimed that I never lusted in my heart &amp; U recorded it? So let‚Äôs hear me not being open
@gracielap123 legalize millions here illegally=tens of millions more will come flooding our schools &amp; draining health&amp;retirement funds
@bnew559 correct,that is true of many countries, but Russia shares with us common enemies &amp; emerging enemies in Rad Islam &amp; China
@CPJ_Eurasia good question, Will ask next time I see their ambassador.
@bnew559 never tough on Russia, I was tough on communism &amp; Soviets. quit thinking in Cold War terms. Russian people should be our friends.
@ultimateOne I was proposing a peace plan rather than sending weapons
@bodhibrian yes, Dems refuse to ensure  honest elections through proper ID which would prevent double voting &amp; voting by illegal immigrants
