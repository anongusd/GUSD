Also on that 9th tweet, I of course meant Denise with an S. Also George Sheldon, who was DCFS Director for most of the Rauner administration resigned abruptly in 2017 after a bunch of horrible cases like Semaj Crosby’s got media attention.
An addendum: last week DCFS was in the news again after a Decatur mother was arrested for "leaving her 2-year-old daughter to starve and freeze to death amid filthy, rodent-infested conditions in their home." even after prior contact with DCFS/foster care https://t.co/MQjS76Lmj9
11/11) There's a whole lot more in the story about the absolutely disgusting ways in which children died, even after DCFS contact. Please read and share. And also think about subscribing.
10/11) The Pritzker administration is quick to point out that it added extra funding in @GovPritzker's proposed budget - enough to add 126 caseworkers. The agency spox told me yesterday that it's already trying to move away from private agency caseworkers.
9/11) Another huge thing about DCFS: Since Gov. Blagojevich's first year in office, 2003, the agency has had 11 directors in 16 years. @GovPritzker is conducting a nationwide search for the next one. The names are below. 2 under Blago, 5 under Quinn, 4 under Rauner (some overlap) https://t.co/Uf2WogjVLQ
8/11)...for $100 and $50 gift cards to be awarded to the caseworker who closed the most cases. Seriously. https://t.co/1LiRCvOUAC (h/t @capitolfax).
7/11) The Joliet field office has been in the media before...nearly two years ago, 17-month-old Semaj Crosby was found dead under a couch even after DCFS had been involved with her family. @deldeib, @poolcar4 and @garyjmarx also reported on a contest out of that office...
6/11) ...and don't necessarily have a ton of real-world training. But it would also seem that staffing issues and caseloads have a lot to do with it. The IG referred me to an anonymous letter sent from the Joliet field office (and also sent to news media) that details the issue. https://t.co/DZcO98Kr29

4/11) ...this phenomenon? The IG said it could just be because family cases are increasingly complicated. Neglect is harder to detect than an outright injury (black eye). Another possibility? Many caseworkers are contracted through private agencies: 80 percent of foster care...
3/11) ...the caseworker couldn't find hard and fast evidence that a child was endangered. That's called an "unfounded" investigation, and those are on the rise. Spoke with the DCFS IG yesterday, who wrote the report, and she agreed that was concerning. What might be causing...

1/11) That Inspector General report that's made news lately - what made news is that 98 children died in FY 2018 while in DCFS care/having contact with the agency (family was receiving services, etc).

.@StateRepAmmons (D-Urbana), one of a shrinking caucus of downstate Dems, gives the argument against regionalizing the min wage. Though those in favor of regionalization say downstate economies can't absorb $15/hr, Ammons says why should workers in her district be paid less?
Interesting exchange between Reps @mbatinick (R-Plainfield) and @WillGuzzardi (D-Chicago) regarding studies Dems are relying on: Batinick says he recently talked to temp agency boss who said tons of Chicagoans are going to suburbs for work as a result of Chi min wage increase.

@Wirepoints And also if I’m going to call out casual sexism, I’m also going to use the opportunity to bring attention to the way sexism/classism is manifested in the same way, when someone who traditionally holds the power in a society don’t listen to those who speak in a colloquial way.
@Wirepoints I’m not saying that in our exchange you weren’t listening. I was saying that in general, the attitude that young women shouldn’t say like can be extrapolated to those other things.
@Wirepoints @kylehillman @Amanda_Kass It is about the 1970 IL Con Con. What I’m saying is that I don’t think it should be dismissed or regarded as a “waste” of resources to dive into those docs. No one thinks it’s a waste to dive into history about our nation’s founding.
Actually, I’m nearly six years out of undergrad and I think I’m doing pretty okay! (Even despite my ~*~rampant~*~ use of “like”) 	Also, what disadvantages young women is men who will only listen if a woman speaks a certain way. Same is true of institutionalized racism/classism. https://t.co/KMrfrtBhjq
@Wirepoints @kylehillman @Amanda_Kass Listen, I get the POV that the state’s finances are on fire so why care about history/Con Con? But I don’t think anyone would say the same about the founding of the nation. History is instructive, even if it doesn’t mean we find the direct solution there.
@Wirepoints @kylehillman @Amanda_Kass Are you making fun of my use of “like” ?? Because that’s, like, very 2003!		I don’t begrudge you, because I also find certain tics or trends in the English language annoying. But may I submit this in defense: https://t.co/4OFcupcUQB

9/9) Plus, the Rauner administration appealed this (Nov 2017) decision to the IL Supreme Court, but the court in March declined to hear it. Rauner said a week later that he was pretty sure the state could find money to pay the workers.		Anyway, that's what I spent my weekend on.
8/9) ...didn't have to pay AFSCME members a 2-percent wage increase bargained for in 2011 because of lack of appropriations. The court DID leave open the door just a sliver for a "more appropriate" test case of appropriations for pay steps, but said this one wasn't it.
7/9) Of course it's super frustrating not to know what that number is right now. It's going to blow a hole in the FY19 state budget (that already had a few holes). But the appellate court said in no uncertain terms that this situation is different than one where the state...
6/9) The "debt" (estimates vary, but one solid-ish? number is $415M) is still accruing until the employees are put back on their pay steps (within a few weeks). The interest (remember 7 percent!) is still accruing until that $415M or whatever in back wages is paid to workers.
5/9) ...the only other avenue Rauner had for cutting off the accrual of money owed to the AFSCME members who'd missed a pay step was blocked. Had a declaration of impasse been upheld, then the money would have stopped accruing on Jan. 8, 2016. But it didn't.
4/9) ...and in the meantime refused to put them back on the pay steps, **the money would have to be paid out anyway** WITH 7 percent interest! 	B/c another appellate decision in Oct (Rauner never appealed) found that his declaration of impasse with AFSCME in contract talks...
3/9) Last wk, reporters and pundits (including myself) framed Pritzker's announcement as a "reward" for AFSCME. But what was missing was that whether Pritzker put those 20,000+ state workers back on their pay steps today or pulled a Rauner and cut them out of the next contract...
2/9) ...re-reading the appellate court decision that had found the freeze of pay steps during contract negotiations to be illegal, plus the order that should have forced the Rauner administration to pay. The truth for Pritzker is a lot more boring than being a hero or villain...
1/9) Last week after saying he would put AFSCME members back on their pay steps that had been frozen during the Rauner years, @GovPritzker was painted as both a hero to working folks and a villain, overspending already — depending on who you asked.

@chasejohn @akeefe @JBPritzker Most recent thing that comes to mind! It’s a rare thing, which is good. Though of course if Mendoza wins the mayoral race, it’ll be less rare, for that office at least.
On his way out, @GovRauner vetoes 6 bills, including one sponsored by now-retired Maj Ldr Barbara Flynn Currie (D-Chi) that would’ve made it possible for anyone to run for Cook Co Board Pres if there’s a vacancy (like @toniforchicago winning mayor), not just current board members https://t.co/e8yGuRnA3t

@Norseman_IL I couldn’t quite hear but I think Madigan abstained from voting for himself?
Big standing ovation from Republicans onstage when Durkin says his caucus stands for “fair maps” for legislative redistricting, which he mentioned @JBPritzker has also committed to (though the definition of “fair maps” is pretty amorphous)
@JCB_Journo Oh no he definitely referred to him as the “great philosopher Yogi Berra”
But Durkin lists the challenges facing Illinois: outmigration, property taxes, crime, crumbling infrastructure. However “today is a day of hope...we wish to work collaboratively and thoughtfully.”
@Norseman_IL Omg
Durkin up now, jokes quoting Yogi Berra “it’s deja vu all over again” referring to vote on Speaker. Very upbeat.
“Some might say as we put and end to these last four years, let’s just close the book. Let me suggest something a little better...let’s think in terms of closing chapter in the book, take lessons from that chapter and move onto new chapter where people work with people.”
Madigan says that while Illinois did make it through the budget impasse, there were so many unacknowledged victims of the impasse. “For the last four years, people working with people has not happened...we simply got a series of ultimatums.”
Madigan says that “four long years ago” he pledged to work together with @GovRauner. “Four long years of character assassination...personal vilification...my way or the highway.”
Madigan tells colleagues to please keep newly retired Majority Leader Barbara Flynn Currie in their prayers, as she felt so ill traveling back to Chicago from Springfield yesterday that she checked herself into a Bloomington hospital with severe pneumonia.
Again, my phone is garbage but here’s @LisaMadigan swearing in father Speaker Mike Madigan to yet another term in the role. “Congratulations, you’re the Speaker again.” https://t.co/PoRbP8qIhu
As threatened, new Dem Rep @TeamStavaMurray votes present on vote for Madigan’s speakership.
We’re currently in the middle of the M’s on the Speaker roll call vote and wow yes there are a lot. https://t.co/t5c0X0UAC5
Jim Durkin votes for himself for Speaker, laughter ensues.
Meanwhile https://t.co/2ynOtTo0mx
Rep Charles Meier (R-Okawville) says that Durkin once visited the Meier family farm and “even drove the combine. I can tell you he’s much more suited to being the Speaker of the House than being a farmer.” hahaha
Whoa https://t.co/COC7LQgpvL
Republican Rep Deanne Mazzochi’s nonination for Durkin as speaker takes a more negative tone, obliquely referring to Madigan without naming him. “Durkin doesn’t force votes through fear of retribution.”
Describes Durkin as a “kind yet fierce leader.” Also says that as the rep of a rural district (Savanna, IL), the state of IL isn’t helping rural economies. https://t.co/NXtxbO2U0u

Welch says Madigan is a speaker who listens to both Democrats and Republicans. Next up is to second the nomination is Rep Natalie Manley, who tells the story of a constituent who got benefits from the community care program, which was threatened by budget impasse.
@WILLJimMeadows @willpublicmedia @thedailylineIL Hi Jim! Hope you’re well!!
.@RepChrisWelch officially nominates Speaker Mike Madigan to again serve as speaker - a position he’s held since 1982, minus two years in the mid-90s. Welch says Madigan’s leadership was essential during “epic struggle,” alluding to Rauner years. “We didn’t waver.”

...which allows the $$ to be spent on political or gov't purposes, given away to charity or be returned to donors. Anyway, just interesting. Also, then freshman State Sen. Barack Obama was one of the drivers of the 1998 bill, better known for changing gift rules from lobbyists

...Barbara Flynn Currie (D-Chicago) had $166,944 in her account as of that date. Ousted Rep. Dan Burke (D-Chicago) had $94,450 in his committee as of June 30, 1998 — not nearly as much as brother Ald. Burke with $2.4 million on that date. In the old days, that $$ was used...
The amount a PAC had in it as of June 30, 1998 is the limit of cash that can be taken for personal use. Rep. Patti Bellock (R-Hinsdale), who was appointed to DHFS this summer, had only $240.47 in her account as of that magic date. But others, like retiring majority leader...
From Monday: there's a small club of eight retiring lawmakers (counting Lou Lang) whose campaign funds existed before June 30, 1998, and are thus grandfathered in under a 1999 law that allows just those folks to take a portion of their campaign cash for personal use. https://t.co/CFqOx7DJ4A

Also one small correction: the bill that ended up becoming law applied to people who were certified as part of a bargaining unit after Dec. 2, 2008, not people who were hired after that date.
Update: someone who was very much in the know in 2011 called to tell me that there was a limit on how many people could be removed because an original bill (https://t.co/mWqz1E1yON) had no limit, but it died, so it needed to be negotiated with a limit. https://t.co/daio190pV5
@chasejohn Thank you!
PQ also should've fixed the merit pay issue, and why did that law they eventually passed have a weird 2008 thing and a limit on how many people could be removed? Maybe it's a legal thing I don't understand. I wasn't here yet so idk (but if you DO understand why, let me know!)
...but also people are pretty darn annoyed at the Rauner administration for the lack of a new AFSCME contract more than four years after the last one expired. The two sides are stuck in a legal battle to figure out if they were even at an impasse when one was declared in 2017.
Oh, here's one final thought. Yesterday @GovRauner didn't like when I asked him about the current level of unionization six months after Janus v. AFSCME. It stands to reason that AFSCME would work hard to get people on board after a union-weakening ruling...
11) Idk, this whole thing is very odd and maybe no one cares, but I thought it was a super interesting rabbit hole yesterday. 		Please subscribe, the end.
10) So who's to blame? As always, it's not a simple answer. Blagojevich, obviously, for killing the merit pay program. Blago also approved via exec order that SEIU would represent home health &amp; childcare workers in 2003 and 2005, which did contribute to the uptick in unionization
9) Anyway, Rauner also claimed yesterday that IL's current 93% government unionization level is a record high. That's not quite right. In 2011, Illinois was at 96%, and that figure could've been as high as 99% if all the employees' petitions to the ILRB to unionize were approved.
8) So now, Rauner's admin is seeking the removal of up to 2,500 people from union eligibility. AFSCME says Rauner's going after folks who are perfectly eligible to collectively bargain, like nurses. But since neither AFSCME, Rauner nor ILRB could provide petitions, I don't know.
7) But that bill had a few catches. First, it only applied to people hired after Dec 2, 2008 (so, in the waning days of Blago). Second, it only allowed for PQ's admin to remove 3,580 employees. Ultimately, he only removed 1,700.
6) Eventually when legislative liaisons began unionizing, the General Assembly saw that the issue had gotten out of hand. So starting in 2011, through 2012 and into 2013, Dems and Pat Quinn negotiated a bill that would remove those folks from eligibility for collective bargaining
5) ...when he signed the "card check" unionization law in August 2003, which allows for state employees who want to be represented by a union to only show that a majority of the group signed onto the union, as opposed to a secret ballot election.
4) But like, can you blame these people? They were doing what economically made sense for their bottom line. Were they technically not supposed to be able to join the union per the Illinois Labor Relations Act? Yeah, but another Blago move made it easier for them...
3) I found that, yes, Blago's wage freeze (and effective pay cut for making these folks pick up their own pension tab - 4% of their salary) did make it so that joining AFSCME was a much more attractive option...after all, unionized employees got a ~30% pay increase from 03 to 09
2) Yesterday Rauner blamed Blagojevich and Pat Quinn for this unionization of mid-level supervisors, managers and other "confidential" employees, known as "merit compensation" employees. I'd never heard of this so I did some Googling.
1) Who's responsible for the fact that some mid-level managers within state government are unionized? Turns out, it's not just simple cronyism like @GovRauner implied yesterday. It's a complicated tale about how Rod Blagojevich is still affecting Illinois to this day. https://t.co/I6jzmvrWb5

#Tobacco21 comes up nine votes short to override @GovRauner’s veto; classic whistling during voting ensues when a disliked bill is voted down. https://t.co/wFwwqFvaEn
After doubt that the bill would even get called, #Tobacco21 is up on the House floor now. I'm told there are five yes votes absent. The IL Amer Cancer Society knows it likely won't pass, but wanted to call the bill anyway after the Senate narrowly voted to override Gov's veto.

PS: it was fun going back into my archives again to find photos from when I was a baby intern reporter.

As I reported back then: sigs cost $1.75 each https://t.co/qp7BnyDOst https://t.co/tvSFkuh8C3
But one Republican I talked to, @RepTimButler (R-Springfield), told me he's willing to keep fighting for term limits, but acknowledged it's difficult to keep top of mind w voters without $$ behind a public information campaign (like @BruceRauner did in both '14 and '16 with PACs)
Rauner made term limits his rallying cry for five years. But the idea, while popular with voters, is privately disliked even by many Repubs, and of course didn't get all that far in '14 or '16. So will anyone pick up where Gov left off? Some GOP says leave it alone for a while. https://t.co/hr8b3tvFS6

@MikeYelovich @jrosenbaum Ah right, just making sure I wasn’t missing something!
@MikeYelovich @jrosenbaum But what was the party supposed to do, abandon its de facto head? Plus every complaint I heard was that Rauner didn’t give enough to down-ballot races. I’m likely ignorant to a lot of the infrastructure at play, but what did the party do for Rauner that was a resource-drain?
@ErikWallenius Well yes, that’s definitely true, but then the national GOP was on the up and up since then. Also they’re been an undeniable seismic shift in the Trump era.
@rap30 Didn’t even make that connection, but yeah.
@jrosenbaum I feel like the geography of the state begets these types of politicians, though; not the other way around. Same thing with Missouri, though obviously with vastly different results.
@jrosenbaum But some Republicans worry that if they let downstate lead, then you get a state party that’s galvanized to the right, and that demographic changes will eventually kill them anyway. They think the answer is figuring out what makes the suburbs tick.
@OswegoWilly Oh for sure. It’s definitely not a perfect model. We are hamstrung in several areas in comparison.
Maaaajor difference, though - apparently California has a $14B surplus! Didn't even know that was possible. That is decidedly not Illinois' story. (though lots of people in the past have pointed to California as a model on how to repair IL's finances...)
Not only was there an identical headline here in IL (“RIP, Illinois GOP”) But also an Illinois Republican told me nearly the same thing - that the party “needed” a wake-up call in order to rebuild. Just interesting; maybe IL and CA Repubs can look to each other in this time? https://t.co/EeOUM2zTx4

.@KwameRaoul says he came out of a primary that was “truly an embarrassment of riches.” But says he appreciated his Dem primary opponents for making him a better candidate. One of those Dem opponents is @renato_mariotti - here tonight. Talked to him earlier and he praised Raoul.
.@KwameRaoul says he wants “to commend @ErikaHarold...she’s a smart lawyer.” Says it’s an unfortunate reality that campaigns communicate via ads (Raoul’s against Harold’s were especially tough on her social views) https://t.co/9hchNqMikt
.@KwameRaoul starts by talking about 14 years ago on Nov 6 when he was chosen to replace Barack Obama in the IL Senate. Praises @LisaMadigan for her time as attorney general. He jokes that he’s tired of having these “big shoes to fill.” https://t.co/tahWQnhhfd
Madigan says @KwameRaoul “has sponsored more of my legislation in the Senate than” anyone else. “Kwame is a public servant at heart.” Says she knows Raoul will join other Dem AGs from day 1 [doesnt say against Trump but it’s implied]

Anyway, I definitely didn’t need to write 3,000 words on it but I did. Began thinking about it when I realized @RaunerChicken was still tweeting 4.5 years after this happened. RC graciously agreed to talk with me for this story! https://t.co/g1NAEWtROF
Characters personify and stunts distill messages. Take the Blagojevich character that Republicans have used against Dems for years - it’s particularly prescient to use against @JBPritzker given the wiretap phone calls between the two. https://t.co/uYIzTmXTF4
...should they be used all the time? Obviously not. But they rarely end up on the mainstream news unless for color or on the rare occasion it becomes the story itself. Is it “shallow” campaigning? Maybe. But aren’t campaigns in general shallow?
In front of our paywall so you can read while you’re playing the Election Day waiting game! Do campaign characters and stunts signal that politicians and staff think the electorate is dumb? That’s what one researcher told me, but I’m not so sure... https://t.co/AHbGHX6kh9

Well then. https://t.co/g7Z7JXfULp

Newest @JBPritzker ad uses @BruceRauner's own words against him...videotape of Rauner saying late in the 2014 campaign: “give me four years, and I’ll say to the voters, ‘throw me out of office in four years if I don’t deliver results.’” https://t.co/A1P6Qq3Bj6
Though all ballots were printed with the term limit Q, the outcome of Quinn’s appeal to the IL Supreme Court will determine whether votes on the issue count or not.

.@BruceRauner’s campaign has already been using the toilet issue against @JBPritzker for months.

Newly minted @GovRauner pushed for this idea hard in his first yr in office, but only the Village of Lincolnshire ever actually passed an ordinance in late 2015.

The @ilgop is, however, heavily supporting third-party candidate @HalSenate after he was forced off the ballot in a petition challenge. Though Hal Patton has to overcome explaining why he can't run as a Republican, the GOP still believes he's a powerful enough candidate to win.
When a Holocaust denier slipped unnoticed onto the ballot running for Congress as a Republican, the @ilgop said it tried, but couldn't stop him. Now @JWHforCongress is running in that race as an independent. The GOP says it'll support him, but won't commit to any funding. https://t.co/jotwgOlGU4

Yesterday @BruceRauner said the election is about “good vs evil” and said the Democrats were the party of darkness. This morning, @MikeforIllinois says Republicans are the party of darkness and Democrats are the party of light.
Senate President John Cullerton tells the crowd that @brucerauner's campaign slogan is "Home is worth fighting for." But quips that Rauner's got nine homes and seems to be confused which one he's fighting for.
House Spkr Mike Madigan (Also head of IL Dem Party) starts off program reminding party faithful that @GovRauner “held hostage” the budget for 2+ years in order to put in place items from his turnaround agenda. Crowd boos after every mention of an “extreme” item. https://t.co/fbhPvI1eff

.@BruceRauner calls the Republican Party “the party of America.” Also says Erika Harold “will prosecute corruption” but stops short of saying again that Harold will prosecute House Spkr Mike Madigan. https://t.co/KilY60x7tP
Crowd responds well to @ErikaHarold - better than other GOP speakers so far. She’s the only millennial statewide candidate of either party.

Senate GOP Leader Bill Brady (R-Bloomington) says he's aiming for the Senate Republicans to pick up 7 seats. Democrats have retained a supermajority in Senate though GOP knocked off Dem supermajority in House.

Durkin: "The primary is over...you win with addition, not subtraction." Durkin says House GOP needs to pick up nine more seats (which @BruceRauner used to say, but hasn't promised lately w specificity). However, Durkin might have difficult time if any @DanProft candidates win

.@BruceRauner says he’s going to give “a lot” $$ but can’t do it alone “everyone needs to chip in.” Says @JBPritzker is trying to buy political office - same criticism Rauner himself got in 2014.
I said earlier that “Trump” likely won’t be mentioned at all today. “Madigan,” however, is a winning buzz word (more specifically the demonizing of the Dem leader). I should’ve started counting. I’m sure it’s at least 25 by now.

Guess despite their feud last winter after a @Suntimes investigation, Rauner and Tillman are brought together by their long-held desire to see this decision weaken public sector unions: https://t.co/JV1WkhziQR https://t.co/spu5GFMZEX
...eg: contract negotiations and representing public sector employees in arbitration. However, IL state worker Mark Janus (and @GovRauner, the original plaintiff on the suit) argued that those things were inherently political, and thus the fair share fees were "forced speech."
Janus v AFSCME is the follow-up to 2014's decision in Harris v Quinn (another IL-originated case) in which the court struck down mandated union dues (which go to political activity), but stopped short on "fair share" fees, which unions argue go toward the welfare of workers
Breaking: Supreme Court sides with Illinois state worker Mark Janus in his (and @GovRauner's) case against AFSCME. "Fair share" union fees are deemed unconstitutional, a First Amendment violation, parting with 41 years of caselaw. Opinion: https://t.co/vCIOvwuxnt

When asked if he thinks this will hurt his reelection chances in Nov: "I will tell you this is nothing. The allegations are absurd. I'm running in November," @StateRepLouLang says.
"Not a single person behind me said anything about the allegations. They were talking about me," @StateRepLouLang says. He was asked how dragging up a bunch of powerful women behind him doesn't hurt the process of someone who might come forward with allegations.
"If I have $170 million somewhere, help me find it," @StateRepLouLang quips, brushing off the allegations of a bribe he was alleged to have been offered. https://t.co/6SHOOTS9yQ
.@repwillis77 speaks on behalf of seatmate @StateRepLouLang "This is a man that works for women on many, many levels. This is something we need to keep in mind on this...I'm looking forward to seeing his name cleared on this."
Tiffany Elking(sp?) is a lobbyist speaking on behalf of @StateRepLouLang says “he has become a mentor to me without asking anything in return.” Also says he has stood up for women. “I’ve never seen him display any unfair behavior or target or harass women.” https://t.co/2YNwxMlCxr

.@SaraFeigenholtz says she's not an apologist for anyone but the process needs to play out. Says Lang has had a wonderful career.
Rep @SaraFeigenholtz: says we need to believe women but "In all the years I've been here I've had many differences with Lou Lang...and very often behind closed doors we have worked out our differences. He has served me as a great mentor..."
.@StateRepLouLang, who was earlier accused of harassing an medical marijuana, in turn accuses Maryann Loncar of seeking to profit off of medical marijuana https://t.co/wMFnJx7Uo0
But not from the General Assembly altogether. Loncar says that proves he’s absolutely guilty. https://t.co/FFopYhQBmA
Denise Rotheimer says she was the one who found out about the female senator who was threatened/harassed by Lou Lang. Says the lawmaker was allegedly told her bills would never pass “because [he] doesn’t like what she said.”
Loncar says the info she knows about involves a bribe to @StateRepLouLang and two other senators of $170M. But when we reporters say it sounds more like a contract, she says no
“Look at the chain of command here, it’s incestuous,” @StateRepLouLang accuser Maryann Loncar says. She says that’s why she’s afraid of going to local law enforcement/state’s attorney
Denise Rotheimer, who accused Sen Ira Silverstein (D-Chicago) of harassment in November, says that through the process of speaking out, she learned who the trusted people are. Legislative inspector general concluded there was no official misconduct but Silverstein lost primary
“It’s all about power all the time, @RepMcDermed says. “Governing, if any, is secondary.” Says there’s sex-based bullying, racial bullying...also party lines bullying to minority GOP in General Assembly. Implores more members to step forward.
“This is a leader who very hypocritically sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment yesterday,” @JeanneIves says of @StateRepLouLang. Says he’s known to be a bully.
.@JeanneIves steps in to talk about the legislative inspector general process, which she believes is totally inadequate. “She could make a complaint every day and it wouldn’t matter...she wouldn’t have any participation in the process.”
Maryann Loncar: “I’ve been a Democrat my whole life, folks.” She says when she’s asked if it’s a political issue. Rep @JeanneIves rep Margo McDermed and Denise Rotheimer, who are standing with her, are avowed Republicans.
“There’s a disabled man by the name of Mike Graham who has also been targeted by him,” Lancor says of @StateRepLouLang
Okay so the lawmaker that’s also been allegedly harassed by @StateRepLouLang is a state senator. Lancor also says there are others “who am I kidding”
“I know insider information I shouldn’t have been privy to,” Lancor says when asked why @StateRepLouLang went after her. But she doesn’t want to share what that insider info is.
Also alleges @StateRepLouLang once put his hand on her lower back. ALSO alleges Lang once called her ex-husband and said he was offering his services to “bury her any way he could.” Said her ex warned her
Loncar is asked to be specific about what happened. Loncar is an advocate for medical marijuana. Says @StateRepLouLang exchanged a nonprofit bill for a profit bill Loncar says was “rifled with corruption.” Then when she refused to go along with it, says he blackballed her
“It’s really bad down here and the only ones who are going to fix it are the citizens of Illinois. We can’t leave it up to their judgment and their bills,” Loncar says/
“I’m somebody’s mother, I’m somebody’s sister, I’m somebody’s daughter,” Loncar says very emotionally.
Loncar says another legislator has received abuse but “isn’t brave enough” to come forward.
“You are the press. You see it. Every single woman in this room has been subject to what I have been subjected to,” Loncar says of the alleged abuse she received from @StateRepLouLang
“When you come from the south side of Chicago they make sure they come after you,” Loncar says. Loncar says she grew up very near Madigan...same zip code. Part of why she’s been afraid to come out with her story.
“Was I going to go to the Spkr who sits right next to Lou Lang? Was I going to go to the ethics committee, which Lou Lang sits on?” Maryann Loncar asks.
“Many of you that stand here today (meaning us in the media) have witnessed” behavior, accuser Maryann Loncar says. Says no one has listened to her story for years
Maryann Loncar getting emotional when she says she has “everything to lose” by coming down to Springfield to accuse @StateRepLouLang of harassment, intimidation, humiliation and blackballing
Here is the entire press release https://t.co/eUQFjARSSY

Lang also hearkens back to something Rep. David Harris (R-Arlington Heights) said earlier...joked that he didn't know that Illinois was part of the old Confederacy, since the other states that have not passed the ERA are in the South. Harris is a GOP yes vote on ERA.
.@StateRepLouLang in closing: "Tt’s not a bill about whether we’re going to do this thing or that thing…This is about the United States Constitution, people. And half the people in this country aren’t in it. They aren’t included in the US Constitution" Also thanks @Andersson4Rep
.@RepStratton5 last speaker. “The ERA would stand in the way of sex discrim in the military, ensuring that women are able to serve their nation to the best of their ability…particularly important for African American women who enlist in military at significantly higher rates..."
Rep. @Dan_Brady (R-Bloomington) is another GOP vote for the ERA. “I am a pro-life representative with a strong pro-life voting record. and after this vote is done, i will continue to be a pro-life representative with a strong pro-life voting record.”

.@ChrisWelch_JD: "We have a president who, if he could gut the Civil Rights Amendment of 1965, he would do it and do it now...I would rather rely on our U.S. Constitution than a law Donald Trump can [disassemble]. A man who hates women! He has no respect for women."

Rep @LitesaWallace is very emotional, crying while she stands and addresses the chamber. "I just continue to be disappointed at the fact that we parse out everything and we refuse to recognize intersectionality not just in this debate but in damn near every debate," she says.
Rep Tom Morrison (R-Machesney Park) warns doctors could risk losing licenses under ERA if they refuse to perform abortions or refer women to someone who will “I can be argued that they are discriminating against procedure that only women would be seeking.”
Flowers also voted against same sex marriage in 2013 and I’ll definitely never forget her performance in that debate. https://t.co/AsWuZk7WXc
.@Andersson4Rep from earlier: "I want to empower [women] because the better they are, the better we are as a people. And they are fully up to the challenge. They don’t need my help, my protection.” He's a GOP yes vote on the ERA. But also not running for his seat again.
It's been a lively debate so far. Choice quotes...	@JeanneIves: "Women will not be protected until men decide to protect them and decide to stop the sexual harassment, decide to stop domestic abuse…what we need is great men to stand up and protect women. and this body knows it."
Five minutes each, no limit on how many speakers. IN CASE you cared about parliamentary procedure! Which maybe you do, who am I to say?
For five minutes each. Which would be 50 minutes by itself. If they do unlimited debate, definitely well over an hour. https://t.co/tYU9zlZjN2
Okay so. Lang acknowledges there will be court battles over ERA if one more state ratifies after IL (again if)... Conservative Rep. Peter Breen (R-Lombard) is asking for unlimited debate. Breen and other conservatives worry about abortion issue if ERA passes.
I guess it’s really happening. Lou Lang is introducing the Equal Rights Amendment on the House floor. All Dems are now here (had been an absence earlier) and there are some Republican votes. Senate passed it last month.

.@andymanar notes that no school district gets less money in this budget (how many times did we hear about "winners and losers" last summer during school funding fight) and also budget doesn't account for any shifting of pension costs, which @GovRauner had proposed.
.@SenChapinRose (R-Mahomet) Says that past two months has had "far less partisanship and rancor than a long time." Also says that this year's education formula effort is his higher ed working group's six-bill package, which I wrote about yesterday https://t.co/mUrc1dPV7X
Official assumed revenue the budget is based on is $38.52 billion “this is a good faith estimate on the part of budget negotiators to come to an agreement," @AndyManar says. @SenatorSteans says it's a "truly bipartisan" effort. And they're not wrong. It's been a long, long time.
Medicaid is one of biggest slices of IL budget pie. That'll be $7.9B from IL's pocket, then combined with other funds (including federal) it's $24.2B for HumanFamily Services.
OKay so we have a total of $38.5B in general revenue funds. That's an increase of $1.1B over FY18 (current year), @andymanar says. Preschool-12th grade education is $8.3Billion.

Statement from Spkr Madigan on the resolution for a graduated income tax. In recent history (four+ years) he never publicly supported this effort til like a month ago. Earlier he’d said he wanted a “millionaires tax” specifically designed to annoy then-candidate turned @GovRauner
After more than an hour of debate, *non-binding resolution* for a graduated income tax passes (but barely) https://t.co/la55FVp1IB
See my last tweet about campaign season. https://t.co/KIimSrqNel
The fact that it's a *non-binding resolution* doesn't matter in campaign season! (I guess more so in primary season but hey). @JBPritzker's support of a graduated tax has allowed for more serious discussion of the issue than in years. https://t.co/qXYaoZPvaI

Civil liberties concerns cut both ways. Support is bipartisan but opposition is also bipartisan. @RepAnnWilliams up now, warning that the bill allows "unchecked" surveillance. Though drone cameras may not be advanced enough yet, facial recognition likely coming, she said.
Oh also, an announcement that @JeanneIves is excused for the rest of the day is met with light applause.
Sponsors say the bill can identify public safety risks within large crowds (like music festivals). Say it's inspired by Las Vegas shooter (who had reportedly checked out Lollapalooza last summer). Opponents say it opens door gov't to spy without court order. https://t.co/amhAPYZwUk
