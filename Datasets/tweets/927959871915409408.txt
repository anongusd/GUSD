@MrsKarrieT @ABC @BarackObama There is no need to convince me of anything, the facts are already on the table 😂 and I don’t care who you support, we can agree to disagree, that’s the fun in a debate 🙂 you have a good night 😜 sleep tight and don’t let the bedbugs bite 😂😂
@MrsKarrieT @ABC @BarackObama It’s Common Sense, (I notice you didn’t mention that), I’m replying to your comments on my post. Just because I’m replying doesn’t mean I care, even you should know that 😜 it’s entertainment 🙃There’s nothing wrong with a good debate 🙂 and your bank account is not my concern
@MrsKarrieT @ABC @BarackObama I can care less about your 2 cents because it’s nothing compared to the common sense I have and dollars in my pocket book 😂😂 And besides, that’s what makes America great, you are able to put your 2 cents in whether I give a fuck or not. And just so we are clear, I don’t 😜😉
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson What the Russians did was an attacking on our constitutional and our system, yet you haven’t said anything about that
@MrsKarrieT @ABC @BarackObama You say go back which is funny because I never left 😂😂 and he doesn’t belong to me lol his wife’s name is @MichelleObama
@MrsKarrieT @ABC @BarackObama You mad 😂😂
@MrsKarrieT @ABC @BarackObama I don’t believe I was talking to you. Go put your MAGA Hat and continue to kiss Trumps ass, in the mean time I’m going to focus on helping save our democracy.
@johncardillo You forgot..	@realDonaldTrump, his kids, Manafort, Flynn, Stone, Cohn, and all the rest of the people who Colluded with Russia.
@CNN Women are the back bone of this country, it’s about time someone realizes that. Look at @SpeakerPelosi, strong, independent, classy, we know how to get the job done.
@siano2020 Hell he will sell whatever the hell he can get his hands on. He doesn’t give a damn about those kids.
@washingtonpost I don’t even care to read this. He opinion is irrelevant.
@siano2020 😂😂😂 He ean out of shit to say 😂😂 @realDonaldTrump put him back in his dog cage 😂
@TheEconomist His Ego is to small to accept the deal and move on. There are so many other things that he can focus on. I wish he would turn the page already.
@ABC We miss you @BarackObama Please come back 😭
@BillOReilly Hell he is responsible for the collapse of journalism everywhere. Other countries take America’s lead and now we hear Fake New all over the place. I have never seen a President who doesn’t care about what America really means.
@seanhannity I don’t even like @realDonaldTrump but he did what was in the best interest of our country and I applaud him for that. I just hope he doesn’t fuck up this moment by calling for a national emergency.
@AnnCoulter I wish you stf up already 😡 You should be happy he signed the bill, it will help the people who watch your wack ass show stay above water. It’s people like you who stop @realDonaldTrump from making decisions that are in the best interest of the country, fuck the politics!
@seanhannity This shit is ridiculous 😕
@senatemajldr It’s about time you stopped kissing Donald Trump’s ass.
@mitchellreports @realDonaldTrump Wow 😕 That’s all I can say to that.
@realDonaldTrump 😂😂 You are so hilarious 😂😂 Now it’s boarder security 😂😂 It’s okay to switch up you words, your base won’t know the difference 😜
@realDonaldTrump They didn’t do it for you dumb ass, they did it for us. No one wanted another shutdown.
@realDonaldTrump If so, why are you so mad? 🤔
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Well if that’s the case, I’ll take “Release the Muller Report” for 1000 Mr. Barr. I believe we will all have a piece of mind then Don. You should too 🙂 there was “No Collusion”, (in @realDonaldTrump voice), Remember?
@realDonaldTrump Let’s be honest, we all know that you put that up there so your base won’t chew you out 😂 I could give 10 fucks about that stupid ass wall. I know for a fact that our MILITARY has our backs, Hell they are our wall.
@realDonaldTrump 😂😂 Please, You are only saying that to make yourself feel better, it’s ok don’t cry 😢 😂😂 but I must confess, I still find it puzzling 🤔 how you convinced your base that Mexico would pay for it when in all actuality the money is coming out of our pocket books and wallets.
@realDonaldTrump Speaking of dollars, tax payers spent millions on the Muller Investigation. I’m hoping we can see the how our money was spent. If there was “No Collusion” (in your voice), tell the new attorney general to release the final report! You have nothing to worry about 😉
@realDonaldTrump Well at least he wasn’t apart of the Russian Collusion scandal. More than half of you teams has dirt on their hands because of that, including your kids.
@realDonaldTrump And ya, let’s not forget about @JamesComeyFBI. But He didn’t leave by choice, you fired him because of the whole “Russia Thing”, Remember?
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse It’s a good thing your dumb ass signed it
@realDonaldTrump Wow 😮 , you actually care about someone other than yourself🤭
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @PressSec That money can be spent on things we really need! Infrastructure, Education and so much more. What in the hell is wrong with you? Is your Ego that small? It won’t hurt to do something that is in country’s best interest, and Declaring a National Emergency is not one of them!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson The shit that you do only happens in third world countries.
@seanhannity Hell No! We have the most powerful Army in the world, do you really think they will let a few immigrants destroy our country? It’s ridiculous.
@senatemajldr I hope so. We have the right to see that Final Report of the Muller Investigation. What’s the big deal if there was “NO COLLUSION” in my @realDonaldTrump voice 😁
@seanhannity And what about the man you praise?
@realDonaldTrump Only in your dreams.
@washingtonpost This man is complete and total fucking idiot.
@ChrisCuomo I don’t think it’s old school, I think it’s respectful. My Father giving a man permission to marry me tells me that he knows that man loves me, he trust him with my heart and that he knows that he has my best interest at heart. I’m a Daddy’s girl so his opinion is important to me
@KellyannePolls Tell @realDonaldTrump that. They people are professionals and they know what our border needs to be secured.
@KellyannePolls Where did they find it though? A port of entry RIGHT?? A wall is not necessary, it’s pointless.
@senatemajldr It’s about time you stood up for America and yourself for that matter.
@seanhannity What Scares you most about @realDonaldTrump?
@JudgeJeanine You talk about [Democrats] but what about @realDonaldTrump. Pulling Troops out of Syria, Having private meeting with Putin, Shutting down the government, Surrounding himself with CROOKS, DISRESPECTING our Intelligence Agencies, I can go on for days.
@enews That’s what happens when a African American Woman gives you some Pussy 🤩🤩 😂😂😂😂 he stuck like Chuck 😂😂😂
@CBSNews Let’s throw @realDonaldTrump in the middle of a field with a tank top and shorts on, I bet you he will believe in Climate Change then 😂😂🙂
@MSNBC @MaddowBlog I told you guys that he is a teenager in a 70 year old mans body.
@WABeliever @seanhannity @realDonaldTrump 😂 Smh 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️ I didn’t even catch that. 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ I’m sure you know what I ment 😂😂
@johnlin59 @seanhannity My whole point is, It’s a waste of money.
@hardball All I can do is laugh at this 😂😂
@seanhannity Yet I didn’t hear our directors of national intelligence agencies even mention the southern boarder.
@CBSNews No, you will fuck up the system.
@VP @carlosvecchio @JulioBorges @WhiteHouse @jguaido You seem like a straight forward guy, how could you follow behind @realDonaldTrump
@ananavarro At all.
@ABC It’s about time you do something.
@seanhannity But we can afford to build a wall?
@AnnCoulter You are such a bitch. This is not the 1940’s, 50’s or 60’s. Bitch this is no longer White America. Get used to it 😜
@CBSNews It’s your fault @senatemajldr. You could have passed the spending bill that everyone voted on. Rather than being a leader you decided to kiss @realDonaldTrump’s ass.
@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump You are a fool if you really believe that. He makes decisions on the fly and  allows people like @AnnCoulter to dictate his decisions. Can you explain his in the fly decision about Syria? What about the private meetings with Putin? I think you have him confused with someone else.
@realDonaldTrump This guy is so damn ignorant. He doesn’t even know how Global Warming works. Fucking Idiot.
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @RepGaramendi That is what I feel is necessary.
@CBSNews And I bet there will be people who will still support him.
@maydaymindy9 Don Jr., More than likely it will be Jared.
@nytimes That’s right @SpeakerPelosi Put him in his place!
@CBSNews Looks like Donald Trump his paying his Rent 😂
@AnnCoulter You are so insecure. You have to bully the bull to make yourself feel better.
@youzoob @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump I wish you get over it @AnnCoulter Donald Trump actually did what was in the best interest of the American people. This just goes to show that you don’t give a damn about them.
@GazeWest @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump @anntensity If you are going to defend the man defend him, it makes no sense to constantly talk shit just because YOU can’t get your way.
@AnnCoulter Damn Newt must have really hurt your little Ego, I can’t count how many times you have tweeted about him. That shows your insecurities as a woman.
@DavidBrodyCBN @realDonaldTrump @AnnCoulter @CBNNews @foxandfriends I don’t feel like he caved, that is just a word that everyone is using to throw it in his face. I just feel like he finally took a step as President and did what was in the best interest of the country. (I still don’t like him though.)
@CNN Damn 😕
@washingtonpost It’s pointless. He ever talks about anything other than himself. The only reason he I’m going to watch it is because I want to see everyone’s facial expressions when he is taking.
@AnnCoulter Why are you so desperate for attention. Donald Trump did what was in the best interest of this country when he opened the government, you can stop being a bitch now.
@washingtonpost If he runs Donald will definitely put him and Starburst out of Trump Tower.
RT @FBI: The FBI would like to thank all the individuals, businesses, and organizations that provided support and assistance to our employe…
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You act like a 16 year old teenage girl who can’t stotalking about herself 😂
@seanhannity I don’t understand why he won’t do what’s in the best interest of of the country.
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes You don’t even know the definition of smart. You hope Starbucks is still paying their rent and I’m sure the Russians are expecting theirs on the 1st.
@ChrisCuomo Just more evidence for Mr. Muller @ChrisCuomo
@davidaxelrod He should be embarrassed to go to the state of the union.
@CNN What is American culture? This is a nation full of immigrants there is no culture. We are a Democratic Nation where it’s people have the right to express whatever culture they want.
@GOP @KellyannePolls @KellyannePolls What you need to do is worry more about the man you are married to rather than a man who doesn’t give a damn about you. Loyalty is a one way street with @realDonaldTrump but the loyalty from the man that you are married to is a 2 way street.
@realDonaldTrump It’s not what we portray, it’s what you do that has everyone skeptical.
@CBSNews His Ego is going to get him in a lot of trouble, he is not Beyoncé.
@CNN I wouldn’t either. I’m sure he is feeling some type of way now that the President is trying to “Distance” himself from him. Lol. I bet he isn’t so confident now 😂😂
@CNN This is a damn shame. It’s okay though because this is nothing but more evidence for Mr. Muller.
@realDonaldTrump @johnrobertsFox @GillianHTurner @FoxNews Why do you care so much about what other people think? Not only are you the President of the USA of America but you are also a Grown Ass Man. Are you that insecure with yourself?
@washingtonpost Trump is a damn fool. Is it that serious to keep a campaign promise?
@SpeakerPelosi Ily @SpeakerPelosi. You are the definition of a strong independent woman. You let no one or nothing get in your way of achieving your goals. I feel like you should run for President. You would make an amazing leader.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, you have done more, more illegal shit than any other President in your first 2 years.
@JudgeJeanine @dbongino @ChristopherHahn Damn you tweet more than @realDonaldTrump
@JudgeJeanine What has he done that is in the best interest of our country? In my opinion, the Russians are the one’s benefiting.
@JudgeJeanine Do you realize that you and you coworkers at Fox News are the only ones who are still talking about Hillary Clinton? No one outside of Fox News gives a fuck, we are too focused on the Man in the White House. Don’t you think it’s time you all joined us?
@realDonaldTrump So start telling the truth then
@realDonaldTrump If yu didn’t do anything what are yu so worried about?
RT @CNN: Why the Fed should be worried about deflation | By Stephen Moore for CNN Business Perspectives https://t.co/VbFNuzRto1 https://t.c…
@realDonaldTrump We are more concerned about the people who are suffering and worried about paying their bills.
@ABC I don’t think so she is not as petty as you are.
@ananavarro Girl you might need a Ibuprofen 😂
@ABC I don’t want to hear that shit, handing over that polling data speaks for itself.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Looks like he met his match. Kept treating him like the child he is @SpeakerPelosi. He looks down on woman but he sure allows @AnnCoulter control his every move. It seems as if he listens to her more than his own wife.
@URBANWONKENOBI @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr And she still hasn’t agreed to hand over her check. SmH
@realDonaldTrump I’m surprised you know how to rhyme 😂
@realDonaldTrump Resign as President, Collusion is Evident 😜
@realDonaldTrump What I need you to do is stay in your lane and put America first like you promised. Make America Great Again Remember? Seems to me as if you are making it worse.
@realDonaldTrump You sound stupid.
@CuomoPrimeTime Ily Christopher (in my @KellyannePolls voice) Lol You are one of the most realist.
@PhilipRucker Donald Trump doesn’t even know the meaning of the word truth. If you ask me it seems like he is the one who is scared.
@AaronBlake @washingtonpost I don’t see how he can feel comfortable doing any type of speech when his citizens are in pain. If his is going to give any type of speech it should be about giving these people their money.
@washingtonpost Since when?
@MSNBC @hardball I bet you Russia is loving this.
@AP That’s a damn shame.
@washingtonpost 😮😦
@FaceTheNation @DavidBrodyCBN @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi It’s a shame that a Grown Ass man is this childish and petty.
@ABC You have to @SpeakerPelosi, keep treating him like the child he is!
@CBSNews I pay taxes for what if I can’t get them back
@TheEconomist Wow. He is so ignorant.
@CBSNews Donald Trump doesn’t even know what the meaning of Truth is.
@ElisaDoucet3 @URBANWONKENOBI @senatemajldr So I take it you won’t be handing over your check? I don’t care if he only wanted 1 mile, he has no right to hold our government workers checks hostage. It’s nonsense.
@URBANWONKENOBI @ElisaDoucet3 @senatemajldr How about you give some of our federal workers you paycheck @ElisaDoucet3. Better yet go pay their rent and put food on their tables.
@BillOReilly There are many solutions but how about we open the government first.
@CBSNews Congrats 🎈
@seanhannity It is very sad that our Federal Workers are missing another paycheck because of a shutdown that your president owns.
@realDonaldTrump The #1 thing that you achieved at greatly is Chaos, Discord and Division.
@washingtonpost This bitch needs her ass whooped. We all can’t call on Daddy little girl. These people need to pay their bills and take care of their families.
@ABC Keep treating him like the child he is @SpeakerPelosi
@BillOReilly If you noticed the rules of honesty and civility changed the day Donald Trump decided to run for president. He lies on a daily, now you can’t blame that on the democrats. I have never seen a man be so hateful and disrespectful. It’s scary.
@JudgeJeanine And at least @SpeakerPelosi has class.
@JudgeJeanine And Trump does? Answer this question for me, Would you feel comfortable if you children or grandchildren told you that they wanted to be just like Donald Trump? Are you comfortable with the bullying and disrespect? Are you comfortable with Trump putting Russia first??
@senatemajldr There should not have to be a compromise when it come to people getting their paychecks.
@senatemajldr I need you to put your big boy underwear on and be a man. You cower to Donald Trump’s bullying and it’s pathetic. This shutdown is on you.
@CNN He is soo desperate.
@CBSNews Donald Trump is pathetic
@sbg1 @brianstelter Right!
@KellyannePolls Too bad Donald Trump doesn’t feel the same way.
@BillOReilly Donald Trump doesn’t believe in it. He only believes in it when it is convenient for him
@KamalaHarris Show America what a Strong Black Woman can do.
@realDonaldTrump Can I ask you a question? Why aren’t you concerned about the content of the investigation. Fuck how it started, what about what the Russians did to the country you call yourself loving? Are you not concerned about their interference in our election?
@realDonaldTrump @VP I feel offended
@realDonaldTrump And is that something that you are proud of. Soon China will not have to depend on America because they are investing in so many other countries. America will be here long after you are out of office and you are putting out country in a shithole.
@realDonaldTrump A wall won’t do anything to stop that.
@realDonaldTrump The only humanitarian crisis is the one that you started.
@Robert75988383 @CNN There is no need for the !!!! I am not a Democratic nor am I a Republican, I am an American. I don’t really care what Hillary has going on, because she is not the president. I care about our country and how it’s falling apart.
@realDonaldTrump 🖕🏽
@Robert75988383 @CNN It bothers me that people don’t think about the things that Trump has done in regards to Russia. If Obama did the things that Donald Trump has done and is doing it would be a huge issue. Hell they are still talking about Hillary Clinton and her damn emails.
@Robert75988383 @CNN The changes that he is trying to make has put our country in a government shutdown. How can lobbyists be stopped when the majority of them work for Trump? Look, it’s not what you do it’s how you do it and this President has broken every norm there is as the President of the USA
@Robert75988383 @CNN He got elected by spreading false dreams. Our country has never been so chaotic.
@Robert75988383 @CNN That just goes to show how simple minded you are. I’m just an American citizen voicing my opinion. That’s why I love the first amendment. It’s not a decision, it’s an idea to help America prosper.
@SenatorRomney @DavidBrodyCBN @POTUS Nothing’s changed in the proposals. I can’t understand why the immigration debate can’t be separate from the Government Shitdown debate. There shouldn’t be anything to exchange for the protection of our citizens.
@CNN I don’t understand why he doesn’t have the common sense to understand that people a suffering out here. It’s just no that serious for a wall.
@CNN I don’t understand why the American Government won’t put money into the country where the immigrants are fleeing from. We can invest in trade and infrastructure projects. We can make investments that will benefit them and us.
@CNN That money that he wants for the wall can go to more immigration judges and things that help move the process for a pathway to citizenship.
@seanhannity I wish you would stfu sometimes.
@SpeakerPelosi He mentioned everything else but the role who are suffering. He is constantly trying to convince the public to go along with the bullshit that is coming out of his mouth. This shit is past ridiculous!
RT @james120062: It took America 240 years to become the guiding light of the world, it took Donald Trump only 2 years to destroy everythin…
@realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich You are really crazy, you know that?
@realDonaldTrump This is ridiculous. This is not a reality tv show. If you have something say, say it!Why have the country waiting in suspense?? I swear you are way too old for this shit. This shit is real! This shit is dangerous!
@ChrisCuomo You have your full name on your page 😆 the first person I think about when I see your full name is @KellyannePolls Lol
@CNNTonight @CNN @donlemon @realDonaldTrump is so selfish. He will not do what’s in the best interest of this country. I can’t believe that he still holds the position of our President.
@mitchellreports @SpeakerPelosi This is ridiculous. It’s sad to see how petty our president is. He can fix everything right now at this moment, all he has to do is sign the paper.
@CNN We all know Donald Trump played a huge role in this.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity You are ridiculous 😩
@CNN Damn.
@DavidBrodyCBN @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer @VP @senatemajldr @LeaderHoyer No, my tax dollars should go to things like health care and education. Our Government Elected Officials need to be Adults and do what’s in the best interest of our country. Don’t forget that there are American Citizens suffering from the bs!
@hexjonahKK @Marierned @ABC You still didn’t answer my question, is he going to go do what she was about to do? I think the the political stunt would have looked better if he would have got his ass on the plane to go visit our troops.
@hexjonahKK @Marierned @ABC NOO, they don’t want to see Trump, why do you think she was the one going? Is he going to go do what she was going to go do? And no one loves photo ops and rallies like he does.
@CBSNews Wow. This is crazy..
@ChrisCuomo I would have done the same thing. There is no point in making an address when we all know that he isn’t going to show any sympathy for the people he governs or the man and women the he commands. This will be another, “I want my wall!” speech. Waist of time.
@davidaxelrod @SpeakerPelosi Wow. This is ridiculous. It’s that personal? Out government is in chaos right now.
@DavidBrodyCBN @jaketapper @TheLeadCNN I want him to announce when he is going to a war zone.
@Marierned @ABC At least she was going to something he hasn’t. He is so petty. We all know that the real reason why he is not invited to do the state of the union address is because the government is shut down. Nobody wants to hear his bs.
@ABC Everything Donald Trump does is irresponsible. How reckless was it for him to announce that private information to the world.
@McFaul @MittRomney That’s crazy. Looks like collusion to me.
@CBSNews That’s crazy. These people put their live on the line and this is how they are treated.
@RudyGiuliani I see your still using this same line. It’s time to come up with a new punchline.
@DavidBrodyCBN @realDonaldTrump There is a huge difference between Regan and Trump. Regan didn’t lie to the American people.
@seanhannity Wow.. McDonalds Hannity?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump What about our American soldiers who just died today. Putin has not only Trump brainwashed but he has you guys brain washed as well. 🤦🏾‍♀️
@AnnCoulter I can’t even count how many times Donald Trump have lied to the American people. I need you to more responsible when it comes to be honest to the American prople.
@jasoninthehouse And what is it that the President is going to say. Quite frankly I am tried of hearing about that wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for. We all know that he is not going to go out there and talk about the families and coast guards that didn’t get paid.
@seanhannity This is Donald Trumps fault.
@seanhannity So is that what the next step is? Try to obstruct justice by making the whole Muller thing go away?
@GeraldoRivera @POTUS I agree 100% I don’t understand why people say that he cares about the American people.
@RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @POTUS Fuck a compromise, give the federal workers their money that they work for. I think that is more important than anything.
@jasoninthehouse How about he allows people to get their checks and then he can open his mouth in a speech.
@TIME What the Fuck is wrong with this man?? It’s funny how Donald Trump sends Mike Pence to do his dirty work.
@Twitstroyer3 @CNN @realDonaldTrump If that’s the case why won’t he protect pay the TSA workers who protect our airports? Why won’t he pay our Coast Guards, the man and woman who protect our waters? I’m confused 🤷🏽‍♀️
@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Protect us from what? These people just want to live better lives, what’s wrong with that? Besides, who wouldn’t want to live in America? We should want people to embrace the idea of America and show them what democracy is all about. That shows how simple minded he is.
@ABC Happy Birthday Mr. King 🎈America will always be grateful for what you stood for and what you accomplished and help change.
RT @BetteMidler: #Trump grabbed his interpreter's notes after Hamburg meeting w/(Ras)Putin (did he flush them?)and then allowed NO aides or…
@AP That’s fuked up. Donald Trump should be ashamed of himself.
@senatemajldr It’s so ironic how you say that America will not abandon its leadership role in the world when Donald Trump does it on a daily bases. You have been in the political world for a long time and I am sure you never felt that way about your colleagues before.
@senatemajldr I need you to worry about putting that bill on the to own the government. At this point everything else is irrelevant. Be a leader and take on your role as a co-equal branch of government. Fuck how Donald Trump feels, he doesn’t have our best interest at heart.
@CNN He needs to do something. The could buy their own food if there was no shut down.
@seanhannity And what is McConnell doing? At least open the government.
@CBSNews @SabrinaSiddiqui It shouldn’t even be like that. People are worry about paying their bills not what you campaign on.
@RepMarkMeadows @DavidBrodyCBN Do you care about the content of the investigation? Muller was picked as special counsel to investigate Russia’s Interference in the election. It’s not his fault that it’s leading to trump
@bennyjohnson @tedcruz @DailyCaller And what do you call Trumps speech?
@enews The man acts like he has nothing better to do. Can you get off you ass and pen the government?
@CNN I wouldn’t care in the was the king of the world, I’m a grown ass man I would never let another man disrespect me like that. Are these guys that scared of trump?
@ABC This man is crazy
@nytimes This is ridiculous.
@washingtonpost Wow. This is our President.
@CBSNews Wow. He looks so stupid.
@DavidBrodyCBN @realDonaldTrump @CNN @MSNBC @NBCNews @POTUS @nytimes @washingtonpost And what if they are true? Then what? No one is saying he is guilty they are just putting the facts out there. Democracy will prevail. ✊🏽
@ABC This man has a serious problem. Why the fuk is he our president. The Russian’s are happy.
@CNN @DianneG This is Donald Trumps fault. Our country is less safe with this bs going on. Is this apart of Putin’s plan too?
@realDonaldTrump You tweet like you are a spoiled 14 year old school girl. You tryna keep the base happy..
@CBSNews Looks like he had to come up with some more bullshit to keep his base happy.. this is ridiculous.
@CNN You sound like a damn foo. How can one be so inconsiderate and unsympathetic. There are people who are really out here hurting
@BillOReilly You talk about the newspaper article but yet you fail to mention the content in the article. You say nothing about his actions and demeanor that he displays toward Putin. It seems as if you don’t care that the Russians are trying to destroy our democracy.
@realDonaldTrump The border is secure, our military (the greatest in the world) are protecting us.
@washingtonpost This is the craziest and scariest thing that I’ve ever witnessed in my life 😧
@CNN 😧 I bet he has money in his wallet. They don’t give a damn about these people.
@PhilipRucker @moonpieluva Wow. That’s all I can ay to that.
@KellyannePolls Is this more alternative facts? Fuck that wall, think about the Angle Moms and Dads who can’t pay their bills because of this bs. You don’t give a damn about these people.
@ABC It scares me that there are people who don’t care about the allegations against this man.
@seanhannity Watch CNN’s New Day and you will see why they went to Puerto Rico. Mayde you will learn something.
@CNN Wow. Now what if this was Obama?
@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump is doing Putin’s bidding 😡
@GOPLeader @HurdOnTheHill @HouseGOP It’s about time.
@JudgeJeanine Congress represents us all and to them in separate categories causes division. I believe that you can make a difference and bring us all together because you are a fighter. At the end of the day we all want what’s best for our country.
@JudgeJeanine Thank you for being fair and admitting that but do have 1 favor. You have a lot of influence on you constituents can you bring the country back together and say Lawmakers or Congress rather than “her democratic colleagues or radical democrats?”
@seanhannity Have you reported on trump being a Russian Agent? Give us the facts @seanhannity
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity I’ve never had any problems with diversity, that’s what this country is all about. It’s not the 1800s or early 1900s, other people have the right to live the American dream. But I do agree that they should come into our country legally.
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity I never said everyone wants to come to America but a lot of people do. I want people to know what our country is about because we are the greatest nation in the world. The more people come the more our economy will grow.
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity 5.7 is not the full length, it’s our money and tax dollars that we pay. MEXICO was supposed to pay for the wall, or did you forget that? You say that most people don’t want to come to America yet there are many traveling from South America to live a better life.
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity America has never had a President who is working for the Russians and does any and everything to distract from it. I’d rather have a President who is open to change and tolerance. And I think we can all agree on border security. It’s not what you do it’s how you do it.
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity https://t.co/kzaF7Gc5h6
@ABC My sister will take it, she has about 30 plants in her home.
@kylegriffin1 @maddow I’m certiorari as to what Putin has on Trumpi think about it every night 😕😟
@CNN @CNNOpinion This is @senatemajldr fault I don’t give a damn what anyone’s says. He refuses to do his job and kisses Trumps ass everyday tht this shutdown continues.
@maggieNYT @PeteSouza @MichaelCohen212 Donald Trump does not take his job seriously at all. He doesn’t give a damn about anyone but himself and it’s disgusting.
@CBSNews He is playing right into Russia’s hands. I can’t believe this shit.
@washingtonpost This is @senatemajldr fault! I will continue to scream it as loud as ever because he refuses to play his role as a separate branch of government. He continues to kiss trumps ass.
@JudgeJeanine You are a weirdo.
@bucklemyshoez @seanhannity Makes sense to me
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity I do agree that the wall is needed in curtain area but not along the whole border. The wall being along the border screams Stay Out rather than Welcome. Everyone wants to live and experience the American dream. That’s the best thing about OUR country.
@CorsonWyman @seanhannity China’s wall represents Unification, a wall on the southern border would represent division and intolerance. America has never had a President who uses immigration to scare and divide his citizens. There is no need for something that technology can fix.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Ya, you sure showed everyone how tough yu were in Helsinki
@washingtonpost Where in the hell is @senatemajldr????? This shutdown is on him!
RT @MarkWarner: I think we’ve had enough of the President running the government like one of his businesses.
@CNN @realDonaldTrump Does not have this country’s best interest at heart. He doesn’t give a damn about these people having to pay their bills.
@kenolin1 @moonpieluva Trump has @GrahamBlog’s Asshole  😂😜
@SpeakerPelosi Ily @SpeakerPelosi  Keep doing what you’re doing and continue to stand up to that Bully we have in the White House.
@realDonaldTrump If that is the case why didn’t you do something about it when the “Caravan” came? Mr. Muller is getting closer to that ass that’s why. Distractions, Distraction, Distractions SmH
@seanhannity Barriers work in certain areas but it’s the 20th century baby. Let me ask you a question, do you still have a box tv 📺 or do you have a flat screen? Do you still have a still have a phone ☎️ with a cord or do you have a IPhone 📱 It’s time for us to step our game up.
@CNN Why won’t America do the same???
@washingtonpost Why is this country so divided? It’s a honor to have other races represent our country, this is what America is about. This isn’t the 1800’s or early 1900’s, diversity is what makes this country different from others.
@VP You Daddy aka @realDonaldTrump fails the basic test of Democracy everyday.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You should be ashamed of yourself.
@ABCPolitics Not only am I SCARED but I am also nervous. We don’t know what his true intentions are. He can say whatever he wants but the proof is in the pudding. As yourself Congress, Does Donald Trump really care about our country. Think of where America’s standing in the world today. 🙁☹️
@ABCPolitics I’ve never seen an AMERICAN PRESIDENT say or do the things that @realDonaldTrump does. REGARDLESS of our differences I’ve never known any President to put any other country before his own. Am I the only one who is SCARED? POTUS does not have our best interest at heart.
@CBSEveningNews @CBSNews @krisvancleave This would be the perfect time for our adversaries to take advantage of our country. Am I the only one who is worried about that because obviously Trump isn’t.
@SenateGOP If there was a crisis he would have or should have done something when the Caravan got here. He is pathetic and childish and all of you republicans are complicit to his actions.
@ABC @SpeakerPelosi  I watched your interview with Joy last week and I understood and agreed with everything you said. It’s hard for me to be proud to be an American when our leader is so UnAmerican. He does not have our best interests at heart and it scares me.
@ABC @realDonaldTrump is a little boy in a grown mans body. He cares more about a wall then he does his own citizens. How could someone with such a title be so careless and disrespectful? There is no crisis if it was he would have felt with it when the caravan was coming.
@washingtonpost We have lost Our Reputation, Allies, Our Respect, Our Authority, and Our Importance on the world stage. Why doesn’t CONGRESS Care about that. America is crumbling because of a man who is unfit to run our country.
@washingtonpost Mitch is a little boy listening to daddy. It’s obvious that he doesn’t care about his constituents because if he did the government would be open regardless of what @realDonaldTrump has to say. Think about the people who voted for you little boy.
@seanhannity You always have something to say about the next man @seanhannity. I need you to come from underneath @realDonaldTrump balls and be  your own man. It’s like you are on his d*ck more than his wife.
@VP @POTUS It is important to embrace and encourage people to come to our country to live the American dream, that is how our country is structured. Isn’t @FLOTUS an immigrant? I love our country but it’s weird to feel like our President doesn’t.
@CNN There are reasons why people and immigrants come want to this country. As you say @realDonaldTrump, America is the greatest country the world. There are people who want to experience the American dream and there are people who want to live without fear.
@CNN I’m a disappointed in American. With this President in the White House I can no longer say that I am proud to be an American. What happen to tolerance, love, respect, and embracing our fellow American?
@seanhannity Whatever happens to tolerance and acceptance. America should be helping these people not kicking them around and locking them up in cages. This is so unAmerican. I can no longer say that I am proud to be an American ☹️
@CNN Donald Trump is very irresponsible. MEXICO was supposed to pay for the walk.
@CNN That’s cool lol
@katiezez @washingtonpost Nd Donald Trump doesn’t give 2 fuks about his issue. Now if it was Obama this would be a huge issue. How can you call yourself a man @realDonaldTrump
@seanhannity You irritate me. You worship everything trump does smh
@CBSNews Look at Mike, standing there like a little 🐶 smh
@realDonaldTrump You want to thank them but yet you still won’t pay them. You can kiss their ass and mine too. Disrespectful Son.of.a.Bitch
@BillOReilly So a wall will fix that problem right? You sound ridiculous. The crisis is the man that you worship. God say, tha’ll shall not put a man before him.
@realDonaldTrump I thought MEXICO was going g to pay for the wall. That’s all I have to say about that.
@realDonaldTrump @VP is a bitch, I’m sorry. He follows right behind Donald Trump just like a little 🐶
@lcby @realDonaldTrump That is the #1 question all Republicans should be asking themselves.
@mmcheesy @realDonaldTrump This is the perfect statement. The longer our country is in chaos the weaker and more vulnerable we will become. I am so disappointed in @senatemajldr You would rather kiss 💋 trumps ass the represent your constituents 🤦🏾‍♀️
@realDonaldTrump You are very selfish, our advisories see what’s going on in our country and they like it. They love the chaos, they love the division and they love how you tear our country down day by day smh
@realDonaldTrump We have the Greatest Military in the world I’m pretty sure they can handle what’s going on on the border and they don’t need a damn wall to do it 😡
@realDonaldTrump We won’t have that if you keep this shutdown going. A lot of ppl think you are doing this for a campaign promise but I think you are doing this to make your friend Putin happy. The more you destroy our the country the happier he will be. 😡
@CBSNews This guy is a straight weirdo.
@HurdOnTheHill @donlemon Amazing point. There is not reason why these people shouldn’t be getting paid.
@BillOReilly So due to the fact you’d keep our hard working American tax payer from their checks. I don’t understand how our Republican Congress can be so careless when it comes to our countries security and prosperity
@CBSNews This is ridiculous. I am so disappointed in our Republican Congress.
@CNN This guy is weirdo.
@senatemajldr Your worried about politics and while I’m worried about my paycheck. You need to ask yourself, who are you really there to serve?
@realDonaldTrump You are a weirdo
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats Thank you 🙏🏽
@PressSec Just because people say bad things about him doesn’t me he fights back like a teenager.
@PressSec If he believes in the free press why does he get so angry and calls the media the enemy of the people?
@washingtonpost Wow.
@realDonaldTrump Yu should have done that a long time ago
@GaberalRe @FoxNews They are not looking up to a 70 year old man, they are looking up to The President of the United States. 🤔 Think about tht for a min.
@SenBobCorker So What are you going to do about it @SenBobCorker ? Yu have the power to do something.
@JeffFlake I use to look to yu speak out. Now I see tht yu don’t give a damn. SmH. Tweets me nothing be a man stand up and speak out
@marcorubio Don’t forget, the tone comes from the top. Would you allow your child to sit in Trumps presents when he is in rally mode?
@JeffFlake Do something about it!
@FCBojangles @washingtonpost @SenJohnMcCain @BrettKavanaugh I'm going to need you to mind your manners young man. So disrespectful. And anyone with wisdom know that principles help guide you to make the right decisions when you take action.
@JeffFlake Don't say anything until you are ready to do something about it @JeffFlake I thought you were a pretty good guy at first but you have done nothing but fall in line just like the rest. Stop the fake shit and get the hell outta office!
@realDonaldTrump I wish you shut the fuk up and quit being some damn petty. Yu are a 62 year old man but yu act like yu are high school.
@FCBojangles @washingtonpost @SenJohnMcCain @BrettKavanaugh He may have voted for his policies but let’s not forget that the man had morals and principles, something yu lack by speaking up on man who just passed away.
@seanhannity I just want you to shut uo
@RudyGiuliani He Fuked up his own reputation by the way he acted in response to the allegations. Idc how bad the allegations were, he should have remained professional and I hate how our Republican Senators over look tht.
@senatemajldr I don’t believe his is Qualified. Judge Kavanaugh’s temper was inappropriate when he was being questioned by our Senators. REGARDLESS of the allegations he should have remained Professional. How would he act in a court hearing that he doesn’t agree with?
@marcorubio You worry about the allegations but I, as an American citizen, worry about his temper. REGUARDLESS of the allegations he should have remained professional and set his personal feelings to the side. I don’t want a Supreme Court Judge that can’t hold his Temper.
@VP @POTUS Yet he has still failed to put Putin in his place for meddling g in our elections. I don’t want to see the shit Pence. If you were President how would you react to the Russian meddling??
@realDonaldTrump We all know that the only thing you care about is your base so stop ✋ your shit Trump.
@foxandfriends @ChrisCoons Do you think his tone was appropriate on a professional level? Regardless of the accusations he is still up for a life time appointment in the highest court in the land. How you react when you are mad is the real you.
@senatemajldr What exactly is your duty because the last time I check none of the Republican Senators have had the balls to check @realDonaldTrump? Where are your morals, hell you act childish too.
@AC360 @andersoncooper 🤭
@PressSec These allegations shows Kavanaugh true colors. The way yu act when you’re mad is the person you really are.
@SenBobCorker Do yu really trust his temperament? Regulars less of what the allegations were he should have been professional and respectful. He was out of line for his response and you know it @SenBobCorker
@nytimes This is ridiculous. I’ve never met a bigger bully in my life.
@FCBojangles @washingtonpost @SenJohnMcCain @BrettKavanaugh You are very disrespectful. The attitude come from the top. You must be a Trump Fan 🤔
@nytimes Sad story.. I can’t say it enough.. what would @SenJohnMcCain do??
@nytimes It seems as if Everyone has forgotten about @SenJohnMcCain. What would he do?? @sengraham2016 @SenBobCorker @IvankaTrump
@washingtonpost It seems as if everyone has forgotten about @SenJohnMcCain already. 😢 What would he do??? Vote NO on @BrettKavanaugh
@chelseahandler She is crazy.. You would never flip on your father. You will be loyal til the day you die but the question is, Will he be loyal enough to fess up in order to keep you out of jail?
@realDonaldTrump It’s funny because you bring up North Korea all the time but wast about Russia? Russia is a Nation that is attaching America left and right. This is unacceptable!
@seanhannity And you approve of the behavior?
@realDonaldTrump You do the same exact thing when you tell the world that Our FBI is in tatters. You declare war on Law &amp; Order everyday when you disrespect our values and what we stand for. You continue to kiss Putin's ass and leave the Leadership up to the Adults.
@DonaldJTrumpJr You are very petty for your age?
@realDonaldTrump So what is your plan Sir? What are the details? Do you feel comfortable knowing North Korea it still continuing their nuclear activities? Will you start the war games since N. Korea isn't honoring their part of the agreement?
@realDonaldTrump Damn, you are so thirsty for attention. You act like the popular asshole that everyone pretends to like in high school.
@washingtonpost What kind of shit is this? This is what America has become.
@SDISBEAUTIFUL1 Lol.. She can't do it antmore 😂 he is an embarrassment
@ABC If this was Obama he would be in jail right now.
@KrisJenner Not cute... Your too old for tht shit
@CoreyLMJones Trump's negative and disrespectful behavior is not American. I think it's time he acts his age. Would you kiss his ass if he Tweeted about you the way he tweets about the DOJ and the FBI? The Bully always looses in the end.
@KimKardashian Lol , To bad yu didn't ride for Chris Humphries 😂
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump What do you call what you and your kids are doing
@FoxNews @IvankaTrump @GOPLeader I need this Bitch to stay in her place.
@PolticsNewz That's a Damn Shame
@FoxNews The word Fake is turning into something that will change the way the world feel about Journalism. Just because @realDonaldTrump doesn't call your network fake doesn't mean that the consequences don't apply to you. Despite one individual opinion, you should respect your craft.
@rob_libadia @moonpieluva @realDonaldTrump This is not NORMAL!! Is this what our country has turnt into?
@Milvio_Diaz @moonpieluva @realDonaldTrump #FactsFirst
@PolticsNewz Does that mean the break up letter worked? 😂
@PolticsNewz And what to do you call what Donald Trump is doing?
@FoxNews Why does Micheal Avrnatti's personal life have to do with the legal matters at hands?
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes And your Ego can't handle that, huh?
@realDonaldTrump I liked your break up letter, looks like Kim is the one pulling the strings 😂  Your base may believe you deserve the Noble Price Prize but in reality President Moon is the one who deserves the credit. He opened his arms and used diplomacy which opened the doors for others.
@realDonaldTrump You stupid... Thts all I have to say about that. The next time your fat ass decide to eat some fruit remember tht the people yu "HATE" are the ones who picked those fruits.
@AussieDrudgeRep @Krush59 @realDonaldTrump I don't understand how you could be mad at NFL Players but the not mad at Trump for disrespect the our country and strong away our norms
@AussieDrudgeRep @Krush59 @realDonaldTrump You sound just like the ignorant man who is taring America apart. I could understand if the protest was not a peaceful protest but it is.
@AussieDrudgeRep @Krush59 @realDonaldTrump Right yu paying to watch a game and apart of the game is the national anthem and if our NFL players want to peacefully protest they have the right to do so.
@JeffFlake This isn't normal
@JeffFlake Its not right, our country is being violated by the man who runs it
@seanhannity This man doesn't give a Damn about No One but himself. He is pathetic.
@realDonaldTrump I just don't understand why Obamas name is still coming out of your mouth. It's like you try to degrade him and his accomplishments just to make yourself feel better? How can you call yourself a man. I bet you won't take those words to the pavement.
@realDonaldTrump Yu are so full of shit. How can you wake up every morning and call yourself a man?
@fEight_gmx @NRA @GOP One thing that needs to be understood and realized is that it's not just about school shootings it's about gun violence period. I know a hand full of people who went and brought guns off the streets. This problem is way deeper than the surface.
@realDonaldTrump Yu are a joke 😂
@realDonaldTrump @nikkihaley I use to think tht it was our duty to Lead the world
@realDonaldTrump Yu sound stupid @realDonaldTrump
@JeffFlake I have the up most respect for you Senetor @JeffFlake and I put my faith in out@government to suppor
@tribelaw Of course we all know tht Donald Trump likes to kiss Putin's ass
@washingtonpost Fuk yu
@CNN Another mf with no morals or integrity.
This picture says alot. https://t.co/KafE2JlvBb
@realDonaldTrump If this the case why are you letting this investigation get you so upset
@realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂😉😝😝
@CNN Now this s*** is ridiculous. I feel like the blame should be put on the sheriff and the local police stations. I believe that if they would have pushed the issue the FBI would have done it too. It is the sheriff's fault because he saw the warning signs.
@bryanbehar @moonpieluva The only place I can picture Donald Trump running to is the golf course and McDonald's to get a Big Mac and a Diet Coke. 🍔🍟⛳
@CNN I find it funny that Donald Trump wants to do a pre missile strike on North Korea but yet he hasn't said anything to Putin. I don't trust Donald Trump at all and he doesn't have this country's best interest at heart.
@SenJohnMcCain @nytimes No one should ever have to live like this. I believe deep in my heart that this is what America will turn into if Donald Trump continues to run this country. It will be divided and destroyed.
It's good to hear from you @SenJohnMcCain. I hope you get well and  you feel better and we Americans have your back 100%.
@Bourdain He may run into McDonald's and get a Big Mac and a Diet Coke. 😂😂
@seanhannity This country will go straight to hell if he runs it for the next 7 years.
@realDonaldTrump @judgenapolitano @marthamaccallum I just don't understand why you take the time out of your busy schedule to constantly mention Hillary Clinton's name. She's supposed to be old news but it seems as if you can't keep her off your mind. What's your real reasoning for this?
@TIME He ain't going to do shit he has bone spurs remember?
@seanhannity Why are you still talking about Hillary Clinton you must be real bored. Here it is damn near 2 years and you still feel the need to talk about her. No one cares but you.
@CNN This shit so fuking petty and makes no sense.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Bernie Sanders is not the president of the United States your dad is. When your dad starts to show some leadership and put effort into protecting this country against the Russians then you can say something. Until then shut the fuk up.
@RepKayGranger This is something that I can agree with. Things are not the same anymore, Society has changed. We have to modernize our law. It's sad that we are at the level where we need metal detectors for our schools but that is society today.
@marcorubio @CNN You are doing the best you can to support change and we will continue to fight together.
@sharmila819 @CNN Change in leadership is the most important part of our democracy. We have a right to choose our leaders and that is what special about the United States.
@CNN You are ridiculous
@realDonaldTrump @CNN @nbc Teachers are there to teach not to learn to use a gun. It shouldn't even get that far. Our schools should never be put in these kinds of situations. Society is messed up and we need someone to lead this country not divided. Morals matter.
@realDonaldTrump This is how I know that you are a psycho. Aren't you supposed to be making America great again?
@realDonaldTrump How can we be confident when you are constantly dividing America. We help rebuild other countries because it is our responsibily as the world leader. If you took the time out to read a history book you would know that.
@realDonaldTrump But you have yet to proudly stand up for America. Show some leadership. Talk to Putin the way you talk to "Little Rocket Man" or are you scared that Putin will tap that ass like a child be spanked for talking back to his parents?
@realDonaldTrump Well we also lost 17 ppl in a mass shooting at a high school.. But yet you have not tweeted about that.
@realDonaldTrump Why are you do indenial? If you really gave a damn about this county you would talk to Putin the way to takes to Kim Ju Ung. But no Yur to busy kissing his ass.
@realDonaldTrump You use Twitter because you have a child's mind and you refuse to act like an adult. You can't handle criticism nor can you respect anyone's opinion about your poor leadership.
@realDonaldTrump Why in the Fuck are you worried about what's going on over there when you should be worried about the things that are happening in the U.S.? So much for that wack ass campaign promise where you promised to focus on the US.
@realDonaldTrump Well at least this country wouldn't be divided.
@realDonaldTrump Because the Dems are not complicit when it comes to your Dangerous, Divisive, Irratic Behavior.
@realjmannarino @EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump @dcsheriff You should feel for Donald Trump because he is the one who turns everything to a sad attack.. Charlottesville is 1 example.. Everything that is happening in Iran is another.. I'm not going to even waist my time typing out the rest.
@EdKrassen @IRdotnet @realDonaldTrump @dcsheriff He is such a hypocrite.
@realDonaldTrump @dcsheriff If that's the case then why do you constantly talk down on the FBI? YOU CAN'T HAVE YPUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO.
@realDonaldTrump You are too Damn old to be this INSECURE..
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump Girl yu don't have to kiss your Daddy's ass just like everyone else.
@Triqqyish @dluke65 @INeedABeerOrTwo @seanhannity Seems as if your taking this kind of personal @Triqqyish no need for the animosity
@PolticsNewz No.. If he does not like you.. You are guilty in his eyes.
@FoxNews Just because territory has been taken back doesnt mean that people all over the world can't be radicallized.
If you embody being an American then it really doesn't matter who the POTUS of the US is, all that matters is that our democracy is safe.
It's scary to see that most Conservitives and Conservative Media really do not want to get to the bottom of Russia's involvement in our elections and Trump complicity to that involvement.
@Triqqyish Trump has never denounced Russia for their involvement in our election, Muller found evidence corroborating parts of the Dossier, 2 inditments, 2 convictions, and its obvious that hw is trying to discredit Miller.. What more evidence do you need.
@Triqqyish During Obama's time in office we never heard the words, FAKE NEW, FBI/DOJ IS IN TATTERS, LITTLE ROCKET MAN, HE NEVER USED RACISM TO DIVIDE US, HE NEVER HAD ANY SERIOUS CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AGAINST HIM WHILE IN OFFICE. There are just so many differences between Trump and Obama.
@Triqqyish It scares me because none of his supporters care about what he could have really done with the Russians. There are Facts along with 2 indictments and 2 convictions. What more evidence do you need. And for you to say our country has crumbled under Obamas watch is preposterous.
@Triqqyish Don't presume to know what I think.. If Obama did something wrong then he needs to be charged and convicted. My whole point of saying that we need to focus more on Trump is because he is the man who holds our country in his hands.
@Triqqyish Once again.. I could say the same about Trump. Facts are Facts when it comes to Donald and his camaigns connections with the Russians. And if you were to bet you bottom dollar then you would loose it because Trumps would be impeached and never thought of again.
@LINDATRAVELguru @Triqqyish @seanhannity Rite.
@Triqqyish it is clear that our current President may have allowed Russia to have a say so in American politics
@Triqqyish When I said that Obama is a private citizen, I just wanted to point out that alot of attention if focused on him when there are more important things to focus on that our current President is doing. There is alot of digging to find crimes that Obama may have committed when...
@Triqqyish Oh no, you must have misunderstood my comment. If that were the case, we wouldn't see justice when Muller charges Trump with abstruction. If you commit a crime, regardless of who you are, it is very important that you are convicted of those crimes and brought to justice.
@Triqqyish @INeedABeerOrTwo @seanhannity Do you feel the same when it comes to Trump and individual's   involved in his campaign money laundering conspiracies?
@Triqqyish @INeedABeerOrTwo @seanhannity And once again Obama is not the POTUS he is now a private citizen and I think its more important to focus on the things that are happening now because our country is falli g apart and and that did not start happening until Trump started his race for President.
@Triqqyish @INeedABeerOrTwo @seanhannity If you believe that then our country has failed as a Democracy. I won't name the news outlets that I watch because it is irritant but I do know that the information that I consume are facts, Proven FACTS. They don't fall in line with Putin's idea of discrediting our institutions
@CNN In sure when you were a child you parent taught you to think before you speak. You are and adult now so its kinda too late to walk back what you said.
@INeedABeerOrTwo @Triqqyish @seanhannity The only thing that Fox News is good for is spreading propaganda. When you look at the broader picture you'll see that this exactly what Putin wants.
@Triqqyish @seanhannity I could say the say about Trump. Muller is doing a Damn good job inditing people in Trumps inner circle so imagine what the results will be when he reaches the core. You guys could have uncoveres done that when he was in office now that he is out it the #1 this on your to do list
@seanhannity It's sad because Obama, his Administration, and Hillary are more popular then Trump, a year into Trumps presidency. You guys are so Damn desperate to divert attention its pathetic.
@Triqqyish @seanhannity I don't see how people can still be complicit when it come to Donald Trump and his actions as POTUS. Obama has been out of office for Damn near a year and yet we still here his name floati g around. He is more popular then Donald Trump these days.
@seanhannity You could say the same about Trump, but yet you choose not to. You try way to hard to Bring negative attention to Obama and his 8 years in office. Why don't you talk about the things that are relevant to today.
@VP @POTUS In 1 year..	· Firing James Comey	· Instigating Nulcear War with N. Korea	· Kissing Putin's Ass	· Allowing Donald to believe that the FBI is in tatters.	· Dividing our country	· Failing to condemn racism	The lost goes on.
@brianklaas You can't really discredit anything when the facts and evidence is on the table... I feel bad for Trump.. SIKE 😂😂
@PressSec It seems as if we are seeing more negative consequences the positive. I can't wait to see what the consequences will be when Muller puts the facts on the table. I don't think you will be able to divert attention to Hillary then 😂
@WhiteHouse Donald Trump did make and fulfilled alot of his campaign promises but that doesn't necessarily mean that those promises are Good for the country. We have seen nothing but division and isolation as a result of those promises.
@VP @SecretService Mike Pence has done more Presidential things then the President.
@VP @SecretService Mike Pence is a good man and he shows it with his actions. Going to Afghanistan for surprise visit to see our troops, spending Christmas with the Armed Forces, among other things.. He may kiss Donald Trump's ass but you can tell that he does genuinely care about America.
@SmthnglikeKites Hi
@FLOTUS Cute pic. Mrs. First Lady
@GaberalRe @FoxNews You must be apart of that 32% who is complicit to his Behavior. I definitely feel like we both have different views and opinions when it comes to our expectations of the POTUS and our government so ill be the bigger person and just say we will just have to agree to disagree 😊
@GaberalRe @FoxNews And if you really believe that other nations owe us take a look at our debt and think about the $1.5 trillion that we have to barrow in order to pay for the tax bill he just passed. With an attitude like that you will never get anywhere in life.
@GaberalRe @FoxNews It's not about him raising our children nor is it about idolizing him. What you fail to realize is that Donald Trump is not just a 70 year old man, he is the POTUS and our children do look to him to gain wisdom and knowledge because of the title he holds.
@GaberalRe @FoxNews And for the record, Donald Trump has a DUTY AND A RESPONSIBILITY to show our children what is right and what is wrong. America is the greatest Nation in the world and we have a duty to show our fellow nations that Dignity, Respect, and Pride are ways to exercise Democracy.
@GaberalRe @FoxNews Well I'm neither a Republic or Democrat I'm just an American citizen who is concerned about the direction our country is headed. And what has he done besides passing a very unpopular tax bill, divide the nation, instigate nuclear war, and kiss Putin's ass?
@FLOTUS @POTUS Doesn't look like Donald had fun 😂😂😂
@FoxNews This man sets a BAD EXAMPLES, not just the US but for everyone in the world.. SmH
@billjperry @FoxNews @UN For example..	· N. KOREA	· RUSSIA'S INTERFERENCES IN OUR ELECTION	· UNIFYING OUR COUNTRY	· HEALTH CARE	· INFRASTRUCTURE	· DACA	· GETTING THE DEBT UNDER CONTROL ( EVEN THOUGH HE JUST ADDED $1.5 TRILLION TO IT)	Just a few in case you forgot. It's not FLOWED THINKING its REALITY.
@billjperry @FoxNews @UN Hell that not my concern nor was it the point I was trying to make. Trump made a campaign promise to focus on America but it seems as if he can't help but start trouble on the other side of the world. There are more important things that he need to focus on.
@FoxNews @UN The majority members of the @UN wants America to stay on the other side of the Atlantic when it comes to making decisions like this a quite frankly I don't blame them. We have to focus on the immediate issues that are happening here in the US.
@realDonaldTrump And your insider polls are strong because you ass kissers convince you that you are doing a great job.
@realDonaldTrump Incredible year?? This year has been very chaotic and it has had a huge turn when it comes to democracy, class, and respect. "Fake New" doesn't have to convince us of anything because we have lived thought it and witnessed it ourselves.
@CNN You probably would have had a chance if you would have stuck to your guns and not be "COMPLICIT" when it comes to Donald Trump's rediciouls tax plan. 😒
@mlafferty1 @shawgerald4 @realDonaldTrump First off, I wasn't even talking to you @sidneys2d, I was talking to @mlafferty1, so with that being said, stay in your place because this conversation is not your business.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews It's very hypicritical of you say that because you still haven't condemned your transitional team for doing the same exact thing. And as a Man, you should never put another man's Wife inbetween a dispute that I have with that man, it's disrespectful and childish. Grow up!
@mlafferty1 @shawgerald4 @realDonaldTrump If that's you feel that way then why respond? How about you give it a rest and mind your business.

@SenBobCorker You make no sense at all. You oppose adding to the debt but yet you voted for a VERY UNPOPULAR Tax Bill. Now, in order to REDEEM yourself, you have decided to vote against any spending bill that will help Middle Class Americans. You will finish your term with no respect from us.
@FLOTUS @NoradSanta You are an amazing First Lady. You put so much to support America and we appreciate it.
@realDonaldTrump That's the problem, all you care about is your BASE. If you want someone to stroke your Ego go watch Fox News. You can't expect the rest of us to support you when you don't give a Damn about us. The only way you can make America great again is if you Unite us not Divide us.
@conservmillen @DonaldJTrumpJr I beg to differ..
@realDonaldTrump What about your emails?
@realDonaldTrump You are so pathetic and petty. I think its time you put your BIG BOY underwear on and focus on more important things.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Stop spending your time watching a news station that kisses your ass and open the door to criticism so you can not only learn from you mistakes but admitt them. By Admitting your mistakes you can learn from them.. This is something your old ass should know already.
@realDonaldTrump It's crazy though because your erratic behavior overshadows your accomplishments and your approval ratings are floating down shits creek. I need you to go grab a HISTORY BOOK and stop contributing to the "FAKE NEWS", as you call it.
@realDonaldTrump Damn you really can't help yourself huh?? This is a Damn shame.. You are a 71 year old man who acts like a fucking High School student who is desprate to stay popular. Can yu let everyone enjoy their vaction in peace??
@realDonaldTrump And we are going to spend more if you continue your ridiculous rhetoric with N. Korea
@realDonaldTrump I can name a few..	Firing James Comey	Failing to denounce racism in Charlottesville.	Pardoning Sheriff Joe Arpaio	Failing to address Putin for meddling in our election 	Denouncing our amazing FBI institutions	Instigating war with N. Korea	There are so many I can't keep track 😕
@realDonaldTrump You sound like a high school student trying to sale a pitch to be prom king.. Grow up Donald.
@realDonaldTrump It would help if you were more responsible when it comes to the decisions you make, not only as the @POTUS  but as a Man as well. It's childish and petty when you bully and disrespect others. Remember, our children are watching. History will judge you in more way than you think.
@realDonaldTrump The most hated thing about you is your divisivness, your rhetoric, oh, and we can't forget your hair.
@realDonaldTrump You can't help yourself can you? You talk more about Hillary more than you talk about your wife.. Don't you think it's time you act your age?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Don't you have something better to do besides being messy.. Go play golf in your booty shorts or something.. 😠
@CNN This has been a year of our Nation crumbling right before our eyes.. 😕
@SenJohnMcCain @POTUS Ily Mr. McCain but don't you think it time we worry about America? How can we continue to support our Allies if our Nation is in "Tatter" (in my Donald Trump voice).
@Undoomed I that why you have all CAPS? 😂👏👏
@TIME How can you force a Woman to have a child with a diagnosed disability? What about health care coverage for the child when he/she is born? What about the emotional suffering for both the parent and child? You can force her to have the child but you can't force to take care of it.
@WhiteHouse There are 3 things that happend in the year 2017 I will never forget when it pretains to Trump.	#1 All of the divisive rasist rhetoric 	#2 The instigation of WWIII with N. Korea	#3 Trump never condemning Putin for his interference of our election
@VP You kiss Donald Trump's ass all day everyday but I Will give credit when it is due.. Thank you for showing our troops the we love, care, and support them.
@PolticsNewz Look like Putin's and Trump's plan didn't go as planned like they thought it would. Just because Donald Trump is president doesn't mean he has all the power. Thank God for our 3 branches of government.
@PolticsNewz Donald Trump is the most ignorant man I have ever seen in my life. For all the support him, this is what you children see and hear pretty much on a daily basis. I don't know any responsible parent who would want their children to follow in this mans footsteps.
@PressSec But what does it mean for Social Security, Health Care, and the Imfistucture Reform? This tax plan is supposed to be for the Middle Class but look what you have to take from the middle class in order to pay for it? This doesn't make sense to me..
@azstudigital @SenBobCorker Rite.. Now we have to clean up their mess because they aren't responsible enough to do it themselves 😒
@CNN The decision he made did nothing but stir up chaos in the Middle East. While campaigning Trump promised that he would focus on America and let the Middle East focus on their problems. Now that's one campaign promise he did not keep.
@CNN It's funny how the Republicans didn't have much to say about Muller until he indicted Michael Flynn. 💁 what happens in the dark will come to the light.
@krassenstein @TravisAllen02 @SoMeMediaInc @realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂 Right.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump I wish I could say the same about you 😕
@SenBobCorker I thought you would stand up to Trump and stand up for what you believe in.
@SenBobCorker Are you pleased that you and your party are adding 1.5 trillion dollars to the debt, that me, my child, my grandchildren, and my great-grandchildren will have to pay?
@kyledcheney @RepMaxineWaters That's my question. Any responsible president would allow the investigation to proceed without any discrepancies.
@SabrinaReinach @WSJ Why does that matter?
@PolticsNewz We all know Steve Bannon played a huge role when it comes to Russia.
@AriFleischer No, they are not for the 1.5 trillion debt that me, you, our children, and grandchildren will have to pay for.
@realDonaldTrump Your ego is going to burst just like the stock market when our economy collapse. You should have done what was best not only for America but for the world. That 1.5 trillion dollars could have went to job creations to help our Earth stay healthy. #ParisClimateAgreement
@realDonaldTrump I noticed that you said you weren't going to sign the bill until next year. Were you having second thoughts?
@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS Oh and one more thing.. He promised to Focus on America during his campaign, NOT the Middle East.. But it seems as if he can't help himself, DESTROYING the PEACE PROCCESS between the Palestinians and Isralies was straight BILLSHIT!!
@VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS The whole US is behind our troops. Maybe you should talk to your hero, @realDonaldTrump, and tell him to stop his erratic behavior we won't have to send our troops to N. Korea. He promised to bring them home, BUT WHERE ARE THEY AT? Now that's one CAMPAIGN PROMISE he did NOT keep!
@Chrisvega25 @here_hoping @VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS Oh and one more thing.. He promised to Focus on America during his campaign, NOT the Middle East.. But it seems as if he can't help himself, DESTROYING the PEACE PROCCESS between the Palestinians and Isralies was straight BILLSHIT!!
@Chrisvega25 @here_hoping @VP @WhiteHouse @POTUS The whole US is behind our troops. Maybe you should talk to your hero, @realDonaldTrump, and tell him to stop his erratic behavior we won't have to send our troops to N. Korea. He promised to bring them home, BUT WHERE ARE THEY AT? Now that's one CAMPAIGN PROMISE he did NOT keep!
@RepKayGranger It sounds good, but again there is no reassurance that these company's will reinvest back into our economy. There should have been conditions and requirements.
@SenBobCorker I live in CA and in CA our employers are required to provide health care, that should have been a requirement. It would definitely drive competition between insurance companies.
@SenBobCorker If you believe that Mr. Corker that fine but in reality there is no reassurance that these company's will reinvest back into our economy. There should have been requirements and conditions for these corporations if they wanted these tax cuts.
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You are right about that.. It's upsetting though because the only thing they influence is hate.
@realDonaldTrump You are so irresponsible to be a 71 year old man.. Do you not understand that there is a 21 trillion dollar deficit? You act like a teenager who starts drama just to remain popular.SmH
@seanhannity At the end of the day Mr. Hannity, Donald Trump is the President.. So where are we going with this?
@realDonaldTrump This is how I truely feel... Feel free to comment 😜 https://t.co/kvuZafiSPf
@JeffFlake @SenJohnMcCain Get well soon ❤ @SenJohnMcCain
@DonaldJTrumpJr @nypost And it is really sad how you continue to talk about Obama.. His time came and went.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @nypost Be the man that your father didn't raise you to be, admit your wrong doing, take responsibility for your actions, and be a MAN.
@realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @washingtonpost If that is the case why do yu constantly down talk the FBI??
@IsraelUSAforevr @realDonaldTrump 😂😂😂 that's a good one
@akahkahk @Hyperbole @GOPPollAnalyst @realDonaldTrump No one cares about you or your Character, that was just something that stuck out to me because of how controversial it sounded. And you're right, we are not in the same class. I come from a place where decency matters, now that's real politics.
@GOPPollAnalyst @realDonaldTrump Let use Donald Trump's favorite words "FAKE NEWS!!!"
@GOPPollAnalyst @realDonaldTrump Obama is not the president anymore Donald Trump is and if you feel that strongly about this video why haven't you brought it up in the passed 8 years
@akahkahk @Hyperbole @GOPPollAnalyst @realDonaldTrump Well yu tell that to Trump the next time he put Hillary's or Obama's name in his mouth. And I find it odd that you had to point out the fact that he is black.. That says alot about your Character.
@M_Zelaskey @Hyperbole @GOPPollAnalyst @realDonaldTrump And what do you think Donald Trump is doing with all of this divisiveness rhetoric?
@Hyperbole @GOPPollAnalyst @realDonaldTrump I agree with you 100% but not only does Obama have class, he is an adult and he carries himself like one. Donald Trump makes it his mission to down talk/disrespect Obama any chance he gets and Obama never lets his pride get in the way and fight back. That's what Adults do.
@realDonaldTrump I am actually proud of you for being the bigger person in this situation @realDonaldTrump. No trash talk, no rhetoric.. Now that is the way an Adult acts 😜
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes You're petty.. You just can't help yourself can yo??
@DonaldJTrumpJr Oh and one more thing, it shows how much your Dad cares about you when he has you lying for him. Well at least we know where Mike Flynn stands when it comes to his family, we all know that Flynn's guilty plea had alot to do with the interview Muller gave his son.
@DonaldJTrumpJr No your Daddy does it to himself when he lies, and yu do nothing but add fuel to the fire by following his footsteps. I would be very careful as to was I what I tell to Mr. Muller if I were you.
@SenateMajLdr @SenatorRounds I'm from California and in my state our employers have to provide healthcare so since you want to cut taxes for corporate America then you need to make the provide healthcare and higher wages for their employees. It may help stabilize healthcare as well.
What does that have to do with my statement
@WontBeSilent2 @AC360 She was campaigning for Moore like @KellyannePolls diesbfor Trump only in a more hostile way.
You can't blame him.. How is this making America great again? https://t.co/duHFgyZ7Mr
@CNN WtF!!
@ChristiChat Please don't try and taint a the investigation because Muller is getting closer and closer to Trump every single day you wake up. FACTS speak for themselves.
@factlifee0 But it is so hard to grasp stabilization in a relationship when your partner doesn't know how to love and tend to you the way you need them to.
@AC360 I saw that interview Anderson and the thing that bothered me most was the hostility. She couldn't even answer basic questions because she was so hostile. She treated the interview like a campaign rally, rather then answering the questions she pulled the distraction card. 😒
@TIME I don't understand why our government officials won't base his Impeachment off of his Behavior.. Clearly everything that he has done has put American lives in danger including recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital. We have troops in the middle east, lets not forget that.
@TIME In my opinion all of the top government officials don't give a Damn about this country because if they did they would have been put a end to the madness.
@CollinRugg @realDonaldTrump Condem Vladimir Putin for meddling in our election.
@CollinRugg @realDonaldTrump But what about his promise to put America first?? This decisions has nothing to do with America. I would think that he would focus on the thing that matter to Americans, like the deficit or maybe even healthcare??
@TimonPrax @realDonaldTrump For what? Putting our troops and all American citizens in danger.. I'm kinda confused..
@realDonaldTrump I could have sworn you made a campaign promises to focus on America and not the middle east. I will pray for our troops in that side of the world.
@djdun3 @AP_Politics @AP Its definitely not going to happen in California
@djdun3 @AP_Politics @AP I find that hard to believe...
RT @EdKrassen: RETWEET if you think that Donald Trump's reputation is in Tatters and you respect the FBI!
@PolticsNewz This shit is ridiculous..
@PressSec @WSJ So why is the Senate in such a rush to pass a bill that hasn't been hashed out? Why see where the economy goes from here and then base the tax bill off of the results?
@TheEconomist When it comes to the tax cuts bill how do you feel about it in regards to the economy?
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @senorrinhatch Make these companies provide health insurance for the people who work for them. This will also help the economy because the insurance companies can compete when it comes to working with businesses and corporations. It will also help regulate Medicare.
@realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @senorrinhatch If you want to cut taxes for these huge corporations and businesses then make them give back to the American people. Once they reach a certain amount of regulated Revenue they need to put that into giving their employees health insurance and higher wages. A win-win.
@realDonaldTrump I find it despicable that you constantly down talk the FBI just because the hot water is catching up to your ass. Facts are facts Donald and you need to face the fact that Muller is getting closer and closer to finding out the truth. I don't think your distractions will help.
@DenverBootyCall @realDonaldTrump Muller but at the end of the day the facts are what's important. Maybe you should look at the time line and check them out. You don't have to like this investigation but at the end of the day our country deserves Justice.
@realDonaldTrump Grow up you sound like a child trying to blame their sister or brother for sticking their hands in the cookie jar. Step Up be a man and admit you're wrong doing so we can move on and focus on the important things that we need to do to better this country.
Once American companies reach a certain amount I believe that they should put money into their employees and year by year raise employee rates depending on the revenue and income.
I am from the great state of California and in California it is mandatory that companies and businesses provide Health Care for their employees. That is something that will help stabilize Healthcare.
Why not use tax reform to help regulate Health Care. Maybe it would be a good idea to lower Tax Rate for Corporate Company's but in return they have to use some of the revenue to provide Healthcare and higher wages depending upon the corporate income.
@realDonaldTrump If there is nothing g to hide then why are you so stressed out about it? I don't understand why are so obsessed with Russia..
@realDonaldTrump ..But believe me Mr. Trump, you will see the consequences of your actions and trust me when I say those actions will not only affect North Korea but they will affect America as well. Americas position in this world will never be the same.
@realDonaldTrump Russia didn't condem shit and I truly believe China is tired of putting up with your irresponsible behavior as well. You continiously disrespect, provoke, and bully Kim Jong Un. In my opinion, you WANT to go to war so that you can claim victory when its all said and done.
@FoxNews As a Tax Payer I feel betrayed. Hard working Americans should not have to pay for the despicable behavior of any government official. They should have to pay out pocket for their personal issues.
@TheLeadCNN @CNN @LindseyGrahamSC  You can say @realDonaldTrump is unfit but in my opinion you and all of you colleagues are as well. You stand by and watch while he continues to divide and knock America down the totem pole and do nothing about it. Do you sleep well at night??
@TIME This is disgusting. If they can't even keep the WH clean what makes you think they can run a country? Or maybe they just followed suit when Dad moved in 😂
@realDonaldTrump @senorrinhatch Admiring how @realDonaldTrump makes a his decisions is ok but my question to you is, Are they the right decisions? Do his decisions put Americans lives in jeopardy? Is provoking North Korea in a disrespectful manner something that a President should do? Don't worry I'll wait 💁
@realDonaldTrump @senorrinhatch @senorrinhatch As a member of the Senate I am baffled as to how you can be complicit when it comes to @realDonaldTrump's behavior. When I was growing up my parents told me to choose my fights wisely, this is a concept that Donald will never understand.
@tamhaswords @moonpieluva @Longbow141 This a very important subject to me.. Go look up before and after pictures of the Earth, then tell me how you feel.
@realDonaldTrump. I want yu to know that I do not trust you or your top government officials. The United States is no longer a Country that nurtures it's history and protect its values. Our Country is eroding and you are the one who contributes most to this issue.
@VP @VP You must be talking to your boss @realDonaldTrump
@TIME Vladimir Putin... He has definitely accomplished alot when if comes to ripping this country apart.. 😒
@realBigBalls @moonpieluva @realDonaldTrump There is not really much Trump can do when it comes to North Korea because he has ruined any chances for a diplomatic solution. There is only so much that one can take when it comes to being disrespected, especially when it's in front of the whole world.
@ElyseBurden @washingtonpost Hopefully they won't let us down. 😕
@CNN @CillizzaCNN If North Korea does launch a nuclear missile and start  World War 3 how can anyone be mad. There's only so much disrespect and humiliation one can take, especially if you represent and entire country.
@bellyofdabeast_ @CNN @CillizzaCNN @DNC @realDonaldTrump @bellyofdabeast_ 	It is very difficult to report on anything else but Donald Trump's Behavior because he is constantly doing things that are below his status. As the man who represents this country we expect more and if you don't agree then that tells us alot about your character
@bellyofdabeast_ @CNN @CillizzaCNN @DNC @realDonaldTrump And for the record Al Franken has admitted his wrongdoing yet Donald Trump has yet to do in any situation. You can support him all day long but that doesn't change the fact that he is a poor leader and shows constant disrespect and indecency.
@bellyofdabeast_ @CNN @CillizzaCNN @DNC @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump brings the negative publicity upon himself. It is so hard to talk about anything positive because he shows negative and destructive behavior on a daily basis. I don't see how you can support a man who doesn't give a damn about no one but himself.
@AlexWhitcomb @moonpieluva He is full of 💩
@ElyseBurden @washingtonpost I'm going to trust God and put faith in these two gentlemen. Remember, it's not over until the fat lady sings.
@TheDailyShow This is not a surprise to most Americans who have sat and watched Donald Trump for the past 10 months. He has been accused of the same thing and it's obvious that he doesn't care because he still hasn't  condemned  Roy Moore  for his alleged allegations.
@washingtonpost I believe that Flake and Corker will follow their gut and make the right decision. They are the only Senators who have stood up to Donald Trump and put principal before party and in my opinion that says alot about their character.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker @realDonaldTrump And I hope you open your eyes to reality. Thank you for debating with me in a respectful manner, maybe this is something that you can teach Donald Trump.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker @POTUS You are trying your hardest to represent a man who has no class or decency. Answer this question for me do you agree with his indecent behavior? Would you want your children to look up to him and say the divisive things that he says?
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker @POTUS In my opinion Donald Trump is the devil's puppet. If he I was succumbing to the New World Order why is he isolating America. We are the only country in the world who is not a part of the Paris climate agreement. Now what does that tell you?
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker @realDonaldTrump It matters when you have a President with Destructive and Indecent Behavior. Donald Trump represents not only America but every American in this country and I am one who will not, I repeat will not, be complicit when it comes to his behavior regardless of what party he represents
@FoxNews @TheJuanWilliams @FoxNewsOpinion I definitely agree. These gentlemen put principal before party and that is something only a true American will do. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain and @JeffFlake. Your attitude and love for this country shows you're more than just a Politician, you're an Adult.
@CNN How I dress is not the issue. If I say no then that's what I mean, as a woman this is something you should know.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker @realDonaldTrump It seems as if you are following suit to the man you look up to. You know it's a lie when you say Donald Trump has a partisan view in politics. We all know that he has a specific base that he plays too and we all know that he is a huge critic of the Democratic Party.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker This whole conversation shows where you stand when it comes to Class, Dignity, &amp; Respect. It's obvious that you need to open your eyes to that as well. Don't be a follower be a leader.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker @SenBobCorker and @JeffFlake  are irrelevant to the actual problem. My focus is on @realDonaldTrump BEHAVIOR! I could care less about what anyone else is doing. How can I be proud to be an American if my leader doesn't carry himself with class and respect?
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker When you are @POTUS you carry yourself and represent your country in a certain manner. When you disrespect other world leaders, regardless of their behavior, you stoop to their level. We are better than that but he doesn't seem to get the picture.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker If you put your family and Country first I don't understand why you would be complicit when it comes to @realDonaldTrump's destructive behavior. @realDonaldTrump does everything but respect American values.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker And for the record Corker and Flake don't approve of Donald Trump's Behavior and half of the country doesn't either. These gentlemen have respect and dignity and like Flakes said there are times when you have to put principal before party. Maybe you should do the same.
@sheila06942158 @AP @SenBobCorker You praise Donald Trump yet you cannot admit that he lies and it's out of control. He clearly stated that @SenBobCorker supported the Affordable Care Act when we all know that he didn't. Stop 💋 Donald Trump's ass.
@sheila06942158 @tLKwoods @AP I'll give him credit when he start to carry himself like an Adult. I can't help but overlook his accomplishments because of his distructive behavior. Unlike you I will not be complicit and nor will I appraise him. And for the record, Obama card is old come up with something New.
This is where @realDonaldTrump's behavior has gotten us. There really could have been a Diplomatic Solution to this scary issue. https://t.co/UG7yA59kqy
@VP @POTUS Can I ask you a question @VP, Does American stand with Russia as well?
@Fox35Amy @Fox35News 😯 Wow...
@CNN Do the right thing Senators ☺
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump It was a clear typeo, the e and the r are right next to each other 😂😂 I have a question for you though.. What is the Dafuq? Lol. You have a good day Dean I'm going to watch CNN now 😜😜
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Have a good day @DeanJFlorence2 😁
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump 😂😂 The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room. 😂😂 It's clear that You are taking this conversation a tad bit too personal with all of the name calling so how about this.. Let's be adults and agree to disagree. I will leave the disrespectful language to you. 😜
@realDonaldTrump Can you explain how the tax plan will work, in detail, @realDonaldTrum? Like @SenBobCorker said, leave the work to the professionals.
@realDonaldTrump Your insecurities are showing more than ever.. Let's focus on the tax plan.. For your sake.
@realDonaldTrump I doubt that... Every time we see her she is quiet as a Church Mouse and I'm sure it because she does want to hear your disrespectful insults.
@realDonaldTrump And you are still talk about this why?? I would like to know the details of the tax plan, I'm sure all Americans can agree on this.
@TIME I think that we all can agree that this is a conversation that she should have with her father @realDonaldTrump.
@nytimes How long was he Press Secretary again 💁... Exactly. His opinion is obviously irrelevant to Donald Trump and everyone else.
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I don't care about how ligament MSN is all I care about is the facts. Besides I watch CNN 😜
@sheila06942158 @tLKwoods @AP Donald Trump did the same thing.. Now what campaign promises has he kept?
@sheila06942158 @AP You talk about Sen Warren but what about Donald Trump and all of the lies he's told.. He never apologize to @SenBobCorker for the lies he told about him. It's a shame because people really believe that this behavior is acceptable. 😕
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Believe me when I say I'm not afraid.. Its no secret that the government is currupt. Any sane person can see how destructive Trump and his behavior is yet he is still in office. The world will continue to spend no matter what.
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump I'm not worried about a Boogie Man, I'm more focus on clear evidence that shows proof of interferences from the Russian Government. The Ads and the Bots is all the evidence I need. Maybe you should look at my point of view and focus on the facts 😜
@realDonaldTrump 	Why do you always feel the need to put other people down? Are you that insecure? The whole Pocahontas comment was so petty. Put your Big Boy pants on and rise above the silliness, our children are watching and unfortunately some of them look up to you. 😕
I'm curious.. How could the Politician, who have work in government for years, allow @realDonaldTrump to continue to embarrass our nation? The "Pocahontas" statement was so disrespectful yet he is still in office.. Are you guys really that scares of Donald??
@BoycottTrumpFor @tonyposnanski When it's all said and done I bet that his supporters will come up with every excuse in the world as to why they still support him. I don't understand how and why is everyone so complicit to his behavior, it's disgusting and it is ripping our country apart.
@nytimes @JeffFlake I thank you for standing up to speak the truth not just as a Political Figure but as a Man with Dignity and respect.
@AP Roy Moore needs crawl back into the hole he came out of.. Fuking child molester
@realDonaldTrump This is hilarious because you don't even know the details of the tax plan. You talk about everything but the details, hell you barely talk about the tax plan itself.. In detail @realDonaldTrump explain how this plan helps the middle class. Don't worry We'll WAIT💁.....
@JohnPaul_USA @realDonaldTrump Do I take it you like to 💋 @realDonaldTrump ass too 😂😂
@CNN You can stand in the middle of a crowed room and I bet you anyone could distinguish your voice from everyone else's. It's time you step up and be a MAN @realDonaldTrump and admit your wrongs.
@washingtonpost This woman makes it harder for the next woman to tell her story.. How can she live with herself but hey this is an example of "MODERN DAY POLITICS" NO DECENTCY
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Yet you still continue to go back and forth with me 😂😂
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump And even if they didn't help the Ass that you look up to they are trying to rip this country apart. You and I are evidence of that.
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump It tickles me that you are so angery 😂😂 but facts are fact 😜😜 The Russians brought over 3,000 ads to help divide this country and it's disturbing that you really believe that they have not tried to divide this country.
@BoycottTrumpFor @tonyposnanski The face of a man with a wig 😂😂😂 This woman's reputation is in ruins.
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Okay, so why don't you explain it to me.. Don't worry I'll wait..............
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump And I'm sure that's all you can say.. He finds his way to confront anyone else but Putin.
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump And where is the evidence of that? In your words, I am utterly shocked that you can't put 2 and 2 together when it comes to Trump not acknowledging Russia's involvement in dividing this country. Stop 💋 Trump's ass and acknowledge the truth.
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump You are absolutely right.. It's Donald Trump 😜	And for the record, it is a serious problem when the Russian Government post divisive ads of FB and Twitter to try and divide our Country. You should check them out, I'm sure you will feel the same way.
@OfficialJonZal @moonpieluva @EdKrassen Donald Trump is the whole trash can 😂 and if you agree otherwise you are complisit to his Behavior
@DeanJFlorence2 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Hell he's in bed with all of Russia... Yu see that he leaves Putin satisfied 😌 every night 😜
@CNN @PressSec Little Girl you don't think about anything🙅, you say the first thing that comes to your mind to cover your bosses ass. Be a WOMAN and at least try to act like you have some class.
@JReyes51 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump This picture explains everything 😂😂😂
@benshapiro @_Trolls_Royce_ This is the world we live in today..
@washingtonpost SO the tape isn't enough evidence?? As @CNN says, this is an 🍎 you can scream 🍌🍌🍌 but this is a 🍎. FACTS FIRST!!
@realDonaldTrump Why are you still talking about Russia if you are not going to confront Putin, I'm sure you seen the ads that they have brought and posted a FB and Twitter? Something doesn't seem right..
@nytimes I think Donald Trump falls short in other areas as well 😂😂.. Maybe that's why he's been accused of sexual assault..
@Jeyn_the_Texan @nytimes So your kissing 💋 Moore's ass too??
@PressSec @WhiteHouse You are annoying and you sound like a man.. I've been wanting to tell you this since you became Press Secretary 😂
@nytimes I feel it would only be right if we give @realDonaldTrump a Trophy 🏆 for Fake President of the United States
@FLOTUS @WhiteHouse Let's not talk about not disrespect the FLOTUS she already gets enough of that from @realDonaldTrump. My prayers are with you @FLOTUS
@realDonaldTrump So can we give you a Trophy 🏆 for Fake President of the United States of America
@realDonaldTrump You remind me of a high school student who is mad because his click isn't as popular as the others 😂😂 Grow up Donald... I think it's time you put you big boy pants👖on.
@ladybugrn69 @So_Tweetie @handeone @realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump is a Reality TV star who has the title of the most powerful man in the world but look at where we stand in the world today.. He may hold that title of President of the United States but he is not a Leader
RT @dlnunezr: @So_Tweetie @spdustin @handeone @realDonaldTrump Please explain to me why a president and hero would care about tv ratings wh…
@So_Tweetie @spdustin @handeone @realDonaldTrump So that must mean you support his irrational disrespectful behavior. You have lowered you standards if you ask me.
@realDonaldTrump Yet you take the time out of you "BUSY" schedule to tweet this tweet... Are you sure nobody cares?
@DonaldJTrumpJr What's the difference, you defend and support your Father after all of the woman who has accussed him of sexual assault. 😒
@realDonaldTrump It's sad that you can't explain the details of YOUR tax bill.. Give information 💁that will help your "supporters" understand this horrible tac plan.
RT @UTMBColo: @JacobAWohl ‘He did touch my vagina through my underwear.’ — The 16 women who accused Trump of sexual assault are telling the…
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump And yet you still support Donald Trump's behavior... Don't you think it's time he steps down?
@TrumpGirls @realDonaldTrump For what?? 😂😂
America is slowly but surely stepping down from it's Responsibility as a World Leader.. This hasn't happened until @realDonaldTrump became President.
@nytimesbusiness @nytimes Thanks to Donald Trump
@DonaldJTrumpJr Tell that to your Dad 😂😂 No wonder he hasn't accomplished anything in his Presidency 😒
@DonaldJTrumpJr When will your Dad actually hold Russia responsible for Supposedly helping Hillary Clinton? I wont🙅 hold my breath for that either..
@NeoDJT @MatthewLumby @DonaldJTrumpJr And while we wait on that let's see if Donald Trump confronts Putin about supposedly "supporting Hilary Clinton" Seems like he doesn't Tell It Like It Is to everyone
@realDonaldTrump Damn.. Russia is still posting take ads on Twitter 😂😂😂
@realDonaldTrump Damn.. He is actually said something good about black people and women.. Is the world about to end??
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews How can you discredit @CNN when it's roots are from the country you run dumb ass? Just because you don't like what they report does mean you have to stoop so low.. SmH
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump If that is the case then why hasn't Donald Trump confronted Putin about it? 😯 Something doesn't seem right for a President who speaks his mind and tells it like it is..
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump The only person destroying America is the little boy you look up to.
@JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump There are 2 things he hasn't achieved "Class and Decency" something he will never have because people like you 💋 his ass.
@MissICU2 @realDonaldTrump Everything is on the list but his Campaign Promises 😂😂  You can stop kissing💋 his ass now
@IamPDJT000001 @Brimshack @AliceVincit @realDonaldTrump It would be alot easier if his Behavior didn't overshadow his accomplishments. @realDonaldTrump Maybe if you learn to control your mouth, your Tweets, and gain some class you wouldn't have this problem.
@realDonaldTrump But you still haven't managed to get a huge piece of legislation passed 😂😂
@nytimes Attitude reflects Leadership.. Now what does this tell you about the Man running our country?
@francineleroy @MAGAPILL @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Oh, you better believe it is. I am not a Democrat nor am I Republican but it is quite obvious where you stand. I am one who exercises My First Amendment Right to say how I feel about all the bullshit in our politics and if you don't like it you can 💋 my ass 😘
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews You only like @FoxNews because they kiss your ass.. @CNN W	will state fact and yu just can't handle them..
@francineleroy @MAGAPILL @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews For the record @francineleroy I state FACTS, Not Bullshit..
@MAGAPILL @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Yes and your President too.. We all heard the Access Hollywood tape..
@realDonaldTrump Is tht because Obama and his wife is on the cover more than you? Now that one thing you can't take from him or his wife 😂😂😂
@realDonaldTrump The only reason why yu passed it up is because YOU know it's a lie 😂😂😂
@realDonaldTrump The Last thing we need is Yu destroying this country.
@realDonaldTrump Looking at your hair is bad 😂😂
@JohnPaul_USA @realDonaldTrump Damn, you love kissing Donald Trumps ass 😂
@realDonaldTrump It seems like the Dems. aren't the only ones worried about Russia. If yu have nothing to worry about why does tht word constantly come out of your mouth?? 💁🙎
