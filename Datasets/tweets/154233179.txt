As I don't personally endorse criticism of $400M payment, not endorsing defense. But figure all should be able to read&amp; decide (OUT)
sr admin officials - unfreezing of funds was going to be done regardless on 1/17; had to make sure Americans out first (23-- END)
sr admin officials - can't say how many payments $1.3B spread over or how; through an unnamed foreign central bank (22)
sr admin officials - remaining $1.3B paid subsequently through Treasury in 'above-board way' (21)
sr admin officials - say they 'discussed openly' what happened on 1/17, just not 'every single detail,' no reason to discuss 'snags' (20)
sr officials- can't call it ransom. if quid pro quo, then it's $400 million for interest deal; prisoners in US for prisoners in Iran (19)
sr admin officials - no confidence the us prisoners w/b released; so US had to make sure they got out; call it 'tough diplomacy' (18)
sr admin officials - when prisoner in Virginia refused to accept pardon, Iran reconsidered deal; prisoner in Virginia accepted in end (17)
sr admin officials - when prisoners in US didn't want to go back to Iran, Iran asked US to influence them; US said no (16)
sr admin officials - located Rezaian's wife morning of 1/17; release still unclear; thought they may go back to Evin (15)
sr admin officials - Iran leaked news of deal before concluded; Rezaian's wife 'incommunicado' when she should have been going to plane (14)
sr admin officials - much less trust in prisoner talks; indications over final 48 hours the americans would never get out of iran (13)
sr admin officials - Hague talks had negotiators long familiar w one another; prisoner talks incl Iranians who've never met Americans (12)
sr admin officials - if iran had no certainty it would get the money, it wouldn't have agreed to settlement. (11)
sr admin officials - this settlement like previous settlements with Iran, only bigger. (10)
sr admin officials - if US refused to pay, Algiers makes awards enforceable in courts of other nations; Iran could go after US assets (9)
Sr admin officials - No question of not paying award. Algiers made awards final, repayment binding; Iran paid $2.5B to US people, firms (8)
Sr admin officials - Iran asked tribunal to hear case in Spring '15; US, Iran discussed hearings; substantial reward was coming (7)
Sr Obama admin officials - High interest rates in early 80s (up to 20 pct) supported Iran's claim for substantial interest (6)
Sr Obama admin officials - US always recognized Iran had right to $400M; question was the interest on account
Sr Obama admin officials - Iran's claim filed in 1981; tribunal took so long to get to it b/c it focused on US claims fin 1980s/1990s (4)
Sr Obama admin officials - Repayment of FMF account not a question of diplomacy, but of contractual rights &amp; intl law
Sr Obama admin officials - Culmination of prisoner talks coincided with decision to settle Iran FMF account from shah era (2)
Sr Obama admin officials on the $400M -- prisoner talks took 14 months, Iran sought more than 40 prisoners originally; (1)

@statedept must check record. this claim made 3X yesterday is false. "their $400M was awarded to them by the Hague Tribunal"
@StateDept confirms that US wouldn't pay the $400 m in cash to Iran until the prisoners were released
@state says of timing of $400m cash payment to Iran that US sought to maintain max leverage until prisoners were released.
