Last week, @VetAffairsDems held hearings with VA @SecWilkie, @DAVHQ &amp; @AmericanLegion to discuss the issues facing @DeptVetAffairs. As Chairwoman of Health Subcommittee, I will continue working with our VSOs &amp; VA to ensure our vets get high-quality care they've earned &amp; deserve. https://t.co/4cNkwg2GfW
That is why I am proud to support the Servicemember and Veterans’ Empowerment and Support Act, which will help make reporting and seeking care for military sexual assault easier, and ensure that these survivors can get the support and care that they have earned and deserve.
It is simply unacceptable that any member of our Armed Forces has to endure sexual trauma, and our country continues to fail survivors by putting up unnecessary roadblocks for them to get the care they need. https://t.co/sM6Lhwp0zR
I am looking forward to continuing to work with members of the Caucus to ensure our military has the resources needed to support our major range and test facility bases, like @NBVCCalifornia, which play a critical role in protecting the U.S. military’s technological advantages.
I am proud to announce that @DesJarlaisTN04 and I will serve as co-chairs of the Congressional Range and Testing Center Caucus in the 116th Congress. https://t.co/NiRxMlftMg
The Congressional Award recognizes young people for achieving goals in volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration. I look forward to seeing where the future takes both of these terrific young people!
Recently, I had the pleasure of presenting the Congressional Award’s Gold Medal to Mark Hanson of Oxnard and the Bronze Medal to Jacqueline Emanuel of Thousand Oaks. https://t.co/lQheUfrVVn
Recently, I met with constituents from the Southwinds Neighborhood of Oxnard to discuss their concerns and to hear how we can work together to ensure our cities and neighborhoods receive the support and resources they need to thrive. https://t.co/rxrogIFdYs
I will continue to work across the aisle to end the veteran homelessness crisis, ensure we continue funding important housing communities like the Ormond Beach Villas, and advance bills I’ve authored to strengthen federal programs that help homeless veterans find safe housing.
It is simply unacceptable that any veteran is living out on the street. Recently, I had the opportunity to tour the Ormond Beach Villas, a new affordable housing community designed specifically for veterans and their families in Oxnard. https://t.co/EDeqPx4ytF
Protecting every American’s right to vote is critical. That is why I am supporting the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will address the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder directing Congress to update the Voting Rights Act. #VRAA #RestoreTheVOTE https://t.co/no10qKPmOB
I support the Child Care for Working Families Act because it will:	☑️ Ensure parents have quality, affordable child care	☑️ Expand access to quality preschool	☑️ Ensure that teachers are paid a living wage so they can support themselves &amp; their families	 	#ChildCare4All https://t.co/E4rXXXRvDe

As a member of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, I will be focused on bold steps that we can take to ensure that our country's infrastructure is supporting and advancing our efforts to combat the climate crisis.
Infrastructure investment will play a pivotal role as we #ActOnClimate to steer our nation to a cleaner, greener future. This week, @TransportDems heard from experts on how we can help communities reduce carbon emissions and make our infrastructure more resilient. https://t.co/fi7C0keg8I

Today, I voted to permanently reauthorize the Land &amp; Water Conservation Fund, which has protected our nat'l parks &amp; open spaces for decades.

From the establishment of the 805UndocuFund, to the halt of the NRG power plant proposal, to ongoing efforts for community-driven change on the environment, I commend the good work that CAUSE is doing across the Central Coast.
I recently had the opportunity to meet with representatives of @CAUSE805 to discuss how the initiatives the organization is undertaking to address voter engagement &amp; participation, environmental justice &amp; climate change &amp; protections for our region’s working families. https://t.co/9jwxqx7OIH
I look forward to continuing to work with them to ensure all veterans have access to high-quality care in a safe and welcoming environment.
I was so pleased to meet recently with Paula Kemp and Suzanne Baeza with Veteran Sisters to discuss how the VA can better address the unique needs and concerns of the growing population of women veterans. https://t.co/I7mCtj6orN
Over the years, we've seen successful expansion &amp; growth of the Port as a critical point of entry to our economy. These projects will support growth of exports &amp; imports, reduce congestion &amp; most importantly, help create &amp; sustain good-paying jobs at Port &amp; throughout our region.
Yesterday, I had the pleasure of participating in the groundbreaking of critical upgrades to the @portofhueneme including wharf improvements, berth and harbor deepening, pavement improvements, and the modernization of cargo handling facilities. https://t.co/j7i9AljiAT
As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Quiet Skies Caucus, I will continue to fight to address the impact airplane noise has on my constituents.
Most recently, I co-sponsored the Air Traffic Noise &amp; Pollution Expert Consensus Act, which will require the FAA to sponsor a National Academies Expert Consensus Report, to ensure we have the best information on the health impacts of air traffic noise and pollution.
I have heard from many of my constituents in Ventura County about airplane noise in our district that is disrupting daily lives and diminishing quality-of-life, and I have been hard at work to address this issue in Congress.
Every student should have access to a safe, welcoming, and high-quality public school. That’s why I support the Rebuild America’s Schools Act, which would invest more than $100 billion to improve public schools across the country #BuildSchoolsNotWalls https://t.co/BJ1x57Q9uo
They include:	➡️Incentivizing states to implement extreme risk protection orders to keep guns out of hands of individuals in crisis	➡️Banning high-capacity magazines that make shooters more dangerous	➡️Reinstating assault weapons ban to get weapons of war out of our communities
There is no single answer that will stop all gun violence, but there are clearly common sense steps that we must take. That’s why I also support other critical policies that were introduced last week.
As we marked 1 year since #Parkland last week, House Dems moved forward with 1st major gun safety bill in decades. I’m proud to support #HR8, which passed out of @HouseJudiciary last week &amp; is a critical 1st step to keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them.
During #BlackHistoryMonth, we come together to reflect and honor the invaluable contributions the African-American community has made – and continues to make – to the fabric of our nation’s history. #BHM https://t.co/OjMOZ6tUoi

Vets who are in crisis or are having thoughts of suicide, or those who know a vet in need, can call Veterans Crisis Line for confidential intervention and support 24 hours a day. Call 800-273-8255 &amp; press 1, send text message to 838255, or chat online at https://t.co/225MWtcqxY.
In 2016, legislation I authored to analyze efficacy of suicide prevention programs based on gender was signed into law. This will continue to be major focus of mine as Chairwoman of VA Health Subcommittee because female vets face suicide rate nearly twice that of civilian women.
This week marks 4 years since landmark Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was signed into law &amp; while we've made strides in improving vets’ access to quality mental health care, there's still more work to be done to end devastating veteran suicide epidemic.

While this was an important step forward, there's still more that we must do to ensure workers have access to paid leave so they can continue to make ends meet &amp; pay the bills. In Congress, I'll continue to fight to ensure workers have access to paid time off when they need it.
26 years ago today, the Family and Medical Leave Act was signed into law, which ensured that hard-working Americans would not lose their jobs if they needed time off for a serious illness, to care for a sick child or an aging parent, or for the birth or adoption of a new baby.

While it is high time that President Trump finally agreed to reopen the government, the fact that he held 800,000 workers hostage to use as leverage for something he couldn’t get through the appropriate legislative process is simply reprehensible. https://t.co/xKSlzpxf6k
In Congress, I will continue to work to ensure that the VA is ready to meet the needs of this growing population of women veterans so they can get the care they have earned and deserve.
As more women serve our nation in uniform, it is imperative that they have access to high-quality, gender-specific care in a safe and welcoming environment.
Today marks six years since the Defense Department rescinded the ban on women serving in direct combat and opened our military up to a new generation of American heroes.
This decision is a slap in the face to thousands of trans servicemembers who've put their lives on the line in order to defend our nation &amp; I'll do everything in my power to ensure that every member of our Armed Forces gets the constitutional protections they’ve earned &amp; deserve.
Any transgender person willing and able to serve in the Armed Forces should be able to do so. Plain and simple. 	https://t.co/GL3m53ZEvk

Healthcare providers should not have to choose between providing comprehensive healthcare information to their patients &amp; critical aid funds. In Congress, I'll continue to fight to permanently repeal #globalgagrule &amp; ensure women around the world have access to the care they need
Two years ago, today, President Trump reinstated the inhumane and harmful #globalgagrule, which makes it harder for women around the world to get the healthcare services they need.

As a member of the Pro-Choice Caucus, I will continue to work to ensure that every woman is free to make her own decisions about her body and has access to a full range of reproductive health services.
Today is the 46th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which protects a woman’s right to choose. While we have come a long way in expanding women’s access to healthcare, it is clear that our rights are still under attack.
I am incredibly honored and humbled to serve alongside so many incredible women in the 116th Congress, and I look forward to working with them as we pick up the torch and continue to fight for equal rights.
Although there remains much work to be done to ensure equal treatment for all, we are reminded of all the great American women who are blazing a trail for one another and fighting for a more perfect union. https://t.co/wmfMyuJOCD
I know our solutions may vary, but we're all striving for a more perfect union where our democracy creates conditions for equality, opportunity, justice &amp; security for all. Those are the principles I continue to be guided by &amp; I know they are the principles you want me to uphold.
So it is on this day that I want to reiterate to you that I am working hard to represent your interests during this very challenging time, and I will continue to engage in a dialogue with you.
This is also Day 31 of the longest government shutdown in our nation’s history. As Martin Luther King would have made clear if he were here today, our democracy is stronger when we communicate with each other, and the best policy comes from collaboration.
Today is also the anniversary of the flawed Citizens United ruling by #SCOTUS that allows the voice of the wealthy few to have undue influence in our elections and our democratic process — making our country inherently less equal and less just, a far cry from Dr. King’s vision.
Today we honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — a man who dedicated his life to the principles of equality &amp; democracy &amp; who believed dialogue, not monologue, is essential to moving our country forward &amp; to more quickly bending the arc of history toward justice for all.

It's deeply disappointing that Trump is choosing to withhold disaster assistance, instead of working with our state to address devastating economic &amp; human toll brought by climate change, which has led to longer wildfire seasons that have wreaked havoc on our local communities.
Furthermore, while California has committed to a five-year, $1 billion forest management plan and has already invested $111.3 million on forest health since 2017, President Trump’s U.S. Forest Service budget has been cut by more than $2 billion since 2016.
Not only is his tweet cruel, but it’s also purposely misleading. Almost 60 percent of forestland in California is overseen by the federal government.
It is simply disgraceful that the President is threatening people’s lives and livelihoods by withholding resources that will help Ventura County rebuild from the wildfires that have devastated our community. https://t.co/C7D9bTnTX9
President Trump, and those who support this damaging political stunt, should re-open the government and then sit down like adults to discuss the most effective ways to protect our borders, while passing immigration legislation that reflects our values as a nation.
This week, we are trying again, bringing up funding bills that were written and passed overwhelmingly by Senate Republicans, but Senator McConnell has done an about-face and is refusing to move them forward.
On day one of the 116th Congress, the House passed legislation that would provide funds for sensible and effective border security measures – not an ineffective wall. But the President refused to sign it or even negotiate.
We can — and we must — do more to safeguard our borders while still upholding our long-standing commitments to those fleeing persecution and violence.
#TrumpShutdown is causing &gt;37K Californians, including many vets, to go w/o pay, treating hardworking families like political pawns &amp; actually creating more risk at border. That isn’t leadership. POTUS shouldn’t be purposefully causing harm to nation to further political campaign
Tonight, on the anniversary of the mass shooting in Tucson, AZ, that took 6 lives &amp; injured many others, including former Congresswoman @GabbyGiffords, I spoke on the House floor in strong support of #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.

From my family to yours, I’d like to wish you a Happy Holidays!
Trump needs to honor his commitments and understand that our democracy of divided government means not always getting everything you want. Holding government agencies and the America people hostage is not leadership, it’s a temper tantrum.
Democrats have offered several compromises to end this shutdown, including a bill that passed unanimously in the Senate — and that the President previously promised to sign — which included sensible and effective border security funds.
Not only does Trump’s 3rd shutdown hurt economy, undermine critical gov't services &amp; leave 800K workers without paychecks days before Xmas, but it also means expiration of Violence Against Women Act &amp; its critical protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. https://t.co/2udjHIiyCE

Instead of playing a game of chicken, the GOP leadership should allow the House to vote on legislation to keep the government funded.

Unfortunately, there is a massive backlog in overdue drinking water infrastructure maintenance that could result in millions of Americans losing access to clean drinking water supplies.
The Safe Drinking Water Act, which originally became law 44 years ago today, was a major milestone in our nation’s efforts to ensure that all Americans have access to safe, clean drinking water.
I pledge to continue to stand up for the rights of all Americans and these critical parts of the fabric of our nation.
Over the last two years, we’ve seen countless attacks on the free press, which is not only an attack on a quintessential part of our democracy, but also threatening the lives of journalists at home and abroad.

The conference agreement overhauls the dispute resolution process, implements a speedy complaint process, protects employees from any form of retaliation, and holds Members of Congress — not taxpayers — accountable for paying harassment settlements.
For months, many of my colleagues and I have demanded a robust, final conference agreement that improves the Congressional Accountability Act and better addresses sexual harassment and discrimination in Congress. I'm proud to say that this legislation passed yesterday.

As a member of @Transport @TransportDems, I’ll continue to fight to ensure we meet #FASTAct commitments to our local community, so that we can continue to address growing backlog of infrastructure needs, create jobs, reduce congestion &amp; improve quality of life in our communities.
President Trump has stated that he supports investing an additional $1 trillion in our nation’s infrastructure. I remain hopeful that this is one area where we can find agreement.
To keep our commitments to help state and local communities under the #FASTAct, the federal government will need an additional $20 billion annually —on top of our existing revenues— to avoid reductions in highway, transit, and safety investments.
Today marks three years since the #FASTAct was signed into law, which authorized investments in our nation’s surface transportation infrastructure. However, the FAST Act was not fully funded, and the Highway Trust Fund will run dry next year.

Our community was tested during this time – but from first responders and emergency personnel, to the many organizations and volunteers who supported the evacuation and relief effort, Ventura County came together to support friends and neighbors in need.
Today marks one year since the devastating #ThomasFire began. This fire, one of the largest in California history, burned over 280,000 acres and destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and homes.
I'm happy to announce $14.8M in federal funding for important infrastructure investments at Channel Islands Harbor, Ventura Harbor &amp; Port of Hueneme. This funding will help keep them open for business — good for our residents &amp; businesses alike. https://t.co/yeAfRFbfXW

Attention Ventura County residents and business owners: On Wednesday, December 5, @California_HCD is hosting a public meeting to discuss funding available that will provide long-term recovery assistance for those affected by the devastating #ThomasFire. Meeting details below. https://t.co/M7laS4Jh3E
It is time for Congress to strengthen this law, pass universal background checks for all gun purchases, and take serious steps to curb the devastating gun violence epidemic that has torn our community apart.
Today marks the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which made background checks a requirement for gun purchases from licensed dealers.
The VA must always act in the best interests of veterans, not in the financial interests of the President’s friends.
The Trump admin has a long track record of acting without transparency and accountability, and I’m pleased to see that the Government Accountability Office will be investigating this matter. Taxpayers — and our nation’s heroes —	deserve to know the truth.
Earlier this year, Rep. Annie Kuster and I called for an investigation into reports that friends of the President were unduly influencing the VA. https://t.co/tewH0lo3bz
Every day the Trump administration fails to fix the problem and make veterans whole, they are in violation of federal law. President Trump and Secretary Wilkie must immediately reverse course, fix the problem, and get our veterans their full GI benefits.
There's no doubt this situation has been exacerbated by many vacancies in VA leadership &amp; White House’s refusal to focus on many problems at VA. The announcement yesterday from Trump administration that the problem won’t be fixed until the end of next year is wholly unacceptable.
My colleagues and I on the VA Committee also held a hearing, demanding our veterans receive the benefits they have earned and deserve. The continued delays are putting veterans’ educations at risk and causing severe hardships.
For months, veterans have raised the alarm about not receiving their GI bill benefits from the VA. Earlier this fall, I urged the Trump administration to swiftly fix the problem and better communicate with impacted veterans. https://t.co/OJJjE1jdDU

Vets who are in crisis or are having thoughts of suicide, or those who know a vet in need, can call the Veterans Crisis Line for confidential intervention &amp; support 24/7, 365 days a year. Call 800-273-8255 &amp; press 1; send a text to 838255 or chat online at https://t.co/225MWtcqxY
Our servicemembers have made immense sacrifices for our nation &amp; it is our duty to make sure that struggling vets get the care they deserve. I'll continue to fight to raise awareness &amp; better address the devastating veteran suicide epidemic, because one life lost is one too many.
Today marks two years since the ‘No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act’ was signed into law. This legislation, which I wholeheartedly support, ensures that every veteran who calls the national crisis hotline will receive a timely response.
President Trump must end these assaults immediately and allow our immigration courts to rightfully do their job of adjudicating asylum claims
Seeking asylum in the United States is a right under our immigration laws. Using tear gas on lawful asylum seekers is a violation of our laws, and using tear gas on children and babies is an abhorrent human rights abuse. https://t.co/8QLExA0b6c
These effects will only get worse if we do not act now. I vow to continue to fight to move our country forward with more strategic investments in clean, renewable, and sustainable energy. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/gF7Qo1KXBK

So, as we honor our veterans, let’s do so by recognizing those here in Ventura County who live their lives, and have given their lives, in pursuit of a higher ideal. The ideal of community, of purpose, and of selflessness.
I saw it in our own Sheriff Geoff Dean, days from retirement, who lost a friend and who stood strong during this terrible ordeal so that others could find strength through him. And I saw it in all of our first responders, who sacrifice for our community every single day.
I saw it in the actions of Sgt. Ron Helus, who gave his life to save others. I saw it in the young people who carried their friends out of the bar to safety.
On this day each year, we recognize &amp; thank our veterans who embody those qualities &amp; who have served our country w/ such honor &amp; bravery. This year, we also acknowledge others within our community who demonstrate that same selflessness &amp; humility that our vets exemplify daily.
They both symbolize what is so special about the long and proud military tradition here in Ventura County — a dedication to the greater good, our shared values, and ceaseless humility and selflessness.
As we remember those who were taken from us this week, I want to mention two of them: Navy veteran Tel Orfanos and Marine veteran Dan Manrique.
As a community, we have weathered significant challenges in the past — by coming together and helping where there is need — and I know we will do so again.
As our community gathers together this weekend to celebrate and honor our veterans, we must first acknowledge the beautiful lives that were so tragically lost this week at Borderline Bar &amp; Grill.

I am deeply, deeply saddened by the horrific news of a mass shooting at Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks. To the families of the 11 victims and Sgt. Ron Helus – I cannot even begin to fathom the pain you are experiencing, but please know that our community is here for you.
Whitaker’s established conflicts of interest should immediately disqualify him from overseeing any aspect of the Mueller probe, which must be done with complete impartiality. The American people deserve no less.
Whitaker is a political loyalist who is well-known for wanting to shut down the Mueller investigation to protect Trump from the consequences of his actions.
Make no mistake, Donald Trump’s decision to fire Jeff Sessions and appoint Matthew Whitaker fits this White House’s long-established pattern of interference with law enforcement. https://t.co/0aUFn7cuKl

This #VacantVA is an insult to all of our nation’s heroes, and I will continue to fight in Congress to ensure VA has the high-quality leadership our veterans deserve.
President Trump must focus on identifying, properly vetting, and appointing a permanent leader at the Veterans Health Administration, so VA can enact the reforms that Congress has mandated and are desperately needed.
The VA has recently established a commission find to a permanent Undersecretary for Health – the 4th of its kind in the last 20 months. It's outrageous that nearly 2 years into his presidency, President Trump has failed to prioritize veterans’ healthcare &amp; fill this critical job. https://t.co/q5Nud7GaXz

The #VacantVA must prioritize filling the thousands of staff vacancies, especially for mental health professionals, so that access to care is never a barrier to receiving the mental health care services veterans have earned and deserve.
While we are making some progress, the fact remains that 20 veterans commit suicide every day and the suicide rate for women veterans is 180% greater than the suicide rate for non-veteran women. We need to address this issue with the urgency it deserves.
At last week’s House Veterans’ Affairs Committee hearing, we discussed ways in which we can raise awareness and better address the devastating veteran suicide epidemic. https://t.co/wSHSpkjESt

The consideration of a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is not something to hastily rush through.
These accusations about Judge Kavanaugh are incredibly serious. Survivors deserve to be supported when they come forward, not ignored. The Senate must not vote until this allegation is investigated. https://t.co/wfgscCxdQ2
By weakening the EPA’s methane pollution standards, the Trump administration is putting the oil and gas industry ahead of the well-being of hardworking families. This is a dangerous assault on clean air and our kid’s health, and we can’t let it stand. #CutMethane https://t.co/nViUHaQ3P4

During Suicide Prevention Week, I want to shed light on heartbreaking fact that every day 20 vets commit suicide. We all can play a role in ending this epidemic. From calling a friend, to checking in on a neighbor, to sending a text, you can make a difference in someone’s life.
This funding will help ensure that young ppl across the country, including in Ventura County, can take internship opportunities no matter their socioeconomic background. Providing affordable internship opportunities will go a long way in bringing more diverse voices to Congress.
As a proud supporter of the House Intern Pay Act, I am pleased to announce that Congress passed legislation yesterday to ensure House offices can pay interns.
All these investments will play a pivotal role in fueling job growth in Ventura County, which is good for residents and businesses alike.
The funding for Naval Base Ventura County will support the construction of three new facilities, which are critical to further solidifying our base’s essential role in U.S. national security.
The Port of Hueneme, Channel Islands Harbor, and Ventura Harbor are critical engines of our economy here in Ventura County, and this funding will help them stay open for business and continue to be positive contributors to our community.
Since coming to Congress, I've worked side by side w/ local leaders to bring add'l funding for Ventura County's port/harbors, as well as funding for Naval Base Ventura County. I'm pleased to see our efforts pay off once again in yesterday’s funding bill. https://t.co/tk8GuMmJw9
Parents shouldn’t have to choose between quality child care and economic security. That’s why I support the Child Care for Working Families Act – which will help families afford quality child care &amp; early learning programs #ChildCare4All https://t.co/YMULvINRT1
In Congress, I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure the VA is adequately funded so that our nation’s veterans have access to the care and support they need.
While I am disappointed that Congress has not agreed to funding for the VA MISSION Act, I am hopeful that we can work across the aisle to address this problem in the coming months because VA should not be forced to take from other veterans programs to pay for outside care.
The VA funding bill that passed yesterday expands support for our nation’s vets &amp; will help improve VA infrastructure, support the development and rollout of the new VA EHR system &amp; help VA continue to provide high-quality health care services that our vets have earned &amp; deserve.
Since 1994, #VAWA has provided critical protections for survivors of domestic violence &amp; sexual assault. Today, on the anniversary of its passage, I'm urging Speaker Ryan to bring #VAWA18 to the floor so that these vital protections do not expire at the end of the month.

The families of the victims of the Metrolink crash continue to be in my thoughts, and I will keep working in Congress to ensure rail safety is a top priority.
PTC systems help prevent collisions and derailments, and this funding will directly contribute to the improved performance, reliability, and safety of passenger and freight rail services in Ventura County and across Southern California.
I am pleased to see @Metrolink receive federal grant funding to upgrade its Positive Train Control (PTC) system in Ventura County and throughout Southern California to further improve rail safety. https://t.co/F8jPvYuvpW
As a nation, we will always stand with you and ensure that the memories of you and your loved ones will live on.
Today, we also honor the countless first responders, firefighters, police officers, and other emergency personnel who selflessly put their lives on the line to save others, as well as the survivors and loved ones of those who perished and whose lives will never be the same.
This is a constant reminder of all the young lives that were lost that day and all the potential that was stolen by this act of terror.
In 2015, I was honored to join students, faculty &amp; admin @RJFrankLobos in Oxnard to raise a U.S. flag in the school’s Memorial Quad in memory of students &amp; educators from Washington D.C. , who were on their way to Oxnard when they perished in the plane that struck the Pentagon.

It is long past time for Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell to allow Congress to do its Constitutional duty to hold the Executive Branch accountable.

I’m proud to support the House Intern Pay Act, because it’s critical that Congress today, and the Members of Congress of tomorrow, represent diverse backgrounds and experiences. #PayOurInterns
But there are many young people across the country, and in my district, who would like to intern but don’t have the means to do so.
While I never expected to serve in Congress when I interned for Congressman W. S. Stuckey Jr. (D-GA) many years ago, I know beyond a doubt that the experience was invaluable to me in my career and to my interest in public service and civic engagement.
I led 83 Members of Congress to call on VA to end ban on medically necessary treatments for transgender vets. More than 160K transgender servicemembers have put their lives on line to protect our freedoms, including right to live free from discrimination. https://t.co/A7fX78jDyP

Rather than sabotaging VA’s ability to recruit &amp; retain high-quality staff &amp; provide our nation’s vets w/ high-quality care, the President should start filling the #VacantVA w/ qualified personnel &amp; leaders who will ensure our vets receive the care &amp; benefits our nation owes them
The President recently announced that he would cut pay for employees at the VA, despite VA staff already being paid less than in the private sector.
Nationally, VA has 45,239 vacant positions, the vast majority of which are at the Veterans Health Administration, including doctors, nurses, clinical specialists, and other healthcare providers.
I've long been concerned about the high number of vacancies at VA, which are delaying care &amp; benefits for vets. In the recently enacted MISSION Act, we included a provision requiring VA to report publicly the number of vacancies. Now, they are out &amp; they are worse than I feared. https://t.co/BP6SIp4K6l
As a member of the Congressional Rare Disease Caucus, I will continue to work in Congress to support funding for critical research that will lead to treatments and cures for these diseases.

If the facts determine that the President did in fact commit the crimes he’s been implicated in, Congress must hold him accountable. The very heart of our democracy, and the future of our country, depends on it.
There are now five people in Trump’s orbit who have pled guilty or been found guilty of committing serious crimes. Our great democratic experiment relies on the rule of law, due process for those accused, and putting no one above the law.
The President of the United States was just implicated as a co-conspirator in committing federal crimes. On the same day, his campaign manager was found guilty of committing eight federal crimes.
Let’s be clear about #WhatsAtStake: Judge Kavanaugh is a direct threat to the ACA and protections for our loved ones with pre-existing conditions. Senators who support quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans must oppose this nomination. https://t.co/zAdgN8cO9t

As Ranking Member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Health Subcommittee, I will continue to work with the VA to ensure they are prioritizing efforts to recruit, hire, and retain quality staff to provide veterans with the care they deserve.
Without sufficient doctors, nurses, claims processors, and other key staff, our nation’s heroes will face long wait times to receive care they need and struggle with getting access to the benefits they are owed.
I agree with @AmericanLegion – addressing our #VacantVA is a top priority. https://t.co/nlvuHWPGjA
I am also deeply alarmed and disappointed that the President seems to care more about cronyism than how to best provide our veterans with the healthcare they deserve.
President has shown complete disregard for these types of checks &amp; balances &amp; ethics guidelines that are essential to strength of our democracy. I’ve called for investigation into undue influence at VA by friends of President &amp; will demand a wider investigation into this matter.

You can count on me to be a strong advocate for strengthening these programs and ensuring they are reauthorized before the September deadline.

This important legislation that provides protections/programs for victims of domestic violence/sexual assault also included new efforts for improving campus security, protections for victims, sexual assault reporting requirements for colleges. https://t.co/WT20kRgFb3
Make no mistake, this Trump proposal has one purpose: to limit women’s access to healthcare. In Congress, I will continue to fight to secure Americans’ rights to accurate health information, comprehensive healthcare, and to decide if and when they choose to have a family.

I will continue to fight in Congress to ensure hard-working families in Ventura County and across the country have access to the affordable, high-quality healthcare they deserve.
That is why I have co-sponsored the Undo Sabotage and Expand Affordability of Health Insurance Act of 2018, legislation that will not only roll-back the damage done to the ACA by the Trump administration, but also make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
President Trump and Republicans in Congress have engaged in a cruel effort to undermine the Affordable Care Act, and it has sent premiums skyrocketing and caused millions to lose insurance coverage — putting the health and well-being of countless Americans in jeopardy.

I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee to ensure that the VA is providing the quality care and options necessary for our veterans to age gracefully and with dignity.
Overall, Americans are living longer so we must be prepared for how to care for them, and this is especially important at the VA, as more than 12 million veterans across the country are over age 65. Today’s hearing gave us a lot of insights on what’s working and what’s not.
As Ranking Member of the @HouseVetAffairs @VetAffairsDems Health Subcommittee, I led a Congressional hearing in Camarillo today to shine a spotlight on long-term care issues to ensure that VA’s services are meeting our veterans’ specific needs. Watch here: https://t.co/uTWbS01qCz

I remain committed to ensuring that every veteran who wants to open a business and become job creators themselves have the resources they need to succeed.
Last year, I introduced bipartisan bill, Veteran Entrepreneurs Act, to take another step to make it easier for vets to start own business by lowering up-front costs for veterans opening a franchise — good option for first-time small business owners because of built-in support.
Today marks three years since the Veterans Entrepreneurship Act was signed into law -- legislation that makes it easier for veterans to start their own business.

We can't allow our national attention to move away from children who are still being cruelly &amp; unnecessarily ripped from their loved ones because of senseless &amp; heartless policy that the President created. https://t.co/GkotFaoEe7

Happy to see House pass @RepClayHiggins's Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act this week. This bill, which I'm proud to co-sponsor, gives veterans more flexible options for care as they get older by expanding access to medical foster homes, an alternative to nursing home care.
This week, I had pleasure of meeting with many of our nation’s Veterans Service Organizations, as well as my Democratic colleagues, to discuss what more we can do to work together to build better, stronger VA &amp; ensure vets receive benefits &amp; care they have earned &amp; deserve. https://t.co/U0Tu2lRKab

In Congress I will continue to fight to ensure that every one who chooses to bravely put their life on the line for our freedom, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation, is met with the respect and honor they deserve.
It is clear that the fight to protect every American’s ability to serve openly, proudly, and free from discrimination in our military is far from over. Ableness and readiness should be the only standards that matter when it comes to who is allowed to serve in our armed forces.
Today, we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the executive order that ended racial segregation in our armed forces. Sadly, today also marks one year since President Trump announced his discriminatory transgender troop ban.
As we celebrate #ADA28, we recognize that while this landmark legislation has made an important difference in the lives of millions of people with disabilities, there is still much work to be done to ensure public spaces are inclusive and accessible for all.
Today, the House passed the House-Senate conference agreement for #NDAA19. As the proud representative of Naval Base Ventura County, I was honored to be selected by my colleagues to represent them on the conference committee. My full statement here: https://t.co/mp3ZjQ403n

We cannot continue to let these positions languish unfilled, while our veterans wait for the much-needed reforms Congress has mandated to be implemented. From the executive suite to the front lines of care, this #VacantVA is undermining the service our heroes deserve.
It’s been more than 100 days since VA has had a permanent Secretary. Moving forward, it is imperative that Mr. Wilkie and President Trump prioritize filling the many other high-level vacancies at the Department, including Deputy Secretary and Under Secretary for Health.
I fully expect him to uphold the VA’s mission to serve all veterans – not pursue ideologically motivated policies opposed by our nation’s veterans service organizations.
I am deeply concerned about the many controversial positions that Robert Wilkie has supported. However, now that he has been confirmed, we must work together to put veterans’ needs first.
Healthcare experts agree: GOP attempts to sabotage healthcare system are responsible for increase in premiums. From refusal to negotiate plan to stabilize market, to attacks on ACA in #GOPTaxScam, they're doing all they can to undermine our healthcare. https://t.co/jJnOnD5Zxh

This #VacantVA is an insult to all of our nation’s heroes, and I will continue to fight in Congress to ensure VA has the high-quality leadership our veterans deserve.
President Trump must focus on identifying, properly vetting, and appointing a permanent leader at the Veterans Health Administration, so VA can enact the reforms that Congress has mandated and are desperately needed.
It is simply unacceptable that nearly two years into his Presidency, President Trump has failed to prioritize veterans’ healthcare and fill this critical job.
This week, the VA is set to start yet another commission to search for an Undersecretary for Health – the fourth of its kind in the last 17 months. https://t.co/7rHzEEbPyt
I call on Speaker Ryan to allow the House to vote on commonsense gun safety legislation now.
Today marks six years since a man entered a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and opened fire, killing 12 and injuring dozens more. Today, we remember those whose lives were senselessly taken and honor them by continuing to say #EnoughIsEnough.
Congress must address this humanitarian crisis and move forward with an immigration policy that actually reflects our values as a nation. The very soul of America depends on it.
President Trump has already failed to meet the court-ordered deadline to reunite children with their families, and what I saw today suggests we are still far from resolving this stain on American history.
What is most shocking of all is that all this trauma was purposefully caused by one man’s decision to use children as hostages in order to force Congress to advance his extreme immigration policies. These are not the values upon which our country was founded.
We met a grandmother today who was crying inconsolably because she was separated from her granddaughter and did not know where she was. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, and siblings are being torn from young children, who are still being kept in cages.
The American people should not be fooled — families continue to be separated.
While these reunifications were still joyous in many ways, it only served to underscore how truly heartless the President’s policy has been and continues to be.
Others seemed so in shock from the terror they had experienced, including being told that their parents had abandoned them, that they did not know how to react.
Some of the children were hysterical as they saw their parents for the first time in far too long, clinging onto them for fear they would be taken away again.
I watched tearfully as children were finally reunited with their parents after they had been cruelly ripped apart from their parents by President Trump’s senseless family separation policy.
THREAD: Today, I conducted site visits to facilities along the Texas border to assess the current state of President Trump’s cruel family separation crisis and efforts to reunite innocent children with their parents. Here’s what I saw: https://t.co/6WVVBG8iTo

As a member of the Congressional Burn Pits Caucus, I am focused on ensuring no veteran is forgotten or overlooked and that they receive the highest quality care possible.
This week, I took part in @HouseVetAffairs @VetAffairsDems roundtable to discuss healthcare needs of vets suffering from burn pit exposure. The effects of #BurnPits, which were widespread in combat zones in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan, have become serious health concern to vets. https://t.co/f5sqcfrj0t
Sadly, instead of attacking these known threats, their funding bill is focused on attacking our environment and undermining clean air, clean water, public lands, &amp; endangered species protections. Budgets are statements of values, and this bill does not represent Ventura County’s.
Given everything we know about Russia’s continued interference in our elections, it is simply unconscionable that Republicans in Congress are refusing to take steps to protect the very soul of our democracy.
On the House floor, House Democrats tried again to address this critical issue, but our amendment failed with not a single Republican member supporting election security.
For months, our intelligence agencies have been warning of continued attacks on our elections from Russia. Yet, House Republicans put forward government funding bill yesterday that completely eliminates federal election assistance grants to help states secure our voting systems.
#OTD 170 years ago, 200 women gathered at Seneca Falls and held the nation’s first Women’s Rights Convention. Today, we pay tribute to these great American women who blazed the trail for us all and honor them by continuing to carry the torch of progress forward. https://t.co/FOuOYl892c
Rather than harming children to further extreme immigration policy opposed by majority of Americans, President/GOP leadership need to work w/ Democrats to pass comprehensive immigration reform that reflects our values &amp; recognizes contribution immigrants have made to our success.
The Trump administration’s failure to meet the court-ordered reunification deadline speaks volumes to the administration’s callous disregard for the well-being of these children and families and to the values we share as a nation.
Congress needs to focus on ensuring that innocent children, who have been cruelly ripped from their parents’ arms, are safely reunited with their families.
Instead of working to reunite families torn apart by President Trump, or working on comprehensive immigration reform our country badly needs, Republican leadership wasted precious legislative time to pursue a political ploy.
Clearly, the President is refusing to protect our elections. Congress needs to act.
President Trump’s incoherent attempt to walk back his comments regarding Russian interference in our elections cannot undo the damage already done. He stood on world’s stage w/ a murderous dictator &amp; took his side over that of brave men &amp; women in our U.S. intelligence community. https://t.co/1blrUsHcO8

I stand with millions of active &amp; retired working families who paid into their pensions &amp; deserve &amp; demand retirement security. That’s why I support #ButchLewisAct to help Americans whose retirement security has been threatened through no fault of their own.
When will my Republican colleagues put their allegiance to our country before their allegiance to the head of their party?
Our law enforcement and intelligence agencies have left no doubt regarding the ongoing interference of Russia in our elections, and it is unfathomable that anyone holding the office of the President of the United States would fail to defend American interests.
It is simply disgraceful for Donald Trump to stand on stage next to the leader of a hostile foreign power who has and continues to attack the United States and the heart of our democratic process.
Never before in our history have we seen an American President willing to sell out our country, our democracy, our national security, and our people to a foreign dictator, thug, and murderer. https://t.co/ZvSi2exwlb

Think about it, the President of the United States, who said he has a better plan, is drastically raising the cost of health insurance for some, and actively taking away health insurance from others — all to replace it with... nothing.
This comes on the heels of Pres.'s decision this past weekend to freeze risk adjustment payments, injecting further uncertainty into health care market &amp; raising premiums, as well as his active efforts to sabotage coverage for more than 130M Americans w/ pre-existing conditions.
The Trump administration is once again trying to sabotage the #ACA by slashing funding for counselors who help people sign up for insurance — making it harder for Americans to access and enroll in health care coverage. https://t.co/Bq5CXjL35j
President Trump must immediately identify, properly vet &amp; appoint someone to lead VA’s HR operation.

The American people deserve SCOTUS justice who will protect rights we hold dear, not one who will take them away. I call on Senators, from both sides of the aisle, who support a woman's right to choose &amp; quality, affordable healthcare for all Americans, to oppose this nomination.
President Trump nominated @FedSoc-approved judge w/ specific intent to move court &amp; country to extreme right, including &amp; especially by overturning #RoevWade &amp; a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions, &amp; removing protections for individuals w/ pre-existing conditions.
Let’s be clear about #WhatsAtStake with the President’s #SCOTUS pick: nearly every aspect of our daily lives for generations to come. Reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, civil rights, voting rights, workers’ rights, healthcare, the environment, and so much more. https://t.co/sIknHSplqo

The administration must also consider the negative impact that tariffs can have on our political and economic interests, particularly when those tariffs are levied against our own allies, with whom we should have normalized trade relationships, not self-inflicted trade wars.
President Trump needs to end the escalating trade wars. The U.S. needs smart and strategic trade policies that benefit American workers, farmers, businesses, and consumers.
Retaliatory tariffs are also hitting U.S. auto-parts manufacturers and our agricultural producers hard. The latest Chinese tariffs announced on lemons and avocados – two of Ventura County’s most important products – will further hurt growers and workers.
President Trump’s trade policies are having a negative impact on many businesses and jobs here in Ventura County. An Oxnard business owner recently informed me that the South Korean steel tariffs would cost his business $1.2 million by October.
The President needs to end this humanitarian crisis that he willfully initiated. These children need to be reunited w/ their families immediately &amp; moving forward, we need to execute immigration policy that actually reflects who we are as nation &amp; values we uphold as Americans.
At the facility I visited, some children have yet to be able to speak to their parents, and the parents of other children have already been deported — leaving these children scared, alone, and with little-to-no information regarding their future.
It is also very clear that the federal government, under his leadership, is doing an exceptionally poor job of coordinating the reunification process.
It is very apparent that President Trump and his administration still have no real plan for how to reunite these children, and the thousands of other children separated from their families.
While CA has regulations in place to ensure basic care/accommodations are provided—&amp; caregivers within this particular facility were doing their best to help children—there's no guarantee that children separated from parents &amp; housed in other states will receive same treatment.
I witnessed the gut-wrenching sight of children who were cruelly separated from their parents by the President of the United States, through no fault of their own, and with no assurance if or when they will be reunited with their families.
THREAD: Today, I took part in a site visit of a Southern California facility that is housing immigrant children who have been separated from their parents due to President Trump’s inhumane and callous immigration policies.
This resignation is overdue. He rejected scientific fact, rolled back health protections, was threat to future of planet &amp; acted w/ corrupt intent on regular basis as part of what appears to be President’s attempt to fill swamp w/ as many unethical individuals as he possibly can. https://t.co/aFHtRKO9JY

The President needs to prioritize appointing leaders to these key positions so that the Senate can do its job and our veterans can have the leadership at the VA they deserve.
I am particularly concerned about the lack of leadership at the VA, where he has yet to formally submit his latest Secretary nominee to the Senate and has not even announced an Under Secretary for Health nominee. #VacantVA
There has been an unprecedented number of key positions left unfilled by the Trump administration, many of which he hasn’t even sent to the Senate for consideration. https://t.co/yNUrsWWyiZ https://t.co/StWtOojTrO
I agree with @USChamber’s Tom Donohue — we must stop separating families at border immediately. Americans from every corner are saying this policy is wrong. @realDonaldTrump, it's time to stand up for our core values &amp; end this now. https://t.co/1Jj6KjyRu5
42,500 people a day — including many children — are forced to flee their homes because of conflict &amp; persecution. Join me today on #WRD2018 to let refugees know that I will keep fighting to make sure the U.S. upholds its legacy of welcoming those in need. https://t.co/crF00q53Ly

On #Juneteenth, we celebrate abolition of slavery in the U.S. We also come together to recognize that there is a lot more work to be done to end racial &amp; economic injustice in this country. In Congress, I will continue the fight for these values &amp; honor those who paved the way. https://t.co/Q2g2xs0MGE
That is why I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct, which would prevent DHS from separating these children from their parents at the border. Know that I will keep fighting in Congress to put an end to this barbaric policy. #FamiliesBelongTogether
We must do everything in our power to #KeepFamiliesTogether and end the immoral Trump administration policy that is causing families to be torn apart at our borders.
To those who try to tear us apart with bigotry and hatred: Diversity is what made this country strong, and love and kindness for our fellow man will keep it that way.
Together, we must reject the vitriolic and divisive rhetoric that has permeated our public debate and is fueling acts of violence seeking to divide our country and instill fear in our friends and neighbors.
I am deeply concerned and disturbed by the marked rise in hate crimes that we have seen across the country recently, including right here in our own community. https://t.co/W6vMXc67ya
Thank you, Laura Bush, for speaking out about this cruel and heartless policy. We will keep fighting to end this inhumane and un-American policy that President Trump chose to put in place. https://t.co/LEdi8oScyT
Because of #GOPTaxScam, many Ventura County families will be paying more in taxes so the richest 1% can reap 83% of the rewards.

How can the VA best serve our veterans without nearly a dozen key leaders in place?

We need serious leadership at VA to ensure it has pipeline of providers entering VA &amp; staff to ensure they are on-boarded in timely manner. I look forward to continuing to work w/ my colleagues, VA &amp; VSOs to ensure VA is able to provide the best service possible to our veterans.
The VA has more than 30,000 vacancies nationwide, which is deeply concerning and has resulted in longer waits for VA care. The dearth of leadership at the top – a direct result of President Trump’s failure to nominate qualified individuals – is only exacerbating this problem.
Yesterday, I participated in @HouseVetAffairs @VetAffairsDems hearing to discuss bills, including to improve VA’s HR department &amp; pre-medical school training programs. https://t.co/xvbEvAE1b4

In Congress, I will continue to fight to see this bill become law and ensure survivors of domestic abuse are protected under the law.
For these same reasons, I introduced the “Protect Victims of Crime Act” to expand the U visa program for survivors of serious crimes, which will strengthen law enforcement’s ability to go after criminals and protect survivors from future abuse.
Victims of domestic violence, predominantly women, who come from countries where the perpetrator is not investigated, charged or jailed, should be protected, not returned for more abuse.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is absolutely wrong – federal law specifically provides for U visas for individuals who are escaping domestic violence. Because that is who we are as a nation. Jeff Sessions does not reflect our values, and he refuses to uphold our laws. https://t.co/GM82ESKPCE
Now more than ever, Congress needs to pass legislation to lay down permanent rules of the road for industry, while ensuring net neutrality continues to protect free speech, promote innovation, and advance civil rights.

While Iran deal wasn’t perfect, I believe it was best possible mechanism to stop Iran from continuing to develop nuclear weapons. This crisis that President has chosen to thrust us into, simply to score points w/ his base, is reckless &amp; has potential to make world far less safe.

Unfortunately, President Trump has taken steps to retreat from American global leadership in the fight for a better world. There is no better example of this than his decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, an action that will only put America behind rest of world.

Should Admiral Jackson &amp; Trump admin. move forward w/ nomination process, they should expect, &amp; our nation’s veterans deserve, thorough vetting of Admiral Jackson’s vision for VA, his qualifications to deliver on that vision &amp; pointed discussion regarding his conduct &amp; character.
I had reservations, given Admiral Jackson’s lack of administrative experience, and recent allegations have only added to those reservations.
The VA Secretary runs largest &amp; most important integrated health care system in U.S. — a difficult job, even for most seasoned administrator. Our nation’s veterans deserve a strong and steady hand leading the VA, putting quality care, without ideological bias, first and foremost.

That is why I introduced both the Women Veterans Equal Access to Quality Care Act (H.R. 93) and the Building Supportive Networks for Women Veterans Act (H.R. 91).
More women are serving our nation in uniform than ever before, so it’s critical that the VA is prepared to meet the unique needs of female veterans.

President Trump has attacked the scientific community time and again since coming to office – from prohibiting federal scientists from speaking about climate change to banning the words “evidence-based” and “science-based” in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention memos.
It is important that we continue to coordinate with allies, including England and France, to address this situation. Congress also must exercise its legal obligation to weigh in on any further action.
The murder of innocent men, women, and children using chemical weapons was a crime against humanity, for which President Bashar al-Assad must be held accountable.

In Congress, I will continue to fight for incentives for individuals to save for the future and to protect Social Security, Medicare, 401ks, and pension funds, which are critical components of a secure retirement for the vast majority of Americans.
During National Retirement Planning Week, I encourage all of my constituents to make sure you are planning now for the future.
Congress must balance our budget and reduce our debt – but we can’t do it by breaking the promise we’ve made to our seniors and veterans and undermining the middle-class. We owe our children and grandchildren so much more.
Now the House GOP is pretending to care about a balanced budget again, demanding passage of a constitutional amendment that would make huge cuts to Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits, and more.
Last year, the House GOP took us backward with their tax plan – increasing the debt by trillions to reward corporate outsourcing and the wealthiest 1%.
It’s clear we need to reduce our debt and deficit – which is why I voted in 2013 and 2015 for two-year bipartisan budget agreements that made hard choices but moved us forward with real progress on getting our fiscal house in order.

Today, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed H.R. 3288, which included legislation I authored to reauthorize the Southwest Border Regional Commission. The southwest border region has unique challenges in terms of goods movement and economic development.
Impeding an investigation because the President doesn’t like that he’s being investigated is the very definition of obstruction.
That is why I have joined many of my colleagues in signing a ‘discharge petition’ to allow the House to proceed even as Speaker Ryan stalls. Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley is also moving forward with a bill to protect the Mueller investigation.
For months, many Members of Congress have urged Speaker Ryan to allow a vote on legislation to prevent such interference. Unfortunately, Speaker Ryan has prevented the legislation from getting a vote.
It is critical that Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation continues without interference from the White House or Congress.

I look forward to continuing to work with our community partners to protect programs that support critical affordable housing throughout the county.
As a strong supporter of the HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) program – which is specifically designed to help veterans who are homeless find permanent housing – it gives me great joy to see it play an important role in this project.
Affordable housing is essential to creating strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities in Ventura County. This project is especially important to me because it will include housing units designated for veterans who are homeless in our area.
Last week, I was so pleased to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony for Cabrillo Economic Development Corporation’s newest affordable housing development, Phase II of the Snapdragon Place Apartments. https://t.co/NPqCmoRVPv

The United States has a moral obligation to do our part to address this humanitarian disaster and to help the innocent men, women, and children who are caught in the middle of this tragedy that is unfolding before the eyes of the whole world.
These people have endured unspeakable tragedy and are under the constant threat of chemical attack from Assad. I urge President Trump to reverse his discriminatory immigration policies and welcome refugees that have been thoroughly vetted by our national security agencies.
While the political and military situations are complex, one thing is abundantly clear: The United States cannot turn a blind eye to the millions of Syrian refugees seeking humanitarian assistance and a new home, safe from conflict.
The U.S. needs a clear &amp; consistent policy when it comes to dealing with Syrian President Assad, who is a war criminal and must be brought to justice. However, President Trump should consult with our allies &amp; with Congress before committing any more U.S. troops in this conflict.

We must stand against bigotry and hate and for tolerance and kindness. We must never forget Dr. King's dream. And we must continue to push forward every day.
Dr. King challenged this great nation to be greater, and he pushed us to fight for true justice and equality for all.  Today, we honor his legacy and recognize that it is on us to carry the torch of progress forward once again.
As we reflect on the five decades since he was assassinated, we must confront the reality that while much progress has been made, we are still far from achieving the dream Dr. King had for our country and all of its people.

His decision is not only bad for our economy, but also our health, increasing air pollution for generations to come. Our state has led the way in improving fuel-efficiency standards &amp; this misguided policy is a giant step backward for which our children &amp; our economy will pay.

Roughly 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over course of her lifetime. Eliminating information about this deadly disease from Office on Women's Health website is an affront to every woman, and her loved ones, whose lives have been impacted by breast cancer.

Given the administration’s constant barrage of insults aimed at immigrants, it’s likely that this question will result in a skewed and inaccurate Census that could hurt taxpayers in states like California.

This legislation reduces investment in education &amp; eliminates programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which incentivizes public service by helping teachers, police officers, public defenders, healthcare professionals &amp; other public service employees repay student loans.
The so-called #ProsperAct, a Republican effort to cut nearly $15 billion from federal student aid, would put corporate profits before students.
I look forward to meeting w/ Admiral Jackson &amp; discussing his qualifications to oversee the largest integrated health care system in the U.S. &amp; his vision for how VA will continue to succeed in its mission to provide high-quality care &amp; timely benefits for our nation’s veterans.
Our veterans deserve a strong and steady hand leading the VA, not the chaos and in-fighting that we have seen in the past year between those who are committed to serving veterans and the ideologues who want to privatize the VA.
With this change, I am deeply concerned by the significant turnover in senior VA leadership in recent years and the negative impact that this has had on the VA’s ability to succeed in its mission to serve veterans.
I am thankful for Dr. Shulkin’s service to our nation’s veterans and the important progress we have been able to make working together over the past few years.
We must do all we can to move our country forward with policies that will stop pollution, protect public health, and build a competitive 21st Century, clean energy economy.

Trump’s decision to elevate him to a key role – responsible for the security and safety of our nation – should be a grave concern to all Americans.
Mr. Bolton has demonstrated a profound lack of good judgement on national security matters in the past, and continues to demonstrate poor judgement as he advocates for a preemptive war with North Korea.
Yesterday, President Trump announced that he has decided to make John Bolton, one of the chief architects of the Iraq War, his National Security Advisor.
Whether you supported the Iraq War or opposed it, it is clear the decision to invade Iraq in 2003 has had profound, negative implications for our national security for the past 15 years. https://t.co/6gYANcuDj4

There are deals on the table with support across the aisle that protect Dreamers and make border security more effective, but the President has lobbied against them, stalling progress on a bipartisan compromise. The President created this mess — he needs to lead on addressing it.
However, Congress still must act quickly to pass legislation to provide permanent protection and finally get Dreamers out of perpetual limbo.
President Trump’s arbitrary deadline on Dreamers has arrived. The Supreme Court’s decision last week means that those seeking a DACA renewal will have a temporary reprieve from the threat of being ripped away from their families, their jobs, and the only home they’ve ever known.

SCOTUS decision today provides temporary relief for those who are living in fear of being callously &amp; arbitrarily ripped away from their families, jobs &amp; only home they’ve ever known. While this temporary reprieve is welcome, Congress must act to permanently protect Dreamers.
We need to go back to the drawing board and pass real, bipartisan tax reform that gives a better deal to working families in Ventura County, not a giveaway to special interests and the mega-wealthy.

There are ways to prevent gun violence. One bill I support is the Gun Violence Restraining Order (#GVRO) Act, which allows family to get court order to prevent loved one from purchasing gun if court finds they pose risk to themselves/others. It can help prevent tragedies.

I implore Speaker Ryan – for the sake of children and families across our nation – please allow a vote on these bills! We cannot let another horrendous act of violence go by with no action from Congress.
-Gun Violence Restraining Order Act: allows family members to seek a court order to prevent a loved one from purchasing firearms, if the court finds the individual poses a risk of injury to themselves or others
-Assault Weapons Ban: reinstates the ban on semiautomatic weapons and large-capacity ammunition clips, while protecting hunting rifles	-Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act: bans so-called ‘bump stocks’
Here are just a few of the commonsense bills that I have co-sponsored that could make a difference:	-Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act: expands background checks to cover all commercial firearm sales
We must have the courage to act. Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed by a gun than residents in any other developed nation. No single policy is going to stop every shooting – but there are clearly ways to prevent gun violence that can save lives.
Children should be able to go to school without fear. It is abhorrent that Congress refuses to even try to do something about these constant, preventable tragedies.
I am heartbroken once again by the news of another fatal school shooting. I am holding each of the victims and their families in my heart tonight. https://t.co/WutAQXbqOd

I vow to continue to work with my colleagues in Congress and the VA to ensure that all veterans get the mental healthcare they deserve -- because one life lost to suicide is one too many.
This new data will help the VA and policymakers have a better understanding of where to focus resources, especially for female veterans, who face a suicide rate 250 percent higher than civilian women.
In 2016, Congress passed legislation that I authored to amend the Clay Hunt Act to require the VA to analyze the efficacy of suicide prevention programs based on gender.
Today marks three years since the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was signed into law. While we’ve made progress in improving veterans’ access to quality mental healthcare, there is still more work to be done to end this devastating epidemic.

We cannot take even the smallest step backward when it comes to fighting for equality. That is why I support the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation to ensure better enforcement of laws against wage discrimination.
Sadly, just a few months ago, President Trump halted a critical initiative that helps us fight pay discrimination and create a level playing field for women and for minorities.
Nine years ago today, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law – making a strong statement that equal pay for equal work is at the cornerstone of American values.

I will keep fighting to make sure that patients come first and that nothing gets between a woman and her healthcare.
We have come a long way since Roe in expanding women’s access to healthcare, but it is clear that our rights are still under attack in this country and across the globe.
Yesterday was one year since President Trump reinstated the global gag rule, which makes it harder for women around the world to get the healthcare services they need.
This week marks two important anniversaries related to women’s access to health. Monday was the 45th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, which protects a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her body.
Last week, I asked @POTUS to sign my bill to authorize him to award Medal of Honor to Sergeant Major (Ret.) John Canley of Oxnard. He risked his own life to save dozens of men during the Vietnam War. This recognition, which is supported by Defense Sec. Mattis, is long past due. https://t.co/g2GbFtZDoD

I spoke about what we need to do for our veterans — and the shared commitment on both sides of the aisle to provide those who served our nation with the benefits they've earned and deserve. But we must end the #TrumpShutdown and implement a long-term budget agreement to do it.
Today, I joined my Democratic women colleagues to call on our fellow members of Congress to move forward on our collective bipartisan priorities. https://t.co/mOe6R7ouqy
I know many are concerned about the government shutdown &amp; I am, too. I do not support the shutdown or circumstances that got us here. While I work to hammer out deal focused on Ventura County’s priorities, here's info about gov't services during shutdown: https://t.co/63lY09Kkit
Tonight, Democratic Members asked unanimous consent to bring up a bill to immediately re-open government, but were denied recognition by the Chair. Very disappointed we couldn’t get agreement on this today.
More information on which government services will be unavailable during the shutdown can be found here: https://t.co/Q7L1M4LqxF
The Disaster Recovery Center in Ventura and the satellite location in Ojai will remain open during the shutdown. More details about those here: https://t.co/uY216onZO1
My office will remain open to assist constituents with urgent needs during the government shutdown, including those impacted by the #ThomasFire &amp; veterans with inquiries about benefits. If you have questions or need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact me at 805-379-1779.
Make no mistake, this shutdown is President Trump’s shutdown. My full statement here: https://t.co/bygRyRQGOp
Se ha abierto un centro de recuperación de desastres en Ventura para proveer asistencia a los residentes afectados por el incendio Thomas. También se abrirá una ubicación satélite en Ojai mañana. Para más detalles visite: https://t.co/uY216onZO1
A Disaster Recovery Center has opened in Ventura to provide residents affected by the #ThomasFire with a one-stop-shop for disaster assistance. A satellite location will be open in Ojai tomorrow only as well. Details here: https://t.co/uY216onZO1
But President Trump, Speaker Ryan, and Majority Leader McConnell have decided to go their own way, to shut down the government — the havoc it wreaks be damned. There is still time. We need to stop this shutdown and hammer out an agreement. I stand ready.
We support extending the children’s health insurance program and community health centers program, and we agree that we need more disaster relief funds for the Thomas Fire and other disasters. And we support protections for DREAMers.
The truth is, all Democrats and many Republicans want a long-term funding agreement that eliminates the harmful sequester and adjusts budget caps for the military and domestic programs.
That’s why I remain ready, willing &amp; eager to work w/ GOP to negotiate bipartisan agreement that would address many challenges facing our nation. But I couldn’t support another month-long funding patch that abdicates our responsibility to make hard choices/do real governing.
Let me be clear: I do not support a shutdown. It would harm our military and the many federal employees who live and work in our community. It would weaken our economy, and it would hurt our nation’s veterans.
With control of House, Senate &amp; White House, Republicans control whether the government shuts down or not. They can either work with Democrats, which they have completely refused to do, or they can proactively elect to let the shutdown proceed, which they are barreling toward.
We need to keep politics out of the patient-provider relationship. The government should not be interfering with a medical professional’s judgment.
Instead of spending time negotiating a bipartisan agreement to prevent a government shutdown, House Republicans wasted more time today forcing us to vote on another bill that attacks women’s access to healthcare – the 7th time this Congress.
This failure of leadership is deeply irresponsible. #DoYourJob
Yesterday, my House colleagues &amp; I asked President Trump about this very issue, pointing out that there is bipartisan consensus on many issues. But instead of responding to us, and doing the job he was elected to do, he continues to allow the possibility of a government shutdown.
Last night, Senator Schumer asked to resume bipartisan talks to avoid a shutdown, but Senator McConnell refused. The House and Senate GOP Leaders’ go-it-alone strategy is bad for our nation. We must resume bipartisan talks immediately and prevent a shutdown. https://t.co/30NsjiOePK

As Ranking Member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Health Subcommittee, I believe Congress and the VA must do more to end veterans’ homelessness.  It is simply unacceptable that an estimated 40,000 veterans are living on the street today.
Medical standards &amp; patients' health must always come first. A taxpayer-funded effort that restricts access to healthcare &amp; puts lives at risk is simply wrong. I urge Trump administration not to move ahead w/ this discriminatory effort that will compromise quality of healthcare. https://t.co/lh8oVjPEtJ
