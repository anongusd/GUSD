To be a Navy SEAL or SWCC, you must first be in the NAVY. The first stop in the training pipeline is Recruit Training Command, known as boot camp. In this episode we visit RTC and learn more about boot camp for NSW candidates. https://t.co/BGmjwaMgjS 	#SEAL; #Navyrecruit; #NSW
The open water can be deadly, and Navy SEALs and SWCC must master this unpredictable element to make it their ally. This episode explains NSW's secret technique: the Combat Sidestroke. https://t.co/5CK5vOKbaE 	#SEAL; #SWCC; #NSW; #training; #CombatSidestroke; #swimming; #PST

@GurdianAngel01 We have guys come through that are all shapes and sizes. We've seen Olympians, professional athletes and your average joe.
@thecooperfarris Application process can be difficult, however it emulates the training process. Nothing is going to come easy. #navyseals
@ColumnsIVCards Each special operations group has specialized training they go through. The #navyseals go through extensive water training.
@ivanharangozo You have to slowly acclimate your legs to fins. You aren't allowed fins during the PST.  Fins are used during open water swim
@dylan_stolp for enlisted guys there is a very slim possibility of a second chance.  However if you don't make it, you have to wait 2 years.
For more information about Hell Week and the rest of #navyseals training, head over to http://t.co/ua9IFqPt.
@VIAlpha Candidates have to go through boot camp then move on to NSW Prep School.  You have to become an @USNavy Sailor first! #navyseals

Thanks for your questions! We are answering questions tailored to training. #navyseals
