@AdamParkhomenko Who cares.
@AdamParkhomenko Says the democrat strategist. You better sweat..6 more years.
@TomSteyer More than you’ve ever done Tom you dirt bag.
@PreetBharara Do you have some sort of truth machine or physic ability to make this sort of statement that he’s credible this week? Even know the first part of your tweet affirms he’s not? Want your cake and eat it too. What’s wrong with you people.
@TomSteyer Oh really Tom..your ridiculous. I thought according to you we had passed this point long ago? Just another day with your ranting about impeachment. Pack it up hack!
@vgescobar Then tell congress to fucking fix it and stop passing the buck.
@RepScottPeters @nbcsandiego Wouldn’t a solid wall stop the sewerage?
@TomSteyer Fuck CARB and fuck you Tom.
@TomSteyer @AOC So Tom, your choosing a platform of climate change and impeachment to run for President. Are you fucking stupid?
@TomSteyer Each govoner should be impeached Tom.
@HarleyRouda @tedcruz Fuck every last one of you.
@MotherJones @FLIPCA50 It’s like a boxing match with one guys hands tied behind his back. I hope opposition emerges.
@TomSteyer Congress has done a great job right Tom.
@TedJacksonCA @sfpelosi @AdamParkhomenko Where’s the American flag you puke.
@LaurieBlackSD @ACampaNajjar Wonderful words. To bad for a politician who’s granddaddy was a Munich terrorist..
@sdutIdeas @realDonaldTrump I don’t know, maybe sewerage can’t flow thru a concrete wall. Just saying.
@themaxburns @AdamParkhomenko Ya, so he should not eat? You fuck.
@ScottPetersSD @BillKristol Somebody on the left updated the playbook lately to use “King” and “Monarch” since nothing else seems to turn off the support for the “ACTION” coming out of the white house. Maybe this will work for you fucks. But I doubt it. The people have spoken and your being held to account.
@MikeLevinCA Ok, and then what will authoritarian leftist do? Take everyone’s guns? You idiots, it’s not like putting an emphasis on securing the border takes freedom from Americans. I don’t like guns, but assaults against freedom from rhetoric like this will create a national emergency.
@johngramlich @govtrack Who cares?
@KamalaHarris And how many jobs will work at the border create. Or you’d prefer we need you to portion our income to us with government wasteful programs.
@KamalaHarris How much do you cost tax payers with your leftist policies?
@TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump Tom, I’m going to count the days of your stupid tweets. The first day you shut the fuck up for the whole day I will celebrate.
@vosdscott I do a lot of NAVFAC work, I imagine it will gut the next fiscal year spending for DOD.
@GavinNewsom What? The fuck are you talking about Gavin.
@Sootch00 Ya...try to take guns away from Americans by declaring gun violence a national emergency and your defiantly going to have a national emergency.
@TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump New word for the propaganda campaign on twitter today eh Tom. King? You, and people like you are the problem in our country.
@TomSteyer @jaketapper Really? Oh thank you Jake.
@GregYarbrough @joerogan
@TomSteyer Tom, seriously. Your like a child. Pout somewhere else. 6 years Tom.
@TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump @AOC So by undermining the office of the President of the US with you ego driven campaign about impeachment from the sidelines your doing what exactly Tom? Your so stupid I can’t believe it.
@TomSteyer Categorically..fuck you Tom.
@FLIPCA50 @ACampaNajjar @allinwithchris @realDonaldTrump @IlhanMN @Rep_Hunter He’s not my candidate.
@TomSteyer @JerryNadler No Tom, we won’t. We would prefer our government do it’s job instead of play your stupid games.
@GaggleReport @AdamParkhomenko Want to see a full investigation of this guy to see his ties to the DNC.
@joerogan What in the real fuk is wrong with these people!!!!!
@TomSteyer Tom, you mean some of the troops, after the folks in uniform told these government hacks how much the gaurd is helping at the border.
@Comey Turn them to the dark side early right Comey.
@TomSteyer Great source Tom.
@TomSteyer Says the billionaire. What’s this us shit Tom?
@CNNOpinion @julianzelizer Horse shit. History will judge you  corrupt fuckers at the networks. Your days in business are numbered. You killed journalism.
@RealCandaceO Um...all that liberal education, reading comprehension slipped through the cracks. Maybe next time don’t respond to the question if you don’t understand it.
@billmaher No no you stupid liberal fuck. Congress and you and talking heads like you are the problem.
@TomSteyer Tom, take a breath. You can’t keep this up for the next 6 years.
@EricSchultz What’s the full context of Issas quote. Was it perhaps in response to Dems?
@elonmusk need help building a proof of concept for a SIP based modular folding emergency/Shelter with a foundation and mechanical made from ECORE board made from (Cow Shit) stronger than masonry rapidly house millions with ease..and create many jobs in the supply chain world wid
@jordanbpeterson Perhaps the social environment has changed, now it’s important to ensure our children are competent in the new social environment (online) rather than keeping them alway from it, teach them how to wield it..perhaps these things are filling a primal vacume within.
@TomSteyer @JohnDingell @RepDebDingell Tom, you and I know you could give a duck. Your so fake it’s almost funny. Go away.
@Need2Impeach @TomSteyer You’ll be accountable for all these tweets later. History will tell just how wrong you are, and as it unfolds you should be accountable..let’s see how that goes...
@TomSteyer Tom, your kind of a moron. We are not stupid and want you in government.
@TomSteyer Tom your a giant cry baby.
@TomSteyer Tom, it’s so good your rooting against the president of the United States. The glee you take in trashing our democracy is so patriotic. Your pathetic.
@TomSteyer Tom, what ever shall we do. Will you save us? The rest of us are to stupid to figure out what to do without your valiant leadership to make sure we don’t die.
@FLIPCA50 @SDIndivisible K streets waiting. Good thing CA50 has good representation.
@TomSteyer Your so full of shit Tom.
@SDIndivisible @FLIPCA50 Poor guy had to do his own press conference. Doesn’t look like anyone even noticed by his twitter hits! https://t.co/0sHkPFyINg
@TheDemCoalition Polls are such an accurate way to predict the future. Man, can’t believe that it sure likes bad for Trump in 2020...shoot.
@TomSteyer Tom, let me get this straight. This is your plan to run for President? To make your entire run on a platform of talking shit about Donald Trump? How do you think this will work? I don’t like you at all.
@TomSteyer Tom you are so full of shit. This is some fake, kiss ass virtue signaling. Politics at its finest. Disgusting that you would put this out here like you give two fucks. Dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Watch your mouth dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition You wish dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork. You look like a ground hog.
@elonmusk please help. Designed a foldable SIP structure with a modular layout, mech, and foundation. adaptable structure built from 0 CFC materials need to build the prototype emergency shelters (earl huts). (8’x2’x16’) shipping size. 20 + year life cycle. Please contact me.
@TheDemCoalition The research team is probably totally unbiased doing great nonpartisan work right? What a joke.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Dork, your not even fake news #wannabepundithack
@funder @TheDemCoalition Nice spin Dork.
@Lady_Star_Gem @SenWarren @JulianCastro @SenGillibrand @KamalaHarris @CoryBooker Trump.
@ananavarro @StormResist No Anna, because it’s not important. Pundits should quiet down and ease the tensions since after all your all useless humans.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Says the dork tweeting and bitching all day. How is it working blaming others for the Democrat loss two years later. When Trump is re elected in 2020 I hope you will shut the fuck up finally. Dork.
@funder Dork.
@funder What have you done to help immigrants dork?
@funder How much do Democrat witch hunts cost us dork?
@funder And who’s lap dog are you dork?
@TomSteyer Hey Tom, if you’ve been saying it for over a year, maybe your wrong? Just saying.
@TomSteyer Please shut the fuck up Tom. Your a danger to our nation. You have no business in politics.
@TomSteyer Really Tom..didn’t the Pole numbers say Hillary was going to win, and were wrong? So....aren’t pole numbers wrong all the time Tom you idiot?
@FLIPCA50 @Rep_Hunter @ACampaNajjar He’s the grandson of one of the Munich bomber right? and he’s going to run again in this district? Doesn’t stand a chance.
@DemWrite @StormResist Who are you talking to?
@ProudResister @StormResist Your tweet embodies the division in America today. You are as culpable as the rest of us for the state of the union.
@TomSteyer Don’t see you using your resources to do any good except feed your lame dorky ego Tom. Stop. Go home turd.
@TomSteyer The facts also show no one likes you Tom.
@roflinds @AdamParkhomenko At least you were there. No one should be defending the idiots in the red hats but the narratives that have emerged with captions and still photos are spinning the encounter into something it’s not. And that’s wrong regardless of how stupid those guys are....
@GovernorBullock @JDScholten Amen.
@cnnbrk And they should have. Now twitter should act on the rest of the slanderous ideology being spread to divide the country.
@Augustus709 Watch the video. The native man walked right into the crowed beating his drum taunting them. No one hurt that man. They even gave him space. He volunteered to walk into the crowed, beating his drum, was given space while he taunted them, and they danced So stop spreading lies.
@Alyssa_Milano Seditious crap like this divides the nation.
@elainejgodfrey Group identity. Go fuck yourself jerk off.
@Comey Shut up Comey. I hope your laughed out of politics as fast as your career in the FBI. Your an idiot.
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump And you? How many minutes did you spend on national TV honoring the heat man Mr. King? How much air time did National TV give trump in respect to your comment. Moron.
@HawkeyeResists @StormResist Maybe watch the video again and report back the actual sequence of events. That man walked beating his drum right into the crowed antoginizing them. And good for him. No one in the crowed hurt that man, and the spin is nauseating.
@Alyssa_Milano Oh because the “women’s march” is really about women’s health. Every “protester” interviewed and speech made on soap boxes was about left wing political ideology and Trump Bashing. Stop lying.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@funder @TheDemCoalition Let’s see Dork.
@Alyssa_Milano @TheDemCoalition If you try to suggest using your seditious propaganda that the morons in that video wearing red hats have anything to do with me and my views because I don’t support your ideology your hurting America. The democracy worked and the president was elected. Get over it. 2020.
@TomSteyer Who’s being pessimistic Tom? High pot, I’m kettle.
@StormResist Blah blah blah.
@funder Did you cite yourself on s their rate media Chanel dork?
@funder Sedition is about her word you should learn dork. Your guilty of it.
@TomSteyer Fuck off Tom. You are rejected by the American people. Your a scummy little billionaire. Stay the fuck away from Washington.
@funder @TheDemCoalition # Dotk is the teachers pet,
@funder @TheDemCoalition @AOC Slanderous dork. You should be fined and inpisdoned in s Jail for trolls.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @AOC Because it’s so normal. Morons...maybe he just doesn’t have time for freshman. Dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork, you even look like a little troll in addition to being the quintessential internet type. Your a dork troll!!!
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Dork. You suck more.
@KimBondy @TheDemCoalition Instead they want to grandstand and March (freshman) to Mitch Mcconneks office... east of our time.
@briantylercohen No one likes Tucker. Just ask John Stewart.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @senatemajldr Shut the fuck up. Signed everyone. Dork.
@david_hemond @TheDemCoalition Sore losers.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@cnnbrk Maybe they should vote in meaningful shit instead of collective virtue signaling!!!!!!fuck you congress do your job!
@leahmcelrath We should always make sure we are working to make people feel at ease..and thank you for the post. There’s enough pain in the world without malevolence. But what do you mean “we all are living with it”?
@cnnbrk This is so stupid:
@rep_stevewomack Stop using the word white supremacy. As if the president, like him or not, of this country would be a racist. Your sick.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Not put a dork like you in jail for being a moron.
@TomSteyer So just like the Soviet Union, ultra rich bastards like you will villanize the hard working class of people who earned a start, and you’ll use the poor trying to convince them to support your ideology. Tom, go to hell. Seen this before in the 21st century. Your not wanted.
@JoyceWhiteVance @StormResist Why should anyone be forced to respond the the NYT, or any other media outlet?
@knittinglinda @LMAO_in_Fla @StormResist @debbiesideris @beccas1434 @ListenToEzra @MatthewWolfff @TrinityResists @MadelyneRants @Sky_Lee_1 @SnowBiAuthor Shout em down right.
@Need2Impeach @TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump China, Korea, Trade Deals...Now forcing congress to act at the border for the benefit of all. Well negotiated, so what are you talking about?
@LMAO_in_Fla @StormResist @debbiesideris @beccas1434 @ListenToEzra @MatthewWolfff @TrinityResists @MadelyneRants @Sky_Lee_1 @knittinglinda @SnowBiAuthor Morons tweet crap@like this.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @tedcruz Dork..I know your a teachers pet for Pelosi but pipe down already. Your like a nippy little dog.
@johnpodesta Representatives dip shits. Not leaders you ego driven morons..go to hell Tom.
@TheDemCoalition Oh really? Because dems have been so tempered. Shut up.
@TomSteyer Tom, your never going to win an office. Your a scummy Silicon Valley billionaire. Put your money where your mouth is rather than financing a lame ego driven campaign.
@funder @TheDemCoalition You can’t relate can you dork. You ever have a candid conversation or your just a rhetoric machine?
@funder @TheDemCoalition They will come for you dork. And I’ll laugh when they do. Wonder what’s on your computer.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork, he wasn’t talking to a small child..but anyway who the fuck cares?
@funder @TheDemCoalition I think your a dork. Dork.
@TomSteyer How the economy and market doing today Tom you clown.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork.
@GrootResists @StormResist The soloution is to force the states to do away with the winner take all electorate system. Each electorate should count. This fixes our election system and more accurately represents the voters.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@TomSteyer Shut it Tom.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump “That woman is a real bitch”
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork you Democrat stop your bitching
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Dork
@funder Dork...are you hoping to hold Pelosis hand?
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Dork
@TomSteyer The arrogance of you Silicon Valley son of bitches for one second try to blame anyone other than yourselves for stagnate products...when Jobs died apple stoped inovating. Just regurgitating. Your sick..and Tom, your one of them!
@roxdog54 @MikeLevinCA You don’t own it. It’s not yours. Do a good job governing as a representative and stay out of my business!
@funder @TheDemCoalition No dork, it’s only you saying stupid things, as usual. Dork.
@TomSteyer Tom, anyone using Climate like you as a platform for a political campaign is stupid. Just go home and smoke some weed, it will be better for all of us if you do!
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Dork, your actually the racist dog whistles think about what your twisted rhetoric evokes.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork.
@myserenity69 @StormResist Who asked you to and we all have differing interests.
@funder Dork.
@funder You are such a dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Please publish the policy your referring to Dork..
@TomSteyer Really? How much money are you invested in climate change economics...
@funder @realDonaldTrump Dork.
@TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump Hahahahah. Good one Tom. Real knee slapper. Bet your proud of yourself for that turd of a tweet.
@CBS8 @News8 Sounds about right.
@TomSteyer Tom, elaborate on your repetitive rehtoric about climate change. It’s getting old. We know, and none of you understand what to do. Your just trying to push political agendas with it so pipe down Tom!
@funder Dork
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition Maybe less blame and more accountability..
@funder Dork.
@funder That’s not what he’s saying. Your a pathetic dork.
@funder It’s twitter you angry little Democrat. Find a life dork.
@funder What’s in yours dork? Maybe it should be investigated. Bet there’s some in appropriate porn on there. Like mature with Pelosi look a likes, or maybe Schumer in your pathetic case.
@TomSteyer Your so clever Tom.
@CBS8 @News8 Good
@DemWrite @StormResist @LindseyGrahamSC Let’s just see what 2020 brings!
@funder DNC is next dork. No ones questioning that corruption. Look out teachers pet...you might go down with them, but that would make your day to hold Pelosis hand in a cell right dork?
@WayneGoodwinNC @funder Oh please..Bush 2 was right there don’t speak out of turn!
@MikeLevinCA Finally... the corrupt out of control EPA is being put in check. I wonder which lobbies losing their 80 mill! Thank god someone is finally cleaning up Washington!
@funder What golf course doesn’t dork.
@TomSteyer Nice try on the last C Tom you idiot.
@Nativeesoul Try living with wolfs.
@axidentaliberal @StormResist Duck face. The child was not incarcerated by the White House. He was detained by CBP. Liberal scum.
@funder I’m coming for you dork if the dems turn us to the streets. Your the problem here.
@BobMooreNews @BetoORourke And where should the child who’s parents just trucked here from one 3rd world country to the next, be? Who cares you asshole. Your the problem. At least CBP is actually trying to help these people! Fuck you.
@michaeldweiss Read up on some history and become more informed. Be part of the soloutions not the problem.
@ScottHech @StormResist @CBP Why the hell are you blaming CBP or government for these tragedies? You asshole. These poor people are imagtating from 3rd world countries and often their Heath reflects that. And you son of a bitch are presenting it as if CBP is at fault. You’ll get yours. Karma shit head.
@funder @realDonaldTrump As you try to be a bully. Thank god your too big of a dork for anyone to care.
@funder You too Dork.
@funder Shut up dork.
@HarleyRouda Congress made the laws, using this situation as political fodder! Shame on you! You know god damn good and well this stituation is accute and not some partisan agenda issue up for debate. Your deplorable.
@10News Why is this in the news cycle now?
@TheDemCoalition I don’t agree. Do I have a voice?
@morethanmySLE Hilarious dem would wish peace as they declare civil war.
@TheDemCoalition @GOP Impeach? For what? I don’t know impeachment was a political weapon.
@AdamSchiff @MikeLevinCA Who are the ethics lawyers and what’s there role in our government?
@funder @realDonaldTrump #resigndork
@MikeLevinCA Because the issues you congressmen discuss are really eleventh to begin with.
@TheDemCoalition What’s the law@congress has in place again...what does the law say about there things? Oh yes...comgresnis the problem and blaming the president is a cop out no mater who HE is.
@DemWrite @StormResist @realDonaldTrump @GOP Because I’ll be damned to watch you political hacks try to use the economy as political fodder. Fuck off.
@wesley_jordan @StormResist Becuse prior to Trump we were in such good shape. Who’s got the matches?
@funder How many times you tweet in a day Dork?
@ProudResister @StormResist That’s right lefty. Suppress discussion and free speech. Tyrants.
@StormResist From  Who?
@funder @realDonaldTrump Dork.
@jerryjamesstone @funder @DevinNunes Move on dems. Dork.
@funder Does twitter ever block you Dork? For being such a tool.
@funder Wannabe tyrant aren’t we? Dork.
@funder No dork your wrong. And your a political hack and a whiner. Your partisan politics have no place here. Dork. Go away.
@TomSteyer And? To be expected Tom. Geo politics of the century should not be fodder for your chicken little campaign.
@Need2Impeach @TomSteyer @realDonaldTrump What a joke. I was/sensord by twitter for using the “b” word to describe a political hack.
@funder And you should be sent to prison where you belong since your such a bitch. Dork.
@funder Yaaaa Dork. All American hero!
@funder Bottom of what dork?
@funder Chicken little aren’t we dork?
@funder Hey dork, what would you do if not for Trump? Maybe just get coffee for Pelosi you angry little pathetic man.
@funder Dork
@TheDemCoalition Your all liars
@funder As an American, the president should finish his term and Hillary and the DNC should be investigated for its own corruption.
@funder @realDonaldTrump Dork, could not have said it better. You planning on shutting the fuck up soon?
@funder No dork. Your the sick, pathetic, little joke of a man. No wonder your so angry. Should wash your mouth out with soap.
@TheDemCoalition Then don’t watch the news liberal. Teach the kid about free speech and stop being so slanted.
@funder Yep. No mercy. Your days coming dork.
@TheDemCoalition @GOP You know who else is guilty of spreading false information? C,mon guys ;)
@funder @realDonaldTrump Dork, it’s not the presidents job to arbitrate these issues. You making dramatic comparisons to make it seem like he is. Treasonous little dork.
@funder You lie dork.
@TomSteyer We can do better than the likes of you too Tom, we don’t need a chicken little anywhere near the office either liberal slime
@MikeLevinCA Hoping it doesn’t fail aren’t we.
@DemWrite @realDonaldTrump Dramatic.
@Comey Your such a hack.
@TomSteyer You’d like that wouldn’t you Tom you billionaire. Of course this has nothing to do with fed interest rates been held artificially low for 8 years prior. Wink, wink.
@BarackObama @TheDemCoalition Insurance peddling salesman! Classy. He’s hoping it doesn’t fail because his names on it. Let’s see what happens!
@TomSteyer The law should not be a politicized weapon. Your guilty as hell Tom and should be on charged with treason Lomg with the rest of em!
@TomSteyer Hey Tom, what percentage of carbon emissions come from cars? Bet you don’t know the answer!
@TomSteyer Give it up Tom. Impeachment is not your personal tool for political gain. If he’s not charged then you should retreat with your tail between your legs and never be seen again!
@TheDemCoalition Responsible reporting. Not! No wonder media has lost all credibility with the general public!
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer It would be awesome if the 90% of us that agre on that made 2020 about reforming congress instead of playing into the systematic corruption.
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer If I could accomplish anything on Twitter it would be connecting with everyone who feels like me, we should force congress to fix the problem. That the problem is congress and it can be fixed. They spend all their time on raising money for elections, not working on our behalf!
@TheDemCoalition @IvankaTrump Why your at it let’s take a look at the last administrations bills for security and then at all the security costs in Washington DC and see how it compares!
@TomSteyer Because imepachemnt is not a tool to be used like this..
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer The electrical collage is not new, and it works! If the electoral collage had gone the other way the sediment would be reversed. It’s was created for a reason and effectively levels the votes between the people. Jerry meandering is a problem however.
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer Historically, the mid terms are far worse for the incoming party at the presidential election so the house is no surprise nor indicative of anything about how we feel.
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer I’m no defender of Trump. But he’s doing his job per the constitution, and The man lacks class and is not my choice for president. But the likes of Tom and the propaganda campaigns of the left are far worse than the class trump lacks. Lies and propaganda.
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition What if congress would get off its ass and stop raising money for a second to get immigration reform done so legal immigration is possible for those who want to be here. And we can work together...?
@eyesope02333360 @TomSteyer It’s not me vs. you. I think balance between left and right is healthy and it should shift back and fourth. But 100% of our elected officials time and effort is spent to satisfy Funder a and work to get re elected (money) rather than what’s important to all of us.
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer I’m not defending trump. The problem is the system, it’s corrupt at the institutional level, not the personal level. I wish we had a better choice of cantidates and that we focused on reforms to congress, not hating the person in office. Blame goes nowhere!
@baumga2010 @TomSteyer There is nothing wrong with taking care of people if socialism stoped there. Personally I don’t want the government to tell me how to feel, how to live. I have no problem making sure people are taken care of, but history has run the experiment and balance is required.
@Sky_Lee_1 @StormResist @TrinityResists @KassandraSeven @Prometheus_2018 @Katpa73 @American_Blonde @electroboyusa @ellievan65 @KidCasteel @axidentaliberal Ya. The gloves should come off. This is not democracy. We should fight back against tyrant left wing assholes who have hijacked the country.
@funder @realDonaldTrump As if you have any power dork. Simmer down and mind your business.
@TomSteyer What the hell do you know about it Tom?
@funder You’ll get yours. Your party will burn for your assault on freedom and democracy. The people will hold you accountable.
@TomSteyer How did you make your money to sit in your high horse Tom?
@funder @realDonaldTrump Or maybe you’ll share one with Clinton. I hope your held accountable for your divisive propaganda you angry little dork.
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump So...151 world leaders fly 151 jet airliners to Paris to tell the rest of us to use less fuel. And transportation and power only account for 15% of the carbon emissions? Why should we listen to anyone about Paris again?
@TomSteyer Then what’s the soloutions Tom?
@funder @realDonaldTrump I hope your sued for slander dork.
@funder You arrogant pompous idiot. Hold the Saudi price accountable as if we are the world police? Moron. Dork. #notblackandwhite.
@TomSteyer This is a representative democracy Tom. The people did speak when we elected Trump. The only ones who fear democracy are the socialist like you trying to turn the poor against the rich, and use race to exact your agenda. You’ll be exposed in due course when your ideology rejected
@funder Cry baby. Dork.
@TheDemCoalition @ChrisCoons Who’s fault is it?
@TomSteyer Americans are also realizing the Democratic Party will stop at nothing for power and should be kept far from office. Just take notes about what’s happening in Paris socialist and keep up your antics.
@funder @SpeakerRyan Dork. You should run for office.
@funder @OrrinHatch As you send a snarky goodbye message. Dork.
@funder That’s true yuh dumb fuck. Although maybe not in your case dork. Most women would probably kick the shit out of you if you tried to get physical.
@TomSteyer Pandering to the poor? Trying to rally them against the rich for political gain? Tom...this has been done throughout history, recently, with disterous results!
@TomSteyer Tom, your a socialist.
@funder Dork.
@funder No dork. This is devastating to you, and your corrupt agenda. No collusion.
@TomSteyer American law and justice is a system with no regard for the individual. It’s used corruptly just in this way by those few people with the ability to control it to excact corrupt agendas. Go to hell Tom, the American people have no respect for you. Go to hell bureaucrat.
@SenFeinstein @StormResist And how about the domestic interference from partisan actors?
@TomSteyer And how Tom, in your wisdom did we get here since all the other administrations and congresses did such a good job? So what your saying is this all new the last two years? Are you smoking too much weed? Tom?
@TomSteyer Tom, you of all people should know bankruptcy protection is a good thing. And in two years, from the word go the insurmountable political pressure and rhetoric from you and the other sore losers isn’t helping move us forward. Get off it already dick!
@TheDemCoalition @amazon Hopefully they are all fired. When groups of people get together for unionization it’s pretty tribal, not like unions have the big picture in mind. Can’t blame people for pushing for fairness but are unions today fair?
@SarahBCalif What!
@funder Don’t forget the electoral collage protects us from tools like you. The people voted and now your wasting our time and resources on petty bullshit. It will come back around dork.
@funder Oh my god you little dork watch your mouth! Pelosi will wash it with soap you dirty little kiss ass!
@funder Dork...did you seriously just cite the national enquirer and evidence in the same paragraph? Your such a dork.
@funder I like the part you added at the end dork.
@foxycuda @adamfederman @MotherJones Who cares? Enviornmental is make a ton of inaccurate dramatic claim@s that turn out to be false and counter productive to the end goal of coexisting with our environment.
@JonNegroni My GOP consultant....Sorry who? Well my donkey consultant told me that Democratic Party is full of liberal jackasses...what’s your point dork?
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump How much does the Democratic Party Cost the American people? Hmm...
@ProudResister @realDonaldTrump What did you defeat? There’s a historical precedent for party majority at the mid terms. This falls right in line. Speak up again in 2020.
@funder Dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @ndrew_lawrence Dork. Stop accusing people of being racist and bigots. Instead let’s address the issues that systematically impose unfair tyranny on all of us. What your doing by crying wolf is discrediting the issue of discrimination, not helping solve the problem.
@AdamParkhomenko There what is? You hire a lawyer to know what to do. He fucks up...and gets what he deserved. So what? Do there what is? A crooked lawyer? Welcome to our system. Fuck em...
@funder @TheDemCoalition Hey dork...shut it. Now you got served!
@funder Gleeful fool. What special type of moron takes pleasure in seeing our system of government degenerate to partisan investigations wasting our time and resources. Pathetic. Dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork
@TomSteyer Tom, I hope your never elected into any office anywhere. Your fear mongering and egotistical arrogant rhetoric regarding impeachment is not a tool for your attempt at political game. Your pretty lame man. Go home. You hurting the process of government as an armature.
@funder You realize dork that this is fake news? Your doing a disservice to the media and “journalism”. Even know your only a lame wannabe. But you don’t care...do you dork.
@funder @tribelaw @realDonaldTrump Hopefully we can find a reason to indite and prosecute you dork.
Someone please explain why there is no media coverage of Paris?
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump And....what’s Muller said so far about Russian Collusion?
@funder Is that what he said dork?
@funder Do they Dork? Do they.
RT @KestrelArts: @TomSteyer Yeah people said that 12 years ago, too.  We keep passing these goal lines and instead of changing you guys jus…
@TomSteyer Then why do you seem to be on one side Tom?
@funder @realDonaldTrump Why are you so angry dork?
@funder Dork.
@DemWrite @StormResist Because Democrats have been so worried about America. Only there votes...corruption is going to see riots at the gates of Washington if this continues.
@MatthewWolfff @TheLoyalO @ybbkaren @TheSWPrincess @1Jedi_Rey @JynErso_2017 @NatCookResists @Augustus709 @Clara_Resists @ScarletAvengers @BatmanResist Government should be about the issues, not the person. Let’s hear from DOJ before we start throwing around biased unqualified legal opinions, because this sort of propaganda is divisive for pure political fodder and hurts the integrity of our system of government.
@grantstern @TheDemCoalition Is that what Mullers report says and Trump is being indicted or just your subjective partisan concussion of formalities resulting from the fraudulent investigation?
@funder @realDonaldTrump You look and sound like a pedafile, stop spreading disingenuous propaganda and turn yourself in!
@funder Dork.
@TheDemCoalition @matthewjdowd Move on obstructors.
@funder We have mass shootings and dems use the soap box for politics. Put s cork in it dork!
@TomSteyer Tom, Trump will be a two term president. Are you going to whine like a pouty child the whole time?
@funder @WayneGoodwinNC No. Go away dork.
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition That’s easy...he knows more than you, closer to the situation than you, and as a credible smart man working in political theater knows what he’s doing. Just like you spreading your propaganda bullshit!
@HawkeyeResists @StormResist @BostonGlobe Then stop the partisan politics and focus on collective soloutions for a start...
@betsyffj Dork alert.
@MatthewWolfff @TheLoyalO @ybbkaren @TheSWPrincess @1Jedi_Rey @JynErso_2017 @NatCookResists @Augustus709 @Clara_Resists @ScarletAvengers @BatmanResist How are sentencing memos for Cohen an indictment? I’m indifferent to Trump, but what I don’t want to see is populist government fueled by sheep influenced by propaganda campaigns. So respectfully, those are strong words with no evidence, only subjective conclusions on your part.
@TomSteyer Tom, anything to contribute or just arm chair quarterbacking it as a wannabe contender for office?
@TomSteyer Tom, what would you do without Trump?
@olgaNYC1211 @StormResist So what’s your proposal as an expert in global politics and history in the region? I assume your experienced  in geopolitics and not just spreading dangerous misinformation...hmmmm.
@funder @TheDemCoalition Dork.
@TeamPelosi @StormResist Hmmm. How was Pelosi financed? Corrupt much? Hypocrites.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Hey dork...who should be the attorney general?
@TheDemCoalition Really? Let’s revisit this statement to see how credible you are.
@funder @Comey @Anygirl99 You are such a dork.
@TheDemCoalition 2 years. What’s the result? Stop wasting my tax money on your politics. I reject your leftist ideology. What are you going to do about it?
@TomSteyer Tom, are you really blaming the Republican Party for climate change and inaction? Maybe we should stop playing group identity politics and blaming others. We need less blame and more Soloutions. And your definatly not going to represent me at the table coward.
@BkPhilanthropy @StormResist Presumptuous on my part for sure I’m sorry I should have read your post more carefully before responding. How can I help? What can we really do to protect OUR children in this nation I’ve herd nothing but rhetoric and it’s not helping nor is violence a legislative issue.
@funder Dork.
@1DentalHyGenius @BkPhilanthropy @StormResist What does that even mean? You dare to tweet?
@MatthewWolfff Well done! Good honest perspective of the historical aspect of the man as president..thank you.
@TheDemCoalition Not your job scum
@johnshaw310 @AryaResists @StormResist @GOP Your right. I’m wrong...my bad. I remember now how stupid the actions of the GOP were during that time. There is nothing worse than that sort of behavior from our elected officials doing their job! Fire all of them left and right and let’s start over...
@ForOurFutureWI @TheDemCoalition And democrats haven hijacked our country acting like sore losers?
@sahilkapur @StormResist Pelosi has been responsible for not taking action imagratiin with the rest of congress. They are to blame, her specifically, not any of the current or previous administrations. Her more than anyone with her leadership in congress could fix this but she’s a dinosaurAccountability.
@funder How about our economy and the jobs at those locations for forgotten Americans? We can work together for a better future but your no expert in what to do about climate change and the consequences of populist action. Action yes but less political. In the mean time....
@Brasilmagic @funder Childish
@funder @realDonaldTrump Or not dork. Let’s see.
@ProudResister @funder @realDonaldTrump Let’s see what it all means when it comes out
@woodhouseb @TheDemCoalition Ask Bernie about the Democratic Party cheating.
@Rob_Flaherty @TheDemCoalition Classy.
@myserenity69 Is it a good think to hope for your government to be in this sort of turmoil instead of focused on policy and legislation?
@BkPhilanthropy @StormResist How dare you suggest politics causes or could prevent hate and mass shootings. Not without the government telling us how to think and act. The propaganda campaign by the left is far more dangerous than policies and more effective in propagating hate. Check it!
@funder I demand you resign from Twitter dork.
@peterwallsten @govtrack Recruiting leftist foot soldiers are we?
@funder @realDonaldTrump Could the man do anything he’s not attached for? People like you dork are so bad for our nation. Your a thorn in our shoe.
@ida_skibenes She’s been a real bowl of peaches. Like she’s been real friendly to the American people. And this is not news!
@TheDemCoalition Because all the previous presidents were able to balance the books?
@funder Really dork...so is it not true that the climate is changing both for natural and human caused reasons? Your an idiot. Politicians should leave it to the next experts and your not even a politician #hack.
@TomSteyer You should stick to software and leave climate to the scientist and experts. This is not a partisan political issue, please mind your business Tom.
@benwikler Good.
@funder @TheDemCoalition So dems set up Flynn?
@TomSteyer Tom...someday I hope you eat your words...your rhetoric is disgusting and unwanted.
@TheDemCoalition Finally...that sounds like you wanted it?
@funder Your disgusting dork. Let’s hear more from Muller and much less from you.
@BroMark13 @Mean_Adam The divisive rhetoric from the left is coming from groups of people with strong ideology about how the world should work and they are spreading it everywhere. Using celebrities and slanted propaganda to blast out media in all outlets is effectively setting a dangerous tone...
@funder Who has a face like yours and kisses democratic ass? Dork.
@TomSteyer That’s president Trump Tom you wannabe.
@funder You and Hillary should get locked up together the. You’ll be happy right dork?
@funder Who cares dork
@funder @HillaryClinton Stuck up bitch. Real good example.
@DemitriDawson @TheDemCoalition @JeffreyToobin @realDonaldTrump ?
@mmpadellan Moron. I’d think the secret service are good at their job.
@Mean_Adam Then someone stop the divisive rhetoric from the left!
@funder @MichelleObama Will you kiss ass just like you did for tyrant Pelosi? Dork you teachers pet...
@TheDemCoalition @GOP Unions are. It good by default and they raise consumer prices for all of us.
@CyrusToulabi I wouldn’t talk to corrupt senators seeking political gain either. Everything to lose for one mistake...
@funder Hey dork...how many of those deals went through and is it illegal for Americans to have any business with Russia? Shouldn’t we work to avoid a Cold War and maintain ally’s in the world even if we don’t agree with them? Oh wait, your just a partisan hack spewing propaganda vomit
@funder @realDonaldTrump I don’t agree..obstructionists.
@NormEisen So Hillary is going to jail?
@moscow_project And.....
@AryaResists We will see.
@funder Classy dork.
@Augustus709 Wonder if that’s 400 Democrats? And who’s speaking for these 400 people where’s the patition with their names for validity? Or are we living in a world of anonymous statements with no verification and false conclusions?
@AryaResists @StormResist @GOP Hey obstructionist....how many times has the government been shut down in recent memory and by whom?
@jimsciutto You would take the 5th to in this tyrannical system. Your ass is on the line for one miss step. Better not to say a word in this which hunt or you’ll be burned at the stake.
@TheDemCoalition Great translation. Hope all of you putting out this negligent propaganda are held accountable later.
@TheDemCoalition Classy..and so accurate. Maybe instead of producing dramatic propaganda for the left we could focus on fixing the broken policies enacted by Congress? Maybe? Or no it’s all about the partisan politics.
@funder Will you please provide some evidence of your claim dork. Maybe the part of the constitution that this violates and some real expert expiration from a non bias credible institution? Probably not right dork?
@HarryPotterMAGE @StormResist Tyrant. Maybe?
@funder Surely your providing unbiased interviews and seeking truth over spin right dork?
@TomSteyer Tom, save the planet? With your partisan politics and heroic legislation? Do you see how stupid this sounds?
@funder @realDonaldTrump Your next dork.
@funder @TheDemCoalition @jdawsey1 Hey dork you would love that right? Make you feel important? There’s a hillarious irnony that in theory Trump would be the best thing for your career...I’m laughing my ass off. That’s funny!
@BeSeriousUSA I got one for the loser Democratic Party that’s for sure..
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump What about the rest of Washington asshole? Do you teach your kids how to be hypocrites also?
@funder @TheDemCoalition Hey dork, why do we not want to work with a global community? Nothing being said has been falsified. Your spin is disgusting..
@TomSteyer Hey Tom, lawyers on both sides of the isle on every recount spend all of their time working to discredit and disqualify votes in favor of their party. Yet your parading around as if this is a GOP issue, no one more corrupt than the populist democratic ideology driven politicians.
@funder You are intolerable suggesting something like that. The gloves should come off for dorks like you dividing this country with absurdity like that! It’s on Dork!
@10News Congress. Our hero :)
@B52Malmet @StormResist @CJPatruno @TheSWPrincess @MatthewWolfff @ListenToEzra @DanaScottLO @SpockResists @DMansini @exoticgamora @debbiesideris Hahaha. Your funny.
@SenBennetCO @TheDemCoalition Then why has congress failed to act for so long!!
@joerogan Damit Joe good call...fuckers.
@speechboy71 @StormResist Nobody cares about the gross propaganda campaign being used by Dems to obstruct and undermine our nation for political gain. Americans have rejected your policies and now your using media and populism to impose tyrannical rule..but we will fight you! Fuck off blue.
@SelfImposedXile @TheDemCoalition Congressmen lie everyday. The truth will prevail
@axidentaliberal I mean his name is Flake!
@speechboy71 @StormResist Um....Hillary should have been prosecuted...hopefully still will!
@AnnTelnaes @TheDemCoalition No..everyone who can read or watch TV had a crystal clear understanding of Trump and his global organization. This type of spin (aka fake news) is what the rest of us bipartisan folks are sick and tired of. You don’t have to like the person. Your hurting America!
@DeWayne_Fulton You lefties are hilarious...
@funder You lie everyday. Twist facts and spread misinformation as all political hacks do...maybe you should be indicted!
@TomSteyer Impeachment is not a political weapon!
@funder Because lobbiest aren’t the most credible source of corruption in our system...naa..
@jkbjournalist @TheDemCoalition Partisan?
@funder @TheDemCoalition Hey dork why is this tweet worthy? Oh that’s right your spreading propaganda with clips completely out of context.  Your undermining our democracy and weakening our system of government. Keep up the good work dork!
@TomSteyer Impeachment is not a political weapon Tom. What’s going to happen when a president actually does need to be impeached now that people like you have dicscrased  the process!
@funder What’s clear is that once Muller briefs the public we will see the truth. Let’s see what happens Dork....if this is all byproduct typical of this type of investigation will you admit your a propaganda whore?
@funder Which is how it should be Dorkin. As if the Dem party is somehow doing things any differently..your rhetoric is disgusting.
@TomSteyer Tom are you helping ICE do their job by vomiting out a sliver of a complex issue with your virtue signaling?
@StormResist Well blue my name is kettle.
@mtaibbi @TheDemCoalition Isn’t that exactly the problem when you start with censorship? The line is blurred and now you have free speech issues. Let’s not go down this path any further and stop infringing on anyone’s free speach because this experiment has been run many times before with bad results.
@TomSteyer Tom are you seriously accusing someone else of the blame game?
@TomSteyer Keep trying Tom. I’ll work hard to make sure a silicon political hack like you never gets near the office. Your tirades on imepeahcment are bad for the country, like a spoiled child throwing a tantrum.
@TomSteyer Tom your using the Sam crisis for your political gain....
@funder Start spewing rhetoric like yours and the rest of the dem party:
@DemitriDawson @TheDemCoalition @realDonaldTrump Tweet after the investigation is concluded and justify the waste of tax dollars.
@TomSteyer Tom....you know damn well that these sort of indictments are a typical byproduct of an investigation like this..these indictments don’t mean a thing about the mission statement of the investigation yet your vomiting propaganda, seeding division in our nation.
@TheDemCoalition Hearsay...but even if true that’s because Congress made the law that prosecuted people the executive constitutional job is to enforce the laws as congress intended. So by giving an order to follow the law and putting congress feet to the fire is what every president should have d
@Leahgreenb @TheDemCoalition @Ocasio2018 Ignorant statement.
@funder What a stupid thing to say.
@AryaResists @StormResist @Augustus709 @Boba_Tea_Catan @PantherResists @ShuriResists @Prometheus_2018 @CaptainResists @Clara_Resists @R2D2Resists @ybbkaren @HitGirlResists Let’s use Hollywood super hero’s, all who come from violent movies, to sell democratic propaganda just like Big tobacco selling cigarets to kids  with cartoon characters..WTF.
@axidentaliberal @StormResist @realDonaldTrump Who doesn’t agree families belong together, oh unless your using the plight of immigrants to further your political agenda. And no one disputes science. The dispute is how your presenting the conclusions and what your wrongly insinuating others are saying about it.  Action?
@TrisResists @StormResist @CJPatruno @lfkraus @B52Malmet @ProudResister @KidCasteel @debbiesideris @Lady_Star_Gem @LunaLuvgood2017 @MatthewWolfff Why is this news again?
@TheDemCoalition @SenBobCorker And your governing model? Whatever that even means.
@SenWhitehouse @StormResist @realDonaldTrump @US_OSC Obstructionist.
@GaladrielResist @StormResist What’s with all the disinformation from fake twitter accounts? Is anyone looking into the hobbit characters spreading propaganda? Sick.
@letscispeak Climate change is Human caused. And naturally occuring. Something killed the dinosaurs
@nytimes What action?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump What action lady?
@TheDemCoalition No interminable person is denying climate is changing. And most of the time people are being accused of denying climate change when in fact they are not. They are just questioning the political motives for using climate change.
@funder You are a disgusting, weak, and vile individual spreading divisive FAKE NEWS. Please stop...find some truth and a better cause that’s good.
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition And where would you rather live and what metric?
@MadelyneRants @StormResist @HuffPostPol Oh you mean when the rampant corruption (#berrnisanders) was exposed to the world and the true colors of the party were on display?
@realDonaldTrump Tort Reform Mr. President.
@MikeLevinCA @realDonaldTrump Shat will solve the problem?
@LauraRoslin2017 @StormResist Really? Blame? Is that what we should do is look for Blame!!!how about look at each area of interest and problem solve. Politics are not the cause nor the answer. Moron.
@funder Yes Dork. It does. You can be certain that your word vomit will work to ensure your ideology is rejected. You seem like a vile, teachers pet of a wannabe political player...
@TomSteyer Tom, great ideas. I have a question about the living wage..how does your living wage act inversely on the cost of living and how does hyperinflation come into play as the two interact.
@funder Unlike you and the rest of the left he’s not interested in wasting our time and resources. Take note.
@TomSteyer And not become disfunctional via obstructionist with political agendas Tom
@wvjoe911 @StormResist Ok..that is funny.
@LarryLSandigo @StormResist Then look@at@congrss and ask why the fuck they are failing to fix this...it’s in part because of what your going right here to suggest somehow the Executive made these shitty laws and procedures...no. Congress has failed us and politics are blaming others!
@MotherJones @StormResist You just can’t lose gracefully
@funder Your a dork...sort of the teachers pet here.
@TrisResists Well relax because no one in California has ever looked at DC for their input of wildfires. Only now the mob is now seizing on the messaging...of stupid people..who cares...this says nothing. Presidents are just people, all of them!
@TomSteyer @GovernorVA Your a vile individual. You use race as a political tool, you have no respect for the communities your using to spray your fowl messaging...you’ll be exposed for what you are. Silicon Valley Politician and Hack....
@Comey @TheDemCoalition You being fired was the best thing the President has done so far...your obviously way to politicaly motivated and narcissistic than we would want in the director of the FBI. Your true colors are on display and I hope your rejected as a politician.
@funder Thugs huh...this is democracy?
@funder Your treasones propaganda will be documented with each tweet.  We must do more to sow unity than division.
@LukeBrussel Why does the left continue to sow conspircy theory throughout the government, undermining our democracy..
@AynRandPaulRyan There are no queens or kings in our democracy fools...
@axidentaliberal @realDonaldTrump While we’re at it, let’s look at all the big government easy and excess and start assigning accountability.
@StormResist @NancyPelosi This is dangerous...
@TomSteyer What killed the dinosaurs Tom?
@exoticgamora @TrinityResists @DearAuntCrabby @B52Malmet @StormResist @CaptainsLogAz @BatmanResist @Cruellaisdevine @jacksnowknows @TrisResists @meg_Y12 Please be wise and stop making it about the people...stick to the issues there is good And bad on both sides of the isle...balance between strength and compassion.
@MattCHouston @StormResist @Dewitt4Congress You probably don’t want to work there anyway. Funny how it becomes a political soap box opportunity...
@MattCHouston @StormResist @Dewitt4Congress Love to know the details but if your employer is that stupid then....
@cnnbrk Karma
@BuffytVSSummers @StormResist Please, when you vote understand what your voting for. Don’t use your celebrity to reinforce populism. Vote on the issues, not the people. There’s good people on both sides of the isle, and bad.
@MichaelAvenatti You got arrested....for domestic violence...!
@TomSteyer @Ocasio2018 What action? The climate is changing for natural reasons as it always has, and it’s changing because of man..so what would you have us do?
@TheDemCoalition @FoxNews Was is weponized or is Acosta a jerk?
@DavidPriess He’s pretty popular. So.....
@TomSteyer Divisive.
@funder I bet that’s what your herd
@funder The EPS is froughtnworh corruption..fool.
@TomSteyer Sounds familiure Tom..all you seem to do is blame. Hypocrite.
@funder Ok. I agree. That’s bad...
@espyforsenate @TheDemCoalition Wrong party then pal...the left does nothing but divide. You don’t think for me lefties.
@funder Bang...go away lefties
@TheDemCoalition @Acosta Acosta is a dork. Nothing but a talking head personality furthering his career at the cost of tax payers now. Fuck off.
@NathanLerner @TheDemCoalition How much has Mullers probe spent? And how about liberal big government policies?
@TrisResists Republican?
@TomSteyer Go to hell your politizing it just like him. I’m on the front line and his comments are the last of our concern hypocrite. Seize every political propaganda moment you can and your just like him, just a different side.
@funder @realDonaldTrump You and your people are doing irreparable damage to our nation and their will be blood on your hands if things get worse: your selfish campaign of misinformation and bias is tearing at the fabric of our country and your trying to place blame on “the other side”..responsibility!
@funder How about we work together on this country instead of crying wolf. Your not helping.
@MikeLevinCA To make it black and white. I don’t hear many people take a side, the question is what to do about the changing environment and it’s not an easy answer to be left to politicians...so again...what’s your point? The president has common sense about the issue?
@MikeLevinCA I have a question. I’ve been fighting fires on the front line for the majority of my Life in Southern California, currently on the Wolsey Fire. The climate is changing naturally, and because of man...so what’s the argument all about? It’s not black and white, but you keep trying
@TomSteyer Dude..your hurting our country with your ego...let the government work and earn the trust of the people as a representative. Stop inciting hysteria with your calls to set us back years while you pursue your agenda. I hope your defeated...enough already...
@TomSteyer No we are not.
@TheDemCoalition @SarahHuckabee @jimmykimmel Acosta? Reputable character? Maybe as an entertainer. Come on!
@funder Then turn your self in you fear mongering traitor.
@funder Can’t legislate. Investigate. This is what we, the American people really want from our government. Two sides playing games with our lives!
@TomSteyer Your a fear mongering politician just as guilty of anything your alleging.
@TomSteyer You offer no evidence to back your claims and your comments are inciting rage and hate. Explain yourself billionaire!
@funder Can’t legislate...so investigate.
@arb @TomSteyer @Need2Impeach Because impeachment is such a good strategy for our country. Go home fools, do constructive good.
@KSoltisAnderson @TomSteyer Poles are useless, why cite them?
@funder Will you lose gracefully or cry foul? I’m betting you’ll cry foul.
@GOVERNING @StormResist Thank you. I am a  conservative, republican by default. But this women should have been undeniably fired, not thrusted into the lime@light as some sort of hero. Keep religion out of government!
@BetoORourke I hate Ted Cruz...what will you say when he kicks your ass to the curb with all the hoopla?
@TeamPelosi We will Nancy. To make sure you and your cronies are evicted, finally, from government. It’s a bad day for Democrats despite all your money and propaganda.
@funder @RepDeSantis You should not use race to prop up your political agenda.
@skesseks @funder Real crafty come back. Let’s mitigate the issue like adults and find out the truth...
@TomSteyer No offense, but your face and talking points are offensive to me. I’m triggered. Where’s my protection liberal?
@KaivanShroff @StormResist Then maybe, your full of shit!
@funder 0
@ketchspeak @StormResist Well done. And surely you explained the issues to her and told her how dangerous it is to care more about the people than the issues!
@funder Must have been a GOP conspiracy.
@PreetBharara Surprise.
@TheDailyShow @ComedyCentral Your insighting hate funny man. You leftist comedians get so political then hide behind your persona as comedians. Stand up and engage in intelligent debate if your going to speak out politically. Cheater!
@funder Who cares about fox.
@funder Idiot.
@funder Crying Wolf again. Cowards.
@AryaResists @StormResist @pru_fallows @bobosmom1 @B52Malmet @TheSWPrincess @MrScottLads @TrisResists @Archimedes2020 @Rey_Sistance @RogueTeamXmen @AmaClete You don’t speak for me.
@RepSwalwell @StormResist @GOP Scum. Oh the poles must be suppressed, it’s not that people actually  reject your socialist ideology.
@Augustus709 @StormResist Or...American people see through the bought and paid for media machines...and the vote reflects overwhelming rejection of your PC socialist agenda.
@funder You lose..:now admit defeat.
@funder @Beyonce Because celebrity lsnknow better than the rest of us. And we should vote for someone before the celebrity said we should. Go home losers.
@funder Go ahead, keep crying wolf. Learn how to lose like a good sport.
@kylegriffin1 @StormResist That’s right, keep trying to use celebrity’s to sell your socialist agenda. See where this gets you with hard working normal people.
RT @InSightCrime_es: Los dolores de cabeza de Jimmy Morales no se acaban, ahora si viceministro de gobernación está acusado de ejecuciones…
@TomSteyer Your left wing socialist ideology will be defeated at the poles tomorrow. And I hope you will accept your defeat and retreat to your life as a billionaire instead of continuing to foster hate and rage among ordinary people.
discussion can be enlightening, learn from each other even in disagreement. But if we can’t see past the rhetoric we are all fucked! Uncomfortable is required as courage to make change and be part of movement, even as futile it may seem, starts in forums like this.
That’s just what inspired me to become so interested in Politics, and debate, discussion. Seems people are so focused on the Person that the reality of what we wake up to day in and day out is so surreal that it’s almost unbelievable. The worst thing we can do is ignore it.....
Do the Democrats have any credibility? Every time I see a vote blue tweet or add it rings as bullshit! When the results of November 6th are in and truth is exposed do the dems ever recover their standing with us..the voters? I don’t think so put a fork in your party November 7th
@funder How about tweet the details and stop being so dramatic. As if you and the donkeys aren’t engaged in political propaganda...it’s so bad man!
@chelseaperetti @StormResist Your sick. Voting has 0 to do with schools shootings and violence. The victims of any such tragedy you people try to use as political fodder should share their pain with you for being so inconsiderate. Bastards!
@TomSteyer @CaliforniaLabor @OCLF Unions are corrupt orginzations that buy wannabe politicians like you and infringe on our freedom to drive the cost of good and infrastructure so high non of us can afford them.then we pay the pensions of the tyrant organizers sabotaging our futureOf course they support socialist
@funder Since the day the democrats lost it’s been a top headline...Hmmmmm? Wonder why....
@billmaher @FLIPCA50 Ya, like maybe what you and the rest of the leftist are producing today orders of magnitude worse....you’ve  invaded our media and academic culture. We are not as gullible as you’d like funny man!
@funder Clinton?
@TomSteyer Your party has been hijacked by the radical left intimidation being used by the Democrat political machine will all be exposed when your party is crushed on the 6th by the voice of the American people. We will not tolerate your tyranny!
@funder @SpeakerRyan Classy...sounds like POTUS. Hypocrite!
@funder Dork
@joncoopertweets The voters have spoken. You will not speak for us or dictate what we can or can not do. Regroup and silence your radical policies and come back to the table in 2020. Your all fired and the voters will let you know in 6 days!
@joncoopertweets Democrats are sinister well funded propaganda machines There is no confidence let alone overconfidence and you know it Polls bought and paid for by Blue of course are misleading Hurdles are the American people seeing through your BS When you lose it’s Russia &amp; voter suppression!
@TheDemCoalition Disagree. Trump is following the law of the constitution keeping you socialist in check.
@funder What’s on the ballot for healthcare? Oh yea..Congress isn’t in session.
@TheDailyShow @ComedyCentral And when you, the media, Hollywood  inspire hate, glorify violence, should we be shocked? And you and hide from your responsibility and shuck accountability lurking behind your mask as comedians!!! Coward. Have a real discussion about real issues sometime and try to do some good!
@AC360 @TomSteyer We need CNN earn back our trust as a creible source of information. One billionaire calling another billionaire corrupt is not news worthy.
@funder No
@TomSteyer You and the people you represent are more dangerous. Your propaganda blame tactics are not welcomed in this democracy. You And all the people you speak for will be exposed for what you are-tyrants. Group identity politics will not prevail, not this time!
@funder And you and thebleft aren’t long spreading propaganda? Liar..
@funder Then following your tweets and the democratic campaign this Elle toon cycle, you and your party should be held accountable as enemies of the people..
@funder We will. To make sure the socialist left agenda fueling hatred with media campaigns capatlizing on individuals tragedy’s is exposed for what it is. Take a selfie and post it November 7th, 2018 so I can see the look on your faces...freedom.
@TheDemCoalition @FoxNews Whoever coined the tag line MAGAbomber should be exposed. We are not ignorant to the tactic, politics are poison.
@Augustus709 Your statement is false...political rhetoric. You should be ashamed. There’s far more radical left behavior, just turn on any media outlet no matter the obvious bias.
@funder That’s because of corruption so deep among the democratic convention it’s outright treason. Donkeys are using agencies like the FBI like henchmen...Obama violated more constitutional laws pushing the extre left agenda and no inditement?  That’s because of extreme left wing influ
