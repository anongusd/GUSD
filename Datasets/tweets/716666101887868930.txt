Things are scary in the world today. No one knows witch side is telling the truth. The funny thing about truth is there is always three sides to a story. Right side, left side and then the truth somewhere in the middle.
@PrmMvrPolitics @GOP I think both sides need to stop drawing lines down the middle and start listening to the people.

@cgtnamerica Three things will be accomplished here	1. War means money	2. Gives the public something else to look at besides what's in there own back yards 	3. U.S. will have to bring the draft back in order to fight all of these war.
@cgtnamerica Looks like we are going to war with Russia, Iran, and maybe even China. This seems like a rerun we all saw back in 2001 with Iraq. There must be some oil somewhere that someone is not sharing.
@BDNPolitics @bangordailynews @mikeshepherdME Does not really matter witch way she votes. They will get him in, even if the American people do not want it.
