CEO Marillyn Hewson: I'm encouraged by @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Administration‚Äôs efforts to reduce regulations; deliver pro-growth tax reform; advocate for American business around the world; and DoD leadership's drive to streamline bureaucracy #RNDF #RNDF2017 https://t.co/O9SVfRVE6V
We're an engine of innovation across the defense industry. That's the lifeblood‚Ä¶ to the smallest supplier. But if the buying behaviors are all about just getting to the lowest cost‚Ä¶ and don't reward for investment, then you're not going to get there. #RNDF #RNDF2017 https://t.co/IDr21vzvFp
CEO Marillyn Hewson on acquisition reform: it is a collective opportunity for us to work together; understanding priorities like readiness and modernization and aligning the acquisition system and incentives to achieve those priorities #RNDF #RNDF2017 https://t.co/wTkEtM6eLx
We always have this challenge of balancing cost vs. technical performance vs. speed to the warfighter; because of budget cuts @DeptofDefense has had to focus on lowest cost at the expense of innovation and investment that we need from a healthy defense industry #RNDF #RNDF2017 https://t.co/PHyfRuyk5j
CEO Marillyn Hewson on the impact of sequestration: As we look at the industry today, it is more fragile and less flexible than I‚Äôve seen it; The reason = budget cuts; @CSIS study shows 20% of small/medium sized businesses left the industry b/c of the environment #RNDF #RNDF2017 https://t.co/cU7rLGHoQY
