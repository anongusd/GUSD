In order to ensure America’s government reflects our values, each and every one of us must play a role in shaping it. So, here's a thing you can do right now. Go to https://t.co/RpM31V69t3 and commit to vote on Election Day. Let's take back this country. #BragAboutYourGeneration
The future is an act of creation. It’s easy look around at the world and assume it can’t be changed — that things just are the way they are, but guess what? Millennials, we have the power to make a difference our voice and our vote. #BragAboutYourGeneration
So rad that little girls in this country could live through the American experience of having fierce millennial women like @Ocasio2018, @IlhanMN, and @Abby4Iowa and as their reps in Congress. That's why we've gotta go hard over the next few months. #BragAboutYourGeneration
Millennials are getting out the vote and working to elect representatives who will fight for their values. We're 80 days out and heading into Election Day with some seriously dope candidates who are ready to fight like Hell to build a better future. #BragAboutYourGeneration
Millennials are ready to bring it on Election Day. You don't have to look very far to witness the energy of these badass changemakers who've taken to the streets in protest to demand an end to gun violence, equality for women &amp; the rights of LGBTQ people. #BragAboutYourGeneration
Oh yeah, and we're fighting to bring about real and meaningful change too. It's pretty tough to overstate the political power of young people in America. This year, millennials will pass boomers as the largest generation of eligible voters. #BragAboutYourGeneration
In spite of the soaring cost of college tuition — to the tune of about $1 trillion in student loan debt — millennials are on course to become the most educated generation our country's ever seen. By 2025 we will account for 75% of the global workplace. #BragAboutYourGeneration
Millennials are purpose-driven and go-getting. We're the most diverse generation in US history and huge drivers of economic growth. As pioneers for the future of tech, we used our brains and ambition to beat the economic recession we inherited. #BragAboutYourGeneration
