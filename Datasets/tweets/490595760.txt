@cmclymer I don’t think he should resign. He should apologize and move on. We all said and did dumb shit, but we do evolve. He’s fighting for women’s rights, so now @GOP has a problem with him. Republicans 🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾🖕🏾
@MeetThePress The irony of the republicans to report this. Unbelievable!! @RalphNortham @GovernorVA don’t resign!! Throw it right back at republicans.
@MSNBC If this is the only evidence of him in BF and he apologizes, what else can you ask a person to do? We all have did &amp; said thing offensive, but we do evolve. Pushing Dems out for offensive acts years ago is crazy. Remember @alfranken
@MSNBC The republicans wants VA Governor Dem Ralph Northam’s to resign bc he wants women to choose to have an abortion and not the government. But @GOP is ok with Steve King not resigning. @PPact @GovernorVA I would suggest, admit to it &amp; apologize.

@gregolear @erica1933 I blame @senatemajldr @SenateGOP for the continuation of this shutdown. Why are they hurting American Gov’t workers is mind boggling. @SenRickScott why aren’t you speaking up for your constituents who work 4 the Gov’t??
@yashar @NBCNews you can call it whatever, won’t change the fact that he is racist.
@AryaResists We all learn from out mistakes, and @alfranken who have apologized, deserves a 2nd chance. Believe Gillibrand made an effort to standup 4 🙍🏼‍♀️, but should have requested an investigation. #Dueprocess
@AyannaPressley @FSCDems 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 that’s how Gov is suppose to work. Thank you 💜🙇🏽‍♀️
@TheView for the last 2 years the Republicans failed to pass a bill when the Democrats gave them the 💰 for the wall. Rs voted no bc they don’t want a wall. Abby don’t blame Ds for the Rs incompetence.
@thehill OMFG!!!! This is sooooo unethical  on so many levels!!! Let me get this straight. He wants to use free labor #governmentworkers for offshore drilling so his friends and probably himself can make a profits. @GOP @marcorubio @MYHBeach where’s the outrage?
