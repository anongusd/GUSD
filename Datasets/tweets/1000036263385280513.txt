@AOC A federal job guarantee for all would push nearly everyone into the non-essential category.  Explain exactly how that works during future shutdowns.
@AOC You believe there should be a Federal Jobs Guarantee, creating a "baseline quality for employments that guarantees a minimum $15 wage (pegged to inflation), full healthcare, and paid child and sick leave for all." How's that going to work now and during future shutdowns?
@KamalaHarris Federal workers and contractors are made fully aware of the fact that sometimes the government shuts down when they are hired. Are you denying this fact?

@TIME 8.His final project,Democracy for the Arab World Now was meant to aid Islamists. According to Azzam Al-Tamimi, an old Muslim Brotherhood ally aiding Jamal, ‚ÄúThe Muslim Brothers and Islamists were the biggest victims of the foiled Arab spring.‚Äù Al-Tamimi has endorsed suicide bombs
@TIME 7. ‚ÄúSaudis tend to link the ugliness of what happened in NY and Washington with what has happened and continues to happen in Palestine. It is time that the United States comes to understand the effect of its foreign policy and the consequences of that policy,‚Äù he declared
@TIME 6. When the other 19 hijackers perpetrated the attacks of September 11, Khashoggi wrote that the Saudis would not ‚Äúgive in‚Äù to American ‚Äúdemands‚Äù for ‚Äúunconditional condemnation‚Äù and ‚Äútotal cooperation‚Äù.
@TIME 5. After Afghanistan, Jamal Khashoggi went to work as a media adviser for former Saudi intel boss, Prince Turki bin Faisal, alleged to have links to Al Qaeda. Those allegations came from, among others, Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged twentieth hijacker.
@TIME 4.The media calls Khashoggi a journalist, but his writings from 80s Afghanistan read as Jihadist propaganda with titles like, ‚ÄúArab Mujahadeen in Afghanistan II: Exemplifies the Unity of Islamic Ummah‚Äù.
@TIME 3.The friendship endured with Khashoggi following Osama bin Laden to Afghanistan Khashoggi credited Adel Batterjee, listed at one time as one of ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs foremost terrorist financiers‚Äù by the Treasury Department, with bringing him to Afghanistan to report on the fighting.
@TIME 2.	‚ÄúWe were hoping to establish an Islamic state anywhere,‚Äù Khashoggi reminisced about their time together in the Muslim Brotherhood. ‚ÄúWe believed that the first one would lead to another, and that would have a domino effect which could reverse the history of mankind.‚Äù
