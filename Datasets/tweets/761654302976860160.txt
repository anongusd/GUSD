In the end we only have one another. There‚Äôs only one you, and regardless of your beliefs you are worthy. Your age doesn‚Äôt matter, political affiliation, or your ethnic background. You. Are. Important.
End the stigma. Talk to one another. Reach out. I once had someone tell me that all you need to do is reach your hand out, and someone will grab it. Be that someone. If you need that someone please reach out to someone. If you don‚Äôt have anyone, I am here. I will connect you.
No one tells you when you‚Äôre younger how to cope. I was often told to ‚Äúdestress‚Äù, with no advice on how to do that. So I cut it all out. I went back to my roots and have built up a stronger human as a result. I survived for myself, my son, and the people around me.
Today, with the help of some courageous people in life all around me, I am able to stand up and say that I survived. I lived through depression. I survived two suicide attempts in 5 years. I survived inpatient care. And I survived my demonizing thoughts.
You see, when one lives in isolation, negative things happen. Sure, I had many friends and acquaintances. But I didn‚Äôt have myself. All I had was being given to everyone else and I couldn‚Äôt make time for myself. When you add in post-partum issues, it got really messy.
NAMI was a big help during that time as I realized there were people working to destigmatize the mental illness epidemic facing the world. I quit my 3 jobs, dropped out of university, and moved home. It was the best decision I could have made for myself.
I wasn‚Äôt sure if my words would jeopardize the positions I held, or if they would cause me to lose my very young child. So I remained silent and let it build up until I couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. My son was with a family member because I needed to be angry for a while- a first.
I was coming down from the effects of psilocybin, and had no idea what I had gotten myself into. I was young- much younger than my current self. I was afraid to talk about it because of the stigma attached to drug use, and mental illness in general.
While I was there, I learned a lot of things about how your brain works. I learned why some people develop some mental illnesses, and why some don‚Äôt. I never heard voices, or had hallucinations. But, after a particularly rough period, I was a little delusional.
Mental health is such an important thing to talk about for so many reasons. I have struggled with mental health issues for over half my life as a result of traumatic events, genetics, and ignorance on the part of many people. I didn‚Äôt know how to cope until I went to college.
