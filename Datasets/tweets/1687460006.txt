@bentonhowser I did not. Check email I sent you. Been calling strong Senate pick ups for over a year. And keep the House a bit more recently.
My fave House race of cycle: MN-7 still blue on @CNN map (&amp;everyone else's). But this one going red (my most variant call). @DHughesCongress is great candidate no one paying attn. to b/c he will unseat 28 year Dem incumbent- doesn't fit MSM narrative. Trump+30 district in 2016!!
@bentonhowser @CNN @TheDemocrats @GOP Bro- you got that from me.
.@CNN also has MN-8 Leans GOP (light red...vs middle red- Likely GOP &amp; dark red- Safe GOP). MN-8 has a grt GOP challenger, @PeteStauber, up 15-20pts the entire race &amp; Dem knows how far behind he is- can see it in campaign. Its over. But CNN won't let it go. Going down swinging.
.@JohnKingCNN stated that if Dems flip two seats in Virginia (VA-10 Comstock- captures part of metro DC &amp; large govt workforce constituency....&amp; VA-7 Richmond area Dave Brat- who knocked out Cantor) that will be determined early- then it's PROOF of blue wave. He wishes. Nonsense.
Soy boys of @CNN still talking pathway to the @TheDemocrats control of Senate üòÇ		There is a better shot of @GOP getting to 60 (filibuster proof majority) than Dems getting to 51. But MSM activists going down swinging:)
