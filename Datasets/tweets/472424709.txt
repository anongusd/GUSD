@oddtv3 Hey man. Do you think you could stop using the term "flat earth" in your titles and descriptions on youtube? Now that both youtube and facebook have decided to crack down on that, it's probably a good idea to come up with other terms, like i.e "True Earth" or something.

@PoliticsGhost Just to let your listeners know. Most of these gamer listeners at least already have the hardware necessary to mine bitcoin.

@PoliticsGhost Yea that dipping sauce is crazy. Hoping for a 3rd wave.
@HARD8TIMES What new TV did you buy, man? Just curious.
@PoliticsGhost  DOW is still not waving though. JNPR is still mega waving. So at least that one is a huge money maker.
@PoliticsGhost Same with jmei.ch.
@PoliticsGhost Yea I know. Thanks for helping us out #Ghost. I really appreciate it.
@bentonbannon Yea, it's their dumbass spam filter. Using #Stocks and #Ghost in every tweet is probably not the best idea @PoliticsGhost.
@IGNorge Etoro ftw.
@PoliticsGhost Wow. The nerve of today's teens, man. No respect.
@727caller1 @PoliticsGhost DM him. Did you not read the tweet?
@PoliticsGhost God, I hate neighbors.
@PoliticsGhost Actually most of Europe was affected by the attack Tried with different VPNs. We're back online here in Norway at least.
@PoliticsGhost Yea that sucks. There's always paltalk though.
@PoliticsGhost You should probably stop taking these anonymous callers.
@ground_score74 @PoliticsGhost @wikileaks I agree. My heart is jumping backwards here.

@JonesJtommy16  Hi. Do u think u could port your games to Linux? Especially SM Coin Land 1 &amp; 2. Ur using Unity, so it shouldn't be that hard
@TVOThief Gotcha. Thanks :)
@TVOThief You mean if I pre-order it I'll be able to choose Linux? Because there's nothing on that site about Linux. It says Windows and Mac
@OriBlindForest BUG: Please fix! Fonts are displayed as pink blocks due to a rendering bug. Effects under Wine. See: https://t.co/rn1DhEzcfk
@TVOThief Why isn't there a Linux version? Seeing as you're using the Unity engine, it should be pretty easy to achieve. Great game btw :)

@ZippCast_com could you guys add m4v to your video extensions list? You already have mp4 in there, which means m4v will also work just fine.

@playouya Will you build a more expensive version of ouya with better specs for those who want to use it for wii emulaton, Wine and such?

@ghostpolitics It's just a twitter account. Do you really think Ghost or anyone could give less shit about it?
@RegularCapital Dude, that guy is obviously not ghost.	Why? Because ghost has a life.	The radio host "ghost" is obviously not using twitter.
