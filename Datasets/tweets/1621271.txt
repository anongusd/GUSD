@Gerboo0 @Lrihendry @NickSzabo4 that's true you're right but there's no actual transaction no invoice we can make a demand against use of our data rights or to make claims for, at least there isn't yet and this might (may have to) change. In reality they (datalords) have all the power we have none.

@Stevewal63 @seandotau @drupal @Twitter @facebook @ecademy @LinkedIn Free is at last drawing to an end thank goodness
@Stevewal63 @seandotau @drupal I seek a paid membership @twitter @facebook with physical events like @ecademy and I pay the premium membership @linkedin but no events and no identity with those who pay premium. Advertising funded free models build scale not trust and ultimately harm those advertising brands.
@Stevewal63 @seandotau sure is Steve but the model requires a payment gateway i.e. one dollar per month @drupal because the free model has proven to create distrust, anxiety, loneliness, depression, low self esteem and less connectedness to more people. Free hasn't worked and has killed trust.
