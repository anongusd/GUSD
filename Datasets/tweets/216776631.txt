How is it that the billionaires of this country get huge tax breaks, but our teachers and children get broken chairs, flooded classrooms and inadequate support staff in their schools?		I‚Äôm running for president because we need a radical change in national priorities.
If we can spend over $700 billion on our military every year we can certainly make public colleges and universities tuition-free in America.
There are 140 million poor and low-income people in this country, while the three richest people are together worth over $318 billion. 		This is the reason we fight for a government and economy that work for more than the top 1%.
Clearly, Pence and Trump are afraid of our campaign because when 1 million people volunteer in a week, the president and VP know our grassroots campaign is the strongest challenge to their chances for re-election. They know our ideas are widely supported by the America people. https://t.co/tfJplW92MF

We must follow cities and states across the country and raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and index it to median wage growth thereafter. Doing so would give more than 40 million low-wage workers a raise, more than 25 percent of the U.S. workforce.
In the United States, drug companies can charge whatever they want and raise prices whenever they want. That's not the case in other countries around the world. 		We've got to stop letting pharma rip off the American people.
While many Republicans leaders want to cut Social Security, about half of older Americans have no retirement savings. We need to EXPAND Social Security, not destroy it.
We spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as any nation, yet our health outcomes are worse and life expectancy is in decline. How does that make any sense?		It is time for us to join every other major country and guarantee health care to all people as a right.
The pharmaceutical industry is the greediest entity in the country. And the way we are going to beat them is by millions of people standing up and saying, "You're not going to get away with killing Americans any longer."

Americans should not die without the medication they need because drug companies want to make even bigger profits. I‚Äôm running for president because we need to take on the pharmaceutical industry's outrageous greed and lower drug prices in this country.
Our campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country. We must restore the Voting Rights Act, overturn Citizens United, end voter suppression and gerrymandering, make Election Day a holiday and move to public funding of elections.
We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance. We should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages.
We are spending $80 billion a year to lock up 2.2 million people, disproportionately African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans. We need real, comprehensive criminal justice reform. We must invest in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. https://t.co/7tn2uHVmCq
Our campaign is rooted in the principle of solidarity. We recognize that every person on this planet shares a common humanity, that we all want our children to grow up healthy, to have a good education, have decent jobs, drink clean water, breathe clean air and live in peace.
Our campaign is about thinking big. We can be a nation that transforms our energy system away from fossil fuels toward sustainable energies and that leads the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change.
I stand with @OaklandEA teachers who are fighting for smaller class sizes, fairer pay, more student support, and fundamentally defending public education. Oakland must not shut down 24 of the city‚Äôs 87 public schools.
I‚Äôm running for president because we need leadership that will fight for the interests of workers, not just the 1 percent. We must:		-Raise the minimum wage to a living wage of $15	-Provide pay equity for women	-Guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave
Our campaign is based upon a very simple principle: Real change never comes from the top on down. It always comes from the bottom on up.		When millions of us stand together, there is nothing we cannot accomplish. https://t.co/QQcle42XW8

In the last year, more American workers went on strike than in any year in nearly 3 decades.		When we stand together and fight, we can accomplish anything. We can transform this country from the bottom on up.
At a time when half of older Americans over the age of 55 have no retirement savings, our job is to expand Social Security to make sure that everyone in this country can retire with the dignity they have earned and everyone with a disability can live with the security they need.
We must do everything that we can to preserve American democracy and oppose the current drift toward authoritarianism that I believe Trump represents. 		Those of us who believe in democracy and that our government must be accountable to its people must stand up and fight back.
Those who think universal health care is a fantasy might want to learn about Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, U.K. and many other countries who have made health care a right.
The top 10 corporate executives in America saw their combined compensation skyrocket to $1.8 billion in 2017. Ten people.		Meanwhile we have 40 million people living in poverty. That kind of inequality should not exist in a modern society.

Since the Parkland shooting one year ago, nearly 1,200 American kids have been killed by guns. This is an epidemic that has got to be stopped.		We must follow the lead of the young activists who have bravely stood up to the NRA, and pass commonsense gun safety legislation.
In the richest nation in the history of the world, it's a moral and political failing that nearly 30 million Americans don‚Äôt have health insurance. We must go forward to finally guarantee health care for all as a right through a Medicare for All, single-payer program.
The Walton family makes more money in one minute than Walmart workers do in an entire year. This is what we mean when we talk about a rigged economy.
Social Security is the most successful government program in our nation‚Äôs history. We must expand it so that every American can retire with the dignity and respect they deserve.
There is something profoundly wrong when one family in our country, the Walton family, owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans. We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the rich and powerful.
A moral society does not give tax breaks to billionaires, and then cut back on the needs of struggling seniors or people with disabilities. We must get our priorities straight and expand Social Security.
We cannot continue a dysfunctional healthcare system which costs us about twice as much per capita as any other major country and leaves nearly 30 million Americans uninsured. We must guarantee health care for everyone through a Medicare for All program.
Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs because, unlike other countries, the United States doesn‚Äôt directly regulate the price of medicine. That‚Äôs why I introduced the Prescription Drug Price Relief Act to rein in the greed of Big Pharma.
If we are going to successfully combat climate change, we must have the courage to take on the greed of the fossil fuel industry which is driving this crisis‚Äîas well as well as the politicians who have been bought off and refuse to do anything to address it.
The current federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour is a starvation wage. It must be raised to $15 an hour and indexed to median wage growth thereafter. Doing so would give more than 40 million Americans a raise.
When it comes to taking on the imminent threat of climate change, we cannot think small. We must enact bold solutions to save our planet from the disastrous effects of climate change by passing the Green New Deal to save the planet and create millions of new jobs.
We must end the international embarrassment of being the only major country on earth, the only one, which does not guarantee workers paid medical and family leave, paid sick time and paid vacation time.
Enough is enough. We have to summon the courage to take on the fossil fuel industry. We must accelerate our transition to clean energy, and finally put people before the profits of polluters.
In a society with our resources, it is unconscionable that we do not properly invest in our children from the very first stages of their lives. We need universal, publicly funded childcare.
I stand with the Denver teachers. Public education is fundamental to any functioning democratic society, and teaching is one of its most valuable and indispensable professions. We need to treat educators with respect and dignity.  #DenverTeacherStrike
We must recognize the collective power of the labor movement to demand and win respect and equity for workers across the country. When we stand together, we can win.
With Medicare for All, Americans will benefit from the freedom and security that comes with finally separating health insurance from employment. That freedom would mean American workers would no longer have to choose between bargaining for higher wages or better health insurance.
When people tell us the only thing that we can get is incremental health care change, we will tell them ‚Äúno thanks.‚Äù We‚Äôre thinking big and demanding fundamental change on this issue.
Medicare for all is a struggle not just about health care, but about the heart and soul of our country ‚Äî about what we stand for as a people. And it is a struggle that we are going to win.
At a time when we see an unprecedented and coordinated attack against a woman‚Äôs right to choose, it is incredibly important that we fight to make sure that every woman in this country has the right to control her own body.
While the ruling class may have the money, we have something that is even more powerful on our side ‚Äì the people. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.
The mark of a great nation is judged not by how many tax breaks it can give to billionaires, but by how it treats its most vulnerable people.

One of the major, untold stories of our time is the rapid movement toward global oligarchy. It is not acceptable that the top 1% of the world‚Äôs population owns half the planet‚Äôs wealth, while the bottom 70% of the working age population accounts for just 2.7% of global wealth.
Real and fundamental change never comes from the top on down. It‚Äôs never given to anybody. It always comes from the bottom on up, from grassroots activism, from millions of people standing up and fighting for justice.
In the twenty-first century, a public education system that goes from early childhood education through high school is not good enough. We must make public colleges and universities tuition-free.
We have a dysfunctional childcare system in this country, which is too expensive for parents, while providers are paid totally inadequate wages. We need to do what other countries around the world do ‚Äì develop a high quality universal child care program.
Instead of giving huge tax breaks to billionaires and profitable corporations, we must create the best public educational system in the world. Instead of major increases in military spending, we must invest in our kids.
Correction: more than half of older Americans have no retirement savings.

Racial equality must be central to combatting economic inequality, if we are to build an economy that works for all of us, and not just the top 1%.

Just a few years ago, we were told that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour was ‚Äòradical.‚Äô It is not a radical idea to say a job should lift you out of poverty, not keep you in it. We must increase the federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 to $15 an hour.

It was not an immigrant picking strawberries at $8 an hour who destroyed the economy in 2008. It was the greed and illegal behavior of Wall Street.
President Trump and his friends in the fossil fuel industry are destroying the planet in the name of short-term profits. Enough is enough. We have got to act boldly to combat climate change today.
We must create a vibrant democracy where the voices of all people are heard. We must build a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and economic, social, racial, and environmental justice.
For the last ten years, Congress, giving tax breaks to the rich, has forgotten to raise the minimum wage. $7.25/hr is a starvation wage. After ten years of inaction, it‚Äôs time to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour.
Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour may have been a fringe idea a few years ago, but now it is a mainstream idea whose time has come.

Our job is to build on our common humanity and do everything that we can to oppose all of the forces, whether unaccountable government power or unaccountable corporate power, who try to divide us up and set us against each other.
If our government can provide a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the richest 1% and expand military spending by $165 billion over 2 years, we can surely make public colleges and universities throughout the country tuition-free.

I want to thank the many activists I met with who informed me about these important ballot measures nationwide which can help us create a fairer and just society. We must rise to the historic occasion and make sure we have record voter turnout so we can transform this nation.
With the recent report from the IPCC noting the drastic action required to prevent the worst impacts of climate change, Initiative 1631 is an important step forward for the people of Washington State.
Question 1 in Massachusetts would set a safe maximum on the number of patients nurses can treat, so that patients can receive the quality care they deserve. Nurses are behind this initiative, and I trust them when it comes to knowing what is best for their patients.
Florida has the opportunity to re-enfranchise 1.4 million formerly incarcerated people to fully participate as citizens. Passing Amendment 4 is an important step for both voting rights and criminal justice reform.
Given the crisis we face with climate change, in my view we should move toward a total ban on fracking. At a minimum, it seems obvious that we must protect communities from the environmental damage that fracking causes. In my view Colorado voters should support 112.
Colorado Amendment 74, pushed by the fossil fuel industry, seems to be one of the most dangerous propositions in the country. It could open the flood gates for oil, gas and other corporate interests to bankrupt the state. This extremely dangerous amendment must be defeated.
How is it possible that in Colorado a majority of school districts can only afford to keep their schools open 4 days a week? How are teachers paid wages so low that some have to work two jobs to survive? Our kids deserve a high-quality education. Amendment 73 is a no-brainer.
Currently California cities and towns aren't permitted to pass rent control measures to address the affordable housing crisis. That should change. Municipalities should have the freedom to deal with the decline in affordable housing and rising rents. Let's pass Prop 10.

In a nation where corporate media defines what's "acceptable," voter turnout lags behind almost every major nation and billionaires can buy elections, our job is to open the doors of democracy and elect candidates who support economic, social, racial and environmental justice.
This is what the political revolution is all about. All across this country working people and young people are getting involved in the political process, running grassroots campaigns, taking on the establishment and winning elections. https://t.co/M7RopYkhfT

The people of Maryland understand that we can most effectively oppose Donald Trump's extremism with strong progressive leadership at the state and local level -- and there are few progressives stronger than @BenJealous.
Congratulations to @BenJealous on his great victory tonight! Ben showed that running a progressive, issue-oriented campaign can bring all working people together in the fight for justice.
Congratulations to @Ocasio2018  on her extraordinary upset victory tonight! She took on the entire local Democratic establishment in her district and won a very strong victory. She demonstrated once again what progressive grassroots politics can do.
CO, NY, MD, MS, OK &amp; UT: If you haven't voted yet, get to your polling place &amp; make your voice heard! When we stand together and fight, we can elect real progressives to every level of government - progressives like @BenJealous, @richardbrunomd, @Joe4COAG &amp; @EmilyForCO.
There's a reason why Nikki Haley has tried to discredit the UN report on poverty in America. It's because in the wealthiest country in history, millions are living in abysmal poverty, have no health insurance, can't afford prescription drugs and can't find affordable housing.
When you represent the billionaire class and have nothing relevant to say to working families, the only way you win elections is by suppressing the vote and making it harder for ordinary people to participate in our democracy. https://t.co/chcnhVTeMS
Now is not a time for despair or resignation. It is a time for the American people to fight back on every front.		https://t.co/IE0T7iil9c
Trump's pathological dishonesty is undermining American democracy, is setting a terrible example for our children and is isolating us from our democratic allies around the world.
Honest people can have philosophical and political differences and, in a democracy, we debate those differences.  That's a good thing. Today, however, we do not have a president who discusses ideas or debates issues. He simply lies all the time. And that's a very bad thing.
The rally in Washington will start at 10 a.m. on the Mall at 7th Street.

No one, including Clinton, should ever face meddling from foreign government https://t.co/bMKOAGVQAw
The findings of Robert Mueller's investigation must be taken seriously at every level of government, and he must be allowed to investigate without any interference from the White House or Congress.
Mueller's indictment provides further evidence that the Russian government interfered in 2016. It also shows that they tried to turn my supporters against Hillary Clinton in the primary and general election. I unequivocally condemn such interference.
The key issues now are: 		1) How we prevent the unwitting manipulation of our electoral and political system by foreign governments.	2) Exposing who was actively consorting with the Russian government‚Äôs attack on our democracy.
As someone who campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton from one end of this country to another, it is an outrage that she had to run against not only Donald Trump but also the Russian government.
What the Russians did in the 2016 election cycle deserves unconditional condemnation. That includes all of their conduct - whether it was active support of any candidate or active opposition to any candidate.

We need a Labor Secretary who will stand up for workers, raising the minimum wage &amp; pay equity for women. Mr. Puzder was not that candidate.
We need to know if President Trump's foreign policy represents the best interests of this country or the best interests of Russia.
Our job: Break up the major financial institutions, not appoint more Wall Street executives to the administration as Trump has done.
Our job is to grow the trade union movement so that workers, white collar and blue collar, can stand up and fight for their rights.

What I say to the American people is: stay focused. We will fight for an economy that works for all and doesn‚Äôt just benefit the wealthy.
We‚Äôve got to bring people together around a progressive agenda. They want to raise the minimum wage and make health care a right.
Trump is a total hypocrite. He campaigned saying I'm going to take on Wall Street, and then he hires the president of Goldman Sachs.
When Donald Trump attacks the  media as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù what he is doing is trying to move our country in an authoritarian direction.

The American people are settling in for a long and sustained fight to defend democracy and the values which have made us a great county.
We believe in a nation based on economic, social, racial and environmental justice and we've just begun to fight back.
We should be looking for guidance now not from pollsters and political consultants, but from leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr.
Given Trump's dangerous and unconstitutional actions, the Democratic Party can no longer do politics "as usual."
Putting Steve Bannon, an extreme right-wing operative, on the National Security Council is dangerous and he should be removed.

The American people want real change, a change based on compassion and justice, not hatred, intolerance and divisiveness.

We cannot stay silent and watch the GOP dismantle the health care system and jeopardize the economic security of millions of Americans.
Some politicians still refuse to recognize the reality of climate change. It's 2017. That's a disgrace.
It's simple, really: Politicians should be working for their constituents' votes, not lobbyists' money. That's not radical. It's democracy.

You cannot be a party which takes money from Wall Street and then tells working families you are on their side. People see through that.

We are living in a nation which worships wealth rather than caring for the poor. I don't think that is the nation we should be living in.
The wealthy have seen their incomes rise immensely in the last 30 years. It is not class warfare to say they don't need another tax break.
Money and wealth should serve the people. The people should not have to serve money and wealth.
There is something profoundly wrong when one family owns more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.
Cuts to life and death programs like Medicare and massive tax breaks for the wealthy‚Äîthat's not what America is supposed to be about.

High drug prices isn‚Äôt just about people dying, it‚Äôs about people having to go deeply into debt to get the medication they need.
Drug companies make huge profits and executives get big compensation package, while Americans die because they can't afford their medication
If you want to understand why we pay such high drug prices listen to this: Since 1998 the drug industry has spent $3 billion on lobbying.

I have a message for Donald Trump: No, we‚Äôre not going to hate Latinos or Muslims. We are going to stand together.
Make no mistake: the billionaire class does not want young and working people to vote.
In the shameful days of open segregation, literacy laws were used to suppress minority voting. Today, Republicans do it with photo ID laws.
Through a Prize Fund we can provide affordable access to medicines as soon as they are available on the market.
The prices of patented medicines are a significant barrier to access to health for millions Americans and people die because of it.
It should offend the conscience of every American when the votes of minorities are suppressed.	https://t.co/mv7a2hlj8Q
Poverty should not be a death sentence, neither in the United States nor anywhere else.  Yet it is, much to our disgrace.
We will defeat Donald Trump because we know that love trumps hatred.	https://t.co/Cx92gzemgo
It‚Äôs fun for the media to treat Trump like a character in a soap opera, but the truth is his language is dangerous.
In my view, it makes a lot more sense to be investing in jobs and education, than more jails and incarceration.
We must once again make our country the leader in the fight for economic and social justice, for environmental sanity and for peace.
If @realDonaldTrump wants to open the door to racism, it is our job to shut that door, and shut it tight.
The greed of the billionaire class is destroying this country and whether they like it or not we are going to stop that greed.
I believe we have a moral obligation to pursue diplomatic solutions before resorting to military intervention.
Trump suggested limiting immigration according to religion and creating a national database based on religion ‚Äì absolutely disgraceful.
To advance the cause of peace, the United States has also got to be a friend not only to Israel, but to the Palestinian people.
We have got to say to the fossil-fuel industry that their short-term profits are not more important than the future of this planet.
At a time of massive inequality, the Republicans believe that the richest people in America need to be made even richer.
I hope the Republicans listen to what the Pope has to say. Denying the science related to climate change is no longer acceptable.
What we've accomplished so far is historic ‚Äì but our work is far from over. This political revolution must continue.	https://t.co/W6sceUdv4I
Today in America we not only have an absence level of wealth and income inequality, we have a power structure that protects that inequality.
Lifting the cap on Social Security would increase cost-of-living-adjustments and increase minimum benefits paid to low-income seniors.
Our younger generation may have a lower standard of living than their parents. This is not what America is about.	https://t.co/pEuFOF2Iwo
I'm asking people across the nation to come together and organize an unprecedented grassroots movement.
Together we're going to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed millionaires to buy politicians.
Despite what the media tells you, politics is not a soap opera. Politics is about coming together to improve the lives of all.
We need a grassroots movement to tell the Koch brothers and the billionaire class that they won't be able to continue to buy elections.
We are building a movement because this country belongs to all of us - not just a handful of billionaires and wealthy campaign contributors.
No president alone can effectively address the crises facing the working families of this country without a powerful grassroots movement.
At what point will Congress have the courage to stand up to the greed of the pharmaceutical industry and say enough is enough?
American pharmaceutical companies couple outrageous prices on drugs with new and inventive ways to avoid paying taxes. It's truly shameless.
This is not a moment. It's a movement. And you are our movement. Get involved: https://t.co/m6S1VUVosJ
We must allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and reduce the barriers to importing prescription drugs from Canada and other countries.
Real tax reform means Wall Street, the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share.	https://t.co/NPIeBgxxdo
We need to re-enfranchise the more than 5 million Americans who have had their right to vote taken away by a felony conviction.
For the last 40 years the great middle class of our country ‚Äî once the envy of the world ‚Äî has been disappearing.
One in five people can't afford the prescription drugs their doctors prescribe. Elderly people are cutting pills in half for goodness' sake.
War must be the last resort, not the first response.
Change cannot take place without political participation.

Our movement is about creating an America that ensures nobody working 40 hours a week has to live in poverty.
In a democratic society, politics should not be treated like a baseball game or a soap opera. We need a serious discussion about the issues.
Shameful. We must require states to collect data on deaths that happen in police custody and make that data public. https://t.co/Ct2hjmGYG6
Billionaires buying elections is not what our Constitution stands for. https://t.co/P3QQeEpYA4
We need to end minimum sentencing. Too many people in America are serving unnecessarily long mandatory minimum sentences.
We must implement universal voter registration, so that anyone 18 years of age or older who is eligible to vote is automatically registered.
The debate is over. Climate change is real, it's caused by human activity and is already causing devastating damage to the entire planet.
In the United States of America we can create the conditions that allow people who are released from prison to stay out.

Pathetic. Billionaire Bully Trump wants to give huge tax breaks to the rich but opposes raising the federal minimum wage of $7.25.
Republican governors are working overtime to suppress the vote. If Republicans can't face a free election, they should get another job.
Sandra Bland. We will #SayHerName.
