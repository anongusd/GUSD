New York Democrats are to blame for @Amazon disaster: https://t.co/isx9fXVyvR
Clear lesson from @Amazon disaster: Time for New York Gov’t leaders to speak out and make it clear that radical progressives will not control decisions affecting future of NY. Real leaders don’t surrender to fear or intimidation or stay quiet when strong voices are needed.
Voted to fully fund govt &amp; avoid another disastrous shutdown. Hope @POTUS Trump realizes he can’t take advice from Freedom Caucus. They led him into shutdown w no chance of winning like Charge of Light Brigade. &amp; last night they abandoned him to vote w anti-Trump progressive left
This is one time I agree with @NYCMayor de Blasio and @NYGovCuomo. Loss of @Amazon is terrible for New York. All because progressives put sanctimony and ideological purity before workers and taxpayers. Sad day for New York.
Absolutely disgraceful that @Amazon is driven from New York by left wing progressive politicians. Terrible loss of jobs for New York workers and New York economy.
