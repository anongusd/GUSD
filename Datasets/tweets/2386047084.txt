@OfficialMaleeka @PRisUs You know as #PRPros we have to cover all aspect of our work. That previous client made a believer out of me. It was so bad I was dreaming about her and work...I had to let her go. I refused to have her trying to invade and work me in my dreams! üòÇüòÇ
@OfficialMaleeka @PRisUs Yes, that was very disrespectful. This makes me want to add a ‚Äúme and only me‚Äù clause in my contracts with clients...lol
@alyssamurt A7: I was once asked, ‚ÄúIs there anything about this company that would give you second thoughts about joining the team?‚Äù Oh, and upon finding out that I didn‚Äôt get the job, I was told, ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt offer you the job because we thought you would get bored...‚Äù #PRSSA
@OfficialMaleeka @PRisUs That makes absolutely zero sense at all.
@alyssamurt A5: My brand is who I am. My portfolio connects my passion for PR to my purpose of finding the right fit within an organization. Your brand is not just about logos and taglines, but about your unique voice and how you represent yourself. #PRSSA
@thecolinwylie @PRSSANational I appreciate that. I‚Äôm actually in the process of starting my own firm! I need all the support I can get! üò¨üò¨
@alyssamurt A3: Indeed, LinkedIn, https://t.co/zT3hsdQWks, Glassdoor. It‚Äôs great to establish relationships with individuals on Twitter that can help in your search as well. #PRSSA
@PRSSANational A2: Having a lack of experience, which leads to doubt and fear of rejection.  #PRSSA
@PRSSANational A1: Learn as much as you can from whomever you can within the organization. Never be afraid to take on new tasks. It shows your willingness to being a team player. Oh, and be on time! #PRSSA

@A_Schweigert Yes! And giveaways. Who doesn‚Äôt like a good giveaway?
@semrush A4: Knowing your audience is crucial, which means knowing the voice of your brand and the brand of your audience. Also, know when to tweet! What works on one social media platform may not work for another. It‚Äôs not one size fits all. And use images and GIFS! #SEMRUSHChat
@semrush A3:  Utilize people you‚Äôve built personal relationships and trust. Reach out to them in the real world and build the foundation of your communication strategy in person. Face to Face and word of mouth still has more value than you might think. #SEMRUSHChat
@semrush A2: 	1. Be sure to keep your username and handle consistent across all of your social platforms with your brand name and website. This maximizes your findability.	2. Avoid using numbers within your username and handle because it may come across as spammy. #SEMrushchat
@Annette_Sugden @alexdebecker @semrush Agreed! I‚Äôve connected and met so many great #PRPros participating in Twitter chats. You gain amazing insight and wonderful friendships.
@semrush A1. Engage, engage, engage! Stay consistent and transparent. Communication is everything! #semrush
@PRisUs When they make ridiculous request. I had a client that did not want me to pitch via email.

The 5 Basic Journalist Responses to PR Pitches https://t.co/kPiTkuupjr #PitchChronicles
Do you know when it‚Äôs appropriate to write a #pressrelease and when to use a #PRpitch? #PitchChronicles
Clear, concise and to the point. Subject line of email should be creative and grab the attention of the journalist/reporters attention immediately. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/VcWHXUoQ5p
Three ways to keep your next pitch from getting trashed according to @PRDaily:		1. Target reporters first, not editors.	2. Pitch people, not products.        	3. Assist with assets and access. #PitchChronicles
Agreed! This is the only time Twitter creeping is acceptable. Research the journalist you‚Äôre pitching. Trust me, it‚Äôs worth it to know the types of stories he or she covers. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/KabGaWfYSX
Yes! Being relatable goes a long way. Being able to understand the journalist you are pitching and their audience not only says you‚Äôre familiar with their work, it also gives you a key advantage over your competition. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/lxgCeAoisJ

This pitch has been circulating like crazy and obviously send to every reporter/journalists in the US....any thoughts?? #PitchChronicles https://t.co/oHdJ1gNE26
Recently, there was a pitch circulating where the #PR pro sent the exact same pitch to every single reporter within the same office.  It was posted on Twitter under the hashtag #prfail for all to see. It takes a little more time, but personalize your pitches. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/lGIc3xgKxd
Send a follow-up email if you haven‚Äôt heard from the journalist/reporter after three or four business days. Also, instead of resending the original message, offer something new or exclusive that was not in the original email. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/OFq6F5bQ40
Timing is everything! #PitchChronicles https://t.co/oV5a5xB64q
Give journalists what they ask for, nothing more, nothing less. You want journalists to sit up and take notice and you want to foster a respectable relationship. This will not cut it. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/f6dOm3T475
Pay attention to detail. It‚Äôs little errors such as this that will land your pitch in the sunken place.  Triple check your work before hitting the send button. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/YzE8NJEz6p
When I doubt, leave it out. Pitches should be clear concise and to the point. PR = consistency. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/JSc4ylE7HC

Ending tonight‚Äôs #PitchChronicles  with this thought. Everyone has their own idea and perspective on how to effectively write and deliver a pitch. Let‚Äôs consider this and learn how to respect each other‚Äôs craft.
I know as a #PR newbie, my goal was to be the best of the best, an influencer, a thought leader. I wanted to pitch to the world. I understand it can be frustrating on both sides of the coin, but patience and respect for one another goes a long way. #PitchChronicles https://t.co/G2uPvzovmq

Yes! Sending pitches to journalist haphazardly and not fully knowing who they are and what they cover will land your pitch in the #PR sucker place! Research, research and research again. #PRChronicles https://t.co/lk1VGYsUUn

@CardCommsStrats @CaddyMarketing Because this is racial in nature, makes coming up with a solution somewhat difficult. I almost feel as though the damage is done.

@PRisUs @angelapriestley I agree. The statistic is like 5 #PR pros for every journalist. The relationship between #PR pros and journalists is like a broken marriage and it‚Äôs very unfortunate. It‚Äôs sad that one bad pitch makes it that must harder for us to catch a break.
@PRisUs @angelapriestley I‚Äôve been conducting a lot of research lately and many journalists do not believe a follow up response is necessary. That no response means not interested. There is definitely a disconnect between #PR pros and journalist. How can we bridge the gap? Can‚Äôt we all just get along?
