@BenScionti Couldn‚Äôt he just veto that power grab?
@IAmKrishanPatel @BenScionti Not necessarily. You always speak in certainties when it comes to 2022, as if Democratic President guarantees a GOP Senator. 2022 is a bad Senate map for Republicans and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be certain pickups in any state. Dems are more likely to gain seats tbh

@OfficialClayyy @giulioiacoviel You‚Äôre not bursting my bubble bc I still strongly disagree. And we don‚Äôt know for sure who will do well at debates. That remains to be seen
@OfficialClayyy I think you and most people on this website drastically underestimate Booker and overestimate Harris. He‚Äôs a much bigger deal than anyone is giving him credit for
@giulioiacoviel @OfficialClayyy He‚Äôs more well known than most candidates but that hardly matters at this point. His outstanding qualities is that he is an engaging speaker and will probably crush the debates. The big pharma issue is overblown bc every candidate has shady donors (Wall street, charter schools)
@OfficialClayyy Clearly not. Why would you think that?
@ChazNuttycombe @AndrewSolender @Yukongold1898 @abhiprofen Just bc he hadn‚Äôt been a great Minority leader doesn‚Äôt mean he isn‚Äôt a great Senator
@IAmKrishanPatel @ChazNuttycombe Grandstanding is not a big deal; No one outside of Twitter really cares. I think his dramatic flair will be a boon to him.
@ChazNuttycombe I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how Harris is such a better candidate than him and how she‚Äôs destined to win the black vote. You clearly don‚Äôt like him, so you continually write him off. I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs a mistake
He‚Äôs got more genuine star power than any other candidate (announced or potential) and is a captivating speaker. He‚Äôs got a real shot at wining the nomination and the presidency. Idk why people keep writing him off.
Just your periodic reminder that Cory Booker is an exceptionally underrated 2020 candidate. I don‚Äôt think Kamala Harris is destined to win most of the black vote like many people expect, especially since she has a terrible criminal justice background and that‚Äôs his shtick. https://t.co/G32BSivKkv

@jackcurran49 I‚Äôm pretty bearish on his chances to win a Senate seat. Kansas does have a moderate streak. I‚Äôm not saying he couldn‚Äôt, just that he wouldn‚Äôt necessarily win
@jackcurran49 Ehh, he got 42% of the vote: that‚Äôs pretty bad
@aseemru I take 2 pencils and bounce them off each other
@jackcurran49 I would argue NM-02 was the biggest step up, but you also have that one pretty high. I‚Äôd probably put VA-07 at 2nd.
And once again, I rebuke my old beliefs. I think evolution on a political issue is not a bad thing. I was surrounded by pro-lifers so that‚Äôs what I became. Since I have learned more about the issue from an unbiased source, I have acknowledged where I was very wrong.
I think women have and deserve the right to choose. I‚Äôve seen first hand what lack of access to abortion can do to a low income family. If the MFL had so many MAGA hats when I went, I would‚Äôve realized I was being duped. It‚Äôs not pro-life, it‚Äôs pro-birth and that‚Äôs it.
I went to Catholic School and can attest that abortion is the only thing I was taught about for 4 straight years. I actually went to the March for Life in high school but I regret nothing more. It‚Äôs a shameful display of conservatism and nothing more. I identify as pro-choice now https://t.co/HmStlMHuCF

@il_american Except the new map gave Republicans 14 districts and Democrats 13, split down the middle like Florida as a whole
@il_american You still haven‚Äôt addressed how this isn‚Äôt a Republican power grab
@il_american But how is this nothing more than a partisan power grab on the part of FL Republicans? Trump won half of the votes in the state and yet Rs get 65% of the districts. Also, axing Lawson and DMP would be reducing the possibility for minority representation, so likely illegal
@AlsouOl @JacobKlainberg You can't make 3 Safe D seats in NM, but 2 Safe D and 1 swing seat is possible
@il_american Florida voters decided against partisan gerrymandering. And the FL map is very fair, as far a partisan breakdown goes. Also, Florida Rs gaining 5 districts is almost impossible unless it will be a racial gerrymander.
@joncprevo That was just an example. NY Dems could get a few more seats before they lost some. I don't expect it or want it, but its a possibility.
@joncprevo Yeah, but I'm saying if Florida can redistrict for 2020, so could say, Illinois. I don't expect any states to, but its possible
*I accidentally wrote 2 twice	4) No Democratic states gerrymandering (not a guarantee)
This really shows how difficult it will be for Republicans to take back the House in 2020. They would have to rely on:	1) Dems not expanding their majority	2) Dave Loebsack losing (shorthand for strong incumbents)	2) Illegal partisan gerrymandering in FL (a whole 1/4 of seats) https://t.co/4YJZgxx6O6

@BenScionti I‚Äôm actually done with pushing him to run for Senate bc I really don‚Äôt think he will at this point. It would be great, but I strongly doubt it‚Äôll happen. I am really interested in Whitney Williams, who was mentioned as a possible Gov candidate
@ckieser13 @rudnicknoah Yeah, I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt think he can win enough of those voters to win the state
@DogPhoenixWP @Tepper_Dylan He‚Äôs horrible on LGBTQ rights. IRL was pretty good on those issues
@ckieser13 @rudnicknoah No, he very likely couldn‚Äôt. That had shifted way to the right very quickly. The only way for Dems to win Ohio now (very unlikely) is run up huge margins in the cities and suburbs.
In a similar vein, Bullock has made it blindingly clear he doesn‚Äôt want to run for #MTSEN so I think we should stop pushing him too, same with Beto in #TXSEN. Of course I‚Äôd love if they‚Äôd run, but they aren‚Äôt going to. We should focus on finding good alternatives to run instead.
I do not want Stacey Abrams to run for Senate. She doesn‚Äôt want to but people who don‚Äôt know we already have a good recruit lined up (Tomlinson) keep pushing her to run; I don‚Äôt think her heart would be in it.

Of course, there are other potential candidates I didn‚Äôt mention like former statewide officials, namely Linda McCullough, or some State Senator that‚Äôs not very well known. Chris Murphy made a comment that maybe virtually unknown candidates are a benefit. Idk but maybe he‚Äôs right
Another candidate I‚Äôm interested in is Whitney Williams, a businesswoman and member of the ‚Äúfirst family of Montana politics.‚Äù Her father was a longtime Congressman and her mother was Senate Maj Leader. She was mentioned for Gov but perhaps she might also look at a Senate run.
He made a passing comment in an article 3 years ago about how he hadn‚Äôt decided if he‚Äôd run for Gov again (though he didn‚Äôt sound interested).Idk if I‚Äôd even want him to run but think he could potentially clear the field. I know Mike Cooney wants to run, but maybe Senate for him?
Thread on Montana 2020:		So, clearly Bullock doesn‚Äôt want to run for #MTSEN one bit and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough arm twisting that can change his mind. I‚Äôve been looking into that and #MTGOV and found something interesting: apparently Brian Schweitzer can run again.

@BenScionti @LikeIGive_Adam AZ is a state that women have done really well in lately, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any woman with a high enough profile to break through this Senate primary. It‚Äôs a shame, but I‚Äôm glad that women seem to be the front runners in other races too
@OfficialClayyy @EricPerless @davidagordon9 @BenScionti AZ will be a competitive race in 2020 regardless of whether we win or lose. Isakson probably retires and I think GA will have shifted even farther left by then.
@OfficialClayyy @EricPerless @davidagordon9 @BenScionti I wouldn‚Äôt go that far, but they both start as tossup. Wisconsin Republicans have a pretty decent bench (Duffy probably runs). PA is probably the easier pickup, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a guarantee either.
@OfficialClayyy @EricPerless @davidagordon9 @BenScionti Even if 2022 is a red wave, I find it hard to see us still not picking up some seats, kinda like Republicans this year
@EricPerless @OfficialClayyy @davidagordon9 @BenScionti Yeah, I think you‚Äôre right
@OfficialClayyy @EricPerless @davidagordon9 @BenScionti Unless 2022 is a red wave, which I wouldn‚Äôt bet on even with a Dem President, there will be lots of good pickup opportunities. WI, NC, GA, IA will probably be open seats. PA, FL, and AZ if we don‚Äôt win in 2020 are also probably options

If you want an example of an attractive, inspiring House member who narrowly lost a Senate election in a midterm then 2 years later beat a member of leadership, look no further than John Thune. I admit that there are some major differences, these are all thing to consider. #TXSEN
Even though he got massively outspent, Cruz is still a decent fundraiser. And in 2020, Beto (or potentially another candidate) would have good data and a great field operation to build on. And sometimes candidates can do better on a second go-around
Latino and Black turnout will certainly be higher in 2020. There will probably be some districts that swing from Trump +~9 to the Dem and also host a competitive house election. How many people in TX-21/24/10etc would vote for a D for pres and House but not for Senate?
I don‚Äôt like the ‚ÄúIf Beto can‚Äôt beat Cruz, he can‚Äôt beat Cornyn takes.‚Äù Sure, on paper, Cruz seems harder to beat, but there are several reasons why that may not be true. Cruz has a dedicated base that may not care as much about Cornyn, especially if they don‚Äôt turn out for Trump

@joncprevo Oh, definitely. I am not advocating for this map, I just thought it was fun to make
*after a whole semester of not making a map
This map has several competitive districts, but it's designed to maximize the voting power of Milwaukee and Madison.	PVI:	Gray- D+6.15 (Most Dem District)	Green- D+ 2.21	Purple- R+1.78	Red- D+.35	Tan- R+8 (Most R District)	Light Purple- R+4.46	Light Blue- D+1.52	Dark Blue- D+3.83
After a whole semester, , I finally got around to drawing a map. It's compact-ish Dem Gerrymander. There are no tails/wacky shapes, but if you look at the county level, it's really quite egregious. Crucial Waukesha County is split between 4 districts and Dane is split between 3. https://t.co/AToBoRzo5F

@OfficialClayyy @BenScionti 1) He is no more progressive than most other Senate Dems. He's also stylistically more moderate which tbh is more important	2) Everyone will be a punching bag for Trump. Beyond his race, I don't see how he is any worse
@WhoisSamSmith @BenScionti Of course he has ties to Wall Street, hes from NJ. I don't think that is disqualifying itself; if he takes a far-right stance on banking regulations, then sure.

I just wrote a paper on Single Member Districts vs Proportional Representation. Every time a said "a majority," Microsoft Word wanted me to use more concise language, but that changes the *entire* meaning of the sentence. I am pretty over it
@OfficialClayyy Yeah, I'm not sure if I'll say that its likely he'll end up running for Senate, but I certainly think there is still a chance.
@brodiedduncan @BenScionti @politicsluo He would probably be a strong choice for Sec of Education
@BenScionti I was surprised at how big the margin was in the Sec of State Race. Lindeen seemed like a great candidate
@BenScionti I also think we should really fight hard for MT statewide candidates. 2016 was not a good year for them, save Bullock
@BenScionti I think it‚Äôs certainly a factor, but I‚Äôm not trying to say all former governors make bad candidates. Bayh was a bad candidate and TN is just too red. Schweitzer is definitely my second choice behind Bullock
@BenScionti Also former governors running don‚Äôt have a great track record in Senate races. But no matter how many times Bullock says no, I still don‚Äôt quite believe him. I still think there‚Äôs a chance he drops down

There's also a chance that Udall wants her to succeed him, since she used to work for him. Then again, he could always run again

@BenScionti Tbh, Stanton would probably be a good candidate for Governor in 4 years. Executive experience plus a 2-term congressman
@BenScionti Yeah, I think Woods will run too. I was rooting for Stanton, but I have hopped aboard the Woods train now. He will have a great deal of crossover support, and Stanton can hold that House seat for as long as he wants. I think he has a future in AZ Statewide office, but not 2020

@JustCameron__ @BenScionti @Polit_eurOpines Bob Vance ran in 2012 and lost by 4 points (to Roy Moore).

There‚Äôs a somewhat realistic possibility that the Senate will net lose one woman in 2018, but could also net gain 3. A net gain of 0-2 is the most likely outcome. Either way, the Senate is guaranteed to have st least one new woman, since both candidates in AZ are women.

@BenScionti @TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel Yeah, I'm just thinking of different options. Leahy would also be Senate Pro Tem, not like that means much in determining how powerful he is
@BenScionti @TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel Perhaps give Ben Cardin Chairmanship of Foreign Relations and Cantwell the Small Business Committee. That is the last thing she chaired, so she might be fine with doing that again
@BenScionti @TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel Hopefully, but I'm sure Schumer, McConnell, and Murkowski have probably though of all of these things.
@TossupReport @BenScionti @IAmKrishanPatel Maybe strip Menendez from Foreign Affairs and rework to where Cantwell, Murray, or Leahy Chair that committee. Or at least another committee.
@TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel That‚Äôs true. I feel like she probably wouldn‚Äôt switch parties since she arguably has more control over Republicans. Although, Mitch McConnell might call her on that and lose the majority for for that.
@TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel That might be too big of a concession
@TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel Maybe she would run in both? I could honestly see that
@TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel The only thing is I‚Äôm not sure what she would get out of it if it was a 50-50 Senate.
@TossupReport @IAmKrishanPatel That‚Äôd be the hope
@IAmKrishanPatel You‚Äôre probably right, but I think there might be a small chance. She owes the GOP nothing
What are the chances Murkowski becomes a Dem-caucusing independent if Dems hit a 50-50 Senate or possibly 51-49? I‚Äôm sure Schumer would give her *a lot* of concessions if it meant taking back the Senate.

@JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa He's just a perpetually young-looking guy, I guess
@LikeIGive_Adam @BenScionti I agree. She might could hold it in 2020, but she'd be a gonner during a red-leaning year
@LikeIGive_Adam @BenScionti Great minds think alike
@BenScionti That's a good point. I also think more women, and particularly Latina women in a state like NM is good. Either way, Udall will probably be replaced by a Latinx individual.
@BenScionti Ngl, I came across this fact while trying to figure out a way for Torres Small to run for Senate. I saw he was 70, so he should retire in 2020 so she can run. Although, Balderas would probably go for it, and I like him too
Tom Udall is 70 and I'm shook. I thought he was in his 50s, maybe early 60s. He looks very good for 70.

@joncprevo I‚Äôve been a Torres-Small stan since she first announced. I‚Äôve considered it a tossup

@SenhorRaposa But I‚Äôm probably thinking more stylistically. Jones comes across more moderate than Tester, but ideologically, they are quite similar.
@SenhorRaposa I would say Bredesen is more like Jones. Probably not quite as liberal as Tester, although there‚Äôs probably not too much difference between Tester and Jones. They are both moderate-to liberal.

@BenScionti @jackcurran49 @politicsluo Yeah, I could see Shatz becoming Whip after Durban Leaves, unless Murray wants it. But maybe Van Hollen for that as position? Regardless, I don‚Äôt get the sense Murray wants to be whip

@IAmKrishanPatel @joncprevo By ‚Äúgo racist‚Äù I meant start using racist attacks against Gillum. I didn‚Äôt mean some sudden turn to the dark side
@joncprevo @IAmKrishanPatel I think we all expected him to go racist, but it‚Äôs the mere hours after the primary that is a little surprising
@BenScionti I agree that she would‚Äôve been a stronger GE candidate, but I think any of the Democratic candidates (Even Greene) would‚Äôve still made it a tossup
@IAmKrishanPatel That seems more likely. I still think Gillum has some baggage and he needs to step up his fundraising, but many people on this website are way overreacting about his chances
I never actually liked Graham all that much. She was meh. I actually preferred Gillum and Levine over her. People are overreacting and saying that DeSantis and Scott are both gonna win. I don‚Äôt buy that this will affect this Senate race really
Opinion: #FLGOV would have been tossup with Graham and it‚Äôs still a tossup with Gillum.

@SenhorRaposa @rudnicknoah Do we know why Dunn dropped our?
@NonstopDiatribe @ChazNuttycombe I do too, even though I think he was the best recruit of the cycle.
@SenhorRaposa It‚Äôs bc Jennifer Duffy has a stupid-ass system that she won‚Äôt change a rating until a runoff. That‚Äôs why GA was Solid R until now

@JakobDWebster Maybe its just IL Republicans lol
@JakobDWebster I don't like to give that rating unless its almost impossible for them to win. This cycle, I would say Rauner is the only incumbent "Likely" to lose.
@JustCameron__ @JakobDWebster I agree!
@JustCameron__ @JakobDWebster What do you think it is?
@JakobDWebster I would actually venture to say Tossup, but Lean R would bee a fair rating. Anyone who puts it at Likely or Safe R obviously didn't learn in 2017 not to underestimate him.
@JakobDWebster This is one of the reasons that I cite for him not being DOA in 2020.
@JakobDWebster Not since the election, no. I just think its amazing how popular he is bc he is a Democrat in Alabama.
I think its astounding that Doug Jones (45/28) has essentially the same approval rating as Richard Shelby (48/30).
@IAmKrishanPatel @joncprevo @BrianKempGA take note
@SenhorRaposa This shit gets on my nerves. I can‚Äôt stand when Pelosi is used as an attack for anything other than Congress. I think it‚Äôs a weak attack regardless, but it at least makes sense for the House. This also doesn‚Äôt just apply to Pelosi, but she‚Äôs the subject of the most attacks.

@xenocryptsite @ericmkingsbury The real question remains, "Who is more attractive: John Thune or Martin Heinrich?"
@politicsluo Another interesting possibility: if Mike Espy wins in MS, he would be the most Senior Freshman Senator.
@politicsluo Seniority would go: Synema, Rosen, Bredeson, Romney. If Scott wins, he‚Äôd be above Romney and Bredesen. Cramer would be right behind Synema. Braun would be least senior.
@joncprevo I understand the Cook Likely R rating. Fischer is also not very popular
@IAmKrishanPatel I agree. I think we are individually favored in each of those races.
Yes!! People have been so cautious to not give Democrats the odds to take back the Senate. Every article would say taking back the Senate is a huge long shot but I disagree. Dems will pick up AZ and NV. IN, ND, and TN are the deciding seats, and Dems likely hold the rest. https://t.co/6rZaaS1TMP
RT @politicsluo: The Clone Wars is probably one of the greatest animated TV shows of all time.

@IAmKrishanPatel @JacobKlainberg @politicsluo The Lt. Gov may run. Maybe future-Representative Williams, but I‚Äôd rather her stay in the house for a bit if she wins

@ChazNuttycombe We could also break Republican trifectas in WI, NH, FL, and AZ. Potentially GA, SC, or OK bc of their gubernatorial races. We will also probably gain trifectas in NY and maybe NV. MN is a reach, but we will regain that trifecta if we will the State Senate special election.

@SenhorRaposa It's also stupid that Likely is their safest rating.
@SenhorRaposa That's gotta be a mistake, right? Hawaii might be the single safest Dem governors seat
@SenhorRaposa They could *at most* pick up MN-01 and MN-08. They are virtually guaranteed to pick up PA-14, but that‚Äôs bc Lamb is running in a different district.
@SenhorRaposa This seat is potentially winnable, but a reach. MPN would be a candidate that could put it into play. Joe Cunningham could probably also

@Polit_eur @joncprevo @joshreyes007 I don‚Äôt know too much about him, but he seems like a pretty good candidate
@joncprevo @joshreyes007 That wasn‚Äôt known at the time. Moore was gonna run for gov against her and could‚Äôve beaten her. She saved her own political future while screwing over her party
@joshreyes007 @joncprevo A lot of it was Ivey‚Äôs fault. She moved the Senate election up to a special to bait Roy Moore into running for that instead of gov (and it worked). Although, it may have ended up in 2017 anyway bc having it in Nov 18 was potentially unconstitutional.
@JustCameron__ @joshreyes007 @joncprevo He‚Äôs the former Senate Minority Leader who has been representing a red district. He also just has a compelling personal story
@joshreyes007 @joncprevo Hard to say. I think Abbot simply bc I think Kay Ivey will make a bunch of missteps. Probably not enough to lose, but she‚Äôs pretty bad.
@JustCameron__ @joshreyes007 @joncprevo Abbot is super popular and Valdez is a bad candidate. Sutton is the best candidate we‚Äôve had for gov in SD in decades, and it‚Äôs an open seat. I‚Äôm not the only one that thinks that either: Sabato rates SD as Likely
@joncprevo @joshreyes007 I think Billie Sutton has a better chance than Valdez. I‚Äôd say SD-Likely R, TX-Safe R
@joshreyes007 @joncprevo Ftr, I believe it is Safe R. I consider SD Likely R, but I understand it being rated as Safe.

@tehoriman @Redistrict @CookPolitical House ratings only go to Likely for Cook. PA-05 is super safe, but it‚Äôs just rated as Likely. I think it‚Äôs honestly an attempt to not have to add a Solid R/D column

@joncprevo I don‚Äôt think Beto is a bad candidate. Valdez is; *hopefully* she can turn out Latinos for future races, but that‚Äôs probably not gonna happen

@postsbybrandon @joncprevo @JustCameron__ @SenhorRaposa I know who Heather Wilson was, but even she couldn‚Äôt win in this district anymore. In 2006, the PVI was R+1 iirc. Now it‚Äôs D+7 and the environment is about D+7. There‚Äôs no way Rs are only down 4 under those conditions
@postsbybrandon @joncprevo @JustCameron__ @SenhorRaposa Maybe I'm being to bullish, but I would certainly like to see more polling of this race. @MonmouthPoll *cough cough*
@joncprevo @postsbybrandon @JustCameron__ @SenhorRaposa I never saw that poll, but I've also never heard of that pollster and they do not have a 538 rating. The same poll shows Deb Halaand up only 4 in a D+7 district. I'm overall pretty skeptical of this poll, but thank you for bringing it to my attention

@JustCameron__ @SenhorRaposa Then yeah, it‚Äôs a tossup. I‚Äôm surprised most forecasters still have it at Lean R
@JustCameron__ @SenhorRaposa Yeah, but Lean D in a no tossup map

@andrew_striedl @SenhorRaposa She‚Äôs also been out-raising him for months, and it‚Äôs another Texas GOP district that swung towards HRC with a somewhat unprepared incumbent. I think Likely R is a fair rating, it I don‚Äôt expect it to get any more competitive.
Apparently, her logic is that she can‚Äôt decide if GA should be Lean R or Likely R, so until the runoff it stays as Solid. That‚Äôs what happened with SC (now Likely R), and I imagine it‚Äôs similar logic with OK. Nonsensical to me, but at least there‚Äôs a method to the madness.
CC: @jennifereduffy What‚Äôs up with these ratings?
Cook changed #SCGOV to Likely R. I would agree with that rating at this point. I still don‚Äôt understand why they have #GAGOV and #OKGOV at Solid R. I‚Äôd rate them as Tossup and Lean R, respectively. Their GA rating is really angering me though.

@joncprevo Probably, but an independent poll just showed him up 1 and Kemp released an internal where they were tied. But, I‚Äôm clearly more reliant on the independent one
Prediction: If Brian Kemp wins the #GAGOV runoff, most forecasters will upgrade the race to tossup, but Cook will move it from Solid R to Likely. If Casey Cagle wins, most will keep it at Lean R and Cook will inexplicably keep it at Solid R.
