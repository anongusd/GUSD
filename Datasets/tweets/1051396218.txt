A good foreign intel officer could own Kushner in months. His financial vulnerabilities, greed, situational ignorance, dubious foreign contacts, ethical disregard, self-importance and dismissal by more seasoned officials make it too easy. That‚Äôs why he shouldn‚Äôt have a clearance.
As troubling as Jared Kushner‚Äôs in-law security clearance is, the more fundamental problem is the nepotism that brought him to the White House in the first place. Once our government becomes a ruling family affair, all standards, safeguards and protocols go right out the window.

It's disappointing that none of Utah's three Republican representatives voted to uphold the separation of powers today. In Utah, we have a tradition of honoring the Constitution and allowing a lawless president to declare a false emergency to bypass Congress is a clear violation.

That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important that we not let his words or actions convince us to disregard the value and integrity of our elections. Free and fair elections are based in our humanity - in our equality - and the single most important mechanism by which free people stay free.
If this apathy progresses, it can metastasize into widespread ambivalence about all of our democratic processes, an erosion of our leaders‚Äô and institutions‚Äô perceived legitimacy, and further violations of our voting and other rights.
Lastly, they hope to inspire a lack of confidence in elections among, in this case, all Americans, so that we develop sense of apathy about voting and electoral outcomes all together.
Secondly, such leaders hope to convince their supporters of the need for unusual infringements on their opponents‚Äô rights (usually in the name of ‚Äúelection integrity,‚Äù ironically) that they may pursue in order to suppress opposition voting.
At the most basic and instinctual level, they hope to erode their supporters‚Äô confidence in the integrity of elections so that they distrust unfavorable results and evidence of the leaders‚Äô unpopularity, an early step towards quashing dissent more generally.
Rather than sustain our elections, our president works to undermine the process by which we ensure that leaders remain accountable to us. It‚Äôs important to understand clearly some of the reasons that anti-democratic figures like him regularly employ this tactic:
The nationwide protests against the president‚Äôs unconstitutional installation of a loyalist to lead the Department of Justice and its investigations should be cross-partisan. Americans of ALL political affiliations should stand together to protect the rule of law.

The Saudis never would have dreamt of committing such a heinous crime against a journalist with an American publication under prior U.S. administrations. Trump‚Äôs dehumanizing, violent rhetoric against the press has signaled to despots an open season for such abuses.

What message do we send to women, survivors and all Americans about their worth when we one day hear the credible testimony of a claimed victim and the very next day, without further effort to learn the truth, vote to place her alleged attacker on the highest court in the land?
Consideration of Judge Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation has become dangerously polarized and I‚Äôm concerned that it will further our divisions. The only possible remedy is the discovery and review of more information. This rush to vote is unnecessary and does not serve the nation well.
Ford accusation aside, what gives me pause about Kavanaugh‚Äôs credibility are his:		-Repeated misrepresentations of witness statements.	-Refusal to acknowledge his heavy drinking despite indications of it. 	-Unlikely portrayal of ‚ÄúRenate Alumni.‚Äù	-Calendar entry on 1 July 1982.
Kavanaugh‚Äôs 1982 calendar details a July 1st drinking gathering at a friend‚Äôs house with two people who Dr. Ford alleges were at the gathering she attended. This was hardly addressed today and is all the more reason to do more investigating before a vote. https://t.co/WSbCTu89a2
Ford proved to be credible today and her testimony should be taken seriously, while Kavanaugh deserves to have his name cleared if he is wrongly accused. With the integrity of the Supreme Court at stake, the committee should conduct a thorough investigation before it votes.
Our representatives in Congress should be capable of speaking with women, victims, or any other American themselves. Could there be a more basic expectation for their service?

This is the coarseness and indecency of the modern GOP. Its roots are decades old in parts of its base, but they‚Äôve spread to others under Trump‚Äôs leadership.

This notion that Dan Coats has somehow ‚Äúgone rogue‚Äù or that he was disloyal to the president because he spoke truth to the American people about Moscow‚Äôs ongoing attacks tells you everything you need to know about the fundamentally disloyal nature of Trumpism itself.
Meanwhile, millions of Republicans and others who trust their leaders took queues from Trump‚Äôs Putin allegiance and GOP leaders‚Äô silence. Now, we find ourselves in a situation in which our political will to defend ourselves from a serious national security challenge is tenuous.
The formerly bright stars of the party, including Paul Ryan and others, saw the basic contours of the threat early, but for years have thrown up their hands saying, ‚ÄúWhat can I do? I‚Äôm just a policy guy doing my job,‚Äù as though they were mutes and had made no oath to the nation.
How could so many Americans fail to oppose a clear risk to their own liberty? Well, candidate now president Trump has been in full, public embrace of Putin for three years and the vast majority of elected Republicans have, with few exceptions, been entirely silent on the matter.
Only 55% of U.S. voters now disapprove of Trump's handling of Russia while 71% of Republicans approve. This is why he is doubling down with a Putin visit to Washington and why we cannot just assume that Americans will oppose threats to their own freedom. https://t.co/QjI2Vwqbs6

Many of us have said so for years and we will do so again: Trump is dangerously unfit for his office. He is not a loyal American and he should be relieved of his duties expeditiously.
This is neither na√Øvet√© nor ignorance. This is a president who is using the communication powers of his office to aid and abet a foreign adversary‚Äôs hostility against the nation. https://t.co/aIeIIBqVwE
Trump seeks to normalize his disloyal Putin relationship with the trappings of diplomacy and by using security issues such as nonproliferation and counterterrorism to create an exaggerated imperative for unusual American-Russian partnership despite Moscow's ongoing attacks.
Ours is a government in which the people ultimately determine our national security posture. When Trump calls the Russia investigation a ‚Äúwitch hunt,‚Äù he is literally assisting Moscow‚Äôs ongoing attacks by misleading the American people and thwarting an appropriate response. https://t.co/bDWWlqEBjF

Has Republican partisanship become so extreme, so venal that it now overpowers even the basic instinct to protect one's own liberty from foreign and domestic threats against it?
All law enforcement investigations require informants and/or court-approved collection of electronic communications and other evidence. Trump and his allies deceive the American people when claiming that these methods are unusual or inappropriate in this case. They are not.
When the @FBI investigates a campaign whose own advisor bragged about having private talks with a foreign adversary regarding its attacks on our democracy, it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do to protect the nation. There's nothing political or inappropriate about it.
These members of Congress are the broken toys of the House Republican Conference, more extreme and committed to a lawless president than they are to their constitutional duties.

The Republican caucus that returns to the House after 2018 will be smaller, more loyal to Trump, and even less willing to contribute to good governance. In a two-party system like ours, that's a loss for the country, not just for responsible Republicans.
Paul Ryan was the hope of the GOP, but he wilted when his leadership was needed most. Instead of checking Trump, he helped normalize him. Now, metastasized Trumpism in the base and broad American opposition to it are forcing him out. Other leaders should learn from this.
All Americans on the left, right, and center who care about accountable government, national sovereignty, and liberty in America should prepare to participate in a robust civic response across the country if President Trump removes Mueller, Rosenstein, or Sessions.
If the President fires Mueller, it will be an obvious, direct attack on the Russia investigation. If he fires Sessions or Rosenstein, he will do so to constrain and influence the investigation for the same purpose, but while attempting to avoid the same public backlash.

Oversight of a pivotal investigation is important and few professionals, processes, or organizations are perfect, but an 'investigation of the investigation' to impede the special counsel has long been on Trump's wish list. This appears to be a realization of that goal.
We heard Trump's allies in the House make their best arguments against the FISA warrant on Carter Page, a known Russian intel associate. Those arguments, including those in the Nunes memo, were quickly debunked. Now, we're to believe that they justify a legitimate investigation?
There is still no reason to believe that the FISA application for Carter Page was improper. Even the DOJ IG acknowledges that its new probe is a response to pressure from Trump's congressional allies, who like him, seek to undermine the Russia investigation through various means.

We would be fools to simply hope that more Republican leaders would somehow summon that courage now. We must make them understand that they will pay an electoral price for their cowardice and self-interest if they fail to defend the the special counsel investigation now.
When it gets to that point, many Republican politicians are too afraid of Trump‚Äôs base to defend our ideals, norms, and institutions. And this is how his nationalist, populist rhetoric was able to reach a fever pitch in 2015 and 2016. Few in the GOP were willing to take a stand.
This is Trump‚Äôs modus operandi. He attacks a person or a group of people, often leveraging extreme partisanship or fear, until his base is ready to let him go further or demands that he does, which is his desire from the beginning.
When Trump maligns Mueller, he‚Äôs not only testing the water for removing him, he‚Äôs building support for it in his base, making it more difficult for Republicans in Congress to oppose it. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important that we and they speak loudly against Trump‚Äôs attacks now.

To whom does the GOP belong? Are we okay with allowing the party of Lincoln, Reagan, and other noble leaders to become a trojan vessel for a hostile foreign power? If we fail to oppose this at every turn, we too are to blame for its consequences.

I share the sentiment and wish it were a sudden development as we could then hope for its sudden reversal. But the truth is that the current state of the GOP has been a long time in the making.

Many hope Trump's white nationalism is a passing GOP anomaly, but when @CPAC invites Marion Le Pen - a leader of Europe's pro-Russia, anti-Semitic, nationalist movement - to speak after Pence, it's a sign that Trumpism is the party's new strategic direction, not a 24-hour flu.
Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump claimed 2016 elections were rigged, received Kremlin support, opposed critical sanctions on Moscow, and now attempt sow doubt over U.S. intel and law enforcement findings on Putin‚Äôs interference.

There are reasons why President Trump refuses to make obvious criticisms of Vladimir Putin, why he won't implement sanctions needed to deter Russian espionage, why he attacks the FBI when its investigation yields overwhelming evidence of Moscow's aggression. There are reasons.

With a Trump-led executive branch unwilling to effectively counter Kremlin attacks, what social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram do will be all the more important. Otherwise, the responsibility will fall more fully to the press and civil society groups.

It‚Äôs time to acknowledge plainly that Trump likely doesn‚Äôt want to stop Moscow‚Äôs interference. Foreign leaders backed by Putin rarely reject his support. After Trump encouraged the Kremlin in 2016 and has refused to deter it since, we‚Äôd be naive to expect any different from him.

I know and respect some of the House Republicans on the Intel Committee, which is why it‚Äôs so disappointing that they would intentionally mislead the public on a national security matter while aiding the president‚Äôs ongoing purge of senior law enforcement leaders.
In releasing their memo and blocking the minority‚Äôs response, House Republicans exploited the fact that the portions of the FISA application they wished to criticize were unclassified while those adding important context were not and, therefore, hard to release to the public.

Due to his concerns about American national security, Cristopher Steele volunteered the dossier information to the FBI with which he never had a formal relationship to research Trump/Russia matters.
The inclusion of the dossier in FISA applications may represent an unprecedented collision of opposition research and national security, but remember: the cause of that was a presidential candidate‚Äôs likely collaboration with the very foreign adversary attacking our democracy.

If the FISA applications failed to mention who funded Chris Steele‚Äôs research, perhaps they should have. Regardless, it would‚Äôve been careless of law enforcement to have excluded such alarming national security information from such a trusted source and ally of the United States.
It‚Äôs no surprise that the Nunes memo fails to acknowledge other evidence - in addition to the dossier - contained in the FISA applications for surveillance of Carter Page, the least of which would‚Äôve been evidence of his collaboration with Russian intel even before the campaign.

Mounting pressure from multiple investigations and damaging revelations seem to have forced Trump and his allies into a new posture of overt obstruction &amp; collaboration with Moscow. Unambiguous corruption is the worst. The concerned become desensitized and the desensitized numb.

If conservatism doesn‚Äôt mean preserving liberty, equality and the norms and institutions built upon them, then what of good value does it mean?
There‚Äôs a tendency among GOP leaders and some (not all) intellectuals to simply ignore Trump‚Äôs assault on essential norms and institutions, especially as long as he also advances a traditional agenda. But they also ignored or failed to identify the now ascendant far right.
.@SpeakerRyan correctly urged Congress to better fulfill its Constitutional oversight responsibilities for years. That‚Äôs why his use of the word ‚Äúoversight‚Äù now to describe Congressional collaboration with the president against the rule of law is so deceptive and harmful.
I‚Äôll join @BrookeBCNN on @CNN at around 3:30pm ET!
In 2016, I feared that GOP leaders would eventually adopt Trump‚Äôs blatant racism, nativism, and xenophobia, but even I never imagined that they‚Äôd mimic his use of conspiratorial disinformation as well. When you abandon principle and truth, even the darkest depth is possible.

The Republicans on the House Intel Committee are The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight. They craft a misleading memo to help the president obstruct justice and then they botch their own scam by secretly altering the version THEY voted to release. What a disgrace. https://t.co/2dynjAFn9F
How ironic it is that while the president demands the illicit loyalty of law enforcement leaders, he casts those who maintain their independence as unlawfully biased. He's a man without honor who would have us believe the same of everyone.
.@mindyfinn's insightful assessment of Trump's SOTU address: "Last night‚Äôs speech was not functionally different from others he‚Äôs given...Nationalism and populism with a sprinkling of aspirational rhetoric is still, at its heart, nationalism and populism." https://t.co/9h5qPUxgDh
President Trump has a purpose when he asks law enforcement officials who they voted for, if they're "on his team," or to pledge their loyalty to him: to subtly compromise their integrity and commitment to the rule of law in his favor.
As Trump fires and pushes out officials doing their duty to uphold the law, there's increasing talk among his allies in Congress of "cleansing" or "purging" law enforcement leadership. All over the world, deeply corrupt leaders do this to avoid being exposed and held accountable.
When @SpeakerRyan uses words like "accountability and transparency" to ascribe value to the @DevinNunes memo scam, he's using his office to mislead the American people and abet a cynical ploy to undermine the rule of law and our institutions. https://t.co/cLNW2PZUXn

@LaurieM07 I agree that gerrymandering and voter suppression is a problem.
Agreed. There are more reasons to optimistic than pessimistic.

Finally, Trump suggests that the Justice Department has no independence and, by extension, that he is above the law. I believe these statements foretell the kinds of actions Trump may be willing to take if Mueller‚Äôs investigation gets close enough to the Oval Office. https://t.co/yvHGmVBx1F
The President is attempting to break down the rule of law as a widely accepted American norm, even going a step further to normalize the dangerous counter-norm that the president and the Executive Branch are above the law.
Trump appears to believe that it‚Äôs the Attorney General‚Äôs responsibility to protect the president from being held accountable under the law, likely setting another pretext for removing sessions if Mueller‚Äôs investigation gets too close to Trump and his family. https://t.co/Dy4oUdRr6P
Further, Trump suggests that if Mueller treats him ‚Äúfairly,‚Äù the investigation will show that there was no collusion, possibly setting a pretext for removing Mueller if his probe reveals additional evidence to the contrary. Trump will say Mueller is no longer being ‚Äúfair.‚Äù https://t.co/4zGkvLK5bd

@AndyGlockner We must hold them accountable in elections.
@TheUnitedWhirld We do. It‚Äôs up to us.
It is the Article I, Constitutional responsibility of members of Congress to ensure Executive Branch accountability. Members who fail to fulfill this duty - or worse, actually work against it - do not serve the people‚Äôs interest and should be replaced.
I remember when House Republicans were essentially all advocates for accountable government and strong supporters of U.S. law enforcement. Now, many of them attack the latter in order to undermine the former.

If our Department of Justice and its FBI lose their ability to act independently of the President to hold him, his family and his team accountable under the law, Trump will have a much freer hand to violate the law in the protection of his own power at the expense of our liberty.
In many cases, this is accomplished by firing senior law enforcement officials en masse. Our norms make that difficult. So instead, Trump and his allies are working overtime to set the pretext for targeted firings, demotions, and forced retirements to accomplish the same thing.
However, authoritarian leaders all over the world always try to bring national security services under their complete control because they know that organizations like the FBI are most likely to threaten their power by exposing their corruption and treachery.
Most Americans have never witnessed such a tactic because most of our presidents have acted in good faith in this regard, allowing the Department of Justice and the FBI relative independence to uphold the law.
The President, along with his pundit and Congressional loyalists, is trying to politicize the FBI in order to diminish its ability to hold him, his family, and his team accountable for potential criminal activities. https://t.co/Rrc2yXPfc4

@Sartor1836 I would prefer that conservatism describe the defense of founding principles, but Trumpism is appropriating the word to itself. In the end, what matters more than anything else is our commitment to our principles even if we end up having to use new words to describe it.
@Sartor1836 We will go on telling people what we think conservatism is, but we may lose the battle for that word simply because there are more of them than there are of us. The most broadly understood meaning of the word will be driven by the definition that the majority ascribe to it.

@Ktrotter80 Then, you should be calling him twice as much. Trump's loyalists in the House are the ones who are most important to call.
The Mueller investigation is absolutely critical to the protection of liberty in America. The president and his loyalists in Congress must understand that if Mueller is fired, there will be a massive public backlash in the near-term and in 2018. We will hold them all accountable.
Friends, the president and his far-right supporters in Congress are laying the groundwork to fire Mueller, especially as his investigation encircles the Trump family. This is not a drill. Please call your reps in Congress today and urge them to protect Mueller with legislation.

@THOMASBMALONE It's not that he would testify as an expert, but that he may have been able to observe important details that others may not have noticed due to his professional skillset. He can testify to these details as a witness.
@MuthrBear I can't say for sure. But I know Mueller and the FBI will know quickly (actually they appear to have already made this determination) if Flynn is truly, fully cooperating.
@DarylynnM Because people sometimes get their heads turned. Greed, ego, jealousy, misplaced ambition...they're powerful forces that can make people who should know better do stupid, harmful things. Being the target of a Mueller investigation, however, is enough to wake such a person up!
If Flynn is fully cooperating as he committed to doing, he's reporting these observations. Mueller and the FBI share Flynn's expertise and will know if he's just going through the motions as a witness or leveraging his intel skills to report important, even if subtle, details.
Flynn isn't only valuable as a witness for his prior access to Trump, but also because he's a former intel officer with the knowledge necessary to have made expert observations about Moscow's interference, its gradual compromise of Team Trump, and any collaboration between them.

I believe part of it is a new generation of leaders and a new era of civic engagement, which I see developing and which gives me hope.
These ongoing failures to solve major problems in America show just how urgently something fundamental needs to change in American politics.
I hope Congress can resolve the Dreamer situation, if not pass broader immigration reform, but past failures don't allow much optimism.
Meanwhile, our economy suffers with outdated, unenforced laws and Dreamers are vulnerable to the cruel whims of anti-immigration populism.
But even then, there are internal GOP divisions about what immigration policy in America should be and they remain a barrier to a solution.
Democrats could help by allowing actual border security (not the wall) to be part of the package.
But they've failed for years to pass immigration reform because the party is divided on what the policy should be and how it should happen.
Fixing this is Congress's job. With both chambers, Congressional Republicans have the most power to do so. https://t.co/YEvweflMvg

Punishing people for their parents' violations undermines our nation of laws and serves only injustice.
Now they're stuck between a base they've exploited and failed to lead on one hand, and common sense governance on the other.
So why do it? Because the President and other leaders failed to oppose, or even themselves stoked, anti-immigration sentiment into a mania.
This threat to Dreamers is terrible governance, absolutely devoid of compassion, and politically boneheaded. It's a total loser.
@K___Garner @DUGSimpson I appreciate that. The present realities are painfully clear to me and have been for a long time. That should be apparent by now.
@K___Garner @DUGSimpson If you want to win elections again, better to build bridges with those who share core principles than to impugn their commitment to them.
@K___Garner @DUGSimpson Do you think that's news to me or other conservatives opposed to that development?
@DUGSimpson @K___Garner I disagree with the notion that liberty, equality, and self-rule are fundamentally left-wing ideas. They were founding GOP principles.
@DUGSimpson @K___Garner The caricature fits only because so many "conservatives" have abandoned the principles on which the GOP was founded.
@DUGSimpson @K___Garner When practiced, yes. Lincoln was an example. GOP has been adrift more recently. Is that your point? Should be obvious that I'm aware.
@K___Garner Seems pointless to bicker over labels if you agree on principles, and I'm already well versed in the progressive caricature of conservatism.

The trend here suggests that Trump's pro-Russia rhetoric and the silence of most GOP leaders is having an impact. Leadership matters.

The longer President Trump is in office, the more closely most Americans will associate his never-ending madness with the Republican Party.
Incredibly, some Americans now see no harm in collaborating with a foreign power to influence our elections. Trump promotes that falsehood.
In the President's analogy, the Democratic Party was to Clinton what the Russian Government is to him. He's not wrong. https://t.co/dV9qp5NzRO

If Moscow's goal is to keep us divided and therefore unable to protect ourselves, shouldn't our goal be to unify in our own defense?
What weighs on me most heavily is how patently unprepared many of our leaders are, out of partisanship and ignorance, to protect the nation.
It's always a challenge, but we tend to evaluate future threats based on past attacks. 9/11 was another example. This leaves us vulnerable. https://t.co/E4fWMwCEaj

@justingough Yes. This summer!
But as I've said elsewhere, I am now focused on defending democratic ideals, norms, and institutions in America. That's my focus.
@evepeyser I support a system that covers preexisting &amp; other vulnerable people, and an improved free market system for those with means.
@evepeyser shouldn't be secret, especially not on an issue like healthcare.
We don't have to agree on every issue to cooperate in the defense of democratic ideals, norms, and institutions. The extremes disagree.
There's opposition from the far left and far right to Americans finding and defending common ground in defense of democracy. https://t.co/5qTaGeIVdE
Amazing how some Republican leaders sanctimoniously condemned President Obama's Russia reset only to embrace Trump's Russia surrender now.
