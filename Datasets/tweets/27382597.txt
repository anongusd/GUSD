In this great land of ours, anybody can run for president.  ANYBODY!!! Elizabeth Warren is living proof of that.
This woman (Sen Warren) is giving class warfare a bad name!
Sen Warren says she won't take money from millionaires to set up PACs on her behalf.  Nothing to worry about Liz.
Maybe I'm being too harsh about Elizabeth Warren's dark dark speech.  As an American Indian she probably experienced a lot of discrimination so maybe she has a right to be so down on America
Listening to this Elizabeth Warren nihilistic claptrap, if I were of a certain mind, I'd jump off the roof of the Empire State Building.
Here's the good news about Elizabeth Warren:  Even Democrats have more sense than to nominate her.  If they do, even Never Trumpers would vote for Trump.
I'm listening to Sen. Warren's speech -- the darkest nonsense I've ever heard.  They blasted Trump for his Inaugural speech.  They said it was dark and negative.  Trump is Rebeca of Sunnybrook Farm compared to this woman.  Beyond depressing!!!

Journalists are not expert enough to know what actually motivates him to say so many things that just aren‚Äôt true. https://t.co/WdEZKTryXo
Maybe Trump is wired in such a way that he believes all sorts of things that reasonable people don‚Äôt believe. Telling a lie involves motive.
This is about journalists applying the same standard to people they like as to people they don‚Äôt like. How‚Äôs that for a novel idea?

So the more Hispanics and Asians and African Americans who join America‚Äôs newsrooms, the more liberal those newsrooms would become.

No knockouts.  Trump got good start.  Hillary was stronger after that.  Not a great night for Donald.  #debatenight
Who won?  #debatenight
As I say:  Donald Trump can run but he can't hide from his past.  What worked to win the nomination, is his biggest obstacle now.  #debates
I thought there'd be a memorable MOMENT tonight.   I thought wrong.	#debatenight
Trump started strong.  But he can't run from his past -- Birther, Tax Returns ... #debatenight
This better end soon.  Trump starting to lose focus.  #debates
Donald protesteth too much about his support or lack of re Iraq.  #debatenight
Birther issue a loser for Trump.  #debatenight
Hillary hinting that we're a nation of racists.  Didn't say so in so many words.  But came close.  #debatenight
Libs have been painting a bleak picture of black neighborhoods for decades.  Now, HRC bashes DJT for painting the same picture.  #debates
Hillary hits Trump on tax return.  Asks, what's he hiding?  This is a weak spot for DJT.  #debatenight
Recurring Hillary theme:  The rich are bad.  	Hardly original.  Feels old. Presidential elections are about the future. #debatenight
Memo to Trump:  Let her talk.  Don't interrupt.  She's not helping herself. #debatenight
Prediction:  Before this is over, it'll make professional wrestling look like ping pong.  Can't wait.  #debatenight
FOOD FIGHT.  That's why we're here.
Trump sounds like he knows what he's talking about.  He sounds like he understands business.  She doesn't.  Trump in lead. #debatenight
Trump needs to be careful.  He's coming off as strong.  That's good.  Can't make HRC look like a victim.  #debatenight
Trump message on jobs could resonate where it counts:  Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania.  #debatenight
HRC can't stop the class warfare routine. Pitting everyone against the wealthy?  Going back to Bush meltdown.  Feels stale. #debatenight
Hillary is channeling Bernie Sanders.  Targeting the wealthy.  Tired, old line.  Will waging class warfare work? #debatenight

Time to end this show.  I'm losing interest.  GOP should have held it in a Red State. Audience would have cheered more. #GOPDebate
Not sure Kasich's compassionate conservatism is the key to victory this time around. #GOPDebate
Carly is tough ... makes Hillary look like a Brownie -- if Brownies wore pant suits. #GOPDebate
If this debate were in South Carolina or Idaho or some other Red State, there'd be a lot more applause for Trump. Just saying' #GOPDebate
Rand Paul is talking himself out of the race.  Doesn't want to build up the military.  That may work in a Dem debate, not w GOP. #GOPDebate
Not sure who's winning this debate but Rubio is right up there. 	#GOPDebate
Big question:  Will people who want "free" stuff, take these serious GOPcandidates seriously? #GOPDebate
Forgive me for repeating myself.  While these candidates are good, Christie would be in the lead if he were  on stage right now #GOPDebate
Have u noticed?  The moderators are good. The questions are solid.  The debate isn't a 3 ring circus ... like the one on CNBC. #GOPDebate
Cruz:  If the Republicans are the party of amnesty, we ... will ... lose.  Met by silence.  Maybe that's b/c it's Milwaukee. #GOPDebate
Rubio is smart.  And does the show biz of politics well.  He's impressive.  And like Reagan, optimistic.	#GOPDebate

Republicans don‚Äôt have a problem with black people running for president ‚Äì unless they‚Äôre liberal black people running for president.
If #Republicans are a bunch of racists, why is Ben Carson at or near the top of just about every poll? https://t.co/Kl5FMhqXyp

Jeb Bush is right ... name-calling doesn't help the GOP.  Not sure Trump understands or cares. #GOPDebate
This "killing babies" talk may work with Republicans ... won't play with the wider electorate.  #GOPDebate
Strong answer from Huckabee on the Iran deal.  Who do you like so far? #GOPDebate
Too bad Donald is so shy. #GOPDebate

I like Carly.  You? #GOPDebate
Perry sounds good.  Agree? #GOPDebate
Not sure Graham understands that the American people are tired of war. Hard see to send troops back to Iraq. Very hard sell. #GOPDebate
America is moving left on social issues.  That's a fact.  Ck Gallup. So social issues don't help GOP.  Sorry, but true. #GOPDebate
Fiorina would run rings around HRC in ANY debate. I know, I know -- it's not going to happen. #GOPDebate

This isn't a debate.  It's a news conference on national TV.  Still waiting for someone to break thru. #GOPDebate
something wrong when good answers not enuf to connect w American people. Again: every 1 of these candidates is better than HRC. #GOPDebate
Good answers won't be enuf to move up in the polls. We live in the U.S of Entertainment and so far it's all too ordinary #GOPDebate
Go Carly! I ask again, VP?  #GOPDebate
If Perry had a Boston accent instead of a Texas accent even the NYT might like him. #GOPDebate
@rmordekai @CarlyFiorina I agree
Gilmore is way underrated.  Too bad even most GOP voters don't know who he is. #GOPDebate
I'd take almost anyone one of these people over EVERY Democrat who's running.  #GOPDebate
Too bad Sen Graham isn't going anywhere.  Smart.  Decent.  #GOPDebate
Here's something you're not supposed to say:  Some people look presidential, dress presidential -- and some don't.  Agree? #GOPDebate
@KelleyTori Good point
Someone is going to have to say something out of the ordinary -- or else he or she won't break thru the clutter. #GOPDebate
Full disclosure:  I like Carly Florina.  Too bad she hasn't caught on.  VP? #GOPDebate

Why is it that whenever I write about gays, guns, or God I get the most comments?  http://t.co/ufWbVxkR6A
The #GOP candidates should look at the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision not as a setback, but as a gift, a kind of get out of jail free card.
Moving on makes political sense. All the #GOP candidates need to say is that the Court has spoken. The case of gay marriage is now settled.
The Constitution is not the Bible. Conservatives, Christian or otherwise, don‚Äôt have to like the decision. http://t.co/pX5DudjaFV
It‚Äôs a shame that a #Republican can‚Äôt come out in favor of same-sex marriage and have any hope of winning his party‚Äôs nomination.
No, race is not gender. But, when it comes to constitutional rights, they amount to a distinction w/o much of a difference.
That‚Äôs what the Republican candidates for president should do: Accept the decision and move on. http://t.co/pX5DudjaFV

About to be on @megynkelly show. Tune in now.
What happened in Paris was an attack on every news organization in every country everywhere in the world where ppl believe in a free press.
Now the press and television  have an opportunity to show courage: Publish the French cartoons. http://t.co/6vC2MpnWIA
Radical Muslims Attack Paris ‚Äî and Freedom Everywhere http://t.co/6vC2MpnWIA Charlie Hebdo #ParisShooting
I'll be on w Megyn Kelly at 9p et on the French massacre ‚Ä¶ and the choice American journalists now have to face.  http://t.co/6vC2MpnWIA
Every newspaper in the USA and around the world should publish the French cartoons.  Every TV network should show them.  Don't let fear win
Everyone knows ‚Äì especially journalists ‚Äì that it was an attack on American values and democratic values everywhere. http://t.co/cUJi2Rld8W
Please check this one out, my take on Paris and how journalists have caved to Islamic crazies in the past. http://t.co/6vC2MpnWIA
Kerry speaks about Paris attack. Won't use the word Islam -- even though that's what motivated the terrorists. Pathetic!
It happened in Paris but Muslims terrorists attacked America and the entire free world today.  http://t.co/6vC2MpnWIA  RT please!
the attack was in Paris ‚Ä¶ but it was an attack on every newsroom in every free country everywhere in the world.  more to come

#GOP Wins in a Wave‚Ä¶ What Does it Mean? http://t.co/LWXQPWTasX #tcot
Americans were voting against Obama ‚Äì maybe more than they were voting for Republicans. http://t.co/DzK82baNml
The bad news is this kind of cold-blooded cynicism has worked for Democrats in the past. The good news is it did not work this time around.
We all know that politics isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart, that things can get nasty. Especially when you‚Äôre desperate. http://t.co/LWXQPWTasX

One more GOP win and I will unleash my brilliant analysis (column) on you ... with many thanks for following me tonight
GOP win in Georgia was a hold for the party.  NOT a pickup.
NEW COLUMN coming tonight.  What time?  When we know more about NC, KS, Iowa and VA.  stay w me.  you can sleep late tomorrow
FOX projects GOP win in Georgia.  That's huge.  No runoff.  GOP pick up NET 6 seats and counting. And control of the Senate
So you tell me:  What do the results mean SO FAR?
Status report at 1030pm ET:  NC too close to call.  Virginia too close to call. Pending:  Georgia, Kansas, Iowa, Alaska
FOX called Colorado for GOP a long time ago ...
BIG ONE:  CNN calls Colorado for Republican Cory Gardner.  More to come.
Let's review my friends: still out ... VA, NC, GA, KS, Iowa, Alaska.
It's late and NC is still too close to call.  Keep an eye on this one ... Republican Tillis leading.
We're down to 3 ... Iowa, Kansas and Alaska.  If the GOP picks up just one ... it's over.
Montana goes GOP  ... 5 down and 1 to go.
Colorado goes Republican ... 4 down and 2 to go for the GOP.
