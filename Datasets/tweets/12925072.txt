Scratch our last post. To avoid duplication issues, photos sent in while mobile posting was down for maintenance today should be resent
Mobile posting is back up
Mobile posting temporarily disabled to fix some issues
Also photos sent by phone while mobile posting was disabled will need to be re-sent, we did not capture those photos
Mobile posting is back up, very sorry to those who got duplicate posts from us...will a hug help?
Daaaang...we made a mess didn't we =) So sorry...

@mackney DM me which photos are not embedding for you
Guess what we're still doing? Syncing photos, almost done *queue elevator music*
Still syncing old photos over to the new servers, taking longer than expected. This is why some photos still aren't displaying
Just published a blog post explaining what happened Sunday http://bit.ly/3PAb31
Have I told you guys lately that you're beautiful? Well you are :)
Could you please retweet that last tweet? We have many Sprint users and want them to be notified of this update. Thank you! Here's a cookie
Fixed an issue where photos sent by Sprint users were not being posted
We are still syncing photos over, so some photos still may not display, taking longer due to today's load, but we made it through just fine!
I'd appreciate it greatly if you could retweet and get the word out that we are back up & stable, you guys were great through this thank you
Mobile posting is coming back online, photos that you tried posting yesterday may starting showing up
Some of your older photos may not display as we are still syncing some of the data between servers, this is temporary
Ok everyone, Twitpic is on its new server and looks to be running as normal also we are still syncing some photos so some may not be showing
Also thank you everyone for your support, once we get through this I'll write blog post explaining the entire situation, you guys rock
I'm hoping to have the site back up on a new server in 2-3 hours ETA
The spotty uptime is not due to excessive traffic, but an elusive hardware failure, working to move it over
We are having spotty up time, bringing in some extra help to get this fixed ASAP
UPDATE: still working to fix Twitpic's slowness right now, think it may be due to a bad hardware upgrade last night, will keep you posted
Really sorry about the down time folks, I'm trying to sort out the issue now

Our data center told us that our rack's power unit had blown. They have replaced it and everything is running normal again.
We are back up, very sorry for that everyone. Talking with our data center to find out what happened.
Our data center is having some connectivity issues, we are working with them now to get this fixed
We've redone the "Upload Photo" page to fix issues with those not able to upload from the site itself. Email us if you still have issues
We are still getting slammed by digg.com
Twitpic is running a little slow this morning due to a photo making the front page of http://digg.com today
An issue where some photo updates by phone that were making it to Twitpic, but not to twitter should be fixed now
Twitpic runs a bajillion percent better now and is also good for your health (may cause sudden fits of joy resulting in wetting yourself)
All photos have now been moved over to the new servers
@JediWright we post the photos as soon as we receive them from your mobile carrier, no delays since we moved to the new servers
Some photos uploaded in the past few weeks may not be displaying, this will be fixed by tomorrow as we are syncing the data between servers
If you were getting an error when accessing our API, this has been fixed
Uploading to Twitpic from Twitterrific or other apps may not work yet until the DNS changes have taken full affect
I'm grabbing a pizza...*sigh of relief*
Some old photos may not be displaying, we are working on this. We are still syncing some of the data from the old servers over to the new
It would be a great help if everyone could retweet and get the word out that we've made the server move successfully, thanks everyone!
If you are seeing the "We've completed our server move" page then this means the DNS changes haven't updated in your area yet, hang tight
We're bringing mobile posting back online soon. Some mobile uploads may have not made it to our servers during the move
Some of you may still be seeing the "old" server, this just means the DNS changes haven't made it to your area yet
For those of you having issues connecting to twitpic, they have been resolved
We've completed our server move. We are just waiting on the DNS update to propagate across the internet.
We're moving servers! We will be back up later depending on how fast the DNS propagates.
We're back from our scheduled maintenance. Thanks for your patience! Things are right on track for our data center move this weekend
We're back down for some quick maintenance, we will be back up shortly
Photo of the guy behind Twitpic http://twitpic.com/hbu3 (@noaheverett) thanks for the spontaneous Q&A session everyone!

Thanks to @hollyhock for testing that the rotate option works on IE 6 as well
We've tested the rotate functionality on IE 7 / Firefox 3 / Safari 3

@brian4dotcom what error are you getting back?
@jimconn sorry about that. we just fixed that glitch in our mobile posting system
We apologize if your photo got posted multiple times when sent by phone. Some photos got stuck in our queue. This glitch has been fixed.

@benmarvin and we are working on a way to only correct orientation on non-iphone images, thanks for your patience
@Ronno971 the rest of the photos will be corrected when we turn this feature on, right now its off due to this iphone bug
The iPhone is writing bad EXIF data to the images so we cannot rotate them correctly, They end up upside down. Twitterrific is testing a fix
UPDATE: We have a fix to auto orient photos, but haven't turned it on due to a bug in the iPhone that affects Twitterrific uploads...
We're working on fixing the orientation of pictures that come in oriented sideways or upside down. We're testing the fix now.
