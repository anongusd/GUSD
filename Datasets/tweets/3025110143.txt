My advice, sorry to bore you with the tales you know like the back of your palm. But knowing is nothing without application. Please take a hint from Late Mandela's playbook and take our country forward. Economy, security and education should be your major focus.
He didn't embark on manhunts, he would have been right and justified of he had done that but he understood that peace gives more power than war. He knew for the country to grow, unity was imminent. He would have been guilty of what he preached against. He focused on the future.
Dear @MBuhari 		Mandela was sworn in as president of the country‚Äôs first multiethnic government. Instead of using the power of the office to deal with people who locked him up for 27years, he stretched his hand for a shake and leaned for a hug and asked for cooperation.
Nelson Mandela didn't seek a 2nd term as South Africa president and was succeeded by Mbeki in 1999. After leaving office, Mandela retired from active politics but maintained a strong international presence as an advocate of peace, reconciliation, and social justice. But Naijaü§¶ü§¶

I don't think there is loss in democracy, just louder voices How can we call a man who has 3million votes and counting a loser? We all have our political nuances and we stood by it through the times. Don't feel like a loser, just feel it's not here now to show up in full later.

Police now kidnaps and takes ransome. My sincere prayer goes to a country that just died again.
...already to burst our yansh. Jokingly ir seriously, we were scared and begged them to put us in a separate cell. Yes they did...... We slept there last night. They released us this morning. Mum would not  tell us how much she paid. Pathetic. God save this country. Amen.
After a while, I guess they were tired, they stoped. Meanwhile, the don tie my cousin with rope for upstairs... Hiring him heavily,  I could hear him scream from where I was  also wallowing in pangs. Well they threw us in the cell. As we were approaching the cell, the inmate were
Uncalculated punches and slaps landing on my face and body. I begged them to stop that I didn't do anything. They asked me to take off my belt, shoe, they took my phone and my money and forced me to sit on the floor. They started hitting my legs, treating me like a criminal.
So outside the A-division in Ilorin, I was there since those at the gate won't allow me to enter.... "bring 1k and enter" that was what he said. Then one of the officer that took my cousin came mouth and offered I come in, well on stepping into the station, they took turns on me.
I offered to call my mum but one of them was already getting physical, hiting me and all. I urged him to stop as he doesn't stand any authority to do so. He went on Asking me to call who I want to call, that he wants to know who my father is, how powerful my mother is. Really?
He grimaced, he smiled derisively.... I begged him why he'd do something like that... So they asked us to enter the car and move the remaining party at the station.... I refused to follow them but they were able to whisk away my cousin. I had to jump on the bike and trace them.
Went straight to the driver's seat and, dug his hand deep under the seat and came out with a white paper between his fingers. We asked what it was and since we had no idea, we have the rational answer. He fondled with one edge and brought out sachet of tramadol. I was confused
Already sitting in my hands..... Well, it's Nigeria and I'm familiar with the saying "bring your particulars". They stared and stared at the papers... They asked for driving license too, we had that one too. So one of them  just came from nowhere, with his big belle,
I stepped out and began to empty my pocket. I brough out my phone and some squeezed bill, I don't carry purse since I hardly carry cash. They searched everywhere like they've gotten an Intel that we've guns in the car, nothing is found. They asked for the car document which was
Exactly after doing the roundabout leading to Basin, there vehincle flanked us to the left while they flashed their touch light and waving it up and down telling us to pull over, we obediently pulled over and they asked us to step out that they'd  search us and complied.

It's funny now because she too can laugh about it. We laugh anytime we hear or see giveaway. She has close to 4000k now. In December, she got a job after the employer checked her page and found out she's got social media awareness and influence. Funny and somewhat, educative.
Before the end of the next day. She was just staring at her phone, I could not even console her. Fast forward. She borrowed the money and paid... When the news got out that she truly paid, she won extra more 600 followers now waiting for the next giveaway.
As I send am like this, she looked at me, looked back at her phone, looked up and down again. She had received ten comments with six having correct answers. Mine finally entered as the 19th comment. She couldn't cry, I couldn't laugh.... Now she's in debt of 20k.
My project supervisor called me, I was confused. I didn't know if I should pick it or drop it or just let it ring, He has never called me before, he doesn't call student. She looked into my eyes, her eyes don red... She leaned forward and hit the red on my phone...
It was then that I realised the power of freebies on social media. They followed her pa. So we continued with the plan. On the Dday, we were sitting side to side.  I on my hot spot and she connected conveniently. She posted the questions, as I was typing the answer.
I begged her to stop but we both knew it was too late for her to take the give away down. She didn't even have a thousand in her two bank accounts put together at that moment. In the space of ten days she  has moved from 823 followers to 1k5 followers... OMG. People are suffering
It was about ten days to the day of giveaway when she told me that I'm playing the most important role in the game, she said I'd have to use one of my new but active account to comment the first and the correct answers of questions she was going to ask that day.
Okay, the funniest moment in 2018; my friend was trying to win followers on her IG page and she decided to do a fake giveaway of 20k. I advised against it and beg her to reduce it to 10k when she refused. Iro oo, she sha want to do 20k. So she went all out, sending the gospel.
