@AkosScott @gatewaypundit I would probably understand that them murdering my family member had nothing to do with their immigration status. But if my emotions from the trauma caused me to think immigration was the problem, I would not be acting rationally.
@gatewaypundit What‚Äôs your ‚Äòwild guess‚Äô based on?
@AkosScott @gatewaypundit No, that‚Äôs a big leap. I‚Äôm saying anecdotes of illegal immigrants committing violent crimes should not be a per se justification for the wall or more stringent immigration policies. Some ‚Äúlegal‚Äù immigrants commit crimes, too - does that mean there should be no legal immigration?
@david_j_roth Fat old white guys in barn jackets: the one thread tying together all dystopian hells
@AkosScott @gatewaypundit My question is in response to the implied argument that stricter immigration policies prevent violence/crime against citizens. If illegal immigrants commit such crimes at significantly lower rates than citizens, how can reduction of violent crime by itself justify the wall?
@PoliticalShort What are your thoughts on statistics showing illegal immigrants are far less likely to commit crime than native-born citizens? Or do you disagree with those figures?
