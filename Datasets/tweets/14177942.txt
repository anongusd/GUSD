.@SenKamalaHarris is poking a hole in Kavanaugh's defense that he could not have assaulted Dr. Ford because he has female friends. "Do you agree that it is possible for men to both be friends with some women," she asked, "and treat other women badly?" #KavanaughHearings

Kiersten Stewart of @WithoutViolence: “To Dr. Ford: We demand that the Senate Judiciary Committee give you a full, unbiased, trauma-informed investigation. It is what you deserve. It is what every victim of sexual violence deserves.” https://t.co/iy0AYNRNgK https://t.co/nH7Z9kjngL
Legal expert @rogercanaff called for an investigation:"Further details, further corroboration, further truth surrounding what I do believe Dr. Ford endured—these things are entirely possible to gleam. They are entirely possible to discover and figure out." https://t.co/iy0AYO9oFk https://t.co/LN8j9Kn06b
.@LRockL of @BlackWomensBP was one year out of law school when Anita Hill testified. "Justice demands a process that treats Dr. Ford far better than the derision, scorn and humiliation to which Professor Hill was subjected." https://t.co/iy0AYNRNgK https://t.co/erR0PSJSbn
.@IndyDCRCC: "It is not our job to dissect Dr. Ford’s story, or any survivor’s story of sexual violence. It is our job to believe them. It is our job to support them. It is our job to hold those responsible accountable." https://t.co/iy0AYNRNgK https://t.co/qW62RhtxE8
.@Kim_Gandy of @NNEDV: "Sexual assault is not a Democratic issue and it’s not a Republican issue. It’s a human issue. And right now, we are badly in need of some humanity." https://t.co/xsL49oIlNR #ChristineBlaseyFord https://t.co/eGaAr1Lvb1
.@EllieSmeal of @FemMajority: "The national conversation surrounding Dr. Blasey Ford is still filled, after all these years, with hurtful myths that are traumatizing to survivors of sexual assault and damaging to the movement for justice.” https://t.co/xsL49oIlNR https://t.co/dGnMirIN1J
Survivors, advocates and experts came together in Washington, D.C. this morning to speak out in support of Dr. #ChristineBlaseyFord, demand a fair and unbiased investigation into her allegations and make recommendations for a trauma-informed path forward. https://t.co/xsL49oIlNR https://t.co/meZqxaL8Il

“Victims of DV should not be foreclosed from seeking asylum, and anyone fleeing violence and persecution should not be subject to the cruelty of having their children forcibly removed.” — @GaylynnBurrough https://t.co/aKASCO1tXM #EndFamilySeparation #KeepFamiliesTogether
The Trump administration has also ordered the separation of families at the border, putting children at risk. "This is a human rights issue," @EllieSmeal declared at a D.C. rally. "This is a feminist issue." #EndFamilySeparation #FamiliesBelongTogether https://t.co/a6E41OvxZy
AG Sessions this week attempted to paint asylum for DV survivors as a shortcut to citizenship. That's far from the truth. We documented the journey to asylum for many women fleeing domestic violence—and it was long and arduous, and often unsuccessful.	https://t.co/XdQpZxRR1g

A rising tide is causing waves in the political arena—and it’s one driven by the voices and values of feminist women. #AlabamaSenateElection https://t.co/UnyJKl6uFl
57 percent of women voters and 42 percent of men polled yesterday believed Roy Moore's accusers, despite his attempts to discredit them. https://t.co/UnyJKl6uFl #AlabamaSenateElection

"I have quite a few men coming into my classroom, mostly b/c they were raised by feminist women &amp; they recognize that they need to have tools to support women in the modern workplace. So we need to de-stigmatize men taking Women &amp; Gender Studies classes." @MicheleTBerger #MsAt45
"We have a male readership of about 25 percent. I work with quite a few younger men who write for our blog from their perspective as feminist men, how men can lead in their own communities to enact feminist change." @carmenriosss #MsAt45
"I think there is a maybe maybe maybe in the Republican party right now. The Republican Illinois Governor just authorized Medicaid funding for abortion. At the national level maybe not, but on the state level, Republicans might step up." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
"We are fighting to overturn the Global Gag Rule. It's leading to deaths. Even in War Zones, where rape is used as a tool of war, we are essentially forcing doctors to violate the Geneva Convention." @elliesmeal #MsAt45
"Things that have to change: First, the cap for how much women can sue for punitive damage in employment needs to be removed. Second, non-disclosure and forced arbitration need to no longer be used for sexual harassment." @kathyspillar #MsAt45
"Don't give up hope. Yes we have a Sexual-Violence-in-Chief but there's a lot of outrage about it. And I think part of what's happening in Alabama is that outrage is accumulating." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
Remember a lot of people being appointed are foxes, they want to destroy the agencies they're entering. We keep saying the administration isnt doing anything but they are. They might not be able to pass a law but they can undo a lot of laws that already exists @elliesmeal #MsAt45
"We pay a lot of attention to Congress and the White House, but we're less aware of the deeper levels of government. Where things are happening are in the administrative levels of government. The Trump administration is dismantling civil rights enforcement offices." #MsAt45
"Women in prison write Ms more than any other group. Sometimes the only reading materials they have are Ms or the Bible. They write and say Ms encouraged them to become lawyers, or that they didn't realize other women were impacted by the same issues as them." @elliesmeal #MsAt45
"I'm very proud that Ms is continuing our program of putting our magazines in women's prisons and women's shelters." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
"I remember when I took an Intro to Women's Studies class I thought it was so depressing. But using Ms in the Classroom is great because Ms articles don't just talk about the problem, they focus on the solution. For students, it makes Women's Studies empowering." #MsAt45
"These issues like sexual harassment and rape culture that Ms has been talking about for so long are finally leaking onto the mainstream. So it's a really exciting time." @carmenriosss #MsAt45
"I see the Ms Blog as a way to build on the Ms legendary mission of activism. And I work with a really diverse group of people to make that happen. Our blog and social media are places where we can create some transformative people power." @carmenriosss #MsAt45
"What happened on November 7th is that women and feminist men who ran for office for the first time WON against entrenched incumbents who were committee chairs! And they won for a weird reason: PEOPLE VOTED!" @elliesmeal #MsAt45
"So often, the groups of the Women's Movement are invisible and they're breaking their necks. And we use Ms. to give credit where credit is due." @elliesmeal #MsAt45
1 of the values of a figure like Wonder Woman is that she's iconic as a symbol for women's empowerment, but she's also contentious &amp; has withstood scrutiny. She's not a perfect figure. She's 1 we can use to debate &amp; ask questions about society &amp; patriarchy @fourthwaveprof #MsAt45
I grew up on Wonder Woman &amp; the industry was slowly stripping her magic powers away. We decided if we put her on the cover, stopping bombs w/ one hand, handing out food w/ the other, we could get DC Comics to give her all of her powers back. And it worked." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
"On this island of Manhattan, for 100,000 years before Europeans stepped foot here, lived a people who did not have a language that distinguished between gender. Gender is something that we have made up." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
"There are no boundaries, there are no hierarchies. We are truly linked, not ranked." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
"It is important to remember that sexual harassment is about power not sex. And I don't think we've quite realized that yet." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
"Racism and sexism have always been intertwined and you can't address one without the other." @GloriaSteinem #MsAt45
