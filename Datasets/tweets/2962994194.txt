Despite the dysfunction in Washington, we extended the NFIP through May and South Jerseyans and 140 million Americans living in coastal counties will have flood insurance coverage. I will continue fighting for South Jerseyans through the finish line. https://t.co/RHZbbheOlU
I'm glad to see Congress fulfill our commitment to the victims, survivors, families, and heroes of 9/11. This law will provide funding for the security and operation of the 9/11 memorial in NYC, so future generations may safely visit and #NeverForget the 3,000 Americans we lost. https://t.co/TsAka5Pmnp
Sec. Mattis is a patriot. His lifetime of service reflects his love of country &amp; commitment to our men and women in uniform. He is right that to protect our interests, we must strengthen our alliances. We also can't ignore the threat from adversaries like China, Iran, and Russia. https://t.co/GOMVTbminX
I once again voted for the #FarmBill. This bill supports farmers &amp; ranchers, expands trade opportunities, provides affordable crop insurance that's critical to protect NJ farms, and improves conservation programs—all important to our state's ag industry. https://t.co/FK4BctjZvH
Debbie and I are saddened by the passing of Freeholder John Bartlett. He honorably served the people of Ocean County for 40 years and under his leadership, our community prospered. John's friendship, service, and legacy will never be forgotten.

Since day 1, I've said I'll do whatever is necessary to ensure the NFIP doesn't lapse and protect South Jersey residents &amp; 140 million Americans living in coastal counties. A lame duck Congress won't stop me from fighting for what's best for South Jersey. https://t.co/T5JSPhbSrL

Thanks to the incredible staff at the Animal Shelter! https://t.co/3SY7uY99KX
.@RepChrisSmith and I joined leadership from @jointbasemdl for a ribbon cutting at the 87FSS Flight Deck Community Center. This new facility provides servicemembers and JB MDL employees an area to gather and enjoy activities. I’ll continue to support the Joint Base in Congress. https://t.co/6AIDVAvfN9
Strong economic numbers from October—more than 2.1 million jobs have been created since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, wages are rising, and the unemployment rate is at a near 50-year low. https://t.co/qR9Ikynw34
I stopped at the veteran-owned Backward Flag Brewing Company in Lacey tonight to talk about issues important to the craft beer industry. Tax reform has given businesses like these real relief, helping them grow &amp; invest in our local economy. 		https://t.co/fdA4k98gME https://t.co/69AaQxNwQJ

My colleagues and I introduced the bipartisan Combatting Illicit Fentanyl Act. As co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force, it’s critical we prevent the influx of drugs on our streets and hold bad actors, like China, accountable for their role in trafficking fentanyl to USA. https://t.co/zOkgOl3Gph
We must never forget the tireless work of law enforcement, volunteers, and the National Guard members in the immediate aftermath of Sandy. That's why I fought for the Humanitarian Service Medal to be awarded to 2,300 National Guard members for their rescue efforts. https://t.co/agkbwdR5VQ
One of these policies was the result of advocacy from Russ and Joanna, who I met with in May of 2015. This picture is from the press conference we held in their backyard when I announced the Disaster Survivor Benefit Clarification Act. https://t.co/UGQ9YnDeNc
One of the 1st actions I took in Congress was introducing 2 bills that support Sandy victims who were wronged by FEMA and the federal govt. Now law, these policies prohibit FEMA from recouping disaster assistance grants from survivors and give them greater access to federal aid.
Thanks to volunteers, law enforcement, and the National Guard, our community has been able to put the pieces back together. I’ll continue to do all I can to make the federal govt more accountable for their missteps and I will not rest until every last Sandy survivor is back home.
Six years ago, Superstorm Sandy devastated the Jersey Shore, changing it forever. We all know someone whose home, business, and life were completely devastated. But, through tragedy, we saw our community come together in the days, months, and years that followed. https://t.co/JGrEWCDPYl
I joined Ocean County Sheriff Mastronardy, Toms River Councilwoman Huryk &amp; local leaders from the Jewish community this afternoon to remember the lives of those murdered in Pittsburgh yesterday. Our community must come together to reject hatred and violence in all forms. https://t.co/VYvnZqbCjI

I'm so grateful for our law enforcement officers. There are too many, on both sides of the political divide, who attack &amp; even resort to violence when there's political disagreement. These threats, these attacks, the rhetoric on both sides, have just gone too far. Full statement: https://t.co/CgwmBBGyyC
We continue to see the benefits of pro-growth, pro-jobs policies. In the third quarter, consumer spending—which grew by 4%, the strongest showing since 2014—accounted for two thirds of all U.S. economic activity. https://t.co/bjjm0Q9iHm

3/3 As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we passed the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act. This helps brewers create jobs and invest back into their business. It's disappointing that state officials in Trenton do not share this commitment to support small businesses
2/3 This recent decision will hurt those who work at breweries in our state and it's just unnecessary micro-management from Trenton. At the federal level, I consistently support pro-business, pro-growth policies that allow our economy and small businesses to thrive.
1/3 I absolutely disagree with Governor Phil Murphy's decision to over-regulate our state's breweries. Again, the Murphy Administration has decided to hinder economic growth by adding more obstacles for our small businesses. https://t.co/MMiAXGVnkS

Speaker Paul Ryan has been a selfless public servant and has led the House with strength and dignity.  Because of his leadership, we have been able to rebuild our military, roll back excessive regulations, and provide tax cuts for millions of middle-class families.
It is especially important in advance of President Trump’s meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, to show the world that the United States means what we say and will not hesitate to defend our interests and keep our commitments.
Assad, and countries like Iran and Russia, which continue to support this mad man, must know the days of America’s inaction are over.
Last year, President Trump took decisive action when Assad launched a chemical weapons attack against his own people and the President should take appropriate action now.
America must take action and send a strong message to Assad and his enablers in Russia and Iran that the United States will not allow this type of violence to go unanswered.

The NJ Board of Public Utilities announced customers will see lower utility bills, due to tax reform. NJ working families are seeing bigger paychecks, lower tax rates, bonuses and now lower utility bills, all thanks to tax reform.
As I have said before, Vladimir Putin is a dangerous thug. We must continue to stand with our friends in the face of Russian aggression. (2)
Russia’s destabilizing behavior, including their attempts to influence our elections and the recent attack in England, is reckless and hostile. Today’s actions by the United States, and our allies across the globe, send a strong message to Russia. (1)
-strengthens the background check system	-amends the Dickey Amendment to allow the CDC to conduct research on gun violence	-more money for school safety and law enforcement	-increases funding for mental health programs (3)	https://t.co/j9g484mydT

Completing the Gateway tunnel project would be a major win for our entire nation and I will continue to work across the aisle to help make it happen.
This project is of critical importance to our nation's economy and would create thousands of jobs for the highly skilled men and women in the building and construction trades.
This morning’s Portal Bridge malfunction in New Jersey is further proof that leaders across all levels of government must come together and get the Gateway tunnel project done.

Make no mistake, this savings on utility bills is a direct result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and will mean even more money in the pockets of middle class taxpayers in New Jersey.
I called on the BPU to pass along benefits of tax reform to consumers on January 23, because New Jerseyans deserve additional relief.
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) signed an order that mandates utility companies to pass any savings from the new tax law onto consumers. This news comes after I wrote a letter to the NJ BPU urging the exact same action. https://t.co/GrcbqVt08g

There are real areas of agreement on national security, the addiction crisis, immigration reform, infrastructure, and the economy, and I challenge leaders in both parties to do more to facilitate bipartisan solutions.
Both parties have the same goal of wanting to improve the lives of working Americans, but we must all be better at working together.
I echo the President’s call for more bipartisanship on the big issues facing our nation. Republicans and Democrats must be willing to trust one another and compromise more in order to achieve results that the American people deserve.

Here’s a quick recap of the work I did during the shutdown: https://t.co/fsXEI1kjwq
I hope @SenatorMenendez &amp; @SenBooker do their jobs and put politics aside to vote to reopen the government. Not only is it the right thing to do, but our troops and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst are counting on them.
South Jersey is home to thousands of military members; we depend on them and they must be able to depend on us. There is no excuse for this shutdown, but until it’s resolved, we need to do the right thing by our troops – Period. https://t.co/6ja5U71nnB
This legislation will ensure service men and women continue to get a paycheck while prohibiting Members of Congress from receiving a salary during the government shutdown.
It is unacceptable to me that Members of Congress are still paid during a government shutdown, while the men and women of the United States Armed Forces are not, which is why I cosponsored the Pay Our Protectors, Not Our Politicians Act.
Thanks to @GovMurphy for hosting a bipartisan call w/federal officials to discuss the shutdown, which we all agree is hurting NJ. I encouraged @SenatorMenendez &amp; @SenBooker to join bipartisan group of colleagues to reopen govt and deal w/DACA immediately afterwards. https://t.co/AjzwcD7Xxl
It is unacceptable to me that Members of Congress are still being paid, while our troops, federal law enforcement officers, and other government employees are not. https://t.co/4f8HkhuGKX

...as well as vulnerable children in the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) like bargaining chips. This is no way to run our government and the American people deserve better.
Members of both parties need to stop treating the funding of the federal government like a political football.  Instead of finding a solution that would keep our government open, some politicians have resorted to treating our military men and women,...
I came to Washington to get things done and have always been willing to work with anyone to solve the serious problems facing our country. Unfortunately, it appears like some people in Washington do not feel the same way.

More than 160 companies have come out and announced bonuses, wage increases, and reinvestment in the U.S. economy—all thanks to tax reform. Just this week, Celgene announced it will be opening a new research center in New Jersey—creating 500 new jobs.
Yesterday, I joined @BillSpadea on @nj1015 to discuss the positive impacts of tax reform. https://t.co/cSnZr0sKWv
Now, both the House and Senate must compromise on a permanent budget to fund these key priorities.
That being said, I'm grateful we will use this opportunity to achieve a much-needed, long-term re-authorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), fund our military, and fight against addiction.
I will vote for the Continuing Resolution, but let's not confuse this for success.  Funding the government of the greatest nation on earth one month at a time is no way to govern.
I am categorically opposed to shutting down the government and urge leaders in both parties to stop the political brinksmanship.  The American people elected us to confront and solve tough problems, not retreat to our respective corners and point fingers at each other.

I genuinely believe that we can work together to protect our environment and our shore economy from the dangers posed by drilling for oil off New Jersey’s coast. (3)
The Secretary also reiterated his promise that stakeholders, including elected officials, local businesses, and fishing industry-related groups would be consulted on this issue. I appreciate Secretary Zinke’s friendship and the time he took to discuss this with me. (2)
Yesterday, I spoke directly to @SecretaryZinke about the Dept. of Interior's Draft Proposed Plan. I have been, and remain opposed to oil drilling off the New Jersey coast. He assured me of continued communication and transparency surrounding this plan. (1.)
As we work towards a solution on DACA and border security, we should all keep in mind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s timeless words that what matters most is the content of one's character, not the color of their skin or where they were born. (3)
I have also spent significant time and resources in Africa working to strengthen communities that are filled with some of the most amazing people I have ever met. (2)
The circumstances of someone’s birth does not define their value and should not determine the outcome of their life. As the father of two children adopted from Korea, I have seen this principle play out in meaningful ways in my own life. (1)
