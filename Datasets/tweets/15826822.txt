What a totally wild hearing. Roger Stone grilled by both judge and special counsel over Instagram post https://t.co/AShlQ5BWg2
SCO Kracis: to Stone: "You cant remember the names of all the people who had access to your cellphone for days ago?" Stone: "Correct."
Stone on who can access phone "My house is like a headquarters, I have many volunteers." Judge Jackson: "I thought you said you have five." Stone: "Five is a lot for coming and going."
Roger Stone said he picked from two or three pictures of Judge Jackson, added: "I erased all the images of your honor because I did not want to make the same mistake twice"
Now Stone says a volunteer chose the image but he posted it himself. Judge Jackson, like all of us, says "Wait a minute, didn't you just say five minutes ago..."
Jackson is grilling Stone on why he apologized if he didn't think the cross in the post was a crosshairs and was being misinterpreted -- “It was improper for me to criticize at all, I recognize that,” he replies. "I didn't have a malicious intent."
Judge Jackson also just read from Roger Stone's financial filings, according to which he makes $47,000 a month as a consultant

@BradMossEsq Not yet, especially because their press release doesn't include the  "1,172-page submission" to the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights
Wikileaks says in statement that "U.S. federal prosecutors have in the last few months formally approached people in the United   States, Germany and Iceland and pressed them to testify against Mr.   Assange in return for immunity from prosecution"
In particular, Kian objects to charge that Flynn's firm filed a false FARA with the DOJ in 2017 retroactively covering Turkey lobbying, saying "defense is at a loss to understand how"
Meanwhile Kian has asked for a bill of particulars, citing all the documents in the case and saying he "should not have to comb through a haystack looking for a needle to understand the indictment’s allegations"

Judge gives James Wolfe a two month sentence, with four months of supervised release, for lying to the FBI
"It is the natural consequence of having chosen to break the law – the shame, the stigma the changed social circumstances, they all go with the territory," she said.
While judge says Jim Wolfe didn't deserve sentencing enhancements, she said she was also "unmoved" by the idea that he has suffered humiliation enough, as he said in his emotional statement
“Having an affair is not a crime, maintaining relationships with reporters is not a crime, even giving sensitive non-public but not classified information to a reporter is not a crime,” judge says
Judge rejects upward sentencing departure for Jim Wolfe for lying to FBI, saying his relationship with a reporter was “potentially harmful and entirely inappropriate but ... not criminal”
Judge sentencing James Wolfe says she will disregard filing from Carter Page, saying he’s not a victim in the case and it sheds no light on sentencing. But it will be made public today

@FreedomFactor76 Because I’m in his courtroom at least once a week, I wrote a profile of him, and we’ve spoken on the phone. Also, it was a joke.
@JerpaDerpa So what's interesting is the defense attorney said this dealer would knowingly buy fentanyl and use it himself. I'm trying to find out more on that front.
@neilkli Flippant, not sure. Inaccurate, definitely... but he's the one with the microphone and the robe
Result: A two or three minute lecture on how I shouldn't be "flippant," when these victims' family members have spoken so powerfully, and that it's now my responsibility to do better in print. Anyway, now I can say I too have been yelled at by Judge Ellis.
Finally, AUSA Jim Trump points out that there is a reporter in the room. So Ellis asks me to stand up and say why I'm there, I say I do think the story is important, and (stupidly) joke that I'm a little offended he didn't recognize me.

Looks like Manafort verdict won't be in today -- sadly for me, since I'll be on vacation the next two weeks. Unless the jury takes a *really* long time ...    https://t.co/lfZSgPGIub
Judge Ellis says he won't release jurors names because he has received threats, says he goes everywhere with U.S. Marshals
Some context on "reasonable doubt" in Manafort. 4th circuit allows explanation if requested but discourages: "We remain convinced that attempting to explain the words ... is more dangerous than leaving a jury to wrestle with only the words themselves." https://t.co/9Kf8bnkNYM
Here's a story on the jury questions. Defense says it's "a very good day for Mr. Manafort." Unclear -- but obviously they're delving into the weeds  https://t.co/zsupOqbNk3
Judge reminded the jury that that's one requirement for an FBAR, but there other cases where its required, included if someone "controls the disposition of money" from an account or if the owner is acting as his agent
On FBAR, defense had argued it was Manafort's consulting firm that should have filed foreign bank account reports and that for three of the four charged years he owned only 50 percent of the company (his wife owned the other half).
Rick Gates had appeared to be talking about "shell companies" but actually said "shelf companies" -- which he defined as premade for someone to take over. (https://t.co/XU2D1axX32)
Manafort jurors had four questions. Judge said they had to rely on their collective memory for the definition of "shelf company" and on which exhibits matched which charges. But he re-read the requirements for filing an FBAR and definition of "reasonable doubt"

"Presenting evidence of Manafort’s transactions entirely through witness	testimony could expose the government to appellate risk."
Prosecutors in Manafort pushing back on limits to evidence in filing: "The photographs and invoices make clear that the expenditures were for personal purposes and assist the government in telling the jury a 'comprehensible story.'"

Ronald Wall, CFO for Bijan, couldn't even identify his suit's material, saying that's not his department -- but called it "super great stuff."
In an interview with the Washington Post, Maximillian Katzman -- who sold Manafort nearly $1 million in suits over four years -- said his own suit was made of Solaro wool but could not name the color. "We jokingly call it 'Italian blue,'" he said. "It's blue."
Maximillian Katzman, 29, the manager of a luxury menwear store in New York City, testifies that Paul Manafort spent more than $929,000 on suits between 2010 and 2014. He was the store's only customer to pay using wire transfers from foreign accounts.

Special counsel was given until Friday to respond to this Manafort motion but asked for another business day if there are a lot of documents -- which there are
Devine says he stopped consulting for Yanukovych after he jailed his opponent -- that can still be technically true. His 2012 memo was for parliamentary elections, and in 2014 $10/day proposal comes after Yanukovych fled country and Manafort was working for successor party
Manafort on Obama in 2010, in advice to Yanukovych: "Obama responds to personal chemistry and intelligence. He will be interested in your goals and your ability to achieve those goals."
"We will continue to respect the process and the request of the Special Counsel that we limit public comment. We are happy to assist in the important fact-finding work of this investigation to achieve justice and protect our democracy"
Statement from Devine's firm: 	"The Special Counsel has asked Tad Devine to assist in the prosecution of their case against Paul Manafort ...We have been assured by the Special Counsel’s Office that we have no legal exposure and did not act unlawfully."
One Manafort/Ukraine person who has held on in Trump White House -- Bobby Peede, director of presidential advance. Planned a Yanukovych rally in 2005, per new docs
In 2014 Devine comes back, tells Rick Gates his rate will be $10,000 a day https://t.co/JrDCJrpVRY
So Tad Devine told NYT he quit working for Yanukovych in 2012 b/c he jailed his rival. There is a 4/12 email to Manafort in which he says, "We will not be able to work with you on the election this year." But in August of that year he's sending Manafort a strategy memo
"Having worked campaigns for the last 35 years, this one will be at the top of the list of most satisfying," Manafort wrote team after Yanukovych's 2010 victory (A team that included Dem consultants Tad Devine, Adam Strasberg and Dan Rabin)
Manafort has filed motion with  exhibits he does not want shown at trial -- hundreds of pages of strategy discussions around former Ukrainian president Victor Yanukovych

No ruling yet from Judge Ellis on continuance of anything else. Manafort appeared in court for the first time since being jailed, in his green jumpsuit
@djkocisi2 Actually Manafort, as far as we know -- he hasn't waived his appearance, and he's now being held just a few blocks away
@PaulDFarrar Yes, that's the allegation -- but the SCO argues that the bank fraud was a move of desperation after Yanukovych lost power, and so what happened in Ukraine is relevant
@arlette_50 @DavidCornDC That's in D.C. So he's arguing that it's not relevant in Alexandria and SCO is trying to have "two bites at the apple"

Judge Ellis must approve immunity motions in Manafort case, but he is out this week. Could be vendors (rug salesman?), bank employees, accountants ...   https://t.co/C4KLHtbZP6
Just FWIW, do not think these immunity motions have anything to do with the delay on the final pre-trial hearing. Nor do I think it's a plea deal. Ellis canceled everything he had this week, assume it's personal

There's a lot in this filing. Manafort is sending emails. He told someone on the phone why he wanted the D.C. trial first: “think about how it’ll play elsewhere….There is a strategy to it,	even in failure, but there’s a hope in it."
Per special counsel, just days before asking for a continuance Manafort told someone, “I’ve gone through	all the discovery now.” Also said he is able to visit with his lawyers every day,	and that he has “all my files like I would at home.”
SCO has filed motion opposing effort to get Manafort's trial delayed. Says Manafort has a personal laptop and phone in jail, doesn't have to wear uniform, has his own bathroom, shower and workroom access and has told people he *is* treated like a "VIP."

The leak accusation: 1) Weissmann convened the AP meeting 2) he suggested AP reporters ask Cyprus authorities whether they handed over everything to US 3) DOJ told AP that FARA violations could be prosecuted 4) DOJ said AP had a good grasp of Manafort's biz dealings
Yet more Manafort motions tonight -- a new one for a leak hearing and one to continue trial. But Ellis made clear last week that he wouldn't move trial unless he had to for personal reasons

Kevin Mallory has decided not to testify, so EDVA espionage case is over except for closing arguments
Basically defense argument in Mallory is that everything he told the Chinese is echoed in public domain. CIA and DIA disagree, say docs were specific enough to cause harm. (Impossible for us to judge, because all still classified)
He said there was no "wow factor," his response to leak would be, "So what?" Prosecutor suggested he didn't train Brennan that way. Cooper said he did: "I do use colorful terms, even with the director"

To be clear, Judge Ellis likes to be tough -- maybe even mean --  especially to DOJ lawyers with fancy pedigrees. Doesn't mean he's going to rule against them. https://t.co/iaJhrmpFUH
@KWintersWrites Not exactly. He hasn't ruled, but he suggested if he ruled for Manafort the case could go back to EDVA
