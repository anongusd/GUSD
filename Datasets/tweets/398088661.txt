@NextLAMayor @StefenEQ @michaelshure FWIW, AOC is testing your theory, with the minimum staff salary in her office being $52,000, but because there is so little money in her MRA, that means senior staff makes no more than $80,000, which also carries its own problems.

@plbernstein92 Treaty of Madrid is from 1891. That‚Äôs the first treaty dealing with ‚ÄúChampagne.‚Äù Versailles then codifies and expands that agreement. 		The U.S. signed Versailles, but the Senate never ratified it, so we operated under some murky international law for 80+ years.
Just spent a little time reading tweets about this ‚Äî which mostly get the facts wrong ‚Äî and a couple articles about it. 		This was the best story on it: https://t.co/yk3v3yxAP2
@plbernstein92 We catch Rob Lowe‚Äôs character explaining that Champagne has to come from ‚ÄúChampagne,‚Äù otherwise it‚Äôs just sparkling wine.
Anyway, I thought that was interesting and I tweet for me no one is making me tweet stuff like this.
Except, U.S. trade negotiators secured a concession allowing U.S. winemakers already marketing their sparkling as ‚ÄúChampagne‚Äù to continue. 		Hence, we have stuff like ‚ÄúAndr√© California Champagne.‚Äù
So some American wineries were calling their sparkling ‚ÄúChampagne‚Äù with impunity for decades ‚Äî many of the lower-end winemakers, in fact ‚Äî until we agreed to end that practice in a 2005 trade deal.
An agreement to only call wines from Champagne, France, ‚ÄúChampagne‚Äù is from the Treaty of Versailles ‚Äî ‚ÄúActually‚Äù first appears in the Treaty of Madrid ‚Äî but the U.S. Senate didn‚Äôt ratify the Treaty of Versailles.
Contrary to Wayne‚Äôs World, the term ‚ÄúChampagne‚Äù *can* be used to describe sparkling wine outside of Champagne *if* the winery was using the term before March 10, 2006.

@TakeBackUsa2018 Republicans got what they wanted. Democrats didn't. You tell me who failed on that one.
House passes the funding bill 300-128, with 109 Republicans voting no, 19 Democrats voting no, 87 Republicans voting yes, and 213 Democrats voting yes.		They were well short of a majority of Republican votes, and Democrats didn‚Äôt get to 218. They needed Republican votes.
Dem leadership is out in the back, looking for members they can flip so they can get 218 votes on their own.		Mildly important for their future negotiating position that they can say they had the votes to pass this themselves without GOP votes.
A majority of Republicans are gonna vote no on this spending deal. Democrats also aren‚Äôt going to get to 218 votes on this. 		Leadership from both parties kinda muddling their message on the victory, but particularly Republicans. Trump isn‚Äôt gonna love that many GOP no votes.
Folks, looks pretty certain that a majority of Republicans *will* vote no on this bill. That could give Trump some pause on signing this thing.		It also makes this look like a better deal for Democrats than it probably is.
Looking like a majority of Republicans *could* vote no on this, which would be a little shocking.
Currently more Republican noes than there are Republican yeas. 55-56
Right now, it‚Äôs looking more like the dozen-ish Dem noes and 60 Republican noes.		Current tally is 129-29, with 6 Dems and 23 Republicans voting no.
Alright. We‚Äôre voting in the House on the funding bill.		This is one I think we‚Äôll spend some time reviewing as some ~paradigm of ideological purity~ for both parties.
Bit of a feeling here in the House that there may be more Democratic no votes than we first expected on this funding bill. 		Could be more in the 20-30 range rather than single digits to a dozen.

Walter Jones famously changed his mind about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he was very open for years that his biggest regret in life was voting to authorize those wars.		Republicans wouldn‚Äôt let him have an Armed Services subcommittee chairmanship because he spoke out.
We had a long chat about his career one night, and at some point, he started talking about why he cared about veterans.		Through tears, Jones told me he came to Congress and discovered that his grandfather was gassed in the Argonne Forest in WWI and eventually killed himself.
We just lost another good Congressman: Walter Jones.		Years ago, I wondered who the Congressman was who crossed party lines the most. By a long shot, it was Jones. He voted for every Dem motion that benefitted veterans, and he was happy to pay the price.		https://t.co/CZhyjwSreN

@iamscottenglish You‚Äôre not making a fair comparison and you know it. Revenue was going to go up over the next 10 years without tax reform. Unless you believe we were gonna experience some horrible recession that was staved off by a tax cut that‚Äôs thus far had small GDP impact...

Is the 2017 tax reform paying for itself? It‚Äôs a complicated question, for what does ‚Äúpay for itself‚Äù really mean? And isn‚Äôt truth subjective anyway? Is a little more national debt for all such a big deal when certain individuals will make out like bandits?		In this essay, I wil

@notthatready @econwonk Eh. I‚Äôm not sure anyone even cares about spending anymore. One vote to ‚Äúraise‚Äù spending versus several votes, and I do think this storyline would of constraining spending would become pretty mainstream.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 I‚Äôm probably not as sympathetic to that as I should be, but I still don‚Äôt think anyone is taking future shutdowns seriously enough.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 I‚Äôm telling you, there‚Äôd be a supplemental.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 If I were at an agency right now, I‚Äôd take guaranteed paychecks for the rest of Trump‚Äôs first term.
@notthatready @econwonk Rhetorically, yes, but in effect, no. Congress, like always, is not living by BCA caps.
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 And agencies would be wise to take guaranteed funding whenever they can get it at this point. (Again, The Appropriations Committee probably then focuses on a supplemental, so this becomes more like an auto-CR deal for two years.)
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 I mean, yeah, not happening, but this is where my mind wandered to at a bar with a bunch of mourning journalists.
@econwonk I‚Äôd prob do 02/01/2021, so a new President is in office, and because that date looks tight as hell.
@MattGlassman312 @joshHuder So the real result is you get an omnibus supplemental every year ‚Äî thus why Dems do it ‚Äî but it takes shutdown off the table.
@StevenTDennis And thus, retaining their services for the next two years is irrelevant. An actual way to drain the swamp.
@econwonk Zach, come on, the caps deal is included in this at continuing fiscal 19 levels.
@joshHuder Josh, this is Congress, I can fix that problem in less than a page of legislative text. (The caps deal is just a continuation of defense and non-defense spending at fiscal 19 levels.)
This idea ‚Äî which, again, is not happening ‚Äî would have an added ‚Äúdrain the swamp‚Äù effect.		I imagine lobbyists would *hate* not having new spending bills for two years (unless their job is to block new riders, in which case, enjoy your vacation). https://t.co/HWXsBbJpgQ
@CapeCodder2012 Good point, though a lot of them are also interested in constraining Dem riders that‚Äôll now pass the House.
@MattDennis1 Write the caps deal into the CR (as an extension of current spending for defense and non-defense).
Republicans would also get to brag about constraining spending and the Dem House majority, (though I bet there‚Äôd be a big push for a defense supplemental), and Democrats would get government funded for a long time with no wall fight.		Essentially, both sides win and lose.
I had this idea last night, and it‚Äôs not gonna happen, but it‚Äôs a fun thought-experiment:		A two-year continuing resolution.		Democrats wouldn‚Äôt like it because it‚Äôd limit the bills where they could make new law ‚Äî same for some Rs ‚Äî but it‚Äôd end shutdown threat under Trump.

There‚Äôs also more to political implications than GOP support. Independents are cracking. His favorability is dipping into the 30s.
@TalKopan @ryanbeckwith These assumptions only work when government and the decision-makers are acting rationally.		Is the pain caused by this shutdown driving a deal? If not...
If House Democrats went this route with a *one-day* continuing resolution, I'd bet more than 20 Republicans ‚Äî about double what they're getting on individual agency funding bills ‚Äî would vote for it.		It would also highlight McConnell's obstinance, how pain is the point. https://t.co/dyDUpnfRAD
@jjstoller I guess. Pretty cool point, huh?
The whole idea of this shutdown is to make it painful for real people so one side cracks ‚Äî a very cool and responsible way to govern ‚Äî but you can lessen the pain and hold onto most of your "leverage," just saying.
@emilycrockett The contractors have been SOL for a long time on this and no one is doing anything to help them.

The House is voting on the resolution against white nationalism ‚Äî supposed to serve as a proxy vote against Steve King ‚Äî only the vote is currently unanimous. Even King is voting yes. Current tally 399-0.		I don‚Äôt think this will satisfy Democrats who want to censure King.

@daveweigel FWIW, there were good reporters in that scrum chasing after her. Having talked to at least one of the reporters there ‚Äî a certain British reporter ‚Äî I know he had some legitimate questions. And I‚Äôm sure you know that shouted questions aren‚Äôt really the best, most nuanced ones.

Folks, I am replying to the replies. And I gotta tell you: Feed the trolls.
@_Jordan_J_ You asked where the outrage was over Trump not answering questions or the shutdown. Again, feel free to comb through my tweets.
@xiruxi I get that frustration. But I‚Äôd also say it‚Äôs important to call out politicians when they run away from questions.
@prestuvius Pretty cool that you think politicians should be the judge of what questions people care about and not a free and independent press.
@number1fan_2 I disagree. There are plenty of legitimate questions to ask her ‚Äî What has Dem leadership said to you? Do you fear that you‚Äôre going to be the poster-child for impeachment now? Are you undermining the Dem message on impeachment? Do you think Dems are playing impeachment wrong?

@DarinBMiller You guys are excellent at not being helpful.
@furlantaylor I expect more from new members than running away.
@AlexDesormiers It‚Äôs more the sentiment ‚Äî ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to impeach this motherfucker‚Äù ‚Äî that everyone is interested in, and the potential backlash from leadership. (‚ÄúAre Dem leaders pressuring you to hold off on impeachment?‚Äù)		But sure, yeah.
One thing that new members of Congress should know is that the press is going to ask you questions ‚Äî and we don‚Äôt want answers from flacks.		Congress is the best covered institution in the world, and the reason for that is the access, conversations, and relationships we share.

@MattGlassman312 @joshHuder @CaseyBurgat @mattngreen Can we set it at 8?
@MattGlassman312 @mattngreen @joshHuder @CaseyBurgat We really shoulda offered odds on various vote-getters.		Nancy Pelosi: 1:10,000	Kevin McCarthy: 1:8,000	Jim Jordan: 1:50	John Lewis: 1:2	Colin Powell: 2:1	Paul Ryan: 2:1	Jim Cooper: 3:1	James Mattis: 8:1	Barbara Lee: 32:1	Alcee Hastings: 400:1
@joshHuder @MattGlassman312 @CaseyBurgat @mattngreen I was kinda hoping to catch a live line under when this adjusts to 15 (-110) early in the vote.		Would give me 20:1 on a bookend zone of 10-15.

Pelosi is now offering a privileged motion to get a vote on a CR to keep government open.
@StevenTDennis @HouseInSession I assume they would not get consent. I'm sure there are plenty of Senators who'd like to take the vote on the wall now.
An interesting strategy that Democrats almost certainly won't take advantage of.		They could prevent a vote on the wall merely through a quorum call. (Practical effect would be slowing everything down, giving Republicans more time, and ultimately getting more GOP members here.) https://t.co/yZOVTdRqhr
@HouseInSession Does the Senate have the votes to strip it out? Couldn't they just have the vote fail, and then count on the House to withdraw their own amendment?
Don Young comes down to the well to yell at presiding officer Doug Collins.		"Next time you bang that damn gavel..." he says, mad about when Collins closed the vote.		"I don't care!" he says. "It's not fair."		(Not sure whether he was mad that he closed it too fast or too slow.)
So based on the current attendance for these roll call votes, there are 212 Republicans, and 177 Democrats. So the threshold to passage in the House is 195.		Republicans can only lose 17. And they only have a few hours to whip.		Again, and then what?
House Republicans think they'll be able to pass a CR with border wall money.		I'm not so sure. Still a lot of absences, and I doubt any Democrats vote for it. But let's say they do. Senate rejects the bill, and then what?		 Anyway, good plan.		https://t.co/wgK8TPpNBZ
Doing a little math here.		We had 380 members vote this morning. A two-thirds majority to override the veto would be 255. We have 171 Dems here, and could probably get another four. (Call it 175.)		You'd need 80 Republicans to override the veto. Not impossible.

To think Republicans wouldn‚Äôt just strip the Yemen language from the rule and pass the farm bill within 4-24 hours later is the most legislatively naive statement I‚Äôve seen in my near decade covering Congress.
Oh no! We can‚Äôt let the rule setting up debate for the farm bill fail just because it includes language blocking a vote on Yemen!		All farm programs would lapse and Congress would never finish the bipartisan, bicameral legislation that lawmakers have been working on for years!
I have a Democratic Congressman who voted for the rule blocking a Yemen vote in my mentions telling Twitter users that the farm bill would have failed if the rule went down.		This is either absolute stupidity or shameless lying.		The farm bill was always gonna be fine, folks.
@Call_Me_Dutch @_El_Mendoza Is that a fact, or a guess?		(No, the farm bill was not going to fail if the rule was rejected, and with 16 years in Congress, I‚Äôm pretty sure you know they could do another rule pretty quickly.)

Collin Peterson ‚Äî the Democrat who's managing floor debate on the farm bill and led the small group of Dems to support the rule with Yemen language ‚Äî is wearing a pinstripe suit that looks like he sat on a freshly painted park bench and thought fast after popping a Mentos.
I've seen 3 of the f5 Democrats who voted for the farm bill rule blocking a Yemen vote speak on the floor in favor of the farm bill.		It's almost like they thought blocking the rule would have killed the farm bill. (It wouldn't have, it's just unbelievable shortsightedness.)

@JM_Ashby We hardly ever see Democrats vote for GOP rules.
Kind of amazing that Democrats bailed Republicans out on this one.		This was a clear winning issue for Democrats.		Does the voting public support Republicans sliding in language to a farm bill rule to subvert the War Powers Act and block any debate on Yemen?		Way to go, Congress.
@byrdinator It was 17 or 18 Republican noes, with 17 Republican absences.
The farm bill rule ‚Äî which unrelatedly blocks Yemen resolutions from getting a vote ‚Äî is narrowly adopted 206-203.		I believe five Democrats voted for the rule, saving Republicans from a self-inflicted failure.
We currently have 17 Republicans voting against the rule, but 5 Democrats voting for it.		Democrats handing Republicans a victory because, what, they think the farm bill wouldn‚Äôt eventually pass?
And we now have 15 Republicans voting no.		But a number of Democrats haven‚Äôt voted, and they gonna gavel quickly to adopt the rule.
One Republican just switched. They still need two.		Coincidentally, if two more of the six Democrats had shown up today, Democrats would have blocked the rule.
At 14 Republican noes. One more Republican could sink it.		(Reminder that they could hold this open and try to flip people too. It‚Äôs not like House of Cards.)
Republicans already have lost 13 votes right out of the gate.		If two more Republicans vote no, I think the rule will go down.
Alright. Here we go. Rule vote for the farm bill/to block any Yemen votes. 		By my count, with the vacancies we have today, Republicans can lose 14 and still adopt the rule.		I believe 206 will be the magic number.
This 15-minute vote has now been open for 30 minutes.
@Gkelly1193 That‚Äôs about right, yes, but it‚Äôs starting to feel longer than normal.
A lot of this rule vote ‚Äî because I do expect some Republicans to vote ‚Äî is gonna come down to what combination of lawmakers show up.		Right now, 20 Republicans haven‚Äôt voted on a previous procedural vote. But 12 Dems haven‚Äôt either.
Good afternoon from the House of Representatives! Lawmakers are about to vote on a rule for the farm bill that‚Äôd *also* waive portions of the War Powers Act to block a vote on Yemen.		Real question whether the rule is adopted. GOP vacancies, conservatives, and Dems could sink it.

@KarenAttiah You‚Äôre right.
It‚Äôs actually even more stunning than you think. The expectation was that OPEC would cut production by 1 million barrels of oil a day.		Not only did Trump fail to influence them to not do that, but they cut production by 1.2 million barrels.		And there‚Äôs still a dead journalist.
The point is: Trump didn‚Äôt get anything out of letting Saudi Arabia murder a Washington Post journalist ‚Äî he only debased himself and our country.		End of the day, Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC did what they wanted, which was to raise oil prices.		Art of the Deal not so much.
There was a lot of news yesterday ‚Äî including the bit that federal prosecutors believe Trump directed an employee to commit felonies on his behalf ‚Äî but I just wanted to revisit Trump thanking Saudi Arabia for low gas prices.

More words and thoughts on Pelosi winning the Democratic Caucus vote today:		https://t.co/6FP0bprSL6
DC band name idea: The No Votes.		(jk my band is just me in my apartment strumming chords to Bright Eyes songs...)
A cameraman just nudged me further back from this Kathleen Rice scrum and acted like I was somehow the jerk for being in his way.		What I literally said to him in response: ‚ÄúBuddy.‚Äù
Kathleen Rice says this isn‚Äôt about getting one specific person to be Speaker, or denying one specific person. She says the anti-Pelosi movement is about ‚Äúagitating for change.‚Äù
Kathleen Rice says members deserve to know when Pelosi plans to leave.		That now seems like the big fight ‚Äî whether Pelosi will have to announce a date of retirement. If she did, I think a crucial number of the anti-Pelosi Democrats would support her.
The real fight in Congress is not between Republicans and Democrats; it‚Äôs between cameramen and print reporters.
Rep. Tim Ryan‚Äôs take on the 35 Democrats who didn‚Äôt vote for Pelosi today: ‚ÄúTwice as many as you need.‚Äù		(A 203-32 vote with 3 blank ballots wasn‚Äôt exactly a resounding result for the anti-Pelosi group, but Ryan is technically correct.)
The tally is actually just a little worse for Pelosi than first reported:		It was 203-32, with 3 blank ballots and 1 absence.		(Democrats allow delegates to vote in caucus, though they won‚Äôt be allowed to vote on the floor.)
Pelosi wins the Caucus vote to be Speaker, 203-32.		She‚Äôs short of the 218 she needs on the floor in January, but this number really isn‚Äôt awful for her. 		We know of about 22 hard noes right now. The other 10 are probably just posturing. https://t.co/mQB8q9hThw
Kathleen Rice, one of the three anti-Pelosi members to meet with her today, says their concerns were ‚Äúdismissed outright.‚Äù		Pelosi isn‚Äôt looking to make any deals. https://t.co/W9iUrHZD4y
I asked Hakeem Jeffries why ageism didn‚Äôt have anything to do with him winning, considering he continues to make a case for ‚Äúgenerational change.‚Äù		In a non-answer answer, Jeffries said everyone made their own assessment as to why they voted the way they did.
Hakeem Jeffries is asked about Barbara Lee saying ageism and sexism had something to do with her losing the Dem Caucus Chair race.		Jeffries says the race was a ‚Äúfriendly competition of ideas.‚Äù
Question: Do you think ageism or sexism played a part in this race?		Barbara Lee: ‚ÄúWell, I think you heard and saw what took place. So I absolutely think that‚Äôs the case.‚Äù
Barbara Lee asked if ageism or sexism had to do with her losing her race to be Caucus Chair. 		She says she ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù thinks that was part of the reason.
Pretty close race between Hakeem Jeffries and Barbara Lee for Dem Caucus Chair.		Jeffries won, in part, by arguing for a younger Democratic leadership.		(Jeffries is also a guy to watch to one day ‚Äî sooner or later ‚Äî be Speaker.)		https://t.co/z59L02VLjh

The House map still looks pretty large to me for Democrats. A lot of potential pickups still out there.		The big numbers are still in play, I think, but settling into the 230-245 area imo.
Again, the House polling is looking pretty accurate to me, and a general rule of thumb of mine is sticking: If a Republican was at 47% in the most recent Upshot poll ‚Äî even if the Dem was at 46% ‚Äî they're probably going down.		See: Brat, David.
Down goes Rep. Pete Roskam (R-Ill.).		No real surprise there, but a very shrewd GOP member ‚Äî once the chief deputy whip with an eye toward one day being speaker ‚Äî who got behind the GOP health care bill and helped write the tax bill.
Looking like Abigail Spanberger is gonna defeat Dave Brat. 		Nearly 99% reporting and Spanberger is up almost 2,000 votes. I expect someone to call it any minute now.

If Spanberger and Luria pull it out in Virginia, you could still be looking at some pretty healthy Democratic gains in the House.		But the night for Democrats is gonna mostly depend on Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, and California ‚Äî which was probably always the case.
The Dave Brat-Abigail Spanberger race is still very tight.		Chesterfield, where she should pick up a few thousand votes, still hasn't completely reported.
Folks, there's still a long way to go before we really know anything. Let's talk after we see where Pennsylvania and New Jersey are at.		But yeah: The big numbers that Democrats were hoping for aren't looking so likely.
Well, folks, this is about the time of night where I think I‚Äôll note that I can see Republicans holding on to the House, maybe Democrats pick up a few seat majority.
Yet another fool's errand for the NRCC: They spent $1.5 million trying to hold an open Republican district that Clinton won by 19 points.		Democrat Donna Shalala just won it.		In the end, Shalala's perceived weakness was a benefit for Democrats. It gave the NRCC false hope.

I‚Äôll just say ‚Äî as I stand in line at a polling place that astoundingly has only one machine to receive ballots ‚Äî that long voting lines are maddening.		It‚Äôs a political choice that politicians inflict upon us for political reasons.		It shouldn‚Äôt and doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.

@peterjhasson Yeah, what you seemed most interested in was mutually working out how we correctly categorize support for Steve King among elected Republicans. Aw shucks. I guess that snowflake just couldn‚Äôt handle a dialogu, huh?
@peterjhasson Not policing, just think it illustrates my point. People who don‚Äôt support Steve King ‚Äî presumably like you, like Jerry ‚Äî still go out and support the Republicans who do, like Ted Cruz.		And you weren‚Äôt asking a question. Your follow up tweet wasn‚Äôt about starting some dialogue.
@NerdNeuro That is actually how I‚Äôll die.
I think my favorite part about this guy trying to own me is that one of the people who gleefully retweeted him ‚Äî @JerryDunleavy ‚Äî used to work for Ted Cruz.		Ted Cruz personally called Steve King and offered him his support. https://t.co/FYFX3klVWb
@mirandayaver What if doing ‚Äúyou know what‚Äù at Dairy Queen is actually ‚Äúsupporting white nationalists.‚Äù
@peterjhasson Um, sure. It‚Äôll also be ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù to see what people say *after* the election.		But it‚Äôs pretty hard to argue that Republicans haven‚Äôt had a chance to say or do anything about Steve King. This has been years in the making and they have stood by him.		See also: Donald Trump.
He died doing what he loved: Getting into a Twitter argument after midnight with some dude who‚Äôs willfully misrepresenting the support Steve King has among elected Republicans because he doesn‚Äôt want to associate his party with white nationalism.		(This is very specific, I know.)
@peterjhasson Not at all. Paul Ryan is very consciously choosing not to say anything.		Although I will note he‚Äôs been ‚Äúexplicitly‚Äù asked about King in the past and he refused to say anything critical, so I‚Äôm happy to say he explicitly supports Steve King if you‚Äôd like.
@peterjhasson ‚ÄúSome‚Äù in the first case means two elected Republicans.		Your demand that we carefully note the *two* instances of Republicans distancing themselves from King obscures that *hundreds* of other congressional Republicans have stood by him ‚Äî financially, explicitly, or tacitly.
@peterjhasson On the one hand, you Steve Stivers and [checks notes] Carlos Curbelo. On the other, you have President Donald Trump, Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen.Ted Cruz, Sen. Chuck Grassl
@peterjhasson Not really. Name another Republican who‚Äôs disowned him. Carlos Curbelo?		And if you wanna go shot for shot, I‚Äôll be happy to point out how many Republicans have financially contributed to King and how many are explicitly standing by him, like the President and House GOP leaders.

The unhinged rantings of a President aside, the rocket ship to blimp thing feels a little like a Kanye lyric. https://t.co/aAaN3FY581
I'll end this thread here.		My final point is that, contrary to claims that no one would have been affected by the pre-existing conditions waivers, the CBO projected that about half of America's population lives in states that would have eventually implemented those waivers.
The bill also would have defunded Planned Parenthood.		(It very cleverly did this by preventing federal funds from going to an organization that met very specific criteria. The CBO report actually said it only expected Planned Parenthood to be affected.)
Essentially, there was a more rigid formula for the tax credits in the AHCA. The tax credits were more determined on age and income rather than how much insurance costs in your state.		So for some people, that could have also dramatically raised prices.
The AHCA also would have decreased the tax credits to pay for insurance for some people.		For some states ‚Äî like Alaska ‚Äî that would have been a huge deal, because the bill also would have made the tax credits less dependent on differing prices in states.
The AHCA would have also allowed insurers to charge older people a lot more than they charge younger people.		Under current law, insurers can charge older people three times as much as the young. Under the AHCA, insurers could have charged older people five times as much.
The AHCA would have also allowed states to convert Medicaid to a block grant program. That would have inevitably raised prices on Medicaid recipients.		And states would have also likely had to tighten eligibility requirements and reduced benefits to make the cuts work.
Another huge item we don't talk about enough is the Medicaid cuts.		The AHCA would have cut over $800 billion in funding for Medicaid, resulting in 14 million fewer people with insurance.		Think about that: The GOP health care bill contained an $800 billion cut to Medicaid.
The EHB provisions are particularly interesting because it could have dramatically changed insurance for people on employer-sponsored plans.		Essentially, if your state got a waiver to redefine EHBs, insurers could have decided things like hospitalization wouldn't be covered.
One item we now don't hear about enough is how the AHCA would have changed Essential Health Benefits.		EHBs are a list of 10 services insurers must cover, like emergency services, prescription drugs and maternity care.		AHCA would have allowed states to redefine EHBs w/ a waiver.
First of all, yes, the GOP health care bill would have undermined protections for people with pre-existing conditions.		Despite what some Republicans are saying now, a key part of the bill was allowing states to waive certain protections if they set up high-risk pools.
As much as Democrats are running on health care, I still feel like a few aspects of the GOP health care bill have been lost to time. 		We all know it risked raising prices on people with pre-existing conditions, but it did a lot more than that.		A short thread:

18 times now.		We're in the closing remarks, so this might be it, but yeah, mentioning Nancy Pelosi 18 times in a debate ‚Äî far more than the times he's mentioned Abigail Spanberger's name.		Oh, wait, 19 times!		Check that: 20 times.		That'll be his last mention, folks.
16 times.		The groans have become laughs.		And now it's 17 times.
15 times now.		I'm not sure Dave Brat has realized the crowd thinks it's weird that he's mentioned Nancy Pelosi so much ‚Äî they're actually groaning ‚Äî but either way, he's pressing ahead.
13 times now.		On this latest mention, people guffawed, so Brat ‚Äî per the rules on interruptions ‚Äî asked for an additional 10 seconds.		Oh, and it's 14 times now.
12 times.		It's feeling a bit...forced.
@brfreed There are multiple measures of PPM.		PPM with minutes that Brat has spent talking, and overall PPM. 		Overall PPM easier, but a less reliable statistic.
Ten times.		I hadn't even finished my last tweet before he mentioned it again.		And he did it again.		Now we're at 11 on times Dave Brat has mentioned Nancy Pelosi in this debate.
Nine times.		I'm not sure he's realized that the crowd is actually groaning every time he does this.		The moderator just asked the crowd to not do that, and instead make their voices heard at the polls.
Dave Brat claims the Washington Post gave Abigail Spanberger four pinocchios on her claims about health care.		That claim itself is untrue. The WaPo fact checker has asked that Brat's campaign take down their false press release. They still haven't.
Eight times now.		The groans are getting louder.
@baseballcrank Is your point that you think Obamacare was bipartisan, or is this just some partisan whataboutism to illustrate that some Democrats once also falsely claimed a bill was bipartisan?		I'm honestly confused.
Seven times now.		Dave Brat got more laughs and groans on the sixth mention, so he asked for more time and picked it back up at Nancy Pelosi for that seventh mention.
If you have a bill that does 40 different things and three of those things were once supported by *some* Democrats, but the bill itself was never supported by *any* Democrat, yeah, I'm not sure you get to call that bipartisan.
Dave Brat claims the Goodlatte bill was bipartisan because...elements of it...were once...supported by Democrats...		No Democrat in the House supported the Goodlatte bill...or helped write it...sooo not quite bipartisan by any traditional standard ‚Äî or really any standard at all.
Dave Brat has now mentioned Nancy Pelosi five times.
Times when you can use the phrase "I look forward to answering your questions":		-Opening statement of congressional testimony.	-Opening statement of a House race debate.	-When you're being deposed by your spouse's lawyer because your spouse thinks you're cheating but you're not.
Two mentions of Nancy Pelosi within the first 45 seconds of Dave Brat's opening statement.		Man, someone should do a podcast on this.

Did Brett Kavanaugh know it was over when he asked Amy Klobuchar if she had ever blacked out?		When exactly did Bork know it was over?
Again, Kavanaugh claims he didn't know Ford.		She somehow:		-Began telling people about this assault years ago	-Came up with a story involving Kavanaugh and his friends (who she supposedly didn't know)	-Contacted her Congresswoman before he was nominated		That's some conspiracy!
Can we get clarification on what "skis" means?
OH conversation between two members, as they pass: ‚Äú...the WASPs at Phillips Exeter...‚Äù
To believe Brett Kavanaugh, you also have to believe he's never blacked out, which he just testified under oath has never happened.
Another thing Kavanaugh just said: He raised the point that he couldn't have been drinking on a day when he was working out at Tobin's house.		And yet, July 1, he works out at Tobin's house and *also* has "skis" at Timmy's house later.
And by the way, not sure what ‚ÄúSkis" means ‚Äî maybe ‚Äúbrewskis‚Äù? ‚Äî but if he was drinking that night, weird, because that wasn‚Äôt a weekend night. https://t.co/PL9Q4EKFMp
I missed this before, but I was just looking at Kavanaugh‚Äôs calendar, and I noticed that he‚Äôs hanging out on July 1, among a few other people, with ‚ÄúPJ‚Äù and ‚ÄúJudge.‚Äù		Pretty amazing coincidence that Ford, before she saw the calendars, said PJ and Mark Judge were there. https://t.co/8lXwiROHiO
The idea that Kavanaugh couldn't have been at a small party during the week is undercut by his own testimony and calendars.		He says he did hang out occasionally and have beers with friends during the week, but where's that on the calendar?		A 6-person party isnt exactly a rager.
