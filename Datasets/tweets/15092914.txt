@crenshaw_alyssa "...accompanied by whipped cream, sweetened and flavored with vanilla."	Definitely sounds like something worthy of a reception!
@crenshaw_alyssa This recipe is preceded by "Breakfast Cocoa," in which half the milk is replaced with water. The 1925 book 'Chocolate and cocoa recipes' references the original recipe and adds it should be served in place of hot chocolate at afternoon teas or receptions (1/2)
Theobroma cacao is the botanical name for the tree that bears the pods that hold the beans that become cocoa and chocolate. This image is of that cacao pod, from 'Flore médicale' (v.2, 1833) in @BioDivLibrary: https://t.co/UUug7OALtN #HotCocaDay https://t.co/w4KPM7OjvV
