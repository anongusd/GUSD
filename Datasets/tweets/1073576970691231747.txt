@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn I hope you never have to have an abortion and if you find yourself contemplating one in a late term that you make the right decision.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn I agree it shouldn‚Äôt be the government‚Äôs call, but a moral call. How many abortions are done because a women feels she is incapable of raising a child (Emotionally or financially).
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn Drs are not God.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn We need consistency in our laws, but am concerned they are not consistently applied. The definition of life threatening issues could be different and Drs can make mistakes.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn You‚Äôre right, I don‚Äôt need a OB/GYN. LOL. I hope you‚Äôre not making fun of my age.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn In the Dark ages they sacrificed babies like today. So don‚Äôt lecture me about taking us back to the dark ages.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn Yeah, but Dems are supporting late term abortions that many Americans object to. What I dislike is our Congressmen and women ignoring the will of the people and thinking they know better. They will be held accountable at election time and we all will be accountable before God.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn I trust my Doctors or I wouldn‚Äôt go to them.
@_kayla_bayla__ @MarshaBlackburn So it is for health reasons. Do you have any information on what we‚Äôre the life threatening issues?  Do you know how many third term abortions were done last year?
