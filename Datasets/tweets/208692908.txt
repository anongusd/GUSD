From Hurricanes #Katrina to #Maria, we know that natural disasters exacerbate the struggles of vulnerable populations.  They were the hardest hit last year and are still struggling to return to normalcy.
My Q to FEMA continues to be: ‚ÄòAre we ready for what‚Äôs next?‚Äô TBH, I have never been more concerned that the answer from the Trump Administration appears to be no. @FEMA can and must do better.
I do not see the urgency from the Administration to prepare for what may come.  @FEMA will say that they have learned from last year‚Äôs devastating storms, but it seems they are just hoping for the best. This year could be worse than last.
THREAD from Ranking Member @BennieGThompson on the start of the 2018 #HurricaneSeason:		LAST SEASON was unfortunately one of the most active, costly, &amp; dangerous to date. It exposed FEMA is woefully unprepared to help when the nation faces simultaneous natural disasters.

The practice of separating children from parents as a deterrent is inhumane &amp; cruel. Seeking asylum is not illegal and is written into US immigration laws to ensure that those w/a credible fear of persecution can present their case. #FamiliesBelongTogether

The Task Force on Election Security has solutions, but Congress must act fast.
Replacing outdated voting systems takes time and funding. We cannot assume these systems are secure enough to withstand a sophisticated state-sponsored cyber attack, and do not believe attacks will stop
HAVA costs $3 billion.  The Election Security Act would cost $1.8 billion.  If we can spend $3.6 billion to fight hanging chads, surely we can spend half of that to fight the Russian government.
The Task Force‚Äôs $1.8 billion package will protect our votes against the Russian government. Price tag seem high? In 2002, Congress authorized $3.6 billion to fight hanging chads. We cannot ask our State and local election officials to take on a threat like Russia alone
Tomorrow, the Task Force will release a final report and legislation that outline steps we must take to ensure our elections are secure come election day.
Time is short: our 2018 and 2020 elections are just around the corner. If Russia can attack our election, so can others ‚Äì possibly North Korea, Iran, or China. The next Federal election is only 265 days away, it is high time we start thinking about enacting real solutions.
If we do nothing, of course they will continue to meddle in our elections!
The Trump Administration refuses to enforce the sanctions passed by Congress ‚Äì sending the message that it is OK to interfere in our elections.
WE KNOW: 1) Russia will continue targeting US voting systems 2) These systems are vulnerable, many over a decade old. 3) No federal funding means states can‚Äôt upgrade election systems to secure our elections and protect your vote. WE DON‚ÄôT KNOW: Will Republicans Act?
Last week, Secretary of State Tillerson and CIA Director Pompeo made clear that Russia will target this year‚Äôs mid-term elections as they have continued to observe Kremlin activity
.Today, DNI Coats warned that our elections are still under attack, urging that there needs to be a ‚Äúnational cry‚Äù for ensuring that Russia will not dictate how we vote. Protecting our elections is about making sure foreign governments are not hijacking American votes
The Congressional Task Force on Election Security has worked diligently over the last 7 months to defend against Russia. The integrity of our democracy depends on the strength of our elections. THREAD üëáüèΩ

Clearly @POTUS is trying to use TPS as the latest bargaining chip in his anti-immigrant agenda.  It is now critical that Congress act and #SaveTPS. This is simply the right thing to do.
Forcing Salvadorans out of the only country many of them have ever known would not only upend their lives and potentially subject them to terrible violence in El Salvador, but would have a destructive effect on our communities and our Nation‚Äôs economy.
Decision to cancel Temporary Protected Status for Salvadorans is just the latest in a string of heartless, xenophobic actions from the Trump Administration. Many have been here for decades, have American citizen children, &amp; have deep economic and family ties here.
Americans overwhelmingly agree that legalization &amp; citizenship for #Dreamers is right &amp; is what Congress should be focused on. Dems welcome the opportunity to work w the @WhiteHouse on these important issues but not while @POTUS continually threatens these innocent young people.
This latest cynical effort to use #DACA as a bargaining chip to secure @POTUS's fantasy of a closed immigration system &amp; an unnecessary border wall is a new low. These demands are non-starters for Democrats and only show us that the President is not acting in good faith.

Even though #PuertoRico is far away &amp; has no power, speaks Spanish, this is not a PR campaign for POTUS, WH &amp; DHS to spin their way out of.
Lives are on the line &amp; people are dying in PR. Painfully clear fed response is woefully inadequate &amp; Trump Admin. is not doing enough.
Our FELLOW US citizens in #PuertoRico and #USVI are in the midst of a worsening humanitarian crisis &amp; they need MORE help now.
INEXCUSABLE @POTUS is in NJ, far from WH, attacking victims on Twitter when he only has ONE HOUR on schedule today for hurricane response
Attacking #PuertoRico &amp; its leaders as they desperately beg for @POTUS help in their hour of need is just pathetic.
POTUS attacks today on #PuertoRico are unsurprising &amp; quite predictable even with the-not so-subtle veil of racism and sexism.

#SecretService Should Investigate #Trump Comments, Rep. Thompson Says https://t.co/idsKC7celg @bpolitics @business
All threats should be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.
The comments made by Trump should not be dismissed as a joke or considered careless. This is more than just a tweet.
Statements such as those made by Trump have the potential to inspire other possible bad actors to plan and attempt to carry out violence.
Incendiary rhetoric by Trump should be given the same attention as other threats made against the @SecretService protectees.
Any personal threat to cause harm, along with the encouragement of others to cause harm, is a serious offense. This applies to everyone.
FYI - The law states that anyone who knowingly threatens harm to a candidate for President shall be subject to a fine and/or imprisonment

We know that the common thread between the most recent attacks‚Äì inspired by foreign &amp; domestic actors- were radicalization &amp; assault weapons
Speaker Ryan &amp; GOP leadership continue to approve empty gestures posing as legislation instead of bringing up a vote on sensible gun control
We must be able to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. Members of Congress, the Administration, and the American public recognize this
There is an issue common to the attacks in #Orlando, #SanBernardino, #Charleston, #Dallas‚Äîthe availability of assault weapons to terrorists
Republicans criticize administration officials for not using ‚Äúradical Islamist terrorism‚Äù but the fixation on that phrase is misplaced.
Those who focus on 1 ideology or group (ISIL) run the risk of leaving us vulnerable to attacks by other foreign or domestic terrorist groups
