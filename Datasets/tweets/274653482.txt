and historians estimate that more than 5,000 Cherokee died as a result of the forced march. The first, actual Americans .
The phrase "Trail of Tears" originated from a description of the removal of the Cherokee Nation in 1838 they marched the Indians more than 1,200 miles to Indian territory. Whooping cough, typhus, dysentery, cholera and starvation were epidemic along the way,
The Trail of Tears was a series of forced relocations of Native American nations in the United States following the Indian Removal Act of 1830.	The removal included members of the Cherokee, Muscogee, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw nations.
