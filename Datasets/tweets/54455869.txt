I listened to the governor of NJ blame meteorologists, and his predecessor on another radio station as hosts there said they wished he was still in charge.  He neither slammed nor defended his successor.
The driver of this industrial van tried to go the wrong way up a major Secaucus street and ended up blocking the ambulance on the left for several minutes.  Its lights and siren were on (I took this while pulled over for a while, waiting for the ambulance to be able to pass). https://t.co/FC6vPwKrDv
Residential neighborhoods were overrun with drivers, many like me counting on their GPS when major roads were useless.  The worst was in Secaucus.
Back in Manhattan, after six hours of relentless #Snowvember gridlock across North Jersey.  Detouring through countless neighborhoods in between sitting on paralyzed highways.  I‚Äôve never seen it that bad in the northeast, or in my native California on its worst day.

@JaeSwoon Unfortunately, fed courts don't allow electronic recording.  We appreciate the fact they let us use computers today in the overflow courtroom.

@hlnkim @wcbs880 Federal courts don't generally allow electronic recording.  We were fortunate in the overflow courtroom to be allowed to use laptops and WiFi.
2/2 to the handful who decided to play troll with their personal insults, you're probably not seeing this now.  Happy to block rude people.  Hope others appreciated the 150+ play-by-play tweets.  It's rare that federal courts allow us to do something like that.
1/2 To those who asked sincerely... I didn't tweet the sentence out right away for a few reasons.  1. Better right than first. 2. Radio audience gets priority --- I don't get paid by Twitter.  3. Our station reported confirmed sentencing info promptly.

Judge: During remand proceedings, Shkreli made statements about wanting to have non-consensual sex with a journalist, and had solicited violence against Hillary Clinton.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880

Judge:  I'm aware father came every day to court	    #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  Want to help people after they're released from prison.  Please give me a chance to show what I'm capable of.  And with that, Shkreli is done.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli on seeing people in jail: "This has been a life changing experience... helping these inmates is a silver lining.  They know me from media.  They know me, they like me."    #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  "I owe it to him to not let him down.  Prison has been a heartbreaking experience.  I'm not gonna complain about life in jail."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli breaks down again as he thanks his def atty Ben Brafman.      #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli: "I got carried away... wanted to be a success in the business world.  Immature. Much more I can do... the right way."    #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli: "As I look at the long road ahead, I want to make sure I get the tools to rehabilitate... I don't want to let anyone down again."   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli: "The time for debate and litigation is over.  But the people who took the time to write letters know the real me.  I don't think the govt knows the real me."   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Tearful Shkreli: "I believe the prosecution's mischracterized many of the things I've done.  Many things in sentencing memorandum categorically false... won't be baited into the mud." Cites IRS docs, etc.    #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli now sobbing:  "Those who looked up to me... reassess my position.  This is my fault."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  No conspiarcy by govt.  "I took down Martin Shkreli"  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli chokes up as he apologizes to investors.  "I did not act appropriately." #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli: I'm pleased to hear the court is not holding my personality on trial.   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli: I've learned.. not the same person I was.  Know the difference between right and wrong.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  In 2015, I started a new company.  I demanded every investor sign disclosures.   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  I was never motivated by money.  I wanted to grow my stature and reputation.   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  I made many mistakes managing funds. Not sure I recognize that person.   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli:  grave mistakes of poor judgment led me here today  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
BREAKING: SHKRELI NOW SPEAKING #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Shkreli made the choice.  He needs to be stopped.  Society needs to be protected.  With that, govt ends.
Govt: You don't get to cherry pick who you are before the court.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: case abt sending broader message - can't lie to people for years and rip them off and steal from somewhere else to pay them back.  Can't make mockery of justice system.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Judge - I've reviewed Shkrel's objections to sentencing reports.   Also reviewed 55 letters of support from defense team and govt's concerns.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: not challenging he's smart, but it's the aftermath. There's nothing illegal with respect to drug hikes, but recognize he is not purely altruistic, out to save mankind.  He is not (their savior).  Insult to docs and researchers who've worked for cures without worrying abt $
Govt: Tried not to make drug hike a big part of this trial when frankly we had reason to do so. Wanted case to be about crimes he committed, but we did bring up bc what motivates him is money.  THat's what he said.  He can't get away from those statements.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli
Govt: This talk of him having potential.  A significant term in prison won't deny the world of cures to childhood diseases.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt notes Shkreli's family in courtroom, including dad. Psych eval shows he cannot tolerate failure.  Strongly urge judge to consider how he deals with situations that challenge his self image.  That's not a mental health issue.  He has no interest in changing.  #PharmaBro
Govt rejects mental health issues - says he suffered depression &amp; anxiety, as do many people who live and work in NC, went thru 9/11.  Doesn't excuse his behavior,  He is getting pharmaceutical treatment in jail. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: He continues to think this is all just one big joke.  Jail has not gotten to him yet because he thinks he'll get out in six months.  Public needs to be protected from Martin Shkreli.  "he is dangerous," believes ends justify means.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Emails just weeks ago "hell get probation.. time at Club Fed,"  Those emails are devastating because that's who he is... Martin Shkreli, the good, the bad and the ugly.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt - he mocked the jury.  Went back to harassing people online.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Shkreli had to be babysat by defense team.  He is not a child.  Shkreli is about to turn 35 years old.  He's a man.  He's not a teenager or college kid who needs mentoring.  Needs to take responsibility for his actions.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Shkreli claims are "absurd."  He refuses to take responsibility for his actions b/c he doesn't want to.  What is clear before and during trial, no respect for victims.  Mocked victims, mocked court.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: He is no better than any  other fraudster.  As to notion he'll never commit fraud again, said months ago in emails that he knew we could read said he'd do anything and everything to get lowest sentence possible.  What he wrote to court half-hearted attempt to act remorseful
Govt: He wants everyone to think he's a genius, biotech wonder.  That image is everything to him.  He needs to be mythical, larger than life rags to riches story.  That image is hius mansion, mazzerati, cars, above all else.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Really contest the idea of "no victims."  This is also about why he stole money for his personal benefit.  He did in fact steal that money for his personal benefit.  What motivates Martin Shkreli is his own image.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: These are not victimless crimes.  Stole from investors, stole $10M from Retrofin (sp) - company he called his "baby." "He stole $10M from his baby," could have gone toward curing diseases he was supposedly so concerned about.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: he lied repeatedly to numerous victims.  Not a moment in time statement he made in response to stress.  He tailored those lies to each victim, because he knew what they wanted to hear.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: His good deeds show he has capacity to make good choices.  He's just chosen not to do that.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Our sentencing submission could have been a lot worse.  We didn't go through years of tweets that we could  have.  Focused on what he said and did.  Not saying he's a bad person with capital B or that he's the devil... #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: His own words, his own acts, all of that is fair game.  That is the record you have before you. Best indicator of what he's done, will do in future.  That's what we are relying upon.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Second, govt says, characteristics of defendant.  Shkreli doesn't seem to understand why he's here, scope of what he's done.  Def wants to focus just on good acts.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Four different fraud schemes over five years.  Lies and deceipt -- Govt.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Those schemes over course of years, not a lapse of judgment.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt: Shkreli is a convicted criminal, we didn't say it was because he was a little off or strange.  He was convicted of 3 of 4 fraud schemes.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Govt now up.  Prosecutor responding to defense.  Judge: Why 15 years reasonable?  Govt - not typical for us to deviate.  We didn't just make that number up.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: If you accept our recommendation... I think it's a better result certainly for Shkreli, but also for a lot of people.  With that defense ends.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: With Shkreli in jail, I've seen him to do good.  He can do that in a hospital, in a research lab.  Because he understands what it's like to be in prison.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: We are going to be filing an appeal.  There are some live issues.  To extend Martin has expressed apology that govt demands I'm sorry he hasn't.  I've been up for days thinking about it. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: Martin has had remorse smacked in his face every day in jail.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: Martin was grinning into camera, and so was I, to be candid.  I've had a lot of acquittals.  Shkreli work some of the best work I think our team has done.  You can seee him grinning, govt had serious look despite conviction. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def wrapping up, says govt suggests Shkreli hasn't expressed remorse.  When verdict came in, we were all stunned.  When we left bldg before we had understanding of how judge would compute laws, we thought there might be way to compute loss issue.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: When you sentence Mr. Shkreli, it's real prison.  Despite fact he sometimes says stupid things.  At end of day, he doesn't belong there, and doesn't belong there for significant amt of time. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: He will most likely serve his sentence in another violent place.  Judge: Are you asking me to re-consider decision (to jail him)?  Def: Made be eligible for modified level of security. He has already served 6 mos in equivalent of max security. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: "Martin now is deemed to be a safety concern... he is no longer eligible to be serving his time in a camp."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: "He's not okay.  He's in a violent place."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: "It just can't be the 15 years that the govt is asking for."  Again calls it Draconian,  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli Investor with MS asks that Shkreli be punished in a way that helps society - defense.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def reads letter from an investor who he says made a lot of money and has Multiple Sclerosis.  Says "I've come to know him relatively well.. a genius but extremely understood."  Says Shkreli is to blame for that.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: Despite all the stupid stuff he does that gets ppl to write about him, that is not the whole picture.  It's a picture that's extraordinary in many ways.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def speaking of Shkreli's charity work: To meet govt's threshold of extraordinary circumstances, you have to be Mother Teresa.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: If he's closely monitored, he can do wonderful things (for science) #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def atty Ben Brafman: Part of the problem is the persona he tried to develop in the media, the YouTube/Facebook world.   Govt has urged you to use things that don't reflect who he really is.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def Atty: Govt has cherry picked from thousands of emails by the defendant, they have essentially taken a cpl of statements.   #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def Atty: Statement by Shkreli's brother, who lives at home with parents, writes at end "I think Martin may be difficult to understand simply because there's no one else like him."  Def says "doesn't that ring true?  I'm trying to save his life."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: "He has potential to do good..."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def to Judge - I read letters again last night.  One from man who heard about him from news, seemed contemptible.  Man starts writing him,  Martin asks him not for contraband, but to help acquire teaching materials.. dictionaries, self-help books.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: Lamar Mulligan's letter says "I am currently one of his students at (jail) in Brooklyn... Martin has been the most positive and influential" part of inmate's experience.  "He's always excited to teach these classes...he talks about his remorse." #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: What Dr. Salzberg is suggesting is what I hope we do: Find a way to fix him, get him the help he needs.  Won't get that if he's in prison for a long time.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: To his credit, how does Shkreli spend his time?  Govt doesn't mention that he helps inmates, buys them books, teaches classes in basic math.  So many redeeming qualities in these letters.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: Govt suggesting you take this man who is flawed and somewhat broken, and you toss him away. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: Martin believes what he is saying to be true, Martin sees the world through rose-colored glasses... that's from a witness who wasn't sympathetic.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: The issues involving what used to be called Asperger's... doctor said over and over he reminded him of Rain Man b/c of fixation on details.  That's just not true. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def atty: One of the things I see in gov't memo: powerful, eloquent letters on impact Shkreli had on lives.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Judge... except to extent we had to deal with bail revocation.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def Atty: I ask... that you not sentence Martin Shkreli b/c he's Martin Shrkeli.  Judge: I assure you his online presence... comments he's made outside court were not evident in court.  He behaved respectully in court.  I understand Daraprim pricing is not an issue for me.
Def: there is a method to the madness w/respect to what the jurors did (he was acquitted of several charges). #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def atty: Never been in sec fraud case where victims made 2, 3,4 sometimes 10 times there money.  In a Ponzi scheme, there is no happy ending.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def atty: When you are in effect dealing with facts in this case... all of us would agree there's something unique about this case b/c he was acquitted on 5 counts.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Defense: This defendant is a first time offender.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def atty: Saying with modesty, I've never seen securities fraud case like this and I don't think gov't has.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def Atty: My hope is you (judge) are somewhere below gov't application and closer to ours.  "This is an interesting man with great potential."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
It's a made up number? Why 15 years?  - Def. Atty says.  Very devoid of compassion or rehabilitation.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def: I think what gov has done is paint a dark picture of Martin Shkreli.. calls a possible 15 yr sentence "Draconian."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Def Atty: He may have some degree of social awkwardness... sort of like kids today who hit send before they really understand what they've texted.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
"He shouldn't be sentenced simply for being Martin Shkreli... I'm old enough to be his father.... times I want to hug and hold him, times I want to punch him in the face for some of the things he's said."  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli Atty Brafman: "Quite frankly, I've got my begging voice on" suggesting 15 year sentence would not be appropriate.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli atty - other issue, w/press of button, anyone can learn about him.  Important that record contain not only bad things, record should reflect -- and he deserves.. the quite extraordinary things abt him be on record as well. #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli atty Ben Brafman says while he has arguments with govt's position, he has no personal issues with prosecutors or court.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli leaning over to talk with one of his other lawyers.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Shkreli has answered two questions calmly, composed.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Judge invites statement from Shkreli.   Defense wants to wait before he speaks to judge... #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Judge asks Shkreli if he's satisfied with legal team, he says yes.  Judge says he appears fully alert.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Judge - I've reviewed Shkrel's objections to sentencing reports.   Also reviewed 55 letters of support from defense team and govt's concerns.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880
Victim wants $778.000+ from Shkreli.  #PharmaBro #Shkreli @wcbs880

We are watching in overflow room.  Judge says restitution is mandatory.
