@StreetsblogUSA @bikewalktulsa Design roadways for motor vehicles.  Kill peds.  Simple as that.  Not rocket science.
@StreetsblogUSA @bikewalktulsa It's the victim pedestrians' fault, because @gtbynum main roadway design dude Paul Zachary signs off on roadways designed for motor vehicles, NOT walkers, who aren't with the program.  Great job, @TulsaPolice !  It's all the pedestrians' fault, dammit.

I once had to take my faithful dog, Bella, to the shelter, because I couldn't afford to keep her warm or fed.  That was one of the toughest days of my life.  I still remember it like yesterday. https://t.co/PVjAtUo3iF
@jonechols Hey, man, your palie from #Yes788 Unc Grump is AWOL.  Where da fucking SNITCH at?  For his sake, he'd do well to shave, leave State, and find other endeavors.  Bikers got a hit contract on his HIDE.
Attention challengers: When you announce candidacy, I'll release the video of me breeding your slut honky white wife and your daughter(s). Run for public office, get your family humiliated by opponent.  This is the new normal in American politics.  Get use to it. That is all.

@CherieDeVille when he announces his candidacy.  Game on?
@CherieDeVille My Repugnant challenger will be Scott Pruitt.  He's the fucking EPA prick who racked up millions of your tax dollars to remodel his office.  45 dumped his ass.  He's way toxic to just about everything you stand for.  I'd like to do a scene where I fuck his wife,

@RepMullin Hey, man, you look John Wayne Bobbit #Buff.  Why don'tcha take off yer pants for the cameras?  We know you already getting pussy.  Quit being #HYPOCRITE. All you muthafuckaaaas do, right?  #CongressionalPrivilege
@haleyhughey @KTULNews Snowflake sooooo stupid.  The reason she won is because Daniel Regan was such a lazy ass, who didn't walk in 106 degree summer heat with a first trimester baby.  Daniel showed up to file Declaration of Candidacy with NO proper paperwork.  #ResignNow
I will not be referring to my Democrap or Repugnant challengers by name.  They will simply be Democrap or Repugnant nominee.
I challenge the Repugnant and Democrap nominees and Senator @jameslankford to sign the affidavit to DIVEST stocks of companies that interact with their committees.  #NoBSZone
#NoFucksLeft This is kind of CRAP my Repugnant challenger will continue as a Senate tradition.  I call #BS  https://t.co/bmPezwX7Em
My ground operatives have already identified my Repugnant and Democrap challengers.  I'm gonna EAT them alive to call out their #BS.
Most US Senators become millionaires, using information from their committee assignments, such as my good friend and mentor, Senator @JimInhofe. How much is Senator @jameslankford worth now?  Well, I intend to be a porn star, because of my service to Unc Sam.  #NoHypocriteZone
Inspired by Mary Carey, previous California Gubernatorial candidate, @CherieDeVille current run for POTUS 46, and of course, 45, I'm all #IN for US Senate 2020.  I DESPISE hypocrites in all their forms and I intend to call them out at every opportunity I get.  Watch me ROAR!
