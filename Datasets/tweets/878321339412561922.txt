@Lhultin Yeah, I know. I almost had a damn heart attack when I found out Lombardi traded him along WITH a draft choice for BEN BISHOP, he of the 7 whole games with the Kings. The kid is only 21 years old and is playing regulary. 😳😳😳😳

Lions will make a huge mistake letting this guy go. Perfect complement to Johnson, great on special teams, with Riddick the Lions have a strong rotation, along with the rookie fullback who was injured, who is also a very good receiver. Keep these guys, use FA/draft on OLine, DL.
@LLamorandier When the Lions did trust Zenner to shoulder a heavier load, he responded well: in seven career games with 10 or more rushing attempts, he racked up 416 yards on the ground and scored six times. @ttwentyman @davebirkett @Justin_Rogers @paulapasche https://t.co/pHtp46DPHG

@tyingsalty I agree with any effective action to fight climate change. And I worked in education 27 years and was a principal for ten. Those teachers mishandled that situation and arguing with the Senator after she took time to answer them was not appropriate.
@tyingsalty @DianaRVA1 @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein What the video captured, if you are talking about the full video and not the attack edit, was a Senator stopping to talk to what she thought were young kids and instead got ambushed by adults and an older teen. Those teachers were irresponsible.

@tyingsalty @DianaRVA1 @tommyxtopher @SenFeinstein No, it's because we had a perfect storm of assumption by Hillary, Bernie, Jill and a few others and Trump and GOP reaped the benefits.

@RNCastaldo @LincolnFresno @realDonaldTrump LOL @LincolnFresno Blows the idea we democrats are for open borders, but does highlight employers like Trump who hire illegal immigrants!!! Never mentions the Vanity Wall either! Well done !! 🤣
@LeesWarhorse @auntoona Also, McCabe briefed Devin Nunes and Paul Ryan about their investigation of the President. It was a classified briefing and 6 other leaders were there. There was no objection or disagreement, other than Devin Nunes likely running to the White House to tell Trump.
@LeesWarhorse @auntoona He did say he fired Comey because of the "Russia thing." There is video tape of him saying that. You're wrong.
@LeesWarhorse @auntoona The Director briefed the President on any issues that arose from within the FBI until the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Since then, the Director reports in an additional capacity to the Director of National Intelligence. He is not a low level person.
Wow I sure hope he follows through on this. We will get to see Trump appointees like Rosenstein and Wray get up and confirm what McCabe said. Bet he never holds one hearing on this. Just like they were going to investigate the FISA court. 🙄 https://t.co/MyCePp2zPs
@jonswaine Great job. Here comes the total gag order. Dumbass believes Trump will pardon him, I'm sure.
@LeesWarhorse @auntoona The FBI reports directly to the President of the United States. For very good reasons. Now do you get it??
@LincolnFresno @CillizzaCNN The black people who elected him decided they'd judge him by his record, not something he did twenty years ago.

@LeesWarhorse @auntoona You don't seem to understand the FBI director's position. They receive a ten year commission. When Trump fired Comey BECAUSE of the Russian investigation, that screamed out for investigation. How hard is that to understand?
@LeesWarhorse @auntoona The Director of the FBI is appointed to a ten-year term. Their chain of command answers to the Constitution of the United States. Your analogy is inaccurate. We have a 25th Amendment for just this situation.
@LeesWarhorse @auntoona He was the acting director of the FBI. And Rosenstein was appointed by Trump as Deputy AG. What low level people are you talking about?
@charliekirk11 Opinion | It’s common to praise socialism. It’s rarer to define it. George Will. https://t.co/71rSdTA42Y	Quote: "Last year’s 529-page Agriculture Improvement Act will be administered by the Agriculture Department, which has about one employee for every 20 American farms."

@MrsLubi Elections have consequences. Get over it and GET READY FOR MORE OVERSIGHT! 		🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
@aalfarok There is a GoFundMe account to buy Whitaker a new ass. He did such a great job exposing the whole Trump paradigm we should all consider contributing.
@LeslieM16494500 lol we had NOTHING before this. How can you trust these dummies Trump hires? This guy wasn't even CLOSE to being qualified?
#WhitakerHearing  Wow, the GOP all planning to come back and ask questions for the rest of the day? lol
@DontUnderSTM8me You mean he is a Trump official?
@LeslieM16494500 ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. Get over it. This is called oversight.
@STL_Blonde ???????????????
@STL_Blonde So what about Wisconsin and Michigan, who WERE run by Republicans. How much voter fraud did they uncover?
@STL_Blonde It is a Federal law. You're claiming all this is happening but have no evidence for it. If YOU know about this, shouldn't all the GOP be constantly talking about it? Voter fraud is terrible. Are they all just saying "What can we do?"
@Texas0907 Shameful is the GOP allowing a madman to run unchecked doing terrible things to our country. And it is all very clear today that was a mistake.
@Texas0907 The whole country is seeing a guy who never should have come close to that job getting his ass handed to him. GOP looks bad cause they let it happen back in August. Their abdication of duty to oversee the Administration is now coming home to roost, so they are out of there.
@STL_Blonde And Whitaker was just talking about the FEDERAL election monitors they DID NOT send to places like Georgia and North Carolina. Give it up, Blondee.
@STL_Blonde LOL Guess you never heard of the Voting Rights Act and the reasons it was passed. What a surprise! And what happened to Trump's Voter Fraud panel? 🙄🙄 Went the same way as his university and foundation.
@Texas0907 I'm not jumping for joy at all. I was just reminding you our Constitution is now being honored as it should. Get ready for more. Want some popcorn? I'll buy!
@Texas0907 Sounds like you're getting a little smarter.
@STL_Blonde Yeah, so why haven't any of these illegal voters been prosecuted by the Trump administration? This is their job. Are you saying they aren't doing it?

@LincolnFresno @SJVPride @GMA @sramosABC Did you tweet about the female officer a couple weeks ago who was executed by a white guy on a bicycle? You seem to have selective hearing. That was in all the papers.
@SJVPride @GMA @sramosABC @LincolnFresno I worked in law enforcement. What other people say and do is on them. I stated a fact, and that's what we should be doing. Anybody can say their answer is perfect.
@SJVPride @GMA @sramosABC @LincolnFresno And I never said we should "tolerate" crime from anybody.
@SJVPride @GMA @sramosABC @LincolnFresno I didn't call anybody a name.
@LincolnFresno @GMA @sramosABC Good comeback, Potts!
@SJVPride @GMA @sramosABC @LincolnFresno Still evades the point. If you're going to express outrage when an illegal immigrant shoots a police officer, you should express the same when crazy white men do the same. They already caught the guy. Selected outrage is what I am talking about. That is the real rabble rousing.
@LincolnFresno @GMA @sramosABC Swerve dodge evade deflect. Not even close to responding to the question. Nobody is advocating tolerance for anybody. I'm not claiming you think it's ok for white men to kill cops.

@LincolnFresno We were talking about Trump's wall. I answered the question about the existing barriers. Trump's wall will not do what he claims it will do. He is not getting that money. He had his chance for two years, and blew it. Get over it. Go rag on Paul Ryan.
@LincolnFresno @POTUS Conservatives: We should give President billions of dollars for a wall which he has not prototype or plan for, and no legal appropriations for. We should ignore normal institutional government to give Trump his vanity wall. 	@SpeakerPelosi : Sorry, elections have consequences.
@LincolnFresno Any existing barriers that are there should stay and/or be repaired. These were legal expenditures by several administrations. The need for them was proved, there was a plan, and Congress appropriated the money. Not so with your vanity wall.
@LincolnFresno I didn't say that. If it was that big of an emergency, why hasn't he used the billions he was already given? He said today he is already building the wall, he gave the figures.
@LincolnFresno And we aren't talking about border "barriers". Your POTUS says it's a WALL. I support barriers where they make sense. And we already have those in all the places deemed "viable". Trump's vanity wall is not a barrier. He said so. And of course Mexico will be paying for it. 🙄🙄

@anurima Unfortunately, test scores were very low. One school had 3 out of 300 on grade level in math, a score of ONE percent. I can document all this.
@anurima In my district of 80,000 students, principal control was taken away in terms of suspensions. In middle schools, students became unruly, even good students became disruptive. But still, suspensions dropped by large numbers, which would indicate more time in the classroom.
@anurima I had full authority as a principal to suspend students, and used it as a tool to help kids. Order is the first thing you need to have with any kids, then work from there.	“No suspension” policies make the entire student population feel unsafe. Look at CA testscores.
@anurima 	Kids are still being suspended, only much less effectively and secretively than before. With funding involved, large school districts have been gaming the system. 		Betsy DeVos' education commission is making a terrible mistake @CNN https://t.co/w2VrQEVBjQ
