@PeterARoland @VP @POTUS Astronaut's what?
@TheRightCentral @GOP What?
@GOP I am sorry but that is simply not true.
@StateDept @POTUS Hope so.
@VP How will the present bill effect someone like me: 66 years old with pre-existing conditions? I am worried.
@timkaine I have been trying to give this president a chance. But if he does this and pulls us out of the climate agreement, I am done.
@thehill Why?  This just seems snarky.
@starr8211 @Independent Well no, not necessarily. They are ahead of us in education, technology and renewable resources.
@Independent This makes me sad.
@VP How so? Will you explain, please?
@GOP Huh?
@VP @cajunindustries @POTUS Who is he fighting?
@t_ricks96 @thehill 😂
@thehill Always amazes me how politicians use "those who can least afford it" to sell their bill of goods.
@thehill Wonder if she was paid.
@subverzo @StateDept Oh yeah, I forgot.
@StateDept Shared values?
@APSouthRegion @AP Does NOLA have a slavery museum? That would be a good place to park 'em.
@Independent Yeah, don't we USA citizens just love selling Billions in armaments to these guys--our "allies " in the war on terror. Woo hoo!
RT @VanJones68: Interesting. ... He is saying: don't let Pence come in and save the GOP. Let Trump wreck it, so Dems have a chance. https:/…
@VP @POTUS @FLOTUS Yes, indeed.
@CNNPolitics Really? How interesting.
@peplamb @VP Huh?
@bluebayou2888 @thehill 😹
@VP I know, get corps to pay their taxes!
@VP @POTUS Then stop tweeting about what you'r going to do and get to work.
@ChrissaHawks88 @thehill Oh please.
@thehill I am torn: if DJT resigns we get the "devout one".
@usedgov @POTUS Not if only rich kids can get an education cause Public education is stripped of federal funding cause money is given to private education.
@SkyNews Good luck to us all.
@Reuters Wow. Dropping like flies.
@VP @POTUS Do you ever read replies?
@petridishes @Polidorable Good one, A. P.
@VP @POTUS Yeah, sure. Maybe for The Donald and you guys and your friends. Not for little people like me.
@ABC No. Bad idea.
@WSJ Guess we're not the only country having difficulty.

@swstargal1 @EugeniaStonecr1 @PAgius102277 @CitizenX7766 @GOP Huh?
@GOP Hey, GOP, sp pr is a done deal.
@politico This makes me VERY angry.
@JasonKander Because it's always about me, me, me!
@Independent Why can't USA do this? Put people to work in the new industry of renewables.
@EPA @EPAScottPruitt @foxandfriends @FoxNews What?
@VP @POTUS Hard to respect those who don't respect me.
@pink2yoo @Impeach_D_Trump @VP @POTUS Love the "please " at the end. If only politeness would work.
@ABC How about including law to prevent &amp; prosecute law inforcement's crimes against citizens?
@AFP Wow!
@GOP Ok, fine. Freedom from paying taxes bc y're a religious org makes us heathens angry.
@cloverprez @FullerRitch @thetamblyn @cadalbey @CNN As I thought.
@thehill The president could still speculation and suspicion around this issue just by releasing his returns. Then he could focus on his new job.
@FullerRitch @thetamblyn @cadalbey @CNN Does this include those middle America opioid addicts or just city folks?
@AGSchneiderman What is the point of this, Mr. Secretary?
@EPA @EPAScottPruitt Interesting. He pledges to clean up old toxic waste and simultaneously create new toxic waste. Ingenious. Glad he works for us.
@SicSempRises @pooter03 @DrMatthewTaylor @fawfulfan @rdthorsett @edabny54 What are you talking about?  Just another way to obfuscate the real issue of racism in our country.
@fawfulfan @rdthorsett @edabny54 @SicSempRises Yup. Yup. And yup. Astute summary. Thanks.
@fawfulfan @rdthorsett @edabny54 @SicSempRises Yup
@fawfulfan What?
@timkaine Oh, yeah. I must have forgot.
@thehill Well, that will be helpful.
@LockeTrin1776 @SyrChancelot @GOP @POTUS Neocon fascist
@GOP @POTUS No thanks.

@dawgfanatic @thehill Yup.
@thehill Fine, but then why should churches be given tax exemptions.? If they want to push a political ideology, pay taxes.

@azalben @realDonaldTrump If we spend money on creating jobs in the renewable energy industry we can have clean water and air AND jobs. How about that?

@KeithOlbermann Who gets the proceeds?
@coff33loveit @CNN Yes but those college-educated people will then put in their share of taxes and we will all benefit.
@GOP Umm. Where do the profits go? Just askin'
@thehill Ummm. Really?
@CBTLTweet point taken.
@BCAppelbaum @donnabrazile good God  I am so ashamed of our country.

@MatthewGampp @JessicaVandev12 @foxnewspolitics I see. Okay.
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA Sounds good.
@EPAScottPruitt @EPA what does "traditional values " mean to you?
@MatthewGampp @foxnewspolitics I read the article and see the problem.
@MatthewGampp @foxnewspolitics What about EPA protections for water, air? Are they to go as well?
@MatthewGampp @foxnewspolitics Yes, I see. However, that study is just one. Do you consider all studies flawed? What about physical evidence
@MatthewGampp @foxnewspolitics and the studies are fake because why?
