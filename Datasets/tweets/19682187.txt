I can't be in Selma today to commemorate the heroes of that era, but I am thinking of them and our friends and allies today who continue their work. Voting rights is not a settled issue, it's one we have to continually be vigilant to defend. And together we will. #SelmaJubilee
They returned a few weeks later and, protected by a court order and the U.S. Army, made it to Montgomery. Because of their bravery, and that of countless others, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed that same spring. #SelmaJubilee
Nearly 54 years ago, 600 civil rights warriors attempted their first march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights. They were not just turned back at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, they were viciously attacked by state and local police. But they were not beaten. #SelmaJubilee https://t.co/D0TmmSdInF

We no longer have 3 co-equal branches of government. The President, in taking money designated by Congress for other needs to build his senseless wall,  has voided the voice of the people. The real national emergency is the constitutional crisis the President just instigated.

It's official. Join the team: https://t.co/Hett1C0Jel #Julian2020
"The lesson I learned from my mother so many years ago in this community is that when we want to see change in our community, we don‚Äôt wait for it. We work for it."
"My story wouldn‚Äôt be possible without the strong women who came before me and passed me the baton. Because of their hard work, I have the opportunity to stand here today."
"Hoy en d√≠a, esta comunidad representa el futuro de Estados Unidos: diverso, de r√°pido crecimiento, optimista, un lugar donde personas de diferentes or√≠genes se han unido para crear algo verdaderamente especial."
I am proud to call myself a son of San Antonio. Home is always San Antonio.
"Today, this community represents America‚Äôs future‚Äîdiverse, fast-growing, optimistic, a place where people of different backgrounds have come together to create something truly special."
"This is a community built by Native Americans. Families who worked to serve our future."
"Esta es una comunidad construida por inmigrantes, familias de M√©xico. Pero tambi√©n de Alemania y otros pa√≠ses. Y tambi√©n de Nativos Americanos"
"This is a community built by immigrants‚Äîfamilies from Mexico.  But also from Germany and other countries."
"Esta es una comunidad como muchas otras comunidades en nuestro pa√≠s.Una comunidad de buenas personas. Gente humilde Las personas que se presentan temprano al trabajo y se quedan tarde (muchas veces en m√°s de un trabajo) para que puedan mantener a su familia."
"This is a community of good people.  Humble people.  People who show up for work early and stay late‚Äîoftentimes at more than one job‚Äîso they can provide for their family."
"Miren a su alrededor, no hay ni un candidato delantero a la presidencia que haya nacido aqu√≠, pero siempre he cre√≠do que con grandes sue√±os y trabajo duro todo es posible."
"Look around, there are no frontrunners born here but I've always believed that with big dreams and hard work anything is possible."
"Esta ma√±ana, tom√© el autob√∫s n√∫mero 68 con mi hermano por la calle Guadalupe, como lo hac√≠amos tantas veces como ni√±os. Y esta vez traje a mi hija Carina."
"This morning, I rode the number 68 bus with my brother down Guadalupe Street as we did so many times as kids. Only this time I brought my daughter Carina with me."
"Es donde ella creci√≥, donde trabaj√≥ durante a√±os como sirvienta, cocinera y ni√±era mientras criaba a mi madre como madre soltera."
"It‚Äôs where she grew up, where she worked for years as a maid, a cook and a babysitter while raising my mother as a single parent."
"Este lugar ‚Äî el lado oeste de San Antonio ‚Äî es un lugar especial para mi. Este es el lugar al que lleg√≥ mi abuela, Victoria, en 1922, cuando emigr√≥ de M√©xico cuando era una hu√©rfana de siete a√±os."
"This place‚Äîthe west side of San Antonio‚Äî is a special place for me. This is the place my grandmother, Victoria, came to in 1922 when she immigrated from Mexico as a seven-year-old orphan."

24. We have a lot of work to do. But as I travel across the country and talk with young people, I‚Äôm impressed by a generation of young leaders who are up for a challenge. And when I think about where we will be 50 years from now, my money‚Äôs on progress. END
23. Fifty years after Dr. King‚Äôs assassination we still mourn his loss, but his legacy includes the Fair Housing Act, passed a week after his death. So on today's anniversary, we have a chance not just to celebrate, but to recommit to its promise. #FairHousingis50
22. Economists Chetty and Hendren came out with a new study this year. It underlines what so many people knew intuitively: race &gt; class when determining futures. Even with economic status, racism still lingers. The two are inextricably linked in housing. https://t.co/9VdX9QLeMl
21. Black communities are dangerously overpoliced and police violence continues to ravage black communities and claim the lives of unarmed young African Americans with little accountability or justice. Black lives matter and where black families live matters.
20. So where do we go from here? For one, we need to vote. Every single election. We all must educate ourselves about the issues (from trustworthy sources). These issues don't just affect black and brown folks‚Äîsegregation holds back our entire society from greater prosperity.
19. Closing that loophole in the Fair Housing Act in 2015 was something I'm very proud of my HUD team for accomplishing. In addition, we expanded fair housing rights for domestic violence survivors, transgender individuals, and returning citizens. https://t.co/SuB8mtqZUO
18. President Obama believed deeply in the promise of the Fair Housing Act and his administration crafted a policy in 2015, the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, requiring that American communities actively work to integrate. https://t.co/FOlQIVapxs
17. The abrupt change has been described as an effort to ‚Äúroll back the Obama administration‚Äôs attempts to reverse decades of racial, ethnic and income segregation." So what were we doing at HUD in the Obama administration that was so scary to right-wingers?
16. Congress's spending bill actually prohibits HUD from helping municipalities desegregate. This goes beyond neglect, and is more likely the active undermining by Republicans of a reasonable policy meant to level the playing field for millions of disenfranchised Americans.
15. In my last months at HUD, we opened up an investigation of Facebook for allowing advertisers to exclude certain racial and ethnic groups when placing real estate ads on the platform. HUD recently abandoned that suit. Fortunately, NGOs are on the case.
14. Example B, from just last week: Under Ben Carson, HUD Scales Back Fair Housing Enforcement https://t.co/OhxJQFwyXC
13. Example A, from January 2018: Trump Administration Postpones an Obama Fair-Housing Rule  https://t.co/pVV92k2uvq
12. This administration actively rejects its responsibility to enforce fair housing rules. In 2015, the current Secretary famously dismissed our efforts to enforce fair housing as "social engineering." https://t.co/h86n2BxIV1
11. That's why I called HUD the Department of Opportunity. HUD can change lives, it can help improve our entire society.
10. At the same time, investing in neglected neighborhoods through effective place based work can also make a positive difference in people‚Äôs lives. We need to embrace both these approaches, to give folks meaningful options.
9. Providing a housing voucher for a greater-opportunity neighborhood to a low-income family with young children gives those kids a fighting chance in life. They will have better jobs. They will earn more money. They will enjoy better health and accrue social benefits.
8. Segregated communities where people of color live are significantly more likely to expose children to environmental hazards. Lead poisoning limits a child's potential and Flint still doesn‚Äôt have clean water. https://t.co/2CDeGrdV5o
7. Every year a child lives in a neighborhood with greater opportunity -- better schools, racial diversity, a strong middle class -- the more that child will earn over her lifetime. https://t.co/JjcAiqcGDQ
6. How do we know that fair housing still matters? Strong data. The economists Raj Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren have produced important analyses of how critical a child's zip code is to her future. https://t.co/Tqjz6wIgS5
5. Sadly, the goals of the Fair Housing Act have yet to be realized. Racial segregation endures, and the folks of color living in these communities have worse outcomes than their white peers because of fewer education, economic, and professional opportunities.
4. It was the last major piece of Civil Rights legislation. The Fair Housing Act required local communities to desegregate, to undo government policies that encouraged segregation -- post-WWII policies like the GI Bill that gave preference to white homebuyers in the new suburbs.
3. When MLK was assassinated in 1968, as the nation wrestled with grief, and riots rocked cities from Chicago to Washington, DC, President Johnson pushed Congress to pass the law that Dr. King had lobbied for several years to pass without action.
2. As HUD Secretary under President Obama it was my job to enforce the Act. So on the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act, I have some thoughts about the past, present, and future of fair housing.
1. 50 yrs ago, a week after MLK's assassination, President Johnson signed into law the Fair Housing Act, which promised to address racial housing discrimination &amp; proactively dismantle the pervasive racial segregation America's federal housing policy had created. #FairHousingIs50
