Here kitty kitty...🐯 	*THIS TRAILER IS FOR A RATED “R” MOVIE &amp; IS NOT INTENDED FOR CHILDREN.*	But if u’re old enough, check this red band trailer for #Hellboy.

On 2nd thought, don't send me #stealthies. I'd rather people just come up 2me &amp; ask. I'll probably say yes-&amp; we'll both be in focus, too. ;)
Heard a new term last nite: #STEALTHIE- a pic taken of a celebrity or other person w/out their knowledge that gets posted on social media.
#Stealthies often result in the subjects' faces being caught in awkward expressions, off center and blurry. Regardless, they are posted.
#Stealthies also often require the photographer to shoot from an awkward position, i.e, arms crossed w/camera peeking out under one arm.
Some photographers include themselves in the foreground, faces often overexposed from the flash being too close.This is a #selfie/stealthie.
Send me your best #stealthie or #selfiestealthie and I'll retweet the best ones.  Thanks, Timo. ; )

@ShaneVictorino The pressure's on... So psyched to go see you and the boys!
I love that moment in the theater when all the drama that came before is so earned that the audience is enthralled by total silence.
@MargauxFrench67 Merci beaucoup, Margaux. Tu m'as fait sourire.
Heard on the streets of New York: "Did you know I was the one who invented the electric slide? No, its true. One day I was in my socks..."

Speaking of impersonators, @scottcaan is fake. Neither Scott Alex nor Grace is on twitter. Please don't ask me to ask them. They know. #H50
So i heard someone was impersonating me at the block party in Honolulu last night. Lame. Apologies to anyone who was fooled.

Scott Caan Quote of the Day: 	Fan: "I love #H50." 	Scott: "Is something wrong with you?"
The boys of #H50 are shooting our first day on #NCISLA. Does that make us NCIS:LA 5-0? HCIS:LA? Hmm.  #MashUsUp
@IngridRS : )
The odyssey begins.
@robertchow You rock, Ed Lin!

Athletes need fuel for their fire and Peyton Manning just got set ablaze. Something tells me the Colts are going to regret this day.

Heres @espn's response: http://t.co/ED8y44Z1 What do u guys think? Should they do more, like fire the writer(s), or does this make it right?
The real Q now is what @espn is going to do about it. Is this apology enough? The actions of that writer now represent their entire brand.
The underbelly shows itself (sigh): http://t.co/wmOgIRkP

OK a little #H50 trivia: what do our most recent guest stars Ed Asner and James Caan have in common? Hint: "I gotta have more cowbell!" #SNL
...Except maybe MARCHING UP AND DOWN THE SQUARE. #montypython
Even after 20 years in what can be a very difficult business, days like today remind me there's still nothing else I'd rather be doing. #H50

It's a beautiful day, the sun is shining, trade winds blowing. Theres only 1 thing to do on a day like today: spend 3 hours at the dentist.
Well said. “@TheNoteboook: Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”

There is no "I" in "team." But the there is an "M," which I'm guessing stands for meat loaf.
@bethanyshady Looking forward to it! I only wish Jorge and I were on at the same time.
Yup, it's true. I'll be co-hosting LIVE with one of my favorite people, @kellyripa on Feb 20th. One more reason to come visit Hawaii! #H50
