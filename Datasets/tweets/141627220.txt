Expert: A trail to triumph: China &amp; 40 years of reforms. China has become hub of FDI while its entrepreneurs are making huge investments across continents that speak volume of enormous economic outlook at global level. @ScholarYK https://t.co/Vz1T4syqba via @dailytimespak
Expert: Instead of replicating western economic tenets of development, China managed to devise &amp; tailor new economic models conducive to its own economic milieu. This extends a universal lesson that development is not stringed to loot, pillage &amp; plunder. https://t.co/Vz1T4syqba
Expert: Once Napoleon Bonaparte remarked “when China wakes, whole world will shake”. It has turned into a reality. China has awakened with a big bang by practising economic reforms devised by Deng Xiaoping in 1978. @ScholarYK @CathayPak https://t.co/Vz1T4syqba via @dailytimespak
Expert: China is achieving the height of progress and prosperity through incremental and aligning reform policies spanning over 40 years and that too without infusing or relying on conflicts or "zero-sum" tactics. @ScholarYK @CathayPak @CPEC_Official https://t.co/bVfxe5x5rK
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to your great support for CPEC, China Pakistan relations in 2018. I wish you a Happy New Year.

10. In 3 years, we have witnessed thriving development of power sector of Pakistan, less &amp; less shutdown is the evidence. Chinese investors are confident that power sector &amp; economic development of Pakistan has bright future, sacrifices made by Chinese would be fully recognized. https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
9. In addition to coal plant, Chinese investors bring 5 wind projects, several hydro &amp; solar projects under CPEC. These CPEC energy projects are investment. The equity is brought to Pakistan &amp; loan is borne by Chinese sponsors, not Pakistan. @CathayPak @CPEC_Official @pid_gov https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
8. In relation to cost &amp; tariff, we can find out that two coal-fired power plants completed under CPEC are nearly cheapest among total 130 thermal power projects, which is public on NTDC website &amp; updated on a monthly basis. @CathayPak @CPEC_Official @pid_gov @PlanComPakistan https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
7. Nowadays clean generation technologies are very advanced in coal fired power industry, especially the flue gas desulfurization. Emission of pollutions by the newly completed coal-fired power project has been reduced to almost zero. @CathayPak @CPEC_Official @PlanComPakistan https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
6. Electricity by coal in USA accounts for 30.4% in 2016, Germany 44%, Australia 62.9%, South Africa 92%, China 75.3% &amp; India 75.9%. All data are from World Bank website. Coal power in Pakistan was 0.2% in 2015, which was one of reasons why power supply was not enough. @CathayPak https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
5. Power supply must be a mix. Hydro &amp; wind are seasonal, solar is small, only nuclear, coal &amp; gas plants are suitable for stable operation to support base load. Nuclear is expensive, gas comes with large refinery. Coal is mandatory for a power system with huge demand. @CathayPak https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
4. Chinese engineers worked here thousands of miles away from families. Chinese companies even used equity to build plant before financial close. This was only to complete the project as early as possible, to help mitigate load shedding of Pakistan. @CathayPak @CPEC_Official https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
3. After 3 years, 2 large-scale coal power plants completed, accounting for 20% of total capacity of power grid of Pakistan. Now the shutdown in major cities have been considerably decreased (load shedding from 12 times a day to nearly 0 in Islamabad). @CathayPak @CPEC_Official https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
2. Tariff Policy was announced by NEPRA in 2014, but there were nearly zero investors willing to participate because circular debt, delayed payment, currency depreciation existed for years in Pakistan. Only after launch of CPEC, Chinese investors came. @CathayPak @CPEC_Official https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
1. Investment policy for coal power projects were introduced by Pakistan. Why coal? As Pakistan had been suffering serious shortage in power generation, coal power plant is quickest way to increase stable &amp; affordable power supply. @CathayPak @CPEC_Official @PlanComPakistan https://t.co/T2BlXOur9W
