@smerconish can you top out of ISOs collecting and selling your data? Or do you have no control?
@smerconish does that mean we can change a baby's surname to Trump?
You are NOT self-funding your campaign @realDonaldTrump. You have a donate button and sell hats for $20. #GOPDebate https://t.co/FWJEOwA9jX
I've yet to see a poll that shows trump beating Hilary; yet, he says it in every debate. #GOPDebate
Well said, Ted https://t.co/dgnWNmKnGU
Trump can name many strong leaders. He can name many weak leaders. But, he keeps them to himself b/c he's not a cheater #rhymIng #GOPDebate
We should start counting every time trump says "Good" and "Very Good". He uses very good words.  #GOPDebate
Trump *disapprovingly shakes head in protest* #GOPDebate
There's obviously some statistical, methodical thought that went into this bold statement.  https://t.co/81dsgES9pm
Trump is the most democratic republican to be a front runner. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/iZoIPYIp3Z
Rubio just channeled his in inner Rand Paul. The debt crisis is our #1 threat, and we need to solve it.  #GOPDebate
Rubios got a point: if we want to keep social security alive, we need to bump the age. #GOPDebate
Common core has to go. Local schools need control #GOPDebate
Now we're talking, vocational education #GOPDebate
Millennials are not employed because they refuse to be underemployed. Low-skill workers keep this country running #GOPDebate
Immigration: Are there any people in this country that will do low skill labor? Because millennials are aspiring to be janitors #GOPDebate

RT @brennawilliams: "I'd be running for president of Croatia, if not for immigration." -@JohnKasich #GOPDebate https://t.co/NnGrDYA2cm
Trump kicks off the debate talking about enthusiasm. That's what we need, a reality tv star with gusto running the country  #GOPDebate
Kasich defending trade deals as a member of a blue collar family. Bernie's got a few opinions on that as well. Just a few lol #GOPDebate
Rubio has a lot of ground to make up. Playing down and dirty against trump was a big "ready, fire, aim" moment for him #GOPDebate
John Kasich wisdom for the beginning #GOPDebate
I've somehow missed tweeting every democrat debate but manage to make it in front of my phone for the each #GOPdebate
And we're off! It's the RNC chairman whose name they didn't even bother to put on the screen. He's obviously really important #GOPDebate
How can we vote for a party that fights like the Real Housewives? Trump turned politics into reality TV #GOPDebate https://t.co/zIstVgQYhC
"It doesn't count if I don't remember it" Donald Trump mindset #GOPDebate 	 https://t.co/zxqjONMmI1

Rubio had no problem playing at Trumps level tonight. Not sure how I feel about that. #GOPDebate  https://t.co/H4cfBpGjOO
RT @CBSPolitics: .@tedcruz says he'll support @realDonaldTrump if he's the Republican nominee. #GOPDebate

How many Americans actually know the word tenuous, Ted? I appreciate the effort though #bookworm #GOPDebate  https://t.co/DjkB6RWWsB
Answers every answer w/ an insult then a little dance around the question. It's his mating dance for America https://t.co/o2pKS1q9dt
The Cruz campaign guy that does all the donald research "Trump Trolling Strategist" #GOPDebate https://t.co/DE1Wh6KRNS
Ted Cruz believes in the breakfast of champions - wikipedia with a side of textbooks #GOPDebate https://t.co/FWxXOLMJWx
Kasich is so logical and rational - therefore totally unappealing to the Republican base #irony #GOPDebate
Ted Cruz has come across as tolerable tonight. RNC's rain dance this morning is paying off #GOPDebate
Marco debating everyone else: legit political stuff. Marco debating Trump: tick tick BOOM #GOPDebate https://t.co/jFFps3XUYZ
Every #GOPDebate starts with "we want to talk policy" and by the end it's like a monopoly game with extended family https://t.co/bb5jInd49m
We've still got 1/3 of the debate left and tumblr has enough GIFs for a political christmas #GOPDebate
Kasich on screen is a completely different debate than when the others take the mic #GOPDebate
Cruz to Trump "Count to 10. Stop interrupting and count to 10." #GOPDebate
Ted Cruz coming in with some common sense "Is this the debate you want playing out in the election?" #GOPDebate
Trump on Rubio "He couldn't get elected god catcher." I believe federal post is reserved for Ace Ventura #GOPDebate
Realization: trump isn't Voldemort. He's Dudley. Big D the bully of little kids w/ 2 bedrooms and an abusive temper #GOPDebate #HarryPotter
Trump to Megyn Kelly "you're looking well" *charming smile* I'm sure that'll fix everything Big D #GOPDebate
So basically Ted is the political version of a Facebook stalker #Trolling #gopdebate
I'm into this "check the screen. You're wrong" system Fox News has going on #GOPDebate
Kasich "I'm the only person on this stage that has ACTUALLY balanced the federal budget. This isn't a theory to me" #GOPDebate

#ChrisChristie sold out, and he knows it. He's hoping he ride in Trump's jetstream to the whitehouse as VP  https://t.co/qLeoZIsdgk
The #drumpf irony: The Donald's voter base is one of the least likely to use social media. How we get this message before it's too late??
America - The Land of the Free but the Home of the #Drumpf #NeverTrump  https://t.co/vV908Gfcww
#GOPDebate focused on foreign &amp; economic policy and skipped over domestic &amp; social issues. Those conversations can't be overlooked.
#GOPDebate was back-to-back insults, but between jabs, they packed in some substance - Israel, S.Korea, Apple, Immigration, Taxes, Budget...
@DarlingEbony I appreciate the ironic cynicism though. #BlackLivesMatter is a conversation that needs to happen. And, now's the time.
@DarlingEbony https://t.co/xlmj4nTvyu One of the great ad campaigns of all time. Rubio already took it though https://t.co/8YzO9as2tg

The Donald's closing statement - get's cat-called. Stay classy, Houston. #GOPDebate
Ted Cruz's closing statement - "Every political buzzword ever." #GOPDebate
Merrill Lynch commercial fine print - "Our standard rates are lower than SOME of our competitors." way to sneak that on in there #GOPDebate
The #GOPDebate has become the Real Housewives of Politics.

Ben Carson - "We have to look at Israel like we look at our children." #GOPDebate
My favorite #GOPDebate sponsors so far. #ThePurge and @HouseofCards. Hilarious, yet terrifying.
Commercials during tonight's #GOPDebate - Stock trading, portfolio management and #ThePurge. Way to stay classy republicans.
Trump - "Cruz is a Liar." Cruz's logo - "TrusTed." Pow, right in the branding. #GOPDebate https://t.co/oF64XZ2LI5
They may have only asked Ben Carson three questions. But, at least they asked the doctor about healthcare. #GOPDebate
Kasich is the new Reagan. He should start using "Morning in America" ads and change it to his name #GOPDebate #TBT
Rubio and Trump going at it. That's where it started to get interesting #republicandebate
