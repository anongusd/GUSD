These soldiers deserve our support and help, not the fresh wound of losing a child.

@AJ_Ski_Bum  Thank you!
@AJ_Ski_Bum GP's forcing will on fit parents would be unconstitutional. GP rights to step in with unfit parents would be supported.
@kidzz_101 Our mission is to pass the PRA, the  issue you are discussing is outside the scope; doesn't mean those aren't important.
@kidzz_101 the PRA does not address custodial V non custodial parent issues.
@kidzz_101 The PRA's primary focus is restoring #parentalrights as they relate to cases of government overreach and individual liberty.
We're still taking your #PRAQuestions, Tweet them to us and we'll answer them throughout the day! #parentalrights #freedom
RT @NFB_voice: "It's important for us to fight not only for ourselves but for those who come after us." - @BlindGazza #nfb16
Our press release concerning SJRes 36 https://t.co/clj85hXS77 #parentalrights
@VaxCalc Correct!
@VaxCalc In our view #Sb277 is already unconstitutional, the PRA would clarify that. 	1342 it would be no threat.
Do you have questions about our Parental Rights Amendment? Tweet them to us, use #PRAQuestions and we'll answer them throughout the day!

Q: Who should be making choices for children, Government or parents?	A: Parents
Q: You oppose the CRPD, Do you not support #disabledrights	A: We do support the rights of disabled. CRPD takes away U.S. sovereignty.
Q: Do you oppose the UNCRC?	A: Yes. This is an International treaty that threatens #parentalrights of American parents
Q: How are you funded?	A: We are 100% donation funded by supporters like you!
Q: What are you doing right now to protect parents?	A: Lobbying for the passage of the PRA, and opposing laws that hurt #parentalrights
Q: Your movement is a conservatives only moment right?	A: No. Our movement is for the benefit of ALL parents across political lines.
A: Sign our petition, like us on Facebook, volunteer in your state, and tell your friends and family to do the same!
Q: How can I help in the #parentalrights Effort?
Q: Will the PRA protect the rights of all parents?	A: Yes.
Q: Does the PRA give the government more say in my choices for my child?	A: No. The PRA is designed specifically to protect #parentalrights
Q: Does the PRA protect child abusers?	A: Absolutely not. It protects loving parents  and provides protection for children from abuse.
Q: Does https://t.co/0QyNIoOQ4y oppose broad mandated vaccinations?	A: Yes. Parents should be making those choices. Not the government.

And the PRA does not protect or provide rights to those parents that are not fit.
@senkwrites You are correct. The PRA does NOT protect such parents. We are not creating protection for those parents,
@senkwrites while parents can provide a loving home.
@senkwrites The two are not mutally exclusive. Parents can have rights to raise their children free from government intrusion,
@senkwrites and the PRA provides for that with our section regarding governental interest. The PRA does NOT protect child abusers.
@senkwrites The PRA is focused on protecting children by standing between them and government who doesnt know their best interest.
