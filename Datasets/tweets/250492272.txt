Also! - big Russia foe &amp; Trump critic Mitt Romney voted with the Trump administration to ease sanctions on a close ally of Vladimir Putin
So: after a last-minute lobbying effort led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, 11 Senate GOPers voted with Democrats to advance a measure that would overturn Trump admin effort to ease sanctions on several companies owned by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin
Sasse is the GOP senator I missed who also voted with Democrats not to table the Russia sanctions resolution
Senate now voting on the actual motion to proceed to the resolution. It appears, however, the measure will ultimately fail because it doesn‚Äôt have enough support to invoke cloture (60)
Motion to table Dem resolution to overturn easing off Russia sanctions fails 42-57		GOPers voting with Dems NOT to table (I missed one)		Rubio	Kennedy	Cotton	Hawley	Boozeman	McSally	Collins	Gardner	Moran	Daines

‚ÄúI‚Äôm hearing it‚Äôs in the afternoon,‚Äù Sanders says of vote tomorrow on his Yemen resolution
Corker said his resolution calling out MBS over Khashoggi resembles a similar measure Graham introduced last week. Expecting language tonight.
I expect some of the 13 Republicans who voted to advance Lee-Sanders resolution to end U.S. support for Yemen to flip, though. Many were angry over Khashoggi murder and want a stronger admin response. Corker resolution could give them an out.
Corker is working to introduce his own measure holding MBS to account for the murder of Khashoggi. He rejected notion he's doing it to sink Lee-Sanders.		"Democrats are concerned that somehow this is an attempt to undermine Lee-Sanders. It isn't. It's just totally unrelated."
"It depends on whether Corker's successful in getting a side-by side-resolution on Khashoggi," Murphy said about GOP support for the Lee-Sanders resolution
Senate vote on Lee-Sanders resolution to end U.S. support for Yemen war still expected tomorrow. Murphy said today he's confident all 49 Ds plus at least half of the 13 Republicans who previously voted to advance it will still do so tomorrow.

coming soon: GILLUM DECLINES TO RULE OUT 2020 RUN
Not a very Shermanesque statement.
Asked if he wants to make any news on 2020, Andrew Gillum quips, "The news that I‚Äôm breaking is that I plan to stay married to my wife. We are trying to celebrate 10 years of marriage in May"		What if you're asked to join a ticket?		"Lord have mercy. You really want me divorced?"
Also "My fellow Americans" should be a box on a 2020 bingo card.
Booker choked back tears recalling being comforted by the mother of a young man who was fatally shot, who told him to "stay faithful." 		He repeatly urged the crowd to "stay faithful" in his closing, a refrain that reminded me of someone.. https://t.co/uGGj3lM9qZ
RT @RosJordanAJE: @LindseyGrahamSC on MBS: "I cannot support arm sales to Saudi Arabia as long as he's in charge of this country"
Booker lamented that kids are being "arrested for things two out of the last three presidents have done."		He recalled watching yesterday as George HW Bush was being laid in state "people that you know have to have done the kind of things that kids do."
"Literally, my family when they moved to New Jersey, had to get a white couple to pose as us to buy the home I grew up in because they were steering black families away," Booker said about housing discrimination in New Jersey
Booker spoke about growing up in Newark and it informs his views on criminal justice:		"I‚Äôm the only U.S. senator that lives in the inner city. I don‚Äôt know if any other senators had shootings on their block this year. I live across the street from a drug treatment center."
"I don't think that's chest-bumping. I think the vice president of the United States was sitting next to Barack Obama and helping lead this country. He's extraordinarily qualified. I don't think people should think that's hyperbole," Booker said of Biden's 'most qualified' line
Booker just gave an emotional speech (with quite the presidential stemwinder at the end) on civil rights and criminal justice reform at the 'Bend Toward Justice' conference in DC. Choice quotes coming. 		But first, his reaction to Biden's "most qualified" remark:
&lt;Hunger Games cannon&gt; https://t.co/bJOVpHNb0L
At civil rights event in DC, Booker urges "unconditional love," even for GOP. He recalls being frustrated by Graham on Kavanaugh, but teaming up with him on crim justice.		"I don‚Äôt know if you all know this. I used to have a Questlove afro, but I pulled it out after that."

RT @svdate: The press secretary of the White House is now speaking at a political rally.
Ryan also claimed that the House GOP health care bill maintained protections for preexisting conditions. 		The AHCA actually allowed states to request waivers so that insurers could charge higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions.
It would have done so in part by cutting Medicare - the very thing GOP and Ryan-allied groups are attacking House Dems over right now.
Asked by @BretBaier just now about the ballooning deficits under his watch, Paul Ryan cited the deficit reduction contained in the AHCA, the House health care bill. It would have reduced the deficit by $337B over 10 years, per CBO. Relatively small amount.

Obama mocks GOP over Hillary's emails in Indiana. "You know they didn't really care about it, because if they did, they'd be upset that our current president has an unsecured iPhone... that the Chinese are listening to all the time"
On trail in Indiana, Obama says GOP pledging to protect preexisting conditions now is "like me all these years rooting for Chicago Bears and suddenly, I'd say, oh man, I love Indianapolis. No, that's not true! That's revisionist history, that's making stuff up."
