@FranciSir No idea where Top Gear is. But I can tell you the Grand Tour is NOT in Vietnam. It’s just me
This is an amazing story about an amazing man.  https://t.co/JHZbM1NYWh
@darshan9494 Actually, I’m here for other reasons
@HRHCalamSmithso A shop
@OliCollins27 All of it.
@haituando I wish
@_VeTKiN_ It’s snake bile actually. And I have. Several times
Vietnamese coffee this morning. Not bad. https://t.co/u1wCwGVxjQ
@jfeinbergmusic I’ve stayed in a lot of them in all 50 states.
@ljphotoimages Apart from the fact that the name “Mito” is a meld of Milano and Torino.
@Nickyt20 @JWJBowden @thegrandtour Been. It wasn’t anything memorable.
@joeparsonsqa Yup. That’s about right.
@Danielbiggin Most of Italy’s baristas are in London these days
@mattdrussell Not sure. I work for Amazon
@Stevotweets1 Yes but I’m in Vietnam
The nicest cup of coffee I ever had was in Milano. The 14,000 worst were all in American hotel lobbies.
@JWJBowden @thegrandtour My dear chap. It’s a known fact among those who travel that American lobby coffee is the world’s nastiest drink.
@itsharveywood @thegrandtour That’s very kind but actually, the best is yet to come: Mongolia.
@ampyourgrowth @thegrandtour obviously you didn’t watch because I did
More news from Vietnam. It’s the same word here for “Motherfucker” and “green bean”.  That’s why the talks broke down probably.
@ScmAuthor @thegrandtour I mean this sincerely. I have NEVER met anyone less like a genius than James.
I hear Viper007Bond has died of leukaemia. My condolences to his family. He was important to the success of Top Gear. I listened to him.
@andyjenner1982 @thegrandtour They were VERY hot
This week’s @thegrandtour special is a good laugh. I take a dump, James makes some toast and Hammond has some accidents.
Please help if you can.  https://t.co/6uXWtaGri1

@AshChamp24 Hmmm@
@RatBikeZone Well I’ve certainly never won one.
Anyone who’s good at darts MUST be a bore. Because who chooses to go to the pub to do maths? Why not just chat and laugh and drink?
@ChelesPen You’re right. i do like toast. And beetroot. And Kristin Scott Thomas. And London.
@AbbieEaton44 @Super2Series Well done you. And especially well done as they probably can’t understand a word you say.
@GavinGc5 So if you won the lottery, or suddenly became intelligent, you’d forget what life used to be like?
I say again. I don’t like pool and I think darts is idiotic. But I have played these things occasionally. You can’t help it if you’re, human
How can you know what normal people think if you’ve never played pool?
@Davidnorth1 I know.
Seriously, how can you get to the age of 62 without EVER playing a single game of pool? It’s impossible.
I’m shit at pool. But I know how to hold the cue at least. What I cannot understand is how you can be the prime minister when you don’t.

Strange that BBC News is talking down the last Top Gear tonight. Do they not want big ratings for some reason?

We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.
This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong.
They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed.
And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths.
The number plate WAS a coincidence. When it was pointed out to us, we changed it. As pics in this morning's Mail show.

Welcome to the caravan site. http://t.co/nRHTmLbQ1f
Just checked and yup, we still haven't taken off.
Good news. There is a new plane and it isn't broken. Bad news. It's still at Heathrow. My arse is numb now.
The plane had 20.5 litres of oil in Barcelona this morning and it has 20.5 litres of oil now. But health and safety says there's a leak.
People of British Airways. Could you send a couple of buses to the Nice flight as it's broken down and we've been sitting on it for ages.
@dancres Yup. That's kind of what I was saying
@pete1423 I'd rather eat my own head than vote UKIP
After Barbados, I need some peace and quiet. So I'm going to Monaco for the weekend.
@djacrowley Read today's Sunday Times.
The reporter is a no-show. I guess he's busy doctoring pictures and inventing quotes. Don't forget to use your best joined up writing
Seriously. If you can do shorthand, I'll give you an interview.
To the reporter on the beach. Come and have a drink. Orange juice? Milk? Or is it past your bed time?
People of Barbados. Thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou thankyou.
@Travis666Rey Yup.
I just watched Lewis Hamilton race Ken Block at the Top Gear festival in Barbados. It was extremely exciting.
James Richard and I were extensively papped getting out of the sea this morning. So that's next month's cover of GQ sorted.

@JStefanski11 I'm writing it now. It'll be a half hour special.
The Green Party is against fracking, bankers' bonuses and cancer. And for fluffy kittens and soya beans.
Oh Christ. Now the Green Party has a party election broadcast. Apparently, they can solve everything.
I wanted to know about Max Clifford's penis, not about some tree related nonsense.

It is a good play. And nobody sings.
I'm not a natural theatre enthusiast but I must say: Fatal Attraction was very very good. 		Even though one rabbit was a bit boiled.
Come on everyone. Keep up.	Fatal Attraction: rabbit.                    Basic Instinct: beaver.
RT @DickLinkogel: @JeremyClarkson if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck put it back in the oven for a few more minutes
To be clear, Sharon Stone exposed her lady's area in Basic Instinct. Fatal Attraction was the boiled rabbit.
Rabbit is my favourite meat. Apart from duck.
Afterwards, I shall eat a rabbit.

For the BBC, it really has been the perfect storm. Good footage of waves. Local so cheap to cover. And many rich people affected.
@charltonbrooker Finding Chemo. Hahahahaha.
@jackwilkinss A tray shop
@WindyM72 That's a good point too.
@Natasha78_  That's a good point.
I just don't want any of you getting into trouble with the law.
So Piers Morgan was interviewed under caution re phone hacking. But do remember people that he is innocent until a court decides otherwise.
Who says a man can't multi-task? http://t.co/WuKt1h1NIO
@paulywauly76 I saw you running. Had your bus broken down?
@TroyZante Warming? Er...
@Waughlrus I am bloody well not
@TheDarkWolf14 what did you think of the Chernobyl bit?
@GaryLineker bugger
Thankyou to all the Top Gear audience today. Your patience throughout was much appreciated.
@donny_nas I'm not. I'm simply waiting to cross the road.
@JamesBlunt I'm in traffic but will get there.
@twitcrutt Nope. This weather is what we call February now.
@JoanneSalley sit in the back, or get in the back?
And why is that twat Miliband standing in a puddle, right next to dry land?
Why is Cameron wearing a high visibility jacket, and a hard hat? Just because it has rained?
@cliftonmthomas Seriously? I thought it was just a British thing.
No, we couldn't have filmed the quadski/Alfa race round Lake Windermere. Stupid speed limit. Italy is a free country.
@TheGrizzleGrams Oh no there wasn't.
@KarlBridal I wasn't drifting. I was clinging on for dear life.
RT @SHERRYShevor: @JeremyClarkson can i just thank you very much for not wearing helmet and life jacket on quad bike (H &amp; S gone mad)common…
@ADHeckmann That's like saying two necklaces are the same except one is made from gold and the other from tin foil.
@stephenfry Tottenham Hotspur mean business
@willchapman55 Because they sell it abroad. Are you always that stupid?
@rachrwlnds @docib I can swim!!!!!
@Shellydradio2 Because I'm not interested in health and safety
Complaining about a lack of proper road tests on Top Gear is like complaining about a lack of recipes on the News.	Tonight however.
@johnjmccmac No it wasn't.
Countryfile is now doing an item on semen. So. I'm setting myself a challenge to get the word "sperm" in next week's Top Gear.
@Andlox yes. Mad as a box.
Only 15 minutes now till the BBC4 documentary on 1950s fell walker, Alfred Wainwright.
What an extremely idiotic woman on Countryfile just then
Did I hear that right? A lady snowboarder said she decided to celebrate her successful run with a a "front flip off the knuckle".
@Adamdowling2 thanks.
@Sewell25David Trust me. Season tickets at the Bridge are not even adjacent to "free".
@AnthonyMorl Thanks mate.
@ianmyatt he knows
@LukeBoneyM I was pleased with that as well.
I couldn't make out the Newcastle chant at Stamford Bridge today. Would love to know what it was. Something about effing bast...
@RickJamesMCFC Try Sir Sugar
@markrmccracken I think you'll find we won.
@JoeTheWonderful So. Do you now speak Vietnamese?
@dyteski99 We have budgets and that's all we could afford. MORON
@LordGaryFarrow a darker blue than you'd expect
@LordGaryFarrow What a lovely day, isn't it.
@rberto813 the music has to be changed and the items shortened. To make way for commercials. It takes time.
@DHoops61 oh dear
@simon_greig @tiff_tv He won't.
Heartfelt thanks for the almost completely unanimous thumbs up for tonight's show. Next week, it's a bit more car orientated.
@GaryLineker Actually I want you ASAP
@JonGrace I have literally no idea what you are on about.
RT @RichardHammond: @JeremyClarkson actually he's playing a bewildered old man who turns up at the wrong .... No, wait a minute, that's Top…
@RichardHammond @MrJamesMay is watching Call the Midwife. Or do I mean "starring in"?
Less than an hour to go before Channel 4's interesting look at Swedish food.
RT @rees_rees50: @JeremyClarkson Please retweet, lost black flatcoated retriever, please help get this old dog back with her distraught own…
Just heard from the Stig. It seems, he supports Burton Albion.
That's interesting. There were no replies from Man U or Chelsea enthusiasts.
Does any other football club have a well known fan who they wish would support someone else?
Arsenal enthusiasts. Serious question. What's it like having Morgan as your most vociferous fan?
@willcarling I would have gone more defensive in the last 5 minutes. Is that the answer you wanted?
@willcarling I'm here.
@gleason72 it's a bit wobbly
Correction: there is something in the papers. Morgan says when CNN fires him it'll be because of his stand on gun control. Not cos he's a tw
@mooreiain Quite
@LButcher90 Yes. Because flooding only affects poor people.
When the 2nd item on the TV news talks of "waves hitting the sea front", you sort of know there won't be much in the papers. And there isn't
@katybluewater Is it because I speed up for horses?
Nice that the French have something to be pleased about.
@MrJamesMay Bring a gun. I'll supply the Range Rover.
@CalicoTrinket Next Sunday actually.
@MrJamesMay As our producer appears to be on Radio 2 this morning, would you like to go for a walk today?
@charltonbrooker Best thing on TV
Charlie Brooker's weekly wipe just gets better and better.
@MrJamesMay I know it's a bit cold and wet but would you like to go on a bicycle ride this morning?
We're back in the playground http://t.co/cjWxNzsxfp
@claire_neate You so aren't
Thankyou to the 82 people who turned up for my Soho House @richardpbacon interview this evening.
@richardpbacon Liar
@woodystc no. That was Stuart "wooly" Wostenholme
@chelseafc apart from the FA Cup
@ScottPetronasF1 SW10
Having spent all of yesterday afternoon standing in the rain, I am now going to spend this afternoon standing in the rain.
I spent all afternoon standing in the rain and my lungs are so full of water, I can't even smoke.
I can't decide whether to die, or have another drink.
I have caught double pneumonia.
@xCoxsApplex we aim to please
@xCoxsApplex In 8 days
@Markarina He's half right. I am driving a 911 this week. But in England.
RT @mark_phillips1: @BBC_TopGear any chance of getting rid of @JeremyClarkson the ratings will rocket once he's gone he's a boring tw@t
@Rob_Gsinger25 @BBC_TopGear @TannerFoust @TopGear_America You are right. He would. But we are so much cleverer.
Classic example of Americans not quite getting British understatement.	 http://t.co/zGFeSlWbnt
@rodgerpatterson He was a cool dude
I have deleted my last tweet and would like to apologise profusely to anyone who I upset while I was asleep.
Is it possible to blanket block cyclists?
@racingboo Are you being deliberately stupid?
@prodnose Those wheels
@camillalong @jonnyray666 @RachelSJohnson Yes.
@RachelSJohnson @camillalong I can't see what's wrong with them.
@realdeanporter @metpoliceuk And meanwhile I've contacted the fashion police about your shirt.
RT @lhgmk2: @JeremyClarkson cyclists are always angry. It makes them angry. When I cycled I was angry.
@danhinesuk I do.
It's weird to have so many angry cyclists following me here. In real life, it's usually the other way round.
@KerryMurdock I think that if you weren't so dreadfully bitter, you'd be able to see the car is stationary.
@prodnose Check out mine.
Motorists. When you sound your horn, how would you describe the sound?	Bib or Pip?
@theJeremyVine No. He. Does. Not.
Ti be clear, the cyclist I tweeted about earlier rode constantly right in the middle of the lane and hurled abuse at anyone who overtook.
It's middle of the road point-makers like this who make car drivers so angry about cyclists. http://t.co/4vCcK548t1
@SimonJCLeBON So I wasn't the only one. Interesting.
@DrKrakus On the contrary. I think he wanted to fight it. I think he hoped the cruisers would find it.
@RachelSJohnson stop what?
@RachelSJohnson Ah. Hair removal. One of your specialist subjects I seem to recall.
@RachelSJohnson Is Twitter in a bad mood today?
@eddie_1878 Not in 140 characters
I'm thinking of writing in my column on Saturday why I think Dudley Pound turned the warships round on PQ17. Would anyone like that?
@sniffpetrol Splitter
Thanks for all the kind comments about PQ17. I fear there can be no more of this type of doc because the people who were there....
@PaulineDevanney Because it was about PQ17. There was also no mention of the Padstow Tufty Club
@m4mick We've only asked a million times.
@Andymack So you are a huge fan then.
@RachelSJohnson is a friend of mine. She is pretty, bright, funny, interested, interesting and she has great hair.
@RachelSJohnson Yes.
Please don't be horrid to @RachelSJohnson
@RachelSJohnson Hang on....
@RachelSJohnson But the thing is, I think you'd enjoy it. I really really do.
“@RachelSJohnson: @JeremyClarkson Sounds a bit fluffy for me"		can someone who saw it put the poor girl right.
“@Mordi_Dily: @JeremyClarkson why? What's the point? Is anyone actually going too watch it.		Well? Is anyone?
@GilleanPayge Yes
They are repeating the PQ17 arctic convoys documentary tonight. BBC2. 9.30pm.
@martha_0429 have
Lots of people want to watch Top Gear and the BBC doesn't make them do it one at a time.
