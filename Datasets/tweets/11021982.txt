@gspeckmail @SuccessfulFarm In essence, it was "keep doing what you're doing" ...
President Trump understands the risks farmers take: Trump has a “natural affection and affinity for people on the land,” says #SecretarySonny #CommodityClassic19
#SecretarySonny on China: “I am cautiously optimistic on progress.” A sealed deal "can be a bonanza” for America, he says. #CommodityClassic19
As for trade and USMCA, Sec. Perdue says, "We live in the best neighborhood on Earth” with neighbors like Mexico and Canada. #commodityclassic
Secretary Perdue says EPA’s Wheeler knows to protect the "most endangered species – that’s the American farmer." #CommodityClassic2019
Perdue acknowledges the farm struggles: Not many businesses can stand a 50% drop in revenue and survive, he says. #CommodityClassic2019
“Farmers are pretty good at sizing up people,” says Sonny Perdue in Orlando. “Farmers can smell what you’ve been stepping in.”
Secretary Perdue at #CommodityClassic: "Last year, y’all hadn’t figured out if you liked me or not.”
