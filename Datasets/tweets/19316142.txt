#goags #beatstanford #ncaabasketball What's a 24 pt lead? We're making baskets and stealing the ball away. It's how well we play, right?
#goags #beatstanford #ncaabasketball Several at The Grad remember come-from-behind Aggie football win in 2005. Enjoying how we play now.
#goags #beatstanford #ncaabasketball Only a 6 point difference between Ags and Stanford. We can only dream.
#goags #beatstanford #ncaabasketball Alums in the Grad say they are here because they support our team and Aggie sports. Div 1 looms large.
#goags #beatstanford #marchmadness Fans in the stands and at the Grad are cheering madly for the Aggies. Paige Mintun is amazing.
#goags #beatstanford #marchmadness Even those with mixed loyalties got give Ags credit for their heart, facing team with 61 home wins.
#goags #beatstanford #marchmadness We just made some baskets. Hana Asano is short and mighty, giving hope to many who are height-challenged.
#goags #marchmadness 16 to 24, Cardinal favor. Aggies keep missing the basket. Those are mighty tall women on the Stanford team.
#goags #marchmadness Love my Aggies: Students say this game is about Aggie pride and going to Division 1 was worth it.
#ncaabasketball #goags Aggie women are giving Stanford a good game. Go Ags!
#goags #marchmadness Exciting to see the Ags actually go ahead...for a few minutes. The Grad is quite excited, full of studens and alums.
#marchmadness #goags #ncaabasketball How do U face a No. 1 seed wtih a 61-game winning streak? w/ Aggie pride coupled w/ courage. Go Ags!!!
#marchmadness #goags #ncaabasketball Aggies Coach Simpson: Big West champions ready 4 the experience, but we'll need a Perfect Aggie Storm.
#marchmadness #goags #ncaabasketball So, we're a No. 16 seed facing a No. 1 Stanford. Reporter Bruce Gallaudet gives hope to us underdogs.
#goags #ncaabasketball #marchmadness Funny headline 4 UC Davis: Cards stacked against Ags. Winning "next 2 impossible, not impossible."

#sncr Andria Carter suggests newspapers go to "hyperlocal" business model.  And do news in the same area: Sex tab in Trenton.
#sncr  market driven innovation strategy forces business to look at business while maintaining its creativity.
#sncr Smaller companies more fleet of social media feet.
#sncr Don Bulmer : LinkedIn top with 92 percent ; 51 % using Facebook; 41% using Twitter.  LinkedIn growing phenomenally.
#sncr  DiMauro: sr. executives using more SM and making faster decisions, using networks outside their company.
#sncr  Vanessa DiMauro says the lines of distinction are blurring among FB, Twitter and LinkedIn: because it's too hard to keep it apart?
#sncr  Third party buy-in: Community needs to adopt nonprofit causes, often problem is the nonprofit. People interested in activities.
RT @pgillin: @GeoffLiving Nonprofits usually contact u only when they want $. SM can create ongoing conversation. Big problem at u's. #sncr
@GeoffLiving: is nonprofit making an impact? accountability, the cost of entry is trust: big oppt. for foundations with charity databases.
#sncr @GeoffLiving Donors want to talk to other donors; loyalty is to causes, not the nonprofit. Large orgs have issues that cause mistrust.
RT @barbchamberlain: Donors not looking for info from nonprofits about how great they are :D. Show them real people/impacts w/SM. #sncr
#sncr @GeoffLiving Donors don't want to hear how great the nonprofits are. Don't trust the individual, trust crowds: social  media.
#sncr  @GeoffLiving chaotic and fragmented  conversation for philanthropics...high dollar donors uncomfortable talking about giving online.
#sncr @GeoffLiving Only 27 percent trust sources and info from non-profits in 30-49 segment; Humane Society is the exception.
#sncr @GeoffLiving study looking for high $ donors, asked how to engage on  SM. Oppt is with 30-49 yr segment. Older group = possibilities.

Higher a company is in Fortune 500, more likely to have a corporate blog.  &gt; 90 percent take comments...engagement=active and open. #sncr
16  percent  of corporations have a blog. #sncr
#sncr  Measuring and monitoring are lagging with nonprofits, too.
RT @mikerobert: 85% of colleges in 2008 used some form of social media but only 50% of their blogs offered RSS?? #sncr #highereducation
#sncr  Nonprofits are chin deep in social media: because it is free.  Doing better than universities and busimesses.
#sncr Barnes:  higher ed blogs with no comments (47 percent)..blogs were really message boards.
#sncr  Nora Barnes  says colleges and u's  85 percent are using some form of social media. But they aren't so good at it.
#sncr  Nora Barnes says monitoring is lagging in business as well as higher  ed.
#sncr  social networking, video, blogging  increases i 2008, but everything but social  networking slows dow n in 2009'
RT barbchamberlain Social Media Measurement 2009 by @kdpaine presented at Society for New Communicaitons Research. #sncr http://ff.im/-b2QDi
#sncr Move conversation from observation to getting volunteers to express support and it will get more engagement.
#sncr Local reporters use sm to deliver info about the universities (not coming from the universities)--mostly on Thursdays and Fridays.
#scnr No. of comments tells you where the friction is in your institution.
#sncr Engagement: ratio of posts to comments, but only a few types of conversations trigger the comments, such as questions.
#sncr KD's ultimate measurement--what does it cost to get a larger share of the conversation...think about emergency communications
#scnr plan social media to news...what an idea
#sncr Southwest social media team went from 2 to 13 by proving their work related in sold tickets. don't think will work at universities
#sncr Look for failures or when your peers/competition did better to learn about doing better in social media
#sm Higher ed is using YouTube and photos the best (compared to non-profits and consumers). that includes student videos...
#sm what is worse: to be talked about as being bad or not to be talked about at all?
2nd to last is picking the measurement tool: more important to understand mission, problems to solve by SM, what are U trying to change.
It's fundamental communication practice: understand your audiences and what motivates them and define what you want to become...
First: figure out your goals in using social media before you know what you are measuring...also define what are other influences?
Listening to K.D. Paine talk about measuring social media and how you have to be creative to find data to measure.
