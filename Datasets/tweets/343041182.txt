Despite the tragic circumstances of their birth, some people who survived abortions are living and thriving today. Their life stories inspire us to fight for the dignity of every human being. Meet Gianna Jessen:	https://t.co/UHANysvs8b
Abortion survivors are not fiction, they're real. At least 11 babies were born alive during abortions in Florida in 2017. That's one state in one year. We have no idea how many survive nationwide‚Äîsome statistics are too uncomfortable to collect.	https://t.co/WCELQAoMuo
Abortion defenders don't want you to think too hard about what we owe the survivors of abortion, because you might start thinking about what we owe them earlier in life.
Tonight Senate Democrats defeated a bill that would require abortion doctors to give life-saving care to babies born alive during abortions. This is a grave injustice. But the pro-life movement will keep fighting until our society recognizes &amp; protects every human being.

10. And if mass amnesty without real reform, eg, the DREAM Act, were so popular, Dems would've shut down government over it. But it's not, they know it, &amp; that's why they folded &amp; passed a funding bill without amnesty. THE END.
9. @realDonaldTrump is right when he calls things like the diversity lottery &amp; chain migration "a joke." That's the exact kind of bipartisan, conventional orthodoxy that he defied in 2016, which contributed in no small part to his victory.
8. The "humanitarian program" for Haitians is TPS, or Temporary Protected Status. That's right, the T stands for temporary. TPS covers things like natural disasters, as Haiti suffered in 2010. It doesn't cover living standards lower than US.
7. The way to solve a refugee crisis is not immigration policy, but wise foreign policy. Eight years of feckless foreign policy under President Obama is one reason the world faces so many refugee crises.
6. And it's plainly better &amp; cheaper to keep refugees in their region than to remove them. I've been to a Syrian refugee camp. They wanted to go home, not go to Europe or US. Besides, we can't possibly resettle every potential refugee out of their region.
5. Plus, President Obama only increased refugee quota to 110k in final years of his tenure, partly as a result of his disastrous Syria policy. Average actual refugee admissions (not paper quota) is close to where @realDonaldTrump set it this year.
4. The State Department does not set annual refugee numbers under the law. That responsibility belongs to @POTUS alone. State can advise; he decides.
3. Likewise, I did not use, nor would I use, the phrase "anti-immigrant conservatives." Again, you can thank this kind of thinking for Trump's victory, Brexit, Merkel being unable to form a government ... I could go on.
2. It's not a "nativist view" to say immigration policy should be crafted to benefit American citizens, not foreigners. Slandering "white working-class Americans" with that term is an example of the closed thinking that helped Trump win.
@realDonaldTrump 1. It's a very peculiar view of American democracy to say the elected president is "defying" the unelected bureaucracy. I suspect @nytimes would never run that headline about, say, President Obama.

3. Hated O'care mandate is arrogant, unprecedented &amp; hits working families hardest. That's why is so unpopular, in fact hated!
2. 53k Arkansans fined by O'care made less than $50k! Hated O'care mandate is direct tax on working families &amp; poor people.
1. Senate repeal of hated O'care mandate means 65k Arkansans fined last year because they couldn't afford insurance will soon get relief.

So, let's repeal O'care mandate to make tax bill better &amp; easier to pass, down payment on health care, &amp; to keep promises. 12/12
And repealing mandate is biggest step we could take for now to repeal O'care as we promised. Americans expect us to act! 11/?
Repealing mandate doesn't take a penny from O'care spending on Medicaid or exchanges. Just stops IRS from fining people! 10/?
Dems say: "15M lose insurance!" Nonsense! Repealing mandate only means IRS can't fine Americans for not being able to afford insurance. 9/?
Besides, repealing mandate makes tax bill EASIER to pass, certainly easier than finding $300B by repealing popular deductions. 8/?
Some GOP say: "can't do health care with taxes." Nonsense! Mandate is a tax! SCOTUS &amp; Obama admin said so. IRS collects! Paid on 1040! 7/?
Both House &amp; Senate have voted to repeal O'care individual mandate. Should be easy vote as part of tax-cut package. 6/?
Plus, mandate is (rightly!) most unpopular part of O'care. Why repeal popular tax deductions when $300B available from mandate repeal?! 5/?
Repealing mandate is itself a tax cut for working families! 5/6th of all families paying fine earn less than median income. 4/?
$300 billion pays for a lot lower tax rates for families &amp; businesses, much better than repealing popular, widespread deductions. 3/?
Repealing individual mandate saves $300 billion over 10 years. $300 billion! CBO said so during health-care debate last summer. 2/?

2nd attempt to enroll in Obamacare even worse. No wonder .@SenMarkPryor wants to keep exemption #arsen #arpx http://t.co/nCAthdD00g
I believe families should come before big business &amp; Congress shouldn't be treated better than the American people. #Obamacare
I tried to enroll in Obamacare this am &amp; this happened. Ready for delay yet, .@SenMarkPryor #arsen #arpx http://t.co/YMy6j0n3Zq
.@SenMarkPryor No, shutdown confirms you'd rather keep your Obamacare exemption than keep govt open. #arsen #arpx
"Obamacare for AR, but not for me" MT @SenMarkPryor: There's no special exemption for Congress under ACA. House claim is false &amp; misleading.
Didn't read O'care then or now MT @SenMarkPryor: There's no special exemption for Congress under ACA. House claim is false &amp; misleading.
.@SenMarkPryor had simple choice: keep govt open or keep his special Obamacare exemption. He put himself first, not Arkansas. #arsen #arpx
.@SenMarkPryor just voted to keep his special exemption from Obamacare. What's good for Arkansans isn't good enough for him. #arsen #arpx

Obama's spokesman compared Republicans fighting Obamacare to suicide bombers. Here's my response: http://t.co/zjjG8Vn5df
I've voted to defund, repeal and stop #Obamacare in the House. Sen. Mark Pryor won't even support a year delay of the individual mandate.
Obama gave big business a year break from #Obamacare. Why won't Mark Pyror support giving the American people the same break?
Americans are stuck w/ #Obamacare's obligations while Congress receives subsidies exempting them. http://t.co/PpVaEbsHX3
