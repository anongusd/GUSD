Washington Post reporters talked to dozens of people from Ralph's childhood, black and white, who saw the racist image on his yearbook page and said the same thing: "That's not the Ralph I knew."
During an ROTC summer at Fort Bragg, Ralph and his VMI roommate were headed home for 4th of July wknd. The friend said there was no room in his Camaro for a black woman in Ralph's platoon who also lived on the Shore. But Ralph insisted they give her a ride.
"Now, everybody tells an off-color joke about Jews or homosexuals or blacks — that's just the nature of our society," said one old family friend who transferred to the private school. "But I never heard anything like that" from Ralph.
When desegregation came (late) in 1970, Ralph and his brother stayed in the public schools. Many friends fled to a private school billed as a launching pad to college that was, in fact, an all-white enclave. Ralph played on a mostly black basketball team.
To know Ralph Northam is to know Virginia's Eastern Shore, where he grew up surrounded by water on a "neck" called Breezy Point w/ only about a half-dozen other white homes. Black kids lived in different part of town; some never learned to swim. https://t.co/X9O1mCpHox

“It’s unfortunate the govt is expending resources on prosecuting long-term legal residents who didn’t realize they couldn’t vote and were voting because they felt pride in the U.S.,” his atty said. “Deporting them would be such a disproportionate penalty for a minor offense.”
One Mexican Green Card holder, a legal resident since 1992 married to a US citizen, has been held in an ICE detention center 600 miles from his home since his August sentencing on two misdemeanors of illegal voting.
Meanwhile, the alleged ballot tampering led by political operative McCrae Dowless continued and possibly swung the 9th congressional district race in Nov. Most of the immigrants have plead to misdemeanors w/ minimal penalties. But now they could face deportation.
President Trump claimed "millions" of immigrants voted illegally in 2016, but these 21 prosecutions amount to the biggest vote-fraud case so far and did not affect the outcome of any vote.
Despite repeated warnings about ballot tampering ring in eastern NC, US atty instead prosecuted 21 immigrants for illegally voting in 2016 -- mostly Green Card holders who thought they were allowed to cast ballots. W/ @AmyEGardner and @alice_crites. https://t.co/5RR9xwjqA1

There were follow-up emails and mtgs with feds. But a reminder about Dowless’s mail-in ballot activities was sent to wrong FBI email address one month before the 2018 election. https://t.co/DtPDlMl8Og
“I really expected something would be done about this,” said Linda Johnson-Baldwin, one of three voters who filed complaints about dubious absentee ballot collection in 2016. Told DOJ knew about her complaint, she asked, “So was anything done about it?”
So DOJ knew. The FBI knew. Fed and state prosecutors in Raleigh knew. Yet Dowless kept working campaigns. And now Republican Mark Harris waits and waits as officials refuse to certify narrow congressional win amid allegations vote tainted by Dowless’s allegedly illegal tactics.
As recently as one month before the 2018 election, NC elections board investigator sent reminder e-mail to the FBI about Dowless and warned that Bladen County was requesting an unusually high number of mail-in ballots.
The chief of the public integrity section in DOJ’s criminal division met w/ NC election officials and one year ago in Raleigh. A follow-up e-mail to DOJ laid out evidence of how Dowless sought to manipulate mail-in vote in 2016.
Justice Department knew about allegations of mail-in ballot fraud against campaign operative McCrae Dowless months before he was accused of using same tactics in 2018 congressional race in NC. https://t.co/cKVY3h9grs

Photo of the smiling Saudi crown prince from April visit to a Lockheed Martin site remains on company website, even as other corporations distance themselves since Khashoggi’s slaying. https://t.co/Zm49tzUE7f
But outreach by defense industry to the Hill has fallen off since Khashoggi's death. “If I was Raytheon or Boeing or Lockheed, I would keep my damn trap shut and my head low because this is bad for the Saudis,” said one Republican Senate aide.
Raytheon CEO Thomas Kennedy paid personal visit to chair of Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September, one month after U.S.-made bomb killed more than 50 people, including at least 40 children, on a school-bus field trip.
“I’m pretty confident that we will weather this complexity,” Raytheon chief executive Thomas Kennedy said in earnings call, without mentioning Khashoggi’s name. Raytheon bomb was blamed for April 23 attack on wedding in Yemen that left 22 people dead.
Defense contractors are accustomed to getting their way in Washington. Congress has voted only once to block foreign arms deal through joint resolution of disapproval -- in 1986, and it was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan.
"I don’t want to create jobs by selling weapons to governments that murder journalists in cold blood and then lie about it,” said one lawmaker whose district includes Raytheon, whose bombs have been used to kill civilians in Yemen, one of the poorest countries in the Middle East.
