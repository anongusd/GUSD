@LaylaAlisha11 It's so tragic, but honestly I've been saying for years that someone shouldn't be charged with double murder if killing a pregnant woman. Abortion is murder just like killing the child in the womb by someone else. We can't have double standards. KILLING UNBORN IS MURDER!

@AponiTitianna @CVoellinger @GOPLeader Preach it! Most of my ancestors who fought for the Confederacy were Native American. During that time the US census listed many of my ancestors as free people of color or mulattos based on how dark they were. Light ones were listed as white.

@CrielloMec @CVoellinger @GOPLeader So if that's your argument, I hate to tell you but the entire country is based on this principal.
