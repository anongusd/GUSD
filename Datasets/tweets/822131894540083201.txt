@CoryBooker is on 🔥 grilling #williambarr on his views of criminal justice, mass incarceration, and racial bias in the system. Whether Barr still believes that mass incarceration has benefited black communities.
Sessions' memo was designed to restrict consent decrees &amp; was a slap in the face to the dedicated career staff at DOJ who work to enforce our civil rights laws. Barr's response does not comfort those of us who care about remedying patterns &amp; practices of unconstitutional conduct.
.@maziehirono asked Barr if he agrees w/ these Sessions actions: 1) Family separation. 2) Refusing to defend ACA. 3) Failing to bring any lawsuits enforcing VRA. 4) Issuing memo making it harder for Civil Rights Division to enter into consent decrees. Said he agrees w/ last one.

@SenatorDurbin asking #WilliamBarr if he agrees with family separation policy. Barr says he doesn’t have all info given he isn’t in DOJ. But that didn’t stop him from publicly opining on Sally Yates’ decision not to enforce the Muslim Ban, Mueller investigation etc.

Remember: Civil rights work, including the fight for meaningful justice reform, has never been easy. We won't always get the *perfect* piece of reform legislation. But we can’t win if we don’t fight.		And @civilrightsorg is committed to being in that fight for the long haul.
.@civilrightsorg will continue to advocate for meaningful justice reform in the future, because the #FirstStepAct is truly just the beginning. Congress has much more work to do to achieve the transformational change that will end mass incarceration in America. So do we.
#FirstStepAct continues to exclude people from benefiting from some provisions based solely on their prior offenses, namely citizenship &amp; immigration status, as well as certain prior drug convictions and their "risk score" as determined by a discriminatory risk assessment system.
But #FirstStepAct falls short in many ways. Several sentencing provisions don't apply to people currently incarcerated and it excludes too many people from earning time credits. Troublingly, it also allows private prison companies to profit &amp; fails to include parole for children.
The #FirstStepAct would revise mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses, including finally making retroactive the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act that reduced the crack-powder sentencing disparity. And it would fix the ‘good time’ credit calculation. That's critical.
Over the past several months, @civilrightsorg has worked closely with Senate offices and our coalition members to reach commonsense solutions that promote justice and fairness across the system – and the #FirstStepAct now offers some important improvements.
When the House passed the original #FirstStepAct in May, @civilrightsorg and more than 100 of our coalition members &amp; partners opposed the bill because it excluded sentencing reform &amp; abandoned years of painstaking, bipartisan efforts to construct a comprehensive reform package.
Bringing fairness and dignity to our justice system is one of the most important civil and human rights issues of our time. But we need to be clear about this: The #FirstStepAct is just that – a good first step. There’s so much more work to do to fix our justice system. Thread:

It is hard to be a woman in this room watching all of these men repeatedly apologize to Kavanaugh for his treatment after they were stone faced silent when Dr Blasey Ford spoke her truth for hours.
@CoryBooker pushing Kavanaugh about whether he wished Ford had remained silent and whether he thinks she is a political operative or hack. Kavanaugh responds by highlighting witnesses who said they didn't recall the alleged attack.
How many times can it be said that a senate staff investigation by people who have expressed a clear bias against Dr Blasey Ford is not a substitute for reopening the FBI bkgd inv, which is standard procedure in these circumstances.
All of these male Republican senators who didn’t trust themselves to ask questions of Dr Blasey Ford respectfully now relishing their chance to give monologues, sympathizing with Kavanaugh, expressing outrage and fury. Note the prosecutor is now just sitting there.
Watching @senorrinhatch be sarcastic and incredulous about Dr Blasey Ford’s experience of sexual violence reminds me of how he treated Anita Hill 27 years ago. How little has changed for some.

Kavanaugh’s rage and partisan fury make it even more disturbing to think of him as a justice on the highest court of the land.

Kavanaugh is getting their rapt attention. TV should show the faces of senators. The contrast is just remarkable. https://t.co/S5leLyL4MO
The emotion among Republican senators listening to Kavanaugh is in stark contrast to how they listened to Dr Blasey Ford give her heart wrenching opening statement. Cornyn tearing up. No such emotion from them during first half of this hearing. They see themselves in him.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony today underscores the absolute necessity for an FBI investigation into all sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. Unless and until that investigation happens, senators must immediately halt this nomination process.
Thank you, Dr. Blasey Ford. https://t.co/OluPk7T9ke

Republicans have no answer for why the FBI should not investigate other than their haste to dismiss survivors of sexual assault.		They are now facing a decency test. We know Trump failed it long ago, but the question is whether every Republican senator will fail it as well.
Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Ms. Deborah Ramirez have risked everything to come forward with their serious allegations. In a demonstration of their credibility, they have both asked that the FBI conduct a fair and nonpartisan investigation into these sexual assault claims.
The leader of the Republican party is again blaming sexual assault survivors. This must stop. And it will only stop if members of his own party actually stand up to him and demand that these brave women alleging sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh be heard and be respected.

Census citizenship question is just the beachhead. It goes hand in hand with efforts to purge voters and restrict voting rights; with moves to strip citizenship from American citizens; and with schemes to revoke birthright citizenship, which is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.
The census, independence of the Justice Department and the federal courts, voting rights and voting access — these are all core functions of our democracy that are being weaponized for a partisan agenda, an agenda born out of deep anti-immigrant, anti-people-of-color sentiment.
They’re seeking to redefine and restructure American democracy to preserve their political power at a time when the demographics of this country are changing significantly.
The involvement of people like Steve Bannon and Kris Kobach says everything you need to know about what the real rationale for the question was. These are individuals who, along with Jeff Sessions, have long had a deeply anti-immigrant agenda.

The census must be above partisan politics, and we will continue to support efforts in Congress and the courts to remove this unnecessary citizenship question to ensure an accurate count. Congress must also further investigate this matter so the truth can be heard. #SaveTheCensus
It’s clear now that the decision to add a citizenship question was made without thought to the consequences for the census or its scientific integrity. All the efforts that followed were simply an attempt to justify a political decision.
In another email from September 2017, the Department of Justice noted that they “can do whatever” Commerce needs them to do, and that the “AG is eager to assist.”
In response, a senior Commerce political appointee noted the need to “work with” the Justice Department to “get them to request” the addition of a citizenship question.
In one May 2017 email, @SecretaryRoss complains that he is “mystified why nothing [has] been done in response to [his] months old request that we include the citizenship question.”
These latest documents only further reinforce a simple fact: from the beginning, political operatives like Steve Bannon pushed this unnecessary census citizenship question for purely political reasons. https://t.co/PKnDl4TV3W

There should be no sides when it comes to the census. It’s the bedrock of our representative democracy. @civilrightsorg and our coalition are proud to support leaders across the country who are defending the census — and ensuring no one gets left behind. 8/
States, cities, counties, civil rights and immigrant rights groups, and the bipartisan @usmayors have already sued to have the question removed. Now it’s the people’s turn to raise their collective voices by flooding @CommerceGov with opposition to the citizenship question. 7/
This morally bankrupt decision will affect everyone, with communities that are already at risk of being undercounted — including people of color, young children, and low-income rural and urban residents — suffering the most. 6/
The documents also show that the Census Bureau warned Commerce Department leadership about the disastrous results, including depressed response rates, increased costs, and inaccurate data that the nation would have to live with for the next 10 years. 5/
Thanks to documents released by DOJ as part of one of the six federal lawsuits challenging the decision, we know the real motivation behind it. Extremists like Kris Kobach &amp; Steve Bannon urged the admin to include a citizenship question to further their anti-immigrant agenda. 4/
After @uscensusbureau spent nearly a decade carefully preparing and testing questions to be included on the #2020Census, Commerce @SecretaryRoss caved to political pressure in March of this year and directed the bureau to add a question on citizenship to the census form. 3/
The Census Bureau has invited the public to comment on the #2020Census, including the questions that will appear on the form. That means the American people can speak directly to the Trump administration about its misguided actions to undermine the integrity of the 2020 count. 2/
Important: The #2020Census is one of the most urgent civil rights issues facing the country — and right now, every person in America has the opportunity to help ensure the count is fair and accurate for all communities. This thread explains how (plus some background). 1/

And all of us must speak out for our communities – and for our country. Our democracy is worn, but not beyond repair. Not if people of conscience defend our nation’s highest values and act today. /end
Senators must demand the impartiality of the federal courts. Members of Congress must push for the full restoration of the VRA. Civil rights lawyers must keep up the pressure in the courtrooms. Organizers must debunk false narratives about voter fraud and register people to vote.
And because of opposition by civil rights groups, four of Trump’s most ideologically extreme judicial nominees have been forced to withdraw. Every one of us can make a difference. And every one of us has a powerful voice – and vote – in building an America as good as its ideals.
Hope is not lost. The civil rights community helped force the dissolution of Trump’s sham voter suppression commission led by Pence &amp; Kris Kobach. A district court dealt another blow to Kobach last week when it struck down KS’s documentary proof-of-citizenship law for voter reg.
Make no mistake: This is no longer about party or politics. The Trump administration seeks to fundamentally change the rules of the game – and dismantle our democracy in the process.
The admin's actions add up to a frightening conclusion: Trump and his enablers are warping the rule of law to serve their own purposes. They are corroding the integrity of our institutions to further their own partisan ends. And they are diminishing the power of we the people.
And @SecretaryRoss announced he'll add a citizenship question to the #2020Census. This untested question will lower response rates &amp; lead to an inaccurate count. Because the census determines apportionment of political power, vulnerable communities will be silenced &amp; left behind.
But the threat to voting rights – and to a fair and just democracy – is bigger than the federal courts. Trump’s Cabinet is working overtime to fuel his massive voter suppression machine. In the Husted case, for example, AG Jeff Sessions reversed the federal government’s position.
Some of Trump’s judicial nominees did more than defend racist voter suppression laws following Shelby County v. Holder. Nominees like Andrew Oldham, Britt Grant, and Andrew Brasher filed briefs that actively argued for the evisceration of the Voting Rights Act from the start.
Thomas Farr, for example, was a leading architect of NC's discriminatory voter law, defended the state’s racial gerrymanders of legislative districts, and was involved with a notorious voting scheme against African-American communities while working for the late Sen. Jesse Helms.
Five years later, the landscape is worse: The Republican voter suppression campaign now has the enthusiastic endorsement of the nation’s president – a president who is stacking the federal courts with the very people who cheered the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act.
Within 24 hours of the decision, the conservative justices prompted a deluge of voter suppression legislation. Texas and Alabama announced plans to plow ahead with restrictive and previously blocked voter-ID laws. Weeks later, N.C. passed its monster voter suppression law.
Five years ago, five justices on the Supreme Court invalidated key provisions of the Voting Rights Act that for decades protected voters in states with pernicious histories of voting discrimination. Don't forget what happened in the immediate aftermath of this appalling decision: https://t.co/kYkHqbE50V

The weaponization of the census for political reasons will have dire consequences for everything we care about. It is unacceptable. Whether through the courts or the legislative process, the citizenship question must be removed from the census.
DOJ’s production omits entire categories of requested documents, incl communications btwn WH and DOJ explaining why warnings by Census Bureau career experts were ignored or overruled. @RepCummings is having none of it and asking @TGowdySC to issue subpoena for these docs.
Also in these docs is internal memo from@Chief Scientist at Census Bureau to Sec Ross from Jan 2018: adding citizenship Q “is v costly, harms the quality of census count, and would use substantially less accurate citizenship status data than are available from admin sources.”
BREAKING: DOJ docs prove that Kobach and Bannon are behind Census citizenship Q.

We’re proud to support @AGSchneiderman, Ellen Rosenblum @ORDOJ, and other elected leaders across the country who are defending the #2020Census ─ and the very foundation of our democracy. #SaveTheCensus 10/10
The civil rights community is joining those voices, and with leading states, to say: this decision is wrong for our communities, it’s wrong for our country, and it’s wrong for our democracy. #SaveTheCensus 9/
We have seen a groundswell of bipartisan opposition to this question from business leaders, mayors, members of Congress, former Census Bureau directors from Republican and Democratic administrations, statistical experts, and others. #SaveTheCensus 8/
While the census may have political consequences, the conduct of the census must be strictly nonpartisan and non-political. There should be no sides when it comes to the census; it is the bedrock of our representative democracy. #SaveTheCensus 7/
The Constitution clearly outlines the purpose of the census: to count all U.S. residents, regardless of background, every 10 years, as the basis for apportionment of political power. #SaveTheCensus 6/
.@SecretaryRoss’s decision was a failure of leadership. And given that it was made over the objections and advice of census experts, former Census Directors, and career Census Bureau staff, it was a capitulation to President Trump’s craven, nativist agenda. #SaveTheCensus 5/
It’s laughable that Jeff Sessions, an Attorney General who has so far failed to protect voting rights, has suddenly found a need to enforce the law. #SaveTheCensus 4/
Since enactment of the VRA in 1965, the census has not included a question on citizenship ─ which means this data has never been necessary to enforce our civil and voting rights laws. I should know: I was the head of the division at DOJ responsible for enforcing the VRA. 3/

We hope that the Trump administration won’t take this step. But the civil and human rights community will respond should they do. 13/13
The civil rights community doesn’t want that. Our nation doesn’t want that. And we don’t believe that @SecretaryRoss wants that. But again, he’s facing a simple question: will he or won’t he protect the integrity and credibility of our census? 12/
In fact, new @uscensusbureau research already is ringing alarm bells about the growing reluctance of immigrant households to participate in any Census Bureau surveys – all due to the “climate of fear” created by the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant policies and rhetoric. 11/
This could cause hundreds of thousands of people in our communities to avoid the #2020Census out of a real concern of being targeted by this president. 10/
To be clear, asking every household and every person in the country about their citizenship status in the current political environment will contribute to the climate of fear – particularly when there's no legal basis to do so. 9/
Beyond legal objections, this unnecessary question will cause panic and alarm. It's unnecessarily intrusive and will raise concerns in all households not only about the confidentiality of information provided to the government – but also how government authorities may use it. 8/
Estimates of the citizen voting-age population derived from the ongoing American Community Survey, and the census “long” form before that, have been more than sufficient for civil rights and Voting Rights Act enforcement. 7/
Since enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the census has not included a question on citizenship on the form sent to all households – which means that this data has never been necessary to enforce our civil and voting rights laws. 6/
But more importantly, their argument is factually incorrect, morally bankrupt, and legally wrong. The Justice Department does not need this question to enforce civil rights protections or the Voting Rights Act. 5/
One, this administration has been downright hostile to Voting Rights Act protections specifically, and civil rights overall. So it’s laughable to think they suddenly found religion on protecting voting rights now. 4/
As someone who had the specific responsibility of enforcing the Voting Rights Act, I find this argument incredible for two reasons. 3/
We know how others in the Trump administration and Trump Campaign would answer this question. In their letter to @CommerceGov, Trump Justice Department officials claimed that this citizenship question is necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 2/
We need to talk about the addition of a citizenship question to the #2020Census.		Here's a question for @SecretaryRoss: Will you protect the integrity &amp; accuracy of the census, or will you yield to political pressure and pollute the credibility and fairness of the census? 1/

Direct evidence of the political agenda behind DOJ’s request that the census ask for citizenship status. https://t.co/QA2lYAN7C5
We must reject efforts to further politicize this crisis. We cannot just do what feels good, or sounds good. We must take an evidenced-based approach to ending the opioid crisis. 9/9
We tried the punitive and overly simplistic approach of the War on Drugs approach 30 years ago, and it failed. That’s why we’re seeing, in states around the country, a bipartisan push to recognize that substance use requires a public health approach. 8/
In addition, we must invest in public health approaches, drug abuse education, and comprehensive treatment programs that have proven to be successful in reducing drug use, drug crime, and recidivism rates. 7/
The #SentencingReform and Corrections Act would give federal judges discretion in sentencing people below a mandatory minimum sentence for low level drug cases and curb outsized sentences. This is a smart approach to the issue. 6/
Instead of the Trump proposal, we should pursue efforts like the bipartisan #SentencingReform and Corrections Act, recently approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. 5/
We all want safe and thriving communities that provide opportunities to all. But, the record is clear: increasing sentences for drug convictions will not contribute to public safety, but will bear heavy fiscal, social, and human costs. 4/
This is more than just a criminal justice issue – it is a public health issue. Therefore, we cannot incarcerate our way out of this crisis. 3/
Unfortunately, the Trump administration is using the same broken playbook on criminal justice. They're seeking a decidedly punitive approach to America’s drug problem – one that seeks to increase already disproportionate sentences for drug offenses &amp; employ the death penalty. 2/
For more than 3 decades, we've enacted sentencing policies that are racially and ethnically biased and have contributed to incarceration on a scale that exists nowhere else in the world. Decades of past experience have shown that we cannot punish ourselves out of this crisis. 1/ https://t.co/tliT5blojE

Dems need to stand strong, as they did on Friday. Can’t go for McConnell’s empty promises - we’ve heard those before. Republicans must end the #TrumpShutdown with a bipartisan solution for Dreamers, CHIP, the military, and disaster relief.
The civil rights community calls for an end to this crisis of leadership, an end to the false promises, and an end to the #TrumpShutdown. We need this right now.
Most importantly, we need bipartisan leadership to end this crisis. And we desperately need this now. Not three weeks from now. #TrumpShutdown
We need a bipartisan solution that protects Dreamers. We need a bipartisan deal to provide medical coverage to vulnerable children. We need bipartisan action to help American towns and cities recovering from record-breaking disasters. We need this all now, not 3 weeks from now.
More than 2K more Dreamers will be at risk by February 8, losing their ability to work and opening them up to immediate detention and deportation. Simply put: A DREAM deferred is a dream denied for thousands in our country. Democrats must stand strong. #TrumpShutdown
Now we hear empty offers from @SenateMajLdr about a promise to allow a mere Senate vote within 3 weeks. We've heard this record before - just last month. It’s simply a broken record repeating the same broken promises. Democrats must not dance to McConnell’s tune. #TrumpShutdown
Trump shut down any semblance of leadership among Republicans in Congress. In fact, the only thing Trump hasn’t shut down is his Twitter account. #TrumpShutdown
The #TrumpShutdown was months in the making. First, Trump shut down DACA – imperiling thousands of Dreamers. Then, he shut down bipartisan proposals to solve the crisis he created. Since then, he's shut down talks to keep the government open.
Following an entire weekend of blaming and posturing, @realDonaldTrump and Republican Congressional leaders continue to obstruct bipartisan efforts to solve this crisis. I call for an end to the disastrous #TrumpShutdown.

When cameras are rolling, Trump talks of passing a bipartisan “bill of love” to protect Dreamers. But like many reality stars, he sings a different tune when the cameras are off.  In this case, a racist &amp; disgusting tune. And it seems to be the soundtrack of this administration.
@realDonaldTrump The more than 200 civil and human rights organizations that comprise the @civilrightsorg coalition stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Dreamers. Their fight is our fight. Their dreams are our dreams. Because, ultimately, their future is our future. #DreamActNow
@realDonaldTrump We have no time to spare. Republicans and Democrats in Congress MUST prove that our values and principles are more than words by passing bipartisan legislation by January 19. #DreamActNow
@realDonaldTrump The time to pass the Dream Act is now. Congressional Republicans cannot watch silently as the president derails bipartisan efforts to protect Dreamers. #DreamActNow
@realDonaldTrump To the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers and their families, this is not about the president, political parties, or inside-the-Beltway policy debates: This is about their lives. An estimated 122 Dreamers lose their status and work authorization each day. We have no time to spare.
@realDonaldTrump The simple fact is: Trump created a crisis by ending DACA. And he doubles-down on his bad bet with each vulgar insult, each day of political brinkmanship, and with each obstruction of a bipartisan solution.
We must all continue to condemn, in the strongest possible terms, @realDonaldTrump's vulgar and disgusting outburst. His words are simply racist, repugnant, and reprehensible. And they have no place in our political discourse.

And ultimately, we need to recognize that these cameras are just a tool, not a substitute, for broader reforms needed to address police misconduct, build trust between police &amp; communities of color, and ultimately fix our broken justice system.
Here's why this matters: Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that body-worn cameras could be used in ways that threaten civil and constitutional rights and intensify the disproportionate surveillance of communities of color.
We're also releasing a report called “The Illusion of Accuracy: How Body-Worn Camera Footage Can Distort Evidence.” It explains why police departments need to carefully limit law enforcement officers’ review of body-worn camera footage. https://t.co/RhmjK31Dwx
