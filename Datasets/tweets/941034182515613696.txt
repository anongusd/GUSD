‚ÄúF*ck you, Melanie." Tweeted  Griffin ‚Äî who was investigated last year after doing a photo shoot with a bloody, decapitated head that looked like President Trump ‚Äî is arguably looking for any reason to complain about her failing career. https://t.co/kX9RQ9GjW2
In October, Griffin referred to White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders as ‚ÄúSarah F**kabee‚Äù while speaking at Politicon.  Before that, she incorrectly referred to First Lady Melania Trump as ‚ÄúMelanie‚Äù and called her a ‚Äúpiece of sh*t.‚Äù https://t.co/kX9RQ9GjW2
Using foul language, particularly toward Trump and members of his administration, has become common for the far-left comedian.  Should Trump pardon General Flynn? VOTE HERE https://t.co/kX9RQ9GjW2
In response, Griffin resorted to her typical use of vitriolic language.  VOTE NOW: Should Trump seize El Chapo‚Äôs $14.8 billion to help fund the border wall?  ‚ÄúJust shut the f*ck up and prepare for prison,‚Äù she wrote. https://t.co/kX9RQ9GjW2
‚ÄúIf you do not stop recording in my store, I‚Äôm going to call the police and ask you to leave,‚Äù the irate employee screamed.  He continued, ‚ÄúF*ck off dude! F*ck off! Get the f*ck out of here!‚Äù the employee screamed as he assaulted the customer. https://t.co/CnmdPAKTx2

TWITTER‚ÄôS SPEECH POLICY ENFORCEMENTS ARE SHODDY, INCONSISTENT, AND AIMLESS https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
When Jones was getting de-platformed by almost every other social network and online service, Twitter remained steadfastly committed to keeping him on the platform. All the while, @Twitter CEO @Jack Dorsey tied himself itself into knots to justify why https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Alex Jones, the Infowars conspiracy theorist whose antics, once reserved for the fringe corners of the internet, have blown up on a national scale thanks to a Trump endorsement https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Twitter, which has long prided itself as a platform for free expression, has found itself in hot water over the summer when it failed to combat the narrative that it ‚Äúshadow bans‚Äù conservatives  known to be abusive. https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
@SteelTyton @EinsteinMaga @JimCarrey Isn't .@JimCarrey from here...in #Canada ? 		He has no say in american politics...does he ?		He has no horse in that race.
Where this kind of online toxicity has gotten particularly tricky for Twitter as a company, especially in 2018, is when it deals with bans, verification, and perceived bias against conservatives. https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Twitter‚Äôs tools around abuse have continued to improve over the years, but there‚Äôs no silver bullet that will suddenly make everyone act nicer to one another. The culture war is embedded deep in Twitter‚Äôs DNA https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
The larger issue here is that there‚Äôs little Twitter can do to stop this. It can‚Äôt police how pretend angry or real angry its users are, and it can only do so much to stop brigading, harassment campaigns https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
So the end result is that 2018 became the year many Twitter users began purging their tweet histories. Search ‚ÄúHow to delete your Twitter history‚Äù right now on Google https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
these behaviors are foul, and the companies folding to them under pressure are too weak-willed and image-conscious to take a proper stand. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped the strategy from working. https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn was the most notable target this year, fired from the third film in the franchise by Disney after alt-right trolls used years-old jokes on Twitter to insinuate he was secretly a pedophile. https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
right-leaning communities wielding feigned offense to achieve online victories against the social justice movement. Today those tactics are used to greater effect on people https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
if you happened to tweet edgy jokes or if you in general have bad opinions and like sharing them with the world. In 2018, the concept of ‚Äúthe ratio‚Äù ‚Äî when the number of replies on a tweet far outweigh the likes and retweets ‚Äî became common knowledge https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Perhaps more than any other non-Trump related Twitter trend this year, one that felt most prominent was the collective realization that our old tweets exist only to harm us. https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
2018 INTRODUCED THE TWITTER CONCEPT OF ‚ÄúTHE RATIO‚Äù https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Twitter is the right‚Äôs access to an increasingly online mainstream America ‚Äî and it‚Äôs clear they‚Äôll never give it up. And although calls for Twitter to ban Trump continue https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Twitter remains Trump‚Äôs most vital communication platform. Despite continued complaints from the president himself and countless conservative commentators over perceived liberal bias https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Twitter are opening the app every day at an increasing rate. And as part of a widespread bot crackdown to combat election interference and particularly resilient crypto scams, Twitter actually lost users https://t.co/vXRReJibJx

basic function and not much else. Live streaming with Periscope came and went, and Twitter‚Äôs play for a share of the TV market hasn‚Äôt really panned out. But https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
As a public company, Twitter‚Äôs lack of user growth ‚Äî the company seems to have plateaued at around 330 million users ‚Äî has narrowed its ambitions https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Keeping Twitter at the forefront of news and culture means, as a platform, it hardly ever undergoes any drastic changes. As a result, the company has left its trickiest problems unsolved https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
Twitter may be the most stagnant of the big social networks. The service, which has largely stopped adding users, is more of a static communication and information utility, and 2018 underscored that Twitter leadership wants to https://t.co/vXRReJibJx
