@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler If the Federal Government is not doing its part, we can all do something: use public transportation more often, use less energy, talk to your member of Congress, register to vote, and even plant a tree. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler In Congress, in addition to fighting and speaking out against the harmful Trump administration policies, I will work with my colleagues to find climate solutions that benefit all Americans. Our future depends on it. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler While the Trump administration moves backward in support of a dirty energy agenda, the rest of the world is moving forward. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Thankfully, California--along with subnational, community &amp; business leaders in the private sector--has taken the lead in stepping up to cut greenhouse gas emissions &amp; finding common-sense natural solutions to fight #climatechange.
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler From the seemingly endless series of climate and health rollbacks, it‚Äôs clear the Trump Administration has no intention of taking a leadership role in tackling one of the greatest challenges of our times. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler It‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable that 14 million U.S households struggle to pay for water that too often is unsafe to drink. We can and must do better to bring safe drinking water to every family in our country. #ActOnClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Unfortunately, the Trump Administration wants to cut grants that help protect against polluted water. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler In Congress, I‚Äôm working hard to promote investment in water infrastructure so that communities like Compton, which is located in my district, and those across the country have access to clean water, which I believe is a basic human need and right. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler It‚Äôs critical that we keep this issue in the forefront of our minds. It‚Äôs been more than four years since we found out about the crisis in Flint, Michigan, where thousands of families, were exposed to high levels of lead in their drinking water. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler That‚Äôs why I introduced H.R. 4246, the #NoDrillinginOurBackyardsAct, to ensure that oil and gas operations in the United States occurs at least 1.5K feet away from homes, businesses, school and other protected areas. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler So, we should be looking to protect homes and schools from oil and gas development, not linking school funding to additional drilling. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Children are particularly susceptible to the health impacts from oil and gas pollution, which has created a public health crisis leaving them suffering from asthma and respiratory problems; nosebleeds; and nausea. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Our families should be able to live and work in schools and neighborhoods that are safe from toxic air pollution emitted from oil and gas operations. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Oil &amp; gas drilling does not belong in our neighborhoods. In my district #CA44, there are oil wells next to parks and in backyards where kids play. Health impacts from oil &amp; gas operations such as asthma, cardiovascular, respiratory &amp; even cancer problems must be addressed.
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Coastal tourism in California is unparalleled, contributing $17.6 billion dollars to our economy annually. I‚Äôll continue to stand against drilling offshore of California, especially in #CA44. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Loosening this regulation increases the risk of devastating oil spills that threaten the environment, thriving fishing, tourism &amp; recreation. I will always fight to protect our pristine coastlines and the livelihoods of our communities.
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler The #DeepwaterHorizon spill was one of the worst environmental disasters in this country‚Äôs history. For instance, repealing the Well Control Rule is a terrible mistake, which is why I introduced the #SafeCOASTAct which preserves common sense safety regulations like this one. https://t.co/BYWfRfTis4
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler Three Superfund sites are in communities in my district in South Gate. Our communities and families deserve protection from toxic chemicals and other hazardous substances that threaten our children and families. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler The Trump administration says it wants to clean up dangerous, abandoned ‚ÄúSuperfund‚Äù hazardous waste sites, but they keep trying to cut EPA‚Äôs budget for science and environmental enforcement ‚Äì both of which are essential elements of a safe clean-up program. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler I‚Äôm particularly incensed about the administration‚Äôs repeated efforts to slash EPA‚Äôs environmental justice programs, which provide support to underserved communities to tackle local public health challenges. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler It‚Äôs truly appalling to see these attacks on the @EPA‚Äôs budget, and for that matter, other agencies that work to protect our communities from pollution, climate change and other environmental challenges. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA @EPAAWheeler We need strong protections that will help protect the health of our families and our communities. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA Instead of putting families, children and the most vulnerable in our communities first, this administration and @EPAAWheeler are demonstrating continued favoritism towards corporate polluters ‚Äì at the expense of the health and safety of the American people. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA The #CPP, #CleanerCars Standards, and Mercury and Methane Rules are common sense safeguards. By attacking these standards, this administration is putting people and communities of color ‚Äì who are disproportionately impacted by climate change and pollution, at increased risk.
@DefendOurFuture @EPA I‚Äôm very concerned. Millions of Americans have already spoken out ‚Äì most recently at a public hearing in Chicago against the #DirtyPowerScam ‚Äì against the Trump administration‚Äôs so-called plan to cut air pollution from coal-fired power plants. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA Oil and gas drilling are one of the leading causes of climate change, and our communities‚Äîones such as Wilmington, Carson, and Compton‚Äîall bear the brunt of these drilling operations first and worst. #CA44 #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA The City of Los Angeles‚Äîwhere the 44th congressional district that I represent is located‚Äîis home to the largest and most densely populated urban oil field in the nation. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA 55% of Latinos in the U.S. live in three states already experiencing serious negative effects of climate change: CA, TX and FL. #ActonClimate
@DefendOurFuture @EPA Latino children are 60% more at risk than their white counterparts of having asthma attacks, the impacts of which are only exacerbated by breathing in the high levels of air pollution that we see in many of our communities. #ProtectMadreTierra
@DefendOurFuture @EPA For Latinos in my district, caring for &amp; protecting our environment is an everyday concern because we know pollution &amp; #climatechange disproportionately affects Latino communities &amp; other communities of color. #ProtectMadreTierra

@SecretaryZinke In October, I sent a letter w/ 25 of my colleagues demanding the full details of @SecretaryZinke‚Äôs privately-chartered flights.

The #GOPTaxScam is an unprecedented attack on the middle class and our environment. It primarily benefits the top 1% and big corporations at the expense of our public lands and the 86 million American families who face higher taxes under this bill.
In addition to allowing drilling in the #ArcticRefuge, the #GOPTaxScam provides tax cuts to corporate polluters at the expense of public health and communities across the nation.
The only thing more unpopular than the #GOPTaxScam is drilling in the #ArcticRefuge. 70% of Americans want to #ProtectTheArctic, yet for some reason the GOP felt the need to include it in their tax bill. https://t.co/gWSKjlrpAE
Well said. #GOPTaxBillScam https://t.co/nv8RnN1eFi
Disappointed that this concession was made to have #DREAMers wait even longer. Everyday on average 122 Dreamers lose their status - Dreamers are our doctors, teachers, neighbors and family. The time is now. Let's not send these families into the holiday with no resolution. https://t.co/ogFRzhsPIV

The GOP just voted to raise taxes on 86M Americans. This will only make the rich richer and hurt the middle class. What a #GOPTaxScam. We should be making America stronger by easing student debt, fixing our infrastructure, making medical care more accessible to all. I voted no.
