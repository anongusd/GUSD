@RepDanCrenshaw You seem like a nice guy and I really enjoyed you on SNL.  However, it is the president that keeps talking about a medieval wall.  It's as good an invention as the wheel he keeps saying.  He also insists on $5.7B for a wall. Also Mexico was going to pay.

@LindseyGrahamSC And make Mexico pay for it!
@RepMarkMeadows There was $1.6B appropriated for barriers in the CR that passed the Senate 100-0. If the president is at $5.7 and Ds at $1.6, good faith negs would lead to around $3B. The president won't accept anything other than $5.7. Also Mexico was going to pay for it.
@RepMarkMeadows The original CR passed by the senate 100-0 includes $1.6B for border wall funding.  Also, Mexico was going to pay for it.
@RepAndyHarrisMD @Jim_Jordan @Acosta @POTUS There is money in the Ds offer for the border wall.  It is $1.6B.  The president insists on $5.7B.  Good faith negotiations would lead to a split difference of those numbers. But the president will not consider an offer less than $5.7B.  Also Mexico was going to pay for it.

Congrats Yankees...40 AL Pennants amazing!...looking forward to a 27th title with fingers crossed!
Why is the 7th inning stretch so loooong at Yankee Stadium, even after "God Bless America"?
You also have to tag the runner...which he never did #angels v #yankees
A.Rod was safe and Hunter was out...regardless of what McCarver thinks #angels v #yankees

#FISTED #yankees v #twins
Golden Sombrero for Senor Damon #yankees v #twins
I don't have the numbers but it sure seems like the Twins have done a lot of damage w/ 2 outh this series #yankees v #twins
According to pitchtrax...Wegner has been bad tonight #yankees v #twins
here's a spot for Damon...who has struggled so far this series #yankees v #twins
Swish might've saved a big inning there...and Cano's behind as well #yankees v #twins
Even though that didn't work out for the Yanks...it's a good sign that they hit 3 balls hard against Pavano...stay tuned #yankees v #twins
Pettitte is on! #yankees v #twins
If you throw 1st pitch strikes, you are going to be effective...even if your name is Carl Pavano #yankees v #twins
Whoa...tbs stat boys #yankees v #twins
Oh well :( #yankees v #twins
C'mon Nick HR! #yankees v #twins
Oops...that wasn't Swish-alicious #yankees v #twins
Kubel is a good hitter but his lefty splits are awful...good news for Pettitte and the Yankees #yankees v #twins
Pavano good so far...lbut it's the 2nd and 3rd times thru the lineup that will be important #yankees #yankees v #twins
