We're ready to get our government back to work. This week, the House will vote on individual appropriations, because things like food for hungry families, environmental regulations, parks, &amp; 800,000 salaries should not be held hostage to an unrelated fight about Trump's wall.

Trump's attacks on Dr. Ford last night were attacks meant to silence all women by somebody similarly accused of sexual assault. Here's what she does remember: Being shoved in a room, a hand on her mouth, not being able to breath, fearing rape or even death. And Brett Kavanaugh.
With incredible scientists like Frances Arnold - who just won this year's @NobelPrize in Chemistry! - @Caltech is a pride of our district, growing our minds &amp; economy and changing our world for the better. Congratulations Frances &amp; @Caltech! https://t.co/WvO8JvjYTI
8 different times, Democrats on @WaysMeansCmte have called to see Trump's tax returns. Each time, Republicans have blocked us. Now we know why: Trump had to defraud the American people to make his millions. We need to know the truth. Release the returns. https://t.co/mqKDK5oK0D
What a disgusting and bigoted proposal. Instead of addressing an actual security threat, Stephen Miller wants to indiscriminately ban an entire ethnic group (not for the 1st time in American history), knowing it would hurt the economy &amp; American innovation https://t.co/2vhmhsFpCM
Key words: "May not." The point is, there needs to be an investigation. But Trump is telling girls they shouldn't come forward at all b/c they won't be believed. That is why  2 out of 3 sexual assaults go unreported. That's what's scary to me. https://t.co/sviQp2Nbfs
This policy is hateful, cruel, petty, unnecessary, and puts people at risk. We wouldn't let another country split up our diplomats' families. Pompeo should come before Congress to justify this change to the country.  https://t.co/qt7r3A04xP #LGBTQ
Trump shows no compassion for children as he skirts protections meant to ensure their best interests. They're not criminals, they're not violent, and they can be safely released to families. Instead, Trump is CHOOSING to prolong trauma and stress on them. https://t.co/vji5reuSDI

Senator Graham: You would think differently if you spoke to women about this. 		The reactions to these accusations made by grown women are exactly why young girls don't come forward. 		When a victim DOES come forward, we should believe them. You're perpetuating their silence. https://t.co/Ak99vMtgGV
A third woman has come out to credibly accuse Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault. The Senate must cancel their vote. Any vote for Kavanuagh before a fair hearing and investigation of these claims would be a horrible injustice. And the Supreme Court is no place for injustice.

Despite our capacity to help, Trump is capping 2019 refugee admissions at 30,000 -- 15,000 fewer than last year, and 55,000 fewer than in 2016. This new refugee cap is heartless and cruel. We shouldn't be turning people away who need help the most. 	https://t.co/5eyY88gfGV

All jokes aside, who is making the decisions in Trump's White House? Do unelected staff have more power than the President? This is a real constitutional crisis that demands oversight from Congress.

Zinke still doesn't get it. The problem with saying "konichiwa" wasn't the time of day. It was that he singled out the one Congressmember with Japanese heritage. At that moment, he saw her ethnicity, not her position. https://t.co/TBJmvi1nI5

Ryan was outraged and heartbroken that yet another friend died a preventable death. Tyler was one of 18 friends Ryan has lost over the years. And so he came to me one day to share his story and seek a solution.
Sober living homes can be an essential part of recovery, but many lack training &amp; resources. Tyler's home didn't even have narcan on site, which can counteract an overdose. 		Ryan said that's like refusing to put lifeboats on an ocean liner.

President Trump wants to change the heart of our immigration system without any understanding. Like I told Chief of Staff John Kelly this week, Trump should get the facts before he makes policy. https://t.co/hbKOTuYehX
Then allow me. A) "Chain migration" is a slur meant to evoke the image of hordes.

The family-based immigration system has contributed greatly to America. The majority of naturalized citizens in the U.S. came through our family-based system. #ValueOurFamilies #NoFamilyBan
Progress requires sitting down &amp; listening to each other. I appreciate WH Chief of Staff Kelly coming to the Hill today to do just that. I told him that our focus should be on  DACA &amp; humane border security - like the bipartisan Hurd/Aguilar #USAact we intro'd yesterday. https://t.co/eQrNFhs8I9
TL;DR: Immigrants who come in under the family reunification system use fewer government resources, and tend to outperform economically.

Why Trump's actions on immigration are so grave: people are having their legal status changed b/c of prejudice. 		Haitians here legally will suddenly become criminals b/c Trump does not like where they came from. 		Muslims not welcome b/c of where they come from. 		Who's next?
Trump's hollow words about Rev. Martin Luther King are betrayed by his actions. King taught the equality in all humanity. Trump has banned Muslims &amp; trans troops; defended white supremacists; denigrated Haitians &amp; Africans; insulted all immigrants. What am I missing? https://t.co/OXYsa46UbQ

So, when GOP talks about jobs, remember they are creating an incentive to move today's jobs overseas while making it almost impossible for all but the wealthiest to get on a path to the jobs of tomorrow.		Fewer jobs. Less innovation. Less opportunity. That's the #GOPTaxScam 		##
A territorial tax system also draws investment away from the U.S. If you're a CEO, why invest here, when you can do it overseas and avoid major taxes? 	   	8/
It's called the territorial tax system. It says that if your headquarters are in the U.S., we won't tax you on profits your firm makes overseas.	   	In other words, it will create jobs here for CEOs, but not for workers. Those will stay overseas, with limited tax.		7/
Now I know what you're thinking - what about today's workers already in the workforce and not looking to go back to school?		This plan is bad for them too. Instead of bringing back jobs that moved overseas, it creates an incentive to leave them overseas. How? That's next.  		6/
That's not just bad for the future careers in STEM that everybody from across the spectrum agree we need. It's bad for entrepreneurs too.

2nd, it creates entirely new taxes on graduate students by taxing them on money that defrays the cost of their education. This is money they never see. It's not income, but it's taxed like it. So how do students pay it? They don't. It will result in fewer graduate degrees. 		4/

We cannot allow for another era where the status quo elites use their power to silence those with none. Let this be the start of a change, where victims are heard, believed, and helped. And where harassment, not the victim, is shunned. 5/5

13) Downplayed need for action on gun violence after worst mass shooting in American history.
12) Hurt American leadership &amp; national security by trying to end the Iran Deal
11) Insulted Puerto Ricans without power or water, then threatened to abandon them
10) Threatened the free press
9) Decided to stop paying ACA subsidies, which will raise costs for working families
8) Issued executive order to allow more association plans, which will raise healthcare costs for elderly &amp; sick
7) Rolled back protections for LGBT workers, making it legal to fire trans workers just for being trans.
6) Attacked women's health by giving their bosses a veto over their ability to access contraception - which IS healthcare
5) Encouraged Americans to turn on each other w/ recriminations of being unpatriotic by coopting NFL players protesting racial injustice
4)  Let funding for Community Health Centers expire
3) Let CHIP – the program that provides health insurance to low-income children – expire
2) Supported an unconstitutional and unscientific ban on abortion after 20-weeks
1) Sabotaged a deal to let Dreamers stay here by including xenophobic, anti-immigrant demands

So it isn't urgent, isn't temporary, &amp; isn't constitutional. That's why I expect to see the #MuslimBan struck down by our courts once again
But as President - not candidate-Trump tried to create an exemption for Christians, showing again he wanted the ban to apply just to Muslims
3rd, Trump claims that his ban is not inspired by his campaign promise to ban all Muslims.
Well, if the ban was intended to be temporary, why have we not seen stricter screening rules in the past five 5 months
2nd, he said it was only temporary to give us time to create stricter screening rules.
That's because it was never about security, it was about perpetuating fear of Muslims and refugees
1st he claimed it had to be rushed b/c "bad dudes" were trying to "rush" into the country. But our existing security has worked in that time

Whether you're a woman on strike, working your job, working at home, or some combo of the 3 (likely), I wish you a happy #womensday2017
I agree with @RepRichardNeal. The Republican solution to health care will create chaos in the insurance markets and it will harm seniors.

All of this is to say - #DoYourJob
But I guess that's what Republicans want.
All while our constituents come to expect less and less of us.
Immigrant families will continue to live in fear. Women will feel forced to turn to self-induced abortion. Climate change will go unchecked
Leaving this seat vacant hinders our ability to move forward.
The Supreme Court has a number of important cases before them on issues like abortion, immigration, the environment and more.
But this is about more than partisanship and who is right or wrong. It's about having a well-functioning government at all levels
Desperate for a better reason than politics, GOP points to Biden 24 yrs ago. But that comparison's been debunked. https://t.co/e5Dv3pxrI2
We should be building our political institutions, not shutting it all down and hoping for something to change.
In a democracy, we have an obligation to engage, listen, cooperate, and compromise. Saying "NO" to even a hearing is the opposite of that.
Meanwhile, in House Judiciary Committee, GOP's forcing a hearing on actions @POTUS did take, calling them executive overreach
When @POTUS released his budget plan - as required by law - GOP refused to even hold a hearing on it! https://t.co/eKmkmhQOKg
#SCOTUS nominee isn't the only example. There's a pattern of Republicans pretending @POTUS doesn't exist.
Clearly, that's now extending to denying President Obama his constitutional powers &amp; responsibilities.
https://t.co/P9jpfbogNk
That's b/c governing isn't their goal. As @SenateMajLdr said in 2010: "top political priority is to deny President Obama a 2nd term"
Republican obstruction is putting politics ahead of governing and the constitution.
Executive powers do not expire while a President is in office.
That applies for the full term, which lasts 4 years. Not 3 years, or whenever Republicans decide. The full 4 years.
Constitution is clear: President "shall appoint...Judges of the supreme Court".
This week, @POTUS is expected to announce his Supreme Court nominee. Republicans won't even consider it. Here's why that's a problem:

In every industry it’s the same story – women are paid less than men for the same work. #EqualPayNow #EqualPayDay http://t.co/4Zmkip1IVh
Women make on avg 78 cents for every dollar earned by men. That's a $10,876 annual gap between full-time working men &amp; men. #EqualPayNow
By 65, the average working woman will have lost $431,000 b/c of the #paygap. On #EqualPayDay, let's commit to a more fair country for ALL

The #ACA goes to the Supreme Court today in #KingvBurwell. Congress intended this law to cover ALL Americans. And it’s a huge success!

When women succeed, America succeeds! This #WomensHistoryMonth, we honor women past &amp; present who have done so much for our great nation.
W/ just 2 hours to go, the #DHSshutdown was averted. For now. This was a disappointing stunt. We must fund DHS through the rest of the year
It’s time for GOP to put the Senate's clean funding bill on the floor for a vote and give D#HS funding it needs.

Let's stop playing politics with #DHSshutdown. This is unacceptable &amp; completely avoidable. @HouseGOP we need a clean bill!
3 more weeks of $ for DHS does nothing to solve the problem. We need a bill that fully supports our top national security agency a full year
The Senate overwhelmingly passed a clean DHS bill. Every House Democrat supports a clean DHS bill. It's time to stop playing games.
Let's hold vote on clean, long-term bill to fund DHS, @SpeakerBoehner! Every House Dem has signed their support! #DontShutDownOurSecurity
Paychecks are not a luxury. Hundreds of TSA workers at LAX will have to work w/out pay if GOP lets DHS shutdown. #DontShutDownOurSecurity
