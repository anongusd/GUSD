As they fight to get more than 800,000 federal workers back to work &amp; stand strong against a senseless border wall being built, Democrats are being the kind of leaders America needs.  It‚Äôs time for Republicans to quit their cowering, find their backbones, and join them.
Americans sent a historic, progressive wave to Washington, because they wanted leaders in Congress committed to fighting for #InclusivePopulism, standing up to @realDonaldTrump , &amp; stopping the monument to bigotry, hate, &amp; division he‚Äôs obsessed with constructing on our border.
The bizarre rant @realDonaldTrump delivered tonight was not only a dangerous escalation of #WhiteSupremacist fear-mongering, it was a crystal clear indication that there is no limit to the lies he'll tell or the families he's willing to hold hostage to pursue his racist agenda.

In 2018, candidates of color, at every level of office, are facing a level of racialized partisan vitriol that #WhiteSupremacy in our culture and mainstream media is still leaving far too many unable to see and act on.		That. Must. Change. Now.
#WhiteSupremacy is also what allows @GOP to get away with pretending that they're anything but a-ok with the absolutely desperate, race-baiting ads run by @ACampaNajjar opponent  https://t.co/0Quau6cFqG
Federally, #WhiteSupremacy underlies the baseless smears of #AntiSemitism against @RashidaTlaib and @IlhanMN while the right allows REAL #AntiSemtism to organize behind them -- as we saw this weekend.
And #WhiteSupremacy is also behind the credence given to the outright lies that @RonDeSantisFL has been permitted to traffic in about #TLH's declining crime rates. https://t.co/bWceVLsKzP
#WhiteSupremacy is found in the multiple vilely racist #robocalls that @AndrewGillum that @RonDeSantisFL #WhiteNationalist supporters of run and it underlies DeSantis' own #MonkeyThisUp comment https://t.co/f4uonwZO3m
But #WhiteSupremacy isn't just explicit racist threats, it's also the silence those actions got (despite being shared by @TheWayWithAnoa) -- especially when a vulgar #antiracist sign was covered by GA media like a #HateCrime  https://t.co/ndarZd9pNS h/t @DrJasonJohnson

.@staceyabrams, running for Governor of Georgia, has not only faced racially tinged attacks on her personal struggle with debt she incurred while caring for her family. Something @michelleinbklyn masterfully talked about back in August: https://t.co/xePeTQ9NL0
Here are just a small collection of what we mean:
Let's be clear: #POC running for elected office have ALWAYS faced hurdles to victory defined by the strength of #StructuralRacism and our country's long-standing culture of #WhiteSupremacy.  But 2018 has taken it to a new level.
We celebrate the truly #HISTORIC number of #women and #POC running for office in 2018, but we also refuse to ignore the volume &amp; range of explicit and implicit #racist attacks almost every single candidate of color has faced in this election. That's also #WhiteSupremacy in action
THREAD: After the #TreeOfLifeSynagogue #shooting, the #KrogerShooting before that, and the +14 bombs sent by the #MAGABomber, it's crucial that we call #RightWingTerrorism out for what it is, but we also clearly need to talk about #WhiteSupremacy in the 2018 election.

Another reason why we shouldn't be surprised by today's acts of #RightWingTerrorism https://t.co/xdwaP18yQ0
RT @AndrewGillum: We‚Äôre tired of the brand of politics we‚Äôve been seeing for over two decades. We want a governor who will fight for all Fl‚Ä¶
So, it's time to stop asking @realDonaldTrump and other GOP leaders if they'll denounce terrorist attacks like the one today.  Instead, we need to ask them explicitly: What are you doing to stop your own complicity in #RightWingTerrorism? They need to own this. /end
Our country's problem isn't blanket "political violence," -- it's not an evil that both sides of the ideological spectrum equally foment. The danger we face is #RightWingTerrorism &amp; the politicians who put American lives at risk enabling it for their perceived political benefit.
It's wholly unacceptable for Republican elected officials who have eagerly enabled #RightWingTerrorism, like Trump and Pence, to issue bland denunciations of generalized "political violence." They have to acknowledge their role in what's happening.
We're even seeing Republican officials themselves engaging in acts of #RightWingTerrorism.  Here's a story about the @MiamiGOP‚Äôs Chairman joining in a #ProudBoys attack on a Democratic office.   https://t.co/MYefGj32C7
#RightWingTerrorism is actively fomented by unhinged conspiracy theories like #Pizzagate and #QAnon that are then actively trafficked by Republican officials. Just in August, Trump met in the Oval Office with a prominent #QAnon conspiracy theorist.  https://t.co/nY139X4mPm
While it's reached a new fever pitch under Trump, the @GOP's embrace of #RightWingTerrorism isn't new.  This piece from 2016 reminds us that Republican leaders have been calling for "Second Amendment remedies" or political violence for YEARS.  https://t.co/UBe6RQ92WS
Last March, Trump confidant Roger Stone didn't just embrace #RightWingTerrorism, he used it for protection.  Like Brown Shirts straight out of the 1930s, Stone asked the #ProudBoys for protection at a #neofascist rally.  https://t.co/EDBlhFZFel
Groups like the #ProudBoys and #PatriotPrayer are running around the country engaging in regular acts of #RightWingTerrorism and are being actively adopted by @GOP. https://t.co/qlhxUcaz9a
But it's not just that -- just in the last few days Trump openly alighted himself with white nationalists who have regularly committed acts of #RightWingTerrorism all across the country. https://t.co/H9ILyk0TXp
Today, pipebombs have been sent to individuals and entities that @realDonaldTrump has spent months decrying, often in explicit terms, as "enemies of the people."  That's #RightWingTerrorism actively being enabled by Republicans.

@Dakota_Schmidt Some folks have organized in smaller quasi-political formations to tackle specific issues in a specfic area of a county or other local jurisdiction like around a particular school or housing is a common issue to organize around as well. 2/2 #DFAChat

Q3: How can we build capacity to support and lift up electoral organizing and progressive candidates at the local level? #DFAChat

Q2: What is a major challenge facing your community, and what is one potential strategy to overcome that challenge? #DFAChat
@MichaelSalamone @TheWayWithAnoa Yeah. For sure. Thinking about the measured impact of our work and how, or when, it is felt at home.
While you're thinking about Q1, remember to respond to the questions with A and then the corresponding number. So a response to Q1 would start with A1!
Q1: We always hear the phrase ‚Äúall politics is local.‚Äù What does it mean for you and political engagement in your city/county? #DFAChat
Supporting, training, and endorsing candidates at the municipal and county level has an immediate impact on the communities we seek to serve. All politics is local. And we need more people engaged in strategic electoral work at this level. Now for some questions! #DFAChat

"... all immigrants and families who are being needlessly and possibly illegally detained are freed; and the people who organized, perpetrated, and cheered on this immoral assault on human decency are brought to justice in the courts and at the ballot box."
Along with millions of Americans across the country, we refuse to be silent until every single infant, toddler, and child that Donald Trump's administration has ripped from their parents' arms is returned to them;...
"No executive order Donald Trump signs can even begin to erase the psychological torment he's subjected these children and families to or the profound moral shame the actions of the Trump administration have brought to the country."
"Let's be clear: Donald Trump and the administration he runs have spent nearly six weeks systematically ripping infants, toddlers, and children from the arms of asylum-seeking mothers and fathers fleeing violence and placing them in concentration camps and foster homes."
DFA's Jim Dean: "Donald Trump's disgusting attempt to appear heroic by signing an exec order to temporarily end a policy of systematic child abuse that he pushed for, enabled, and excused is one of the vilest, politically-craven moves we've seen in the history of US politics. https://t.co/9id5XZUt6h
Apparently, it takes the Trump admin WEEKS to decide that they maybe might stop their inhumane policy of ripping children from the arms of their mother at the border.  		And they're still not sure the lying bigot driving the clown car will sign on to it.		This is America. https://t.co/Qb3RiOv78u
