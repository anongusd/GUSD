@MomsThoughts @WalshFreedom Exactly! An alternative to a gas tax is many toll-roads (used by most of the developed world). Yet, toll-roads fall short compared to the tax because the driver of a polluting gas guzzler pays the same as the hybrid driver. The gas tax penalizes for externalities like pollution.

@cover81 @whyjinks @WalshFreedom @cover81 I guess one could argue that all social beliefs can be expressed as economic beliefs. But my point is: How can someone accurately locate themselves in the ideological spectrum when they can‚Äôt identify the source of their beliefs? Forget understanding opposing views.
@cover81 @whyjinks @WalshFreedom @cover81 Please expand on this, I‚Äôd love to read up on this topic. I do agree with you‚Äîat least to some extent. However, I don‚Äôt believe that the average American is even aware of their own ideological biases, let alone able to differentiate between economic and social beliefs.
Who defines ‚Äòcenter‚Äô and how is it determined? Even if we all agreed on what defines ‚Äòcenter,‚Äô how would this change/update as society changes? i.e. - How does one know their perception of ‚Äòcenter‚Äô is aligned w/ current society, rather than that of 20 years ago? https://t.co/XIcweEDdEz

@sam_a_bell @jasonfrerichs Slow and steady interest rate increases is ideal, but when Govt. throws fuel on an already hot fire, through ill-timed fiscal stimulus and tax cuts, the likelihood that the FED will need to result to more aggressive interest rate increases becomes much more likely.
@sam_a_bell @jasonfrerichs You really cannot separate the two (at-least not for very long): With growth comes inflation and the FED will need to increase interest rates to prevent another 1970's- early 80's inflationary spiral.
@sam_a_bell @jasonfrerichs Let's not forget that interest rates are the most effective FED tool to keep price inflation under control. As the article says, interest rates in the early 1980's were cripplingly high. This was due to the fact that inflation was out of control and growth was slow (stagflation).
