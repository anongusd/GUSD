Grassley: All witnesses named by Dr. Ford at the party said it didn't take place.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh has arrived on Capitol Hill, holding the hand of his wife as he walked through the Senate halls
One question that has not been asked today: Who owned the house where the party Ford says took place? Who were the adults who owned that house? Whose house was it? Do they people who owned the house know there was an alleged sexual assault there?
Senator Graham: I found Dr. Ford‚Äôs testimony did not corroborate anything. I don‚Äôt doubt that something happened to her. Kavanaugh said he didn‚Äôt do it.
Dr. Ford accuses her longtime friend and fellow woman Leland Keyser of "having health issues" and therefore can't remember being at the party. Keyser, along with all the other witnesses named by Ford, have no recollection the party occurred.

It appears her attorneys may have never told Dr. Ford about the offer from Grassley https://t.co/otkLpN4ZPH
Dr. Ford now saying it wasn't clear to her that Grassley was willing to send staff to California so she didn't have to fly. When asked to explain, her attorneys (Democrat operatives) cut in a cited privilege. 		Grassley made it extremely clear what the offer was.
"Beach friends"
Dr. Ford is now saying she talked to "people on the beach" about the assault and Kavanaugh this summer. She says they encouraged her to go to the media. Previously, she said she only told the story to her therapist and her husband. Another major discrepancy.
Grassley reminds Dr. Ford: We offered to come to you any place, any time.
Ford says it was unrealistic for the Committee to come to her so she didn't have to fly, but Grassley offered repeatedly to send staff to interview her so she wouldn't have to fly.
Ford says she might not make it to Australia because of her fear of flying, but has been French Polynesia and other far away places. Says it's easier to go when she's "going for vacation."
Who's lying? Ford says she doesn't know if she showed the therapist notes to the Washington Post. Washington Post says they reviewed them.

Dr. Ford can't recall basic facts about conversations she's had in the past three months.

Also said this is ‚Äúmy best estimate of how this may have happened‚Äù https://t.co/btZ9BHQefS
Is Rachel Mitchell really only going to get 55 minutes of questioning? That's absurd.
Ford says she saw Mark Judge at a store. She says she said hello, then says he was very uncomfortable saying hi back. Previously she said Judge completely avoided her.
Ford says she couldn't hear a conversation as Kavanaugh and Judge allegedly left the room, but then says she waited to hear until they were downstairs to leave. Prosecutor asks he "How did she know there was a conversation?" Ford says she "assumed"
Ford again says Leland Keyser was at the party. Keyser has denied being at the party. Ford also says she hasn't talked to anyone who was at the party since the allegation. Then corrects to say she spoke to Leland.
Really wish Rachel Mitchell could proceed with her questioning without interruption every five minutes. She should do all of her questioning and then move onto the Senators. The interruption is very distracting.

White House records show Dr. Ronny Jackson ‚Äúwas in three incidents in government vehicles in the last five years, but none involved the use of alcohol and he was not found at fault.‚Äù https://t.co/mKZi44TSyA
Also, anonymous allegations against Dr. Jackson got full blown coverage. This statement from the Secret Service got practically zero. Disgusting. https://t.co/lg6RCNziHj
In addition, the Secret Service offered two paragraphs on "outstanding professional" Dr. Ronny Jackson and explained how he is crucial to their mission. https://t.co/Knlfk4aVwA
CNN reported this week that Dr. Ronny Jackson got drunk overseas, loudly banged on colleague's door &amp; was stopped by Secret Service. Today Secret Service says it "has no such record of any incident; specifically, any incident involving Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson." Unbelievable.

There it is. Sheriff Israel says he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know‚Äù when he found out Deputy Peterson didn‚Äôt go into the school. Then says it was ‚Äúspoken‚Äù about on Wednesday before the CNN town hall, where he blamed the NRA for the shooting knowing his deputy failed.
Naturally, Broward County Sheriff Israel has no answers about the additional deputies police say didn‚Äôt enter the school. He also isn‚Äôt participating in the details of the investigation into what happened.
Another example of refusing to place responsibility where it belongs while blaming the NRA, which deserves none of it https://t.co/PtnafkHLNd

All along, it was the Clinton campaign, some in Obama's DOJ and Fusion GPS that were colluding with a foreign entity to influence the election. The exact thing they've accused the Trump campaign of doing, they are guilty of.
So, the Clinton campaign/DNC worked with a foreign spy to develop a salacious and phony dossier on Donald Trump, gave the dossier to the FBI and they used it to open an investigation and obtain a FISA warrant to spy on Trump campaign members. Unreal.

So, today's medical assessment from the press is: Trump likely has Alzheimer's and Dr. Jackson just didn't catch it and he's also basically obese. What was actually said by the Dr.: "The president is in excellent health."
The White House Press Corps is still running with the mental aspect of this
Get ready for the press to attack Rear Adm. Dr. Ronny Jackson and his credibility
Rear Adm. Dr. Ronny Jackson: No, Trump doesn't have early Alzheimer's
Rear Adm. Dr. Ronny Jackson: I've spent everyday with the President and have never suspected he needed a mental exam (i.e. but because of this insane media narrative, we did one and he's totally normal)
To shorten this doctor's diagnosis: Trump is very healthy
