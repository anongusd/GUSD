Real populism is never racist. Real populism is never anti-Semitic. Real populism doesn't divide people. As we remember what happened in Selma 54 years ago, we need to remember what real populism does: it lifts everyone up. https://t.co/OnpChFUSB3

UPDATE: Yesterday, the Summit Academy teachers ratified their first contract, ensuring a voice in their workplace, and establishing staffing guidelines. Their advocacy is inspiring – congratulations to these educators and @OFTadvocate on a big victory.
Too many families in America are forced to make tough decisions about child care as costs skyrocket and wages don’t keep up. We need to start thinking about child care as a public good in this country – and we can do that with our bill. #ChildCare4All	https://t.co/gExJAdXg5U
Happy birthday, Ohio! It’s been a great 216 years, and we’re just getting started. https://t.co/YaT4hOa442
Part of that means updating our laws to catch up with the reality that women are heading families and leading in their workplaces, and are often stretched thin trying to make ends meet – that includes paid sick leave, paid family leave, and #childcare4all.
But while we celebrate the trailblazing women who came before us and those who are forging new trails today, we must also recommit ourselves to the work still ahead to achieve full equality. We must not rest until there are no more barriers left to break.
Throughout this #WomensHistoryMonth, we celebrate the women in Ohio and across our nation who have shaped the course of our history, and worked to make our country a more perfect union.
Republican efforts to strip women of their health care rights are shameful. Today and every day, women should have the freedom to make personal, private health decisions, and those decisions should be between them and their doctors, not their legislators. #HowDareYou
With so much at stake – the health of Lake Erie, climate change, safe drinking water and clean air for our families – I cannot support the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as EPA Administrator.
Big oil and gas already have too much power in Washington and in the White House. Ohioans deserve an EPA Administrator willing to stand up for the interests of our state, not rubberstamp the agenda of corporate polluters and their lobbyists.
This week, we saw yet another attempt by Republican politicians to put themselves in the middle of the sacred doctor-patient relationship, and take away the freedom of women to make their own healthcare decisions.	 	We defeated that bill, but we've got to keep fighting. https://t.co/LqcxoTdkn5

Voted no on William Barr’s nomination to be Attorney General yesterday. He made no commitment to fight voter suppression or racial gerrymandering, and anything less than a total commitment is unacceptable for an Attorney General.

Instead of building a wall, we should be passing a bill to provide back pay for the contract workers the President hurt with his shutdown. -SB
The President continues to hurt the people who make this country work by wasting time &amp; standing in the way of important work like protecting pensions for millions of workers &amp; retirees, bringing down the cost of prescription drugs, or rewriting the tax code to put people first.
The President’s decision to take funding away from our military to support his vanity project is reckless and irresponsible.
In the year since the horrific Parkland shooting, we’ve lost nearly 1,200 more kids to gun violence in this country. 	 	Enough is enough. We have to act now. https://t.co/mcJKX6kmlz
Any effort to take funding away from our military to support the President’s vanity project is reckless and irresponsible. The President needs to drop the threats, sign this bill and stop standing in the way of important work we should be doing for the people we serve. -SB
The students of Parkland, and the millions of Americans inspired by them, give me hope for the future. I hope all of my Senate colleagues listen to them. -SB
They have a simple demand: that the people who represent them protect them from gun violence. I stand with them: we cannot say we are doing what it takes to keep our country safe until we're finally willing to pass commonsense laws to protect all Americans from gun violence.
But one of our country’s greatest strengths is that out of even the greatest tragedies, Americans channel their outrage and grief into action. The young people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School launched an incredible movement for change in this country.
Today marks one year since 17 Americans were brutally murdered at school in Parkland, Florida. 17 others were wounded that day. And hundreds of students and teachers joined the ranks of survivors of mass shootings. Their lives will never be the same. https://t.co/U5YBXETioe
Mr. President – these federal contract workers missed weeks of wages because of your pointless shutdown.

For too many workers, hard work isn’t paying off. We need to throw out the President’s tax law &amp; rewrite the tax code to put people first. I’m introducing a plan that will create a tax code that puts money in the pockets of working people, raises wages &amp; keeps jobs in the US. -SB https://t.co/1nPy13eULs
We need to throw out President Trump’s tax law, and completely rewrite our tax code to put people first. This plan is an important part of how we do that.
Our plan would also let workers claim a one-time advance on their EITC refund. Right now, 4 in 10 Americans say they couldn’t afford an emergency expense of $400 without borrowing money. Early refund EITC would give many Americans an alternative to expensive, predatory lenders.
A study by AARP &amp; the National Alliance for Caregiving found that almost 40 million Americans are providing unpaid care. A study by GAO found almost a third of all college students experience food insecurity. These students &amp; caregivers need the stability our plan would provide.
This plan would double the EITC for working families and make millions more people eligible. For the first time, students and caregivers would be able to claim the EITC. Getting an education is work. Taking care of a loved one is work. Our society needs to recognize that.
The cost of everything from healthcare, to rent, to college tuition is up – but for most workers, wages are flat. They need more money in their pockets to keep up. That’s why @RepRoKhanna, @RepBonnie, and I are introducing a Cost of Living Refund. https://t.co/5t0dE59x3h

Our hearts are breaking for @RepDebDingell and all those who knew and loved @JohnDingell. He was an institution. And because my own words can’t do justice to John’s life and legacy, I’d like to share some of his instead:
To put it quite simply: Prescription drug prices are too high. It’s past time Washington did something about it.
Teamed up with @gillibrandny to reintroduce the Stop Price Gouging Act, which would protect Americans from prescription drug price spikes by requiring drug companies to report and justify their decisions to increase prices, and prevent Big Pharma from price gouging.
The next step in lowering prices for all Americans is going after the corporations that engage in price gouging – increasing prices exponentially, without cause. That’s where the Stop Price Gouging Act comes in. https://t.co/Y9kMQO5R9b
Under our plan, if drug companies refuse to negotiate in good faith, the Secretary could facilitate the creation of a generic drug, bringing down prices for everyone. https://t.co/liShJ4KaAB
The first is a plan experts say “terrifies Big Pharma.” The Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act would allow the Secretary of HHS to negotiate directly with drug companies to lower prices.
The purpose of medicine is to help people, not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives. That’s why I’m proud to introduce two bills today to lower prescription drug prices for American families – here’s how they’ll work:

For too many workers, hard work just doesn’t pay off. If we truly value a hard day’s work, we must fix that.

Special interests already have armies of lobbyists and lawyers on their side – they don’t need judges like Chad Readler and Eric Murphy in their pockets.

The answers: they're taking home about $50 less a week to fill their car up w gas, pay for daycare or buy groceries. https://t.co/uu7KnwGxmN

Instead of celebrating the groundbreaking of their new Mexican plant, GM should use the ‘100% expensing’ tax break to retool its Lordstown plant – rated GM’s best North American plant – and save the jobs of 4,500 workers. 		Now that’d be worth celebrating. https://t.co/Dr4tAz2NwC

Wall Street loves layoffs. Corporations lay off workers to show they’re serious about cutting expenses &amp; their stock prices often rise as a result – which leads to an increase in their CEO’s pay. GM's shameful decision this week is just the latest example. https://t.co/FWg8NN2Otu

Instead of giving companies tax breaks to shut down American factories &amp; lay off workers, why haven’t you supported the American Cars American Jobs Act? -SB https://t.co/2vMXfr9wjq https://t.co/qo8WpsReqo
We can fix this by passing the American Cars, American Jobs Act – which would get rid of that tax cut, and use the money to give customers a discount when they buy cars that are made in America. https://t.co/Sllq4cGikM
When Washington passed the GOP tax bill last year, it handed a 50 percent off coupon to companies that send jobs overseas, like GM. 		That makes no sense – American autoworkers are the best in the world, and we should fight to keep those jobs here.

It doesn’t have to be this way. The American Cars, American Jobs Act would get rid of tax cuts for moving jobs overseas and increase demand for American-made cars. https://t.co/Sllq4cGikM
So no one in Washington should be surprised that the very same day GM laid off workers in Lordstown, Ohio, it announced plans to make the Blazer in Mexico. And now, after taking its tax windfall, GM is eliminating 14,000 American jobs.
As the Senate debated the GOP tax bill one year ago, senators listened as an expert witness confirmed that the bill would encourage corporations to close up factories here and move overseas. https://t.co/JUdqbv20MD

These bills are important, bipartisan steps to crack down on big pharma hiding information from customers. https://t.co/7m5WvIIVW8
Too many Ohioans struggle to afford the prescription drugs they need – that’s why this month the president signed into law two of our bills to crack down on gag clauses that force customers to pay more for their medications. Great to talk about them in Toledo today. https://t.co/ltDh0ISN3X
One of our next steps must be expanding our overtime pay system. It’s past time workers’ paychecks reflect the hours they work. People who work 50 or 60 hours a week should be paid the wages they’ve earned. Period. https://t.co/QdGBF631lW
80 years ago today, the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted – which paved the way for a 40-hour work week, and established a minimum wage. We’ve come a long way since then, but we have more to do to make sure that there is dignity of work for all workers.
Sherrod also applauded the enactment of @senrobportman’s STOP Act, which will work together with his INTERDICT Act to stop deadly drugs from reaching Ohio communities. https://t.co/sfLlAX77Ut
Sherrod and @senrobportman worked together to ensure the package included their bipartisan proposal to lift the Institutions for Mental Disease (IMD) exclusion, which will expand Americans’ access to treatment for all substance use disorders, including opioid addiction.

The Working Families Tax Relief Act has 45 cosponsors in the Senate. If the President wants to cut taxes for the middle class, the Working Families Tax Relief Act can get done right away. -SB
The Working Families Tax Relief Act would put more money in the pockets of working families by boosting the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). It would reward hard work and make sure no one is taxed into poverty.

Thank you to Ohio Task Force One, and to all Ohioans helping with Hurricane Michael relief efforts. You represent the very best of our state. https://t.co/u6rlX38UXg
More than 5 million Ohioans under age 65 have a pre-existing condition – which is nearly half the state. Under the Administration’s expansion of so-called “junk plans,” these Ohioans could be denied coverage, or have their costs hiked up. Voting today to protect their coverage. https://t.co/yoZ3Jjojjc
Both Chad Readler and Eric Murphy have long histories threatening the rights of Ohioans. Special interests already have armies of lobbyists and lawyers on their side – they don’t need judges in their pockets.
As the State Solicitor of Ohio in the Office of the Ohio Attorney General, Eric Murphy argued against marriage equality in the landmark Obergefell case. He also defended kicking Ohio voters off the rolls and other measure designed to restrict the right to vote in Ohio. https://t.co/FToJiIudW6
More than 52 million Americans with pre-existing conditions are at risk because of the lawsuit Chad Readler supported. https://t.co/98UDwTxH9K https://t.co/XRpn4dPNV7
In June, Chad Readler supported efforts to allow insurance companies to once again deny coverage or charge sky-high rates for people with pre-existing conditions. More than 5 million Ohioans under age 65 have a pre-existing condition—nearly half the state. https://t.co/iebfCzpnmg
Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee is considering the nominations of Chad Readler and Eric Murphy to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. Here’s what you need to know →
We must demand answers and accountability about what happened to Jamal Khashoggi. Today and every day, we must always fight back against any threat to a free press.
Ahead of Murphy’s hearing tomorrow, Ohioan Jim Obergefell announced his opposition: “Ohioans and all Americans deserve judges who will protect their rights to be treated equally under the law.” https://t.co/8PtSIeYhZs
Eric Murphy argued against marriage equality – taking the case all the way to Supreme Court. 		Now, he's nominated to the 6th Circuit.

On Saturday, hundreds of women came to our annual Ohio Women’s Leadership Summit for a day of inspiration, sisterhood, and – as one attendee said – “rejuvenation.” Take a look at the day, in these women’s words →
Judge Kavanaugh’s record is clear. He has consistently sided with the most powerful special interests, not American workers. The stakes for Ohioans are too high to give this justice a lifetime appointment to our highest court. -SB https://t.co/JKKIpdqO4x
The #OhioWomensSummit begins with a video from Sherrod: “The theme of the conference—‘together we rise’—is a rallying cry for all of us. It’s always been ordinary Americans organizing in schools &amp; church basements &amp; union halls who’ve sparked movements that changed this country.” https://t.co/Pv9zU3tE0g
Today’s #OhioWomensSummit in Cincinnati will shine a light on the work women are doing across Ohio to uplift their communities – and all day, we’ll be sharing these women’s stories on our Instagram. Follow along → https://t.co/CnfzQk3G3E https://t.co/6xbQhgXaEx
This week, @SenateBanking Democrats called on the committee to hold a hearing with Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan and Chair of the Board of Directors Elizabeth Duke, in the wake of the bank’s rampant consumer abuses revealed over the last year. https://t.co/b661Et1Qiu
On #MFGDay18, 500 students came through the 5th Annual Ottawa County Career Showcase to learn about some of the high-tech and exciting opportunities available to them in the manufacturing sector – and they saw firsthand that the so-called Rust Belt certainly isn’t rusty. https://t.co/VAwSeP5zHG
The person with Eric Blankenstein’s job should be fighting &amp; preventing the very real financial discrimination that we know happens all too often.		But instead we now know the person tasked with that job has written most hate crimes are “hoaxes.” He needs to be fired immediately. https://t.co/LPn3PS5Nml

A little Mansfield trivia: the Spanish Immersion School used to be Brinkerhoff Elementary, which I attended. It’s wonderful to watch my beloved neighborhood elementary school reach these new heights. Congrats to both schools, which make OH very proud. -SB https://t.co/aj417PkQAK
“Junk plans” are exactly that – junk. These healthcare plans allow insurance companies to hike up costs if you have pre-existing conditions, or deny you altogether. Joining with @SenatorBaldwin to force a vote to roll back these junk plans, and protect your coverage. https://t.co/fI1VS44l6h
As the Senate prepares to pass the CRIB Act at 3:15pm today, hear directly from Jill Kingston – the executive director of Brigid’s Path in Dayton – about the difference it will make in her work to help newborns suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome. https://t.co/voBaJNJz2T

Dr. Ford’s testimony was a powerful moment for our country, and I am grateful to her and all the brave women who were inspired by her to speak out and share their own stories. It’s because of their courage that the FBI investigation is going forward. -SB
While I’ve already announced my opposition to Kavanaugh because he has sided with corporations over workers and Wall Street over consumers, I strongly support a thorough investigation by the FBI.
Thank you to all law enforcement and VA employees for keeping our veterans safe in Whitehall. https://t.co/Jgjz8dM7I5
While I had already decided not to support Judge Kavanaugh based on his history of siding with corporations and Wall Street over workers, Dr. Ford’s testimony today was a powerful moment for our country. -SB
Dr. Ford’s courage is inspiring and I am very grateful to her for coming forward to tell her story, even in the face of deep personal cost. She was moving, heartfelt and honest.

It’s past time to fight for American autoworkers – and we can start by passing the American Cars, American Jobs Act. @UAW’s Legislative Director said it best today: “Absolutely, it would help keep auto jobs in the U.S.” https://t.co/6agQBl2ZrL
Great to start the day with Ohio @MineWorkers. They’re here to fight for the pensions that they earned after a lifetime of hard work – and we’re not going to give up until Congress keeps its promise. #SavePensions https://t.co/AXfwwnp6CR

Proud to stand with @senrobportman in the fight to protect Lake Erie. Today, our language protecting Lake Erie was signed into law. It'll help us keep the Lake clean, keep the channel open for business, and ensure the Lake remains a viable resource for generations to come.
All Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange deserve health care and benefits. The @DeptVetAffairs needs to expand these benefits to all Vietnam veterans, whether they served on the ground or at sea. https://t.co/O0tYF3VWeT

After announcing a $24.5 billion stock buyback, @WellsFargo plans to cut more than 26,000 jobs over the next 3 years. So much for the jobs in the ”Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” https://t.co/W1RHhJlAbx
Good to be in Lakewood to celebrate the passage of our bill that’ll help customers save money at the pharmacy counter. The purpose of prescription drugs is to allow Ohioans to live longer, healthier lives – not to line the pockets of Big Pharma executives. https://t.co/YOB0mjZ8D8

A very happy birthday to the @usairforce, which turns 71 today – and thanks to the Ohio men and women at our state’s Air Force installations, for their service to our country.
Too many Ohioans still struggle to afford the medicine they need, and too often, the culprit is price gouging by Big Pharma. This bipartisan bill will help save Ohioans money, improve health care, and increase transparency in the pharmaceutical industry. https://t.co/4QMKFruxVp

Truly learning the lessons of the economic crisis means standing on the side of American workers and families – whether it’s on affordable housing or consumer protections, pensions or protecting taxpayers from bailouts.
After the crisis, we passed Wall St reform and put in place strong rules so Main St would never again be forced to bail out Wall St. 		But under this admin &amp; this Congress, big banks and their lobbyists are scoring touchdown after touchdown at the expense of hardworking families.
Ten years ago today, the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, paving the way for the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.
The Supreme Court’s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges finally put our nation on the right side of history, as marriage equality became law of the land. 		Justice Kavanaugh’s refusal to recognize that last week is alarming.
These brave Ohioans represent the best of our state. Grateful to have them helping on the ground in North Carolina. https://t.co/0CqI1AX51p
This would also rob workers of their right to bargain with their employer, by absolving corporations of their responsibility to participate in collective bargaining – and that’s unacceptable. Every corporation with control over workers’ jobs must be at the bargaining table.
Another anti-worker proposal from this anti-worker administration. 		This rule would shield corporations from accountability for how their subcontractors and franchise workers are treated. Corporations should be held responsible for ANY labor violation in their ranks. Period. https://t.co/p8A8Evk9Dn
During National Truck Driver Appreciation Week, let’s honor the truck drivers and all the workers who power this country by protecting the pensions they earned, and by fighting for the safe working conditions and fair pay and benefits they deserve. #NTDAW

But make no mistake: we’re still calling on GM to do the right thing, and invest in Ohio like we’ve invested in them. We need to fight for American autoworkers in every way we can, and that starts with passing the American Cars, American Jobs Act. https://t.co/Sllq4cGikM
Today, @USDOL approved a National Dislocated Worker Grant for Lordstown workers laid off by GM. This grant will help the workers who built this company access the resources and retraining needed to find new jobs and support their families.
Wells Fargo’s at it again.	 	They say they’re “Re-established,” but so far it’s just more of the same.	https://t.co/64pEAiuOio

We also remember how, in the face of unimaginable loss, we set our differences aside and came together as Americans. We saw what united us, not what divided us. #NeverForget
On the anniversary of the September 11th attacks, we remember the victims, survivors, and the courageous first responders who put themselves in harm’s way 17 years ago today and every day.
Shana Tova to all who are celebrating #RoshHashanah. Wishing you a sweet and fulfilling new year.
Our priority is supporting the victims, law enforcement and community, and my office stands ready to assist with whatever they need. As we cope with yet another gun violence tragedy we must also recognize that thoughts and prayers are not enough. -SB
We will all be hugging our loved ones a little tighter tonight as we pray for everyone affected by the senseless shooting in Cincinnati. Thank you to the first responders who rushed to the scene, law enforcement still investigating and everyone caring for those who were injured.
We are thinking of everyone involved as we closely monitor the ongoing situation in Cincinnati. We’re grateful to law enforcement and first responders on the scene. -SB
We call it a farm bill, but it is really a food bill, it’s a jobs and economic development bill, it’s a research bill, it’s a rural broadband bill; it’s a bill that affects everyone in the country. Looking forward to continuing to work on this important legislation.
The House-Senate Farm Bill conference committee had a good first meeting today. We need to get the Farm Bill done this year and provide farmers with the certainty they deserve. https://t.co/5nYWLmbEwy

We know this is just a first step and there’s a lot more work to do to protect our first responders. But this bill will help us make progress. https://t.co/7NCIzJ7vgQ
Working people need Justices who will put their rights first, not Justices who will side with insurance companies over cancer survivors, financial scammers over customers, or massive corporations over American workers.
#WhatsAtStake with Justice Kavanaugh’s nomination? 		The next Court could be presented with critical decisions regarding protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions.

On #LaborDay, we honor the men and women who built this country, and who continue to power our economy to this day. Thank you to those workers – and in particular, the workers who aren’t able to spend today at picnics and barbeques, because they don’t have the day off. https://t.co/nUxH6VE0AY
Local law enforcement officers are on the frontlines of our efforts to combat illegal fentanyl, and our opioid legislation must do more for them. The POWER Act would give them stronger tools to protect themselves from dangerous drugs like fentanyl. https://t.co/2mmrUTp3ND

My number one priority is to stop Ohio jobs from moving overseas, and that’s what I will continue fighting for as negotiations with Canada continue. -SB
I’m glad talks with Canada are continuing, and I hope we are able to secure a better deal for Ohio workers. But we still have a lot of work to do before anything is final.
To the millions of American workers working too many hours for too little pay, let me tell you, you aren’t invisible to me, you are not invisible to Democratic officeholders in this country. We see you. We hear you. We fight for you.		PS: Don’t you dare call us the rustbelt. -SB https://t.co/nUxH6VE0AY

Because of excessive heat and lack of air conditioning, schools across Ohio are closed today. 		Teachers and students shouldn’t have to miss out on valuable time in the classroom because our school districts don’t have the resources they need to upgrade aging schools.
We still have a lot of work to do to bring Canada on board and write the legislation needed to make any deal a reality, and I will keep working with Lighthizer to make sure every detail is right for Ohio workers. -SB
We still need to review the text of the tentative agreement with Mexico, but this is an important step forward. I have been working closely with our top trade negotiator, @USTradeRep Bob Lighthizer. In fact I just spoke to him again late last night.
ECOT stole taxpayer dollars and cheated Ohio students. That’s why I’m introducing legislation to return that money where it belongs – to Ohio students. -SB https://t.co/ZxE5SP3mo4
Shady lenders and predatory for-profit schools gained an ally at the @CFPB , while students have lost their chief watchdog. The CFPB needs an independent Director who will fight for servicemembers and students. -SB https://t.co/0RGcAQ8auU
As we grapple with yet another senseless act of gun violence in Florida yesterday and offer support to the victims, law enforcement, and community, we must also acknowledge that thoughts and prayers alone are not enough.
Just as importantly, he made no secret of his love for his wife, Cindy, and his family. Connie and I are thinking of them now. May their memories of this great man sustain them. -SB
John McCain was an American hero who embodied our nation’s most cherished values: service and sacrifice. He was a leader to senators from both parties, a touchstone on foreign and domestic issues.
Connie and I are praying for everyone involved. We are grateful to all Ohio law enforcement who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe. -SB https://t.co/hYZm5SIo62

Looking forward to reading Mick Mulvaney’s response to these thoughtful letters – as his response to the letter signed by 49 senators last week was….lackluster, to say the least. https://t.co/HoZouQvGfS
This week, 38 veterans and military organizations came together with one message to the @CFPB: don't take away protections for our servicemembers and their families, who've sacrificed so much for our country. https://t.co/8TjtHvrpEF
With millions of working Americans, who just want to know that their hard-earned paychecks will be protected from scams and shady lenders? 		Ms. Kraninger has made her choice pretty clear. 		It’s up to us to stand on the side of the people we serve. -SB
This vote is about whose side you’re on. 		Are we going to stand with mothers who want nothing more than to hold their child again? With servicemembers who had their cars illegally repossessed while serving our country overseas?
To my colleagues: it’s not enough to talk. Use your vote in this committee to make sure that this person -- who refused to oppose, to acknowledge, or to apologize for this disaster -- does not get a promotion. 		Don’t look the other way like Ms. Kraninger did.
In contrast, nearly every member of the @SenateBanking committee – on both sides of the dais – spoke out, and said that child separation is wrong. 		Now is our chance to use our power as Senators to do something about it.
We’ve all seen pix, heard tapes of crying kids being pulled apart from their parents. As an American, as a parent, as a human being, I don’t know how you can’t be horrified by this. But Kraninger hasn’t offered a word of criticism about her or her boss’s part in this catastrophe.
Ms. Kraninger had a role in the policy of separating children from their families at the border, too. We know, because Ms. Kraninger told us, that she was the “principal policy official” at OMB overseeing DHS working on this policy. 		She won’t tell us any more than that.
Ms. Kraninger was one of Mr. Mulvaney’s lead staff on providing emergency assistance to Puerto Rico after it was ravaged by hurricanes – a botched response that left tens of thousands of American citizens without power and without aid after an enormous natural disaster.
Ms. Kraninger has not spoken up and said she’ll defend our troops from payday lenders that prey on them – which speaks volumes.
If there was ever any doubt at how important this agency is – and how damaging it can be in the wrong hands – we don’t have to look any further than Mr. Mulvaney’s outrageous actions last week, announcing @CFPB is no longer going after shady lenders that cheat our servicemembers.
Kathy Kraninger has no relevant experience in finance or consumer protection, and has refused to answer questions about her record or intentions. What she has told us is that she won’t be an independent advocate for American consumers – the entire job she is supposed to do.
.@GM’s laid off almost 3,000 workers at their Lordstown plant over the last two years – upending their lives. @RepTimRyan and I are urging @SecretaryAcosta to approve a grant for these workers quickly, and help them get workforce training and job placement services. https://t.co/OREOoSANXW
The American Cars, American Jobs Act has two simple parts: customers who buy cars made in America get a discount, and corporations that send jobs overseas lose a special tax break. It’s designed to help American workers and support American jobs. https://t.co/XAFPazieWx
We’ve seen it right here in Ohio, where we have more than 80 of these community schools already.
These schools have a proven track record of success. They’re associated with improving student attendance, social and emotional well-being, and academic achievement. Investing in more of them is a slam dunk – for our children, and for our communities.
This bill would invest $45M in full-service community schools around the country by directing resources to schools serving low-income students, particularly in areas that have been hit the hardest by addiction – 30% of the funds would be set aside specifically for rural schools.
Unfortunately for our schools and our basketball teams, not every community has a LeBron James. Introducing a bill today with @ChrisVanHollen that would provide support &amp; tools for other schools to expand the programs we know work for students, inside &amp; outside of the classroom.
.@KingJames' new I Promise School in Akron incorporates everything from free breakfast and lunch to job placement help for parents – things we know our students need to thrive. https://t.co/eHqwfKEZUY
If Kathy Kraninger isn’t qualified, won’t answer our questions, and helped separate children from their families, why should we vote to confirm her as @CFPB Director? https://t.co/rhCYcfCKlO
And weeks after the hearing, Mr. Mulvaney announced the @CFPB would no longer protect servicemembers and their families, and ended reviews of payday lenders for violations of the Military Lending Act. Ms. Kraninger has said nothing. https://t.co/Tib00FombN
The @USAToday Editorial Board summed it up in a sentence: “The Senate and the public know little more about Kraninger today than they did before the hearing.” https://t.co/jpfq88H0e5
And in her role at OMB, Ms. Kraninger was responsible for the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. When asked about her role in the Administration’s cruel and disastrous family separation policy, she refused to answer. #FamiliesBelongTogether
When the Administration nominated Ms. Kraninger to run the @CFPB, they pointed to her senior position at OMB as “management experience” which qualified her for the job. When she was asked for details about this management experience, she refused to answer.
And part of the @CFPB’s mission is to protect students from predatory lenders and high interest rates. As Director, Mulvaney weakened these protections. But when Ms. Kraninger was asked if she would reinstate the Bureau’s student office, she refused to answer.
The @CFPB is supposed to pursue predatory payday lenders and hold them accountable, but Mick Mulvaney’s appointment ground that work to a halt. When asked if she’d follow Mulvaney’s lead – at several points throughout the hearing – Ms. Kraninger refused to answer.
The @CFPB needs a Director with a proven track record of working for consumers. Unfortunately, Kathy Kraninger has no experience whatsoever in consumer protection. And her hearing with the @SenateBanking Committee left us with even more questions about her qualifications.
We fought hard to expand Medicaid in Ohio – this is why:	• The rate of uninsured adults in Ohio is down nearly half since 2012	• More Ohioans are able to receive the treatment they need for mental illness &amp; substance abuse, including opioid addiction		https://t.co/tQpPwITWHo
When we fight for American autoworkers and steelworkers, we’re fighting for entire communities. And that’s what the American Cars, American Jobs Act does. https://t.co/JttAsxzO5a
The bottom line: we cannot trust Kathy Kraninger to uphold the @CFPB’s mission of working for consumers and aggressively pursuing bad actors. 	https://t.co/jpfq88H0e5

Auto manufacturers get a tax break when they ship jobs overseas. That’s just wrong.	 	Our American Cars, American Jobs act will revoke that tax break, and offer incentives to consumers who buy American-made vehicles.	https://t.co/L7MJsdWDVq
A study this week found that the financial crisis cost every American $70,000.		Wall Street’s recklessness continues to steal money from workers’ pockets. Instead of relaxing protections, we need to do all that we can to make sure this never happens again. https://t.co/wKmRvmDIHq

Nobody wants Mr. Mulvaney out of the @CFPB faster than I do. But American consumers can’t afford five years of someone who stands with the bankers in this administration &amp; on Wall Street. We need a CFPB Director who will sit with hardworking families at their kitchen tables. -SB
She's been involved in managing one disastrous policy after another. The botched response to hurricanes in PR has left US citizens to fend for themselves. A housing policy that would increase homelessness. The admin’s cruelest policy yet—separating kids from their families.
At the Office of Management and Budget, she signed off on a $1.9 trillion dollar tax break for millionaires. To pay for it, she helped write a budget that would triple the rent for families that are already struggling to get by.
For months, I urged the Administration to nominate someone to lead the @CFPB who had a track record of working for consumers.  Unfortunately, Ms. Kraninger has no experience whatsoever in consumer protection.
Congress created the @CFPB to prevent the need for those heartbreaking conversations ever again. From 2012 to 2017, the CFPB won 12 billion dollars in relief for 29 million Americans. That’s 12 billion reasons for Wall Street to hate the CFPB.
The financial crisis started when greedy lenders lured families into scam loans they could not afford. Behind all the numbers were thousands upon thousands of painful conversations around kitchen tables.

Mr. Quarles missed the 2008 crisis the last time he was in charge, and has spent his time at the Fed doing favors for Wall Street at the expense of working families. Americans can’t afford to reappoint a nominee who failed American workers, homeowners, and taxpayers. -SB
The last thing we ought to be doing is installing another nominee – this time, for a term of fourteen years – who doesn’t seem to understand that workers are the backbone of our economy.
Wall Street simply does not respect the dignity of work. Data from last week tells a story Ohioans know too well – while big banks and corporations are doing better than ever, workers still haven’t gotten a meaningful raise.
The Fed’s job is to ensure that the economy works for average Americans. During his time in the Bush Administration, and in his role at the Fed so far, Randy Quarles has done the opposite. Time and time again, Mr. Quarles has sided with Wall Street, not workers.
When Randy Quarles’ nomination to serve as Vice Chair of Supervision at the Fed came before the Senate last fall, I urged my colleagues to vote no. 		Everything about his record in the last ten months confirms my worst fears.
Sherrod’s asking Powell if he thinks we should focus on real wages rather than nominal ones – “and by that measure is the typical worker really better off this year than he or she was a year ago?”
And this is all while corporate profits are soaring, and workers are working harder and producing more than ever before. https://t.co/Fc1wJQj6Ar
On a nominal basis, wages have gone up a bit.  But in real terms, wages haven’t budged recently.  @BLS_gov reported that the hours for production and nonsupervisory workers are flat and pay has actually dropped over the past year.  That’s four out of five workers.
Last week, Chair Powell said, “As unemployment has declined — now all the way down to 4 percent, the lowest it's been in 20 years — we would have expected wages to move up fairly significantly. We now just in the last year or so, we have seen wages move up.”
Much of that is up to Congress to address, but over the last six months, I have only seen the Fed moving in the direction of making it easier for financial institutions to cut corners, and I have only become more worried about our preparedness for the next crisis. -SB
And we should be turning our attention to bigger issues that don’t get enough attention, like how the value placed on work has declined in this country, and how our economy increasingly measures success only in quarterly earnings reports.
When banks are making record profits, we should be preparing the financial system for the next crisis, building up capital, investing in workers, and combatting asset bubbles.
The regulators are loosening rules around big bank capital, dismantling the @CFPB, ignoring the role of the FSOC, undermining the Volcker Rule, and weakening the Community Reinvestment Act.
Three banks – Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and State Street – all had capital below the amount required to pass the stress tests, but the Fed gave them passing grades anyway.
Earlier this month, as part of the annual stress tests, the Fed allowed the 7 largest banks to redirect $96B to dividends &amp; buybacks. This money might have been used to pay workers, reduce fees for consumers, protect taxpayers from bailouts, or be deployed to help US businesses.
While hours have increased a bit over the past year for workers as a whole, real hourly earnings have not.  And for production and nonsupervisory workers, hours are flat and pay has actually dropped slightly, according to @BLS_gov.
Meanwhile, the tax bill’s impact beyond Wall Street – on workers who haven’t seen a real raise in years, on young Americans drowning in student loan debt, on families trying to buy their first home – is an open question at best.
If you just look at Wall Street, it certainly looks strong – that’s what happens after $1.5 trillion dollars in tax cuts for corporations and wealthy Americans are funneled into stock buybacks and dividends, juicing stock prices.
Just last week, a Federal Reserve official said, “There are definitely downside risks, but the strength of the economy is really pretty important at the moment. The fundamentals for the U.S. economy are very strong.”

At @SenateBanking tomorrow, we want to hear Fed Chair Powell’s thoughts on why workers are not doing better 10 years into an economic recovery.

The Ukrainian community in Ohio knows all too well the dangers of unchecked Russian aggression. We must demand Russia turn over the spies who hacked our election and show Putin we will not put up with threats to our infrastructure that undercut our democratic institutions. -SB

Any national paid leave plan should build on the #FMLA, and reflect the well-established needs laid out in that law – parental leave, family care leave, personal medical leave, and military caregiving leave. -SB
It’s important we understand what we’re talking about when we discuss Family &amp; Medical Leave. Some policy makers tend to talk about paid fam &amp; med leave in terms of new parents. This is an important piece but we’re also talking about caring for sick or elderly parents &amp; partners.
"One of the most common misconceptions is that #FMLA is just about new babies – and it is not. 75% of people use it....for family caregiving or personal medical leave....About 55% of uses are for somebody who has their own serious health condition." - @VShabo of @NPWF

"We all want to help families navigate a changing economy, and make sure hard work pays off. We believe that all work has dignity. So I’m encouraged that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are taking this seriously."
"Any national paid leave plan should build on the #FMLA, and reflect the well-established needs laid out in that law – parental leave, family care leave, personal medical leave, and military caregiving leave."
"We also know that only covering parental leave excludes the vast majority of workers. Three-quarters of Americans who use the #FMLA take time off to care for their own health or that of a seriously ill family member."
"Using your retirement security to fund paid time off from work when you have a child is not paid family leave at all – it’s robbing from your retirement to be able to care for loved ones now."
"Unfortunately, the approach some of our colleagues are currently proposing amounts to cutting Social Security for the workers who need it most."
"My Republican colleagues also have some ideas on the table, and I want to thank them for their desire to work together on this issue. Democrats too are at the table, ready to negotiate and reach a solution that can become law."
"Today, Democrats have put forward a thoughtful approach that I believe could reach consensus. This is a commonsense bill that builds on Social Security. It would offer low-cost, portable benefits that all US workers would earn &amp; it would be paid for by both workers &amp; employers."
"Today’s bipartisan hearing is an important baby step forward on this issue. Members of both parties are coming together to recognize that this isn’t acceptable in a modern economy, &amp; acknowledging that we have to expand our social insurance to include paid family medical leave."
"American families lose nearly $21 billion in wages each year because they don’t have access to paid leave. People who work in jobs like ours, who wear suits and have good benefits, may not realize that the vast majority of American workers have no paid family leave at all."

Thanks @IvankaTrump. Paid family leave isn’t a Republican issue or a Democratic issue – it affects every sector of the economy, and workers of all ages with all types of families. Glad we’re coming together to work toward a bipartisan solution. https://t.co/ZC41Jnv233
I plan to review Judge Kavanaugh’s record thoroughly and ask him tough questions face-to-face before I make my decision. I will not support any Justice who would take rights away from Ohioans. -SB
I’m already very troubled by the Supreme Court’s recent decisions stripping rights from Ohioans, and I have serious concerns about some of Judge Kavanaugh’s rulings against women’s rights and consumer rights.
This summer, we partnered with organizations across Ohio to offer 19 camps in 15 counties. To find a manufacturing camp near you, visit → https://t.co/iViTrAiaSO
And starting this week, girls at our Lorain County camps will explore careers in everything from logistics &amp; design to engineering &amp; tech. Manufacturing jobs aren’t just for men – and the educational opportunities given to our students should reflect that.	https://t.co/3lHFiddl9k
At another camp in Ross County, students worked in teams to build solar powered cars. They also toured Kenworth facilities, and got the chance to use robotics equipment. 	https://t.co/vUBqIthYjC
Last month, Youngstown students attended a medical manufacturing camp, and learned about STEM jobs in their community. One of the week’s highlights: building a prosthetic leg out of recycled materials.	https://t.co/uFKKTOLW9W
This is the sixth straight year our office has hosted these camps – which are often the first interaction students have with local manufacturing. These summer camps help Ohio students realize all the potential careers they could have in Ohio manufacturing.
Spent the morning in Mahoning County, meeting students at a Summer Manufacturing Camp our office helped organize. Our day at camp included lessons about energy technology and a visit to KTSDI, a local manufacturer. https://t.co/3risLatnqN

This year, we also express our gratitude to the @FBI and our law enforcement for keeping Cleveland and our neighbors safe during today’s festivities.
Happy 4th of July! Today, we celebrate our independence and thank the service members, veterans, and military families who’ve sacrificed so much to protect our freedom.

What’s worse is that the Federal Reserve wants to make life even easier for the big banks, by removing a key funding constraint and reportedly making next year’s tests even easier. -SB
Instead of payouts to executives and wealthy shareholders, big banks should be reinvesting profits into workers, lowering costs for consumers, and taking steps to avoid more taxpayer bailouts.

An attack on public service unions is an attack on all unions, &amp; an attack on unions is an attack on all workers.

I’m already very troubled by SCOTUS' actions in just the last few weeks—taking away workers’ rights, voters’ rights &amp; women’s rights. I hope POTUS will take this opportunity to bring Americans together by appointing someone with a well-respected record all sides can support. -SB
The decision in #JanusvsAFSCME is shameful, and it’s a setback – but we're not going to stop organizing and fighting back for workers who build the middle class. We will always #StandWithWorkers.
Pope Francis said, “We don't get dignity from power nor money or culture. We get dignity from work.” And part of the dignity of work is about giving workers power in their workplace, and a seat at the table.
#JanusvsAFSCME is an attack on workers' freedom to advocate for themselves. Workers produce more than ever, but don’t share in the wealth they create. Our economy doesn’t value work. We change that by giving workers a voice in the businesses they help build – not silencing them.
Thanks to the families from each of Ohio’s children’s hospitals for coming in today to tell your stories and discuss everything from the importance of Medicaid to superhero parties.

We have more to do to make sure that every worker feels safe, supported, and heard in their workplace – regardless of where that is.
Just now, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation that will improve how cases of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination are handled on Capitol Hill. This is an important step forward, but it's just the beginning.
Last week, @Pontifex called our current financial system “an inadequate framework that exclude[s] the common good.” We're not going to give up on making that better – and that starts with listening to the people we serve, and fighting for the protections they need.
#DoddFrankRollBack – which just got signed into law – increases the likelihood of a big bank failure and a financial crisis, and adds $671 million to the deficit. Make no mistake: it's a gift for Wall Street, and a setback for Main Street.
Wages have been largely flat. 44 percent of Americans adults can’t afford an emergency expense of $400. One in four renters spends half their income on housing. But in light of all that, this Congress thought the best thing to do was to pass another giveaway to big banks.

Yesterday, Congress once again sided with special interests and Wall Street instead of taxpayers, homeowners, students and working families. This is shameful, and it’s a setback – but we’re going to keep working to hold banks accountable and protect consumers.

Workers deserve to have their day in court when they've been wronged. This ruling means they'll have to settle their claims behind closed doors with private arbitration – giving the power to the employer.

Our workers are more than a line item in a budget, a cost to be minimized – rather, they are our greatest resource. When their hard work doesn’t pay off – when they have no economic security and their paychecks don’t reflect the work they do – our economy cannot grow.

Simply propping up the PBGC is not enough. We can’t take our hands off the wheel, close our eyes and allow this car to crash, simply because we bought an insurance policy.
We have the opportunity to do just that – to keep those businesses open, to save those jobs, and to ensure workers get the entire retirement they earned.
Ask anyone who’s ever totaled a car or dealt with flooding or fire in their homes – you’re sure glad you have insurance. But you’d much rather have avoided the disaster in the first place.
PBGC is the insurance company for these retirement plans. Like any insurance plan, PBGC doesn’t kick in until the damage has been done – after businesses have gone under, and after jobs have been lost, PBGC is supposed to cover part of the retirement workers earned.
WATCH LIVE: Sherrod and @senorrinhatch chair the third hearing of the Pensions Committee, focused on the crisis threatening the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation – which serves as the insurance company for multiemployer pensions. https://t.co/Q03473xTwb
Thank you to everyone who made their voices heard in this fight. And as this #NetNeutrality bill moves to the House, keep the momentum going.
A victory in the Senate today for the thousands of Ohioans who depend on a free and open Internet. #NetNeutrality is about keeping the Internet accessible for small businesses, students, entrepreneurs, startups, and Ohioans looking for jobs - and these people won today.

The third bill is the Working Families Tax Relief Act. This would provide a stronger Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit to more families and workers. https://t.co/Vx4bMxVklS
Then there's the Corporate Freeloader Fee: if you pay your workers what their work is worth, you get a tax cut. But if you choose to pay people so low that they are forced onto government assistance, you have to reimburse taxpayers. https://t.co/YZtz7FZrk1

Make no mistake: this so-called “tax cut” was never about helping middle class families. The people we serve deserve better.
In fact, @CNBC found that the tax cut riches have gone to executives and investors over workers by a nearly 3-to-1 margin. https://t.co/zEvIF3PDys
Over $250 billion of corporate buybacks have been authorized so far in 2018. That money isn’t going to increased wages or newly created jobs. It’s simply making the rich richer. https://t.co/wJy4htk04F
A stock buyback is when a corporation buys back its own stock from its shareholders. Why would it do that? 		It drives up the price of the stock, leading to a windfall for shareholders and executives.
Months after the Republican tax bill passed, we’re watching corporations do exactly what they told us they’d do all along: rather than raising wages and creating jobs, they're rewarding their investors and execs with billions of dollars, right now in the form of stock buybacks.

That's why, as the UN meets today, it's critical that the President build international support around clear objectives for ending the violence in Syria and holding Russia and Iran accountable for enabling the Assad regime. -SB
We've learned from the past that a military strike without a diplomatic plan will leave us right back here again a year from now.
It's past time for the President to present a long-term strategy to the American people, and he must win their support before taking further military action.
First, I'm grateful to our servicemembers who carried out this mission. Last night's strikes appear to be a targeted and proportional response to the Assad regime's gruesome attacks on civilians, and it's important that our allies in Britain and France were part of this process.
If @POTUS and @USTradeRep are serious about negotiating new, pro-worker trade agreements with our Asian partners, I am ready to work with them to secure the best possible deals for Ohio. -SB
Anything that looks, sounds or smells like TPP would be a disaster for Ohio jobs. @POTUS must keep his promise to Ohio workers and stay away from this failed trade agreement.
GM cannot pocket billions of dollars in tax cuts and turn around and fire Ohio workers whose livelihoods depend on these jobs. I expect GM to tell Ohioans immediately how they plan to use their tax windfall to keep Ohioans in their jobs. -SB https://t.co/LjQwCdGdut

We have to phase out the separate minimum wage that forces those who earn tips to work for less and raise wages for all workers – in the front and back of the house. Customers and servers should not have to subsidize companies that refuse to pay decent wages.
This omnibus thankfully blocks @USDOL’s proposed rule that would force workers to forfeit their hard-earned tips to employers – it’s not a perfect solution, but it gives workers permanent protections under the law.
I think you need to take responsibility and get things right. HUD’s mission is too important to do otherwise. And getting things right means fighting for the funding needed to help more people in this country get a roof over their head. -SB
Instead of taking responsibility, Mr. Secretary, you seem to want to blame others – your wife picked out the furniture without knowing the price, your spokesman said something but not you, you shouldn’t be blamed for not listening to your ethics lawyers, the press is unfair....

These are not the banks down the street lending to homeowners in Sandusky or businesses in Findlay. These are some of the most complex global banks that hold almost 1.4 trillion dollars in assets in the United States and more than 14 trillion dollars in assets abroad.
And this bill could help banks like Barclays and UBS and BNP Paribas. Banks that have rigged interest rates, helped people evade taxes, violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and Sudan, and manipulated energy markets.
This bill could help Deutsche Bank, which the IMF called, “the most important net contributor to systemic risks” of all worldwide banks.
Banks like Santander - a bank that illegally repossessed cars from eleven hundred American service men and women while they were serving our country - could have its rules rolled back under this bill.

RT @BuzzFeedBen: I'm interviewing @SenSherrodBrown tomorrow on #AM2DM. What should I ask him?
Why are we giving a single ounce of help to these big banks? Besides being repeat offenders, these are the very banks that compete with our local lenders. If we’re trying to help our community banks and credit unions, why give away any favors to their competition?
Why are we doing any favors for Citigroup?  Just last month, it announced that it systematically overcharged 1.75 million of its customers on their credit cards.
What has HSBC done to deserve any special treatment? Just since the crisis, the Department of Justice prosecuted the bank for laundering money on behalf of the Sinaloa drug cartel.
What has Wells Fargo done to deserve an ounce of leniency? This is a bank that created more than 3.5 million fake accounts, including more than 1,500 in Ohio. And yet the bank wants more, more, more.
If we want to help community banks, why not just help community banks? If we want to help credit unions, why not just help credit unions? If we want to help regionals, why not just help regionals? Why do the big banks get to have more, more, more? #DoddFrankRollback

To summarize the recurrence of @RealMeatLoaf lyrics at @SenateBanking: “It Just Won’t Quit.” Will it go on forever? https://t.co/CZadUdKcx1
@jctgov @CustomsBorder @ARCgov That means money will automatically be taken from Medicare &amp; other programs like support for Ohio farmers and funding that ensures @CustomsBorder can keep our borders secure in order to pay for the $1 trillion hole the Republican tax plan blows in the deficit. Shameful.
@jctgov @CustomsBorder @ARCgov These programs are getting cut because of a law called Pay-As-You-Go - if by the end of '17, the cost of all leg passed this yr would increase the deficit compared to previous yrs, it triggers automatic spending cuts across the budget including Medicare &amp; other critical programs.
@jctgov @CustomsBorder Appalachian Regional Commission: $4 million would be cut from @ARCgov, which supports Ohio and twelve other states across Appalachia to stimulate local economies, provide job training, expand broadband access in rural areas, and support local infrastructure needs.
@jctgov @CustomsBorder Payments to the Military Retirement Fund: The Military Retirement Fund, which supports retirement benefits for Ohio members of the military who have retired from active duty, as well as disability and survivor benefits, would be cut by $7.5 billion.
@jctgov @CustomsBorder Transportation Funding: More than $850 million would be cut from federal programs to build and maintain Ohio’s roads, bridges, and airports.
@jctgov @CustomsBorder Benefits for Public Safety Officers: $10 million would be cut from the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program, which provides disability benefits to Ohio officers injured in the line of duty as well as survivor &amp; education benefits to family members killed in the line of duty.
@jctgov @CustomsBorder Support for Ohio farmers: More than $18 billion would be cut from programs that help Ohio farmers do everything from stabilize farm prices to protect Lake Erie.
@jctgov Border Security: @CustomsBorder's operations and support will be cut by $1.3 billion. That makes U.S. borders less secure overall and takes critical resources away from Customs and Border Patrol officers working to keep fentanyl from entering Ohio communities.
.@jctgov confirmed GOP tax bill will add $1tril to the federal deficit, even after accounting for economic growth. We know that will force automatic cuts to Medicare - but what else will be slashed to pay for tax cuts to corporations that send jobs overseas? 	Here are just a few:

HAPPENING NOW: @SenateBanking is voting on amendments to improve #DoddFrankRollback by providing relief for consumers.
#DoddFrankRollback allows some banks to sell you an adjustable rate mortgage they know you can’t afford, takes away your right to go before a judge to block a wrongful foreclosure, and rolls back protections that help ensure you can afford the true price of homeownership.
#DoddFrankRollback puts taxpayers at risk of another bank bailout and puts homeowners at risk of the same traps that led to the foreclosure crisis – all while doing virtually nothing for hardworking Americans.

In all seriousness - the Senate Republican tax plan hands a massive tax cut to millionaires and corporations who ship their jobs overseas, while middle class Americans foot the bill. That's shameful.
3. Millionaires should be extra grateful for their fortunes under this bill - those earning $1M+ will pay 4.2% less in federal taxes by 2021, while those making between $20k - $30k will pay 13.3% more.
2. The new incentives to outsource production and keep jobs overseas may be like Christmas coming early for wealthy corporate executives. They'll be literally rewarded for their offshore profits - what a gift!
1. Corporations should be very grateful for the permanent tax cut they're given in this bill! While middle class families are left to wonder what will become of their temporary tax cuts, corps can rest easy this Thanksgiving knowing their tax rate will be cut by more than 40%.
It's almost Thanksgiving - a time for Americans to sit back and reflect with gratitude on what we have. And with their new tax bill this year, Senate Republicans are giving corporations and millionaires a whole lot to be thankful for.
No one should ever have to feel afraid, ashamed, or silenced simply for being who they are. Violence – of any kind – cannot and will not be tolerated. #TDOR https://t.co/XJtzFN742J
@USCBO IN SHORT: this bill doesn’t cut taxes for working people. Instead, it takes away Ohioans’ healthcare and cuts the Medicare they have paid into for years – all to pay for tax cuts for the very corporations that send Ohio jobs overseas.
@USCBO 6. On Thurs, JCT revealed that even while the bill makes its corporate tax cuts permanent, it lets the cuts for working Americans expire in just a few years. According to a study from JCT, families earning &lt; $75k would start seeing annual increase in taxes over the next decade.
@USCBO 5. Also on Wednesday, the Joint Economic Committee revealed that the bill would force a $25 billion cut to Medicare next year and a $16.4 billion Medicare cut for Ohio over ten years. https://t.co/EzlfdQ7GHw https://t.co/pOi2tkyG9N

2. We learned the GOP had slipped a provision into their bill to repeal ACA, a move @USCBO said will actually take away $338B that currently goes toward helping working families afford their insurance to help pay for corporate tax cuts to the same companies who outsource US jobs.

@jctgov Make no mistake: this is just another way that Senate Republicans are trying to hike taxes on the middle class, so they can spend billions more on tax cuts for millionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas.
The head of the nonpartisan @jctgov wrote in 2011 that - if the government decided to use chained CPI for taxes - 69% of the tax increase would come from taxpayers with incomes under $100,000, while taxpayers in the highest income brackets would barely feel the effect.
Right now, Senate Republicans are trying to use an accounting trick, known as a chained Consumer Price Index (CPI), in the new tax code. This would mean less adjustment for inflation, a tax increase that would disproportionately impact middle-class families.
Thank you @Sen_JoeManchin, @SenatorHeitkamp, @SenatorBaldwin, @SenDonnelly, @SenatorDurbin, @SenDuckworth, @SenGaryPeters, @SenFranken, @clairecmc, @SenStabenow, &amp; Sen Klobuchar for joining me in introducing the Butch Lewis Act to protect workers' hard-earned retirement.

@DispatchAlerts If confirmed as Comptroller of the Currency, Mr. Otting would be in charge of ensuring all national banks, including banks like Wells Fargo, are complying with the law, operating in a safe and sound manner, and protecting consumers.		Can we really trust him to do that?
@DispatchAlerts The abuses were so bad that Mr. Otting signed an OCC consent order – a legal agreement a bank and its regulator enter into when illegal practices at the bank have gotten so bad, the government has to step in.  In any other Administration, this would be disqualifying.
According to @DispatchAlerts, under Mr. Otting’s watch from 2009 to 2015, nearly 2,000 Ohioans, in just our six largest counties, were foreclosed on by OneWest.
This Administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of policing itself. And Joseph Otting is yet another bank exec who profited off the financial crisis who is being rewarded by the Trump Administration with a powerful job overseeing our nation’s banking system.

16 patient and consumer groups agree: repealing the individual mandate results in 13 million more Americans uninsured and higher premiums – and that’s unacceptable. https://t.co/535Izp0WlU
@USCBO Tax reform should be about cutting taxes for working families, not raising the price of their health insurance.
@USCBO Good question. @USCBO also says repeal would save the government $338 billion by taking away money that now goes to help people afford insurance.  Aha! That’s $338 billion more they can spend on tax cuts for millionaires and corporations that send jobs overseas.
According to @USCBO, repealing the individual mandate would kick 13 million people off their health insurance &amp; increase premiums by 10%. 		So what does kicking some people off their insurance &amp; making it more expensive for others have to do with tax reform?

We have a chance to work together in a bipartisan way to do some real good for American workers.
The solution is pretty simple – let’s cut out the middle man.	 	Instead of giving money to corporations, and hoping some of it ends up in the pockets of working people, let’s just give the money directly to working people.
The only problem is, it doesn’t work – and it never has.
Instead, this bill hands more than a trillion dollars to wealthy multinational corporations – some of the same corporations that have sent American jobs overseas – and asks working people to trust that somehow that money will end up increasing their wages.
That’s what the President says he wants. That’s what I want – and I hope we get there.	 	Unfortunately, that’s not what this bill does right now.

@CFPB Our job is to fight for the servicemembers, student borrowers, seniors, and hardworking Americans who depend on @CFPB to look out for them.
@CFPB Wall Street banks and payday lenders have armies of lobbyists and lawyers on their sides.
.@CFPB arbitration rule ensures Ohioans can see their day in court if they are scammed—at its core, it's financial protection for consumers.
Too many financial companies continue to use forced arbitration to block customers from seeking justice once they’ve been cheated or harmed.
It's simple: forced arbitration always gives the advantage to big banks. Big banks use forced arbitration to take advantage of customers.

@CFPB The @CFPB payday lending rule is good for our country, and good for Ohio. Learn more here: https://t.co/yBYrStFcQB
@CFPB Payday lenders have exploited loophole after loophole to trap working people in debt. This will help put an end to their abusive practices.
@CFPB The @CFPB rule prevents shady lenders from taking control of your checking account &amp; offers Ohioans a path to affordably pay down loans.
Recently, @CFPB finalized payday lending rule, to rein in predatory payday loans that often keep working people trapped in a cycle of debt.
These payday lenders saddle borrowers with triple-digit interest rates &amp; cost Ohioans over $500 million/year in fees alone.
Why did Ohio try to cap these rates? Shady payday lenders have only their own interests at heart.
Ohio has the highest payday loan prices in the US - despite the fact that almost 2/3 of Ohioans voted to cap payday loan rates.
Now more than ever, Congress should come together and prevent prices from spiking for Ohio families. -SB

@WellsFargo And yet @WellsFargo told this committee that fraudulent sales practices were limited to the Community Bank.
@WellsFargo The bank was aware of the problems in its auto loan division in July 2016.
@WellsFargo It also revealed it had stuck 800k customers w/ auto insurance policies – w/o telling them or checking to see if they already had insurance.
@WellsFargo In August, @WellsFargo finally disclosed that the number of fraudulent accounts was at least 3.5M -- 70% higher than it originally reported.
@WellsFargo It subjected customers to forced arbitration, preventing them from their day in court, further concealing the fraud.
@WellsFargo Before being forced to come clean by a multi-agency investigation, @WellsFargo went to great lengths to bury this scandal.
@WellsFargo We have learned over the past year that the problems at @WellsFargo are much larger and more systemic than the bank originally disclosed.
@WellsFargo The bank’s punitive sales goals had pressured its employees into opening over 2 million fraudulent checking and credit card accounts.

@CFPB @CMSGov @usedgov Now the Senate is considering doing the same as early as this week.

@CFPB @CMSGov @usedgov But now action by Congress and the Administration puts those protections in jeopardy.
Thankfully, the @CFPB, the @CMSGov, and @usedgov took action to protect consumers.
These clauses, tucked in the fine print, force Ohioans to sign away their rights to access the court system if they are cheated.

@cbo We cannot let politicians in Washington, with taxpayer-funded healthcare, pull the rug out from under Ohio families and communities.
@cbo And #GrahamCassidy allows insurance companies to charge Ohioans age 50 and older more for their insurance.
According @CBO, the House GOP plan - nearly identical to #GrahamCassidy - would cause premiums to go up an average of about 20% next year.
And whether or not you're on Medicaid, you're looking at a premium increase next year if #GrahamCassidy becomes law.
As well as the 3 in 5 nursing home residents in Ohio who rely on Medicaid to cover the cost of their care.
Also hurt: 71,000 veterans in Ohio who get their coverage through Medicaid, and 150,000 Ohioans getting opioid treatment.
So who gets hurt by these Medicaid cuts?	To start: 973,000 children in Ohio who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance
It cuts a net $20 BILLION from Ohio. For every $1 OH spends on Medicaid on average, 63¢ comes from federal $ that #GrahamCassidy would cut.
#GrahamCassidy is just another name for kicking people off their insurance - it's dangerous and it will do irreparable damage to Ohio.

It freezes @PPFA funding, It weakens protections for coverage w/ pre-existing conditions.	 	It's bad for Ohio and it's bad for our country.
It enables states to redefine what qualifies as an "essential health benefit" – taking 10 benefits away from Ohio families.
It allows insurers to slap an age tax on Ohioans 50 + and raises their premiums.
This bill slashes the No. 1 tool we have in the opioid fight — Medicaid treatment.
It will undoubtedly cause premiums to spike.
#GrahamCassidy is just as dangerous as every repeal plan we've seen so far.

Equifax should remove forced arbitration from TrustedID immediately, not take advantage of customers they put at risk.

My concern is whether they will work for American taxpayers and working families. -SB
My concern isn’t whether today’s nominees have a great deal of experience working for banks. They do.
Mr. Quarles bemoaned the role of “the government” as a “player in the financial sector” rather than a “referee.”
Mr. Otting’s bank made money by kicking seniors out of their homes, and then turned around and said the government made them do it.
It was an opportunity to profit by flipping failing banks bought at low prices &amp; foreclosing on working fams–all while raking in taxpayer $.
But for wealthy bank executives and private equity investors, the crisis wasn’t a life-changing event.
The financial crisis devastated the Ohio families that lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings.
Banks were not “well capitalized.” Taxpayers paid billions to bail those banks out while Quarles &amp; his co turned a profit off of the crisis.
Contrary to Quarles’s predictions in 06, the economy was not “strong,” the financial sector was not “healthy” &amp; our future was not “bright.”
But many of his stmts from then lead me to wonder whether he was asleep at the switch or willfully turning a blind eye to Wall St abuses.
Mr. Quarles served as Treasury’s Undersecretary for Domestic Finance in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

10. Pediatric services - it should be as easy &amp; inexpensive as possible for our kids - like Benjamin from Akron - to get the care they need. https://t.co/e1dLWkPao6
9. Preventive and wellness services like screenings and vaccines - cost shouldn't prevent people from keeping themselves healthy.
8. Lab services - to make sure you're properly diagnosed, &amp; all the boxes are checked. Without insurance, this can amount to thousands of $.
7. Rehab services &amp; devices - sometimes, a diagnosis &amp; medication isn't enough to fully recover, and your full treatment should be covered.
6. Prescription drugs - it's no secret drug prices are getting higher &amp; higher, and insurance is a lifeline for so many who depend on them.
5. Mental health services &amp; addiction treatment - for people like Brittany, who said Medicaid was critical to her recovery from addiction. https://t.co/iwK3L2o6at
4. Care for women when they're pregnant - maternity care and treatment through labor and post-delivery, and care for newborns.
3. Hospitalization - surgeries, stitches, laboratory tests, and the room and board itself.
2. Emergency services - because no one should worry about whether or not they can afford care in a crisis.
1. Outpatient care you receive outside of a hospital - like routine checkups, screenings, and other regular procedures.

@CFPB @CFPBMilitary And just last week, the @CFPB published a rule that will guarantee Ohioans get their day in court if they are cheated by their bank.
@CFPB @CFPBMilitary Last October, the @CFPB levied a record-setting $100 million fine against Wells Fargo for its fake account scandal.
@CFPB @CFPBMilitary More than 23,000 Ohioans have filed complaints with the @CFPB against financial companies.
@CFPB That's including the work that @CFPBMilitary has done at 148 military facilities across the US to protect our servicemembers' hard earned $.
@CFPB In 6 years, the @CFPB’s actions have resulted in $12 billion in relief for more than 29 million American consumers.
This week marks the 6th birthday of the @CFPB—that's 6 yrs of protecting consumers from financial scams &amp; predatory practices by big banks.
Mr. Bush has a clear record of promoting bigotry and discrimination that has no place in our courts.

@PPact The American people deserve the chance to ask questions &amp; know what’s on voted on - and what we already know is painting a scary picture.
@PPact 0: the number of hearings the Senate GOP will have on their healthcare plan, which will raise prices and kick people off of their insurance.
1: the 1 and only provider singled out and defunded: @PPact (which 76,000+ Ohioans relied on for critical care in 2014 alone).
2: 23 million Americans would lose coverage under the Republican healthcare bill.
3: # of years lost off the Medicare trust fund, jeopardizing the solvency &amp; stability of the fund which benefits more than 2M Ohio seniors.
4: 40% of kids – or 2 out of every 5 kids – in Ohio are covered by Medicaid, a program that will be cut by 20% under the GOP plan.
5: 5:1 age bands would allow insurance companies to charge 50+ Americans more w/ an age tax. Premiums for all ages would go up 20% next yr.
6: # of days before #ACA vote that Senate committees posted bill text online. Senate spent 160hrs debating it, accepting 180+ GOP amendments
7: more than 70,000 Ohio veterans are at risk of losing their health coverage under the GOP plan. https://t.co/euqa92Q1aw
8: $800 billion cut to Medicaid, the number one program Ohio uses to fight opioid addiction. https://t.co/phepVcOt8S
9(%): the current rate of uninsured in the US – a historically low level, due to the #ACA. The Republican bill will take coverage away.
10: # of essential health benefits at risk, including hospital coverage, prescription drug coverage, mental health services, and pregnancy.
With Congressional Republicans writing their healthcare bill in secret, here are 10 things we do know:

@CFPB We need to improve the law, not turn the clock back to when Wall St was free to prey on Ohioans, wreck the economy &amp; hand taxpayers the bill
@CFPB These are the wrong priorities for Ohio. 80% of Americans believe we need tough rules and stronger penalties for Wall Street.
@CFPB And it would eliminate the @CFPB’s ability to make sure lenders are obeying the laws that protect our servicemembers.
It would dismantle the @CFPB - an institution that has returned $12 billion to 29 million Americans who’ve been ripped off.
Today, the House votes on a bill that is a massive giveaway to megabanks and payday lenders. It would undo the progress we've made.
Since then, we've put protections in place to make sure that Wall Street can never run rampant over Main Street again.
Too many seem to have amnesia about the devastation the Great Recession wreaked across the country–but most Ohioans don’t have that luxury.
In a day filled w/news, don’t ignore the House to dismantle #DoddFrank protections &amp; leave taxpayers vulnerable to another Wall St. bailout.

6. It zeros out the Appalachian Regional Commission - a slap in the face to rural Ohio.
5. It slashes nearly 70% in the public housing repair budget, which would leave more Ohioans exposed to mold, lead, &amp; other health hazards.
4. It reduces workforce training funding by 40%, &amp; eliminates the Economic Development Administration &amp; Manufacturing Extension Partnership.
3. It pulls the rug out from under our fight to combat the opioid crisis.
2. It cuts the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).
1. It ELIMINATES the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative – threatening clean water and good jobs along Lake Erie.
Budgets are about priorities. What does this budget tell us about the White House’s priorities?

The value of work is not abt the color of your skin. It’s not a blue-collar issue or a white-collar issue. It’s not liberal or conservative. https://t.co/btp7i2WLoG
We need to update our economic policies, our retirement policies, and our labor laws to reflect today’s reality.
The workforce is changing - but we cannot accept that more and more of our workers are paid less and have little economic security.
We grow the economy from the middle class out. https://t.co/su1PXI39WL
What’s that I hear from the C-suite? Don’t tell me that paying workers more costs too much, but corporate bonuses are no problem.
I’m talking about all workers - whether you punch a time sheet at factory, make a salary at a bank, or earn tips in a restaurant.
It’s not just "gig." Cutting costs at workers’ expense is not unique to app-based businesses. We need solutions for all workers.
The declining value of work is hurting our country. When hard work doesn’t pay off, our economy cannot grow.
We need to make hard work pay again. https://t.co/I81vbXFPDZ
