#Venezuela's annual inflation rate measured for today, 5/16/18, is 16,184%. https://t.co/A0daIiO02J
Pulling out of #Iran deal is not a smart move. Not only will the reimposed sanctions have no effect on the regime in Tehran, they will also hurt our allies overseas as companies like Peugeot, who sell cars in Iran, will also feel the burn.	@StephenWilmot	https://t.co/hH4LIM70el
With #Erdogan set to take over more power of the economy after next month’s election, investors should be worried. The #Lira’s plunge has no end in sight under his watchful eye. #Turkey	https://t.co/aZTOtzuBTK
As the burden of creditors weighs down on #Venezuela, Venezuelan oil production is headed in the wrong direction. Just in time for the presidential elections, it looks like #Maduro has run out of coffers to pilfer. 	@Spencerjakab	https://t.co/kwVfmrV12p

Kellogg pulls out of #Venezuela due to economic crisis. This shouldn't surprise anyone-- why conduct business in a #socialist wasteland in which private property rights are not protected?	https://t.co/8bRkevBi1a
The Venezuelan #economy is already on the verge of collapse. The remedy to the hyperinflation is #dollarization. Just like a shot in the arm, it will have an immediate positive effect on the patient.	https://t.co/RZ0aepN5YQ
Trump is putting the American economy at risk with his brash protectionist strategy. While President Trump likes to think he can manage the world economy with a big stick, #China can parry his blows and strike with their own just as easily.	@AnaSwanson	https://t.co/tecwvahGxQ
#ModernSlavery continues to grow in the UK due to lack of government attention. Human rights problems should take high priority on the UK’s docket. 	https://t.co/tONBKU62zJ
It was easy for many millennials to wish their moms a happy Mother's Day as "nearly 25%" of them still live with their parents. As @dicklepre has pointed out, this is due to a lack of housing affordability across the US. 	https://t.co/VNDPBllB1r
As #Trump withdraws from the Iran deal, China’s state-owned CNPC, the world's third largest oil company by revenues is set to push aside French giant oil co. Total.  US sanctions prove costly for US &amp; European companies. Another little “tax”. 	https://t.co/0t3iQHhL0y

Mr. Shapiro speaks the truth: capitalism has led to a creation of wealth far greater than any other economic system in the history of humanity. Free markets help everyone. @benshapiro @BernieSanders https://t.co/MsPVBLdvVO
#Venezuela’s death spiral continues to spin as #hyperinflation slashes the value of the bolivar. With prices doubling every 17.5 days, until the government dumps the #bolivar and replaces it with the greenback, things will get worse and worse.	https://t.co/8CenC7f4fm

The city of #Alexandria is set to increase taxes on restaurants in order to pay for public housing over the objections of small business owners: “We absolutely feel it’s discriminatory and unfair." I feel the same way, this is a complete abuse of power.  https://t.co/AHTEoB6zer
