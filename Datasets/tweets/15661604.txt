Trump a measured response to horrific chemical attack.  Measured response in a situation where there are no good options.  Appropriate.

Good news for Sabrina DeSousa.  Not going to Italian prison. Final details still need to be worked out. Kudos to Team trump for their help!
Day 7 in a Portuguese prison for Sabrina DeSousa. So this is what our allies do to those who protect us.
Sabrina DeSousa - her sixth day in a Portuguese jail. Not a great way for the Portuguese to welcome a new administration to D.C.
Italians and Portuguese working together to imprison former CIA officer for what Bush WH ordered to have done. Devastating to morale.
Very reassuring. CNN commentator does really believe CNN unbiased and no point of view. Now, should I feel better? Doubt it.

Paris, Belgium, etc. Why are people mad?  Because nothing changes!
Indications are now over 30 killed and more than 150 injured.  Media reporting lower numbers but expect their numbers to go up.
Arab press now reporting ISIS claiming credit for attacks.
ISIS sources tweeting and claiming credit. Europe responds. Europeans will be tired of responding, and maybe will finally become proactive.
Social media starting to show Jihadists claiming credit.
My sources tell me Belgium has been on edge for quite some time. This is not unexpected.
Look at what jihadists have done - locked down a country of 11 million.  Neighboring countries also impacted.
Time for European leaders to wake up.  Watch for a voter revolt in the coming months.
Doing WMAL at 6:05 to discuss Belgium attacks.
Paris, Brussels, scary and a sign of more things to come.

It is not first about building coalitions,it is about setting goals and objectives.Clinton was wrong on Yemen, Egypt, Libya,Syria and Iraq.
Hillary needs to come clean on who we allied with in Libya and what she did with weapons transfers to Syria from Libya!
Clinton still believes Libya is a success.  Obviously hasn't read "Architects of Disaster" yet. Can't afford many more successes like that.

My thoughts on the the vote in congress - http://t.co/CH9sa1hOhH
Release of horrific tapes of chemical attacks will have impact on debate in Congress but don't change the fundamentals of the arguement.
Thought you might want to see this. http://t.co/a2M1kPA8M2    	Will be writing more with so many things going on.
President Obama and Syria. http://t.co/fhLnM2jg5a
Headlines: Evidence is Clear on Syria Chemical attack! History teaches us the evidence is seldom crystal clear. Beware of group think.
Some thoughts on the NSA http://t.co/zMPtjUtqMi
Hiding in plain site.Benghazi,important story to tell.Disappointing no one is telling the rest of the story.Untold story is explosive.
It's all phony bluster about Russia/Snowden.Pentagon buying $500+ million in Russian helicopters.Bet deal goes through.Should be canceled.
Thanks to those who voted to keep America safe (and constitutional) by supporting the NSA. The threat is real and the tools work(and legal).
Why would U.S. be buying $500 million plus of Russian helicopters to give to Afghanistan?  It's true.
Gen Alexander doing a good job at hearing this morning. Hopefully people are watching and understand how this really works.
How does 1 contractor get all this sensitive material?  Lots of questions unanswered in this case. More to come.
Lost another tool in war on terrorists!  Leaks really do hurt our national security!
McCain trip to Syria sends very different signal that President's speech last week.
AQ has not yet conceded.  The threat from AQ is still a clear and present danger.
Won an election yesterday!Elected to Gentex Board of Directors. An exciting company.
Benghazi,IRS,and now Justice seizing AP phone records.These are the scary guys.And they thought the Tea Party was who needed to be watched.
Biggest news on Benghazi is still to come.
Check out these guys http://t.co/QyJm34M4EX   They're a great organization and could use your help. Please think about it. Pete
Attacking Victoria and whistleblowers is a really bad idea. Victoria is the best! Whistleblowers are heroes for stepping forward!
Huge day for the Dutch.  Celebrating a Queen and a new King. Congratulations to our great friends.
INITIAL reports on background of Boston terrorists raises multiple red flags of concern.
Whistleblowers with proper legal counsel provide opportunity for House Intell, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs to finally get answers.
Breaking! Multiple whistleblowers on Benghazi! Legal experts ready to help them.Agencies miss deadlines to respond to the Hill. Cover-up?
Why are agencies not allowing whistleblowers on Benghazi to get access to lawyers?  The facts may be startling! CIA, DOD, State
Whistleblowers on Benghazi.  Finally we may get to the truth.
Our prayers are w the folks in Boston. Our hearts are sad.  Let's wait and see where the facts lead us
Syria developments w alleged use of chemical weapons demonstrate how dangerous total situation in ME is.Fallout from Arab Spring continues.
Cyber op Ed.  http://t.co/fOLMoPJKCF
My take on cyber. http://t.co/szwTlSHZsD
Notice 4th proposed amendment.  Tried to fix targeting problem in 2010.  Hoekstra and Rogers had great amendments! http://t.co/IyqRwgPK
Hannity tonight at 9 pm, Discussing the use of drone strikes.
Legal authorities for targeting the killing of Americans should be shared w congress and the public by Obama Administration.
Extremists establishing a new tone and tenor to attacks.  Benghazi, Algeria, Mali, Turkey.  Lots to be worried about. Nothing surprising.
Closing Gitmo was always a bad idea.  It is good news if reports are accurate that this is no longer a priority for this administration!
Great article: http://t.co/YDbaAiHO
Obama now playing games with debt ceiling.  Says today that country will hit limit on 31st of Dec.They just figured that out w a week to go?
Obama golfing in Hawaii! Don't worry, be happy!  What fiscal cliff?  That's leadership!
Last night a bad night for Rs.  Better get their act together. Infighting vs alternative to Obama. Rs chose last night, chose badly!
Pulling Speaker bill, almost unprecedented. Real uncertainty with what happens now.
Tarver, is more than the hot dog guy in Lansing.  It is terrible what they did to him yesterday. Check it out on Fox website.
Awesome panel discussion on Tuesday. Go to: https://t.co/VECHBd2Y
http://t.co/HW4WCFNW
Feinstein still pushing closing Gitmo. Still a really bad idea.  Time to focus on important issues.
Israelis predicted this six weeks ago when I met w them in Israel. America seems surprised. How dumb can we be?
Initial reports from Patraeus hearing - "20 questions" rears it's ugly head. Ask a question and get no answer.
Don't buy it, the film was never the cause of the riots in Cairo.  Administration continues to misdirect and some buy it.
Most of the material in closed hearings could be public. Over classification a huge problem!
How can DNI and acting DCIA not know who provided talking points to Rice?After 7 weeks they don't know, didn't ask?These are Intell leaders?
Israeli's feared and predicted this when I was there this fall. It's why they questioned the Obama foreign policy.
McCain a fresh and strong voice on Benghazi.
FBI totally in the bag for Obama re election.  This is a scandal of major proportions.  They violated their own protocol with congress.
Obama will need to find new directors for the FBI and the CIA!
Obama  a lot like Bush on terror, except the media and the bureaucracy attacked Bush and are protecting Obama! The truth will come out!
The key to Patreaus?What was so important that he and the dir of the FBI would risk so much to keep it under wraps? It keeps getting worse!
I was right on Friday night, Patreaus affair would become a big deal. It will dog this President for months.  Resignations will be coming!
Rs need to do oversight aggressively. Need answers on Patreaus and Benghazi. Obama administration hid the facts until after the election.
If FBI investigation - then WH, Clapper, and congress should all have been informed. WH knew about this before Thursday!
Patreaus resignation will get worse. There's more here than meets the eye.
Huge crowds today. 2 more rallies. Exciting what is happening at grassroots!
Trumpka to blast Romney today.  He is the guy that was ready to plead the 5th in front of congress.  Consider the source!
Rally turnouts awesome, and getting bigger!  Tomorrow will be even better!  We're going to win this.
Obama/Stabenow want revenge!  Shouldn't we all want to bring America together?Help us get across the finish line.Go to http://t.co/EEbdSo6V
Good poll out this morning.  Shows what we are seeing on the ground. Gap closing. We will win this!
Jihadists take comfort from Benghazi, They see an America that can be beaten.  That's not the America I see or the military I know.
Benghazi:bottom line-total victory for radical jihadists.  They attacked, they killed, and America fled.  Is this the new America?
More leaks on Benghazi, the military and Intell pros are furious w how Obama handled the crisis and then blamed them. Expect more!
Stabenow continues to protect her friend John Corzine, led MF Global into losing a billion dollars.
Did Obama/Stabenow say no to our people in Libya when they asked for help? Obvious why she is in hiding and not taking any questions.
Another busy and good day scheduled. Great ground game in place. Exciting.
Great turnout at debate in Hillsdale.
Morris has Romney behind by only 1 point in Michigan, 45 - 44.  Means Michigan goes Romney and Hoekstra!
Debbie on global warming. 	“Global warming creates volatility. I feel it when I’m flying.” (8/11/09). More insights from senator coming.
Exciting news, getting answers on most frequently asked questions at debates.  Stabenow answer on global warming coming soon. Stay tuned.
Perfectly said: http://t.co/6RXf70fT
National debt growing $4 billion per day. This is the Obama/Stabenow America! This is not sustainable.
Disappointing that our Senator failed to pay taxes after she demands you pay more.  Now we know at least one more thing she was hiding.
http://t.co/6cNSSv8c
Romney brings it home tonight. Did very nice job in the debate.
Great day today. You can feel momentum building. Debbie not debating, people view as just arrogant.
Great read: http://t.co/vReSfiWm
Good day yesterday, Cadilac and Manistee.  Grassroots very strong.
On radio Stabenow's view of bi partisan - fewer Republicans. She's outlined why she can't get things done, she can only work with dems!
Fox News special tonight explodes Obama Administration explanation on Libya.The truth will come out with major damage to administration.
WH line on Libya falling apart.  The only question is whether the truth will come out before or after the election.
Interesting, no one willing to defend Stabenow's record.
After last nights debate Stabenow even more reluctant to debate. Watches president unable to defend record or articulate a vision.
Cleaned windows at Meijer in Kazoo. Gas prices down, frustration w energy prices is still up. People joked about Debbie afraid to debate.
If Clinton misled the President how does he hold her accountable?
Obama/Stabenow choose badly with $s borrowed from China! A123 goes bankrupt and our kids are left holding the bag. Enough is enough!
Obama and Stabenow choose badly, A123 files for bankruptcy. There go a few more 100 million of our $s. Debbie replies Don't worry, be happy!
Finally found a difference between Stabenow and Obama.  At least he tried to defend his record at a debate.
Rural health care in jeopardy under Obamacare!  Michigan's 60 plus rural counties at risk for quality health care.
Nice turnout in Alpena today for business meeting, and grassroots events.
Heard Stabenow can't make debates because she's working on budget. At that rate she would be ready to debate in 2015.
VP threw Intell professionals under the bus. The guy has no shame.
Stabenow throws in towel on debates, the budget (1250 plus days w no budget), and the farm bill. Notice a pattern?
Great turnout at the debate. Lots of people showed up. Everybody but Stabenow. What's new?
Stabenow pulls plug on debates. W record high gas prices, persistent unemployment, and trillion $ deficits, it is not a surprise.
More evidence why we need change: http://t.co/7n47I4wv
Obama policy in ME showing more cracks. It really is falling apart and America and Israel are at risk.
It is becoming clear that administration totally misled America on Libya murders.
Stabenow scared to debate. I will either debate her or an empty chair.  It is her choice.
Ryan rally tonight was awesome. Great turnout!  Lots of energy!
Stabenow admits to cutting Medicare to fund ObamaCare. Watch new our new tv ad http://t.co/IRx4bJZK
Another problem with Obamacare: http://t.co/iODZsNjd
Nice endorsement: http://t.co/A4fXHbX1
Last night was a contrast of visions.  It is why Debbie and I need to debate. There are 2 visions for America.
Mitt was very articulate and gave the best vision for bringing America back.
Obama buys Thomson prison, and we already own 4 empty prisons.  We all know who they're going to try and move there. Connect the dots!
New concern about Obama moving Gitmo detainees to prison in Illinois. If accurate, another example of this President just doesn't get it!
Obama administration not connecting the dots in the ME on threats from radical Islamists. That's dangerous.
Obama now wants you to pay legal fees for companies that break the law. He thinks he can be all three branches of government at once!
Arab Spring miscalculation leads to what is now the Arab upheaval. ME (in the ME) experts very concerned about the current situation.
Obama grasping for straws on the economy and we get caught holding the bag!
President knew the truth: http://t.co/t1chhVEj
LG Chem announcement disappointing, let's hope it works out. Government can't pick winners and losers.
President refuses to admit policies in the Middle East not working! Same thing when it comes to domestic policy!He just blames someone else.
They knew it was the video but not that it was terrorism!
What is this administration trying to hide about Libya?
Obama Administration clearly has misled America on Libyan attack.  These folks can't be trusted to fight terrorism!
Administration finally admits AQ probably tied to Libyan attack. And these guys are in charge of national security.
As more info comes out it is evident administration probably knew within 24 hours that Libyan attack was terrorist attack. Why a cover - up?
Obama reset on ME has resulted in a very dangerous environment. Movie scenario Pres spun now spinning out of control. It was wrong!
Watch our new ad on why Debbie is worst: http://t.co/FbL2Phc1
ACT high school scores show many high school graduates not college ready. Some will call for a bigger federal role. It will not work!
Obama skips meeting with world leaders.  Must be like the private sector job market, world must be doing just fine!
Gas prices back near $4 per gallon. Time for a change.
The big question "what is it that they're hiding from us about Libya and Egypt?" Their story is only beginning to unravel.  It's worse!
Geraldo calls ambassador Rice's statements on Sunday talk shows worst he ever saw. Administration leading(?)
State Dep't spends money on anti movie ads.  Obama only one still blaming movie for riots. This is our best foreign policy?
CNN will be last man standing claiming attack in Libya was because of a movie.  Embarrassing for the network and their employees.Political!
Administration finally uses "terrorist attack" to describe the murder of ambassador.Also begins to walk back spontaneous attack explanation
Friedman says what needs to be said: http://t.co/jRuXYueW
Could jailed blind sheik be part of protest rationale in Cairo? Much more plausible than movie explanation, but still not root cause.
No congressional oversight trips allowed to Afghanistan before the U.S. election?  If true, that raises lots of questions.
Great day today. Santorum very effective.  You can feel the energy building at grassroots.
My latest op ed.  http://t.co/ERNYtmTJ
Obama's denial of the roots Libyan attack displays how unwilling he is to recognize the serious threat from extremists and it is a pattern.
Mr. President: these are radical jihadists, terrorists who hate us!
WH doubles down, unrest in middle east result of obscure video. If you don't identify the problem correctly you can't fix it!
Oil hits $100 a barrel, Obama/Stabenow policies inflationary. And they're still against Keystone and more production of U.S. energy.
Clinton blaming movie, still!  Our enemies will see weakness!  It is time to be strong in the face of these threats.
Next 24 hours will be instructive, I believe it will indicate things will be uglier.  More bomb shells may be coming.
VOTE and see the results why Debbie is the Worst Senator at http://t.co/FRaI3TQs #MISen #WorstSen #GreatDebate #MIGOP
Low interest rates, inflation will hurt seniors and the middle class!
Fed action today indicates major concern about the economy.  This will be inflationary. Fed action indicates we are in trouble!
Jobs numbers disappointing again today.
Joint Chiefs Chair calling civilians in U.S. trying to influence "speech" is a demeaning action.Dempsey needs to focus on winning wars!
Join the #GreatDebate &amp; VOTE Why Debbie Stabenow is the Worst Senator at http://t.co/FRaI3TQs #MISen #WorstSen #MIGOP
In Cairo they chanted "we are all Osama"!
The attacks were terrorist attacks, successful attacks. These folks were celebrating 9/11!
Analysis on Egypt and Libya is misdirected. It's not the movie, it was 9/11. These were not spontaneous, they were planned.
President confirms death of US ambassador to Libya. It is a sad day.  Let's remember the families as they deal with this tragedy!
Let's hope that reports about additional victims in Libya are wrong.
The attacks today were premeditated and planned to embarrass the United States on 9/11!
Americans should be outraged by what happened in Egypt  and Libya today! This was our day of remembrance! An American died today. What else?
These attacks are about American values and American security. It is time to reaffirm our stand against extremists.
These attacks in Libya and Egypt were not about a movie,this was about extremists and 9/11.  They came to kill again and succeeded.
Krauthammer on Egyptian protesters:	"would have told them to go to h..."	Sharp contrast to our embassy's response!
Egyptians storm our embassy,destroy the American flag, and we apologize.  Is that who and what we have become?
Listening to 9/11 replays brings back the memories of that day, and everything that happened in the years since. Let us never forget!
A day we will never forget.  May God bless America today and every day!
Why is Debbie Stabenow the Worst Senator? Share why at http://t.co/FRaI3TQs #MISen #WorstSen #GreatDebate #MIGOP

Do today's job numbers indicate people giving up on Obama/Stabenow economy and leaving the workforce?
Debbie's campaign has questions about the auto bailout and what didn't work?  Wonder why she will ask the questions but refuses to debate?
Clinton jobs numbers last night the result of selective counting!  The guy is good but clearly his speech wasn't run by Fact Checkers.
Taxes, jobs, spending! That's the feedback at the gas pumps this morning.  After 4 years people think we should be doing better, now!
Clinton takes all the credit for his performance, the turnaround was built on R policies, reform entitlements, restrain spending, tax reform
D's change position on Jerusalem and God in their platform!  Wonder what happened?  No explanation.
After 3 1/2 years President not to prosecute CIA staff,they did what their country asked them to do.Mr. President,that's 3 1/2 years late!
"Going Dutch".  DC political correctness says phrase my be offensive. Actually DC could use a little more "Going Dutch"!
Record high gas prices for Labor Day! Stabenow policies squeeze middle class families. No surprise she will not debate.
Mitt nailed it tonight!
Great visit w Tripp's Auto Collision today.  Not yesterday's body shop. Innovative, growing business.
Awesome job by Paul Ryan!
Obama Promoting Toyota Prius today.
Higher gas prices/mortgage costs! You work harder and have less disposable income and less family time!  Exactly what has Debbie done?
Did you know-Dodd/Frank increases your mortgage costs? Thank you Debbie!?
On gas prices, we know what Debbie believes on energy independence(against it) What do you think?I am for US energy independence as our goal
Gas prices as high as high as $4.09 for regular today. Wonder if Debbie still believes drilling in ANWAR and Keystone pipeline are bad ideas
We Built it Tour continues. Lots of frustrating stories of how government stops job creation!  This hurts real people.
3 great "we did build it" examples.  From brand new to established business.  Entrepreneurial spirit alive but under stress!
High gas prices and Stabenow against more US energy production!  Need for new solutions/new ideas!
Momentum continues: http://t.co/tjHpZWhr Now please help us build more momentum by contributing at Hoekstra for Senate. Thanks.  Pete
Another poll: http://t.co/XbyhmH19   Looks good, let's keep working.
2016, the movie.  Check it out. Worth 91 minutes of your time.
Great day with Mitt, Ann, and Paul in town. Huge crowd at the farm. This is home for Mitt and Ann!
Stabenow says "let's debate in October".  Convenient, that's after people start voting!
The new Obama/Stabenow normal-CBO says 2012 deficit $1trillion plus.  4 years of trillion $ deficits. We can do better.Need new leadership.
Nice but still lots of work to do.  http://t.co/aWsaJNoh

Watching Syria!  That is where the next shoe may drop.
Middle East politics is hard but saying Syria is different than Libya because Assad is a reformer is a stretch. America needs to unite.
Pres Obama's speech needs to address more than Libya.This is the opportunity to lay out vision for the Middle East.Need to get this right.
Mission in Libya being accomplished w Gadhafi still in power will never be Mission Accomplished. Half measures now is a really bad idea.
In London. Diesel over $10 per gallon.

Just leaving traverse bay mfg.A company being hammered by federal prison industries!This is just wrong.How many more people could be working
Potential Gitmo prisoner move gets lots of attention.Obama made a hasty decision on Jan 21 to close Gitmo.Michigan shouldn't bail him out.
If press reports on moving Gitmo detainees to Mich are accurate my answer is no. I will do everything possible to stop this.
