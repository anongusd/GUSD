And what exactly is the allegation: That they participated in an unsanctioned operation that should never have taken place in the first place? Or was the operation itself sanctioned, but they erred by going behind interrogation/rendition, killing him &amp; covering it up? // (end) https://t.co/dEkS4dQAPG
5) Who are the 18 Saudis who have been detained in connection? Do they include the 15 Saudis who the Turks say were on the hit team sent to Istanbul? If so, who are the other three? https://t.co/3bKJIF0z60
4) What exactly transpired after Khashoggi entered the consulate? The Saudis claim suspects intended to have “discussions” with him about returning to KSA, but a fight ensued. The Turks claim recording proves he was killed within minutes of entering the consulate. Which is it? https://t.co/NKYHOJSmix
... Ambassador to the U.S. (and brother of MBS) Khalid bin Salman told U.S. lawmakers Khashoggi left the consulate and there was no surveillance footage because the cameras weren’t recording. Do the Saudis acknowledge lying to the Trump administration, Congress and the public? https://t.co/y6Bfa9AP4D
3) When did the Saudi government in Riyadh learn he was dead? Four days after he entered the consulate and was killed, the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and Embassy in Washington were still publicly insisting he left the consulate... https://t.co/bZkKTsJ4fg
Dumped at sea? Buried at either of the sites near Istanbul where Turkish police have been searching? Will the Saudis facilitate the transfer of his remains to his family, allow an independent autopsy, etc? https://t.co/CzwZBadcYK
2) Where is the body? The Turkish authorities have alleged Khashoggi was dismembered, and other regional diplomats have said they believe he was removed from the consulate in boxes. Was his body take out of the country on the two flights (one to Dubai, one to Cairo)? https://t.co/udLraCKnPH
... that he’s not being blamed. How is it possible that several of his top aides and intelligence officials, as acknowledged by the Saudis, planned an operation, but without his knowledge or approval? https://t.co/i9U1gkGBrI
1) What did MBS know, and when did he know it? There is no indication in any Saudi statement that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is considered responsible.

Meanwhile, US Embassy Havana remains operating with basically a skeletal staff, as outlined in new report from Congressional Research Service. Per the State Department today, visa services in Havana remain suspended https://t.co/bYfk41cjKa
In the meantime, the US continues recommending that Americans avoid the Hotel Nacional and Hotel Capri in Havana. And if you experience any "acute auditory or sensory phenomena, immediately move to another area," US guidance says https://t.co/QL4nRPGlLH
But, the official adds: "We still do not know the cause or source of the attacks.:" The investigation is continuing, the official says. https://t.co/TiTEUofGvR
What's more, a State Department official tells me that the health attacks that led to the Level 3 advisory "appear to target U.S. government personnel, occurring primarily in the residences of U.S. Embassy staff." Aka, not targeting tourists https://t.co/417YwbvSZb
What's changed to merit that? Not entirely clear. But the advisory level was scheduled to be reviewed by September 2, and reduction was made after a "thorough review." https://t.co/CswTkH3JOw
