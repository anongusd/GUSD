@LiveAction Unless of course you can’t survive unless attached to someone else’s lungs, heart, or kidney. BTW, you realize a car isn’t an embryo right?
.@RepMattGaetz .@realDonaldTrump Twitter didn’t do anything with intent. But here’s the thing - it’s a private entity. You’re on its service you don’t get 1st amendment anything. Quit your whining. #babies
We wonder who that @GOP Congressman mentioned in relation to the recent indictments is? What say you @RepMattGaetz? You seem to be very afraid of the truth coming out.
@LouDobbs @mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump Keep that thought in mind when @realDonaldTrump ignores his probably subpoena
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS They were increasing the % of GDP long before you darkened our country’s doorstep
@repgregwalden @realDonaldTrump They bled guilty you un-American jerk! Where’s the law and order? They committed arson to cover up another crime. @realDonaldTrump pardoned them to appeal to the wacko- right.
@LindseyGrahamSC But you’re sure positive that @realDonaldTrump didn’t collude with those same Russians. How’s that work🤔
@SteveKnight25 None of that is true. Nice try.
@DavidAFrench All three of you must really hate women @RichLowry @OrrinHatch
@Scavino45 @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He's leaving 2 hours early? Doesn't the limo have a GPS?
@christoq Another grifter making money in the administration of the grifter-in-chief
@tedcruz We're assuming in a plane?
@JohnCornyn Ha ha ha ha.
@cathymcmorris About $46 a week. You really need to do the basic math on this. It's crumbs. Now @cathymcmorris how much is going to the investor class and CEO's b/c of companies and their stock buy back programs - $76B or $1.4B per week. See? Basic math.
@DeanHeller So says the guy behind in the polls
@replouiegohmert Maybe because they're hiding something too?
@DeanHeller @POTUS So says the guy behind in the polls.
@SenateMajLdr Our Republican colleagues cry wolf whenever a Democrat:	Runs for president - Too liberal.	Nominates a SC justice - Too liberal	No matter their qualifications. No matter their record.  No matter their reputation. It’s the same hyperbole.  The same accusations. The same old story.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Can we ask if he/she thinks it's proper for a president under investigation to nominate a SC justice?
@TomiLahren I guess they feel the way immigrants to this country feel. Sucks huh?
@mattgaetz I'm guessing he's lying you know.  If you knew that someone was diddling young men, I don't think you forget it. And because of this, he doesn't have to prove he didn't know. He just needs to explain why he didn't do a damn thing about it. At least 5 people told him.
@JohnCornyn @politico Big deal! Your damn president should probably register
@Joeydorner1 That sounded great right up until you mentioned @tedcruz being there. Then it just became another sucky place to be.
@repgregwalden @realDonaldTrump "Striking a plea bargain, in order to have the four remaining charges dismissed and for sentences on the two convictions to run concurrently, the Hammonds waived their rights to appeal their convictions." So maybe not unfair after all.
@RepMoBrooks Hey Mo! Bonuses are not pay raises and something like $76B went to stock buy backs so CEO's and the investor class could make more money without actually working. So #TCJA kinda sucks for the average person - Not that you care or even know anyone in that category
@mattgaetz Not really. She seems like she will really work for her constituents rather than trying to get face time on TV spreading lies and protecting a con-artist president.
@LindseyGrahamSC @EPA @realDonaldTrump Gotta wonder why you didn't speak up sooner?
Someone should tell @realDonaldTrump that he can't pardon the Malaysian Prime Minister #DrainTheSwamp
@KBTXNews @tedcruz @ClayFalls We think some of the challenges that the country is facing is guys like @tedcruz
@mattgaetz Boy does that look photoshopped
@TomPerez Unfortunately Tom that argument isn't going to work. Use our talking point; that a president under investigation cannot make an appointment to the SC when that court may have to decide a case involving him.
@replouiegohmert @uscapitol Look at that picture of a whole bunch of kids way smarter than the guy leading them on the tour.  Hope he didn't get lost.
@SteveDoocy @jasoninthehouse @foxandfriends That's a lot of slackers with nothing to do. Most of go to work in the morning
@M_Singleton23 @mattgaetz Dude. It's not the guy standing next to you. That guy is too busy doing self promotio and spreading lies trying to protect an illegal president. Were you looking at someone else?
@RepRWilliams They are seeing a few dollars - like $16 on average - meanwhile the vast majority of that tax break money was used to buy back stock which puts any ral money into the hands of the investor class - NOT real workers. Nice try though
@GOP Let's fix that - Democrats’ calls to abolish ICE would mean less suffering by people fleeing death and violence from being processed by an agency following the orders of a racist.
@RepMattGaetz And yet you spend all day on TV and on Twitter trying to save @realDonaldTrump and his presidency from imploding.
@GOP Quoting an idiot is not impressive
@SenatorCollins FYI country opposes overturning R vs. W by 2:1 margin not 51% - 49%. Know your facts and vote accordingly. Remember healthcare and don't trust @SenateMajLdr
@JohnCornyn Why would he? It's been done by the crooks that gave him the list of judges.  We're not stupid - just mad.
@senorrinhatch Wasn't his son Trump's banker at some point? Didn't the WH go to him on numerous occasions to discuss the possibility of retiring - you know kinda ease him out? Every action by this president required oversight and investigation.
@DeanHeller Should a president whose campaign and highest officials are under investigation have the opportunity to select a justice that may one day determine his guilt or innocence without the people having a say?
@Sen_JoeManchin @realDonaldTrump Should a president whose campaign and highest officials are under investigation have the opportunity to select a justice that may one day determine his guilt or innocence without the people having a say? Well Senator?
@SenateMajLdr Most utility companies are regulated to not have exessive profits and therefore must return overages to the consumer.
@DeanHeller Should a president whose campaign and highest officials are under investigation have the opportunity to select a justice that may one day determine his guilt or innocence without the people having a say?
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS Should a president whose campaign and highest officials are under investigation have the opportunity to select a justice that may one day determine his guilt or innocence without the people having a say?
@DeanHeller You mean like voting to stop your party from taking healthcare from Americans?
@SenateMajLdr Should a president whose campaign and highest officials are under investigation have the opportunity to select a justice that may one day determine his guilt or innocence without the people having a say? What if the president was a Democrat? #Hypocrisy
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Here's an idea. "Should a president whose campaign and highest officials are under investigation have the opportunity to select a justice that may one day determine his guilt or innocence without the people having a say?" Easy huh? Less than 140 words
@DNC @DCCC @DSCC  So what's our plan? What's our talking points? What is your plan to stop a vote on a S.C. justice? If you don't know, why not? If you do, how come we're not hearing it 100 times a day?
@SenSchumer So what's our plan? What's our talking points? What is your plan to stop a vote on a S.C. justice? If you don't know, why not? If you do, how come we're not hearing it 100 times a day?
@NancyPelosi So what's our plan? What's our talking points? What is your plan to stop a vote on a S.C. justice? If you don't know, why not? If you do, how come we're not hearing it 100 times a day?
Uh hey @TheDemocrats we doing anything like this? How about you @DNC https://t.co/FO4DmNDiJn
@DeanHeller Should a president under investigation with less than 6 mos. to the next election be able to nominate a SC Justice? Hmmm? What would @SenateMajLdr do? Oh yeah we know. And @BarackObama wasn't even under investigation. Time to play fair right guys?
Hey @DNC here's a hint No President under investigation should be able to pick a SC judge until after the investigation. Say it! Over and over and over and over and over and over and over. @NancyPelosi @SenatorDurbin @dccc @DSC @TheDemocrats
@DevinNunes Yeah he works for Mueller
Nov. is too important for same ol' same ol' Start the fight early. Tell the people what Dems will do. It's so damn simple and you guys screw it up so often we can't believe our eyes.
Hey @DNC  @Ocasio2018BOOM! Get it that's how you win an election. Work and show up, Tell the people what you're going to do.  Now you guys should start setting the frame about Trump. You're late already. Don't think his actions do it for you.
Are you enjoying watching @Rep_Hunter lie on the Bill Mahr show as much as us?
@kimguilfoyle @FLOTUS Make sure you congratulate the Obama Admin people that published it first
@GOP So the Koch brothers gave you a bunch of money. Big deal. @GOP = #BigNovLosses
@DeanHeller Maybe you guys should have allowed some of Obama’s nominees get a vote you wouldn’t need to fill so many vacancies
@RepMattGaetz As opposed to your corporate donors that want to save millions by poisoning us?
@RepMattGaetz Did you explain to the students the difference between well run government and what you @GOP do? Probably not - don't want to make any new Democrats
@DeanHeller Isn't a #NDOA supposed to be helping the community? How is making calls for politician a community action. Really seems more selfish than anything.
@RepLeeZeldin No the government shouldn't be required to that unless of course you plan on putting away billions of dollars for unexpected events that may occur like natural disaster, or war, terrorist attack because if you don't then where is the money coming from?
@RepMattGaetz Dude! You're. Never. Gonna. Be, Speaker. Stop trying to be "the guy" It's sad. You look silly and you're not representing your district at all well. Unless you just want a job at Fox. Then you're doing great.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump You mean the dossier that was originally paid for by a republican who didn't want Trump to be elected.?  That dossier?
@SallyDo66161860 @cathymcmorris @RepByrne Uh... yeah.  We don't think you fully understand anything about the Democratic party. We're pretty sure you think you do, but no...  you do not.
@RMikeSmith2 @LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Because of 4 investigations into HRC, led by REPUBLICANS found nothing.
@cathymcmorris @RepByrne Nice message. Hope the President's biggest supports hear it and understand it. Hey David Duke what you say?
@LouDobbs @Jim_Jordan @realDonaldTrump Except HRC's attorney wasn't involved in cover ups or pay-offs. No double standard there, just fake news from you.
@RepMattGaetz You're on TV again. Go home.. Spend time with the family. Your fighting a losing battle and making yourself look foolish.  BTW - You're not going to be Speaker of the House after Ryan leaves.
@mattgaetz We're surprised you actually had time to respond to this Tweet.  Don't you have a broadcast you're supposed to be wasting tax payer dollars on? Perhaps you need to take a break to reaplly Chapstick before you go back to kissing the fat guy's ass. He's a delicate flower you know.
@MittRomney And in doing so screwed oever of everyday Americans by jacking up the defecit, giving huge tax breaks to guys like you, and not once speaking up against a President completely unfit for office. I'm not sure what art of America is going to miss that guy? Except guys like you
@RepMattGaetz @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness Don't you actually work?  Every frickin' day you're on TV spouting nonsense.  How much money do you make a year with your gov't salary? Talk about government waste!
@ChrisHayesTV We think @IronStache is an iron worker. Steel workers make steel, iron workers erect steel. Subtle difference it may seem, but not to those guys.
@archerfxx Is this available as a poster?
@SenTedCruz Victimization much?
@HouseGOP Keep spinning guys!  November is coming up fast.
@RepJasonSmith @realDonaldTrump Upholding the constitution by taking a stolen seat. He didn't his mom get in trouble during the Reagan admnistration - yeah she got cited for contempt of congress. Great lineage that one.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump @MickMulvaneyOMB Mulvaney ended a case against pay day loan company that cheated people. So really only a few "friends" will be more vibrant, prosperous, and advanced.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Last time we checked he hasn't even nominated for most of the available positions.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS So many untruths to that statement. A @GOP controlled Senate doing work? Ha!	Highly qualified? Ha! POTUS? Ha! In title only. Completely lacking the ability, the decency, the wisdom of an American President.
@WaysMeansCmte Thanks guys.  We covered this months ago. Maybe you should follow us?
@JebBush @ScottforFlorida Hasn't done a damn thing about guns. So the NRA will love him long time
@RepLipinski @ISTCoalition If only you were a Democrat instead of whatever you think yourself to be.
@HouseGOP @cathymcmorris Maybe if your party didn't push sequestration we wouldn't be here.
@RepJasonSmith And what would you call him today... radical, socialist, racist. The things he fought for your party would never vote for
@sendavidperdue Except there was no caravan - .@realDonaldTrump made that up.
@replouiegohmert @realDonaldTrump Hey mushbrains - two words - posse comitatus. The military can't do a damn thing at the border except make phone calls to border security
@RepRohrabacher And what would you call him today... radical, socialist, racist. The things he fought for your party would never vote for
@SenDeanHeller And what would you call him today... radical, socialist, racist. The things he fought for your party would never vote for
@RepMoBrooks @realDonaldTrump Apparently you don’t know what posse comitatus is either. Military can’t be used for law enforcement on US soil.
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS Apparently you don’t know what posse comitatus is either. Military can’t be used for law enforcement on US soil.
@SpeakerRyan And if those civil rights bills came to the floor today, your party would never vote for them. Don’t pretend to be something you aren’t.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump "Never happened before" Ha!  How about two years ago? If lying is all you got, one term is all you'll get!
@marcorubio Using your official account to quote scripture seems to violate the 1st amendment, by endorsing a specific religion.  Use your own account and do it right
@marcorubio Does tweeting biblical quotes on your official Senate account amount to endorsing religion but a specific religion #ACLU #Freedomofandfromreligion
@SpeakerRyan @SamsPressShop "Now excuse me while I take away your healthcare coverage."
@RepMattGaetz A roomful of old white guys.  Can't beat that for a wide range of opinions
@RepHartzler @HouseGOP And he created the largest deficit in history. So there's that
@RepMarkMeadows Hey Knucklehead - The FBI was reporting to the sitting President about possible interference in the election from a foreign state and who might have been involved.  You know doing its job.
@DeanHeller But we bet you'll allow .@realDonaldTrump to privatise the VA to help his cronies out.
@Dlw20161950 Did you guys also discuss why Ted Cruz is despised by those in his own party?
@RoyBlunt Don't your party's tax cuts also affect this agency?
@TeamDean @DeanHeller That's the thing - Brag about actually doing what you're supposed to do. If you weren't so busy harping bogus claims about the TCJA, maybe you'd have time to continue to di your actual job.
@RepMattGaetz Did you actually serve in the military or are you just using the background of West Point in your photo op?
@RepShimkus Using your official account to endorse religion is wrong
@mitchellvii Actually we can understand it. It is because of hypocrisy. We know if a Democrat's behavior was as disgusting as .@realDonaldTrump the evangelicals would be building crosses. They are mixing politics and religion. Just like the Ayatollahs. #wegetit
@SteveScalise Is it just us or does this young man looked creeped out by Scalise holding him #creepyuncle
@DeanHeller Deporting them is what created MS-13 in the first place. Incarceration is really a better method
@SteveKingIA Because they’re old enough to fight for this country.
@RepKihuen As an elected public servant aren't you in fact endorsing a specific religion by tweeting on your OFFICIAL Twitter account?
@RepShimkus As an elected public servant aren't you in fact endorsing a specific religion by tweeting on your OFFICIAL Twitter account?
@senrobportman @POTUS 50-50 he signs it. Melania is getting a bit long in the tooth for the HEAD of the.@GOP. He's gonna need a new wife soon
@DevinNunes @ByronYork Washington Examiner- the paper that stupid people turn to for there news - right after Fox
@GOP Remember how you guys delayed EVERY Obama court nominee? Karma’s a bitch. BTW we really loved that one guy who never tried a case yet @realDonaldTrump thought he deserved a lifetime appt. He knows the best people!
@jasoninthehouse Because it’s a load of BS
@SteveKingIA You are a racist and a liar. ACORN video was a fake - a proven fake - and you still bring it up. If you want to know why younger people are turning away in record numbers from your morally corrupt party you in the mirror and across the room at the next caucus lunch.
@NRSC Not even dogs like this guy.  They'e CGI!
@realDonaldTrump Since you don't understand how the House works - the majority can't do a thing unless the majority allows it. No DACA is a result of YOUR party.	Why do you lie? Why do arrogantly believe that you are qualified? #Putz
@DeanHeller @ericgarcetti California the world's 6th largest economy? How is that a bad thing? Your myopia is getting worse.
@DeanHeller And give the uber wealthy 30X more than what the average American get, drives up the deficit, and crashes the economy when it can't handle your party's mismanagemnt. You're a shameful lot
@RepClayHiggins And the TCJA added $1.5T to the debt. Don't even try to act like you care about spending.  You run up the debt and as soon as @TheDemocrats get into the WH you starting moaning about the debt and the need to cut SS. You guys are such hypocrites
@freedomcaucus @Jim_Jordan Not to put too fine a point of this, but you guys voted for a tax cut that added $1.5T to the debt. We're thinking your standing on this is somewhat diminished.
@RepKinzinger The President’s budget is extremely harmful to our children b/c it includes cuts to before &amp; after-school programs and summer school programs for nearly 2M students across our country. So happy #WorldDownSyndromeDay to you
@SenateMajLdr Exactly what regulations hurt farming communities? Or coal?  Why do you persist in being dishonest with the American people?  What held the economy back was @GOP obstruction during the @BarackObama administration - simple as that
@SenateMajLdr No not really.  Why would a wealthy guy that just received a windfall he didn't need just go ahead and start a business.  He already has the extra money. If he wanted to start a business he'd get a loan and risk someone else's money. This is business 101
@RepAndyHarrisMD WOW! Just like every other American. Going to work in bad weather and they don't brag on twitter about it.
@JimInhofe @JonScottFNC @HappeningNow Apparently you forgot that the @GOP pushed for the sequester during the Obama administration. You have no one to blame but yourselves #CantGovernShouldntGovern
@SteveKingIA @benshapiro Dumb and Dumber 2
@replouiegohmert @benshapiro Dumb and Dumber.
@RepJeffDuncan You know they don't use that money to perform abortions - Hyde Amendment &amp; all - They do however provide women's healthcare &amp; reproductive services to women who might not be able to go elsewhere because of cost. If you were honest about the issue you wouldn't tweet such nonsense
@SteveKornacki Thank G-d! The guy got his seat because his father gave it to him when he retired. He is a poor excuse for a D. Didn't even support his own party's nominee for President. Good riddance.
@senorrinhatch @SenateGOP The ill gotten gains of cheaters. #shameful
@replouiegohmert @DailyCaller Hey doofus- science is something that can be observed and in order to be accepted must be replicated by others.
Between .@DeanHeller and .@RepMattGaetz it’s hard to determine who tweets more. Or for that matter who does less work? How much do you guys get paid per year?
@SenateMajLdr Don’t forget to mention the sequester your party put in place that lead to this need to increase service person pay
@RepMattGaetz Nothing you just said is true.
@RepMattGaetz I believe Mueller is looking into Russia’s involvement in the election. Oh and the cover-up by @realDonaldTrump, the @GOP, and apparently @DevinNunes. Oh and Jared.	You really need to stop making stuff up.
@newtgingrich @jasoninthehouse What happened is your party told a lie and spread it through the propaganda mill and boom! It’s a thing. Protecting this President at the expense of our democracy is what makes your party unfit to govern
@FoxNews @jasoninthehouse @DevinNunes And that didn’t happen.
@SpeakerRyan @TeamUSA So says the leader of the party hat wants to end ADA
@SteveKingIA Glad they had a CHOICE
@RepMattGaetz Judicial watch isn't a body that has standing. It's a right wing hack organization.
@FoxBusiness @RepMattGaetz @mattgaetz You just lied on national TV.
@RepMattGaetz Nope. You're still lying.
@replouiegohmert You strangely look so at home with a bunch of playhouses.
@RepMattGaetz The report hasn't come out yet.
@SpeakerRyan You're right .@SpeakerRyan. If only there was someway to pay for this. Wait! Make the richest 1% pay it's fair share. #RepealTheTCJA
@RepMattGaetz @FBI Stop spreading lies.
@SenCapito @POTUS Death penalty is comprehensive all right.
@DeanHeller @mike_pence Is his wife going to br there? If not, then he can't be in the presence of another woman - so tell the ladies to stay home. Hey, his rule not ours.
@RepJimRenacci @washingtonpost No it's not funny. It's what happens when you stand up for everyday Americans in an effort to prevent an economic meltdown like the last time the .@GOP crashed the economy.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Didn't you forget he wants to kill people too?
@GOPLeader @POTUS So who do you want to kill to solve the opioid epidemic?
@LindseyGrahamSC It probably helped to that he had 3M illegal immigrant votes.
@DeanHeller @RosenforNevada That comes out to about $40 bucks a week. So yeah it's pretty much crumbs when the richest 1% would get 30X that or $1200 a week. No matter how much lipstick you put on it, this thing is still a pig.
@DeanHeller Funny a guy from the party that wants to privatize veterans' healthcare would attempt to talk about helping vets #DishonorableHeller
The refusal of the .@GOP to put a limit on .@realDonaldTrump shows that even his distructive influence on the very fabric and institutions of our democracy is fair game when trying to advance its radical agenda
@LeadStrategies @DeanHeller @NVGOP You're in a room that 's what 20x20?  It's going to look crowded with 30 people. Not a big deal. Not really a thing.
@IWF Apparently there are no women that are @TheDemocrats .
@WhiteHouse Why does the military need money? Oh that's right, the sequester put in by @GOP during the Obama administration.
@SteveKingIA @larry_kudlow A picture of two individuals wholly unqualified to hold their respective positions.
@PoliticusSarah @Barry4USSenate @politicususa Nothing to see here. Move along. Nothing to see.
@RepTedBudd @realDonaldTrump Yeah why create good paying infrastructure jobs that would help people and help the economy. That's so good government and we're @GOP  and we suck at governing.
@MarkWarner So your brilliant idea is to go back to a time before those regs. were put in place? What happened before those regs? Oh yeah massive collapse that lead to needing regs. How do you call this governing? Malfeasance is a better word.
@SenThadCochran So your brilliant idea is to go back to a time before those regs. were put in place? What happened before those regs? Oh yeah massive collapse that lead to needing regs. How do you call this governing? Malfeasance is a better word.
@JimInhofe So your brilliant idea is to go back to a time before those regs. were put in place? What happened before those regs? Oh yeah massive collapse that lead to needing regs. How do you call this governing? Malfeasance is a better word.
@SenJackReed Thank you for getting it right. Should have said something to @SenGillibrand. Oh wait she got tons of money from the banking no lobby - words wouldn't have been enough
@LindseyGrahamSC So your brilliant idea is to go back to a time before those regs. were put in place? What happened before those regs? Oh yeah massive collapse that lead to needing regs. How do you call this governing? Malfeasance is a better word.
@SenGillibrand Um, no. You voted to help bank lobbyists. Don't know if you'll get a challenger next time - but you should. That wasn't a pro people vote, it was pro bank. And if it leads to another financial collapse, the voters will know where to look.
@SBGC2C @RepMattGaetz @weartv Brown nose
@RepMattGaetz There's no need for a special counsel since none of what you're ranting about actually happened. #Hack
@SenateMajLdr Uh you know there's like 350M people of n this country. So you're basically admitting that only 1% of the people are seeing any real benefit. There's that pesky 1% number coming back
@LindseyGrahamSC @larry_kudlow It's unfortunate that he doesn't actually have a degree in economics,  it he still believes in trickle down economics. What's the over/under on months until economic meltdown occurs with this guy in charge?
@DeanHeller Thanks to @BarackObama, @GOP has something to brag about
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Imagine how much greater the Marines would be if you had only served.
@replouiegohmert @awakeamerica You mean the forefathers that encoded into our constitution that we are a nation of laws by the people and not by religious zealots?  Hey aren't you the guy that was voted dumbest Representative by Congressional staffers once?
@lisamurkowski Did you forget the ACA says 80% of premiums must go to patient care? How much of what they're giving back are they required to do so by law?
@LouDobbs @RepMattGaetz @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump Lou - you're off your med's again
@DeanHeller @NancyPelosi Probably b/c 30X more goes to the top 1% rather than everyone else. No matter how much you spin it, it's nothing more than a huge tax break for those that don't need it. BTW, how come avg. wages are only up $.04 per hour?
@ElliotMalin @DeanHeller Hey Eliot you need to get laid more
@GOP Trump said it because he doesn’t understand the lottery system. Apparently neither do you.
@GOP @Saccone4PA18 You’re quoting the Washington Times. WOW! You guys really are desperate to save that loser’s seat
@SenateMajLdr What the @GOP did wasn’t tax reform it was a huge and out to the rich at the expense of everyone else. And you know this.
@LindseyGrahamSC You’re apparently not thinking very hard.
@SenateMajLdr 30X more goes to the wealthiest 1% - that’s the point we’re making. You belong on a TV commercial. You know the one. The one with all the liars. @ATT
@GOP @GOPChairwoman That's politics. Now how about a President that still hasn't enacted sanctions authorized by Congress against a country that attacked our electoral process? Politics or treason?
@mfreckletonGOP @GOP @Saccone4PA18 @realDonaldTrump @JonStaab @PAGOP @payrs Keep dreamin dude
@SecretaryPerry @GOP @WhiteHouse @POTUS What two things aren't like the others?
At some point after embarassing yourself in front of the nation (at least twice) wouldn't you resign? What defect is Betsy DeVos suffering from?
After watching Sec. of Education Betsy DeVos struggle to answer fairly basic questions on school performance on 60 Minutes you have to wonder - If .@realDonaldTrump knows the best people, how bad are the worst people.
@FoxNewsInsider @jasoninthehouse @realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst You really think the 3 illegal immigrants that took the chance of being caught to get paltry welfare payments rather then getting a job will pay for the wall? Nope no propaganda here, Nope.
@SenateMajLdr Uh yeah.  You really should how a fully tax deductible grant is somehow tied to tax reform.
@SteveKingIA Man you're such a loon.
@SenateMajLdr @MikeCrapo But redlining is still redlining and this bill brings it back. Nice. You must be very proud.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump If by committed you mean won't accept responsibility, then yeah.
@HouseGOP @XcelEnergyMN Aren’t most utility cos. regulated and prevented from from exceeding a certain profit level? They had to give money back - TCJA didn’t make them share the money
Read this.  If you ever wanted a clear understanding of what the hell is going on. https://t.co/EhdtSSmeVA
@GOP @realDonaldTrump He hasn't even nominated half of his nominees! He's too busy playing golf and costing American taxpayers nearly $60M doing so.
@SenMikeLee Did you include taking away the rights of gay people?
@GOPChairwoman @GOP Seriously!?! Have you seen your own party’s supporters? Billy Graham - anti-Semite. Seb Gorka - anti-Semite. David Duke - anti-Semite. Fix that!
@RepMattGaetz And yet wages are barely keeping up with inflation. Average wage increase- 4 cents a hour.
@DeanHeller The rich get 30X more from the tax cuts than everyone else. Try as you like you can’t put lipstick on that pig of a bill. BTW looks like you’re gonna loss your seat huh?
@DeanHeller Hey Dummy!  The govt. would've paid for it. Did you not understand how the ACA worked? Without individual mandate, everyone's premiums went up FASTER. So, thanks for nothing. Big dummy.
@SenateMajLdr Um, I think they voted against the huge tax breaks going to an already wealthy 1%. In all seriousness, why are you such a tool?
@GOP But plenty of proof of obstruction and money laundering #November!
@GOP Getting what?  That they'll regain control of the house in Nov.? Um... yeah.	The fact that the Russians interfered w/ the election and YOUR president does nothing is a special type of treason. Sort of like Nixon and his secret meetings with the North Vietnamese to prolong the war
@RepMattGaetz For crying out loud are you still pushing this crap? What are you going to do when your party loses the majority in November? Demand investigations into how the Russians helped the @TheDemocrats ?
@DeanHeller You mean that during President @BarackObama's 2 terms, your party obstructed at a level never seen before, preventing wages from rising and delaying the recovery that led to a strong economy that @realDonaldTrump inherited. That's what you really meant
@RepMattGaetz Why are you still up? Don't you have to rest up so you have plenty of energy to push dodgy theories abut the FBI?
@DevinNunes @TuckerCarlson And I replied, "Oh so cute and just like your mother. See I get paid by people's tax dollars, but I really represent big money interests and shape laws for their benefit and that really hurt everyone else."	My daughter: "Why are you such a dick?"
@davidcicilline @realDonaldTrump Did you mention that 30X more of tax breaks go to the wealthy?
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Hahahahahaha. Full backing - #Mr. 35%!
@senorrinhatch Yeah we’re buying the whole I was just joking thing.
@RepLeeZeldin @jeffsessions @RepMarkMeadows @RepRooney @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz @RepTedBudd Clinton PROBES ended b/c they found NOTHING. Russia probe began b/c your guy’s team colluded and lied abt it. Want another S.C. Get one Nunes’ actions
@SenateMajLdr Corrected it for you: I’m glad that Congress could honor the great anti-Semitic Rev. Graham in this way. Yesterday, thousands of Americans visited the Rotunda to pay their respects. #Nixon&amp;Graham
@LindseyGrahamSC Unless the President’s skin color isn’t white - then no Supreme Court nominee for you.
@SenatorTimScott Says a guy from the party that prevented a President from filling a Supreme Court seat.
@SenateMajLdr @POTUS We voted against it because 30x more benefits went to the wealthy
We know that .@realDonaldTrump gets a security clearance b/c he’s President but don’t you kinda fell he should still get cleared by somebody at the FBI? #JaredKushner what do you think?
@USBornAndBred @RepRohrabacher @KevinNR My actual reason for bringing it up is to remind the Representative that while business men like Musk create things - products and jobs - there is a significant infrastructure in place for them to exploit (in the + sense).
@USBornAndBred @RepRohrabacher @KevinNR Good to know but SpaceX is a renter, and the US taxpayer did build it. I doubt SpaceX lease covers the sunk development and building cost, so he got a nice bump.
@HouseGOP And put it all on a credit card so your donors wouldn't have to pay for it. Now you'll try to gut social spending. #2SantaClausTheory #spendandbankrupt
.@realDonaldTrump so where you gonna get all that money for infrastructure? #spendandbankrupt to keep that promise.
@TheDemocrats One more - keep your G-d out of our kid's classrooms
@RepRohrabacher @KevinNR Did SpaceX pay to use the launch pad? If not, then private enterprise got a freebie from the tax payer. So Elon Musk didn't do it all himself. Did Falcon heavy get built there or did it's part get transported over tax payer funded roads?
@WhiteHouse Because of President Trump, the wealthiest Americans will benefit from the 8th biggest tax cuts in history. The rest of us will pay off the $1.5T deficit they create. #spendandbankrupt #2SantaClausTheory
@RepJimRenacci Didn't you vote yes on TCJA? That increases the deficit a minimum of $1.5T. So where exactly is your fiscal responsibility? #spendandbankrupt #2SantaClausTheory
@HouseGOP Right! And don't forget to add the $1.5T increase ......	in the deficit. #spendandbankrupt #2SantaClausTheory
@replouiegohmert We'd like to see the original version you wrote. The one in crayon.
@SenThomTillis Apparently you've forgotten that the withdrawal date was set by the Bush administration. The same administration that started a war against a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. #Truth hurts #GOP lies
@HouseGOP And you ballooned the deficit another $1.5T. #2SantaClausTheory #spendandbankrupt
@SenToomey So here's an idea - make corporations and the top 1% pay their FAIR share. The programs you want to cut are programs that the PEOPLE want and need. #spendandbankrupt is the @GOP way.
@RodneyDavis Talk to @SenatorRandPaul
@RandPaul Then make the wealthy and corporations pay their FAIR share #Done
@RandPaul And yet you voted for TCJA that increases deficit $1.5T. Hypocrite much?
@realDonaldTrump You apparently do not understand how the visa lottery works and the vetting that is used. Do your job, get informed then make statements. BTW nice job with the market 📉
.@HardballChris .@Eugene_Robinson Why?	@GOP deficits = 2 Santa Claus Theory That's why.	#spendandbankrupt
$20B in infrastructure spending? ASE says we need $4.5T.
@SteveScalise A $250 bonus for an hourly worker. That IS crumbs.
@LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump How about instead of a parade we provide complete medical coverage for our heroes that return home severely wounded. Or laws that prevent deceptive financial practices against them. Or help with PTSD. Or helping those that are homeless. Or addicted. That's what true honoring is.
.@SteveKornacki the answer as to why @GOP seems to not care abt deficit can be found in 2 Santa Claus theory. Look up Jude Wanniski - he's dead, but the theory is still implemented. #spendandbankrupt

Hey @GOP get ready for a boat load of truth. Trump promised $1 trillion for infrastructure, but the estimated need is $4.5 trillion https://t.co/8K5fDie6Fi
@HouseGOP @POTUS How about how come the sanctions against Russia haven't been put into place?
@SenMikeLee Can you explain why you feel the need to get into the uteri of the woman of this country? I doubt many are interested in any part of your reproductive system.

Okay @TheDemocrats @DNC let's get back to work. Start framing the issues for Nov. Ready, Set, Go!	Guys?	Guys?
If anyone believes @SenateMajLdr promise that he'll bring #DACA to a vote:	He lied OR	It'll come to a vote after he's whipped the majority to vote no on anything that would benefit those kids.	Sorry to say @TheDemocrats you screwed the pooch.  This why the Helpline is here
@jasoninthehouse Jeez, you're a putz.
@senorrinhatch If your home town paper called you a self-serving political hack why should anyone believe this tweet is anything more than that? #DoYourJob
@LindseyGrahamSC So Stephen Miiler approved this?
@RepDaveJoyce And yet when your @SenateMajLdr had the chance to pay the military, he blocked @clairecmc proposal. #NoHelp
@RepMattGaetz @BreitbartNews The memo edited by a partisan group or the truth will shock? #partiasnpolitics #politicalhack
@SenateMajLdr And yet when @clairecmc proposed paying the troops you blocked. You had yes, but said no all for POLITICAL THEATER. #GOPshutdown #DoYourJob
@GOP Project much?
@SenateMajLdr @RepKevinBrady @realDonaldTrump "His" way is supported by a majority of the American people. That's called being responsive to the people. You sir, are being responsive to....? A President that can't make up his mind. You blocked funding for the troops and continue to NOT except your responsibility to govern
@GOP Troops could have had "our" support except @SenateMajLdr blocked the @clairecmc proposal. The @GOP lies while government servies die
@NRSC Your Twitter handle say it all. MAJORITY. You guys just can't govern. Whether it's @realDonaldTrump backtracking on agreements or using #DACA for political gamesmanship, and now just out right lying to the American people you're failing to govern
@jasoninthehouse I see now why you left Congress. So you could earn more while lying just the same. Your President walked away from at least 2, that the public knows about. agreements.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump We figured out why you messed it up. Seems like most of the @GOP is tweeting rather than governing. You have the majority. MAJORITY. Restore #DACA everyone goes home. Why is something so simple so hard to grasp? Gerrymandering doesn't make you smart
As another day starts we are once again reminded that @GOP can't govern and only holds power b/c of gerrymandering and voter suppression #IsItNovemberYet #GOPShutDown
@GOPChairwoman @GOP Yes let's:	1 incompetent President makes 1 agreement minus 1 unelected official in WH saying no minus a majority party that can't whip enough votes = 0.  We know it's new math, so we understand if you don't get it.
@realDonaldTrump Chutzpah.

@SpeakerRyan @CongCulberson Make no mistake about it → @GOP are the only ones standing in the way of a fully funded government and a reauthorized health insurance program for children because the @SenateGOP can't whip its own caucus. They have the majority after all.
The real issue is .@realDonaldTrump's lack of leadership is leading to a #RepublicanShutDown and the @GOP is trying to cover for his ineptitude.
@washingtonpost @GOP Wow this kinda hurts huh? Keep trying guys. The American people know who's in the majority and who's really responsible. #DACA is supported by most Americans including Rep's. Pass it now and everyone is happy.
@RepKevinBrady @GOP needs to show proof that this actually ever happened. Only intended to rile up the base for today's march
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems If majority @GOP shut down the government, our troops will not get paid &amp; #vets will lose too. Too many vets, service members &amp; their families are already living paycheck to paycheck. Being unable to whip your own caucus is indefensible &amp; politics at its worst. #RepublicanReplay
@SenDeanHeller @SenateDems #CHIP serves as a lifeline for thousands of children in #Nevada. If @GOP had renewed it before it expired instead of choosing partisanship over continued health care coverage for America’s vulnerable kids and their families we wouldn't be here
@RepBillJohnson If Senate Republicans fail in whipping their own caucus resulting in shutting down the government, 9 million children will lose access to their health care, and over 2 million military members will not be paid - all because of @realDonaldTrump ended the EO on #DACA
@SpeakerRyan The Senate were your party holds the majority? #Whosefaultisthat ?
@LamarSmithTX21 Have yet to see proof that this has ever happened. Only intent is to rile up base. See you in November
@senrobportman Your party could have passed #CHIP long ago but didn't. You held it just for this reason. You haven't been able to pass a budget yet. And somehow this is the Dem's fault? #GetSerious #GettoWork #RepublicanReplay of a #RepublicanShutDown
@RepJimRenacci Still waiting for someone to show when this has ever happened.
@RepMcKinley Has this ever happened?  Provide the proof!
@GOPLeader Name one instance where this has happened. Just like #partialbirth, its just a made up thing.
@SenThomTillis #CHIP expired how long ago? The majority R's could have funded it months ago but didn't. You have the majority. Use it. Don't blame your inability to govern on the Dems. #RepublicanReplay of the #RepublicanShutDown.
@RepJasonSmith How many of those have or have announced lay-offs. You can’t take credit for the good without acknowledging the bad. Walmart bonus up to $1000 for 20 years work. $50 per year #lame. How much money did they save from the layoffs? That’s where raises &amp; bonuses came from not TCJA
@VP @WhiteHouse @March_for_Life Guess you'll have plenty of room to move around since @realDonaldTrump will be out of town yet again

@SpeakerRyan How do military accidents relate to what you're talking about? Isn't our military budget bigger than all nations combined? If we need more money ask the Kochs - they just won't be able to pay you as much, or you'll need to be bought off more cheaply.

What if a doctor is the only one available to save a woman’s life by aborting the fetus? So both should die? What if that MD’s “religious” beliefs precluded working on Jews? Acceptable?
@s_shelagh @FoxNewsResearch Actually they don’t need to go away - they have the right to stay engaged, or not, as you or I. Their platform is certainly bigger, but they have every right. I’m not sure who they “destroyed”. Please enlighten.
@FoxNewsResearch For Christ sakes. The man has been out of office for 16 years and you guys still use him to deflect from the problems the R's. This right here is #FakeNews
@jasoninthehouse This is nothing more than an attempt to add a bunch of Republican seats. Look you want people to vote for your party - then work for the people, not the uber rich or corps. Stop gerrymandering and present solutions that people will support. If you're good you don't have to cheat
@RepMattGaetz That was a complete lie. D’s didn’t pay Russians anything. You don’t get to decide when Mueller’s work is done because it’s inconvenient for you or your party. By your logic, a murder investigation should end b/c the investigation has taken enough time. #PartisanHack
@FAIRImmigration As a reminder no terrorists have come into the country illegally. They either been here on visas or where American citizens.
@JimInhofe @EPA @EPAScottPruitt Look I realize you are a climate denier, but the Clean Power Plan doesn’t hurt jobs. Lack of demand hurts jobs. The demand for power only increases over time = more jobs. Simple huh?
@SpeakerRyan Unfortunately the energy of which you speak is destroying the environment. Fossil fuels are bad business. How much money is spent by taxpayers for subsidies to fossil fuel producers?
@SBALinda @IvankaTrump @SecElaineChao @WhiteHouse @PressSec Would that include a tax bill that continues to incentivize moving jobs off shore? 'Cause you guys did that you know. You're aware of that right? I mean you have knowledge of what the TCJA means for SB's? You read it right? Part of your job?
@TheDemocrats We've been saying this for days. Why haven't D's been saying this all over media? Follow us. We know what we're doing. Start framing the debate now do it's fully into the public conscience by Nov. That's how you win an election
@RepHartzler @POTUS Clearly there are some in this country that have no idea that freedom of religion also implies freedom from religion. If you perform any service that is open to the general public and licensed by the state you cannot discriminate for ANY reason.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump With all due respect, 90 districts is not enough.  There should be a Democratic candidate for every district.  50 state strategy!
@WhiteHouse Is this the country where they kill people with boiling oil?
@SpeakerRyan Boeing, AT&amp;T and Walmart have had major layoffs.  The AT&amp;T bonus was already negotiated with the union and had nothing to do with the TCJA. You can't claim credit for something that doesn't actually exist. #StoptheLies
@SpeakerRyan Funny you didn't post this on your Twitter feed. https://t.co/F7pTBqdgDo
@senrobportman @BrunsGeneral I'm going out on a limb here and say that, that upgraded is going to reduce employees. But hey, keep us posted.
@dcexaminer @PRyan Awesome! For a country that has only like 165 companies that's really, really good. Now how many companies are there in the US? 200? 2,000? 20,000? More?
@SpeakerRyan And yet, you belong to a party that continues to find new ways to undermine the effort, to block the vote of those who most desperately need it, and that continues to engage in the politics of denying economic opportunities to people because of skin color. #Shame

@TomPerez Uh, still waiting for what D's will be running on this November. Anti-Trump is not enough. The message must be repeated over and over. WE must frame the debate. Make R's explain and defend within that frame. Anything less is allowing the opportunity for the R's to retain power.

@SenGillibrand Here’s an idea - A TVA/Rural electrification type program for P.R. using renewable energy generation. Follow the German model for solar panels on homes. Low interest loans with excess energy buy back.
And Hitler finds fourth for bridge:	Edgar Ray Killen, Mississippi Klansman convicted in 1964 civil rights killings, dies at 92
@SenTedCruz And even more ominously, .@realDonaldTrump continues his relentless progress towards preventing the US from maintaining a level of moral authority in the world. We cannot allow that to happen.
@SenTedCruz We must prevent a nuclear-armed loon and stand with the American people. I can do this all day.
@RepJasonLewis Walmart just laid off 5,000. Name one regulation that is harmful to business in this country
@PRyan It said when the leaders in the Republican Party will not distance themselves - at a minimum - from the ugly comments .@realDonaldTrump. Republicans have a lack of respect for the economics of the typical American and their forefathers. #GoodRiddance2018
@SenWarren Here's what we said earlier today https://t.co/ZhUWVG4ral
Running this Nov? Propose a TVA/Rural Electrification  type program for P.R. - A good progressive approach to help our fellow Americans that no R will ever come up with
@SpeakerRyan Walmart just laid off like 5K workers why isn’t that included in your tweet #FullTruth
When @realDonaldTrump used the phrase "shithole counties" the world didn't say DT is a horse's ass it said America, "We hate you!" Can't wait until the US needs the help of those counties in the future. #SmoothMoveExLax
@realDonaldTrump Oh look another lie. Obama didn't sell the old embassy. The State Dept. did in order to raise funds for a new embassy to meet the current needs of its mission. You didn't go to G.B. because they would have called you a wanker and bruised you very weak and sad ego.  #LiarInChief
@realDonaldTrump Two lies in this statement; Dem's are not intent with any of that. Your duty is to uphold the Constitution. Racist ending; Merit is another way of saying white people only. #LiarInChief #Racist
@realDonaldTrump So there are two lies in that statement; nothing remotely illegal and she never claimed to have a cold. #LiarInChief
@stevenmnuchin1 What exactly the amount? $10 or even $100 a month is nothing. And the debt goes up $1.5T. Keep the cash the country needs it more. #FakeGOPAccoumting
@TomPerez @DNC 2018 is here. Where is the statement of what D's intend to run on? Running as anti-Trump is not enough. Frame the issue early. Make R's go on the defensive. We have a great chance in Nov. Don't mess it up by ignoring fundamentals. The DNC Helpline is here to help.
@SenDeanHeller @southpointlv On average less than $500 each. And that's doubled!?!
@SenDeanHeller @WellsFargo So 75% of Wells Fargo employees are at min. wage? How much is that at WF? How much is the raise. Words without numbers don't mean squat in this conversation. Just another failed attempt to make a #CorporateGiveAway tax plan smell better.
@SenDeanHeller @SouthwestAir Do you not understand the difference between a bonus and a raise?
@RealSheriffJoe if you show the people of AZ the forged birth certificate I guarantee you'll be next senator. 	But you won't.	Because you can't.	That makes you a liar.	Oh. And a felon.	And a racist.
@VP In otherwords "We'll be maintaining Obama policy"
@realDonaldTrump You do realize that is a foreign owned company with profits going overseas? And that this foreign owned company competes directly with our own US companies?
@SenThomTillis Here's a list for YOU. Seems like most of these rollbacks are gifts to corporate greed and would hurt the average person - like your constituents. 60 Environmental Rules on the Way Out Under Trump https://t.co/HE1HnsLxNS
@SenThomTillis Still waiting for that list of those harmful regulations that @POTUS overturned. I don't think that it's that long is it?
A BONUS not a RAISE. When was it scheduled? Will you also take credit if they off workers as others have after giving them a "bonus"? How much money do they get year after year from the ridiculous tax break - that those same workers won't get. #Fakery https://t.co/Zz4aSIO0ik
When you do something too fast just to have a "WIN" - Trump administration opts for speed over accuracy in implementing new tax law https://t.co/3gLcVMz0xP
@RealJamesWoods And then the guy on the right got laid-off

@LindseyGrahamSC You are of course referring to the dossier started by a Republic can supporter and later picked up by a D law firm as op research - all legal. There covered. Now about Russia’s involvement in our electoral process. Stop hiding the truth
@LindseyGrahamSC You’ve already had 4 investigations into HRC - so this would a distraction from getting to the bottom of the true issue of Russia’s meddling in our elwctions
@SenThomTillis @POTUS Let’s get a list of harmful regulations that POTUS get rid of - I’ll wait
@TomPerez shouldn’t you and the @DNC be asking @ChuckGrassley and @LindseyGrahamSC to public ally explain why they referred Steele for criminal investigation when the transcript clearly shows no reason #TheRighttoKnow
Before R’s can investigate the FBI how about they produce a report for the American people outlining exactly how and what the Russians did to our elections. #partyovercountry
If you're running for office this year DO NOT bash Trump the person. Instead tell the voters why his and R's policies hurt them and then proudly present the progressive plan.
@DNC have you found a candidate for each and every House seat? If not, why not? #50state a proven winner. R's expending resources at every turn have less to spend on misleading the American people. Let them do the work for us.
Now that @SenFeinstein has released Simpson testimony on the dossier @TomPerez needs to get an editorial out letting the US people know that #Grassley decided party is more important than truth.
DNC Helpline is now open at @DNCHelpline
Idea to run on: Power all public buildings (schools, govt., libraries, hospitals, etc) with renewables. Jump start numerous industries, reduce fossil fuel usage, put people to work. Present this to the voters.
@RepCheri is correct. Dems win NOT by talking about impeachment but by showing and BELIEVING in a new way that actually helps and builds up the middle class. Present the bold ideas the nation needs and wants to hear
The DNC Helpline is now live. Let’s win some elections!
