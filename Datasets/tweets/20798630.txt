"Writing is finally about one thing: going into a room alone and doing it. Putting words on paper that have never been there in quite that way before." #RIP William Goldman, who created movie magic on the page, from BUTCH CASSIDY to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN to THE PRINCESS BRIDE. https://t.co/1iTKeFVFn1
In Tyson's hands, each new role is a new opportunity for limitless invention, another occasion to turn words on a page into a living, breathing being, the sublimest of gifts that any actor can give. Which is as it should be. For Cicely Tyson is, herself, the sublimest of gifts. https://t.co/5mPC8iImf5
Cicely Tyson, in her own words: “I think when you begin to think of yourself as having achieved something, then there’s nothing left for you to work towards. I want to believe that there is a mountain so high that I will spend my entire life striving to reach the top of it.” https://t.co/2wooRcF9yB
Tyson's approach, rooted in earth yet so often reaching a heavenly plane of catharsis, improves every project she participates in. Long live this tenacious trailblazer, this remarkable and resilient goddess, whose creativity makes every single one of her characters matter. https://t.co/WI2MthlUCJ
Tyson, who turns 94 this year and shows no signs of slowing down, paved the way for stars like @ImAngelaBassett, @ViolaDavis, and @KerryWashington, among the many black actors who are able to shine in a spotlight that would not exist without her hard work and humanizing artistry. https://t.co/a2lpiNdYW9
Of her essential, Oscar-nominated turn in SOUNDER, we wrote in our Black Actress Canon, "Tyson can close her hands around any emotion, embody it, and make us feel its full power. Sometimes all you need is a camera and a once-in-a-lifetime actress to create transcendent cinema." https://t.co/1ICTN1WTMA
This Saturday, Cicely Tyson, one of the greatest actors to ever grace the silver screen, will receive a long overdue Honorary Academy Award for a lifetime of masterful performances that have expanded the emotional possibilities of cinema. A tribute... #HonoraryOscars https://t.co/ofgm8dIgoH

The truth? “I’ve never lit more than I did on MUDBOUND.” Weather conditions during the 28 day-shoot necessitated frequent fixes and artificial light. #ThroughHerLens https://t.co/G9ib22GHhe
Morrison’s next film is Benedict Andrews’s AGAINST ALL ENEMIES, a biographical political thriller in which Kristen Stewart plays the late, iconic American actress Jean Seberg during her time spent aiding political groups in the Civil Rights movement. It was shot entirely on film. https://t.co/tudAamfIUB
“This is a medium that takes empathy and channels it into visuals... This is something women do well. I don’t know why there aren’t more women doing [what I do].” — Rachel Morrison https://t.co/XnWdgOdYC5
On FRUITVALE STATION, Morrison and her recurring collaborator Ryan Coogler had only 12 hours over the course of three nights to film the pivotal sequence in the BART train station. Morrison, Coogler, their actors, and gaffers blocked the sequence in the parking lot of a church. https://t.co/tdvaiCJxKk
“Not enough directors try to bring their department heads together.” Morrison says BLACK PANTHER was a rare project where everyone presented their work to one another. For instance, Morrison’s decision to use green screen required consultations with costume queen @IAmRuthECarter. https://t.co/wiAR2eOlAU
Morrison prefers to work with a shot list rather than a storyboard, although she used the latter as a safety net on BLACK PANTHER: “Shot lists can get you to the emotional crux of what you’re trying to do. It’s a blueprint. [Storyboards] don’t leave any room for improvisation.” https://t.co/MS8ABtQb36
Earlier in her life, Morrison was torn between pursuing filmmaking or photojournalism, ultimately choosing the former because it is “a collaborative medium.” Morrison compares working with others on a film to sitting at a Thanksgiving table every day. #ThroughHerLens https://t.co/8WdB93BvmB
This morning, the remarkable Rachel @MorrisonDP, the first woman cinematographer to be nominated by @TheAcademy for Best Cinematography (for Dee Rees’s MUDBOUND), will deliver a Master Class as part of Tribeca and CHANEL’s women’s filmmaker program #ThroughHerLens.

"I am terribly shy. Or maybe introverted is a better word... introverted, shy, whatever, it stays with you whether you’re a star or not. People become actors and actresses to overcome just that. You can become so many people." The great Rita Hayworth was born 100 years ago today. https://t.co/vDADM6GOod

When it comes to costuming, Stacey Battat’s favorite movies include the original ANNIE, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, CASABLANCA, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, and anything designed by the astonishing, Academy Award-winning legend Milena Canonero. https://t.co/HNyyMcbaa0
Stacey Battat, seen far right on THE BEGUILED set, says she has three key factors that compel her to join a project: good stories, good people, and good clothes: “If the people involved aren’t collaborative and the story isn’t going to inspire you, don’t do it.” #ThroughHerLens https://t.co/7lsmLOCX0r
Battat is a self-professed stickler when it comes to costuming extras and says many movies suffer when designers don’t put enough thought into how their extras look. “Extras are scenic art,” she says. “They are a moving mural. And people always forget this.” https://t.co/TDEJsKOblY
Stacey Battat said that each of the actresses on THE BEGUILED had only three outfits for the entire shoot. In between scenes, Battat would spend time changing the collars and cuffs of these pieces, as women in that time actually did when their clothes became worn. #ThroughHerLens https://t.co/KGsxzxifXP
“You don’t need lots of clothes, you just need good ones — and that doesn’t mean expensive ones, but rather ones that tell a story,” says Stacey Battat, seen here on the left on the set of THE BLING RING, about making movies with a low budget. #ThroughHerLens https://t.co/2IMuSUIDsP
Battat, who recently designed Sebastián Lelio’s GLORIA BELL with Julianne Moore, says she loves to work with the cinematographers, production designers, and department heads of her projects. For Battat, such collaborations are integral to making beautiful movies. #ThroughHerLens https://t.co/XOx1FNyeC8
One of Stacey Battat’s favorite collaborators is the great Julianne Moore, who is “incredibly collaborative” and has worked with Battat on WHAT MAISIE KNEW, STILL ALICE, and FREEHELD. “We’ve created a lot of great characters. I love working with her because she can be anything.” https://t.co/CBiCh0pAmd
Battat, who tackled period outfits with amazing results in THE BEGUILED, says that some designers become too intent on trying to meticulously recreate the era at the risk of depersonalizing their work. “People take the period and interpret it, but forget about the characters.” https://t.co/vMEujD1mzw
Battat’s process begins with reading the script and then creating a look book of what she believes the characters should look like before bringing in actors and hair and makeup artists. Battat’s first credit was Laurie Simmons’s 2006 short THE MUSIC OF REGRET with Meryl Streep. https://t.co/XGMGOOV7DA
As part of the 2018 edition of Tribeca and CHANEL’s women’s filmmaker program #ThroughHerLens, costume designer Stacey Battat, an invaluable creative partner to Sofia Coppola, will be delivering a master class to this year’s selected artists. Stay tuned... https://t.co/uzV3zf45Rz

.@LievSchreiber: Acting “can feel shallow sometimes but Ray’s relationship to loneliness, masculinity, fear, violence, and vulnerability are all places I get to go. It’s satisfying to do things that are so deep and meaningful but you have to remind yourself that it’s just a job.” https://t.co/67DvfK2M65
.@LievSchreiber on the Ray Donovan persona: “He absorbs suffering and he protects. He projects a certain fantasy of masculinity that is attractive to women and men, but he’s also an infantilized version of a person dealing with pain and abuse. That’s an extraordinary creation.” https://t.co/wHr1pDycng

.@DiamondMoFallon on what Bourdain taught him: “If there’s one thing for me, it’s abandoning fear of other people and being able to wholeheartedly throw yourself out into the world. He did that and was so open about his own complexities. He said, ‘This is who I am. Who are you?’” https://t.co/1PkzJ7DQUB
At various points in the Kenya episode, Bourdain makes note of a certain person’s reprehensible “shithole” comment. “Tony wasn’t afraid of making a statement,” says @PartsUnknownCNN’s showrunner and executive producer Sandy Zweig. “If there was something to say, he would say it.” https://t.co/n1tmCAEG4b

Alexander Payne says the hardest film he ever made was DOWNSIZING, which he found difficult in every area, from writing to financing to editing. Addressing its less-than-stellar reception, Payne says it was perhaps too ambitious a narrative to fit into the size of a film. https://t.co/nactXFjrdw

Alexander Payne’s has “300 favorite movies,” but his go-to picks are Akira Kurosawa’s SEVEN SAMURAI, Hal Ashby’s THE LAST DETAIL, and Sam Peckinpah’s THE WILD BUNCH, among many others. Dick Cavett’s is Carol Reed’s THE THIRD MAN, the only movie that is, to him, “perfect.” https://t.co/DANkxfWKlN
