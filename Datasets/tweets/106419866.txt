I wrote down my thoughts about the south and snow in Blog Form here: http://t.co/tSwTV2Hwng
@jeremiahjw @jwherrman I think in a lot of cases they were abandoning because traffic had stopped, as opposed to the snow conditions.
@nnimrodd It’s okay I didn’t know you were following in the first place!
Rushing &gt;&gt; accidents &gt;&gt; gridlock &gt;&gt; people abandoning their cars on every major artery. And that is how you get snowpocalypse! (5/5)
So everyone went to work/school/etc. But then snow happened! And everyone tried to rush home/to pick up kids at the same time. (4/5)
And if the forecast had called for 2 in., we would have been in better shape. Instead, we were expecting this: http://t.co/XpWe0xvNmC (3/5)
The city's not set up for snow (a given). But usually preemptive measures--shut down schools, etc--are enough to keep the roads clear. (2/5)
For everyone confused about how the South went full apocalypse over a couple inches of snow, here's what happened in Birmingham. (1/5)

@panzer Maybe not raw numbers but in terms of stuff you'd actually want to buy? It's getting there. And yes, I was talking US.
@dburnnzz @samfbiddle Thanks man!

@nxthompson 300 bucks, not quite retina, education and/or bathtub tweeting.
Vern Troyer's agent sits poised at his desk, finger dangling above Tim Cook's direct line speed dial. "Mini?" He grins. "I've got Mini."
RT @pete_schultz: Were all those drones dropping apologies? #debate
Debate devolving quickly into "where did you summer"?
@mps2003 Can I make a Mormon joke there? Seems like maybe but don't know enough about Mormonism and/or religious tolerance.
@LesHorn Honestly wish we were still fighting Desert Storm but maybe I just love America best/most?
@mps2003 More out of hand, rather. It's actually pretty great!
@mps2003 been trying to multitask but if this inning gets much worse I might just bail on both.
The only people still watching this think Mali is a middle reliever.
"All over the map" should maybe not be your go-to pejorative in a foreign policy debate.
@BrandonJGardner Bless you for helping me not miss any part of that process.
I'd go as this for Halloween but I think I'd scare myself too badly http://t.co/QiYmkZjN
@mattbuchanan I like that Larry sounds like someone wrote up his remarks beforehand and ran them through a synthesizer.
Wow wow wow. RT @alexismadrigal: A guy who *saw* Lincoln get shot was on a TV show in 1956 that is now on YouTube. http://t.co/Ad8eG5I9
Newsweek going digital isn't the end of an era, it's just the (long overdue) end of Newsweek: http://t.co/BbR6TQHy
@MrMobilePC How on earth are covering the iPad Mini announcement date and advising folks against uninformed purchases mutually exclusive?
@JCMua Ugh no of course not. It's an unproven device that your life is in no way worsened by waiting a few weeks for.
Haha so true RT @obamapensionwithchineseinvestments I'm topical!
Gonna go start @obamapensionwithchineseinvestments. That's how this works right?
Nice, four for four. RT @Gizmodo: The average Twitter user is a mid 20's girl who has an iPhone and loves purple: http://t.co/K8zmGe5c
@erichpfeiffer Nah, very happy with my Lumia!
Remember: tonight's debate is the only time we'll ever be able to unironically equate Mitt Romney with Apollo Creed.
Too late to submit this as a debate question? MT @Splitsider: The Ernest Series Is Being Rebooted http://t.co/YiM7zNUB

@samfbiddle In fairness it's also an effective form of birth control.
@LesHorn Good use of day off.
MAYBE THIS WAN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA. http://t.co/tliAfA2B http://t.co/1hrx90cp
Thank you, @Orioles, for a pretty wonderful season.
One enjoyable thing this series is watching Yankees argue with so many calls that are legitimate strikes. Maybe the only enjoyable thing.
No sour grapes because it was a tough call but for what it's worth that DEFINITELY HIT THE POLE.
Peter Berg also insisting that Obama campaign start using quotes from Battleship.
RT @AntDeRosa: "Friday Night Lights" creator tells Romney campaign to stop using "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose" http://t.co/SOgD3LXy
@DavidBGail Come on David, these grossly oversimplified narratives aren't going to reinforce themselves!
@loribergamotto As long as this isn't Raul Ibañez tweeting from Lori's account we're good! And I will definitely pass along the bday wishes.

That might not have made sense but Reddit will vigorously defend your right to post creepshots and that is awful http://t.co/T289UrcK
Reddit is like the Saving Private Ryan unit except they're sacrificing underaged girls for the sake of the dirtbag who's exploiting them.
I'm just sayin... http://t.co/3iT1HjKt
@kylenw Just... don't.
Manny Machado! YOU hit a home run and window phone suggests I might have wanted to say "mach ado" which makes even less sense.
Flaherty! You hit a home run AND the iPad tries to autocorrect your name to flasher toy!
@LesHorn Irresponsible tweet.
@ErikDavis @LesHorn LIVES ARE AT STAKE.

Double plus good. RT @jwherrman: ok these are pretty funny http://t.co/d0848ocY
@fishermatt This tweet is like looking three months into my future ARE YOU A LOOPER? (I don't know what that means I haven't seen it either)
@joemfbrown @skidder It's fine, they all live in Sarasota anyway.
@jwherrman Almost got there but forgot my orkut password and all the security questions were in portuguese.
Getting a guy like Lew Ford home should count for at least three runs, right? Degree of difficulty and all that.
That went poorly!
If your iPhone 5 camera produces a weird purple flare, Apple would like you to know that it's pretty much your fault: http://t.co/bbQVr7Ai
OKAY THEN. Bring on the Yankees.
@mariojoze @leshorn Please to not be jinxing this thank you.
BUT WHAT DOES JAY GIBBONS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT ALL THIS http://t.co/qYS82Wy8
I feel like Jim Thome and Manny Machado could co-star in a pretty decent Freaky Friday type flick.
Break Mark Reynolds' hand all you want; everyone knows his true power comes from those flowing locks.
@loribergamotto AL East represent! Also to be honest I'd definitely rather play the O's than the rangers down the line too...
Ready. http://t.co/aAh5wHMx
Somewhere, Geronimo Berroa is giddy with anticipation.
Also! @Orioles DH Jim Thome was on the Indians team that sent the O's packing in '97. Which also makes him approx. 74 years old.
The last @Orioles playoff game was October 15th, 1997. Armando Benitez gave up a two-out solo homer in the 11th: http://t.co/QWrgPdpO

@LesHorn @kylenw @mat @joemfbrown @lhorn Probably hangs out with @jalvidrez?
@michaeljleary Thank you for the constructive feedback! Always great to get a dialogue going. You're right, that was totally #lazy of me.
@mattbuchanan @max_read @samfbiddle Guys could you stick this in a branch maybe?
@frucci @brandonjgardner Are they going to have the O's game on? That's the only possible dealbreaker I can think of.
@frucci @brandonjgardner Honestly I really dig the live on-stage stuff. So hard to make that not feel forced (and I think they pull it off).
@dcsportsbog You think that's bad, try finding one in Birmingham, Alabama.
The single biggest question about the iPad Mini: http://t.co/ukt9jRi3
If you're an undecided voter who sat through last night, why would you even bother watching the other debates?
@max_read Oh god I'd totally forgotten how much I love a good story AND that anything can happen thank you life feels good again

RT @nanglish: "Hey what's this thing I'm holding?"- Romney at the coin toss
I'd like to thank the Internet in advance for the supercut of Romney cutting of Lehrer that I'm going to watch over and over tomorrow.
Lehrer, tired of Romney bullying, closes debate with unplanned, shouted question: "WHO AMONG YOU KILLED BIN LADEN?"
Romney answers every question with a listicle, which is going to be super helpful for @buzzfeed tomorrow morning.
Still waiting to hear where Obama stands on Mr. Snuffleupagus.
.Jim Lehrer only planned two questions for tonight, so this is working out perfectly for him.
Just scored a follow-up interview with the team that designed the Lehrer muppet.
Looking forward to everyone's planned zingers about Romney's planned zingers.
Last thing: I'm not buying this "domesticated but bad pets" nonsense. If you're a bad pet you're just a wild animal I happen to be feeding.
