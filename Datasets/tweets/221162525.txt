A bipartisan majority voted tonight to ensure care is given to infants who survive botched abortions. Sadly, a minority of senators justified blocking the bill by saying it limits access to abortions, which isn’t true. It's about babies, who are born alive, &amp; deserve protection.

Encouraging news from @POTUS that progress is being made in a trade deal with China. Hopefully this leads to an agreement that stops China’s theft of US intellectual property and avoids a full blown trade war.
American consumers have paid $13B billion in tariffs, i.e. taxes, on imported steel/alum, and goods from China. They've doled out another $7.7B to farmers hurt by this trade war. Farmers don't need handouts; they need this trade war to end and better access to foreign markets. https://t.co/v1Nxh9UPgJ

I hope Democrats, who promised to negotiate in good faith if the government were open, will now compromise with the president so the country can put this frustrating episode behind us.
As I have said all along, the obvious, necessary resolution is a compromise that improves border security – including physical barriers where they make sense – and delivers on some Democrat priorities, too.
I am glad the government is reopening and 800,000 federal employees are getting paid. Over the next three weeks, the president and Congress will have an opportunity to craft a workable solution.
I hope today’s votes will bring Speaker Pelosi and Democrats to the table so there is an agreement that reopens the government, secures the border, and allows federal employees to return to work with pay.
Speaker Pelosi has, thus far, refused to negotiate and my Democratic colleagues, just today, went so far as to block efforts to pay Coast Guard members and other federal employees who have been working without pay.
In a compromise, neither side gets everything they want and both sides get something they want. There is a deal to be had here that improves border security - including physical barriers where they make sense - and delivers on some Democrat priorities, too.
As I have said all along, the obvious, necessary resolution is a compromise. I am willing to compromise. In a compromise, neither side gets everything they want and both sides get something they want. I am willing to compromise.
I hope today’s votes represent modest progress toward ending this partial government shutdown. These votes demonstrate that neither the president’s proposal nor the Democrat proposal have enough support to pass Congress.

The Senate will vote on this sensible plan next week. Speaker Pelosi should allow the House to do the same.
The president’s offer, which is based on the bipartisan BRIDGE Act introduced by Senators Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin – who serves as the number two Democrat in the Senate – would provide legal status to DACA recipients for three years.
Now, President Trump is offering Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats a top legislative priority of theirs in an effort to end this partial government shutdown.
President Trump's request for $5.7 billion in border security funding is reasonable and certainly deserved a counter proposal, at the very least. But Speaker Pelosi has refused to​ negotiate.

Correctional officers should be able to defend themselves from the criminals who wish to attack them. Modifying existing rules to permit them to carry a firearm while they commute to and from work would  certainly go a long way to achieving this goal. https://t.co/HdpJqxR9cF

Illicit fentanyl can be 50X as potent as heroin. A tiny amount can kill a person, including 1st responders who may be exposed when attending to an OD victim/crime scene.

The ITC’s ruling to end this financial burden on publishers across Pennsylvania is the right one. https://t.co/xSowcn1jix
An unnecessary tax on newsprint could have been a death knell for many jobs in the newspaper and publishing industries, both of which are already facing significant challenges.
As such, I’m pleased to see the U.S. International Trade Commission has unanimously ruled against the administration’s harmful tax on newsprint imported from Canada.
American companies must be allowed to adequately and fairly source materials, especially when those items are not produced in sufficient quantities domestically.
Just heard @CommerceGov approved 1 of @CP_Industries' tariff exclusion petitions. I was happy to back a SWPA manufacturer &amp; its workers on this effort. On behalf of the remaining 37 PA firms harmed by these taxes, I urge the Dept. to redouble its efforts: https://t.co/Wf6PCGELRc

Senator McCain led a life that should be admired and respected by all Americans. I am proud to have called him a friend. Kris and I send our deepest sympathies to Cindy and the entire McCain family.
And for more than thirty years, Senator McCain fought for Arizonans in the Senate. Most importantly, Senator McCain was not afraid to fight for what he thought was right, even when it was unpopular.
But most of all Senator McCain was a fighter. He fought for his country in Vietnam. He fought for his brothers in arms while being held as prisoners of war.
Today is a sad day for the Senate and America. Senator John McCain was a hero and one of our nation’s greatest patriots.
POTUS’s taxes on imported steel are hurting econ growth &amp; job creation. That is why I sent another letter to the Admin listing 37 PA firms harmed by these unnecessary taxes. I will continue working w/ my colleagues to restore Congress's trade powers. https://t.co/UzbOoI14Fs

I look forward to following Judge Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing and I intend to support his nomination when it comes to the Senate floor.
I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will give Judge Kavanaugh fair consideration so that Republicans &amp; Democrats can work together to confirm this highly qualified jurist.
Judge Kavanaugh understands that the proper role of a judge is to apply neutrally the law, including the U.S. Constitution, as written, &amp; not to decide cases based on personal or partisan policy  preferences.
I was very pleased to meet with Judge Kavanaugh this morning. Based on my review of his record and our conversation, it is clear to me that Judge Kavanaugh has the character, intellect, experience, &amp; judicial philosophy to be an outstanding Supreme Court Justice. https://t.co/GqUXhc4fs8

.@POTUS' blindness to Putin’s hostile acts against the US and our allies—election meddling included—is very troubling. Please read my statement in reaction to today’s Helsinki press conference: https://t.co/7JGtcfg9ph
Absent his cooperation in achieving that justice, the United States should impose tough new sanctions on Russia.
Putin insists that the Russian government has nothing to do with meddling in our elections. In that case, he should not object to the hackers recently indicted being brought to justice.
it’s clear that Putin is a bad actor and should be treated as an international pariah.
Whether it's protecting the hackers responsible for this crime, committing numerous human rights violations, invading Ukraine, annexing Crimea, supporting the Iranian regime, taking hostile actions in Syria, or threatening peaceful European neighbors,
American intelligence agencies have confirmed, unequivocally, that Russian actors, almost certainly at the direction of the Russian government and Vladimir Putin, meddled in our 2016 presidential election.

By passing legislation to require congressional approval of national security-designated tariffs, Congress can reassert its constitutional responsibility (Art 1, Sec 8, Clauses 1 &amp; 3) on trade &amp; ensure Americans can keep buying affordable products &amp; keep selling our goods abroad.
The decision to use these taxes should not be taken lightly or unilaterally.
Tariffs are taxes on American consumers. They hurt American workers, families, and employers. Imposing them under the false pretense of ‘national security’ weakens our economy, our credibility with other nations, and invites retaliation.
Our commitment to veterans means always improving health care provided by the VA. The bipartisan #VAMISSIONAct seeks to give veterans more control over health care decisions &amp; access to the best treatment possible. I’m glad @POTUS signed this important legislation into law.

If this devolves into a full-blown trade war, the resulting harm will undo all of the great economic progress we’ve made with deregulation and tax reform.
Congress should assert its constitutional responsibility and lead on trade policy so Americans keep access to affordable goods and services, and the opportunity to sell our products abroad.
I'll be cosponsoring @SenMikeLee's bill, S.177, to rein in the executive branch's power to impose unilateral tax increases like these.
Claiming steel bought from our allies is a 'national security' threat weakens our credibility. These tariffs, i.e. taxes, hurt American workers, employers, and consumers.
Bad news that @POTUS has decided to impose taxes on American consumers buying steel and aluminum from our closest allies--Canada, the EU, and Mexico (with whom we run a trade surplus on steel). In addition to higher prices, these tariffs invite retaliation.
I've seen members of my family suffer from incurable diseases &amp; I sympathize w/ wanting a chance to save one’s life by trying new therapies. It’s why I cosponsored the #RightToTry Act. On behalf of those hoping for a cure, glad to see @POTUS signed @SenRonJohnson’s bill into law.

Like so many of my colleagues, I will miss having Paul Ryan in Congress. I wish Paul, Janna, and their family nothing but the best.
His intellectual and political leadership was indispensable in passing our historic tax reform. He has worked faithfully to make this a better nation for all.
It has been an honor to work with Paul in Congress. He stepped into the speakership during a difficult moment, providing the personal and political guidance that enabled the House of Representatives to succeed.
I have known Paul Ryan since we were elected together to the House in 1998. In addition to serving on the House Budget and Banking committees together, I consider Paul a good friend and speak with certainty in saying he is a terrific public servant, husband, and father.
I am glad that both chambers were able to work in a bipartisan manner to combat the unconscionable practice of online sex trafficking. Today, @POTUS has signed our bipartisan legislation into law, a big step forward in ending this terrible practice. #SESTA #FOSTA

The responsible way to fund the government is incrementally, after scrutiny and the opportunity to amend in a transparent process on the Senate floor.
Although I am pleased that Congress is providing additional resources to rebuild our military, bills like this inevitably spend too much money and much of it unwisely.
This is a failure of one of our most fundamental responsibilities and it contributes to our huge deficit and dangerously mounting debt.
It’s irresponsible that Congress would pass, with little debate, less transparency, and no opportunity for amendments, a two-thousand-page, trillion-dollar spending bill chock-full of wasteful and ineffective programs.
While I get why he'd want some delicious Philly soft pretzels, I’m afraid @Sen_JoeManchin is sorely mistaken if he thinks his @WVUhoops Mountaineers stand a chance against Jay Wright and the #1 seed @NovaMBB Wildcats in the #Sweet16.

I will continue to work with the administration to mitigate the effects of these tariffs on Pennsylvania industries and workers.
The administration invoking national security to impose #tariffs on imported steel and aluminum is a big mistake that will increase costs on American consumers, weaken our economy, and invite retaliation from other countries on other products.
While it is good that Americans won't have to pay new taxes on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, reportedly this new proclamation will, instead, force big tax increases onto American consumers of steel and aluminum from our other trading partners.

I appreciate the President’s constructive leadership to fix the broken RINs system.

It was also deeply troubling that a minority of Senators blocked consideration of my common-sense bipartisan amendment designed to end dangerous sanctuary city policies.
I voted in favor of legislation to provide a pathway to citizenship for individuals who were brought to the United States illegally at a young age and address other critical challenges within our broken immigration system, including border security and enforcement.
I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to reach an agreement today on immigration policy.
I believe gun safety legislation should focus on keeping guns away from those who shouldn’t have them--criminals, the dangerously mentally ill, and terrorists.
I am committed to improving our federal background check system, which is why my staff and I will continue to reach out to senators on both sides of the aisle to see where progress can be made.

Tune into C-SPAN 2 at 4PM to hear my address to the Senate on why we must pass my #SanctuaryCities amendment to protect communities from dangerous criminals.
Thank you @SenTedCruz, @JimInhofe, @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenDeanHeller, @SenJohnKennedy, @Sen_JoeManchin, and @SenCapito for cosponsoring my bipartisan #SanctuaryCities amendment to keep our communities safe from dangerous criminals.
Below is more information on the amendment that I introduced: https://t.co/USIhg9aNWB
This isn’t a controversial issue. Leaders from both sides of the aisle agree that #SanctuaryCities policies must end. When I intro'd my bill in 2016, a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted in favor of it. It's time for this madness to end. Let's vote.
In order for any #DACA fix to be meaningful and effective, we can't tie the hands of those who try to enforce the laws we write. #SanctuaryCity policies make it virtually impossible for any #DACA fix to be implemented in good faith. Worse still, they make us less safe.
Immigrants want safe cities and communities as much as anyone. My amendment allows cities to protect illegal immigrants who come forward as witnesses or victims of crimes. This is about everyone’s safety.
.@SenSchumer says #SanctuaryCities have nothing to do w/border security or #DACA. My #SanctuaryCities amdt focuses on smart immigration enforcement. Following immigration laws &amp; protecting citizens from dangerous criminals in our cities is the 1st step to a secure border.
I hope @SenSchumer and Senate Dems will agree to start holding votes on immigration since they've insisted upon debating it for weeks. First they shut down the government over this, now they’re slow-walking a start to the debate.

Below is more information on the amendment that I Introduced today: https://t.co/USIhg9aNWB
Enough playing politics with the safety and well-being of the American people. I ask my colleagues to join me in saying no more to #SanctuaryCities. Let’s make these dangerous policies a thing of the past.
Leaders from both sides of the aisle agree: we must end the indefensible policy of protecting dangerous criminals from deportation. #SanctuaryCities do not protect the innocent, they simply make it harder to get violent criminals off the streets.
Other than in enforcing immigration law, there is no other type of crime where a politician-made mandate ties local police hands when an officer thinks – in the interest of public safety – cooperation w/fed. law enforcement is necessary.
Immigrants want safe streets, too, and the bill has language to protect those here illegally who come forward as a victim or witness of a crime.
This isn’t about asking local police to enforce fed. immigration law. Fed. immigration officials are merely asking police to hold a person – who’s already been arrested and is in the US illegally – until DHS/ICE can arrive to question or take custody.
#SanctuaryCity policies aren’t just unique to Philly. Many of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties have #SanctuaryCity policies. These laws are as misguided as they are dangerous.
Philly's extreme + dangerous #SanctuaryCity law prohibited the police from even talking with federal immigration authorities. This wouldn't have happened if Philly wasn't a #SanctuaryCity.
For example: Philly PD once arrested an illegal immigrant, who’d previously been deported, for assault &amp; other charges. Fed. immigration officials asked Philly PD to hold him temporarily. Instead, the man was set free. He was later arrested for raping a child under the age of 13.
#SanctuaryCities are jurisdictions/municipalities, like Philly, that have policies barring local law enf. from cooperating with fed. immigration authorities in certain instances, even in cases when they wanted to help. These policies hamper law enf. &amp; make us less safe.
I once again ask my colleagues to focus their attention on the serious problem of dangerous #SanctuaryCities. There's lots of misinformation about #SanctuaryCities so here are the facts.
For there to be a good-faith bill on #DACA, dangerous #SanctuaryCity policies must be addressed: DREAM Act says if you commit certain crimes, you lose protections &amp; can be deported. If local law enf. can’t cooperate with DHS/ICE, then this provision is virtually unenforceable.
As we begin to debate the issue of immigration, @SenSchumer is blocking a vote on my amdt to address problem of dangerous #SanctuaryCities, putting interests of criminals before public safety.
I was very saddened to hear former Congressman Jon Fox passed away last weekend. My deepest condolences are with his family, friends, and loved ones.
However, it is very important to note that this budget proposal serves only to outline the priorities of the administration and does not carry the weight of law. The ultimate responsibility for passing a budget and funding the government rests with Congress.
Combating opioid abuse, improving veterans’ health care, and boosting funding for national security and our military are worthy priorities President Trump’s budget proposal embraces. I look forward to reviewing this budget proposal in its entirety over the coming week.
This year, @TeamUSA sent the largest ever delegation to the Olympic Winter Games. Very proud to see among the 242 Americans representing our nation in Pyeongchang will be 9 Pennsylvanians! You've all made our commonwealth and nation proud! #WinterOlympics
Unfortunately, it also adds $131 billion in non-security spending, without any real, meaningful offsetting spending reductions. Our federal government is on an unsustainable fiscal path. This spending spree makes it worse.
The budget agreement proposes a badly needed spending increase to strengthen national security, rebuild our neglected military, and honor our commitment to veterans.
Earlier this week I went to the floor to honor the @Eagles incredible #SBLII victory. From the amazing game called by Coach Pederson, to the perseverance the team showed from Nick Foles on down, this win means everything for Philadelphia. Watch: https://t.co/fGqxrfOyKZ

I hope my colleagues will swiftly consider this important piece of legislation so no other families have to see violent criminals avoid justice. https://t.co/kDJy5zFq1X
The lack of any consequence in this case highlights a flaw in our justice system. This is why @SenTomCotton, @JohnCornyn, @SenTedCruz and I introduced Eric's Law, to provide justice for murder victims like Officer Eric Williams.
Officer Eric Williams's life was senselessly cut short by a violent gang assassin. His murderer essentially received no punishment for his crime, even though eleven out of twelve jurors voted for the death penalty, because he was already serving a life sentence.
What a game! Congratulations to the entire @Eagles organization and birds fans everywhere. The wait is finally over! #SuperBowlChampions #FlyEaglesFly https://t.co/BrABi97OgD

This would preclude the risk of distracting, disruptive manufactured crises such as the one our Democratic colleagues just caused. #SchumerShutdown
Instead of the obstruction of recent years, going forward, Democrats should allow the Senate to debate, amend and pass each of the 12 annual funding bills well before the end of the fiscal year.
This is not how decisions about the government’s budget should be made. It is well past time for the Senate to return to regular order.
We found ourselves in this dysfunctional mess because my colleagues across the aisle recklessly refused to govern and held the government hostage on a single issue impacting a select group of illegal immigrants.
I am encouraged that an interim, bipartisan agreement was reached to reopen our government, fund our military, and provide health care to nine million American children.
Looking forward to Super Bowl XXXIX rematch @eagles. #FlyEaglesFly

The @GOPSenFinance #TaxReform bill will help PA families in 2 big ways: 1. We lower your federal tax bill. More money for you, less for Uncle Sam. 2. We take arguably the worst business tax code, and make it the best, driving up wages. Learn more: https://t.co/6wgQGi8kff
We want to free Americans from the onerous burden of the individual mandate tax, which unduly effects low-income Americans. We will take this up in tomorrow's @GOPSenFinance #TaxReform markup. Watch my @CNBCClosingBell segment to learn more: https://t.co/xmiueoRcbw
The individual mandate tax is based on a flawed premise that the fed govt should force Americans to buy overpriced health insurance even if they don't want it/cant afford it. Repealing the ind. mandate tax is direct tax relief for the working class. My statement: https://t.co/KTdzrylbIS

7/ @PittsburghPG is right: “Democrats… should accept reality… they’d end up losing a battle to kill his nomination.”

that there are no security risks among them.  The safety of our people must come first.
As a result, we should suspend refugee admissions from Syria until we are able to determine with full confidence...
unfortunately we presently have no fully reliable way of vetting those who come from chaotic terrorist havens such as Syria.
While most refugees are innocent people in dire situations...
we must reexamine our security protocols for admitting Syrian refugees.
In light of the credible report that a violent Islamist extremist claiming refugee status participated in the attacks in Paris...
The admission of Syrian refugees into the U.S. should be suspended. The safety of our people must come first. https://t.co/xNqp9Gd8Ew

Sad but true: @PatriotNews: It's too easy for schools to put kids at risk by “passing the trash” http://t.co/jb1QNQCQGZ. Don't #passthetrash
I do not believe that Mr. Adegbile demonstrated such a commitment in his handling of the Mumia Abu-Jamal case.
This requires the head of the Civil Rights Division to have an absolute commitment to truth and justice.
The mission of the DOJ division that Mr. Adegbile would lead is to uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all individuals.
Lawyers managed by Mr. Adegbile distorted the facts in the case for Mumia Abu-Jamal, the unrepentant murderer of Officer Faulkner.
Mr. Adegbile’s record raises serious questions about his judgment and fitness to execute the duties of assistant attorney general.
I oppose the nomination of Debo Adegbile to head the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.
