.@PressSec says: “The two leaders discussed various ways to advance denuclearization and economic driven concepts. No agreement was reached at this time, but their respective teams look forward to meeting in the future.” (2)
From @PressSec: “President Donald J. Trump of the United States and Chairman Kim Jong Un of the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had very good and constructive meetings...” (1)
White House says no agreement was reached between @realDonaldTrump and #KimJungUn on a North Korean peace deal.
.@realDonaldTrump has left the summit site.
The pool was waiting for some time in a dining room where @realDonaldTrump and #KimJongUn were slated to dine with advisers. Then a White House aide came in abruptly and said there had been a program change. We left the room. The lunch appears to be off along with the signing.
The signing ceremony between @realDonaldTrump and #KimJongUn may be cancelled. @PressSec says talks are going to wrap up in half an hour and the president will then go back to his hotel and hold a press conference two hours early.
I also asked #KimJungUn if he was discussing human rights with @realDonaldTrump. The president stepped in for that one and said they were discussing everything. Kim did not respond.
#KimJongUn took several questions from reporters while meeting with @realDonaldTrump. Asked by Reuters if he was ready to denuclearize, he said “If I’m not willing to do that, I won’t be here,” right now. Trump responded: “That might be the best answer you’ve ever heard.”
