As the father of a teenage daughter, here's my reaction to Rudy Giuliani calling his friend's daughter a "fine woman" who he vowed to protect with a lance if Robert Mueller targets her. Seriously, you have to watch what and how Giuliani says it. https://t.co/YQzyPsB96x
Not sure I would like my in-laws to say on national TV that ‚ÄúMen are disposable‚Äù as Rudy Giuliani said tonight about Jared Kushner.
Prediction (I acknowledge it's not bold): No way, No how will @realDonaldTrump sit for an interview with Robert Mueller. Rudy Giuliani &amp; other Trump aides/allies are setting unrealistic ground rules so that they eventually can say NO and blame Mueller's team.
