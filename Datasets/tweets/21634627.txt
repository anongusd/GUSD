@MattBruenig Well, now you're adding more taxes, right? That doesn't really help if there's a limit on how much you can raise taxes. 		(To be clear, I mean a political limit. Not an economic one.)
@MidwestDeplore @MattBruenig I meant limited politically. Agree wholeheartedly about U.S. tax levels relative to rest of developed world: https://t.co/g5NboYAAV1
@MattBruenig Again, not vouching for either proposition. (Have written many times about virtues of Nordic levels of benefits, even if it means Nordic levels of taxes.) And "free" has political upsides, obviously. But I can see both sides of this one.
@MattBruenig 2) Maybe you figure not all parents use/will use child care -- different from K-12 in that regard -- and so it makes sense to have parents to contribute some amount, scaled to ability to pay.
@MattBruenig 1) If you think your ability to raise taxes is limited, then you figure you have X dollars to spend on public programs. If you can get most of benefit with 7 percent fee, saving a few hundred billion for some other use, maybe you think that's a worthwhile trade.

@MattBruenig To be clear, not saying I agree or disagree. But I can see the argument for doing it, especially since fees for early childhood care seem common even in countries with generous welfare states. (2)
@MattBruenig I haven't seen hard figures either, but I'm less sure that nobody would notice. Also, it's not just this proposal, right? If you're in a world of constrained resources, then you're setting limits and making tradeoffs in some places... (1)
@MattBruenig @TopherSpiro That was my reaction too.
@TopherSpiro Right, it depends on the plan. I assume this was for the Sanders M4A bill specifically.
@lori_kearns Well, estimates are all rough right now, in part bc they depend on details that are either unavailable or subject to change. If memory serves -- help me out here, health twitter -- $36T was the high-end Mercatus projection if you assume Congress would scale back provider cuts.
Also, you don't have to be an MMTer to justify deficit financing of the Green New Deal. If there's a case for borrowing, it's for a massive infrastructure effort in order to slow global warming.
To be clear, the vast majority of that -- $80T, by my count -- is universal health care plus the jobs guarantee. So the "green" portion is actually closer to $10T, unless I'm missing something.		(Also, fwiw, the health care part displaces private spending.) https://t.co/BS4C4smi85

Here's how Warren explains it (16) https://t.co/ks7FeI7sIB https://t.co/3BGeopOfT5
@LizMair It *is* real money!		I imagine Warren would argue the child care initiative is a lot easier to justify given benefits. I certainly know a lot of other people who would.		(Also FWIW she pays for it with wealth tax revenue.)
Thread on the Warren plan, from a bona fide expert --&gt; https://t.co/aY2KUMqFnR
...and more like a publicly funded good or service, rather than government simply giving you a tax break to offset your expenses on X or Y. (15)
One more thing: This isn't a complicated tax scheme. 		The idea is to fund child care centers that will meet quality standards, then offer care to all families -- poor, middle-class, rich -- on a sliding income scale. 		Some paperwork, yes, but more straightforward... (14)

Back to Warren, the specifics of the proposal probably matter less than the statement it makes about the issue's salience now -- and the emphasis Warren intends to give it.		She's talked about this. A lot. (13)		https://t.co/QcDfoeRZdU
Both proposals also seek to boost wages for child care providers, which is not just good for the children. It's also good for the providers, who are absurdly underpaid. (12) https://t.co/PN4Wv1F6ha
@EconomicPolicy @brycecovert @nancylcohen @newrepublic @PattyMurray @BobbyScott That bill, like Warren's, pays attention to quality as well as affordability.		That's important, because the quality of child care in the U.S. is inconsistent and sometimes shockingly terrible. https://t.co/BA1w02yz8c (11)
@EconomicPolicy @brycecovert @nancylcohen @newrepublic In Congress, @PattyMurray &amp; @BobbyScott have put together a major initiative called the Child Care for Working Families Act. 		They'll be reintroducing it soon and it's got a lot in common with the Warren proposal, though different policy particulars. (10) https://t.co/j8eE1c2Rik
@EconomicPolicy @brycecovert @nancylcohen @newrepublic That’s been changing lately. Obama gave the issue serious attention. Hillary Clinton had a big proposal in 2016, plus a long history of advocacy on the issue.		But, you know, emails and all that. Few people paid attention. (9) https://t.co/drtzDs12C7
@EconomicPolicy @brycecovert @nancylcohen @newrepublic Gender had a lot to do with that veto -- and with the politics and economics of child care more generally.		It’s been treated as “women’s work,” which means the caregivers aren’t paid well enough and the issue doesn’t get serious attention in Washington. (8)
@EconomicPolicy @brycecovert In 1971, Congress passed a major child care bill that looks a lot like Warren’s today. 		Nixon, responding to conservative advisers, vetoed it and said it was anti-family. 		Via @nancylcohen @newrepublic (7)  https://t.co/pB1zraOhXn

@EconomicPolicy Internal estimates suggest net federal cost would be $700B over ten years. That takes into account effects of resulting economic growth, etc., so immediate outlays would probably be higher.		Regardless, we’re talking the largest federal investment in early childhood ... ever. (5)

@johnastoehr Matter of opinion, of course, but she has certainly spent a lot of time thinking about policy and developing concrete proposals.		Again, I'd point to the quality provisions. These track closely what experts in the field have long proposed.

@MattBruenig @TopherSpiro @JStein_WaPo To the broader point, I assume you mean that total cost of Warren plan + existing programs that stay in place + what parents pay + philanthropic/nonprofit supplement = total federal cost of making it free for everybody. 		Yes? If so, I assume that's correct.
@MattBruenig @TopherSpiro @JStein_WaPo Not sure if it matters at all, but it's not actually tax credits. Money goes to providers, directly or via state/local, who then offer care based on sliding income scale.		(Unless you meant the existing child care tax credit, which, yes, remains in place.)

One reason Warren child care announcement is so meaningful: Issue is starting to get real political momentum for the first time. https://t.co/MzWXYRvq7e
Key feature of Warren child care plan: A focus on quality.		To get funds, providers must hit benchmarks similar to those at Head Start and U.S. Dept. of Defense, which is considered a model.		That includes higher caregiver pay, which is a very big deal.		https://t.co/RbrqcF6GCu

@AllOnMedicare Of course! These are complicated issues, with lots of room for disagreement among well-informed people who share the same general goals.
@AllOnMedicare Also a valid argument -- though, to be fair, the proposal calls for regulating MAdv more tightly. 		I didn't go into detail for space reasons and obviously it's an open question whether the effort would work. But, at the very least, the bill's architects want to address that. https://t.co/KQ9gneFx98
@AllOnMedicare Quite possibly! 		I think there's a credible case the opposition would be less intense or easier to overcome -- private insurers would still have some business, for example, and the revenue hit to hospitals looks less intense. 		But difference could be pretty small. https://t.co/U33XBu1JmB

@rosadelauro @janschakowsky Long-term care is a big crisis that is getting bigger, as anybody who's dealt with that world can attest personally. 		But many reformers have shied away from addressing it head-on because the task is so daunting and expensive. 		@rosadelauro &amp; @janschakowsky didn't. (11)
One last thing: A striking feature of the @rosadelauro @janschakowsky bill is its detailed attention to long-term services and support. 		That's no accident. The lawmakers worked closely with disability community, which has offered strong praise for the final product. (10) https://t.co/zULU5atIzC
Here's a @larry_levitt thread about those kinds of tradeoffs https://t.co/Mi4T98lOpI (9)
My piece doesn't talk much about the fiscal implications (didn't want to overwhelm!) but this bill requires less federal spending than "Medicare for All" -- chiefly bc the federal government wouldn't absorb as many individual health expenses. Again, for better or worse. (8)
Basically, this bill is an effort to find a middle path to universal coverage. 		It's more ambitious than modest expansions of Medicare or Medicaid, but less ambitious than "Medicare for All." 		For better or worse, depending on your perspective. (7)
In this new bill, government would get a lot more involved in regulating prices -- not just for drugs but for doctor and hospitals too.		Again, much like "Medicare for All" would do, though less aggressively and less directly. (6)
The coverage in "Medicare for America," as sponsors @RosaDeLauro &amp; @JanSchakowsky call it, would be a lot more generous than standard ACA policies, though still less generous than what the @BernieSanders bill would offer. (5)
The proposal would also preserve Medicare Advantage.		That's the private insurance option that already exists within Medicare &amp; currently enrolls roughly 1/3 of seniors. Under the new proposal, it'd be available to people of all ages, though under tighter regulation. (4)
The basic concept is to create a new, government-run plan that will absorb existing federal programs, while allowing large employers to keep offering benefits. 		Employees would then get a choice: Stay with the company plan, or enroll in the new government program. (3)
It has a lot in common with two proposals that have been in circulation for a while. 		One from @amprog https://t.co/ProbRCsQbP		And one from @JonWalkerDC https://t.co/m6rz6eGfGW (2)
What if you like the sound of Medicare for All, but worry it's too big a lift right now -- as politics, policy, or both?		This plan may be for you. (1)		https://t.co/VnXcGo2vXd

@CPopeHC @ptbrennan11 I actually was thinking of something less sinister. If you're looking to rally support, getting the entirety of AARP membership on board is useful. But to be clear I was just guessing.
@JHWeissmann @JonWalkerDC The same logic that gave us Medicare in 1965, I suppose.
@JHWeissmann @JonWalkerDC Right. Not clear why you have to draw lines at all.		But some lawmakers want to keep the sheer scale of new initiatives in check, on the theory -- correct or not -- that it's an easier lift politically.		One way to do that is to pick some subgroup of people. And so...here we are.
@JonWalkerDC But I also think the idea is that this is older people are stuck with the highest premiums, so it makes sense to start there. And you have to draw the age line somewhere. 55 is a round number, but so is 50.		(Not saying I agree or disagree with the argument.)

Again, I don't know who is right. M4A advocates make some compelling arguments. But the history of health reform suggests the skepticism is not crazy. (9)
While others don't question the goal, but doubt it's feasible in near future -- and think quickest, surest way there is a series of smaller steps rather than an all-in-one shot that fails and potentially sets back cause. (8)
But I'd take respectful issue with last line -- "whenever Democrats question Medicare-for-all, what they're really questioning is universal coverage."		Some skeptics question whether M4A in strictest definition (I.e, Sanders) is the only worthwhile form of universal coverage. (7)
BTW the plug by @jeffspross for all-payer rate setting at the end is really important.		It's the part of health care reform that gets least attention from the public, but is absolutely essential to bringing down actual costs. (6)
Could be right, could be wrong -- and of course there are strategic questions about whether you set a lofty goal and compromise later, rather than lead with second- or third-best.		All very complicated! Which is why it's good Dems have at least 2 years to debate this. (5)
More generally, though, some M4A skeptics simply think they cannot win all of those fights -- new taxes, new spending, squeezing providers -- in the short term, especially if they are waging all of them at once. 		So they are trying to get the biggest gains they can for now. (4)
That said, a big hesitation with M4A -- at least the version associated with @SenSanders @RepJayapal and others -- is that it requires moving people out of current coverage. That scares a lot of people, though there are clear upsides too. (3)
Certainly true that, in the long run, you don't get to truly universal coverage, at an affordable price for society, without some combo of new taxes and spending, and taking on the health care industry in some way/shape/form. 		M4A has lots of political upsides, too. (2)
Fair-minded response to the M4A skepticism that's been some getting press lately (including from me).		It's from @jeffspross and worth a read. (1)  https://t.co/QC10FBQlyQ

I think this generational divide, between those who were there in 2009-10 and those who were not, explains a lot.  Same dynamic on health care.		And it cuts both ways. That kind of experience can make you prudent -- or timid. Lack of it can make you bold -- or foolish. https://t.co/vwYlq4CrCA

@danielmarans @TopherSpiro I kinda think either interpretation is defensible. 		But now we're getting off-topic so I'll stop.
@danielmarans @TopherSpiro The former is a much narrower definition. Bernie's plan would fit, so would some foreign systems like Taiwan or Canada (though even they have small supplemental policies.)		The latter would include the actual, current Medicare plan, plus foreign systems like the one in France.
@danielmarans @TopherSpiro As for single-payer, the interesting question (to me) is what defines it. 		Does it mean literally one program, covering pretty much everything?		Or does it mean everybody paying into a common risk pool, with possibility of private supplemental plans and alternatives?
@danielmarans @TopherSpiro Gonna keep promoting my nomenclature, even if nobody else likes it. 		(1) Medicare for Everybody 	(2) Medicare for Anybody 	(3) Medicare (or Medicaid) for Some People 		With caveat that it's actually a version of Medicare with better benefits.

@agraybee @sangerkatz @dylanlscott Actually I am trying to watch the Michigan basketball game. 		I certainly don't think name is the biggest obstacle. I do think terminology is confusing a lot of people, so I'm genuinely interested in figuring out how to make things clearer.
There are, of course, real questions of emphasis and nuance. Among other things, time and political capital are limited resources. 		But I think it's way too early in the campaign to have a clear sense of what the first-time candidates are really thinking.		Again, YMMV
I don't find that inconsistent with her statement on Monday -- or inconsistent more generally with support of M4A.		I.e., I think it's possible to think M4A is the best, advocate for it, while also supporting more incremental steps that move towards the same goal.		YMMV

My impression is that many M4A advocates grasp the obstacles in their path. They are playing a long game, sketching out their ideal vision. They see no point in compromising now.		What that means for politics in the next two years, I honestly do not know.
Or you could end up with a more generous version of the ACA -- maybe with fewer, clearer options that include some version of Medicare, Medicaid, or a new government plan. And maybe some combo of automatic enrollment and price regulation. Who knows.
You could also end up with a system in which the government provides basic, less generous coverage -- and private supplemental plans, subsidized for those who need them, cover the rest.		Many European systems look like this. https://t.co/41rxWOJLr3
Of course, we're talking about the M4A legislation as currently written. If Congress took it up seriously, it would probably modify the legislation and scale it back. 		You could end up with something like this: https://t.co/7KmHLzT2Ri
Here are the relevant portions of the bill https://t.co/aGbZjyqJIO		And here are 2 @larry_levitt tweets making the same point https://t.co/5ItZfqRBuS &amp; https://t.co/1SRV3i6qEb https://t.co/6e1JpcfNRT
Private insurance has a significant role in many national health systems, including some that qualify as single-payer. But the Sanders bill, which Harris co-sponsored, would allow for only a niche supplementary market. If that.
BTW there seems to be some confusion about whether Medicare for All -- at least as its chief promoters envision it -- would really displace existing private insurance arrangements. It would.
Here's a @philipaklein thread on the politics of M4A. It sketches out, in more detail, an argument that critics are already starting to make. https://t.co/ZEuAc0SWF6
As for the politics, M4A is simple to explain, offers generous coverage. As Sen. Harris says, it's not as if people like shopping for plans, dealing w/insurers, etc. 		But M4A would move people out of existing arrangements. That makes them *very* nervous.		https://t.co/RRbowAH45H

7. Bottom line: People seem interested in M4A and/or other expansions of government health insurance, but remain unfamiliar with concept(s) and open to different, sometimes conflicting arguments.		Advocates have two years, at least, to make their cases and win over the public.
6. Keep in mind that, according to the @NORCNews poll, most people haven't heard much/haven't heard anything about M4A.		I.e., people don't know a lot about it and are still forming their opinions. Also consistent with @KaiserFamFound survey.
5. An example of a voluntary program would be the @Rosa_DeLauro @RepSchakowsky bill https://t.co/2YrA13aiBV -- which, in turn, is based on this @amprog proposal https://t.co/7KmHLzT2Ri
4. For background, an example of a mandatory program would be the @SenSanders proposal https://t.co/K4ZdcvrW15 and most likely the latest version of H.R. 676, which @RepJayapal and allies are revising and will release soon https://t.co/t01G6SHaSZ
3. Voters are generally confident that M4A (whatever their conceptions of it) would lower out-of-pocket expenses, increase covered services, and improve coverage overall. They also think it will increase U.S. spending on health care. https://t.co/LVem7aAhYQ
2. It's "another" poll, because earlier this week a @KaiserFamFound survey produced a similar result https://t.co/RRbowAH45H
1. Another poll -- this one from @NORCNews -- suggesting majority of people think "Medicare for All" means creating a government-insurance program that would be optional, not mandatory. https://t.co/cD5W9qjIcv https://t.co/f8hNLTyzm7

Another open question is the extent to which, at least on the liberal side of the debate, these ideas come to be seen as distinct options rather than points along a continuum.
And by all sides I do mean all sides, including those pushing...		- M4Everybody	- M4Anybody	- Limited Medicare or Medicaid buy-ins	- ACA tinkering		And of course promoters of conservative alternatives, too.		Each approach has pluses and minuses.
Perhaps. So difficult to know where public would come down when confronted with *all* of the arguments, pro and con. 		A lot obviously depends on who is making the arguments, how they get filtered in media,  what the situation on the ground looks like at the time, etc. https://t.co/IRPTSa6eYO

Why is this is happening? Impossible to be sure, co-author @JoanAlker1 says, but possible culprits include...		(a) Confusion from ACA repeal, CHIP funding issues	(b) Trump admin cuts to ACA outreach	(c) Chilling effect of Trump anti-immigrant policies/rhetoric		(3)
The increment is small. But during a time of economic growth, when people are getting jobs and access to employer benefits, you don't expect to see this.		Notably, the increase was substantially in larger in states that did not expand Medicaid. 		(2)

I know, I know -- this is all so straightforward. Wouldn't any leader do the same? Apparently not. 		Obviously the other critiques of her may be valid, and more important. But these basic qualifications for speaker probably matter too. (12)
Finally, everybody says, she's one of the hardest working people on Capitol Hill -- there after most members have left in the evening &amp; before most arrive in the morning. 		That bit about Ginger Rogers, dancing backwards and on heels? Throw in no sleep, and you get Pelosi. (11)
That approach also gives her credibility with ideological foes, who know that she's open to negotiation -- but that she also has core values and allies who will stand behind her. 		Here's Max Baucus 		https://t.co/KsUN8bRwq3 (10) https://t.co/O5KYpkX0gu
Pelosi doesn't seek public credit &amp; she fights for her values -- giving her the credibility, when necessary, to tell allies that it's time to cut a deal. 		This happened w/the public option, per Henry Waxman.		https://t.co/KsUN8bRwq3 (9) https://t.co/pt5T3sgCFn
Pelosi emphasizes communication w/members, so she's not surprised and they aren't either. 		She understands policy, more than you might expect, so that she can manage complex negotiations and, if need be, conduct them herself. 		Barney Frank says it showed in the ACA. (8) https://t.co/2BsfGbLHgm
In particular, they say, Pelosi knows her members, individually, better than anybody. She understands how to read them -- how to tell the difference between a yes vote that can turn to no, and a yes that will stick. 		@CecileRichards put it this way: (7) https://t.co/Ndhx7kikra
One thing we kept asking, relevant to the upcoming leadership votes: What makes Pelosi so effective? When people say she’s one of the best vote counters they’ve ever seen, what do they mean? 		Turns out there's no magic formula. It's really basic stuff. (6)
It was fun hearing from those veterans, most of whom have retired or moved onto other pursuits. Max Baucus, Cecile Richards, Bart Stupak, Henry Waxman, etc. Plus others who talked on background.		They had a lot to say and we couldn’t get all of it into the article. (5)
Today at @HuffPost -- via @jeffyoung and me -- you can read about Pelosi’s role in the ACA, the signature accomplishment of her previous stint as Speaker. https://t.co/KsUN8bRwq3		Key players, friend and foe, all agree: It wouldn’t have passed without her. (4)
Reasonable people can disagree about the validity or sincerity of these criticisms, and how much they matter. 		What is still getting lost IMHO is how well Pelosi manages a caucus and whether would-be successors would do it better. (3)

@MythiliSk Agreed. Again, seems like one answer is that she stays briefly but brings along new leadership team prepared to take over soon. But no idea if that can happen.
@MythiliSk Had an up-close view of her rounding up votes for ACA, after Scott Brown election, when other Dem leaders thought it hopeless.		People involved still marvel that she got it done. Party has changed, its time for new leadership — all true. But those abilities are hard to replace.
@MythiliSk In any event, I think there are defensible grounds for finding a new speaker. But who? And how find somebody who can lead a caucus with her proven skill? Those to me are the unanswered questions.
@MythiliSk I spoke to a lot of voters!		And to be clear I don’t actually think Pelosi is popular, even with Dems. But I also think Moulton is wrong when he reads election as a repudiation of her, explicitly or implicitly.		Also: incoming class very diverse, ideologically and otherwise.

@StephenBeban @jonathanchait @amspectator Thank you!  I probably have a looser definition of single-payer, though that's a purely subjective call and probably not one a lot of experts share.  But like you say, we can all agree that Rand Paul is making a terrible argument here.
@StephenBeban @jonathanchait @amspectator (To be clear, NZ is *not* one of the countries I know well, as you can see. So let me know if I'm wrong about the structure.)
@StephenBeban @jonathanchait @amspectator I defer to you on NZ, of course. But I thought government covers basic expenses, with private supplementary for copays etc. Is that right? I'd call that single-payer, though I know some would disagree whether it qualifies.		Regardless, point about gov't health care stands.
@Neoavatara I mean, speaking from both personal and professional experience, it's a total mess down there. Reporters can (I think) do a lot of good by exposing it.
@daveweigel @danielmarans @willmenaker @karpmj @cushbomb And to be clear I think M4A has a lot going for it. Just not sure we can tell how politics would play out in a different context. A lot depends on the skill of the politicians and parties framing the debate, of course.
@daveweigel @danielmarans @willmenaker @karpmj @cushbomb Agree about those ads. But are they more effective when (a) pre-existing conditions aren't soaking up all the attention on health care (b) we're deep into a debate about single-payer and actual trade-offs are becoming apparent? Don't know the answer.

#Michigan election P.S.A.		State Supreme Court at stake -- think abortion rights, environment, redistricting. But partisan affiliations of judicial candidates not on the ballot. 		Here's who they are:		Sam Bagenstos (D)	Megan Cavanagh (D)		Elizabeth Clement (R)	Kurtis Wilder (R)
Millions still can't afford health care. The ACA helped many, but has real and serious flaws. https://t.co/gDIrY7XUUk		A conversation about making health care affordable for *everybody* is one most Americans would probably like to have. But it doesn't look like this. (11)
Every fact-checker in the world has pointed this out. Republicans keep at it. Why?		Because they think media will cover as bothsiderism &amp; Fox won’t cover at all. 		Because they know gerrymandering, voter suppression, and natural Senate advantage protects their members. (10)
Then there's @realDonaldTrump -- he's lying about health care too.https://t.co/4tried9bEs 		In fact, his administration launched a new attack on pre-ex protections within days of a recent tweet promising not to do exactly that. (9) https://t.co/40o23i17wW
In Michigan @ElectMikeBishop talks about his wife, who has a pre-ex condition, as proof he'd never vote to take away those protections. 		But Bishop did just that, joining most House Republicans and voting for their repeal bill. (8) https://t.co/X3lo7VRJvG
In Missouri @HawleyMO insists he’d fight to protect people with pre-ex conditions. In reality, he helped launched a lawsuit -- sitting in federal court right now -- that would eliminate those protections. (7) https://t.co/zsfXMEiVSt
Republicans know this. It is why they keep lying about what they did &amp; what they would do.		You have Arizona's @MarthaMcSally saying she led fight for pre-ex protections. She didn't. 		She voted to take them away &amp; famously urged colleagues to do same. (6) https://t.co/QZZVaoSuUt
ACA was never popular, but polling is clear.		People want better coverage, not worse. To fix the problems, not go back to how things were.		Protections for pre-ex conditions, Medicaid -- they want to keep. (5) https://t.co/ZaSsbWKcuq
But numbers alone don’t capture the significance. 		This has become a stress test for American democracy -- an experiment to see whether a party can pursue a highly unpopular agenda, lie about its very purpose, and avoid political consequences. (4)
Health care for many millions of Americans are at stake. 		Real lives. Real impact. (3) https://t.co/4Toi9XvCG3
Republicans spent most of 2017 trying to repeal the ACA, including big cuts to Medicaid. 		If they control Congress after today, they will almost certainly try again. (2)	https://t.co/WtIvbfbgox
