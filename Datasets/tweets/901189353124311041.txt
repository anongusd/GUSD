@PattyMurray No we pay too many taxes. No new taxes
@PattyMurray President Trump doubled the child care deduction
@PattyMurray Patty this will cost the tax payers too much money. Many tax payers already raised their children.  It will also allow earlier indoctrination of the children.  AOC is a product of liberal indoctrination
@Chicago83772043 @PattyMurray @brownberry1717 There is a lot of money being made by planned Parenthood by selling baby organs and tissues. Hence the push for late term abortions.  Many late abortions will be done at planned Parenthood facilities because MD oppose this bill. It does not need to be done by MD
@Chicago83772043 @PattyMurray @brownberry1717 Northam also said that the date of the alive infant would be determined by the mother and the practioner.  Google Representative Kathy Tran as she describes what is allowed under the late term abortion bill
@Chicago83772043 @PattyMurray @brownberry1717 No listen to Governor Northam. He said if an infant was born alive from a failed abortion then a decision would be made regarding the infant's fate. This bill would have allowed infants who were born alive from botched abortions the right to medical care
