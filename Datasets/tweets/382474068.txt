@bornmiserable Totally agree with you! The fact that there's school shootings, and senseless murders makes it absolutely OK for women to kill their babies in the 3rd trimester.

Left wing Morons know it's wrong to kill a baby in the 3rd trimester. I can tell by your ignorant arguments (Republicans kill kids after their born) that you know it's wrong too. This is what liberal Indoctrination does to people. But go ahead and stay stuck on stupid! https://t.co/GV5sLUahKZ

@ParkerRains @PatsFan787 @fenwaysteve @KFILE I was replying to your ingorant statement about having no recollection is equivalent to pleading the 5th which is not an unequivocal denial. Which Kavanaugh did veemently deny the allegations but maybe CNN didn't tell you that.
@ParkerRains @PatsFan787 @fenwaysteve @KFILE Investigate what? An allegation that no one else will corroborate. She needs to testify but won't. She only agreed to play along because her name wasn't going to be released now that she got exposed by the same Libtards she is trying to help. She knows she is a pawn.
