@JohnQBarrett @TheJusticeDept That’s not my take on it. #JustSaying

Let’s face it there are going to be potentially more #deportations. #MuellerInvestigation (immigration judges are overloaded)

All this #DemocraticSpeculation over whether or not @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will announce #emergencysecuritymeasures over this border wall issue at the #SOTU is a pile of malarkey. DJT will seal this deal and then “they” can all keep their #partisanpocketbooks from being picked.

@realDonaldTrump With all due respect Mr. President, would you go on record to say that you #willnotpardon #MichaelCohen +that no other POTUS should? And if that is the case, then there are a lot of fingers pointing in yr direction wondering exactly when you knew what you knew &amp; who else knew it?
Okay @NicolleDWallace enough with #TheFamily because you’re starting to sound like a brainwasher. Family is important but issues like #GunControl and #ImmigrationReform matter too. Yes #Bush41 was a classy man but let’s be clear that most people aren’t born with #silverspoons.
