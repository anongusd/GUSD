@thehill ‚ÄúLook, Joe Biden ran three times. He never got more than 1 percent, and President Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did,‚Äù Trump said at the time. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to have it be Biden.‚Äù
@thehill Trump has welcomed the idea of a Biden run, having frequently feuded with the former vice president, and said running against Biden would be a ‚Äúdream‚Äù during an interview with CBS News earlier this year.
@thehill According to AP, Biden intends to spend the coming weeks deliberating with family over his next steps and is expected to make a decision in January or February.
@thehill ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm the most qualified person in the country to be president. The issues that we face as a country today are the issues that I‚Äôve worked on my whole life,‚Äù Biden, who was a senator for 36 years, told a crowd in Montana this month, according to The Missoula Current.
@thehill Age could therefore prove to be a vulnerability for Biden, and is why he is reportedly considering O‚ÄôRourke as a running mate. It may also be why he is emphasizing his experience and decades as a public servant as selling points.
@thehill Should Biden capture the presidency, he'll be the oldest person ever to win the White House. President Ronald Reagan was 73 when he won re-election, while President Trump was 70 in 2016.
@thehill ... instead of attacking one another personally, instead of going for the most base impulse and instincts among us,‚Äù he said.
@thehill "This is the mother of all tests for this democracy and whether we can run a campaign, have candidates at all levels from school board to the White House who are willing to focus on issues, on our potential, on our promise, on the future instead of our fears, ...
@thehill Even so, he offered the audience his thoughts on what the Democrats‚Äô candidate will need in 2020.
@thehill But on Friday, O'Rourke again demurred on a possible run: ‚ÄúNo decision, no decision on that,‚Äù he said during a town hall meeting in Austin, Texas.
@thehill O‚ÄôRourke himself has zoomed to the top of initial 2020 polls as a possible presidential candidate, leapfrogging prospective (but still-unannounced) candidates including Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif.
@thehill Ted Cruz, but nonetheless became a national Democratic figure who managed to pull in more than $80 million in donations -- and was the subject of multiple media profiles that zeroed in on his skateboarding and punk rock background.
@thehill Last month, O‚ÄôRourke (whose birth name is Robert Francis) lost his bid to unseat Texas Sen.
@thehill The Associated Press reports that past and current advisers to Biden, 76, have expressed some ‚Äúconcerns about age‚Äù and have raised the possibility of O‚ÄôRourke, 47, as a possible running mate.
@thehill Biden, who served as President Barack Obama‚Äôs vice president for both terms, has long been mentioned as a potential 2020 candidate after he considered a presidential run in 2016.
@thehill Former Vice President Joe Biden‚Äôs advisers, with an eye on the 2020 presidential campaign, have reportedly floated Rep. Beto O‚ÄôRourke, D-Texas, as a potential running mate -- apparently to alleviate concerns about Biden‚Äôs age.

@EdithWessex  However, as neurogeneticist Simon Fisher of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics clarified, ‚ÄúThe effects of the Neanderthal gene variants are small, you would not be able to see them in a person‚Äôs head shape when you meet them.‚Äù
@EdithWessex They compared the shapes of these braincases with MRI scans of some 4,500 people whose genetic data was also known. The data indicates Neanderthal DNA fragments in modern human chromosomes 1 and 18, which are linked to brain development, may produce less round heads.
@EdithWessex Gunz and his colleagues took computed tomography scans of seven Neanderthal skulls and 19 modern human skulls, then constructed imprints of the skulls‚Äô braincases.
According to a Live Science report, paleoanthropologist Philipp Gunz of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology suggests that modern humans who inherited certain fragments of Neanderthal DNA may have more oblong brains and skulls than other modern humans.
