@CNNPolitics That is dumb. People play video games all over the world and yet other countries do not have the rate of gun violence that the US has.
@MSNBC Trunp's view is so wrong.
@jdawsey1 That is the opposite of what Trump actually said.
@CNN None of what this White House claims make sense.

@realDonaldTrump Please try to lead. Just try. It is not about you. It is about America. It is about all of us together.

@AllenCMarshall Shakespearean (snakesperean?)
@CNNPolitics She is right!
@CNNPolitics How many teachers want to be responsible for carrying an armed weapon? Few. Very few. More guns is not the answer.
@CNN Wait, I thought he was in favor of no protests at athletic events?!
@thehill That man needs to seek help.
@CNN Cruz is wrong, again.
@MSNBC Please pass common sense gun control laws. Ban assault weapons.
@AP How many more schools and school districts are not taking these kinds of calls seriously?
@AP When will Kelly step down?
@realDonaldTrump Wait. More evidence is coming.
@thehill When is now. We need tougher gun control legislation.
@realDonaldTrump When will you begin to lead and stop moving the goal posts?
@lisamurkowski It is too extreme. Just take care of the dreamers and protect them. Forget Trump's wall.
@AP Of course. Spurred on by Trump no less. "Fine people."
@CNNPolitics Florida voters were dumb enough to re-elect him in 2016.
@thehill Do not be foolish. Gun control saves lives.
@realDonaldTrump You are too late.

@thehill Good grief.
Just because millions of us know that America can be better does not mean we do not love our country.
@realDonaldTrump Casey, Casey, Casey!
@Politics_PR This is another innocent death we can attribute to the GOP and to Trump.
@CBSNews Ths now, from the president who pumped up his campaign rallies with "Lock her up." Trump and his enablers in Congress have no real concern for due process or justice. Trump and the GOP are undeserving of support.
@FoxNews Please, God, no.
@CNNPolitics Why can't he be decent, civil? When will impeachment proceedings begin?
@MikeLevinCA Yay!
@realDonaldTrump I disagree with your decision.
@UKShakespeare Julius Caesar.
@AmandiOnAir @realDonaldTrump Yes. I was horriffied he became chief of staff.
@thinkprogress Why was he ever confirmed?!

@MattMakens Is it Mateo?
@SenFeinstein @SenSchumer Truly.
@MSNBC Let us hope so.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Can he be impeached? The sooner the better.
@AP He is worse than Nixon.
@CNNPolitics When will they get rid of Kelly? Before or after Trump is forced to leave?
@AP That is horrible.
@SenBobCorker @realDonaldTrump Please, spare any accollades. The president has not led at all on this issue.

@kylegriffin1 Talk about two-faced. Trump campaigned against NAFTA in 2016 and Ernst supported him.
@AP_Politics It was a moral shutdown. But will the GOP now support a permanent solution for DACA?
@realDonaldTrump This is the president's fault and everyone knows it.
@senrobportman Please end your majority's delays and encourage the president to lead.
@CNNPolitics It is Trump's fault.
@SenBennetCO Thank you for your continued leadership!!!
@AP I am so glad Democrats are standing tough against the failed policies of the GOP.
@AP What is the US doing about it?
@AP Why can't the Republicans govern? Why can't Trump lead?
@senrobportman You have had since September to vote for Dreamers. Sad.
@thehill So how much will Corker make from this deal?

@realDonaldTrump Everybody makes mistakes, but most journalists are professionals. America has among the world's greatest reporters and writers. Just because they write accurately and critically about your administration and you are no reasons to attack them.
