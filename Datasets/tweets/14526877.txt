"A lawsuit in CA seeks to block the Trump admin from ending #TPS for immigrants from Honduras and Nepal. In October, a judge in the same court issued an injunction that stalled the end of TPS for four other countries. But that court action does not apply to DED."
"Menyongar is among thousands of Liberian immigrants who were given temporary permission to stay in the United States in 1999, when President Clinton implemented 'deferred enforced departure.' DED was routinely extended by previous administrations."
Magdalene fled civil war in Liberia more than two decades ago. She's had permission to live and work here, and has a US citizen daughter. But come 3/31, she may be forced to leave, or stay here and become an undocumented immigrant. https://t.co/UanoWW89BK https://t.co/JUai0SFX51

Some Trump official, “who spoke on condition of anonymity,” is denying the report that @DanScavino knew about undoc workers at the Trump golf club he once managed.		Why won’t Dan comment on the record about this? 🤔		https://t.co/Gl05gk3SOB
Other workers have alleged that management knew about their fake papers. Banquet chef Jesus Lira said “that, on two occasions in 2008, an accountant at the Trump club rejected his fake documents and told him to go obtain better ones.”
Gabriel Sedano, an undoc worked who just fired after yrs at Trump’s club, said Scavino “was involved in the hiring. If they needed more ppl, he would always have to say yes because he was the general manager. Everything went up to him.”

RT @FrankSharry: Terrific SOTU Spanish language speech by @AGBecerra. See thread 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼 https://t.co/BFHEsxg2kT
.@XavierBecerra: "These are critical steps to strengthen our democracy. And w/faith and the strength of our labor, and w/respect to the different contributions of the American ppl, the US can continue to own the American Dream." #SOTU
.@XavierBecerra: "Permanent protection for the Dreamers ... laws to protect the water we drink and the air we breathe ... comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken system ... in the courts and in Congress, we have to fight for our agenda." #SOTU
.@XavierBecerra: "Our system of government rewards whoever participates.  And with 66,000 Latino citizens reaching 18 years of age, the voting age, every month, we have many hands to reward. Imagine if we had the power to decide this nation’s political agenda." #SOTU
.@XavierBecerra says Republicans "are putting a wall between you and the voting booth. I have news for you: they failed. Last November, during the non-presidential elections, Latinos, especially young people, came out to vote in historic numbers. Thank you." #SOTU
.@XavierBecerra: "I know I am the product of those who fought to open the doors of opportunity. The optimism that characterizes the waves of immigrants who have come here runs through my blood ... it is because people like my parents ... built this country." #SOTU
.@XavierBecerra: "I am the son of working immigrants and the first in my family to walk through the doors of a university. My parents began their life together in the US for the same reason that many other families come: to work hard and give their children a better life." #SOTU https://t.co/bUcsXpVBPq
.@XavierBecerra's Spanish-language response to the #SOTU is starting soon. Tune in here ➡️: https://t.co/GpmK8tqMig #SOTU
Reps. @AOC and @RashidaTlaib are both wearing pins bearing the image of Jakelin Ameí Rosmery Caal Maquin, one of the two children who died in immigration custody in December.		Tlaib's Instagram caption: "We are bringing Jakelin into the room with us during the #SOTU." https://t.co/3jQ032lj4P
Cindy tells her husband and others who are also living in fear to not "lose hope. If you give up and throw in the towel, they’ll walk all over you. Never give up hope. Always continue to fight." #SOTU
The family has struggled in his absence, but his wife Cindy is determined to help others. "I can lock myself up in my room, sit and cry with a bowl of ice cream ... but I don't gain anything from that, and neither do the people that need my help." https://t.co/cOJtgb7qtQ #SOTU
Remember the families that are no longer together. One year ago last month, Michigan's Jorge Garcia was deported after living here for three decades. He had no criminal record and had spent over $125,000 trying to adjust his status. #SOTU https://t.co/bW43zDD9A0 https://t.co/v7L1hiqYLg
Despite the risks, Jin will pursue his dreams and study in England later this yr. He hopes for permanent protections not just for himself, but for all of immigrant families. "We stand among you and we are embedded in this country, its practices and its institutions." #SOTU
Even though Jin is American in every single way but on paper, he fears that if he goes overseas to study, he may not be able to return home to the US. "We are your co-workers, your friends, your classmates and your fellow Americans—we work, learn and laugh alongside you." #SOTU
Jin Park is also in the #SOTU audience tonight. He's the first #DACA recipient to win the prestigious Rhodes scholarship: https://t.co/hnHHLOqRMJ
Linda said she's been able to create a new life here after fleeing civil war in Liberia. She deserves a chance to keep thriving here. "Donald Trump shld be ashamed of himself for deliberately targeting ppl like me. [I] hope the President will listen to my story.” #SOTU
Another #SOTU guest is Minnesotan Linda Clark, invited by Rep. @Ilhan. She's lived here for nearly 20 years but could now be deported following Trump's #DED termination: https://t.co/E6ozLf3I7m https://t.co/RaT24O8qoA
Today is also Yakelin's 12th birthday. She's excited she's been able to spend it in Washington, DC and touring @SenJeffMerkley's office. “I just feel so happy to have this big opportunity, to be so little and actually meet a senator!” #SOTU
Albertina and Yakelin spent nearly two months apart, some of that spent looking for where Yakelin was being detained. When they were reunited, Albertina said “I hugged her so tightly and now this time I couldn’t stop crying bc I was so happy instead of being so sad!” #SOTU
Albertina and 12-year-old Yakelin, asylum seekers separated at the border last year, are also guests at the #SOTU tonight. They have a message for the president: 		“Don’t keep telling us that we are lesser, because we are all equal." 		https://t.co/dVLyBWXaDd #SOTU
Victorina is one of the number of undoc immigrants who have stepped forward to say they worked at a Trump business.		"We are starting to raise our voices, and no one is going to silence us anymore." #SOTU

Yes, while Donald Trump demonizes undoc immigrants for political gain, he’s also perfectly happy to exploit their labor. Here undoc workers recently fired from his Westchester resort speak out. https://t.co/jNN2IIWPzy https://t.co/U0vhVVa4KH
This is just the latest Trump resort revealed to have been employing undoc immigrants. In December, Victorina Morales, former housekeeper at his Bedminster resort, bravely stepped forward to tell her story: https://t.co/g4nwlYi5LX
Attorney Anibal Romero said that "the Trump Organization has shown 'a pattern and practice of hiring undocumented immigrants, not only in New Jersey, but also in New York ... we are demanding a full and thorough investigation from federal authorities."
One undoc worker at Trump's Westminster club worked there for 8 yrs. She was just fired. Housekeeper Margarita Cruz: “They said absolutely nothing. They never said, 'Your social security number is bad' or 'Something is wrong,' Nothing. Nothing. Until right now.”
The firings—previously unreported—follow last yr’s revelations of undoc labor at a Trump club in NJ, where employees were subsequently dismissed. The firings show Trump’s business was relying on undoc workers even as the president demanded a wall to keep out such immigrants."
"On Jan. 18, about a dozen employees at Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., were summoned, one by one, to talk w/a human resources executive from Trump headquarters. During the meetings, they were fired bc they are undoc immigrants." https://t.co/2s8nXqm1aR

In one instance, Burks managed to get a hold one of dying man’s mom. “Her son was a sinner, the woman told Burks. She didn’t know what was wrong with him and didn’t care. She wouldn’t come, as he was already dead to her as far as she was concerned.”

Morales "said she was not the only worker at the club who was in the country illegally. Sandra Diaz, 46, a native of Costa Rica who is now a legal resident of the US, said she, too, was undocumented when she worked at Bedminster between 2010 and 2013."
