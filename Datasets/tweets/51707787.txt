Great work on a tight deadline by @seanokey https://t.co/lkRiSikaux
@dataeditor Really amazing work. Might well be my favorite from you guys this year -- and there have been many good ones.

@seecmb Yes
@seecmb Just append the circle directly to the parent group of the path and supply cx and cy? No need for a marker unless you plan to append multiple.
Can't recommend this piece by @MLBombard on what really holds low-income students back in the education system, and how it drives generational inequality, enough. https://t.co/Nx2A8nkFbK
@LazaroGamio Whooa this is great.
@dataeditor What's your go-to for parsing pdfs?
@SeanMcElwee @NathanKalmoe @MattGrossmann @ElectoralStdies This is great.. but the idea that the mixed effects model is simple and multi-level Bayesian is some kind of voo-doo is silly. Would really gave been good to throw it in the mix here, and disappointing to see that angle.
@oliverdarcy Totally agree..
@rsimmon @moritz_stefaner @FILWD @jscarto @kbschloss @datastories @Mbussonn The saturation issue Is fair. The creators did create Viscm to construct more ranges. https://t.co/krQGSMWucX
@moritz_stefaner @FILWD @rsimmon @jscarto @kbschloss @datastories @Mbussonn Why not use one of the matplotlib scales? Addresses color blindness and uniformity issues and the interpolation issues with LAB. https://t.co/MSKVWlTgKd
@Rich_Harris Likewise, my i key doesn't work. Have to carry around a bluetooth keyboard now (with three dongles).
@gelliottmorris Sorry -- GAM, not GMA.

@albertocairo @TylerDinucci It's from Cleveland's '85 follow-up paper to his '84 perception study. "Graphical Perception and Graphical Methods for Analyzing Scientific Data"
@jamesscottbrown @mathisonian Awesome, thank you. Feel free to pass on.
@seecmb I mean, this is why frameworks in general are trouble. But at least v4 is modular. You can skip the parser if you don't need it.
@seecmb Oh, yeah I misread your keys names. Glad someone could help there.
Thanks to @mathisonian for getting the data viz research papers Github repo up. With another round of contributions, it now has around 50 great data visualization research papers. I hope to be writing an article on Medium soon with findings. https://t.co/ffz1bfHo5v
@ericgeller Feeling for you today, @riordan
@EconAndrew @albertocairo It is odd. But I think having it on that 0-1 scale is helpful in thinking through the comparison.
@seecmb You might just start with his map function (at the var cities line..).. might save time. You'll need a way to handle the 1 to "one" naming of the keys though.
@seecmb Misternester and the nest examples pages are usually helpful. https://t.co/0uhyMglunZ
@seecmb The nested "values" structure d3 examples usually can be generated with d3.nest(). Have you tried?
@TylerDinucci Sure but the generic ballot as House forecasting tool debates really started in earnest earlier this year. It's the most relevant comparison point for the current discussion.
@TylerDinucci @albertocairo It's half of what it was in January?
This is the classic graph on this phenomenon. We're terrible at estimating length on a slope. @TylerDinucci @albertocairo https://t.co/U86LOppEw7
By eye, the difference looks to be about half of what it was a few months ago. So, quite a bit has changed.
This is partly a visualization problem. It's difficult to perform the vertical difference calculation of the lines by eye in the 538 chart. Would be better to display the difference for people so the trend is clearer. https://t.co/ruPAgYDftV
@ActorAaronBooth @gelliottmorris You could automate this..  Read as fwf in R, trimws, sptstring, then dplyr::group_by and summarize?
There's also a @eagereyes user study on connected scatter plots that found audiences like them a lot. Who knew there was so much evidence out there..
I didn't realize someone had done a user study on scrollers vs. steppers. They performed about the same (within MOE) but the authors admit that a study across more devices would likely have yielded different results. https://t.co/1HQJ3lWaQa https://t.co/47FgLf4433

@databyler That's a good thought!

4/ Once someone enrolls in DACA, their behavior starts to closely align with the general US population. You can't be in a good job or in college in the shadows.
3/ DACA recipients are high-skilled. They're in white collar jobs at similar rates as the overall population. Non-DACA eligible unauthorized immigrants are in construction and other manual labor jobs.
2/ Average age a DACA recipient came to the US is 6.5 years old. They arrived young. But the average recipient age is mid-20s. These are working-age people, not young DREAMers.
1/ More than 140 countries claim at least 10 DACA recipients as their place of birth. More than 7,000 recipients are from South Korea. It's not just a southern border policy.

Five Things We Learned About the Presidential Campaign Last Week https://t.co/fyuUcEOhjI
@_alastair @dkiesow Yeah, the idea that an app you give data about your ever-waking movements to couldn't infer age seems unlikely.
@dkiesow @_alastair More clarity into surveying is always appreciated, I agree. Like, Age can be inferred by survey. Possible 4Sq did so.
@dkiesow @_alastair 3/ And Trump himself has said himself that his campaign will hurt his businesses. So the data is a useful window.
@dkiesow @_alastair 2/ Their data has had utility in the past (see: https://t.co/2MxfGqARm5)
@dkiesow @_alastair 1/ Also I'd argue it's clear the data is just a sample. Whether the sample is valuable is good to be skeptical of
@dkiesow @_alastair Same is true of polling data. That's what post-stratification and normalization correct. 4Sq said they did so.
@dkiesow @_alastair Thing is, this includes passive data So it's really anyone's that's installed the app and left data collection on.
