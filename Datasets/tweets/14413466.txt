@mcimaps *Everyone who matters....
Let's be clear: Everyone in both parties had minds made up before yesterday's hearing. Why? Because Dems promised to do so in their campaigns after GOP AG and gov held it up, and Repubs were bound to oppose because NRA (guns) scares them more than NRA (casinos) and because..NV!

Most Republicans are asking focused questions on bill language as opposed to fulminations by outside groups. Dems are just tossing softballs to reinforce the premise of the bill. Nevertheless -- spoiler alert! -- the bill will pass, this is theater and NRA or someone will sue.

Plenty of exemptions, especially on temporary transfers if the seller "has no reason to believe" buyer is prohibited from buying firearms or will use gun in commission of a crime. Pretty broad language there, so I'm sure this will win NRA support.
New background checks bill repeals law passed by voters in '16 and never implemented, then restores w/adjustments to try to solve problems pointed out by then gov &amp; AG. But because Constitution says can't change initiative language for 3 yrs, wouldn't take effect until Jan. '20.

Let me address Trump saying Heller lost because he didn't get the GOP base. No evidence to back this up. I know it will surprise people that POTUS made a fact-free claim, but all data show Heller lost because of his constant inconstancy and because Trump energized Dem base.
@msgoddessrises I saw. Sad.

It's a slippery slope when you start talking about not giving groups platforms. CSIG is not the Klan. But I get the strong feelings! I play online.
@elizthompsn @AdamLoebSmall @brianpempus I appreciate you chiming in, Adam, and for your support. Lincoln is a former senator and if we get in the business of nixing pieces just because of who funds the group, we will have a thin op-ed page.

The message in this Stacey Abrams speech is good, but the weird setup/green screen/people standing behind here is not exactly Bob Fosse choreography.
This speech really feels like 10 people wrote it and things were cut and pasted in a completely irrational way. This ending is only part that feels it is in the right place.
Prepared remarks: "your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation."		Trump: "your presence this evening is very much appreciated."		Good #Trumpadlib
Whoever wrote this speech missed the English course called: "Transitions are good."
"They do bad, bad things."		#Trumpadlibs on Iran
"Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will NEVER be a socialist country."		HUGE.
"If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea."		Thing that was said.
An ad lib every other sentence now. He's rolling, like Belushi in "Animal House."
"We will stop it fast."		#Trumpadlibs
"like they haven't had delivered to them for a long time..."		I knew the Valium would wear off and the ad libs would start.
"....we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."		Most bipartisan president ever?

"I am the great unifier, I love veterans and I helped imprisoned minorities. Oh, and one more thing: THE CARAVANS ARE COMING."
Prepared remarks: "secure our Southern Border."		Trump: "secure our very dangerous Southern Border."
"And tonight, I am announcing that I have switched to the Democratic Party."
Pence fake smile&gt;Schumer fake smile.
"ridiculous partisan investigations."
THE STATE OF OUR UNION IS STRONG.

And, it must be said, in a state once known as The Mississippi of the West because of imbued racism and de facto segregation, the fact that two African-Americans are leading the houses for the second session in a row is significant. This is not old Nevada; this is New Nevada.
In a state long ruled by a Good Old Boys Network in gaming and politics, the historic female-majority Legislature is symbolically and substantively important. People can sneer (and I have) about too much identity politics infecting too many discussions, but this means something.

5. This will be a real test for the Nevada Gaming Commission. In NV's bifurcated system, commission has always been seen as weaker, susceptible to political pressure and not nearly as tough or expert as control board. In #MeToo era, this is a watershed moment for commission. 3/3
4. The amount of the fine is going to be interesting. If a casino owner deserved a $1.5M fine 30 years ago for having Hitler birthday parties (yes, that happened), what does serial sexual harassment and worse deserve? What's tricky is Wynn is gone. Sins of the previous owner...2/

@JeffScheid @jlnevadasmith Nevada has come a long way, from being "The Mississippi of The West" to having two African-Americans as the leaders of the Legislature, an A-A congressman and an A-A chairman of the Democratic Party. When I started covering politics in 1986, I never would have dreamed it.

Funny thing is that even as Republicans try to show relevance, even if it took two-thirds to extend taxes (because that is an increase, you know), there's further gimmickry to make up the $$ and my guess is @GovSisolak could get a Republicans or two to flip. 120 days=long time.

@SteveSebelius You are a denier.
@SandraChereb Yes, he did say that. They never sunset. Raggio was author of this idea, as I recall.
Truth about sunsetting taxes:	1. Sunsets are a budget gimmick.	2. Extending sunsets is a budget gimmick.	3. People and businesses that rely on certainty and build budgets based on sunsets think extensions are increases. They also foolishly trust #nvleg to keep sunset promises.
This is an A-plus tweet about taxes and sunsets. https://t.co/Ncu3HKMKR3

Short assessment of Sisolak's State of  State: being more liberal than the libs ever thought he would be to own the libs.
The amazing Team @TheNVIndy already has a story up about the State of the State: https://t.co/7QQHNWa1Kk https://t.co/R4qZQpZ3xs
Sisolak breaks down at end, saying being gov is "honor of a lifetime." Nothing about the guy is affected, for good or ill.
"We must not forget what can happen when civil discourse turns into partisan gamesmanship – it’s the people who ultimately lose."	@GovSisolak 		One way to stop it is to have one party control everything. No partisanship then, amirite?
Extended early voting period and same-day registration and motor-voter registration!		The Republican Party had a good run here, but that time has passed.
Sisolak was very emotional during his inaugural speech. He has choked up a few times during this speech. But not nearly so much.
This is something: "I am opening a Governor’s Office for New Americans — which will support our newest neighbors, help them navigate government services, build new businesses, and let them know that they are welcome here. It will also provide assistance to DACA recipients...."
Sisolak is against Yucca Mountain!		Exclusive, must credit.
"I will not spend a single second debating the reality of climate change."	@GovSisolak 		Seems controversial.		It's super-cold here and there is snow on the ground.
"...the largest investment of general fund dollars to the Department of Health and Human Services in Nevada history," @GovSisolak says, proposing higher Medicaid reimbursement rates and more access to mental health services. 	Elections, consequences, etc.
On guns, @GovSisolak says he is working with #nvleg to implement background checks that have been stymied by legal wrangling. He also proposes outlawing bump stocks. And: "Those who have retraining orders should not be allowed to buy a firearm."	Elections, consequences, etc.
Arguably most dramatic announcement in entire speech is to allow state employees to collectively bargain, which conservative lawmakers have long argued would bust the budget and make legislators less relevant.
Cannabis Compliance Board will be "gold standard" for managing the industry, @GovSisolak says. "Gold standard" is phrase often used for state's regulation of gaming. That is no accident. Industries are similar in possibilities for corruption, especially in infancy.
Read his lips. https://t.co/u7gH28ZeTH
"The State of the State is full of opportunity."		(Republicans probably believe he is talking about Opportunity Scholarships, a form of school choice.)
Huge applause when Sisolak refers to female-majority Legislature, first in country's history.
One of first things @GovSisolak does is acknowledge recent passing of Paul Laxalt. He defeated his grandson, @adamlaxalt. Nice.
This is always the happiest night of the year in Carson City. So much goodwill, hope and bipartisanship. Even kids singing. And then....		I am sure this year will be different.		Spoiler: I always say that.
@BobMooreNV @RileySnyder @MichelleRindels @TheNVIndy Maybe.

Drinking game for tonight's State of the State:	"Brian Sandoval"	"I look forward to working with..."	"My fellow Nevadans"	"I am doing this without raising taxes."	"The children are our future."	"I learned from talking to Nevadans last year..."	"We will have our differences..."

@MichelleRindels “The statute has been misinterpreted from the beginning. It was intended to protect doctors and patients as a privacy issue....In effect, it denies the public the opportunity to scrutinize the process and make sure it’s being conducted fairly and openly.”

@RayetteFuss Not about better themselves. It's about keeping a commitment.
@GovSisolak @davidbobzien I'm much more bothered by electeds who run for other offices and don't have to resign. That should be banned. But in an age where voters have less faith than ever in electeds, running for a term unless something better comes along remains prevalent attitude. Thus endeth rant. 4/4
@GovSisolak @davidbobzien I don't mean to single out @davidbozien, although he has done this twice -- leaving for the council a month after winning re-election to the Assembly in 2014 and now leaving at midterm of his council term. 3/
@GovSisolak @davidbobzien But the appointment of @davidbobzien raises an issue that has irked me ever since I first started covering politics -- the failure of elected officials to fulfill a commitment to voters to serve a full term. They should only leave under extraordinary circumstances. 2/
Short thread on @GovSisolak's appointments so far: Almost uniformly superb. Considering Dems have been out of power in the exec branch for 20 years, he has been creative and smart in finding people. That includes @davidbobzien for the Office of Energy. He knows a lot about it. 1/

@ByBenSpillman @AnjeanetteDamon @usnico Can we fight about that?
@AnjeanetteDamon @ByBenSpillman @usnico I'm done, your grace.
@AnjeanetteDamon @ByBenSpillman @usnico I don't demand anything. His attack was illogical. You read all the material? You don't know everything. But you feel entitled to publish your opinion anyhow, which is your right.
Extremism in defense of @TheNVIndy is no vice.
@ByBenSpillman @AnjeanetteDamon @usnico I don't have to click -- known unknowns?
@ByBenSpillman @AnjeanetteDamon @usnico It's very easy for people to throw rocks from the sidelines or from their narrow perches. Much more difficult to be inside it. And if Anjeanette thinks there are great journalists inside the Indy, ask yourself: Why did they support the decision?
@ByBenSpillman @AnjeanetteDamon @usnico I didn't say she didn't have the right. Of course she does. But she mischaracterized what her friend said. He did not offer "honest criticisms.". He just spouted off. I would assume people -- especially journalists -- would not declare sides when they can't have all the facts.
@AnjeanetteDamon @usnico You don't agree with it, eh? Because you have all the facts, of course. You were in on all of the meetings we had. You know all the considerations. You know all of the -- what is the word? -- nuances?  Oh, and name-calling? Honest criticisms? Really? Did you read his tweets?
@usnico Ah, the black and white world of the ivory tower where pointing out logical infirmities is called bullying. Not defensive at all. I was transparent. Instructor Snowflake, you stand not w/dignity but intellectual vapidity. I shall now do what your students, alas, can't: Mute you.
@usnico Sorry for promoting you (see your pinned tweet). It's bad because:	1. It's poorly written.	2. It makes it sound as if there were #MeToo allegations at The Indy.	3. We never said we were too small or afraid of lawsuits.	4. The last part is a non sequitur. 	I hope this helps.

"All good questions. Bye," Reid says at end of radio interview. He never says goodbye!
"I believe Brian Sandoval will go down as one of NV's really, really good governors," Reid says. Says left federal bench to save NV GOP. Reid has all but acknowledged he appointed him to take him out of politics. Great NV irony: Sandoval left bench to run against Reid's son.
Reid says Obama called him after re-elect and told him, "You're the reason I'm here." (Reid was first or one of first to broach idea to Obama that he should run.)
Reid asked if he was the one who is "amoral" by what he said about Romney. Reid says he was vindicated by release of Romney's returns that showed he paid very low rate.
Reid said he went to Salt Lake City and met with Romney after all of it, brokered by ex-Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. Wow.
Here comes the Romney/taxes question.		And Reid won't even let him ask it.		"I didn't make up the fact that on his taxes he didn't pay his fair share."		Well.....
Reid says Trump's election was "an aberration." Says he recently talked to Bill and told him Hillary "couldn't have done anything different."
Who does Reid like for president?		Says Biden came t spend time with him and his wife.		Says Klobuchar, Harris, Steyer have called.		"Any of them would be good. That doesn't mean I am going to be out beating the bushes for any of them," says doesn't want to undermine caucus.
"I think the world of Chuck Schumer."		---Reid when asked if Schumer is effective, sounding like an owner giving a manager vote of confidence		"As for second-guessing Chuck Schumer, I'm not going to do it."
"What more is it going to take...we hold a record most people killed in a terrorist act, that man at Mandalay Bay....What more is it going to take?"		---Reid on action on guns
@aedwardslevy I have polled this, and this is the best worst tweet of all time. Will send crosstabs.
Reid said he is going to talk today to someone in Congress to discuss accounts from pilots who have seen strange stuff.
"I personally don't know if there exists little green men other places. I kind of doubt that."	----Harry Reid on Area 51 and a program he supported: https://t.co/xLI9YbYruO

One of my favorite things about @_JRobison's piece on sexual misconduct at Adelson's paper is that his pet columnist wrote a ridiculous and inaccurate piece today (!) that had a headline about a Dem pol -wait for it - "protecting a sexual harasser." You can't make this stuff up.
@_JRobison "Editor" of Adelson's paper, who frequently brags about transparency and hires lawyers to seek public records, refused to talk about what has happened at his own paper. The Courage of Glenn Cook, soon out in hardcover. https://t.co/Cl6E7AGuPJ
@_JRobison "Between April 2017 and February 2018, the (RJ) was the subject of at least three harassment and discrimination filings with the (EEOC)...at least two payouts involving nondisclosure agreements...and internal complaints... that the office atmosphere was hostile and abusive."
@_JRobison "But more than 15 other current and former Review-Journal employees and vendors, in interviews conducted over 14 months, said that Moyer’s “'erk off' comment—he, too, declined to speak for this story, as did Moon—was among a number of inappropriate behaviors..."

“We were broken on 1 October, but I’ve never been more proud to be a Nevadan than as I was that day. This state, battle-born in the fires of the Civil War, has always been a model of a fierce belief in the power of unity. “ — Gov. Sisolak, who did extended riff on Oct. 1 tragedy
“I’m committed to cracking down on the rising cost of prescription drugs…blocking any effort to roll back protections for pre-existing conditions…protecting access to women’s health care…and defending a woman’s right to make her own medical decisions. “ —Gov. Sisolak
Light rain starts falling during speech. Luckily, record amount in Rainy Day Fund!		Also: Speak faster, gov!
Piggly Wiggly makes first-ever appearance in an inaugural!	#PigglyWigglyMatters
Requisite Lincoln quote in inaugural address: “Abraham Lincoln once said: To paraphrase,  ‘I like to see a person proud of the place he lives. I like to see a person live so that his place will be proud of him.’”

@RepKihuen "...Kihuen had threatened to 'destroy me' when he learned... I had complained about his behavior... Is the congressman also sorry for threatening me because I made a private complaint about his behavior, or is he only sorry for making me feel 'disrespected and uncomfortable?'”
@NathanWurtzel It really is.
@RepKihuen "At interviews, potential employers seemed perplexed by my previous career path. I was told often that they were looking for someone with previous work experience more similar to what their organization does....years later, I have yet to find a position that pays as well..."
@NathanWurtzel Maybe so. But that's minor -- she's not an expert -- and hardly diminishes the wrenching experience she went through.
@RepKihuen "I eventually found a new position with a campaign near my parent’s house that made it easy to relocate home, but I still had to take a pay cut to accept this new position....Had anyone considered the financial burden, and career impact, this experience had on me?"
@RepKihuen "The fear I felt while I was still employed by the Kihuen campaign – not feeling respected or safe from harassment in my current position, and not knowing what my source of income would be if I quit the campaign immediately – was very much on my mind when I saw the report."
@RepKihuen "Is the congressman also sorry for the amount of money witnesses spent on legal counsel for an investigation that they didn’t ask for? Is he sorry for the invasive experiences witnesses went through...."

Yet just two years later — after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal health-care law couldn’t force states to expand their Medicaid programs, but gave them discretion to do so — Sandoval became the first Republican governor to opt in to Medicaid expansion.
During his first gubernatorial campaign, Sandoval was no fan of the (ACA).....(he)said that the Affordable Care Act “fails to reduce costs on small businesses, increases costs to states and is completely at odds with the transparency promised by our country’s leaders.”
Please take the time to read the second installment of our five-part retrospective of The Sandoval Years, this one focusing on his health-care policies and legacy. https://t.co/SAbE7vxlTn
So @RepKihuen, leaving Congress in disgrace after sexually harassing women and being chided by ethics panel and now preparing to run 4 Vegas council, sent out what looks like a campaign mailer at taxpayer expense.

So much great stuff in this @MichelleRindels piece on @GovSandoval's career, the first of five parts. So rare to hear from the gov's family, his 2010 foe named Reid, many others. The "goodie-two-shoes" who grew up to be one of the state's greatest governors. https://t.co/ALLRTfBrWS

@MarkLeibovich @MichelleRindels @GovSandoval Beyond the Reid quote, you should read Part 1 of our five-part Sandoval retrospective. His term ends Monday.
@MarkLeibovich @MichelleRindels @GovSandoval “I of course always try to have a good understanding of my friends. I try to have a good understanding of my potential adversaries. And I thought, well, maybe he could be an adversary so if he’s going to be, I want to be on good terms with him. So that’s why I did that.”
As good as the @MarkLeibovich piece on Reid is, the best Reid quote of the day -- and one of his best ever -- is his on the record admission to @MichelleRindels	that he appointed @GovSandoval to the bench to take him out of a possible Senate challenge. https://t.co/Eb0emDt61U
Classic @MarkLeibovich treatment of Harry Reid, whom he interviewed in his home as he contemplated his own mortality, the president's amorality and, even if unspoken, Schumer's banality. https://t.co/oSoJ5bwS0O https://t.co/ztFn1w2omp

I first saw Penny Marshall in "The Odd Couple," one of the best sitcoms of all time (even better than the movie). "Laverne and Shirley" is part of the TVlogue of my youth. And "A League of Their Own" has some quite memorable moments. RIP.

I was put on the Raiders press list a long time ago, which is understandable, perhaps. Now I have inexplicably been put on the Broncos press list, too. Great, two teams that suck.
@TheRenodoc @MarkAmodeiNV2 Of course they would.
Bottom line: Trump makes these picks with no obvious algorithm other than capriciousness or someone’s name passes Sean Hannity’s lips. So no telling if Heller has a real chance. But would be history: First NV Cabinet secretary ever, hard to argue not good for state. 4/4
As for Laxalt, he was not qualified to be AG or gov, certainly not qualified to be a Cabinet secretary. That's substantively relevant, politically irrelevant. He has friends in DC and his Trump suck-up level only a few notches below Heller, so he might have a shot. 3/
Sandoval also is clearly qualified and unlike others, not recently rejected by voters. Long CV, smart. But unlike Heller, he does not think “everything you touch turns to gold, Mr. President.” Quite the contrary. Substantively irrelevant, politically relevant. So no chance. 2/
Brief thread on Heller/Sandoval/Laxalt for DOI: Of course Heller is "qualified" -- in Congress since '07, knows issues, certainly meets the minimum threshold, Trump Admin or any other. Whether he has “earned” it is diff ?, substantively relevant but politically irrelevant. 1/

Dems now coming into my feed saying Clinton and Kihuen are different, that Dems handle these sex scandals by cashiering theirs while Republicans elevate theirs are pathetic. Fact: Two state senators who were predators in Carson City for years and protected were Democrats.

We should step back a moment and give credit to the three brave women who came forward to expose @RepKihuen. He may try to minimize what he did to women he held power over, but it was traumatic for all of them, as they detailed to @BuzzFeedNews and to us.

The only contrition here is the Clintonian effort to maintain his viability in the political system. In a state with so many women in positions of power, with so many women who have been exposed to Kihuen's behavior, that viability is nil.
If you read the report, which we will embed, the probe amounted to this: Kihuen denied everything, but the panel corroborated everything. None of this was immaturity or overconfidence. This is the behavior of a predator now in black and white, not obscured by his faux contrition.
"grabbing her buttocks, messages asking her to come and sit on his lap, asking her what color her panties were, suggesting she would look good naked, and messages suggesting, through the use of emojis, that they make a sex tape..."	Yes, very immature and overconfident.
Kihuen: "It saddens me greatly to think I made any woman feel that way due to my own immaturity and overconfidence."		He's 38. https://t.co/97fmnn8K2B
"Kihuen generally denied the allegations of unwanted advances. Despite	(those) denials, each of the complainant’s allegations were supported by	documentary evidence and some of the alleged incidents were corroborated by third party witnesses."	---House Ethics report
At one time, @RepKihuen was considered a Democratic Party rising star and a prime recruit of @SenatorReid. He actually wanted to run for Senate this cycle before allegations surfaced. But even before that, @dscc had settled on @RepJackyRosen as its choice. Bullet dodged.
We will have a story up soon @TheNVIndy on House Ethics coming down on @RepKihuen. I'd say odds of him still running for council (election is next spring) are at worst 50-50. And chances @Coffin4Council will endorse him as replacement? About the same.

@LPDonovan 2014 was an outlier year in so many ways. They lost every constitutional office. Now they have all but one. They lost both houses of the Leg. Gained back in '16, now they have near supermajorities in both and will probably get there in 2020. And they will control reapportionment.
@LPDonovan They already had substantive leads in both chambers. They took two of three seats in play in Senate and all in Assembly.
@TeresaKopec Thinking of writing abut that, actually.
NV blue wave?	There were 6 GOP constitutional officers; now: 1.	There was a GOP U.S. senator before Tues; not anymore.	2 at-risk D House districts stayed D. Large margins.	There were 27 D Assembly seats; now: 29.	There were 11 D state Senate seats; now: 13.	That is a wave.

Every major race in Nevada is decided except for a handful of legislative races. A thousand or so mail ballots in Clark being counted. Dems will have supermajority in one house and, it appears, fall one short of a supermajority in the other. https://t.co/uqSRXhfkOM

Clark in, big leads for Sisolak and Rosen. This is almost over.
Washoe election day reporting 30K votes. Dem leads holding.
Sisolak up 52-44 in Washoe. Again, killer.
Washoe numbers: Rosen up 53-43 in early/mail. That is devastating for Heller.
Laxalt up by almost identical margin to Heller in rurals -- 17K. Bundy at 3 percent, 1,200 votes.
Heller up 16K in rurals so far, probably will get to at least double that. Clark/Washoe margins will be key.
Tune into IndyTV: @rileysnyder and @mesgnmesserly are results machines. 	https://t.co/yNKJCnkNG9

Our @meganmesserly and @RileySnyder just extracted data from Nye showing 22,000 Rs and 10,000 Ds turned out. That's a good result for GOP. Keep an eye on those numbers from Lyon, Elko and Douglas, too.

I'll be live on IndyTV in a few minutes, so:	1. Watch Clark early/mail numbers after 7 PM. Will be big %age of vote.  If GOP candidates down by double-digits: Danger, Will Robinson!	2. Watch Washoe. Big day for GOP there, could save Heller. Turn on: https://t.co/liqw3oLFp7
I am told the Dem lead in Clark is now closing in on 9 percent. It has been creeping up all day.
@AaroninReno Sounds right.
I am told there are long lines everywhere in Clark. So those GOP poll watchers better settle in for a bit.
With an hour left until the polls close (unless people in line), 196,000 have voted in Clark. Looks like it will get to between 210K and 220K.		No. I do not have current partisan breakdowns.
@TeresaKopec It's difficult to go out on a limb and predict. Everyone is fallible. Few do it publicly.

@jane_probett Are you an idiot in real life, too?
Going to be interesting to see what post 5 PM surge does to turnout and margins. Seems clear now that turnout in state today will blow past 300K. GOP crushing it in Washoe and doing well in rurals but Dem margin in populous Clark growing. Overall turnout will be 925K or more.
@MahsaWho @DeanHeller @KTNV @HillaryClinton Hi, pal.
Dems continue to inch upwards in Clark:	57,885 Ds 	46,102 Rs 	31,249 indies 	8,014 others	143,250 total turnout  	11,783 raw vote lead 	8.2 %
Check this out. Very interesting age distribution today in Clark. https://t.co/MZoG5Ta4bB
The SOS has updated its statewide turnout numbers, but not for Clark and Washoe:	https://t.co/BLAwjl3M6q		Looks as if 25K or so have turned out in rurals. If Dems really getting crushed there, GOP could pick up 10,000 votes.
Washoe numbers as of 2 PM:		Total34,486	Dem10,91632%	Rep       14,27041%	Other9,30027%		So Rs ahead by 3,300 ballots -- 1,600 if you subtract Dem early vote lead.		As I said, Repubs will win eEection Day by upwards of 5,000, maybe 6,000 in Washoe.
Based on these early numbers, here's what we know: Dem ballot gains in Clark are canceling out usual Election Day losses in Washoe and rurals. So it comes down to this: If GOP getting crossover votes and/or indies going their way, the marquee races will be tight. If not....
This is current Clark Election Day vote as of 45 mins ago. Dems up 8 points in Clark. 10,000 votes. https://t.co/VcYOX8VsWD
Washoe is going big today to the GOP, now up 13 percent. Probably going to win Election Day by at least 5,000 ballots at this rate. Rs won by 5,500 ballots on Election Day in 2016, 7,500 in 2014. Won't be much different, I'd guess.
@matthew8786 @TheNVIndy Good tweet.
For those of you claiming the races are over based on partial turnout numbers, please take note:		https://t.co/3bXQif2sot
By the way, all the TRO says is for the registrar to do his job, follow the law. https://t.co/7RvtgY7xks
Washoe turnout up to 34K. If GOP still up by 10 points, that means they have about a 3,500 raw ballot lead.
Here's the friendly face of the NV GOP chair who will be "observing" the poll closures tonight, the same guy who said two years ago they only kept the polls open to "let certain people vote" outside a Hispanic market. https://t.co/snd35bIoGz
The state Republican Party, obviously fearing a repeat of long lines at 7 PM tonight, sued the Clark County registrar today and got the right to keep observers in the polling places as they close. Story @TheNVIndy soon.
@lex_nyc Yes.
Washoe numbers as of 90 mins ago:	Total25,477	Dem8,031	Rep        10,702	Other6,744		Dems, who led by 1,700 ballots after early #s, have lead erased. But you can see dominance of Clark in NV voting: Dems losing by double digits in Washoe and only behind by 2,700 today.
@JustinNorton Just today.
Washoe 	31.44%D	42.05%R	26.51% NP		GOP is turning it around in Washoe, but they did that in 2016, too, winning Election Day by 10 points. Dems just hoping to keep raw vote close there and big in Clark.
Clark now:	40.31% D	32.62%R	27.07%IND		Dems have slightly increased their percentage lead to almost 8 points. 		If that trend continues and nothing weird is happening in the internals, it's very bad news for GOP, which needs to crush it today.
STAND BY FOR MORE PARTISAN BREAKDOWNS AND FIRST ONES IN WASHOE.

Six hours left, halfway done and Clark at about 105,000. I predicted 219K, so may be close.
So many questions for me in my feed, so let me make it easy for you:		NOBODY KNOWS NUTHIN'
@ElectProject My conservative estimate for today was 333,000, which would mean the total would be 962,000. https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/Qe5382dMXt
But as @ElectProject pointed out, Clark has a huge percentage of the vote coming in -- almost 70 percent -- and if the rurals do not cut into that margin, that's a warning sign for the GOP. In 2014, rural turnout %age was well above Clark. 2/2
SOS is tracking turnout in counties -- or some of them -- and the last update shows, as expected, rural %ages are above urban. The ones to watch are Lyon, Douglas, Nye and Elko. Those are the larger rural ones where bigger GOP margins will be built. 1/2	https://t.co/4TNRkQtGy2
@ElectProject That's about what I think.
@obpair I'm not pushing anything, genius. I'm reporting numbers.
Clark is at 95,000 after 5 and a half hours. Straight extrapolation means it will be 207,000. But it could ebb or grow. That actually would be only about 20 percent turnout for Election Day, which would be 2 points higher than 2014 and 3 points below 2016.
Washoe now up to 25K. That's about 9 percent. Total turnout there is now at about 55 percent of active voters. It was 52 percent in 2014. And there are six and a half hours left.
2016 comparison not apples to apples, but this is a good take and numbers are correct. https://t.co/OIuVn0qnc3
@Nicho00usa Others
@LorenzoNY11 @MelissaTweets Hey, genius, I am just reporting numbers.
Also: In Washoe, 15K had voted by 10 AM. That's another 6 percent, bringing total to close to 137,000, or 47 percent. Don't have breakdown yet.
Deleted previous tweet, was looking at wrong sheet:		For perspective, on Election Day in the last midterm, the Dems barely won Clark on Election Day, by 3,000 votes.		In 2016, the Dems won on Election Day in Clark, 40 percent to 30 percent.
Here's the breakdown right now in Clark:	D--29,500 (39.8%)	R --24,700 (33.4%)	O--19,800 (27.8%)		So Dems winning, not by as much as early/mail, but adds another 5,000 to Clark Dem firewall. Now at 52,000.
The total right now actually is a above 17K an hour in Clark. It's at 74,000, or an average of 18,500 an hour, so 200K seems a cinch. I think it might come down to turnout.
There were 17,000 voters who cast ballots in the first hour today in Clark County. If that is the average all day, that's just over 200,000 in Clark County, or just under 20 percent. That would bring the total to 625,000, or 62 percent. That would be 20 points higher than 2014.
Just voted. Election workers say they have been busy since polls opened. Lines out the door at 7 AM. One veteran worker said biggest midterm by far. About 20 people in line now.

I do not understand this term. What is a paywall? https://t.co/4aYGGrxbv3
Nearly 25,000 people had voted in Clark County by 3 PM. This number is going to be big today, will get to 35,000, I'd guess, with shot at 40,000 turnout.

@BuzzIzarownd @SenDeanHeller @RepJackyRosen Not surprised. Thanks.
The models show that @SenDeanHeller must be winning indies by 10 percent or so to have a lead going into today's voting, unless @RepJackyRosen is well under 90 percent with her base and he is holding his. Some scenarios: 	https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/DYVmcxGvRg
@KoziaraScott Thank you!
@RonLPitts High turnout, strange vote patterns.
Early voting blog updated with latest numbers, charts and graphs and prose: Dems have a 15,000-ballot lead statewide and the Clark firewall for Dems is just shy of 38,000. The last day is going to be very important going into Tuesday. 	https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/MSH6mZDxl8
So the SOS had not added absentees filed yesterday for Clark. New numbers show the Dems lead is just 100 ballots short of 38,000 going into today. I'll update the blog in a bit.

@BooMan23 Rosen wins easily if that happens.
@RussOnPolitics Polling vs. actual votes. I draw no conclusions, just model all possibilities.
@HolmesJosh @reviewjournal Totally agree. That would be a real issue. Only people in line at 7 should be allowed to vote. This became an issue in 2016 and Trump campaign (unsuccessfully) sued. I really don't think there will be a huge issue tonight, but it is not a normal midterm, either.
@TVMoJoe @dentzernews Miriam and Sheldon have given $10K each. Venetian has given $10K. Sands has given $20K. That's $40K at least, new reports coming out today. Also, Miriam and Sheldon gave $3 million to the RGA in July and September -- RGA has spent a fortune here this cycle.
Game of Thrones finally returns! https://t.co/6wgXBqwnj1
@HolmesJosh @reviewjournal I don't know why they said midnight. That's arbitrary. But state law says they have to remain open to accommodate all voters in line at 7.
@stephenzubrycky That voters who might ordinarily vote on Election Day are voting early.

Early voting blog updated. I still say top 2 races are tossups, but turnout starting to favor Ds as Clark firewall builds. The Ds have locked up one congressional seat, and the other is tilting a little D. Leg supermajorities possible. Today is last day. https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/2LLVsKoL53
@jimmyshi03 Have not seen any.
One last thing: The Clark numbers today -- and especially if they repeat tomorrow -- are going to have a down-ticket effect, probably shifting CD3 into Lean Dem territory and making the possibility of supermajorities in both legislative houses a real possibility.
Last blog update of the day: Big Thursday for the Dems as Clark pads firewall by 4K, Washoe remains even and rurals do their thing for GOP. If it happens again Friday, big pressure on Repubs to have crushing Election Day. https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/EuWo4yZ3sQ
@Kopacevich1918 Yep.
Huge turnout in Washoe, too: 9.719. Dems increased lead by a small margin, still lead by just under 700. Point is Washoe is going to be a wash, which is very bad for the GOP. https://t.co/r8H2YPt4SM

@FabianNeuner Generally. And trends pretty imbued.
@sorceror43 I have stopped being lazy and started checking the Clark file and was about to tweet results when you did. I feel I should surrender to your superior velocity and simply wait for your updates.
So the Dems added about 5,000 ballots to their southern lead on the two days in which they traditionally do the worst vis a vis the GOP. The Dems usually surge during the last three days of Week 2, but this is a different kind of year.
Dems added 2,400 (not counting absentees) to their Clark firewall today. Closing in on 31,000. https://t.co/cy31fohy0a
@NathanWurtzel Yep. It's the swing county.

FYI, all, the SOS site here does not have Clark absentees updated yet. The Dems have jumped out to a nearly 600-vote lead in absentees in the South. I will update numbers later on the blog. Dem firewall closer to 28,500.

Also, I stopped being lazy and downloaded the voter file myself tonight and had just calculated the numbers when I saw @sorceror43 beat me to it.
Final blog update of the day: Dems with solid win in Clark, GOP takes Washoe, rurals favoring GOP again by substantial margins. Not a lot has changed, major races still in play. https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/NdeGlmLVsm
We won't know Clark absentees until tomorrow AM. But Dems had pulled even with Repubs in mail. Remember I told you that the first two days of this week would probably be better showings for Rs in early voting. Pattern of early voting seem to be holding. Dems usually surge W-F.
Dems win Clark by 2,400 ballots, 9-point win. Smaller than weekend victories, as expected, but extends southern firewall to close to 28,000 votes. https://t.co/yKzOCR3Ath

I missed this but a few people have pointed out to me that @adamlaxalt decided to tweet an anti-Vegas portion of a rural newspaper's editorial endorsing him. Why put out the part that says "a vote for Steve Sisolak is a vote for southern domination...." Really? Quite odd. https://t.co/mjgP4hB05z
These numbers in GOP-heavy Douglas County don't look right. I think Other may be switched with GOP. Either way, going to be a good day for Repubs in rurals, will pick up hundreds of votes. https://t.co/r8H2YPt4SM
Missed absentees in Washoe today: Repubs won by more than 250, so clear win. Gained about 300 there, down by about 700 now. 	Democratic - 966	Republican - 1,235	Nonpartisan - 496	Total - 2,697
Bills gonna Bills.
A near-tie in Washoe today, with GOP winning by 32 votes out of nearly 8,000 cast. Dems still lead by 1,000 ballots there.	Democratic - 3,000	Republican - 3,032	Nonpartisan - 1,699	Total - 7,731

@clmcheesy23 Oh yes, that's correct.
@clmcheesy23 Not what I got, but it's close.
Dems win Washoe again today -- eight days out of nine --  this time by 232 votes. (Only a handful of absentees counted.)		Democratic - 1,704	Republican - 1,472	Nonpartisan - 899	Total - 4,075
@clmcheesy23 My last answer: No. People do lie about it, though. One is empirical, another is not. Look at the poll.
@clmcheesy23 Look at the NYT poll crosstabs. Party reg is what the pollster knows they are, party ID is just what people say they are. Have to use the former if plugging in numbers.
@BluGreyhound Only the humor-impaired ones.
@clmcheesy23 Actually, Rosen slightly ahead if you use party reg. .5 percent, 1,800 votes.
@clmcheesy23 You need to use party reg, not ID, too. But Heller still leading if you do it that way. Mix of voters different if 900K than 736K.
@clmcheesy23 Anything is possible. But you are using party ID and not party reg. And NYT has universe being 766K. Going to be much larger.

Dems have such a huge reg lead in Clark that even with slight turnout disadvantage, they keep adding to southern firewall. But will it be enough? More than a third of days in now and it’s going to be....close.
Another 45-35 day for Dems in Clark. Added 2,300 ballots to total. Fifth straight day of 20,000-plus voters. https://t.co/XVeb9qUzzs

Turnout ticked down a little today in Clark. Just under 17,000 at 3 PM. I expect it will get to 20K or so for the fifth straight day.
@mcgboye What it shows is that the overall Washoe early/ABS was 71 percent of the total Washoe vote.
How big is early and absentee voting in NV? In presidential years, it can be as much as 70 percent of the overall vote. In midterms, it's usually about 60 percent or a little less. An update with charts: 	https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/PweeghUNPL

@geoffgarin So many anomalies.
In Ipsos poll, Heller is leading among women, 49-44. If that's true, it's over.
I don't know anyone who thinks Laxalt will win by 5 and Heller will win by 6, even optimistic Republicans. Both could win, but early voting so far indicates races will be close.
New Ipsos online poll shows Laxalt and Heller with largest leads so far. Hed needs work: "Laxalt (R) Has a Slight Lead Over Rosen (D) in the Nevada Governor Race"	https://t.co/9OudULhgI9	https://t.co/l8B9GpS0QQ

@DarrenFelipe Turnout? All rurals do, some more than others.
People Nevadasplaining in my feed make me chuckle.
@Ruhrjuhr I had no idea!
Another 1,000 turned out in Nye today, where the GOP has a 900-ballot lead WITHOUT those 1,700 absentees yet to be counted. Dems are going to need a firewall in Clark or could be trouble. Question is if this is cannibalizing Election Day for rurals. Hard to tell yet.
@BenJRush Tweeting ignorance is also a fool's game.
Dems won Washoe for fourth straight day, but not by as much as first 3 days: 3,464-3,286. Republicans erased deficit and then some with win in absentees by 350 votes. Dem lead is 1,300 there.Reminder: Washoe is swing county where GOP leads by 2 percent in reg. Hillary won Washoe.
Big turnout today (1,000) in GOP-voter-rich and rural Douglas County, where the Rs now have a huge lead of more than 1,850 ballots out of 5,300 cast early and by absentee. That is going to leave a mark.

The Republicans won NV on Monday and made some gains in key legislative districts, although a key state Senate race is looking very blue. Dems still have raw vote lead.

How is early voting going in Nevada? If you are hungry for data, I'm here for you. I've updated my blog with numbers and analysis: https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/X80Dj9IOau
@joshuarhicks yes, some move.
The rural surge today all but negated the gains the Dems made in the two urban counties. It's close to a draw for the day. Several rural counties still not in.
Repubs in Clark continue to outperform registration (by 8 points today) better than Dems (up 2 points today), but the Dems' huge reg edge helped them add 2,000 to their ballot lead. That's why the Dems push voter reg in Clark so hard every cycle. They know GOP wins turnout game.
Another big day in Clark -- 28, 190 voted. Democrats pushed their ballot lead to 8,000 -- 7,500 with mail counted. 45 percent to 35 percent, so 10 point lead or 3 points under reg.
@spookybookyozzy How can you make ignorant comments and insist on being muted?
@spookybookyozzy I had no idea.
Statewide Democratic candidates in competitive races generally need to win Clark by at least 10 points and hope to stay close in Washoe. That is usually enough. Hillary won Clark by just under 11 and won Washoe by 3,000 votes to survive the rural onslaught. https://t.co/P7sy0WAr3O
In case you were wondering, Trump won the 15 rural NV counties by nearly 40 points over Hillary. Laxalt and Heller may not do quite that well, but 30-35 is not impossible. Question is what percentage of vote will rurals be. Anywhere from 15-20 percent. It was 17 percent in 2014.
Rural numbers after two days in major counties:		Douglas 2014: 1,500	Douglas 2018: 2,100	Lyon 2014: 900	Lyon 2018: 1,700	Nye 2014: 1,250	Nye 2018: 1,900		Trump Effect?
Some big bumps in rural turnout on Monday. Republicans winning by 2-to-1 in the larger counties, significant margins in all. GOP needs that to stay in the hunt. https://t.co/q16anLokuq

@yeselson That's three days vs. seven days.
Total Clark early votes in week 1, 2014: 67,000	Total Clark early votes after 3 days: At least 73,000 https://t.co/kYkBKjR9ZQ
Clark turnout was 19K at 3 PM today. It will go over 20K for third straight day. So it is going to be another huge day compared to 2014, when Day 3 had 10,400. In 2010, it was 17,160. This is starting to look like a hybrid, a three-quarters of a presidential year turnout in NV.

“The current senator, he doesn’t seem willing to stand up to this,” Obama said. “He just goes along, Even when you get a sense he knows it’s not right. But it’s okay, he just goes ahead and goes along.” https://t.co/90jJNtCYXK
And Obama is done. I think he said vote 114 times.		Now let's see how the Dems do today in Clark.
Obama won Nevada twice. He got more than half a million votes in Clark County in 2012.
Obama is great at the GOTV message for Dems. He also has big numbers in NV with indies (+23) and undecideds (+22), internal Dem polling earlier this month showed.
Obama gets great cheers for saying voters could elect first female majority in NV Legislature, which is highly unlikely but the national media has hyped it to death.
@TeresaKopec Kind?
@evansiegfried Neither rally about bites. It's about getting people to go early vote. Rest of it is noise.
Obama is focusing on voting and that message. And while he, too, has some "I did that" stuff, his message is much crisper than Trump in Elko, which is, I admit, the lowest of bars to get over.

Dems won Clark again Sunday, but by much less than registration advantage: 10,434-8,804.That's 44 percent to 37 percent, only about half of what reg lead is. Nearly 24,000 voted. Clark lead now at 6,000 voters.

The GOP did a good enough job with absentee ballots in the run-up to early voting to stay close, so the real question is whether the Dems can keep this up or will peter out after big first day showing.
It was a big day for the Dems in Nevada's urban counties on the first day of early voting. I have updated my blog on the numbers and what we know so far:	https://t.co/q4LOMuJRv1 https://t.co/qOPPwabXgB
I’ll have analysis on my blog tomorrow, but big first day of really voting for Dems in Nevada. Turnout was close to presidential year levels. We will know in a few days if anomaly or trend.
Huge day for Dems in Clark, too. Almost 3 percent over reg lead. Thanks, @sorceror43! https://t.co/WnPM4vm1Ko
@Dan_PomerantzMD Right. But absentees were aggregated over weeks. Question is if trend continues or anomaly.
Been watching early voting a long time and I don’t think I have ever seen Dems win Washoe by 15 points — 49-34. It’s NV’s swing county, GOP has 2 percent edge. It’s only one day, we still need to see Clark. But that is a bad omen for Repubs.
Washoe and handful of rurals are in. https://t.co/2sdZXZt78B
Dems had big day in Washoe (Reno), where GOP has 2 percent reg edge. About even after absentees counted, but good sign for Dems. https://t.co/E5Vym4y5SA
@paulgcauchi @mhickey187 Those are wrong.
Early voting in the Democratic stronghold of Clark County is going to be at least triple what it was in 2014. Looks more like a presidential year. Big show for first day and it peters out? Or a sign of what’s to come?
Some early voting sites in Vegas don’t close until 8.
Clark turnout was at 27,000 at 5PM. It was 10,000 after the first day in 2014.
First real votes in, from rurals: 2-to-1 GOP out of a few thousand cast. Not unexpected. https://t.co/1jLvlwmYB1

NEWS: Clark County turnout was 22,000 as of 3 PM, more than TWICE what it was entire first day in 2014 and 4,000 more than any midterm here in history. Will get up above 25K, I'd guess. Going to be interesting to see breakdown, but bodes well for Dems.

But Dems had a 13 percent lead in Clark last midterm and got crushed. GOP held Dems to a draw in Clark in early vote, presaging doom. GOP swept all the state offices and into control of both houses of the Legislature. Stop me if you have heard this: It all comes down to turnout.
In their push to build a registration firewall in Clark County, the Democrats now have a 137,400-voter lead (13 percent) over Republicans. It is 42-29. Very soon, the GOP is going to fall behind those not registered with any major party in Southern Nevada, which is unprecedented.
