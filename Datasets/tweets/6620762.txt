@AdrianaMaestas And Beto still lost
@AdrianaMaestas There are a bunch of candidates that which they had 1/2 of the support Beto got, it would have made all the difference in their races
@AdrianaMaestas He had every advantage as a Dem running against an incumbent, that some would argue was beatable. Beto was by far the most hyped candidate this cycle - non stop glowing articles, an insane amount of free media, raised a historic $70 million, a slew of endorsements and surrogates

Yup! He‚Äôs a winner, clearly the $70 million was well spent.... the best thing about Beto is that while Dems were donating to his underdog campaign, they didn‚Äôt donate to actual competitive races. The Senate could look very different right now, if it weren‚Äôt for Beto! Gracias! https://t.co/Qhc7v01fUl
I agree that Beto O‚ÄôRourke is a talented politician yet I find it odd but fascinating all the liberal media elites strongly advocating how he should be the Dem 2020 nominee. The guy had a historic $70 million for a Senate race, &amp; every advantage possible &amp; still lost!
