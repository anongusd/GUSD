3. According to the author, "Ulysses" - a story about one day lived by one man in the street from one medium-sized European town - contained all the literature with all its styles and writing techniques and expressed everything that art can say about a person.
2. The novel "Ulysses" (1922) - the main work of the writer, which determined the development of the art of prose and more than once recognized as the best, most significant novel in the history of this genre.
James Joyce (1882 - 1941), the great Irish writer, a classic and at the same time a destroyer of the classics with its canons, a man who is more than anyone, owes his birth to new literary schools and directions of the 20th century.
Joyce is a man with a bomb who would like to blow up the remnants of Europe. This is an egocentric, arch-esoteric rebel ... an absolute anarchist.		Middleton Merry.
"Ulysses" is a divine creation of art, it will live forever, in spite of all learned nonentities trying to turn it into a collection of symbols and myths.		Vladimir Nabokov.
