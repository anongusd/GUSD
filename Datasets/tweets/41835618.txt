@Philmoeslim @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I said what I said.  I asked a question:  Why are no current members of Congress telling you about the missing trillions?  Why isn't Trump or any other Presidental candidate sharing this info? 	Listen Here: https://t.co/xGVZIb0Haz
@Philmoeslim @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The trillions started going missing in 1998.  Why aren't any current members of congress sharing this detail with the people?  The missing money has now grown to more than 21-trillion.  6.5-trillion in 2015 alone.  The question you should be asking is why don't you know this?
@Philmoeslim @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You are sort of missing the point.  They are all on the same team.  There is more than 21 trillion missing from DOD/HUD, but not Trump or any current member of Congress is talking about it.  Then in Novermber they took the entire financial reporting secret, full fascist.
@Philmoeslim @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump This is propaganda.  What i shared with you are government documents.

without threatening the potential whistleblower. Now that the public has increasingly realized the climate change cover-up, the media looks more and more foolish in their attempt to protect the masters." -Harold Saive
This is not advanced technology but more like farming the sky with a million tractors.  True advanced technology would not require aerosols to produce "climate change".  It's brute force climate manipulation for which secrecy cannot be maintained
@DonnaWR8 "Controlling the weather has been a goal of industrialists for 150 years or more.But it was not until the avaialablity of vast numbers of jet aircraft that mde it possible to replace huge sections of the atmosphere with chemicals to control the flow of air and moisture.
Serco Group - British outsource that runs trains, hospitals, schools, missile defense systems, and border screening with a support staff of 40,000 in thirty-eight nations.  Its rival is G4S (Wackenhut).  All from the book Under and Ionized Sky by Elana Freeland
Samsung, NBC (General Electric), Thomasville Furniture, Lowe's, Ballpark Franks (Sara Lee), Eggo Waffles (Kelloggs), Jell-O (Kraft), Coffee-Mate (Nestle), etc.
Literally thousands of corporations depend upon hefty military contracts to support the American lifestyle of soldiers far from home: Sony, Danskin, Hanes Her Way, New Balance, Sara Lee Corporation, Home Depot, Procter&amp;Gamble, Roomba Vacuum (iRobot) GlaxoSmithKline, Maytag, Sears
All of these installations mean profits for the military-industrial-intelligence complex.  For example, Kellogg, Brown &amp; root have provided weapons and administration for Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo since 1999.
and the contiguous waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans up to five hundred miles off the North American coastline (including Cuba).  Both Homeland Security and the North American Aerospace Defense Command are subject to NORHTCOM.
(not counting the "misplaced" $2.3 trillion during Bush II). In 2002, thanks to the Unified Command Plan, the primarily domestic U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) was established.  Homeland defense command now includes the U.S., Canada, Mexico, parts of the Caribbean,
including the "Royal Air Force" military and ELINT (electronic intelligence) espionage installations in the UK to the tune of $5 billion.  In total, the DoD owns over $1-trillion in assets and $1.6 trillion in liabilities
Camp Ederle in Italy ($544 million), Incirlik Air Base in Turkey ($1.2 billion), Thule Air Base in Greenland ($2.8 billion), U.S. Naval Air Station at Keflavik, Iceland ($3.4 billion), and 20+ other nations.
and that's not counting the baes and facilities, freight rail fleet, tactical trucks, Humvees, and law enforcement battalions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Israel, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Ascension Auxiliary Airfield off St. Helena ($337 million),
The Pentagon owns over 29 million acres for 6,000 bases at home and in its territories, and another 3,731 sites with 1,477 Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) abroad, including 20 percent of the Japanese island of Okinawa and 25 percent of Guam--- from the book Under and Ionized Sky

@kejames Actually what I am "trying" to say.  Is the only reason it is raised as an issue at all is to divide us.  The LGBTQ thing is a fabricated issue that doesn't even get support from the entire community.  It is a divided issue in and out of the community.
@kejames We can all agree the missing money is big news for everyone globally.  Big big news that that is _rumped by LGBT propaganda.  You have to wonder why politicians on both sides would engage in such usless dribble. It has only divided us up. We are all humans first.
@kejames Are any members of Congress driving issues that would bring us all together?  LGBTQ being close to your heart is great.  Do what you can to help those people.  Can you really expect billions of people to change culturally over night to support .00475% of the population?
@kejames Is Congress leading any of these issues? Or are they being lead by media?  Are any of them talking about the trillions being stolen from DOD/HUD?  Are any of them speaking out agaist endless undeclared wars that have kill and injured millions?
@kejames Non-sequitur but not.  Have you ever wondered why the only issues American's seem to discuss on social media are hot divided issues that play an insignificant role in humanity as a whole?  Go take a look at the Twitter feed for every member of Congress.  What are they tweeting?
@kejames Please be specific about what you are saying.  What people, what discriminatory laws, what institutions, and what structures?  What does the I &amp; the A in LGBTQIA mean?

@fMRI_guy @kejames cryptic
@fMRI_guy @kejames But they all have an opinion on gender issues.
@fMRI_guy @kejames The last politician I heard speak of the trillions going missing from DOD/HUD was Cynthia McKinney.  Today we have Congress tweeting about gender issues, open borders, abortion...but not a word from any of the 535 on the missing trillions. https://t.co/n7zRO2JpNK

@fMRI_guy @kejames I have no political affiliation.
@fMRI_guy @kejames An intellectual smoke screen over a contrived issue. I don't care what anyone does with their own body or mind. Power to the individual!! This is only an issue for some that want to have a collective understanding "like" to their own.
@fMRI_guy @kejames This is not an issue I think about beyond the local boy who wants to be allowed in the girls' locker room.  Not going to happen here.  If when an adult, the boy wants to try out the girls' locker room at the local gym and take his chances.  Then so be it.  Good Luck to them.
@fMRI_guy @kejames For some it is.  So be it.  Why force it on everybody?  If you want to wear a wig and a dress.  Or wear jeans and boots and get a guy haircut.  Who cares.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Trans people get all the right of everyone else.  Nobody is telling them how to dress or act in public.  It is only a TV issue.  An issue in the media.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Other examples in our short history: While Bill Clinton was in the news for his Oval Office sexcapades.  He was destroying the last remaining protections from the Great Depression regarding banking when he mowed down Glass Steagall that gave us the 2008 crisis.  We got MLewinsky
@fMRI_guy @kejames I agree. Prisoner treatment and prisons, especially private prisons.  You want to see true bipartisanship in action.   https://t.co/MiHLCYzrd9
@fMRI_guy @kejames The issues found on TV are divide and conquer.  Every one of them.  Abortion, gender, republithug, demoncrat thing...  This is what you see on TV.  Issues that divide.
@fMRI_guy @kejames I think we could all agree it is quite the screw job when we invaded Afghanistan losing lives and spending trillions.  And in return, we earned the largest heroin crisis we have ever experienced.  How does that happen?
@fMRI_guy @kejames We can all agree that military suicides are terrible.  These people are killing themselves at more than 20 a day for more than a decade.  Lots of dead solders.  Why?  It is not on TV.  But we can all agree it is very bad and something should be done to understand.
@fMRI_guy @kejames We can all agree that the trillions missing from DOD and HUD is bad, very bad.  Right?
@fMRI_guy @kejames You don't need to address any of these issues here.  Why do we not see war on TV?  We can all agree that war is bad be you boy, girl, gay, transgender and all the rest of it.  Right? we can all agree war is bad.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Belief issues are easy targets for propaganda and serve to divide us from the bigger picture.  There is no left/right.  It is just a ruse.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Since that time we have bombed Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen... back to the stone age and creating a huge migrant crisis.  Now look at the propaganda about these same people.  Open doors for everyone, even the people whos countries we bombed back to the stone age.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Propaganda: Remeber after 9/11 when CNN repeatedly ran a segment about taqiya.  That Muslims are raised to lie.  There are sleepers cells in the USA and all the rest of it.  They hate us for our freedoms craps.  Do you remember the hate propaganda toward Muslims?
@fMRI_guy @kejames None of it matters if the politicians both right and left are stealing or allowing to be stolen, the entire wealth of the country.  Or if we allow these monsters in politics to continue funding endless undeclared wars.
@fMRI_guy @kejames They are harvesting the country and have us all at each other throats over gender issues?  really?  We have been at war in force since 2001, but not a peep on war on TV.
@fMRI_guy @kejames We have been at war since I was a kid and before.  But LGBTQ is the topic on TV.  On the View, on TV shows, all of the sudden we have transgender kids on TV shows.  This is how propaganda works.
@fMRI_guy @kejames You are both political animals and lean to whatever issue your party tows along.  I am a post-political animal.  The real power lies elsewhere and far beyond politics.  If it is an issue being promoted by a political party, you can bet you are being manipulated/deceived/divided.
@kejames I agree with everything you listed.  Still just boys and girls.  You can live a life in between as you wish.  It is your choice.  I hope the best for you.  Just use the proper locker room.
@kejames So you consider yourself Transgender?
@fMRI_guy @kejames And posting flubber about gender confusion as a scientific biological fact isn't embarrassing.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Still no list(s).
@fMRI_guy @kejames I am just trying to make you think and not regurgitate what you see repeated over and over again on TV.
@kejames You don't have a list do you?
@kejames @fMRI_guy Less than 1%.  Are there larger groups of disenfranchised people in American or around the globe?  They would get priority right?
@Duke_of_neural @DrRachaelF @kejames If you poop standing up Phil, you might have a better chance of escaping.	What is your top five list Phil?
@kejames @fMRI_guy Make your list.  What is on your top five list?  Don't be scared.  Just do it. The world is a mess.  How do we go about fixing it?  What issues should we focus on that would bring people together vs. driving them apart?
@Duke_of_neural @DrRachaelF @kejames Though shalt not commit logical fallacies, but you just did Phil.  Try again.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Just send your list.  Don't over think this.  Real simple.  We all have brains.  The world is in turmoil.  Do you have a few or maybe 5 things you think are most important for advancing society?
@Duke_of_neural @DrRachaelF @kejames It is a theory.  Not sure if it has made the grade to be a conspiracy.  Time will tell.  What are your top five issues facing the country/humanity @Duke_of_neural ?
@fMRI_guy @kejames So list your big issues.
@kejames What human rights are these people being deprived of?
@fMRI_guy @kejames You make my point.  Your primary issue is gender equality.  Whatever that means. You should stop watching TV.  You should be sad for being so manipulated.  You have made it clear that gender issues for you are the most important issue facing humanity.  TV issues rule your world.
@fMRI_guy @kejames Ok, I'll go first:  I am open to drop adds, not in priority order.	- The Missing Trillions from DOD/HUD: https://t.co/n7zRO2JpNK	- End support for undeclared and endless wars slaughtering millions.	- End wars toward ending the 20+ daily military suicides.	Your turn
@fMRI_guy @kejames So what are the top five issues?  simple question
@fMRI_guy @kejames Let's take a different approach.  What are the most important issues facing this country today?
@fMRI_guy @kejames The point moves around when it is based on someones "newly" propagandized belief.  Representing less than 1% of the population.  How much of an issue do you think this whole confusion would be if it were not for TV?
@fMRI_guy @kejames The "much more" is based on belief and not science.
@fMRI_guy @kejames But everybody seems to have an opinion on gender because it is on TV every day, all day.  It's on the news, the view and all the rest of it.  They have tuned up the population with propaganda and used it to divide the people.  The question is why and to what end?
@fMRI_guy @kejames There is something else going on with all the gender pronouns and hype over such a super minority of people.  Politicians do not risk everything to win over votes from less than 1% of the population.  There are a greater number of homeless veterans that nobody gives a hoot about.
@fMRI_guy @kejames My words regarding the possible real agenda for this confusion: "The best explanation I have heard has to do with integrating taxable robots into the workforce"
@fMRI_guy @kejames I am not sure what @kejames is up to. No science has been shared here. There are two sexes. A drop of blood can determine the sex of the donor never meeting the donor. That same drop of blood cannot determine if the donor is a male wearing a dress and thinking they are a girl
@fMRI_guy @kejames Gender X and the taxable robot workforce.  Robots are people too.
@kejames There is nobody talking about ending endless wars on TV.  But they spend a hell of a lot of time focusing on things like "gender".  So everybody has an opinion on gender these days, but not war.   Does anybody have a mind of their own?  Focus on something positive for the planet.
@kejames There are bigger humanitarian issues that desperately need the support of other humans who believe all humans should be treated with dignity and respect.  How about some anti-war energy?
@kejames You are caught in a Hegelian ruse that is indefensible and can only be supported by individual propagandized "belief".  You are being used to advance an agenda that goes unspoken.  The best explanation I have heard has to do with integrating taxable robots into the workforce.
@kejames You simply can't change reality using linguistic make-believe.
@kejames A simple test of one drop of blood can determine sex without ever meeting the blood donor.  All the rest is pure divide and conquer propaganda toward an end that has more to do with robots than people.  You are being used.
@kejames Confirmed...no science.  Just propaganda.  You are a fake news fake biologist.  There is no science.  Just an article that coincides with your preconceived notion about whatever message you are trying to send using linguistic make believe pronouns.
@kejames The moving target defense of the propagandist.  No science?  You are entitled to believe whatever you want.  Your beliefs do not constitute a civil right.
@kejames Then present it here.  How much science could there be for a segment of the population that totals less than 1%.

@gunsgirl1099 @PattyMurray I think you should treat all humans with respect and dignity.  But there is this little thing called reality you simply can't avoid. Boys who think there girls and girls who think they are boys are troubled. To treat them otherwise is abusive.  They need help, not more confusion.
@godless_mom A pedophile who thinks he is a priest.  Is he also a boy who thinks he is a girl?  Is he troubled?
@kejames Your belief does not constitute a civil right.  You are either a boy or a girl, a man or a woman.  The only in-between is in your mind.
@kejames That sure was a mishmash of mind control nothing.  You might not sound like such a dope if you would have had a minor in linguistics.  Then you might realize you can't simply change reality using linguistic make-believe.  If you want to be a new pronoun, go for it.
@marcorubio You are totally captured.  Mind controlled rent boy Manchuria.
@LeyFenix @PattyMurray In my world you can‚Äôt simply make up words to change reality.   This is a fake divide and conquer issue.  You have been propagandize into Looneyville.  You will get angry and call me names.  But you are still either a boy or girl.
@gunsgirl1099 @PattyMurray There is this problem with reality that can‚Äôt simply be change with a little linguistic make believe.  This is a fake news fake issue.  You are caught in the dialectic.

When the government was questioned about these losses, they removed the documents from the public record.  All subsequent reports have been released but completely redacted.  This as I understand is against the law.
Under Obama the losses grew to more than 21-trillion unaccounted for as ‚Äúundocumented adjustments ‚Äú.   You can see the public record that details the losses for yourself.
Trillions continued to go missing each year under Bush and after 9/11.

@SpeakerRyan Paul Ryan and Congress are promoting MORE appropriatings for agency contractors (lockheed) who are stealing the money faster than Congress can appropriate the funds.  Why is Congress not talking about the trillions missing from DOD and HUD?  https://t.co/n7zRO2JpNK
@girl4_trump that is funny
@SenJeffMerkley Senator Merkley or any other current member of Congress is telling the people about the 21-trillion they have allowed to be stolen.  Why does Congress keep appropriating to DOD/HUD when trillions go missing? https://t.co/xpmX5iGfxd

@RonWyden Ron, we are onto you and the rest of Congress.  Congress is stealing trillions and covering up the scam by promoting ridiculous issue after issue.  None of which have any meaning up against the missing trillions.  This is dangerous secrecy. https://t.co/n7zRO2JpNK

@SenWarren I looked at your Twitter feed.  You have not said anything positive that might bring the country together.  You like the rest of Congress run a negative divide and conquer operations spewing nothing but negativity.

@Patchoulimommy @caitoz There is something afoot with the sex network crackdowns globally including the Catholic Church and not just here is the USA.    It‚Äôs long overdue.
@Patchoulimommy @caitoz I don‚Äôt know anything about him admitting anything like that.  I do know one of the first things Trump announced was his plan to crack down on human trafficking.  Almost 20,000 have been busted all over the world since that meeting.  Fact. It is not being televised.
@Patchoulimommy @caitoz I have no idea what it‚Äôs message was passionate or otherwise.  Another clue it was a manufactured event was how MSM covered it 24/7.
@Patchoulimommy @caitoz normal
@Patchoulimommy @caitoz It was an orchestrated event that used mind control techniques to get seemingly Bomar people to do silly things.  There was no spirit supporting it.

@WBBosley The older and very kind man exlained how the Allies changed the history books and simplified the launguage to just 48 characters.  In a generation they educated the Samari class from Japanese society.  It is difficult to climb from a lifetime of learnding lies and half truths.
@WBBosley It is hard for so many in the USA to challenge a lifetime of historicial lies and deceptions.  It hit me hard when I found the Dodd Report in 2008.  Combined with a conversation I had with a 72yo Japanese man on the island in 2002 were he explained big changes in Japan after WW2.

Here is a link detailing the really scary amount of money that has gone missing.  Now under scrutiny, they have hidden past audits and redacted new ones. The Fox is in the hen house.  This is big unimaginable amounts of money that is unaccounted for at your expense.
I have looked at hundreds of twitter feeds for members of Congress. Not Republican or Democrat have tweeted even once about the trillions missing from DOD/HUD. The Tweets from congressional members are narrow and in line with the media.  Simple divide and conquer issues.
@VoteMarsha All true.  They haven‚Äôt mentioned anything publicly about the missing trillions. You haven‚Äôt spoken of the missing money either.  This is scary money. A bipartisan theft in the trillions of dollars.  https://t.co/xpmX5iGfxd
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED Here is a real concern with DeVos.  Her brother is a hired gun, a mercenary who is lobbying to privatized the Afghan war.Who are these people?One wants to educate our children and one would teach them to kill.We need to pay more attention to who and what is being taught 2 kids.
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED No need. Leave the guns. Just stop drugging these kids with Ritalin/Adderall before they even hit puberty.  Stop handing out SSRI‚Äôs like gum drops.  You are creating monsters with all these drugs.  Then you let the CIA flood the country with heroin.  #JailCongress
