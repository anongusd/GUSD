Maybe it should’ve been a discussion of knowing your worth because when you do you don’t tolerate people detrimental to your mental, spiritual and physical health .
What’s the source of 50 percent of our pain? Ourselves the other 50 is our interactions with other people and those we allow into our life .
Na God didn’t drop you down here to suffer
Somewhere between movies pop culture and media people think everything has to be a struggle everything requires dark days and dog fights
You evenrually wisen up and dip or that person hurts you so bad you never forget the pain
When you’re out here trying to make things work with people you know aren’t good for you but you think you can change then one of two things happen
Now y’all are prolly like Olu how does that relate , when you go somewhere that’s not for you or in someone not for you you always get a lifetime lesson
And I’ve had to sit by both of em while they watch their babymothers respectively live in Robstown off their child support
Long story short both of them went and I stayed . We all deployed the next day, when we came back a year later both of them had kids waiting on em
All 3 of us got invited out to Robstown on a late night tip, I told em na man we leaving at 6am plus I had a funny feeling
We all returned to base at like 3am , these girls wanted us to come through they stayed in Robstown matter fact this involves two ppl know that I think about it .
Dawg and I remember when we were enlisted and about to deploy to the Middle East we all went and parties the night prior
I have a Patna we both were in the military , we both got out went to the same type of jobs for a while and we both committed to knocking out school the long way
Stay with me and try not to get triggered yo
But sooner or later you realize God has a way of shielding you from you and the wrong people
Like a lot of us hit snags over who didn’t work out for us , then we get caught in the why, and sometimes fall into the “why me”
Take time to think was all that really for you at that time were you where you needed to be spiritually for it ?
Yoooooo think about all the things that didn’t work out the first time all the people that didn’t work out

Why I tell everyone I know when they sense something off, something foul, nip it in the bud then before you allow it to grow into a situation you can’t control
What you allow is what continues in any situation be it how people talk to you, treat you, and even the opinion they hold .
If you love them you forgive them and you remember exactly who you are dealing with and you also decide is this something you’re willing to deal with

Some people maintain a friendship just to say they aren’t like you, don’t do this that you do, but all the time it’s the same person that’s smiling and laughing with you
What they’re saying is how they really feel about you and a projection of their own issues
It’s like when you see two friends split and all of a sudden ones badmouthing them or slanders then to other people.
You can’t build your image off the opinions of others because they’ll eventually tear down that same image they contributed to
You can’t dwell on what, and who you can’t have or you’ll hate your own life

@lenaathomas Glad to help I had it made into a tapestry and remind myself daily https://t.co/2fFS7551w5
A good portion of issues we have is our own refusing to come to the terms that the world, situations and other people don’t go how we think it should
To the getting over our self’s part we view the world in our own lense, how people should act how things should move according to us, there are 7 billion plus ppl in the world that feel the same way 😂
@lenaathomas https://t.co/AsqHpcmbeS
Get all that learning through interactions with people , people you uplift, people you talk to, people who trust you enough to listen to their problems and life
Moreover people close to me have passed that I never got to say goodbye to, and worse someone that was passing that was like I always wanted to kick it with you
I tell anyone that I feel a certain way or anyway how I feel 1. So they know and 2. So I’m not sitting bottling up and it pops out one day making me look like a utter psycho
In the broadest sense our main issues as human beings is getting over ourselves and just communicating
To love people when there mad at you to love people when there not st their best and to love people even when they hate you
To fathom because you feel one way about someone doesn’t guarantee it’s reciprocate

Best way to kill your anxiety is directly facing what’s giving life to it
We have one shot on this earth and at life , forget the no forget the what if just go for it
In anything in life the worst answer you can get is a no, and are you really wrapped up in the fear of a no that you won’t charge ahead and live your life?
But that’s not life you’re better than your situation, problems and fears
That’s why I feel for people that deal with depression they feel trapped by life in general
But anxiety is like my personal demon as much as I know God will see me through anything
You’re just fun for them, a passing fancy or just a flirt for em you don’t mean anything you’re worthless
And that’s right about wen anxiety is like see none of these people really funk with you or this person doesn’t really care
Now that I think about it if I had to say I had any toxic trait it’s I feel if I communicate something I’m wasting my time because it’ll just be words to the other person
I learned to not hold certain things against people and to try and communicate better
People only know what you directly tell them and even at that it’s just words you can’t convey emotions
But since we are all wired differently that’s not how it works
I’m guarded not out of pain but because I feel we as humans have a horrible habit and tendency to expect people to think like us or just know things
It still saddens me most people around me don’t know me but that’s to be expected
Maybe some Rezz to think
And for the most part I’m a emotionless person 🤣 so this has me slightly off

I don’t deserve what you giving me	Like you get a victory by acting like a dick to me	Want me to see how it feels, I get the trickery	Lesson learned though, you my missing piece	Give another chance to your ex	You don’t pick up the phone, you don’t answer my texts
You compare me in your head to some nigga you created	I’m a long way from perfect, I got shit with me
We discussing chicks after they through	They don’t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you	We keep having the same threesome	But not the kind that come as a blessing, nah	You keep bringing up my last girl like she ain't my past girl
But I could switch gears, make 'em all disappear	You going through my phone like I got a bitch in there	We discussing chicks after they through	They don’t matter to me, but for some reason they matter to you
But wait, I ain't love her though, I ain't fuck her though	I could dead that bitch right now man, fuck that hoe	You just think I'll get another and another hoe	Way you talk to me it's like I got a whole club of hoes
To you, I’m the cause of all your misery	Of course I disagree, you going off our history	All that arguing just ain't my style	'Cause that anger now got us like strangers now	You tell me I should get help and I’m sick in the head	You found makeup on the sheets
But it's easier for me to replace you, 'cause I see it like	If you can't deal with what we go through	I got bitches lined up, I got a ego too	And to them I’m everything, funny, I'm great and I’m charming	But to you I’m alarming, all I do is bring harm in
How dare you tell me it's tougher for you?	Like I don’t hear about them niggas you fucking with too?	I'd never knew you thought like that (dammit)	Who knew you was into sports like that	More prayers because they all players	You out there having a ball, player, after ball player
Say I’m all about hoes, when I’m all about you	when I’m with my hoes, I tell them all about you	Say that’s just one reason I keep losing you	I don’t understand it, that shit is confusing too	You left me, I’m doing me, you doing you	So what the fuck is me doing me have to do wit u
Tired of hearing how you’ll never trust me again	How you love me, then you hate me, then you love me again	One minute I’m your soul-mate then it’s fuck me again	Until you get horny enough and wan' fuck me again, but check it	I just wan' treat you good and do better
You should keep it coy with, cause all that is, is stress for me	I’m not ya ex baby girl, you not a catch for me	I mean respectfully, certain shit I’m not a glutton for	For every bad bitch, there’s a nigga tired of fucking her
So before you beef, know that he got buried for you	I dont tell you that for points, nah, you can keep the brownies	I tell you so that you know I was mature when you found me	Tell you so you know that little boy shit that I get annoyed with
You, you ain't seen the worst time	Hit you with that old move	Take you to a flick that I’ve already seen with another broad	But pretend like it’s my first time	And, nah you don’t know how that sound
Still at times where it seems like you’re not proud of me	Though I’m showing you the best man I know how to be	But you keep saying show me more	You’d appreciate me better had you known me before	You’ve never been cheated on	Had another chick in your house in your bed
You’ll have some resentment so you’ll start acting childishly	You’ll rape me in court cause of course you’ll have it out for me	To you it may sound absurd but for me it’s a reality
I’d love to put a child in you and live lavish	But my baby momma scared me, let me tell you bout my baggage	We could have a son and break up and be done	And now I’ll never see him again	As you take him and run	You gon’ tell him that he’s fatherless	Tell him that I’m cowardly

So the question begs itself WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR YOURSELF AND OTHERS, since your entire platform is based on the constant struggle?
When they pull data for minorities doing well who makes up the majority of those #’s? Oh you can guess that too all to turn around and help others.
Na fam that’s not it you’re just confused. Last I even looked what profession do you see black immigrants go into? Oh snap healthcare, so who is that taking care of YOU and yours?
Don’t see y’all pro black “heroes” out here doing that . These the same ppl that will claim Ogun, then tell you you don’t know the same struggle if you’re African 😂 oh but you want to run around invoking Nigerian God’s and sayings 😂
Malcolm, Martin, Huey, didn’t they all have demonstrations, start programs benefitting minorities, were concerned with health, education and mental stability.
Vs the one that gets out becomes a law maker or something if the same and actually institutes change

Like think about it what really upsets you when someone leaves you hanging or things fall through. You take it as a personal affront and almost a definition of you what’s worse some people look for it as their validation or confirmation.
@NicaTexMex It’s a bit humid though
And I really think with people it’s almost a self ego thing. Most people don’t want to internalize that someone doesn’t see them as important as they feel they are
And it’s really because more and more I realize people don’t want to always be held responsible or just committing to do certain things
