Trump on emergency powers, saying : “I didn’t need to do this” but wanted to move faster is like me saying I didn’t need to use my car’s emergency brake but did so to stop quicker.

@realDonaldTrump You said there were “very fine people on both sides” of a neo-Nazi March. Not fake news. Your words. You deserve the blame.
I don’t think Pres. Trump is creating  anger, but that anger elected  Pres. Trump. The difference is this: past presidents healed wounds. This president pours gas on them.

Mr. President: your prayers don’t work when your policies allow maniacs to shoot people praying. We need #gunsafety now. #Pittsburg
When Members of Congress fear #GUNviolence more than they fear primaries, things will change.  Use your vote to change them.
Remember when you vote: those who want to pass gun safety and those who vote to protect  the gun manufacturers. And don’t tell me shouldn’t politicize this. It’s all about the politics of the gun lobby.
