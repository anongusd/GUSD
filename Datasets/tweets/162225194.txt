With the debt ceiling and spending cap deadlines so close together, Pelosi prefers to knock out both at the same time and fund the govt through the 2020 election. But that risks entangling debt talks in budget negotiations, which, you know, can get a little complicated.
Trump and Congress have until ~August to strike a deal. There's bipartisan support for raising the debt limit, and *right now* it doesn't look like Trump/GOP will ask for spending cuts in exchange. But, the debt limit deadline coincides with automatic spending cuts no one likes.
Bad news: The US missing a debt payment could literally be enough to derail the global economy, which is underpinned by the idea that the US will never not have enough money to pay its bills.		Good news: Neither party is willing to let that happen https://t.co/6CPYXBwWbp

Without access to basic financial services, some cannabis growers and dispensaries can only operate with cash. That complicates their books and raising the chance they could be robbed, sometimes violently. The safety concerns are a major unifying force behind the bill.
The bill, sponsored by @RepPerlmutter (D-Colo.), would bar federal regulators and prosecutors from penalizing banks and credit unions for serving cannabis businesses if those firms are complying with state law. https://t.co/l9ZJy4x6f8
Cannabis is legal for either medical or recreational use in 33 states. The industry is rapidly expanding. But the drug is still federally illegal, so banks and credit unions are wary to serve cannabis companies. A bipartisan group is trying to fix that: https://t.co/l9ZJy4x6f8

Watt complained earlier that the press didn't report the fact that he and Grimes never had any sexual or romantic physical contact. Grimes did not allege that they did, and that's also not the bar for sexual harassment.
Watt says he didn't agree to an interview for the Postal Service investigation because no one the report would be submitted to would have the power to discipline him. He said that he'd comply if the report was being prepared for the president, who can fire him.
Watt: ‚ÄúI am fully participating in these investigations. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù Yeah, we kind of figured that.
Waters, on this hearing and so much more: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one lesson in all of this, maybe for you, it‚Äôs a new day, it‚Äôs new time and the old processes don‚Äôt work quite well anymore.‚Äù
Watt complained that Grimes shouldn't have testified because she has a pending lawsuit against him and FHFA. Waters replies: ‚ÄúWhile that has been the regular order of business...let me just share with you that this is a different day and different time.‚Äù
Watt insists he hasn't done anything wrong but that he's cooperating with the FHFA IG probe. Hensarling says that he better, or he will use his last months as chairman to subpoena Watt if he sees a "scintilla" of evidence that he's holding back from the committee.

RT @vtg2: Grimes‚Äô identity as Mel Watt‚Äôs accuser became public when the FHFA inspector-general sued to compel her to comply with a subpoena‚Ä¶
Lots of male lawmakers are praising Grimes while talking about their daughters, mothers, wives and other women and girls in their lives and how horrified they'd be if something like this happened to them.
Grimes says there were two weekly meetings where Watt would always take a chance before or afterward to make a sexual advance. She said it became hard to foster "enthusiasm" among her staff when "you yourself feel defeated."
Republican and Democrats are going out of their way to praise Grimes, be respectful, and give her extra time to discuss issues at FHFA. This is a far cry from what's going on in the Senate right now.
Grimes is outlining the culture of fear Watt has instilled in the agency since 2014 and fears a brain drain from FHFA employees blocked by him from advancing. "It‚Äôs hard to work somewhere where you‚Äôre in fear," she said. ‚ÄúUsing fear as a tactic has been prevalent for sometime.‚Äù
Waters asks Grimes if she'd like to use her remaining time to say anything else. Grimes cracks a joke about not infringing on her time (remember the Mnuchin hearing?) and says she's appreciative of the chance to testify.
Dynamic to keep in mind here: Republicans have been livid with structure and practices of FHFA for a while now, and the Watt charges are the cherry on top. They've been eager for changes there for a while, and no political incentive to protect Watt like GOP has with Kavanaugh.
Grimes just laid out a very detailed account of Watt's alleged harassment against her and the "hostility, intimidation, bullying, laden with gossip and public shaming‚Äù she encountered from the FHFA inspector general as she looked into Grimes' complaint.
RT @peteschroeder: Watching the Financial Services Committee try to juggle a serious debate on housing finance policy alongside sexual hara‚Ä¶
A few allusions to the Kavanaugh hearing already. Hensarling says it's likely that the Kav hearing will overshadow the Watt hearing. Waters says the Kav hearing is a "travesty" and calls on the Senate Judiciary Committee to hear all of his accusers.
Waters also said she's given Watt's grandson gifts and that if this were a trial, she would need to recuse herself. But it's not, so she's going to be investigating him too. https://t.co/hs6hWQeszb
Waters starts off talking about her longstanding friendship with Watt and his family, but says Grimes has brought "serious" allegations against Watt and that she needs to be heard out and taken seriously."
Hensarling, father of a teenage boy and girl, gets personal. He says its "intolerable" to think that his daughter could be harassed or assaulted at the workplace, and that his son could be destroyed by a "mere allegation of impropriety."
Hensarling says ‚ÄúWe all know that accusations are daily occurrence in this town," but says Grimes brought evidence. Grimes has shared tapes she recorded of Watt making sexual advances on her.
Hensarling on series of scandals plaguing FHFA: ‚ÄúThese headlines are not fake news, and so what we know is that after ten years, housing finance is in dire need of reform and FHFA is in dire need of oversight.‚Äù
House Financial Services Committee hearing on Mel Watt, FHFA and the allegations against him of sexual harassment is moments away from starting. Here's some background as to how we got here. https://t.co/9btHJ1bZYx

Powell is reluctant to say when we might see higher prices driven by tariffs, insisting that "we're not seeing it yet" but wary to say when we might. Also noted that worker shortages and other supply-side constraints could raise prices.

KRANINGER says she had "no role in setting" the Trump admin immigration policy, but adds ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs appropriate, frankly, or fair or right for me to articulate the advice that I have or the characterize the discussion that others may have had or brought to the table.‚Äù
Crapo and Brown duel over Kraninger doc requests. Crapo says they're unprecedented, excessive and unrelated to CFPB nomination. Brown says the WH is blocking answers to simple requests with no started reason.
Crapo on Dems: ‚ÄúTheir requests are designed to go after certain extraneous admin policies that these senators do not like.‚Äù		This sums up the controversy: https://t.co/NCvXmsh04i
Crapo addresses Dem request to delay Kraninger hearing and says it wouldn't be appropriate to demand documents about OMB's internal policy deliberations. He also says Kraninger doesn't have those docs and passed request along to White House.

It's been fascinating to see how Democrats who support tariffs walk the line between defending Trump's trade policy while condemning everything else he's done.
Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), who voted twice to impeach Trump, says his party suffers from "Trump derangement syndrome" in a defense of the president's trade policies on China.
It ended up leading to a question about whether Powell supports US efforts to maintain its own insurance standards separate from international agreements.
Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) is laying into China's trade practices before asking Powell if he agrees with "The president's America First policy," without really specifying how it relates to the Fed at all.
Powell also says he sees more risks and concerns in cryptocurrency than potential use, citing worries about money laundering and terrorism financing. He also said there are too few places taking crypto as payment and the value is too volatile to be a stable store of value. https://t.co/zP4AZiTZt4

Now here's a curveball. White House congratulates House for passing Jobs 3.0 bill, but says Trump wants to "work with Congressional leaders to make several technical and substantive changes to the legislation." That means the House would have to vote on this again.
McConnell: ‚ÄúNow that the House has passed their bipartisan legislation to improve access to capital for communities across the country as they grow and create jobs, Senators will continue their ongoing bipartisan discussions as we work towards a vote in the coming months.‚Äù
Hensarling is retiring this year, so this bill getting signed by Trump would be among his biggest achievements in Congress. But, it depends on 10 Senate Democrats supporting the bill, which is trickier than you'd think given the wide margin of passage in House.
Ryan also has praise for Hensarling, a close ally of his. ‚ÄúThis is a big day for American entrepreneurship and job creation." Ryan calls on Senate to take this bill up, which was part of the deal for House to pass Seante's Dodd-Frank rollback. https://t.co/btftCdvqzo
McCarthy has high praise for Hensarling, who he says "has proven time and again that he cares about crafting bipartisan solutions for entrepreneurs. His approach to build on the success of the first and second JOBS Acts has been creative and inclusive."

@ismurray @BrianRKnight That's where the issues of CFPB's constitutionality are addressed. Most everything before that is focused on the merits of the case/NYAG's authority to pursue it.
Mulvaney has said on several occasions that state AGs should pursue cases where there could be CFPB crossover. He said sometimes CFPB will agree, sometimes even agree and join.
Today's ruling also kicks CFPB off of a case it brought with the NYAG against a firm accused of scamming 9/11 victims, but supports NYAG's authority to pursue suits under Dodd-Frank. That's a green light for state AGs to take actions that also fall under CFPB purview.

Remember, Hensarling also released a ringing endorsement of Kraninger. He's not a senator and has no say over this nomination, but his support can be seen a useful litmus test for conservatives. And we know he's not sheepish about bucking Senate, POTUS on this stuff.
For posterity, here's McConnell's full statement on Kraninger, who doesn't seem likely to get any GOP opposition. https://t.co/TI9PcAUz8D
Next steps for Kraninger nomination:	-Hearing before Senate Banking Committee, which has not been announced yet but could happen at any point now	-Committee vote on her nomination (could be months after hearing)	-McConnell puts nomination on Senate floor
McConnell met with Kraninger today, per office. MM says "she‚Äôs well-suited to continue on the course [Mulvaney] has charted toward transparency, accountability, and effectiveness within proper limits."		Office say Senate will consider her nomination in "timely manner"
In CFPB news, Mulvaney says that if Kraninger isn't confirmed, he could theoretically stay on as CFPB acting chief until *the end of Trump's first term* (it's complicated).		That said, Mulvaney said he expects Kraninger to be confirmed by year's end.
Mulvaney also said that media reports about conditions at the detention were misleading.		"When you come in and say ‚Äòyou‚Äôre keeping people, human beings in cages,‚Äô‚Äô That‚Äôs not factually accurate and it doesn‚Äôt help a debate on the underlying issues," Mulvaney said.
Mulvaney said the separation of migrant children from their families reflects what happens with any parent that broke a US law.		‚ÄúWe are going to detain you, we are going to put you in jail and we are going to separate you from your child. Your kids don‚Äôt go with you to prison."
Mulvaney said that the Trump administration was merely enforcing laws that apply to U.S. citizens and rejected claims that migrant children have been kept in cages.		‚ÄúWhether or not it is humane, it is what we do to American citizens," Mulvaney said.		https://t.co/JZWgvlV1K9

Powell said the lack of higher wage growth despite a tight labor market is "a bit of a puzzle." 		‚ÄúEverywhere we go we hear about labor shortages, but where‚Äôs the wage reaction?‚Äù Powell said.

Hensarling, who's retiring, was term-limited so the top GOP spot on the committee will be open regardless. But Ryan's retirement gives McHenry something more powerful to aim for than FinServ chair (which is still pretty powerful.)
Of course, if the House ends up flipping to the Dems, the race turns into who gets to be the ranking Republican on a panel controlled by Rep. Maxine Waters (D), one of the first reps to call for Trump's impeachment and the spearhead of effort to get docs on POTUS' finances.
Worth noting that the conventional wisdom is that Luetkemeyer would be the clear, if not unanimous, choice to replace Hensarling if McHenry goes for GOP whip as Scalise moves up. It's hard to see McHenry losing that race after his work whipping on tax cuts, ACA repeal.
Luetkemeyer is deeply involved with financial regulatory policy and has been one of the House GOP leaders on attempts to loosen Dodd-Frank. https://t.co/9VrqzkF0Fl
Luetkemeyer: 	-"A lot of dominoes have to fall for me to be able to do this.‚Äù 	-‚ÄúPatrick would be a great committee chairman.‚Äù	-‚ÄúIf he moves up, which he apparently intends to do, I am actively pursuing that position.‚Äù
Luetkemeyer says he will run for chairman of House Financial Services Committee ONLY if Rep. Patrick McHenry runs for GOP Whip. This assumes that Republicans maintain the House. McHenry is GOP deputy whip and could rise to whip as McCarthy and Scalise aim for gavel, majority ldr.
Trump's past comments on Dodd-Frank updates have focused on making it easier for banks to lend to consumers with troubled credit and getting a bill through Congress "fairly quickly." https://t.co/FzeDD4TrDi
Luetkemeyer also said GOP should use power of Trump to help move Dodd-Frank rollback through Congress. But Trump has shown a limited interest in the nitty gritty of financial regulations and banking policy doesn't move votes like taxes &amp;  healthcare‚Äîwhere we saw a lot of Trump.

Mulvaney says "after two beers, I can do a pretty good Barney Frank impression," but unfortunately doesn't do it right now.
Mulvaney again insists that the @CFPB should be actually called the "Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection" per Dodd-Frank, says "CFPB doesn't exist" and that it was probably Elizabeth Warren's idea to call it that.
Warner says housing finance reform, the major policy goal for 2019, will be a much heavier lift than the Dodd-Frank rollback. He says it needs a broader bipartisan consensus to get through.

If the Senate bill gets to Trump's desk somehow, the GOP can easily and accurately sell it as regulatory relief for community banks/credit unions (whether or not you think it's good/needed). That could help for them in Nov! But calling it DF repeal doesn't line up with policy.
The Senate bill to exempt dozens of banks from parts of Dodd-Frank is a notable loosening of the law with broad implications. But it is nowhere close to a repeal-and-replace. It's does far less than the House's effort (CHOICE Act), which also wasn't a repeal-and-replace.

Mulvaney has started the formal (read: lengthy) process of reviewing several aspects of CFPB actions, which could take a long time to yield changes. That's made pressing him on what he wants to do harder for Dems, as Mulvaney demurs on what those changes could end up being.
In sum, Republicans are focused on the long-term trajectory of the bureau and the extent of its power. Democrats are honing in on Mulvaney and his role in that process.
Mulvaney hearing so far: Republicans are pressing Mulvaney on the ins and outs of the CFPB's power and independence. Democrats are searching for any sign of impropriety and dereliction of duty.
We've now reached the portion of the Mulvaney hearing where we re-litigate the causes of the financial crisis, now ten years out from the first bank collapses.

@NivElis "The One Where Phoebe Starts a Trade War"
Trump obviously has a few...other things on his plate right now, but the GOP really wants to pitch a big Dodd-Frank rollback for the midterms and Trump *lives for* undoing major Obama policies. All of that puts pressure on lawmakers to get something passable done.
If you're a supporter of the Senate bill on good terms with Trump, I assume you get in his ear as often as possible and get him to throw his weight behind a bill that's pitched on boosting lending in struggling areas. POTUS has moved votes on Obamacare, maybe he can here.
It'll be interesting to see how active Trump is on this front. He's mentioned taking down Dodd-Frank occasionally since becoming president and has met banking trade groups consistently throughout his term. When he talks about Dodd-Frank, he talks about helping people get loans.
The White House was also expected to weigh in a bit stronger on this, but said last night it would defer to lawmakers how to get an updated bill to him as quick as possible. They gave something for both sides of the argument to hang on.
Here are the three pathways the bill can take:	-The House relents and sends Senate bill to Trump as-is	-Senators cave and go to conference with House, send compromise to Trump	-The House opens bill up for changes, Senate disowns it and it dies.
Getting a Dodd-Frank rollback through the Senate was believed to be the hardest part. That's why senators banked on the House coming along, perhaps with White House pressure. The House is not doing that, and critics of Dodd-Frank are freaking out about missing their moment.
The Senate last night approved the most sweeping changes to Dodd-Frank to earn bipartisan support. Now it heads to the House, where Republicans want more input on the bill before backing it. https://t.co/30Tk9SZKTd
White House on Crapo bill: "The President looks forward to discussing any further revisions the House is interested in making, with the goal of bipartisan, pro-growth Dodd-Frank relief reaching his desk as soon as possible."		This raises more questions than it answerers.

@steveliesman For what it's worth, here's a story I did about that dynamic from last week: https://t.co/xw3zAha8nE
@steveliesman Not sure how to put this into odds but there‚Äôs going to be a ton of pressure on the House to get this done. The House GOP has overruled Hensarling before and they really want to get to yes, especially before midterms. It‚Äôs hard to imagine GOP leaders letting this die.
@steveliesman Hensarling hasn't named any specific adds he needs, but says his panel passed more than two dozen bipartisan bills that should be included. House wanted Senate bill to rein in CFPB and move from hard SIFI cap to multi-factor test, but that probably can't pass the Senate.
We're also a week away from the government funding deadline, which has a tendency to freeze every other major thing that isn't directly involved in it. There's a decent chance this bill takes weeks to get out of the House.
The Senate Dems backing the bill have specifically said they don't want to go to conference and don't trust what the House will do to the bill. Lobbyists pushing the bill say the chances of the bill dying in the House are rising. https://t.co/WEqClw5xkM https://t.co/2tvFTniwk8

Also, Tillerson getting fired while the Senate prepares to pass this bill reminds me of when Comey testified about his firing et al. while the House was passing the CHOICE Act.

@cmholub One specific provision in it, actually.
Elizabeth Warren is now citing the WSJ and Bloomberg editorial boards in Senate floor speech against a bill to loosen banking rules.
And remember what was happening two weeks ago? The Senate debate focused on gun control, which is a lot messier for the GOP than bank deregulation. That's one reason why McConnell pivoted to the Crapo bill for last week.
Meanwhile, the GOP gets to sit back and watch moderate and liberal Dems tear each other apart over this while almost half of the D backers of the Crapo bill face tough re-elects in Trump states this Nov.
Whether the bill makes it out of the House or not (I'm inclined to think that it will), liberal Dems politically benefit from weeks of criticizing banks, very comfortable places for senators like Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown ahead of re-elects.
Once the Senate passes the bill, its future comes down to how many changes the House wants vs. how many changes the Senate will accept. Pressure to deliver big bill right before midterms and fleeting chance to hit DF vs. higher hopes for GOP on policy.

But the House wasn't super stoked about it.  Republicans insisted that any bill that didn't touch the CFPB was a non-starter. Senate bill as written looked dead in the water once it hit the House.  https://t.co/bol4bb6qfm
Any major Dodd-Frank bill needs at least eight Senate Dems to pass (the Senate one has 13). No Democrat on earth would support what the House GOP wanted. Senate went ahead with bipartisan bill, and it's been almost certain to pass from the jump.
How was the CHOICE Act more conservative? Here's a basic overview of the main points of contention House members have with the Senate bill vs. what they put in theirs. 		In short: No action on CFPB, sorting banks by size or govt backstop = no deal. https://t.co/Ac1VOc9gAf
If I may, here's a little thread about how we got here. The House passed their Dodd-Frank rewrite, the CHOICE Act, in 2017. It went way further than the bill the Senate is now considering, and never had a shot past the House.
House Republicans are warming to a Senate deal to cutback Dodd-Frank as the window closes for major changes to the law. But can they get to yes? https://t.co/xw3zAha8nE
Oh, and the Senate just approved the motion to proceed to the Senate bill. That means the next votes will be on ending debate, amendments, and passage. https://t.co/8aicE3W41i
RT @vtg2: This newly added clarification, which says the banking bill won‚Äôt affect current regulation of foreign banks, could save the Fed‚Ä¶
Liberals said that bill didn't make that clear, though its sponsors said the Fed wouldn't loosen rules on those banks anyway. This seeks to end that debate.
Most substantial change to banking regs section: A clarification that the US-based holding cos. for foreign banks with more than $250 billion assets around the world are still subject to stricter Fed oversight.
Substitute amendment to Crapo bill includes changes meant to expand financing options for entrepreneurs, protect military veterans from fraud, create new student loan safeguards and mandate studies on various risks to the financial system. Nothing too juicy on first glance.

Stock market is three minutes from opening for the first time since Cohn resigned. Dow futures are down by 1 percent right now, so it's looking like a fall from the opening bell.

@reporterev I'm still working on my Goodreads review but I will let you know
@reporterev In that it's interesting and you learn a lot about the subject.
@reporterev Indeed. I was an intern at the Dallas Morning News D.C. bureau went it came out in June 2015, so it was part of an assignment. It's actually a pretty good read as far as political autobiographies go.
Cruz writes in his autobiography about how he went by Felito (from his first name, Rafael) until age 13. He switched to Ted, taken from his middle name (Edward), because he was mercilessly bullied by his classmates. https://t.co/Ul7uTyz3Ge
A notable shift on the Crapo bill from some House conservatives I just talked to: Republicans who told me a few months ago they couldn‚Äôt support a bill that doesn‚Äôt touch the CFPB said it‚Äôs no longer a dealbreaker.
@AliWatkins @adamgoldmanNYT That‚Äôs actually a felony in  NY

Forgive me father for I have excessively used em-dashes.
One thing I've noticed in lots of the GOP criticism of Trump's tariffs: Lots of the statements against the plan start off with praise for the tax bill. It almost seems like a "Hey, remember that time we were united and did some good stuff? Let's not mess this up."
This is brilliant. https://t.co/o4R5F7cTYk
@vtg2 For sure!
High praise from another reporter who you should absolutely be following on this bill and all things finreg. https://t.co/yW2SMPVOVY
