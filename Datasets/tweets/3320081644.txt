@CNN Advice: Senate first!
@jodibahr123 Congratulations Jodi!
@teachermantrav I’m so tired of hearing about reading instruction focusing on skills &amp; vocabulary. Reading should be fun!
@BreWingate @teacher2teacher First &amp; foremost-find a way to connect with your students. Be firm, friendly and fair.
@RepAdamSchiff I am 100% on board with using renewable energy in the US. But to legislate a type of renewable energy without understanding all the unintended consequences is a mistake. Please note that the wind turbines interfere with wildlife migration patterns in the Midwest.
@ChuckGrassley Sir, I don’t understand your tweets.
@DeniseLHawk @JFrizzell I would discuss this with her principal if the teacher isn’t willing to listen.
@kasie @jeffzeleny @HillaryClinton Hillary needs to let someone else be the democratic candidate.
@JFrizzell Who still gives 50 Algebra problems? That’s been gone for years! Occasionally homework is given to practice a skill because there’s not evough time in school to do everything.
@SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr It’s time to start compromising! Remember the great compromise?
@ChuckGrassley Stop the fighting! Start working with each other! Comprise!!
@NBCNews If it is aired, I will be turning my TV off. I’m tired of politics.
@ABC He has No idea!
@ScienceNews No! Every little creature has a niche.
@NEGameandParks What part of the state?
@DaRealBradSmith @OWHnews And I enjoy seeing them. We visit the park often. However, you’re not going to see an elk running around the river bottoms or even the forested areas.
@Franklin_Graham What happened? Both of my boys are Eagle Scouts?
@OWHnews I haven’t seen elk in Eastern Nebraska. It would be great if we could choose something that the whole state could identify with. Perhaps a deer
@KenidraRWoods_ All bathrooms should be converted to unisex. All bathrooms need to be private.
@CNN Why?
@Acosta @kwelkernbc @whca Freedom of speech &amp; Freedom of the press?!
@BarbraStreisand Do it again Ms. Streisand! We need hope.
@OWHnews Sad, but a necessity.
@ChemistryWorld Yes. Give credit to the work others have done.
@CNN It’s time for the Clintons to step back &amp; let someone else take the lead.
@rkeith88 I agree this is an example of the double standard. It exists. Hopefully the Clintons stay out of politics in the next election.
@senatorblood And what did you learn?
@NBCNews No!
@SenJohnThune Based on his previous voting record, I don’t believe this is true. He has a pro voucher, anti union, anti collective bargaining position.
@TG2Chat @rickwormeli2 @JoyKirr This is well worth reading!
@cowboysfans1978 @RepAdamSchiff Weather &amp; climate are not synonymous. Weather happens locally due mostly to changes in temperature &amp; air pressure. Climate measured over time &amp; is due to latitude &amp; altitude.	7th grade science!
@senatorblood Glad to see that you support clean energy!
@griswoldkmtv Cucumbers look good. Some of the lighter colored tomatoes could use another day in the sun.
@NPR Why?
@NEGameandParks Only walleye.
@JoshuaGregg Don’t go there! You’re a youngster!
@JoshuaGregg ??? Why not?
@SharriGregg @JOHNNYSWIM Your 3 year old needs to educate Grandma about this!
@ABC @JoshuaGregg Every child needs a dog as a playmate!
@UNL_CYFS @lisaknoche @UNLincoln @earlylearnnet @UNL_CYAF @UNL_CEHS @IESResearch Teachers have been saying this for years! Someone is finally listening.
@JoshuaGregg @MichaelPhelps Go! Go! Faster!
@UHC Your graphic needs a color code key.
@MrsCoover Interesting!
@OWHnews Quest Center!
@Acosta This is NOT how humans should be treated!
@indeed Yes
@JoshuaGregg Why not?	But will you use it?
@j_allen Pressure to perform on high stakes testing.
@rickwormeli2 I almost wish we had a reporting system that shows which skills are mastered in which skill has yet need to be learned. However in the classroom with 25 kids every 43 minutes, I don’t know how we can manage that much data.
@Lennar 3. It’s boring.
@Acosta Not!
@UNL_CYFS @JofSchoolPsych @IESResearch @UNLresearch @u_nebraska Congratulations!  Let’s get this into all schools!
@VisitOmaha Stella’s in Bellevue!
@mrdavidkendall Go team Kendall!
@JoshuaGregg I am a retired teacher. We need to develop caring relationships with people our students! Packing a weapon is counterproductive.
@ChieftainNation Congratulations Jack!
@WOWT6News So, so. Not that impressed.
@NOW1SOLAR Are you kidding??!! I want to add some solar panels to be free from dependence on oil.
@philiplbell @bbarent Love this graphic! Thank you for sharing.
@BradAshford18 How can one choose? They are all important issues.
@BradAshford18 I’m so worried that the tax cuts will affect the cost of healthcare. It’s already very expensive and then for those that have pre-existing conditions we are wondering if we can afford to purchase our medications.
@HuskerFBNation Welcome home Coach Frost!
@SenatorFischer Good bye savings account, vacations, a new used truck. We will be forced to count pennies in order to afford healthcare.
@lifehacker No
@ObamaFoundation Happy Thanksgiving to you!
@Huskers Many thanks to Coach Riley for taking over the Huskers during a time of upheaval. Wishing you the best in your future endeavors.
@MrsCoover Trying to make sense of this. Favorite teachers?
@Huskers It’s not working.
@PhysicsVideo Can we please order this?
@mrdavidkendall @hulu @netflix @amazon @HBO @CBS @Sling Have been thinking about getting rid of cable, but really like being able to record. What do you think?
@PLHSACTIVITIES Congratulations!
