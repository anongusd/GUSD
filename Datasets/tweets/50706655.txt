During #SecondChanceMonth, learn more about housing access for people with arrest and conviction records here: https://t.co/ZxcFQIQyRc #FairChanceHousing
In one study, people with arrest or conviction records who lived on the street were shown to have been rearrested at double the rate of their counterparts who secured housing. That's why we need #FairChanceHousing. #SecondChanceMonth
An estimated four out of five landlords employ background checks to screen out prospective tenants with arrest or conviction records, and Black applicants have been shown to be more harshly screened than White applicants. #SecondChanceMonth #FairChanceHousing
Housing after incarceration can serve as a stabilizing platform where people can get back on their feet, maintain employment, and reconnect with their families and communities, while also reducing recidivism and homelessness. #FairChanceHousing #SecondChanceMonth
In recent years, cities like San Francisco, New York, and DC have passed local ordinances prohibiting housing discrimination on the basis of arrest or conviction history. It‚Äôs time to ban this form of discrimination across the entire country. #FairChanceHousing #SecondChanceMonth
Many landlords in America remain unwilling to rent to formerly incarcerated people, even though there is no evidence that an arrest or conviction record impacts their ability to maintain tenancy. This #SecondChanceMonth, it's time for #FairChanceHousing.
We can and must do better for people in America with arrest and conviction records. #FairChanceHousing is just one example ‚Äì and it's an important one. #SecondChanceMonth https://t.co/EouKiuNKNn

Increasing access to affordable housing is the most cost-effective strategy for reducing childhood poverty and increasing economic mobility. Congress should be EXPANDING investments in proven affordable housing programs. #HandsOff federal affordable housing programs
The best way to help struggling families earn more and get ahead is to expand ‚Äì not slash ‚Äì investments in affordable homes, job training, education, childcare, and other policies to help families thrive. #HandsOff
Taking away housing benefits will make it even harder for struggling families to get ahead and live with dignity. If Congress cuts housing benefits, even more ppl would be homeless, living in substandard or overcrowded conditions, or struggling to meet other basic needs #HandsOff
