@lisa_primas @tombrokaw It‚Äôs not bad to work hard! You‚Äôre an American.  What‚Äôs bad is how White racist Americans think of little brown babies.  There is beauty in diversity but racist people think you‚Äôre beneath them.
@tombrokaw You‚Äôre the HERO this time around! You just shined light to the elephant in the room. Unbeknownst to you, Hispanics are a gift to this country. Assimilation has never been the issue. Look at AOC, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Antonia Novello, Alfredo Quinones, Cardi büòÇüòâ https://t.co/9jwxaucwr9
