#ImpactAid is a non-partisan issue, in a partisan time. It supports military kids, Indian Lands kids, communities where the federal government has taken land. It is a win-win-win.” - @FLISA8002 Past Pres. Tom Schneider
“Please tell your bosses that infrastructure is more than roads and bridges. We have decaying schools...Our schools do not have the bonding capacity to address these issues.” - NIISA Exec. Brent Gish, to congressional staff #ImpactAid #schoolinfrastructure
“School vouchers cannot come from #ImpactAid.” - MISA Exec Kyle Fairbairn, to congressional staff
“When the federal government operates on continuing resolutions, some #ImpactAid school districts have to borrow money to meet obligations like payroll...the interest on those loans is never recovered, and it never goes to educate students.” - NIISA Exec. Brent Gish
“Why can’t we get more money to #ImpactAid to support our military and Indian Lands families? ... The bottom line is the quality of life for kids.” - @MTLLS_50 Pres. Jim Sarruda
97% of military children are educated in public schools (just 11 schools in US are funded by Dept. of Defense). #ImpactAid is critical in providing the resources military students need to thrive.
When #ImpactAid isn’t fully funded, it’s local taxpayers who have to make up the difference. Some districts have to make up millions of dollars because of underfunding to Impact Aid—and they do it by raising taxes. @MTLLS_50
Some Indian Lands school districts have as few as five taxpayers. #ImpactAid is critical to providing educational opportunities for students in those districts.
“The federal government has an obligation to support funding in school districts where it has taken land” for national laboratories, national parks, Army Corps of Engineers projects, etc. #ImpactAid @FLISA8002
Did you know? There are almost 100 million acres of Indian Land in 25 states. Of the $1.3 billion in #ImpactAid, almost $500 million goes to Indian Lands schools.
Panel discussion is starting now - leaders from @FLISA8002, @MTLLS_50, Military Impacted Schools Association &amp; National Indian Impacted Schools Association are explaining the importance of #ImpactAid to congressional staffers. Watch live on Facebook. https://t.co/4xjUD4PiPy
NAFIS priorities for the new Congress: 1) raising the budget caps for non-defense discretionary spending; 2) increasing funding for #ImpactAid; 3) infrastructure funding for federally impacted school districts
Did you know? #ImpactAid serves more than 10 million students in more than 1,300 school districts across the country. https://t.co/6viwv80aNo
“#ImpactAid is very efficient and flexible. Local leaders make every single decision about how the money is spent.” - @hgoldmann
