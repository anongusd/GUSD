1. Ocasio-Cortez	2. Ilhan Omar	3. Rashida Tlaib		Each of them are anti-American &amp; push for radical agendas....		But as soon as someone makes a negative comment about Socialism or Islam, they turn into victims &amp; everybody else becomes a racist.		They are domestic TERRORISTS.

Dear Leftists,		How does “my body my choice” apply to infanticide?		The baby LITERALLY has no connection to the body anymore.		You’re actions are beyond SICK.
The Olympics have officially changed their policies &amp; are now allowing transgenders to compete.		Nice....		In the women's desperate fight for "equality,” they have effectively phased themselves out of the competition &amp; back into the kitchen.		Good work, ladies. 👌🏻
Rashida Tlaib called Mark Meadows a racist on Wednesday for using a black woman as a “prop” during Cohen’s hearing.		Wrong.		Only a true racist like herself would assume that somebody else is a prop simply because of their skin color.		This b*tch needs to go.

Oprah is planning to interview Michael Jackson’s alleged pedophile victims.		Good God....		Hundreds of kids went through Neverland, two made claims, &amp; nothing was proven true.		She’s also the same scumbag who ignored Corey Feldman &amp; was besties with Harvey Weinstein for 20 years.
An heir to the Gambino mob family says Michael Cohen may be in mortal danger when he serves his sentence.		And that’s because the “inmates love Trump &amp; hate rats.”		Interesting....		If he had tried to "testify" against Hillary, he would’ve been dead 3 days ago.
President Trump is currently making history in Vietnam by denuclearizing the North Korean Peninsula.		This is an act worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize....		But the only thing the Fake News Media will cover is the conveniently-timed circus show surrounding Michael Cohen.		Go figure.

The Democrats voted to leave already born infants (who could still be saved) on cold stainless steel tables in dark rooms to slowly die. 		Unbelievable....		If we did this to puppies, liberals would be horrified &amp; demanding prosecution.		Judgement Day can’t come fast enough.
The Democrats BLOCKED a bill that would’ve protected babies from being killed after surviving a botched abortion.		How f*cked up is that?		Killing babies AFTER their birth....		I don’t care what you call yourself - as a human being, this should make you sick to your stomach.
A transgender LGBT activist from Michigan has been charged with a hate crime hoax for setting their own home on fire.		Wow....		I wonder if that was Jussie’s girl? 😂
President Trump just freed a US citizen who was held hostage in Yemen for the last 18 months.		That makes 20 hostages, plus the remains of our dead soldiers, who have been returned under his leadership.		And he’s done it all without giving away billions of dollars or terrorists.
Dear libs,		If Trump supporters were really out there committing hate crimes, why can’t the Democrats &amp; Fake News Media just point out those real-life examples instead of staging &amp; defending hoaxes? 🤔		Think about it &amp; get back to me.

A sports broadcaster in Iowa was suspended for comparing a black basketball player to “King Kong.”		What a bunch of crap.		He was COMPLIMENTING the player’s strength &amp; domination.		But this is the world we live in when brainwashed liberals see everything through the lens of race.

Rep. Justin Amash was the only Republican to join the Democrats in co-sponsoring a bill to block Trump’s national emergency.		Wow....		Why would any sane person be against protecting our own nation from an illegal invasion?		This is what we call a Deep State RINO.
Fun fact.		There have been 45 Presidents.		But only 2 of them have their names on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.		Donald Trump &amp; Ronald Reagan.		This must drive liberals insane. 😂

Jussie Smollett is now telling the police that he has an untreated drug problem.		Wrong....		He has an untreated hate problem &amp; needs to go to prison for faking a serious hate crime that could’ve set off a race war if he wasn’t caught.

Ocasio-Cortez has already committed multiple House ethics violations &amp; cost her state over 25,000 jobs &amp; $26 billion in tax revenues.		What a genius....		This is what happens when Democrat voters elect children to sit at the grownups' table.
Truth bomb for liberals.		The Jussie Smollett case is what happens when the demand for racism is greater than the supply.

How come liberals aren’t boycotting the show ‘Empire’ &amp; demanding Jussie Smollett to be exiled like they did with Rosanne Barr over a joke?		Double standard? 🤔
Dear liberals,		The MAGA hat does not spread racism &amp; hatred.		It only triggers yours.
Over 70,000 people died last year from opioids pouring across our southern border.		That's more than we lost in the twenty years of fighting in Vietnam.		So yeah, I'd call that a crisis.		#BuildTheWall
Rep. Ilhan Omar’s district in MN has the highest number of ISIS recruitments in the entire nation.		But it doesn’t surprise me....		Obama re-settled thousands of Somalian "refugees" into MN with the hopes of getting a radical Muslim like her elected to office.
President Trump has been working for 2 years &amp; has already created 4 million new jobs.		Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been “working” for 2 months &amp; has already lost 25,000 new jobs.		That’s the difference between a businessman &amp; a socialist who doesn’t understand basic economics.
CA plans to sue the Trump administration for declaring a national emergency at the border.		Go figure....		What else would you expect from a communist state that protects illegal aliens via sanctuary cities?		America’s safety &amp; security means less to them than plastic straws do.
Ocasio-Cortez has been in office for less than two months &amp; has already lost her home state 25,000 jobs from Amazon &amp; $26 billion in tax revenue.		Wow....		This is what happens when you elect a ditzy socialist who can’t even name the 3 branches of government.
America’s worst enemy isn’t China, Russia, or North Korea.... it’s the Fake News Media who spreads lies &amp; disinformation in order to cover the crimes of the Democratic Party.		They are a cancer to our nation.		But thanks to Trump &amp; social media Patriots, they are being defeated!
Dear liberals,		If your employer has given you Presidents Day off but “Trump is not your President,” you need to show up to work tomorrow.		Your saying, not mine.

Turns out Jussie Smollett paid two Nigerians $3500 to fake an attack on him &amp; now he’s facing 3 years in prison.		Kathy Griffin: “No one can destroy a career faster than me!”                                               		Jussie Smollett: “Hold my bleach...”

The conviction of El Chapo &amp; the U.S. seizing his $14 billion should be a much larger news story.		But the Fake News Media doesn’t want to promote the idea of Trump using that money to easily fund the border wall.		It would be too devastating to their open borders narrative.

Dear liberals,		What do you call it when a sovereign nation is being infiltrated by millions of ILLEGAL aliens who are smuggling in drugs, weapons, sex slaves &amp; diseases, as well as tampering with our elections &amp; costing the taxpayers $135 billion per year?		A national emergency.
The Democrats want to limit the number of illegal aliens ICE can detain down to 16,500.		We currently have 25,000 criminal detainees - that means 8,500 would be released immediately.		Now why the hell would anybody want to place a cap on the amount of criminals we can catch? 🤔

Do you guys remember during 2008-2016 when conservatives would terrorize liberals for wearing Obama T-shirts?		Yeah.... Neither do I.		And that’s because conservatives aren’t brainwashed idiots who harass &amp; assault other people based on apparel they somehow find “racist.”
Remember when the Left said we weren’t allowed to criticize David Hogg or Emma Gonzalez because they were just “kids?”		Well those same hypocrites have now threatened innocent teenagers to the point their high school had to be shut down for security measures.		Talk about insane.
Dear Fake News Media,		Why won’t you be honest with the American People &amp; issue an apology for spreading false information &amp; doxxing a bunch of high schoolers?		I mean wow....		It’s almost like you’re bought &amp; paid for with a certain agenda to protect. 🤔
Only liberals could believe that smirking is a symbol of white supremacy, drinking beer makes you a rapist, &amp; Buzzfeed is a legitimate news source.
A lawyer has offered to represent the Covington high schoolers for free if they decide to sue the Fake News Media for libel.		Oh man.... That’s awesome.		I hope they sue for 5.7 billion dollars.
President Trump should bring the Covington high schoolers to the White House &amp; let them explain how the Fake News Media is the enemy of the American People.
MLK Day.		A day where liberals pretend to judge people by the content of their character but then go right back to judging them by their race &amp; skin color for the rest of the year.
Here's an actual video of teens harassing a veteran.		Guess the media missed this one at the Kavanaugh hearing. 🙄 https://t.co/Lkdoaa1GMx
What happened between the Native American veteran &amp; the Catholic high schoolers wouldn’t have been a story if the MAGA hats weren’t involved.		But the Fake News Media saw them &amp; thought they could fabricate a story that’d paint Trump supporters in a negative light.		So dishonest.
The Fake News Media was just caught spreading lies from a BuzzFeed article that used anonymous sources.		Now they’re misrepresenting a situation that took place between some Catholic high schoolers &amp; a Native American veteran.		They truly are the enemy of the People.
Did you know?		Over 80% of the human-trafficking victims are women.		But feminists won’t talk about this multi-BILLION dollar industry because it furthers the need for a border wall &amp; they hate Trump too much to admit it.
The Democrats rejected President Trump’s proposal BEFORE they even knew what it was....		But it makes sense.		These political criminals can’t afford to be exposed any further by a wall that effectively reduces illegal immigration, drugs, gang members, human sex-trafficking, etc.
You know what’d be great?		If liberals stopped pretending to care about America while at the same time trying to ruin it by changing our Constitution, erasing our history, destroying our values, opening our borders, &amp; implementing socialist policies that will never be successful.

Pablo Escobar’s brother claims to have raised $10 million in 10 hours towards impeaching President Trump.		Wait.... so the brother of a drug lord wants to impeach the man who wants to build a wall?		Gee. I wonder if it’s because a wall would hurt his family’s business? 🤔
A girls HS basketball coach in MN is crying racism after a group of students for the away team held a “Trump 2020 / Keep America Great!” banner.		Seriously?		The fact that this coach thought a banner was racially charged makes him more racist than anybody else.		Shame on him.
President Trump was spot on in canceling Nancy’s excursion.		800,000 people are waiting without pay while she’s trying to take a week long vacation outside the country.		Stay in Washington, do your damn job, &amp; get a deal done that includes a border wall for our nation’s security.
Nancy Pelosi isn’t worried about the security at the SOTU Address as much as she’s scared of President Trump exposing her &amp; the rest of the Democrat’s complete insanity on a national stage.		And you know that he will.		I’m hoping he brings the Angel Moms she refused to meet with.
Hey liberals,		What if we made the wall similar to Obamacare where everybody who doesn’t want it pays a penalty?		That’d be fair, right?
Nancy Pelosi asked for the State of the Union Address to be delayed until the government re-opens because of “safety concerns.”		Secret Service responded by saying they have it covered....		So she cares about her own security, but not the security of this county?		Go figure. 🙄
Did anybody hear about the CNN analyst who accused a radio host of having “white privilege” before finding out he was black?		Lmao.... 😂		This just proves that “white privilege” has nothing to do with race &amp; everything to do with politics.
Hey @SpeakerPelosi,		Remember when you said we had to pass Obamacare to see what’s in it?		Well maybe we should build the wall to see if it works.		What do you think?

The fiesta Laura Loomer had at @SpeakerPelosi’s house with 3 illegal aliens from Mexico &amp; Guatemala made the front page of the Napa Valley Register today.		That’s the paper that gets delivered straight to Nancy’s mansion in Sanctuary State California! 😂 https://t.co/WC9T5wALNV
Shout out to Laura Loomer for bringing “illegals” to hang out on Nancy Pelosi’s property.		That was hilarious.		Too bad when Nancy said they were welcome here, she meant as far away from her millionaire lifestyle as possible in someone else's home, on someone else's dime.

Fun thought.		Democrats are so insane that we probably could’ve avoided this shutdown &amp; had the wall built TWO YEARS ago if Trump would’ve said he was anti-wall after the election.
The Democrats fought Lincoln tooth &amp; nail to keep slavery.		They lost.		Now they’re fighting Trump to protect illegal aliens.		They will lose again.
A local news station in San Diego said CNN asked them to do a story on the wall - but CNN lost interest after seeing the Border Patrol Agents in it confirm that it works.		Sooo... CNN had the chance to be helpful in ending the shutdown, but chose to be biased instead.		Go figure.
Democrats claim walls don’t work.		Well if that’s the case, why don’t they give Trump the $5 billion &amp; then “destroy” him after it fails?		Riddle me that. 🤔

Nancy Pelosi doesn’t mind spending $54 billion on foreign aid.		But she’s against spending $5 billion in her OWN country that would dramatically strengthen our national security.		Unreal....		President Trump should just declare a national emergency &amp; build the wall TWICE as big.

Last month, Alexandria Occasional-Cortex tweeted “Congressional salaries should be furloughed during government shutdowns.”		Now 2 days ago when asked if she was going to collect her paycheck, she responded with “Gotta run!”		Talk about a socialist in their purest form.
If a Republican would’ve used the same foul language that Rashida Tlaib did, the Fake News Media would’ve covered it for months while liberals cried over it incessantly.		Instead her actions are being defended by the Left as liberals cheer her on.		The double standard is amazing.

Melania is the first FLOTUS to visit an active combat zone since 1969.		That’s an amazing accomplishment that deserves some credit.		But the Fake News Media tries to shift the narrative to anything they can spin as negative - such as Trump “illegally” signing hats for our troops.
Dear Fake News Media,		When are you going to send out a retraction for saying Trump didn’t visit the troops on Christmas?		This man was literally on a flight to an active combat zone with our FLOTUS when you started to peddle this fake bullshit.		YOU are the enemy of the people.
The resistance to the wall isn’t about border security, it’s about who has the most power in Washington.		Chuck Schumer &amp; Nancy Pelosi do not care about your security.		They would rather endanger American citizens than let Trump fulfill another campaign promise.

Two children have died in U.S. custody from being neglected by their own parents.		And liberals are freaking out.		Meanwhile, 18 people died during the Obama administration in U.S. custody due to substandard care.		And liberals said nothing.
Nancy Pelosi says the deaths of two children in U.S. custody is “unconscionable.”		This coming from someone who supports abortion....		The blame needs to be placed on the children’s parents who brought them to the brink of death by dragging them across the Mexican desert.
I'm a hard-working taxpayer that wants the government to use my tax dollars towards securing the border.		$20 billion is chump change for what illegal immigration costs us annually.		Not to mention the lives of people like Kate Steinle we could end up saving.		#BuildTheWall 🇺🇸

Shame on the people who say they’ll give up on Trump if he doesn’t get the wall built.		This man is up against the ENTIRE Swamp 24/7 &amp; has still managed to accomplish quite a lot in spite of it.		I appreciate everything he has done &amp; will continue to stand by his side &amp; fight.
President Trump has vowed the military will build the wall if Congress refuses to fund it.		So you mean our defense budget is going to pay for our defense &amp; not some conflict in the Middle East?		Weird concept.
Just made it to the Minneapolis airport with @E4LDeev.		Next stop is West Palm Beach for the Student Action Summit!		We are super excited &amp; hope to meet a few of you there. 🇺🇸👍🏻		#SAS2018
Thanks to the Fake News Media, liberals immediately blamed our Border Patrol for the death of a child.		But the truth has come out &amp; we now know she died from septic shock thanks to her father dragging her across Mexico.		So when will the Fake News Media issue a retraction? 🤔
Child dies in “Border Patrol custody.”	Liberals blame it on Trump's racism.		Facts reveal that she died of sepsis.	Liberals blame it on Trump's racism.		Her father admits she couldn't eat or drink for days. Liberals blame it on Trump's racism.		Anybody notice a pattern here? 🤔
Prayers for General Flynn.		I’m hopeful that charges against this incredible Patriot will be dropped &amp; the Hammer of Justice will rain down thunder on these crooked bastards within the FBI &amp; DOJ. 		#WWG1WGA 🇺🇸🙏🏻
Dear Mr. President,		Shut down the government.	Build the wall.	Deport the illegals.		The citizens of this country stand behind you.

As somebody who is an avid researcher, I can tell you 100% that Google is corrupt.		They manipulate their search results to leave out conservative information &amp; promote a globalist agenda.		They also retain &amp; sell your information. DuckDuckGo is the better option.		#WWG1WGA 🌎💯
Our ICE agents arrested 6,500 illegal aliens this year who were convicted of murder &amp; sexual offenses.		That’s insane.		ICE also made thousands of arrests relating to drugs, theft, violence, &amp; human-trafficking.		But the Dems hate them &amp; want them gone. Now why would that be? 🤔
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says she’s worried about the top Democratic candidates for 2020 being white.		Wow...		How is that not considered racist?		And why are Democrats so fixated on skin color anyway? Why can’t they judge people on skills, merit, qualification, &amp; character?

Hillary Clinton wrote a letter to an 8 year old girl who lost in a close race to be Class President.		Sad.		I wonder what it said?		“Russia hacked your school election, your classmates are confirmed racists, &amp; you may now blame your loss on everybody else except yourself.”
Happy 6 months to my beautiful girlfriend, @KaelaMiddleton!		I decided to take her to her first Minnesota Vikings game - hopefully they don’t blow this lead.

Shout out to our Border Patrol for busting $7 million worth of meth, cocaine &amp; heroin that was trying to cross our southern border.		That right there is enough of a reason for a border wall - nevermind the BILLION dollar industry of child trafficking that takes place as well.
A student at West Virginia University was INVESTIGATED by the school for posing as a Border Control agent on his Instagram for Halloween.		Are you kidding me?		I’m offended by somebody who could possibly be this stupid &amp; offended.		Can we investigate liberals for being p*ssies?
The Fake News Media is stirring up liberals by telling them a 7 year old girl died in the custody of our Border Control agents.		But they conveniently ignore the fact her parents just forced her to walk thousands of miles across a desert with no food or water.		What a damn shame.

I think it’s funny how the people who don’t know which bathroom to use are trying to teach us about climate change.		Let me educate you.		Climate change is a globalist hoax designed to exert more money &amp; power towards a one world government.		Anybody with half a brain knows this.

A 10 year old kid who calls himself “Desmond Is Amazing” was allowed to dance on stage at a gay bar in Brooklyn 2 weeks ago while half-naked men showered him in money.		F*cking disgusting. This is called pedophilia.		His parents should be arrested &amp; the bar should be closed down.
President Trump said he’s not worried about impeachment &amp; thinks the American people would revolt if that ever happened.		And he’s 100% right.		We The People will NOT keep allowing crooked politicians to undermine &amp; destroy our nation right in front of our faces.		#WWG1WGA 🌎💯

It doesn’t matter if Mexico pays for the wall or not because the wall will end up paying for ITSELF by reducing welfare, crime, drugs, &amp; human trafficking costs.		Anyone against the wall has something to lose - AKA Dems who crave power, want extra votes, &amp; support these crimes.
I don’t care what the Fake News Media tells you.		The biggest bombshell of the day was the Clinton Foundation hearing - which told us the hammer of Justice is FINALLY closing in on the Clintons.		Everything else is a deflection.		#WWG1WGA 🌎🙏🏻

President Trump was the only one trying to be transparent yesterday while Nancy &amp; Chuck kept insisting to meet in private.		Why?		Because they are bought &amp; paid for politicians that can’t afford to have their bullshit exposed on live television.
A small caravan of migrants showed up in Tijuana yesterday demanding that we let them in or give them each $50,000 to turn around.		What a joke - I have a better offer.		We give you absolutely nothing, you all go home, then we allow you to apply for citizenship the legal way.
Both Chuck &amp; Nancy told President Trump they were for border security.		But when Trump mentioned the wall being part of border security, they were highly against it.		And that’s because they know it’s HIGHLY effective at stopping illegal aliens - a huge part of their voters base.
Chuck Schumer: “Elections have consequences Mr. President.”		President Trump: “You’re right. And that’s why the country is doing so well.”

The citizens who are protesting Globalism in France are proudly waving their country’s own flag.		But the tanks that Macron has sent in to stop them that are boldly representing the E.U. flag.		Yet liberals think this is still over a simple tax hike? 🤔
I stand by Kevin Hart.		Pretending to be offended by a “homophobic” tweet from 2011 was the Left’s scapegoat.		They didn’t want him to host the Oscars because he won’t commit to their endless anti-Trump jokes.		In other words, hatred is their fuel &amp; he refuses to give them more.
@Bjam_z I literally mentioned that it was an FBI statistic in my tweet.		Quit being lazy.
Fun fact.		Over 94% of active shootings are stopped or prevented when an armed citizen steps in.		That is amazing.		But you will never hear about this FBI statistic in the Fake News Media.
Kid Rock just covered $81,000 worth of Christmas expenses for 350 Walmart shoppers in Nashville.		Classy move. That’s something those families will remember forever.		Funny how we haven’t heard of Joy Behar doing anything like this to spread joy to the lives of others.
Fun fact.		Illegally crossing the border into Mexico will get you 2-10 years in prison.		But illegally crossing the border into the U.S. will get you an invitation to STAY &amp; show up to a court date.		How is that fair? 🤔
The world is waking up.		Countries in Europe are now screaming “We want Trump!”		And that’s because they recognize the dangers that globalist policies such as mass immigration represent.		They also understand the Fake News Media is being complicit in this cover-up.		#WWG1WGA 🌎💯
The average American has no clue what is taking place in France - nor do they understand its significance.		And that’s because the Fake News Media chooses not to mention it.		They don’t want to illuminate what happens when the citizens reject Globalism.		#GreatAwakening 🇫🇷 🌎
Shout out to our ICE agents for busting 105 illegal aliens over a 5 day operation in New Jersey.		80% of these illegals were already convicted for past crimes including drugs, violence, fraud, &amp; pedophilia.		And this is just a SAMPLE of what the Dems want to let into our country.
I just want to take a moment to thank all of you social media Patriots (no matter how many followers you have) for continuing to speak up &amp; fight for this beautiful nation.		Many of us have taken extreme criticism, but heroes fight the battles that need to be fought.		#MAGA 🇺🇸
Don’t let the media fool you.		What’s going on in France has nothing to do with high taxes &amp; everything to do with the people fighting back against Globalism.		They don’t want their beautiful country &amp; culture to be destroyed by the deliberate influx of immigrants.		#WWG1WGA 🇫🇷

Twitter has PERMANENTLY suspended my friend @LauraLoomer for making a tweet that addressed the dangers of Islam for gay people.		What in the actual hell, Twitter?		Shutting down people who don’t agree with your Leftist echo chamber is literally a Nazi form of censorship.

An American was recently killed when he tried to make contact with an Indian tribe on a remote island.		Apparently this guy was warned many times not to do it &amp; was even attacked by the tribe once already.		Not smart.... Maybe we should send Jim Acosta to investigate?
A federal judge in CA, who was nominated by Obama in 2012, is blocking President Trump from enforcing the asylum ban.		How can a judge tell the President he is not allowed to PROTECT our country from an ILLEGAL invasion?		This should be seen as a traitorous act against America.
I don’t know about you guys, but I’m about to save a ton of money on Christmas presents by discussing politics on Thanksgiving.

Dear liberals,		Stop making the NRA your enemy every time a lunatic shoots someone.		Nobody from the NRA has EVER committed a mass murder.		These are Patriots who carry guns in order to protect themselves, this nation, &amp; even YOU.		They are the LAST people you should hate.
Walmart is selling shotgun shell Christmas lights &amp; liberals are literally being triggered by it.		Imagine being so fragile that a piece of plastic upsets you.		500,000 people shot deer in Minnesota this weekend &amp; nobody died... Because guns don’t kill people, other people do.

Serious question.		Why have elections if Democrats can cheat until they win?		And why vote for Republicans who quietly allow it to happen?
The Democrats claim to be worried about Russian interference in our elections.		Yet they have no problems allowing illegal aliens to vote, “finding” THOUSANDS of ballots DAYS after the deadline, &amp; then recounting when they lose... until they win.		The hypocrisy is mind-blowing.
CNN filed a lawsuit in an attempt to get Jim Acosta’s press pass back.		Sorry, Jimmy.		Press credentials are a privilege, not a right - and when you abuse it, you lose it.		Have fun doing the news from Acosta street.
Disney World suspended a man for holding up a “Trump 2020” sign while riding Splash Mountain.		That’s actually pretty impressive.		Somebody should start him a GoFundMe account so he can travel across America doing this.
Fun fact.		Just last week, in Minnesota alone, there were more than 500,000 deer hunters running around &amp; not one mass shooting took place.		Crazy how that works.
I’m a little pissed off this morning.		How the hell does a Republican Governor in AZ win by 300k votes yet a Republican Senate candidate loses by 30k?		Especially when thousands &amp; THOUSANDS of “uncounted” Democratic votes show up 6 DAYS after the deadline.		Something isn’t right.

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been hospitalized this morning after suffering a nasty fall in her office last night.		Honestly, I hope she is well.		Falling down at the age of 85 &amp; fracturing your rib cage is no small deal.		Perhaps she will think about retirement.
The White House has suspended Jim Acosta’s press pass.		It’s about damn time.		President Trump fielded 68 questions from 35 reporters over an hour &amp; a half span before that grown man-child threw his 1000th temper tantrum.		I’m actually surprised Trump didn’t kick his ass himself.

Fun fact.		100,000 people TRIED to get tickets to the Trump Rally last night in Houston, but only the first 18,000 got in. 		That’s what you call a RED TSUNAMI.		#MAGA 🇺🇸
So Donald Trump has come up with this crazy new idea.		He wants to assign people’s gender to their actual genitalia.		You know, the way God intended it to be.
The Democrats are praying that the caravan of “Hondurans” shows up just before or right on November 6th in an attempt to cause so much mass hysteria that people forget to vote.		Well I have a newsflash for them.		It’s not going to work.		#RedTsunami2018

“But today, our immigration system is broken, &amp; everybody knows it. Families who enter our country the right way &amp; play by the rules watch others flout the rules.”		-Barack Obama,	November, 20th 2014
Hey liberals,		Imagine if these “Hondurans” marched against their own government instead of demanding free shit from ours?		America would be a safer place to live.
If you want America to stay America.		Go out &amp; vote Republican.
How can anybody possibly think Donald Trump is the anti-Christ?		This man literally campaigned on the foundation of Christianity.		And his ACTIONS have ALWAYS spoke louder than his words.		God bless that man for real. 🙏🏻
The mass caravan has swelled to 14,000 people.		Good Lord this is ridiculous.		Like or RT if you are in favor of our military using deadly force if necessary to defend this nation from enemies BOTH foreign &amp; domestic.
What would liberals think if 10,000 Russians started marching toward our border to vote for Trump?		Serious question.
The migrant caravan keeps moving North.		Trump keeps warning them to stop.		I’ll place my bet on Donald J. Trump.		Let the showdown begin.
Elizabeth Warren said she took the DNA test to “rebuild trust” in our government.		How the heck does proving yourself a liar “rebuild trust” in our government?		Nice try, Chief Spreading Bull. 😂
Hey liberals,		If Trump’s America is so racist, how come everyone is trying to come here?		Food for thought.
Shout out to my younger brother, Cole.		This young man is joining the Army.		I’m super proud of you. 🇺🇸
Amy Schumer thinks more white NFL players should take a knee or else they’re “complicit” with racism.		Are you kidding me?		That statement in itself is racist.
Fun fact.		Gitmo has tripled in size since President Trump took over.		Wonder what that means? 🤔
I can understand why people from impoverished nations would want to come to America.		But don’t bring your damn flag &amp; start telling us how we need to change.		This is America, b*tch. 🇺🇸
You know what will be even better than winning the midterms?		Donald Trump Making America Great Again for the next 6 years!		Like or RT if you agree.
President Trump plans to pull the U.S. out of the 1987 weapons treaty we signed with Russia.		This is because they have violated the terms they agreed on.		Interesting.		It’s getting harder for the liberals to scream “Russia, Russia, Russia.”
The migrant caravan has swelled to 10,000 &amp; have continued marching towards our border.		I would say if they attempt to enter the US illegally, they should be considered enemies &amp; our military should act accordingly.		We don’t play around in America.
The fact of the matter is anything digital can be compromised.		That is why it’s important to request a PAPER ballot on Election Day.		Goerge Soros owns the SmartMatic voting machines.		And those will be located in AZ, CO, FL, MI, NV, PA, VA, CA, DC, IL, LA, MI, NJ, OR, WA, &amp; WI.

A pizza driver named Dalton Shaffer drove 500 miles to deliver a specialty pizza to a terminally ill man. 		With so much negativity in the world, it’s amazing to hear stories like this.		God bless that man. 🙏🏻
A female cyclist claims it’s “not fair” after losing the Cycling World Championship to a transgender “woman.”		Weird.		It’s almost like there’s a biological difference between men &amp; women.
The migrant caravan is a Democratic ploy to cause a massive disturbance before the election.		But it’s not going to work.		Thank God for President Trump &amp; his fearless actions.

Hey Democrats,		We can play this game too.		Maybe Trump should release the names of people in Congress who have settled sexual harassment cases with our taxpayers’ money.		Checkmate.
I’m really hoping Kavanaugh presses charges against these fake accusers once he is sworn in as a Judge.		False accusations need to have real consequences.
No man is safe anymore if we are going to believe any woman that accuses a man of sexual harassment WITHOUT due process.		#IStandWithBrett #HimToo	#ConfirmKavanaughNow
I think listening to both sides is important, but the Left is completely insane on most issues.		At this pace, the midterms will be a RED TSUNAMI.		Don’t be surprised if the Democrats pull off a MAJOR false flag attack.		Either way, it will be their demise.
Starting today, I am going to be a better person.		I’m going to spend more time with my family.		I’m going to listen to others.		I’m going to make sure I do what’s best for our country.		I’m going to try to walk in the footsteps of Christ for the rest of my life.		#MDGA

Dear liberals,		Only 1.6% of U.S. citizens owned slaves in 1860 - when slavery was at its peak.		So you can stop basing your misguided hatred for the white race on the actions of a small percentage.		Thanks!		(U.S. Government Consensus 1860)

The Deep State uses the Fake News Media to distract from their crimes against humanity.		They understand that division &amp; hate among the people is the most effective way to keep us occupied &amp; ignorant while they rob us blind.		But their days are being numbered.		#TheStormIsHere
The Fake News Media said Trump colluded with Russia to win the presidency. They lied.		They said he would collapse the economy. They lied.		They said he would get us into war with North Korea. They lied.		That’s because the Fake News Media is owned by the Deep State.		#WWG1WGA

The media is already done talking about Jacksonville because the shooter didn’t fit their narrative.		He was a crazy liberal who called Trump supporters “Trumptards” &amp; “mentally challenged.”		Gun violence would practically disappear if Left-wing nut-jobs stopped shooting people.
Fun fact.		Barack Obama was fined $375,000 for campaign finance violations in 2008.		And NOBODY discussed impeachment.		But how would the liberals &amp; the Mainstream Media be reacting if President Trump had done the same thing?
Hey liberals,		I know what happened in Jacksonville sucks, but why don’t you get this upset when 10 TIMES as many people die EACH weekend in Chicago?		Is it because they’re mostly black? Is it because illegal guns are being used? Or is it because the media doesn’t tell you to be?

The same liberals who were calling John McCain a “white supremacist” in 2008 are the same ones who are now trying to lift him up as a saint.		And that’s ONLY because of how anti-Trump he was.		If he had been pro-Trump, their comments right now would be completely reversed.
Navy Veteran Kevin Smith is being charged with assault for jumping over a court railing &amp; beating the hell out of a “pastor” who sexually abused his child.		This man shouldn’t be charged with anything - he should be awarded Father of the Year.		I’ve got your back, brother!
Listen up, liberals.		“Politicizing” the death of Mollie Tibbetts is NOT the same as politicizing mass shootings.		You guys are trying to remove a Constitutional Right.		We just want our illegal immigration laws to be ENFORCED.		Learn the difference.
I’m not someone who likes to piss on the graves of dead people.		But I’m also not someone who will stop calling a spade a spade.		John McCain tried to frame President Trump by giving James Comey the fake Russian dossier that Hillary paid for.		I call that a disgrace.
If Mollie Tibbetts had been shot &amp; killed by what Democrats call an “assault rifle,” instead of being butchered by an illegal alien, liberals would have been marching in the streets the next day demanding we change the law.		Their hypocrisy never ends.
My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to the people of Jacksonville tonight.		The victim’s bodies aren’t even cold yet &amp; the Democrats are already pushing their gun control narrative.		This is not a gun problem, it’s a people problem. People being dumb enough to think gun-free zones work.

Mollie Tibbetts was a hardcore liberal who made tweets about hating President Trump &amp; white people.		You would think if anybody had her back, it would be the Democrats.		But they don’t.		Her brutal death by the hands of an illegal alien doesn’t fit their narrative.

Instagram also removed my post &amp; threatened to delete my account because I called Omarosa a “snake.”		Yeah... a SNAKE.		Meanwhile, liberals are posting “artwork” of Trump being assassinated &amp; it doesn’t violate their community standards.		There’s a reckoning coming this November.
Facebook suspended me for 30 days because I said the “Fake News Media would downplay the story of Mollie Tibbetts the same way they did with the M***** terrorists training kids to shoot up schools.”		Silencing conservatives is their desperate attempt to influence the midterms.

Hey liberals,		Have you ever noticed that no matter how many people are shot &amp; killed in Chicago, the media never talks about what kind of gun was used?		Now why is that?		Think.
Ancient Aliens on the History Channel is doing better than CNN during their primetime slot.		That’s because one of these shows is a ridiculous collection of fictional stories &amp; made-up propaganda.		The other one is Ancient Aliens.
Netflix is in trouble for allowing a movie that contains incest &amp; graphic child porn in it.		Of course they had this.		The Left is trying to normalize these actions before the people within our government &amp; Hollywood are exposed for being Satanic pedophiles.
Anyone remember that kid who became famous for blaming the NRA &amp; law-abiding citizens for school shootings last year?		His name was David Hogg &amp; he has nothing to say about the gun crime in Chicago OR the Muslims who were training school shooters.		He was a puppet for the media.
Liberals scream, cry &amp; protest when kids are shot in our schools.		But they don’t say a damn thing when Muslims are caught training our kids how to carry out those shootings.		And that’s because they’re cowards who don’t want to offend Islam - the so-called “religion of peace.”

Omarosa told Al Sharpton that Trump wants to "start a race war."		Wrong.		She’s confusing Trump with the previous President.		Her sudden hatred for Trump is because she was fired for being a snake &amp; now has a million dollar breach-of-contract lawsuit being filed against her.

Liberals are mad that Trump called Omarosa a “dog.”		Man, these people are wimps. I’m not sure Trump could have used a better term.		She bit the hand that fed &amp; employed her for years - only a rabid dog would do that.
A second woman has now accused Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison of domestic violence, &amp; a 911 police report supports the woman’s accusation.		Where the hell is the mainstream media on this?		@LauraLoomer 	https://t.co/qX9QDRYbot

Shout out to @LauraLoomer for the work she is doing in my home state of Minnesota.		Nobody else has the guts to confront &amp; expose the Muslim Jihadists trying to infiltrate our government.		Having them in Congress would be a threat to our national security.	https://t.co/etAEgO7sDQ

Keith Ellison has been accused of beating his girlfriend.		If he was a Republican like Roy Moore, his career would be over already.		But since he’s a Democrat, the media won’t cover it &amp; turn it into a story.		Plus this guy operates under Sharia Law.... which permits women abuse.

Last weekend 66 people were shot &amp; 12 people were killed in Chicago.		And it was COMPLETELY ignored by the mainstream media.		Also, where the hell is that David Hogg kid?		Or does gun violence in a city run by Democrats with strict gun control not fit his gun-grabbing narrative?
Rosie O’Donnell says “Trump pays people to show up at his rallies.”		That’s wrong &amp; she knows it.		Trump is filling up arenas faster than the NFL.		Maybe she was thinking of the DNC who paid people to disrupt his rallies so the media could try to spin them as being violent.
Dear NFL,		The easiest decision true Americans will ever make is choosing our Military, Veterans, Flag, &amp; Anthem over millionaire athletes.		A football game has zero impact on our lives, but those who stand up for our country make the ultimate difference.		Signed,	We The People

In response to Hollywood voting to remove Trump’s star from the Walk of Fame, a few street artists decided to place more of his stars across the famous sidewalk.		Clever people.		They are proving that you can make a statement without being violent &amp; destructive.
We need to stop calling them “Democrats” &amp; start calling them by what they really are - socialists &amp; communists.		Because those are the ideologies they have embraced.		By not calling them that, we give them a shield to hide behind while they peddle their bullshit to the masses.

The city of San Francisco is receiving nearly 80 calls per day to have the poop removed from their sidewalks.		I know crapping in public is disgusting &amp; all, but at least no one has to inhale the horrible stench of plastic straws.

Voting should require a voters ID to prove you’re a legal U.S. citizen, strict security at all voting booths, &amp; a pencil &amp; paper to cast your vote - anything digital is not secure.		And any state that does not follow these rules should have their electoral college votes void.

Tonight I will be doing an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on Reddit.		I will also announce the official title to the book @realTylerZed &amp; I have been working on.		Feel free to join the chat &amp; ask me some questions. Starts at 8 ET.		Here’s the link!		https://t.co/uBSya27XvV
I love how any time Trump does something, the Democrats pretend to be outraged over it.		Then we find archived videos of these same Democrats saying the exact same things.		Every. Single. Time.		So what’s the problem?		He walks the walk, while they talk the talk to stay in power.
*Trump meets with Putin*		Liberals: “Omg, why wasn’t he tougher on Russia?!”		*Trump responds to Iran’s threats*		Liberals: “OMG, He’S gOiNg To StArT a WaR!!!!!”
Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, &amp; John Kerry.		All of them have met with Vladimir Putin &amp; none of them were questioned by the media for it.		But as soon as Donald Trump does it, they crucify him as a traitor to the highest degree. 🤔
I’m starting to get pissed off with the Left’s attempt to normalize pedophilia.		They claim that some adults can’t help their feelings towards children &amp; we should accept them for who they are.		Bullshit.		I can think of a cheap cost to permanently cure that kind of sickness.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is just the knockoff female version of Bernie Sanders.		Hey @Ocasio2018, why don’t you broadcast your next rally from Venezuela so you can demonstrate the benefits of taking everyone’s money &amp; establishing a Socialist Utopia?		I think it would be helpful!
I have an idea.		President Trump should cancel Obama’s passport while he’s currently in Africa &amp; then make him prove he’s an American citizen before he can return.		I have a feeling Kenya would be getting their village idiot back.
Andrew Cuomo has granted pardons to 24,000 parolees so they can vote.		This includes convicted sexual predators, rapists, pedophiles, &amp; a man known as the "voodoo rapist."		He also pardoned 7 illegal aliens to help them avoid deportation.		Illegals &gt; Citizens		Wake up, New York!
The next ‘Predator’ movie is going to feature female Predators.		Great... There won’t be any fighting, just female Predators sitting around, drinking wine, &amp; complaining about how horrible the male Predators are.		Oh, wait.		We already have that show.		It’s called The View.

Stormy Daniels is getting a divorce from her husband.		And now she is asking that we give her “privacy for the sake of her family.”		ARE YOU KIDDING?		Maybe we should give you &amp; your family the SAME level of privacy you &amp; your creepy porn lawyer gave President Trump &amp; his family.
Trump may revoke security clearances for Brennan &amp; other top Obama officials.		And he should!		ALL former gov’t employees should lose it when they leave the job.		If we leave a job, our former employer doesn't keep giving us info about their business. So why does the gov’t do it?
A popular show called “Supergirl” is about to introduce the first transgender superhero.		Now I’m a pretty tolerant person, but this concerns me for the sake of my future children.		The degenerative movement to normalize the .3 percent of our population is alarming.

Democrats don’t give a damn about human-trafficking.		If they did, they would not be against ICE, the wall, &amp; giving DNA tests to children at the border.		The ONLY thing they care about are the votes needed to stay in power, even if that comes at the expense of innocent children.
Hillary called Trump’s meeting with Putin “deeply disturbing.”		Oh really?		Disturbing like the uranium she sold Russia? Disturbing like the relief funds she stole from Haiti? Disturbing like the Americans she let die in Benghazi?		Or disturbing that Putin might double-cross her?
Natalie Portman made a video for PETA that compared eating meat to the Holocaust.		That’s insane.		Especially coming from someone who is pro-choice.		So we shouldn’t eat meat, but ripping babies apart limb by limb from a mother's womb &amp; selling them to the highest bidder is cool?
Hillary says “President Trump wants to be friends with Putin for reasons that we’re all still trying to figure out.”		Don’t worry, Hillary.		At some point the ENTIRE WORLD will figure out why you said “If that f*cking bastard wins, we all hang from nooses.”

The NFL has decided to put their new “stand for the anthem” policy on HOLD.		The unbelievable disrespect towards our county &amp; the people who fought/fight to give us our freedom continues.		If I were the commissioner &amp; somebody kneeled, they would be banned from the NFL for life.

Obama called for the rich to close the wealth gap by saying “There’s only so big a house you can have.”		He also just bought an $8.1M mansion in Washington, D.C.		The Democrats’ slogan should be	“Do as I say, not as I do.”		By the way, that mansion will have a wall around it.

Socialism: Let’s steal their stuff!		Democratic Socialism: Let’s vote on whose stuff to steal first!
Liberals are so mad at President Trump you would think he stole 90% of the Haitian fund relief, sold 20% of our Uranium to Russia, &amp; let innocent Americans die in Benghazi.
“What I say to President Putin is... there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be able to cooperate more effectively than we do.”		- Barack Obama, August 6, 2013		So where was the liberal outrage 5 years ago?		Or did the fake news media not tell them to get upset?

Hey liberals,		Let’s go over Putin’s evil plan to destroy America.		- Get Trump elected	- Secure the borders	- Rebuild the military	- Create booming economy	- Create US energy independence	- Fix &amp; secure national infrastructure		Yeah... 		Makes total sense.
You have to ask yourself what the hell is wrong with this world when liberals would rather have our President start World War 3 than work towards peace &amp; prosperity?		Things are starting to get Biblical.		They might want to think about getting right with God.
The Left is freaking out over Trump’s comments about our intelligence agencies.		They are outraged that he didn’t put “our own” agencies first.		This is coming from the same people who put illegal aliens &amp; violent MS-13 gang members ahead of our own legal taxpaying citizens.

The MSM is talking about...		-The NoKo deal going south.		-China going against the USA in trade.		-Europe against Trump’s visit.		-Russia being labeled as a mafia.		All of this is fake news meant to distract from the Democrats’ crimes.		They are scared &amp; they damn well should be.
Hey Democrats,		You don’t want foreign countries meddling in our elections, do you?		Then maybe we should make voter ID’s mandatory to ensure only American citizens are voting.		Good idea?		Or would that destroy your open borders narrative?
Planet Fitness banned a woman for refusing to share a locker room with a transgender man.		Let's try to wrap ourselves around this dilemma...		A woman had an issue with a MAN being in the WOMEN’S locker room &amp; SHE'S the one with the problem? 🙄		No wonder our society is decaying.

**BREAKING NEWS**		President Putin released the identities of the Russian spies who influenced &amp; rigged the 2016 election.		Barack Obama	Hillary Clinton	George Soros	Peter Strzok	James Comey	Loretta Lynch	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	John "Pedo" Podesta	Andrew McCabe		Plus MANY more!
Sadly, the biggest threat to our country is not Russia, China or North Korea.		It's CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, CBS, The Washington Post, Huffpost, The NY Times, &amp; every other fake news network that spreads dangerous disinformation &amp; hateful propaganda.
Hey libs,		If gender does not exist, how can the gender wage gap exist?		And if you’re upset with women being paid less than men, why don't women just identify as men?		Chew on that bite of logic for a moment &amp; get back to me.
In reference to meeting Putin, Hillary asked President Trump “which team he played for.”		That’s funny, because I have the same question for her...		Which team abandons its teammates in Benghazi, sells uranium to hostile countries, &amp; then complains when Trump puts America first?
Liberals are freaking out over President Trump meeting with Putin.		Seriously?		Where was this outrage when Obama met with Putin AND told him he would have “more flexibility after the election?”		Or when Hillary sold Russia 20% of our Uranium? - Which is used for nuclear weapons!

Dear Great Britain,		Allow me to rebuttal your protest.		July 4th, 1776.		The exact date America stopped caring about your political opinions.
The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan defended the Trump blimp as being “part of free speech.”		He believes in free speech?		Then why are people in his city being sent to jail over “offensive” Facebook posts?		And why is Tommy Robinson sitting in prison for exposing Muslim pedophiles?

London flew a large blimp of President Trump depicted as an angry baby over their city today.		Sorry, but we stopped caring about your opinions on July 4th, 1776... &amp; STILL saved your asses in WWII.		Maybe they should focus on the fact they’re turning into a 3rd-world country. 😏

Stormy Daniels’ lawyer said her arrest for inappropriately touching a police officer was “politically motivated.”		Politically motivated?		You mean like her claims against President Trump in an attempt to ruin his name &amp; reputation?		Sounds like karma to me.
Chuck Schumer says “President Trump should not meet with President Putin alone.”		Oh really?		Where was this advice when Bill Clinton met privately with Loretta Lynch on the tarmac while Hillary was under investigation?		That’s what I thought.

A CNN host recently compared Christianity to Sharia Law.		Are you kidding me?		I dare anyone to read the New Testament &amp; the complete, accurate description of what Sharia Law is &amp; then make that comparison.		The utter ignorance &amp; insanity of this CNN host is borderline criminal.
Serious question.		What if we renamed ICE to “Planned Citizenship” &amp; then changed deportations to “aborted naturalizations?”		Would liberals be okay with it then?
Protestors shut down a highway in Chicago demanding their public officials do more to stop gun violence.		Wait...		Why didn’t they protest in the hood?		And if Chicago already has strict gun control laws, why aren’t they working?		Oh, yeah...		Because criminals don’t follow laws.
I absolutely love that fresh smell of MAGA in the morning.		So what are we offended by today, liberals?
Democrats in 2016: “If Trump wins he will crash the economy!”		Reality in 2018: Trump has created over 3.7 million new jobs, the stock market is at record highs, consumer confidence is at an 18-year high, &amp; the Black, Hispanic &amp; Asian unemployment rates are each at all-time lows.
If you want to see how liberals truly feel about minorities, watch how they treat one who doesn’t agree with their ideology.		Kanye West was a great example.
Chuck Schumer reportedly had a 5 minute phone call with President Trump privately asking him to pick Obama’s failed Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.		I also heard that 4 minutes of that 5 minute phone call was President Trump laughing. 😂
I saw many people wearing Obama shirts &amp; hats during 2008-2016, but NEVER ONCE did I think about assaulting them.		Because that’s what FASCISTS do.		They attempt to silence anyone who does not share their same views.		Today’s libs are fascist in the true sense of the definition.

A writer at The Guardian blamed Trump as the reason she stopped going to the gym, which resulted in her not being able to open jars anymore.		If a liberal can’t open a jar, it’s probably because they were turning it the wrong way - which is completely in line with how they think.
President Trump is the greatest thing that has ever happened to America in my lifetime!		Let’s keep this movement going in November &amp; take our country back.		Vote Red or America’s Dead.
President Trump just said he would donate $1,000,000 to the charity of Elizabeth Warren’s choice if she took a DNA test that proved she had Indian heritage.		This man is a savage! 😂
Crazy hypocrisy.		Today @LauraLoomer debated the @browardsheriff’s CRIMINAL DEFENSE attorney!		Turns out Sheriff Israel’s attorney is a former FBI AGENT who is also representing the gun store that sold the #Parkland Shooter the AR-15 used in the shooting!		https://t.co/aNC84qUzIm
Last Saturday I passed my Certified Residential Appraiser exam.		Yesterday I celebrated the 242nd birthday of the greatest county on earth.		And today I graduated college with a major in Organizational Behavior &amp; a minor in Psychology.		It’s been an AWESOME week.		God is good! 😇

Colin Kaepernick just received a civil rights award from the National Education Association.		That’s ridiculous.		The only thing he helped educate us on was the idiotic nature of rich spoiled athletes.

Is it considered “cultural appropriation” if a liberal dresses up in red, white &amp; blue today?		You know, since most of them hate everything America stands for.
Pro-abortion women are starting a “sex strike” to save abortion.		Soooo... their plan to save abortion is to practice abstinence?		The thought process of the Left is unfathomable.
A kids’ clothing store removed a shirt with the phrase “Boys will be boys” on it because a woman got angry &amp; claimed it was sexist.		DUMB.		I’d make one that says “Boys will be boys unless mommy is a feminazi &amp; beats the toxic masculinity out of them. Then boys will be soyboys.”
@LauraLoomer Lmao!!! It’s like they were listening to our conversation...		I usually don’t workout with my shirt off, but I think I’m gonna start doing it just to piss them off even more!		Hey ladies, follow me on the gram for some “toxic” masculinity! 💪🏼😎🇺🇸😂	https://t.co/s7ukICDuPt
Tip for Conservatives.		Ignore the trolls/haters.		Soros &amp; his wealthy friends literally pay people to be professional internet trolls in order to further the division in our society.		It’s the same way they provide bus tickets, t-shirts, signs &amp; paychecks for people to protest.

In Venezuela, protestors are in the streets resisting socialism.		In America, liberals are in the streets DEMANDING socialism.		Well here’s a simple solution for you empty-headed liberals...		MOVE TO VENEZUELA.		At least there you will have an equal right to starve to death.
We’ve come to the point where Democrats are openly defending rapists, murderers, child-traffickers, pedophiles, criminals, &amp; spirit-cooking satanists.		Meanwhile referring to Christians, Conservatives, &amp; our President as “evil Nazis.”		May God have mercy on their souls.		#WWG1WGA
A new report tells us that Obama didn’t just give $150B to Iran (in return for nothing), he also granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians, including family members of government officials.		So where is the public outrage?		Oh, yeah.		He was the “Chosen One” by the fake news media.
Liberals are starting to turn on Bernie Sanders because he doesn’t believe in abolishing ICE.		Lmao. 😂		You know you’ve gone off the deep end when even Bernie Sanders isn’t socialist enough for you!
Democrats want to abolish ICE.		ICE has arrested over 7,000 MS-13 gang members.		These animals smuggle drugs, traffic children, &amp; brutally murder innocent people.		So why do Dems protect them?		Because most MS-13 members are illegal aliens &amp; they’ll do anything for an extra vote.
Episode 9 of the E4L Podcast with @LauraLoomer is now available!		On this episode, @realTylerZed &amp; I talk with Laura about her assault charges against Maxine Waters, the Las Vegas Massacre, the dangers of Islam, plus more!		Check it out / subscribe below!	https://t.co/vYFgRyKrHy
Actor Ron Perlman tweeted at President Trump saying “A black man beat you in every single f*cking department.”		In what way?		Obama put more people out of work, more people on welfare, caused more people to lose their homes, &amp; raised the cost of health insurance.		Great job. 👍🏻
There are over 400,000 kids in foster care &amp; 2,500,000 HOMELESS kids in America.		But liberals would rather march for the 2,500 kids at the border who have food, shelter &amp; medical care.		Un-f*cking-believable.

Conservatives are protesting outside of the Red Hen that was disrespectful to Sarah Sanders.		Notice how Republicans have to protest on Sundays?		That's because we have jobs &amp; don't live in our parents’ basement waiting on a Craigslist ad for a Soros paid protest.		Just saying.
I still can’t believe what would’ve happened if Hillary won....		The FBI, DOJ, &amp; DNC would have successful manipulated a Presidential election without most people ever knowing.		And we may have lost our Republic.		I’m just thankful that Putin made me vote for Trump! 😂

Michael Moore is trying to stop Trump’s SCOTUS nomination by calling for a million people to surround the U.S. Capitol.		Interesting.		I forgot about the part in the Constitution where it says "fat loser &amp; his friends can block Supreme Court nomination by whining."
Don't worry, libs.		No one is coming after your abortions. We just want common sense abortion control.		Sound familiar? 😎😂
Stand strong, @realDonaldTrump!		The Left is in pure panic mode. You are on the right track &amp; so many of us support you. Many more than the Left realizes. And those who remain silent are secretly rooting for this major political correction to continue.		#MAGA 🇺🇸
CNN accused Melania of “staging photos” on her trip to the border to visit kids in detention centers.		At least she’s making an effort &amp; showing some compassion.		Michelle &amp; Barack never had a photo op at the border, staged or real.		They didn’t care.		And neither did the media.
Did you know?		2,700,000 kids have a parent in prison.		400,000 kids are in foster care.		And 765,000 kids are separated from their military parents not knowing if they’ll see them again.		But the media focuses on 2,000 kids who are temporarily separated from illegal immigrants.
Maxine Waters said if you shoot at her, “you better shoot straight.”		Calm down, spaz.		Nobody from the Republican Party wants to cause harm to one of our most valuable assets.		You’re doing an excellent job of discrediting the Democratic Party all by yourself.
You can make jokes about anything, except for Mexicans.		That’s crossing the border. 😂
The manager of a restaurant in Canada was fired after he told a customer to remove his “Make America Great Again” hat or he would refuse to serve him.		Isn’t that amazing?		A $10 hat with the priceless &amp; unlimited power to melt &amp; trigger snowflakes around the world. 😂

“Healthy at any size” is an EXTREMELY terrible lie.		Obesity is responsible for over 300,000 deaths per year. Guns are only used in 33,000 deaths (21,000 from suicide).		So why aren’t people marching against this epidemic?		Because there’s no political gain in regulating obesity.

Barack Obama said “people were too focused on him” &amp; that’s why the Democrats lost the 2016 election.		That’s because you were the biggest disgrace as President in American history.		Having Crooked Hillary as your nomination didn’t help you either.		Thank God for President Trump!
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand said, “We need to abolish ICE, start over &amp; build something that actually works.”		Wrong.		We need to start showing ICE agents the respect they deserve for risking their lives each day to keep us safe.		It’s time to abolish the Democratic Party instead.
President Trump is announcing the next Supreme Court Justice on July 9th.		DANG....		I was really hoping he would make this announcement on July 4th so I wouldn't have to buy any fireworks.		I could just sit around &amp; watch liberals’ heads explode instead.
Tim Allen has announced Season 7 of ‘Last Man Standing’ will start on September 28th, 2018.		Can’t wait!		Could you imagine if they introduced Roseanne as a character on the show?		Their ratings would be HUGE.
I’m not a fan of violence, but I do believe in self-defense. And trust me, the Left doesn’t want a civil war.		Our side has 300M+ guns, a TRILLION+ rounds of ammo, the military &amp; police.		Theirs has vagina hats &amp; doesn’t know which restroom to use.		It’d be an amusing 57 seconds.

CNN released an article that read “Trump’s wall could cost an estimated $120 per US household.”		Seriously?		That’s a hell of a lot better than the $115 BILLION we spend ANNUALLY on illegal aliens ($8,000 each).		I only have 2 questions...		Cash or check?		And where do I send it?
Why would the Democrats have a problem with Trump appointing a Supreme Court Justice that upholds the Constitution of the United States?		The answer is simple...		They want to DESTROY it.		Vote Red or America’s Dead.
I love how Twitter will instantly remove 2000+ of my followers every now &amp; then like I won’t notice.		They used to do it in smaller chunks of 100 to 200 at a time, but they’re getting bolder.		Shout out to everyone who keeps re-following me despite Twitter trying to slow me down!
Whoopi Goldberg told President Trump's future SCOTUS pick to “get out of my vagina."		Relax, Whoopi.		I think I speak for 99.998% of the human population currently inhabiting the United States of America when I say none of us want to be anywhere near your vagina.
The shooting in Annapolis, MD.		No AR-15.	No kids harmed.	No right-wing shooter.	No connection to Trump.		Won’t be long before the media drops this story.
It’s pretty sad, but the liberal media, Democrats, &amp; Hollywood have become more dangerous than terrorists at this point.		They flood every news station &amp; social media platform with NONSTOP hate &amp; calls for violence, then act surprised when it happens.		Vote Red or America’s Dead!

Dear border-jumping, law-breaking, child-endangering immigrants....		You would be surprised how welcoming the tax-paying, law-abiding, American citizens are to those that come here legally. 		Come here illegally, not so much.

Today's Supreme Court decision to uphold the travel ban is a win for our Constitution &amp; the safety of America. 		The ban is not against a religion, it’s to ensure we properly vet those coming from countries known for terrorism.		The fact that liberals conflate the two is on them.
Even NANCY PELOSI said Maxine Water’s call to harass Trump supporters was “unacceptable.”		When Nancy Pelosi is the voice of reason, you know you've gone too far.
The media is trying to say that the executive order signed by President Trump was strictly to ban Muslims.		That’s fake news.		Out of the 10 most populated Muslim countries in the world, only 1 of them is included in the travel ban.		(Iran - which is 9th on the list)

Democrats are pissed about the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the Muslim-country travel ban.		Yes.		The same Muslim-country travel ban that was implemented by Obama himself.		You know you’re on the right side when Democrats start siding with countries that sponsor terrorism.
The Supreme Court has ruled 5-4 in favor of President Trump’s travel ban on five Muslim-majority countries.		The winning continues!		It must be very painful for the media to have to report so many Trump victories.

Maxine Waters is the gift that keeps on giving.		Every time she opens her disgusting, hate-filled mouth, another Conservative is born.		Keep up the “great” work! 👍🏻
Do you guys remember that time when 2 nonpaying customers got kicked out of a Starbucks &amp; liberals threw such a big temper tantrum that their employees were forced to take “diversity training”.... then 8 paying customers were kicked out of a Red Hen &amp; they cheered?		I remember.
Dear liberals,		The United States Constitution was written to protect American citizens.		If you were not born here &amp; do not have legal status, then you are not a citizen.		Now read this twice so it has a chance at sinking in.

Liberals think public servants should be kicked out of restaurants for having different political beliefs, but illegal aliens shouldn't be kicked out of the country for breaking the law.		Sad.
I heard there’s a place that lets Mexican families stay together instead of being forcefully separated.		It’s called Mexico.		Either come here LEGALLY, or stay put.

He’ll never beat Hillary..	He’ll never pass tax reform..	He’ll never bring those jobs back..	He’ll never get 3% growth..	He’ll never move the embassy..	He’ll never meet with North Korea..		Are you starting to see the pattern?		I’m just waiting for “he’ll never win a second term.”
President Trump wants to remove the court process &amp; deport border jumpers as soon as they’re caught.		And I like that.		Living in this country is a privilege, not a right.		Legal tax-paying citizens shouldn’t have to cover the court costs of illegal border jumpers.		#AmericaFirst

Melania’s “I don’t care” jacket was intended for the media.		Especially after Barron was viciously attacked by Peter Fonda &amp; the Left remained silent.		Where are all the celebs, politicians &amp; former First Ladies that supposedly care about children?		The truth is that they don’t.

I've got a great idea.		Why don’t liberals go to the countries these immigrants are leaving &amp; fix them?		Problem solved!
Just made it to AMSOIL Arena in Duluth, MN for President Trump’s rally tonight.		@DeevDirty &amp; I are already camped out in the skywalk, waiting in line with a couple hundred MAGA die-hards ahead of us!		If you’re here, come say hi! 👋🏻🇺🇸
Racism didn’t work.	Sexism didn’t work.	Rigging the election didn’t work.	Russia didn’t work.	Gun control didn’t work.	Stormy Daniels didn’t work.	Nuclear war with NK didn’t work.		So now they’re blaming Trump for a law they had 22 years to change but didn’t?		Yeah. That’ll work!
Fun fact.		The DHS has approximately 12,000 undocumented kids in their shelters.		10,000 of them came across our border as unaccompanied minors, meaning they had NO parents to be separated from.		The Democrat’s sudden outrage over this 22 year old law is completely manufactured.
The Trump administration is treating illegal immigrants &amp; their children the same way Clinton, Bush &amp; Obama did.		The only difference now is the TV telling liberals to get mad.
Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush &amp; Michelle Obama have all expressed their disgust for the border separation policy.		So they're all against a policy that each of their husbands enforced?		Why didn’t they speak up when they were active First Ladies?		They are all two-faced hypocrites.
CANNOT WAIT!!!!!		I will be there 10 hours early with @DeevDirty		Be ready, guys.		I’m going live on Twitter tomorrow! https://t.co/AfqaznHinB
The Dems are trying to blame Obama’s failures on Trump.		Trump is trying to change the laws via Congress, but the Dems won’t work with him.		They don’t care about the kids as long as they have something to yell about, or else they’d do everything they could to fix this situation.
An armed pastor stopped an active shooter in a Walmart parking lot.		If the shooter would’ve killed multiple people, it would be ALL OVER the media.		But once again, they are silent because a good guy with a gun stopped a bad guy with a gun.		And that doesn’t fit their narrative.
The only reason the separation of children from their parents at the border is an issue is because Russia didn’t work, gun control didn’t work, &amp; neither did Stormy Daniels.		The Democrats need something to distract from their high level crimes &amp; this is just the latest craze.
A completely biased &amp; criminal IG Report comes out &amp; exposes the Deep State....		“BUT LOOK! SQUIRREL!”		Out trots the “kids in cages” story to distract voters &amp; push the IG Report off the front pages.

Hillary called President Trump a “liar” &amp; “unchristian” in regards to the family separation policy that she says doesn’t exist.		Does anybody even listen to this lying maniac anymore?		Her husband’s administration is LITERALLY responsible for the law that is still in place today.
Laura Bush says the zero tolerance border policy is “cruel” &amp; “immoral.”		Where was her outrage before this administration?		Her own husband had 8 YEARS to do something about it. Not to mention Obama’s 8 YEARS after that...		Trump has had 500 DAYS.		Fake moral outrage.

Shout out to all the military fathers who weren’t able to see their kids today because they were busy protecting our freedom!		And shame on all the liberals who spent the day complaining about the parental rights of illegal aliens.		#FathersDay
Bill Clinton passed a law in 1996 that separated children from adults illegally entering America.		And liberals cheered.		Obama enforced this same law throughout his entire presidency.		And liberals cheered.		President Trump is now left to “deal with it.”		And liberals are angry.

I think liberals know a thing or two about separating kids from their parents.		They’ve put 50 million dead babies in trash cans.
Bill Clinton says that today he’s thinking about the fathers who are separated from their children when they try to cross our border.		Yeah?		Well today I'm thinking about the children your wife left fatherless in Benghazi.		You know, the actual AMERICAN fathers she left behind.
Liberals are hypocrites.		“We don’t like Trump, therefore he’s guilty without evidence.”		“We love Hillary, therefore she’s innocent with evidence.”		And they wonder why we don’t take them seriously.
“I just want out of the whole nightmare before they end my life.”		- Roseanne’s tweet from 2 days ago before she promptly deleted it.

Bernie Sander’s has refused to endorse his own son’s candidacy for a U.S. House seat in New Hampshire.		Rough.		That would make for some awkward breakfast conversation when his kid comes up from the basement....
Liberal logic.		“Now that WW3 is not an issue, let’s find something else to blame on Trump.		Oh look, here is a picture of illegal kids being held in cages!		I'm outraged &amp; offended!”		(Shares post everywhere before discovering it was from 2014)
What’s the difference between illegals being separated from their kids at the border &amp; American citizens who are sent to jail being separated from THEIR kids?		Seriously.		Break the law &amp; you’ll have your kids taken from you.		Funny we never heard about this during the Obama era.

Fact.		Nancy Pelosi &amp; Maxine Waters are living proof that stupidity is color blind.
The IG Report says that Obama, who claimed he knew nothing about Hillary’s private email server, EXCHANGED EMAILS WITH HER.		It also tells us that Comey had his OWN PRIVATE EMAIL SERVER. No wonder he saw no problem with Hillary’s - he was doing the same damn thing!		LOCK THEM UP.
A nation has the right AND the duty to protect/control its borders. Failure to do so would result in chaos.		You know what Heaven has?		A gate, wall, &amp; extreme vetting process.		Not even Jesus is letting everyone in who doesn’t come the right way.		John 10:1-10
Liberal logic.		Don’t eat at Chic-fil-A because of their “bigoted” Christian beliefs.		But DEMAND a gay wedding cake from a Christian baker.

I don’t understand how illegal immigrants can fly a foreign flag, wear clothing depicting that flag, proclaim allegiance to that country/flag, &amp; then consider it punishment when they are sent back to that country....		Doesn’t make any sense.
Okay liberals, you’re right.		Children should NOT be separated from their parents when they illegally cross the border.		They should be sent BACK with them where they belong!

It’s pretty simple.		If you're a foreign parent &amp; you don't want to be separated from your children while illegally crossing the U.S. border, DON'T ILLEGALLY CROSS THE U.S. BORDER WITH YOUR CHILDREN.		These family separations are clearly the fault of the law-breaking parents.
The IG Report is bullshit.		Comey, Strzok, Page, Lynch, Hillary, Obama &amp; others were caught red-handed meddling in our election.		This isn’t over yet.		But for now, the President of the United States is about to win the Nobel Peace Prize, while Hillary is signing books at Costco.

Liberal logic.		Kids &amp; teens are too young to be tried for a crime, but are old enough to make public policy &amp; change their gender.

Referring to Trump, Bill Clinton said "my mother would’ve whipped me for 5 days in a row when I was little if I spent all my time bad-mouthing people.”		Oh really?		But not for STEALING from Haiti, RAPING women, or LYING under oath?		She should’ve kicked your ass a little harder.
Dear Democrats,		We will NEVER forget January 30, 2018.... when you chose to bring illegal aliens to the State of the Union instead of American veterans.		Signed, We the People.
Crazy Maxine Waters is promising reparations to black people for slavery if she is re-elected in 2018.		Sad.		She’s trying to buy votes by making promises she can’t keep.		Anybody with half a brain cell knows this lady makes millions of dollars by pushing false claims of racism.
Justin Trudeau says that Trump placing tariffs on steel with Canada is “insulting” &amp; “unacceptable.”		Shut up, dummy.		The days of America being ripped off by imbalanced trade deals are OVER.		America does NOT exist to subsidize other countries, especially socialist countries.
Bernie Sanders says Disney “damn well has enough to pay its workers at least 15 bucks an hour.”		This man was unable to hold a job &amp; lived off welfare for the first 40 years of his life.		Now people want to take his advice about finances?
Bill Clinton says impeachment hearings would have begun already if the President were a Democrat.		Impeached for what?		The exploding stock market? Low unemployment rate? End of ISIS? Strong trade deals? Arresting MS-13? Protecting the 2A? Donating his salary? LOWERING our taxes?

Valerie Jarrett says we need to turn Roseanne’s racist comment into a “teaching moment.”		It always amazes me to hear a Democrat lecture the rest of us about civility considering the way they have behaved since the election.
Episode 5 of the E4L Podcast is now available!		This episode was the most fun we’ve had so far &amp; features my brother @chasenwheeler.		Video to this podcast will be available on YouTube within the hour.		Here’s the link to listen to it on iTunes!	https://t.co/yUJItzoOFO
“Roseanne” has been removed from all cable outlets.		Meanwhile, “The Cosby Show” is still being aired.		I guess a rude tweet is worse than premeditated rape.
Samantha Bee’s “Full Frontal” show is down 29% from last year.		It’s also down 34% among adults ages 18-49, which is the demographic most-coveted by primetime advertisers.		So why won’t TBS cancel her show?		Because they don’t care about ratings, they care about their agenda.
David Hogg took a moment on Twitter to offer a sarcastic thank you to the NRA.		Well I’d like to take a moment to offer him a sincere thank you for being an idiot.		Every time this kid opens his big mouth, NRA memberships &amp; gun sales go way up.		Keep it up, champ!
Liberals are in the midst of the longest-running temper tantrum in recorded history....		And it’s been GLORIOUS to watch! 😂
Donald J. Trump is the only President in my lifetime that is actually delivering on campaign promises made to the American people.		He loves this country so much that he gave up his billionaire lifestyle to save our Republic from the destruction of crooked politicians.		#MAGA
Bernie Sanders says Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on Canada will be an “absolute disaster that will cause unnecessary economic pain.”		Seriously?		I wouldn’t let this socialist negotiate a car lease.		Trump is protecting American jobs &amp; companies from unfair foreign competition.
Construction on the San Diego section of the U.S. border wall has begun.		Cost of the entire wall = $15 Billion.		Current yearly cost to support illegal immigrants = $130 Billion.		$130 Billion - $15 Billion.		$115 Billion in annual savings after building wall - that's EACH year.

Hillary says she is “horrified &amp; heartbroken by what is happening to immigrant kids &amp; families because of this administration’s disastrous policies.”		Yet she was Secretary of State when Obama was penning immigrant kids in dog kennels.
If the NRA is so irrelevant, why are so many on the Left continually attacking it? https://t.co/RQoWC54fLc
Starbucks employees from Philadelphia are claiming the “diversity training” made them feel awkward.		Sad how the liberal solution to racism is to constantly be thinking about skin color.		Stop catering to the offended. Let them put their adult pants on &amp; deal with the real world.
Nancy Pelosi says the 223,000 jobs that were added in May “mean little to the families hit with soaring new costs under the Republicans’ watch.”		What a clueless MORON.		This is the same person that wants to eliminate our tax cuts, comparing an extra $2000 to “crumbs.”
Parents of the Parkland students have created an anti-NRA group called The Families Versus Assault Rifle PAC.		Still blaming the NRA for their lack of parenting skills.		They should have spent their time teaching their kids not to bully others &amp; treat people with respect instead.
Gun control “activist” Alyssa Milano tried to bash the NRA by saying the acronym stands for “Not Relevant Anymore.”		She's right.		The NRA is NOT relevant to any shooting, any mass murder, or anything a BAD GUY does with an inanimate object.

Question.		Where are all the angry feminists condemning Samantha Bee for her appalling comment towards Ivanka Trump?		Oh yeah, that's right.		They only get upset when someone they like is attacked.
Denmark is the latest European country to ban full-face veils.		Good for them.		It’s called assimilation into a country, not destroy the country’s culture.		You think that’s unfair?		Try going to a Muslim country in a bikini &amp; see how long you survive.
After facing extreme backlash, Samantha Bee has “apologized” for her “feckless c*nt” comment towards Ivanka Trump.		She’s not sorry.		Her comment was pre-written, recorded, &amp; aired exactly the way she intended it to be.		If Rosanne’s apology didn’t work, then neither should hers.
Kathy Griffin crawled out of her hole today to defend Samantha Bee’s disgusting “feckless c*nt” comment directed towards Ivanka Trump.		Two classless losers calling themselves comedians.		Kathy needs to crawl back into her hole &amp; take Samantha with her.

TBS' Samantha Bee called Ivanka Trump a "feckless c*nt" on her show last night.		So when is she being fired, publicly reprimanded for her abhorrent comments, or having her show cancelled?		Let us know, TBS!
Libs are freaking out because Trump just issued Dinesh D’Souza a full pardon.		Their selective outrage is pathetic.		Not a word when....		-Rosie O’Donnell just broke the same law.		-Obama pardoned traitors like Bradley Manning.		-Comey refused to indict Hillary for her felonies.
Howard Schultz, the Chairman of Starbucks, said Trump was the reason his company had to go through “diversity training.”		Wrong.		You had to "re-educate" your employees because you were too much of a coward to stand up to false claims of racism.		Leadership starts at the top.
Trump just signed the Right-To-Try bill which allows the terminally ill access to experimental medical treatments.		Great things happen when you have a President that rejects lobbyists because he’s already a billionaire.		Sorry Big Pharma, Trump &amp; the American citizens win again!

ABC has just canceled “Roseanne” due to her comments on Twitter that don’t align with their “values.”		This is coming from the same hypocritical network that allows shows like The View &amp; Jimmy Kimmel to spew their hateful rhetoric.		Bad move, ABC.		Your ratings are about to TANK.
David Hogg is thinking about Trump Hotel as the location for his next “die-in.”		Please do.		Trump will call ahead, &amp; have the police on site to arrest every single one of you fools.		This isn't Publix, sparky. And this isn’t the man who will bow to your petulant temper tantrums.
Liberal morons like Shaun King &amp; Linda Sarsour made a story of kids being separated from their illegal parents go viral in an attempt to smear Trump.		Too bad the story was from 2014.		The moral outrage is pathetic, but worse is how it disappeared after finding out Obama did it.
Starbucks is shutting down 8,000 stores today &amp; training their employees to be less “racist.”		I think their training is working!		I can already feel my unconscious bias lifting — telling me that I should be more diverse, &amp; buy coffee at a different establishment!
Those Parkland morons who laid on the floor of Publix, a grocery store in FL, are lucky I wasn’t there.		I would have “accidentally" tripped over one, landed hard on another, claimed an injury, sued Publix for allowing it, &amp; then donated that money to the NRA in Parkland’s name.
Dear liberals,		In 1776, the most powerful country on earth tried to take the guns away from American Colonists. 		That country failed. And so will you if you keep trying to do the same.		Now read this twice so it has a chance at sinking in.

A woman from TX claimed she was sexually assaulted after an officer arrested her for failing a sobriety test.		The story went viral.		The officer then released bodycam footage which proved she was lying.		She needs to be held accountable for slandering &amp; jeopardizing his career.
Maybe if we start referring to “AR-15’s” as “MS-13’s”, Democrats will start protecting them.
Liberals will support &amp; defend violent MS-13 gang members, while at the same time trying to take guns away from law-abiding citizens.		These people are completely anti-American &amp; a disgrace to our wonderful nation.
The Southern Poverty Law Center claims referring to MS-13 as "animals" is "racist" &amp; similar to the way Hitler spoke about Jews.​		The Southern Poverty Law Center is neither southern, about poverty, about law, nor center.		They’ve been an extreme left-wing mouthpiece for years.
Tomi Lahren had a drink poured on her at a restaurant followed by liberals cussing her out.		Why is this not all over the news?		The Starbucks situation was blasted EVERYWHERE &amp; nobody was even mistreated.		If she were a CNN anchor, this would be treated as a national tragedy.
The NFL has passed a policy that prevents players from kneeling during the national anthem.		This gesture is probably too little too late for many football fans.		But it’s still another victory for President Trump, standing up for the flag &amp; standing up to the NFL.		#AmericaFirst
Students at Parkland are threatening to boycott their graduation if Kyle Kashuv is the valedictorian.		What do they mean "if" he's valedictorian? It's not a popularity contest, it’s the person with the highest grades. Period.		If they want to miss their own graduation, let them.
Dear David Hogg &amp; the rest of you empty-headed idiots who are STILL going after the NRA:		The NRA does not buy, manufacture, sell, or give guns away.		They support our Constitution &amp; 2nd Amendment right. That's ALL they do.		But keep pushing, you're making them extremely popular.

A member of MS-13, who literally goes by the nickname “Animal”, just received a 40 year sentence for murdering a 15 year old.		Turns out gang members APPRECIATE derogatory nicknames.		Also, whatever happened to the death penalty? Taxpayers now have to pay for this piece of shit.
Quick disclaimer.		If I ever die in a mass shooting, don’t let gun control liberals use my death as an excuse to take away your guns.		It wasn’t the gun’s fault.
Dear President Trump,		Please shut down the baby-killing factory otherwise known as Planned Parenthood. We should not have to fund murder with our tax dollars.		Perhaps we can redirect the half billion dollars we give to murdering babies to our schools so we can protect our kids.

Why are liberals anti-gun?		Because blaming guns is easier than recognizing their terrible parenting skills have led to a decline in respect, values &amp; morals in our nation’s youth.
Liberals get offended when violent gang members are called “animals”, but have no problem calling the NRA a “terrorist organization.”		Do they even listen to the words coming out of their mouths?		These people are dumber than a box of rocks - no offense to rocks.
To think Donald Trump won the election with all of these well-orchestrated criminal activities going on meant to undermine his candidacy is nothing short of a miracle, &amp; a simple confirmation that God chose him to be President of the United States during a time like this!		#MAGA

Jimmy Kimmel says lawmakers care more about NRA donations than America’s children.		Why didn’t this loser criticize Obama over the school shootings during his 8 years?		Obama had control over the House &amp; Senate for his first 2 years &amp; STILL did nothing.		The hypocrisy is amazing.
Mike Pence - “I bet you can’t make the liberals defend Hamas &amp; MS-13 in the same week.”		President Trump - “Hold my Diet Coke.”
I think it’s funny how the media tried spinning Trump’s comment about MS-13 into an attack on illegal immigrants.		It’s not even a debatable issue.		If you watched the video, have an IQ above room temp, &amp; just a smidgen of integrity, you know damn well he was talking about MS-13.
Question for parents.		If you had a choice between two schools; one with a "gun free zone" sign &amp; the other with an "armed security &amp; 24-hour surveillance" sign, which one would you feel safer sending your child(ren) to?		Liberals struggle on this one....
So let me get this straight.		Democrats are placing all of their chips on a desperate porn star, gun-grabbing child actors, &amp; MS-13 gang members?		Keep it up!		You are making this very easy for Conservatives come November.

Obama's plan to build a 12-story museum &amp; library dedicated to his presidency has been approved.		So let me ask....		As Trump repeals every unconstitutional policy that Obama passed, will we remove items from the museum until it’s just an empty room with a MAGA hat on a pedestal?
Planned Parenthood spoke out against President Trump &amp; acknowledged MS-13 members as human beings that have inherent dignity &amp; deserve respect.		That’s rich.		A statement like this coming from an organization that murders babies for a living. Their opinion means nothing.
I’m daring anybody that thinks MS-13 is not made up of inhumane animals to invite these kind people into their homes.		Prove to President Trump just how wrong he is!
You might be a liberal if you find yourself sticking up for MS-13 members, but not 20 week old fetuses.

A new report says that President Trump may soon be fulfilling another campaign promise.... this time by cutting ALL funding to Planned Parenthood!		I pray to God this is true &amp; that Trump can make it happen. 🙏🏻		Planned Parenthood should NOT be funded by taxpayer dollars!!!!!
President Trump stopped his speech yesterday to recognize the 90 year old mother of a slain NYPD officer.		He gave her a long embrace &amp; continued holding her hand throughout his speech.		Trump has shown us MANY instances of compassion like this, but liberals choose not to see it. https://t.co/DGrPZZKnfS
So let me get this straight.		Liberals will claim Russian collusion over Trump Jr. meeting with a lawyer to get dirt on Hillary... but they will completely ignore the FACT that Hillary financed a fake dossier to frame Trump &amp; undermine our election?		These people need to wake up.

Seattle has decided to raise taxes on its city's businesses in order to pay for "homeless services."		Companies will now have to pay an extra $250 per employee EACH year.		Spending money unwisely &amp; then taxing your city into poverty to pay for your stupidity - good job, Seattle!

Schumer applauded Trump for moving our embassy to Jerusalem &amp; Pelosi wished our First Lady a speedy recover.		They remind me of a rude waiter/waitress who suddenly becomes nice when they bring out the bill &amp; hope for a tip.		They are just trying to save some face before midterms.
People of color are being exposed every other day now for making false claims of racial harassment by officers wearing bodycams.		I think it’s hilarious.		Groups like the NAACP &amp; BLM were screaming for bodycams &amp; now all of a sudden they are petitioning to get rid of them.

It actually pisses me off.		People are literally having their heads sawed off while still alive &amp; liberal pansies like Whoopi Goldberg are concerned we are being too “mean” to terrorists by pouring water on their faces.		These people need a serious reality check.
A black man was threatened by employees at a Cheesecake Factory in Miami for wearing a MAGA hat.		So when will the Cheesecake Factory close all of their restaurants to provide sensitivity training?		Oh wait, this customer was conservative. This kind of bullying is to be expected.
11 different Presidents had their chance to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel since President Truman recognized them as an independent state in 1948.		But it took a man of his word &amp; great character like Donald Trump to finally make it happen!
Thoughts &amp; prayers for our First Lady who had a surgical procedure on her kidney today at Walter Reed.		Get well soon Melania, we love you!
Sarah Sanders said that dealing with her own children has prepared her for dealing with CNN’s professional crybaby, Jim Acosta.		Haha, I love this woman!		The difference between Sarah’s kids &amp; Jim Acosta, is that her kids will eventually outgrow their whining.
Fun fact.		Not a single Democrat attended the ceremony in Jerusalem to declare the city the capital of Israel.		ZERO...		With each passing event, the Left reveals their true political identity as bigoted socialists.		The faster they perish, the faster we can restore our Republic.
An Iranian group has offered $100,000 to anyone who blows up the new American embassy in Jerusalem.		Cheapskates....		We all know Obama gave you terrorists MUCH more than that.

If your kid is bullying my kid, &amp; my kid has tried to tell your kid to stop, &amp; your kid doesn’t.... My kid has been given my permission to punch your kid square in the mouth. 		And I’m not even close to sorry for it.
Whoopi Goldberg says that waterboarding is mean &amp; that President Trump should try it himself.		Or he could just force himself to watch an episode of "The View.”		That would be pretty similar.
Does anybody remember that time when Barack Obama made fun of Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner 7 years ago &amp; how everyone, especially the Democrats, laughed at him hysterically but then Trump became our President &amp; erased Obama’s “legacy?”		That was awesome.

Jimmy Kimmel is finally recognizing that people are getting sick of the Trump-bashing (probably because of his piss-poor ratings), &amp; said that he “might” try scaling it back. 		Way too little, far too late.		All of the late-night talk shows have become dead to me.
Hillary Clinton claimed that our country is “uneasy” about women seeking power.		Using the word “power” instead of “leadership” is very telling.		True leaders don’t crave power.
An MSNBC analyst said he would “slit his throat” if he had to sit through a Sarah Sanders’ press briefing.		I had no idea there were so many unhinged, hateful, losers out there until this election.		Their true colors are showing.

What is the difference between Russian interference &amp; allowing illegal aliens to vote in our election?		One of them actually happened &amp; is illegal. 		The other is a “witch hunt” created to distract people from the crimes of the previous administration.
7 people were shot &amp; killed in Australia on Friday.		But wait, I thought that was impossible! Guns are illegal in Australia!		So you’re telling me that criminals don’t follow the law????
MSNBC Host, Nicolle Wallace, asked how people are able to resist the temptation to run up to Sarah Sanders &amp; “wring her neck.”		So wanting to cause somebody bodily harm is ok, but criticizing John McCain for his behavior is off limits?		Typical libs &amp; their double standards.
Obama's mission was to destroy the United States.		President Trump’s mission is to save our Republic &amp; restore it back to greatness.		TRUMP 2020. 🇺🇸🙌🏻
NBC News analyst, John Heilemann, said he’d rather kill himself than attend a Sarah Sanders press briefing.		Libs hate her bcuz she's a strong woman who doesn't resort to nasty language to be powerful. It’s confounding to them bcuz they lack the self-control to do it themselves.
Maxine Waters says that as a black person, the Make America Great Again slogan “offends” her.		Seriously?...		Has this moody race pimp done ANYTHING during her time in office other than make millions of dollars?		I just can’t believe that people actually vote for her, repeatedly.
Whoopi Goldberg says that waterboarding terrorists is unfair &amp; that Trump should try it himself.		Great idea!		He can try it on Comey, Obama, Hillary, Holder, &amp; many other members of the Swamp.		We would have enough paying spectators to wipe out the debt left behind by Barack.

Susan Rice attacked President Trump for leaving the Iran nuclear deal, claiming that he is our “Wrecking Ball in Chief.”		Lmao, I agree!		Our Wrecking Ball in Chief is doing a wonderful job of tearing down Obama's “legacy.”		Keep it swinging.
Iran's Quds forces have started launching rockets at Israel from Syria.		Looks like they are spending those Obama bucks.		Less than a day after President Trump ended the deal, Iran has chanted “death to America”, burned our flag, &amp; attacked our allies.		I hope Israel levels them.
The Iranians are shouting “death to America” &amp; burning our nation’s flag on their television stations.		As if we needed further proof that President Trump leaving the nuclear deal was the right thing to do.

So glad that Trump fulfilled another campaign promise &amp; pulled out of the TERRIBLE Iran deal.		Take note, John Kerry.		WE DON’T NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS!!!!!!
Obama just condemned President Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal.		Of course he did. 		He’s just mad that he can't fund &amp; arm his Muslim friends anymore!
Sources say an Iranian military base in Syria was attacked by an Israeli airstrike about an hour after Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal.		Iran is taking more losses today than Hillary Clinton in 2016.
BREAKING NEWS.		President Trump has decided to pull out of the Iran deal.		It’s almost as if everything Obama “accomplished” over the last eight years, aside from the racial division &amp; terrible healthcare, has been negated.		Thank you, @realDonaldTrump!
Melania announced her anti-bullying campaign &amp; liberals did nothing but mock her looks &amp; accent.		The Left has officially adopted hate, anger &amp; disrespect as their platform.		Maybe if they replaced some of that jealousy with hard work, their lives would be more significant.
I’m hoping Trump leaves this Iran “deal” faster than he left Hillary supporters in tears at the election.		He will be announcing his decision in about 2 hours. (2 p.m. ET)

John McCain says he doesn’t want President Trump to attend his funeral.		Ummm.... Is that suppose to hurt Trump’s feelings? If anything, he’s probably happy to hear it.		He has MANY other more important things to do such as Draining the Swamp that McCain helped create.
The city of Seattle wants to impose a tax on businesses to help remove the homeless people off their streets.		Yeah.... Because it’s obviously the businesses’ fault that there are so many homeless people in the city, as opposed to the moronic liberal officials in charge.
I love our President.		Never has anyone worked so hard for a job they did not need. He’s dedicating &amp; risking his own life to clean up Obama’s mess &amp; put America First again.		Without him, most people never would’ve known how corrupt our government was.		God Bless you, Mr. Trump!
Michael Moore made a tweet praising Karl Marx on his 200th birthday comparing him to Jesus.		Listen up, jackass - over 100 million ppl have died since then as a DIRECT result of communism.		You need to do some serious reflection. Fat, drunk &amp; stupid is no way to go through life.
According to a Reuters poll on presidential approval, the black male support for Trump has DOUBLED over the past week from 11% to 22%.		I’d like to thank Kanye for battling the liberal bullies &amp; being a voice for those who are too afraid to speak up.		You are making a difference!
You don't have to be white to be a conservative.		You just have to be able to think for yourself.
Libs are trying to tell Trump supporters they can’t celebrate Cinco de Mayo since they are in favor of building a border wall.		Do they not realize that it’s possible to love both Mexicans &amp; their culture while at the same time wanting our laws enforced?		It’s not a hard concept.
Snoop Dogg told Kanye West that he’s gone “all-white now.”		Is that not racist?		Just imagine if I criticized @TyEducatingLibs by saying he’s gone “all-black now” in the same derogatory manner...		Libs would freak out, label me a racist, &amp; try to get my Twitter account shut down.
A radio station in Detroit has banned all music by Kanye West.		This only proves what Kanye has been saying all along - that leftists are a bunch of censorship bullies who can't accept different positions other than their own.
A homeless man was recently arrested for breaking into Jerry Brown’s home.		The homeless man claimed he selected Brown’s home because Brown was "an open-door policy kind of guy."		Well here’s your chance, Jerry. Put your money where your mouth is. Give him a place to eat &amp; sleep.

President Trump has officially been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.		Interviewer: “How do feel about possibly winning the Nobel Peace Prize?”		President Trump: “Peace IS the prize!” 		Great response!
Trump honored the Teacher of the Year today who refused to clap for him or shake his hand.		How classless....		This is the best teacher our nation has to offer? Those poor kids.		She is the perfect example of why our schools are failing by brainwashing our kids to be liberal.
The Illinois Senate just passed a bill that will now require LGBT history in public schools.		So we won't allow the Bible, but we will allow favoritism due to SEXUAL PREFERENCE?		That’s sad...		Public schools are no longer a place for kids to learn but rather to be indoctrinated.
Jamie Foxx is the latest to say Kanye West needs some mental help.		Really?		I don’t think the people who had the biggest meltdown in history because of an election loss should be giving out mental health advice.		Just saying.
MSNBC has run at least two segments this week that speculated about President Trump's sex life, suggesting that he has an STD &amp; suffers from "sexual dysfunction.”		Meanwhile in the real world, Korean leaders agree to peace &amp; an end to war... But none of that is important I guess.
All of the liberals complaining about that white girl wearing a Chinese dress to prom will probably be the first idiots wearing a sombrero on Cinco de Mayo.

I think of President Trump as a really strong antibiotic for a very sick world.		The constant media slander &amp; liberal insanity are a few of the side effects, but in the end he's going to make the world a far better place... he already is.		Keep up the great work, DJT!		#MAGA 🇺🇸
I have a serious question.		How do you piss off a feminist?		Whoops... too late.
Over a dozen lawmakers have already nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.		If he does win the award, I hope he donates the $1,000,000 prize money to the NRA. 		A nice big F-U to the leftists. 😄
North Korea is "demonstrating their sincerity" before the scheduled meeting between President Trump &amp; Kim Jong-un by releasing 3 American detainees.		How come Obama never got anyone released? Oh yeah, he did.		5 Taliban commanders from Gitmo, as well as traitor Bradley Manning.
Kanye is absolutely correct.		Most black people are more offended by him wearing a MAGA hat than they are by the black kids being murdered in Chicago.		It’s pretty sad.
I’m curious.		Who do you guys like better?		Vote &amp; RT.
Libs are relentlessly attacking a white high school girl for wearing a Chinese dress to prom, claiming that it’s “cultural appropriation.”		If she was transgendered &amp; wore the same exact dress, they would’ve been praising her for her strength &amp; courage.		Such pathetic hypocrites.
The Boy Scouts are now accepting girls into their organization &amp; changing their name to Scouts BSA.		So, are the Girl Scouts going to accept boys now?		This whole politically correct bullshit has gone way too far.

Maxine Waters wants Kanye West to stop speaking up.		Of course she does.		Free speech as long as you say what I want you to say. Tolerance as long as you believe what I do. Open minded as long as you think like us.		The liberal hypocrisy knows no bounds.
Twitter just took away ANOTHER 300 of my followers in the last 10 minutes.		And more than 50 people have already told me today that they weren’t following me anymore, even though they never clicked unfollow.		What the hell is going on, @Twitter?		Get your shit together.
Liberals have been attacking Matt Groening, creator of The Simpson’s, for perpetuating the “stereotype” of Indians with his character Apu.		He told them to kiss his ass.		Apu is a successful business owner, family man &amp; legal immigrant.		Seems like a pretty good stereotype to me.
When Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize, it instantly became a participation trophy.		So it really doesn’t matter whether President Trump receives it or not.		As he stated earlier, “peace IS the prize.”

Trump could cure cancer &amp; liberals would riot in the streets with tears streaming down their faces claiming that he didn’t focus more on heart disease.		But it doesn’t matter....		He lets them cry like spoiled brats while he keeps on making our country great again for EVERYONE.

Dear Obama,		We would like to Make the Nobel Peace Prize Great Again.		Please return yours so we can give it to someone who actually earned it.
The Nobel Peace Prize lost its prestige when they gave it to Obama for being half-black &amp; setting race relations in America back 50 years.
Stormy Daniels is back to making porn videos.		Hate President Trump all you want, but you can’t deny he is good at putting people back to work.
The University of Texas will now treat masculinity as a “mental health issue”, &amp; is urging male students to “take more control over their gender identity.”		So you're telling me that masculinity is considered a MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE but men who think they are women is not?		Unreal.

Wasn't it the Left that said “when they go low, we go high?”		Hmm. Interesting.		Sarah Sanders has more class in her pinky finger than every liberal put together at that Correspondents’ Dinner.
Young kids are killing themselves every day bcuz of intense bullying. 		And that’s bcuz our youth pays attention to the way liberal adults treat other people, such as the Correspondents’ Dinner the other night.... they see that kind of behavior &amp; then believe it's OK to bully.
Kanye West called Emma Gonzalez his “hero.”		That’s sad... because he was actually starting to make sense for a minute.		Why would Emma be his hero? She bullied a kid until he lost his mind, killed 17 people, &amp; then blamed it all on the NRA.		What part of that is heroic?
President Obama’s biggest “breakthrough” was letting men into the women’s restroom.		One of President Trump’s biggest breakthroughs so far is negotiating peace between North &amp; South Korea, ending a 65 year war.

I voted for Trump bcuz he wanted to represent ALL Americans, not just a select group.		But the fake news media constantly paints a negative picture of him &amp; liberals eat it up faster than a Sunday breakfast.		Stop hating &amp; start paying attention.		Actions speak louder than words.

Hey liberals,		The purpose of our 2nd Amendment is to ensure we NEVER have a government that tells us when, where &amp; how our children must die.		Rest In Peace, Alfie Evans.

Trump has literally done more in ONE WEEK to warrant a Nobel Peace Prize than Obama did in eight years.
A teacher at Parkland compared pro-2nd Amendment student Kyle Kashuv to "Hitler" &amp; called him "dangerous."		So it’s OK to bash the NRA &amp; gun owners, but not OK to stand up for your constitutional right?		Knock it off....		Can you imagine the OUTRAGE if he had said that to Hogg?
John Legend told Kanye “so many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of color.”		Why do liberals never specify WHICH policies cause harm to people of color? 🤔		 I’d really like to know.
Fact.		President Trump has done more to help the black community in the last year or so than all of the politicians &amp; celebrities in the last three decades combined.
Donald Trump has always been a straight shooter. https://t.co/an0AD8uF44
- No Russia/Trump collusion	- N. Korea &amp; S. Korea signed peace treated		President Trump will go down as one of the best Presidents this country has ever seen, yet the mainstream media will write articles like “Trump didn’t buy his wife a gift.”		It’s seriously pathetic.
So let me get this straight.		Liberals CHEERED when Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize immediately after being elected, before he could “accomplish” anything. 		But now they want to RIDICULE Trump for achieving something that no other President before him could?		Get real.
President Trump actually DESERVES the Nobel Peace Prize for ending the Korean War, unlike Obama who was awarded it for no reason!
If you think liberal heads are exploding now, just wait until President Trump is re-elected in 2020.
Liberals are relentlessly attacking Kanye.		This is what happens when you think for yourself &amp; don't subscribe to their mind control.		It doesn't matter what color you are or how much money you have, they will attack you with everything they can to shut you up....		Go Kanye!!!!
Republicans attack policy.		Democrats attack people.		Vote red in November.

Funny how the Left says Trump had nothing to do with ending the Korean War even though the South Korean President said if it weren't for Trump’s strong leadership, it wouldn’t have happened.		If Obama had done this, they’d be calling him the best thing to ever happen to humanity.
Donald Trump is Making the World Great Again.
President Trump is accomplishing something our last 11 Presidents could not - putting an end to the 65 year Korean War.		This man is literally achieving World Peace.		#Legendary
The double standard shown by liberals is seriously pathetic.		A few months ago they PRAISED Eminem when he told every Trump supporter to go f*ck themselves.		Now they are calling Kanye West an Uncle Tom &amp; mentally ill for saying he supports our President.

It really exposes the draconian behavior exhibited by the Left whenever somebody disagrees with the rest of the hive.		They are TERRIFIED of free thought &amp; free speech.		They need total control over the fake narrative they have created so they can stay in power over their voters.

Bernie says he has a plan to guarantee everyone a job &amp; at least $15 per hour.		His office then goes on to say they don’t know how to implement the plan bcuz they “haven't determined a cost estimate or source of funding."		In other words, Bernie is talking out of his ass again.

The NRA broke a 15-year fundraising record in March with a total of $2.4 million - most of it coming from small donations.		This is how conservatives live.		We don’t let spoiled teenage brats tell us what to do. We back the Constitution &amp; put our money where are mouths are.

Emma Gonzalez now wants to confiscate ALL semi-automatic guns.		If she hates the 2nd Amendment so much, then why doesn’t she move to a country that doesn't guarantee that right to its people?		Someone find her a piece of styrofoam so she can float back to Cuba.
California was already crazy, but they have gone absolutely batshit insane since Trump won the election.		And I really think they are just a microcosm of what the entire country would have eventually looked like if Hillary had won.
Oh wait, Bernie already has this job!
Bernie Sanders says he has a plan that would guarantee every American a job.		Nice!		I need one that pays $750 an hour, 12 hours a week, 8 weeks of paid vacation, full health care &amp; a pension of $5500 a month after 5 years of service.		Thanks Bernie!		Rainbows &amp; unicorns for all.
Kyle Kashuv was questioned in school yesterday by law enforcement for posting pictures of him &amp; his dad at a gun range.		People are pretty upset over it.		I'm just surprised that a Coward County Sheriff Deputy could find his way into the school.

@melthesender https://t.co/j0LsAjIvx9 - thanks!

Hey guys,		For the FIRST TIME EVER @TyEducatingLibs &amp; I are going to go live together on Periscope.		15 minutes!
Apparently there is another School Walkout Day scheduled for tomorrow.		I have a hell of a lot more respect for the kids who choose to stay in class &amp; learn the importance of our 2nd Amendment.		Don’t let your brainwashed teachers &amp; classmates push you into liberal conformity.

Me watching Starbucks’ liberal customers boycott liberal Starbucks. https://t.co/IPlJcVC40M
Can’t wait to see how Starbucks operates after their “diversity” training.		“I see that you’re not a white person. Feel free to loiter with friends, use our bathroom &amp; leech off the WiFi. No purchase necessary.”
I don't know what's worse - the fact that they escorted @LauraLoomer out for asking questions, or the group of people who showed up to support him. https://t.co/BenJkj9ClJ
Who do you think will go away first?
America.		A country so damn great that even its haters won’t leave.
@jackdwagner Oh nice.		They carry it in your size &amp; gender.
The police didn’t have to arrest them JUST BECAUSE STARBUCKS called them.		They arrested them because they disobeyed a lawful order to leave.  That made it criminal trespassing.		The arresting officer was black as well, but of course, liberals choose racism as their first answer.
In an article for In Touch Weekly, Anna Quintana praised Stormy Daniels &amp; called her a “hero” after she pledged to donate $130,000 to Planned Parenthood.		A porn star is a hero for supporting baby killers.... That pretty much sums up the “progressive” culture, doesn’t it?
@Brandon1776 Soro’s will make sure his boys buy enough copies to push it onto the best seller’s list.		A month later it will be found on the discount rack for $1.99.
David Hogg is set to release a book in June.		Okay, so the kid who can hardly formulate a sentence without a spelling mistake &amp; couldn’t get into college thinks he has the skills to write a novel?		Unless this is a children’s coloring book, I’m not believing that for one second.
Save your breath, @jackdwagner.		You’ll probably need it to blow up your next date. https://t.co/kvu0Q3CP8L
Shout out to my girl @LauraLoomer for sticking it to James Comey today during his book tour.		That was awesome. 😂
Breaking news.		Trump paid off the other sperm to reach his mom's egg first.		Mueller investigating....
@coolguyluke4 @TyEducatingLibs We are! This week I think. Lol
We are adding 3 more products to our site in about 2 weeks.		For now we still have some of these wristbands for sale. Buy in a bundle deal &amp; share some with your friends!		@TyEducatingLibs &amp; I are using the proceeds to get our book published.		https://t.co/xcIAy50t9i
I wish the FBI was half as good at stopping mass shooters as they are at protecting Hillary &amp; Obama.
Dick’s is DESTROYING the guns they are no longer selling.		9% drop in stock price &amp; counting while the stocks of the companies whose guns they are destroying are up about 10%.		Not to mention NRA memberships have increased 4900% &amp; donations are up 400%.		These idiots never learn.
London’s murder rate is now higher than New York City’s despite banning guns.		Their new solution?		Increase knife control &amp; march against knives.		Liberal stupidity never fails to amaze me.
Dr. Jordan Peterson will go down as one of the great minds of our time.		Can’t get enough of him lately.
-When every gun is banned.	-When every word is censored.	-When every book is burned.	-When every dissenter goes to jail.	-When all of our history is erased &amp; all of our freedoms have been taken.		Only then will liberals understand why our 2nd Amendment was so important.
If liberals ever got their way &amp; banned “assault weapons”, we would just call them “undocumented firearms” &amp; let them live in our sanctuary homes.
The Constitution is a lot like the Bible in that you have a lot of liberals who have obviously never read it, but still try to tell you what it says.
I find it fascinating how liberals aren’t against armed guards at banks to protect our money, yet so many of them are against armed guards at schools to protect our kids.
More ratings equals more money from their advertisers.		Manufacturing stories of racism sells like hot cakes.
If the two people that got kicked out of Starbucks for loitering happened to be white, the media would have never covered the story. 		It wouldn’t have pulled enough ratings.
I love it when liberals try to act tough.		These are the same people that needed padded cells, warm milk, &amp; safety pins after they lost an election.
John McCain recently had surgery for an intestinal infection.		We now have scientific proof that he is literally full of shit.
Planned Parenthood is dishing out $30 million on the midterm elections.		If they have that kind of spare cash, why the hell are we the taxpayers subsidizing them?		Taking federal funding &amp; using it towards funding elections should be highly illegal.
I have no problem with Starbucks telling ppl who aren’t customers to leave.		The business has to make a profit to stay open. I don't understand the ppl who think it’s wrong to toss out the moochers who are only loitering for the free WiFi.		It's a business, not a public library.
Without racism, Democrats have nothing. They MUST keep it alive.		If you make billions of dollars a year running a cancer research center, the last thing you want to do is find a cure for cancer.		Racism will end when the Democrat Party ceases to benefit from it.
I’m actually excited to hear what David Hogg is going to boycott on Friday.		You already know that some person or organization is going to benefit from its beautiful backfire.		The only thing this kid has successfully boycotted is arm day in the gym.
Fun fact.		The 2nd Amendment still does more to make women equal than the entire 3rd wave feminist movement.
Donald Trump has absolutely no obligation to disclose his tax returns. Just like you &amp; I, his tax returns are nobody's business except for the IRS. And what happened when Rachel Maddow snooped around &amp; found his tax returns?		Oh yeah, he paid more taxes than Bernie &amp; Hillary.
The media will do anything they possibly can to keep liberals mindlessly distracted from the fact that Comey, Hillary &amp; Obama colluded to rig the election.		Now they are trying to make a big deal out of Hannity talking to Cohen.		Since when is it a crime to TALK to an attorney?
David Hogg speaks out against the NRA &amp; they get a 20% increase in membership. 		He organizes a boycott on Laura Ingraham &amp; she gets a million more viewers.		If only I could get him to protest against my bank account.
Kids who eat Tide pods &amp; snort condoms isn’t just the result of bad parenting, even though that’s a big part of it.		It’s also bcuz kids these days have no concept of self-respect. Everything they do is geared towards getting attention &amp; being noticed, even if it's for stupidity.

Stormy Daniels should consider herself lucky. 		If she had been one of Bill Clinton's bimbos, she may have already been found dead with a gunshot to the back of the head that was ruled as a suicide.
David Hogg is set to announce another boycott.		Too bad his boycotts are the best advertisement you can get.		Calls for NRA partners to pull out, NRA memberships skyrocket.		Calls for a boycott of Ingraham advertisers, her ratings go UP &amp; advertisers crawl back saying "our bad.”
Some high schools are starting to use updated history books that question Trump’s sanity &amp; label his supporters as angry white people.		History books are supposed to give FACTS, not opinions.		This book, author &amp; any school that uses it should be sued.
Joe Biden hasn’t ruled out a 2020 run for the presidency.		And I have to admit, I’m hoping he does. I cannot see Trump doing anything but obliterating this pervert.		It would be fun to watch.
Liberals are having heart attacks over the fact that Sean Hannity asked Michael Cohen for legal advice.		They are acting as if this is against the law or some kind of major scandal.		From collusion to hookers to now attorneys giving legal advice. This investigation is a JOKE.
@VillaMarlin @Donnam8470Donna @TyEducatingLibs Thanks, Steve! 🇺🇸💪🏼

James Comey did not cost Hillary the election.		Her being an awful person did.
Biden recently said “Republicans don’t want black folks voting.”		Really?		We are the ones who fought for their right to vote in the first place. You Democrats stood in their way for 200 years so that you could keep standing on their backs, which is exactly what you’re doing now.
A lawsuit has been filed against the Federal Election Commission claiming that Hillary &amp; the DNC laundered 84 million through state parties to avoid campaign finance laws.		So when should we expect her lawyers to have their offices raided by law enforcement?

More California cities are starting to join the fight against their state’s pro-illegal immigrant policies.		Well, it’s about time.		I’m getting sick of watching them turn into a 3rd world shithole.
Charlie Kirk said “the greatest threat to Western civilization is what’s going on on our college campuses today.”		And he’s absolutely correct.		Most colleges are becoming political platforms used for liberal indoctrination versus being places of learning.
James Comey said Trump “lies constantly” &amp; is “morally unfit to be President.”		This coming from the person that lied under oath, leaked classified info to the press, &amp; politicized the FBI for a certain candidate.		Projection much?
Comey claims that Trump “lies constantly.”		Really?....		That's an interesting statement coming from a proven liar. But hey, that’s the way liberals roll - claiming other people are doing the exact things they are doing.
I can’t believe the Obama administration would lie about removing 100% of the chemical weapons from Syria....		They were so transparent about everything!!!!!
Rest In Peace, R. Lee Ermey		We are losing a generation of REAL MEN &amp; being left with a follow-up generation that has no respect, morals, or patriotism.		YOU WILL BE TRULY MISSED, GUNNY. 		#SemperFi
Liberals last week - “The poor Syrian children! Why doesn’t Trump do anything?”		Liberals this week - “Trump bombed Syria! He’s going to start WWIII!”

James Comey admits in his new book that he regrets calling Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information "extremely careless."		He should have said “she is a criminal &amp; we will be prosecuting her to the fullest extent of the law.”		Too bad he’s a spineless coward.
It makes me extremely grateful when I think about everything Trump gave up in order to run for President with no pay, just for the love of his country &amp; wanting to see a better place for his kids, grandkids &amp; the rest of his fellow Americans.		Thank you, Donald Trump!
CNN’s Ana Navarro tweeted that the missile strike in Syria was intended to take attention away from President Trump’s scandals.		Really?...		You mean like Mueller’s investigation of Trump designed to distract attention from Hillary, Obama, Soros, Comey, McCabe, Lynch, Rice, etc?
Alright guys, the demand for our “TRUMP 2020 / KEEP AMERICA GREAT!” wristbands has been crazy!		We are down to 500 left &amp; won’t have a new shipment in for 12 more days.		Here is the link!!!! All proceeds go toward the publication of our first book.		https://t.co/xcIAy4IRKI

Kerry &amp; Obama said the chemical weapons were completely gone from Syria.		They lied.		This is just another mess that President Trump had to clean up.
If Trump draws a red line, you better not cross it.		He doesn’t play games like the last clown we had in office.
Trump bombed Syria’s chemical weapons plants, showing the world that the use of chemical weapons will be met with deadly force.		People really need to stop listening to the mainstream media....		Attacking military infrastructure isn’t the same thing as attacking civilians.
All joking Assad...		Things are getting pretty Syrias!
How can liberals support Obama when he dropped over 12,000 bombs on Syria &amp; then turn around &amp; bash Trump for launching an air strike?		Because you can't be a liberal without being a raging hypocrite.

Trump is only polarizing because of his blunt honesty. He says what he means &amp; does what he says he’s going to do.		He’s kicking ass for America while at the same time exposing the crooks on the Left as the swamp rats we all knew they were.		And liberals can’t stand that.

Antifa has chosen a raccoon as their official mascot because they both wear masks, knock over trash cans, &amp; get hit by cars.
If Diamond &amp; Silk are considered “dangerous”, then why are there so many Antifa profiles on Facebook?		A group that openly commits acts of violence &amp; hides the identities of its members.

Kaepernick was uninvited to the Seahawks’ camp after saying he wouldn’t stop kneeling for the anthem.		He has the freedom to kneel if he chooses, but the NFL teams also have the same freedom to not hire him. Life is about choices &amp; choices come with consequences.		Dumb move, pal.
A new survey says that 2 out of 3 millennials don’t know what Auschwitz was.		That's bcuz schools are more interested in indoctrinating students instead of actually teaching them.		The sad part is that most of these same ppl could tell you exactly what the Kardashians are up to.

The FBI knew about the Pulse Nightclub shooter that killed 49 ppl &amp; refused to act.		They knew about the Parkland shooter that killed 17 ppl &amp; refused to act.		Now they are acting on flakey information about a porn star?		You cannot tell me the FBI isn’t politically motivated.

Quick lesson for liberals.		The fact that our government would even consider repealing the 2nd Amendment is the very reason that our Founding Fathers wrote it in the first place.
Liberal logic.		Drug overdose - blames the addict.		Fatal DWI - blames the drunk.		Bank robbery - blames the robber. 		Mass shooting - blames all gun owners &amp; the NRA.
In less than 24 hours, the YouTube shooting is no longer trending.		Gee.... how many of us guessed that would happen?		It’s almost as if it doesn’t fit the Left’s gun control narrative....
Hillary says the Parkland students have a “real shot” at defeating the NRA.		She also thought she had a “real shot” at defeating President Trump.		The only thing they have a “real shot” at is creating even more NRA memberships.
President Trump has just decided to send the National Guard to our southern border immediately.		And liberals are upset about it....		Why would anybody living LEGALLY in the United States be upset about him protecting our borders from ILLEGALS entering? Frickin idiots.
A female-liberal-Muslim-vegan-nutjob shoots 3 people &amp; then herself with a gun that was legally registered in a state with some of the strictest gun control laws &amp; liberals are STILL blaming the NRA????		You really can’t fix stupid.
The shooting yesterday was an unfortunate event.		But the big question is did David Hogg survive it? Because we all know he was there.
Shout out to Martin Luther King Jr., a man I have MASSIVE respect for, who was assassinated on this day 50 years ago.		This fearless leader fought endlessly in the face of death each &amp; every day in order to see equal rights achieved in America.		His legacy needs to be remembered.
@lIllIlbinary Super male vitality.

Liberals have been pretty quiet about yesterday’s shooting.		Maybe because it was done by a MUSLIM, VEGAN, FEMALE who shot people in a “GUN-FREE ZONE” with a HANDGUN in a state with STRICT GUN CONTROL.		That makes it pretty darn tough to blame straight white males or the NRA.....
Police say their investigation into the shooting at the YouTube headquarters has been hampered by having to sit through a 5 second ad before interviewing each witness.
Yesterday’s shooting. 		White? No.	Male? No. 	Christian? No. 	Conservative? No. 	NRA member? No. 	Assault rifle? No.		Move along. Nothing to see here.
Yesterday’s shooting was a simple misunderstanding. 		Had someone sat the woman down &amp; explained to her that guns aren't allowed in YouTube’s facility, this never would've happened. 🙄
There was a shooting today at YouTube’s headquarters.		I heard David Hogg is on his bike right now heading there with his camera ready.
Liberals say conservatives are heartless &amp; don’t care about the YouTube shooting that happened today.		Actually, we do.		We are just pointing out the irony of it happening after they banned gun videos &amp; work in a gun-free building. We want them to protect themselves... with GUNS!

When I was young, my parents let me know I had no rights. I owned nothing. It was their house, their stuff, their rules. I had privileges that could be taken away at any time.		And that method worked well. My siblings &amp; I grew up to be respectful, productive, responsible adults.
I will no longer be buying or using any products made by companies that turned on Laura Ingraham.		Big mistake letting a whiny teenager dictate your business policies.
Does anyone else find it weird that this Emma chick &amp; David Hogg were ever in a position to bully anyone? 		I’m not even that old, but in my days those two little shits would have been on the receiving end for sure.
Jim Acosta kept yelling at President Trump about DACA while he was coloring with children at a table during the annual Easter Egg Roll.		How disrespectful can you be?		He continues to throw his immature temper tantrums. Meanwhile, the CHILDREN were better behaved than that idiot.
David Hogg has stolen the voices of those who were the REAL victims of this shooting - kids who were ACTUALLY shot and/or killed. The media hijacked this tragedy to promote their own political agenda. And the liberals bought it hook, line &amp; sinker.		Bravo, George Soros.
Merriam-Webster just changed their definition of “assault rifle” to “a rifle that resembles a military assault rifle but is designed to allow only semiautomatic fire.”		So it's an assault rifle if it LOOKS like an assault rifle, even if it DOESN’T function as an assault rifle? 🤔
Laura Ingraham did what most conservatives do &amp; backed down at the slightest sign of confrontation. And this is why we're losing the culture war.		The left will shout their unfounded &amp; slanderous claims about us regardless of the facts, so there's no point in apologizing to them.

New evidence shows that the Pulse nightclub shooter actually had plans to shoot up Disney World, but changed his mind when he saw how many armed guards there were &amp; decided to find a gun free zone instead.		These are the kind of facts that the fake news media won't report.
Liberals shouldn’t be surprised that we are laughing at them when the voice of their political party consists of a hooker &amp; an ignorant punk.
Like or RT if you think teachers who try to indoctrinate children with political beliefs should be terminated from their jobs.

I think it’s funny how when the Left boycotts a company, it backfires &amp; sales go up. (Chic-fil-A &amp; NRA)		And when the Right boycotts a company, sales go down. (Target &amp; Starbucks)		That’s bcuz conservatives actually have the jobs, money &amp; spending power to back up their protests.

@Clark_Mathews83 Yes. There are 2 sides to every story. Maybe he will tell us that the main reason he shot up a school was bcuz of relentless bullying that made him snap.		Then maybe we would take the issue of bullying more serious, possibly preventing the next mass shooter.		See how that works?
This may be an unpopular opinion, but I would like to hear Nikolas Cruz’s side of the story directly from him himself.		I don’t condone his actions, but Emma Gonzalez admitted to bullying him growing up.		Maybe he can help shine a light on the reasons why he did what he did.

Coddled teenagers with no REAL education in history, civics or politics have absolutely ZERO effect on my support for the 2nd Amendment.  		In fact, their protesting only strengthens my resolve to support the 2nd Amendment even more.
Fact.		The liberal argument is so weak that they need to hide behind children &amp; attack you for criticizing them instead of defending their point.
Hillary’s fall from grace continues &amp; it’s GLORIOUS to watch.		Yesterday she gave a speech for a FREE event at Rutgers University &amp; was paid $25,000.		Looks like it’s a little tougher to make money on speeches when you can't provide uranium or sell out America’s foreign policies.
Liberal logic.		Making fun of 12 year old Barron Trump is fine, but criticizing the 17 year old mouthpieces for their unconstitutional gun-control movement is off limits.
Dear David,		You can't bully people, call them murderers, disrespect public officials on TV, attempt to destroy our Constitution, deliver hate-filled rants, &amp; then run for cover as soon as somebody challenges you because you’re “just a kid”. 		It’s time to grow up, buddy.

David Hogg is your typical liberal.		He publicly advocates his controversial views, but is offended when he hears criticism.		If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen, kiddo.
Liberals - “There’s no way possible we could round up &amp; deport 11 million illegal immigrants.”		Also liberals - “Confiscating 350 million firearms from 120 million gun owners would not be that hard.”
If the Democrats ever got their way &amp; abolished the 2nd Amendment, can the red states become "sanctuary states" where the local &amp; state governments refuse to prosecute or cooperate with the law?		You know, the same way sanctuary states harbor illegal aliens &amp; allow them to vote.
Same thing when they say “fully semi-automatic”..... it doesn’t get any dumber than that.
Anytime I hear someone use that ridiculous phrase "assault weapon" or "assault-style weapon" my brain just reroutes the rest of their comment to the recycling bin.

I’m starting to think if David Hogg’s parents had the balls to punish him when he was disrespectful, he would not be in this position—BUT IT IS LIKELY THAT HIS GRANDPARENTS HAD NO BALLS EITHER—so here we are..... 3 generations deep into the "everybody gets a trophy” mentality.
For anyone who is wondering what DOSH stands for, it’s the last name of one of my best friends who passed away 7 years ago.		I put his name on the back of my hand 5 years ago as a reminder the people I love can be here one day &amp; gone the next, so never take anyone for granted.

I find it hilarious that millions of adult liberals are paying this much attention to prepubescent teenagers, who haven’t even graduated high school, on a topic they have ZERO educational background in.
A new bill in Kansas would make schools liable for shootings if they deny teachers the right to carry a gun on campus.		Perfect!		In fact, I think ALL gun-free zones should be held accountable. If you remove my right to defend myself, then you have the obligation to protect me.

Hey kids.		Over 400 of your classmates have been killed by texting &amp; driving since Parkland. When are you going to have a march for that?
NUMBERS DON’T LIE		Planned Parenthood    vs    The NRA		Money donated	to lawmakers ————$7.8M   $3.2M		Number of children	murdered last year——321K    ZERO		Percent of budget	funded by taxpayers— 40%     ZERO
Many of the people who joined the “March for Our Lives” protest are the same morons that can be found at “Pro-Abortion” rallies.		The level of hypocrisy is almost incomprehensible.
Liberals are calling Trump supporters “Nazis” while at the same time trying to take our guns away, which is exactly what made the Nazi’s so powerful in the first place........		Liberals are the real Nazis.
The people who want to ban guns should be the ones who go door-to-door ATTEMPTING to confiscate them.		And they should do it unarmed so they don’t look like hypocrites.		Let’s see how well that works out for them.
90% of the students that marched can't even name the 3 branches of government, but they want to dictate our Constitutional rights.		No thanks.
David Hogg said he’s going to start a revolution.		Hmmm...		Our side has 8 trillion rounds of ammunition. And his side is confused about which bathroom to use.		Good luck, sparky.
Media - “Bad Trump! Don’t talk tough &amp; impose sanctions.”		**NK now wants to negotiate**		Media - “Bad Trump! Don’t impose trade tariffs.”		**China now wants to negotiate**		When will the media learn that Trump knows what the hell he’s doing????

FACTS &gt; FEELINGS		- Over 60% of gun deaths are due to suicide while only 1% are due to mass shootings		- 0% of all mass shootings were done by NRA members		- 98% of mass shootings occur in gun free zones		- Fatal firearm accidents account for less than 0.4% of all fatal accidents

People in the UK are being arrested for JOKES that are too offensive.		Their government has become authoritarian bcuz they have no guns to keep them in check.		It's so simple a caveman could understand. NO GUNS = NO FREEDOM OR RIGHTS. Too bad liberals are not as smart as cavemen.
David Hogg &amp; the Gun Geek Gang are upset they have to wear clear backpacks &amp; name tags to school now.		Weren’t they JUST complaining that ANY kind of change would be positive?		How does it feel to be universally punished by one person’s crazy actions? Do you fools get it yet?

Parkland students are now required to wear clear backpacks to school.		Yea, bcuz that’s really going to stop the next shooter...		We just had a textbook example in Maryland of what happens when schools have armed security that isn’t afraid to do their job.		Why not emulate that?
Obama sent a letter to the Parkland students commending them on their actions saying they “helped awaken the conscience of the nation.”		Being inspired by kids who have zero life experience is right up his alley. What about commending the officer who stopped the Maryland shooter?
Obama tried to destroy our nation &amp; liberals loved him for it.		Trump is now trying to rescue it for us &amp; they hate him with a passion.		These people are seriously delusional &amp; I pray they get the help they need.

If the Left started a civil war with conservatives, how long would they last before going completely extinct?
Not a single word from CNN’s Golden Boy, David Hogg, on yesterday’s school shooting in Maryland.		What’s wrong, David? Is the media having a hard time writing scripts for you to read? Or is this one too hard to spin &amp; you guys are just hoping it goes away?		@davidhogg111 @CNN
The people who turned their guns in to “help end gun violence” are my favorite.		That’s like throwing away all the food in your house to get rid of the obesity epidemic in America.
I just don’t understand how the shooter was able to pull the trigger without his Maryland State issued Handgun Qualification License. 		And he did it in a gun free zone....		How is this even possible?!?!!?
YouTube is now banning certain content that features guns.		Yep... 		Take away the guns, censor free speech, &amp; do not allow another opinion unless it suits the agenda. 		Germany 1933 all over again. When do we start burning books?
The MSM won’t touch the Maryland shooting because it proves that having armed officers at schools can &amp; WILL save lives.		They would’ve rather had the officer run &amp; hide like the ones in Parkland did so more kids would have died &amp; they could have pushed their gun control agenda.
Yesterday’s shooting is proof that no matter how many laws you make, the people who shouldn't have guns, will still get their hands on one.		That, or they’ll find another way to carry out their evil intentions.		More gun control is a fantasy solution that ignores basic reasoning.
1. Maryland has strict gun control laws.		2. The shooter wasn’t old enough to buy a gun.		3. He used a pistol instead of an AR-15.		4. A good guy with a gun stopped him.		These are the reasons why the MSM refuses to give it any attention - it DESTROYS their anti-gun narrative.
Has there ever been a more bitter, hateful or bigger sore loser than Hillary Clinton?		She has over 1000 reasons why it’s everybody else’s fault but her own that she lost a rigged election.		The only thing she should be worried about is spending life behind bars.		And staircases.
Shout out to the school resource officer who did the job the Broward county deputies refused to do at Parkland - neutralize the shooter.		Imagine that. A good guy with a gun saved countless of innocent people from a bad guy with a gun.		Weird how that works...
A school shooting in Maryland was stopped this morning by an armed resource officer before anyone was killed.		How long are we going to wait until we have a good guy with a gun at every school in America?

Facts.		Privately owned swimming pools are nearly 5 times more likely to cause accidental deaths than having a gun in the house.		And kids under the age of 15 are TWICE as likely to be killed each year by cars backing over them in driveways than by accidental firearm discharges.
London police are warning citizens to think twice before speaking so they can avoid “hate crimes”.		Any comment that somebody else deems offensive may result in a charge.		This is why we are blessed with a First Amendment. We may speak as we think, not as the government demands.

Hillary thinks she lost because women listened to their husbands that told them not to vote for her.		But I could see that being the opposite way around....		Women probably told their husbands that they would spend the next 4 years on the couch if they voted for that witch.
Keep it up, Mr. Mueller.		Your one-sided investigation that is desperately searching for collusion by Trump while ignoring the real collusion by the Democrats is almost over.		Wait until we start a 2nd special counsel that goes after Hillary, Obama, Lynch, McCabe, Comey &amp; YOU!
Hillary said she's "sorry" if women "misinterpreted" her quote saying “women only voted for Trump because their husbands, sons, &amp; other men in their lives told them to”.		No need to apologize....		Watching you fall down the steps &amp; needing men to save you made up for everything!

Why do liberals still act surprised by what President Trump is doing?		He's been telling us his plans for over 2 years now. 		The only shock should be how fast he's doing it. Imagine that, a President that actually does what he says he's going to do.
I couldn’t be any happier about swamp dweller McCabe being fired DAYS before his pension.		This is what happens when you collude to benefit a political party &amp; then lie about it.		Remember when he said he would “torch” everyone at the FBI if this happened?		Time to start singing!

Everybody should have the right to stand up for something. But these kids don't have a clue about what they are protesting. Most of them just wanted a day out of class. Now if they had walked out over the lack of security at our schools, I could have gotten on board with that.
Katy Perry quickly turned her head &amp; tricked a 19 year old into his first kiss during American Idol.		I honestly don’t think it’s a big deal.		But imagine if it were a man that did this to a teenage girl? There would be public outrage &amp; he’d probably be facing charges.
A Florida teenager fatally stabbed a boy on his 13th birthday &amp; injured 2 others during a recent sleepover.		He said reading the Quran gave him the “courage to carry out his actions.”		If the Democrats could twist this &amp; blame it on Trump, it would be dominating the headlines.

A new survey says that mentally ill liberals are 3 times more likely to unfriend you on social media if you disagree with them.
Despite the efforts of Obama, Hillary, the FBI, &amp; the MSM, Trump overcame a rigged election. His approval rating is skyrocketing &amp; the momentum that he’s creating is near unstoppable. His undying passion &amp; perseverance will cement him as one of the greatest Presidents in history.
Elizabeth Warren says she is not running for President.		That should give her plenty of time to take a DNA test &amp; repay all the grants she received by lying about her heritage.

If an 18 year old isn’t trusted to drink a beer, why should they be trusted to vote?		I didn’t know crap about politics at that age &amp; my friends knew even less than I did.		Our brains keep developing until around the age of 25. That’s where I would like to raise the voting age.

Liberals are calling the NRA a “terrorist organization.”		But it makes ZERO sense considering they teach gun safety &amp; NONE of their members have ever gone on a killing spree.		Calling law-abiding citizens who want to defend our Constitution “terrorists” says a lot about liberals.
Jim Acosta is having meltdowns because Sarah Sanders keeps ignoring him at her press conferences.		It doesn’t make sense though.		Why does CNN need to ask questions when they just create their own answers?
How come when Mike Pence says he talks to God, liberals mock him &amp; call him mentally ill, but when Oprah does it nobody says anything?		If it weren’t for double standards, liberals wouldn’t have any at all.
The NRA didn't pull the trigger.	The NRA didn't sell the weapon.	The NRA didn't fail to arrest anyone when all the signs were there.		The NRA is a beacon for freedom. They teach gun safety &amp; push for background check legislation.		Seriously.... how brainwashed can liberals get?

650 people were murdered in Chicago last year alone, but it gets zero media attention because the deaths were spread out &amp; they won’t count that as mass murder.		Plus they have the strictest gun control laws in the nation, &amp; the crime stats don’t support their anti-gun narrative.
Liberals don’t blame the gun when a cop shoots somebody. 		Nor do they call for gun control when an officer is shot. 		Talk about being hypocrites.
South Africa’s government is taking away farmland from white owners &amp; many of them are being murdered. 		This perfectly illustrates why democracy doesn't work. 		And that’s exactly why our Founding Fathers gave us a Constitutional Republic.
A video about a father making his son run to school is going viral.		The kid got kicked off the bus for being a bully, so his dad made him jog 1 mile to school.		I frickin LOVE it!		Snowflakes are melting over this, but it’s their lack of discipline that turns kids into monsters.
In the illogical mind of a liberal, they think 18 year olds are too young to buy a gun, while at the same time believing those 18 year olds are experts on gun issues.

The CMU shooting that took place yesterday was done by someone who stole his father’s gun.		And his father happened to be a police officer...		So if a police officer can’t keep his gun away from his own son, why do liberals think more laws will keep guns away from criminals?
I think it’s hilarious how teenagers that are still confused by their gender &amp; live at home with their parents think they can lecture grown adults (who have jobs, pay taxes, &amp; support their families) on why the government should take our guns away.		Sorry, but I’m not listening.
Liberals have selective outrage for anything the media tells them to get upset about.		They’re pushing for tighter gun control after the Florida shooting but remained silent about the illegal alien who murdered Kate Steinle &amp; the nutjob who shot up the Republican’s baseball team.
Liberals don't think a 20 year old is responsible enough to own a gun, but 17 year olds should be helping us make the laws regarding them.
Fun facts about Trump. 		He turned 1 million into 4 billion. 		He sends mobile hospitals all over the world to shithole countries &amp; has for the last 30 years.		His business failure rate is .92%. Which makes his success rate 99.08%.		And he’s your President for the next 7 years.
Liberals are starting to replace their white porch lights with red bulbs to signify their home is a gun free zone.		What geniuses! Could they make it any easier for criminals?		Also what color do we use to say "this household is armed to the teeth with a massive stash of ammo?”

Dick’s is completely free to stop selling anything they want.		But the public is also free to bash them &amp; spend their money elsewhere.		That's how the free market works.
The average response time by the police is over 11 minutes.		The average speed of a bullet is over 2,500 feet per second.		In a situation where every second matters, it’s smart to have a gun.
Unlike the Left, if Dick's doesn't want to sell “assault weapons” anymore we won't care, we will simply go to a store that does.  		It’s called capitalism, baby.
A new study shows California has the “worst quality of life” in the US.		That’s because it’s run by crazy Democrats. Every slum &amp; every ghetto in America is populated and governed by Democrats. Fact.
A statue of a gorilla in a community playground was removed because some people found it “racially insensitive.”		It’s a frickin gorilla....		Why do we yield every time someone complains? Have we forgotten how to tell people to piss off?
Liberals will demand the confiscation of all guns in the name of saving children’s lives while at the same time condoning the murder of unborn children.		Irony in its purest form.
Drugs are against the law, but the government can’t keep them off the street, out of our classrooms, or even out of our federal prisons.		Yet liberals still think we should disarm ourselves &amp; trust the government to keep the guns away from criminals?		Yea... I don’t think so.

Most people trying to buy a gun illegally are never prosecuted.		In 2010, 80,000 people committed federal crimes by falsifying their background checks, but only 44 of them were prosecuted.		Why create more gun laws when the government fails to enforce the ones we have already?

We’ve had guns in America for over 200 years &amp; only in the last 30 have mass shootings become a problem. This is in large part due to the breakdown of our family structure &amp; the lack of discipline. We need to take more responsibility &amp; stop relying on the govt to raise our kids.
Reasons liberals provide for Trump’s impeachment.		-Conflict of interests	-Climate change	-Racism	-Improper influence	-Fixing an election	-False statements	-Obstruction of justice		It’s funny because they would be 100% correct if they were referring to Obama &amp; his administration.

Boy wonder, David Hogg, said he doesn’t blame the deputies for stopping the shooting because it would have been scary.		So by that logic, maybe firefighters shouldn’t run into burning buildings, surgeons should stay out of emergency rooms, &amp; soldiers shouldn’t enter combat zones.

Liberals will demand gun control every time a crazy person shoots up a school, but never call for border control after innocent Americans are raped &amp; murdered by illegal aliens — which happens EVERY DAY.		They truly take the cake as the world’s biggest hypocrites.
NBC blew $12 BILLION on the worst rated Olympics of all time.		You would think they’d learn the lesson by now, especially after seeing what happened to the NFL.		The television viewers are the ones making the choices &amp; we don't like politics in the midst of our sporting events.
4 of the sheriff’s deputies refused to do their duty &amp; confront the shooter.		And he still has the nerve to tell us only the police should have guns.		Scott Israel is an anti-gun political hack.

After a school shooting in 1974, Israel passed a law mandating armed security in schools, provided gun training to teachers &amp; started running frequent active shooter drills.		There have only been 2 school shootings since then, &amp; both have ended with teachers killing the shooters.
I’m not denying the obvious fact that David Hogg &amp; a few other students are performing the roles of crisis actors &amp; trying to push the media’s anti-gun narrative. But the libs want us to dig deeper into conspiracies so they can scream fake news &amp; divert that attention.
The lib-trolls keep trying to sell me fake news to run with. Not working! 😂 https://t.co/l7KFU6m2CL
I think the teachers who want to conceal carry should be allowed to with the proper training &amp; background checks, including a mental health check. 		They are not only protecting our children, they are protecting their own lives.
Gun sales in Florida are starting to skyrocket as people rush to buy them before any laws have a chance to be implemented.		Libs don't even realize that they’re the best gun salesmen out there! 😂
How come it took a shooting in a rich, white neighborhood to all of a sudden make change happen?		And how come we're not holding townhalls &amp; having mass media coverage of the carnage in cities like Chicago &amp; Detroit, where blacks are 17 times more likely to get shot than whites?
Being the victim of a tragedy does not make you a public policy expert.		In fact, it makes you even less qualified since you are still under the influence of the trauma &amp; more than likely biased because of it.
Join the NRA, not bcuz they support guns, but bcuz they support the Constitution. 		Without the 2A, we wouldn’t have a Constitution. And without that, we would not be living in one of the greatest countries on earth. We would just be another shithole country ruined by socialism.
I have an idea.		Let’s take the $533 million taxpayer dollars used towards Planned Parenthood and redirect it towards arming our schools with extra security.		That would help protect our kids from mass shooters and save the lives of nearly 900 babies per day.
The Dems are scared of the wall being built bcuz they know it will stop illegals, cost them votes &amp; destroy their narrative.		And it’s the same thing for adding more security to our schools / arming teachers.		Shootings would happen less &amp; their anti-gun narrative would suffer.
Fun fact of the day for liberals.		If you are a citizen in the United States of America, then Donald Trump is your President whether you like it or not.
“I’m coming tomorrow morning and I’m going to shoot all of ya b----es.”		This illegal DACA immigrant is 21, still in high school, and threatening to shoot kids.		This is also what Democrats would consider a "Dreamer." https://t.co/jaLxWnKa9Z

Planned Parenthood slaughters a baby about every 98 seconds or so. 		Until you can find something wrong with that, don't even start on gun control.

Remember when liberals remained silent after a Muslim shot and killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub?		I remember.
The companies cutting ties with the NRA are willing to piss off 5 million (and RAPIDLY growing) future customers in order to appease 7,000 people who signed a petition.		Not the smartest marketing decision in my opinion... 😂

Crisis actor @davidhogg111 is defending the cops who were too scared to go in &amp; stop the shooter.		So in other words, the cops refused to confront a gunman, but an unarmed gym teacher did?		I guess the next time I hear a bump in the night I’ll call my old high school gym teacher.
“A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”		Debate over.
@mamasittalove Better question.		Are the 13 Americans who are killed EACH DAY by illegal aliens too low of a number for you to care about?		Sad.
Rifles account for 2% (about 350) of all gun murders. Pistols on the other hand account for 65% (about 8000) of all gun murders. AR-15’s &amp; "assault weapons" account for LESS than 1% of all gun murders. This shows you they're going on people's fears &amp; not actual crime statistics.

Liberals using their 1A are telling me the 2A only applies to muskets because AR’s were not invented yet.		How about you get off your computer, write me a letter with a quill pen, have it delivered to me by a man on a horse, and then we can begin to discuss how wrong you are.
“911, what’s your emergency?”		“There’s someone breaking into my house, could you please send the Broward County Sheriff’s Department to water my garden while I shoot the intruder?”

The NRA is an advocacy group in support of the second Amendment, which is a part of our Constitution. 		The hate towards them makes absolutely zero sense. 		The only person with actual blood on their hands is the murderer himself.
Hey liberals.		Abortion kills 500 times more children than guns do.		So to be consistent, I’m assuming you want those banned too?
If we raise the age to buy a gun, then we DEFINITELY need to raise the age to vote.		We can’t have emotional teenagers voting based off a meme or what they saw on Comedy Central.
I hope the parents of the murder victims sue the hell out of the FBI &amp; police department for gross negligence. 		This event was entirely preventable.
Don’t let the media fool you.		The @NRA has helped generations of Americans through firearm safety programs teaching them how to respect &amp; handle guns in a responsible manner. 		This is not a government funded program, &amp; no member of the NRA has EVER committed a mass murder.
News just broke that 3 officers waited outside of the school &amp; hid behind their vehicles during the shooter’s killing spree.		So let me get this straight.		The school failed, the FBI failed, the cops failed, the officer on site failed, but the media wants to blame the NRA?
We should all join the NRA just to piss off liberals. 		It’s $40 a year or $75 for 2 years.

It's so funny watching people cheer about something they know nothing  about.		Why would any sane person celebrate giving up their right to defend themselves &amp; their family?		Do they not know that over 100 million people were murdered by governments that disarmed them first?
The liberals saying 18 year olds shouldn't be able to by a gun are the same ones saying we should listen to high school kids to solve this problem.
Students across America are walking out of school to protest gun violence.		Maybe if they didn't bully their peers to the point of mental breakdown in the first place this wouldn't be an issue.		According to the CDC, 4,400 children commit suicide each year because of bullying.

I would be more than happy if part of my taxes went towards beefing up the security in our schools.		With the level of hatred, disrespect &amp; mental illness being displayed by kids these days, I wouldn’t feel safe dropping my child off at a school unless it was protected by guards.

A week ago Congress was asking Tide to change their pod designs so teenagers would stop eating them. 		Now this week the media thinks teenagers should determine gun control laws.

I don’t remember people on the left calling for more gun control laws after a 6 time deported illegal alien shot &amp; killed Kate Steinle.		And that’s because illegal aliens are protected by Democrats &amp; the liberal media. It wouldn’t have fit their pro-illegal anti-wall narrative.

I have a news flash for these misguided kids who are drinking the utopian liberal communist party Kool-Aid.  		Planned Parenthood killed more babies by 9 a.m. this morning than the NRA has ever killed in their ENTIRE existence.
Liberals say they will back gun control if it means saving one innocent life, but don’t give a damn about the 3,000 abortions that happen DAILY.		The hypocrisy is unbelievable.
The 2nd Amendment was written in case the people had their government turn tyrannical on them, which is as valid today as it was back then &amp; still will be in the future. It's not about hunting or any other lame reason people come up with. Our Founding Fathers were geniuses.
Serious question for liberals.		Why does Chicago have a crazy gun problem when they have strict gun control laws?

Lol come on guys, this isn’t that hard!		Liberals only freak out during ONE of these scenarios..... think about it.
QUIZ TIME		Which of the following would a liberal NOT be ok with?		A) Illegal aliens killing Americans		B) Inner city youths killing inner city youths		C) A police officer shooting and killing a white person		D) A white man shooting and killing a dozen people at a movie theatre
Chris Rock said he wants to see the same amount of white kids killed per day as black kids. Said he wants to see their moms cry on TV.		This is an example of how low moral values have sunk today when this hateful trash passes as humor.		No wonder there’s such disregard for life.
The willful neglect towards human life we are seeing in our society is the result of lousy, ill-raised people breeding and having lousy, ill-raised kids.		We are witnessing the decline of respect and humanity. And I wish more people could see that.
I don’t remember liberals screaming for gun control when Kate Steinle was killed by an illegal alien.		Maybe because it didn’t fit their narrative.
Fergie’s performance was so bad last night that...		Michael Moore became nauseous and didn't feel like eating.		Illegal immigrants started voluntarily moving back to Mexico.		And Bernie Sanders said he would understand if people wanted to pay Fergie less than male performers.

Liberals want someone they’ve been calling “Hitler” all year to take away their guns. 		This kind of logic is why we need to lock up Tide pods in our stores...
A gun free zone saved somebody’s life the other day.		His name is Nikolas Cruz and he killed 17 people, mostly kids.
@Its_Notmyfault It’s actually closer to 80% and Australians own more guns now than when they were banned in 1996.		Liberals hate those pesky little facts.
Gun control advocates like to point to Australia (.92) &amp; the UK (.92), but always fail to mention other countries with gun control like Mexico (21.5), Brazil (25.2), Venezuela (53.7) &amp; S. Africa (34.2).		*murders per 100,000 people		It’s not a gun problem, it’s a culture problem.
Remember when Lindsey Vonn said she wouldn’t go to the White House after the Olympics?		Turns out she didn’t win a single medal, so she wouldn’t have been invited anyway.		The Trump curse strikes again.
Every genocide in recent history has been preceded by disarming civilians.		Governments murdered more than 170 million innocent civilians in the 20th century alone.		Our 2nd amendment was not created for hunting, it was designed to protect ourselves from a tyrannical government.
When a cop shoots an unarmed black man, liberals scream racism and blame the cop. 		When a psychopath who the FBI failed to investigate shoots up a school, liberals blame the gun.
The media lies and tries to say there have been 18 school shootings in 2018, when there have only been 3 that actually murdered anybody.		Let’s be real.		18 shootings in Chicago is called a Friday night and they have the toughest gun laws in the country.
I love it when liberals act tough.		One side has hundreds of millions of guns and billions of rounds of ammo. 		The other side wears genital costumes and literally screams at the sky in helpless rage.
Pay attention, liberals.		If I came up to you and slapped you across the face, would you be mad at me or my hand? 		This sums up the whole gun control argument.		Logical people would be mad at me because they know my hand does not operate by itself.
Let’s get this straight.		Hillary had the help of the DNC, DOJ, FBI, 90% of the MSM, and doubled Trump in campaign spending.		Meanwhile, an army of 13 Russian internet trolls, with no connection to Trump, were able to swing the election in his favor.		Makes sense!
MASS SHOOTINGS under last 4 Presidents before President Trump		George H. W. Bush - 7 mass shootings	Bill Clinton - 18 mass shootings	George W. Bush - 15 mass shootings	Barack Obama - 37 mass shootings		Up 246% from Bush to Obama		Yet liberals blame Trump for dividing the nation?
Want to prevent school shootings?		Place 3 armed veterans in every school. There are thousands of unemployed trained veterans &amp; retired police officers who would love the job of protecting our children.
LeBron James.		100 million dollar athlete with a 10 cent brain.
President Trump is trying to bring this country together, and restore it back to its original version.		Despite constant attacks from the left, he is delivering his promises to the people who voted for him. 		America is lucky to have this man in office. 		#MAGA
In a bombing, we blame the bomber. With drunk driving, we blame the driver. With a robbery, we blame the robber.		So how come with a shooting, liberals blame the gun?
Liberals like to say the NRA buys politicians.		Wrong.		The NRA doesn’t even crack the top 50 in terms of spending to lobby the federal government.		But liberals will say anything they can to push their narratives.
There are some parents out there who are objecting to metal detectors &amp; armed security in schools because their child “shouldn’t have to go through that.”		If our kids can go through the security protocols required to get into Disneyland, then they can handle doing it at school.
@daspencer81 Mine too! #RIP
Liberals - “Planned Parenthood isn’t profiting off the deaths of children, the NRA is.”		Reality - Planned Parenthood receives 500 million dollars in taxpayer funding, while the NRA receives ZERO.		Not to mention PP also sells fetal body parts.		So tell me again who’s profiting.
The signs weren't missed, they were ignored. There were dozens of calls to the police &amp; FBI tip line to respond to issues involving him.		The authorities failed to act.		Calls for more laws are worthless when the existing laws &amp; law enforcement procedures are blatantly ignored.

Pence gets hammered by Joy Behar for believing in God, but Oprah gets a pass because well, she’s a woman, she’s black and she’s a Democrat.		You do the math.

I think school shooters should face a firing squad so they can feel the same fear their victims felt.
Deporting 11 million illegal immigrants is impossible but disarming half the country against their will sounds doable.		#LiberalLogic
It’s interesting that the same people who fear a dictatorship from Trump are calling to disarm all citizens.		I think they may be confused....
Liberals can use any sad story they want, but they will never justify how taking my guns away for a crime I never did is supposed to stop the criminals who aren’t going to follow the law anyway.		Disarming innocent people doesn’t protect innocent people.
@Matthew17335559 I agree and understand that, but I said it “seems” trivial when you compare it. 		The number of casualties from the Florida shooting happens almost daily by illegal aliens and it gets no coverage.
Liberals give the media too much power to dictate their thoughts.		The media waits for shootings so they can promote their anti-gun agenda. And liberals fall for it each time.		Compared to the 12 Americans who are killed by illegal aliens each day, school shootings seem trivial.
The Florida sheriff has the balls to say anyone who opposes gun control should not get elected.		Maybe you should shut up &amp; do your job better.		The police were called to the shooter’s house THIRTY-NINE times in the years leading up to this &amp; no one did a damn thing to stop him.
I haven't watched a single minute of the Olympics and I don't plan to.		Childish behavior from people like Lindsey Vonn, that loser who cried racism because he didn't get to hold the flag, and the gay figure skater who attacked Mike Pence have turned me off from it.

I'm sick of hearing about the sexual preferences or political opinions of Olympic athletes.  		The competition doesn't involve sex or politics.  		Your job is to win in your sport and not embarrass the United States.
The Trump-Russia collusion has been erased.		What now?		Can’t do “racism” since black unemployment is at a record low.		Can’t do “xenophobia” since Trump offered amnesty for more aliens than the Dems asked for.		Can’t do “sexism” since Trump has a cabinet full of powerful women.
Guns are not our problem, it’s our sick culture.		Our music celebrates drugs, rape, gangs &amp; murder.		Our movies make millions off crime, homicide &amp; gun fights.		And parents no longer discipline their children which causes them to disrepect authority.		Society created this.
The FBI has come clean and said protocols were not followed in dealing with Nikolas Cruz’s disturbing behavior.		You seriously have to wonder if they are allowing these shootings to happen in order to further an anti-gun agenda.
Lebron makes hundreds of millions of dollars to shoot a basketball.		Trump is the leader of our country and he does it for free.		Shut up and dribble. https://t.co/Mn3YjcPv6M

Gun control is not even a debate for people who use their own brains and exist outside the walls of the liberal echo chamber.		But remember, this is the same generation that eats laundry detergent.

Liberals are a SAD group of people.		They know they’re wrong in most situations but aren’t mature enough to accept they were misguided, store new knowledge, then use it to grow.		Instead they throw fits of rage &amp; name-call like children.		They’re really just mad at themselves. https://t.co/2o4hI1whNb
Liberals are being DESTROYED in the gun control argument.		And the only response they have left is that guns are designed to kill.		Wrong.		Guns are designed to protect your life as well as your civil liberties from a tyrannical government.		Read a history book, fools.
What happened yesterday is similar to being hit by a drunk driver.		Who do you blame? 		The automaker? 		The alcohol company?		Or the driver himself?		Unfortunately, most liberals won’t understand this simple analogy.
The Florida shooter literally said he wanted to become a “professional school shooter.”		His Instagram showed disturbing pictures of him with knives &amp; guns.		He was expelled from school for threatening other students.		The red flags were there, but no one did anything about it.
Gun control will NEVER happen.		1. Patriots will never give up their 2A rights. A civil war would ensue.		2. Taking guns away from criminals who don’t care about laws will only leave innocent ppl defenseless.		3. Cities with strict gun control laws have the highest murder rates.
Like or RT if you think trained teachers should have the right to be armed.

People in the United States have had guns in their homes for over 200 years. And mass shootings have only become a problem in the last 30 years. If you look, there is a huge correlation between the rise of gun shootings and the decline of disciplining your children.
@ChristineJaniuk It’s called a basic truth bomb that is so blatantly obvious you’d have to be an idiot to deny it.		Get on board, or get run over.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but I don’t believe there has been a single mass shooting where the shooter was a Trump supporter.		It’s always some psycho from the Democrat Party. The same ones who rant &amp; threaten others all over social media.		Those threats need to be taken seriously.
Agreed. 		Guns don’t shoot people by themselves. In fact, the gun should almost be an irrelevant point.		The suspect’s psychology, beliefs and motives should be studied to get to the root of the actual problem. https://t.co/XZxL0lQ8GQ
The gun control laws that liberals are pushing for would take guns away from responsible gun owners and leave them defenseless.		What do you think criminals who don’t give a shit about gun control laws are going to do then?		It’s not rocket science!
NO LAW IS GOING TO HELP.		Ban hammers, saws, knives, cars, drugs, alcohol, &amp; so forth. Why is it so hard to understand that criminals do not abide by the law? 		They will always have firearms at their disposal. And there is not one law that can be made to stop these shootings.
If you’re going to declare something a gun-free zone, you better have the tools to monitor it.		That means a metal detector with security guards.		And in the crazy messed up world we live in right now, I’m all for that when it comes to our schools and the safety of our children.
Liberals never let a tragedy go to waste.		Too bad conservatives don’t think with emotion.		We understand...		-Guns don’t kill ppl, ppl kill ppl.		-Gun control / gun free zones don’t stop criminals who don’t care about laws.		-Gun control leads to more gun violence. See Chicago.
I can almost guarantee that if a law abiding citizen - in this case, a teacher - was permitted to carry a concealed weapon on school property, there would be a lot less than 17 students dead.
If guns ever get up &amp; start walking around on their own, I will ask the government to confiscate them.		Until then, this is a PEOPLE problem, not a gun problem.
Liberals want to “protect” us by taking our guns away, but don’t want to secure our border...		Why do they even try to hide their sinister intentions anymore?		They hate white people. They hate capitalism. They hate guns. They hate freedom. They hate justice. They HATE America.
When you raise a generation without morals &amp; respect, this is the society you get.		So-called young adults lashing out like children just wanting to hurt anyone.		The sad response from liberals will be to blame everyone but themselves for allowing society to take shape like this.
Shut your mouth.		There is literally a gender-specific pronoun in your name. https://t.co/0t7shWMlbK
If white privilege is a thing, then why does Elizabeth Warren have to pretend to be Native American? 🤔
Every school should have a safety officer on campus. Hell, even an armed and trained teacher could have stopped this.		NO MORE GUN FREE ZONES.
Criminals. Illegal aliens. Cop-killers. Psychopaths. Democrats. Radical Muslims. Liberals. Gang members. Mentally ill. Etc. 		But the media still points the finger at the @NRA who is accountable for most of the responsible gun owners.		You will NEVER get our guns.		#GunControl
Guns are not the problem in our country, mental health is.
Liberals in America will call legal citizens “Nazis” and “Racists” then refer to illegal aliens as “Dreamers.”

Sarah Sanders is a National Treasure. https://t.co/olOVxZcN8J
@Peony459 White people own the resort she holds her retreat for minorities at. 😂
An American black woman started a yoga retreat that bans white people from attending.		Isn’t segregation like this EXACTLY what Martin Luther King marched against?		It’s hard to believe how hateful, childish &amp; ignorant people have become.
And if my last tweet went over anybody’s head, let me explain.		Taxes were cut and the government STILL collected record taxes for the month of January.		That’s because when people spend their extra money on goods, those goods are taxed.		This is a GREAT sign for our economy!
Not only have tax cuts created more jobs, they have boosted the economy by allowing people more money to spend.		The government broke the record for January by collecting more taxes than ever before, leaving us with a $49 billion surplus.		All this winning is wearing me out.
Olympian Adam Rippon doesn’t want the Olympics to be about Mike Pence.		He wants it to be about his gayness and his need for xanax and booze.		This kid is messed up in the head.
The #MeToo accusation movement is quickly becoming the don’t hire a woman movement.
Roses are red	Melania is hot	Trump is your President	Like it or not		#ValentinesDay
@AllisonMelliss1 “She” offered 7.5 million dollars. I asked to speak in person and then “she” sent me the picture below saying “she” couldn’t because “she” was deathly ill. Then followed it up with bank account info...		Lol I ain’t fallin for that shit, but some people might! So heads up, guys. https://t.co/UuB8ORS5xQ
RT @TechQn: @Education4Libs @TyEducatingLibs OMFG how did you two do that with straight faces? That was freaking Hilarious!🤣🤣😂
Warning.		Troll accounts from Haiti or Nigeria or whatever shithole country they’re from are getting good.		They say they’re dying &amp; that God told them to give away their money to a chosen one, then provide bank numbers.		They just want your info.		@AllisonMelliss1 is good at it.
RT @PaperJareplanes: @Education4Libs If the LGBT community made a movie exactly how they wanted, and it wasn't given multiple Academy Award…
Liberals are crying because the movie ‘Black Panther’ didn’t have a character to represent the LGBT community.		LGBTQRSTUVWXYZ$&amp;# people make up less than 3% of the population. 		They don’t NEED to be included in everything. Get over it!!!!!!!
The letter with the suspicious powder addressed to Donald Trump Jr. said “You are an awful person. This is why people hate you. You are getting what you deserve. So shut the f*ck up.” 		I’m not saying this was done by liberals.... but this was definitely done by liberals.
If liberals didn’t have double standards they wouldn't have any at all. https://t.co/036Hi3NEyo
Democrats don't want to fix issues.		Look at the poverty in the black community...		They benefit from that issue by blaming Republicans for it &amp; pretending to be the party that cares.

President Trump donated his 4th quarter salary to the Department of Transportation in an effort to rebuild &amp; modernize our crumbling infrastructure.		Have you ever seen a Democrat give away their own money?		Me neither.... they’re too busy stealing everybody else’s.
Trump wants to cut out food stamps &amp; replace them with boxes of non-perishable foods.		This is awesome!		No more abusing the program on steak &amp; lobster. If you don’t like the free food you are receiving, then bust your ass like the rest of us &amp; get a job.
RT @xwordmark: @Education4Libs It’s amazing how many sentences can be started with “Liberals fail to realize...”🤔
Liberals fail to realize the border wall is more about curbing sex trafficking, heroin, foreign terrorists, and illegal voters than it is from keeping Juan from picking Oranges in California.		These things are a threat to our national security.		Plain and simple.
TDS or Trump Derangement Syndrome is not just a joke anymore.		There are liberals with serious mental and psychological problems that have stemmed from the election and they need to be clinically diagnosed and prescribed medications by professionals at this point.
What we saw yesterday with Donald Trump Jr.’s wife &amp; the envelope scare was a manifestation of what happens when the Democrats &amp; media keep demonizing our POTUS, pushing hateful rhetoric &amp; calling for violence. 		These are truly sick people who lack any kind of decency or morals.
Although you won’t see this on the mainstream media, this was not unusual for Donald Trump. 		He has personally helped many people who were desperate, and sought virtually no recognition for it. https://t.co/W1qcmfcfIP
If the Democrat’s approved a 4 trillion dollar budget, it would have been spent on higher welfare checks &amp; more food stamps for their lazy supporters.		Instead we are in for the best years of economic growth, respected sovereignty, &amp; military might our nation has ever witnessed.
@dbab23 Grow up, bud.
@_DKingAlfa That’s where Twitter cuts off my threads for some reason. Can’t do anything about it...
@justindeperio57 Cuz I’m a broke college kid.
What’s everyone up to?		I’m about to eat a salad, watch some Netflix and fall asleep.		But would anyone like me to follow them back first?		I can do the first 200 who leave a reply!
Pence is a class act. 		Sadly, he gets mocked by idiot liberals for being a decent human being while fake and shallow people like the Kardashians are worshipped.		We live in messed up times.
Walgreens is the latest to allow men into the women’s bathroom.		They can say whatever they want. 		But If any man ever tries to use the girl’s restroom with my sister in there, we’re going to have a VERY big problem.
If you are confused about your gender, simply look down your pants.		Penis = male	Vagina = female		Please help spread the word to gender confused liberals.
I love how liberals think that attending college, going $100,000 into debt, and earning a degree in a worthless major like gender studies somehow makes them more “intelligent” than everyone else.		Some of the dumbest people I've ever met got straight A's in school.
Shout out to Sarah Sanders!		I don’t know how she’s able to walk into a group of partisan political hacks everyday, answer their gotcha questions, &amp; not end up knocking somebody’s arrogant teeth out.		She’s doing a fantastic job &amp; has more patience than anyone I’ve ever seen.
Liberals making/believing accusations without any evidence is starting to get REALLY old.		Next time you see a liberal, say “So John, how long has it been since you beat your wife?"		And when he denies it, say "prove it!”		Then tell him “see, do you get it now?”
7500 signatures in the first 72 hours!!!		Let’s try to get this thing past 10,000 by tomorrow morning!		The closer we get to the 100,000 goal, the more likely people are to sign &amp; share. Especially the big names!		Please keep passing it around!		Thanks!!!		https://t.co/WQyEPgoLZF https://t.co/ETFeNGyHXK
The gay Olympic skater says he will boycott the White House if invited.		Honestly, who cares?		Trump should start a new tradition: Don't invite anyone other than true heroes (police, vets, EMTs, etc) to the White House.		Sports champs can have a congratulatory letter in the mail.
The same media who applauds taking a knee during our National Anthem wants Vice President Mike Pence to stand for North Korea.		Let that sink in.
RT @TyEducatingLibs: Obama's portrait was just unveiled... The artist who painted the portrait is Kehinde Wiley, and if you haven't seen so…
Donald Trump Jr.’s wife has been hospitalized due to opening an envelope with a suspicious white powder in it.		Only sick f*cking people would do something like this.		Please keep her and the rest of the Trump family in your thoughts and prayers.
Does anyone remember when the # symbol used to be called the pound sign? 		I can’t read the me too posts anymore without thinking #PoundMeToo 😂
It’s actually WAY more than 9 billion bullets, but you guys get the picture!
Liberals keep talking about another civil war.		One side has over 400 million guns and more than 9 billion bullets.		The other side doesn’t know which bathroom to use.		Good luck with that.
Trump is systematically dismantling everything the progressives have done to ruin this country for the last 40 plus years. They thought they had the election and the future completely in the bag with Obama, then Hillary. That is why they are so desperate to do away with him.

Don’t let the liberal media paint a picture of how North Korean life is. 		Listen to the defectors who have personally experienced the horrific life under their communist regime.
Dreamers are threatening to leave the country soon if a DACA deal isn’t reached.		Soooo... we WANT them out and now they're threatening to leave if they don't get to stay?		Wow, my head hurts.
Over 5000 signatures in the first 48 hours!!		It is now the highest active petition on the government homepage.		WE CAN DO THIS.		If everyone recruits 10 friends to sign, we will easily reach the 100,000 required in 30 days.		Please sign &amp; share!		Thanks!		https://t.co/WQyEPg7aB5
5 years ago I woke up to Obama’s corrupt administration.		I became so passionate trying to warn people of his hidden agenda that I started making music to expose it.		I wasn’t very good though, so I think I’ll stick to tweeting. 😂		*explicit language*		https://t.co/rJKXjjZBYY
A school in California removed a science project that connected IQ’s to race because of complaints.		So now it's discriminatory to use scientific methods to measure intelligence and discern whether there's a link to ethnicity because it HURT SOMEONE'S FEELINGS?!
An Eagles player said meeting Trump wasn’t worth his time.		Well watching football wasn’t worth OUR time. That’s why the Super Bowl ratings were at an 8 year low.		Trump should tell the entire Eagles team to stay home and invite 50 veteran Eagles fans to take their place instead.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand says Trump doesn’t value women.		For someone who doesn't value women, he has certainly placed them at the highest levels of government.		Ever heard of Nikki Haley? Sarah Sanders? Kellyanne Conway? Hope Hicks? Kirstjen Nielsen? Betsy DeVos? Elaine Chao?
It's amazing how liberals can hate this country so much that they would side with a diabolical enemy like the NK leadership.
Our mainstream media is drooling over the power and control that North Korea’s media has over their own people.		They want that so badly.
Victor Quinonez, the student at El Rancho High School in California who recorded his teacher’s anti-military rant, has now been invited to visit the White House and Pentagon.		Big difference from the last administration who would invite people like Clock Boy.
BREAKING NEWS		The White House has released the Democrat’s memo. https://t.co/zfSKDKsGFY
The person who wrote this article should be sent to a North Korean concentration camp.		Then we can see if they are singing the same tune afterwards. https://t.co/9Am1ZeMkUs
North Korea should do very well in the Olympics.		Especially in the new event called the 500 meter starving defector dash.
I’m white. I’m conservative. And I couldn’t care less what color you are. Be a decent human. Work hard. Be kind. Treat others like you want to be treated. It really could be that simple if liberals would stop stirring up the hate pot every chance they get.
CNN is the Communist News Network so it’s no surprise they are gushing over North Korea at the Olympics.
An Eagles player said the White House visit wasn’t “worth his time.”		That’s fine. We can find a million other people that would be more grateful &amp; deserving.		Why don’t you go on television instead &amp; talk about how your fans trashed, vandalized &amp; stole from businesses?		Dummy.
Shout out to all the women who support our President &amp; aren’t scared to speak their mind.		Trump’s name has became almost taboo in states like mine &amp; it takes courage to stand up to brainless, aggressive liberals.		Trump women are smart, strong, &amp; can make independent decisions.
On my way to a Mardi Gras party!		I will try to use my best judgment, but you know how I get when that alcohol kicks in...

Question.		Why are other countries allowed to enforce their immigration laws but we are not?		Answer.		Because Democrats fight tooth &amp; nail to do anything to keep them here such as creating sanctuary cities &amp; opposing the wall.		Without those extra votes, they’d never win again.
Obama’s election was the worst thing to ever happen to this country. 		Trump’s election was the best.		We now have a great leader in office ready to Drain the Swamp, put America First, &amp; take this country to new heights most people haven’t even dreamed of yet.		#MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
