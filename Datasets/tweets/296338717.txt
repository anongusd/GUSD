Today's their first day playing outside. And the only reason I share is because life is all about the small stuff. Try to enjoy it.
I live above a daycare. Through the open window at my desk, I can hear the sound of children at play all summer long. Fall comes, they go away, and I hardly remember it. But when they emerge each spring, it gives me such a sense of joy at the start of a new season.
I hate the word “adulting” but I will say that the two things that have me most hype in 2019 are my new luggage (Christmas gift from parents) and a new rug I just bought for my living room

VR is predominantly for entertainment + some education. AR will be a utility, applied to almost anything. My guess: AR wins #ModernMonday
A6: Augmented reality and virtual reality will dominate 2016. Better question: which will win? #ModernMonday
A5: Easiest question on the list. My iPhone. It is the epicenter of connection: business, personal, everything in between #ModernMonday
.@wirecutter But we’ll also learn which companies to trust. Security will become priority one when buying a new product. #ModernMonday
.@wirecutter 1/2 less openness in spaces usually very private, like the home. Alexa is listening. Canary is watching. #ModernMonday
RT @wirecutter: A4 when you use services, read the fine print, always https://t.co/oNHr6ibD0l #ModernMonday
A4: In most ways, we can’t. New frontiers!
A3: Impatience grows. Eventually there will be no waiting for anything. On-demand everything. In short, efficiency. #ModernMonday
Yes! Voice recognition! How we connect with these devices is more important than devices themselves #ModernMonday  https://t.co/EfU4UqA6cw
A2: Not what’s next but what’s better. Low cost appliances. Not expensive stuff (fridge, oven) that are infrequently upgraded. #ModernMonday
@wirecutter @LetUsSuppose Also giving back the irreplaceable resource of TIME. Folks living in LA can get their lives back! #ModernMonday
Exactly! The more integration between IoT products, the better off the consumer. #ModernMonday  https://t.co/rXHLYo1u8T
2/2 This technology will eventually let us control our smart home gadgets without switching between a dozen apps. Natural language &gt; clicks.
1/2 My favorite innovation of 2015 was better voice recognition technology. Ex. Amazon Echo, improved Siri, Google Now. #ModernMonday
