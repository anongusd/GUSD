Love my honest, supporting Republicans and I hope I can continue to say that after Brett‚Äôs confirmation.  Voted democrat sometimes in the past if I thought they would be good for my country but never again
@DavidLimbaugh Yes she had her mind made up and acted upon it with her fellow Democrats.  Feel sorry for the abuse they gave Christine but her actions on TV did not show to be too smart regardless of her degrees-she was easy prey and they took advantage of her.
Turn k√ºmmel off.  I used to enjoy his show but never watch it now.  Nasty man as is all late shows.  What happened to ones like Carson and even Leno??  Fun shows and never missed https://t.co/NW0jl9u5cu
@Lrihendry Doesn‚Äôt make sense does it?  Dems will stab anyone in the back.  Also it wasn‚Äôt until Christy went to the news that the threats started so don‚Äôt blame anyone for this charade but yourself.  60 sex partners in teen years,  maybe a hooker??
@davidmackau Did this lady report this incident so the attacker could be punished.  Yes there is fear but we face fear everyday and should not turn away from it.  Report these attacks so things like Christy/Brett won‚Äôt happen and the wrong person ruined.  False accuser liar stats r up a lot

@nedryun Adam, you stupid a‚Äîthe FBI does not investigate this stuff unless it‚Äôs a federal crime-all they would do is an intensive background check and Brett had 6 of them.  Christy would not want that if she had 60 sex partners in her teens.  Not a good background to check out.
I believe Christine did have something happen to her but I do not believe it was not Kavanaugh. No friends can corroborate  even when she said they were there.  Brett‚Äôs many friends ALL sealed his good reputation. She had 60 plus sex partner so how could she remember who it was https://t.co/1GPNqX5maV

What has happened to our country.  I remember Truman a Democrat bombing Hiroshima, we stood by him; then 9/11 and the country came together; then Benghazi and the democrats lied about what happened and there was chaos.  Now it is hatred because of jealousy and GOP is MAGA-thanks!

@RealJamesWoods They took prayers and discipline out it the schools; people became more materialistic so women left their family in childcare to join the workforce to have nicer things.  Some women have to work to support their families and I support and admire them.  Discipline and values gone
@bfraser747 @magamidge They held up signs they didn‚Äôt even know what was written on them.  Really shows how uninformed these people and they just have no common sense.
@theblaze I really feel for the young men and women who lost their friends but it was not the gun that killed them but the mixed up young pulling the trigger.  The same young man that some of these students knew he was mentally challenged and never stepped up to the plate and reported him.
@realDonaldTrump If the young man had walked into the school and laid the gun on a desk, how many students would have died? It is the person, not the gun.  If he had let his gun st home, nobody would have died.  Where has the common sense gone since I was a kid 80 years ago?
@TuckerCarlson @FoxNews If guns kill as the democrats believe then we should just plant a lot of guns in Syria, Afghanistan and other countries then any problems would be solved.  See how stupid that sounds.  The guns have to be in the hands of people.  Duh!!
Why are we still talking about Rob Porter when he is fired.  Isn‚Äôt that a personal issue and should be handled between man and wife.  Not Pres. responsibility to fix domestic violence but to run our country.

The stock market is helping those who have retirement funds.  Working hard to clean the swamps.  Use your common sense and wake up.
@ChristiChat @realDonaldTrump Like him or not, he is making your life better because he is giving u more money because of his tax bill; he is making you and your children safer and when the walls built you will see a decrease in drugs; helping our military keep you safe by making it stronger.

@RebeccaTraughb2 @PaulaInTulsaOK @ChristiChat I m 80 and I remember on a bus going south with the blacks to the back of the bus and water fountains for blacks and for whites.  Restaurants too.  That is just the way it was and remember it was the Democrats that had the slaves and were the KKK.  No republicans involved.
@PeterDo35348554 @BarbMuenchen Yep they are dead.  Joseph Kennedy‚Äôs speech was a another disgrace for the Dems.  I agree that democrat friends are embarrassed because they think their friends believe they feel the same way the political Dems believe.  Just them telling lies not Trump.

@mike_Zollo @videogirlprod Sorry but I didn‚Äôt see anyone doing to Obama that they are doing to Trump just because Hillary did not win.  Obama was treated like a God and became the worse President this country has ever had.
@mike_Zollo Vote them out in all elections and get rid of their lies
@ANOMALY1 Beautifully done and I have loved this song for 80 years and still love it.  God Bless the USA and the men and women who gave me the freedom that I have today.
@MarkRocon Thats the kind of education that our children are getting today---nothing!!!
@TheTrumpLady @BarbMuenchen @NIVIsa4031 @DonnaWR8 @DonaldJTrumpJr @LeahR77 @TheLeftIsRacist @SandraTXAS @mikandynothem @GeorgiaDirtRoad @JrcheneyJohn Isn't that dress becoming for a future President?  How deploring and unbecoming for a future President.  Melania, on the other hand is so elegant, like JackieO.
@marklevinshow Has she been checked out in a psychiatric clinic yet??  She should get out of politics as she is doing no good at all for her constituents.
@mike_Zollo If I take my children to another country illegally, then doesn't that make me responsible for what happens to them.  If I am asked to leave, then it is my responsibility to make sure they are leaving also.
@Lrihendry They have not been heard because they did not speak up.  The women today are so insecure, selfish, and do not have confidence enough to stand up to a man when she should.  If you are good enough they won't fire you or you can get another job.
@NIVIsa4031 @GrizzleMeister @Boyd_2650 @bgood12345 @kwilli1046 @KatTheHammer1 @polishprincessh @SierraWhiskee @AMErikaNGIRLBOT @hotfunkytown @NinaMorton Absolutely a terrible statement coming from a then VP.
@ChristiChat Sure she know--all hollywood knew.  Do we want a President whose dress is so tight that her breasts are bulging out over the top.  Typical insecure Hollywood women, can't even slap a man's face if he is inappropriate like was done in the 50's and 60's where women had dignity.
@jaketapper Jake should be fired due to all the poor interviews he does.  He thinks that he is a good newsperson--well he is not, he is just a gossiper who thinks his shit don't stink
I believe the three Trump ladies that have been criticized are the classiest ladies since Jackie Kennedy and Laura Bush.  Some people cannot understand how this wonderful family are getting our country together again.  Love them.

Does  the nut case on MSNBC realize that the $38 million in taxes that Trump paid in taxes could pay more than 580 people, $65000.00 per yr.
@60Minutes Obama is worst Pres. and thinks he did well.  Released a person who committed treason.  Delusional man and egotistical man.
