@NickFalacci @McAllisterDen What the fuck? That is a dumb statement with absolutely no evidence to support your claim. Last I checked, this is a country of freedom where all people have equal opportunity. Just have to work hard for it. Stop playing victim all the time.
@Janaa_Vet @RealDark_Kent @CB618444 So, basically, just keep it up ladies. Plenty of other good men left in the world for you to destroy. Plenty of families left to tear apart. Plenty of it all. Your position of love and unity is countered by your willingness to falsely accuse. #stopit
@Janaa_Vet @RealDark_Kent @CB618444 Yeah, but don‚Äôt forget...it isn‚Äôt the validity of the accusation against a man. It is the bravery of a woman bringing her story forward. Regardless of evidence or due process. Because if we don‚Äôt just believe the woman, we are sexist and telling other woman they don‚Äôt matter.
@Merlotmike My post was not meant as a threat but as a reminder to these young idiots that one day someone will be carrying. On that day, someone will be shot. Assaulting someone with a baton is a justified situation to protect yourself by any means necessary.
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie I don‚Äôt think it open mindedness as much as it is not being willing to condemn people. I have made plenty of mistakes. Anyone who says they haven‚Äôt is not being truthful to themselves or others. I won‚Äôt be apart of a social lynching on either side.
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie If the mistake was indeed made. I will continue to refrain from condemning the man based on a 36 year old mistake he, as of yet, did not commit.
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie But that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that people do change and if this turns out to be true that he lose all credibility of being a good man for 36 years. @CoryBooker admittedly grouped a young woman in college and still maintains a career.
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie The reason no one should allow this to effect their choice is because it is a clear false accusation. The evidence as of yet have clearly indicated a smear campaign against Kavanaugh. A tactic of the left they have no remorse in using.
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie How is that a question you would seriously ask? I think anyone in there right mind would. But there are statutes of limitations, due process and plain common sense. This was a smear campaign of an alleged incident. With no corroboration.
@clintonkowach Thank you government intervention!
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie Additionally, an allegation doesn‚Äôt prove a person‚Äôs lack of character. It is just that, an allegation. You have zero right to condemn a man for being accused. You can only condemn him if they are proven right. That is due process.
@NotSilencer @robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie I think they have been met with serious consideration and after the committee questioned both ford and Kavanaugh, it has been concluded he is innocent of the charges and we should move on. Of course, anything that happened to dr ford is horrible. It just was Kavanaugh.
@SiddonsDan @RubyRockstar333 Haha I am a social warrior. Come at me bro! 		These people forget. You want a war...you will loose. We carry 45‚Äôs and you carry batons...think before you act. 		This is not a country to proud of. Not at all. I am starting to believe it is time for a split.
From hence forth. I expect that all democratic leaders of the senate that identify as liberal or left or center, will obstain from having any alcohol ever. Potential or current. It is unethical to have ever drink. And they are all unfit for leadership if they have.
@theblaze Well, that did it. I am sold. If a 17 year old with no life experience tells me to reach out to my senator to vote no against a credible and distinguished adult judge...I guess I am just gonna have to take her word for it. Sorry Brett! Gotta go with the kids on this one!
@CoryBooker #BelieveEvidenceNotGender #BelieveEvidence 		Let‚Äôs believe the truth. Not accusations. Due process is innocent until proven guilty. Not guilty because she is brave. By the way, someone is $500,000 richer for her heroism. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è		While Brett‚Äôs name is permanently ruined. üëçüèº
@CoryBooker Since I know you won‚Äôt. Let me say this...		Your have been a national disgrace in your term as a senator. Accomplishing little to nothing. I urge you to resign. To do your first true act of public service. Resign for the sexual misconduct against the woman you assaulted.
@CoryBooker @CoryBooker you admitted to sexually assaulting a woman. How‚Äôs she doing? How‚Äôs your career been hindered? How‚Äôs the your famil suffering? You despicable man. Arrogant and pompous. I dare you to reach out to me personally and explain why you have any right to be employed.
@CNN Well, I guess I was right to assume even after fords testimony was proven to be a false narrative...Brett would still be condemned by people who don‚Äôt understand due process. Ford is not telling the truth. Brett is now a victim of a vicious attack from the left. End of story.
@charliekirk11 @TomMRocco Oh but racism against white, male, Republicans is not a real thing! You can only be oppressed if you aren‚Äôt one of us. You can only be right if you aren‚Äôt one of us. It‚Äôs just how life is now I guess.
@SenFeinstein Listening to your full of shit address to the committee. Maybe resign for the sake of the American people. Thank you!
In high school @SenFeinstein made mention of balls in a speech at a place and a time I can not specify or remember. But, I know she was talking about my balls specifically. I wasn‚Äôt technically born then. But this has hindered my ability to have relationships. #sarcasm
@benshapiro @Hoosiers1986 Why can‚Äôt a man have righteous anger? Why can‚Äôt I get mad if someone falsely accuses me? Why can‚Äôt I get mad if @CoryBooker dares to question my reputation based of sexual misconduct. He grabbed boobs with @TomCruise in the background saying, ‚Äúyou got this goose.‚Äù WTF
@IngrahamAngle @RubyRockstar333 @CoryBooker @SenFeinstein It just seems to me that a person can lie under oath and get away with it as long as they are accepted by the public. @CoryBooker can do exactly what Brett is accused of and then dare to question him! It‚Äôs just mind blowing.
@IngrahamAngle @RubyRockstar333 Right!? Only women, ethnic minorities and gays whatever..	Seem to be allowed to claim victim or oppressed. What about Brett? Where is his vindication? Where is @CoryBooker alleged victims justice? Why is @SenFeinstein allowed to slander?

@40rosemarie To smear people‚Äôs names in effort to have a political victory.
@40rosemarie Have you ever considered it‚Äôs because some people don‚Äôt want to dignify false accusations? That they won‚Äôt allow for these smear campaigns to purposely hinder the conformation hearings? Or are you one of those people who thinks women can‚Äôt lie and that it‚Äôs beyond the left...
Me: ‚Äúhate speech is a piece of shit and it sucks baggy balls!‚Äù		Hate Speech: ‚Äúhey, you hurt my feelings and can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù		Me: ‚Äúoh, so then, now what?‚Äù
@40rosemarie So, where is the justice for the men when it is proven they were slandered? It is no where.
@40rosemarie I think people are just tired of the #metoo movement happening with little to no evidence. Yes, many men were guilty. But, countless others have been ruined because women started coming out and telling lies. It‚Äôs bull shit. There needs to be hard evidence.
@40rosemarie They have expressed since there is no evidence proving the claims true, this makes it a smear. If the women are proven liars, will their names be tarnished? Or will people still claim Brett is a rapist? I doubt seriously the women will pay the price for slandering his name.
@40rosemarie @MichaelAvenatti is simply taking advantage of women willing to, as of right now, lie about a man and damage his reputation. Absolutely zero evidence has been presented to condemn the man. Don‚Äôt be foolish.
@40rosemarie I only believe people when there is evidence. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a man or a woman. No evidence, no truth to your accusation. End of story. Innocent until proven guilty still applies to this situation. While, instead, you believe them because it is women accusing a man.
@SenFeinstein Please resign! Save us the trouble for gods sake. It would be your first true act of public service! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! Resign!!!
@40rosemarie I don‚Äôt believe it is ok to commit any crime. I am simply saying that it is equally as monstrous to claim attempted rape from 36 years ago with no evidence to support your claim. It will ruin a mans life. SMH. Women, men...we all need to be able to move on and stop caring.
@StandBackUp2 It‚Äôs so hard to believe that someone made a bad choice? Or, that someone is lying about what happened? Which would be categorized as a present bad choice? This accusation true or false will ruin a person‚Äôs life for good. That is unbelievable.
@robgreg1975 @DLoesch @km_kathie So people can‚Äôt change for the better? It seems people like to forget that we all make mistakes and commit acts that are questionable and/or bad. From a young age we can all be slandered or smeared for our choices.
If it comes out the accusations are true the woman will be vindicated. But if she is proven a liar. What will happen to Brett? Well, I will tell you. Nothing. He will forever be know as an attempted rapist. That‚Äôs bull shit.  https://t.co/JERAizpVqS
@DLoesch @km_kathie Additionally, people would get along much better if forgiveness were at the center of everyone‚Äôs thought process. Instead of this bigoted hatred for everyone they disagree with. It‚Äôs pathetic people.
@DLoesch @km_kathie Why the hell do we even care about shit that happened 20 plus years ago? Mistakes happen. Men and women alike make mistakes when they are young, it is called life. I have made plenty, my fianc√© has made plenty, everyone on here has made plenty. #whocares #mistakesaremade
@dbongino Truly an embarrassment. People like him are why this country won‚Äôt last much longer unless something radical happens.
@WildFlowerSeed_ @MichaelAvenatti This is a stall tactic. That‚Äôs it. Asking the FBI to investigate does not mean that the man is guilty of anything. It only means the left is using slander to stall the hearing so they can potentially win the senate back and block all nominations. Don‚Äôt be foolish.
@MichaelAvenatti Holy hell people. Do all we have to do these days is...accuse someone of assault after 20 years and smear names for a victory? What the hell do any one of you commenting know about a god dammed thing? 		This is politics, pandering to the stupidity of the public. Wake up! Damn.
@MichaelAvenatti You aren‚Äôt qualified friend. It‚Äôs noble, if for the right reasons, to desire a public office. But you are limited in experience and can‚Äôt effectively lead a country. 		It would be like me running for President. We don‚Äôt know what we are doing. So, stop.

@davidhogg111 It took me a minute to really follow what your point was here. But I don‚Äôt think anyone is arguing this today. 		Women and men are equal under law. The issue is more social than systematic anymore. Even still, I don‚Äôt think there will be happiness until power shift happens.

@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I just said I am done. It was a pleasure exchanging ideas with you.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill That's your opinion. I honestly cant do this anymore. You wont agree with me and see reason and I personally cant think like a bigot. So there.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill So the issue...remains...why, in gods name, would you continue to try and adopt from organizations that legally can refuse sale based on religious faith?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You get over it. Because it is their right. And your right is to suck it up, find the next orphanage and move on in life and continue being who you are. 		You cant say one "some rights mean more for some than others" that bigotry and discrimination. Exactly what you're fighting.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You are so incredibly entitled...and I say that in the least condescending way I possibly can. 		Private businesses can and do choose their clientele. If a Christian owned orphanage, that's private and doesn't recieve state funds, chooses not to allow LGBT to adopt.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill To attack them for holding fast to faith and religious morals is intolerant and demeaning their faith to being less important than the LGBT and creates further inequality.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Forcing someone to go against their moral statutes is harmful to another person...your attacking their faith. A faith protected by law. 		These Christian Adoption agencies in OK have a right to refuse adoption if the adopting parents do not meet with organizational standards.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill How are you sure the harm is one sided though?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill This has been fun, by the way. No hate. Just sharing ideas and talking. Loving it. It's the only way forward in my opinion.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill It's fine. I was going mad lol. Easy mistake though. I went gold panning once and learned that word. I wanted to keep letting it go but I couldn't lol.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You have to look at it from their perspective. They dont see it as intolerance but as a Godly command. And while abiding by a command from God, they believe they are in the right on the issue. I dont see how you dont understand your religious intolerance.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You seriously have no tolerance for someone who disagrees with you. And it is evident.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Correct. So you are impeding people with religion by telling them they cant vote because their religion makes them intolerant. And stop using tennants aa a term for law. It means discoverer of metals.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Answer me this. Do you tolerate Christians being influenced by their faith when presented with a law to vote on? Being that the 1A says they are allowed to have freedom of religion. And, that the law wasnt drafted in respect of religion but voted on by conscience.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You keep using the first amendment. You do know exactly what it says right? And how to interpret it correctly. 		Also, tolerance has a universal definition that is accepted. It's not my definition. It is simply your inability to be tolerant of an ideology different from yours.
@ewikiskafa @Xicanayque @thehill Bullying another group based on the premise that you are intolerant of their decision from democratic process is bigotry. You can‚Äôt fight bigotry with bigotry. 		You‚Äôre defeating your own purpose at that point. 	You‚Äôre also proving you don‚Äôt believe in true equality.
@ewikiskafa @Xicanayque @thehill Public funds can not be restricted from use as a political hostage. They are using this to attempt to bully other voters into swaying their decision that was made in a democratic process. 		California has long fought for EVERYONE to have equal rights, yet here they are...
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill God you're impossible. Intolerance, no matter what opinon you're intolerant of, is bigotry. 		Let me ask you this. 		Why do you think people aren't allowed to be influenced by religion when it comes to voting?
@ewikiskafa @Xicanayque @thehill No, individual freedom and rights is what we care about. Both are determined by popular vote.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Unless you will admit that people who oppose the LGBT have a right to do so regardless of their reasons to why...if you admit that. I'll stand down.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill üòÇ please dont quote the constitution if you aren't willing to accept that everyone has a right to their opinion and you dont have a right to silence it, even if it offends you. 		You clearly only want to use our most sacred document for your own gain. Not equality.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill If you choose to be narrow minded. I cant help that. But it is your free right to think the way you do. No matter how I feel about, or think of,your thought process.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I support everyone's equal right to vote for who and what they want based on their beliefs. ALL AMERICANS. Free individuals allowed to their political opinion.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I never said that. I said I am ok with people voting their conscience no matter what influences them. You're the bigot trying to silence people based on their opinion and being intolerant of different.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I am saying how our democratic process works is the majority passes laws. The minority has rights. If LGBT wins those in opposition are upset. If those  that oppose LGBT win. LGBT is upset. There's balance because of democratic process. If you dont like it, sorry.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Hahaha LGBT has the right to not suffer because someone disagrees with them. Get the hell over it. And stop being bigots while crying bigotry.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Seriously. It is not a hard concept.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Correct. It also says "or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." Meaning religion. If a person can freely act upon their religious views. That means they can freely be influenced by it and that also means they can freely vote how their religion guides them.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill This has gone on long enough. If you cant see it. You never will. I am sorry you are blind to it.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill One human right in the constitution is religious freedom...and being influenced on how you vote by that religion is not unconstitutional. Forcing someone otherwise is being a bigot. You're to stubborn to understand I guess.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill It's not hard to understand that you are in fact being a bigot right now by imposing your opinion as better and disregarding others because they believe in something you disrespect.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill And again, Sharia law is different because it is a law that is derived directly from a religious standard through a government that backs the religion itself.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You cant tell someone to vote how you want them to if it goes against their religious freedoms in America.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Sharia law is a religiously imposed law...completely different from people voting their conscience that is influenced by religion. How are you not getting that you are being intolerant of other peoples opinions simply because of how they derive it? That's bigotry.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Also, stop deflecting.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You're deflecting. 		I have explained. 		Law presented: Should LGBT community be allowed to adopt children? Yes, no. 		If your constituents are primarily Christian conservative, that doesn't make the law passed a religious...well not Tennant. But law.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill See the issue with that? You are in turn being a bigot as well. Fighting bigotry with bigotry...effective so far.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Which. You seem to have issue with people voting their conscience if it is a conscience different from your own. Having utter disregard and disrespect for their opinions or feelings. While expecting full acknowledgment/acceptance of your own.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill That doesn't mean the verbiage "separation of church and state" is though. 		Not arguing that Congress cant put forth a law that specifically reflects a religion. But I am arguing that religion can influence ones morals. And to be a bigot toward that is wrong.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Does there need to be another reason? Does it truly matter if someone disagrees with you? It is up to you how you respond...either with love and acceptance or equal bigotry. That's what really matters and what brings about true change.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Ohhh almost forgot. Church and state isn't law verbiage. No where in the constitution is it stated "separation of church and state" that was Jefferson. Just so we are clear about that.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I have answered all yours. Come on. It is a simple question.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But! The law was put forth and voted for by a majority that hold a different moral standard than others...perfectly legal in a free people‚Äôs democratic process. 		Again. Why is your bigotry ok and theirs is not? Simple question.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill It is not based on religion. But if a law is out for vote. And the majority of voters base their values based on religion vote against the law...then church and state are still separated. The state didn‚Äôt create a law based on ONE specific religion...
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill What makes theirs more wrong than yours?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill First. Preferences can be changed. Just saying. 		Secondly, intolerance is real. And I disagree with it. I have said this now three times. 		What I am saying is if they are being bigots. Why is your bigotry, intolerance of opinions, acceptable?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Why is it ok for you to be equally bigoted towards Christians because you feel they are voting against a law you agree with? 		Why is it bigoted to vote based on values of religion?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Disagree with what? Their opinion? Their voted stance? Their majority morality? Social standard? 		You see, the issue here is you think that your opinions matter more than someone else‚Äôs. And that you forcing that on others is ok. While you demonize others doing the same.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Bad example. Doctors take a type of oath that they will take all life as equal and treat them medically no matter what. That‚Äôs been around for ages actually. Kind of a code to doctors. 		You are silencing people. You are saying OK is bigoted. Why? Because you disagree...
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Two questions. Are Christians harming people? 		Are Christians harmed by attacks from others based on their religious views?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Yeah u have the freedom to choose and move away. Or fight it legally through petitions and rallies and protest even.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Personally, I don‚Äôt believ they are harming anyone. And to the second question. With how many states allow it. Why would you choose to live some where that restricts you? It is your choice to be ‚Äúharmed‚Äù by someone‚Äôs view point or political stance. If you disagree...
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But I am confused because it seems that you are narrow minded and are ok with restricting a groups voice and limiting their rights for the sake of others...so I am curious as to why you feel you can silence one group with out reprimand?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill How are you and CA not imposing your views on others and trying to force others to agree with your views and way of thinking? This has become a double standard on your part. BTW I am not religious in anyway. I actually support all peoples rights and freedom.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill So break that down for me.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Why? Because government funds are based on the taxes of every person. They are public funds. And public funds can‚Äôt be banned because of political value. Private funds can. Not public funds though.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I mean seriously though. If a private business can‚Äôt discriminate in your opinion...why can the state of CA do it with out consequences when state funds can‚Äôt be determined based on political value? That is illegal.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But you just said a second ago that public services have no right to discriminate based on religious views, sexual orientation or anything like that. So I am confused. Are you ok with discrimination or not?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You do realize companies pay taxes right? They dont recieve them. If they do recieve government funding then they are held to different standards. Yes. But private companies can make decisions like, refusing to make a cake due to religious beliefs. Not a hard concept kid.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill And to follow that up. I mean to say. 		You cant, simply because you're offended, demand retribution. The government shouldn't be involved with that. You should just get over it. Let the other person think how they want and respond how they want.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill That's tyranny. When the government or a group of people tell my freedoms dont mean shit.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I dont care. That's his right to think that way. He owns the PRIVATE business. He built it. It is his prerogative. The government or you cant tell him otherwise.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Haven't you figured out yet that I could care less if you're offended. I think you should just get over it lol.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill If he is offended by a religious person and their beliefs he is absolutely in his right to do so. Likewise those who believe what he does not. Have equal rights to choose to not buy from him/get over his statement and shop anyway.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But when those boundaries become controlling and constrict others freedom to benefit another group. You have crossed a line.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill It's as simple as...you demand people to live and think a certain way. And when those people demand the same. You say its hate. When they ask to be left alone. You claim hate. People all have a right to do what they want with in boundaries set up.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Accept this. So why bother trying.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill There is a huge difference between a public service and a private service for exchange of money. You're being socialist is all and dony understand free market economics and peoples right to serve or not serve based on religious standards or morals. You cant/wont
@Ffsnotthisagain @PrisonPlanet I have no defensive feelings at all.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Someone absolutely can refuse business based on skin color. Does that make it right, well of course it doesn't make it right. But, people are with in their right to refuse service.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill If I am held to a religious standard and you do not meet them. I have a right to refuse service.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill It's a private business. They serve people who come to purchase. If they choose to refuse. That is their right. Only government establishments are held to the standard your speaking of. If I own a company. I can choose who I serve.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Anyone can refuse service to anyone. Especially if their religious views call for it.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill The owner has complete control over their business. It's called free market economics. How do you not get that? You cant demand services from someone. And a privately owned establishment can refuse service to anyone. Just ask the Trumo supporters that were kicked out of a bar.
@Ffsnotthisagain @PrisonPlanet And if you disagree. Cool! That's how my family works and you dont have to like it.
@Ffsnotthisagain @PrisonPlanet Her, she teaches motherhood to the daughters and womanhood. Me. I teach fatherhood and manhood.
@Ffsnotthisagain @PrisonPlanet I believe it is my duty to love, provide and protect. My fiance believes that her duty is to love, nurture and be compassionate. She works, I work. But at the end of the day we both teach our children different things.
@Ffsnotthisagain @PrisonPlanet Clear or not. I would assume based on social evolution that he means motherhood vs fatherhood. Traditional mothers teach about motherhood and fathers about fatherhood. How men and women are different and play different roles when it comes to protector vs nurturer.
@Cholie43 @ABC @PollackHunter üëçüëç
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You ask others to accept the LGBT lifestyle. Yet demand retribution when they refuse because of religious beliefs. Because you cant accept they disagree. See the problem?
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Are you genuinely only capable of asking open ended questions? Honest question. 		Most relevant example would be the lesbian couple that sued a couple for refusing to bake them a cake because of religious views. Their lawsuit ruined that family.
@Cholie43 @ABC @PollackHunter This wasnt a post to pick a fight. If you want to discuss anything feel free to message me. I wont be a part anything more than supporting this family and others on this thread.
@Ffsnotthisagain @PrisonPlanet I dont think he is against women working. Traditional gender roles can include a woman working in today's society. I think he is addressing motherhood and fatherhood. More than working. But most people are responding with work.
@PrisonPlanet But I am sure some fem will misinterpret this and make me out to be evil.
@PrisonPlanet Gender roles can stay the same. Man, woman...whatever. In my home my fianc√© works and so do I. She will continue to work if she wants to. Or, if she doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs fine too. I will continue to work because I love her and want her to have everything she wants.
Not roles so much as I believe there are two genders. https://t.co/onIE5bmwcU
The double standard of the left is getting out of hand.
@ABC @PollackHunter I am a NRA member. And this is sad. "No parent should have to bury their child." 		So the comments that we are sick. Evil. Etc. Are not necessary. We are heart broken for these children and their families as well.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But I also love in reality where that isn't happening. While the LGBT demand more and more. Those who speak out against them are discriminated against and attacked. So...I just chalk it up to get another..."I deserve more and you cant day shit about it" things.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But that includes everyone. Not just LGBT. I think those who openly oppose LGBT deserve the same rights as those who support or are a part of LGBT. Because equality means equality. Across the whole  spectrum.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Honestly, I dont fully agree with the LGBT thing. It's getting out of hand in my opinion with how things are happening. But I personally believe everyone has certain birth rights and beyond that everyone deserves equal rights, regardless of my own opinion or others.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill How are you coming to these conclusions? Rights exist. But they are not ironclad. As history has shown. Rights evolve along with the human species.
@littttle_lola @Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill How do you know I am filled with hate.? So old to be so ignorant to make such a statement about another person. Sad.
@Mandy_Rabble @littttle_lola @nubivagantist @thehill But of course because I defend the rights of those who disagree with you. You‚Äôre upset and label me as unknowing, ignorant or whatever.
@Mandy_Rabble @littttle_lola @nubivagantist @thehill I never said I don‚Äôt think all humans deserve equal rights. Not once. I have simply been expressing how reality works. How did you miss that? It‚Äôs like as simple as possible? Or it‚Äôs really, truly simple.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Damn right you could!
@ChrJMHoffmann @donco6 @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 @POTUS Good luck with that approach
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Actually. That right could be voted on. If we the people chose to change that law. We could actually amend it. Supreme court determines constitutionality. But the people could change that if they wanted. But inalienable is different from constitutional.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 @POTUS Lol. Seriously though. Keep me in mind if shit ever hits the fan. May just be happy to have a friend willing to fight back.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 @POTUS Nope. Just a normal American willing to fight for my rights if the time comes. https://t.co/dfTPLigV2o
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Oh my. You just blew my mind kiddo.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 @POTUS I mean seriously. Dumb.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 @POTUS Literally would take me five seconds to grab it and be ready for a fight. Why do you care so much? Why do you want my guns gone? If push comes shove you might want to be my friend it shit ever hits the fan.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Read the God dammed dec of independence! Life liberty and pursuit of  happiness (or property depending on which statement from Jefferson you want to take.)
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 @POTUS Might not change anything but it will damn sure cause some damage. Dont be ignorant guy.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 @POTUS I love how you think it would be so easy. You underestimate the power of citizens banning together.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Actually, very simple. Does that mean that one group is more right than the other? No it doesn't. It just means society still holds fast to a certain expectation. Once time evolves opinion. Then and only then. Can law be changed to show a new standard.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill If changed. Everyone can marry anyone they choose. While the minority has the right to disagree and continue to fight for a repeal. Or...it doesn't change and those who disagree have the right to continue to push for the right to marry by law.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But for that to become a right...it has to be voted for. The entire population is then asked. Yes or no...after it is tallied...you then present which group now has popular opinion...at which point law is changed or stays the same.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Born with rights are predetermined from social standard. Rights beyond that are determined by the laws we create. Which are voted for. 		Like marriage: it is the right of men and women to marry. It is also the right of LGBT to argue they have the same right to marry...
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill You have inalienable, born with rights. And rights determined from popular vote. Everyone cant just say they have a right. Then there would be no law.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Depends. There are two types as put forth in the declaration of independence and the constitution.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Founding fathers? You mean Hamilton expressed concerns to another, Jefferson. That doesn't mean you can through that term out and say the we were built on majority rule and minority rights. When we 100% were.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I would be careful in explaining funding fathers said by misconstruing that Hamilton did in fact Express fears of the majority. But that was one man. While the rest stood by the decision made. The actual term wasnt coined until 1800 something by tocqueville. And later Mill.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Oh! Wikipedia! My favorite source of knowledge. He said sarcastically.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Haha ok. I was trying to keep it from going this way. But hey. It's cool.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Man I haven't had to list those names in a while. Let's see. I can remember three of the top of my head.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Also, that term was introduced in the middle 1800s so... it definitely wasnt a founding father. That happened in the..late 1700s. So, yeah. I can look it up. But dont care to...I dont agree to with the ideology.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Haha you would take offense to that. I used the burger place to make sure I didnt bring up anything of controversy. Lol
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Who penned it or who actually wrote it? Those are two different questions.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Not sure by who.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I am sorry. I attacked the professors of today. I know it wasnt coined by one of them recently. It was coined in the 1800s of I remember correctly.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Because that term is a bull shit term recently created by a liberal, socialist professor in efforts to undermine a government that's worked for years.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill So what you're saying...is if the majority of America wants McDonald's for our national burger and the minority wants Wendy's...		If it becomes law that McDonald's is the national burger. The majority is reigning through tyranny. Even after voting?
RT @DTrumpPoll: Based on his performance so far as @POTUS would you vote for @realDonaldTrump in 2020?		#TheResistance #MAGA #Trump 		Pleas‚Ä¶
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill And people did vote on my right to vote. I had to wait until 18. And they voted that before I was born.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I am not advocating tyranny. I am advocating democracy. Where when you have many people. The majority gets rule and the minority has rights. I promise you. You wont complain when you're apart of the majority. Why? Because you'll be getting your way at that point.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill That's why I say that equality is a hard thing to ha e across the board because someone will always feel left out today.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Like I said. You're trying to silence others by the use of law the same as others trying to silence you. 		Our government though was set up so the majority would rule and the minority would have rights.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Is being allowed to change the law by individual efforts.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill I understand what you are saying. But do you understand that religiou people have rights as well? And it is their right to say LGBT can not get married. That they stand by marriage being between a man and woman only. And if it is voted into law. Then minority right...
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But see. You are infringing on those same 1A rights of those with religious views and ideologies and morality. So what makes it offensive to one and not the other. What makes it acceptable to infringe upon one and not the other. That's why we vote in things.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill If the popular vote says they want it gone. Then that's what should happen. Ideally...everyone has equal rights. I wont argue that. But equal rights means so much more than "if you get to, than so do i."
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Equal rights should never be bullied into action. LGBT have the right to say they want same rights...while the opposite side has EQUAL right to say they dont agree. I dont see how that's not understood. If you force it on people at that point equality means nothing.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 That's not economical. I am glad you aren't my chief fiance officer! Otherwise I'd be broke and going under already before starting out!! Lol stupid ideology like yours isn't going to work so wise up old man!
@karmadilllo Well I am aware anyone can throw anyone out of their private establishment. You own the place. You make the rules their. Government isn't privatized though.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill So they were bullied into agreeing with Cali? I would say, am saying, it is a bully tactic and discrimination against other peoples views and political stance. It's that simple. Yet you all defend their ban because you care more about LGBT and not everyone.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 And my taxes go to spending I dont agree with. All the time!! So not sure why you brought up taxes. They essential to government stability. They can be abused though. Like they are today.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 That's not true. I have worked hard. And saved. And started my own company in the process. It is still building. But the point is anyone can do it. Just takes heart. Something you clearly dont have.
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill If you disagree with the state laws in Oklahoma dont live there. That's solved. Banning travel is burning a bridge and I would argue illegal. And I am sure they are still investigating legality since the first black listed state.
@JacobAWohl Yes, completely agree. https://t.co/iW3pnXtsLg
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill Right, well...we will agree to disagree on this. Because banning spending doesn't only effect one outlet by many...California keeps going it will be a stand alone country a some point. Which again, is fine with me.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I dont have to do anything. Capitalism rewards those who work hard, while leaving those who dont behind. I choose to work hard so I can have and not be left wanting. That's not slavery.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Now you want to talk economics!? Wow, ok. I am not owned. I have gone into a contractual agreement to work in exchange for money. I rely on those who have created said work...yes...but what makes this country great is I can choose to not work, work or make my own work.
@MMFlint Haha fascism? Really? Giovanni Gentile's ideology of government? You do realize that is more in line with democratic ideology right? Not Republican...but hey, would expect you to know. Just make another transformers already. https://t.co/4TvMyAFpKl
@Mandy_Rabble @nubivagantist @thehill But Oklahoma doesn't have a right to choose to not support the same laws as California...It's a double standard. But I'm again sure you dont see it that way like the last person I was communicating with.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I make my own choices based on reality. Some choices seem forced but that is only depending on ones perception. But the truth is I am free. Free to choose whatever I want. I can either choose well and be rewarded. Or choose poorly and suffer consequences. Simple really.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 No one owns me son.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Well, I am legally allowed to train/teach. So, someone else has said I am responsible. Well, the cop who trained me said so. Signed off and everything!!! Whoop whoop!
@ewikiskafa @Xicanayque @thehill Haha yeah I have read. Added to the list of 8 states already under government banned states...no government funded travel to states that disagree with California. Got it, thanks.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I am pretty responsible with my ownership. But it's cool bud.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11  https://t.co/BvoBDlii2G
@ibrokemyserious @thehill Yeah. I got a little out of control. That's my bad.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill I dont need a law degree to read. Nor to see logic! And I thought we already said good luck to each other! That is usually the sign of the end of a discussion.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 To late?!? Late for what? I am usually...actually...always on time. Never late. 		Look, you have a misconception about gun ownership. But it's ok! Because in America I dont have to agree with you!! Whoop whoop! https://t.co/ml2oDggClf
@ibrokemyserious @thehill Haha ok, thanks! Good luck to you also!
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I am jumping right on that for you...still wont change my mind. But in typing this I have grown...2 minutes older. Thanks for the advice!!
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Wap? Is that like an insult of sorts? Truly curious.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill Or whatever. I am making it up as I go. But it sounds right. 		Moral of the story is that Californians claim acceptance, love and hate discrimination and yet...they ban government funded travle to a specific state to "fight bigotry." Right...because that's how you fight it.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill Discriminated in their right to have the ability to travel based on their political affiliation and religious view...
@ibrokemyserious @thehill Because of their political stance, based on Christian ideology, you have thus discriminated against the majority in that state. Even further. Employees of the government that may need to travel there for any reason. Cannot because you have equally...
@ibrokemyserious @thehill Ummm kind of exactly how it works...ok. break down. 		Since the 1800's OK has been predominantly Christian...that means the constituents would lean to more conservative views. Especially in the area of gay rights. So, if you ban travel to a state...
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Wow...ummm. ok. I'm going to the range. Enjoy your thought process there bud.
I am not sure what's going on anymore. Peoples arguments and what they say is ok vs. not ok...is really getting confusing.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Hold on, recieving transmission...oh damn. Connection interrupted. Have to wait for that response to come through later.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Haha. They may kill me. They may not kill me. But if my rights and yours are infringed upon by the government. I will fight and I would prefer to live through it, if not, i would have died fighting for what i saw as right.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill So peoples religious views are laughable to you then? Or a states views on gay marriage is laughable? What happened to the freedom of choice in America. Where everyone is entitled to choose how they see fit to live and with what opinions. With out government intervention.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Depends on what you're hunting but ok. Listen, you and I dont agree. So just leave it off there.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill What protected class? Well, firstly being that the state has a heavy influence of Christian believers and representatives...I'd say religion. But of course you have something to say that negates it. So by all means. Go ahead.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Well I explained best I could. But think what you want. Good talk.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I say like you, because people with your mindset clearly desire government control compared to my desire for less government. But, that doesn't change the fact that most gun owners. I'd say 98%, respect the law and the weapon. More than you've given credit for.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I also own other guns to match the fire power of the government. Because, if the time called, I could join a militia and be prepared to fight for my state and country. In the other hand. I am equally prepared to fight my government if more people like you gain power.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 For me personally. I own guns for a couple of reasons. Shockingly, none to do with bullying or senseless killing, but with a respect for my right to own one and my participation in firearm events such as competitive shooting and hunting.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 You are correct that the second amendment states "a well regulated militia, for the security of the state can be formed and the right to bear arms shall not be infringed." Cant argue that. But! Where you have gone wrong is to assume the reason behind gun ownership.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 And my dick is small...ok. is that everything? Am I allowed to respond now?
@ibrokemyserious @thehill I apologize I typed title IV. I was on the phone. Title VII, that's the one. Thanks for googling that for me!
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 Oh I forgot one thing. I am also on a bully trip? Meaning I bought them to simply be a bully.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 So I bought a gun because I am insecure and with the intention of attacking and killing in full conciousness...that's your perception of gun ownership? Just to be clear about it all.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill The state has to adhere to federal law. It would fall under Title IV - discrimination laws. People are protected federally.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill I did read it. Did I miss the "just kidding" somewhere? Or are we really letting a state ban travel to another state? (Government funded not government funded, does not matter. Still wrong, still not legal.)
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I am still confused...what makes me big with my gun? Seriously, you haven't made sense yet. Are you asking what makes me powerful? What makes me have the right? Or what...you make little to no sense.
@nubivagantist @thehill How is that a joke?
@Xicanayque @thehill Then we agree. If they are banning travel, they are being bigoted and discriminative (maybe a word?)?  And therefore this law is in fact illegal because it infringes on people's freedoms...if it actually becomes law or exists.
@ChrJMHoffmann @pls_hurry @scamandrio11 I dont even know where to begin with your comment...just so much stupid in one statement.
@ibrokemyserious @thehill So it's funny when state governments restrict freedoms? Or did I miss interpret your response? 		This is a dangerous move if it is really happening. Creating a ban simply because of political or personal belief is a step towards totalitarianism.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 I guess what I am really saying is you, @POTUS, the Dems...any of you can have my guns. Just be ready for a fight if you try.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 I feel like that was a stupid question and you should have known why we were given the right to "bear arms" in the constitution. The same right @POTUS defends. So...there's that.
@donco6 @pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 Well, if the government comes for my guns. And many others. We have the right to ban together in force to prevent tyranny from diminishing our freedoms. I mean, not a hard concept. Kind of the reason we are a country in the first place. You know, the revolutionary war? Duh?
I am pretty sure that this is further evidence that California has flown off the edge of reality. "We hate discrimination, but if you want to go to Oklahoma or need funding to do so...we wont help you because we discriminate against the whole state." https://t.co/Y5JJh8cPSM
@thehill Well, that is illegal. You can't discriminate against an entire state like that just because you disagree with their stance on an issue. Just another example of Democrats using their power to diminish the rights of others.
@SenSchumer @SenSchumer, you‚Äôre telling me that you push the laws of this nation? While fighting the president at every turn of the page to make our laws stronger for the protection of the country‚Äôs borders? Wow, you really fell out of touch with reality, huh?
@pls_hurry @ChrJMHoffmann @scamandrio11 üòÇ he said that‚Äôs how you allow trump to be a dictator. Well, we still have our guns which deters those in power from taking more. So, there‚Äôs that. And Republicans believe in individual freedom...not totalitarian oppression...that‚Äôs the Dems that believe that.
@TalbertSwan Wow, you say more hateful shit than any single person I know. So maybe stand down son.
The double standard is horrific. But I don‚Äôt think anyone cares anymore...seems people are coming to their senses about truth and the leadership of @POTUS https://t.co/YnmJVfgdQ4
@SenSchumer Oh my, you're sounding like Giovanni Gentile...you know, the Italian philosopher know as the father of fascism...what's next? Calling for the death of anyone who doesn't think like you do? Stand down son, you do not care about others. You only care about you. @SenSchumer
@WalshFreedom Ha, so we are still twisting words for pawns to swallow whole? Well, twitter...home to the stupid and easily manipulated. 		He called it a nice letter...it‚Äôs called an assumption...showing diplomatic respect. You know...respect, that thing you all don‚Äôt understand.
@WalshFreedom Did you fall from reaching out to far there bud? https://t.co/Ax1SEP2kq0
@JalynPitre @VFX_post @SoCuteBabies The whole families involvement. 		I big hint was his overall nerves about going to meet her parents. Then the brother talking about martial arts, again hypnotherapy, the obsessive collections, signs of narcissism...just pay attention to the movie and you'll catch on to its story.
@JalynPitre @VFX_post @SoCuteBabies Obviously I had to watch to get the exact details. But I guessed the gist of it all. Sure, his bud pulling up in a TSA car, the other dude...murder suicide move...I didnt predict that. 		I did however predict the use of hypnosis to control the victims of the town.
@JalynPitre @VFX_post @SoCuteBabies 1000 different ways to say that than how you did. I would watch my wording next time. Came across like you were looking for a fight. 		From the start I knew the movie was about race. All it took for me was them introducing hypnotherapy for his smoking. Then I figured it out.
@JalynPitre @VFX_post @SoCuteBabies If you wanted to pick a fight...you picked the wrong post. But you have a wonderful Memorial Day!
@JalynPitre @VFX_post @SoCuteBabies Are you making my comment racist...and for what reason? Because you don‚Äôt know me. 		I am saying the movie was predictable. From its first commercial we knew it was going to be about race. You could guess every scene though. Hence, predictable.
@JoyAnnReid Ha, I say do it. Quit watching professional sports years ago...personally I say disband the entire league and stop paying people millions to just toss a ball around.
Just bought a cup of coffee for an officer of the law. It isn't much. But to see his smile and how he appreciates the support was totally worth it! Show some love to your law enforcement y'all. 99.99% of them are good men and women.
@RokNRollFantasy @VFX_post @SoCuteBabies The commercials have away a lot and from the start the family was off. As soon as they mentioned hypnosis therapy, it was just clicks from there.
@foxandfriends These men can protest! Just not AT WORK! it is really that simple. If I am held to these standards then so should everyone else. Even though that doesn‚Äôt happen and standards I am expected to keep and meet...others are not.

How much do you want to bet @davidhogg111 plays video games with gun violence in them and talks to his buddies about what guns to use and deal more damage. Like every other idiot seeking gun control.
@BarackObama Just curious...but if you were so against big business and capitalism. Like most of your dimwitted groupies...why are you so excited to partner with one to make money off creating liberal propaganda? Or are you planning on sharing that wealth through even distribution?
I have noticed a lot less liberal commentary on posts these days. You all seeing how everything you pushed were lies from the media? Or just tired of being wrong? Or...what is it?
@tellthetruth484 @ChrisMulhearn @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Still using accusations that were never proved as true to discredit supporters and the @POTUS himself? Yeah because that's not played out.
@KayaJones Ouch...I am positive you just did it. @POTUS is so hurt by your move that he is going to resign and let stupid fucks  take Washington over again. Ohhh, wait...no one cares. Didnt even know you owned anything.
@ChrisMulhearn @realDonaldTrump Oh my...I dont know if you're just that far out of touch with reality or if you really believe what you just said. 		But when @POTUS does something. He is doing it for America. Unlike the people I am going to assume you support. People who truly care about winning. And only that.
Explain to me how you can claim being a pacifist and anti-gun, yet play violent video games...talk about your favorite gun in the games...then seriously proclaim your aren't a hypocrite. I mean...come on people.

@AlienDimeBag It depends on the politics for me. Certain things do need my voice. And yours. And everyone else's.
@AlienDimeBag But my stance against being afraid of having an opinion. Remains. I believe we shouldn't have to fear reaction for having a certain stance. But you're right when you say it would be wonderful to see love prevail over hatred. Which means acceptance of everyone.
@AlienDimeBag I agree. Being silent can speak volumes. But there is also time for speech. Take me for example. On social media. I voice my opinion with out being asked. Yet in person, I only voice it when I am asked. Why? Because I know not everyone agrees with me.
@AlienDimeBag Why shouldn't we? And if we are...why should we expect a fight? If you're a liberal, I wont agree with you on most of your ideology. And likewise you won't agree with mine. But we shouldn't hate one another because of it. Only problem is, that's where we are in life now..
If you're Republican...forget it...you're going to be hated and mistreated. That's just the world we live in today.

@redd_drake @commonsensekev @TheSithChicken @WalshFreedom You say by the way a lot.
Been a while since I have posted much of anything. But it is time again to make comments about the people of the USA. Especially those on the left. Because they are insane.
I guess some people wont ever change. Even though @realDonaldTrump is doing good for this country, people still want to find reasons to hate the man. Embarrassing America.
The other problem we face in this country, besides the left, are our pop artists and actors in Hollywood/elsewhere. These people think they are doing good when in fact they are destroying America brick by brick.
The far left started by chaining the blacks to their pasts and holding them back from success through programs designed to hinder. Now they are using all minorities to do the same thing. Remember, when you want to complain about a white person in power. Think about who reps you.
Students have no idea about policy or ideology. They are told what to think and then they think it. 		Shame really. But hey, America has had it's time as a world super power. I guess it is someone else's turn. Now's a great time to take over.
It's funny, now that things are settling out. The left seems to be using the rights arguments. 		The left are so delusional they can't even remember what they actually stand for. Or that they stand for anything.
Let's not break down the poor decision making skills by the you lady.

@mavalos018 I doubt you understand what I am saying because I left my thesaurus at home. But walk away with this bud. 		You can't rightfully place blame on a group of people for the mistakes of our nation's past. You can blame those who made the mistakes, sure.
@mavalos018 For whatever it is you want to hate them for. Let's learn and grow forward. 		That means stop blaming whites today for whatever it is you think they are responsible for by the actions of ancestors.
@mavalos018 Look kid. Which you are obviously a kid. The history of the world happened. If you want to blame others for whatever, that's your right to do so. But remember this. With out the history of our nation and world, we wouldn't be here today. Instead of accusing whites...
@k0089936 @DanaGucciardo @CollinRugg I wasn't talking to you at all. But that's fine. We weren't even disagreeing. I just wanted to know when the video was filmed.
@mavalos018 On top of things. To accuse whites today for the actions of any whites to have lived 200-1000 years ago, is racist. You are generalizing an entire ethnicity as inferior...racist.
@mavalos018 Where would Mexicans be if it weren't for colonization of the Spanish? 		Did you forget about the Mexican leader Santa Anna who had control of Texas. But was beaten by Texans in their revolution? At that point, not a state of America.

@mavalos018 Also, I just want to be clear. My ancestors actually only ever fought others for money or glory. Mostly against other white people. Because my ancestors are...wait for it...From Denmark and Finland. 		Known as Vikings. They pillaged, raped and killed other white people. A lot.
@mavalos018 Look kid, I'm not going to explain this any further. If this is How you see white people. From a racist, ignorant stand point based on their ancestors...(neglecting that of Latino history, current affairs)...then, I have nothing more to say to you!

@MattyBros @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Honestly, just reading your statements before you would understand what I am saying now. Your ignorant and that is fine. 		But with the death of Christ the believer was freed from the old covenant and placed with in the new. That's why nothing you said holds any value.
@MattyBros @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren That isn't the point here. So you missed it. 		And if you don't know about Christianity. Then I'd advise you to not saying. There is a separation from old testament and new. Where you are using the old as a way to make proofs. When, it is a tool for learning how to not behave.
@BrennaSimonSays @MattyBros @TomiLahren I think you should read the posts again. Because they were never on the same page. I wouldn‚Äôt have engaged in defense of religious people with someone who agreed with what I just said...I engaged with people attacking their beliefs. Like you! But, you‚Äôre right. Enough now.
@MattyBros @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Prayer doesn‚Äôt make things better. People behaving by the high standard of living required in the Bible is what makes things better. 		Again, their beliefs. Not mine. But it‚Äôs fine that you don‚Äôt read the whole tweet.
@BrennaSimonSays @MattyBros @TomiLahren If their bible influences their choices. Then you have no right to tell them it can‚Äôt. That is the truth of it. If you don‚Äôt like it. I am sorry. But again, that is the way it works and you can‚Äôt stop that.
@BrennaSimonSays @MattyBros @TomiLahren And that is you trying to silence the voice of others from expressing their opinions and values based on your dislike of their religion. 		It is truthfully disgusting you claim such acceptance then banish them from having an opinion.
@MattyBros @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I‚Äôm just defending people‚Äôs right to believe it if they want to. Against people like you who want to attack them for their free right to study, believe and be influenced by the word of god.
@MattyBros @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren That‚Äôs your outlook on it. But you clearly have no understanding of righteous justice. A theological ideology that Gods justice is higher than mans and if you live against his commandments then you are liable for the punishment. 		But again, I don‚Äôt believe in this stuff.
@AlienDimeBag It is to much fun to argue
Ha banned again! Oh well, Twitter is a shit show joke anyway. Let's liberals say all sorts of derogatory shit then blocks me when I say something mean back. Stupid! Probably shouldn't have been mean. But that guy was stupid.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren It isn't what you've been saying. At all. You jack ass. 		Just worthless, a worthless person. 		I'm drunk right now with my fiance and don't have time for worthless people. With nothing valuable to contribute. Which is you. Read your posts.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren So seriously you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren So, you're full of shit. And need to take a seat and stop posting false information. 		Another note, 80% of people who buy guns generally wait 2-4 business days on average to hear back from the FFL.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren The entire process at a minimum takes 45 minutes. How do I know this? I am not only a gun owner but sold guns for my first job out of high school.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren That is where he hands your information to the agent checking your background. A process that at least takes 20-30 minutes itself. After review they come out and sell you the gun.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren You also said that you answered two questions. The paper work as 13 questions you have to read through and answer each one with a check. 		Then after the dealer reviews the sheet. He goes back to make the call to the FFL
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren You're saying you have a license to carry you dumb ass. That is called a concealed carry permit. You can't get on of those in 20 minutes. It is impossible. 		There are some states with open carry laws and you can carry a visible side arm in designated areas.
@hayhuhj Thanks, I Could Use your thoughts and prayers.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Being that I own many, I know more about the universal process than you do. So, basically you need to stand down son.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren So, before you post horse shit like this know what the fuck you're talking about. 		Also, gun retailers can at their own discretion refuse sale to anyone behaving suspiciously.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Concealed carry is only obtained after a class, 12-20 hours. An extensive background check and at least 6 months of a waiting period.
@brandoncolonn @cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren See I know you're full of shit because every gun form has 13 questions about your history, including any felony convictions. ANY felony means your can't buy a gun. No matter the offense. 		Also, it takes longer than 20 minutes to have a license to carry a gun.
@carita_paige @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Also, have anyone of you thought about not responding to her? If you hate what she says so much and what we have to say as well...just don‚Äôt reply to us. Or follow us. Then you don‚Äôt have to feel the need to respond emotionally. Just saying.
@carita_paige @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Last I checked, her counter parts in the liberal media do the same thing and are praised for being voices of reason against the Republican trash of this country. 		Let her say what she wants. It is her right to do so.
@carita_paige @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren So now people who support Republican values, Godly values and conservative policies...are minions of the people who voice those opinions? No one is perfect, including @TomiLahren. She is young and she is upset about the condition of her country.
We have lost sight of being United. We are now a hate filled nation where if you don't agree...You are a piece of üí©
These numbers mean nothing to the mind of a liberal. All they see is...		Women's rights	Free choice	Beauty even if killing yourself 		The list goes on. https://t.co/bHJepE1HAY
@parracookie @southern4MAGA Prayer is a way that men and women can speak to God to ask his influence to be present through them for others. 		Meaning...pray that we promote love and compassion so people don't feel they should commit evil and awful crimes.
@southern4MAGA I am not a Christian. But I believe in God and have studied his word. The bible promotes good values if read with the inspiration of the holy spirit. 		If not, you will be influenced by evil to misinterpret its writings and conclude God is evil himself.
It's amazing how when a liberal party leader says something you value it as truth. But when a conservative says something...it came from Russia or is a lie. 		#LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

Google has made America stupid. Any person with a keyboard thinks they have all the answers. 		I have lost complete faith in the future of this country. We are doomed to self destruct, and when we do, there will be no coming back from it.
@BaxaHertin Then, ask some loaded question expecting to corner me about a subject you know nothing about. Like guns. Or purchasing them. Or the hatred we have for owning them. 		So in plain words...good day.
@BaxaHertin But know when you finally cross someone's line. They might just fire back. Which I did. You disagree with me  and I get that. I am sure everything I say here, you will directly connect it with some outlandish accusation of my character.
@BaxaHertin Finally, before I sit down to dinner with my fiance...know this. You have been hateful, insulting and pushed me to the point to respond. I did say rude things back and for that I am sorry.
@BaxaHertin Or, are you just ignorant of gun ownership and think that just because one or two people do something evil with a gun, you should GENERALIZE the rest of us as evil and hateful.
@BaxaHertin Next, I fail to see how being a member of the NRA makes some hateful...Because you think guns are hateful? Or that it is a group of people who seek to protect my right to property by fighting legislation seeking to restrict my rights to gun ownership?
@BaxaHertin Firstly, I have a family. You're not more important than hearing about their day. Second, I didn't directly say you have daddy issues. I said perhaps, hence why you feel the need to attack me openly on Twitter. Accusing me of not reading and being dull.
@CherryLimeade_3 @BaxaHertin There are 1000's of bots.
@CherryLimeade_3 @BaxaHertin Eh well it was fun anyway.
@CherryLimeade_3 @BaxaHertin Also, she is quiet now.
@CherryLimeade_3 @BaxaHertin I mean, one can only assume. It's a classic bullying technique from deep, embedded issues that usually stem from a poor home environment.
@BaxaHertin But, maybe daddy just doesn't love you. Or perhaps mom was a little tough. Perhaps, some close hurt you with something inappropriate....I don't know. I don't know you. Could be many things. But, I learned that from a book. About psychology...case you were wondering.
@BaxaHertin You realize that is a psychological issue. You are putting me down because you feel some sort of need to feel better about your lack of something. I can infere it is the lack of smarts because you're attacking mine.
@BaxaHertin So you haven't made generalizations yourself? Your just attacking my intelligence because, perhaps you feel better about your lack there of by putting me down for misspelling a few words?
@BaxaHertin Fortunately for me, I am not worried about the opinions of a stranger on Twitter about my intellect. 		I educate myself. I read. I can't spell. I am fluent in math. Extremely good with numbers. And business.
@yolandavassallo @C_Riley52 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Yeah, you can't think like that with these people. They have some sort of block when it comes to listening to opposing views to theirs. Regardless of facts or truths. Just, blocked. Like here on Twitter!
@DyangoB People who can't spell...aren't stupid. Just don't care if their spelling is correct or not. 		Create a company then come call me stupid. 		https://t.co/Rea1aTbmwy
@Flavian0Jr No it won't. Because you ain't man enough to come here and talk about things face to face. Just remember. I'll make time for you. Just message me and I will be waiting at the airport for you. Cincinnati, Ohio. Air port is less than an hour away from me.
@Flavian0Jr Hell, probably both scared to come here and lying about your occupation. But hey, all lawyers get the supreme court confused with supreme law. You know. Day one information.
@Flavian0Jr Perhaps a little sacred you might not know as much as you claim. He'll, based on your comment of the supreme court being supreme law, I'd go as far that you're not a lawyer. Just a troll with nothing better to do than lie about being a lawyer and argue.
@Flavian0Jr You'll find out as soon as you touch down. Or are you as full of shit right now like you are on the other feeds?
@Flavian0Jr Got that ticket yet bud? Got to put you in my schedule.
@Flavian0Jr Cincinnati. I'll pick you up from the airport. Just give me a time.
@Flavian0Jr Both successful. And you are crossing a lot of ethical lines bud. Come to Ohio, say this shit to my face. I would be more than happy to walk you through those cases, page for page. Maybe you'd learn a thing or two. Otherwise you can troll away but leave my children out of things.
@willedwards554 @DOPEITSAL I sure can. Ask my opinion on something.
@Flavian0Jr Wow. Telling me to shut up in a rude manner. Claiming you're educating me. Trolling my page. 		You seem like a possible bot. Or just a dick that thinks to highly of himself and his fallacies. I don't need your misinformation to be educated. I already have credible sources.
@Flavian0Jr I am entitled to facts that are truthful. The only kind I deal in. 		Also, why are you still here? Thought you blocked me? Or do yoh troll for a hobby?
I have to to the conclusion that there will never be a sane, calm discussion between a liberal and a conservative. Liberals are to hate filled to think rationally.
What is the point of the block threat? Because you don't want to hear opposing views that disagree with you based on truth and fact...? Ok, block away.
@Nellie_Sully What, sarcasm? Interesting it is used by others who want me to value their opinions...? Just feeding you your own medicine.

If your only purpose is to belittle people and call them stupid for minor errors in their grammar. Then, perhaps it is time to ponder you personal ethos.
@Amaretat @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Block away honey, also. Practice kindness sometime. At 54 you'd think that someone would have realized kindness is the better form of communication.
I am not a Christian. But I am a believer in God. I have seen his love. I fail still to see the love that people express they have though. In one breath, they love and the next, fiery hatred spews from the lips. 		We are the issue, and that will never change. Sad.
@Adam1288 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Easy buddy, you saying something factual. Facts are like blood in the water for these sharks.
@BrennaSimonSays @Amaretat @TomiLahren Didn't assume anything rude. Just said that's impressive because only a handful of people can do that. It was a compliment.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren Because I have other people doing things for me. That's called being the owner lol. I get plenty of time.
@BrennaSimonSays @Amaretat @TomiLahren I don't need a safe place. I said I'm will to stand up to your bullish behavior and defend others from your attacks. I have all day.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren Also, plenty of people believe in him. Just because you don't. Doesn't mean others can't. Nor that they can't defend him.
@Amaretat Mostly because your response are hilarious.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren I own two companies. So, I guess I have two jobs?
@BrennaSimonSays @Amaretat @TomiLahren Latin!? Wow, impressive. Not any people can do that. Just because you read it doesn't mean you know what your talking about. I spent four years trying to become a pastor. But left because of people. All I see is hatred. Like from you, even with in the church.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren Again, I have never once expressed that I am religious. In any manner. So, keep on calling him my god.
@BrennaSimonSays @Amaretat @TomiLahren I always have time to stand up against a bully.
@BrennaSimonSays @Amaretat @TomiLahren Look. You clearly are unaware of the bible. And I don't have enough characters nor time to talk to you about on this page. If you want to. Message me, I'd more than happy to defend Christians against your attacks on them for thinking differently.
@Amaretat I was bored a long time ago.
@Amaretat @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Ha. Go ahead prove me wrong kiddo. I'll wait.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren Affording the opportunity for people to now ask for forgiveness and be reunited to God through our physical death.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren Was that sin would now be hereditary, passed down through generations from man to his seed. Because of this, God distances himself from the world because he cannot be near sin. But by his grace gave us reconciliation through his son.
@BrennaSimonSays @efi2nr @TomiLahren Do you have time to get theological? Because, from the Christian view point it is because sin and suffering entered the world as a direct result of disobedience to God by Adam and Eve. (NOT saying I believe in that.) The post effect of their disobedience...
@Amaretat Bold to call me clueless. Is that because I simply disagree with You? Or do you actually know me intimately and can confidently say that based on a daily interaction for the last 20 years?
@Amaretat @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Then don't take anything from. By the way. Laws against stealing and murder are based on the ten commandments from the bible...Just saying. So I guess Thanks? For making it clear it is wrong to murder and steal bible.
@efi2nr @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Man, I know you're just expressing your views. That's fine. But I don't think you should talk about a religion you're clearly confused about.
@Amaretat Wow. You're rude.
@rkirkpatrick01 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I can't help that a judge appointed by Obama ruled against the constitution. Some people just like twisting laws to fit their views and opinions.
@rkirkpatrick01 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren That's the process of the mind of a Christian based on their bible. 		For purposes of this conversation. Understand I am not Christian and I stand that if you are not a legal citizen you aren't protected by constitutional law. Which, is true.
@rkirkpatrick01 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Illegal aliens have human rights. Yes. But when it comes to law. Which the bible says to submit to authority and obey them as laws given by God himself. If our laws say you must follow procedure and you don't. You are by extension disobeying God.
@efi2nr @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren That worthless distraction gives people comfort bud. Maybe don't put them down for it. Many people are relying on God this very moment to get them through hardship. Putting it down just makes you an ass hole.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren No, I have plenty to say. Just choosing not to. Like I said. At a point you must realize when you can rationalize with someone.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I have a concealed carry that allows me to buy anywhere in the US. Passed many rigorous background checks and two classes to get one. Only two states don't allow me to purchase based on state law.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren You can legally purchase grenades if you apply through the proper channels.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren You don't have a right to tell what I need and don't need. So you're right. This is pointless.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Well, based on your response I can tell you know hardly a thing beyond what you're told to believe. I am a legal gun owner and know how the system works. So, I know that you're wrong about the ease of which they are bought.
@GeraldGoatrael @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I am not having a hard time understanding that. It would seem that you are having a hard time understanding that if you restrict their values you should restrict your own. 		Everyone has beliefs that influence their politics. You can't restrict one over the other.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren And may I suggest that if you're going to argue someone doesn't know something. Use more than Google as a resource.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren No one is whining. We are standing up for our right to own property.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Have you ever bought a gun? Do you know what people go through to get one? What about being a gun dealer? Do you know how they can determine at the pos if they want to continue transaction? How much do you actually know?
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I am very aware of the laws and their differences. So, not sure about your point.
@mitchellamunoz @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Oh. Yeah. Vetting a source is a thing of the past. Someone tried to push "read it" off as fact to the other day. I mean, just sad how gullible people are.
@DOPEITSAL Aww Thanks! You're to kind for retweeting me and showing your sympathy! Or is it empathy? I always get those confused. 		You have holes in your pants by the way.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren But hey, take my guns away and give the government and criminals the advantage over me as a follower of our laws. Leaving me defenseless. Thus taking away my right to life, liberty and property.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren And gang members commuting acts of violence that are taking lives as well. Don't forget fast-food and unhealthy eating that kills too.		If we want life then we must come together and decide on values we can all live by. That promote obedience and selflessness.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren And before you argue about those dead and their right to life. Remember, it isn't only the man behind the AR that is taking life. But those who drink irresponsibly, sell drugs that are lethal, and use blunt force objects, poison, knives, pistols, Long guns (bolt action)...
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Those systems shoot 308 and 762x39. More powerful rounds than the 556. 		You're logic doesn't stop murder. Just infringes on the freedoms of law abiding citizens to the pursuit of life, liberty and property.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren All you're doing at this point is restricting my right to own property. 		Rules about bumostocks and other mods I understand. Take away the AR system and you still have...AK systems, SCAR systems and others that are automatics.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Also, making guns harder to buy legally doesn't stop illegal sales of guns. Dunk driving is illegal...people still drink and drive. Heroine is illegal, people still buy heroine and die from it. People hellbent on commuting murder will commit murder no matter how many laws.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Same goes for your logic. Why make it harder on someone who obeys laws to buy something they want (life, liberty and property) guns are property. You can not make a law infringing on those rights in any manner.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Ha I can't argue stupid. So I'll just let you think what you want in regards to this.
@cokenoice_ @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Laws won't stop gun violence. If it does, I am sure we will all eat out words. But unfortunately current circumstances prove that people don't want to obey our laws and have a lack of respect for authority. Therefore, concluding that more laws won't solve gun violence.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren It's how it is according to written law bud. But ok. You're right I am wrong.
@BLitzedmon @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I read my news and I am not a Christian....So, yeah. There is that bit of information.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren There is a huge difference in human vs constitutional. 		One must be a citizen to be under the protection of any constitution for any government. 		That is how it was and is truly meant to be.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren The constitution is an agreement that we as the persons agree to follow the laws of this country in order to remain under the protection of those laws. 		If an illegal immigrant comes to America. They have human rights that are protected. Not constitutional rights.
@icyblue57 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Guantanamo is a Naval base. Meaning it is under the jurisdiction of American law. The prison is a military prison subject to military law. Which is the same as ours with a few add ons bud.
@FrancesRauer @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren It‚Äôs to early the argue with you and I have business to take care of. So I am just going to say...you‚Äôre right. White men suck and have done nothing good, ever.  Good day.
Misinterpreting the constitution to fit your opinion...is why we have a country in decline of moral and values.		We must rewrite them and make them more clear for these people who don't understand black and white.
@ThankYouBob44 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren That includes white immigrants...Thanks. No one wants a white America who is a decent person.
@ThankYouBob44 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Illegal immigrants involved in gangs here in America are responsible for 1000's of deaths. So...yeah.
@Plasticdoe @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Ever heard of the Sinaloa Cartel, Mexican Mafia, Mara Salvatrucha. That last one is responsible for over 8000 deaths on American soil...most members of those gangs are illegal immigrants.
@Plasticdoe @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Actually, I picked murder and illegals purposely...Just like your sarcasm is insinuating I did. Good eye.
I can't do it anymore. It's impossible to have an opinion in this country as a white, male Republican.
@Spacenoidx @Chloe11419752 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Thanks. Auto correct can sometimes get you when you least expect it to.
@Spacenoidx @Chloe11419752 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I enjoy reading and I will always accept the suggestion of a new book and will always give it a shot. It's how come I am educated. 		You're rudeness was unnecessary.
@Spacenoidx @Chloe11419752 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Funny, already have every sample and starting to read them to see if it enjoy the books. https://t.co/4Tih0rYaHX
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren Whatever man. I'm 27 and own two companies. I'll stick with whay I have learned and how I am using my education to succeed. Clearly more success than you. 		So, apparently I am doing something more right than you are. That's all for now, good luck to you too.
@Chloe11419752 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I will! Thanks! I love reading. So this is awesome to see shared. Thanks again!
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren That doesn't make the supreme court the supreme law, which is what you said originally. And by your statement I can assume you're young meaning maybe you should listen to someone with some life on you who is successful.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren 27, not sure why you need to know my age. By the way, I'm 27 and already own two companies of my own. That I built from the ground up to where they are now...but continue this thought. I'm intrigued by how much you know.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren You're telling me to educate myself when you literally just called the supreme court the supreme law...when the constitution is the supreme law of our land. And you're a lawyer apparently.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren They are the highest court of appeal. Or highest court of the hierarchy within the judicial system. HUGE difference to supreme law which is the constitution.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren Already has. As a lawyer you should the supreme court isn't the supreme law...So I am now wondering if you actually are a lawyer.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren So, there is that.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren No, you think you know more than me because we disagree on the format in which one should read and interpret law. I read it as black and white. You read it as if you can make it fit your opinion.
@therealdennisr @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Please tell me you're trying to be funny.
@bertrand_polly @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Someone else who understands! I was starting to worry I was the only one!
@ttlaurent @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Finally, someone who gets it. I thought I was just going to get ganged up on by a bunch of people.
@Flavian0Jr @TomiLahren I don't need advice from you on what to read friend. You have no idea what my background is or what I do daily and what that involves. So, don't assume you know anything about me brother.
@joewritesbooks @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I do. It means no one religion will rule the government. Doesn't mean someone can't be guided by religious values though and express them.
@insightUAE @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren No, I think it could have been prevented in other ways. I personally, am not a Christian. But I'm sure if someone feels prayer comforts them or belief in God means something to them you don't quite understand. You don't have to be rude about it.
@orecule @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren True treason. That it is against the law.
@Korymbus @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren So basically you're saying they purposely put a semi colon there...said persons (Instead of illegal immigrants) because they wanted us as a country to interpret law how we saw fit..? 		Instead of just out right saying...immigrants who are illegal.
Well, your Twitter feed is proof of the ignorance of the left and their lack of respect for others. While simultaneously demanding we respect them and their way of thinking. Honestly, the stupidity is no long laughable, but concerning. @TomiLahren
@Chloe11419752 @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Oh thanks. A meme was exactly what I needed to believe that I am wrong lol.
@Flavian0Jr @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Like I said. I read 3 a month. And that still doesn't prove a thing. There is nothing in the constitution directly protecting illegal immigrants. Read it yourself to find out.
@Korymbus @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren The very first sentence clarifies why you're wrong. "All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens..." meaning your wrongly interpreted section can not be used to protect someone not born of or naturalized in the US.
@Flavian0Jr @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Show me where in the constitution is says illegal immigrants have legal protection under our laws.
@BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren They are relevant to others. That's all there is to it. You can't tell them they can't use them in public. That's unconstitutional. Also, just finished your article from the hill. Misinterpreting the 14th amendment isn't proof illegal aliens have constitutional rights.
@BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I can say the same thing about your views both spiritual and otherwise.
@BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren You added a lot to that quote. Just saying. 		Also, if you're values are dictated by science and logic but not religion or spirituality...that doesn't mean that others base theirs on religion. You can tell then they have no right to do so. You're contradicting yourself.
@Flavian0Jr @BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I read 3 a month. And all people have human rights. Citizens have legal rights under constitutional law. If you're a lawyer you should know the difference.
@BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren I mean the dumb in what you said is insulting. 		Everyone has the right to believe what they want and to project it into what they want. Including Christians.
@BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren Did You? Religious people are allowed to let their views dictate how they see politics. And immigrants do have rights. Illegal ones don't. 		Also, your dictating that your values will solve issues because you personally believe them. So don't make stupid statements like this one.
@milton_zakaria @AnnoyinglyYours @TomiLahren Ha they don't know what they are arguing. Just trying to get a rise out of you. 		God, no God. We need more values. Values the majority agrees on.
@BrennaSimonSays @TomiLahren True. And one of those laws says that a religious person can say we need more God is she wants to. Also, that you can't do things illegally in this country. Like live here undocumented. Or commit murder. Or...I think you get the point.
@TomiLahren Maybe not God specifically but more people willing to live decent moral lives. Valuing things like family, love and honor. Men willing to be there for his family, women loving their children...children willing to respect authority. SPANKING! lol

@TonyRAnderson @dannytas185 @scrowder So you have never bought a gun? You don't know what they check for, what's on the application form, nor how purchase of guns online actually work? But can confidently tell me how easy it is with a wiki link? 		Gotcha.
@TonyRAnderson @dannytas185 @scrowder How about this. If it is so easy to buy a gun...go to Buy one and send me the picture of how easy it was.
@TonyRAnderson @dannytas185 @scrowder Actually it would be easier to buy supplies to make a bomb, make it and use than buy a gun. Buying a gun isn't that easy bud.
How many people died last year and the first part of this year...more than 17 and for more reasons than illegal use of a firearm...They are equally missed and their deaths are equally as tragic.
But this isn't a tragedy that our kids are to stupid to understand personal safety behind the wheel of a car...11 a day means 4,000 a year...not including drunk drivers, hit and runs, drugs and more...but that's not an issue worth talking about. https://t.co/hFULEtpDlP

@S3CURITYBR3ACH @JoyAnnReid That's an extremely skewed statement. But no one is arguing what happened is sad. Just that you all aren't as right as you think you are. Especially when it comes to guns and ownership of them.

@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid Allows me to say to my government that they will never over power me easily and to tell criminals they will never over take me or my family with out a fight. 		More good people own guns than bad.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid I can't tell you that killing will ever stop. Because evil men will always find a way to commit monstrosities against other people. 		But I can tell you that my right to own guns equally as powerful as the military...
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid They are not evil. The person is evil. 		Germans used guns to conquer. Americans used guns to stop the conqueror. 		Criminals use guns to murder. Good men use guns to stop the criminal from murdering.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid The way I use them is to practice my shooting for competition shooting and to be able and ready to defend my home, my family and my community if the time ever came for me to stand my ground in the protection of innocent lives. 		Guns are tools of defense in the right hands.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid Listen. I get it. You don't like them. But I understand my right to own them and I see their purpose. I choose to use mine for good and not evil. And millions others do too. 		I can't speak for people who break the law and use weapons for evil.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid Guns weren't specifically designed for murder, that's an extremely ignorant statement. 		Just like cars weren't designed to kill, but they do sometimes when someone behind the wheel is irresponsible and breaking the law.
RT @scrowder: Nobody in Europe gets to dictate American gun policies. That's why we left.
Just because someone disagrees with you. Doesn't make them racist or sexist or whatever. Just means they disagree with you.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid Have you ever been to a gun show? Or sold at a show? Or sold or bought a gun privately? Because there are laws in place, provided your a law abiding citizen, to ensure proper sales.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid But there are background checks at gun shows. Saying there is not is ignorant.
@chomsky64 @JoyAnnReid @NRA Laws can not guarantee 100% effectiveness. Name me one law that has 100% effective and I will stand down. 		My logic is that you cant restrict my freedom because of one person. 99.9% of legal gun owners obey all laws regarding guns to the best of their ability.
@polishqueen1989 @JoyAnnReid It depends on of you habe passed the already rigorous background check for a concealed carry or have a clean record and previous gun history. It isn't easy to buy guns like you think it is.
I have tried explaining it before. https://t.co/zkEJMTFdq3
We have been willing to let drunk drivers kill innocent lives for years with out making it harder to buy a car that can be used as a deadly weapon. But, when one gun owner of the 100's of thousands decides to break the law...the rest of us must pay the price.
@chomsky64 @JoyAnnReid @NRA If a good and honorable person with a gun was there, they could have confronted the shooter and saved many lives.
@chomsky64 @JoyAnnReid @NRA And I am willing to sacrifice my own life at any point and for anyone persons life. Never willing to sacrifice the lives of others. That is why I will always fight for my right to own a weapon capable of protecting others if the need is called for at any moment.
@chomsky64 @JoyAnnReid @NRA With out a gun that kid could have accomplished his ultimate goal any way he wanted to. He had no regard for the preciousness of life. He was corrupted by evil intentions...That's the issue here.
@chomsky64 @JoyAnnReid @NRA I have guns and have never killed a single living thing with any one of them. 		Everyone is special. And so are their rights to the freedoms given by our laws in this country. 		Guns aren't the issue. The issue is our lack of respect for life.
@chomsky64 @JoyAnnReid @NRA So you're willing to sacrifice the lives of those killed by drunk drivers to retain your right to drink? 		You're will to sacrifice the lives of construction workers killed in onsite accidents due to negligence to retain your right to commercial and residential structures?
Well, I mean. Yeah. https://t.co/OKk82FT1Z3
Looking to solve the drinking issues in America the government formed laws making the brewing and distribution of alcohol, illegal....look how that turned out. 		More laws won't fix the social issue that is our disregard for human life, morality and respect.
@JoyAnnReid You can't cancel a gun show and infringe on the rights of millions of law abiding citizens just because of one man's disobedience to the laws of this nation. 		Leave those of us who obey the laws alone, and focus on the criminals who cause these horrifying situations.
@JoyAnnReid @NRA So we are putting the NRA up against kids now? 		There is a real issue here and it is NOT the guns themselves. It IS the lack of discipline for our youth. Our disregard for morality. Our lack of respect for authority...		Leave my right to own a gun, alone. Teach kids respect.
Well, Democrats. You wanted whiny, misbehaving children to grow up into voters. Seems you got your wish. Kids have grown up and continue to with out discipline and now there is anarchy. All because we can't spank kids anymore.

@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump If you want to keep on. That's fine with me. You have done nothing to change my stance. Nor my freedom. 		I will always fight for my rights and the rights of others. Even yours. But this is my final word, so good day kid. Thank you for sharing your opinion.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump You want problems fixed? Start with the heart of the people in this country. Change how people behave and we wouldn't need to have this talk. 		If you want facts. I have given you them. And I made a comparison, that is a fair one to make.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump I have never used mine for any act of violence. And I would appreciate it if you didn't suggest what I enjoy (the one of many hobbies I enjoy) is something infringing on others freedom. Why? Because I am not persecuting anyone by doing what I enjoy.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Nick wanted to kill. The gun didn't kill. But the person using it did. He could have used a car or another form of weapon to achieve his goal. To kill. 		Guns don't kill, the people using them do
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump The second amendment says I can own whatever gun I want. And therefore. I own whatever gun I want. It is there so that I have the ability to defend what's mine. Which is "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," a phrase you just used out of context.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump I have encountered more than you know. Like I told you, you have no idea about anything in my life. The round I took was 556 fmj. So stop assuming you know me.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Second, the 17 kids had opinions you have no idea about. So leave them out of this. That is disrespectful to their memory. To use them as an argument is crass. So just stop.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Alright, first. My right to own military grade weapons is in place because the forefathers wanted the government to fear its people. When your government has technology better than yours, you are unable to fight back in times of tyranny.
Thanks @BarackObama, your stupid health bill might cost me $1000.00 for not being able to afford private health insurance because my employer wouldn't pay for it. 		Just thanks.

@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Again, why do you assume that I don't care about the freedom of others. I care enough to sign up for the Military.

@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump My guns are all locked away. It is called gun safety. I follow a strict code when it comes to the use of my guns.

@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Also, this punk signed up. Unfortunately, I broke the law. And I would gladly sign up again if I weren't permanently disqualified. So that was just unnecessary to say friend.

@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump And it is scored at 305-350 to be an expert in the military. You don‚Äôt shoot 80 for 80. You‚Äôre not scored at 80 hits but at accuracy and precision. Anyone can hit a target 80 times. But can you hit 80 times accurately and precisely? That‚Äôs what is scored.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump I‚Äôm a competition shooter. And also volunteered marine corps. Only reason I couldn‚Äôt go, got arrested right before boot camp for underaged. 		If you want to just throw insults and talk qualifications. I‚Äôm not going to talk with you. That‚Äôs a poor way to communicate.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Oh, also cars can be labeled as a deadly weapon. All CDL vehicles are classified as weapons based on there size and if you aren‚Äôt licensed to operate one you‚Äôre charged with attempted murder for operating it on roads with pedestrian transportation.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump You quote the Declaration of Independence yet don‚Äôt understand the sheer basics of it.

@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump One day you will need a rifle. Possibly an M4 system. When that day comes, your opinion may change from hating something you don‚Äôt fully understand.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump I think you have a narrow view point here. You should understand the simple fact that people aren‚Äôt good by nature. And taking away from good people only feeds the ability of the bad.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Could have ran them over, used blunt force objects, potentially poisoned even more. 		For you, the slow one. People who intend to do evil will always find a way to commit the crime. Don‚Äôt restrict my freedom because of a few people.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Deaths. 		Which is really sad and a horrible way to look at things. I own guns and it never crosses my mind to use them for evil. 		It is the person. Not the gun that cause death and destruction. Just like in the case of vehicular manslaughter.
@Gadge3663 @Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump You should look up what defines a deadly weapon. Cars can be labeled a weapon when used to assult someone or operated by someone intoxicated who hits a pedestrian. 		Also, I can only assume since you consider it not a weapon. That you don't value those deaths like you value gun..
@WocktheMeek @RealCandaceO Current statistics show an increase of gun violence in countries with stricter gun laws. So...I'm not sure where your going with that.
@Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Leaving the responsibility in the hands of the owner. Letting him decide responsible operation of his equipment. 		Making guns illegal won't stop killing in American. A change in the heart of people will make the difference.
@Crypto_Village @realDonaldTrump Every day 28 people are killed by drunk drivers. In 2015, just 10,000 people were killed by people impaired while driving? Of those deaths, 1,500 were kids.  		Should this make cars illegal and no one own them? Or should drunk driving remain illegal?

@BernardCrawmer Whinning? Or bringing attention to. 		How do you know I am racist? Or is that merely an assumption by you because I support the president? Because, calling someone racist publicly is a strong accusation when you don't know them personally. Or are you to stupid to know that?

@AlienDimeBag Consider this. In a public forum where personally opinion is accepted with restrictions. You are then limiting voice on the premise of bias. Bias to a particular ideology, political party, leader etc...It is unacceptable. And should outrage everyone.

I officially do not care what I say anymore. If someone can say, "hold their heads under water until death." About conservatives...		I can say whatever the hell I want about anyone I want now.
@Green_Footballs @barry An obvious joke!? Followed by "I'm not joking." 		What if someone had said, "i think if we held all the illegals heads under water until they stopped breathing. That should fix things." 		"Not joking." 		Well, there would be uproar. You're the obvious joke.
@barry @BronzeHammer Ok, coward, where do you hide a black man's keys? 		His work boots! HAHAHA get it? Because black men don't have jobs! 		Obviously a joke, but...I bet , I am a racist for posting it. 		A post about drowning people for their politics..Well, that's murder..which is illegal.
Passing the budget should have nothing to do with illegal immigrants. That bill is about spending our taxes to support the American people. Not those here illegally.
@CNNPolitics Ha, reading the responses on here is the most entertaining thing I could do. 		Hypocritically calling someone a hypocrite and yelling he is a bigot in a bigoted manner. I mean it is just hilarious. 		But hey, all of you are better people than he is. It‚Äôs fine.

@AlienDimeBag That divide is fueled by the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù mentality. 		If you truly believe it is someone else‚Äôs fault that you aren‚Äôt better off...then naturally you will be at odds. Regardless of the true feelings of the other party.
@AlienDimeBag It is a tactic that should be uncovered and presented to people. So they realize they are not a victim. But an individual with the capability to redesign their life. But they have to take ownership and stop pushing blame on others.
@AlienDimeBag Having decent values and portraying them are two different things. 		From my research and from my experience. I noticed the true nature of the machine. Democratic leaders only want power. And they follow the largest demographics they can group, victimize and then rally.
@CNNPolitics Suddenly? Hmmm, I‚Äôm pretty confident in my fellow Americans to stop listening to your malarkey and to start supporting the party that truly wants to see the individual succeed. 		Or did you drink the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a victim‚Äù fruit punch?

You want to know what is sad? 		How short the leash is that Democrats have around their constituents necks. (Sound like slavery?) they control you by labeling you in a group and then victimizing you. 		Don‚Äôt fall prey to their vicious tactic. You‚Äôre not coming out on top.

@AlienDimeBag That is probably the better route. Truthfully, the original movement was a truly good thing. Yes, there are people taking it to far. But everyone takes everything to far. They would rather blame others for their failures than to take ownership.
@AlienDimeBag Calling it a mental illness is going to far.
@AlienDimeBag Hatred isn‚Äôt a mental illness. 		You‚Äôre going to far with making it seem that way.
@AlienDimeBag Feminism isn‚Äôt a mental illness. It is an ideology. It is the thought that women are not equal to men. And the fight to gain the equality that is not there.
@AlienDimeBag I am sorry but the way you are asking this is...not clear. 		Are you saying that feminism is a form of imprisonment? Mentally? As in a form of mental illness? I mean, not trying to be rude but your wording is not clear.
Looks like the text messages are coming out. That is a good thing. 		Let the people know how deep the corruption goes!

I just don't have time for someone who has no intention of seeing my point of view and only wants to point out that my opinion is racist. When I do not believe in a superior race.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You obviously are obtuse. So why should I try to explain anything? Good luck in life bud.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I'm no hypocrite. I am merely tired of you thinking so highly of yourself.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Have you ever seen This? Have you met a man with no arms? His only crime being from the wrong village?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I have been to Africa for humanitarian relief. I have witnessed first hand the horrors of true oppression. Of real racism. Of genocide. Of hunger. Thirst. I have seen a woman. Terrified of men because she spent her entire childhood raped, every day.
If you think that you're oppressed. Think again. 		Trust me, you're not. You're just soft. Sensitive. Or whatever. You're not oppressed.
@EfobiEric @Frialish @TomiLahren Yeah, then you have no idea then? Why protest by kneeling and showing disrespect to the one thing that stands for what you claim to be fighting? 		I‚Äôm over it. Go to Africa, see true oppression first hand then come talk to me.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I doubt you have been mistreated beyond that of someone just disagreeing with your pampered, misguided since of what? Mistreatment? How have you been oppressed? Huh? Has your arm been cut off? You sister raped? Entire family hacked to death? Go ahead.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump But it was inspiring because he wanted his own country to change. And saw America as a beacon of light. 		Have you ever been there? Seen the mangled bodies? The dead? The raped? The horror?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He said, ‚Äúone day my people will be like you. One day my people will rise up like the America‚Äôs did and fight opression. One day, my friend. One day, we will be free from fear.‚Äù Now that‚Äôs as best I can remember.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Need to be educated to be more like you. 		When I was in Africa. The most inspiring thing I was told was from a kid with his arm that had been cut off. You want to know what he said?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Listen to someone else for a change. Understand that you aren‚Äôt as smart as you think you are. Pampered by people telling you. ‚ÄúYou should never be offended. And if it offends. It is racist. Sexist. Fascist.‚Äù That people who disagree.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I have been to Africa to make improvements to a village. On my own time and my own dime. I have seen war torn communities and I have witnessed true oppression. I don‚Äôt have time for someone ignorant and self righteous. 		Come back to me when you have one iota or understanding.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Probably not. Don‚Äôt insult me and define terms I know the definition of. Don‚Äôt insult me and act like your opinion is better than mine.

@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Couldn‚Äôt that money be used to advance our people here. Those who already have established citizenship and family names? What is wrong with that way of thinking? Why does that make him racist?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I would rather there immigration be limited. Not because I hate them, but because our government with my tax dollar shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for paying their way. Currently 137 billion dollars annually is being bled by the public for illegals in this country.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump All of which should be addressed by their people. Standing up against tyranny. Stoping the corruption infesting their lands. 		Does it make me racist to say that until they learn to fend for themselves and create structured environments for their citizens..
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Africa also, is plagued by a lack of education. War torn in many of its nations and dominated by war lords that use children to wipe out entire tribes and families. Rape, drug trade and illegal arms are infesting their countries.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump My views are for the care and advancement of all Americans. Like @POTUS is currently trying to demonstrate. 		I think Africa is a country that is under devolved, lacking many social structures that have advanced the west and Europe.
So apparently, women can do NO wrong. They don't kill, they don't commit crimes and are the smarter gender. 		Men, thus, are the problem. Women are the cure. 		I love my woman. More than anything. And she loves how manly I am. Let's just stop with the horse shit.

@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So you blindly think and then blindly follow. Under the impression that your a free, intelligent thinker...when the left has you by the balls. You don't even know how many amendments there are. You only shout what you're told to shout.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump And finally. You have called the president racist. You don't know the man. At all. He has expressed how he wants people to immigrate legally and is alleged to call a country a shit hole. Those aren't racist feelings or statements. But because the media, left, has told you think.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump People, unless specifically mentioned, means everyone. Not just whites. And fuck anyone who thinks differently. And fuck anyone who perpetuates racism on either side of the parties. Either by making race issues where none lie or being racist.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thanks for generalizing me, my fiance, my family and hers as racists that are e	NOT educated and fueled by hate. 		Have you every considered that when some says they do something for love of country. That love of country includes..land and people.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Be weary of the policy and party you support. Your millionaire, leftist leaders only want power. They do not care about the American individual. They only care about the grouped, labeled, race, anything they can use to limit ones freedom. But do what you want.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So please educate yourself. 		Know that grouping is a method of the left designed to limit the individual. They want you to think you are intelligent for believing what they want you to. This allows them to have power and maintain it with little opposition.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Also, if you racism is only a white thing. Then your view is skewed and beyond that of help. 		Frankly, I agree that people need to make decisions based on information from educating themselves. That's a true statement.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Your view is skewed and of the 27 amendments, yes. I am aware of each one. Not perfectly. But I can give the gist on a short notice with out picking my book with them written down. 		Just so you know. @POTUS isn't racist. And those who support aren't racist for supporting him.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren But seriously. I'm done. I have to be up at 4 to travel for work. So, anything more you got. I have no time for. Anyway, why talk to me? By extension I am racist!
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren I do. And I know that I support @POTUS and I voted for him. So I am done with this conversation. Go learn your rights. And the rights of others. 		Also, you aren't an idealist. Call it @realDonaldTrump a racist and those by extension a racist. Is perpetuating the issue.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren No you didn't. You know what you're doing. 		I know why they are protesting. I know why I am against it. You got your opinion and I have mine. Let's leave it there bud.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS44 Ok. So you are calling me and everyone else who supports @POTUS and protests the NFL racist? 		Yes people disliked him. 		Yes you're calling me and many racist. Thus, censoring our right to disagree. You're a piece of work bud. Also, infringing our right to dislike. Generalizing.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren It's a yes or a no.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren Ok you've made your point. I still want my answer. 		Are you calling me hate fueled. Are you calling all who protest the NFL for their disrespect to the flag, hate fueled?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren No, I can speak on it because I read it. I take the time to know my rights and when they are infringed upon. 		Answer my question.  Are you calling me hate fueled because I disagree with the protest?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS Back to your other comment. Are you accusing me of being fueled by hate?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren So you‚Äôre now suggesting that I am fueled by hate?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren @POTUS44 divided the nation terribly! Where were you? His actions led this country to being completely divided.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren Not at all. People were upset about this long before @POTUS. 		Nothing was hijacked. People disagreed from the beginning.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren Ok. Like I said. I am a citizen who says. ‚ÄúNo, you shouldn‚Äôt protest the flag. And I choose to not show you support to protest against the disrespect.‚Äù Are you going to censor my opinion or let me have them? Because, protesting a protest is now...censorship.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren Also, I just don‚Äôt like when someone shouts AMENDMENTS! But then says ‚ÄúI would have to read them to agree with them.‚Äù Meaning, you might not agree to them all. 		That just doesn‚Äôt sit well with me bud.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren If you we are talking censorship. Then we would have to bring up the fact that outrage is a form of protest and to tell me I can‚Äôt have a negative opinion against the NFL protests is...censorship. So, am I allowed to continue being outspoken or no?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren Also, I‚Äôm curious. You bring up the Amendments. 		Do you believe in every single amendment to the constitution? Yes...no?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren No one is saying you can‚Äôt protest. We are simply saying protest in the right place. At the right time. And protest so people come together. Don‚Äôt protest to bring division.
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren The protests have divided the nation. Not brought it together. Martin Luther marched for unity of all. Equality. 		But the protests against the flag have not done anything more than create animosity. So, why protest then?
@iTearorByte @Frialish @TomiLahren No, I am saying there is a time and place. And the time and place is not on the field of sports. 		Sports have been a huge part of bringing people together in sportsmanship and even at odds for friendly competition. They were a for unity. Putting difference aside. Not separation
@coachvelasco11 @Frialish @M08D26 @TomiLahren Actually, seem like you are saying it‚Äôs me. But that is fine. My opinion is mine. And I‚Äôll share it. And it is that they should leave it off the field. Stand, show the respect due, play the game. 		Protest off the field. Support your community by building it up, not separating it
@coachvelasco11 @Frialish @M08D26 @TomiLahren Ok. I'm not arrogant either. But I believe you should stand for your nations flag. Now what do you want to talk about?
@freshprince115 @Frialish @TomiLahren Dude. Just cause I don't want to take the time list the NFL players who do and don't do for their communities doesn't mean that I haven't already said that they do for their communities. I am saying I don't agree with the protest. And they should just do for their community.
@freshprince115 @Frialish @TomiLahren I don't think you followed my post. So it truly doesn't deserve a response. But...		I am saying...go...stand for the anthem...Play game...then go to community and help with out disrespecting the flag and what it stands for. Which is yours and everyone's freedom.
@PeteNicholls2 @Frialish @M08D26 @TomiLahren Chill fam.
@Frialish @TomiLahren Yeah, I won't discuss the issues since I have an opinion that is not accepted and this is the first calm talk I have had on Twitter in a while lol. But! Personally, I think play football and leave politics and protest off the field, so sports aren't divided.
@Frialish @M08D26 @TomiLahren Yeah, the rule was changed probably due to the fact they were protesting in this fashion and the NFL would have had a riot on their hands if they fined the players. It's all political.
Today we will see if the NFL will show some respect to our nation. Protesting has its place. The football field is not that place. 		Leave the politics at home. Play some damn football and stand proud for the flag that allows you to play. 		#StandForTheAnthem 	#StandForTheFlag
@Frialish @TomiLahren That's all I got really and it's my opinion. Not fact. But I like think my opinion is better than others lol. (That's a joke for the most part)
@Frialish @TomiLahren They need to play football and then go into their communities with their millions and make an actual difference by starting college funds, cleaning up the neighborhoods and feeding those in need. Not fighting a flag that stands for freedom.
@Frialish @TomiLahren Reading your comments you seem like a nice person. But don't be naive about life. Sure they have a right to protest. But we also have a right to be mad that they are protesting the flag. It is wrong. It is disrespect. And it's politics where politics do not belong.
@Frialish @M08D26 @TomiLahren They actually have rules that the team will stand for the anthem before the game starts. Since that guy didn't want to answer. But those rules haven't been enforced in years because it was really never an issue.

@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS Guess I could have used...delayed, hindering, or impeded. Synonyms to the word retard. Which means to slow or hold progress or acceleration. But man, you went stray for the insulting adjective form of the word.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS It's day one vocab.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS Probably both. By my assessment of the conversation.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS Woah, now that's the "offensive" use of the word retarded in its slang form. I was simply using it and its original meaning of slow or to slow something. NOT how you just did. Wow. Insensitive much? Or just uneducated.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS Fully aware of limited government. Again. You have slowed, or retarded, the conversation. Making it impossible to reason with you. Good day madam.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS You are being retarded, slowing the progression of this whole conversation! I am perplexed by the inability you have at understanding basic government. Do us a favor and stop contributing to society. We might get something done.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS There will not a be a dictatorship under the rule of the Republican party. The party that stands for limited government involvement from all branches. With national security, infrastructure and economy their main platforms they stand for. All based on constitutional law.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS I believe totally in the rule of law and I am not an authoritarian. I am a constitutionalist. And all I see is executive power being used in an appropriate manner. Just you don't like him. So you say whatever you want with out supporting fact.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS A dictator through control by absolute power, shuts down opposition by eliminating the individual or group. They have total military control. Using fear and force. How is @POTUS a wannabe dictator? Example 2
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS First, dictators display absolute power. Either individually or by a small group. @POTUS rhetoric is that he wants to see the American people strong once more. How is that a wannabe dictator? Example one.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS If You were 12 when a dictator died...that means you should be able to tell the difference. Also, I have studied different forms of government. So...no personal experience. Just good ole democracy for me. Like it is now.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS Seriously, calling someone a dictator or accusing him of behaving like one because you dislike his policy changes, is unbelievably childish. 		There is zero evidence to support such a claim. Just personal opinion based on inncorect information and misunderstanding of how it works
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS If the FBI isn't operating with in its parameters, the @POTUS is right to make changes and or call them out for legitimate reasons like he has. 		That's just called leadership.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 @POTUS So calling out corruption and speaking out against lies....is now considered behavior that a dictator would Have? 		What? Do you know what a dictator is? What they do? How they gained power? And maintain power? Did you go to school? Ever?

@BLinderLaw I have stated my belief. A lot! You're the one who could answer a simple question. So let's not pretend anything here.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 Easy. You are.
Debating a lib is like talking to a barn wall. You get no where fast.
@Nuria_amb_seny @krassenstein @shellyyk1977 I guess you aren't seeing the same news sources I am. So. Why waste time, let's just agree to disagree with out going any further, yeah?
@BLinderLaw @GOP This is obviously going no where. Your false information vs my true information. And I'm sure you disagree with that. So. I am going back to work.
@BLinderLaw @GOP Have you not seen anything of recent? It has been proven the dossier was fabricated with minimal truth. Only one section as of yet has been proven to have any truth to it thus far!
@BLinderLaw Ok. Highlight the question. Again, A claim. NOT a question.
@BLinderLaw Proof? Because that is a, OH what do you call It, false pretense? Or some thing of that sorts.
@BLinderLaw You didn't ask a question. You stated a remark held as fact. But I need proof of that before I can agree with you. So..present it or don't.
@BLinderLaw @GOP You claim...the dossier is truth, that the warrants were filled for and obtain legally. When the proof is that it was not. 		The memo being the primary proof we are seeking to have released. Today!
@BLinderLaw The FISA warrants were obtained by lying to a federal court. A federal crime called, perjury. We can also claim obstruction of justice. Both penalties punishable by law.
@BLinderLaw I need time to compile the long list of proof. Maybe pay more attention to current affairs.
@BLinderLaw Need proof on that claim.
How far does the corruption go? How far is someone willing to go to maintain power!? 		I don't know. Let's ask @HillaryClinton is she knows!!
@BLinderLaw I only understand things spoken as if I were from the age of Neanderthals.  I missed the boat for homo erectus and sapiens where wisdom/enlightenment began to form in human evolution.
@BLinderLaw Oh, also I didn't know we were using words the others could understand. 		DEMS are LYING to YOU. UNDERSTAND? 	Maybe time you be more smarter...		Like dumb, dumb Republican are smarter. Yes?
#ReleaseTheMemo or just admit your guilt. The #people are tired of waiting for some truth!
@BLinderLaw But hey, you cry..."flase equivalent" at everything I say. When in turn. I have said more simply. You have false information that is currently under the microscope and about to be proved wrong. 		Or I may eat my words because the @GOP is stupid. Releasing evidence to prove guilt.
@BLinderLaw Ha. If you want evidence of censorship from the left. I'll need more time to send you all of that. 		And I am different. You're the same old lib that can't answer questions asked by someone disagreeing with you. 		Also, never cried Hillary! Just DNC!
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS Look it up if you must. But evidence is being sought after to prove the @GOP and it's candidate had nothing to do with Russian interference and that it was a false testimony used to lie to a judge and obtain fisa warrants.
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS I am. I have presented an argument. That you have no ability to answer. So, therefore, you are neglecting the conversation and considering it closed in your favor. Which! Means it is still open for discussion. If you can answer my question.
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS @DNC @realDonaldTrump You can't do it!? Wow, that's because the argument was flawed from the beginning. You have built an accusation that is today! being thwarted. If! The FBI cooperates with the @POTUS administration. So, sit down please.
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS @HillaryClinton My question. If you answer it. Would completely destroy any argument I could ever make. So answer it, please. Or don't. Because you can't.
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS @HillaryClinton I did. Are you going to answer my question or NOT?
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS This means that if you are correct. That @POTUS and our party are guilty of collusion, tampering or obstruction...then we are pushing hard to have evidence released that prove our own guilt...And if you are still with me...answer. Why would we do that? What would be gained?
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS If you are still following. Currently. Evidence is being demanded that would confirm that the representatives of the @DNC lied to a federal court to obtain warrants that allowed them to spy on @realDonaldTrump....Still there?
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein @POTUS If they aren't clear then you obviously are out of touch with something huge! 		You claimed Russian influence over voters. Which includes the decision to allow wire tapping of the opposing candidate to @HillaryClinton, the current @POTUS.

@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein Frankly, I was well informed before voting. And I made a good choice. Russian influence had nothing to do with it either. If you choose to believe everything the #Liberals sling at you in the form of shit. That's on you.
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein Sorry, but the Russian scandal hasn't been proven to influence anything. The only evidence so far could prove that the @DNC used false testimony to support illegally, warrants for spying on an opposing candidate. Or do your media sources neglect to teach you that?
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein Ridiculous is, the left's leadership that depends on an uneducated demographic willing to believe anything they are told as truth. People who will read on sentence, statement or watch a video, sound bite that is taken out of context and believe the false commentary.
@BLinderLaw @de_cambiar @krassenstein I guess you did miss it. Especially if you are not aware of political correctness.		Also, checks and balances works so that if two are in "cahoots" with one another. The third steps in to remind them the power belongs to the people. Which is exactly what @POTUS is doing.
@de_cambiar @krassenstein Ok, firstly. Censorship is happening today. And it is from the left. Lists of things you can and can‚Äôt say. So...there‚Äôs your first step. 		Second, our government was specifically designed to keep a dictator take over from happening. So, just stop.
@krassenstein @shellyyk1977 Dictator. You keep using that word. I don‚Äôt think means what you think it means. 		Our three branches are designed to specifically to protect the people from a dictator taking over. It is called, ‚Äúchecks and balances.‚Äù You big dope.

@AlienDimeBag Not shaming. Simply saying it should not be celebrated. And it shouldn't. 		We should teach our kids about healthy living. Being active. Nourishment that helps them grow strong and full of energy. 		Not unhealthy living that leads to deadly disease and health issues.
@AlienDimeBag You don't know my history with weight health. So don't assume. My comment isn't based on children being fat. But society now pushing that fat is acceptable. It shouldn't be that way. That simple.
@AlienDimeBag It isn't a social crime. It is unhealthy. Drug addicts, criminals and felons are not accepted socially. They are looked down on. Obesity is not something, like the above, that should be celebrated.

@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN @HillaryClinton It could and very well would be closer if it weren't for the party change this last year. 		Let's use PC as a prime example, restricting the public's freedom of speech and infringing on rights to opinion by stimulating fear for political views. All leftist.
@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN @HillaryClinton Alright before you go any further and I engage with you. List your sources bud. Everything you have sent me is a false representation of the facts. I would like to know where you get this crap?
@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN Frankly, before we go any further you can't take false information and project it as truth. Listening to things out of context is the fastest way to being misinformed. 		It seems you have fallen prey to this tactic by media sources. Which is the fake news he is seeking to change.
@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN Oh that is so ignorant to say. @POTUS is not racist and to use those examples is lazy. 		Also, look at the difference of the two leaders and why they are attacking news sources. Before you make those comments.
@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN I would have to disagree with you. National pride and patriotism can't be confused as fascism or else we are going down a slippery slope with no foreseeable end.
@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN I don't flipidely throw around any term...I Get my facts straight then make my statements.
@pakalamazoo @jmillermcp @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN Ahh good catch. I mean I could but it meant to say  Fascist not racist. 		But I can argue identifying ethnic heritage but using identifiers like African, Haitian or Muslim before American to describe our own CITIZENS born here is racist. Of course, I await the response to why not

@eshh85 @CodyCovfefe @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN @POTUS44 So I ask, what is wrong here? Why am I attacked because I see things differently?

@eshh85 @CodyCovfefe @AlienDimeBag @rob_libadia @geekyteacher1 @CNN @POTUS44 Accused of being racist. My intellectual capabilities are questioned and insulted. My freedom to speak is infringed on by the left. I am called a bigot in a bigoted manner.

@taramichelles @hannahkardon @Fireshadow540My @CNNPolitics Finally, to say that immigrants come and do better than our own natives proves my point.

@Rebel4WildLife @geekyteacher1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN Oh, so you‚Äôre the patron saint of derogatory people? Because, according to you, you have never generalized a people or group, you aren‚Äôt the president...so therefore you are better than the rest of us who will say it how it is?
@Unabogie @AlienDimeBag @CNN This isn‚Äôt saying all Haitians will be denied. Just those who will become a burden on society. Currently, according central immigration studies, we are spending 135 billion annually on illegals. 		That‚Äôs a lot of money!
@Unabogie @AlienDimeBag @CNN If that were the policy then sure! But it isn‚Äôt. That is the story that people are making worse than it was because of @SenatorDurbin. Do you mean merit immigration? Where we choose people who offer our country more than additional poverty?
@grammaalice1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN 135 billion dollars annually for starters. That money spent on illegals could be spent on better education for our own children. But hey...just saying.
@Rebel4WildLife @geekyteacher1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN Ha it is ‚Äúto‚Äù not ‚Äútoo‚Äù sorry you thought that was necessary. 		Tell me the truth, you have never said a derogatory remark in your entire life? Maybe even about a country, not it‚Äôs people? We are civilized but yet we call someone racist and that‚Äôs ok? I am lost by your logic.
@CurtisIP1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN A shit hole is a shit hole. @POTUS is a different president. 		He MAY or MAY NOT have said those things. So instead of yelling about him being racist, when he isn‚Äôt, let‚Äôs talk about the policy in question. Make it better for the American people.
@CurtisIP1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN Hey genius jr. We don‚Äôt even know what was really said and more is coming out in his favor that @SenatorDurbin was lying. 		Son, since I said junior (get it), it would seem that the you are a little to sensitive and should get a thicker skin.
@Unabogie @AlienDimeBag @CNN Typical lib move.. don‚Äôt discuss policy, just distract the population by creating a public frenzy. It is a shameful business and the libs excell in that arena.
@Unabogie @AlienDimeBag @CNN Yes we are calling him a liar. @SenatorDurbin is know for...not telling the truth. And what a coincidence that @SenatorDurbin came out the day after @POTUS denied his immigration deal and called him racist to try and persuade public opinion.
@Silent__C @geekyteacher1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN We have to many people here who are citizens who need help first. Once we fix our internal issues in this country. Then, and only then, will I support immigration again. 		I put ALL Americans first and anyone else comes after.
@Silent__C @geekyteacher1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN Ha, so when they come here they don‚Äôt bring social normalities and cultural behaviors acceptable to their homeland and unacceptable here according to our standards of society?		Look, don‚Äôt be naive. Personally, I‚Äôm glad we are going to reduce immigration.
@geekyteacher1 @AlienDimeBag @CNN That‚Äôs the biggest problem in today‚Äôs society and why we get no where with policy. Everyone that‚Äôs like you is just to much of a pussy. Can‚Äôt handle a different opinion or a tough stance on policy. Always gotta cry about something someone said.

@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth In case you were curious.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth And one more thing. 		I do appreciate opposing views. What I don't appreciate is being told by a foreign national about American policy that doesn't directly affect their daily lives. 		Nor do I like being called infantile or a mouthpiece. 		That's why I don't like you.
@AlienDimeBag @ScottPresler Ahhh. Fair point. The Russians were our allies in numerous conflicts. But also our largest enemy for years beyond that. Socialism is the  Nemesis of Democracy. 		Regardless of history. Russia is somewhere to watch. And watch closely.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Why? Because you don't live here and see the effects of policy on your life directly. It is easy to sit in the UK and say this from afar. I LIVE here and I SEE it every day. 		I speak with people. I listen. I research. Quit being condescending.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Did you know that regardless of intentions. Immigrants don't always hold American values as true and honorable. Bringing their culture here. That effects communities. 		Let's talk about England. Want to? 	Your opinion means something. Just NOT on American politics.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Call me infantile one more time. 		I have told you. I have looked at facts. And I have made my opinion.

@AlienDimeBag @POTUS And that's the issue. The bigotry against the Republican caucus is becoming the rhetoric. Instead of discussing issues, the left is attacking character, whether truth or not. 		The focus is on reelection. Not the American people.
@AlienDimeBag I for one will begin writing my congressman more often. Sharing with him that my voice matters and the politician needs to be working for me and not illegals and other useless policies wasting money. 		We have power. Let's begin to use it.
@AlienDimeBag I think that you need to consider who our leaders are then. If they only want to spend our money and not concern themselves with us, @POTUS supports us, then they need to be removed from office. 		They are there for us. We should be outraged we pay more for others.
The Center of Immigration Studies just reviewed a study that confirms annually, we spend 135 billion dollars on illegal immigrants. WHY WOULD YOU BE OK WITH THIS? 		Stop illegal immigration and we save 135 billion nationally. Do the math people!
If you want more money in your pocket...		Stop supporting policy that spends more. The less money the government spends, the less they have tax us. 		It's that simple.
As a man, I will.		Stand by my soon to be wife, first.	My future children second,	And my family and hers third. 		I will stand firm in defense of their rights. I will protect them when danger comes. I will love them with all that is me. I WILL NOT stand for anything less.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Actually, not really sorry. But I think you'll get over it. 		What is happening in America is an American issue. Not an English one. So don't act like you're educating me on things I am not already aware of. 		I have seen the facts. I have formed my opinion. I will stand by it.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth You aren't calling me out. You disagree with my political stance. My American values, morality and pride. 		ALL Americans come first to me. Regardless of politics. I would die for any one of them. 		Immigrants come last right now. I am sorry you aren't ok with that stance.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth I read your articles. And I respect you as an individual. But you're  English. You have issues in your own country that need attention. We could talk English, Irish hatred all day. That hatred that's been around since 12th century. 		But that's your countries business.
Look. Non-citizens of the #USA...		You do not have any right to be apart of discussions in the #US. Your input is of zero value, because you do not live here. Keep on Your politics to yourself.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth But the issue at hand is I have American citizens struggling to feed their families and struggling to provide the necessities. 		They come first. Immigrants come last. 		You're English. Not American. Stay out of our politics. You don't live here. You have no say.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Also, if you assume I don't know something one more time. I am thoroughly aware of the difference between nationalism and patriotism. I love my country. I would die for it and every family here. Even immigrants who are illegal.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth High. I said this once already. 		You aren't American. So stay out of American politics. I don't much care for immigrants. I am 100% for the families in America, who are citizens, being taken care of first. 		Immigrants come 15th on my list of importance.

Somebody just argued that "black people and other minorites can't be racist, because only the majority can be. And the majority is white."		What!? Liberal Ideology is dumb as shit hole. Racism can come from all ethnic back grounds. Don't be fooled.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Before claiming the majority of American want something...come talk to us about what we actually want.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth German? That is cool. I am learning German. Gives my brain a break from politics. Auf wiedersehen! 		Being from here I can tell you that you may be sourcing information from heavily left controlled outlets. This provides bias information.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Nothing you say holds any merit with me. You don‚Äôt live here. You are not effected by policy directly like I am. So your opinions are not important to the political process in my country. Sorry. Not admitting anything more than that.
@dbsingergirl @savannahsmith88 @TommyScroggins @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I agree, ‚Äúone of these problems is illegal immigration. This administration is taking a strong stand to stiffen the protection of our borders.‚Äù I can‚Äôt believe we would rather kick out illegals then help them when in need. @reaIDonaldTurmp is a racist.
Again, if you do not have citizenship in America. Stay out of talks over American policy. American issues = Americans only.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Sorry...
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth I do. But I am a patriot. And I am tired of opinions from people who have no right to influence American policy. If you are not a citizen, then stay out of talks influencing American policy. We will fix it according to the majorities desires and if it benefits you. Great. If not.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Then get of American politics. Work on your country first. I am sorry of your situation but this is an American issue and frankly, other citizens from other countries have no business in influencing American policy.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth No it won‚Äôt. Less illegals means less government spending. Which would encourage more tax breaks for the working class and 1%. Which would mean more money in our pay checks and more money to be spent in The American markets. 		We spend to much. To many things are free. Earn it.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Family names that fought the British. That fought in the civil war. That fought for our freedom through WW1 AND 2. I support Americans. Not current immigration. Call what you want.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Because I have no patience for illegality. Zero tolerance for it. That is my position. I don‚Äôt care about them more than I care about my fellow citizens who have established families and names from 200 years ago.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth This is a topic you and I will never agree on apparently. So instead of arguing let‚Äôs just allow our representatives to do their jobs and the majority will come out on top with miniority rights in place. The legislative process. 		Good talk though. Seriously.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth You have zero evidence of this being actual fact. More statistics prove that illegals out weigh the DACA recipients (who were illegals, but technically still illegal being that DACA is not constitutional.) 		Look, again. We disagree, so let‚Äôs just agree on that.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth It isn‚Äôt. I admitted we are a country of immigrants. But that was 200 years ago. Now we are a country of established families and laws. Additional immigration is now a different situation then when our ancestors first arrived.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Then keep your ‚Äúsounds like‚Äù and ‚Äúcould be‚Äù statements out of arguments. I am considered more central too. But on immigration I stand firm that it needs to be placed on a back burner to our American citizens. 		We disagree so let‚Äôs just agree on that.
There is nothing racist about desiring to put the millions of diversified American citizens first, before concerning ourselves with illegals and other immigrants. 		Build our communities and then work on adding to it by additional immigration. Simple as that y‚Äôall.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Excuse me for caring more about my own countrymen then someone who disregards our law. When our law is sacred and should be revered as so. Obey the laws and immigrate according to appropriate policy.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth That‚Äôs not racist. That is seeking to take care of the millions of whites, blacks, Latinos, Indian Americans, Chinese and many others who are already established as legal or American families.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Our citizens should come first when policy is written. Once we build a strong social community that builds our citizens up first. Then, once our own are taken care of we should revisit immigration and making it safer for us and more beneficial to our communities.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Why lower yourself by insulting my position? What good does that do? The facts are that 1 of every 100 illegal has been a recipient of DACA and TPS. The number of undocumented immigrants is high and should be diminished. That is the simple truth.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth The other candidate being first and having the same credentials. 		Also, I am a conservative. You‚Äôre obviously a liberal. But to call me a mouthpiece is bigoted of you. Why resort to names. I proposed fact to disputed your claim and support my view point.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Listen. You seem nice. But those statistics come from a source. Want it? Probably not...but it isn‚Äôt moronic to put Americans first. Which I do. Also, anyone has has ever applied to a job, knows jobs are based on first come. I have not gotten jobs qualified for based on...
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Or no option to re-enact.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Looks like you know of the facts but only the surface of them. Would you like the sources that prove TPS to be a broken government program in need of being revisited or simply repealed with option to re-enact.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth It is this simple. Go home. Back to your country. Come back and sign up for the proper, legal process to become a citizen or documented visitor with no intention of declaring citizenship. Just looking to work for a while in America.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Is to use the excuse that 1 out of every 100 illegal immigrants is paying taxes. Less taxes than that of legal citizens based on statistics and a government hand out from the left allowing them to break the law and be rewarded for it.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth So, if someone is here illegally, like many Haitian refugees were in 2010, then why should we want to continue to support a corrupted system? TPS was a good thing, then libs got ahold of it. 		Using TPS as a excuse in the argument that the illegals pay taxes...
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth This created up roar because a program that was designed for the use of legal, temporary visitors had been perverted and distributed to the illegal ones neglecting to obey our laws in regards to proper immigration.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth Through TPS these foreign citizens would be allowed to work and pay taxes through signing up for a tax ID number. But in 2010, illegal and unregistered Haitians from the Haiti were granted TPS all though they were illegally in the country.
@julietsfollies @libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth TPS was enacted in 1990 as a program to protect those who are non-resident and did not wish to return to their country after their limited time had elapsed. This was so they would not be sent back to their country before the natural disaster or civil strife.

@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC @POTUS @chicagotribune Look I read the articles. You're taking things out of context and issuing conclusions where there are none.		What I see is a gross accusation. And I see republicans who just want to be left out of the racism debate. They have an image. 		Only one man is accusing him.

@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump Calling some where a shit hole can't be constituted as racist. How many times do we use that term in reference to our own nation. Our own states. Our own local communities. Shit hole is shit hole. 		Racism is a grossly perverted term and loosely used amongst Americans.
@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump @LindseyGrahamSC is never quoted as agreeing that @POTUS made such comments or had such behavior. I just finished reading another source from @chicagotribune to and all that was quoted were two Republican senators and @SenatorDurbin. 		The evidence is clear. It is a lie.
@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump I am saying @SenatorDurbin has alleged that @POTUS said these things while, other are saying he did not. I think it is a lie and false news to distract from the DACA agreement.
Why do we call our country a She? 		Because everyone loves a big, beautiful, diverse woman. Who shares love with everyone but maintains a strong ethical and moral standard. Making sure her own are provided for, her own are protected and her own are successful.
@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump So they have brought out the racist card that won them the #WhiteHouse with @POTUS44 and are now trying to win Congress at midterms by doing the same thing. 		It is a lazy and deplorable political move and those making it should be ashamed.
@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump 3. You're right in that the majority of America is not ok with racism. In fact, I would say it was well on its way to being pushed out until the media cried, "racist" about those against @POTUS44 policies. 		Simple fact is, the left has nothing. They are losing.
@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump 2. Show me the statistics that confirm 1/3 of the US is racist or outspoken about being ok with it. Or is that an assumption based on how many people you think follow @POTUS @realDonaldTrump? Because generalizations like that are how people are falsely labeled.
@Shahydat @LAGTweetsMe @SenatorDurbin @realDonaldTrump Personally, before I go to bed, I think your statement isn't applicable here. 		1.

@libbybakalar @WalshFreedom @KatzOnEarth I just read this insanely misinformed historical lesson. 		I want to address just one misconception. Just one. 		Blacks were not kidnapped for slavery by the whites. They were traded for. Larger black tribes that were more powerful than the others would capture and trade them.

@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS With a growing population a government and its people have the right to decide if more people from outside of the country is a good addition or not. Right now, it is not. 		So we limit the amount of people allowed in. Once stability climbs. We reopen the boarders for more.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS You don't even read the articles. You listen to left media and spit out as much of it as you can remember. That is all you do! Actually read up on it, maybe you'll see light. 		Limiting immigration is not a bad thing. We have a growing population.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS "We still 700 to 900 miles of wall to protect our borders." 		"Some of it is wall, some natural and some technology..." 		I mean, if you're gonna cite something you should know its content.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS Hahahahahaha!!!!! You are a title reader! The most ignorant form of a person there is! 		Go back. Read the article. Then come talk to me. Took me 5 minutes to find the exact one I bet you are talking and read it. Go ahead I am waiting.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS I only care about legality. That is it. Come here legally and I am cool with it  don't do that and I could care less.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS I mean, there is no way you are really that ignorant. 		No one cares about legal immigration. No one! 		That's not the issue.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS Legal immigrants are contributing. The wall isn't for legal immigration. It is to protect portions of our southern boarder exposed and unprotected by natural fortifications from drugs, human trafficking, gang members and enemies of America.
Well, the media can no longer say he is mentally unstable or stupid because he handed them their asses at the open immigration meeting last week. 		So, it's back to calling him racist. Will the left give it a rest already.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS Nothing wrong with that.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS Also, helping them doesn't mean bringing them here. Maybe, since they are better educated? We teach them how to build a sustainable democracy in their own home and allow them to create a structure society. So they can live comfortably in their own country.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS The wall is for national security on the southern boarder. Not a money pit. 		We can't help everyone. We are struggling to help our own CITIZENS. Help them first, then worry about helping the rest of the world. 		Americans come first.
@closeupmyeyes @NotOnMyWatchTV @POTUS You can say what you want. But to me you are kind of ignorant. 		#Haiti is kind of a shit hole. Not that the people are shitty people or less important. But their country kind of sucks. Hense, why they want to leave.
Also. #Haiti is a #Shithole. 		Kind of like Mississippi is a #shithole. But people from Mississippi aren't shitty people. Their state literally just sucks. No offense.
The word racism has been very peverted by mainstream, liberal media. And their #blindflock just ignorantly follows them without question. 		Our @POTUS does not believe one ethnicity to be superior to another! Stop #believinglies!
@twinpaulie Or everything you just said was extremely condescending and bigoted...But we don't care what you think. Stupid will always think stupidly. 		Stop calling our @POTUS racist and me racist for supporting him. I'm the furthest from believing one race is superior to another.
@NotOnMyWatchTV Oh stop with it already. We get it we are all racist if we don't support immigration and support @POTUS building a wall and would rather people more likely to contribute positively come to our country then those more likely to become a burden. Sorry we care about Americans first.

@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber GLB, Califorian Breach, FTC...all have specific guidelines for companies in regards to regulating security and handling customer information. Those are three of many. But the 3 I deal with mostly. 		You are required to encrypt as a form of security. But encryption.  CAN BE HACKED

@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber Or maybe you're just the dumbest CFO and that's why there is a former..after your name. 		Check up on your regulatory guidelines and on your IT skills then come back to me.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber I doubt you're a former CFO. Highly doubt. Because if you were you would know even keeping regulatory check ups scheduled for all firewall systems doesn't ensure safety from a skilled hacker. With everything comes risk and with risk, sometimes things go wrong.
Oh, so your 10 million dollars net worth means you are going to share some wealth, @SenWarren? Oh, that's right. No you probably won't. 		#liberalsaregreedy		https://t.co/1ZLT3MnIse
@zaddykingpin @thehill Not defending rape. I am all for consensual sex. But there is no clear definition of harassment or misconduct; so men have to live every day in fear that something innocent is misinterpreted by a women. And now they are facing defamation.		It's a double standard.
@zaddykingpin @thehill Don't be so ignorant to think all women are innocent. 		And frankly, I am seeing a lot of "crying wolf" because it is an easy pay check. Being that men are guilty regardless of evidence or a lack there of in most cases.
@zaddykingpin @thehill Ok. Stupid response. Of course men have raped women. Women have abused men. I mean duh. 		But...seeing as how most cases do mot have physical evidence proving guilt, and these women walk away with millions....yes, I believe women of them are liars and seeking money.
@zaddykingpin @thehill Oh so they just wanted to be heard? 		Right...I'll believe that when the first case of sexual harassment from a woman towards a rich man doesn't end in a giant pay check. 		Sorry not sorry.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber This is also why owners pay for insurance to cover situations like this. So you're covered. Well, banks. Because it wasn't your fault. Nor the companies. It was THEFT. So enough already. 		You are ignorant and I can't do this anymore.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber With saying just this. 		You're ignorant about what actually goes in to protecting your information. Since you don't know, stop acting like you do. There is little defense against hacking. If someone beats your firewall, then you fix it
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber I don't thi k you're aware of the amount of protection there is in protecting customer information and the amount of regular inspections there are to ensure requirements are met. Since I'm in the business of having customer information I'm going to end this.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber Sucks for you. Pay for better protection. 		I am very aware of laws. 		Not sure if you are aware, but just because you were hacked doesn‚Äôt mean someone else is at fault. So agree to disagree it is. Try paying for better protection, I do and get great protection!

To require a payment of 1 billion dollars is BEYOND criminal of the government. 	6. Libs want free...everything. Always hands out with you all.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber It is because...		1. You don‚Äôt have to pay them for any services. 	2. With out them you wouldn‚Äôt have a credit score. 	3. No one is twisting your arm to pay them for their specific service for credit monitoring, which has been around for years before this breach.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber Also, ‚Äúpaying for the privilege‚Äù refers to paying someone more money then YOU think they are owed. 		That‚Äôs a liberal ideology that just sickens me.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber That‚Äôs your logic. Not mine. 		My logic is much simpler. The have a service, pay for it. Sorry information was stolen. But that doesn‚Äôt constitute forcing a company to pay 1 billion in fines and provide free services.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber So by your logic...		If I own a company, pay someone to make security programs to protect my customers and something fails or someone beats my technology...then I am responsible to give you free services? I mean, 1 year is nice for him to do. More than I would.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber @SenWarren has no right to demand fines of that amount simply because libs want free shit. Thick lib.

@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber Product service isn‚Äôt a privilege you mooch. I have been victim of theft. I didn‚Äôt blame the COMPANY, I blamed the THIEF! 		Since when is a product or service a privilege!? You pay for service. Equifax had firewalls that were hacked. Sucks, but not their fault.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber Equifax didn‚Äôt build a company with the soul intention of loosing customer information. They were hacked. That happens. So they built credit monitoring to help provide security. A service which can be charged to the customer.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber Just so we are clear companies have a due diligence to protect their customers. But! If something happens out of their control, it is catastrophically naive to expect them to take responsibility for criminal activity such as a hack.
@justwanderedin @SenWarren @USChamber I read up and again I repeat the previous statement. This is just another witch hunt from the left to attack big business by any means possible.

@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC My company is not as large but...I don‚Äôt think you know how tax forms work then lol. But it is cool. I am over this now. And have tons of work to do. Tax season and such. Later bud.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Now, to his false claims. 		Did he say he would turn over health care? What about net neutrality? Or tax cuts? Did he do these things? Yup. 		He does what he says he will do. And does it well.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC There ya go! 		Well, wrong. Just because you want them. Doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get them. He is not required by law to release them. They don‚Äôt prove transparency. You are simply wrong.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Answer my question bud. You‚Äôre dodging it..
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC I actually own a business that makes taxable income and fill that paper work out myself. So...I think I know that there is nothing on there showing where my interests are when it comes to money my company makes.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Facts do matter you have none. Now that I have answered your question you are dodging mine. You have not facts to support your claims what so ever. 		Again, I ask. If @POTUS44 can say, ‚Äúit is silliness and we don‚Äôt have time.‚Äù Why can @POTUS not have the same attitude?
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS obligations by deliberately telling his constituents and the whole nation is to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, a tax return doesn‚Äôt show this.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC No, that doesn‚Äôt answer my question. Tax returns do not show financial interests. Because I am not interested in being poor and mine show...poor. They show how much you pay in taxes. Try again.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been more than truthful through his first year of term by simply speaking his mind without fearing national lash back. By people such as you.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC It means telling the truth.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC So, my question is. Why is it so important @POTUS release his tax returns, when it is NOT a requirement by law to do so? And instead focus on transitioning life into the #WhiteHouse and becoming our leader. 		Transparency doesn‚Äôt mean sharing your income.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Glad you‚Äôre caught up. 		@POTUS44 was quoted saying, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time for this silliness.‚Äù After releasing his BC I believe 3 years into term because, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got better stuff to do.‚Äù
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC I answered yours. Keep up...do you mind if I ask you a question. Yes, no?
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC I already agreed he did. Pay attention pal. I asked if I could ask you a question. Answer just that.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Now let me ask you a question, do you mind?
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC He wouldn‚Äôt. That what you want to hear right?
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC His transparency comes from his willingness to circumvent the media by setting the narrative each day and tweeting to his constituents directly through his account.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Why would he bother with releasing them if @POTUS44 didn‚Äôt see proving his citizenship as anything more than ‚Äúsilliness.‚Äù		And Trumo is rumored to have leaked them himself. I doubt he really did.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Alright. I see this is going no where. So allow me to shift the narrative? Yes? Ok, you obviously dislike @POTUS correct?		@POTUS44 did release it. You‚Äôre right, I forgot. But let‚Äôs quote him quickly, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have time for this silliness.‚Äù So if taxes are not required...
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC Taxes are not required of presidents, it has been a choice. Just so you know. Never a requirement. 		I think the first to do it was Ronald Reagan? May be wrong about that?
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @MichaelWolffNYC I‚Äôm not desperate. And it has a lot to do with it being that Wolff wrote a book that is controversial. 		His taxes were released. Whether legal or illegally. They were released. Where is @POTUS44 birth certificate?		It is even rumored @POTUS leaked his own taxes himself.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump On visitor logs. Until @MichaelWolffNYC releases his so called ‚Äútapes.‚Äù I think it is fair that he does not release any information either.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Check your other post..watch video. Enjoy!
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/tzVX0dGyYa		Seriously, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about at all!
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump There is overwhelming proof supporting this. I can give it all or you can go beyond reading titles and search it out yourself by reading the information out there.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump What is wrong with that. 		Here is breaking news. You won‚Äôt like everything you hear! Get over it. His policy and his work in 2017 has been phenomenal and above all, better then the past 3 leaders.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Now you are not offended by his inability to do what you think he should. Oh, make up my mind buddy. 		This president is transparent, says what we want to hear and what we don‚Äôt. This makes him tangible. Gives us connection. Instead of always being PC he gives us the truth.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump This is why snowflakes aren‚Äôt worth presenting facts to. You will always have a bull shit reason why the facts are wrong or why you still dislike someone so, why bother.? So we just sit back and enjoy the stupid.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump It‚Äôs sad that you think making a claim and supporting it with a question of your own is fact. Who cares that he made a comment people don‚Äôt like. I do that all the time. Who cares that you find it offensive. By 7 p tonight you‚Äôll be offended 10 more times!
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump You simply don‚Äôt like him...so any efforts to having a logical and rational discussion seems futile. So, let‚Äôs just agree to disagree? Yes? Ok, works for me too.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Never said you did. 		Also, the @POTUS doesn‚Äôt have time to think about millions of feelings. He just doesn‚Äôt. When @POTUS44 made comments that infuriated his opponents, never once saw him say sorry. I mean, the comments made on his campaign trail alone...sheesh.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Dos that make me a hater of all military men and women? No, but was it right for me to say? Honestly, no. I should have respected the other uniforms.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump So you have never said something you meant one way but was taken another? I personally signed up for the Marine Corps. I unfortunately was dismissed for personal reasons, being arrested. But I regularly said things with other Marine Recruits like, ‚Äúfuck navy, fuck army!‚Äù
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Like you, obviously.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Look, you‚Äôre a high quality person. So I assume you‚Äôll grasp the concept of something as simple as ‚Äúwhoops, I made a mistake.‚Äù Forgiving that person, then moving on. 		In regards to calling him an 8 year old. Well, that is why he is constantly on the defensive. People attack him.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Then seek vindication if what you said was inappropriate? You setting a double standard. Which, is wrong to do.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Anyone, even you, has trouble maintaining composure when under attack. If I were to call you stupid, a coward or hold you accountable for a comment made in defense of your character; would you not stand up to defend yourself?
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Are you addressing his 4 deferrals due to college during the war? Or the injured foot? All legitimate reasons for draft deferral. I am exempt because I am my mothers only son. Does that make me a bad person? No! Also, he was not the only student to choose deferral.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump He is also quoted on 9/15/17 addressing the US Military saying, ‚ÄúI am thrilled to join you here on the 70th year of history, 70 years of hero‚Äôs,...we love you, we thank you...from me. Thank you.‚Äù 		So maybe some words were taken out of context.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Oh I do. Lol just also really want to know how to multi#tweet. Thought I would ask. 		Responded about McCain.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Also you are referencing the interview about John McCain. I think you are taking that out of context. He was going after McCain wh9 had just personally attacked him and his ability to lead. I would have probably said something similar with my type of humor also...
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump I did not know you can tweet more than once! Pause political debate a moment for learning session. How do I do that!? I am new on this. Less than a week, and I see nothing for how to multi-tweet. üò¨
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Not enough room to comment on your other two reasons. But maybe if you listened to a news outlet that‚Äôs soul purpose wasn‚Äôt to lie about the @POTUS you would be better informed.
@tonipelori @FoxNews @WhiteHouse @POTUS44 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The FBI is under attack for being a corrupt government branch. He addressed a single POW and said what needed to be said about a traitor for abandoning his post. 		Truth is @POTUS has stood behind law enforcement and respect for our nations flag and anthem.

Before bed I want to say this.		I love learning. I research and read as much as possible. Never to far from my iPad with iBooks readily available. Watching informational programs and reading articles, books and essays. If you disagree with my opinion simply give me material.

@2breakthewheel @roedisco @Kelstarq @washingtonpost Neither. I‚Äôm just tired and going to bed and over the conversation with people who would rather attack then talk. Anyway, like to the others, goodnight i am tired and laying down to rest.
@Junes2k @roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Not using it to do that. Just what I believe. Not forcing you to believe it nor putting you down because you don‚Äôt. Actually, you‚Äôre doing that to me! But goodnight, laying down for rest.
@roedisco @2breakthewheel @Kelstarq @washingtonpost Thus this has indeed been wasted time for both parties. But I have enjoyed it none-the-less. Goodnight though, I am laying down for rest. Share sources if you‚Äôd like. I truly enjoy new information.
@roedisco @2breakthewheel @Kelstarq @washingtonpost You know you‚Äôre rude right? Intolerant and bigoted. Your whole argument has been based fully on attacking my competence and understanding of things you know nothing about when it comes to my actually capability.

@Junes2k @roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Yes, I study science. And from my research I have come to already said conclusion. If you don‚Äôt understand it I am happy to dm with you and share sources.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Listen, you asked and I informed you. Attacking my person doesn‚Äôt help your case one bit.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Also, procreation is a form of survival. Which is a cornerstone of evolution.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Bees and humans are on different evolutionary cycles. So, that‚Äôs a difficult comparison to use in your favor. Dolphins would be more in the right track!
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost I am very aware of the constitution. No need to attack me like you are. I am libertarian. And you have no right to tell me otherwise. Only to present information in your favor and see what my thoughts are.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Yeah. Evolutionarily speaking. We are designed for procreation and having sex with only same sex partners defeats are natural composition and instinctual desire to survive through reproduction. It's simple science really. If you disagree and have facts to sway me I am all ears.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Human rights. Who doesn't believe in human rights? They are our right lol. Not sure I follow why you put that in there.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Also, pot. I don't agree with smoking pot. And for a state to undermine federal which clearly states it illegality. Then the state is in the wrong constitutionally and should overturn their ruling and bring it before federal Congress to lobby for change in federal law.
@roedisco @Kelstarq @2breakthewheel @washingtonpost Actually we are most defined by our tolerance. Being I am apart of the party I can tell you that we believe in the power of the constitution. 		Gay rights - I don't agree with homosexuality. Personally, for scientific reasons. But I have no right to tell them they can't.

@TheCheekyGinger @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS People want the book to be true so they believe it to be true. The evidence is actually out there. I am more than happy to share some with you if you'd like me to. Starting with @MichaelWolffNYC own peers saying he is known for stretching truth and misrepresenting facts.
@TheCheekyGinger @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS @realDonaldTrump The fact that you lack respect for my judgement based on my support for a white, male President leads me to assume you're a sexist, bigot who can't be reasoned with.
@TheCheekyGinger @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS Also, there is no specific "libel lawyer." Most lawyers practicing general law can handle that sort of work. Just saying.
@TheCheekyGinger @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has shown true leadership and stability. His office has been under constant attack and yet he has still managed to accomplish his agenda and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@TheCheekyGinger @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS Ok first off, libel is the technical term when slander or defaming is put in print. So, same thing. Secondly, this is the first book written with false information to be published?!? Thirdly, let's use common sense. People, including family, said these things? Come on?
@seanhannity Sean! My kitten died! Just kidding. Haha I love your show and love hearing an honest point of view regarding national news! My girlfriend and I dislike kittens so talk all you want brother! #fakenewssucks #hannityrocks
@Balerstos @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS And libel law should be pursued. And probably will be once a case is built. Any good lawyer will build his case and then proceed with a law suit. I am sure the White House is looking into their options.
@Balerstos @DogginTrump @thehill @MichaelWolffNYC @POTUS I made my comment based on personal research into the book and @MichaelWolffNYC. Not because I believe everything @POTUS says.

@phoebe0727 @LucBerthelette @joanncooks @billymflynn @TomiLahren Insulting my intelligence and hers speaks volumes to yours.
@joanncooks @LucBerthelette @billymflynn @TomiLahren Mainly, because I have listened to her. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't make them stupid.  Name calling and putting others down is the lowest form discussion.
@phoebe0727 @LucBerthelette @joanncooks @billymflynn @TomiLahren Woah! That's a little slanderous and sexist. A bit. Yeah. A bit. Her being attractive has nothing to do with my opinion of her intelligence. My girlfriend and I both enjoy listening to her. Sorry, I will not apologize for that.
@LucBerthelette @joanncooks @billymflynn @TomiLahren Also, that is a great GIF. Solid game there buddy!
@LucBerthelette @joanncooks @billymflynn @TomiLahren Aww you called me by name! I feel special! Anyway, don't be rude and call her stupid or anything else just because you disagree with her politics. She is smart whether you like her or don't.

@nucmedist @FoxNews Maybe try looking at this as it is. Or not arguing with me just to see if you can catch me in a corner with nowhere to go. You won‚Äôt. All you are is a troll seeking to argue to argue. Not to enlighten. I don‚Äôt mind constructive discussion. This is not.
@nucmedist @FoxNews This isn‚Äôt about fault. It is about the fact that he wants to fly two flags. HOA said take them down because two poles is against the rules. He asked for exemption to the rule. They said fill out the paper work. Now the wait.
@nucmedist @FoxNews Two different situations. Mortgage is another document people tend to skim over. Because they are simple. You borrowed money. Now pay it back.		The marine wants to fly two flags. He was told to stop. Now he is appealing the rule. His right.
@nucmedist @FoxNews Pereira said he would raise the flags every morning and would lower them every night. He never expected it would be a problem with the homeowners association.		Continue Reading Below		Until now.		"I'm guessing somebody didn't like it or someone reported it or something.‚Äù
@nucmedist @FoxNews "I'm guessing somebody didn't like it or someone reported it or something, because I got a call from the property manager who works for the homeowners association asking me to take them down," he said.
@nucmedist @FoxNews ‚ÄúHe never expected it would be a problem with the homeowners association.‚Äù First quote. Was about 8 lines down.
@nucmedist @FoxNews Being unaware, he has decided to appeal the change after the fact. And if the HOA doesn‚Äôt allow it, he will fight it.
@nucmedist @FoxNews Your assuming facts based on context of the article written in is defense. Essentially saying, he admits his actions are deliberate in knowing the rules, but defying them anyway. 		Reading the article and watching the interview. He says he was unaware.
@nucmedist @FoxNews Did you read your apartment agreement fully? Your HOA? 		A startup has paper work, yes. But that is why I have a lawyer. He is trusted with the work to ensure I am protected. So that‚Äôs a bad comparison. 		Besides your opinion not based in fact, do you have proof he knew?
@nucmedist @FoxNews Can you provide evidence to the contrary? If so, I will evaluate my position and correct it based on fact.
@nucmedist @FoxNews Support that upholds your opinion/claim as more correct than mine. 		Calling one a snowflake or saying someone knew something. Doesn‚Äôt count. You must provide proof. 		By my own admission, I am not offended by opposition. I am fueled by it. Also, the marine didn‚Äôt know.
@nucmedist @FoxNews That is only the case if you can provide proof, fact or vetted sources to support your opinion to be correct over mine. As opinionated that I am, I will always admit when I am wrong. Based on then initial communication between you and myself, you have not provided support.
@nucmedist @FoxNews We're not best friends. And I train my mind. My body too. My comments are there for people to read. You see it. You don't like it. Comment. That's fine. But I'll tell you if you're wrong. Have fun on your run.

@ViceMaiden wanted the proof. Here you go. Read the excerpt by the author himself. https://t.co/5YkS1JREWt
Seems he really was making outlandish claims. Hmmmm maybe we should stop telling lies about others and start paying attention to the good. 		https://t.co/ttVS4syaY3
@bpt326 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @POTUS44 I will comment on whatever I want. I do my research and I support only those who think forwardly. According to my research. These men have been outspoken in support and also against. But I'm done with you. You're rude and narrow minded. Good luck in life bud.
This is what someone who doesn't support @POTUS @realDonaldTrump says to a person who does. I'm not even gay! When people spoke out against @POTUS44 was called #racist. What do we call this #Hatespeech? https://t.co/OmRbxPeH46
@bpt326 @thescoop_us @POTUS @LGBTCons @VP @Lgbtq I'm not gay. I'm heterosexual and have a wonderful woman in my life. Again, don't call me an idiot. I am respectfully requesting that. Being a dick isn't cool nor helping your cause. Anyway, everything you cited has been proven to be falsified. So it's cool anyway.
Watch this. Hear the words and listen. This is good stuff people! 		https://t.co/LGvayRIK3q
The liberal party is all about being PC but now that @POTUS is @realDonaldTrump they no longer care about what they say that could be rude or offensive. They will say anything they want. True or not. Mostly not.
@ViceMaiden @MichaelWolffNYC @PressSec @POTUS You're welcome! Seeing you asked. Did you see the reports that he actually admits to his book being most false in the book itself!? Guess I was a little right about his credibility.
@bpt326 @thescoop_us @POTUS @LGBTCons @VP Don't call me an idiot. You don't know me. That is rude and narrow minded of you to do. I support the @LGBTQ and I am a conservative that also supports @POTUS But not you. You are again rude and narrow minded to call someone an idiot because you disagree with them. Dick.

@ViceMaiden @MichaelWolffNYC @PressSec I am basing it on the credibility of the author. @MichaelWolffNYC and @ViceMaiden the @PressSec is a intelligent person and well spoken. Her word is far more credible than a tabloid journalist. The @POTUS is not unwell just because you say so. So #Trump2020!
@Mickeithestone1 @YailBloor72 @CNNPolitics @POTUS Not a bad memory. I respected Obama and his authority. Even though I disagreed with the majority of what he did. And your accusations are wild and unsupported. So keep them to yourself.
@Mickeithestone1 @YailBloor72 @CNNPolitics @POTUS You're right it is earned but also given to those in positions of authority regardless. Something you obviously understand nothing about. And your claims above have no validity. So instead of making false accusations try learning to respect. Something the majority is lacking!
The new book fire and fury, which I personally will not recognize as a book, is nothing more than gossip and false information. Look at who wrote the book, @MichaelWolffNYC https://t.co/YATFQurJdr
@Mickeithestone1 @YailBloor72 @CNNPolitics Both of these statements are bold and disrespectful to our @POTUS if he is really either of these you accuse him of, he is still innocent until proven guilty. Which is apart of our constitution. You know that thing that makes us Americans.
@Trevornoah has about as much credibility as I do. His political view is not only...bizarre and outlandish, but ignorant and ridiculous. Take from me, credible as I am, don't watch his show. Not really worth your time.
Since I am opinionated most of the time and tongue and cheek as well, I thought it would be nice to show a softer side. 		Iran, it is amazing to see the young men and women standing against a corrupt government and religion that degrades women and abuses them. Go you guys!
@seandonohue1981 @FoxNews @DLoesch @ReggieBush By your logic. Every author who has never done anything but written about everything is a liar and a fraud. Or every expert based on study and research is a fraud. So please. Sit this one out.
@seandonohue1981 @FoxNews @DLoesch @ReggieBush Yes, when someone is able to speak from a third person point of view based on an understanding from a first hand account. Yes. You can be an expert on something. Have you ever read a book? Moron. Stop making dumb statements to try and make me look illogical.

@lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost @POTUS alright man, then this is going no where. But hey. Good going back and forth with you.
Just another shot at our President. Putting all the tweets of his critics into one article and claiming he is unfit. Maybe he is but maybe he isn‚Äôt. https://t.co/2tyVrXNyRa
@lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost @POTUS That not the point. The point is to not use headlines to base your opinion but actual context of the article itself. So if you want to talk context, read it, then come back.
@JaneMarmara10 @Paola032314 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost The article isn't saying she is responsible for the term fake news or for Trump using it incorrectly. But that maybe, just maybe her bringing it up inspired Trump to use the term to his advantage as a political tactic.
@Wanderluster505 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost Would love to actually. I am always game for conversation. Especially one I can come away from with more knowledge then before. But like you said. I'm blind and only see red when it is blue. Or something like that.
This country is becoming way to soft. People can't handle being told the truth nor being wrong about anything.
@lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost @POTUS I think it only implies guilt to those seeking to find guilt. Not just I think. Guilt is only where you want it to be when guilt is not there. Again read the article bud.
@Wanderluster505 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost And should be quick.
@Wanderluster505 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost Ok, if you read the article then what is your opinion on the facts that Silverman has studied fake news since before popularity, and sees no resemblance to the true definition of the term and how Trump uses it? This should have a two part answer.
@Wanderluster505 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost Then you would see where the title was fitting and the article wasn't for or against Hilary. So...Then my original comment holds value.
@Wanderluster505 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost This is just crazy people. Y'all got to read beyond the title. Assuming fact from 5-10 words is simply put, ignorant.
Today was a good day. Tons of rest and now getting ready for bed to begin again tomorrow. Might start off with a bit of light, headline reading.
@lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost So we are absolutely clear here. The article is about what inspired @POTUS to use the term fake news and why Silverman believes Hilary may have been said inspiration. Also, how the term is being misused. Like I said, read. Title fits.
@Paola032314 @lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost Read the article and you'll see the headline is truthful though. No blame waa as placed. He said inspired! Oh my word.
@lomedmkoladam @washingtonpost Headlines are supposed to capture attention so people click and then READ. Why would you click on a headline that says. "I'm boring." But if you do read beyond the title you'll get more information. That's all I'm saying.

@washingtonpost Did anyone complaining about blaming Hilary actually read this article? Or just the headline. This story isn‚Äôt saying it is Hilary‚Äôs fault, but that Trump may have only began using the term after she addressed it as an issue.
