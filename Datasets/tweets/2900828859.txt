That concludes our meeting today! Thanks to everyone who tuned in and followed our Twitter feed. We'd love to hear your thoughts on some of our panelists' discussions about the best strategies to implement in preparing for large-scale biological events. #biodefense #biosecurity
"It's not if but when the next biological event will occur. The problem is we're preparing for something we don't know. We're best in this country at preparing for things that we know and can pin down." -@DonnaShalala
"Know that what you've said here today has been recorded, it will be studied, it will be analyzed, it will be in the next report, and it will be taken to Congress." -@JimGreenwood to the panelists
Thanks to all our panelists for their wonderful insights today! @DonnaShalala and @JimGreenwood will now begin their closing remarks.
.@DonnaShalala discusses the importance of public health leaders having experience working on local and state levels before entering the federal government and working on a national scale
"We're very concerned that they're able to lead their agencies and are prepared for the difficult jobs they have." - Dr. Fraser on the importance of building leadership capabilities within the public health arena @mfraserdc1
Dr. Fraser points to the #publichealth challenges that territories encounter, largely due to their geographic distance from other areas and the accompanying obstacles to easy access of care.
Director Henderson explains that top-down support from the federal government and executive branch is critical to preparing for catastrophic threats to public health.
.@JimGreenwood asks Director Henderson and Dr. Fraser how states complement federal funding efforts to prevent and prepare for biological threats. Dr. Fraser: "There's a wide range of variance among the states."
Director Joseph Henderson on his time working in biodefense: "I've spent the last 18 years thinking about preparedness and response." #biosecurity
Dr. Fraser again emphasizes the idea of "where you live can determine if you live." Indeed, identifying threats that may impact populations that are more vulnerable is critical to strengthening #biosecurity globally, particularly in developing countries.
Our fourth and final panel is happening right now! Check out our live stream to hear some of the final insights of the meeting today. https://t.co/X2yyrVCPp3 https://t.co/P86uDVz1v6
"There's a lot of harmony between the Panel's recommendations and these other national reports, all of which mention the need for increases in funding for federal preparedness resources." - Dr. Fraser @ASTHO
"Thanks for the opportunity to come to Miami in January!" We're happy to have you here with us Dr. Fraser! @mfraserdc1
For our final panel, "Working Interfaces," the Study Panel will be joined by Dr. Michael Fraser of the @ASTHO and Joseph Henderson, Director of the Office of Safety, Security, and Asset Management at the @CDCgov. Tune into our stream to check it out! https://t.co/RuBYgWcIGW
"The question is not if it's going to happen but when it's going to happen." - Dr. Frenk on the inevitability of another #pandemic. The likelihood of a catastrophic threat to global health reinforces our need to improve #biosecurity.
(2/2)..."We need to rely on global governance. But those structures lack the policy instruments that national governments have." - @julio_frenk

"The eradication of small pox has been one of the greatest achievements in human cooperation." @julio_frenk @univmiami
Dr. Frenk emphasizes that outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, H1N1, and other infectious diseases make this meeting today a timely and important event. He adds that cooperation globally in particular will be critical to preventing biological events from happening on local scales.
Dr. Frenk is starting his remarks now! Check back on our live stream to hear his thoughts on response strategies to large-scale biological events.
Our panel members and attendees are breaking for a brief lunch! When we come back, Dr. Julio Frenk, President of the University of Miami, will discuss how we can contextualize local responses to large-scale biological events on a global level. @julio_frenk
Dr. Hershey explains that working with each tribe individually is critical to preparing for and addressing large-scale disasters within these communities. With 567 tribes, handling each of these individual needs requires much more attention.
.@JimGreenwood asks Dr. Philip about mosquito control methods during the #Zika outbreak.
.@DonnaShalala asks Dr. Hershey about the vulnerable nature of tribal populations on the issue of large-scale biological threats.
"We have to be mindful that preparedness and planning needs to add to daily activities...We need to guard resources ahead of an emergency...and we need to create open public-private discourse about infectious diseases and epidemics." -Dr. Zimmerman
IF you're not already, join us on our live stream to watch our third panel: "Public Health Response and Population Management." https://t.co/GboeQIaCMc https://t.co/6OGA59PN04
"I'm here today to tell you there's plenty of room for improvement…We have not moved forward with some of our operations within the LRN that I think we need to." - Dr. Zimmeran #biodefense
.@scottjzimmerman: "Nearly every state in the United States has at least one 'Biological Safety Level,' or BSL, laboratory."
Indeed, it's critical to take animal health into account when considering biosecurity. Adopting the One Health Approach and increasing food security are two ways to achieve this end and improve our nation's #healthsecurity. https://t.co/ob2Xj1Z9rh
"Your recommendations will help our nation become more secure from these bioevents." - Dr. Hershey to the Study Panel
"During the 1918-1919 #pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, deaths for [tribal] populations were four times higher for this group." - Dr. Hershey
Dr. Hershey: "The law provides the foundation on which public health response is based." #publichealth
"When we are going from preparedness into a response...the way the funding flows down to the state and local levels could be revisited, and looking at ways to streamline reporting as well as the ability to move funding around as needed would be extremely beneficial." - Dr. Philip
Dr. Philip is discussing how health departments across Florida handled Zika transmissions within the state. Officials found that exposure often took place in the workplace or in recreational settings, which informed their treatment methods. #Zika #publichealth
Dr. Celeste Philip of @HealthyFla, Dr. Scott Zimmerman of North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health, and Dr. Tina Batra Hersey of the University of Pittsburgh headline our third panel. @PittPubHealth @scottjzimmerman
Our third panel -- "Public Health Response and Population Management" -- will kick off shortly! A state official and private sector experts will explore the roles and responsibilities of #publichealth when responding to large-scale biological events.
We're live right now on our YouTube live stream! Make sure to tune into our second panel: "Hospital Preparedness and Response" via @YouTube https://t.co/RcRD4FFrc3 https://t.co/ULHg0Ri6Sn
.@DavidZambrana5 explained how documenting trends and isolating cases to certain communities were two of the key ways that the spread of Zika was dealt with in Florida.
.@DonnaShalala asks @DavidZambrana5 how Miami handled the #Zika crisis in such a comprehensive and effective manner.
Dr. Isakov explains that managing all patients under a surge is indeed a challenge, and everyone's looking for a solution to this issue. #publichealth #influenza #healthsecurity
.@JimGreenwood: "If hospitals are high 90s in terms of beds filled...what does a hospital that's at almost full capacity do if all of a sudden 50 very sick patients walk in the door? How do you prepare for a surge like that? How does a nation prepare for a surge like that?"
"I think health systems want to serve their community...But they don't want to bite off a mission they can't deliver on. So that's an issue." - Dr. Isakov on why unifying health systems in certain regions is critical to widespread, comprehensive response to #publichealth threats.
RT @TAMUOneHealth: "We cannot grant our way to preparedness." -Dr. David E. Marcozzi, Associate Professor, School of Medicine, University o…
"It is 2018, and it's time for impatience. It's time for impatience because we're not ready... It's time for impatience because our lack of understanding of how to respond with limited resources is woefully inadequate. It's time for impatience and it's time for action."
"There are potentially some solutions. Moving from planning to operations and from operations to outcomes is essential." #publichealth
Dr. Marcozzi calls our hospitals' capacity to have continuity of operations and maintain the ability to medical surge during tragedies "woefully inadequate." #biodefense
Dr. Marcozzi asks: When our hospitals are at 97 percent capacity, how will we have the ability to medical surge and accommodate for significant casualties during tragedies?
"After more than $5 billion in investment since 9/11, our hospitals…are far from prepared to respond [to large threats]"  -Dr. Marcozzi #Hospitals
Dr. David Marcozzi from the University of Maryland School of Medicine will soon be discussing his perspective on response strategies to large-scale events. Don't miss it! https://t.co/RcRD4FFrc3 https://t.co/6F44HzSNbO
Dr. Zambrana on preparation for large-scale events: "Our teams are training for these events on a daily basis and exercising and refining our capabilities."
Dr. David Zambrana, Senior Vice President and CEO of Jackson Memorial Hospital, discusses hospital preparedness for large-scale biological threats: "You need to continue providing care to existing patients."
Dr. Isakov differentiates between the capability and the capacity to handle large-scale biological threats. We have the capability -- but we need to increase our capacity if we're to manage major threats to public health.

"The development of EMS historically has been community-centric. Each community picks their delivery model and how they want to deliver those services to the people within that community. It's become too much of a divisive issue, the delivery model." - James Robinson
RT @HC_Ready: Our ED @NLouissaint_PhD is speaking on the ability of communities to respond to large-scale biological events. Check it out:…
"Organizations like ours are extremely stretched under major activations, like hurricanes. Having an understanding of the healthcare infrastructure and the status of that infrastructure is critical." -@NLouissaint_PhD
.@JimGreenwood asks Jimmy Mynatt whether or not it would be possible to retrofit screening devices into airport security that would be capable of detecting body temperature as a method of screening for infectious diseases like the flu.
"Having somebody accountable and responsible that has appropriate funding for the mission would be critical. We don't have any of that currently." -James Robinson
"When one community tries to handle something that's biologic on their own, the wheels will start to fall off." -James Robinson #biodefense #publichealth
"I'm fortunate that I'm part of an integrated health system, so public health and EMS and the hospital and community health centers are all under the same umbrella." - James Robinson on how Denver medical professionals would respond to a large-scale biological event.
In response to @JimGreenwood's question about responding to biothreats that are rapidly evolving: "We are prepared to respond to biothreats...We've responded to H1N1, Ebola, and are prepared for future ones." @NLouissaint_PhD
Sec. Shalala on our inability to detect infectious disease transmission through local travel: "You could find out whether or not I was carrying a gun, but not whether or not I was carrying a disease."
James Robinson: "It can be widely varying from one community to another based on the local EMS medical director."
.@DonnaShalala asks James Robinson how EMS response strategies vary from state to state.
"There was a lot of uncertainty as to who should take the lead and what that should look like. That really hindered how we could engage the WHO and other actors in the private sector." -@NLouissaint_PhD on working on the State Department Ebola response team

Myers: Terrorists that target the #agriculture sector to take the #economy down, you could have devastating effects. Things that we worried about right after 9/11. @SteveDaines @TAMUOneHealth
Sen Daines: What do you see as the greatest threats and vulnerabilities in our agrodefense that terrorists or bad actors might exploit? @SteveDaines
Myers: In a large sense, #pandemic threats are all zoonotic. Stopping disease spread in #animals can help keep people healthy and safe. https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c @SenBobCasey
Lieberman: We need Congress to authorize funding for veterinary stockpiles to, at the least, show that #agrodefense is a priority. If an outbreak occurs, people will be screaming for vaccines. https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c @SenBobCasey
Dr. Meckes: Past attempts to integrate two stockpile programs have been ineffective because the missions are different.
@SenBobCasey: Agordefense issues have national security implications. How do stockpiles for animal and health diseases work together?
Myers: #Education is linked to intelligence. If we don't know what the threat is, it becomes harder to publicize to average people. @TAMUOneHealth @clairecmc https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c
Lieberman: The media has a responsibility to focus on this issue. The #security, #economic, and #health threat is not one that should be overlooked when it comes to #agrodefense. @clairecmc https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c
How can we do a better job at educating the public on biodefense and agrodefense issues?
Dr. Meckes: We support a new #animal defense system included in the farm bill. Increased support for animal #disease prevention efforts via agrodefense laboratories should be a top priority. @SenateAgGOP @SenateAgDems https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c
Dr. Meckes: We are not prepared to deal with major #agrodefense threats. In particular, we do not have enough #medical countermeasures, including vaccines, to deal with an uncontrolled #outbreak. https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c @NCAgriculture https://t.co/9zRa7p21SX
Dr. Hammerschmidt: There is an added pressure of climate change that makes it more complex to deal with disease that impact #agriculture. Plant diseases in turn can cause major economic harm. https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c @stabenow @SenPatRoberts
Dr. Hammerschmidt: Early and rapid detection of plant pathogens is vital to a strong #agrodefense. https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c
Dr. Hammerschmidt: 3 major factors to consider: the pathogen, the susceptibility of the host plant, and what #environment we exist in that can induce the #disease. https://t.co/w0FFOVBl2c #food

Runge: I worry about the local community's ability respond to a major crisis.
Venkayya: Funding doesn't stop at the federal level. State govs have a incentive to allocate funding to help with #biodefense issues.
Shalala: Who holds people accountable to get #biodefense priorities done? #leadership
Dr. Venkayya: If you have a national security advisor who can speak to the @OMB on #biodefense issues, that can help. @WHNSC
Dr. Mann: Now is the time to define measurable outcomes and metrics on #biodefense issues.

Runge: The federal gov is not the solution to the #biodefense problem. Local public #health members are the tip of the spear. @ChertoffGroup
Runge: #Biodefense can't stop with a strategy. The plan needs resources, management and an operational framework to succeed.
Runge: #Biodefense needs leadership in the #WhiteHouse that has relevant, scientific and operational expertise.
Runge: #WhiteHouse advisors can be key players in moving biodefense issues forward. That attention has thus far been lacking @ChertoffGroup
Dr. Jeff Runge: We need leadership and a national strategy as a starting point to improve #biodefense.

Dr. Venkayya: We still have a challenge to find a pathway to license a #vaccine when the disease goes away. #health @FDA

#America needs collaboration to address the growing bio, chemical, disease and natural threats that confront America's #health.
#America has fallen behind the #UnitedKingdom in #Genomics , which allows scientists to develop better #vaccines and identify #drug targets.
The unknown is massive, there are hundreds and thousands of problem diseases and agents out there. We can only work to be #prepared.
Strong #ForeignRelations with other countries is imperative to proactive #disease #prevention
#Science is interdisciplinary and advances in other areas of science can help us advance #publichealth
In order to react properly to #disease #outbreaks, we have to be preemptive and invest in the tools and resources today.
From #anthrax to today's #cholera outbreaks, #biotech has advanced from simple pattern matching to #genome sequencing in large databases.
@PaulKeim discusses the #anthrax investigation in relation to todays advancements.
The #US needs to get ahead of #biothreats, not just react. We need #bipartisan efforts to #protect and #defend #Americans
We cannot stop or limit the #biotech realm, but we can learn and advance to deal with #biotheats
We don't know what is coming next, but we can expect #geneticengineering to become more targeted, capable, effective and expansive.
#Bio has no borders, infectious disease affects us all, we need an interface between scientists, agencies, law enforcement, and the public.
How do we engage the public with #biosecurity? By raising awareness, providing educational materials, and government #transparency
#biosecurity spending is not only reactive but progressive in efforts to #learn, research and advance #technology and #information.
#Biosecurity is not a part-time #job. We need to prioritize our #national #biodefense #budget.
Emerging #infectiousdisease  are #nationalsecurity issues.
What happens if #biosecurity faces the same issues that #CyberSecurity is facing today? #Hacking

#Biothreats are not just #publichealth issues, they should have the same priority as #nuclearthreats, for they could be more #deadly
#America faces organizational #challenges in regards to #biothreats and needs #leadership to give this issue #priority.
#America needs #hard #science and dedicated scientist to #investigate, react and #defend against #biological #chemicals and #weapons.
The Department of State consider #China, #Russia, #NorthKorea, #Syria to have #biological materials and weapons.
By outsourcing our #health data could #America be undermining our health #security and losing out on the #health #economy?
We need to be careful with #data and #health history #security. This data can be used for a #biological #threat
We are looking at a convergence of #lifesciences , #ComputerScience, #Engineering become #multidisciplinary
#Bio #technology is taking us to powerful places...#DNA tech has become affordable and accessible.
Bio is not just #human #health but also #animal and #plant health, which has a huge impact on the #USA economy and health.
Weapons of Mass Destruction Program of the #FBI was born from the #anthrax mailings and #9/11
Panelist: What keeps you up at night? #Cyber #biosecurity
However, the #darkweb continues to produce websites selling harmful materials to make #biologicalweapons
One marketplace was selling #ricin along with instructions on how to use the material to kill. Luckily the #FBI intervened.
#Darkweb sites can be similar to #eBay and #Amazon and can host marketplaces for the sale of deadly #biological materials.
#CyberSecurity threat: The #darknet, or #darkweb allows for the concealed distribution of information about #biologicalweapons
@BillGates at the Munich Security Senate: "a genetically engineered virus is easier to create than a nuclear weapon"
#Anthrax letter attack marked the first #bioterrorism attack in the #US and threats have only evolved since then.
Panelist more concerned than ever over #biological threats, whether from outbreaks, accidents, or attacks.
@JoeLieberman #bioweapons present a real and present danger as #terrorist groups continue to develop these #weapons
@JoeLieberman #Biothreats are not diminishing, #Russia continues to have #bioweapon programs along with #Iran and #NorthKorea.
@JoeLieberman The Blue Ribbon Panel was not created by the #government but by people concerned for #America's #biodefense

Catatrasophe models can improve our knowledge of biological disasters. This can better prepare the gov to assess pandemic risk @dankandc
O'Neill: We need to see the tiering of #hospitals to better allocate medical resources. #biodefense
"We need a bigger cushion." That means we need to know what we are dealing with beforehand and how we plan to address those issues #health
Linda O'Neill: Supply chains are inflexible and require better knowledge and pre-planning to address appropriately. #BiodefenseBudget
Public-private partnerships is a key area where the private sector can help solve #biodefense issues @jeffschlegel #health
@jeffschlegel : Public #health emergencies fund should be established and funded as needed to sufficiently address large scale #disasters.
Jeff Schlegelmilch: We should enhance the core funding vehicles multiple years in advance @jeffschlegel #BiodefenseBudget
Thank you to Ronald Klain, Andrew Weber, and Alice Hill for their comments and contributions. #BiodefenseBudget
Weber: We should stop cutting federal programs that help prevent biological attacks. Sustained prevention efforts is proactive. #biodefense
Klain: We need agency involvement. We need to spread credible information effectively. And we need top level leadership @RonaldKlain #health
Lieberman: How do we keep the publicly reasonable aware and informed about public #health issues? #Biodefense
Lieberman: We need to give the president the same powers to deal with infectious #disease under the Stafford Act #BiodefenseBudget
State public #health authorities are stretched on budget and uncoordinated logistically. We need a better response structure. #Biodefense
FEMA has a logistical capacity to address major issues invovling #outbreaks, but misses the smaller details @RonaldKlain #Biodefense
#Ebola did not spread in Nigeria which reduced its global spread. That's because of #US investment in Nigerian #health programs @RonaldKlain
Klein: #Diseases that threaten the #US are out there. It would be more cost effective to build up foreign capacity to respond to #outbreaks
Hill: The WH has competing priorities. A core group within the NSC that are protected and focus on long term policy is helpful @Alice_C_Hill
How do we ensure #biodefense is a priority of the President? That is a structural problem @TomDaschle
We need a high level person to deal with #Biodefense in the WH. But VP's are limited. The NSC may be better - @RonaldKlain @Alice_C_Hill
We need someone at the OMB to start making progress. Educating the #government will be an up-hill battle - @Alice_C_Hill #BiodefenseBudget
Many people working in this area lack the clearance or access to understand the #biodefense side. @Alice_C_Hill #health
Hill: There is not a single person in the fed gov who could tell you what the gov is doing for #biodefense. That's bad news @Alice_C_Hill
Alice Hill: Blue Ribbon's report reached  the executive branch and were considered extremely well informed @Alice_C_Hill #biodefense
It's been three years that the senior positions at the DOD working to fund #biodefense issues has been vacant. @AndyWeberNCB
