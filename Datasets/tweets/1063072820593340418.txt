I am absolutely thrilled that we have so many strong candidates running in 2020. I‚Äôm excited to see how this cycle plays out.
Don't be distracted by criticism. Remember--the only taste of success some people get is to take a bite out of you.

Do more and say less. But know what‚Äôs coming with it when you say yes. 	#wordstoliveby #leadnotfollow #doworkson

Masonry Pro Tip #1	If you‚Äôre using a chisel to shape stone, don‚Äôt miss the chisel. Hammer to the knuckle doesn‚Äôt feel good! üò≥
