Press traveling with @flotus were unaware of the jacket‚Äôs words until long after she had changed. It was worn cinched in the back in a way that the words were not visible. https://t.co/4dRiRfNhWQ
@FLOTUS undoubtedly has ability to impact the immigration debate even as Americans try to understand her role: Is she a voice for compassion that influenced @realDonaldTrump policy shift or w this trip is she giving political cover to one of his most politically perilous choices?
Reporters held outside classrooms where @FLOTUS met w immigrant teens so could only hear snippets. I did not hear instances of her asking teens abt experience of being separated from their families so don‚Äôt know if she did ask or if any kids were separated or only unaccompanied
This is the flag the teens at the center for unaccompanied and separated kids made for ‚Å¶@FLOTUS‚Å©   - she signed it and is leaving it for them. I tried to ask her how she felt about the president‚Äôs policies and order as pool escorted out but she has not taken Qs so far https://t.co/j6lmlFcyf0

Dr. Jackson said @realDonaldTrump does not take any medications beyond what the doc disclosed in the briefing
"More sleep for all of us would be helpful"	Um. Yes.
For everyone watching at home: An extended public briefing and Q and A session like this by a sitting president's chief White House physician is highly unusual - and would be a huge historical development if it becomes standard practice.
And @drsanjaygupta asks the obvious yet really important question --  essentially @realdonaldtrump is borderline obese and on chol meds how healthy can he be. Dr. Jackson's answer seems to be that between medication and good cardiac #s it all looks ok for his gender and age.
Dr. Jackson said his best guess is @realdonaldtrump is sleeping 4-5 hours per night, based on his observations -- said he didn't discuss with the president
Dr. Jackson tells the WH press corps there is "absolutely nothing I'm withholding" from the physical in terms of bad news about @realDonaldTrump medical exam.
Dr. Jackson is asked how @realDonaldTrump can eat so much bad food and not exercise and still be in good health; says it's probably just good genetics and God made him that way. But WH feeding him healthier than he used to eat,  WH doc says.
President Trump's doc confirms @realDonaldTrump does not have a daily exercise routine but says he has a lot of stamina and energy without it
@LPLPinging @realDonaldTrump Doc says essentially dry mouth from Sudafed
This is the cognitive test Dr. Jackson referenced administering to @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/0BuGYgxpac
The president's WH doctor has "absolutely no concerns about his cognitive ability" but did a test bc "the president asked me to do it." Also, @realDonaldTrump is on a 10-15lb weight loss goal for 2018. Less fat, more exercise, more Crestor. Also doc says Trump has no dentures.

Thanks for your Q. The former administration did have a policy of releasing the names of the president's golf partners whether high-profile or just aides or friends.

President Trump's lawyer @marckasowitz : Trump never demanded loyalty or demanded to let Michael Flynn go

Comey says he never prepared a letter for his own resignation during his tenure in the Trump administration.

Comey: "No fuzz" on assessment Russia interfered in U.S. elex last yr - that's "about as unfake" as you can get
Comey testifies he wanted and essentially forced or at least nudged the naming of Special Counsel
Comey so far: @realdonaldtrump explanations for firing = "lies"; Flynn under criminal invest, Sessions too compromised not to recuse.
AND: Comey says he was mindful of a "J. Edgar Hoover situation," not wanting Trump to think he was trying to hold anything over him.
Comey: It was in the context of briefing on "salacious" material that he assured Trump the FBI was not personally investigating him.
RT @bpolitics: "Lordy, I hope there are tapes," Comey says of his conversation with President Trump https://t.co/w3pgudukrS #ComeyTestimony‚Ä¶
Comey: Trump had asked him more than once about McCabe and how he would treat him given Trump's toughness on him/family during campaign.
Comey saying he was stunned enough by @realDonaldTrump approach to him he may not have had presence of mind to respond so directly.
