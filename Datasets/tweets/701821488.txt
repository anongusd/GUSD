The SALT deduction is a federal subsidy for states to raise taxes on their residents without political consequence. The answer to the problem is for states to lower their taxes instead of insisting that taxpayers from lower-tax states subsidize their profligate spending.
It’s ironic that the same Democrats who criticized the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for supposedly benefiting only the wealthy are now advocating for a change to the law that would primarily benefit the wealthy.

ICYMI: Since Chairman @senorrinhatch led the #taxreform fight a year ago, this historic legislation has driven up consumer confidence, created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, aided in boosting the American economy, and encouraged small business and entrepreneurial growth.
“Most of the pieces of legislation I am most proud of had dozens of cosponsors, were widely seen as bipartisan, and have remained on the books largely because I did not get everything I wanted,” and so “There is always more to be done,” [Hatch] counseled.
Hatch worked on: "weaving insurance company annuity contracts into retirement programs; extending disability benefits to retired railroad workers; facilitating employee stock option plans; and preserving employer-sponsored benefits for women on maternity leave."

Hatch: If the Commerce Department were to recommend a 25 percent tariff on cars, it would effectively raise the cost of an average imported car for an American family by as much as $6,400.
Hatch: The auto industry has been particularly hard hit by steel and aluminum tariffs. @USAutoCouncil estimates that these tariffs will cause a $400 per car price increase.

RT @BizRoundtable: .@GOPSenFinance Chairman @senorrinhatch on U.S. international trading system:   https://t.co/K3IoFf95JM https://t.co/0d8…
Hatch: This positive trade agenda has three elements: opening new markets, targeting bad actors using existing trade tools, and protecting America’s creators and innovators.
Hatch: The good news is that President Trump has indicated interest in trade policies that would result in job creation at home and American leadership on the international stage.
Hatch: Chinese companies don’t pay U.S. tariffs. Rather, American companies and American consumers get the bill. That is a tax hike, pure and simple.
Hatch: While China’s leaders and America’s protectionists have different motives, they have the same ultimate goal: American retreat from open markets and global economic leadership.
Hatch: China is the biggest external threat to the U.S.-lead intern'l free trade system. China is not a market economy—its largest economic actors are controlled by the Communist party. But China is not our only challenge. American innovation is being targeted around the globe.
@senorrinhatch @BizRoundtable Hatch: American and global prosperity through free trade and open markets is a project that has spanned my entire life and I don’t intend to see that project abandoned.

10. Medicare improvements: Hatch secured improvements and reforms to Medicare to ensure seniors continue to receive quality health care for years to come. The Bipartisan Budget Act also included numerous Medicare extenders championed by the Finance Committee.
9. The Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act of 2017: This bill repealed the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a product of the Affordable Care Act. IPAB had the potential to make major Medicare decisions, yet was governed by unaccountable bureaucrats.
8. Social Impact Partnership Act: This legislation creates public-private partnerships to address critical social and public health challenges.
7. Tax extenders: Extending these expired tax provisions will provide relief for families, incentives for energy production and conservation, and incentives for job creation and innovation.
6. Strong Families Act of 2017: This bill provided states with funds to implement evidence-based home visiting programs for at-risk women and children.
5. CHRONIC Care: This bipartisan bill will improve health outcomes for Medicare recipients with chronic conditions, lower Medicare costs, and streamline care coordination services.
4. Family First: This legislation helps to keep more children safely with their families instead of placing them in foster care.
3. Extending #CHIP: After creating CHIP with former Sen. Ted Kennedy in the 1990s, Hatch has long championed this successful bipartisan program. This year, he worked to get it extended for another 10 years – helping more vulnerable children get the care they need.
2. Taking down Obamacare: #Taxreform accomplished one of Hatch's long-time goals of repealing the individual mandate tax. Hatch also secured delays for the Medical Device Tax, the Health Insurance Tax, and the Cadillac Tax.
1. #Taxreform: Hatch secured the largest tax overhaul in more than 30 years. Already, American workers are seeing higher wages and bigger benefits as a result.

Hatch: Just yesterday, @WSJ reported that, under the new law, a significant number of companies that inverted over the last few years will see their taxes go up, at least slightly. This is what it means to be competitive with the rest of the world. #taxreform #BusinessTax
Hatch: Between a reduced corporate rate, the transition to a territorial system, and the BEAT, we have created a system that will keep investments in the United States from being shipped overseas. #taxreform #BusinessTax
RT @TaxPolicyCenter: “By reducing the corporate tax rates we have reduced the tax burden for the middle class.” -@senorrinhatch #BusinessTax
Hatch: For a middle-class family, $1,000 is three or four car payments, a couple months’ worth of groceries, or a rent or mortgage payment. #taxreform #BusinessTax
Hatch: Since we enacted #taxreform, more than 340 companies have announced they are awarding bonuses, raising wages, or boosting retirement contributions – benefiting about 3.5 million workers. #BusinessTax
Hatch: No matter how you slice it, by reducing the corporate tax rates, we have lowered the tax burden and increased the potential to generate wealth for the American middle class. #taxreform #BusinessTax
Hatch: Reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent – the highest in the industrialized world – to 21 percent was chief among the business tax reforms we enacted and put us on par with our international trading partners. #taxreform #BusinessTax
@senorrinhatch @TaxPolicyCenter Hatch: One of the main goals in drafting #taxreform was to provide middle-class tax relief. By lowering rates, increasing the standard deduction, and boosting the child tax credit, we met that goal. #BusinessTax

Hatch: "Obviously, we have seen success in some of the more high-profile items... but our work has gone far beyond those efforts. And, thankfully, with passage of this spending bill, many more of the committee’s efforts – virtually all of them bipartisan – will come to fruition."
Hatch: "In addition to continuing funding for important child and family services programs, the bill includes the Family First Prevention Services Act...introduced by Senator @RonWyden and myself to strengthen families and reduce inappropriate foster care placements."
Hatch: "The funding bill extends a number of important tax provisions in order to help families, individuals, and small businesses throughout the country."
Hatch: "The budget bill also contains a package of bipartisan provisions that have come to be known as Medicare and health extenders. These provisions are high priorities for a number of our members throughout the Senate, and I am very pleased that we were able to include them."
Hatch: "Today, the Senate will pass legislation – bipartisan legislation – to provide unprecedented security and certainty for the families that depend on CHIP and the state governments that need more predictability to map out their own expenditures." https://t.co/642TrwJtiA

10. #CHIP benefits working families. Almost 85 percent of CHIP recipients live in households with one working parent.
9. Families with children enrolled in #CHIP report that they have the same or better access to services as families with private insurance.
8. #CHIP covers dental care, one of the costliest forms of health care that people often forgo. With dental care, children are less likely to suffer from chronic diseases, which inhibit school performance and can bear consequences into adulthood.
7. Since #CHIP launched, the percentage of uninsured children has dropped from 15 to 5 percent.
6. #CHIP is successful: Children enrolled in CHIP are more likely than uninsured children to have their medical needs met. And they're 25 percent more likely to get annual checkups.
5. In some states, #CHIP programs provide health insurance for pregnant women, too.
4. #CHIP benefits vary by state, but all states provide comprehensive coverage, including routine check-ups, prescriptions, dental and vision care, and much more.
3. Every year, #CHIP helps nearly 9 million children access health care.
2. #CHIP allows states to meet their unique needs. As a federal-state partnership, CHIP receives funding from both the federal government and the states. Each state runs its own program within guidelines from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
1.  #CHIP has bipartisan support. Chairman Hatch created CHIP in the 1990s w/ former Sen. Ted Kennedy to help vulnerable children whose families didn't qualify for Medicaid but still couldn't afford health insurance.
Congress just passed the longest #CHIP extension in the program's history. Here are 10 reasons why CHIP works and how six more years of the program is a good thing for kids: https://t.co/zZGFpVYwcJ https://t.co/LkDQ1SSGFz

Chairman @senorrinhatch's full remarks can be found here: https://t.co/lGY42wG7hc #CHIP https://t.co/TExYfIu12c
Hatch: Today, the priority should be to keep the government open and to ensure funding for #CHIP into the future.
Hatch: If Democrats filibuster this legislation, they will be filibustering extending funding for #CHIP.
Hatch: Democrats are holding everything hostage so they can stage another righteous fight here on the floor and in TV interviews.
Hatch: The question is: Why are Democrats willing to filibuster this continuing resolution and shut down the government? There’s really nothing wrong with the substance of the bill.
Hatch: So, where are our colleagues today? Where are Senate Democrats – both on and off the Finance Committee – who have been on their own righteous crusades with regard to #CHIP? Are they prepared to vote for it today? Apparently not.
Hatch: Democrats decided to pretend that bill never existed. As we worked through a crowded end of the year calendar, my colleagues were well aware that efforts to reauthorize #CHIP were ongoing. Yet, many of our colleagues accused Republicans of neglecting vulnerable children.
Hatch: I have been working with my Democratic counterparts on a #CHIP extension bill for months. Sen. Wyden &amp; I introduced our initial bill in the fall, which would have reauthorized CHIP for five years, and it was promptly reported out of the committee with overwhelming support.
Hatch: Approximately nine million children depend on #CHIP and, after several months of uncertainty, deserve the peace of mind that comes with a long-term CHIP extension.
Hatch: #CHIP has given children and their families access to quality healthcare coverage for more than two decades, and was founded on the belief that the health of our future is too important to be dragged down by the political bickering of the present.
Hatch: The funding bill includes the longest extension of #CHIP in the program’s history.

Hatch: The individual mandate has failed. It hasn’t prevented premiums from skyrocketing, nor has it kept insurers from leaving markets. #taxreform
Hatch: The Obamacare mandate tax is terribly regressive and imposes harsh burdens on low- and middle-income taxpayers. 80 percent of Americans who paid the individual mandate tax in 2015 made less than $50,000 a year. #taxreform
Hatch: Zeroing out the individual mandate tax will raise $318 billion over 10 years, money we use in our mark to actually lower taxes for the middle class. #taxreform
Hatch: “If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.” The individual mandate is a tax. #taxreform
Hatch: “The modification also streamlines pass-through provisions, ensuring more small businesses – the engines of job creation for our economy – have greater access to the benefits.” #taxreform
Hatch: Expanding the child tax credit and lowering rates will let us channel even more tax relief to the middle-class.    #taxreform
Hatch: We are also further lowering rates for middle-class families. The 22.5 percent rate will drop to 22 percent, the 25 percent bracket will drop to 24 percent and the 32.5 percent bracket will drop to 32 percent. #taxreform
Hatch: The modified mark expands the child tax credit to $2,000 per child and raises the income caps on the credit to allow more middle-class families to claim it. #taxreform https://t.co/P4cbgqQhLo

@senorrinhatch Hatch: There are many in the middle class who have felt left behind in the sluggish economy...We have an opportunity this week to show that we are listening, that we will act to get the economy moving again. #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: Our bill is primarily focused on tax relief for middle- and lower-income taxpayers. And, the analysis by our non-partisan congressional scorekeeper has confirmed that the legislation we’ve crafted accomplishes that goal. #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: “Virtually every proposal contained in the bill has been the subject of public debate for many years.” #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: This proposal is “designed to grow our economy, increase wages, promote the expansion of businesses, and…create jobs.” #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: Members of both parties also agree it’s time the U.S. move toward a territorial tax system. Our current worldwide system chases jobs and investment abroad. #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: Democrats, from Ranking Member Wyden to President Obama, have supported #taxreform efforts that substantially lowered the corporate tax rate.
@senorrinhatch Hatch: My Democratic colleagues have asked us to keep the adoption tax credit, the deduction for medical expenses and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—all of which are maintained in this bill. #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: Under our bill, a family of four making the U.S. median family income of around $73,000 a year will see their federal income taxes reduced by nearly $1,500 per year or keep about $125 more in take-home pay every month. #taxreform
@senorrinhatch Hatch: “The bill also expands the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1,650 and substantially lifts existing income caps on the credit, allowing many more parents to claim the credit.” #taxreform
Chairman @SenOrrinHatch: This #taxreform bill “will provide much-needed tax relief to American workers and families. It reduces rates across the board, particularly for…the middle class who have struggled to get through the past eight years of economic stagnation.”

ICYMI: Yesterday, Chair @SenOrrinHatch spoke on the need for an overhaul of the tax code to help curb inversions. https://t.co/Wva89WQe3X
Chairman @SenOrrinHatch: Only meaningful changes to the tax code with curb inversions. Read here: https://t.co/aK4oipIMpV
Chair @SenOrrinHatch: Inversions aren't the only problem, our tax system would still make American companies targets for foreign takeovers
Chair @SenOrrinHatch: If we want to prevent future inversions, we should spend more time finding common ground to fix our tax code.
Chair @SenOrrinHatch: American companies invert because of global competition &amp; our system forces them to compete on an uneven playing field
Chair @SenOrrinHatch: Inversions are not a disease. They are symptoms of a much broader illness that will continue to infect our economy.
