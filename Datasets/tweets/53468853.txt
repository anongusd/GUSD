Damnit, *whose.
Other Consumers official (who's name I didn't catch) says company has already avoided needing to build a new power plant thanks to growth in energy efficiency.
Poppe says she sees lots of untapped potential in energy efficiency programs. “46 percent of our customers still don’t know we run these energy efficiency programs.”
“Because we’re in the position where we’re retiring plants that have actually reached their age," Poppe says, can use alternative methods to shrink demand during peak times -- such as tech-driven demand response, solar.
Rep. Ben Frederick asks Poppe if Consumers faces vulnerabilities as it retires coal plants. “Are we creating a fragility in our base load capacity?”		Poppe: “I am so excited about the potential for lots of new innovations that actually reduce the risk of the system..."
Interesting stat: Poppe says 46% of new hires for Consumers gas distribution network are veterans.

In the last lame duck session, Michigan's GOP-controlled Legislature made it tougher to update cleanup standards for PFAS and other chemicals -- just as a scientific panel assembled by Gov. Snyder said current standards may need updating. https://t.co/R3Z71oUGpN

Sen. Jeff Irwin (D) said he started looking at backgrounds of 15 members of Permit Review Commission: "It seems like every single one of them has been under contract with entities seeking permits."
Sen. Ed McBroom (R) says no committee vote today on resolution to override Whitmer's executive order. Plans to draft a letter with "findings" to Gov't Operations committee— chaired by Majority Leader Shirkey — and reconvene tomorrow.
Somewhat lost in standoff between Democrat Gov. @gretchenwhitmer and Republicans over the Michigan DEQ: Lawmakers in both parties don't like status quo at agency and have pitched some form of citizens’ oversight panels as a way to fix it. https://t.co/KNUwgS6ssK
Nick Occhipinti of @MichiganLCV is first at these hearings to also mention "little gal" affected by agency decisions and not just "little guy."
Sen. Lana Theis (R) asks McBrearty to define environmental justice as mentioned in Whitmer's order. Others in GOP have asked that Q. Guessing some haven't read recommendations from enviro justice panel Gov Snyder assembled in wake of Flint crisis. Here: https://t.co/ARQYlwxrat
Irwin: “The existing broken process is remaining. We’re just adding another layer on top of it to make it more difficult to get things done.” #process
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D): “We’ve already got a process that’s delayed. It’s being delayed by a certain set of people,” (polluting corporations) and the former Governor put those people in charge on his way out.
Sean McBrearty, of @CleanWaterMI, now testifying. Says Whitmer's order to abolish panels will remove bureaucracy. “The panels are going to slow down the...rulemaking process on things like PFAS.”
The Senate Committee has taken a break for session, by the way. Will continue later.
Mattson says also cites high DEQ fines for small violations. Says folks need citizens' commissions. “It’s a place where you can go to. It’s a place where you can ask your help,” without spending your life savings, he says. “It’s just something to equal the scales of justice.”
Testifying from Escanaba: Rory Mattson, with Delta Conservation District. Describes folks having to spend $ tens of thousands at DEQ to defend tiny projects in wetlands -- such as widening driveway. “They’re scared to death, they have nowhere to turn, and I get the phone calls.”
The Review Commission has only met once -- and hasn't made any decisions. But Democrats and enviros have raised questions about how this commission -- and one that oversees regs -- would handle conflicts of interest.
Jeff Irwin, D-Ann Arbor, asks Bittner is he's worked for any clients that have sought DEQ permits over the years. "Yes," says Bittner.
Here's a full roster of former Gov. Rick Snyder's appointments to the Environmental Permit Review Commission https://t.co/zWGnFJqwFj
He said he was "disappointed" to hear Whitmer would abolish the commission. Sees it as a missed opportunity. Review Commission had lots of expertise. Said it's not true that permit appeals would be rubber stamped. "That could not be further from the truth."
Testifying from Escanaba is Dennis Bittner, of Gladstone, who serves on the Environmental Permit Review Commission, which Whitmer's order would abolish. He's is a licensed professional engineer and the owner of Bittner Engineering Inc.
Why is GOP irked about Whitmer's order? It's all about the citizens commissions, which have long stirred debates in Lansing — and in other state Capitols https://t.co/KNUwgS6ssK

Clift says neither Whitmer nor the Legislature is abusing their constitutional authority in this conflict: “The governor has this authority, and you also have the authority to run your resolution.”
James Clift, of @MichEnvCouncil on Permit Appeals Panel: “The panel could issue an opinion that the department thought was a violation of state and federal law.” 		If DEQ had to appeal in court? That'd be a waste of resources, he says.

Irwin: “People like me have been begging for review panels for the last 25 years," since Gov John Engler abolished previous citizen panels in the 1990s. Irwin says new GOP-defended panels are packed with more "regulated community" members than everyday citizens.

Casperson: “The whole idea behind this thing was to come up with a process to allow the individual community, the citizen to go forth and bear their grievances” when they feel like DEQ actions are too heavy handed.
Here's my profile of Casperson from early last year -- when he began pushing the legislation to create the embattled panels: https://t.co/ueFQL3Kjux
Sen. Tom Casperson, who was the powerful Republican chairman of the Sen. Natural Resources Committee through last year, is now testifying as a civilian -- to discuss why the panels were needed. He often talks about DEQ regs burdening property owners.
Lower refers to two arguments Whitmer has made at different times: 1) That the panels are overly bureaucratic, would bog down process . 2) That the panels aren't legal. “It can’t be both things. That’s where the story changed there.”
Whitmer yesterday said late changes in last year's bills to create the panels were minor -- and did not address concerns about affect on meeting federal requirements.
Opponents of the panels point out that the EPA raised concerns that they could bog down rulemaking and keep Michigan from meeting federal requirements. Rep. Jim Lower (R), who filed the resolution yesterday says those concerns were addressed before panel legislation was passed.
The particular point of contention is that Whitmer's EO would abolish boards Republicans lawmakers crafted last year that give business interests a greater voice in environmental rules.
Chairman Ed McBroom (R) says there will be no vote today, and the committee will continue discussion next week.

Whitmer on new agency: "We need to be laser focused on cleaning up the water in our state." Says reorganization — with new advocate positions — will make sure state agencies are responding to water issues more quickly.
Pretty sure the "Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy" will be the first agency I've ever covered that has commas in its name.
Another executive directive enters Michigan into the U.S. Climate Alliance, a group of 17 governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and create an office of climate change. It's largely a symbolic move.

We asked Whitmer whether she was aware of volunteers in Flint continue to run short of bottled water to meet demands. 		“I appreciate you raising that, and that’s a question I’m going to ask as soon as I’m done with this interview," she said. https://t.co/vzjZqEqH2z
Whitmer has suggested @NestleWatersNA's promise to donate bottled water through April gives Mich/Flint time to decide what's next. But here's the thing, folks on the ground say: There's not nearly enough bottled water to meet current demands. https://t.co/vzjZqEqH2z https://t.co/aKBWT4wTLo
Gov. @gretchenwhitmer says Flint residents should have access to bottled water until all of its lead pipes are replaced. Should the state pay for it as it previously did? She hasn't specified. https://t.co/vzjZqEqH2z

@APStamm @ChadLivengood @paulegan4 I appreciate the discussion, Alan. In that sense, your column served a worthy purpose. But worth adding that you're the one using phrases like "pillow talk. Transparency journalism about potential conflicts between siblings, former business partners, etc would be just as valid.
@APStamm And as @CraigDMauger noted in the story, this is the very reason why other states —but not Michigan! — have more robust disclosure laws. Paul served the public by disclosing the relationship, but why not give the public more avenues to discover this info themselves?
@APStamm I agree, Alan, that the Qs posed in your lede are worth considering. I think Paul's story responsibly raised the questions, and it ensures state leaders — and readers — will consider them. Waiting for someone to independently raise "concerns" in a press release would be lazy.
@APStamm @ChadLivengood @paulegan4 I see what you're arguing, Alan. Would your concerns about the use of "concerns" be alleviated if the the lede instead referred to "questions" about the potential conflict — the word used in the headline? In that context, they are very similar in meaning. https://t.co/ODyFt8RSwC

The sponsor of the bill, Sen. Tom Casperson, R-Escanaba, has said DEQ is fueled by a “radical left-wing” environmental agenda. (https://t.co/ueFQL3Kjux)		Worth noting DEQ's director is a former oil lobbyist who spearheaded BP’s public response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion.

If this bill goes into affect along Trump's recent "Waters of the US" proposal, about 3 million of Michigan's 6.5 million acres of wetlands would lose protections, according to DEQ. Also affected: About 21,600 miles of Michigan's 36,000 miles of streams.

BREAKING: Michigan House passes SB 1197 in a 74-34 vote. Moves one step closer to Gov. Snyder's desk. Senate must sign off on minor amendments, and that vote could come today.
Rep. @LeeChatfield: “This pipeline and the energy resources that flow through it are utilized by hundreds of thousands of Michiganders every single day." Michigan needs to protect it, he says.
Rep. Yousef Rabhi: “This pipeline tunnel is not going to be protective of our environmental health...It violates the trust voters have placed into us to negotiate in good faith.”
NOW: Michigan House debating SB 1197, effort to lock-in Gov. Rick Snyder proposal to swap out #Line5 pipeline beneath the Straits of Mackinac and bury in bedrock tunnel.
Committee rejects proposed SB 1197 amendment from Rep. Sam Singh (D) to require Enbridge to hire a certain amount of Michigan/Northern Michigan workers if tunnel is built.
Gnotke said he doesn't understand why Mackinac Bridge Authority was left out of Line 5 discussions for so long: “Nobody’s asked us anything. And it’s not an ego problem; I’m too damn old to have an ego problem. It’s just that we’ve got 100 years of experience on that authority.”
Gnotke also objects to lingering references to Mackinac Bridge Authority in SB 1197, though bill is said to remove MBA from Line 5 oversight. "The bridge authority has been allegedly removed here, but there’s too many trap doors in which it could fall back."
"The thing that I find most objectionable, very honestly, is the timeline where they’re running all of this. You don’t know what’s in agreement 3," Gnotke says.
In Michigan House Gov't Operations: Bill Gnotke, former Mackinac Bridge Authority chair, criticizes rushed process behind Line 5 tunnel deal — and reliance on unknowns in a yet-to-be-signed third agreement.

Just now: Michigan House Natural Resources Committee clears bills to require drinking water to be tested for lead, other substances at Michigan veterans facilities https://t.co/NzljhKbk0L
AECOM says it faces its own constraints, some of which involve city policy. https://t.co/hX8CNEKzwL https://t.co/UFTeJ4j8Un
Sorry, meant to include this tweet in the thread earlier https://t.co/IFud2SQM3e
Consider this map by Umich prof Eric Schwartz. 	Black dots: excavations in 2018. 	Blue: likely copper lines	Red: Likely lead/galv steel lines	Gray is where digging may have taken place/there aren't active H2O accounts/not enough info for prediction. 	https://t.co/hX8CNEKzwL https://t.co/Wt8dpbWZjG
There are also Qs about how Flint now prioritizes areas to dig. Though the UMich algorithm maps where lead lines are most likely to lurk, AECOM, which Flint hired in 2018 to lead the project, has its own system. Its lead line "hit rate" of lead lines is lower than random chance. https://t.co/a8m4AuHx03
But it's not just Michigan officials criticizing Flint. The @NRDC is also questioning the city's changeup, saying it only keeps harmful lead lines in the ground longer. https://t.co/hX8CNEKzwL https://t.co/ciykpPWsh8
Mayor Karen Weaver suggests the State — whose blunders exposed Flint residents to hazardous lead in the first place — is putting profit over people. https://t.co/hX8CNEKzwL https://t.co/sv2SjGvPhN
It costs little more than $200/home to dig with a hydrovac, and it costs about $1,700 to dig the full trench Flint is now requiring at every home. Michigan says will no longer reimburse Flint for that work, which it argues is overly costly and no safer. https://t.co/hX8CNEKzwL https://t.co/FFpkz9roQf
But Flint's mayor changed course this year, banning hydrovacs, saying they failed to detect a few lead-copper spliced lines. Now Flint's excavating at EVERY home —to be safe, she says https://t.co/hX8CNEKzwL But that means its digging up a lot of copper lines, only to rebury them https://t.co/KVZR8HWlwQ
Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, who lead the Flint replacement effort from 2016-2017, said the algorithm was a huge help, and got more accurate as the project progressed. https://t.co/Utq2UJpppt https://t.co/1slAY1A7yK
So @UMich researchers developed an algorithm to predict the makeup of Flint's pipelines. And contractors used a tool called a hydrovac to dig small holes. They could reveal pipeline materials before full-blown excavations. I wrote about that here: https://t.co/Utq2UJpppt
The saga of Flint's pipeline replacement effort is fascinating. When it launched in 2016, officials faced a conundrum: How to pinpoint each lead/galv steel pipeline (which needed replacing) and each copper line (which didn't need replacing). Records were a scattered mess.

In case you've read this far down the thread, here's our story: https://t.co/qfUUcotx7l
“I began to feel that I was at the edge of the abyss looking into hell and the weight of the world was on my shoulders," said Robert Delaney of his personal discovery in 2010 of the dangers and widespread nature of PFAS contamination. https://t.co/qfUUcotx7l
Sen. Peters: “It’s very clear we need a federal regulatory standard…and we have to do it very quickly.”
Reminder: PFAS is a group of thousands of chemicals. Regulators have mostly focused on risks more understood long-chain PFAS that stays longer in body. But Breysse, ATSDR director, says of the less studied chemicals: “I don’t think we know if those short-term compounds are safe.”
Asked what federal government should be focused on re: PFAS. Look at food supply, Delaney says. “Are we doing enough to make sure our food supply is secure.”
Breysse, ATSDR director, says multi-site study of PFAS health affects expected to take 5 years.

Delaney: "People want to know what I think about the State’s current efforts on PFAS. Although nothing is perfect, Michigan...is shining a light on a problem the nation must face, and Michigan’s experience cannot be ignored."
Delaney on his 2010 personal discovery of huge, previously underestimated PFAS threats. "I began to feel that I was at the	edge of the abyss looking into hell with the weight of the world on my shoulders. My fear and anger turned to conviction and determination."
Delaney: "The current crisis we are facing...has troubled me for years. I believe that we are currently suffering as a people because of a lack of protection of our population, especially the fetus, from dangerous chemicals."
Isaacs said Says USDA may also look into health risks plants grown in PFAS-tainted soil. Context on that: https://t.co/72YBNJYrVe
Isaacs says Michigan's PFAS science advisory board — convened because state didn't expect EPA to move forward on drinking water standard by year's end — expects to release a report on current state of PFAS science by end of the year.
Carol Isaacs, chief of Michigan PFAS Action Response Team, on statewide PFAS testing efforts, which have involved some 6,000 water samples: "What you're seeing is a very rapid response."

Just realized I had a typo in a previous tweet, which I just deleted. Brader earlier said there would be *no* liability for Bridge Authority re: operation of a pipeline.
Why is Snyder asking Bridge Authority to take over tunnel, Newland asks? "This is a blatant effort to pull this away from the incoming governor...“There are going to be consequences for this action. We are going to get our seat at the table."
After describing the fraught, sometimes violent 1960s-1970s history of tribes' fight for treaty rights enforced in Michigan. Newland says of Snyder's deal: “He’s thrown out our partnership in the trash for an oil pipeline.”
Bryan Newland, Bay Mills Indian Community Chairman (and a lawyer in Indian Law): Says of tribes “We have been shut out of this process," of negotiations over Line 5. 		"Our rights to the fish in the Straits of Mackinac predates the State of Michigan’s existence.”
Liz Kirkwood of @FlowForWater: Talking of Gov. Snyder tunnel plan, references newly elected @dananessel &amp; @gretchenwhitmer, who have vowed to shutdown Line 5. “Any lame duck bills designed to benefit Enbridge should be rejected.”
Commenter Rita Mitchell: “I’m really concerned that you’re being asked to do something really different that you haven’t done before.”
Lots of comments calling for Line 5 shutdown, expressing fears of rupture. Lots of applause following each one.
Hey, while I was tweeting, we published this look at @gretchenwhitmer and @dananessel's repeated promises to shut down Line 5. What might that look like, and what are the challenges? https://t.co/9xXToreDp1 (Deleted previous tweet with wrong link.)
Jim Larsen, CEO of Upper Peninsula Power Co in Marquette: Line 5 pumping stations in service territory. "That makes Enbridge our number 1 customer by revenue in the U.P." Says millions in revenue lost from shutdown would have to be made up by customers.
Chair: "Is there any further discussion from the authority?" 		Audience member: "Shut down that pipe!"
We're now into public comment. (This is going to be a while.) Authority members asked no questions to any of the state's presenters.
Brader says agreement has a potential end date for the dual Straits pipeline — Dec. 31, 2028 — if the tunnel construction isn't going as planned/not finished. Date could be amended.
"The MBA would not be required to accept the tunnel if the technical specs were not met....you would be sure that this is constructed right."
Brader says there's no body in the state with more focus on the Bridge/Straits than the Mackinac Bridge Authority, and it has a bipartisan record of success in oversight.
Now up: Valerie Brader: Former Michigan Agency for Energy chief, working closely on first Line 5 agreement. Left agency for private energy law firm and has since been hired to advise the Snyder admin.
Mooney offering three examples of tunnels underway or finished that were more difficult than Straits tunnel would be: Eurasia Tunnel, Lake Meade water intake for Las Vegas, Hudson Tunnel (underway) to bring water to NYC. The last one is triple the depth of proposed Straits tunnel
Mooney: “In the event of a leak of a pipe, there is virtually no way for any product to leak out of this tunnel. It’s completely sealed.”
Says the 12-foot diameter, 4-mile tunnel is well within the realm of standard tunneling practice. And many examples of tunnels constructed in similar geology: limestone, shale, etc.
Now hearing from Michael Mooney, director of the Colorado School of Mines’ Center for Underground Construction and Tunneling, one of two outside experts Michigan hired to oversee feasibility study. Some context on that here https://t.co/CE3KfQXrrt
The full project is supposed to take 7-10 years. Actually drilling could take just 2 years.
Creagh on tunnel: “It maintains critical connection for energy. Nearly eliminates the risk of a critical leak.” And allows use for other utility lines, etc.
Now up, DNR director Keith Creagh to present tunnel plan: “We do need to get this right. We need to make sure we separate commodity and resource.”
Olson: "You're being asked to gather the lands of Michigan...and hand them over to a private company for private purposes."
Olson says Bridge Authority could not escape liability related to tunnel it would own and lease to Enbridge under the agreement. Says Bridge Authority needs full risk and fiscal analysis before going forward.
Olson also takes issue with language in tunnel agreement referencing negotiating a "public-private partnership" between Bridge Authority and Enbridge. Says no authority to do that. (Here's text of agreement (https://t.co/gJHCrAjfZp)
Olson says @onetoughnerd's tunnel agreement subverts the Submerged Lands Act requirement that project be evaluated for its affect on the public trust. “If that’s not followed, and everything’s put ahead of it, we breach the public trust.”
Olson is discussing Michigan's Submerged Lands Act, the 1955 law that says Michigan “has a perpetual responsibility to the public to manage these bottomlands and waters for the prevention of pollution... " because bottom lands are in the public trust. https://t.co/LG0pVcnxLN
Jim Olson — a Traverse City environmental attorney with For Love of Water — now presenting to the authority his questions and concerns about the tunnel proposal.
We're underway. Patrick “Shorty” Gleason has just been voted authority's new chair.
Barbara J. Brown, vice chairwoman of the Bridge Authority, doesn't support the agreement, writing in @BridgeMichigan: "It is not why the bridge authority was created, and it is not what we do." https://t.co/PnV1yKUY03
One Bridge Authority member, Kirk Steudle, expressed his support in a @BridgeMichigan opinion column today."Considering that public oversight would be best going forward, it makes sense for that oversight to come from the MBA." https://t.co/JEqZRzXWq2
Here's some context on that tunnel plan, which environmentalists — and Michigan's incoming AG and governor — have opposed. The question for the Bridge Authority: Will it take ownership of this hypothetical tunnel and lease space to Enbridge? https://t.co/qGsIk2lVtQ
I'm in St. Ignace this morning, covering a very popular meeting of the Mackinac Bridge Authority. On the agenda: Info on the proposed $350M-$500M tunnel — AKA "utility corridor" — to surround Enbridge Energy's Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. https://t.co/pphorfDuGA

⬆️ This interaction between Michigan and Minnesota is worth noting amid the debate about whether @SchuetteOnDuty is dragging his feet in filing the lawsuit @onetoughnerd instructed him to.

It's worth noting that Coast Guard experts say containing a spill with waves of just 3 to 5-feet in the Straits would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible. Critics have said the 8-foot threshold appears to be intentionally high and otherwise arbitrary.
But for anyone interested, please let me know if I missed any 8+ foot days https://t.co/Clft4JiyuZ
There were some stretches, however, when waves hit 5, 6, and even 7 feet. On September 21, waves briefly hit 7.9 feet, according to NOAA. Under agreement, waves must be above 8 feet for an hour to trigger shutdown.
Re: Wave heights discussed earlier: Checked NOAA data, and i don't see any days this year where waves hit 8 feet — the (very high) threshold for triggering a temporary line 5 shutdown under the state's original agreement with Enbridge. https://t.co/Clft4JiyuZ
Reichel says he can't say which lawmakers specifically plan to sponsor the legislation explicitly granting the Mackinac Bridge Authority tunnel-related authorities.
Here's the Bridge Authority's enacting legislation. https://t.co/hhQByRi3uX https://t.co/6QNBcD73P3
Reichel: The authority has the right to acquire a bridge. "Bridge is broadly defined to include a tunnel."
But Reichel adds: The Bridge Authority, as laid out in the decades-old statute that created it, clearly has authority over projects — like a tunnel — that aren't specifically related to the Mackinac Bridge.
Assistant AG Reichel: "Given the significance of this project and the need for transparency and clarity, it is my understanding that" legislation is being drafted right now to explicitly give the Bridge Authority authority of a tunnel envisioned in the Enbridge deal.
DNR Director Creagh: "That would have been inappropriate" to have conversations with the Bridge Authority about a tunnel before the state reached an agreement with Enbridge — because state needed to first confirm a tunnel was an option.
Pipeline board member Michael Shriberg of @NWFGreatLakes: How do you expect to sufficiently gather public input on this agreement if you're trying to get everything done before @onetoughnerd is out of office?
(I will most certainly ask for those dates.)
Other board members answer that flow through Line 5 hasn't since been paused. 		Shepler responds: "That's wrong. That’s really wrong. And I can give you dates when it should have been" temporarily shutdown due to wave heights.
Question from board member Chris Shepler of Shepler’s Mackinac Island Ferry Service: How many times has Line 5 been temporarily shut down in the Straits due to high waves as outlined in the first agreement — beyond the announced shutdown in December? https://t.co/Zx4kqbfYSG
Reichel agrees that a tunnel and shutdown is not certain without a third agreement. “The second agreement does not itself provide certainty…but it does outline a process.”
Pipeline board member Michael Shriberg of the @NWFGreatLakes pushes back on characterization from state leaders that the agreement, as it stands, provides certainty — that Line 5 will be shut down.
DNR Director Keith Creagh: “The agreement is still open to what’s the best way to decommission Line 5.” 		Key questions: Would removing the line disrupt the lake's bottom lands? Should the line be decommissioned but left in place?
Bridge authority members recently expressed some confusion to @keithmatheny about why they hadn't yet been consulted about the tunnel plan https://t.co/pPv9XURwkt
The basic contours of the agreement" would be presented to the Mackinac Bridge Authority, which must sign off on a tunnel, at its next meeting in November, Reichel says.
Bob Reichel, Michigan Asst. Attorney General, clarifies: Enbridge would need to reach a third agreement with Michigan — on top of the other two already announced — to outline the particulars of a new Straits pipeline protected in a tunnel.

@JamieBabsLife And once the mining company closed up shop, taxpayers inherited the mess. And it was only in the last decade or so that researchers began to realize how huge this threat is.
@JamieBabsLife Thanks for the note! This issue largely stems from the complete lack of environmental regulations in Michigan (and the US at large) generations ago, and that lack of understanding and curiosity at that time about the consequences of unfettered industrialization.

Michigan Farm Bureau President Carl Bednarski. 		“Recycling is something that we all love to talk about, but there’s a lot of us in the state that fail to do anything about it.”
Michigan Chamber of Commerce CEO Rich Studley: “The next step in improving our economic competitiveness is to improve our environmental infrastructure.”
“It’s tough to ask your citizens to pay a fee. But this is about providing core services our government provides," Snyder says.
Snyder announced support of @michamber and @MichFarmBureau. “In February I stand by myself. Now I feel much better," he says.
Another proposal would hike Michigan's very low fee on dumping in landfills to replenish tapped funds to clean up thousands of polluted sites. https://t.co/dTnUBiNqSz
