"We are very fortunate, but I don‚Äôt want (surviving) to just be out of luck. 9% is unacceptable on every level. Accepting is knowing that this is what the disease is &amp; what it does, but it also means not being okay, and continuing the fight." -Teona, #pancreaticcancer survivor
"I know someone who was diagnosed on Monday, started chemo on Wednesday &amp; passed away on Friday. When you tell someone, I have #pancreaticcancer, they look at you with this look of dread that shows that they think you‚Äôre going to die." - Teona, survivor. #WageHope
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of misconceptions about #clinicaltrials. One, is that you may get a placebo. And two, is that it‚Äôs a last ditch effort. I really try to combat that.‚Äù  - @rlunaPanCAN, #pancreaticcancer survivor. Search for a trial that may work for you: https://t.co/HT4A8JtXoG

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about time. The clock is ticking. We need these things to come out of the market. We need more #clinicaltrials. Please don‚Äôt give up. You never know when that next $ is going to find the next drug, the next program, the next option.‚Äù  ‚ÄìPeter, #pancreaticcancer survivor

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so worried about myself, but more for my children. I respect our medical staff greatly, but if they tell you to not worry, please worry a little. If you have to get 4, 5 opinions, do it. Your life is worth it.‚Äù @rlunaPanCAN, who lost 4 family members to #pancreaticcancer
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still so many questions about #pancreaticcancer &amp; that‚Äôs part of why our survival rate is so low, so we need more info. The work that you guys do will help us to get there much quicker.‚Äù ‚Äì Teona Ducre, on recommending Know Your Tumor https://t.co/9LK0MA8nzb #PANCaware
