Google brought this up from two years ago. Eyeliner and lip gloss. Dam does the cloud want to rain on me. Getting close to that 60. Like Jamie Foxx said: Should've been married dating. Blaming it on the alcohol😎 https://t.co/CPvzZeohcH
@J_Dot_J I've had more harassment from women! The majority of knowledge I have. We're from male figures. They educated me on how to maneuver and escape. Sexism and sexual harassment. By allowing me to just be. Or maybe I was too dam fat and ugly😉
@CaptainsLogAz You are too cute😉
@DeepStateExpose Dam! Oops sorry. Darn🙏🇺🇸
@Wale Wow!
@djkhaled Brighter than the North Star! 🌟 Nice time piece. Your son will love it in a few years😉🙏🇺🇸
@CaptainsLogAz No.
@DavidJHarrisJr @KevoWray @realDonaldTrump Should I list every dam woman. Who Intentionally with malice and fore thought. Lied, and misrepresented my character. And caused me to lose everything I worked for. Simply because I offended them. By not being as stupid as they thought I should be? Amazed🙏🇺🇸
@etnow @ZacEfron Nope. Cut beard and stash. Maybe. But sorry not a good look.🙏🇺🇸
@blackvoices @DCrumedy I am of mixed heritage. I couldn't braid my dolls hair. Or my nieces hair without them crying. They would cry to my mom. Auntie did my hair. Grandmom can you do it over? I can't go to school like this!😥 Probably why I couldn't have my own kids😉🙏🇺🇸
@Dillardsb I've given 57 yrs of my all. To people who have lied about my character. Stole my joy. I have no remorse. Other than how it destroyed the youngest of the family. She struggles everyday. Now I have to let God be God. All I have left is faith.🙏🇺🇸
When people go out of their way to lie on you. So people won't believe you. Yet you forgive over and over. You try not to change. Always forgive them. When is enough enough? When should you stop letting people take your power? Your happiness?
@Diddy Baby stop not giving a fuck! Once you stop. You're production suffers. You're not at that💯we all know and love. Paper to be got. Will be spent, while you're lying still. Because you stopped giving a FUCK! 🙏for you&amp;yours Always! Much love baby❤much ❤💯

@Stemandthorn Most individuals I love. I never say bye. Can't rationalize the thought of them not being there. I usually say, " love you, talk to you later." It pisses them off if they say bye. And I just hang up. But if I'm angry I usually say, "you're going to here silence now!" 💯🙏🇺🇸
@CaptainsLogAz Problem?🙏🇺🇸
Wanted to share with others. Who dream of rebuilding what they lost. Hope someone's dream comes true! Good luck!🙏🇺🇸 https://t.co/J70jjN9xnO
@privilegelog Macys. Grandmother had taken me there. Since I could say Macy"s. We had to drive to Dallas. I miss shopping there. I miss all my things I lost. Listed Everything. People say material things means nothing. Until mean people take what you worked for all your life. Macy's please.
@MsMollyRachael Molly had to do the same. Getting too many DM's from fake accounts. Twitter hasn't been much help. So if I unfollowed you. It wasn't you. Twitterism is the culprit🙏🇺🇸
@iamcardib Growing up taught Conservatism was defined as: Having Ethics, Morals, Values. Belief in family, hard work, and Country. Now it's used as if it's a dirty word. Stand on your own beliefs. Honey, Homeless,Broke,Hungry, Jobless is the same for Dems,Conserve,leftist,Repubs💯🙏🇺🇸
@mmpadellan Young Caucasian males feel they are privileged. Our parents taught us to respect not just our elders everyone. Their actions reflect negatively on the parents than themselves. Plaster the parents faces across the media. Let's see if they support their kids disrespect.🙏🇺🇸
And by the way Both ex POTUS AND FLOTUS were Ivy League Graduates. Michelle Obama graduated from Princeton and Harvard. She immediately walked away! Sorry @TomiLahren Mrs. Obama wouldn't been able to D.I.D.. 🙏🇺🇸 always
The same text books are available at every college and university. It's the perception and intellect of the individual. Which interprets and applies said theories &amp; ideas. Yes even rappers and athletes can apply Relative theory regarding Politics.
I explained to someone who was listening in on a private conversation. I don't complain. I merely make suggestions for improvement. This refers to any situation or venue. Just because I didn't graduate from Harvard. Doesn't mean I'm incapable of an intellegent solution or idea.
@realDonaldTrump Please ask Ms. Pelosi why Mexico hasn't invoked laws. To deter the influx of illegal entry into America. While detained they get housed,clothed and feed. While America pays. Yet we work all our lives.There's a 7yr waiting list for affordable housing? Only $15 a mon in food asst?
@TheRoot @iamcardib  Gladwell says an Expert has to have studied or practiced over 10,000 hrs on a subject or skill. It appears @TomiLahren is no Expert on Political subject or People. Google doesn't count as a skill set.

A court appointed Guardian. Wouldn't allow my mother with dementia and other medical issues medical attention. After she fell in the nursing facility. Wouldn't call Facility doctor. Told just give her pain meds? Isn't that inhumane? YET DOGS GET BETTER TREATMENT!

@JoelOsteen I didn't have to get away from the toxic people in my past. God did. They prayed I would continue to suffer and fail. God's grace and mercy strengthens me everyday. Allowing me to get closer to what God has ordained for my life. Praying and believing in God's promises.🙏

@TedFireX @davidbrabbins @annamaria1word @RealSaavedra @benshapiro Actually the lending guidlines were changed. So minorities could achieve the American Dream of Home ownership. The quidelines were discriminatory. Precluding most minorities from receiving affordable interest.

@ABCPolitics Sorry, I just can't imagine what type of information. Ivanka could have on her personal email account. That could jeopardize America's Security! Other than. Make sure to order 2 pair of Red Pumps?🇺🇸
@kmart93 @JArmadaMusic Between Copays, prescription's. Parking and premiums. Or doctors constantly changing prescription's. You have to choose between. Eating, lights, food or just giving up.
@Rietta1 @blakeshelton Right now. Its either a cell phone or antenna. Need cell phone. Maybe next year. Thanks!🙏

@TedFireX @davidbrabbins @annamaria1word @RealSaavedra @benshapiro Yes he did. Liberals, Leftists, Republicans, Democrats. No one speakes of how Bush left the Obama Administration with such a heavy burden. Obama had to bail out Wall Street and Major Lending Institutions. Due to Bush's mismanagement. Yet No One speaks about those issues.
@tahoetim14 @RealSaavedra @benshapiro The only issue I have. Everyone says Obama did nothing. No one addresses what his administration incurred from the Bush Administration. Which is what sent this country into. The 2008 Foreclosure Bubble and recession.
@Pittpatva @StevenStein65 @RealSaavedra @benshapiro Please have the Congressional Budget Office contact me. I think their figures are somewhat off. My income wasn't even listed. As the poorest. Are they using Gross or net poorest?

@tvonetv @HaHaDavis After watching the video. And through a flood of tears. I tweeted this. I agree this and other acts of kindness. Should go viral.

@Everette I understood the Jay-z reference. I respect Jay-Z for his humanitarian efforts. I preferred 50's diversity. Meant alot when he branched out from  rapper, to actor, producer, Writer. You appreciate 50cent when that's all you have. Or should have said. He had then💯
@tvonetv Are there any other choices? See I don't think I could get Kim Kimble. To make a wig for me in any of those styles. Nope. Not 1234.😲
@kwilli1046 @KevoWray Killed unjustly predicated on the color of their skin Judged and Sterotyped for their outward appearance. Those who chose to take a knee. Out of outrage of the senseless death of black men. Must be surprised 2 see. Compassion has no color or ethnicity. It's the❤of the man💯

@drboycewatkins1 Dr. Watkins May I  Explain the reasons. I Dont vote predicated on skin color. Primarily because it takes more than 1 black. To resolve 300+ yrs of discrimination against minorities. And More than 2 terms. It takes a nation 2 resolve these issues. Not a handful of blk politicians.
@usminority @kismets_pawn Please understand. Labeling a group of individuals. Is just as wrong as others labeling you. For your life style choices. I've  supported the LBGT community.

@RealDLHughley My mother was HUD Certified. I worked in Banking and Real Estate. We knew every CFR. As it pertained to HUD. But this white woman. Couldn't except the fact. Blacks on subsidized housing programs. Were educated and not on welfare all our lives. She broke the law. We didn't.
@RealDLHughley Why does everyone think. This type of prejudice just started. While on a subsidized housing program. Informed the worker. They miscalculated the rent.  Instead of correcting the mistake. Was told to sell one of our vehicles. Or sell my jewelry. My mother &amp;I worked all our lives.
@KarenForTrump @w_terrence Karen. I truly understand. It would take another 57 years. To tell you all I've endured. The only thing that sustains me. Is Prayer. If America can't take care. Of its own who live and work here. Why should others be allowed.  To receive benefits we can't. I will pray for you.
@thejenlife I wish I could help you. The only thing that I can suggest. Stay away from people and circumstances.  That cause you stress. And Pray a lot. Blessings Peace and Prosperity 💛-margo
@w_terrence No I'm angry. As an American. I was denied assistance. Denied housing. And didn't qualify for any benefits.  Because I had no children and worked all my life. Everyone is entitled to the American Dream. If Americans can't obtain the American dream. How can others?🇺🇸

@drboycewatkins1 My experience. Supported family member and his child. Through hard times for years. My sister and I. That's what families do. For family. When I was in need. They turned their backs on me. Never asked them to kiss my butt. For my years of support. Just expected gratitude. Family?

@GunnelsWarren I agree with every topic. So why hasn't our elected officials. Dems, Republicans, liberals, fought for their constituents. It is 2018, the cost of living. Hasn't caught up with minimum wage? Most are homeless. And don't qualify for assistance. Vote people. Vote!!

Because I don't hold a PHD in Economics. Foreign Policy,  or Political Science. Could someone please explain. Why haven't Mexican Leaders addressed. Illegals at American Borders or seperation of families?
@gsteck74 @AlmightTedd Why hasn't Mexican Leaders addressed Illegals entering illegally. Or the separation of families? Why should America Spend tax payers money. To change laws. Or fire Americans enforcing the law. When Mexico is responsible. For the burden of illegals at American borders.
@w_terrence Good luck with that..seriously..good luck🔩
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Then I implore you. To have some public sentiment. For our government officials. Who reluctantly have no choice. But to follow laws and policy. For the good of the many, than that of the few.
@CNN @FoxNews We are asking Americans step down out of office. Suggesting America should be more sympathetic humanistic. When will Mexico and other countries. Be forced to do the same. To address the issues in their countries. While America is bankrupt for not being inhumane. https://t.co/kNFHbjGj49
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President. I dont support separation of families. However Mexican law makers are just as complicit. For the families illegal entry to US, and separation of families. Americans should not Lose jobs, offices. Over a legal issue Mexico is responsible for.
@TheView School yard bullying, Cyber bullying,  Work place bullying, Encountering Rude unempathetic employees. All trigger massive shootings. Or worst, suicides. We blame lack of gun laws. NRA, Politicians, Law enforcement, The President. When the real cause. People.
@CuomoPrimeTime @KamalaHarris This is ridiculous. These policies have been in place for years. Why aren't  Mexican leaders forced. To make legislative changes. Which could prevent child separation. This administration and President. Should not be demonized. For what Mexico is turning a blind eye to.
@HuffPost Would it be better to simply build holding areas. Which could house entire family's. Which are caught trying to enter illegally. Who would bare that cost? Mexico or America? Why doesn't Mexico intervene? Why are our law makers and President. Being demonized and called cruel?
Quite sure Abuela had a lot to do with it. But it did help Mexico had a "KICK ASS TEAM😁"⚽️⚽️⚽️ https://t.co/FnBxRnphje
Americans are faced with incarceration daily. For endangering the lives of their children. Our Foster care system is over burden with American children whose parents struggled. To keep them, but failed. Why should laws be changed for illegals. And not for U.S.? Same inhumane law? https://t.co/zRm03uc8CV

@ArmAndProtect I respect that. My own perspective. I try to eradicate the negative sterotyping of Black Americans. By refusing to be Sterotyped. Sometimes, it's not the color of your skin. But the color of your attitude🤢

@chadfelixg I feel the same about news. Its the same story lines. Repeated over and over. As if they are trying to brain wash you. Into believing their politics or views.	l won't apologize for being astute enough to formulate my own opinions. Yet receptive to new ideas.
We can't support a system. Which stifles the voices of those. Who deserve to be heard and understood. If Americans can walk a picket line. NFL players should be able. To  Take A Knee! https://t.co/p9TpGM6QtY
@ShaunKing Just as Church is Separate from State. According to the Constitution. So should the influence of any President regarding NFL policies. Players are within their rights. To voice their opinions and protest. Regarding Moral and Ethical issues. Which impact their lively hood.
@JoelOsteen I've learned. When a door closes. Or a window is nailed shut. Not to fear. I have a carpenter on speed dial. Jesus! Will build me a new home. Starting with a new foundation!🙏👑🙏

@PsychoIogicall The people and problems you were trying to escape from. By committing suicide. Unfortunately, are the same SOB's who will be there too. You can't move from Hell. You can here.🤔
RT @drboycewatkins1: Anybody else watching Black Lightning on Netflix?  I’m loving it even more than Black Panther, it’s a great show!!!!!
@drboycewatkins1 No. Binging on Netflix "Being Mary Jane" First episode's. Needed the synical, sarcastic, everso. Jaded perception of fu'dup relationships. Plus my girl Union. Always about you! Alwaz! Cuz you're Fierce! Stephen Bishop. Nuff said!
@Ohhdeee__ @heJuan_ulose @GlamourDollO_o You stated. "You couldn't" because of "your parents." Six year olds singing Cardi's songs. Is a reflection "of their parents." Who must play Cardi's music. Based on their "six year olds." Knowing the words verbatim! Her music is offered without explicit lyrics on radio &amp;Walmart!
@Bakari_Sellers And I'm buying😀
@trvisXX May I have your old wheels?
@saintpaulcenter Lord I hope it's in the next day or to. I have no more options.

What Would You Do For Love &amp; Love Will Keep Us Together. Are so well written with Phenomenal Casts. I actually found myself laughing out loud. The shows are well written. Better than what major networks have to offer. My Aspirations for quality shows. Finally on @TVaspire Thanks
@PsychoIogicall Very true. Especially in relationships. When a person use to think. Everything you did was cute. Starts pointing out all your flaws. Run to the nearest Therapist. Fast.

@JudicialWatch I'm sorry. Our Judicial System needs to focus on more relevant issues. There are major issues impacting.  Ordinary people who have been treated unjustly. And are suffering. Because our judicial system. Continues to focus on irrelevant issues? Please.
@BCBSAssociation About dam time. People have been dying. Due to inadequate and poor quality health care. The cost and lack of transportation. Hospitals charge for everything. Parking in major cities cost upward of over $21 and up. Low income and seniors can't even afford Sr care trans programs.
@TheEllenShow @BradPaisley Only wish I could be there. Have fun. God bless. ❤Brad Paisley..
@RealDLHughley It is so surreal. I've watched episodes of the Hughleys on Aspire. Issues of racism, bullying, gun control and police brutally from the early 2000's. Are the Same issues still relevant in society in 2018. Why haven't we improved on these issues? Why?
@DrShayPhD @paphotog My opinion. Should be predicted on circumstances. However, I feel it's a conflict of interest. For any man to make policy concerning Abortion. They are the pedophiles, rapist. Incestuous predators. Just my opinion.

@RVAwonk @JoyAnnReid I've often stated. No men should be allowed to make policies or laws. Involving acts of rape, incest, or domestic violence against women.  Due to conflict of interest. Usually men are the aggressor. How can they honestly be bias to judge? When they themselves are complicit.

@TheEllenShow @jimmykimmel Dam.. I never even heard of this movie. Indicative of the shape of Hollywood?. Please..the news always talking about the shape of the Russian indictments. Or the shape of Trumps bald spot. But No shape of water? Was it a documentary? About Deer Park?
@6BillionPeople Key phrase " be broke" when broke, even with the best idea. Because you're broke. People will ask "How much money have you invested?" If you're broke. They tend to think. Your idea might not be worth investing in. Another broke door closed.
@PsychoIogicall Because we have no time. To solve our own.
Have to be honest. Changed from Oscars after Mary J. So sorry Oscar. It's not you? I think we've just out grown each other😘

@malcolmshabazz6 Sorry. I can't with a sound consciousness answer that question. Only Pastors believing the Politicians they endorse. Will help with funding to improve their communities. God will do the rest.
@HainesTracy @rolandsmartin Her only regret. People now know she's a racist. I will pray no harm comes to her. Pray she will understand. That being called a Racist. Is just as deplorable and demeaning as using the N-word.
@warriors I love when children's dreams come true. And Mr. Curry thank you for putting that smile on his face. You're an Incredible athlete. Father. Hero of this young man. And many others like him. Thank you.
