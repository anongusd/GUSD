@Vikimarie2 Ok that's your opinion!but once again proven, it's the right that takes results and keeps on going.  Not trying to beat into houses, march the streets. No we went to work. 		Left for 2yrs demanded Fire Sessions, now its oh no! 		WTF?

You sure do act like u have first hand knowledge of how they feel. 		It was the KKK that has consistently donated to Clinton's  and that the home headquarters Clinton moved to Harrison County Ark, 		Again, everything is connected.

Who is NYT owned by?		Have u followed the money? 		CIA propaganda started in late 50s. Look it up, Clinton himself had to release the classified papers on Mkultra and Project Monarch of brainwashing America. 		Did u know in 46 Iran was actually a democracy?
@Vikimarie2 That is a lie, bc of my own experiences, I have watched the Democrat leaders destroy America. Starting as a child whose parents where hardcore Dems. 		So I have seen both sides. They are not all perfect. But it was Clinton who started the chain of killing our workforce.

But what is your opinion on the Pedophiles trying to normalize adult/child love?
