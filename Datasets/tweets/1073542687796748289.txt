@lisa_smith40 @cmclymer No shit right. I love it. She could be saying that she likes puppies and suddenly certain individuals would despise all things canine. It's not about her ideas at all. It's about people going against ANYTHING related to Obama. Gimme a break.☺
@izzygolfing @cmclymer Lol. Trump is gonna be "Making Cell Block D Great Again" soon.
@SteMinardon @cmclymer She's not our leader. He IS. I don't trust a guy who had a "peeing incident" w escorts to be a moral role model.
@pslgreg I find ALOT of crap funny. But Im not a leftist. Are you a self proclaimed die hard Trump supporter? Or die hard republican? Im pretty much "middle". Your pretty quick to GENERALIZE and lump anyone who disagrees w you into a convenient group that's easy to name call and insult.

@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA You can't really speak for "Most of the left" or anybody else.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Most of your other views pro gay marriage, pro legalization etc ARE pretty progressive for one who claims to be on the right. I'm not left OR right. I look at things issue by issue.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Your need to protect your self from essentially baseless fears, at the expense of everyone in society seems a bit selfish.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Essential liberty would be people's right to move freely around society , and it's threatened by people who fear the statistically unlikely and therefore NEED to carry a gun. If you want to be safe why would you support a ton of guns in society?
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA I honestly think the only effective solution is banning guns outright except military and police. Hunt w a bow.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Lol. Oh ok. My bad, no offense. But valid point I'm making. Dude if your military or ex military or law enforcement, I'm good w you having any sort of weapon. But to HUNT one needs one shot.
@Higginboth1Joel @HandsHead @Tampke @NRA Your nuts man. Your solution to gun violence is MORE guns? I dont TRUST my safety and the safety of the public to Vigilantes. I trust the police and the military.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Some have switches to go from 3 round bursts.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Yeah but you can convert them or get a bump stock. Some people can even train themselves to shoot as quickly as if they had a bump stock even without one. You only need one shot to kill a deer. Hunt w a black powder rifle if your a SKILLED huntsman.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Lmfao. I know the difference between semi auto and fully auto pal. Trust me.

@realDonaldTrump Thats cuz they know youll be out of office.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Unfortunately not all victims of gun violence are involved in high risk behavior like gangs.

@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA @Well_Regulated_ I'm all about article 4 of the 25th Amendment.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA It's probably hard to notice a drastic change cuz I don't believe that they had anywhere near as many total firearms per capita to begin with as we do. Regulatory gun laws are ineffective for whatever reason. Guns end up in the hands of the wrong people. Less guns is the solution
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Any country's murder rate will drop if guns are banned and confiscated. Obviously it would take some time AFTER any ban to see the affects. There won't automatically be less guns immediately just cuz theyre outlawed. Have to wait til numbers are reduced via confiscation.
@notgroupthink @Thomas1774Paine 1.She could just want privacy and peace while finishing recovering. 2.Pretty hard to hide a death. If she's incapacitated the ONLY motive to stall announcing it would be that maybe they're waiting til trumps gone since he'd get to appoint a replacement. It wont be long.
@aggies1616 @Thomas1774Paine When it comes to news, especially about politics, I've been watching the ACTUAL SENATE AND HOUSE on either cspan2 or 3 or else on pbsnewshour feed or politicos feed.

@nihilnovi @JEM490 @smfuller2011 @NRA Clever memes don't change facts man. Reducing the amount of firearms would continually reduce the total number of gun deaths.
@realDonaldTrump @CNN If your referring to what the Kurds are doing, it's not technically the u.s. doing it.
@realDonaldTrump Yes im quite SURE they are refusing to take murderers into custody. Your misleading b.s. has lost its effectiveness. Even your BASE knows you misrepresent, embellish, and flat out lie.
@Tampke @HandsHead @Higginboth1Joel @NRA Switzerland is tiny. And extremely wealthy. And im talking per capita. I know every household has A gun in switzerland. It's not really a fair comparison.

@realDonaldTrump You are cooked and you know it. Resign? Flee? Depending on the EXTENT, and only you know it, HANGING could be an option.
@realDonaldTrump did you WATCH today? You think they are painting YOUR atty gen into a corner about the legality of indicting a sitting president for nothing? And your children too. Your talking to lawyers NOW I'd assume. Gotta be.
@AlexisG73380085 @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Lol. Ooookay. You advise me to keep my mouth shut or what? Childish much? They are building a case against him. You think EVERYONE around him was breaking the law but NOT him? Look at ALL the indictments.
@Scholar4Nancy @realDonaldTrump You imply that I don't work and then make some weird karmic veiled threat. I have NO idea who you are. Bimbo.
@AlexisG73380085 @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump It's coming. They are building an airtight case. You honestly think EVERYONE around him was breaking laws, but NOT him?
@Scholar4Nancy @realDonaldTrump Lol. You assume an awful lot. Is that one of your prerehearsed responses.
@McCloudSantill1 @eugenegu @realDonaldTrump Attacking people's physical appearance loses you credibility.  I see WHY you may be a Trump supporter. Insults. He does it to foreign officials and his OWN Intelligence personnel.  ( how witty and original of you, Obama has large ears, Dumbo, how are you NOT writing for SNL?)
@AlexisG73380085 @DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump Citing a previous time when it's alleged that someone ELSE also broke the law isn't a realistic way to defend the fact that Mr Trump broke the law. I'm not a lawyer but, Im pretty sure that it doesn't work that way in a courtroom.
@realDonaldTrump Ya wanna talk about harassment? Try walking into a dressing room full of teenage women at a beauty pageant! Oh wait...

@RandPaul @DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump If not us, whom? We stayed out of WW2 long enough that it became a GLOBAL issue. Better to keep violent radicals suppressed an at bay on THEIR turf than ours. Let the military and intelligence people worry about that stuff. They're better qualified and better positioned.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump Your going to be indicted. Your lawyers are, of course, making you aware of THAT fact. The question is whether they think they can manipulate and maneuver enough to keep you out of prison. You gotta be at least a little worried. Bet you've  ALREADY thought about if you'll flip.

@realDonaldTrump Your tweeting an awful lot today mr. Trump. Nervous? Smoke and mirrors? You trying to draw attention away from the fact that your closest political allies HAD to speak up in opposition to your bumbling foreign relations stuff?
@realDonaldTrump This is about combating ISIS one foreign soil so that we have less chance of having to deal with them here. And women's rights, globally! Quit trying to focus on this damn wall. Listen to Mitch and your fellow republicans.
@realDonaldTrump Verify that. Whom among your intelligence team said that? Mitch had to TRY and fix your bumbling foreign policy moves today along with your fellow republicans. Why are you lying Mr. President? No one told you the MEDIA mischaracterized.
@realDonaldTrump You ARE seriously unstable. The fact that your attitudes toward foreign policy changes from day to day shows weakness and instability to our enemies and our allies. Your words hold little value to anyone. The only thing reliable or consistent with you is your unpredictability.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Again, Mitch, one of your father's closest allies, is FORCED to side AGAINST him. Republicans STILL are human with a conscience. You dad understands little about military strategy and foreign policy. Thank God his own people can ,WHEN FORCED, Stop his insanely wishy washy ideas.

@Batts61 @VP @carlosvecchio @JulioBorges @WhiteHouse @jguaido The guy in charge of ballot counting has openly stated that it wasn't won above board. They made the guy challenging it's legitimacy ineligible to even run.
@RyanAFournier Lol. Your rationale isn't valid. In what way is it relevant? The goal was to quietly slip in and kill bin laden. The goal was a show of force and to show that federal authorities mean business with stone.

@VP @POTUS Are you gonna be able to look your grandchildren and God in the eye knowing that Republicans stood idly by whilst this mess played out? Your gonna ride it to the bitter end? LAWYERS have GOT to be telling you that it's inevitable. Are you SO involved you CAN'T get out now?
@VP @POTUS Vice President Pence, @ when do YOU and the rest of the Republican party end this fiasco of a presidency and restore some semblance of respectability? Guys with Nixon tattoos are swearing not to flip. It's like reality T.V. ,which makes sense. Feds case gets stronger daily.

@WalshFreedom A wall isn't going to be as effective as technology. Ever hear of an ocean? In the 80s an OCEAN wasn't an effective PHYSICAL BARRIER to prevent cartels getting drugs in. A wall is obsolete.
@WalshFreedom I like Muellers investigation. I think Trump is cooked. The federal government isn't busting all his past cronies and subordinates for nothing. They're flipping people and building a case against him. And probably making SURE that they'll secure a conviction.
@BarbaraAnnFlee2 Your commenting on a post calling a woman out about an extramarital affair. I'm pointing out that your "can do no wrong" Trump isn't exactly a choir boy. He basically admitted he slept with her.
@melintexas @prayingmedic @JimsTwitAct I'm not a hater. I liked the justice reform. He's just a horrendous role model. He mocks people. Doesn't spell check. Is impulsive as hell. Changes his mind and walks back constantly. That shows instability. He seems like he's more interested in self promotion than our country.
@1crazy_toaster @prayingmedic @JimsTwitAct Has any prez done so much business and interacting with China, Russia, and North Korea? Has any prez been a MILLIONAIRE before the presidency. He's ALL about his "brand". To him the presidency seems like just another way to promote himself. Just my opinion.
@Christi77929362 @prayingmedic @JimsTwitAct If the topic is making him out to be this great generous guy for donating 100 thousand dollars...THATS pathetic. He's a profiteer. The hundred grand is nothing. And he's super public about it. It's a p.r. move. Give it a rest.
@AOC No kidding. He LITERALLY claimed 2 different numbers 300/1000 concerning something as insignificant as cheeseburgers. It just shows that what he considers spin or pitching his "brand" is what MOST consider LYING. HIS brand and EGO are more important to him than our nation.
@prayingmedic @JimsTwitAct Dude 100 grand is peanuts to him. Especially when he's basically using the white house to maneuver himself into more profits. The guy sells coins w his head on them. It's the white house, not disneyland!
@BarbaraAnnFlee2 @Big_crusher1000 Dude, I'm neutral here but Trump supporters aren't seriously trying to play the "lack of morals" card. Surely sleeping with a porn star isn't representative of wholesome Christian beliefs.

@Celestevoix @johnpmcintyre1 @mkhammer I was making the point that most unplanned pregnancies do not occur as a result of "reproductive behavior" or however you worded it. People are lustful and are GONNA have sex. Consciously considering that pregnancy may happen doesn't always occur.
@CthulhuRules @WrathOfKhan2016 They DEFENDED gay rights and their black classmate. Of course they could have been better behaved.

@Celestevoix @johnpmcintyre1 @mkhammer It's so complicated. I tend to think what a woman does with her body is her business. And I worry about the quality of life of an unwanted kid. Or the results of attempted illegal abortions if there's no safe option available. And who PAYS for all these unplanned people?
@bigmoneydave @mkhammer Me too. I felt so dumb. Me and my righteous indignation. I DO hate those damn hats. And the school staff should have intervened. But the kids collectively booing, defending gays and the young black peer made me proud of today's youth. Pretty progressive	 Esp for Catholic kids.
@arabianhorsemen @bdogleague @MaryLShaw2 @mkhammer The black militants, who had been using slurs and hatred, threatened "They BETTER NOT touch him" as natives entered the kids ranks. A 2nd native is saying "u white people go back to europe". What are the kids supposed to do. Kiss the guys feet? He's drumming in his face!
@trianglman @mkhammer Kids defended gays and their black classmate when those black MEN (clarifying: no WOMEN with them)were using racial slurs. They THREATENED kids when phillips was entering kids ranks "They BETTER not touch HIM". Those men were harassing women, other black people, a prayer circle.
@GeraldFay @mkhammer One cited is at a basketball game their bench is holding up a 3 point sign. I do it w my 12 year old at Bucks games. Apparently it is also an old "white power" sign. Seems like a stretch. They're AT a basketball game. Idk what it's  intended as but they're AT a basketball game.

@JaysonFras @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Dude, watch ALL the videos. Kids stood up for gay rights. Stuck up for their black classmate when black mitants called him "ni#ger". Second native is saying "go back to europe" to a 2nd student. Student facing drummer tells his peer not to react. Native guy went into their group.
@realDonaldTrump You looking forward to upcoming testimony? Mwah ha ha ha haaaa!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson They are sort of off the hook. You, sir, are not.
@Prison4Trump @DrDebraJKenned2 @Z3RoForksGiven @CovCathBball @CovCathColonels @CovCathFBAlumni @CovCathFootball Chaperones DID drop the ball. But the militants video shows the guy taking video making veiled threats "yeah, they better NOT bother HIM" (native. Who btw was part of the group the militants early said "GOD took your land for worshipping totem poles". No one CARES what THEY said?
@Prison4Trump @DrDebraJKenned2 @Z3RoForksGiven @CovCathBball @CovCathColonels @CovCathFBAlumni @CovCathFootball The native came INTO their group. He walked UP TO the kid, got in his personal space, beat a drum 2 inches from his face. They are children. They probably didn't know HOW to react. Possibly thought this man was siding with the militants. Why didn't he go towards militants face?
@Prison4Trump @DrDebraJKenned2 @Z3RoForksGiven @CovCathBball @CovCathColonels @CovCathFBAlumni @CovCathFootball They were also attacked using the word "fag#ots", which they ALSO booed. And one shouted "hey, THEY are people TOO". Pretty progressive for Catholic kids to defend gay rights. The militants were using slurs and hate all day, towards the natives, a prayer circle, and THEN the kids
@Prison4Trump @DrDebraJKenned2 @Z3RoForksGiven @CovCathBball @CovCathColonels @CovCathFBAlumni @CovCathFootball I was NOT apalled. They should NOT have done the tomahawk chop. I DO NOT think they knew he was trying to diffuse the situation. Their black peer had just been referred to as a "ni#@er". Which they booed and said "THAT'S racist" and "we love you moe"(to black peer). Cont.

@VP Delta airlines honored him.
@jljacobson @gracels Were you watching the same video I was? Those men were using FAGGOTS/NIGGER/ARE YOU SMOKING THE PEACE PIPE? Also they harassed the natives earlier, a peaceful prayer circle and a black kid among the students. THAT'S preaching? Was Hitler "giving a sermon!"?
@lcathcart4596 @jljacobson They were 100% wrong to mock the native though. They get it that it's wrong to be hateful. They just need to be redirected a little.
@lcathcart4596 @jljacobson Their black classmate was referred to as NIGGER by the Israelites and you can hear them ALL COLLECTIVELY boo and individuals shout "that's racist!" And "WE love you moe!". I was proud that they stuck together booing use of the word FAGGOT too. Pretty progressive for Catholic kids
@NapoleonDantes @jljacobson YES they were. I'm embarrassed that the kids mocked the native. But they shouted "THAT'S racist" and "WE love you though moe" when the black classmate was essentially slandered. They ALL booed use of the words NIGGER and FAGGOTS. And defended gay rights "HEY,their people TOO!"
@Pathfinder4545 @jljacobson They were also bothering a prayer circle.
@Plantsmantx @jljacobson I think the Israelites cited no blacks among students. They went to get their black peer(s)and then returned, ending up closer in proximity. The "peaceful israelites" used the word NIGGER towards the black kid multiple times. And told him his friends would "harvest your organs".
@RohannenZorbia @jljacobson Wish he could talk to them and get it sorted out. Catholic kids sticking up for gays is pretty progressive. And I was proud when these supposed "hate mongers" are shouting "WE love you moe" to their black classmate when the black guys use the n word. They aren't MONSTERS.
@RohannenZorbia @Augustus709 @da_fishman Your take fucking rocks! I think they may have thought he was siding with the radical evangelists. They DEFINATELY don't appear to know he's trying to diffuse the situation.And he DID go into their crowd. They didnt swarm him.
@jlwolcott @jljacobson They were 100% wrong to mock the guy. I think they missed the fact that he was trying to diffuse the situation. People can't condemn them but then cite free speech cuz the guys saying NIGGER and FAGGOTS were black. That language is bogus NO MATTER WHO'S SAYING IT!
@MrRonJensen @jljacobson @LOLGOP Keep in mind HE walked into their group. I don't pretend to know others thoughts. They may not have known he was trying to help.  And I didn't see a bunch of hate filled vicious monsters. I see kids acting foolish, possibly cuz they didn't know HOW to respond.
@flipsville @jljacobson 100% true. The chaperones were maybe scared to intervene. There's footage recorded by one of the evangelists where the guy recording is saying "yeah, they better NOT touch him". If that type of veiled threats was going on chaperones should've gotten kids out of there.
@jljacobson @lovely1boot Booed when grown MEN used the term NIGGER. Stuck up for gay rights when MEN used the term FAGGOTS. SHOULD NOT HAVE MOCKED native. I think they know that he was trying to diffuse it. They're children. They need redirection. Not condemnation as ALL that is wrong with society.
@thejahpaul @crackers_chris Yes it is also an old Aryan nation thing. Had to google. Come on man. They're AT a basketball game in the pic! Good GOD man is this where we are at? So self righteous and bent on being indignant that we see offense in EVERYTHING once we deem people as BAD. They are misled kids
@jljacobson @lovely1boot Theyre misled kids. What good is condemning them gonna do? Make us feel superior and oh so enlightened? Compared to whom, teenagers? I hope people see that life is not black and white. I hope the kid and the native don't get ALL the frustration from right and left respectively.
@ReffnerRyan @jljacobson Didnt walk toward and get swarmed. He walked into. Kids maybe didnt understand that he was trying to help. Of COURSE they shouldnt have mocked. But their black classmate had just been called a "nigger". They booed. They also booed the use of "faggots". They're not EVIL INCARNATE
@jljacobson The native guy accomplished what he wanted. The situation diffused. I don't think it was clear to the kids that he was trying to help. The kids aren't monsters. The evangelists shouldn't use that language w kids. And the kids BOOED the words "nigger" and "faggots".They're bigots?
@jljacobson I'm mixed. I can say this. Your SOOOO hell bent on not being racist that u AUTOMATICALLY side AGAINST the white kids? If white people were saying words like FAGGOTS/NIGGER/YOU SMOKE PEACE PIPE it'd  be a HUGE issue. That shit is wrong. PERIOD. WHOEVER SAYS IT!
@jljacobson They DID not swarm. He WALKED into their group. Walked up to the kid. Drummed 2 inches from his face. Kid just stood still. And your defending the black guys cuz of freedom of speech? If the white kids were saying NIGGER/FAGGOTS/YOU SMOKING PEACE PIPE you'd want their heads.
@gumbo_goddess @fawfulfan What about the native w drummer: "go back to europe". Or black militants: "nigger/faggots/are you smoking a peace pipe?". They should NOT have mocked. But they are KIDS. Wheres the accountability for the ADULTS ON TAPE making racial comments? its okay for minorities to be racist?
@EdKrassen No. I don't think a field trip to a political event is a good idea. Maybe to observe but not openly on any side. But the kids aren't as "bigoted" as portrayed. Group of black evangelists was using "faggots" and "nigger" when addressing them. Collectively they booed it.

@JonHutson Just to be 100% clear: these "bigots" were being taunted by African American evangelists spewing hate. "Nigger" and "faggots" were used. Kids booed and replied "They are people too"(gays) and "that's racist!" And "WE love you moe"(to a black classmate after he was slurred)
@Dollarlogic @thecjpearson No problem man. Wasn't trying to seem like I was getting in a tiffy. It WAS a bit concerning that people were inquiring as to their names and addresses. People have GREAT intentions, the initial video DOES make them look like monsters.
@Dollarlogic @thecjpearson Yeah man, I know what you were doing but people who wish them I'll don't need any help identifying them. I wasn't being mean. But there's people STILL not realizing the WHOLE story. Don't want to risk their safety.

@toadmeister I despise trump. But let's not vilify ONE kid. He didn't do much but stand where he was standing BEFORE the native guy approached him.
@toadmeister Watch ALL the videos. ADULTS were using slurs like "nigger" and "faggots". Those kids booed them. The native guy walks into THEIR group. Gets in one kids personal space and beats the drum right next to his face. What did the kid do wrong? Wear a hat?

@ViveLaNessie @AngelaBelcamino @JaysonFras Did u get those videos yet? They're on my profile. The native guy i think was trying to diffuse it. Black militants are using the words FAGGOTS and NIGGER. The kids BOO all that say "They're people TOO" and "that's racist" and "we love u moe" (to black peer?)
@TawasiActivist You said it yourself. "You can't change my mind". Therein lies part of the problem. Contempt prior to investigation.
@TawasiActivist @survivor_ptsd You hate outright anyone in a MAGA hat? What then if your right, for arguments sake?: They are terrible human beings. What do u do w them? I try not to hate people. Hate BEHAVIORS. They GRASP the concept that bigotry is bad. Broaden their definition of it.
@TawasiActivist @survivor_ptsd Theyre CHILDREN. Possibly misguided, but condemning accomplishes what?  They NEED redirection. Opposing ADULTS were using "nigger" and "faggots" and "are u smoking the peace pipe?". The kids BOOED bigotry and hate. The native, i think, was initially, trying to diffuse that mess.
@TawasiActivist @survivor_ptsd These SAME kids replied to the terms FAGGOTS and NIGGER  (used toward their black classmate) with boos and "They're people TOO" and "Hey that's racist" and "we love u moe (assumably to their black peer)". I think the native guys was trying to diffuse THAT behavior. By ADULTS.

@MGFox_SCDem @mmpadellan I think he was trying to help those kids. Diffuse a situation where ADULTS were using terms like "faggots" and "nigger" towards the kids. The kids booed both terms. Pretty progressive for Catholic kids.
@solis_steve @PatriciaThom10 @AngelaBelcamino I too stand with phillips. It looks like he may have been trying to protect the kids or diffuse the situation. I was pretty proud of the American youth. Catholic beliefs are at times anti gay. They boo the term "faggots". They boo their black classmate being called a "nigger".
@reddoor2000 @nickmon1112 Yeah. And the Indian guy wasn't really wrong either if he was trying to protect the kids or diffuse it. The video of the militants is pretty unsettling. "Faggots" , "niggers", and " what're u smoking da peace pipe?" Are ALL said. And these kids boo it.
@voguemagazine @sdfashionista3 But HE enters THEIR ranks. This kid was in aways. He gets in the kids personal space. And beats the drum right in his face. I'm not saying he was wrong to try intervening. But it's not right to villify this one child. ADULTS are swearing and using slurs.
@voguemagazine @sdfashionista3 Watch ALL videos VOGUE. initially some militants are using the word FAGGOts. These CATHOLIC kids boo that and one shouts "they're people too" that's pretty progressive. Then their black classmate is called a NIGGER. They BOO THAT too. I think the native was trying to diffuse it
@girlsreallyrule @danarene9 He DID go up to the kid. And DID drum right in his face. The kid is being demonized by one side. The native by the other side. I think he may have been trying to protect the kids or diffuse the situation. The kid AND the old native make me proud. NEITHER of THEM does much wrong.
@girlsreallyrule @danarene9 There's OTHER videos. The black protesters refer to their black classmate as a"nigger" which they BOO. He brings gays into it and uses the term "faggots". The kids boo that too and one shouts "They're people too".
@Brasilmagic @danarene9 Watch ALL the videos. It starts when ANOTHER group is using the terms FAGGOTS and NIGGER and WHATTYA SMOKING THE PEACE PIPE. The kids boo both slurs and reply "They're people TOO" and "THAT'S racist". I think the native guy was trying to protect the kids maybe.
@QuancyClayborne @danarene9 Referring to the protest kids?
@realDonaldTrump Source? Are we embellishing, misleading, or creating here? Or was your approval rating among Hispanics: 2 approved of you ,and now it's 3? THAT IS a 50 percent increase.
@jimsciutto Watch all the videos. The kids WERE wrong for tomahawk chop mocking. But before the natives even on scene they are being berated w slurs "faggots"and "nigger" are used. They BOO both slurs. I think the native guy was trying to stop them from being harassed.
@realDonaldTrump Yes! You are a gem! Global warming is a wonderful solution to most short term problems with your dislike for today's weather! You heard it here ladies and gentleman! We could really use a little global warming.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @SusanaDee @all_my_relation Yeah. I DEFINATELY agree with that statement. To much extremism in either direction isn't helpful to anyone.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @SusanaDee @all_my_relation I think from all the videos that the natives may have initially went over there to STOP this extreme extremist from continuing to verbally attack the kids. Slurs have no place anywhere in any context.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @SusanaDee @all_my_relation Wow. There's ANOTHER clip where the same guy using the word "nigger" is lecturing the kids about "faggots". These kids boo BOTH words. U can hear "They're people TOO" about the homosexual slur. And " WE love ya mo" in response to their classmate being called a slur.
MAGA kids booing when being lectured that "You give FAGGOTS rights". They are modern kids. They KNOW it's b.s. to gay bash. Even as catholics. https://t.co/F4CnVaKCss

@Aidan_Little94 Wow, he's a child. The drummer walked INTO their group. Up to the kid. Into his personal space. Beat a drum next to his face. Increased the volume at which he was chanting. Kid just held his ground. In another video a black MAGA group kid is called a "nigger" by other protesters
@SPECFORD59 @HannahHakodesh @williamlegate It BETTER be protected. He's a kid. Regardless WHAT color he is. It's against the law to reveal his identity.
@eladiapingina @MeritLaw They're kids. They can be redirected, should've been by staff. "Mo" or "kanye" is what they refer to him as in the video. And someone affectionately yells "WE love ya" after he's called a nigger and told that his friends will harvest his organs. THATS a crappy way to treat a kid.

@quintabrunson School staff is responsible too. I'm calling our archbishop on monday. Already tried calling school. It embarrasses me and should bother all Catholics.
@quintabrunson Watch the rest of the video. Native guy approaches him. Another video where a black kid in the MAGA group is called a "nigger". Not by the native man though. The "tomahawk chop" is offensive and they are mocking. But they're kids. I'd rather redirect them than crucify them.
@SusanaDee @DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation High ranking Catholics have already come out about this. The adult LEADERSHIP is MOST accountable in my opinion. Im calling our archbishop monday. And the school.I'm far from hateful. I'm mixed. These kids are our future whether we like it or not. They just need redirection.
@SusanaDee @DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Mockingly doing "tomahawk chop"=100% wrong. But If you watch the videos you see that the guy drumming walks up to the boy. Into his personal space. The kid looks nervous. Then the guy puts the drum awfully close to his face. And starts chanting a bit louder. Kid just stands there
@ViveLaNessie @AngelaBelcamino @JaysonFras Yeah hang on.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation My son is my only child.😊
@in_pubs I don't think the vet was necessarily in the wrong. He DID approach the kid, enter his personal space, and then beat the drum right next to his face. The kid isn't the monster he's being made out to be. And other protesters were calling a black MAGA kid "nigger".
@Blacklace40 @sdfashionista3 He's kwazy
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Btw way, there was a gay male who had attended that school tweeting about having been bullied. I apologized to him on behalf of Catholics. I truly believe the FIRST rule is to be kind. Let God judge people. The world is plenty cruel on its own, it doesn't need any help.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Yeah. My sons just getting to where he likes girls. Told me and my mom the other day non chalantly that he thinks sex is gross but he wants a son. So he's only gonna EVER have it once. I asked what if he decided he wanted more than one kid and he replied " maybe I'll have twins"
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Yeah he's a much much better person than me. Lol. Best thing that I ever did. By far.
@AngelaBelcamino @JaysonFras I stand in solidarity with both people. But also with the young man. Vet walked up to him, into his personal space, beat the drum right next to his face. Kid did nothing. Also other video shows a black MAGA student being called "nigger". Where's teachers? I'm praying for all.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Yes for sure. Thats why im not big on trump. Oftentimes, hes not very nice. My boy was a "bully buster" at school. And even THEN he was trained to be nice about it. "Kindness is my religion"- Dali lama. Love that quote and it doesn't conflict w my beliefs. At all.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation I worry that the kids are being used. Yeah it totally lines up w Catholic beliefs, but how many kids would be concerned enough to be there on their own. Abortion is a heavy issue. Not 100% even sure where I stand all the time. Kids shouldn't have to be involved. Let em be kids.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Oh definately. I don't like his behavior. Mocking people's accents and the disabled. The "grab em by the.." isn't the MOST concerning part of that convo either. Before that " I don't even wait, I just kiss em. They let u when your a star. You can do anything" bad leader.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Must've been. And the guy actually calling this poor black kid a slur is standing next to another African American male. Who does nothing.There's a few different clips. Its really confusing. The teachers should've intervened.
@pattonoswalt Watch the other videos. Kids were wrong for sure. But the native vet walks up to the kid, enters his personal space, then drums right next to his face. Other people call one of the MAGA kids (black) a nigger. It's NOT all it seems. Where's the teachers?
@andrewkimmel @pattonoswalt @ka_ya11 Watch the rest of this video. The MAGA kids have a black peer. People call him a "nigger". And in the REST of the 1st video, you see clearly the native enters the boys personal space and then drums right in his face. Vet walks up to the kid. Kids were wrong. But not the only 1s.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation DEFINATELY not. The STAFF really should have intervened. My son went to a Catholic school. Idk how I even feel about kids being at a political event period! At least with school. W parents maybe but.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation I am NOT justifying their mocking natives. But the video where the black student is slurred is harsh. If the kids are judging ALL opposition protesters cumulatively, the mocking makes a bit more sense. STILL doesn't line up w MY beliefs.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation I'm praying for all invoved. Me and you as well. And our country. ALL of us. Hey, they ALL https://t.co/jQkWKvB9GJ was a freedom of expression high point. And no physical violence.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Yeah. I dig that. But the kid really is unjustly being villified. Hopefully the native vet doesn't let that happen if he's righteous. He DEFINATELY enters the kids PERSONNAL space. And he's WAY in his face w the drum. The other videos don't show all that.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Watching it, the native vet w drum doesn't necessarily have to be doing anything wrong. But he does get right in the kids face. And the kid was completely NOT the one who approached. It was vice versa.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation I think I just tweeted it. The kids DEFINATELY shouldn't have been allowed to mock the natives. But the natives walked INTO the group of kids. The guy gets pretty close to the kids face w the drum too. And their classmate had been called the n word.

@kurteichenwald Watch the OTHER videos. I hate trump. And these kids should NOT be mocking the native guy. But the other videos SHOW a whole different situation. Black student called a "nigger". Native walks up to THEM. Beats drum inches from kids face.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation He goes up to the kid. Beating a drum in his face and chanting loudly. Inches from the kids face. And there's another video where another group is calling an African American student a "nigger". These kids weren't the aggressors. Where is the school staff?
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation Watch the video.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation I'm embarassed. I was raised catholic. I don't condone the kids mockingly making "tomahawk chop" sounds. School staff should've done something. But the other videos show a DRASTICALLY different side.
@viscerale1 @TravisAllen02 @LeaHaller55 Watch the OTHER videos. A black student was called a "nigger" by someone. And the native vet very clearly walks into the group of students, beats the drum RIGHT in the kids face. He just holds his ground. School staff should've intervened.
I am bewildered at how the OTHER videos of the MAGA kids and the native vet aren't being circulated.
@mindykaling I saw dances w wolves with my 5th grade class. It won a bunch of awards didnt it?
@DrDebraJKenned2 @all_my_relation This behavior isn't acceptable, the "tomahawk chop" mocking. But the other videos show CLEARLY that the native fellow approached the boy. And beat the drum right in his face. The kid just held his ground. And someone was calling a black student a "nigger".wheres school staff?
@all_my_relation @GhostWolf1964 Watch the OTHER videos. Someone is calling one of the black students a "nigger". Then in another the native guy walks up to the kids. CLEARLY. And the kid just stands his ground. The guys beating the drum right in his face. School staff should've intervened.
@Gina1973E Watch the OTHER videos. One of the black students appears to have been called a "nigger". And CLEARLY the native gentleman walks up to the boy. And is beating the drum in his face. Assumably trying to scare the kid. The school staff should've intervened.

And whose calling that other kid a "nigger"? If the one group was doing that, were the "tomahawk chop" chants retaliation?

@macduckworth Maybe your negative experience and the native gentlemans, will have a positive effect. These kids may grow up, feel bad, and a few of them may show kindness to other people, recalling how ashamed and guilty they felt when they realized their errors. Not ALL. But a few maybe.
@macduckworth Those young men, and even more so the adult leadership at that school, are not very GOOD catholics. At least not in my opinion. No one is perfect. Hopefully these young men will sort things out. Perhaps ,down the road, your post will move someone to feel bad for past actions.
@macduckworth Romans 1: mentions homosexual acts. It's very funny though when people cite that. Romans 2: begins: therefore you have no excuse,o man, everyone of you who judges. For in passing judgement on another you condemn yourself.

@TheRealUbboUbbo @jimsciutto Absolutely. Other day, for no apparent reason, he asks Barr if TRUMP was a "one page guy" regarding how Barr wrote according to the attention span of his reader. Barr laughs "yes, I would imagine he is". Why'd Lindsey ask that? Trump wasn't even being discussed. Done w Trump too?
@sainttoad @jimsciutto I think , honest to goodness, that no one can openly attack Trump. But, if you've been watching, some of Grahams line of questioning would seem counterintuitive to Trumps image and best interest. He KNOWS what he's doing. EVERYBODY is tiring of this fiasco.
@GeneralHealthy @jimsciutto Lol
@jimsciutto The other day. Graham: what about trump, is HE a one page guy? Barr: huh?(making sure he heard the question correctly, then laughing says:) yes, I would imagine he is.

@rufus04080965 @mrstraug1 @odonnell_r A wall is not an effective way to stop ANYONE from entering. We can do it cheaper and more effectively with TECHNOLOGY. And do u know what PER capita means? If your concern is sex crimes, police safety, drugs, and violence, start HERE!
@mrstraug1 @rufus04080965 @odonnell_r Immigration is at a low. "pouring in" is relative. But IF it applies, IMMIGRANTS are pouring in. NOT rapists, murderers, drug kingpins, etc. Thats the TRUTH.
@rufus04080965 @mrstraug1 @odonnell_r You just cited 5 specific cases of immigrants committing crimes. That averages out to a billion a criminal had a WALL stopped them. I know that there's more.

@rufus04080965 @mrstraug1 @odonnell_r Of those 17,000 how many peoples ONLY crime was ENTERING THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY? I'm just saying, it's not the situation that he is presenting it as. More crime is committed by AMERICAN born citizens than immigrants. Without question. Call it what it is.

@HayMinister @whatside @wwjoehd @charliekirk11 I was offended as a football fan. And a father. Ive never been to the white house. If my kid got invited and all dressed up to go, I'd want more for him than fast food. Plus he barely spoke to them in the clip. A wall pitch, pointing OUT that he paid, then walked off. No class.
@damian_ferry You WANT to be offended and indignant. People incorrectly and unfairly attempt to dismiss her as a waitress. (She tended bar).I was pointing THAT out, along with how threatened some seem to feel by this "mere waitress".In your lust to be offended and chivalrous u missed my point.

@SageThinker99 @ScottWalker Monsanto is a GREAT example of a corporation becoming conscienceless. Maximum profit became more and more of a priority,til it was the ONLY one.

@SageThinker99 @ScottWalker I am of the mind that capitalism drives progress through competition. Coke is delicious cuz it's gotta be better than pepsi. It's works in that sense.

@ScottWalker You de-socialized the planet's freshwater supply and our workforce. You allowed a foreign company to contaminate our water supply. You waived EPA rules. You promised what you knew would not be delivered. You tricked people. Turd.
@ScottWalker The problem with capitalism is that it works. But we have to govern it in such a way that PROFIT isn't the only thing considered. Aren't other states or city's or the EPA ,like, suing us now cuz you whored out the great lakes?
@ScottWalker To 5th graders "See lake michigan? That's right kids, its part of the largest deposit of freshwater on earth. I let foreign companies break EPA pollution rules, for personal political gain" How much did it cost to have a "FOXCONN" tattoo removed from your lil tushie?
@ScottWalker Show them ten million singles, and what that looks like. 5th graders would comprehend "See THIS heap of money? After you have THIS MUCH its still okay to want MORE. But after you have THIS much, then, we want to donate 7 out of every ten dollars to help people with less than us"
@ScottWalker Economics to my son in "matchbox cars". "I'll pay you 3 matchbox cars to pick up the sticks before we mow the lawn". See these TEN dump trucks full of matchbox cars? Since you have SO many, we can donate some AFTER we have TEN trucks full. If you only have $10 , it doesn't apply.

@washingtonpost " is the PRESIDENT a one page guy?" Barr: laughing " yes, I imagine he is"
@pirateprty4usa @BritishNHS99 Well in this numbskulls opinion, it stinks. One person, one vote. Makes more sense to me.
Yess! Confirmation hearings right now. Lindsey graham to nominee for atty general william barr when barr is explaining how he considers his audience when deciding how lengthy documents should be: and what about trump? Is he a one page guy? Barr: (laughing) yes, I suspect he is!
@pirateprty4usa It's a relic. It's counterproductive now. It impunes what the majority  opinion is.
@pirateprty4usa @BritishNHS99 AND a REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. Read that. What YOU just posted. It's both.
@realDonaldTrump Good morning there sir. What's for breakfast with all the staff furloughed? Mcgriddles?
@realDonaldTrump You are in a position to speak on behalf of "the rank and file of the F.B.I." ? Have F.B.I. personnel TOLD you that they are disgusted with their ranking officers? That would be a big no no for them to be impuning their superiors with the target of ongoing investigations.truth.
@Manid92461146 @OutFrontCNN @CNN Really bad.
@Gabby74569273 @OutFrontCNN @CNN He served them a fast food buffet. At the whithouse. It was probably one of the biggest days of their lives and their host served them hamburgers. I'd have got them some steaks.
@aj_pittam @OutFrontCNN @CNN I'm not offended. It just lame. They're college kids who just won the national championship. Some sports teams have declined his invites. They came. He could've got them some steaks. It was probably one of the biggest days of their lives.
@GEMstockfinder @OutFrontCNN @CNN Serving hamburgers in the white house is decent? This was one of the biggest days of their lives. He served them fast food cheeseburgers.
@nmrican @OutFrontCNN P.s. that bama as in alabama.
@nmrican @OutFrontCNN Im taking jabs at anyone who doesnt respect the national football champs, who just slammed bama, enough to NOT serve them fast food at the damn white house. None of his STAFF thought better?
@ClemsonFB I wouldn't expect a university to make any statement that could POSSIBLY be interpreted as criticizing our president. But you guys just slammed bama and won the national championship. Congrats. I would have hustled you up some steaks!
@RAGarcia1492 @OutFrontCNN @CNN I'm a little embarassed. They're a bunch of college kids who just won the national championship and got to visit the whitehouse. They were served fast food? Class act this MILLIONAIRE is.
@realDonaldTrump I'm not being mean here. But did you ever see "the burbs" with Tom hanks? And his extremely socially awkward neighbor improvs while hosting. He serves them pretzels and sardines...right from the tin. You are comedy gold!
@realDonaldTrump Dude, you are a terrible host. Even if ALL the white house staff was furloughed, don't serve a fast-food cheeseburger buffet at the whitehouse. Was 7/11 out of spam?

@josephmagazine1 @RashidaTlaib @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump There are multiple sides to every situation. We can at least consider the other side.

@Buckeye4Ever45 @RashidaTlaib @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump Refusing to fund basic infrastructure because of ONE issue is equivalent to ransoming basic functions of our government in society. There's never going to be a wall. At least not under Trump. It would set a precedent.
@deborahriccio2 @SenWhitehouse @TheJusticeDept What rational person justifies illegal activity by citing other supposedly illegal activity? If it's IRREFUTIBLE that Trump broke laws, if he ADMITS it, THEN will u still support him?

@realDonaldTrump Your bluffing. If they're calling, it's to try talking you into funding government. Your trying to bluff the senators and Congress people into thinking that SOME are caving, in hopes that others will too? Come on big fella, they do this for a LIVING. Rookie.

@Giovann36162662 @stephens_ben @realDonaldTrump There's interesting interpretive arguments that a sitting president CAN be indicted. I think he'll step down. He'd be crazy NOT to. Whether he was manipulated or consciously acted is gonna make a difference. But I'm sure that if he's gotta be FORCED out prosecutors will be harsh.

Then, to himself: "ah yes, Donald j, ANOTHER shining success!"
@realDonaldTrump "Chill" is NOT what you are. It shows even in your behavior. Lock yourself in the oval office and think "shit. SHIT. SHIT!" much? Were they convincing and persuasive, and your "gut" told you to believe them? it's okay. You made a mistake. I BELIEVE u love our country. Come clean.

@WhiteHouse He's either going to resign or be impeached. There is irrefutable documentation and you guys know it. Full cooperation from Russian businesses, possibly even government, is inevitable. Get him leashed and have him step down. I imagine it'll be considered when he's prosecuted.
@realDonaldTrump Commander in chief, turns out that you ARE NOT Reagan. Your Nixon. Stand down and step down. You broke the LAW. It is irrefutably provable via documents from your ex associates. You won't be able to scapegoat anyone. Leniency will be granted to you, if you resign
@realDonaldTrump 12 tweets in just under 4 hrs. Your stressing about something. Get a call from some legal minds whom you CAN'T fire or ignore? Bad news Mr president?
@smithey812 @realDonaldTrump No. Getting https://t.co/FNWZeSRjZq. Lots of tweeting going on.
@Gulfwarvetsrule @realDonaldTrump "Yay, Mr president! Grope MY genitals! Let's communicate to our youth what a role model should look like.yaay!"
@realDonaldTrump Your worried about something. Discovering that your Russian cohorts aren't quite as willing to keep their mouths closed as you'd hoped? The might of our federal government is intimidating, can't blame them. It was either YOU or THEM. Cooperation was inevitable.
@realDonaldTrump Your tweeting up a storm. Something's amiss. Bad news from the lawyers, mister president?
@realDonaldTrump Fund the government. Basic normal infrastructure isnt a bargaining chip."i was not born to be FORCED"- Henry David Thoreau. Do u leave your home naked, cuz you dont have socks?The Wall represents a mindset. One that would literally alter the planet physically and mentally.
@realDonaldTrump You too could solve the shutdown, sir. By discontinuing your insistence on tying all issues into your precious wall. You are attempting to permanently alter the landscape and mindset of our entire planet. No sir, I don't believe one man will be permitted to FORCE that upon us.
@realDonaldTrump You, sir, with all due respect ( which in my opinion isn't much), are no where near clever enough to play anything resembling the espionage game. You are far too easily persuaded by convincing speech. You were duped and manipulated. Against your countries interests.
@realDonaldTrump Twittering an awful lot this morning Mr president. Coffee? Redbull? Out of meds? Typically your angry and retaliating when u tweet alot. What's wrong? Nervous about potentially damaging business records? If it's between u or them, u will quickly find that your Russian friends RAT
@AOC THIS is now quickly becoming a humanitarian crisis. Domestically made. Our president needs to fund government. 1st things 1st.
@realDonaldTrump That's only because you must be counting INS holds as "inmates". Ins is federal too. I get it. That's clever of you but misleading. 20% of inmates in federal CORRECTIONAL institutions , for crime, are NOT immigrants. Lots of tweets this morning. Coffee? Redbull? Mental health?
@jameswadehumor @EridanusFive @nytimes Just because something doesn't always work exactly as planned, doesnt mean u shouldnt try. It's GONNA sound real cliche, real idealist, and real hallmarkish, but I don't care. I'm real proud of the ideals my country represents. We CAN express varying opinions here online.
@jameswadehumor @EridanusFive @nytimes 15 years from now I imagine our entire planet will be drastically different. I'm not smart enough to even ATTEMPT to predict it.
@jameswadehumor @danzu72 @nytimes I'm not arguing cuz life is too short. Are you gonna sleep better if I say your right.
@jameswadehumor @EridanusFive @nytimes Really? I beg to differ. But that's okay. We can agree to disagree.
@jameswadehumor @danzu72 @nytimes You seem to just want to argue. And that's okay. Good evening sir.
@jameswadehumor @EridanusFive @nytimes Im 41. And I assure you that I hear your points. China has a large army. We have a highly trained military, highly technogically superior. Along with the best intelligence network on the planet. Say what you'd like. Also ex military private contractors fill in our soft spots.
@jameswadehumor @Austenouttaten @sdfashionista3 @nytimes I'm not advocating toppling regimes. I'm advocating ensuring the safety of Kurds who aligned themselves w us and are now at risk without our support. I didn't necessarily say we had to fight. Asylum is an option. Like our allies from vietnam.
@EridanusFive @nytimes We don't have things all THAT f-ed up.
@EridanusFive @nytimes kids on t.v. who are so emaciated  they look like skeletons. Bloated bellies filled w fluid and gases. U.n. has specially formulated peanut butter cuz at first their stomachs reject nourishment. U put any human anywhere in the u.s. in that state, it'll stop traffic.
@Austenouttaten @sdfashionista3 @nytimes Enforcing human rights laws IS a virtue. My values just so happen to line up.
@ekmngrlz @CristobalJAlex @AOC @politico Exactly, if she needs a little help getting acclimated to being in the public spotlight, and having her every word and action scrutinized, people, hopefully at least other WOMEN from both sides, could welcomingly and supportively encourage her and offer tips and insight.
@realDonaldTrump Impossible to stop it COLD. That's a kitschy sounding phrase though. " stop them COLD!". You are not batman, you are our president. Speak like it. Act like it. If a wall would do much, it might SLOW, how much is arguable, the flow of unwanteds.
@Austenouttaten @sdfashionista3 @nytimes Defending people's rights to NOT have their genitals mutilated, to be ALLOWED an education, and to have freedom to express ideas IS a virtue. Those are forms of oppression meant to keep people more easily controllable.
@Austenouttaten @PaulieMoyer @nytimes @Morning_Joe He also said he would NOT protect them.
@pdubb_22 @nytimes I don't feel the need to risk our soldiers over EVERY any ANY situation. But the kurds placed a target on their backs when they allied w us. It'll hurt our future military endeavors if people are scared to help us.
@Austenouttaten @sdfashionista3 @nytimes Your right man. We should mind our own business. Women and ethnic and political minorities SHOULDN'T be educated. Women don't really NEED their clitoris. Freedom of speech and the concept of letting people hear all sides and decide for themselves is overated. Core values. Get em
@DanielWilliamD7 @nytimes @Morning_Joe An unstable globe is a national security threat. Wars are GONNA happen. You want em here or at their place of origin?
@RepublicGeordie @J_D_2019 @nytimes Military people don't MURDER anyone. Don't do THAT. Killing people when it needs to happen is serious unfortunate business. Vets have insanely high suicide rates. Let's refrain from labeling their state sanctioned actions as "murder". Your dangerous man. Be nice.
@jameswadehumor @danzu72 @nytimes My opinion is that it was 11 years ago. What was your opinion on the French revolution.
@RepublicGeordie @The_Lone_Apple @nytimes Are you on meds? Passive aggressive much? You BET HE WONT, I see that. But I'll hazard a guess that if ya DOUBLE DAWG DARED him, he would. Lol. Take it easy pal. It's NOT that serious.
@RepublicGeordie @The_Lone_Apple @nytimes I DONT hate him. The justice reform was great for all. You die hard Trump butt kissers are so good at labeling anyone who may not 100% agree w ALL he says, that you hop immediately to conclusions and address individuals cumulatively as if they are one entity.
@RepublicGeordie @MBoyus @nytimes @Morning_Joe I'm not pro war. I'm pro human rights. And I'm pro "don't abandon your allies." Want another bin laden?
@Austenouttaten @PaulieMoyer @nytimes @Morning_Joe It's not the opposite. He backed off and said he would SLOW the withdrawal. His plans and stances change by the hour. That's not good policy. That NOTHING he says can be relied upon to be the same tommorrow. Just like the dismembering of a journalist. He talked but did nothing.
@veteranwhite @nytimes He " knows MORE than the generals, trust me!" Remember? Lol. Trust him.yeah right.
@pdubb_22 @nytimes What about Kurds who helped us? The Turkish govt openly expressed that they won't protect kurds.
@jeffwills08 @ShariCardenas @nytimes He doesn't need the quarter million dollar salary. He has used his presidency to maneuver in favor of his businesses and best PERSONNAL interest.
@Austenouttaten @sdfashionista3 @nytimes What if they aren't equipped to fight for them? I didn't say to FORCE anything. You think WOMEN shouldn't be educated? You think that they don't WANT to be. People who want to keep people ignorant want to keep them more easily controlled.
@pdubb_22 @nytimes I honestly don't know enough about why we were in Syria to begin with. But we SHOULDN'T just abandon people who allied w us. Especially since the Turkish govt SAID they'd let them be slaughtered.
@WISN12News "What me worry?"
@washingtonpost I want tasteful nude photos of Trump.  Throw a little lipstick on him. Put him in a pair of boy shorts with "make AOC great again" silk screened across the tush. Maybe he's seductively tugging at his bottom lip. THEN I'd support his wall. Lol. Why are they so threatened by her?
@seanhannity Add them to the list of TOTAL deaths by firearms. They are a minute percentage. We NEED to slow immigration. But don't try and cloud the issue. Native born citizens with illegally obtained guns account for way more deaths. Misleading or putting on a spin does your cause injustice
@Austenouttaten @EridanusFive @nytimes The idea that we SHOULD fight injustice before it spreads STOPPED hitler! We waited too long to get involved THEN.
@Austenouttaten @sdfashionista3 @nytimes Allowing injustice anywhere on the planet, blatant violation of basic human rights like education, would make us equally culpable. Plus it would spread. Would u rather have fought Hitler on our soil?
@jameswadehumor @EridanusFive @nytimes China may be in contention as far as financial dominance goes. I'm talking about more important things like human rights and freedom of thought and expression.
@EridanusFive @nytimes I hear ya,but there's gotta be a happy medium. We can't just leave the world at the mercy of people who have no conception of freedom and who centralize power. The fact that we are allowed to disagree and hear one another leads to progress. Freedom of ideas. Education for all.
@WartHogBlues @nytimes @TeaTramRussia That type of policy BRED bin laden. TRAINED bin laden. We helped certain people fight the Russians in afghanistan, then left them screwed. Decades later it bit us on the ass. Do you honestly believe that u.s. trained and funded individuals NEVER killed ISIS members?
@GoodloveRev @nytimes @ken_crichlow In places on this planet, women, the poor, and opposing political parties aren't desired to be educated. I don't want to miss the cure for cancer or energy solutions cuz someone wasn't educated. Humans are plenty foolish on our own. No one NEEDS to be oppressed. We fight THAT.
@sdfashionista3 @nytimes They did. He doesn't listen to anyone. His hats shouldn't say "m.a.g.a" they should say " let's ONLY worry about America for now, and we will have to deal w bigger problems, possibly on OUR soil, later". Were supposed to be an example to the world. Not pretend we live in a bubble
@EridanusFive @nytimes I'd rather fix the WORLD in their backyard. Before the problems end up in our FRONT yard. Take the fight to them. Before they bring it here. Women deserve equal rights globally. Not women, ALL humans. Anyone who oppresses is against my beliefs.
@SylvieDParris @nytimes 100% correct.
@WartHogBlues @nytimes @TeaTramRussia Who will protect the kurds who sided w the u.s.? Turkey openly expressed, that turkey wont. Kurds helped us fight ISIS. We are gonna hang them out to dry.THATS bad policy. It'll make others reluctant to side w us in the future.
@pdubb_22 @nytimes Name calling unquestioning die hard Trump supporters not in "3,2,1," but ,apparently now. Come on man. I'm not any form of a tard. Or a war monger. I don't know ANYTHING w 100% certainty, and I'm open minded. Convince me. Civil discussion is whats needed.
@AOC Technically, he's correct. She ISN'T the future. She is a CURRENT congresswoman. She's fresh thoughts and new ideas. She is a bit bubbly and enthusiastic at times. That's probably not a bad thing. She's young. The world hasn't yet dampened her spirit of optomism. That's GOOD!
@realDonaldTrump What? We lose 300 Americans a week, 90% of which comes through the southern border? Is that 300 lost to overdoses? 90% of drugs? You confuse me. Do we lose them to emigration to mexico? Are you changing tacts? Is the wall now to keep people IN?
@letsgomathias @AOC Lol. Tis true tis true
@AOC Don't waste your time trying to explain yourself to people who are determined to dislike you.

@Big_crusher1000 @zhengbaiting @V_Newt84 @ABC Trump and his supporters have tied ALL issues to one. The Wall has NOTHING to do with funding the government. It's a siege of infrastructure, not "standing firm". You don't leave the house completely nude simply cuz you have no socks do you?
@Big_crusher1000 @zhengbaiting @V_Newt84 @ABC Illegals CAN'T drain resources that they legally have no access to. Crime is overwhelmingly committed by native born people, not immigrants. Drugs are GONNA get in. Ever hear of Florida in the 80s? Are you gonna wall off the ocean? Or the air?
@realDonaldTrump Do you leave your house naked simply because you have no socks? The Wall which there is no agreement on has nothing to do with paying employees. Fund the government. You can't AGREE that the govt needs funding? You are basing ALL issues on one.
@SenatorCardin @SenateGOP Don't make ALL issues contingent upon ONE issue. I don't leave my home naked simply because I have no clean socks. Employees need to be paid. Obviously there is no agreement on the wall. The issues are unrelated.
@VP @POTUS Fund the government. You are not "standing firm". You are attempting to make ALL issues contingent upon ONE issue. Obviously there is no agreement on the wall. Employees need to be paid. Can we agree on THAT? I don't leave my house nude simply because I don't have clean socks.
@realDonaldTrump That is an obtuse and possibly misleading statement. It implies. It does not state clear facts. With all due respect sir, commander in chief, do not misrepresent facts.
@bmira29 @CNN Starch turns into sugar, which causes diabetes. Are you trying to tell me that you support diabetes?
@freep @RashidaTlaib THAT'S fake news. Collusion is not. Individuals posing as minority women attempting to manipulate public opinion is FACT. Russian money paid for THAT type of fake news. Whoever AIDED or KNEW colluded. And will be indicted.
@realDonaldTrump Measure twice cut once.
@CNN That's what we need. A better economy and more jobs via COAL. And velocipedes.
RT @Ali_H_Soufan: 53 journalists killed while doing their job in 2018. 		348 journalists were being detained at the end of 2018.		Just five…
@marcorubio Amen. "I do not pray that God is on my side. I carry myself in such a way that I know I am on his." God WILL fix this mess. God elevates. The Lord giveth. And the Lord taketh away.
@parscale Want some stats on crime?Look at ALL of ANY crime. ANYWHERE. Now see how many of the offenders were illegals. It's a small percentage. Domestic born people are mostly responsible. It's NOT an effective way to lower crime rates. Dont say its to lower crime. More effective ways.
@realDonaldTrump "They've gone totally bonkers" said the pot to the kettle.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President , don't forget to thank ALL law enforcement personnel. Investigators, prosecutors, field agents, local, state, FEDERAL. I'm thankful for them ALL. Aren't you?!
@realDonaldTrump At least they were honest with you. They could have just PROMISED you a bunch of nonsense that they couldn't actually deliver. Wink wink. Don't worry about this whole shutdown thing, I heard MEXICO is going to pay for the federal government employees payroll.nyuck nyuck.jk.
@PressSec @marcthiessen I dislike him. But , truth be told, he at least wasn't ranting. I assume SOMEONE trained him to read a prompter. And that indicates to me that POSSIBLY he has become willing to LISTEN to some of the people around him. Overall, it's progress.
@SenTedCruz @POTUS I'm just glad he didn't try his state of emergency ploy.
@Steiger130 @tribelaw I thought they were medals. The u.s. armed forces must have given him the hallowed "I couldn't fight, my daddy's doctor says I have bone splints" award. Very distinguished.
@SenatorCardin @POTUS But hey, Donnie boy, what does the DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION know about drugs? Lol. Facts are what matter.

@DebraDuvendeck @JudicialWatch Technically most resigned because he disregarded their advice anyway, correct? But he had been openly criticizing them prior. "I know more about ISIS than the generals, trust me."
@maziehirono @realDonaldTrump How can people who claim to be conservative or Christian support a man whose behavior would warrant a reprimand if exhibited by CHILDREN?! He lacks either the decency or the sense to know that people shouldn't be mocked, groped, and lied to.
@JudicialWatch We do not KNOW what Intel bergdahl posessed. HE may not have even known. I'd bet President Obama LISTENED to the advice of his well educated, well informed, and highly experienced military and intelligence advisers. Trump should LISTEN instead of firing those who disagree w him
@SenatorLeahy When they are "making adjustments" without a paycheck,  what, do tell, are they supposed to adjust? How many MEALS they eat per day?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I hope that the word crisis is not being used as a precursor and synonym for the word emergency. It will not go over well, i would be willing to bet. Wall supporters, the extremist ones, openly seem to welcome an opportunity for violence. Don't give either side an excuse.
@realDonaldTrump Oh no. Your use of the word "crisis" leads me to wonder if you are using it as a synonym for "state of emergency". I IMPLORE you, don't do it. I would hope our military intelligence is informing you that there will be the potential for open revolt, from both sides, if you do that
@Truleelovelee @realDonaldTrump Mike Pence for president! NOW! Anyone is better than THIS fiasco
@jgeary_books @realDonaldTrump Yeah, ya welcher! Your a MULTIPLE time offender welcher actually!
@realDonaldTrump Give it a whirl, see how well it works out for you. Your mental health would end up being declared a state of emergency. Possibly by your own party.
@ACLUVA You are a great example that ANYONE can become ANYTHING here in America. Immigrants, little girls, muslims...it SHOWS them that this truly is the land of opportunity and "the pursuit of happiness". The more diverse government is, the better, in my opinion.
@IlhanMN She probably shouldn't have sworn.But she was excited. Her CHILD asked her basically " why is the world so messed up?" If my boy asked me why the PRESIDENT behaves like that, and goes unchecked, I too might want to strongly convey that I would get HIM. She was conveying emotion.
@IlhanMN Harmful rhetoric? " I don't even wait. I just kiss em. And they let you when your a star. You can do ANYTHING! Grab em by the pussy!" THAT'S harmful rhetoric. Cuz it propagates and glorifies a CONCEPT, an IDEAL, that is harmful.
@reallyfastg @212Griffon @realDonaldTrump Yeah, why should we worry about GLOBAL issues that affect the entirety of the human race? It's MUCH MUCH better to think short-term. Especially if there's a chance to save buck in it for us. I'm glad we have a profiteer in the oval office who's willing to disregard mankind.
@realDonaldTrump 93% ? Who did you poll? Your kids? No one has THAT high of approval ratings. State FACTS. Some of what you say is 100% valid. You enable people to invalidate you because you don't speak VERIFIABLE facts. You embellish and mislead. Your military pay raise was good. But not 10%.
@RashidaTlaib Congratulations!
@CNN People applaud Trump for behavior that we, as a civilized society, would reprimand children for.
@realDonaldTrump Impeachment or resignation is inevitable. If your lawyers aren't telling you that, fire them.
@CNN Since when does HE worry about looking foolish?
@realDonaldTrump Where are you getting that 99% stat? Ever hear of a tunnel,an ocean, or a ladder? I highly doubt anything even remotely resembling 99% is realistically attainable. By ANY means. U invalidate ANYTHING you say when you embellish. I agree w SOME of what you say. It's HOW you say it.
@realDonaldTrump You are too much! Lol. That look is a hoot. Didja practice that in the mirror "are YOU talkin to me? Are you talking to ME? I don't see anybody else, so you must be talkin to me!"
@realDonaldTrump Probably it's not.
@realDonaldTrump Law breakers are gonna do as they please. Regardless of laws or walls. I 100% agree with your statement. Unfortunately, our socialized system can't afford to support EVERYONE who wants to come here.But a wall is not an effective solution to stop unwanteds.and JUST unwanteds.
@realDonaldTrump Prove your point with facts. Convince me. 1980s cartels simply factored in how many boats would get caught and then sent extra boats. If an ocean wasn't an effective physical deterrent why would a wall be? Tunnels. Trucks with ramps. Ladders. Drones. Forged documents.

@Dohknutty @seungminkim @costareports @agearan Pence should oust Trump. There is no precedence legally. But he is commander in chief of the military. I believe, from THAT angle, there might be legal grounds for a subordinate to bring into question his ability to act in the best interest of our nation.
@doctordrewl @AOC See how that works? You are supporting a guy who openly used the word "pussy"whilst expressing, nay, GLORIFYING a pretty unsettling concept. You are seriously playing the "potty mouth" card?
@doctordrewl @AOC Words, in and of themselves are not offensive. I could see a friend, embracing him " you mother fucker, how are ya?!". Ideas are offensive. " I feel entitled and I use my power to intimidate women into kissing me. I don't ask. I just kiss. And they let me. Grope their genitalia."
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Everyone needs to stop GENERALIZING groups of people according to party. It's no longer about beliefs. Criticize individuals actions. Don't make broad sweeping general statements about entire groups. "Us" and "them" leaves only two options. Win or lose.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Put a positive spin on it. I have tutored in multiple settings.  You don't have to be embarassed. It speaks highly of your intelligence that you got so far in life with limited reading ability. Look at what Reagan did for dyslexia.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Literacy is important. No one and i mean NO ONE should be mocking your reading level. You can't be completely illiterate. So, be a role model, share your experience.Get better. You NEED to be able to READ briefs and comprehend them.Swallow your pride and people will love u for it
@senrobportman Literacy concerns. If his reading ability is limited, it may explain his unwillingness to heed the printed advice he was being given.He CANT be completely illiterate. But if he's limited, prideful as he is, he is missing out on Intel necessary in order to make informed decisions.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump This man is mentally unstable and unwilling to listen to ANYONE'S well informed advice. With, hopefully, the exception of you. Because he would NOT have had the backing of moralists without you being his running mate. Get him a nintendo. Or a book and a tutor. Keep him leashed.
@VP @WhiteHouse I implore you Vice President Pence. Pray. God WILL put the solution in your mind. If it's Trump, so be it. If it's a wall...but do SOMETHING. He changes like the wind. Any sweet sounding idea can't become policy or strategy...for a few days. Only to change or cower shortly after
@VP @WhiteHouse Discuss how much better you will do. God WILL elevate. This spectacle is not good for anybody. The Presidency and America are becoming a highly unpredictable laughingstock. I don't much care for it.This guy DOES not carry himself, socially, in a manner conducive to respectability
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump Also, i would think COMMON SENSE would lead us, as a nation, to desire a moral and intelligent leader. The constitution doesn't specifically tell you to NOT to throw rocks at nuns. You just KNOW. Some things shouldn't NEED to be written down.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump Then why can't Pence do it? Trump is SO polarizing that government can't function as designed. He lacks basic social skills. He lacks common sense because of his entitlement issues and "king baby" syndrome. It's time for Pence. Enough is enough. Trump is elitist, not conservative
@JohnCornyn I wouldn't realistically expect people's opinions from ten years ago to remain exactly the same. Similar to how I truly hope Mr Trump no longer believes " I just kiss em. Don't even wait. They just let u when your a star. You can do anything"
@DanCrenshawTX @JohnCornyn They are talking about a 70% tax on your income OVER ten million. George Soros does essentially that exact thing. Voluntarily. It's called CARING about others and wanting to have a positive and lasting affect on the world. 		Profiteers don't see value if they can't profit.
@CNN NOW that we are the laughingstock of the world, because SOMEHOW our system ended up putting this charming genius into power, NOW, he's worried about looking foolish. Sheesh!

@realDonaldTrump @LouDobbs Are you tweeting THAT, implying that you have read it, as a countermeasure to recent attacks on your literacy? I tutored in prison and out of it. I would NEVER mock someone's reading level. It's a low blow.
@kelseyjharkness @HillTVLive Okay then TALK about the policies. Why is dancing even being brought up? What's next, a scandalous expose about her eating CEREAL for breakfast?

@GKeile @SunnyDayUSA1 Yeah grope my crotch please, Mr president! Let's set THAT standard for what is appropriate! Yay Trump! Let's make it okay, by example, to communicate the mentality that it's not good to cooperate with federal investigations. Yay, yippee!

@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump Anything valid that he brings up loses meaning and can be dismissed easily because of his crappy communication skills, his lack of normal social skills, and his ridiculously childish "king baby" syndrome. He alienates people, like me, who 100% agree with a few of his points.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump I like the fact that he isn't afraid to call b.s. and not worry about being offensive. The p.c. crap has gone too far. But some of it is valid. Women's rights equals human rights to me. He's a bit of a chauvanist, or at least comes across that way.And it's moronic to MOCK people.
@tedcruz It could also possibly produce more incentive to act according to ones conscience instead of according to what is gonna get one re elected.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump He is our president. I would hope MOST rational people don't expect the entertainment industry, in its entirety,  to be good role models. The  INDUSTRY is about revenue. Violence and sex sell. The PRESIDENCY is about a MORAL, INTELLIGENT individual doing what is best for all.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump What does the entertainment industry have to do with the price of tea in china. He is the president. Can you not agree that our president should hold himself to higher standards than the entertainment industry.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump He sets a bad example of what is acceptable behavior. As a human being. We have elevated him to a powerful and influential position.
@realDonaldTrump What's the source for that 93% statistic? Is that supposed to be among republicans? I don't think your THAT well liked, even among republicans. Didja poll your family?
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump I'm not really worried about the issues. Let NOT be the laughingstock of the world. Trumps a bozo. ANYONE can do better.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump Dude I'm going of of what you said. I didn't assume anything. I replied, pretty directly, to your statements.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump There's to be no wall. Perhaps you haven't heard. They could get it through when they had control. Now the dems have control. Maybe you don't understand how vote counting and math work.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump I agree. Race shouldn't matter. It IS relevant though. You implied that I don't care much. As a person with half Mexican heritage and family that would be deported if daca ends, I was letting you know that it's relevent. I think we need pence.
@braun4indiana @JohnCornyn Pence for prez. NOW! Restore integrity and Christian values to your party and our government. Who is gonna tell their grandkids when this is all said and done "I was THERE and we dragged our feet and did nothing whilst the country, and the world, was mindboggled by mr. Trump.
@SecPompeo @JohnCornyn I'll bet our president will posture, but will, in fact stand by.
@JoeThom92135696 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Making Joe Thompson great again...by correcting his spelling. I wasn't being a dick. You like facts, right. You want the truth or a sugar coated lie.
@SenThomTillis Please unite and stop this circus. That is quite enough from Mr Trump.  Who in the Senate will proudly tell their grandchildren " I was THERE and did nothing." Reach across the aisle. Unite by restoring at least a bit of decency to the presidency. Pence is in.
@senrobportman Remove Trump. Both parties need to look deep inside, stop bickering along party lines, and oust this well intentioned gentleman. He is NOT qualified intellectually, socially, or morally. You will ALL be remembered as the other officials who didn't stop this fiasco of a presidency
@SenToddYoung @VP @braun4indiana @GregPenceIN @ElectJimBaird The v.p. needs to become the p. And soon. For the love of God, get both parties together by removing him. This is insanity. BOTH parties will go down in history as being SO focused on party that we left this guy in power THIS long. This is NOT right.
@senrobportman Work together to remove this gentleman. THATS QUITE ENOUGH! He's mocking people's accents now? I would not want to tell my grandchildren that I stood idly by and watched this fiasco unfold. SOMEONE has to initiate SOMETHING. This is insanity.
@JohnBrennan Here here
@VP @POTUS @SecondLady Get rid of him. This is insanity. I am embarrassed as an American. He's mocking accents now? You don't HAVE to stick by him. Your a christian. Please pray on it.
@senorrinhatch Senator please get rid of this dolt. Enough is enough. We are quickly becoming a laughingstock to the world. He mocks politicians accents? When is it gonna be enough. Good god,man.
@librarianjennie @IndianExpress He is gonna build a presidential bookSTORE, upon ending his presidency. Instead of a library. Like the novelty coins w his image. Cuz, hey, THATS why one becomes president, cuz it's a great way to pitch ones BRAND.
@IndianExpress He openly stated that he doesnt have time for reading ( a bit distastefully) when asked. His recent list of books to read were mostly books that had his name in the title. It seemed like he just picked books w his name in them, without even looking at them. No libraries for him.
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump I'm half Mexican and half white.Take your "I'm right without question" attitude elsewhere. I have a cousin who would be deported if daca is stopped. You dont know WHAT i care about, nor how much. My cousin is under daca.Anyone in the service DESERVES to stay. Fuck you.
@DeptofDefense @USArmy Is it not a military guideline that if a commanding officer can no longer act in the best interest of the unit, said officer shall be removed? When will someone tell our commander in chief that it is time to stand down and step down.
@SenatorCardin Federal authorities WILL be arresting the current president eventually. It's just a waiting game. The system works. I believe in LAW and GOD. He broke the damn law.
@VP @POTUS @SenSchumer Stop this charade. Do not compromise your values anymore. "I do not pray that God is on my side, I carry myself in such a way that I know I am on his." Abraham Lincoln  (paraphrased from memory). Relieve Mr Trump.
@VP @POTUS Pence for prez. NOW.
@VP @POTUS @SenSchumer You are a common sense christian. Senators on both sides are technically still being paid. Fix the loophole that continues paying the persons ultimately responsible for the shutdown. BOTH parties. It will restore some integrity to the system. And unite all.
@Sen_JoeManchin Fix it then. Both parties contributed and ALL senators are technically still being paid. Whilst the government that THEY couldn't keep active is partially shut down. It's a flawed loophole. What a GREAT way to bring both parties and the American public together.
@senorrinhatch Give us some parting non partisan words of wisdom? Seriously. You have no need to worry about alliances or backlash affecting future political outcomes. Speak from the heart. Live like you were dying. Keep it REAL!
@JoeThom92135696 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Why thank you kindly. You misspelled input,btw.
@Sen_JoeManchin Senator, going off of just the BASE pay for senators, you and your esteemed colleagues are making approximately $500 dollars a day. That is NOT your fault or ANY other current politicians. It's a flawed loophole. ALL pay should stop. Or be donated.
@realDonaldTrump By flake do you mean that he WON'T encourage people to NOT cooperate with federal investigations. TREASON. And nothing less is warranted. OBSTRUCTION of justice at the VERY VERY least. Stand down, sir. Vice president Pence will take it from here. You KNOW what is inevitable.
@realDonaldTrump Your BRAIN is a big thick wall!
@JackJjr1640 @realDonaldTrump DACA affects alot of people in our military. People can die for your rights but you want to kick them out? LET them have?
@realDonaldTrump Did he pinky promise? I am all for disregarding written pacts or treaties, so long as you got his word and a pinky promise. Hey, if ya can't trust a dictator, who CAN ya trust. What does THEE best intelligence network on the planet know anyway.
@JudicialWatch Soros is a billionaire hundreds upon hundreds of times over. He's not needing millions of taxpayer dollars.
@VP Happy New year to you too. I look forward to your forthcoming opportunity to run our great nation.
@realDonaldTrump Your suffering from Trump derangement syndrome. Goofball. Happy New year though. I'm sure I wouldn't do any better running the country. It's easy to criticize u from the sidelines. Please though man, remember, your supposed to be a role model.
@realDonaldTrump Happy New year to you too.
@SecretService Why was this handled by the secret service?
@JoeThom92135696 @realDonaldTrump He looks like a buffoon
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump How will the Kurds be protected? Turkey has expressed openly that they would not.
@CNN But the character was kept only in the online episodes, not the regularly broadcasted ones. I dig sesame street but you gotta admit that it's kind of humorous " we at pbs are sympathetic to the plight of the homeless...but stay in the back out of sight!" Lol
@JoeThom92135696 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Not at all. It's awesome. I don't care much for the guy. But as his party distances themselves from him bit by bit, SOMEONE should stick by him. He IS a human being.
@realDonaldTrump This is a.p. poll
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/O4FjCU7E1O
@realDonaldTrump "Making the atmosphere of a small securely enclosed space that I share with another man great again" soon.
@crashlanding101 @realDonaldTrump You'll be "making the atmosphere of a small enclosed space great again" when your cuddling with your cellmate, donnie.
@Q6qHSZ2jBsEwujP @realDonaldTrump This makes more sense to me than most everything that you say!
@RedRobynRockin1 @realDonaldTrump What bible are you reading or misunderstanding that you think anything that this guy does even remotely resembles the way God says we should act?
@JoeThom92135696 @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Donald, you needn't worry that no one in government with any sense WANTS to be part of your spectacle anymore, Joe Thompson has your back!
@BoredLosing @realDonaldTrump He's not even smart enough to listen to his own lawyers who had to have been telling him to resign. No one is gonna stay on a sinking ship. Rudy is gonna bail soon. You'll will be prosecuted mercilessly if they have to impeach you.
@realDonaldTrump Your administration is quickly disappearing. Your gonna be ALL by your lonesome soon. " I'm busy administationizing!". Then you'll be impeached. Then charged criminally. And you'll be the big important administrator of a 6×9 cell!
@_my_pov @realDonaldTrump Prom queen? He's miss America "...and I like puppies and unicorns and if I had one wish I would cure world hunger. And if I'm chosen as miss u.s.a. I'll build a wall.."
@CNNSitRoom @CNN @JeffFlake @Acosta How can ANY conservative Christian support him? Oh, that's RIIIGHT, no one, from EITHER party thinks with their conscience  or votes their vote according to the actual issue at hand. They vote strategically. For what's best for their respective party, not best for the country.
@realDonaldTrump From what you hear? Presidential harassment? You are a goof.
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews "Too bad" sums up your presidency. You HAVE to KNOW impeachment is inevitable. And criminal charges once your no longer a sitting president. I mean, your lawyers and you aren't broadcasting it, but they GOTTA be telling you. You are being abandoned. Soon to be alone. In a cell.
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters You are asking the American public to trust you, at your word, over basically any and every person, organization, government agency, and entity whose opinion may be slightly different than yours. You dismiss indisputable facts as "fake news". Mr. Pence can restore respectability
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS He could be standing NEXT to Putin, in front of a pile of mutilated American bodies and as long as he was holding a kitten: "SEE? , he likes kittens! Your not anti-kitten, are you?" People who buy this propaganda are sheep! Baaaah baaah.
@realDonaldTrump Difficult
@realDonaldTrump With all due respect,sir, you need to look up the word obstruction. You are my president and the book that I abide by commands me to respect you. But you have made that diffucult. Step down. Do what is right for the country you love. Vice president Pence will take it from here.
@CNN That was sweet that you played along with that child. Be careful because these fake mediaers will twist it all around. " oh look now he's lying to children AND the American public". You know how THEY are.
@CNN Mr president, do YOU still believe in santa?
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Those soldiers who booed have zero respect. They are NOT true patriots like you.  Don't you let it bother you. A fella can ONLY do his best, and I truly believe that YOU are doing the best job that YOU are capable of.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS I heard that you were booed
@VP @the_USO @IndyFund @WRBethesda Pence for prez
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse The crisis of illegal activity in our white house is more of a concern.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Your correct. Your a sore spot for alot of people. Step down and let a God fearing man, who carries himself with some integrity, run the country.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Pence for prez
@VP @POTUS You'll be president soon. Congratulations.
@realDonaldTrump Make America respected again! Resign. Dude, your soooo gonna be impeached. And charged criminally afterwards for stuff you did PRIOR to entering the white house. If your lawyers aren't telling you this, fire them. I KNOW lawyers are telling you your screwed.
@realDonaldTrump Your all alone is right!
RT @BarackObama: Merry Christmas and happy holidays to the extraordinary kids, families, and staff at Children’s National. And thanks for h…

@realDonaldTrump Phooey on infrastructure!
@realDonaldTrump Agreed. If we can't have a big ol wall then I don't want ANY infrastructure at all. Without walls what good are things like public transportation, roads, schools and the like? No good a'tall. 		Your really onto something. "Phoney on infrastructure!"
@jbm85363 @realDonaldTrump @RichardGrenell That hurts man. Taking shots at me cuz I have zero followers? That sure doesn't seem like it's gonna help you to "make America great again". Make America abusive and rude maybe. You big ol meanie.
@realDonaldTrump @RichardGrenell You, sir, are a political and financial genius. Don't you worry about what Senate committees or the c.i.a. say. You have done an excellent job thus far. Keep it up sport!
@realDonaldTrump I wish I could come to the white house and play "hail to the chief" on my tuba.
@realDonaldTrump I salute you Mr president. Your such a formidable force. And handsome, too. Who does your hair?
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You are truly a great man.
