@Arnaud5566 @HeyBlowmi69 @MSNBC 65% support cutting or abolishing tuition fees and the Green New Deal has overwhelming bipartisan support
@Arnaud5566 @HeyBlowmi69 @MSNBC It is the democrat party in general who need friends if they expect to win in 2020 or they can continue to push everyone away and then its 2016 all over again. AOC is not that far left at all either. 70% of Americans are in favor of Medicare for all.
@TheHalliCJShow @MSNBC Cause she dare oppose establishment dems and the status quo when they shove through bad policy? Isn't held back by corporate donors? Give her a chance. Dont repeat 2016 by pushing out progressives and millennials. Keep an open mind.
@jerithom2016 @gmceeme @MSNBC I see more articles demonizing AOC more than elevating. And hear even worse from establishment democrats like Claire McCaskill. Great way to lose progressive and millennial voters, dividing the party by tearing each other down.
@AnnNonimouse @MSNBC This article is completely bogus. Much of the talking points in the article have been taken from Sean Hannity's show.
@AnnNonimouse @MSNBC The article you posted is fake. She doesn't have any pacs for starters.
@AnnNonimouse @MSNBC She doesn't have any corporate donors unlike Pelosi and much of the establishment democrats. She ran a grassroots campaign so her backers are her voters and supporters. What they want are probably the same things you want such as health care for all, a new green deal etc.

@CenturyLinkHelp Oh hi! I can't do that as this is my personal twitter account but I'll forward this to my city council and chamber. We have alot of questions! Twitter is not how we conduct city business however.
@NotGbo @xdorKusmaxIMusx Personally i think it has something to do with the repeal. Hopefully we'll get some answers soon. We were supposed to have a Hampton Inn moving in.  Can't imagine they'd want to continue with that if they can't offer their customers WiFi.
@NotGbo @xdorKusmaxIMusx Not sure. If its just a coincidence, its a pretty big one.
@NotGbo @xdorKusmaxIMusx Doesn't help our city council is kind of corrupt. They're busy dealing with one of their own as he's tangled up in a sexual assault case. We've been put on the back burner.
@NotGbo @xdorKusmaxIMusx We're still trying to figure that out. Not getting many answers though unfortunately. CenturyLink os our only option and they seem to be ignoring is all together.
@NotGbo @xdorKusmaxIMusx I'm on my town's chamber of commerce. We were able to get a grant to expand fibre optics to our suburbs. Since the repeal of #NetNeutrality the project has come to grinding halt. Clearly there is more to this than what meets the eye.

@HappyInMySkin1 @ABC No, it didn't fall on its own. It had a fire. Also the "laws" of physics are more like suggestions really. The surface of the sun for example has a temp of about 5,000c yet a few hundred miles away the near the corona layer its about 1,000,000c

@CroneTimmy @TheFakeESPN And what did you see from the eagles fans? I'm sure it wasn't the same thing I saw. But we both can't see everything the same now can we? So I'll take your word on that you've seen much worse no doubt. And I'm telling you that what I saw was my worst. K?
@zdacsz @n_lippai @TheFakeESPN Oh its a city!?!?! Thought it was just a shit hole with high unemployment?
@CroneTimmy @TheFakeESPN No this is an excuse Eagles fans are using to justify their poor behavior. Ask anyone outside of Philly.
@TheAmanda_86 @TheFakeESPN üò± Oh!!!! You must be so devastated.... How dare they...üôÑ
@TheSpoonMan06 @Cala_Maria0274 @TheMightyEROCK Well at least we're not poor
@almightythegr98 @richb59again @thEMANacho Try again?
@almightythegr98 @richb59again @thEMANacho Your fanbase is violent and clearly can't handle their liquor as full beer cans miraculously slip from their fucking hands and fly into the air. That's what I'm butthurt about. No one gives a fuck about your win when you act like that.
@almightythegr98 @richb59again @thEMANacho Yes you are being cocky.
@zdacsz @n_lippai @TheFakeESPN Oh its Greek? Did I ask where it originated? No dummy
@CroneTimmy @TheFakeESPN Also social media is nothing new. It's been around for an entire generation now.
@CroneTimmy @TheFakeESPN Okay sure but eagles still take the cake. Always have ever since I can remember. In fact I think it's just how you behave over there. Been to Philly twice myself. Never been too impressed with the people but love the architecture and history.
@CroneTimmy @TheFakeESPN They're disrespectful. They have have no originality. They're violent. They have no class and no sportsmanship.... None compare.

@themanfronUNCLE @FFcouchcoach Too dumb to come up with there own shit.
@b4gthakid @TheMightyEROCK I sure hope so! Stock piled beers cans to chuck at your heads. Return the favor.
@smokedmartini1 @thEMANacho It's called get your own shit! Mocking birds over here think they got something funny going when the entire country is laughing at em. Too dumb to think of there own shit they gotta steal it from other teams. Yes. Worst fanbase in NFL
@almightythegr98 @richb59again @thEMANacho And not like every other sports team cause eagles fans take the cake. They are truely the worst.
@almightythegr98 @richb59again @thEMANacho Stop being cocky ass hats. Been to Philly twice in my life and yes. They ALL act like this. This isnt football related. This is not a fan base. This is how people in Philadelphia behave. Never been impressed with that city or its state aside from its history.
@EverythinginMN CORRETCION: At least we're not Eagles fans. Packers got oodles more class and far better sportsmanship. Also i root packers when vikes aren't playing
@CroneTimmy @TheFakeESPN But none compare to eagles.
@tim_j_hunt @BleacherReport Eagles fans can't afford to come to MN anyways. Philly ranks 43rd in income per capita just above Detroit. MSP ranks 7th. This might explain Philly fans lack of class. They're poor. Therefore they have poor sportsmanship.
@TheFakeESPN Philly fans need an AA meeting.
@BrandonCromer3 @TheFakeESPN Checking full beer cans at peoples heads. Ya all in good fun
@DeweyCrowe00 @TheFakeESPN Didn't know you were trying to play victim.
@ShawneGauger @TheFakeESPN Oh, well in that case we'll be sure to give you the same treatment when the eagles get to Msp.
