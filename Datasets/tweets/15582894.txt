.@SecretaryPerry When asked if he would consider another release from #SPR, he says, it‚Äôs there for emergencies, not economic purposes.
.@SecretaryPerry Could you put all of your eggs in one basket with great possibility to deliver cheap electricity? Yes. But it if were to be disrupted b/c of things I‚Äôve shared with you, would that make the people any more comfortable?The answer is no.
.@SecretaryPerry says: We‚Äôre not ready to make a statement yet on policy lever for #coal, #nuclear plants. We‚Äôre not ready yet to say here is the plan.
.@SecretaryPerry We need to have a sufficient supply of #energy to keep lights on, #coal and #nuclear provide reliable baseload power. But notes that #naturalgas is an important player as #1 source for electricity today.
.@SecretaryPerry with increased dependence on #naturalgas, there can be supply and delivery vulnerabilities, cites @NERC_Official finding. Also refers to vulnerability of New York state "obstructionist" policy not building pipelines.

.@FERC Chair Kevin McIntyre inherited Chief of Staff and General Counsel, said they have been absolutely excellent prior to day 1. Said we are not anywhere close to getting to longer-term hiring processes.
.@FERC Chair Kevin McIntyre hasn't spoken with @SecretaryPerry about @ENERGY proposal on grid resiliency
.@RichGlickFERC 62% increase of approval of #naturalgas pipeline capacity over past year ‚Äì increasingly traversing populated areas/ we need to review its current approach for reviewing pipeline certificates/ @FERC should more broadly consider evidence of need
.@CLaFleurFERC Large growth of #naturalgas since 1999/Want to discuss how we determine economic needs for proposed pipelines/currently rely on precedent agreements/ Our review of pipelines would benefit from broader consideration of need/ Consider how we do environmental reviews
@FERC @CLaFleurFERC McIntyre said they haven't decided the format of how this review will occur/ but it will be an open, transparent process
Big news for #NaturalGas industry: @FERC Kevin McIntyre says they have decided to take a fresh look at long-standing 1999 policy statement on issuance of #naturalgas pipeline certificate orders/ something @CLaFleurFERC has asked for in the past few months
All five @FERC commissioners voted to withdraw fast-starting pricing proposal and issue three new orders @pjminterconnect, @SPPorg and @NewYorkISO to address pricing mechanisms

.@CLaFleurFERC another installment in price formation saga that began in 2014/ It will send the right price signals/ need to make sure we can properly compensate price-start resources/ it‚Äôs a sensible outcome to withdraw previous proposal and issue orders to PJM, SPP and NYISO
.@FERC staff say fast-start pricing orders aid in the agency's price formation efforts by accurately pricing fast-start resources/ leads to more transparency, may reduce need for out-of-market compensation and uplift and lead to longer term incentives for investing in the grid.

.@FERChatterjee encouraged industry to provide suggestions in comments on how #CyberSecurity proposal can be improved b/c don't want to cause too much additional burden on industry
.@CLaFleurFERC said she is supporting @FERC mandatory #CyberSecurity incident reporting requirement/ it will require @NERCReliability to report annual anonymous summaries of #CyberSecurity incidents
.@FERC staff said current @NERCReliability standards have mandatory reporting requirements, but they only kick in when operators are affected, this would be requiring reporting of all incidents even if operators aren't affected
.@FERC #CyberSecurity proposal will enhance awareness regarding existing and developing cyber threats, staff say
