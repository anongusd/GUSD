@AmiEden @SethAMandel Yes, but duplicating the Amtrak corridor everywhere else would be impractical and insanely expensive. Trains are a reasonable idea if you're talking about getting between Boston and Washington but that's it.
@AmiEden @SethAMandel Flying is a miserable experience these days except, I guess, if you have a private plane. My point is, the problems of airlines notwithstanding, that planes can always go to far more places than railway tracks could ever be laid to. That increases freedom of movement.

@ruskicouch @SethAMandel Even traveling commercial, planes go to far more places than train lines ever can even if traveling by plane is far more onerous and expensive than it used to be.
@SethAMandel I agree that train travel is much more comfortable and convenient -- though that is probably only true for those of us in the Amtrak corridor. But high speed train expansion schemes are impractical left-wing boondoggles. Cars and planes maximize personal freedom.

#WhiteHouse presser is turning into a melee as leading journalists bait &amp; attack #Trump &amp; he responds in kind. Exactly the kind of a thing that confirms what partisans think about their opponents. And, yes, this fuels #GOP antagonism toward the press &amp; helps Trump. #Midterms2018
#Trump says #Republicans who lost did so because they didn't embrace him. Not true. Those who kept their distance did so because he is toxic in blue states &amp; suburban districts. His support was valuable in red states &amp; that's why the #GOP gained in the #Senate. #MIDTERMS2018

As hopes of #BlueWave start evaporating, the chorus from bitter #Democrats about #VoterSupression is starting to build. As in 2016, we all thought #Trump would be the sore loser but it turns it's the Dems who won't accept election results. #Midterms2018
On @CNN, Van Jones just said the results are heartbreaking. This is starting to sound a lot like 2016 &amp; the schadenfreude among #Republicans is getting louder. #Midterms2018
RT @RuthieBlum: Universities across the US are having meetings to determine whether or not they have to prepare safe spaces, equipped with…
Another win for the #GOP &amp; #Trump as Marsha Blackburn wins her #Senate race. Bottom line is that another chance for a #Dem takeway is gone &amp; a Trump critic like Bob Corker is replaced by a Trump loyalist. #Midterms2018
A big win for supporters of #Israel &amp; for the #GOP as #VA05 stays red &amp; anti-Israel #Democrat Leslie Cockburn loses. #Midterms2018
Florida vote count up to 97%. #GOP still holds their leads in #Senate &amp; #Governor races. Still room for #Democrats to turn it around but the clock is ticking on hopes for a #BlueWave. #Midterms2018
And for the first time all evening #TedCruz takes the lead in #Texas. Sadness in #Betoland. #Midterms2018
On #NBC, Chuck Todd is explaining that #Scott &amp; DeSantis outperformed #Trump in 2016 in #GOP counties in #Florida that didn't touch water. If so &amp; their leads hold up, it looks like #Trump's strategy of emphasizing turning out the base was right. #Midterms2018
He's done better than any #Democrat has done in #Texas in a long time but as more of the vote comes in, the #Beto bubble may be about to burst. #Midterms2018
#Florida vote count now at 96% in. #Republicans still holding slim leads in #Senate &amp; #Governor races. #Midterms2018
@ABC declares #Indiana for #Braun, the first #Senate pickup of the night for the #GOP. Nate Silver says the odds of a #Republican majority now 95%. #Midterms2018
With 91% of the vote counted in #Florida, #Republicans Rick Scott &amp; Ron DeSantis have taken slim leads. Long way to go but if those results hold talk of a #BlueWave will cease even if #Democrats edge toward taking back the #House.
With 71% of the vote counted in #KY6, Andy Barr has taken a slim lead after trailing most of the night. #BlueWave talk slightly muted.
#Republicans better hope that most of the votes left in #KY06 are in red counties. If not talk of a #BlueWave will start to escalate. #Midterms2018
It's 7pm &amp; time for the networks to start declaring winners and losers. But it's likely that we'll have to wait on all the interesting tossups.

@lesleyabravanel @haaretzcom @ACLU You mean the ADL. And remember how much of that increase is due to the actions of one crazy Israeli teen. Writing about that today. Be well.
@lesleyabravanel @haaretzcom You're going in circles. That is an assumption based on an assumption about a short-hand message on Twitter that is as likely to have meant the opposite of what you want it to mean. Not a good example of evidence based thinking.
@lesleyabravanel @haaretzcom That just shows how the culture wars distort the way we think about people with whom we disagree. Other than the NRA, you know nothing about her. You assume she's an anti-Semite because you don't like her politics. What's wrong with our bifurcated political culture in a nutshell.
@lesleyabravanel @haaretzcom That's another assumption. Why do "most people" think that? Because they disagree with her about guns? Or is there some actual evidence of anti-Semitism or racism? If the latter, then we have something to discuss. If not, this is just more gun control debate-related snark.
@lesleyabravanel @haaretzcom Those are assumptions, not arguments. Which is more than enough to start a fight on Twitter &amp; keep everyone entertained. But not enough for serious discussions of serious problems.
@lesleyabravanel @haaretzcom That's a bit out of context. She was supporting the firing of someone who was anti-Semitic and said she hoped he was fired by someone against whom he was prejudiced. Awkwardly phrased but not what you're claiming it to be. That's the problem with Twitter.

@poljunk @CNN @NRA @waynelapierrejr If you think, among others, that the right to free expression &amp; freedom of religion is a gift bestowed by the state rather than one to which free people have an inalienable right, then we differ on what constitutes a free society. Sadly, I think many on both extremes agree w/you.

@poljunk @CNN @NRA @waynelapierrejr Of course they can. You can repeal all of the amendments, including the first, if you have sufficient support. But we might argue about what you would call a government that would do such a thing.

@poljunk @CNN @NRA @waynelapierrejr Of course, the Constitution can be changed &amp; amendments repealed. The point here was that the Founders believed that the political rights they sought to defend were not gifts from government but derived from natural right &amp; therefore God-given.
Conservatives trying to navigate in a political environment in which advocates for #GunControl can't be attacked, need to learn that backing down is just as perilous as standing firm. #Trump #Rubio  https://t.co/MzmuYOV7Zv

@michaelsafyan I'm editor in chief of JNS. I'm a columnist for Haaretz.
@michaelsafyan Which is to say that while you're certainly entitled to disagree with Trump, if you knew anything about Israeli politics or public opinion, you wouldn't write as if support for Trump's stand wasn't a consensus issue in Israel.
@michaelsafyan Of course, it's not unanimous. The very far left opposes it as do the Arab anti-Zionist parties. But be honest. Everyone from Labor to Yesh Atid to Likud and all those in between support it. That's not only the government but the majority of the opposition parties too.

Interesting touch for a person whose only reason for being elected was his name complaining about #Trump being focused on celebrity. #SOTU response. #Kennedy
Interesting touch for #SOTU response being given in front of cheering audience rather than just a camera. Smart idea.
Official response from a #Kennedy heir shows how thin the #Democrats' bench is. Recycling old names like that is what helped elect #Trump.
#CNN's post-speech carping about #SOTU makes #FoxNews coverage of past #Obama speeches seem impartial.
#CNN's @GloriaBorger immediately complains that #Trump didn't mention #Russia or #collusion in the #SOTU. Ridiculous excuse for commentary. This is a bad evening for #Democrats &amp; their media apologists &amp; enablers. At moments like this #CNN really seems like the opposition party.
For @jaketapper to lead off #CNN post-#SOTU coverage by calling what was a clearly succesful speech by talking about how polarizing it was sums up in a nutshell what a bifurcated nation we are.
@jkirchick #Jerusalem is in the Middle East.
#Trump tribute to American exceptionalism adds the right note to what has been a thoroughly successful #SOTU.
@michaelsafyan Tell that to the people of Israel who support the move across the board regardless of political party. Only the extreme left opposes it.

#Trump vows to shed inflexible ideology but says we will champion U.S. values without apology. Easier said than done but a laudable goal.
#Trump isn't wrong to talk about cooperation w/#Putin against #terror. But he needs to prove he will stand up to #Russia rather than bow to their interests as #Obama often did.
Those, like me, who feared, #Trump would be an isolationist, are being proved wrong. This is a realist speech &amp; though not perfect, puts forward a more rational approach to dealing with real threats like #terrorism while still asserting U.S. interests abroad.

Fools who are now saying that #McConnell is thwarting #Trump's agenda ignore the fact that he is the only reason why the president has gotten anything done &amp; confirmed a record # of #conservative judges. All #SteveBannon gave the #GOP was the loss of a deep red Senate seat.
#DougJones says he has found the way to unify the country. Sure, run against an extremist accused of being a pedophile &amp; a lot of the country &amp; even in deep red #Alabama will overlook the fact that you're a left-winger.

RT @RichLowry: Steve Bannon's campaign to depose Mitch McConnell takes a big step forward, by throwing away a seat in a ruby red state
So @FoxNews just called the #AlabamaSenateElection for #DougJones. #Democrats can thank #SteveBannon. When extremists win #GOP primaries, Dems gain seats. But Bannon will blame sensible #Republicans, not himself.

#SteveBannon's attacks on #McConnell &amp; #Mitt entertain his fans but all he's giving the #GOP is #RoyMoore. I explain in @NRO. https://t.co/Hg56SsxWBo
@BarbaraS370 True. There are big differences between the nature and the timing of the allegations. But while statutes of limitations prevent prosecutions, I don't think 40 years gets anyone off in the court of public opinion.
What #SteveBannon's war on the #Republican establishment is &amp; isn't accomplishing. Other than #RoyMoore, that is. My take in @NRO. https://t.co/9BdpQly3sA
@CathyYoung63 @DavidAhmanson At the very least, he admitted he was inappropriate to LeeAnn Tweeden. That's not the same as "nothing wrong" even if may not have been a crime.
@CathyYoung63 I understand your point. But he could have at least repeated the apologies he's already made. If he's really innocent, then fight for your reputation. It left the impression that he was merely made to walk the plank by his party.
#SteveBannon thinks his attacks on #mitchmcconell &amp; #MittRomney come with no costs. He is wrong. I explain in @NRO. https://t.co/9BdpQly3sA
There is a big difference between what #AlFranken &amp; #RoyMoore were accused of. Moore's alleged acts are much worse. But there isn't much difference between their refusals to apologize to the women they victimized.
@DavidAstinWalsh That's okay. And I'm so old that Coleman actually went to college with one of my older sisters. Funny that he's the one whose name I forgot.
#AlFranken's unapologetic resignation statement will remain a standard for how not to admit you were a pig to the women that he is implicitly calling liars. Not the finest moment of the #metoo era.
@DavidAstinWalsh You're right. My mistake. Meant Coleman. Two Jewish Minnesota Republicans. Stuck together in my mind.
@RLCotterill @Channel4News Sure.
I despise his politics &amp; never thought #AlFranken was funny. &amp; his behavior toward these women was clearly that of a pig. But this is an awful moment. This, &amp; nothing else, is how he will be remembered. That's got to be hard for him to live with.
#AlFranken says he'll resign but not without some #WhatAboutIsm regarding #Trump. His resentment about being pushed out is palpable.
At this point in his speech, #AlFranken seems more resentful than repentant about his actions.
