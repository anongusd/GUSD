@SenatorCollins Sally Fields abortion as a teen after sexual abused continually. Important read.
https://t.co/oJa6yK1AiD
@SenatorCollins please watch &amp; listen to Sally Fields comments on The View ... of her experience as a teen being sexually abused &amp; what she went through to have an abortion. This is written in her book .
@sunny Seems majority of Emmy viewers loved the proposal, including me &amp; my family. Just what we needed to put some joy in these depressing days. So sweet, sincere &amp; we wish them so much happiness in the future. Enough negativity in this world.
@JoyVBehar I was shocked hearing how you felt about Emmy wedding proposal. We all thought it was so sweet and just what the boring show this year needed. Heartwarming. Everyone on other shows loved it. Wishing them much happiness.

He should be ashamed of himself. His speech was so unfair. That’s ok he won’t be a Sen long.  He sure didn’t feel this way when they dumped Sen. Al Franken. Or when he heard about our admitted sex predictor president Trump and did nothing.	Hypocrite https://t.co/R3PTO5OGNH
