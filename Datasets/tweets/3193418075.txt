@realDonaldTrump I agree. its time you cancel Israel's ridiculous 10+ BILLION DOLLARS Aid to begin with sir.
@lizzieshore @harry_miller9 @JStein_WaPo @AOC Good assumptions. which is why you thing its ok to charge someone 70% taxes just because they have more of it and i don't. Even if I am dirt poor, i don't think i am entitled to a million's money just because he should share his money by force.
@lizzieshore @JStein_WaPo @AOC I Don't but i understand right from wrong.  everyone must pay similar taxes regardless of what they have earned. 70% will make those ppl bankrupt and many ppl they hired will loose their job, then they will be asking for 80% of loss in employee taxes
@harry_miller9 @lizzieshore @JStein_WaPo @AOC Many people in America have 10 Million dollars.. i dont know about 16 thousand.. also, who has the right to take somone's money away just because they have too much of it? what kind of system is that? CAN I MOVE IN JUST BECAUSE YOU A BIG HOUSE?
@lizzieshore @JStein_WaPo @AOC There is a difference between paying taxes and paying 70% taxes because you worked harder made more more through hard work and being smart

@TwoMuchBlood @fuschia194479 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump sure. i would like to see the article. if we start labeling people in camps, like dems, libs, nazis, white supremacy, and more and then we start actually killing each other over it, that is the beginning of civil war.  country first (all else later). People are missing that.
@I_am_Niteangel @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump This conversation is about people shooting up publics place that has been taking places last few years.
@TwoMuchBlood @fuschia194479 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump looool.. its so awkward.
@TwoMuchBlood @fuschia194479 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I still don't know my neighbor next door for years now.  I don't know how to approach them and i am sure  they don't either. Anyone can drive a wedge between us because we don't know each other.
@TwoMuchBlood @fuschia194479 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump The problem is there are countries and enemies of the usa who are trying to create a wedge between its citizens and start civil war.   Destroy from within by driving conspiracies.   Fighting this fake misinformation amounts to military war &amp; we need to fight it or we won't surviv
@fuschia194479 @TwoMuchBlood @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump There are nations and enemies trying to tear us apart with false pages, advertisement, and other intelligent methods.   We need to not fall for that.
@TheMix_Meister @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump And yes some cops are racist.   You know that right? I have personally experienced it.
@TheMix_Meister @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Why are you stuck with the cops only?
@TwoMuchBlood @ctdummy80 @fuschia194479 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Agree.
@TheMix_Meister @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Nothing personal.  I am just trying to find answers to mass killing and you are justifying the killing
@fuschia194479 @TwoMuchBlood @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I agree with you on that. The family that you mentioned earlier is also a root cause.  	In addition the country is missing compassionate &amp; caring.  And finally, loneliness.   How many say hi to their neighbors often with big smile? We need to change our culture to more loving.
@TheMix_Meister @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Sure.  Go get your gun and start shooting up.
@TwoMuchBlood @ctdummy80 @fuschia194479 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Victims of mass shootings are not lucky enough for close calls.  Its real. some draige lunatics comes with military grade automatic rifle and shoots them dead.  Not a movie.  Real.
@TheMix_Meister @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump This conversation is about whites shooting up innocent ppl.  Lets know if you know the answer the why?
@TheMix_Meister @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Like running from them?
@fuschia194479 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Unfortunately mass shootings are exclusively territory of the white men.  Lol.  African Americans do kill each other at a proportionally higher rate but not mass shootings.  		Also, i am ok with a criminal gang killing another criminal gang just not the killing of the innocents.
@A1Second How is this funny?
@fuschia194479 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump What is your solution if you were tasked to fix the shootings of our schools, churches, mosques, synagogues, clubs, malls and all.  What would you do? Maybe you are our solution. please share

@Zigbee2 @ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump Please explain why ordinary people are being killed not why we elected black men president.
@ctdummy80 @BrennaSimonSays @territxmom @IngrahamAngle @realDonaldTrump I am for fighting anyone who is trying to harm me or my fellow country men. We need to figure out now before its too late, why so many people are being killed at the home front.   Civil war means country men killing country men.

Dear Americans, civil war is ugly.  These acts that keep taking place siding with politicians too strongly that you are willing to kill your fellow citizens, is dangerous and could lead to civil war.   Peace is good.  Politicians are dirty, dividers are lethal to society. Reject

@JohnYobak @DArnott8 @dbongino To be honest with you trump workers are just hot potatoes now. Can't touch them because they are hot with collusion.  Almost all the leadership are questioned/investigated by mualler or Congress for colluding with Russia to steal election.
@tuckercarlsoneg @bigsecksa @PhilKoster13B @DArnott8 @dbongino I am not attacking but because i beleive in god, and i beleive lying is a sin, therefore listening to @TuckerCarlson and @seanhannity as a news you can quote for an honest conversation is just not it.
@tuckercarlsoneg @bigsecksa @PhilKoster13B @DArnott8 @dbongino Common you can't use tucker or hannity when it comes to trumps. They are cheer leaders.   We can have honest, evidence driven discussions rather than use those two guys statements.
@VictorCanfield @dbongino Actually i didn't vote for Democrats but i don't see the issue as dems or Republicans.  To me the issue is American issue and we all need to stand against corrupt politicians and colluding nations.
@Rtr2ride @GreyShhadow @BigChief_MAGA @JoeyOrs @DArnott8 @dbongino I rather deal with one that screams than one that is friendly but deceiving and destroying from within

@Rtr2ride @BigChief_MAGA @GreyShhadow @JoeyOrs @DArnott8 @dbongino That is the same as letting Russia take over usa.   Sad
@karinresists @vet4democracy @DArnott8 @dbongino Agree on that
@MikeGriego83 @GreyShhadow @JoeyOrs @DArnott8 @dbongino Lets put aside would've or could've since speculating on that is pointless.  What we know for sure is Russia did mettlled in favor of trump and trump won.  That much is for sure.
@mlb343 @DArnott8 @dbongino A crime by Hillary Clinton.  She was investigated for years
@mlb343 @DArnott8 @dbongino Was there a crime in Benghazi?
@GoettaT @SantinyD @DArnott8 @dbongino Good point.
@RonWmsinFL @DArnott8 @dbongino We agree to disagree
@GreyShhadow @JoeyOrs @DArnott8 @dbongino Hillary feels it was stollen from her and he is illegitimate
@KayBBaby @dbongino I haven't which is why i am not questioning the investigation
@RonWmsinFL @DArnott8 @dbongino Are you a justice department protecting a country? Let it take its course.  Don't get blinded by tweets from the one being investigated
@StoughtonCindy @DArnott8 @dbongino No cindy.  Does it have something to do with the investigation?
@RonWmsinFL @DArnott8 @dbongino No - if there is nothing there why does it matter who gets appointed?
@DevinRouse4 Like Benghazi? Do you remember that drama for two years.  I hated TV because of it.
@GreyShhadow @JoeyOrs @DArnott8 @dbongino We prefer our government spying on us compared to Russia.  When our president calls on Russia to steal his opponent's emails and two days later they did so, that's collusion.  You should concerned about foreign nation not us intelligence
@srorr3 @DArnott8 @dbongino Prosecutors investigate
@TFitz62 @PeterStrzok @realDonaldTrump Freedom of speech.  He can say whatever he wants as crime is not made in his mouth.   If trump did nothing illegal, what anyone says wont mean a thing.  Evidence based investigation is what they are doing
@TFitz62 Investigators are not free just like your time
@srorr3 @DArnott8 @dbongino I thought the lead was Mueller? It changed?
@Woodypop3 @DArnott8 @dbongino Meeting with Russians to get dirt for your opponent, Dirt they got by hacking American elections system wouldn't call for investigation ? Think through brother.
@RonBurling @DArnott8 @dbongino Meeting with Russian intelligence at his trump tower wouldnt achiev the basis for the investigation?
@JackBer9 @DArnott8 @dbongino We both know that line is bloated with inaccuracies but be it true, it wouldn't matter as it wont change weather crime was committed or not
@JackBer9 @DArnott8 @dbongino We will only know that for sure if it discovers no indictments
@JoeyOrs @DArnott8 @dbongino If their was a crime is evident, it wouldn't require investigation.  You investigate to uncover crime or none
@mincanada @DArnott8 @dbongino Yes that is what is happening. At first it was lock her up then the one shounting and his cronies are being locked up.   		What a twist.

@DArnott8 @GreenHeart701 @PhilKoster13B @dbongino Hillary is not the president
@Evt8 @DArnott8 @dbongino You don't care if foreign nation interfered with our election because of party association?
@silocellbarry @dbongino as far as we know investigation is on going so i don't know what fbi said that.
@Evt8 @DArnott8 @dbongino how long an investigation into a president take. clinton was 5 years long.
@GreenHeart701 @PhilKoster13B @DArnott8 @dbongino its better to have a corrupt president than treasonous president i think.
@DebraHo25101890 @dbongino Do you know who calls which hunt? The person being investigated.  Isn't that odd.
@DebraHo25101890 @dbongino Investigation is just that.    Results can go both ways.  This is 2nd grade comprehension level.  I don't even know why we have to argue about the basics.
@Hazlocmaxtor @DArnott8 @dbongino Just many indictments and ongoing so nothing would be in correct.
@GreenHeart701 @PhilKoster13B @DArnott8 @dbongino Or they are just trying to make sure treason didn't take place.  		By the way, i didn't vote for Democrats but this issue is about American not political party and we should all look at it that way.
@Hazlocmaxtor @DArnott8 @dbongino What difference does it make.  You are blaming the egg for the chicken existence.  If illegal activities took place, who reported doesnt matter only that illegal activities took place matters.
@DArnott8 @huggybare71 @dbongino So the justice department was weaponized? I fail to understand your analogy.  These are professionals who don't just get weaponized.  They have systems, rules, regulations, laws so no they are weaponized.
@huggybare71 @DArnott8 @dbongino She doesn't matter as she us just a grandmother at home.  Ppl are concerned with a guy who controls nuclear arsenal and who might have colluded and controlled by Russia.    		I don't care about Clinton or trump but i do care about our country and its  safety.     Politics aside.
@DArnott8 @dbongino Yes opening investigation is not paramount to guilty.  The law enforcement branch of government has the authority to investigate at anytime i beleive.     ANYONE WHO ATTEMPTS TO UNDERMINE OR INTERFERE WITH SUCH INVESTIGATIONS IS GUILTY OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
@DArnott8 @dbongino I am not a lawyer but i think evidence of crime is established through investigation by law enforcement.
@DArnott8 @dbongino Its investigation: you wouldn't know until its concluded.   Let it finish then decide if it was worth it
@Fendi_Gucci_Gal @dbongino We must trust someone and at this team we will have to trust the justice system and the men and women who dedicate their to running it.   Looking back at previous admin and blaming current justice work to previous admin won't help us.  Lets be civil &amp; stand by them.
@MichaelOljaca @dbongino Not strong enough argument to dismantle the investigation.  Innocent until proven guilty- specially for billionaires white men.  Nothing to worry about here.   Let it run its course.

@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews see the word homophobia to you is bad but to me, i dont' support homophobe culture. but i dont discriminate as long as you live your life and force me to like and accept your ways.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews it won't but when you start influencing your culture with my children and force my children what classes they should take at school, it impacts me directly.  this subject was about LBGT history and culture being taught at school to kids in early grades.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews recommended by who? who you thing contracted the earth? the author of the book you read?
@scented444 did you miss last nights news about Isreal and Iran starting war.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews yea we are talking about what you will teach my children. so yes its personal.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews so you want me to worry about your quality of life and ignore my quality of life.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews sorry but we don't make the planet and we are not in-charge of it.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews i did. i said i don't want you to own. i choose the book from what works for me. slavery won't work for me but also human extinction due to a culture like LBGT wont work for me either. i have choices.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews I consider family - blood family, children. not friends and partners.
@SogolAyrom @scented444 Going to war with iran deosn't help anyone. lets not celebrate like we did before iraq invasion.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews who cares about history man. no one. i am worried about future not history.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews I do understand and i don't have a problem with more humans.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews sorry but religion is what unite us but i don't you to own me. I also don't want my child to die a lone and end my family line there with him/her. the issue is bigger than how you feel about it. its a matter of survival as humans.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews so since we already have World History Class, we don't need LBGT class.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews have you ever read the Quran and Bible and The torah? they were all many many many centuries ago and they all disagree with you. your ways of life will lead to human extinction.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews so from LGBT History, my children will learn WW2 history?
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews yes i had a penis therefore, i am male mating with female to produce children. its the survival game. you don't produce, you go extinct. you understand that right?
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews Tell me what you will teach?
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews Hhhhhh sure you are born with it like being porn with vigina and penis.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews What benefits you brought to society.   I wanna know this.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews Outdated? My views don't change like tv channels.  What will the topic be in LGBT class? Its a sexual choice. Why would a child need to learn sexual stuff?
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews No history Class teaches its ok to be black because being black is not a choice.     But being LGBT is a choice.  Is like me choosing having children vs adopting other people's children. Those are choices.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews No i wouldn't benefit from lgbt history.  It doesn't help me any bit with my life.
@wrxmanpaul @FoxNews Yea children from other parents and i am descrimating but you forcing my child to learn about your ways and teachi them its normal is a problem.  Be and do whatever you want to be just don't force those that are not about that life into it.

@Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive The fact that you think some1 told you to go a head and sin, i will take responsibility and die for ur sin is illogical&amp;stupid.  It also explains why marder, rape, serial killers, school shootings, lynching are all easy b/c you motherfuckets beleive some1 else died for those sins
@yakmon @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @carlos32971201 @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Being  a Muslim is for your own benefits.  I have my own sins to worry about.   I am just thankful one of my sin is to worship a creation like me.  In this case Mohammed or jesus(pbph)
@yakmon @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @carlos32971201 @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive It means we are a lot more similar than different

@yakmon @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @carlos32971201 @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive This proves my point.  Quran instruct s to help orphan, be truthful and so on
@yakmon @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @carlos32971201 @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive See you found it.  Quran teaches to respect and honest to all kind regardless of their beliefs.
@emmettenroll2_w @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @jturner63 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Did you miss the news brother.  I truly believe no black man should be Christian.  Those ppl are racist to their core.   Read malcolm x book about Islam and zero racism.

@jturner63 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Why u insulting old man.  Respect yourself.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yea but if you say more black gangs kill. Shouldnt the cops be saving instead of trying to complete with gangs?
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @jturner63 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yes Christian justice we know.  Now you know why there 500 churches closed and 423 mosque open.  Its not personal, ppl just want true, honest, just religion.
@yakmon @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @carlos32971201 @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Doesn't this tweets proof gods point about deception  i mean everyone is about insulting islam.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @jturner63 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I know because that black dude should have been hanged right?
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive So white police kills just like gang criminals?
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Every life matters especially ones of the public servants.   If it wasn't for the police, i would be lynched long time ago by the hard core Christians doing gods work with white covering and cross burning so its sad they are killed and wrong.
@dacowboys86 @yakmon @carlos32971201 @TigerSphinx @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I didn't watch your youtube because i can't proof what's in it, who made it, or its authenticity.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive R u sure.   I can't argue with you on those stats becuse i haven't done the research.  What do you think about the Starbucks thing this week?

@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Its a culture not a religion same as drinking alcohol like water or not getting married by priests then rapping every 4 year old boy that walks through their churches while they are forgiving other people's sins.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @yakmon @carlos32971201 @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yea but they are probably impersonators hired like isis.  A true Muslim will go pray, fast, and take care of his/her family.
@jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Hhhhhhh you police your own? For the last 30 years i have been around, Christians or their governments were killing thousands every year.  Are you sure you are policing each other? The white ppl here kill literally one black person  about an hour every day. Yea no u r not.

@dacowboys86 @carlos32971201 @TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Talk to me about thr bible. I will talk to you about the quran
@jturner63 @dacowboys86 @RobBrady3 @TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive You personally would benefit from islam because you will learn discipline,  respect for self and others, and meaning of old age wisdom.

@yakmon @carlos32971201 @TigerSphinx @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Properties belong to people. If federal government sells you white house lawn, you do whatever you want with it including building  a mosque.

@yakmon @TigerSphinx @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I don't think so.There is a fear of islam but its mostly because locals are converting to islam of their own choice.

@carlos32971201 @TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Today middle east has nothing to do with Islam.  Today Mideast is battleground for the west and east.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive This statement about heart and faith is killed by hate towards others.  Insulting them, degrading them, killing them.  The faithful heart is not one of hateful heart.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Facts
@carlos32971201 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Carlos be smart
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive That is what our god which is so ur told us.  He didnt died and he will come back
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Trump is upped the contract to build more prison because he also wants to the construction industry to benefit from the free slavery labor.
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Well try again. You gotta be persistent if you want to convince a muslim to convert to christianity.  With proof.
@jturner63 @TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Ok.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive We are talking about today not 1700.  2018
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Teach me facts
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive No they are not.
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Yes your version
@jturner63 @TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Again have some respect.  If you have a point to argue stick with it
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Why would you be afraid?
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Again christ is our beloved prophet.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yea but almost 2.4 million are slaves.  Allowed by 13th amendment. They provide free labor to jcpenny, walmart, and almost every major corporation.  So yes there is slave here. Its 2.4 milliom strong and growing.
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive But you are claiming you are being forced in a country where 99% practice your religion.  I am just confused.
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Is that what you are afraid of truly?
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive You really want to talk about slavery being a white person
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive It doesnt beleivers or not beleivers but neighbors.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I was showing what the quran teaches about love thy neighbor
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Neighbors
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Who is forcing you personally? You keep saying force.   You do beleive in christianity right?
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No that is what you said. I am just clarifying
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive You dont need to insult me to debate
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Catholic are the largest.   I stick with majority.
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Where i need to live is a personal choice.   We are not doing personal in tweets.
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive So they should be prosecuted right? Take their rights away, hire isis, and dictators right?
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive So you are saying i don't have the right to be muslim but you have the right to Christian?
@jturner63 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Ok
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No its what they do for their employer.  I haven't lied to you so far.
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Ooh wait then you wilk go to heaven
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive I know. If you kill a million people, you will just visit the priest, confess and he will forgive you. Then you will go kill, steal, lie, and commit more horrendous sins, then start all over with the priest forgiving you. We all know.  Its a joke.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lets stick with facts. We can benefit from facts
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No they are doing what they hired to do.  Lets be honest about it.
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Actually bible and quran are 93% similar if you read them
@TigerSphinx @jturner63 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Because i dont beleive in that
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Sure texan.  To you even natives are not welcome here
@jturner63 @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive That is not what the bible says.  Maybe your version
@jturner63 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Lol.   Mr cajun.  You just want to argue or you have a point ?
@jturner63 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive What part and be smart
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No one need to punish no one.  You pray to your god and your sins and deeds are with him. Dont fall for ISIS that is carrying out the conservative agendas
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol.   To you muslims are bad for being muslim.  First amendment is not in your constitution i guess.
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Ravenstar i did almost memorized the quran before not only read it.   I am not claiming to know all the meaning of it since i don't speak Arabic  but at least i took college bible course.  You guys probably only know what some conservatives radio show pointed you to in the quran.
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Is not from outside problem.  Its inside solution to whomever chooses.
@yakmon @TigerSphinx @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I actually supported trump and i still do some of his policies but his morals are fucked up.
@AttawayGinger @TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Hhhhh ok
@Rick_642 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Usa pollution grew by close to 4 million in a decade.  Most of them convert.  Facts
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive If you were smart allah is just arabic for god but your upstairs might not be as functional.  Lol
@Rick_642 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I wish i could memorize the quran. Its a huge challenge but remember many muslims are actually educated.
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive To him i mean.
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Well don't be an outcast.  Be in the middle.   We all believe in the same god by the way.  The god of jesus(pbph), Mohamed(pbph),, abraham (pbph), and adam(pbph),.  The fuzz is just how to pray to them.
@Rick_642 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol.
@Rick_642 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Rick, in london 500 churches closed and 423 mosques open.   Why do you think anyone reading bible to me makes a different in my thinking?
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Who is running the ship then if he died.  Lol
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive If he died how is god
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol.   Your issues are broad and deep.
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive What was his sacrifice if i ask?
@TigerSphinx @smarty7725 @yakmon @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol what about me? I thought i was great too.
@TigerSphinx @yakmon @smarty7725 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive If the people Christians look up to is  a man like trump there is something wrong with Christians morally.
@TigerSphinx @Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive That is not christ.  Its the group of peoplw who wrote that 1000 years after his death and continue to amend it to their liking.
@Rick_642 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive No man can promise you anything including jesus or Mohammed.     Only god can.   And god is not jesus, and no jesus is not gods flesh.  		Your good deeds and sins whichever outweigh the other is all you have.  		Again its my beleive and you have your own beleive.  		Seek truth.
@yakmon @smarty7725 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yes jeff.  I am saying religion and politics are  Interwined.  You heard of trump voters right?
@Ak__Ashii @TigerSphinx Why does this video looks cuts and paste? Part of the deception we were talking about?
@dacowboys86 @yakmon @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lets debate about common sense.
@yakmon @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Religion and politics go hand n hand. Its the same everywhere i think.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive But it wasn't.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol.   Think about it.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I know to you it probably  doesnt.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive It was the Europeans that killed 6 millions jews basically almost terminating a whole ethnic group.  Then muslims welcome them.    You remember that right? It wasn't 1400 years ago which you seem to remember a lot from.   It was your age time.   Facts not fake news.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive That is the deception.   USA can defend itself.   It doesn't need to pay a 50 year old country with huge baggage itself , 11 million  a day so it can protect usa.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive So you recognize islam is a religion then right?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive If quran says israels deceive and we pay them 11 million a day while we are in 20 trillion in debt, and now one really know why we do, because they manipulate everything then its deception.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No alcohol,  no racism, no drugs, no interest, trying to live a humble life.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive You don't think jews are deceptive? How do you think they managed to take 11 million dollars a day from us while we are in 20 trillions dollars in debt?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Have a good weekend guys.   Good debate.   Hope we both learned something from each other.   No hard feelings.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Looool.  Sorry you dont seem to be educated.  I wont argue with you no more.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive  https://t.co/Fbfh0y5Ias
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive That is the book itself, not from website. https://t.co/HSKaSEk58l
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive What do you beleive? What religion?
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Remember qurat is 100% not changed from the 1400 years ago.  Look what it says about adam. https://t.co/2CxmWqpYVk
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive See you haven't done a lot of reading Edward
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive True statement to my beleive.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I know.  Dont.  But dont i sult me for doing.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Actually adam and eve were muslim, David was muslim, abraham was Muslim.    Read and  research
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive My god is ur god
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Its a religious school like catholic school.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I worship god
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Fake news is trump thing not that old of news.   Try to go back adam and eve that is how long this religion goes back.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Atkeast its praying and not spewing hate.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I am smarter that is why i follow islam.   I learned the religion.   The radicals are on both sides.   The once that don't learn either religion , islam or christianity.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No its just proof not just empty arguments
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Unless you can proof you are smarter than 2 billion and growing of all types of people, then yes.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive You talked about deporting as if Muslim is from outside.
@TigerSphinx @smarty7725 If you have 2.4 million people in prison who is committing more crimes?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol.   So where should i research?
RT @washingtonpost: Analysis: Would you pay $18.75 for ad-free Facebook? https://t.co/FfP7nYYJoD
@smarty7725 @TigerSphinx 2.4 million in prison should answer that.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I didnt say ban anything.  I only showe more deaths than the honor killing you talked about.
@JC2MAGA @TigerSphinx Its funny we beleive in the same thing.
@TigerSphinx And you promise me you will meet a Muslim face to face to and read the whole book not excerpts
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive This might be more problematic here. https://t.co/ez4ZHcEMgx
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive New material? You think its the new times that print every day or the bible? Lol.   This text, quran, has no changes to update which is why so many are converting to it.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol.  All people are created by god regardless of their religion.   Slow down Edward
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @JimFreedom2 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive What jesus gave the world?
@TigerSphinx https://t.co/449Sme86t6
@TigerSphinx You are do the research for me .	you know it's said the most opposition of Islam are the ones that will eventually convert and lead to 100s of more to convert.  Becauese they do so much research and learn the truth, they convert.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Its just another criminal which all societies have. https://t.co/JxF4UvuGVt
@TigerSphinx Anything that will make you happy.   Its Saturday.  Go out.  This religion thing is bigger than you.  Lol
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @JimFreedom2 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I love jesus so who will you fight?
@TigerSphinx I do. But you don't have to beleive in my religion like the 5 billions that don't and live their life happily.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Here in the usa no one is getting killed for converting to either religion
@TigerSphinx also don't let debates in Twitter boil your blood.   Both religions are bigger than me and you.
@TigerSphinx i can pull as many verses from bible but it wont help me or you.  You believe what you like buy dont fight me, muslims, for their beliefs, as you dont own them.
@TigerSphinx @JimFreedom2 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I will try to manage my life not other Christians or muslims.  You do the same.  Life is too short.
@TigerSphinx @JimFreedom2 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive So both islam and christianity believes in fighting for what they beleive?
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive If 500 million converted, who is the idiot?
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @michael_parola @DanielKnightPL @politixlive That should answer for you https://t.co/tiKcdQlFxv
@TigerSphinx @JimFreedom2 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive No it makes me beleive early israels were muslims too.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive So muslims put those 2.4 millions in prison? Lol
@JimFreedom2 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Almost 100% of islam prophets were jews.  Your point?
@TigerSphinx @michael_parola @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Its exactly what you are saying. You want us to beleive what you beleive and if we dont ,we evil according to you.  Good luck
@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive What would happen to them?
@JimFreedom2 @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive People shouldn't killed for their personal believes regardless of the perpetrator.
@JimFreedom2 @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive That was 1400 years ago, a kittle girl at the age of 8 was raped last week in a Christian nation.  Lets fix that.  We can help the ones and here and now not 1400 years ago.
@DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @michael_parola @dacowboys86 @politixlive That didnt answer my questions of the 2.4 millions in prison who didnt commits islam crime
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Then why 500 million become muslim last decade if i am lying? Itd because they realized its good for their personal life to be a muslim.  Ask them why.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Ok then its not for you.  Just like Christian or any other religion is for me.  I actually took christianity in college because its best to know before you judge.  I wasn't offended or anything
@michael_parola @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Lol should i answer that?
@TigerSphinx @michael_parola @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive You are entitled to your opinion but  you are acting as if you entitled to control what others beleive
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yea what is wrong with learning what you speak of so disgusting.   Then i ask you to read amd learn first and you get offended?
@DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @politixlive Lol.   America has 2.4 million people in prison for most of those crimes you listed above.  They are not muslims.
@TigerSphinx @michael_parola @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Then its not for you i guess but why are you attacking the ones that beleive in it? Do they owe you something, or you feel like you shoukf controll what they worship?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive How am i lying.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Leave or stay its their personal religion
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Ob killed more muslims than any other presidents in my opinion.
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive What about it
@TigerSphinx @michael_parola @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I do beleive in the holy quran and i do beleive once you start reading you will too just like the millions converting every year.  Start reading.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Yea we are dump, 2 billion of us, and you are smart.
@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive I did.  Very well and i am proud muslim but as i said its personal religion.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Everything you are saying is just to kill time and bs but i am in the mood for grown up respectable conversations not just balabalabalaba
@dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive What?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive How many muslims nations have muslim presidents or had last 20 years?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Its better to speak intelligently, and try to find beleiveable facts.
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Then if all that are true why so many follow islam?
@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive A lot people beat, horrible things to do, but i dont think prophet Mohammed beat his wives.
@michael_parola @dacowboys86 @TigerSphinx @DanielKnightPL @politixlive Who is they?
@TigerSphinx @dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @politixlive I don't know why he married her.  I wasnt in his head. I only know the fact that he was first working for her, hence islam doesn't oppress women as you can't oppress your boss.
@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Prophet mohamed's (pbah) wife , 1400 years ago, was his employer first.   Just a little more than 50 years west didn't allow women to vote or even own anything.   They are still discriminating women.  Have you heard of the Me2 movement.

@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Criminals are criminals.   Just because they have religion banner doesn't mean they believe in that religion.  If you see someone praying, pray with them.
@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive Lol.   That is laughable.
@dacowboys86 @DanielKnightPL @TigerSphinx @politixlive I hope you understand jesus is one of our most loved prophet.   People need to live with each other peacefully.  Religion is between a man and his god and nothing else.
@FoxNews @OliverNorthFNC If the goal was more land for Israel,  part of greater Israel plan, the map will probably changed.

@Juddge2002Don @C_3C_3_ @petefrt Because my answer is simple.  I prefer my president to dignity and respect.  They don't sell those, you come with it.
@Juddge2002Don @C_3C_3_ @petefrt I like my elderlies to have some selfrespect and dignity.   Trump is like 16 year girls the lie movie.

@SunCountryAir so I buy a one way ticket for almost $300 and no single free seat available.   What is the ticket for if you have no seats? What did I pay for?
