@BlueBlobandBB @justthewayisee1 @EWErickson You understand that all he did was say no more federal funds if they didn't allow other points of view to speak ? As anything that's funded by Tax dollars should be open to all ! If they don't take Tax dollars they can limit speech !

@BlueBlobandBB @EllaDeon @EWErickson You are right on yourself ! But these are as I said Tax dollar supported colleges ! Nothing like Obamacare ?
@BlueBlobandBB @realDonaldTrump @SenSanders These are Tax dollar supported colleges They should be required to allow Free Speech They now only allow those they agree with If they where not Tax dollar subsidized then they could do as they please But as long as everyone's taxes pay for it everyone should be able to speak

@mkitchin63 It's easy to counter their arguments for them as it's their beloved #ELDs and their court ordered Hours that has caused the problems Sooner or later someone with more that 2 brain cells will be able to add 2+2=4 As they have 2 of their wants and now we have double the problems
@mkitchin63 If you want the truth like most everything trucking the majority pay no attention to anything until it's law Just like now the Speed Limiters bunch are actively behind the scenes pushing those again And using the failure of the ELDs causing wrecks and Speeding as a reason for it
@mkitchin63 When you allow people to break the laws for 35 plus years ! Then  you can't expect things to be smooth ! Just like the current mess in the Hours of Service not really enforced after the 2004 lawsuit ! Now it's killing drivers and creating Chaos with strict enforcement by #ELDs
@mkitchin63 Still for years every politician campaigned on stopping it just like Bush Clinton Bush Obama , Trump comes along says he is going to do it and Does What's wrong with a politician doing what they said Nothing Presidents who didn't enforce the law before now caused these problems

@LSchmitt_TAAWTS @OOIDA As most forget that the @FMCSA developed the coercion rule to satisfy the court before mandating them and if you are tracked home I find that a invasion of privacy on the road or at a terminal is one thing but too your front door ? https://t.co/V9itR9qfOC
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS As any trip or movement than those specifically spelled out could be consider a continuation of a trip And why I even got into this is because that violated the coercion rule agreement that got #ELDs out of the original court loss that @OOIDA won There is a purpose for these
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS So @OOIDA was going to have a meeting with @FMCSA and I had asked one of the Guys going to ask it again ! As they way it is now except when leaving a shipper/receiver out of hours or while in route to go to a store ! You can not PC any where unless you returned as any trip (1)
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS Why I wrote an asked for a clarification is a friend and others leased to LS &amp; Mercer said they where told they could not PC home So I read up and read all the interviews and the ACTUAL rule that you thought didn't exist ! And they say one thing then another just like the letter
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS I understand well ! They have contradicted themselves ! That is part of the reason I asked for a clarification ! But a picture of what someone says he said versa the actual rule as written in the Federal Register is worthless ! https://t.co/Dm19Y7ehBz
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS If you have that much money set aside to fight it from a JP to District to State to State Supreme Court to the Federal district court of what ever juridical district you get a ticket then to the @Scotus why not pull into the next scale and give it a go ?
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS @TruckersJustice 2) they actually encourage and want drivers asking questions !! If you have not paid attention ? As they want more input on every subject , as @FMCSA Martinez said if you don't let them know what's wrong ! How do they find out ??
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS @TruckersJustice They changed it to get Walmart and others off of members of Congress backs When misinformed drivers keep arguing that the property owner could not make them leave after unloading / loading when out of Hours (1) And it had nothing to do with drivers asking for clarifications
@LSchmitt_TAAWTS @TruckersJustice ! As you can see they still don't understand the PC !

@Matthew21910826 @OOIDA @northjersey @Lewie_Pugh Voluntary use is what's needed and more Flexible Hours , as experienced or not the #ELD forces the driver to subconsciously race the clock all the Data points to that effect !

@EtchedOrSketchy @joannas11 @TATravelCenters @DaveRamsey 2) a charge you incurred doing business and charging it back is not a bad thing To get back to the original deal on paid parking It was just a suggestion charge for it then if you didn't want the money give it to a charity or retirement as the Truck stops want pay you in old age
@EtchedOrSketchy @joannas11 @TATravelCenters @DaveRamsey Was not trying to guilt trip you or imply anything was just pointing those 2 out as they are one of the few whose operating expenses are not out of sight and they do good work in my thoughts As I said earlier each person can do as they want I don't care either way but charging (1
@EtchedOrSketchy @joannas11 @TATravelCenters My mothers neighbors kid back in the 70s got leukemia and the Doctors here told his parents they probably where going to lose him but recommended StJudes they took care of him and never charged them a penny sadly he still died but today they can cure most like him still Free !!

@EtchedOrSketchy @joannas11 @TATravelCenters As it's a cost of Business today just like fuel tires and taxes If you don't charge what you are paying out then it lowers your income which does no good for anyone as most when making good money give more to charity As think most well paid fund more charity's than poor people

They sure don't give truck drivers free stuff much anymore ! Which really nothing is free but they did appreciate drivers business by giving coffee but now even that is limited
@EtchedOrSketchy @joannas11 @TATravelCenters As most every large city if you know where they are now has places that are willing to let you park for money most are already full of drop trailers but still have open spots It's something that will have to be added to the cost of each load And should be billed separate to show
@EtchedOrSketchy @joannas11 @TATravelCenters Even the ones who in the past did have reserved parking that you have to pay for No waving the fee Pay to park only spots that now account for more than half the lots of most TA/Petro To be honest that's why the NATSO lady was saying pay to park and problem is fixed ?

@NegusHamitic @NPR That is true but to exaggerate about things is ?? Have a good day ! And stay away from the Boogie man ! https://t.co/5iA2fI7yy7
@NegusHamitic @NPR You better just stick to algebra
@NegusHamitic @NPR I think you really need to think As the GOP has not had as many people get out of control or have racists pictures in Year books most have been Democrats But to say that all of EITHER side because of their political affiliation are a dangerous is a sign of simple minds
@MagGenerator1 Then because he cheated he thinks everyone else did ? But have a good day sorry I got you drug in But when anyone can come up with facts that disprove mine I will look at them But as of now more everyday take mine and thousands of others side The Congress was sold tall tales
@MagGenerator1 @bielzebuddha It is impossible to deal with those who think their feelings are what others are That and he started out with proving he had no knowledge of ELDs as first 2 on the reg then about June or July of 2017 more self certified on the @FMCSA register but until 11-17 omitracs &amp; Peoplesnet
@MikeFender5 @NPR That's about the intellect @realDonaldTrump supporters put up with ! As all they can say against him that's actually been proven ! Is he likes good looking females ! If that's a crime I'm in big trouble big time.

@bielzebuddha @italgal37 @ChuckGrassley First of all #ELDs did not exist 3 years ago you drove with AOBRD = ELOGs that are easily altered ! That and like I said if you are that easily influenced to break the rules ! Then that's your problem as I guess you think that excuse works for your own behavior
@MagGenerator1 I pulled you out he just asked for data and I told him to look at our discussion from yesterday ! He is one of the Feelings based type no Facts just feelings !
@bielzebuddha @italgal37 @ChuckGrassley 3) when you have something with DATA to back your FEELINGS let the world know As that's all you are stating is I feel or you might be one of the simple minded ones who was conned into running when tired Well then if the #ELD says you have hours to run but your tired you would run
@bielzebuddha @italgal37 @ChuckGrassley 2) and then we can look at the actual Facts that the wrecks and deaths have increased So it must be saver for drivers to cheat on paperlogs Or that running over Hours was not the problem in the first place Your simple minded thoughts are that thoughts nothing to back them up
@bielzebuddha @italgal37 @ChuckGrassley If a company or O/O cheated enough on paperlogs to be a danger ! What in the world makes you think recording it with a #ELD makes a difference they shut it off and say it was out of order or have a program fix so that they can enter what they want Your argument is baseless (1)

@BryanWhathefook @ChuckGrassley the minute the Congress gave a exemption to the live animal it proved that it had nothing to do with Safety As the type product hauled does not change the drivers abilities when trk hooked to livestock no #ELD but hook Refer it must have ? Same trk same driver ??
@BryanWhathefook And you have to think farther than if I can't then they should not either ! You just said we are not Socialist then state you want all under the same ? But the reason to support theirs is because it helps prove that it was never for anything but a lie !
@bielzebuddha @italgal37 @ChuckGrassley Go to my profile page @MagGenerator1 I went threw most look under tweets and replies And you will find links to different articles and studies And if those don't lead you to the conclusion they have subconsciously lead drivers to speed which causes wrecks in city &amp; rural area

@Land_Line_Mag @FisherTyson When you read this you see a scary senecio that if let to continue will have more going under
@TruckerDesiree Are they going to pay for storage
@MagGenerator1 But please let your members of Congress know that it's time to fix the mistake It reminds me of the National 55 mph speed limit they knew quickly it was a stupid deal but drug it out for years , so they hoped no one remembered they did it in the first place üòÇ
@RARpartners @TRUCKINGdotORG Yep If you read the letter he explains why ! Over regulation and out of control Tolls and the letter doesn't state it but just like truckload to many trucks and drivers while the ATA says there is a shortage ?
@MagGenerator1 Mcconnells wife ! But actually most trucking today is regulated by a arm of the DOT the FMCSA  it's all being work towards by many in DC and on Social media the saying the straw that broke the camels back ! #ELDs
@MagGenerator1 But anyways now you know and hopefully more read these ? And then more know and the more that know the truth The better everyone is ! And the unions have went down to the point of only representing few companies and most drivers don't get it ? As the Less union the lower wages
@MagGenerator1 Tom messed up and let the cat out of the bag in a comment a few years back funny part is with the NEMF failure I'm thinking they have cut their own throats in the process As this Dec unless stopped or the Hours relaxed by a bunch the big ones have to switch to ELDs from AOBRD https://t.co/XZR5jBWF2D
@MagGenerator1 No it's a concerted effort by the ATA and safety groups as here again I have proof of my position but all the things you referenced are already in place but live loading /unloading takes time most experienced drivers timed their rest around it till the 14 hour was court ordered

@MagGenerator1 2) numbers then you have a recipe for disaster , and the last year just proves that compliance with the Hours was not the problem causing wrecks to be honest from the data ( the Government says you have to have to prove ) then cheating and running more Hours was actually Safer
@MagGenerator1 But anytime you limit hours a person has to make pieces ( drivers are mostly paid by the miles moved ) to make a living they are going rush to make as many pieces during the allotted times and when the average driver has 6.5 hours of drive time per day according to the ATA own 1)
@MagGenerator1 Not mad by anyway shape or form just trying to point out the misconception that the average person has about trucking Lead by misconstrued facts from Safety Groups and ATA / Trucking Alliance members to try and drive small business trucking out of business so just use the info !
@MagGenerator1 Fatigued driving is such a minor percent of wrecks that it's funny that anyone would think ! But even there if a driver has Hours to drive and the ELD says he can drive you think with the 14 hour clock running they would stop or the company would not complain Actual Quailcom ! https://t.co/IJAxccrm9s
@MagGenerator1 As the majority of company trucks are limited to 64-67 mph the only place to speed is in urban and rural areas with lower speed limits especially 2 lanes where it's easy to lose control in curves or when trying to pass another speed limited truck and causing the head-on risks
@MagGenerator1 Just another article ! https://t.co/dhKRiKz6Qq
@MagGenerator1 https://t.co/IZFTVYEGCE   If you read the Keep Trucking request from their DATA and then read this ! 2+2=4 last time I checked
@MagGenerator1 As of last Dec 2017 all carriers had to use ELDs unless manufactured before 12-31-1999 ! So think again they cause wrecks and Stress leading to fuel island stabbings and a couple of shootings ! The fuel island incidents few are reported but it's a everyday thing ! Stress
@MagGenerator1 https://t.co/YeSRjqvq8e
@MagGenerator1 Here is another That clearly States they cause speeding Speeding in rural and city areas leads to wrecks Also on the interstate system the speed limited company trucks trying to pass one another causes backups that lead to more car truck interaction increasing the accident risk 1
@MagGenerator1 Speeding ! Did you not read the study backed up by Data from ELDs !

Not trying to be mean to you or what ever you think ? But then to act like you are the know all of trucking and make comments aimed at me ? That's why I pointed out your delusions of grandeur !
Then you fired back saying you don't pay for friends Not friends lobbing to members of Congress Then you go off on me about Facebook posts of wrecks Thinking what I have no ideal But if you think Tweeting is doing something continue on just look at how few read your tweets (2)
@Unclegtruck No @Unclegtruck what I'm trying to get across is that you make statements with no basis just like it took me and @ReeverTransport days to make you understand @OOIDA was for all truck drivers and owners then I showed you even @TruckerNation85 needs donations to operate and you (1)
The point I'm trying to make is tweeting is irrelevant Email writing letters going to talk to the local people in your Congress members office gets things done ! Joining OOIDA or donating to Trucker Nation helps foot the bills to get things done tweeting is a past time for fun
https://t.co/U6B0F64mi8
@Unclegtruck do you know how to check how many people read your tweets Go to your profile and where you tweeted something expand it by touching then look for tweet activity then touch or click it It will let you know that your delusion of things is off maybe 20 people if lucky https://t.co/cf6zUx7sg2

@RSHunter71 @ReeverTransport Just like the Federal does now ! But it would be really a better way as that way the bigger states like now based on population ( not road miles ) would not have advantages over others because their Reps head up a committee !
@RSHunter71 @ReeverTransport So you have all kinds of places involved ! Plus every year fuel dist.  Go broke and the State &amp; Fed eat the lost tax money ! Speedometer readings when renewing tags simple ! And trucking already does state to state car proceeds could be divided based on road miles in State just
@RSHunter71 @ReeverTransport Do you have any ideal of how fuel taxes are collected ? As the stations pay the tax in the price when they buy it Most fuel dist. Have tax bonds up for State &amp; Federal tax they Buy the fuel tax Free and then each quarter pay what they sold to the state and a federal bank account

@SandburgRobert This would really come more under the IRS enforcement area than @FMCSA as it's a private business But years ago they passed laws saying they could not force drivers to use lumbers but then will not let drivers use electric pallet jacks or forklifts that the lumbers get access to
@Land_Line_Mag With mirrors as backups I see no problem for the newer drivers as they will learn to use them easy as most are used to screens And the ones I have looked at the RV places show more area than mirriors plus maybe they will hook up on the back of trailers So the backup accidents

@BryanWhathefook @RonaldRoyThomp2 I don't think a big shut down will occur But by keeping it in the news cycles and with what occurred in Canada and France over Taxes ! I'm not sure but the average company driver can not make the money in trucking elsewhere So no they want as a majority are not hungry enough
@BryanWhathefook @RonaldRoyThomp2 If you where to take a Poll you would be surprised as most don't have negative opinions of truck drivers it's still a respected job overall ! But not like in the 50-70s prior to deregulation As today far to many are forced to drive during traffic times causing conflicts for all
@BryanWhathefook @RonaldRoyThomp2 That is because the market is over filled with trucks and drivers Nothing the Government controls except if they would quit giving Tax credits to CDL Mills and make the costs of getting a job driving fall on the big companies that create the overage ! Then rates would increase

@Unclegtruck Owner Operators INDEPENDENT DRIVERS meaning drivers who think independently Association And here is a list of all the court cases And in each you will see if any money was gotten it was returned to the owners  they hire lawyers https://t.co/BrFlUklQW9

@Unclegtruck That because they are not LAWYERS or do they claim to be ! If you get a ticket for what ever contact a lawyer or get pre paid legal or TVC or one of the other lawyers groups !
@scott_thereal @Unclegtruck The OTR sector of Owners is mainly leased owners , I think LandStar has 10 thousand or more ! Most O/Os with their own authority are 1 -5 Truck with a direct shipper or live animal haulers
@scott_thereal @Unclegtruck @OOIDA I'm not arguing just point out the wrong statements ! And as I just said the funny part is most of what George is saying we already went through before ! Alzheimer's ?
@Rambobiggs Unless the Democrats have someone other than the same old dogs ! I don't see how they could get the people on their side inspired ! But it will be close unless the economy picks back up as we are on the downward side now of a mild cut back and if left alone things will be fine
@FisherTyson Inflation ? But the juries seem more willing to give large awards on all kinds of things ! Look at some of the numbers against drug companies
@Unclegtruck @OOIDA The funny part is George we have already discussed this part of your thoughts before ! And still today the board is made up mostly of Owners Operators with their own authority the lawsuits are filed for all truckers including drivers when Government is wrong !
@Unclegtruck You are the one who just keeps making statements with no facts ! All I'm doing is showing you are wrong ! If you had any basis for what you where saying it would be fine but so far nothing has made sense if you don't like @OOIDA I really don't care just don't make false claims

@Unclegtruck @FMCSA @OOIDA But if anyone can find anywhere ! Where @OOIDA has said things about others other than to praise their efforts for working either together or on something that promotes better rules and treatment of truck drivers and owners I want to see it as I missed it !
@Unclegtruck @FMCSA @OOIDA So talking @FMCSA about something they could not stop would be like pissing in the wind But really don't get what you mean by help the other groups ?

@handymayhem But far to many run in with a chip on their shoulder thinking that their kids was wrongly accused ! And then lead the child to act up more ! Stay neutral in the kids sight and back up the teacher ! But If the teacher is wrong correct it with them not with the child present
@handymayhem All kids at one time or another act up to see what happens ! But if a parent reacts like some of tweets here ! Then you see where the problem gets worse ! Don't blame others or let your kids blame others for their own behavior ! Be sure to ask the teacher what occurred

@Alyssa_Milano I have to add to this ! As today's news does say after being hit with rocks and bottles the US did throw tear gas to make them backup ! But the illegals had pushed women and children in front of them before throwing the rocks ! Really the kind of young men we want in America

@Alyssa_Milano You really need to read the news before commenting as it makes you look dumber than a box of rocks ! None of those rushing and running where on American soil ! It was the Mexican police that fired anything !

@BigRigTravels @JovaniMy @FMCSA @askthetrucker Well seeing as wrecks where up 47% in 2017 and the only major change was more drivers on #ELDs and Elogs you must not believe in the stats ? And from all indications 2018 is going to be another record year ! What you feel and what is facts are two different things !
