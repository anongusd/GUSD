@NickMastro13 Lets see what happens in a few months.
@SenhorRaposa @NickMastro13 @thehill McCaskill literally handpicked her opponent in 2012.
If you can‚Äôt make me laugh at least once on an occasion or two. Please don‚Äôt run for office. https://t.co/lZipnVnxkP
@Gus_802 https://t.co/QgmmoeuaSB
Just given the volatile market and uncertainty. Constantly up and down up and down.
I expect it to possibly/probably hit a year sooner than this survey suggests. https://t.co/9NtsoLos9v
@reesetheone1 She lost Plymouth County.
@reesetheone1 The fact he LOST a county last November against a conservative Republican in MASSACHUSETTS last November. Definitely a non starter for me.
And it won‚Äôt matter. https://t.co/ZXBHD3JMp2
@ArtbyKGH @reesetheone1 And how do you pay for Medicare for All? Enjoy explaining those tax hikes.
@reesetheone1 Once again the current presidential candidates minus a few are ignoring this. https://t.co/GtkW2g1vPn
@politico_chris That‚Äôs a pretty BFD.
@OfficialClayyy I‚Äôm not gullible or foolish. I wanna make policy, in order for that to happen we gotta win.
@OfficialClayyy Rs would have a field day ripping into him just for that reason alone.
@OfficialClayyy I agree. He‚Äôs better off being Senator. I don‚Äôt even want him as VP personally because it‚Äôs NJ.
@notcapnamerica @reesetheone1 I really would like video evidence and/or witnesses.
He won‚Äôt make it to Iowa. https://t.co/pXXSKcyj5X
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither AL is gone for us so we have to pick up 4 to tie it or 5 to pick up the chamber.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither ESPECIALLY in the senate.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither Gotta make sure we pick up as many seats as possible. That requires a ton of money.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither The reason why I sorta want Hickenlooper is for this reason. 1. He won statewide in 2014 (a terrible year for Democrats) and 2. Money could be shifted to other senate races since we know he‚Äôd make quick work of Gardner.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither Both would be great senators for the state.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither The only male I would accept at this point is Hickenlooper. He says he ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù currently but lets see what he says in August or September. Kennedy would be a good candidate as well.
@OfficialClayyy @travis_gaither @SenhorRaposa Still don‚Äôt see him going far though.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither Yeah I took that loss rather personally and Gardner is a dead man walking politically since he ran the NRSC last fall.
@NickMastro13 @thehill He definitely should consider running again.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither Yeah it‚Äôll be a R+3 to R+5 district at most. Very doable for him.
@OfficialClayyy @NickMastro13 @thehill As did I.
@OfficialClayyy @SenhorRaposa @travis_gaither Trone will be fine. He‚Äôs moderate.
@NickMastro13 @thehill Definitely targeting MO-02. Claire won it last November.
@SenhorRaposa Only because of the bare minimum criteria.
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @decunningham2 @RockyRidgesPal @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa Oops
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @decunningham2 @RockyRidgesPal @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa Does he sniff the coke off his wifes ass??
@decunningham2 @RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa I call him turtleboy https://t.co/0mPjGS2hKs
@SenhorRaposa The anti Quinn wave was no joke in 2014.
@RockyRidgesPal @decunningham2 @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa Even if dirty tricks are involved.
@RockyRidgesPal @decunningham2 @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa His main goal is protecting his majority at all costs
@decunningham2 @RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa One of the exceptions being the house passing a resolution that the senate can‚Äôt ignore. Like the rebuke on Trumps ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù
@decunningham2 @RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @SenhorRaposa McConnell was going to block it either way. Ain‚Äôt no rules were gunna change that either. If he don‚Äôt want it on the senate floor it ain‚Äôt going on the senate floor (with few exceptions)
@Gus_802 @NicholsUprising @BernieSanders If crowd sizes mattered Ron Paul would had won.
@BBaardsen @SenhorRaposa @LindseyGrahamSC You‚Äôll be sadly disappointed.
@KAMALAMODE @reesetheone1 @notcapnamerica What really pisses me off is all the people we want to recruit for senate races are either 1. Not interested or 2. Want to run for President. (CO, and MT for example)
@_alex_joshua This is ridiculous
@Gus_802 Looks like a ‚Äúsausage fest‚Äù
@nytimes @reesetheone1 I‚Äôm guessing this is also why you‚Äôre concerned?
Bustos will have a lot of work to do in 2020. https://t.co/IOMgaVy05V
@reesetheone1 Might lose 3-6 seats at most like in 2004. If Trump draws the opponent that he wants.
@reesetheone1 Fair concerns I have them too (the looney left)  but still think we‚Äôll keep the house regardless of what happens in 2020.
@reesetheone1 Which isn‚Äôt exactly good news for us in Florida in 2020.
@reesetheone1 You can roll your eyes all you want but it was enough to finish Nelson, McCaskill, and Donnelly off.
@reesetheone1 @KAMALAMODE @notcapnamerica Everyone knew the house was gone for Rs.
@reesetheone1 @KAMALAMODE @notcapnamerica That‚Äôs house races. Talking about the Senate.
@reesetheone1 Been researching data (his included) since last November. Rural voters came out in droves (however it wasn‚Äôt as high as it was in 2016)
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @SenhorRaposa It‚Äôs why we can‚Äôt have nice things
@reesetheone1 Nice try though Reese.
@reesetheone1 The senate races in MO, IN, and FL say otherwise. ND was gone for us as early as September.
@reesetheone1 Yeah they‚Äôll vote ‚Äúfor him‚Äù because Rs would see him as the weakest opponent for Trump. Dumbasses.......
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @SenhorRaposa The judicial filibuster was at risk during Ws second term as well. Then a gang of both Democrats and Republicans made sure that didn‚Äôt blow up.
@Gus_802 Creepy
@RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @SenhorRaposa Both Reid and McConnell are guilty (regarding blowing up filibusters)
@postsbybrandon @SenhorRaposa @XochforCongress She‚Äôll fail miserably
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa I understand why Kasich didn‚Äôt though. The Senate sucks now because of Mitch McConnell.
@travis_gaither Not really. It would go from a seat that Hillary carried in 2016 to a Trump won by single digit seat. Still winnable.
@onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa Kasich was more popular than Trump in Ohio in 2018 so I can understand how he dragged DeWine across the finish line.
@onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa It‚Äôs still a win either way. Especially with every other statewide Democrat losing (against Republicans that Kasich endorsed)
@decunningham2 @onemajesticgoat @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa Shoulda woulda coulda.
@decunningham2 @onemajesticgoat @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa I wouldn‚Äôt exactly call an almost 7 point win (barely beating someone)
@onemajesticgoat @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 Ohio is pretty much gone for Democrats unless Brown is on the ticket.
@onemajesticgoat @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 Oh I agree if any states that Trump flipped in 2016 will remain red in 2020 it‚Äôll be WI, IA and OH. Florida is unpredictable.
It‚Äôs only going to get worse Larry. https://t.co/sZrSlokaUX
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @onemajesticgoat @RockyRidgesPal @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 Plus Minnesota took a leftward turn statewide in 2018. Minnesota was close in 2016 because it was largely ignored minus a few Trump visits.
@reesetheone1 @KAMALAMODE @notcapnamerica Reese they did show up particularly in rural areas in 2018 but unlike 2016 suburban turnout was equally as high which cost Republicans 40 seats in the house.
@onemajesticgoat @RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 I only hit the mute button when I have zero choice.
@thehill @RockyRidgesPal even Rick Scott now
@onemajesticgoat @RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 Good luck with that one lol
@RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 @onemajesticgoat Yeah they‚Äôll never stop with that.
@RockyRidgesPal @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 @onemajesticgoat I was never focused on flipping Texas anyway cause it isn‚Äôt realistic.
@SenhorRaposa @POTUSCAPOTE2057 @decunningham2 @onemajesticgoat It‚Äôs still likely Republican statewide. At least until at least 2028 or later.
@onemajesticgoat @decunningham2 @SenhorRaposa More like a lot of them voted for Trump because they hated Hillary Clinton. It was a vote more against than for.
@POTUSCAPOTE2057 @SenhorRaposa @decunningham2 @onemajesticgoat And will remain a firewall for Republicans statewide for at least another decade.
@reesetheone1 If crowd sizes mattered Ron Paul would had won in 2012.

@ClistonBrown @kkondik @reesetheone1 @Nate_Cohn Correct.
@RockyRidgesPal @JasonBa17205509 Gotta keep the IA-04 margin down and also win the other 3 districts by at least 5 points a piece. If Trump wins IA-04 by the same margin that he did in 2016 it‚Äôs game over regardless of what we do in the others.
@RockyRidgesPal @JasonBa17205509 Georgia will probably be red still in 2020 but trending purple though.
@allymutnick @politico_chris @njhotline @SenhorRaposa
@RockyRidgesPal @JasonBa17205509 Even when demographics shift rural Texas will most likely keep it in the red column statewide.
@MollyJongFast @Polit_eurOpines Hilarious but very doubtful that he‚Äôll be the nominee again.

@ActorAaronBooth And I‚Äôm sure the crowd he was speaking too ate that shit up.
@JasonBa17205509 It‚Äôll be like 2016. Texas may seem ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù statewide at first and then ultimately he‚Äôll win it by 6-8 points.
@JasonBa17205509 I don‚Äôt see 2 happening either.
Once again Texas ain‚Äôt going blue in a presidential year anytime soon. Not in 2020 or 2024. Very unlikely in 2028 or 2032 either.

@YatPundit Then that 2022 senate map is a nightmare for the GOP if the current guy is in the WH.
@YatPundit However like with 2016 Trump will have no coattail effects in house races. Could actually pick up a few seats in the house and at least 2 in the senate.
@YatPundit If our platform is too hot Trump will get a second term especially if the economy is doing well next year. Remember when a sitting president lost re-election the economy was in the tank (1932,1976,1980,1992)

@reesetheone1 Is the huff post trashing moderates again?
@ronfromsandiego @TheRichWilkins @SallyAlbright @mikewazu013 @get_chirp The last time any party made double digit gains in the senate was in once again 1980. The year where McGovern got blown out in his re-election bid.

@YatPundit I still think Trump will declare a national emergency. Whether that holds with SCOTUS or not I‚Äôm not sure. The 1976 National Emergencies Act does give POTUS broad discretion plus both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are definitely pro broad discretion with the executive branch.
@_alex_joshua Governor? Definitely Manchin Senate? Probably Capito but just barely.

@AndrewSolender @GOP However I can‚Äôt answer whether it‚Äôs a serious one yet because honestly who the fuck knows.
@AndrewSolender @GOP I still think he‚Äôs going to get a primary  challenge.
@PacAvenatti So basically a serious primary challenge could potentially rip a hole right in the GOP
@AndrewSolender @GOP Only 39%? Yeah we all know he ain‚Äôt going down in a primary and will be the Republican nominee again in 2020 but that‚Äôs pretty damning.

@Richhomiezeker @kenner116 @jackcurran49 @JMilesColeman @POTUSCAPOTE2057 A lot of those counties started voting Republican in presidential elections in 2000 and haven‚Äôt went for a Democrat in a presidential election because of social issues largely.
@NickMastro13 Trump did help DeWine somewhat as well (helped him with the Trump base)
@NickMastro13 I actually have it at lean R along with Iowa. Because Reynolds also won narrowly by basically winning IA-04 by 20 points despite losing the other 3 congressional districts narrowly.
@NickMastro13 @VerminSupreme He‚Äôs just trying to bait the president into reacting.
@NickMastro13 I‚Äôm not even sure even Brown can win it honestly at this point. His 2018 opponent lets be honest was a TERRIBLE candidate. John Kasich refused to endorse him enough said.
@NickMastro13 That‚Äôs correct. Lot of blue dogs live in Ohio.
@NickMastro13 And he was a very popular governor. Much more popular statewide than Donald Trump.
@NickMastro13 I hate the fact that John Kasichs endorsement dragged DeWine across the finish line.....
@NickMastro13 I know. He‚Äôs a fiscal populist but on social issues he‚Äôs very conservative. Fine by me, I‚Äôm personally pro life myself (I believe both Roe and PP v Casey are settled law)

Quite honestly my left leaning friends probably won‚Äôt like when I say this probably would survive a legal challenge if it reached the SCOTUS. It‚Äôs why the law needs a serious overhaul.
And because of the broad discretion of the National Emergencies Act of 1976 it would be very interesting how a conservative SCOTUS would rule on this. Should POTUS go that route.

@NickMastro13 Probably because Manchin had few to no coattails this time.
@NickMastro13 Probably why Ojeda lost. Quite a few that voted for Manchin probably voted for Miller as well. Don‚Äôt ask me why because I honestly don‚Äôt know their thinking.
@NickMastro13 I‚Äôm guessing he carried WV-03 too?
@JMilesColeman @NickMastro13 @politicsluo @Sen_JoeManchin @RRHElections Manchin knew what he needed to carry to get him across the finish line.
@SenhorRaposa And I expect we will be. If not I‚Äôll agree with your assessment.
@SenhorRaposa Yeah....if we‚Äôre in recession territory in 2020 he‚Äôs a deadman walking.
@SenhorRaposa Them boil weevil Democrats. Richard Shelby was one too before we became a Republican shortly after the 1994 midterm elections.
@dick_nixon If I‚Äôm reading what I‚Äôve read so far. What he‚Äôs going to propose is basically going to put pressure on freshman Democrats in the house. Particularly on the ones that come from districts that Trump carried in 2016.
@The_Viking95 Also to be fair I have AL as lean R and will probably go to likely R soon.
@The_Viking95 Yeah I have Maine in the tilt R column as of now. Depends on who is nominated to take her will determine if I throw that into the toss up column or not. Her moderate reputation took a hit last fall.
@The_Viking95 Yeah I still think Nelson shot himself honestly. Had he taken Rick Scott seriously from the second he announced would had been a different outcome.
@The_Viking95 How about tilt R instead? Willing to meet you at the middle on that one.
@reesetheone1 @TaraSetmayer It‚Äôs basically putting more pressure on freshmen Democrats in the house from districts that Trump carried.
@The_Viking95 I still would put Florida in the toss up column. But besides that I agree with this map.
@RockyRidgesPal If they lose the senate in 2020 the knives will be out for him.

@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto And each time Democrats allow the GOP to make it this ‚Äúcultural war‚Äù that‚Äôs when they get into trouble.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto The GOP constantly lied about her record on veteran issues. It was disgusting. Quite honestly that race was full of ratfucking from the right.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto It works for the GOP sadly.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto It was clear McCaskill was definitely the GOPs #1 target
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto And the flat out lies that veterans pointed out in ads.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto Yeah I was rather pissed when it became a cultural bomb. I knew it would backfire in MO and IN.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto As for the private plane that was just ridiculous. Hawley did that as well. Double standard much.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto Oh yeah that definitely woke up Trumps base. If anything less victims will come forward now after that drama fest. Hate to say it but it‚Äôs true.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto She was framed as too liberal on social issues and it stuck.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto You‚Äôre telling me something I already knew. Saw the ads. They also slammed Hawley over that lawsuit against the ACA. The term ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù is much different in Missouri than it would be in a blue state.
@painter_nancy @emzorbit @jimsciutto Actually she was on record being for it. Democrats in Missouri tend to be pro life and pro gun but they are fiscal liberals. Particularly the ones in the lead belt and the Boothell.

@The_Viking95 Because abortion, guns etc. They are still fiscal liberals. It‚Äôs mainly social issues that make them vote Republican.
@The_Viking95 Not at all. They knew they had no chance.
@The_Viking95 As for Franklin (the county that contains the state capital) Trump narrowly won it in 2016.
@The_Viking95 I noticed on the map Elliot narrowly went Republican in 2018. (I know it‚Äôs still a win but Trump won 70% of it in 2016)
@The_Viking95 Definitely a first most likely. Yeah I forgot about Lexington. I guess it all depends on if Elliot County still hates McConnell so much that they reject him, again.
@The_Viking95 he‚Äôll win every county except the ones that contain Louisville, Frankfort, and maybe Elliot County since it didn‚Äôt go for Rand Paul in 2016.
@RandySF45 Nah he‚Äôll get confirmed
@The_Viking95 I despise the guy but I know how powerful that machine is.
@The_Viking95 And McConnell will do quick work regarding any primary challenge to him. People that think McConnell is vulnerable probably think there‚Äôs ocean front property in Paducah.

@SenhorRaposa The Republican Senate wouldn‚Äôt remove her though and would call it a political stunt.

@AndyJDorsey He‚Äôll burn everything down before he resigns. When I say everything I mean everything. Still gunna wait on the Mueller report for now.
@ContentedIndie @SenhorRaposa You do realize it could very well help with his popularity correct? When Republicans impeached Bill Clinton his popularity actually rose. Don‚Äôt see Pelosi or Nadler pulling the trigger unless they have no choice.
@_Political_Nerd @SenhorRaposa That was when she had a moderate reputation. It was badly damaged with her vote on Kavanaugh.
@AndyJDorsey It ain‚Äôt gunna work. Trust me, Trump isn‚Äôt going anywhere unless his support among Republicans collapses.
@AndrewSolender And they never will either.
@ClistonBrown McConnell would literally let his own family starve too death before he moved.

@mialynneb @reesetheone1 Plus she pissed off a lot of Native Americans with how she handled the DNA ordeal which I thought was a complete disaster.
Yeah definitely sending chills down my spine somewhat. https://t.co/4WV11shkET
@OrioleNutt @thehill Gotta have 67 votes in the Senate my friend.
@mialynneb @reesetheone1 I just think Trump would bait Warren into making one big mistake after another. Plus the ‚ÄúMassachusetts Liberal‚Äù tag would probably stick as well. I was born in the state and I would honestly be shocked if we saw a president coming from the state in my lifetime.
@reesetheone1 @mialynneb Actually it would be much worse than 2016. Warren could very well be the 2020 McGovern.
@The_Viking95 Alabama being Alabama
Just going to correct you, most with a brain don‚Äôt trust the media all that much. I figured out long ago they only care about ratings and clicks. It‚Äôs how they make money. https://t.co/vbZa6DIwAX
It‚Äôs super annoying but I‚Äôm already used to it. It ain‚Äôt gunna change anytime soon. https://t.co/2tBxeW0kEX
@Emptyset09 @SenhorRaposa He has zero chance in a presidential year anyway he‚Äôs our Scott Brown.
@reesetheone1 Wasn‚Äôt just the caravan though. Kavanaugh definitely cost us in the senate and in some house races IL-12 and IL-13 for example.
@reesetheone1 We‚Äôd be talking about the senate flipping and at least a 60 seat pick up in the house.
@reesetheone1 Both Hawley and Braun won them over narrowly.
@reesetheone1 Yep. It‚Äôs why McCaskill and Donnelly lost re-election. They were up by a comfortable margin until that caravan crap. Gullible shits.
@SenhorRaposa Fucking Hamilton. It used to not be so Republican. Even Rauner (where I did not see one single sign of his in the county) got 60%.
@SenhorRaposa Even Jesse White lost my county last fall üòí hate living in southeastern Illinois.
RT @clairecmc: Oh please. Isn‚Äôt this Assad‚Äôs ( he who commits mass murder on his own people) bestie in America? https://t.co/5MsQD00HIp
@reesetheone1 Nah. Charlie Baker is perfectly happy where he is currently.
@SenhorRaposa https://t.co/nRGjBRr5Fz
@reesetheone1 Meh if the economy grinds to a halt and we‚Äôre in recession territory or possibly you know another crash like in 2008 or possibly even worse? A crash is coming it‚Äôs more of a when question than an if.
Nope, don‚Äôt see the party abandoning the elected statewide first rule in 2020 regarding presidential nominees. https://t.co/QenXQmTY6b
@The_Viking95 He would lose by at least 10 points.
RT @DougJones: Just to be clear, my book ‚ÄúBending Toward Justice‚Äù is not out yet, but will be published on March 5th.  Very excited about it
@Gus_802 Kids......ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Morons, could had easily been a Darwin Awards winner @Gus_802 https://t.co/sT51y0Au20
@JMilesColeman Not that surprised
@NickMastro13 https://t.co/mCTiyegh1q
I don‚Äôt see it going far honestly but I‚Äôve been proven wrong before. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the real disadvantage he has is the statewide rule our party has for nominees. Even Jimmy Carter was a one term governor prior to his successful run in 1976. https://t.co/t5gMauMgzj
@AndyJDorsey Yeah fortunately if Manchin were to run for Governor and lost he gets to remain senator until he has to run again in 2024 (similar rule that Massachusetts has)
@AndyJDorsey She was going to get primaried either way. Once again she‚Äôs a bigger joke than Richard Ojeda running for President.
@AndyJDorsey Still snoozing. She‚Äôs a joke.
No they won‚Äôt. Not until his base collapses which ain‚Äôt happening anytime soon. https://t.co/eDNKdJ0kpZ
Anyone that is serious so far? Probably Elizabeth Warren. https://t.co/2MHH7nTMnO
@chrisdameanor19 @BarackDaVote @reesetheone1 @Ange_Amene Yeah about that, @JohnCornyn isn‚Äôt Ted Cruz who was badly weakened because of the drama in 2016 regarding that primary.
@AndyJDorsey @SenhorRaposa Exactly. Also I know why Bost got re-elected. Kavanaugh and the ‚Äúcaravan‚Äù
@AndyJDorsey @SenhorRaposa It‚Äôs a lean Democrat district but it definitely ain‚Äôt AOCs kind of district
Lmfao you are absolutely clueless and will fail epicly but hey @SenhorRaposa let them try. https://t.co/OAcBTqMlMA
@DavidNir @magi_jay @Gus_802
@Gus_802 Must be the meth.
@AndyJDorsey That run will destroy her career.
NO ELIZABETH WARREN PLEASE, thanks.
Depends on who the nominee is. I‚Äôll let you know after the convention which I hope is held in Milwaukee. https://t.co/6DTkvjdbKl
@SenhorRaposa He forgot the 2016 Republican primaries made him extremely vulnerable. Trump bailed him out with a visit (the campaign rally in Houston)
@SenhorRaposa
A badly weakened Ted Cruz***** oops I‚Äôm being petty. https://t.co/EUsfSciHfg
And I thought the shutdowns of 95-96 and also 2013 were completely stupid. This one easily blows that away. https://t.co/6uiCZIeOJN
It actually exists? Bless their hearts for trying to be relevant in DC. https://t.co/WK6Mbjl5u6
@SenhorRaposa My reaction too this. https://t.co/gDl3rLlUQu
@reesetheone1 @notcapnamerica Quite honestly she could fall off a cliff and I wouldn‚Äôt be sad at all.
@reesetheone1 @notcapnamerica I do not like her.
I still do not like her. https://t.co/58UmwMtcnv
@Gus_802 welp that might explain the recent meltdowns https://t.co/zqSOn0LzZA
@joncprevo Um we‚Äôre talking about Gaetz here Jon...lol he‚Äôs all about them scare tactics.
@reesetheone1 I‚Äôm no fan of her. She kept inviting Bernie on in 2016.
@WillBaker021 @The_Viking95 Because the Republican nominee in that race was actually a ‚Äúdecent candidate‚Äù for a change. Regarding Michigan.
I‚Äôll believe it when I see it Senator. If such situation were to occur. https://t.co/ejTvyB29YK
@reesetheone1 Underwood will whip his ass.
Ah some good humor. https://t.co/8NWw4Ser0P
@WillBaker021 @The_Viking95 I have it as a toss up at this point. Had Scott Walker won re-election I would had it at ‚Äútilt R‚Äù thankfully Wisconsin sent him packing.
They‚Äôll fail miserably. He knows his district and those goofballs don‚Äôt know Jack squat. https://t.co/5kf9D0JSB9
