@sam_vinograd Some administration officials certainly think that Kim's letters are intended to help do just that while also providing a buffer should Pompeo, Bolton or others tell Trump North Korea is not following through on their commitments.
But part of the problem was that Kim remained sensitive about criticism he had received for using a Chinese plane to travel to Singapore for the first summit, the official said.

However, sources have told CNN that Andrew Kim's replacement has spent a number of years on the North Korean issue and has been a key part of previous negotiations.
The admin is also dealing with the retirement of CIA Korea Mission Center chief Andrew Kim. His replacement remains unnamed but CNN has learned that this person does not speak Korean, which could be a challenge as Andrew Kim often served as a high-level negotiator and translator.
As the White House continues location scouting, Steve Biegun, US special representative for North Korea, has been repeatedly shut out of any direct talks with his counterparts. Biegun had hoped to meet with his North Korean counterpart last fall in Vienna but was stood up.
Logistical issues have already sunk at least one summit proposal, according to an administration official, who told CNN that the White House reached out to North Korea about a meeting in Switzerland but the two sides were unable to make it happen due to travel concerns.
The Trump admin is scouting locations for a second summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, despite the fact that talks between North Korea and the United States appear to be at a stalemate. New from me, @kylieatwood &amp; @Kevinliptakcnn: https://t.co/TV1yLAqX2t

Per the EO Trump signed in September, DNI Coats will brief the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security.		What information, if any, will be made public remains a big ?
"This assessment will be fully coordinated within the IC, and will be provided to the President and to relevant Cabinet members. [The DNI will work to make unclassified information related to the assessment available to the American people to the greatest extent possible.]" 2/2
New statement from ODNI: "The Director of National Intelligence will provide an assessment of any foreign interference in our elections within 45 days, as called for in the President‚Äôs Executive Order on election security." 1/2
Worth noting, @Acosta was attempting to ask the President about his rhetoric towards immigrants during today's news conference ...
Still, Trump lashed out at questions about his comments about immigrants at a post-election news conference Wednesday and reiterated that he still considers the situation at the border to be an "invasion."
The Pentagon has also posted hundreds of photos and videos in the last week of unarmed American troops moving supplies and stringing concertina wire as evidence of what troops are doing at the border -- messaging that stands in stark contrast to Trump's rhetoric.
As Trump ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric ahead of Tuesday's midterms, insisting he was sending US troops to stop the caravan reaching the US, top military officials emphasized that American soldiers would not be coming into direct contact with migrants.
The role politics played in Mattis' decision to drop the moniker all together remains unclear.		What is clear however is that there was mixed-messaging about the role of troops deployed to the border from the Pentagon and Trump ahead of the election: https://t.co/T6TftcfsQg

Finally, Trump again noted he has no meeting with Putin scheduled in Paris, where he‚Äôll go later this week.
Trump said he and Putin discussed security, Syria, Ukraine, and ‚Äúabout the fact that President Obama allowed a very large part of Ukraine to be taken.‚Äù	 	When reminded that Putin, not Obama, annexed Crimea, Trump continued to blame his predecessor.
Trump then touted his good relationships with Presidents Xi and Putin.	 	‚ÄúI have a good relationship with both,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI know President Xi better.‚Äù		He also defended his summit with Putin in Helsinki although he said the media didn‚Äôt agree with how he saw the meeting.
Trump is asked whether he has seen any evidence Russia or China intervened in yesterday's elections. Trump says "we will make a full report."		Per Trump's Sept. EO, DNI Coats will conduct an assessment of any foreign election interference no later than 45 days after the election.

The official told CNN that the IC is in a ‚Äúsupport ready mode‚Äù but as of now, has not alerted relevant agencies of any concrete threats attributable to specific foreign actors -- activity has been consistent with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù probing and scanning that takes place nearly every day.
DNI Dan Coats is expected to report any foreign election interference to Trump and relevant Cabinet officials within 45 days of tomorrow's midterms. 		But on the eve of the elections, a US intel official says it is ‚Äúbusiness as usual‚Äù for Coats and the IC as a whole.

Per @JDiamond1: Trump said Idlib province is currently "surrounded by a lot of people with a lot of weapons." 		"You have at least 3 million innocent people there," Trump said. "The world is watching and the United States is watching very closely," Trump added.
Trump again warns the Syrian regime over Idlib: "They will hopefully be very, very judicious and careful. Because the world is watching. That cannot be a slaughter. If it's a slaughter, the world is going to get very, very angry. And the United States is going to get angry, too."
