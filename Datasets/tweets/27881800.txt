The loss of biodiversity due to #ClimateChange impacts employment, #tourism, #food production, the economy, vital food webs, &amp; the spread of disease. The #EndangeredSpeciesAct protects not only species and habitats, but also us. #StopExtinction #ActOnClimate
Protecting species &amp; their habitats under the #EndangeredSpeciesAct can help offset the effects of #ClimateChange. Inland marshes, river deltas, barrier islands, &amp; floodplains provide vital buffers against high water from severe storms &amp; flooding. #StopExtinction #ActOnClimate
Thank you, @NRDems &amp; @RepHuffman, for highlighting #ClimateChange at today’s hearing. Climate change exacerbates and multiplies threats to species, which is why the #EndangeredSpeciesAct is more necessary now than ever. #StopExtinction #ActOnClimate

Thank you @RepRaulGrijalva for highlighting your opposition to the Poisoned Pollinators Provision and other anti-wildlife provisions of the #FarmBill.
"The House bill contains several anti-environmental riders which weaken environmental protection, including pesticide regulations, the Clean Water Act, and the #EndangeredSpeciesAct.” Thanks @RepMaxineWaters for speaking about the troublesome provisions in the House #FarmBill.
Thank you @RepPaulTonko for speaking out against attacks on the #ESA in the #FarmBill: “Our conference report must strike provisions which put public health, workers, wildlife and clean water at risk, and promote responsible stewardship of our natural resources.”
Thank you @RepJeffDenham for urging fellow #FarmBill conference members to exclude the King amendment in a final #2018FarmBill. As you said, the #FarmBill18 shouldn’t contain “politically motivated provisions that undermine states’ rights to govern or regulate themselves.”
Animal fighting has no place anywhere in the US. Section 11616 – which 359 representatives voted to include in the #House #FarmBill – prohibits this practice in US territories, just as it is prohibited in the states. This provision must be included in a final #2018FarmBill.
This week, the Senate &amp; House bills will be combined into a single #2018FarmBill. Take action to oppose provisions that would jeopardize pollinators &amp; other #wildlife affected by pesticides: https://t.co/9nulm25vRI #StopExtinction.

Thank you, @SenStabenow for highlighting the importance of a bipartisan #2018FarmBill free of dangerous riders like the King amendment. The Senate has passed a bipartisan #FarmBill18 – we hope a final #FarmBill is free of the King amendment and other disastrous provisions.
States’ ability to set animal welfare standards that #ProtectFarmAnimals are at risk of being eliminated if the King amendment, contained in the House #FarmBill, is included in the #2018FarmBill. Ask your members of #Congress to oppose the King amendment! https://t.co/IdDGK9Pviu https://t.co/dbS3GuUfCB
The PACE Act would end inhumane animal fighting in all US territories. The #HouseofRepresentatives voted to include the bill as a part of its #FarmBill in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 359-51. It is essential that the PACE Act is retained in a final #2018FarmBilll. https://t.co/tXnzjuj9Jt
Animal fighting is a barbaric practice that is banned in all 50 states. Yet some in #Congress oppose the House #FarmBill because it extends the prohibition to US territories. Tell #Congress you want a ban on animal fighting in the #2018FarmBill https://t.co/9nulm25vRI
Vital state prohibitions on pig gestation crates &amp; cruel battery cages restricting  hens’ ability to move would be nullified if a final #2018FarmBill contains the King amendment.

The House #FarmBill would protect the @EPA and the chemical industry from liability for harming or killing imperiled species with pesticides. Don’t let #Congress absolve industry of responsibility for conserving #wildlife! https://t.co/9nulm25vRI
The #FarmBill shouldn’t be used as a vehicle to weaken the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. RT to your members of Congress to ask them to remove Sections 8303, 8503, 9111, and 9114 in conference! https://t.co/9nulm25vRI

Thank you Sen. @CoryBooker, @SenatorCollins and your Senate colleagues for urging the inclusion of the PACE Act in a #2018FarmBill. This provision in the House #FarmBill must be included in any final bill if we are to eliminate inhumane animal fighting in US territories. https://t.co/eX7ChotSSd

It would also ban public interaction with cubs. Ask your rep to cosponsor: https://t.co/Datv206dfy https://t.co/OXWYBBVo5w
Keeping #bigcats in captivity is dangerous. Since 1990, more than 300 dangerous incidents involving big cats have occurred in 44 states. 4 children died &amp; at least 66 others were severely injured. More than 100 of these cats were killed in the aftermaths. #WorldWildlifeDay
DYK: An estimated 10,000-20,000 #bigcats are currently owned as pets or are confined to ill-equipped roadside zoos around the US. There are up to 7,000 #tigers in the US, more than all the tigers that exist in the wild. #WorldWildlifeDay
#Tigers are naturally solitary animals. However, in circuses they are forced to perform in acts with other #bigcats, often leading to fights and violent outbursts. Ask your rep to cosponsor H.R. 1759: https://t.co/RLJLNNkQbO #WorldWildlifeDay https://t.co/ni0Blz450E

Did you know piglets form incredibly close and nurturing relationships with their mothers? Much like we sing lullabies to our babies, sows sing to their piglets while they nurse.
