This is not a climate change denial article. It’s basically bringing up the fact that there are more factors to consider that play a role in climate change https://t.co/PXUTT57ZAM
Again, this has nothing to due with human impact on climate change, more so the activity of the sun and how solar cycles impact our climate as well. https://t.co/PXUTT57ZAM
Pretty interesting to think about it, isn’t it? With so much attention being paid to the warming of our planet, it would be quite a shocker to suddenly enter into an ice age. https://t.co/PXUTT57ZAM
Predictions from the model suggest that solar activity will fall by 60 per cent during the 2030s to conditions last seen during the ‘mini ice age’ that began in 1645 https://t.co/PXUTT57ZAM

Gosh, how could this all happen? Because people aren’t stupid, and the media is fake.		Simple.		That is all. https://t.co/ex8WSEnMXW
Instead, the poll is going to pass barely noticed, hardly making a blip in the daily news cycle, just one more bit of real news to be ignored by the purveyors of fake news. https://t.co/ex8WSEnMXW
Meanwhile, despite the best efforts by the Democrat/Media Axis to slander and destroy them, the public at large maintains the highest degree of confidence in the military and law enforcement. https://t.co/ex8WSEnMXW
That’s right: More Americans have “hardly any confidence at all” in the press than in the United States congress, which regularly comes in with an overall public approval rating in other polls somewhere in the high single or low double digits. https://t.co/ex8WSEnMXW
But here is the single most humiliating and telling data point of all:		 https://t.co/ex8WSEnMXW
