@RepAndyBiggsAZ @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan @RepMattGaetz I would prefer President Trump first using up the money appropriated by Congress for the Wall before considering declaring an emergency. Another vote by Congress will be required in September.

@RottenRiah @EricHolder The more important question is will it be available when I turn 65 or will the whole country be bankrupt? I almost don’t use the medical system. My plan is to stay healthy. I have paid into Medicare so I suppose I would use it if available.
@Kevin5740Arnold @EricHolder I actually like being without insurance. I negotiate for my care. I have more control, and I get big discounts if I pay upfront. I’m coming out better than when I had insurance. Insurance has gotten so big it’s almost a government itself.
@Kevin5740Arnold @EricHolder I would not have qualified for expanded Medicaid.
@Progressive_Pol We need federal employees to make LESS than the private sector so they’ll want to leave for the private sector. Bureaucrats are the problem!
@EricHolder I’m self-employed and I had health insurance until Obamacare was enacted. In two years I saw my premiums (with a $6,000 deductible + co-pays) quadruple. I am now uninsured.  Let’s balance the federal budget; then Congress will have to start making the difficult decisions.
