@Greeneyebuckeye @townlecat Your assuming the Catholic Church is monolithic and static. It is gigantic, diverse, and is now in a titanic struggle to redefine itself. The present Pope is a Jesuit-no group w a worse record toward indigenous peole, and no group that has done more to come to terms w that past.
@townlecat @Kalaax008 And my point is, that this is exactly where the Bishops and the laity in that region (people I would rarely agree w on much) have not only asked about where the adults were, but have pointedly places blame on them for the problem.
@Kalaax008 Completely agree: the problem here is the failure of mass media to provide a public space for discussion and debate. #amjoy has a panel of great guests criticizing the Church for not engaging in discussion when it is, rendering implicit negative judgment. Baseless.
@Kalaax008 Read the entire coverage of this story by the Courier-Journal and you will see there has be a lot of speaking out on the issue, by the Church and even more the laity. The discussion simply hasn‚Äôt been broadcast beyond the local media.
#amjoy Be fair: the Catholic Church has done more than discuss these issues Bishops have in fact spoken out several times now. The 3 bishops in the region have be very clear about the issue, one going so far as saying wearing a MAGA hat violates Catholic teaching.
