RT @MAFS_Original: RETWEET if you think Kate deserves a REDO.		#SaveKate #MarriedAtFirstSight #mafs https://t.co/AZMcmzZgl7
@CalvinRoberson Pastor Cal I sense a long battle with depression is coming for Kates. 🤦🏽‍♀️ Please listen to the fans of your show and pull her out. He is a pig 🐷 and she is getting emotionally attached to his abuse. Pull her out and council her. Please
@TheRyanHenry I feel like Charmaine had an agenda and it was to get lilly out. Im not a huge fan of any of the behavior although i find it entertaining 🤦🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️ but calling someone a racist when they clearly NOT is defamation of character and charmaine and van look like a liability
@MAFSLifetime Idk i hope she does not get her hopes up she is a beautiful person and i feel so bad for her. He looks like he’s really trying but it looks forced and not genuine. But we can’t judge him atleast he is trying but if he dont feel it he dont feel it. This happens 😞
@richdollaz Nah they should all be happy they about to be 3someparents 🤷🏽‍♀️
@derek_mafs And you look like your mothers tampon she should have left u in her vag. Ur a load she should have swallowed.
@derek_mafs @lillian_mafs I also unfollowed this pendejo but not because of his political views cause those are like cornholes everyones got one but because I honestly think he is POS

@Joe_Gatto @bessygatto Def team Joe shut that shit off he needs his beauty sleep ♥️😂
@VINNYGUADAGNINO Wow vin u been my crush for ever because you was the most humble not feeling ur vibes right now on this tweet 😞
@_BrianaDejesus  i was on your team the whole time girl but the fact that you went about it the way u did shows u can’t fight your own battles and thats wack boo.
@theRealiTEAshow @BIGHAIRANDBOOBS That reasoning makes no sense Ryan choose to be the bigger person and walk away. You can’t blame him for choosing his real family over his work family when his work family never had his back. Who cares who he fucked ? Have ya fucked each other
@Joe_Gatto I love all the guys but u joe are my favorite!! I went to see u guys live when u were in NYC a few years back and i loved it. Stay blessed
@PBandJenelley_1 If her mom was trying to do what was best for jace thats one thing but she is using that child as a pawn and that is not what is best for jace.

@CalvinRoberson Is it just me or does anyone else feel ryan and jaclyn should divorce? I been watching this show since season 2 and i always wanted everyone to stay together except these 2 🤷🏽‍♀️
@Joe_Gatto Joe u are my fav hands down
@MAFSLifetime I want all the couples to make it but ryan ugg im not sure about him he gives off a bad vibe hes very fake im just not feeling him for her.

@AshleyP_MAFS Awww sorry to hear keep trying god will bless u soon
@mzprincesslove It was corny especially Veronica vega she played the mean girl snd if thats really who she is that behavior does not need to be promoted. Poor shay looked desperate the most entertaining story line on the show were the hot gay guys thats about it 🤷🏽‍♀️
@MAFSLifetime @MAFSNation Finally this is the episode i have been dying to see. I hope it last cause they are a great match.
@iheartMarlo Sorry boo u was acting up a bit much .

@_BrianaDejesus Yes u would! 😂 but u can order a whole cake and eat half then not so much 😉
@sonia_mafs Oh damn he should have just asked him who he bought his law license from it would have saved him 5mins 🤦🏽‍♀️
@_BrianaDejesus @LaurelBell85 And having a job will keep u humble so keep up the good work!
@_BrianaDejesus Proud of u bri at least u know teen my money 💰 dont last forever.
@Javimarroquin9 Kail dont even have respect for herself !! She mad cause javi moved on and it was with a costar nonetheless! She needs to get over it she was the one that made the bad decision to be a thot.
@LindseyKSmith02 @TeenMom @MaciBookout Was the kid in the car? No 👎 he enjoys spending time wit them 2 pull him away from them would b detrimental 2 him. She can set boundaries but 2 refuse visits is not right. Who is she 2 say if he has had enough rehab? Last i saw she was no doc. If he is sober he get credit
@TeenMom One thing i cant stand is when a female finds someone new she feels like the daddy dont matter nomore lets be real @MaciBookout u aint worried about ryans sobriety u are just angry and u choose to use ur child as a pawn thats not nice u know very well he is in good hands
@KatTatGirl @ConfusedMuscles @yogottikom U need to work on keeping ur mouth 👄 and legs closed u do to much
@Sheila_Latrice I personally do not drink but i recently wrote a research paper for school about the health benefits and apparently there are many so enjoy 😉 🍷
@FlyyyTattedSky Just waiting to see how u handle duch regarding the issue with ur son i hope it is addressed because that cant stay like that! She needs to be put in her place and she needs to be addressed!!
@BlackInkCrew Sorry but it was trash that looks horrible
@Anthony_MAFS Thats a great one !! 😂
@TheRyanHenry Ryan hun what u did was wrong but that does not mean it has to continually play out on tv @KatTatGirl is doing way to much to make herself relevant. What is done is done she also participated in making herself a side chick so its time to move on from this already its boring
Did anyone else feel that earthquake
@tv_brendon @ItsTheSituation @JENNIWOWW @DJPaulyD @VINNYGUADAGNINO @RealRonnieMagro @sallyannsalsano @MTV @JerseyShoreMTV Yes im happy cause i aint watching that floribama shit looks wack af
@Cyn_Santana Mangu con queso frito thats what i want 😉
@Cyn_Santana Yup fam and my hubz is cooking 😂
@Sheila_Latrice Probably since the holidays people act like its a storm coming and they have to get the bread and milk 😂
@Kim11Phillips @Nate_MAFS Well luckily we are all entitled to choose whom we want to believe or not since they are in the public eye. I chose to believe @Sheila_Latrice because women should stick together. Again my opinion
@Cyn_Santana Turkey 🦃 and of course pernil
@Tinkeree1959 @whoseywhatsit @JohnPaul_USA What because she has a tee shirt on? U make no sense. So the current first lady is better because she wares no clothes @all?That doesn’t make her better. I would much rather walk down a dark alley n see someone like Michelle then 2 see a porn star residing in the white house JS
@Nate_MAFS Eat it up nate eat all the fried food your lil heart desires cause im sure no one cares after what u did to your poor wife. 👅
@Tinkeree1959 @whoseywhatsit @JohnPaul_USA Wow 😲 im disgusted you would call her a thug for what reason?  Sounds to me like your the thug. U should be ashamed of yourself calling her a thug when look at you cyber bully.
@Jeremym__ Ok 👍 out here in Bk we call it cantaso either way its good 😝
@arianazolciak And thats why u grew up to be the pretty one
@Cyn_Santana Or mangu con los tres cantaso
@Nate_MAFS Wow 😮 nate u are not cool 😎
@masikakalysha U should be used to getting rear ended 😂
@Ms_Castro I saw a video of fema and some other first responder literally partying at the hotel i was a lil shocked these are people sent to help have u seen much movement?
@Ms_Castro Im a lil confused as to where this money is actually being allocated. With all this money and the island is still with no power does this make any sense? What has the US contributed? Im disgusted at how this has been handled . 🤦🏽‍♀️
@Aminabuddafly Damn should’ve called the insurance company
@PBandJenelley_1 Do you people watch the same show we all do? Does anyone else see her mom mind fucks people ? I was happy her own friend called her out on her shit. Jenelle your doing a good job. Stay strong and dont allow these fools to mind fuck u either not worth it.
@Cyn_Santana Nope ur def not the only one he is so full of himself he should lick his own ass! 🤦🏽‍♀️
@snooki I do once per month
@Cyn_Santana Laying on the couch after seasoning a pernil i never got to eat
@Sheila_Latrice Im surprised hes being a coward and not speaking out to even apologize what a piece of 💩.
@Sheila_Latrice Much better besides Duhan sounded to close like what we call poop in spanish 😂
@lbvb2015 @SheilaLDuhon Im sure he probably did it for the money 💰 or publicity. But guess who wont be buying his dumbass tee shirts 😂
@SheilaLDuhon Oh no im so sorry hun men r pigs 🐖 i pray that atleast he used protection. He will have 2 answer 2 god 1day. All those fake tears he cried.
@Nate_MAFS why u hurt ur wife feelings for? I was a huge fan now i very disappointed in you . Hope u can fix this.
@_BrianaDejesus Ur on baby 👶 #2 and didnt know that? Lol

Disappointed @DoloresCatania those are ur friends when someone belittles them no matter what the case u should have had their back.
disappointed @siggyflicker in last episode.If I spent that much money on cake i would b upset but 2 belittle others does not show class
