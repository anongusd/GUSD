Committee resumes, rolled votes now on amendments - very partisan
Amendment debate completed. Votes to begin at 9:15 a.m.
Amendment adopted!!  Citizens should insist it remain in the bill!
I offered an amendment requiring Congresspersons who vote for public plan to have to enroll in it.
Republican reforms presented - Health Savings Accounts, Association Health Plans, and wellness programs.
Congressman/Dr. Tom Price was successful with amendment to maintain private right to contract with doctor.
Technical amendments continue to be debated, truly an all night marathon.
Spoke on danger of waiting lists, Dems agreed to public data collection review. Great job Cong. Judy Biggert!
Just spoke on amendment to suspend bill if it is not deficit neutral. CBO estimates the bill will cost over $1 trillion.
Debate on amendments continue into second day as Republicans expose big government, higher taxes, and flaws of Democrat bill
My amendment to exempt Tricare from mandates of bill is first minority amendment to pass! Good for military, their families, and veterans!
I just offered an amendment to protect Tricare for our military, Veterans, and their families.
Following votes on the Floor, we're back to debating healthcare tax increases in Education and Labor.
