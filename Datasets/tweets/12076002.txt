when you do agency work, transparency on wages can be hard to get. i worked w a very sympathetic manager once and learned my agency markup was 65%. i got 35/hr and the agency got the rest -- for making the connection and sending me a check. nope. we changed agencies. https://t.co/cg1F1fHGsR
a good data point to have on this @contently thing would be how much does it cost our clients? if I get $800 for a story, what is the client who hired me paying contently? what percentage am i keeping of what they pay to use their system to work with me?
@travelfish Yup. It‚Äôs PayPal. I‚Äôve done several thousand dollars or work thru them.

free idea for you #tourismchat folks -- more ways to LEARN/MAKE music when you're in a region with deep music roots. hawaii does a STELLAR job of this, someone always sticks a ukulele in your hands there. just try to avoid it. :)

on the grand canyon's 100th birthday i would like to take a minute to remember the park ranger's face when i said, "so there's an ad in this mag in my hotel for creationist tours of the grand canyon. what do you think of that?"
@iamjensee yesterday while trying to write a thing i had a nap, a cup of coffee, and pet my dog. only then was i able to write the thing. 		do you have a dog handy? maybe that's the problem?

@mollypriddy @evaholland minimalism, (western, maybe? north american?) i think, implies a certain privilege -- i'll buy it if/when i need it! i had hoarder family members who were *terrified* of getting rid of stuff. economic anxiety 100%. 		it's complicated.
@tiabla QUOTE OF THE DAY.
my writing group basically met via email today because seattle is a shitshow and we're never seeing people on opposite sides of the city again. but that's okay, because my inbox was full of chatter that made me less lonely as a working writer.
@gastrognome @afrosypaella What Naomi said and Seattle-centric me is like ‚ÄúHow... what... huh?!?!‚Äù
@Aerohaveno That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not bylined.
for my next act, i will take a nap and then, edit this copy so it fits both word count and style for the client. 		also there will be a lot of sighing. loud sighing.
@evaholland learning stuff while dog walking is my new brand.
@JustinJONeill these all sound GREAT, thank you!

@pauletteperhach i *think* my first seattle apt, a TINY studio on Cap Hill, was 325/mo, for reference. i also had an art studio in pioneer square for, um, 125? and i worked retail. is that even doable now? i don't think it is, even w/ our higher min wage.
@pauletteperhach to answer more directly, i stay because my friends are here, i have an amazing work network, it's simple -- life works well here. but i'm *not* starting out, and i'm not sure i could stay here if i was.
@pauletteperhach seattle wasn't expensive when i moved here, and i had lucky timing, i got a creative/tech gig that helped me buy a place. i worry we are pricing out future-mes -- i worked retail when i got here, and i got by just fine, i don't think that could happen today.

@bethdean his whining skills are off the charts. :)
it's hard to play a late night show when you're 40 something, i was wrecked after, often. but when it was all working, it was just so fucking FUN. playing live music is SUPER FUN.
i was never going to be a great singer or a have pyrotechnic shredding skillz, but i was a very respectable rhythm player with better than average timing. turns out that foundational skill is a worthy contribution in a working band.
i'm now a HUGE fan of doing ridiculous things that you're not qualified for under the kind guidance of people who want you to grow and succeed. i'm really going to miss this crazy endeavor.
i was 100% the least capable musician in the group, but these guys had my back and i learned so much, and some nights, i *really* felt like a rock star. being the "girl" in the band was SUPER FUN.
we recorded two albums and on my 50th birthday, we had a standing room only gig at a GREAT seattle bar. i played live rock and roll to a standing room only crowd on my 50th BIRTHDAY. it was EPIC.
so, my band broke up. i played rock and roll with these guys for seven years, something i had never done before. never expected to do. it's all on good terms, but i'm more than a little heartbroken.  it was a helluva ride. https://t.co/Onpn5KbIH4

@kim_i_mott okay, but please don't conflate the things i've said with how you feel about what's he's said. my "are you open to pitches about bad junkets'' was sincere, and my other remarks were mere commentary.
@kim_i_mott i'm sure they suck. but i'm not contributing to making them ugly. i'm conversating, as I do. i don't always agree. but i'm not, nor have i ever been a troll. not my way.
@kim_i_mott i've *already* come out in various other conversations as very PRO the addition of local voices, i think they're super valid and underheard.
@kim_i_mott again, let me state clearly. i responded to *her* post and said, "i don't think this is going to happen." 		this is hardly an attack. you've been attacked, i'm sure, as have i, and this ain't it.
@kim_i_mott i was responding solely, directly, to the "tell me the names" tweet. didn't even *initiate* that. 		as for the broader policy issues, i don't support them for all kinds of reasons, but i also don't pitch the times.
@kim_i_mott @amyvirshup i don't *think* i'm attacking amy. i'm saying there's not gonna be whistle blowing. 		plus, as i'm sure you can imagine, i've had multiple direct conversations w NYT contributors AND eds about their policy. you're underestimating me. i *can* find the coffee.

travel twitter is in quite the tizzy over the NYT's new editor -- both her column and her tweets. it's ... i regret i have no popcorn.

@dylanw @marikamalaea people would be all, "could be a viable solution."
@dylanw @marikamalaea i'm super impressed by patty murray right now, she has really stepped up. but i listened to a bit of the debate yesterday and i was like, WOULD YOU COME OUT SWINGING, ALREADY? CHRIST.
@dylanw @marikamalaea we *totally* have a next door meme at my house. 		brown guy carrying groceries: suspicious behavior	woman walking dog, talking on phone: suspicious behavior	kawaii hair kid at bus stop: suspicious behavior		ETC.
@dylanw @marikamalaea LOL. ((sorry))		NextDoor is the weirdest microcosm.
@marikamalaea @dylanw this is almost literally how i feel about senator cantwell.
@dylanw @marikamalaea i have RSI in my neck from shaking my head in disappointment.
i supposed hardly ever leaving my house doesn't count. :) https://t.co/F4gGzIiz64
@dylanw @marikamalaea SO TIRED of that. people with money get mad. SO FUCKING WHAT.
this morning i am so sore i can hardly walk. 64 flights down, 64 back up. in and out of the waipio valley.		https://t.co/KGPYc0H87V
@marikamalaea same here. it's like she's progressive on paper, only. i want *real* progressives not maria cantwell progressives.
@douglasmack @BlairBraverman JUST SAYING. (click through) https://t.co/iNb2Mpgp33
It takes a certain confidence to rock the vintage floral aloha wear. Harley the Dog likes to embrace summer hues and project a chill dog on the beach vibe. https://t.co/UgtKWyZbUQ
answering the age-old question "if dogs wore pants..."		I CAN NOT STOP LAUGHING. https://t.co/J8XhlTJHhA
@seattlekim my shoes are basically never going to be dry. ever. 		oh well.
I hung my laundry on the line and put my shoes in the sun to dry and went to take a nap and it‚Äôs been pouring rain since. Am I doing this Hawaii thing right?
@gowstuff Thank you! I have almost no idea what I‚Äôm doing!
there's a pretty nice picture of a tropical bird in this post about waipio valley.		i mean, if you like that kind of thing. 		https://t.co/KGPYc0H87V
it was great. i'm exhausted. 		https://t.co/KGPYc0H87V https://t.co/Ckle0FIe5j

@jacqbryant Abso-freaking-lutely.
I walked five miles and crossed a waist deep river and it was worth it to see the sun rise from this front porch. An overnight invitation to stay in Waipio Valley is a spectacular gift. 	Also, I‚Äôm beat, that walk is STEEP and I need a giant nap.		#hawaii‚Ä¶ https://t.co/2gagfQQIt7 https://t.co/Gh0l1cNlGk

Husband keeps sending me pics of this little guy and I‚Äôm like OKAY I WON‚ÄôT STAY IN HAWAII SHEESH. https://t.co/07rcBalMXJ
@wandermom multiple protests, no checks. WTF.
about to go on a hike and it's pouring rain and i'm like, hey, three miles away, it's probably not raining, who knows, so going anyway. 		am i doing this hawaii thing correctly?
@mrdavidwhitley @Aerohaveno still pretty impressive.
@mrdavidwhitley @Aerohaveno AH HA. BETTER GAME.
@mrdavidwhitley @Aerohaveno i'm surprised you didn't nab an alaska while in washington.

@marikamalaea @seattlekim Educating Becky. A movie *not* starring Marika.
hey indiana, we totally talked about you over breakfast. 		much of it was very funny and kind.		other bits (cough VP cough cough) not so much so.
it seems like maybe we should all tell our stories to @SenatorCollins, huh? 		here's her contact page.		https://t.co/XvyjpyZCzx
may you get what you ask for, ms. collins. https://t.co/JSiXfYWCks
@davitydave huh, maybe i sent my bill to the wrong address?
Here's another #FlowerReport addition from Hawaii Tropical Botanic Gardens -- these things are called Cat's Whiskers and I stared at them for a LONG TIME. https://t.co/AwWkzPrfPc
STILL WAITING FOR MY SOROS CHECK.
@DonnaDTaylor it's a nice spot and the innkeeper is a genuinely interesting character. and purple potatoes are always a good idea. :)
@seattlekim @yashar Axe Body Spray
(My one night stay was at no charge.) Belgian waffle with passion fruit butter and Mac nut for breakfast at Waipio Wayside. Sure way to get five stars out of me. https://t.co/laXPfz6j5M https://t.co/jjWWSG2dN6
i got *another* agent rejection this week.  that makes 9, 14 left open in this batch. i gotta rework a few things and send out new proposals in October. 		((sigh))
i keep thinking now would be a great time for Hawaii to secede. i could get "stuck" here as a refugee in the revolution. oughta be its own nation anyway, why not today? 		downside? harley the dog is stateside.
I don't usually do the #FlowerReport but i was in a botanical garden yesterday and it was SPLENDID. https://t.co/y6IMEPVK3L
