Hey, @JimmyVielkind, @jacobgershman et al, remember this: https://t.co/haCcrsLUnj		I remember a certain NYT reporter who stood at the side of the road and yelled questions at the governor while wearing dress shoes. Others of us suited up and ran with him.

Well, yes, they are. But that's if the squirrel in question is following a natural squirrel diet. Apparently, urban squirrels are eating pizza and bagels and doughnuts and chicken fingers. They're basically having too many cheat days. They need to go back to the land. https://t.co/0YRfDf0MoS
The "new reality" of how the economy works is competition every day for every business, with states poaching jobs away from one another. Not that we engage in that sort of thing, of course, @NYGovCuomo says.
"Amazon just raised it to a new level..they said publicly we have 25K jobs, more jobs than any economic development project in the history of the state..you tell us what you will offer us to come to your state and your city." Amazon publicized this, happens every day, every bizz.

"The Senate wants to pass a bill, you need a little something called the Democratic Congress, and this should be a top priority for the Democratic Congress," @nygovcuomo says. "It takes two to tango...don't do anything until they right the wrong that they committed with SALT."
"I'm governor of New York and I'm going to rally the other governors of the other states and say: It was a theft, it was unfair, it was the worst manifestation of politics over policy and it has to be made right." - Cuomo

.@LtGovHochulNY says she and @TomDiNapoli have "met every single cow in Wyoming County." And tells @TishJames she's "battle tested" on the campaign trail and would happily get into a foxhole with her, "any day, sister."
"Happy days are here again with Leader Pelosi," @LtGovHochulNY says to her "friends in Congress." Also tells @BilldeBlasio "this is what a warm inauguration looks like," which means the governor perhaps isn't in control of the temperature in the room?
.@LtGovHochulNY up next...."How sweet it is!" she declares. Once upon a time we wondered if she would actually be the running mate again. She was, and she also won a primary challenge from @JumaaneWilliams.
Very quick speeches....leaves a lot of time for @nygovcuomo to make his remarks. He is, after all, the main attraction this evening.
.@TomDiNapoli says the governor has "set the standard for progressive leadership not only in the state of New York...but nationally as well." Then goes on to pledge independence in doing his job as the chief fiscal officer, controller of the state pension system.
.@TomDiNapoli, fan favorite, gets standing O. His former legislative colleagues always give him a big welcome.

This is confirmed by state BofE spox, who says reports that people are not waiting to feed Page 2 into scanners before Page 1 is finished processing are definitely a thing. Also, wet ballots and perforated edges are perhaps the culprits behind jammed machines. https://t.co/taIBhayWML
Well, to be fair regarding the purchasing of machines....I believe the state DID have something to do with that. https://t.co/HABHgo2jMc https://t.co/56OOre6WWr
I talked to state BofE. If a machine is down, poll workers should be able to collect ballots, now categorized as emergency, feed them into locked box beneath scanner. If it comes back online, those will be processed as per usual. If not, they'll be counted at the end of the day.
Let's be clear: Local boards of elections are just that, LOCAL. Yes, they can be ill-run and patronage mills. Yes, they are highly political. Yes, there's much one can complain about in terms of responsiveness and management. But they are not run by Albany.
