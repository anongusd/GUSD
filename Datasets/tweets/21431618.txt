@SethAMandel @baseballcrank (Maybe it turns out that was Axios editorializing. But how many conservative outlets would define themselves as "Trump-skeptical"? I'd guess not that many!)
@SethAMandel @baseballcrank I mean...I don't think you guys are Trump shills. I do think the conservative media landscape overall is quite pro-Trump, and a publication being defined early on as "Trump-skeptical" makes it notable.
@SethAMandel @baseballcrank Yeah, I guess I'll tweak my tweet slightly. The most prominent/influential voices in conservative media‚Äîesp on Fox News and talk radio‚Äîhave mostly gone full MAGA. NR clearly hasn't (though it is on the whole much less antagonistic to Trump than it was).

@nowhitechalk Again, you're revealing a reductive (and, frankly, bigoted) view of religious people with your refusal to consider that they might have come to their conclusions without coercion or brainwashing. There are plenty of people of faith with PhDs, plenty of Mormons at the Ivys.

"This is a moment of extreme national cowardice. America‚Äôs governing institutions are abdicating their authority in pursuit of expedience and amid a craven scramble to save face." https://t.co/4u1AkTLcod
@KnowsThings @nowhitechalk I mean, there's not much use in talking to someone who starts a conversation by calling you a cultist, but... you're, um, aware that adults convert to Mormonism (and other religions TBF) all the time, right?
@nowhitechalk In any case, I've got to get back to work. Have a good weekend!
@nowhitechalk As for the "regulating parent-child contact on faith basis" claim, I think it's fair to say you're not very familiar with the Mormon missionary experience/culture/program. Not sure how productive this conversation can be until you've "educated" yourself.
@nowhitechalk As far as I can tell, one of the primary agents of change in her life was attending Brigham Young University‚Äîa Mormon institution! Your analysis doesn't seem to account for the many religious people who are also well-educated. Tara's story was remarkable because it was rare.
@nowhitechalk The assumption underlying your analysis here is that religious people are being forced or manipulated, rather than thoughtfully considering what they believe and then making personal choices.
RT @oliviacpaschal: Here, I transcribed that journey of a speech for y'all: https://t.co/rW9S3h8gdG
@nowhitechalk I love "Educated," but would suggest not using it as an guide to understanding mainstream Mormonism or the Mormon experience.
For a long time‚Äîand in much the world‚Äîregular long-distance calls home were expensive and hard to pull off. That's not the case anymore, and I'm glad they've updated the policy. (But still write emails home, missionaries! You'll want to look back on them someday!)
There were various reasons for this policy. Part of it was to limit distraction/homesickness (which worked in my case as a young missionary, but probably had the opposite effect for others). A lot of it was also about logistics.
@nowhitechalk I've read it. It's great! Tara makes it pretty clear in the book, though, that hers was *far* from a normal Mormon experience (something I can attest to having also grown up Mormon!)
This will be a major change to the Mormon missionary experience. Up until now, they could email with friends and family every week, but they were only allowed to call/Skype home twice a year (on Christmas and Mother's Day). https://t.co/uzedRPiFoP

While we‚Äôre on the subject, here‚Äôs a worthwhile story on all the things the president can do during a state of emergency. (Spoiler: It‚Äôs a lot.) https://t.co/VmEdiVsZg3
@RameshPonnuru @BenjySarlin Sure but just barely, right? And it's pretty common for the opposition party to win the presidency after a two-term incumbent. But I'll admit I haven't dug into this question much. Do you think Gore would have won in a walk if not for Clinton's impeachment?
@BenjySarlin If nothing else, Trump allies probably hope this will undermine any actual impeachment efforts that do materialize. (Again, not sure how effective that is beyond Trump's base.)
@BenjySarlin Yeah, that's clearly true. I think the strategy here is pretty simple (if not fully thought out): Depict Democrats as crazy bloodthirsty partisans who will stop at nothing to impeach Trump.
@BenjySarlin There's some pretty recent precedent for impeachment-related overreach helping the party of the impeached, right?
@dirkpeitz @jkirchick @Brinkbaeumer Interesting. Can you elaborate?

"Railing about character hurts the president," complains the senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. https://t.co/LR1l26MfCD
Amazing. Here's a senior fellow at the Ethics an Public Policy Center arguing that Donald Trump's character doesn't matter, and that worrying about it is "out of touch." https://t.co/LR1l26MfCD

@ScottAdamsSays @Angelo_Lutz wait, what's the Charlottesville hoax?
Romney: "I think it's important to be clear-eyed with regards to Vladimir Putin...America has to make it very very clear that he can't go invading other countries." Says he would have been tougher on Russia than Trump has been so far.
Romney asked where he stands on the shutdown: "There has to be some kind of deal where Republicans get something and Democrats get something...It has to be a win-win."
Romney on Ronna McDaniel's criticism: "She's the chairwoman of the Republican Party. She has a responsibility. I respect her right to express that viewpoint. It's probably a bit more civil than it might have been across the Thanksgiving dinner table."
Will Romney run against Trump in 2020? "No, I'm not running again," he says.
Romney asked about accepting Trump's endorsement last year: "He was endorsing me, I wasn't endorsing him." Says he isn't supporting Trump for reelection, wants to see "what the alternatives are."
Asked what behavior he's most concerned about from Trump, Romney mentions Trump's Charlottesville response, his support for Roy Moore, and his attacks on the media.
Romney: "I think if people come to Washington with the express hope of staying in this job forever, they're making a huge mistake ... I'm really not looking for the next election, or the next spot."
Asked by @jaketapper why he wrote this op-ed now, Romney says, "I think it's important as I start this new job to make it very clear where I stand." Also mentions the abrupt withdrawal from Syria and the departure of Mattis as important factors.

One thing to emphasize from my convos w/ folks close to Romney: Mattis's departure was especially alarming to him, and a big part of why he wrote the op-ed. He hadn't planned to take such a confrontational approach when first entering the Senate. https://t.co/5rOY1FDfPO

For months, Mitt Romney's allies and advisers have told me he was determined not to define himself by his relationship to Trump. But with his new op-ed, he's signaling that a confrontation with the president is inevitable. My story: https://t.co/ZsaZ3PvLQt

If nothing else, Romney's op-ed inspired the words "jealously is a drink best served warm" to be written, and for that I am grateful. https://t.co/P33eTlD0hx
@MikeSheaAP Yep, that's something I've written about at length (including in that piece I linked)
Also worth noting given his new op-ed: 64% of Utah voters say they want to see Mitt Romney stand up to Trump when he gets to the Senate, per AP.		I recently spoke to experts and activists in the state about what they want from Senator Romney:		https://t.co/fK4gNa6FPS
Worth noting that Romney clearly knows how Trump will react to an op-ed like this‚Äîespecially one published just days before he takes office. If nothing else, it signals how the new incoming senator from Utah is positioning himself vis a vis this president.
On Trump's agenda, Romney writes, "I will act as I would with any president, in or out of my party: I will support policies that I believe are in the best interest of the country and my state, and oppose those that are not." https://t.co/rwzb2kU2Py
Romney on how he'll deal with Trump: "I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions" https://t.co/rwzb2kU2Py
Mitt Romney, who will be sworn into the Senate Thursday, writes a WaPo op-ed on Trump's lack of character: "His conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office." https://t.co/rwzb2kU2Py
