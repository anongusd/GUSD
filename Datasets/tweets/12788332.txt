Let's get this straight - 	Your #TaxRefund doesn’t reflect whether your taxes went up or down. 	Yet, Dems have been trying to spin that a lower average refund means that people’s taxes went up. 	NOW latest data comes out that refunds are up and Dems are doubly wrong. 	Whoops.

Dems have staked their entire message this month around the idea that tax refunds are decreasing – turns out the average tax refund for 2019 is HIGHER than 2018 after four weeks.	Bad for Dems’ message, great for American families. https://t.co/w65BCxWDwH

We’ve all heard horror stories of Americans who see the price tag for their drug jump overnight. Today we’re asking: Why is this happening? What is broken in the government-regulated market for medicine that allows for these frequent price hikes?
The focus of today’s hearing is on lowering the cost of prescription drug prices. We must crack down on overpriced drugs, empower patients to choose cheaper medicines, and eliminate incentives that reward bad actors.
Health care remains the #1 worry for American families &amp; workers. The status quo is failing – high premiums, skyrocketing deductibles &amp; more uncertainty about care. We must do better.

Republicans are interested in working in a #bipartisan fashion to find creative solutions to the problems of multiemployer pensions. That’s why we engaged in negotiations last year as part of the Joint Select Committee on multiemployer pensions.
Let’s work together to make sure Social Security is there for future generations by making targeted changes to improve benefits for lower lifetime earners – an across-the-board benefit increase (that also increases benefits for the wealthy) isn’t the way to do it. #Bipartisan
According to CBO, GOP #TaxCuts will generate $36 billion in additional payroll tax revenues for Social Security and Medicare over the next 10 years.
When you consider the stronger growth after tax reform (CBO estimates +$1.7 T in GDP &amp; +1.2M in wages), the improved economic outlook will add another $92 billion to payroll tax revenues for social security.
Did you know projections after Republican #TaxReform added another $92 billion to payroll tax revenues for social security?
After GOP #TaxCuts wage growth is at the highest level in 11 years 🎉. That means more payroll tax revenues for Social Security.
We hope that at today’s hearing (10 AM) we can discuss a way to move forward in a #bipartisan way to improve Social Security and retirement security for American workers. Some key reforms 👇🏼 https://t.co/w5NQDkOj44

Did you know the FIRST Republican-led bill on the floor this Congress specified that no one should be charged more $ or denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition? Republicans have supported pre-existing conditions from day one.

We want to work to make health care truly affordable so that folks can continue to see their local doctors of their choosing. AND we want to ensure that pre-existing conditions are protected (while Dems unanimously voted against our efforts to do so on day one of their majority)
The reality is that the disastrous Obamacare experiment, written behind closed doors and stuffed with special-interest giveaways, drove up health care costs for millions of working families.
Our health care system will not improve if Dems continue to pursue unconstitutional avenues that simply give Washington more power and patients less.

YOU are best equipped to know what’s right for your wants, your needs, and your budget. That’s why Republicans are voting today to put you in control of your health care with Consumer-Directed Health Plans and Health Savings Accounts (HSA).
Health Savings Accounts lower the cost of health care by paying for certain costs with tax-advantaged $$$. We want to make health care affordable for all Americans, that’s why Republicans are voting to expand access to HSAs.
