@Marylaw55555 @Ash1147 @apeirophobic @acevonjohnson Yes I am wall guy. Talk about lumping people together. None of you people have said anything interesting about your cause. Just talking shit and I do do is bait you to respond more nosence.
@poisonivy112470 Well he doesnt act like a champion for dog rights and neither do you.
@Ash1147 @acevonjohnson @apeirophobic Look at the feed. After my first comment to Ace no one said anything concrete about the cause. Just look then you tell me how the case for anti breed  discrimination was made?
@Ash1147 @acevonjohnson @apeirophobic It seems you got plenty of time to be hating on people. Thanks for all the great on dogs.
@acevonjohnson Troll you? Dude, ive been a fan for years. Why do think I got his feed?   But that doenst matter now huh?  All I wanted was to see what you had to say. I was really surprised.
@apeirophobic @Ash1147 @acevonjohnson I do have an opinion and some possible solutions because I  have nothing against pitbulls and feel bad for the bad rap they get, and appreciate you asking but I don't think we can have an conversation about the issue especially since Ace said he bkocked me and called me a troll.

@acevonjohnson @apeirophobic @Ash1147 Yes, thousands. I thought you knew it all.
@acevonjohnson Yes, you are dumb. What have said about your cause? What links have sent me to make your point. All you do is talk shit.
@apeirophobic @Ash1147 @acevonjohnson No. My point is that no one ever gives one ounce of sympathy for the thousands of people who have been mauled or killed by pitbulls. A simple " I'm sorry for those who have been injured by these particular dogs but a lot has been done to advance our cause". Or whatever but noooo
@Ash1147 @apeirophobic @acevonjohnson That's great. You are so wonderful.

@PershardOwens How can you not care about Kanye West? He is a superstar. I dont have listen to his music to have an opinion of the man. I dont eat at McDonald's but its still a good restaurant.
@PershardOwens Nope. I dont listen to his music but if I made a duet with Kanye and got that kind of payday, I would keep my opinions to myself too
@PershardOwens I bet he gained new republican fans though.
@PershardOwens But how was he treated by his political rivals? It was sad how no one with his clout came out to support him. His true fans who give a crap about who he votes for will always love him.

@PIH why do your values trump my security? You are confusing the issues.
@RealJenMateo Hi, I just saw this old tweet I sent years ago. Ur  probably even more beautiful now. God loves you too.

RT @Joy_Villa: Go big, or go home. You can either stand for what you believe or fall for what you don't. ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/PYArl1BnI6 https://‚Ä¶
@Joy_Villa when did declaring your party preference become brave and courageous? Sounds like "end of times" stuff.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President, Comander in Chief, Elite Business Mogul, Man's Man; you will make America Great Again!

"Eez blockin it wit is ed." Just something funny I heard while watching a @KimboSlice fight in Australia.
@meli_jimenezz oh , I guess it's a good picture then.
@meli_jimenezz I look like a weirdo
A man killed a boy and because he followed procedure, it's deemed justifiable? In the words of Mike Tyson "na, fuxx you".
@RealJenMateo watching you was just as fun and exciting as the fights.
@meli_jimenezz I have a friend named freeda..Freeda Slaves.
