Smart strategy. This doc said he'd vote for Clinton if he could get a selfie. He got his selfie. https://t.co/qvppRFQvRJ
@MikeofNewYORK Totally agree. People may vote for Trump despite negative views. But it's no doubt a hurdle he'd have to overcome in general.

Another example of why Gate 35X is the worst. The. Worst.
Gate agent says, with some trepidation, "How did you get out here without me scanning your boarding pass?"
After 20 minutes, gate agent comes on to bus and calls out names of passengers we're waiting for. Turns out they're already on bus
Passengers load bus to be taken to plane. Told we need to wait for three people running late. Proceed to sit and wait for 20 minutes
