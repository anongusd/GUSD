the shorthand heurisics like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt eat meat‚Äù and ‚Äúlimit your toilet paper‚Äù to blank your footprint are engaging but ultimately it‚Äôs a LOT more effective to organize against a particular group of businesses that are killing our planet for profit.		tax. their value add. directly.

‚Ä¢ as long as cities are de facto required to chase mobile capital at the no-look insistence of states and at the expense of the well-being of citizens, there is no parity, there is no working class, blue collar, ‚Äúclass‚Äù distinction. only the will of big business. 		12/x
‚Ä¢ EVs and AVs are still cars, still take up a lot of space, still require graveyards to sleep, and will not save  us. @humantransit sold me on this, fully: technology will not solve a geometry problem. 		11/
‚Ä¢ if you do not talk about land use in equal measure with transportation you‚Äôre a neoliberal cog and are hurting every cause. 		‚Ä¢ there is no such thing as a public-private partnership. there is only an acceptance of the imbalance of power. 		10/
‚Ä¢ abolishing single family zoning is not a panacea. without right-sizing accessibilty, making more allowances for high density won‚Äôt compel developers to do anything differently. if SF is the norm (right of wrong) signaling from on high that we want different policy is DOA. 		9/
my point: there‚Äôs a way to be a smart extremely online person and there‚Äôs a way to spew nonsense wrapped in feel-good easy takes. here‚Äôs my list. 		8/
if the current approach is right, and we‚Äôre rich with supply in non primary cities‚Äî20-33,000‚Äîand there‚Äôs low/medium unemployment and people have access to safe and reliable and choice transportation then why is this still a problem?		7/
if you accept the premise that class == human experience == (in)adequate affordable, meanigful, with-dignity housing, then that means the work is done. i don‚Äôt accept this premise because lived experience =\= smartest boy urbanist takes and easy neo-liberal wedge. 		6/
i don‚Äôt think people hide behind the law in everyday life. i just think very smart people are picking outcomes and then filling in the constituencies accordingly. it‚Äôs a 1-to-1 fix mostly so it‚Äôs easy to let the language slip. class and status and sector line up...		5/
or at the state level (preemption?) or at the federal level (case law? scotus precedent?). even euclid, the landmark zoning case that legalized the broad use of police power to regulate the mix or non-mix of uses, is inadequate. hiding behind the law is unhelpful 		4/
i have no idea why i‚Äôm wading into this but we don‚Äôt have the language to make the affordability case effectively at the local level (zoning reform? sounds archaic and wealth-whistling) or at the regional level (LITHC? growth boundaries?) 		2/
there is a wide, seemingly endless chasm between ‚Äúclass analysis‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman experience,‚Äù and speaking about one without the other is reductive and speaking about both is academic and lethargic. 	 	1/

@MarketUrbanism EVEN if the capital costs could be ameliorated or greatly reduced to something ...reasonable? has ANYONE stopped to ask about the real practicality of these stations, are there more cost effective solutions and has this been vetted for access improvements. delete.

@alexbaca thank u. i read this article in harper's recently: https://t.co/CEkConSPvy and thought it got at a very different, more nuanced take. the difference is that the slow divergence to monoculture in nyc is not out of smugness but out of seemingly spite. i'd love to hear your take.

@AVGregR @CarTalkDC @BlackFinnDC It‚Äôs happy hour week
if all @voxmedia was #borders, i could take it seriously. this is a good take, and should be read with rackless abandon (heh). https://t.co/7zQsPOPJ2j
as commenters, we have a right to make editorial asides about our feelings, but let's not make a BIG IDEA out of a cheeky take. it's ugly and shallow. 		that's all.
i wish the development was more mixed-income friendly, i wish the bookstore was less politics, less prose, and more iconic, too. i wish the shake shack was white manna from my home county in northern new jersey.
nothing was taken away here, except the maybe(?)-not-really-superfund site languishing away. so it's fine, but i still find myself avoiding the "fake" irish pub. [how could it be REAL? it's not in ireland.]
but it's boring because nothing is NEW and ALL of it is familiar. and that's FINE. but it's not what i want. if cava became a district, this would be it. sheeny and pastiche, it serves its purpose. 		big difference between the wharf, and say some beloved neighborhoods elsewhere.
the wharf is fine. it's a place where you can go in DC, and it was new/shiny for a few months, and now it's settling into the cyclical retail/housing economy. 		it's mostly transit accessible, but it also has A LOT of parking. it's relatively denser than lots of DC.
a local example: DC's wharf, erected seemingly out of development lego, which turned a nothing into a something space. no it's not authentic, no it's not mixed-affordability (yet), and no, i don't like it. 		the kicker: i don't have to, because it wasn't made for me.
because there isn't enough space, there's not enough money, and there isn't a modern thread of what it means to be american, what it means to be urban in 2018.
not that i don't: but the intent here matters. that's where we get into tricky dialectics about authenticity, creative culture, and who has the right to demand either in our spaces. 		no one, and that's what makes planning so tricky. everything's bending away from post-modernism.
i have this strong aversion to monoculture, too, but i agree with @alexbaca that this take is extraordinarily shallow. 		for me it comes down to the writer her/himself: i (and it matters because this is my thought) don't know if i necessarily believe this person's motivations.
@TransitScreen It‚Äôs not the speed it‚Äôs the way the streets are designed and how daily life is treated.

No. Pedestrian deaths are up nationwide fueled by cars that drive unsafely on roads that were designed for that purpose. 		This type of journalism is poorly thought out and a good example of how numbers can lie. 		Walking while drunk is not illegal either so what‚Äôs with this? https://t.co/FPvHg7SSvW
@AndrewKorf @BrentToderian @USATODAY @schlthss @humantransit Getting rid of individually owned cars, as a government mandate, is as of now also illegal outright. I think government can encourage sustainable solutions through broad-based policy that‚Äôs rooted in solving the geometry problems.
@AndrewKorf @BrentToderian @USATODAY @schlthss @humantransit I hope this is the case too. I will stress access to opportunity and mobility choice as my ultimate flagpost here because government, implicitly or explicitly, picking winners rather than allowing people to choose based on good market solutions how they travel scares me.
@AndrewKorf @BrentToderian @USATODAY @schlthss How can you guarantee that though? What if sometimes there‚Äôs 3, sometimes 0, and most of the time 1? Like @humantransit says, solving a mobility problem that is rooted in geometry can‚Äôt be solved with technology. There‚Äôs just no way around it. Why don‚Äôt we focus on transit?

We can do better. 5/5
Parking is killing our freedom. Lack of mobility choice is killing our freedom. But we‚Äôre free to drive wherever. Except it costs every a lot to drive. 		So: I love that this system exists. It‚Äôs an engineering marvel at the expense of a humanist one. 4/x
The system is working as it was supposed to. Cars can move mostly unbridled from sea to shining sea. Trucks and freight can move long distances for costs ‚Äî ever decreasing. But we‚Äôre less free than ever. 3/x
The highways act was a Great Leap Forward for the perpetuation of car travel in the us. Politicians loved it for shininess; president Eisenhower loved it for military; ordinary Americans loved it for the freedom that was promised. 2/x

So let‚Äôs focus on maintenance and safety and let‚Äôs all pay for it. We can do a ‚Äúmini-globalization‚Äù within the US. Let‚Äôs talk more about how making train travel cheaper, more plentiful and more reliable is a boon to everyone in the US.

in short: 		DOW up 5000 points is fine?, still not terribly important to the people Rs care about.
instead, many of the world's biggest companies play balance sheet games to pay 0% in taxes anyway. an AMT floor and a tremendous ceiling would do great things for this country. 7/
a 70+% tax rate on corporate profit would force companies that claim to care about their workers (unlikely, with a few exceptions) by ploughing the money that could be profit back into R&amp;D or employee training. 6/
or pay dividends to their investors because that's what the quarterly economy demands of business in 2017. 		CUSTOMERS create jobs; demand for innovative products create jobs.		4. a HIGH corporate tax rate would do MUCH more to stimulate the economy and here's why: 5/
3. having a strong DOW/NASDAQ/index_fund.jpg doesn't mean jobs because 		a. wealthy people don't create jobs	b. businesses with low corporate tax rates don't create jobs.		they 		a. pocket this money or funnel it away elsewhere 	b. use it buy back stock 4/
can anyone tell me if this is the largest yoy gain in history, adjusted for inflation and the drift of firms in and out of the DOW? how about a five-year trend? tbh, unless you're a volume trader, a yoy gain doesn't mean anything to you. 3/
unless they're lucky enough to have an investment account, which will pay off in the future...if the DOW + companies stay strong forever. i hope that they do. 		2. it is important to put this into historical context. 2/
yea, okay but a few things: 		1. most people don't gain anything when the DOW goes up. it's a good sign for the macroeconomy, investor confidence, strength of business, etc. but the average american sees almost $0 of this. 1/ https://t.co/sEF26v9PtJ
