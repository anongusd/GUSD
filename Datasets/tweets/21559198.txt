Worrying won’t stop the bad stuff from happening. It just stops you from enjoying the good.
Common sense is like deodorant, the people who need it most never use it.
People never remember the million times you have helped them, only the one time you don’t.
Everyone has gone through something that has changed them in a way that they could never go back to the person they once were.
Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.
Sometimes you have to know when to stop hoping.

Granted, there is no way to really count how many people keep their top New Years resolutions, but the concept remains the same: New Years resolutions are made just for us to look good in front of our friends at New Years, and are quickly forgotten when they become inconvenient.
Many of the top New Years resolutions are made by people who will keep them for exactly long as they are convenient, and the minute the resolutions become a challenge to keep they are dropped like a very hot pot being grabbed with bare hands.

That one cup in your house that is somehow better than every other cup.
The first person you think of in the morning or last person you think of in the night is either the cause of your happiness or your pain.
A burp is just a fart that took the elevator.
You can’t let one bad moment spoil a bunch of good ones. Don’t let the silly little dramas of each day get you down.
Imagine how fun Pringles would be if the cans were spring-loaded.
Few things in life are more pleasurable than turning off the lights in a public bathroom while people are still inside.
Everything happens for a reason. Sometimes that reason is that you’re stupid and make bad decisions.
Is it just me, or are the people who claim they hate drama, actually the most dramatic people i know?
When writing the story of your life, don’t let anyone else hold the pen.
A rumor goes in one ear and out of many mouths.
People who like to judge and throw accusations around are really just trying hard to cover up their own issues and insecurities.

Gone are the days when the old country doctor would drive out to your house and amputate your infected leg for a basket of goose eggs and a rhubarb pie.
Some relations are like TOM &amp; JERRY. They tease eachother but can’t live without eachother.
Bring back hanging, I say! These tumble driers are useless.
The world would be a cleaner place if we gave blind people brooms instead of canes…
I feel bad for lions at zoo. How would you feel if a bunch of pizzas came to your house, took your picture, and you couldn’t even eat them?
Going to McDonald’s to get a salad is like going to a brothel for a hug.
Ladies, if a man says he will fix it, he will. There’s no need to remind him every 6 months about it.

Tip to reduce weight, first turn your head to the left and then turn it to the right. Repeat this exercise every time you are offered something to eat.

Men are like a fine wine. They start out as grapes, and it’s up to women to stomp the shit out of them until they turn into something acceptable to have dinner with.
Just wondering why brain cells die, skin cells die, your hair follicle die, but fat cells live FOREVER?
Any man who laughs at women’s clothes has never paid the bill for them.
Never be fooled by what you see on the outside, b’coz on the inside it’s often a different story.

My grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was sixty. She's ninety-seven now, and we don't know where the hell she is.

Why do men fart more often than women? Because women do not keep their mouth shut long enough to build up the pressure.....I’m expecting a lot of replies from women now 👻👻👻👻👻👻
@samsparkes999 I saw a notice outside a police station which read: MAN WANTED FOR ROBBERY. So I went in and applied for the job.
Admit it, at least once in our life we have all tried to balance the light switch between the on and off position.

@NickDixonITV Hi, devastating news in Italy, my thoughts are with everyone who lost loved ones. This should have never happened.
If a man says you’re ugly he’s being mean. If a woman says you’re ugly she’s envious. If a little kid says you’re ugly, you’re ugly.
Some consider Romeo and Juliet a tale of true romantic love. Sure, if you consider 2 underage kids in a relationship that lasted 3 days causing 2 suicides and 3 murders romantic.
