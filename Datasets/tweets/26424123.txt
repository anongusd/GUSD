I remain dedicated to working with the President — and in a bipartisan fashion with all my colleagues in Congress — on a consistent basis to fix our broken immigration system and create a framework that works for all Americans.
This shutdown has gone on long enough, has hurt patriotic public servants in the process, and only serves to undermine our credibility abroad. 		It is time to come together. 		It is time to end this shutdown.
A full solution to end the security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border must include constructing physical barriers, providing the latest technology,  authorizing more boots on the ground, and closing the legal loopholes in our current immigration system.
Today’s announcement exhibits the President's leadership &amp; willingness to negotiate a solution to secure our borders &amp; end this government shutdown for the American people. I urge Congressional leaders of both parties to accept the President’s proposal and reopen the government.
Happy Birthday to the Leader of @HouseAppropsGOP and fellow Texan, @RepKayGranger.

Democrats need to put their dishonest talking points away and take their own advice. The American people have demanded action and it’s time to deliver.
Ending the partial shutdown without solving this problem will make the situation worse in the future. Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Chuck Schumer lecture others about putting politics aside and doing what’s best for the country.
It was authorized by the Secure Fence Act in 2006 and supported by Chuck Schumer. This kind of flip flop is proof that the Democrats are just playing politics. Where is their counter offer?
The President has shown good faith by dropping his funding demand from $25 billion to $5.7 billion and for accepting a steel barrier instead of a concrete wall. A similar barrier already exists along parts of the border.
This week, Democratic leaders walked in front of the cameras and said they want border security but refused to compromise at all. This is politics at its worst.
In June, every single Democrat in the House voted against my bill to build a barrier, put more boots on the ground, provide advanced technology, close legal loopholes, and create a permanent fix to DACA.  https://t.co/8EnCuG2yPe
There is no question that this is a longstanding national security and humanitarian crisis.		Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress are simply un-interested in securing our border and the country is suffering because of it.
Drugs smugglers, violent gangs like MS-13, human traffickers, and even potential terrorists are overwhelming our southern border and infecting our neighborhoods. Families with small children are making the dangerous trek across hundreds of miles and putting their lives at risk.

What an exciting day - the Childhood Cancer STAR Act is now law! By elevating the fight against childhood cancer at the National Institute of Health, and giving them more tools to be more effective in this fight, we will find the best solutions and care for our children.
Today is the 29th anniversary of the violent crackdown on peaceful protesters in Tiananmen Square.  Almost 3 decades later, we must continue to stand with the people of China in their quest for freedom and democracy.
Today on #NationalCancerSurvivorsDay, I’m looking forward to @POTUS signing the Childhood Cancer #STARAct into law next week! This legislation will allow us to celebrate even more pediatric cancer survivors and cultivate better treatment options for their long term health needs.

The JCPOA emboldened Iran, filled its coffers with billions in cash to expand its support for terrorism and grow their influence in the region. They cannot continue to receive the benefits of sanctions relief while pursuing a foreign policy that endangers the U.S. and our allies.

To those who make cybersecurity your day job—thank you for what you’ve done, what you are doing &amp; what you will do to defend us #RSAC2017
Looking back, 2016 was a watershed year in cyberspace.  #RSAC2017
And we must respond to [these cyber] attacks decisively. #RSAC2017
To prevail against online adversaries we must defend our government institutions, our critical infrastructure, and our democracy. #RSAC2017
I've proposed the creation of a single, stronger cybersecurity agency at @DHSgov, building on laws we have passed in recent yrs #RSAC2017
So I am pushing to make the lanes of responsibility more clear. #RSAC2017
Btwn companies, government agencies, and U.S. allies, we have the threat data to stop many intrusions. Yet the sharing is too weak #RSAC2017
Our cyber prophecies are coming true, and such attacks have the potential to jeopardize the very fabric of our republic. #RSAC2017
It’s clear to me that our adversaries are turning digital breakthroughs into digital bombs. #RSAC2017

My statement on senseless tragedy in #Orlando is here: https://t.co/Xpl6oX6Rhe
Instead, tragedies like this only strengthen our resolve to fight back against terror &amp; prevail over extremism wherever it emerges.
But Americans will not be intimidated by these fanatics.
It is a sobering reminder that radical Islamists are targeting our country and our way of life.
This appears to be the worst terrorist attack on American soil since 9/11.
I want to thank local law enforcement for their bravery in responding to this massacre.
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this senseless tragedy, their families, and the people of Orlando.
