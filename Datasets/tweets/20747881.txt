‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be easy, and it won‚Äôt happen overnight, but we can work together to meet the challenges our country faces. We can do this differently. For our country, for our future, for Sen. McCain, and for each other I think we must.‚Äù
‚ÄúAs your Senator, that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôll do. Not by calling names or playing political games, but by showing up and doing the work to keep Arizona moving forward.‚Äù
‚ÄúA few months ago, we lost a legend who exemplified all the best of AZ. Sen. McCain is irreplaceable, but his example will guide our next steps. He taught us to assume the best in others, to seek compromise instead of sewing division, &amp; to always put country ahead of party.‚Äù
‚ÄúDuring this campaign I have been honored to meet with thousands of Arizonans in their workplaces, in coffee shops, in neighborhoods. Listening to their stories reminded me each and every day why we do this work and how much is left to do.‚Äù

Our #USAact has 50+ cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. This bipartisan path forward protects Dreamers and funds effective border security technologies. Democrats &amp; Republicans in Congress have agreed on this solution. I urge leadership to bring our bill forward for a vote.
The govt shutdown is over but our work is far from done. There are bipartisan solutions in the House &amp; Senate to create a long-term budget, fund our military, strengthen the border, &amp; protect Dreamers. There is a commitment from leadership to get this done. Let's get to work.
Those who say my way or the highway, point blame, and name call are more focused on the next election than helping the American people. Those people should step aside and let the adults solve our country‚Äôs problems.
I want to fund the military, reauthorize KidsCare, protect Dreamers, and strengthen the border. We have solutions in the House and Senate to solve these problems - what we don‚Äôt have is a willingness from leadership to bring them up for a vote.
This shutdown wasn‚Äôt necessary &amp; it needs to end now. The bill House leadership brought forward wasn‚Äôt a serious solution. These short-term patches are costly political games that risk our nat'l security. Military leaders say CRs are a waste of money - they need stable funding.
