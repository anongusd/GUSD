@epi_michael The teams supporting P3  will target a variety of viral pathogens, including influenza, chikungunya, MERS-CoV, and Mayaro virus, among others. DARPA intends to demonstrate the broad utility of the platform.
@epi_michael Based in part on preliminary successes under ADEPT program, we launched the Pandemic Prevention Platform to fill in capability gaps on ID-ing most potent antibodies &amp; delivering nucleic acid. P3 is underway now, and the goal is it applies to any pathogen. https://t.co/JekcxdKR9t https://t.co/G8I9V971eJ
Moderna’s announcement is available on the company’s website: https://t.co/3osw3WRaBU.  Information on DARPA’s ADEPT program is available at: https://t.co/KD93r538cM.
Over the next several months, the clinical trial will generate critical data on safety and antibody expression profiles to inform future development of mRNA-1944 and other gene-encoded antibodies.
DARPA funded manufacturing of mRNA-1944 and pre-clinical studies; Moderna is funding the Phase I clinical trial. The antibody was discovered by Dr. James Crowe at @VUMChealth, working as part of the Moderna-led team on the ADEPT program.
Yesterday, Moderna announced the dosing of the first subject in a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of mRNA-1944 via intravenous infusion in healthy adults. This is the first time an mRNA-encoded antibody has been tested in humans!
As part of this work — initiated under the ADEPT program — DARPA entered into a cost-share relationship with @moderna_tx to pursue development and testing of mRNA-1944, a gene-encoded antibody that protects against chikungunya virus.
Additionally, it’s possible to rapidly manufacture significant quantities of these nucleic acid “blueprints,” delivering countermeasures at the scale and pace required to prevent an outbreak from becoming an epidemic.
Following direct delivery to a person, these countermeasures work quickly; cells begin producing and secreting antibodies within hours, providing near instantaneous protection against threat exposure.
For past several years, DARPA has been pioneering a powerful new type of countermeasure against infectious disease called gene-encoded antibodies. They work by providing cells with genetic instructions for producing one or more highly protective antibodies against a given threat. https://t.co/h2gz8fuOXJ
Fresh out of our Information Innovation Office, the Guaranteeing AI Robustness against Deception (GARD) program aims to develop a new generation of defenses against adversarial deception attacks on machine learning (ML) models. https://t.co/8LivH01H2m https://t.co/5mH7H5Puq0
Turning “national immune system” vision into reality requires partnerships across federal/state/local governments. One of the biggest benefits would be flexible, on-demand deployment of countermeasures that overcomes traditional manufacturing, distro &amp; delivery challenges.
Per DARPA’s vision, component technologies would need to be always at the ready, generalizable across bio-threats, and able to recognize threats and respond proportionally. The integrated system would need determine right combo of when/where/how to deploy responses.
Some of the capabilities already being demonstrated by the Biological Technologies Office offer a preview of components that would comprise such a system. For instance, the Pandemic Prevention Platform is developing tech for rapid countermeasure production. #VUMCDarpaSprint https://t.co/4zA6IDYWuS
DARPA is thinking about how the interagency might construct a framework in which DARPA-developed and demonstrated sensing and countermeasure technologies could be integrated and deployed to deliver resilient homeland defense.

Today, DARPA’s Justin Sanchez testified to @BiodefenseStudy on biodefense in national security context.

Per the study authors, the ease &amp; speed of its administration (single intravenous infusion administered over 30 mins), and its formulation as a freeze-dried powder that does not require freezer storage would make mAb114 advantageous in an outbreak setting.
mAb114 is a single monoclonal antibody that binds to the core receptor-binding domain of the Zaire ebolavirus surface protein &amp; prevents the virus from infecting human cells. Prior studies showed it can protect monkeys from Ebola when given as late as 5 days post-infection.
mAb114, an investigational Ebola treatment, is safe, well-tolerated, and easy to administer, according to findings from an early-stage clinical trial published in The Lancet. https://t.co/z47QcYBMXO https://t.co/MHwbdzxVEW

KAIROS will explore how to understand complex events by developing a semi-automated system that identifies, links &amp; temporally sequences their subsidiary elements, identifying participants of complex events &amp; subsidiary elements, &amp; identifying complex event type.
Within this context, our Knowledge-directed Artificial Intelligence Reasoning Over Schemas (KAIROS) program will develop mixed-initiative systems that can identify complex events and bring them to the attention of users.
Many important events are not simple occurrences, but complex phenomena that are composed of numerous subsidiary elements, some of which happen simultaneously, while others are sequential and dependent on each other.
Rapid comprehension of world events is essential to nat'l security, but task is complicated by the exponential growth of unstructured, multimedia information. Vital early indicators are often overlooked in the sheer amount of information available. https://t.co/VwtyyYqONV

PREPARE will focus on 4 key challenges as proofs of concept for what could ultimately become a generalizable platform that can be adapted to emerging #publichealth &amp; natsec threats: #influenza infection, #opioid overdose, #organophosphate poisoning, &amp; exposure to gamma radiation.
As envisioned, PREPARE technology would preserve underlying genetic code exactly as it is &amp; only temporarily modulate gene activity via #epigenome &amp; #transcriptome. This would establish the capability to deliver programmable, but transient, gene modulators to confer protection.
Protection against common pathogens &amp; environmental stressors is written into our DNA, but those innate responses aren't always sufficient.

@NeuroTechX Thx. We're happy to have the opportunity to provide some ground truth about what's currently possible, set expectations about what's becoming possible, and promote dialogue about how that technology should unfold.
@neuronbomb DARPA is unabashedly part of Defense Dept &amp; we consider natsec implications first &amp; foremost. However, the reason we talk about what's mostly university-led fundamental research is we want others to know what's becoming possible so they can help shape how it manifests #BDYHAX2018
@neuronbomb The truth is that others DO have to grapple with implications. It's DARPA's mission to explore outer limits of tech &amp; understand implications for security.

@VeronikaMeduna @BioHeritage_NZ Thank you for sharing. We've been attempting to correct record &amp; make clear we do not fund GBIRd. As we've said consistently, the focus of our research is on building a biosecurity toolkit for this rapidly advancing tech. DARPA does not fund open release. https://t.co/h6Fy1rqQun
@BulletinAtomic That is incorrect. Safe Genes is budgeted at $65M &amp; was created to build a biosecurity toolkit against accidental or intentional misuse of gene editing tech, which is advancing at a rapid pace in labs around the world, but w/o, until now, a focus on safety https://t.co/h6Fy1rqQun

From “Molecule Man” to “The DARPAnthropologist,” our Voices from DARPA #podcast has been opening revealing windows on how DARPA works &amp; on the expansive minds of the program managers who redefine what is possible. https://t.co/np3txtH3Zi @SI_Invention @SocHistTech https://t.co/wRfQmDE47S
@HealthRanger That is patently untrue. The science of gene editing has been advancing at a rapid pace in labs around the world. DARPA's investment is aimed at developing a biosecurity toolkit to defend against accidental or intentional misuse of these technologies. https://t.co/h6Fy1rqQun
@StopTechnocracy The science of gene editing has been advancing at a rapid pace in labs around the world. DARPA's investment is aimed at developing a biosecurity toolkit to defend against misuse of this tech &amp; collecting empirical data through lab-based demos to understand how it functions.
Our newest program envisions an ocean-based “internet of things” made of small, low-cost floating sensors to improve maritime awareness on the open seas.

@tdechant The teams funded by Safe Genes conduct university-led fundamental research exclusively in contained, biosecure facilities. Teams are required not only to share data, but to actively engage w/ ethicists, policymakers, regulators &amp; other stakeholders to increase value of science.
@tdechant DARPA publicly announced the Safe Genes program in 2016 and kicked off research in 2017 to develop biosafety/security tools for all types of gene editing tech, including gene drive, and to establish ground truth on how such tech works. https://t.co/h6Fy1rqQun.
@SAWEvans As a funding agency, DARPA can't promote policy, but we support active engagement on potential ELSI issues. Safe Genes requires teams to engage ethicists, policymakers &amp; potential stakeholders to increase value of science by structuring experiments to address questions/concerns.
The #DARPAHackfest looked for ideas and talent applying software-defined radio (SDR) to unmanned aerial vehicles. As more and more wireless devices come online, SDR will be required to make efficient use of spectrum. https://t.co/CkBo57HW7e
