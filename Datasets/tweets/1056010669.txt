Problem with people wanting an individual taking a tribe's word to the head without able to speak their peace; is a violation of justice.
I will work hard in a diverse culture who is still hard against white people coming into the work environment, on top of, white people hating me. Their tribe can see my heart is strong, but I will fail when I get to succeed.

@nfl is domestic violence, is it just a hit only by men, can it be mental abuse, can it be what women do too?
I wont laugh a shakey voices but dont mind me when ignore you its me not you
@nfl If The Bears are going to beat the Lions defense they need to establish the pass to open up the run, mixology of play calling
@nfl helmet to helmet and look at the sportsmanship between the two players shaking it off
The streets want to conform you by showing that nobody likes you
Everyones voice is heard besides mine.
America is freedom of religion and when I say I am not Catholic but I am a believer in Gods and Christ I am outcasted, told I need a lesson

The streets loose respect fast over someone but turn around rob, steal, lie, cheat, and do drugs.
The streets say make your point but we will hold it to you, if you say "you have to accept losing" the streets will will make you lose

When you are cut off from friends or family nothing can re create the bonds of good relationships, history has an impact of good times
The streets find out what gets under your skin then use it to torture you.
Was looking forward to my day off but am needed to work now I look forward to make money.
The streets thrive on causing pain to hearts so they know how it feels as if the streets are perfect individuals
Its a passing shoot out and a dumble re covery game @Saints  @Ravens
Its a great feeling to see your team win, have a few beers and wake up to a day off.
@DezBryant Great play Great Catch
@dallascowboys Tony Romo pumped faked the whole audiance
The steeets found a scandle to move up in life without effort, blame an individual for causing pain, lie your way up.
@dallascowboys  Philly is 8 - 3 stay focused cowboys
@ good to see the cowboys brush it off and bounce back
@dallascowboys Go 11 11 !!!!
@nfl how is it a penalty not charged before a time out, white supremacists refrees, making rules up as they go
@ForbesTech whats the % that use their phones to do banking
The streets dont want to make changes for productivity they watch others get them fired then flip the leaf and claim the did.
They want to inflict pain at the same time they hide the same shame
The streets will fuck your girlfriend laugh about it and then say we are just joking, white race being disrespected.
The hardest achievments is rebounding from your mistakes changing your life and getting others to see.
The streets will suck you in but only you can overcome what some believe is the way to live.
When you ignore someone for a good amount of time dont expect them to respond to you when you thinks its time.
@quotedojo the bottom meets the top and settles with the majority
The streets say you wont get respect from us because you want to meet company standards
When your at work your there do your best to rock out
The streets say a poser is someone who wont stealm lie, cheat ext.
Standing under someone is a good way to learn, standing by someone is a good way to live
Life is not fair, its one foot in front of the other and a cup of coffee
I am soft and I am firm
The streets say lets us take your name and your skills this will help you gain respect and then they never stop.
Cold is your mother who took your life from you and jow you make everyone you can feel the same
Looks like
Do companies like their employees to work slow, and not meet the numbers, it seems that is the new trend "as long as the majority is happy"
One word a bully does not like to hear "No"
I csn see a future will the poor will give it their all and that wont be good enough, they will be told their best is not good enough.
Because a girl wants you it does not mean she is the right girl.
She told a man who lived through pain "see the world has not ended" the man rsponded "my world ended"
They say if this happens or that happens I will be happy, then again thay ask and again to gain what they want
Ton0day was a long working day with a curveball, Im tired and wish I could get away from my past its making me go crazy.
Sitting in the dark makes one go crazy, no one to trust makes one go crazy, one good thing this life is still kine to live.
The streets will put in the dog house so they can study and find the answer to get them selves out when they fuck up
@quotedojo that means mispelling is a good thang
A thug- does not give a fuck about the world, A gangster- prideful/does not take blame, a G - excels in life/learns from his or her mistakes
The streets say finish this list and then we will respect you, then when you complete they will say you should not have trusted us.
Brunch- eggs, waffles, and sausage dont forget syrup
Their actions are showing they are antisemitic
In from the streets winning is all that matters, no matter the cost.
@nfl @dallascowboys @DezBryant Dez is not a greedy player, he has learned from his mistakes, hes a team player who wants the ring.
Ahhh, clothes fresh out the dryer nothing beats warm underware!
Be carefule what you put in a search bar you never know what you might get.
When someone in the kitchen has a knife be careful not to run into them
Word from the streets, people only want to laugh dont worry about the rest of what life is the bottom line dont care just laugh, easy 4 u.
Trapped until I can make the changes, and even then my freedom we only be me moving forward, I am a man with a heart too.
Work done back tomorrow then two off,
I dont like the games you play, they do, go continue to play, I learn to say no, I dont want to fall to your games I dont know how to play.
@MeetAnimals so is the expression of the lion in the back
I found the people I have met in life are just people at the poker table.
To see how fast my life was put into dark to find there is no friend to keep me connected, I tred  my waters slowly, I dream to leave.
The short comings in life make living feel longer and harder.
Blank
Just in from the streets all you have to do is act/pretend in any manner to accomplish your objective
They knew the story I am would send them up why they pushed me then why they push me now, they knew the scandel and they needed one.
Watched a movie called Prisoner creepy movie to me
The new line on the street is I dont want to work with him or her, and it works.
At times even after my changes in life I sense I am being forced to live despondent.

They want to make a man out of you first but as you see what their about you have to find better leaders
The girl who knows it all always loose it all, because she forgot science learns from errors
They dont want to take any responsibility for their actions and retaliations their masters at passing the blame.
