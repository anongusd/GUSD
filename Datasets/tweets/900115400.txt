@dansleezer I do not rely on Glenn G for any information
@Staffingals @gregolear @CynBlogger @KenDilanianNBC @MSNBC @SIRIUSXM @maddow @TheLastWord @DeadlineWH @SethAbramson I agree and when Ken went after Seth that was the first red flag for me. Now he's worse and spreading BS for Burr, daily. However, I can't allow myself to go uninformed and many on MSNBC are honest, hard working truth tellers. Something happened to Ken, I'd love to know what
@sarahkendzior Do you have any guesses as to why @KenDilanianNBC is amplifying Burr's lies? I am truly confused by Ken at this point and why NBC is allowing one of it's reporters to spread BS rightwing propaganda when the facts clearly point to a conspiracy and that Burr is in on the con.
@emptywheel Why do you think reporters like @KenDilanianNBC are helping @SenatorBurr amplify lies and propaganda? I am truly curious wtf is up with that guy and NBC since all facts point to Burr being in on the con and gaslighting the nation. Any input from you on this would be amazing
@jwgop @KenDilanianNBC - Why do you continue to report Burr's nonsense about no evidence of conspiracy? Why are you taking @SenatorBurr at his word when all facts point to him being a liar who helped Trump cheat to win? Why are you helping spread propaganda, Ken?
@Staffingals @gregolear @CynBlogger @KenDilanianNBC @MSNBC @SIRIUSXM @maddow @TheLastWord @DeadlineWH That seems drastic considering the numerous other great reporters. I would like to know why he is spreading Burr and Trump's propaganda but am not willing to sacrifice Maddow for it.
@gregolear @CynBlogger Yet, somehow, Burr is a media darling that is doing an amazing job investigating the Trump/Russia scandal! He is lying to us daily and has been for years, yet somehow, @KenDilanianNBC continues to report Burr's lies as fact and seems to be aiding in  gaslighting all of us.
@nytimes The truth is not complicated! She was taken out of context and misquoted. Now can we please just get back to HRC's emails and Benghazi..... https://t.co/S2Iu3FiFVe
@rgoodlaw I'd love to know why @KenDilanianNBC keeps reporting on Burr as if he is a legitimate source that's being honest with the public. The man is a liar and in on the con. What's up with yo, Ken? Are you a liar too?
@AdamParkhomenko Yet two years later he’s still in office and still getting every cabinet nominee confirmed. The entire Republican Party is a disgrace. Stop Them All!
@ThePlumLineGS Why are Dems letting them is the bigger question? If the GOP was the party wanting to address Climate Change there'd be nonstop commercials running on Fox with charred cities, flooded neighborhoods and lonely polar bears drowning to scare the shit out of their voters.
@JRubinBlogger @SykesCharlie @BulwarkOnline Republican.
Since McConnell became leader, there hasn't been a single meaningful bill that would help our country, it's citizens or any other bill with basic decency to make our country a more livable place. He is compelled by greed and a bloodlust to burn it all down to own the libs.
@AdamParkhomenko Read @rgoodlaw piece on Burr and tell me something isn't very strange about @KenDilanianNBC reporting these last couple months. Burr is directly in on the Trump/Russia con and has been lying to the American people for years. So what's up, Ken? Are you a liar too?

@NatashaBertrand This story is freaking scary as hell. WE ARE BEING LIED TO! The GOP is still covering for Trump because they were all in on the con for their own greed and quest for power. There is so much DIRECT evidence that is public that this story would be funny if it wasn't so dangerous.

@GottaLaff I can confirm the majority of the country saw it coming and voted accordingly. I will go to my grave furious and the deals handed out to the cast of criminals that helped Trump steal the election are not helping negate my rage in any way.
@devans00 So true, I will have to pay for my crime while rich, white men skate on serious felonies over and over and over again!
@Truth247 @devans00 I will believe the little fish/big fish hypothesis when it comes to fruition. For now, I am furious that it appears white, rich men suffer little to no consequence for high crimes. I hope I'm wrong, but even Manafort gets to keep his mansion in Fl despite a lifetime of crime.
@politvidchannel This was no VOTER fraud, this was ELECTION fraud. The voters had no responsibility in this scam, it was REPUBLICANS who have been committing this crime for years, apparently, defrauding actual voters and stealing elections.
@JuddLegum What an absolute disgrace. Has a single Republican in power condemned this or are they too dumping elderly people's ballots? The cheating and abuse of our elections by the GOP is abhorrent and it's time to fight back with everything we've got

@GottaLaff I'm sure he will get off with a small fine and no worries. It appears rich, powerful people serve no time and just make deals to get out of paying for their crimes. Sometimes they even become President and all their minions get rich off of those crimes.
Flynn was still campaigning for Republicans in 2018! He's a traitor and will serve no time for his crimes. Where is the justice? Next time I get pulled over for speeding, I will just be honest about the crime and demand to be let off since that's all it takes apparently!
@SymoneDSanders Every single day the GOP does something utterly egregious and appalling. We read story after story of lying, cheating, cover-up's, corruption and all we can do is vote. We have no power, other than voting, to stop them and even when we win, they cheat us anyway. Truly despicable
@nytopinion @DouthatNYT This is racist and utterly offensive. I guess it shouldn't surprise me it's coming from the NYT who have become a bizarre defender of the GOP and Trump while continuing to rail against the Clintons. We are living in very troubling times
@jonathanchait It appears conservatives can all get away with high crimes, election fraud, massive corruption, power grabs and straight up rape. Obama couldn't wear a tan suit and like arugula without the media losing their shit. I am losing faith rapidly in our justice  and electoral system
@sarahkendzior @RealCookieOPuss @RickSmithShow @gaslitnation This is why I am stunned Mueller is recommending no time in jail. Flynn committed serious crimes that endanger our country all while chanting "lock her up". I know everyone sees his coop as a positive, but this asshole should have to serve some kind of sentence for high crimes

@atDavidHoffman Add this to Epstein getting off with a fine and this cynic is losing faith in our justice system. Commit treason, lie to Congress and the American people, steal an election, threaten lives and commit rape on 100’s of underage girls and just pay your way out. This sucks
@TeaPainUSA I’m not sure but they’d better be huge! Flynn committed what appear to be serious crimes along with his son. Recommending no jail time for this “lock her up” hypocrite paired with Epstein’s skate earlier, has me losing faith in actual justice in this corrupt country. Wtf!!!

@PWM62 @SallyAlbright @jzb Based on what analysis have you come to this conclusion? I truly can not stand Bernie, personally, but do support many of his positions, such as Single Payer Health Care, something the majority of Democrats also support.
@DavidCornDC The coverage of AOC from right and center left is appalling, sexist and hurtful to future younger, female candidates who take the plunge to run. She's been criticized for everything, including an occasional bad picture. It's terrible
@alanbolt @TopRopeTravis @LibsInAmerica The taxes are too high, you're right about that. However, no one is being arrested for smoking pot anymore and that's a good thing. Personally, I grow my own and it's pretty damned stony this year.
@PWM62 @SallyAlbright You posting bad pictures with memes of this young, enthusiastic woman who had the guts to run and won is truly despicable and not good for actual democracy. The criticism of this person has been remarkably sexist and clearly motivated by conservatives. Shame on you

@khayes707 Same. I am in awe of Pelosi and her detractors can sit down and watch her shine.
@reneekad @RalstonReports CA is the fifth largest economy. We are a bright blue state that proves Democratic Party policies work when administered. Kansas was bright red and utterly failing. Thanks to the Blue Wave they too can hop on the success of LIBERAL policies. 🌊🌊🌊🖕🏽gop.
@GlennThrush @SpeakerRyan No. Republicans are racists and cowards. They won’t do shit
@politico Everyone hates Trump. Everyone is laughing at him and mocking the weakling, little baby. Putin’s puppet is a disgrace and the whole world knows it except Republicans who are clearly too stupid to see it.
@RalstonReports One additional point about the “California Creep”, many of us from CA drove to Reno and canvassed for Dems for weeks leading up to the election and also helped register voters. We love our NV neighbors but the red state gun show BS has to stop, so we dug deep to GOTV

@bae_miami @juanjoarroyo23 @NateSilver538 I have been sayin this since 2016! HRC should have picked him as VP, but Brown should absolutely run for President in 2020. I am convinced he will win handily and make a mockery of Trump the BABY
@armandodkos Do you feel this way about RBG?	I agree with you that we need to have younger leadership, but not in spite of great leadership like that of Pelosi. I believe she is going to find the new leader of the house in the next 2 years and will lift this person (woman) up
@DavidLauter This lifelong Californian will never vote for a Republican, aka the party of racists, sexists and homophobes. Republicans gave a massive tax giveaway to the richest and CA is left with a higher tax bill. Our state is on fire and the GOP denies global warming 🖕🖕🖕GOP
@armandodkos Schumer is terrible at his job as Senate Dem Leader. His weak leadership has been embarrassing and I'd love to see someone take his position. Pelosi on the other hand is an absolute bad ass, brilliant strategist and exactly the right person to take on Trump and Republicans
@sam_vinograd @VP @realDonaldTrump Trump is a weakling and has the stamina of a baby. Sad
@seungminkim Uh oh, looks like rain may or may not be coming, ruuuuuuuuuuuuuun
@WalshFreedom Oh look, a white man telling women of color they're wrong about an absolute fact. Trump is a racist AND a bully. He's both and your mansplaining can be shoved up your ass.
@neeratanden Many many loud voices asked those in the media to stop falling for the caravan BS. That we saw right through the game being played by the GOP, but they insisted on running story after story. It is repulsive and 2020 is going to be horrible when the suckers are duped again.
@GenMhayden Our "President" is a weakling. He's a national disgrace for the majority of the country. Yet Republicans still love the guy. Military people in particular. What is wrong with Republicans? Seriously!
@nytpolitics Is this some kind of joke you guys play on your readers? How many times can you recycle the "Dems in Disarray" story line? It's a mockery at this point and seems like an @TheOnion article mocking your writers. Kindly shove these stories in your ass while Dems do a victory lap
@chucktodd @RepAdamSchiff Schiff is correct and despite many on the right trying to convince themselves we Democrats don't love her, we actually do. We trust her, we know she's going to hand Trump his nuts and the GOP is terrified of this amazingly successful woman. Buckle up MAGA's

@maggieNYT Easy! I denounce Farrakhan, 100%. Done.
@KarlRove @JohnJHarwood You're vile. Go away forever, Turd Blossom
@AJDMaru I find the texting so addicting and fun too. It’s better for me than phone banking which I find exhausting
@AJDMaru I’m truly grateful! I start texting for Iowa today at 3. I can’t wait to see the Nazi, Steve King go down in flames.
@InvestigateRU @politico I will believe her when it’s proven to us on Election Day. She’s lied repeatedly to the American people so why would we believe anything she says now?

@alanhe @CynBlogger Corker is a Coward. If he really wanted to hold Trump accountable he'd have endorsed @PhilBredesen for Senate. He is a typical Republican who supports the racist Republican rhetoric.
@JoeNBC I'd say it's fair to say the silence from Republicans shows they are the party of racists while supporting their racist leader.
@kdrum @ClaraJeffery @MotherJones Everything Trump touches, turns to shit.
@neeratanden Jackson was just added to my list of banned actors. What a stupid thing for him to say about those two corrupt money grubbers. I hope he plans to visit those two in prison so they can continue to not talk politics
@LynnoVen @AynRandPaulRyan @SteveKingIA @IreneHLin Aww, thanks! However, I am just grateful for the opportunity to help out in any way I can to unseat every Republican in office. I hate the motherfuckers with a deep and burning passion.

@jrezaian @Wrecksdart @washingtonpost What a silly question. Trump doesn't have any investments in Iran, so why would he give a hell? Trump is a corrupt con man who only cares about making money for himself and his family.
@ThisWeekABC THERE IS NO CONTROVERSY WITH Ammar Campa-Najjar! WTF is this shit. Duncan Hunter was arrested and indicted and is now running a blatantly racist campaign against a man who has ZERO controversy. Cut this shit out, you're hurting our discourse with this inept reporting.
@MollyJongFast We're still here!
@samstein @MonicaNocciola Yes, it's crazy, but the craziest to me is the silence and utter inaction from the entire Republican Party about this heinous statement and the 1000's of lies told just this week. They are corrupt cowards, ALL OF THEM.
@MSNBC This explains me to a tee. However, they're forgetting that we are also canvassing, text/phone banking, volunteering on multiple levels and donating piles of cash while entirely anxiety ridden and hoping that it all pays off this Tuesday.
@adamgoldmanNYT @Wrecksdart What happened to all of the bombshells pointing to multiple guilty parties in the Trump Campaign? Stone isn't running for office. Neither is Jr. Or Kushner.

@SassyKadiK I carry my bone saw everywhere. Just in case. One never knows.... right. Where my torturers at.....
@page88 Not	Just	You
@MaxBoot Disagree. Stop giving me advice. Your party cheats to win. Democrats run on issues that are supported by a majority and honesty that voters appreciate. Enough with this BS.
@politico Trump is a moron and a conman. Vote every republican out
@Mr_Electrico You've got that right. Over the last 3 days, I have texted 5300 people in Nevada. Last weekend I drove 12 hours round trip to canvass in Reno. They can chatter all they want about Warren, we will quietly volunteer our asses off until November 6th. #BlueWave
@dailykos Over our dead Californian bodies, Zinke.
@mkraju Science, who needs it?
@CharlesPPierce Is this some kind of acid flashback!?! Today we have revisited HRC's take on her husband's affair and Nader. Can somebody tell the media to fucking focus on the current crisis since I don't give a single rat's ass about that god damned blow job or Ralph Thanks 4 Bush Nader.

@davidfrum Trump lies about everything, all the time. We know this. Sadly, Republicans won't hold him accountable for anything, so I'm hoping people are ready to rise up and vote them out. Time to vote, America, our lives depend on it! #BlueWave2018
@jaketapper @ebruenig My toddler used to come up with more believable stories. This is yet another con from the circle of conmen Trump warmly embraces. The continued silence from the Republican Party on this travesty is one more reason to vote every Republican out!! #BlueWave2018

@pipenuttrichard @GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump You're not from around here are ya? Newsom's a man, Comrade
@KHolm77 @NathanHRubin Thankfully they can't. Crazy the lengths Republicans will go to in order to steal elections.
@Acosta @Norm_berry What exactly has he been waiting for? I guess Kid Rock simply could not wait and despite what looks like a major crisis, Kid Rock and Kanye gobbled up Trump's entire day..and most of the news media too.
@GiddyHeyde @BillyBirch9 @GavinNewsom @realDonaldTrump Is this man talking about Newsom's wife, the mother of his 3 children whom he's been married to for years??? Odd the standards Democrats are held to by the right while the ConMan they elected gets to raw dog porn stars as his 4 month old is home with mom.
@thehill I hate him!

@NoahShachtman @rezaaslan "That's why I will vote with Trump on literally everything," Flake added, just before collapsing on the ground sobbing and shaking. Then he shit himself and fell asleep.
@NathanHRubin Nevada stopped printing voter registration forms in JULY!! They've been out of them ever since. Thankfully the NV Democrats understood that the Federal Form works for registration. It's a little different, but it doesn't matter, we still registered new voters so suck it GOP
@JoyAnnReid If those don't count than the man has done LESS THAN nothing. If this is his play to run in 2020, I'm not sure it will work. Flake 2020, weakness, cowardice, tearful and utterly paralyzed with fear. Not exactly the winning message
@juliaioffe Their brilliance, talent, hard work and ability to not only get stuff done, but to do it better than any man before them. Pelosi was the most successful SOTH in history.
@swin24 Seconded

@jonathanalter The state of Nevada stopped printing voter registration forms in July. They’ve been out of them for months but refuse to print more. There are many ways to suppress votes and this is one of them. We still used the Federal form but it’s a bit different from the NV state form.
