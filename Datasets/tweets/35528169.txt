@Eskay1069 @InTheDarkAPM Good questions. Curtis‚Äô lawyers could ask the Court to remove Doug Evans from the case. The defense has tried that before, though, and it hasn‚Äôt worked.

3/ For example, @craftworksxyz was certain that the man had a blotch or mark on his face. He was so certain, that even though I didn‚Äôt remember seeing that, I believed Will was right - until we saw a photo of the man. The man didn‚Äôt have a single blotch or mark on his face.
2/ And it wasn‚Äôt just that I failed to accurately remember him. Our data reporter @craftworksxyz also failed the test. But what was alarming was how certain we were about details of the man‚Äôs face - details that were absolutely false.

Several people have asked me whether there‚Äôs a GoFundMe for the Forrest family, to help with the expenses from their house burning down. A family member just contacted me to let me know that one has been set up. https://t.co/ZmhkFunvnm
16/ In closing, Flowers‚Äô lawyers ask the Supreme Court to reverse the decision of the Mississippi Supreme Court. https://t.co/xPxeY1xW7r
15/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers argue that the MS Supreme Court‚Äôs reasoning (that Evans‚Äô history of discrimination and if making false statements wasn‚Äôt probative) reflects ‚Äúa crabbed view of Batson that conflicts with this Court‚Äôs precedents.‚Äù
14/ ‚Äú... and it prevents the undermining of public confidence in the criminal justice system. All of those values were diminished by the Mississippi Supreme Court‚Äôs perfunctory treatment of the evidence of discrimination in this case.‚Äù
13/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers: ‚ÄúThe prohibition against racial discrimination in jury selection ... shields individual defendants from discriminatory and arbitrary enforcement of the law; it protects potential jurors‚Äô right to participate in the administration of justice ... ‚Äú https://t.co/DjRcwTO8bj
12/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers argue that Evans misrepresented the facts about several black potential jurors he struck from the jury in Flowers‚Äô sixth trial
11/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers get into the details of jury selection in trial 6 - and Evans‚Äô striking of 5 black potential jurors. They note that Evans asked those five people a total of 145 questions - and that Evans asked the 11 whites who ended up on the jury a total of 12 questions. https://t.co/dadnkLmJ32
10/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers argue that Evans actions during jury selection in trial six ‚Äúshow greater cunning‚Äù but that the motive was the same as earlier trials ‚Äî to remove black people from the jury pool because of their race https://t.co/HfYClA01ZJ
9/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers: ‚ÄúEvans had previously won convictions of Flowers only by breaking the rules, and in this sixth trial he broke the rules again.‚Äù
8/ Flowers‚Äô attorneys also note Evans‚Äô pattern of striking black people from the jury pool across all of the Flowers‚Äô trials - resulting in juries that were either all white or mostly white. They argue that the MS Supreme Court should have considered this but didn‚Äôt.
7/ Flowers‚Äô lawyers: ‚ÄúEvans had already shown himself, at least twice in this same case, to be willing both to violate the Constitution and to try to conceal his racial motivation.‚Äù
6/ And they point out that the trial judge in Flowers‚Äô second trial found a Batson violation during jury selection and refused to let Evans strike that juror (The juror was black man Evans had accused of sleeping during voir dire. The judge said he didn‚Äôt see the man sleeping.)
5/ In the brief filed today, Flowers‚Äô lawyers argue that the Mississippi Supreme Court should have but didn‚Äôt consider Evans‚Äô record of racial discrimination in jury selection. They note that Flowers‚Äô 3rd conviction was overturned bc the MS Supreme Court found Evans discriminated
4/ But Flowers‚Äô lawyers argue the MS Supreme Court didn‚Äôt consider all relevant factors when it decided that Evans didn‚Äôt discriminate against black potential jurors in Trial 6. That‚Äôs the issue now before SCOTUS - Did the MS Supreme Ct err in how it applied Batson in this case?
3/ The Mississippi Supreme Court has already looked at whether Evans engaged in racial discrimination in jury selection (known as a Batson violation) in Flowers‚Äô 6th trial, and the MS Supreme Court found he did not.
2/ I‚Äôll tweet out some key points in the brief. But 1st, a reminder-SCOTUS is looking at a claim that D.A. Doug Evans intentionally struck black people from the jury bc of their race in Flowers‚Äô 6th trial. If SCOTUS finds that Evans did that, it will overturn Flowers‚Äô conviction.
1/ Curtis Flowers‚Äô defense team just filed their brief to SCOTUS. The State has 30 days to respond. No date set yet for oral arguments. @InTheDarkAPM https://t.co/swiDqPMP4e

@iamaherr Interesting. Did the jury deliberate for very long?
@amandakim529 Wow.
@AnnieSeifullah It seems like a lot of what can happen in a jury room comes down to which juror is the best at convincing the others that he/she is right.
@EllSeeEss1 That seems quite odd to tell the potential jurors that information.
@julysaturdayni1 In the jury pool room?!
@Jamie_Grettum That is truly terrible.
@OhFischel Interesting!
@Patrickology_ Wow.
@brewhaha20 That‚Äôs awful.
@heidi_thinks By which I mean - even though you often can take notes, there‚Äôs no way you could write down everything
@heidi_thinks It‚Äôs fascinating to me that juries seem to be one of the few places where you‚Äôre supposed to make a really difficult decision, often with a lot of information, and you often can‚Äôt review it at all.
@MegWhatevermeg I wonder if that made them more likely to convict bc they just wanted to be done with it.
@lauraisensee What was the verdict? Curious if the defense or the state ever reached out to those jurors
@harmonbell Seriously, it seem common for jurors to get struck bc they know about the topic
@harmonbell Or maybe you‚Äôre just ‚Äúbiased‚Äù toward facts and information.
@mariana1heredia @longformpodcast Glad you found it helpful!!
@MichaelRBrandt Wow. What was the verdict?

@Vitalherbalist What was the verdict?

@jhanereifsteck Yikes!
@ChantalMW Such a good point!
@MrJonCryer Did the other jurors pick up on that, too?
Because there are few things I like more than stories about jury duty ‚Äî for those who‚Äôve been on a jury or in a jury pool, what stood out to you about the experience?

Podcast recommendation for your Sunday! The City, by @rsamer. It‚Äôs a wild story of corruption, politics, the FBI, and a mysterious six-story pile of trash in a residential neighborhood in Chicago. First six episodes are out now. @thecitypod https://t.co/EBgIZ16tgp
Note: In case you‚Äôre wondering, as a reporter, I would not agree to this set of conditions.
Condition #4: The filmmakers would pay to fly Rudolf to Paris to watch the series before it was released, &amp; he could talk to the filmmakers about any scenes he thought were prejudicial for Peterson. Rudolf said he didn‚Äôt have veto power and didn‚Äôt end up challenging anything. 6/
Condition #3: Nothing would be broadcast until Michael Peterson had exhausted his appeals. 5/
Condition #2: The filmmakers would send the footage to France EVERY DAY, so that it would be difficult for the prosecution to get it. 4/
Rudolf said that condition #1 gave the defense a possible argument if the prosecutors tried to get the footage- Rudolf said the defense could say that the film was attorney-client work product. 3/
Rudolf said that there were four conditions. 1.) That when the filmmakers were filming pre-trial, the purpose of that filming would be to aid the defense in its work - to film moments that the defense could review - kind of like note keeping but on video. 2/
Also, it was interesting to find out some behind the scenes information about how the filmmakers and the defense interacted. Rodolf told the audience that there were several conditions the filmmakers and the defense agreed to. 1/
@ThisCharminManc Not sure what to make of it. I would be even more curious to see how a jury would respond to it. Would they consider it a desperate move by the defense, or a viable alternate explanation of what happened?
Spent my evening listening to Michael Peterson‚Äôs lawyer David Rudolf talk about the making of the Staircase, how junk science impacted the case, and, of course, what he makes of the owl theory.

@B1GSXY I‚Äôd recommend reading the work of Richard Sipe for insight into the role of the culture of the Catholic priesthood https://t.co/7CBr5bhRqo
13/ And one more thing. It‚Äôs important to remember that when these stories are in the news, it can be difficult for survivors and their families to hear. There are places to get help - like The National Sexual Assault Hotline 800.656.HOPE (4673) https://t.co/CmJe1IEU1Y
12/ And the Philippines. https://t.co/sBv0h6u8ZN
11/ And In Tanzania. https://t.co/Ds30SDEkcH
10/ And In Poland. https://t.co/6RjwN8lcXk
9/ In recent years, the clergy sex abuse scandal has spread, as more survivors come forward and journalists continue reporting. Like in Chile. https://t.co/kCpACrKQ99
8/ We made an audio documentary (produced by @sashaaslanian) that traced the scandal in the Twin Cities back three decades https://t.co/204S8lQw8e
7/ In 2013, our reporting found that Archbishop Harry Flynn and Archbishop John Nienstedt had approved secret payments to abusive priests. One notorious abuser had received $160,000. https://t.co/7zq1l7pU3S
6/ In 2013, I was part of a team of reporters who broke the story that the Archdiocese of St Paul &amp; Minneapolis protected priests who‚Äôd sexually assaulted kids. We found that church leaders had falsely assured parents the Church had changed. It had not. https://t.co/7wCkpyR0DD
5/ People who‚Äôve been abused by priests - and their families and their lawyers - pushed to bring stories to light - in dioceses big and small. Like in 2004, in the diocese of Davenport, Iowa https://t.co/OOUBLBTCnq
4/ In the early 2000s, there‚Äôs the famous reporting by journalists in Boston. First by the Boston Phoenix https://t.co/3OBxIDFHtp Then by the Boston Globe https://t.co/4iri6sG45o
3/ In 1987, Carl Cannon of San Jose Mercury News found ‚Äúin more than 25 dioceses across the country, church officials have failed to notify authorities, transferred molesting priests to other parishes, ignored parental complaints ...‚Äù https://t.co/cErsqSj1jW
2/ Over the past 30+ years, journalists across the United States and the world have broken story after story about coverups of sexual abuse by the Catholic Church. The first was Jason Berry in Louisiana in 1985. https://t.co/dqresScX0O
1/ With the release of the PA grand jury report showing that Catholic leaders in PA covered up sex crimes by priests, it seems like a good time to look at the history of the clergy sex abuse scandal - not just in Pennsylvania. https://t.co/ZxbWwkbQib

@chrissyteigen Please listen to our podcast, In the Dark. A man‚Äôs life is on the line. Season 2 is about Curtis Flowers. a black man in Mississippi who is on death row for a crime he says he didn‚Äôt commit. He‚Äôs been tried 6x -every time by all-white or mostly white jury https://t.co/neazfOAo9a
Okay so... how about we all convince @chrissyteigen to listen to In the Dark? https://t.co/QVj1hFB47D
@chrissyteigen Curtis Flowers is still on death row. This is a video we recorded of his father, Mr. Archie Flowers, singing in his gospel group. Music has always connected Mr. Flowers with his son Curtis. They still sing together during prison visits every two weeks. https://t.co/RY9uqv60zt
@chrissyteigen Season 2 of In the Dark is also about the power of prosecutors in this country and how rarely they are held accountable.
@chrissyteigen Listen to Season 2 of our podcast, In the Dark. It‚Äôs about a black man named Curtis Flowers who is on death row in Mississippi. He‚Äôs been tried 6 times for the same crime. I moved to MS for a year to report the story https://t.co/neazfOAo9a
8)‚ÄùThe racially discriminatory selection practice employed by [D.A. Doug] Evans violated the rights of Curtis Flowers and of the Black venire-members excluded from the jury. But the accuracy &amp; integrity of the jury‚Äôs decision-making were also casualties of Evans‚Äô discrimination.‚Äù https://t.co/dfIUywvkKW
7.) Brief: ‚ÄúStatistical evidence demonstrates that District Attorney Evans and his office exercise peremptory challenges to strike Black prospective jurors to empanel the highest-possible percentage of white jurors.‚Äù https://t.co/ukzBhjJWQy

4.) Brief: Eyewitnesses were unreliable. ‚ÄúEdward McChristian now states, ‚ÄòI wasn‚Äôt even really sure [what I had seen]. [Law enforcement] had more about it than I did.‚Äô This included the actual date on which McChristian saw Flowers, which was supplied to him by the investigator.‚Äù https://t.co/90ogWwOmp5
3.) Brief: ‚ÄúThroughout the six trials, three separate jailhouse snitches testified; each has recanted.‚Äù https://t.co/4D3FIne1Id
2.) Brief: ‚ÄúIn a racially diverse community, discrimination in jury selection threatens the jury‚Äôs ability to subject the prosecution‚Äôs case to critical scrutiny, raising the risk of wrongful convictions.‚Äù https://t.co/WFAN83kY4w
It‚Äôs worth reading the entire brief, but here are some highlights. 1.) Brief: Racial discrimination in the Flowers case violates the 14th Amendment. https://t.co/XUJUnSSH2p

@SNogg3 @FairPunishment @ShaunKing It‚Äôs not considered double jeopardy bc double jeopardy would be if you‚Äôre acquitted and you get tried again. Curtis Flowers has never been acquitted. 4 convictions and 2 mistrials. 3 convictions overturned bc of prosecutorial misconduct
@FairPunishment @ShaunKing If you want to know more about the Curtis Flowers case, check out our podcast In the Dark. I moved to Mississippi with a team of reporters for nearly a year to report full time on the case. https://t.co/neazfOAo9a
Thanks to everyone who came to @TheGreeneSpace tonight! And thank you for all the smart questions, too!
