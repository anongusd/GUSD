@TKD350 @chuckwoolery 34 people and 3 companies have been indicted or plead guilty through the independent counsel. But the Senate finds nothing wrong?
@chuckwoolery You mean the Republican controlled Senate?
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan Also... Some things are typical "lib" responses and some are typical "conservative" responses. Try to move away from the labels and see common sense. Both sides get things wrong and both sides get things right. Try to look at the person instead of the angle.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan The percentage apparently doesn't matter. Republicans are still against it. As for anyone killing being mentally ill, you were a Sargent in the US army. You enlisted knowing that you would most likely be called to active  duty. Were you mentally disturbed when I you enlisted?
I should have stayed logged out... I got work to do.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan Or how republicans are against abortions for rape victims and abused children but support the death penalty for the mentally ill.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan Insinuating that because they all read the the Quran means they think the same is like saying all Christians are the same. I went to a Lutheran University that taught that all other Christians we're going to hell because they didn't worship Jesus the "right way."
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan Islam is not a 2 sect religion. It's not just Sunni and Shiite. There are also sufi, ahmadiya, Baye fall, NOI just to name a few.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan There are Muslims that believe Jesus is more than just a prophet. It's a belief held in the more mystic influenced sects. These are the sects of Islam that are targeted by Isis and condemned as heretics.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan I think we're mixing threads here
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan It's also not true of all Muslims. But as far as the majority consensus of both Faith's go, they do not believe that Jesus is the son of God, nor do they believe in the Trinity.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan The word Allah literally means God
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan The spainish Inquisition forced the conversation of Sephardic Jews to Christianity by torture. During the crusades Jewish people were targeted by both Christians and Muslims. Not saying that no Muslims have ever persecuted any Jewish people, but Christians have put in lot of work
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan In the United States, the Ku Klux Klan, who claim to be a Christian organization, hold just as much hatred for the Jewish people as they do for black people. Hilter, who was of mixed Jewish ancestry, claimed Christianity as the one true religion and then executed the Holocaust.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan All of that is just a difference in opinion. If you have such great condemnation for Muslims, why not also have these same condemnations for Jewish people since they share the similar views on Jesus as the Muslims do?
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan But Jesus was Jewish. Are you saying that all of the Jewish people that came before him couldn't have "truly known the father?" Who was Moses talking to throughout Torah?

Republicans only talk to black people when they're pandering for votes. Democrats only utilize black people as weapons against Republicans.
The only reason that American Christians support Israel is because of their misguided desire for to he fulfillment of the Armageddon prophecy. You don't love Jewish people. You just want them to be a political pawns in your religious agenda.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan Quick apology. I've been called a libtard so much on Twitter I let one response bleed into another. But as you see, I'm not a "lib" either
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan And I'm not a "libtard." That slur was originally used against libertarians. Conservatives, like yourself just ran with it without ever doing any research. I'm not a liberal corporatist or a conservative regressionist. I believe in the freedom and progression of American people
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan And historically, Christians have committed more antisemitic actins than Muslims.
@MatchaGreenTe16 @Ilhan You do know that Muslims worship the God of Abraham, just like Jews and Christians? And being against the oppressive policies of the state of Israel don't equate to being antisemitic. There are actual Israelies that oppose Israel's policies.
@pjiusmc026 @chuckwoolery Show me the proof

When I was young, rap music was filled with the sentiment that "it ain't no fun if the homies can't have none." Most of our favorite rappers made songs about passing girls around with or without consent. These songs were not about "fun." They promoted rape culture in hip hop.

@rolexatl @DrTGIF @OGFlash As a woman you should realize it could be you. I don't worry about being accused of rape because im not a rapest. And nobody lied on tupac. That nigga was guilty. Do you know the womans name? Did you ever listen to her side of the story? Were you even alive when it happened?
@rolexatl @DrTGIF @OGFlash This isn't 1 sided at all. Its the truth. You bring up tupac but what do you really know about his case? What do you know about his accuser? What did she gain from reporting him?
