Did pres Obama think the debate was tonight?
@OBAMA_CZAR great point
Mr president the ship is sinking your plan was take buckets and bail the water the ship is still sinking maybe you plan is not working.
Let's see prezObama hit an iceberg the ship is sinking and he is blaming the captain of 4 years ago. How stupid do they think America is.
Pres Obama Says Romney is rich and doesn't care about us.  Your poor and you don't care about us you have bankrupted  us.
Is it me but does it  sound like president Obama is running for  office for the first time.  Can someone please tell him he is the President
Why,  with the media behind him, Hollywood behind him and liberal big money going to aids against Romney, is Obama 1 point ahead.
Can't wait to hear president Obama blame bush for all the embassy attacks.
The president said he has Israel's  back    HOW!   Maybe as he is pushing Israel off a cliff.
Mr president I guess spiking a football was not a good idea.
Get snoop president Obama inherited a house with one broken window    He has made it into a slum.   4 more and we will claim imitate domain
@OBAMA_CZAR @in4m8ionman great tweets always.
President gets a lift    I am happy to see someone is picking him up because we know he can't do it himself. http://t.co/BLkIPAJo
President Obamas administration is like a man leaving the car running and it runs out of gas.
Two things you will never hear said to president Obama.   Good job Mr president and you  deserve 4 more years.
@gabesmind
Mitt Romney remember democrats want power and will do anything to keep it.  Fight like the country's life depend upon you , because it does
If pres Obama wins he is going to inherit the worst condition if a country ever in its history.   What you sow that shall to also reap
Joe Biden puts his foot on his mouth but he wears his shoe at the time.
Joe Biden is the dumbest vice president in history. Blacks being chained by republicans is like him saying you need a accent to go to a 7-11
Don't worry about Paul Ryan.  If joe Biden can be vice president then anyone can.
A vice presidential candidate thats more qualified ,more Washington ready and smarter then the sitting president. Oh ya he doesn't play golf
@GeraldoRivera Don't forget john McCann was up by 9 points after the republican convention.  Late August.
Can anybody help me I want to donate some money to pres Obama.  I heard he has a Van lines moving account.
Mr president reverse robin hood?   Really ?  We have radio ads telling us how great food stamps are   We should all be in them!!!!   Thanks
Pres Obama does care for the small business in this country .  just look he is making America into a very small business.
@DennisDMZ Reagan called us a shiny city upon a hill   Pres Obama is busy pushing it off
Pres Obama believes like Reagan that this country is a shiny city upon a  hill. pres Obama is just helping to push it off the hill.
@Spone63 tony I am so sorry to hear about your brother.I will pray for you and your family.  May God bless your family through this time.
Obama: he never owned  a house before he ran he didn't own a credit card so what did we do put him in charge of billions. How is that going?
@JasonMattera great book
@MarkSimoneNY he didn't Forget that was his plan
@Spone63 amen
PrezObama comments were takin out of context "you didn't build that "He was talking about the chairs the reports in the room were sitting on
@MarkSimoneNY of course do you want to go to the same meeting and hear how bad things are more then that
Romney is officially my man.  Pres Obama bows down to kings and Romney tells them what they are doing wrong.
@marklevinshow be nice .   Give them time to find it on map .
@Spone63 the whole week ? Wow
@Spone63 @pc_design what do you want me to ask hannity
@Spone63 @pc_design the mets are just about to make their move lol
If pres Obama would've not played so much golf he would not be as good as he is putting the country in a hole
If pres Obama didn't give solyndra all that money they would have been bankrupted a lot sooner.
@michellemalkin @seanhannity your the best.   God bless you
How did the  Mayan calendar know Obama was going to be president. 	Apocalypse
Romney put his money in Switzerland  Mr president your destroying this country so much I am going to have to put my kids in Switzerland
@DennisDMZ lol
Romney seems to fight only when he is pushed    He has to keep the heat going
Pres.  Obama has to be calculating this economic failure because you couldn't put the country in this mess by accident.
Bain lost jobs?   Look at the company that your in charge of Mr. President (U.S.A.). You ran it to the ground.
We knew George bush and your no George bush mr president.   He was much better then you'll ever be.  Gov let everyone know the truth
Thanks governor I may never meet you but keep doing the work of us all
You go Romney keep telling the truth, but fight back.
@seanhannity Romney needs to let people know"you keep blaming bush. We knew bush and your no bush ".We wish he was here, his much better you
Pres Obama is the only person that can go to a $50000 a person fund raiser and say the rich are killing the world.
@OBAMA_CZAR well said
@PC_design no no.Now if Durant stripped the ball from James  and then a ball went through James hand he would have been killed in the media
It's the economy and where not stupid.
@TheRevAl Romney great answer when asked if he would of taken out bin laden he said "even jimmy carter would have". Nice answer
@Jentezen beautiful God bless her
The administration is banking on the fact that they killed Osama bin laden. The way things are going watch him show up alive somewhere
More people are leaving the country then coming in.  The way things are going do you blame them
Prez Obama is criticizing Mitt about his view on the economy.At least he knows how to make money and save it. Prs Obama knows spend spend
@alexmorgan13 playing back to back with Columbia ( slow moving) then to n Korea (fast moving)  might be tough adjustment.
@DrOz feeling sluggish all  the time
I can't say the economy is in a hole.  We can't even afford a shovel.
@seanhannity I hope the next tingly feeling chris Matthews feels  is the water running down his leg when they project Romney the winner.
Why is everybody surprised.  Secret service    That's their name and that's what they were doing

Romney at47%,  Obama at 44%   5% error swing. Romney better be up by 15% because at least 5% comes from dead people that will be voting.
Shame on the police for profiling Adis Medunjamin subway bomb plotter just because his walking with convicted imam Ahmad Afzali
