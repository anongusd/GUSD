I'm always sad when BBC Winterwatch comes to an end. But nice to think the next time we see the team will be for Springwatch, when hopefully we'll have better weather. Mind you this time, if Chris Packham hadn't been going off air anyway-he may well have been taken off. Bad boy!
Oh heck, I ony just realised about Clive Swift, too.  I actually saw him at the National theatre once...I mean, we were both in the audience to see the same play- he wasn't performing!
@richardosman I have always loved his shows.

Well, I was going to make a positive tweet today: 1 February and another beautiful day on the East Coast of Scotland. If the winter weather remains like this, I will be happy. But then I saw the sad news about comedian Jeremy Hardy.  He's my age, I loved him and I am gutted.
@RevDavidColes Yep, I fought with one of those in a Travelodge. Having nearly scorched my hand off, the waiter appeared and commented: oh is that thing playing up again?
@RevDavidColes Was it one of those weird ones, where the toast comes out the back?
@bigbatchofcumbr Yep, French Toast is something different...usually pre-bought in packet, a kind of cracker.
@lpinbrez @lichtblickpink I've booked, just hope my session goes ahead.

I feel it helps, experiencing religion.
