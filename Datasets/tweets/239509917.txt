Same. Whew. Lord that was close. https://t.co/dxXNzILRsq
Amazing how some folks have all the time in the world to parse through @IlhanMN's comments, put words into her mouth &amp; make up entire lies about her... but don't seem to have any time to see their president is a racist scamming pervert through literally everything he says.
After I gave a talk in Iowa, someone asked me "what does the Church need to do to get on the right side of justice."		"Follow God's instructions." I am a Christian, which means I believe justice for all God's people is both divine and my responsibility. Period.		Not complicated.

@Nicolesque24 A) I can discuss the mirroring of a mentality separate from power, which is what I did.		B) Are you suggesting that the US and her citizens don’t hold social power in the world? If so, that’s fascinating.		C) FYI, I’m going to stop giving you, and this, air. 		Have a nice day ✌🏾
@Nicolesque24 You can *recognize* the difference in nationality without maligning people who don’t share yours. 		The former is simply contextual. The latter is xenophobic. Period.
@Nicolesque24 You’re more offended by me saying you’re mirroring imperialism than actually mirroring imperialism??? That ain’t it.		You’re not “recognizing,” you’re *prioritizing* the struggle of US Blacks over say, Brazilian Black ppl, where the majority of enslaved Africans were docked.

@elkinnicole That’s super sweet ❤️. Thanks for what you shared!!
@DeWente69 So can I ask a sincere question? 		Is our struggle, as black US descendants of slaves, which is what I personally am, not connected with say, the Black people of Brazil, where actually more enslaved Africans were sold than in the US? 		Why would we not align our struggle?

@ashscheherazade Look, I get what you’re saying generally: the roots of the tree are rotten, and in the US, they are based in genocide and enslavement. No disagreement.		But some version white colonialism is practically worldwide. Borders don’t change that much. So to blame all immigrants...🤨
@ashscheherazade Is that true? 		I don’t concede that. I think that’s an incredible assumption to make about millions of people.
@ashscheherazade So do two wrongs make a right? I also know lots of African Immigrants who don’t operate that way. 		I also recognize how Black folks in the US have been portrayed around the world and that folks from other parts of the diaspora can &amp; do internalize/transfer oppression, too.
@ashscheherazade I understand acknowledging the differences. I don’t think I there is anything wrong w that. 		But why “Black Americans first?” I’m genuinely curious? And do you mean all Black Americans? Or Black US folks first?		I’m actually asking. Help me understand.

Oppressive structures, of course, prefer the African diaspora to be separated. 		Why? 		Because together, we are mighty and strong in number. And that scares those who subjugate us. 		It’s pretty easy to understand, user-friendly, morally bankrupt calculus.

@Reik483 Yes. But privilege operates in degrees-and the privilege of being a “political insider” simply does not compare to racial privilege. It’s disengenous and, yes, offensive to suggest otherwise.		Have a nice day.
@DerekOfTheDykes https://t.co/qRKb1RLavz
****Bernie supporters =/= Bernie Bros. Altogether different folks.
@Reik483 You should ask Jews of color that, but from my seat, he’s a white-skinned Jewish man. One doesn’t erase the other: he is both. 		And that tweet had a particular focus for a reason. Feel free to tweet what you want on your page: you don’t get to make demands of mine. Problematic.
@Reik483 I’m not saying those previous years are not a factor: they absolutely are. 		But denying that Bernie benefits from white skin privilege is very simply not ok.		I get that this is complicated, but it can’t be outright denied. You’re also erasing Jews of color w this comment.
Me: Context matters, no matter tour candidate of choice. We should especially consider the context of race and gender considering how diverse this race is.		Bernie Bros, already: https://t.co/0IRvdeOtC7

**If** it turns out this wasn’t real, which I **still** question:		Do not join white supremacists and demand apologies from people who believe survivors when the data is on our side. We have reason to believe.		Demand it from the *proven* liar(s). Not us.		https://t.co/vtYTdAVGCE
That’s that on that.
And it can’t be all police accountability all the time until y’all wanna get these memes off. That ain’t how it works. 		Again, I don’t know what happened. But I’m not quick to believe known liars and agents of state violence without incontrovertible proof. Period.
For every survivor of any kind of assault, there is but a small proportion of liars. 		Literally minuscule. And we still don’t know if that includes this situation. 		I’m not making it harder for the vast majority who are telling the truth by playing this game w folks.
I do not know what happened to Jussie. 		I do know that I’m not quick to trust a Chicago Police Department that has lied about more than a little bit, especially LaQuan McDonald. 		I also know that believing survivors is something I will never be ashamed of or apologize for.

Class dismissed. 		Tip the people of color who teach you on the way out. 		Reparations, fam.
But if your “white only” space is created to try to call the rest of us “reverse racists,” you are absolutely part of the problem. 		Your ignorance jumped out, and it was loud and wrong. 		Especially if your “whites only” space is yoga time, which y’all gentrified. https://t.co/18NZxURKnB
Your “white only” spaces *could* be a place to study the work of @timjacobwise or read “Waking Up White” or gear @GlennonDoyle and actually do your work to dismantle white supremacy and white supremacy culture in spaces where you don’t burden people of color.
White people often get stuck at “reintegration,” because society provides no rewards for them to move beyond the comforts of white privilege.		PoC, on the other hand, are often *forced to move beyond Immersion because society rewards proximity to whiteness. We “evolve” to survive
In reality, though? Marginalized people require affinity spaces, where only others like them are allowed, to develop their racial identity, and experience safety when they are otherwise often the unsafe minority. https://t.co/K3Qn0suOdF
White folks, look closely at the stage of reintegration: 		“The guilt and anxiety may be redirected in the form of fear and anger directed toward people of color, who are now blamed as the source of discomfort.” 		i.e.: “you PoC are the real racists for separating yourselves!” https://t.co/2LP0IdSTUB
Everyone experiences a development in their understanding of their racial identity. 		Here is the quick version of Racial Identity Development for white people and people of color:		(Source: the research of @BDTSpelman &amp; summarized here: https://t.co/nc92ooWf4N) https://t.co/cbKWqeCLDK

Also, FYI, white people didn’t create Yoga. I hope you can see the irony &amp; offense.
I hear you. 		We should make a clear distinction though: negro spirituals were codes enslaved people sang to one another. 		Thus, these songs weren’t born out of “the pain &amp; degradation of slavery,” but the brilliance, creativity and boldness of the enslaved. Asset vs deficit. https://t.co/0PrX3sRddQ

@LaurenMKalt Girl, same. Lol. Thank you for saying this 👌🏾
White choir directors: stop teaching traditionally black music without teaching and respecting the history. 		It’s disrespectful and affirms a tradition of appropriation. It says “it’s ours now-who cares where we got it?” You’re teaching a habit that *will* be repeated. https://t.co/ORzRuYQq2q
A freed slave, John Berry Meachum, started a church in 1825 &amp; taught black children for free.		White Missourians found this to be a threat &amp; made educating black children illegal.		So, Rev. Meachum started a Floating Freedom School on the free waters of the Mississippi. POWER. https://t.co/G29tt4KGnD

@KimShoeCrzy Also this lol.

They used to tour the Underground Railroad path and sing mostly a cappella. They’d sing traditional spirituals and ballads of the time.		All these college a cappella groups and Pitch Perfect fans? Thank, in part, the Fisk Jubilee Singers. https://t.co/eDqGwdDY12
@Tookstastic @ImaniMCheers He does. It’s annoying, high key.
@annielintzenich @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand Hey y’all!!
@shannonrwatts Lolololol
You should actually make the @FISK1866 Jubilee Singers part of your #BHM⁠ ⁠		 personal study.		They are a great part of why Negro Spirituals (or “slave songs” as they were then called) are part of the larger American consciousness at all.
I sang in a choir like this as a kid: symphonic chorale music. 		I was one of few black kids. Our parents demanded we learn the history of any Negro Spirituals we would sing. 		Also, my parents raised us on @FISK1866 Jubilee &amp; @Morehouse Glee Club music, mixed in w our gospel.
@AdamantxYves My first reaction was... https://t.co/UGS5HAt3HY
FYI, this song is derived from “Down in the River to Pray,” or “Down in the Valley to Pray,” which is a Negro Spiritual. The Fisk Jubilee Singers sang a version in the 1880s.		I love Allison Krauss’ version, but also, Black History is American History. https://t.co/dTJ8jbV2bH
@kidnoble My complaint woulda been this anglo-ized version of a Negro Spiritual since the only anglo we gave permission to sing this was Allison Krauss. https://t.co/AdMWazcPE3

@darnellwilburn I deleted and clarified this-I wasn’t suggesting voting for any of these folks; I was saying we need to stay knowledgeable about the other side.
See? I’ll admit I don’t even know who this is. But you best believe I’m about to go do my research, because if he’s the opponent, we gotta be ready. https://t.co/1UiiZhuot6
We’re rightfully talking a lot about the democratic field. 		But we have to stay smart, and watch the moves *everyone* is making. We gotta stay ready. Because we *have* to win.
If we do 2020 right, we can beat Trump-or any republican or billionaire- *and* pursue a new, exciting vision for America. 		We’re not electing a savior, but we have to do a lot more than just getting that guy out of office.		We have to win for the cause of justice.
Mitt Romney may also run. 		And the threat of foreign agents is not gone just because Mueller is at work. 		I’ve seen MANY bots posing as black progressives in just the last few weeks. 		Stay vigilant, y’all. ❤️✊🏾
Hey y’all-we gotta make sure we are fully prepared for 2020. 		Which means, in part, being aware of the whole field. 		Spoilers like Schultz. Potential Republicans like Larry Hogan (Gov of Maryland) &amp; Nikki Haley (former SC Gov &amp; UN Ambassador).		We may have to beat someone else!

If you understand the history of Motown and it’s significance in the legacy of black ownership, agency and self-determination, you’ll see that this is more than folks being haters and all of us being wrong. 		I still like J. Lo. But these conversations matter.
Suffice it to say, it’s not just on J. Lo for not saying no, although an advanced understanding of solidarity has her at least *questioning* this set up. But it never should have gotten that far. Not to her being the primary headliner. Not with Diana Ross *there.*
So you’re either ignorant to the level of the conversation, or worse, you don’t care, because you’re beyond/above the ‘haters.’		Except we’re not all haters. We’re consumers. Listeners. Fans. And our collective thoughts can’t *all* be rooted in a lie &amp; only you “know the truth.”
So J. Lo comes from backstage and says “you can’t tell someone what to not sing-music touches everyone.” Which is true-at step one. 		But the culture is on step 1001: we’re on appropriation, agency, music history &amp; theft of black artists-which some say includes J. Lo specifically
...because when you don’t, you risk entering a cultural conversation with which you are extremely unfamiliar. Half of cancel culture occurs when someone enters the dialogue at step one but the conversation is on step 1,001. 		It doesn’t work.
I know famous folks who are really smart users of this and other platforms. Learning and listening more than commenting. Reading more than writing. Letting a tweet or a resourceful thread lead them to literature they’d not otherwise see. 		If that can’t be you, hire someone...
I’m realizing that people who breathe such rarified air are disconnected not just from, say, how much a gallon of milk may be, but from the complex cultural conversations that happen in public these days, primarily on social media.
A Yebba or great white soul singer could have made a cameo, but truly, if one person were going to dominate the tribute, they should have been Black.
I’m rescinding an earlier comment because I thought I was just annoyed that, while I like J. Lo, there were better musicians for the moment and even a white soul singer could have been better. But it’s not (just) that. 		It’s that Motown is ours and we never get to keep anything.
Understanding the history of Motown means knowing it was a symbol of Black agency in a time when Black creativity was being stolen. 		This is why, in the most cursed #BHM in modern history, proline are upset about J. Lo doing the tribute.

@cxcope @kidnoble Listen. That man has my front, sides,  back, top, bottom, and he manages to do it all without casting a shadow or dimming my light. 		Best teammate I didn’t even know I deserved.
I dream better for us. So many of us hope for better for us. An even greater number of us work for better for us.		We don’t all have to think the same. But we damn sure better be on the same freedom team.		We got some work to do healing ourselves and our internalized trauma. ASAP
My friend Stevie said this #BHM is actually calling on us to take a long look at ourselves and if we really truly love Black people.		The way R. Kelly’s survivors, Terry Crews, 21 Savage, and Jussie have been dragged in our own community in just a month sadly makes me wonder.
ICE are still the police. Can’t critique Kamala (which *some* of y’all aren’t doing earnestly) and not critique them cause you think they aren’t coming for you. 		Pro tip: they are!		https://t.co/GdAkJ3onCx
You best believe the system of white supremacy WANTS us sniping at each other. They WANT us making jokes of #21Savage like he isn’t fully representative of how they want to send *all* our black selves “back to where we came from.”
So is the experience of Black American descendants of slaves different than that of Black Immigrants and members of the African Diaspora? Sure. 		Is there enough *power* for all of us to work for our common liberation, though? Absolutely.
But, as I always say, supremacy is a smog: we all breathe it in. 		White dominant culture doesn’t require white people to carry it out. 		So? Oppressed people internalize, and begin to mimic, their oppressors. 		We power hoard, too.
One of the elements of white dominant culture is power hoarding. If you have it, keep it, and stop at nothing to keep others from having it. 		Why? Because we treat power like a finite resource. Pro tip: it’s not.
I’m really up thinking about solidarity, intersectionality, and when some black people started being team ICE?! 		Look-I know what this is. It’s a scarcity mentality. It’s power hoarding. 		That doesn’t make it any less frustrating.
Ok. Back to work.

Yeah, we al laughed, but come on.

Being called trash &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; being treated like trash. 		I’m not saying generalizations are fair-I’m saying that patriarchy is pervasive and affects all cis men, who hold social power compared to women, femmes and gender non-binary people.		Own that. Then, take action. That’s all.
Try this: 		When property damage happened in Ferguson &amp; Baltimore, we reminded people: “a riot is the language of the unheard.” Ask what caused the rage in the first place-because broken windows &lt;&lt;&lt; broken spines.		Keep that same energy when you see “men are trash.”

We all spent time quoting Dr. King a few weeks ago; let’s do the harder work of applying his lens to social problems:		Hold individual people accountable, yes, AND, disrupt, dismantle and *replace* the systems and mindsets that fuel them.		The virus. Not just the symptoms.
Men aren’t any more comfortable admitting patriarchy exists than white people like admitting white privilege exists: 		It means “merit” is a myth, they didn’t earn everything they have on their own, and we’re demanding they dismantle something that benefits them.
Yep. Which is fueled by patriarchy. Toxic masculinity is the patriarchy’s beloved son.

Frankly, the fact that a 50% of my experiences w men have been positive makes me the exception-not the rule. 		The fact that 50% is all it takes to put me in a decent space? Well that just shows you how bad it is out here.
That said, I don’t have judgement for women who say “men are trash.” 		Folks want to judge the statement and have no empathy or curiosity as to the experiences she’s had w patriarchy that lead her to that conclusion. 		Spend that energy upending patriarchy instead of dragging her
Lol I don’t believe most people are trash or start out that way.		I believe the mindsets we’re taught lead to trash behaviors &amp; some of them are so socially acceptable,  permissible, and toxic, that I understand what’s underneath “all men are trash” &amp; don’t judge those who say it https://t.co/hCodyxI6YR
It also means that women will operate with patriarchal mindsets and internalized sexism and not realize what we’re doing. 		Awareness —&gt; self reflection —&gt; dismantling —-&gt; new mindsets —&gt; new habits.
I don’t believe that all men are trash. 		But I am 100% clear that all patriarchy is trash. 		All oppressive structures and mindsets, they are a smog-we all breathe patriarchy in. 		Which means that men will perform patriarchy even when they aren’t trying. And folks accept it.
So all these men just watched? https://t.co/hmZhLhQeZI

@HebrewRebekah This is all I’m saying.
I’m not defending anyone against anything, as I’ve been clear about. You’re want to have an argument I’m not making. 		I’m not urging anyone to choose a candidate. I’m BEGGING us to engage in fair, contextualized, FULL analysis. All candidates &amp; platforms aren’t even announced! https://t.co/e7xjIy4wtw
@OMB913 OK?!?
I’m *genuinely* not telling you to lean to a particular side. 		I don’t. 		Simply saying: analysis limited or heavily weighted toward one side and that doesn’t consider the *future* platforms that haven’t even been birthed or pushed yet is unfair. 		Democracy needs better of us.
@IRBroadshow @franklinleonard In comparing their congressional records as apples to apples. In comparing their local or statewide records (Bernie as mayor...Vermont still disportionately hails black people in a very white state), in comparing their FUTURE plans, etc.		The choice is yours-just analyze fairly.
@JalenElrod I just made the point about the difference between Congress &amp; a DA to someone else-i agree, and that actually further proves my point abt being fair in analysis. 		And if that’s the conclusion you still come to, that more than fine. I just want the analysis to be fair. Dassit.
@IRBroadshow @franklinleonard Which also means that you have to balance the comparison against people who were never prosecutors. 		I have yet to see you do that.
@dajafi To be honest, a LOT of smart people were pro-crime Bill/tough on crime in the 90s. A lot of people didn’t know the havoc it would cause until it actually caused the havoc. 		Some could predict it. Many didn’t. I’m glad you’ve evolved. This is what we want candidates to do.
@dajafi YEP. EVOLUTION, SELF-ANALYSIS. PLANS TO CORRECT, ETC.
@tmwinsett Novel concept, lol.
If your presidential candidate criminal justice analysis *only* includes the woman of color, you are wrong. 		Period.
@IRBroadshow @franklinleonard Include. All. The. Candidates. In. Your. CJ. Analysis. 		This isn’t hard.
Truth is, all of them came about in politics during an era when “tough on crime” was what strategists told democrats they needed to be to win. *Especially* women and/or PoC.		Not saying it’s right-I’m saying context matters. Review *all* candidates AND their plans for the future.

“I will push all democratic candidates alongside many other people &amp; communities, to help get the best nominee possible-and/or change the standard for the one we get.		I *also want Trump AND Pence out of office ASAP. So I’ll vote for the nominee.”		-Dem dinner tables everywhere
@exfkaty @fifimcfae @shannonrwatts @KamalaHarris @JoshShapiroPA And poll numbers are probably telling him he can either stick to his morals and watch a conservative govern, or compromise that one and govern as a democrat. 		It’s all a mess.
@exfkaty @fifimcfae @shannonrwatts @KamalaHarris But I agree-that’s the dialogue worth having. Being honest about the harm done and asking, pointedly, what will be done moving forward? 		Then, we asses each candidate.
@exfkaty @fifimcfae @shannonrwatts @KamalaHarris If folks are going to dismiss anyone with a ‘tough on crime’ history (in the *specific context I described above-not cruel or unrepentant candidates) out of hand without even asking those questions, truth is, almost everyone is out before we even begin.
@exfkaty @fifimcfae @shannonrwatts @KamalaHarris I agree. 		The questions I’m asking candidates who have a tough on crime history in a time when candidates (especially of color) were told that was the *only* way they can win are these: 		-how have they evolved? 	-how will they correct for the harm they’ve done?	-do they listen?
@septembergrrl @exfkaty @shannonrwatts That happens in mine all the time and I get so annoyed.
@exfkaty @septembergrrl @shannonrwatts Appreciate that &amp; always appreciate thoughtful engagement! 		How to deal? Honestly, the way we’ve been dealing: call it out and keep it pushing. Make room for nuance even if others won’t. Never deny truth.		That’s all I got 🤷🏾‍♀️
@exfkaty @shannonrwatts Gotcha. Point taken.
@septembergrrl @exfkaty @shannonrwatts In short, it’s all a LOT, and this is gonna be a looooonnnngggg primary. Whew.
@septembergrrl @exfkaty @shannonrwatts I also recognize that there is a challenge in hindsight being 20/20-a lot of elders in communities of color thought they wanted “tough on crime” candidates too. Another convo we don’t have. 		Also, I’ve been watching, and *some of the *extreme critique seems to be blackface bots.
@septembergrrl @exfkaty @shannonrwatts The sad part is there’s not a nuanced conversation about how she, as a black women running for AG in a state that elects Rs and Ds statewide, that the reigning theory was “tough/smart on crime” was the way to win. You can still not agree w her, but we should tell that truth.
@exfkaty @shannonrwatts I can get that. And I think that the “get in line or get out” isn’t applicable in a 2020 field of like, a million people, lol.
@exfkaty @shannonrwatts That may be all *you* are critiquing her on. But it’s not all the left has been critiquing her on. Perhaps reflect on how microaggressive it is to invalidate the mysoginoir black women candidates have and will face.
@exfkaty @shannonrwatts Respectfully, I think you and I have very different TLs. I have seen, in the last week, some of the grossest attacks on her blackness and womanhood that never brought into account her record. 		Critique her record. Leave the other mess out-and don’t say ppl who see both are lying

By the by, @NPR’s reporting on #LAUSDStrike is very strong and has helped me understand every layer of this much better. 		https://t.co/irkeBCdzx8
There’s a good chance I may mute the replies to this because...		Yeah.
I’m not here to argue, because I don’t think that’s productive for teaching or learning. 		I’m simply here to show solidarity with #LAUSDStrike and share the facts. 		Hoping strong resolutions are reached soon. ❤️✊🏾
Lots of students are marching with their teachers. 		The district is also still feeding the 81% of free and reduced lunch students who’d otherwise go hungry. 		Besides-isn’t putting kids first also supporting the people who care for them? Not mutually exclusive.		#LAUSDStrike
3. This isn’t “kids vs. teachers.” People throw around the phrase “choose kids first” as if these teachers don’t do that everyday. 		As if  using their bargaining power to get their students things like more nurses &amp; counselors isn’t choosing kids first. 		That’s disrespectful.
2. This was not hasty. 		LA teachers have been trying to negotiate for two years. They’ve been working *without* a contract for a year!		To discuss this without honoring the disciplined organizing, negotiation and deliberation that has gone on is wrong.
Facts matter.		1. This is not about greed. If teachers were greedy, they wouldn’t be teachers!		This is about better quality education.		I posted the demands in my #MorningReading series on IG stories (@MsPackyetti there too) on Monday. 		Read them. 3/4 aren’t even abt pay. https://t.co/ADWHT6Zek8
On #LAUSDStrike, I’ve sat, listened and read quietly and with intention. I personally support strikes. Yes, even teacher ones. 		And I’m watching the mischaracterization of these teachers and students reach disrespectful levels.
I come from a labor family; I generally support labor, with the exception of police unions when they block justice. 		(Years ago? #CampaignZero’s focus on police unions had some folks calling us neoliberal...until the data became as clear as we were saying it was...)
I’m going to say something that a lot of folks I love and respect in my field won’t agree with, but it wouldn’t be the first time...		I absolutely stand, on my own accord, with the teachers and students of the #LAUSDStrike.

@AdamantxYves Any. Politically? Culturally? Like I’m thinking about 2020 as much as Kim thinking about the Tevin Campbell debacle.
@yerownrisk_ @AdamantxYves Does that make it impossible for him to have common experience? Does that matter? I’m curious. Thx for sharing your thoughts!

Update: I deleted some parts of that thread because someone pointed out that the account looked like a bot and given 2016, I ain’t taking the chance.

Interesting. I think what I hear you as saying is “don’t act as an expert on things that don’t apply to you,” which I get/agree with.

@rahmdphd Perhaps but I think this is different for the following reasons: 		1) gender. Someone recently reminded me that it can absolutely have an impact in this convo. 		2-22) politics is very different than it was in 2008. 		23) there are as many layers to this as there are people.
PLEASE NOTE: I’m REALLY asking a question, HONESTLY looking for SINCERE dialogue and will not tolerate the BS. 		Ok. Discuss lol.

In this current moment, accountability is more than the perpetrators of harm against black girls and women are experiencing at all. Gaining it is a powerful step.		But that can’t limit our belief in what’s possible for black women in this world. Here’s our chance to work for more
Today is an opportunity redefine justice for black women and girls. Today is a chance to ensure that the just world we create for them is more than punishing harm or even preventing harm, but securing freedom, joy, choice and love.		Shifting our language helps us imagine more.
What justice is there in years of therapy, lost time and lost opportunities? What justice is ther in never having a normal life, the life you dreamed of, because a predator or the “justice” system stole your youth?		Yes: seek accountability. But don’t stop there.
Accountability is #RKelly finally losing income and being criminally liable.		Accountability is a Governor acknowledging a system that locks #CyntoiaBrown up for more than 50 years is an abomination.		Accountability matters greatly. And still, we must keep aiming for true justice
More ppl are finally learning of #RKellys pattern of abuse and pedophilia because of the survivors’ bravery. 		But justice is black girls never having to escape a wealthy predator at all.
Saying this is “justice” for #CyntoiaBrown celebrates a hard win, but is ultimately incorrect. 		Justice is never having to or be jailed for defending her life at all.		Us calling her clemency “justice” is subconsciously reflective of how little we expect Black women to get.
As we rightfully celebrate #CyntoiaBrown’s clemency &amp; reflect on the critically important #SurvivingRKelly, we are presented with an opportunity to shift our collective expectations of what freedom must look like for black women: 		Justice, not just accountability.

The fact that this man’s crimes can fill six hours with limited commercial breaks is telling and horrifying. 		#SurvigingRKelly

What @JamilahLemieux just said is the entire point: not only has R. Kelly been at this for a very long time, there was a system he set up to ensure he could continue. 		NDAs and payoffs, one after the other, tell a clear story. How much longer will we ignore it?		#SurvivingRKelly
“A pattern of behavior.”		This is what we must remember. #SurvivingRKelly
I’m trying not to be even more upset than I already am about the number of people-men, in R. Kelly’s employ-who intentionally turned away, didn’t follow their instincts, didn’t protect these young women, and didn’t speak up. 		#SurvivingRKelly
#SurvivingRKelly continues tonight...remember to take care of yourselves and one another if/as we watch		https://t.co/1K6TOoQ2Hq

Abuse comes in many forms. It took a therapist showing me the cycle of abuse to realize that I was in a verbally and mental abusive cycle with someone. 		Know it for yourself. 		#SurvivingRKelly https://t.co/8pLOMbiKjr
Grateful to the #SurvivingRKelly filmmakers for featuring a number of therapists and mental health professionals to give language and understanding to the issues, habits and tactics here. 		That is responsible filmmaking.
The exploitive nature of unequal power dynamics seem to be especially lost on R. Kelly’s defenders. “Why would she go back? She clearly wants to be there.” 		Naïveté and power are leveraged to exploit and manipulate people in exactly these kind of circumstances.		#SurvivingRKelly
Reminder: when we ask that you don’t play or work w R. Kelly, we’re not overly sensitive. 		It triggers people. It builds a culture of permissiveness &amp; excuse making. 		And most of all, because it *funds* his ability to be a predator.		#SurvivingRKelly		cc: @marvinsapp @ladygaga
May this be the generation of black families breaking our most harmful cycles, and black communities disrupting our most painful patterns.		#SurvivingRKelly
There’s always a network of enablers when a predator’s actions are this vast. 		I can’t listen to this man chuckle who watched this whole thing go on. 		#SurvivingRKelly
Friends of mine went to Kenwood and nearby schools. They told me about his habits; this is a pattern. 		It was never about one video.		#SurvivingRKelly
What is scary for so many of us is just how layered this all is-and just how many folks are indicted when we hold people in *our* community accountable for sexual abuse. 		That’s why we have such a hard time with this. It’s a proxy for our collective pain. #SurvivingRKelly
If you’re watching #SurvivingRKelly or know folks who are, please share this guide. This is difficult for many.		https://t.co/gKdLZ0yL1D
FYI: I’m not really “on” any social media right now; I’m sending this from buffer, so I can support and amplify the stories of survivors, but spare myself from what I’ve already witnessed today from afar.		#SurvivingRKelly is about survivors: let’s keep it that way. 🙏🏾
Family,		I’ll be live tweeting along with others as we watch #SurvivingRKelly, starting tonight on @LifetimeTV, 9pm ET.		It will be difficult to watch. But survivors shouldn’t live in silence any longer. If you can, join in.
A number of us have been trying to #MuteRKelly for years now. Don’t turn away: Black Women never get to. 		For everyone who doubts if his terror is real, tune in to the three-night event, #SurvivingRKelly starting tomorrow at 9/8c on @lifetimetv. https://t.co/7sY8QdmfYI
I didn’t know you, Jazmine. But I know you should be alive. I know we wish you were still here. 		I want to say that you being taken from us will finally be enough. Enough for it to stop. Enough for the culture to cease. Enough for the rhetoric to end.
Jazmine, watch over us as we press forward for every Jazmine. Let us never forget your name. May your eyes pierce the heart of everyone who refuses to see your divinity. May your family feel the goodness of strangers outweigh the hate of one.
I am sorry we let you and your family down, Jazmine. That your warm smile isn’t enough to confirm your humanity for some, and too warm for others to comprehend. 		I wish we could solve this today. Tomorrow. Yesterday. Last week. Then you’d still be here.
