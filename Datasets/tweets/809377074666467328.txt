Thinking this underscores the argument that all of the media needs professional PR help. Thanks for sharing! https://t.co/k4a01vhkg0
Journalists need professional help defending democratic free speech.  They have tried themselves, with mixed results. It’s time to get skilled PR pros from the outside engaged. That’s the topic on this week’s episode of the @FlackPackDC @TonyDAngelo_SU https://t.co/v24SuPI7Oz

@oOoMellieoOo @juliehdavis Cool. Which big blue city do you live in?
@juliehdavis Liberals don’t understand that Trump’s base couldn’t care less about a government shutdown. In fact, they believe they are safest when bureaucrats are not at work.  The media cares and so do Dems but taxpaying Americans do not. Sorry but that’s the truth.
We're podcasting from a new studio near the @WhiteHouse but it's not fully constructed, so that's where the McGyver skills come in handy. A warm winter coat and two studio stools provide excellent soundproofing for now! @WMG_DC @FlackPackDC @ASTHO https://t.co/yAGlgvaZiI

This brand journalism piece was written from last week's @flackpackdc interview with @MarkRaganCEO and @jpyjr about said topic. It's a good recap of the power of telling your stories, your way, without the filter of the fractured news media to impede your message. @word_czar https://t.co/inza1T9cG4
