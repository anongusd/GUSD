What a remarkable job of Coach Monken to turn the Army program around and now has two consecutive 10 win seasons. #ArmyNavy
Final Score: Army 17 Navy 10. Three straight wins by Army as they retain the Commander-in-Chief trophy. #ArmyNavy
Donât turn off the game yet. Onside kick time after a 45 yard FG by PK Moehring. #ArmyNavy
Army up 17-7 late, major Vegas implications on this drive. #ArmyNavy
Touchdown Army! That should do it. Navyâs defense has been so good all day but just couldnât hold off Army at the end.
Kelvin Hopkins moves it to the Navy 2 yard line. #ArmyNavy
Navy has turned it over 3 times and is still only one score away. #ArmyNavy
Army ball with 3:02 left but Navy still has 2 timeouts. This game is not over. #ArmyNavy
Strip Sack Army!!
Army has gone surprisingly conservative in the second half. Navy with another big time stop as Taylor Heflin takes down Armyâs Kelvin Hopkins for a 5 yard loss. #ArmyNavy
10-7 Army. 7:10 left in the game. Just when you thought Army was going to open it up, Navyâs defense comes through and the quarterback change has sparked the offense. #ArmyNavy
Touchdown! Game On! Navy gets in the end zone for the first time today. Garrett Lewis with the sneak up the middle. #ArmyNavy
There's Malcolm Perry! He rips off a 43-yard run for Navy to the Army 5 yard line. #ArmyNavy
Navy gets a game saving stop on a clutch tackle by the Safety Sean Williams. It looked like Army was going to easily move the chains. #ArmyNavy
Fumble recovered by Army on a big time hit at the goal line. What a play by the Army Defense. #ArmyNavy
Navy converts a 4th and inches and has the ball on the Army 16. All the sudden, things are tightening up. 11:14 to go.... #ArmyNavy
A timely 34 yard gain by Makekau on the screen pass. Terrific downfield blocking by the RT Andrew Wood.  #ArmyNavy
Navyâs back up QB Garrett Lewis delivers a strike down field but it is dropped. Big 3rd and possible 4th down coming up. #ArmyNavy
What a big time 4th down stop by Navy! The Defense has kept them in the game all afternoon. Navy must get points here as they change quarterbacks. #ArmyNavy
In last year's game Army-Navy game, Navy's Malcolm Perry had 30 carries for 250 yards and a touchdown. This year? Perry has carried 3 times for just 4 yards. #ArmyNavy
Army leads 10-0 as we head to the 4th quarter. 4th and 2 from the Navy 43 yard line. Navy needs a big play here to stay in the game. #ArmyNavy
Navy had registered its first third down conversion of the game on that drive, but squanders it with the pick. Army will start this drive on Navy's side of the field. #ArmyNavy
What an interception by Mike Reynolds! Over the head catch on the sidelines and gets his feet down. Move him to WR?! #ArmyNavy
Army is leading the yardage battle 244-47. Expect Coach Ken to open up the play book to try to shake things up. #ArmyNavy
Army 33 yard FG is Good by the senior kicker, John Abercrombie. Army leads 10-0 late in the 3rd quarter. Navyâs struggling offense needs a big play to change the momentum. #ArmyNavy
Army comes out with a big defensive stop and now finds itself deep in Navy territory. Kelvin Hopkins is making big plays with his feet this drive. #ArmyNavy

Halftime here in Philadelphia. Army has controlled the game but only leads 7-0 thanks to inspired play by the Navy defense. The Mids get the ball to start the 2nd half. #ArmyNavy
Critical juncture in the game for both teams. Army driving late in the half with a chance to go up two scores. #ArmyNavy
Navy is losing the turnover, yardage and time of possession battles but finds itself down one score with the ball. #ArmyNavy
Army's Jordan Asberry drops a pass near the sideline on 3rd down, then kicker John Abercrombie misses a field goal wide right. Still 7-0 Army. #ArmyNavy
Army QB Kelvin Hopkins misses wide open receiver just outside the end zone, then runs 13 yards to the Navy 17 for a first down. #ArmyNavy
Army goes for it on fourth down for the first time today and gets it, as the first quarter comes to a close. Army leads 7-0 as the teams switch sides. #ArmyNavy
Army FS Jaylon McClinton intercepts Navy QB Zach Abey on a deep pass thrown into triple coverage #ArmyNavy
Army running into the punter gives Navy the ball back and another chance on offense #ArmyNavy

Taking inspiration from the host team, Eagles, Navy goes to the reverse pass to move the ball to midfield via pass interference. #ArmyNavy
After a big time 3rd and long conversion in the air, Army takes the next play to the Navy 10. Army immediately takes it on the next play for touchdown. A 10 yard run by QB Hopkins. What a start by the Cadets. 7-0. #ArmyNavy
POTUS is at mid-field for the coin the toss. Navy wins the toss and defers to the second half. #ArmyNavy

Army is a heavy favorite at -7, the largest spread in recent memory. O/U is at 40. #ArmyNavy
We do not expect weather to be a factor today as it has been it recent games. #ArmyNavy
