But if crimes have been committed, then they need to be prosecuted. If people in positions of power betrayed their country, or undermined our election, we can't just ignore those acts. To suggest we should do otherwise is to aid and abet any crimes that occurred.
We have a justice department because crime occurs every single day and sometimes it is being committed by people in positions of power. Investigations are meant to uncover the truth. If no crime has been committed, well, then, huzzah, let's go grab a pizza.
I gather, from listening to the @maddow podcast on my way to work, that one of the most controversial lines talked about how wonderful everything would be if only there were no investigations. That goes under the category of "If wishes were horses, then beggars would ride."
Thread: I didn't watch the #SOTU last night. It was on in the living room, but (a) I didn't want to listen to the untruthful, corrupt, mean man pretend not to be any of those things and (b) I can never keep from ranting, which annoys my better half.
