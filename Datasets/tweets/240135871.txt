RT @AdamAton: Pruitt kept plotting a climate debate until his final days in office. @emilyhholden got the documents: https://t.co/571sAckC5v
A former senior administration official said the idea was a compromise between the White House, where top officials at the time didn’t want a public debate over climate science, and EPA. Emails were circulated mid-May, and Pruitt resigned July 5.
Pruitt was looking at taking comments on the endangerment finding, the science-based legal finding that shows GHGs from power plants and cars harm the public and must be regulated by EPA. This was after the White House shut down his plans for a public ‘red team, blue team’ debate
@EuphoniusNuts Yes, don’t have a link handy but they were released on FOIA online under my name and are public.

@ElizHarball I agree it’s tough. The method can be apolitical and separate from the communicating of the findings. It shouldn’t be political to say your work is important and should be taken seriously. But I guess sometimes it is.
Every science meeting I go to, someone asks about how scientists can be apolitical but communicate the seriousness of the #climate change crisis, when otherwise policymakers will just hear from industry and advocates

Some more thoughts reading this piece. I'm losing count of the times someone in government has been caught using documents written by or edited by an industry lobbyist. And I wish companies would comment on the things their trade groups do on their behalf. https://t.co/TELCJnYdJu
"On a conference call with investors last week, Mr. Heminger, the Marathon chief executive, was already counting the extra barrels of fuel a Trump rollback would mean for the industry: 350,000 to 400,000 barrels of gasoline per day, he said."
Notable: "The Trump plan, if finalized, would increase greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by more than the amount many midsize countries put out in a year and reverse a major effort by the Obama administration to fight climate change." https://t.co/pZ0joubtHI

@ndrichardson @JosephMajkut The third guy was in politics and wouldn’t tell us what he did for a living because he said you never know what company you’re in. Wise. Considering...you know...I was there.
@JosephMajkut Oh the best was a shared Lyft this week when an actual climate scientist who is studying historic ocean temperatures got in and was asked if we are in the Paleolithic era. And he nicely explained the Anthropocene.
@ProfSecchi And the fun thing is I ALWAYS tell them I’m a climate change reporter and have been covering energy and the environment for 5ish years
So far people have told me it’s:  	-because of a volcano in the ocean 	-because of polar magnetism	-going to be fixed in 30 yrs when the government can control the weather	-going to be solved by geothermal, terraforming, solar panels OR forcing 1/3 of Congress to become mediators

Critics: EPA science policy is out of tobacco playbook. My report from the day for Pros (sorry, couldn’t stay til 8, but if you have interesting angles I should consider send them my way) https://t.co/jWw5YPAkVo
One of a handful of supporting comments today: Chamber’s @DByers21 arguing the vast majority of $ regulatory benefits EPA has claimed are based on non-public data about PM 2.5. Still, Chamber suggests looking at considering non-public data but giving more weight to public data.
So far I’ve only tweeted about opponents of this proposal. That’s because there’s only been one unaffiliated supporter up while I’ve been in the room, but I see the Chamber and Steve Milloy will speak during this segment.
Going to guess that Pamela Miller gets the title of traveled-from-farthest away. She studies endocrine disruptors in Arctic communities and says she halted field research to travel from the Bering Sea. She says those studies are only possible with a guarantee of privacy.
Just looked around and realized it’s almost all women speaking today on this EPA science policy. That’s rare in D.C.
These comments are angrier than what you usually get on EPA regs. A nurse said she swapped shifts to come talk about EPA’s science proposal, which she said displays a “complete lack of shame.” Challenged admin to force pharma to disclose its data if this is about transparency.
Thoughts from the public hearing on EPA’s proposal to ban science without public data: How does one get chosen as the EPA “hearing officer,” who has the joy of listening to people read statements all day and can’t respond or make any facial expression?

Folks are sending me questions they want answered from Wheeler. He is not taking questions today.
Wheeler seems far more aware of what people have read about @EPA in the news. Keeps making clear what his deregulatory platform DOESN’T mean.
.@EPAAWheeler is much clearer on one point on enforcement—says he is not advocating letting people off the hook or reducing fines. When Pruitt spoke about that he had a different tone entirely. Some context: https://t.co/MDTl41ETn1
Wheeler: EPA is tracking how long permit decisions take, aiming for 6 months for a yes or no.
We got into some of these last year. A lot holds true. W/@alexcguillen https://t.co/wkIIhsa1oM https://t.co/curTPE2ZTM
Wheeler hits the same policy points Pruitt often did. Will continue Pruitt’s list of Superfunds for targeted action. Touts water infrastructure, air quality, chemical reviews. Pushing regulatory certainty for states, industry (permitting and enforcement) and risk communication.

@freelancerjourn @CorbinHiar @MariahCBlake no reporters today, reportedly only government today, but still a big group

It's not just this meeting. Here are some other EPA transparency issues we have documented-- backlogs and political reviews for public records requests: https://t.co/81yUPKhmh1 https://t.co/BOgDpTnnOz Refusal to release Pruitt schedule in advance: https://t.co/edzz0oSSyl
One thing I would ask attendees at EPA today: how will they get the science they say they need in order to protect people since EPA has decided it will not consider research without public data (and heath info is private) More here w/ @AnnElizabeth18: https://t.co/BR2owU94tW https://t.co/uAli2pnd82
A main question explored yday (and today, according to agenda) is communicating risk to public. Many officials said candidly that it's hard to know what to tell people about potential water contamination when they don't have all the science yet. Step 1 in communicating: Let us in https://t.co/CVryHJrsEH
@ACamille38 The set is called PFAS. It’s a big category. @AnnElizabeth18 has some explanation in a story about agencies delaying a study on some of the chemicals https://t.co/GqCqd3iirI &amp; here is local context: https://t.co/PqqlfnnAjQ
I'm told CNN's producer was also turned away from EPA's toxic chemicals summit. That makes at least four of us.
Based on what I heard yesterday at EPA, the federal and state governments are at the very beginning of figuring out what to do about these chemicals. They need more science, money, technologies and standards. So I’m not sure what they’re worried about the public hearing.

I’m standing at EPA’s chemicals summit, where I’m told by security that I can’t enter and can’t stand inside because it is invite only and no press. They were polite but refused to call public affairs staff, even if I gave them the number (which they said they didn’t have).

@MikeBastasch What EPA lawyers told me was off the record. I asked for it to be on the record. You can ask @jahanwilcox, who was there. Here is the statement he just gave me on the record...
@MikeBastasch But if you don’t want to attend, you don’t have to.
@MikeBastasch Yes I did. And other lawyers. And reading and interpreting laws, with advice from experts, is part of our job as reporters. As is pushing for media access to the government, especially where the laws protect it.
@MikeBastasch The law reads: The term "advisory committee" means any committee,	board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other	similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup.
@MikeBastasch See Part C: established or utilized by agency
EPA has said attendees are giving their individual perspective, not offering advice, and that’s why they think this law doesn’t apply. I was there yesterday. EPA was clearly collecting recommendations for future action, even if there wasn’t consensus. I disagree. https://t.co/UHD1ltuVNp

@archiebs @RogueEPAstaff It’s important to ask questions about press access. Here’s some of my context. https://t.co/42DUGAMcCl
@RealBradRhoads Agree to disagree. As someone on the beat every day, this is how I will continue to handle this, to ask EPA for access for myself and fellow journalists. And stand outside when they say no.
EPA has directed me to statements from yesterday about the event being at capacity, even though the industry/NGO attendees are not present today so there should be plenty of open seats. https://t.co/jEScg5PNyT
@RealBradRhoads There were at least 7 reporters there in the morning yesterday. I WAS banned (with everyone else) from the middle section of the day. The only reason I got to go back was because I showed up and made my case. I want everyone to have access, as I explained.
5) We often don’t know until after an event who was invited/allowed in and who was not. Sometimes, if you aren’t on the list and show up and there is space, you can enter. That didn’t happen yesterday, even though there was space.
We got an update on the status of a study that reporting from @annelizabeth18 shows the government has delayed releasing as a White House staffer said it would be a “public relations nightmare” (because it will show toxic chemicals are harmful at far lower levels than thought).
4) Covering an event isn’t just about getting quotes from a (sometimes webcast) speech. I was able to talk to multiple key sources yesterday, including government officials who typically are difficult to access.
Our stories are all valuable and needed. We write for different audiences to give a variety of perspectives on what occurrences are important to those audiences. That’s the beauty of the American media landscape.
3) EPA reporters cover a wide variety of topics. My colleague at E&amp;E News @CorbinHiar might delve into far more detail than my other colleagues at the Post, WSJ. A regional reporter might ask about a local problem or seek out local officials in attendance.
2) Staying yesterday meant I had access to multiple EPA staff to discuss their reasoning for the press ban and ultimately get back in with other reporters for the afternoon session (we are not allowed in today, however)
People have asked why reporters allowed at the EPA event wouldn’t boycott until those not allowed could enter. My thoughts: 1) My not covering what EPA is doing won’t help other reporters or readers. Staying means I can cover what happens, who’s there, whether there is space, etc

Today’s session of EPA’s chemicals summit is federal and state/local regulators only. We have asked for it to be open to the press. We have also asked for a statement about why EPA does not think this violates the Federal Advisory Committee Act. https://t.co/3o0ggoJ3Pf
@altUSEPA For clarification, I was the reporter at the scene and counted more than a dozen seats open just near my corner and saw others around the room. Three press seats were vacant.
@archiebs @RogueEPAstaff So we can be there to tell the public what the government is doing! And tell people what happened to other reporters attempting to attend.

@CCplusfour I often include links but no specific ‘here’s where you comment’ bc a) most aren’t looking for that b) docket #s make their eyes glaze over c) we don’t do calls to action as journalists. But if you google “Clean Power Plan comment” it’s the second link. Happy to link more though.

@MarkFHand Not saying everything is peachy. Saying let’s take an honest and constructive look at what’s happening, why and how to do better. What are the economic, practical and editorial barriers here.
@MarkFHand E&amp;E has at least 75 expert editorial staffers focused entirely on the environment, energy and climate. And has that because the paywall supports it. Not sure that’s a fair comparison. I agree TV could do better. I’m not sure just doing more, longer segments is the way.
I’m so confused by local newspapers. Reading my hometown metro section and a fluff feature on the library is above a fire safety story (after a string of people have died here recently) and a budget standoff at the Capitol.
I would also say to #climate communicators and others in this field—if you think we’re doing it wrong, reach out to us. I’m always happy to hear constructive criticism of my individual stories and work as a whole.
And I don’t think we were included, but: https://t.co/KDJbYgtxsm
Also, I’m not saying the media couldn’t do better, but beliefs in this area aren’t only about having accurate information presented to you. They are often wrapped up in other deeply held personal views. And it is not our job to persuade but to inform. https://t.co/BQ8U7d8LdX
Americans not understanding/caring about climate change is more nuanced than this analysis suggests. Attribution science is still evolving and not immediate enough for the news cycle, TV as a platform has limitations, +“solutions” focus doesn’t belong/fit in many stories. https://t.co/Mq2mDyti0v

Right. A state-determined coal plant standard instead of the #CleanPowerPlan is not about climate action. It’s about legal defense. https://t.co/OrRtxF0Pbo
Also, this. #CleanPowerPlan https://t.co/Fe2JBuSdO7
@alfie322 @FrankPallone @CCplusfour Ohhhh. Thank you!
Pruitt told lawmakers: we are going to be introducing a replacement to #CleanPowerPlan under Section 111. That's news! Last I heard, they were 'considering all options.' EPA must have listened to NRECA, Chamber and ERCC utilities who want a coal plant only rule
Asked for an example of a scientist getting an EPA grant and giving guidance in conflict because of that grant, Pruitt says it's about the appearance, doesn't offer any examples.

Big news here. Pruitt will launch program to 'critique' #climatechange science. https://t.co/5k9q6pSGf6
.@HMNorthey and I had the scoop on the #nuclear announcement ICYMI https://t.co/NWbzTirlWG
More from Trump: DOE to approve more natural gas exports from LA, admin to start new offshore oil and gas leasing program
Trump announces "complete review of U.S. #nuclear energy policy," coal export to Ukraine, pipeline to Mexico, natural gas to South Korea
Trump says maybe we'll be back in Paris some day on better terms. "We'll see what happens."
Not everyone clapping when Trump mentions withdrawing from "one-sided" Paris #climate deal
@ctraywick it was even weirder with just the three of them before Trump and Pence came out. Good for TV I guess
Trump: We are really in the driving seat...we don't want to let other countries take over our sovereignty and tell us what to do and how
Now we're talking about fake news...I await the energy announcements...
We have gone off the energy message and into immigration.
All the men who run #energy policy in the U.S. https://t.co/nSCSFuMt45
Trump tells #energy companies they've gone through "8 years of hell" and maybe more.
We somehow have a ton of space on this press riser. I had gotten used to being a sardine when Trump speaks.
"There's our boys, right there," Perry says as Zinke, Pruitt join him on stage at DOE to introduce Trump. https://t.co/hFQUYaivjs
White House press pool filtering in. So Trump must be up soon.
Outburst of laughter at the music here...
This smooth jazz is not Trump's style...surely they'll change it for his intro.
.@LIUNA moved up closer to front row before Trump arrives. Getting those hard hats on camera.
Cohn says post visit that India's Modi wants U.S. LNG, so do South Korea, Poland, lots others, he says.
Perry head nod to getting Ukraine coal so it doesn't need Russian anthracite. @jendlouhyhc called that.
Good Cohn anecdote on how Trump makes decisions--invites industry in, asks what they need to grow jobs, assigns someone to help limit regs
Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn says the U.S.'s biggest competitive advantage is low energy prices
Cohn says we've been a victim of international energy prices, says gasoline costs are most regressive tax
Gary Cohn jokes that of the whole group he has the worst office, best location.
Pruitt says his focus is achieving air quality standards. Worth noting Trump's budget proposal is in direct conflict with that.
Pruitt says he's against "regulatory pancaking," AKA stacking regs. Haven't actually heard that one before.
Lol @ the reaction from our Kemper reporter. Kind of awkward timing... https://t.co/428aJCYqmw
Zinke says in 5 yrs, 40 percent of Interior is retirement age, now is time for reorg. @amusedbrit have you heard that figure?
Zinke says we can't run the nation on "pixie dust and hope"
I have a feeling the president's speech is going to be quite a bit different in tone from these panels...
Zinke: producing energy here w/ reasonable U.S. enviro regs is best, energy dominance key bc he doesn't want to see anyone's children in war
And Gary Cohn has arrived from the White House to join the cabinet panel here
Perry joke on Senate energy bill: 'I always thought if they'd let me write it, it'd be perfect' Try to imagine Moniz or Chu w/ that one haha
RT @samjmintz: Key phrases include: "all of the above strategy" "small modular reactors" "the coolest job in the world" https://t.co/L8qSO9…
Perry is again touting carbon capture for #coal plants
This is Perry's #energy stump speech. I've heard it four times now this week. He's well practiced with it.
Panel 2: Perry, Pruitt and Zinke are up.
Joe Craft of Alliance says goal is to protect current #coal fleet and get standards that allow building new plants
Chamber's Karen Harbert says 'certain resources are challenging the viability of nuclear' but also touts diversity with renewables.
Apparently the Chamber changed its energy wing name to the "Global Energy Institute" last week. Fitting timing.
Getting Senate to approve FERC nominees was an applause line here. Mentioned multiple times already.
I didn't see her come in, but I'm told the head of @SEIA is here at DOE  too. So at least some renewables folks were invited.

Perry notes TX #wind growth, says markets should drive fuel mix. But DOE grid study is looking at what markets can't do for #coal, #nuclear
@erikabolstad no he said specifically that's not what he means
So far Perry has talked about what he sees as clean #coal but hasn't mentioned #renewables much as part of his "all of the above" strategy
Perry: #coal isn't going anywhere. Are we able to do it in a way that's economically feasible, environmentally sensitive? I think yes
Perry very specific-he wants to debate how much humans impact #climatechange, notes protestors. "I just want to have a conversation ab this"
Perry says again that #energy will be glue to hold US/India partnership together, including LNG, "clean coal," nuclear
Energy Secretary Perry says #climatechange science isn't settled. "Why not have a conversation?"
Perry says DOE wants to "make #nuclear energy cool again."
Perry is saying pretty much what he told reporters yesterday. Energy dominance and clean environment aren't binary choice, he argues.

Guys, follow @nhheikkinen for your #EPA #Pruitt news. Also, send her scoops.

I read it. https://t.co/RX6q25mRWY
@bstorrow @AriPeskoe @WillieYeatman haha I'll let Ben take over from here.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow That's my concluding thought guys, gotta go listen to the president! But enjoyed the dialogue.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow We SHOULD talk about how the grid handles coal's decline. We SHOULDN'T let emotional, political rhetoric about blackouts hijack that.
@AriPeskoe @WillieYeatman @bstorrow Article from 2014 isn't about outages, but costs. These are different conversations! It's not fair or honest to make ppl fear blackouts.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow We should 100 percent be looking at transmission weaknesses, especially in terms of terror or cyber attacks.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow The fears are about power lines though. Not coal.
Really have to listen to feel the weirdness of this third-person statement. https://t.co/xdmiRt1ybk
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow If we were facing blackouts, grid operators and utilities would be the first to tell us. But they aren't. Because we aren't.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow Am I saying we shouldn't have the converrsations? No. I'm saying we shouldn't play on fears of blackouts to have those discussions.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow We have so, so, so many protections against this in government and industry processes. We have huge reserve margins.
@WillieYeatman @AriPeskoe @bstorrow I'm just saying conflating disruptions, complications and price increases (which could be avoidable) with blackouts is dangerous.
@AriPeskoe @WillieYeatman @bstorrow Those are also problems than can and are being addressed, without outages, although sometimes with price spikes.
@AriPeskoe @WillieYeatman @bstorrow I just see pipeline problems &amp; natural gas reliance as a different conversation than "do we need to keep this much coal to avoid blackouts"
This is the money quote when it comes to regional #grid reliability with less #coal. H/t @bstorrow for contribution https://t.co/kPNtmdC2TF https://t.co/FmUs3OcpeW

You can't just go around putting solar panels wherever you want. You have to have demand and power lines.

@DByers21 When you say "without CPP," one of my thoughts is that I think EIA's analysis was w/mass-based CPP, not rate-based. Could make a difference?
@DByers21 depends on how states would've chosen to comply with the rule too. Plus many of states with big emissions aren't in PJM or MISO
Andrew Wheeler, potential EPA deputy: "there are a lot of challenges and opportunities" in next few years under Trump, w/energy world change
Further evidence. https://t.co/60cbSIkZ1F
Precisely. https://t.co/toT2qWSFKT
PJM, MISO remind they would've met Clean Power Plan goals even without the rule, with low natural gas prices, state policies on EE, DR, RE

.@EPAScottPruitt says potentially responsible parties can pay for most Superfunds. Trump budget would cut that kind of enforcement $ though.
Oh wow! @FaegreBD asked my Superfund question. How do you prioritize it with less money.
@jwalkenrdc @EPAScottPruitt Would be happy to look at any numbers you have that speak to this.
.@EPAScottPruitt: Paris is a bumper sticker...it’s what the past administration represents...mostly talk, little action
Pruitt clearly had his coffee this morning. Also props to @FaegreBD for asking some pointed questions.
.@EPAScottPruitt: Paris represents the rest of world applauding as we penalize ourselves and hurt our economy
Pruitt calls Paris #climate agreement a "bad business deal," says U.S. wouldn't have met it even with Clean Power Plan
@NeilShader Yes, it'll be a good one!
This is the most I've heard Pruitt say on pretty much anything since his confirmation hearing.
.@EPAScottPruitt on going 100 percent #renewables: "It's just not wise...we need to have fuel diversity."
.@EPAScottPruitt adds that he supports the DOE grid study on "baseload" vs. renewables, then says we shouldn't pick winners and losers.
.@EPAScottPruitt: "We need to start thinking about whether the grid is truly stable." Coal (but not gas) can be kept on site, he argues.
@rebleber girl you gotta come up here lol. And no.
@AriPeskoe @WillieYeatman Yes! That's what I meant.
Sounds like EPA still undecided on whether to just rescind or rescind and replace #CleanPowerPlan https://t.co/C0OsjBvsuz
Pruitt: unlike WOTUS, which needs replacement, Clean Power Plan is "fair question to be asked," "undetermined," EPA struck out twice on #CO2
Pruitt doesn't make news on a deputy but notes regional office heads don't need Senate approval, EPA can get them in place
This event took questions for Pruitt by email. One of mine was advice for states looking at smaller budgets, more responsibility
@WillieYeatman @EPAScottPruitt That's what all utilities tell me.
!! First time I've really heard Scott Pruitt talk #carbon. He notes levels lower than 1994, not b/c of government but innovation, technology
Pruitt says 'leadership, attitude, management, focus, key to restoring common sense Superfund portfolio,' which would see 1/3 cut in budget
oh and there goes "z" and regional haze
Having a broken X key is not great for an environmental regulation reporter...
Touting "rule of law," @EPAScottPruitt disses WOTUS, Clean Power Plan, calls for more certainty. But rescinding causes more uncertainty.
.@EPAScottPruitt calls regulatory uncertainty the greatest impediment to economic growth in recent years
Pruitt says both his kids are graduating, daughter on her way to UVA Law, son to Oklahoma University.
.@EPAScottPruitt chats with folks while his advance team prepares in the background https://t.co/rI2bbPpd6b
@FaegreBD As would industry
.@FaegreBD partner: w/Trump cuts, EPA wouldn't be able to match 2016's 2,300 enforcement actions, would face lawsuits by well-funded enviros
