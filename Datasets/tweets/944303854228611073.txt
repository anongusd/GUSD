I believe in the ideals of individual and economic freedom, greater individual participation in government, and constitutional, political, and administrative reforms designed to secure these objectives.  Thats why I support @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump I HATE THAT YOU IGNORE LIBERALS LIKE ME!!!  I AM A LIBERAL AND I AM GROWING TO TRUST YOU AND NO WAY IS THE 2nd AMENDMENT EVER TO BE LIMITED.  You don't need more Republicans exploiting you!  You need more liberals to stop drinking the punch and start thinking for themselves!
As a fearless Liberal the days of excuses are over.  The time to take personal responsibility have long been upon me and every other liberal.  Time to stop living with one foot in the USA and the other in your country of origin... Choose your loyalty. https://t.co/ic1KA9oiRy

@carlquintanilla @thebradfordfile @CNBC @SquawkStreet I'm gonna have to agree with you 100% He is making liberals and conservatives alike look like they were stuck in the stone ages. He is truly is a man on to himself
@blotter420 @ArBrnQuinn @JackPosobiec I wish there was a way to laugh at some of these comments they're hysterical!   I guess maybe you could say I never recovered from liberalism and I'm just now starting to?
@jcreechy @JackPosobiec Both sides have to stop thinking with their in securities.... Trying to feel superior to others who may not understand what you understand. Capping is so high school.
@jcreechy @JackPosobiec Try to remember that there was a time that you did not know how to do math but as you were exposed to it and you learned you now do math I hope? It had nothing to do with you being stupid that you couldn't do math to begin with.
@TaraPollard99 @ArBrnQuinn @JackPosobiec That was my point sorrow as I was misled for many many years By the long history and liberals in my family. A when I got sober and discovered personal responsibility it didn't sit well anymore. And I'm starting to understand More and more how stagnant we were under Obama.
#WSJ China Negotiating.   I think I'm starting to understand. Liberal fear mongering is being Trumped by bold conservative leadership. Wow. Add recovering liberal to my list!  Bernie is not  a Progressive.  Trump is!
@ThinkB4USayDat @ArBrnQuinn @JackPosobiec He is a human being he is going to make mistakes. M because of the position he holds those mistakes have consequences that are much more serious.
@magi_estella @JackPosobiec Perhaps not. Lol.
@TrumpPres2017 @Patriot0781 @WEK1960 @JackPosobiec Oh absolutely agree that's exactly what I finally woke up to being a Democrat my whole life.  What a mistake...
@ArBrnQuinn @JackPosobiec I love what  Trump is doing for this country and I don't wanna have it ruined by blindly following him if he were to make mistakes.
@TrumpPres2017 @Patriot0781 @JackPosobiec Mine are too ever since I swallowed the liberal punch from childhood until trump's election.
@TrumpPres2017 @Patriot0781 @JackPosobiec I'm perfectly willing to accept that criticism.
@TrumpPres2017 @Patriot0781 @JackPosobiec That's exactly the basis of my concern.  I think trump asked tremendous ability to do some good in this world but ... Let's not be blind either...

@realDonaldTrump Me thinks dost protester too much.  It's so sad because you are squandering the opportunity to be a truly great President by focusing on your ego, living in fear and resentment.  Be still and know He is God and listen to the Holy Spirit and take direction... take correct action.
