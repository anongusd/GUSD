@realDonaldTrump #WalkAway
@DemTeaParty2020 @EdKrassen Fair. And good catch. That obviously slipped past me. Good catch.
@JordanChariton @BetoORourke @StatusCoup I can’t get past the fact he voted for Hilliary in the primary.
@wastedtime01 @JordanChariton @BernieSanders @TheView @HillaryClinton Because I’m not an HRC fan? That’s all you got? I’m fake because Clinton was a terrible candidate. I think history plays that out. It had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her.
@EdKrassen Yea, who cares. As a Marine veteran, I’m embarrassed by his behavior and as importantly... his poor decision making skills. To think people followed his orders.
@IndieSindie @JordanChariton @BernieSanders @TheView @HillaryClinton Thanks. But, I hate that is our reality. It’s so sad. But, most importantly, it’s dangerous.
@JordanChariton @BernieSanders @TheView @HillaryClinton Democrats have continued to prove that winning isn’t their #1 goal. It wasn’t in 2016, either. Their main objective is to keep it all in house. Winning only matters to them if they can win with their candidate. Otherwise, just like in 2016, they’d rather hand the power over.
@BackFromDeadRed @EdKrassen @BernieSanders I agree. But I’m curious how that doesn’t equate to negligence. They know the facts. They just don’t discuss them.
@EdKrassen @BernieSanders Totally agree and the media doesn’t help on that front. I can’t recall ever seeing them try and explain the difference. They tend to just toss out the big “S” word and leave it at that. It’s negligent.
@IngrahamAngle Makes more sense than you interviewing anyone.
@WhiteHouse Are you really trying to take a stance about the freedom of the press! Who are you kidding. You can’t call them the enemy of the people &amp; then try to use suppression of the press as a reason for outcry. It’s pathetic &amp; it’s beneath the United States of America. Disgraceful.
@allinwithchris So many angry little nothings commenting here. I hope they don’t cry themselves to sleep about an interview. Grow up. Respect different opinions and act like you have some decency toward people. “I hate Bernie.” Oh the tears. Sensitive pricks
@WhiteHouse It’s comedy hour at the White House.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris Agreed. Hopefully, more can be cordial but still go at it.  Respect
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris Haha. Hey, I enjoy good debate. I can be right. I can be wrong (not saying I am here lol). But, that’s America. I respect where you’re coming from.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris Ok. Agree on that lol
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris 🤦🏻‍♂️I killed people with a rifle. I know that AR does not stand for assault rifle.  Your selected post mentioned assault rifles. Not mine.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris Assault weapons have nothing to do with what we were discussing! You can take the conversation wherever you want but you can’t take my opinion with you. You might think you’re protecting yourself but you have no chance against the weapons the g’ment has. Outdated debate
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris Ok, I agree to disagree. If you think anyone is after guns thats your paranoia.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris When this came up in 1776 we had no constitution and no second ammendment. We weren’t a nation. Your story had a lot to do with developing the second amendment but that is not an explanation of the lobbyist once it was a protected right. Then you mentioned everything but America
@billmaher We all know why it’s being covered like this. Americans are no longer about America. They are all about their affiliations. It’s sad and destructive.
@Morning_Star85 @CNNnewsroom @RepGregoryMeeks @PoppyHarlowCNN I don't agree with you about Bernie, but I appreciate how you view this. That I agree with. Focus on their ideas and track records.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris When exactly did that happen? When were guns “completely” banned without anyone protecting them?
@kicranston @USMC Thanks for the follow. Only just beginning.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris A constitutional amendment shouldn’t need lobbyists. That’s why it’s an amendment in our constitution. So all they are doing is trying to spread their power. I think guns have enough protection without lobbyist trying to add to it.
@kicranston @USMC Yes, I had typo. I was “hurt.”
@kicranston @USMC Thank you! Wish I hadn’t had the typo lol. But, I’m a humanist. What’s good for you is good for me. I followed you out of respect. America needs it now more than ever
@kicranston They love trying to deminsish. I served in the @USMC for over 8 years. Was medically retired agate being hurt. I still think you all should have free healthcare and education. I’m for prosperity and not me vs. you.
@MeetThePress Why @SenSanders can win. We all knew this. Welcome to the discussion.
@MeetThePress How about in reality. Where everyday American problems are addressed and not discounted as an outlier. It’s on you. Get out of your bubble.
@thehill It has been playing out in front of us all... why do I need a NYT report to tell me that?
@MeetThePress @ericgarcetti No! Look at the polls and relay truth to Americans. I know it’s hard for you insiders to get outside the beltway... but you better try or you screw us all.
@LOSTCAUSE06 @KamalaHarris For starters, they lobby for gun rights. As a veteran who has used them, I’m not a fan. Her audience already agrees. Take the fight to the influencers. That’s all. She was picking low hanging fruit
.@realDonaldTrump is a child. He cries when his feelings are hurt. He tries to undermine authority. He tries to bully his opinions on us all. He fear mongers. He acts just like someone who was never held accountable for his actions. He is pathetic &amp; it’s worse we elected him. 🤦🏻‍♂️
@WalshFreedom Not surprising, he is a Marine. He knows what he is doing and how to lead. #SemperFiBrother
@KamalaHarris Don’t tell us. Tell the damn NRA
@WhiteHouse Omg! It’s @realDonaldTrump’s dream come true. A complete white out.
@kicranston @ninaturner What a hypocrite he is!
@MeetThePress @PhilipRucker Not sure what this means. Does that mean he’ll let it go public because it’s the right thing to do or does that mean he won’t care to keep it private? This shouldn’t be up for debate. You make it ALL public knowledge and protect NOBODY. Democracies are meant to be transparent.
@thehill I didn’t think he knew who it was.
@EdKrassen I’d agree, but I think we are past that point. It has been on full display. He is a narcissistic crackpot. Dangerous combo.
@TheRickWilson It’s a waste of valuable money. Some would say... money meant for an EMERGENCY!!
@SenSanders This is all too familiar. It’s capitalism running amuck. Greed, greed and greed. People flip the bill and it’s heartbreaking. #ItShouldNotBeThisWay
@RandPaul Is this because you want one on you when your neighbor attacks you again?
@CNNPolitics The key difference between socialism &amp; democratic socialism is that democratic socialists DON'T want the gov't to own the means of production &amp; socialists do. They believe certain general social goods like health care should be run by the gov't, but otherwise support capitalism.
@thehill How is this newsworthy? Who cares. I have a nickname... “dumbass in chief.”
@thehill Hey, hey! See what happens when Walker and the GOP are out! Good news.
RT @thehill: JUST IN: Wisconsin governor announces proposal to decriminalize marijuana possession  https://t.co/phiEWd5pUm https://t.co/q5k…
@EdKrassen @BarackObama Totally agree. I’d only add that I’m old enough to remember when other members of the party wouldn’t sit back and watch it happen.
@taniaT504 @realDonaldTrump And Trump giving him the “ugh, ugh, what” look.
One of the most dangerous aspects of @realDonaldTrump’s “presidency” is that the real issues facing America are not being addressed. Not even the low hanging fruit of infrastructure that both parties agree on.
@thehill #Traitor. He is an absolute joke. A dangerous joke, but a joke.
RT @TheRickWilson: My GOD. 		They're flooding in over the porus, open border. Nothing can stop them! Sweet Jesus tell my family I love them…
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Tell me the one about the LEGAL coup? Does @realDonaldTrump know what “coup” means? Not to mention, you quoted a conspiracy theorist nut job to try and prove the point that an amendment in our CONSTITUTION is illegal!!??? Glad you tweet this nonsense. Nobody would believe me
@realDonaldTrump Asshat in chief spatting off again. Yawn
@politicalHEDGE My Ohio State man getting it done.
@DennisDMZ I don’t think @realDonaldTrump has handled winning as well as he should have. He is likely still shocked. He is a moron
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump I can’t get over him quoting a hack like Rush Limbaugh to try and prove a point. I’ll say this, he doesn’t usually put a name to a quote. It’s usually “believe me,” or “people are saying,” or even better “people are telling me.” What a clown
@realDonaldTrump Hahahahaha. Really!? We want to quote Rush Limbaugh as a way to protect yourself. You’re a partisan hack and have no business in our White House. What goes around, comes around and running for President will prove to be the dumbest decision you made. Accountability will get you.
@mitchellreports The “pretender in chief.” The snowflake. The con artist. The 243 pounds of useless fat and bones that currently occupies OUR Oval Office.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Why do you act like this is a good thing? Do you want crap like this to happen to make you look better? This is not a tweet from someone who wants what’s best for this country.
@realDonaldTrump What are you, a snowflake? Toughen up. I mean, Vietnam is over. You can at least act tough now.
@TheRickWilson One of the best shows on TV. I literally just plugged it via tweet to all of my 41 followers lol. @TheRickWilson would be a good add to the show!
If you don’t watch @SHO_TheCircus with @jheil, give it a try. It’s one of the best 30 minutes on TV. It’s on @Showtime tonight @ 8 p.m.
@MalcolmNance @realDonaldTrump He hates anything that limits what he wants to do. He simply does not understand the constitution of the country he CLAIMS to love. He is an ignorant asshole.
@CBSNews 🤦🏻‍♂️ that’s a way to retain support.. keep them uneducated. #TodaysAmerica
@davidaxelrod @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Well, I see no “silver lining” here. The avalanche continues.
@realDonaldTrump Mad bro? You are a complete and utter child. You’re pathetic.
@CNNPolitics He is not trying to win his base. He is trying not to lose them. He doesn’t understand math and doesn’t understand democracy. He probably thinks if he keeps some support... he can do what he wants. Including... not relinquishing office.
@deaisthename @WhiteHouse Lol. As a veteran, no he has not. Research where the emergencey funding is coming from. And really!!?? Infrastructure? Both Democrats and Republicans agree on that, but find an article that shows what’s being done. The wall is not infrastructure.
@WhiteHouse What are you going to do about the majority of those crimes? You know, the majority that already live within our borders. I have not heard squat about them.
@JeffReyes707 @CNNPolitics @Scotus If you want to be that simplistic... I’ll say “no.”
@CNNPolitics Am I the only one that thinks, based on Trump’s own behavior, it’s a conflict of interest for anything from this administration or elsewhere with his support to go to the @Scotus?
@cenkuygur @SenSanders @nytimes @wasingtonpost @YouTube The “powers that be” see it as a real threat to their way of life. Like you’ve said many times... it’s not a matter of smoked filled backrooms creating conspiracies. It’s a matter of being disconnected and out of touch.
Looks like all of the bitch slaps @realDonaldTrump eats from @FoxNews and @seanhannity have finally left a mark. They have to keep their bitch inline. https://t.co/i0E5eehVhd
@ashtonpittman It’s an imprint of the bitch smack Hannity has been hitting him with. You know, a pimp has to get his girls in line.
@WhiteHouse @SGottliebFDA Easy... just legalize marijuana already! Stop over thinking it. To avoid that topic or to run from it prevents progress.
@JeffreyGuterman It’s a small indication of how many of us hate @POTUS
@TheRickWilson I appreciate your efforts, @TheRickWilson, in trying to enlighten the GOP. I can’t help but to think of the Jethro Tull song “thick as a brick.”
@WhiteHouse It’s simple... if you don’t have a national emergency, you don’t declare one.
So, @realDonaldTrump says “I didn't have to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.” I didn’t realize that not having to address an issue makes it an emergency. I also didn’t know that expediency was the same thing as an “emergency.” He is thinking 2020
RT @billmaher: Here's a way I always thought you cld tell if something was NOT an emergency: when the solution involves cement. You never s…
@VP Geez... take your own advice! Hi pot, meet kettle
@realDonaldTrump An idiot feels smart because people think he’s an idiot? Is that the point here?
@Lawrence Well, I wouldn’t say “nothing.” He seems to love intervening in armed conflicts around the world 🤦🏻‍♂️
@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Reads like a “please believe us” message.
@johniadarola Only his children and republicans who love power more than responsibility.
@kaitlancollins I don’t think he understands the words that come out of this mouth. While declaring a national emergency, who says “I didn’t have to do this.” #DictionariesAreYourFriend
@USMC Recently had the opportunity to interview Hershel “Woody” Williams. What an honor. He is the lone surviving Marine from WWII with a Medal of Honor. Earned it on Iwo Jima. Semper Fi!
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson This is what happens when one moron watches two other morons on TV. Using an amendment of the constitution is unconstitutional?
@AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump You are having a breakdown
@AnnCoulter Ignorant bliss. However, are you just now realizing he is a moron?
@WhiteHouse How about you actually do something about it? Empty gesture. Like, how deep do your ties run in the NRA?
@SenSanders I have always respected and VALUED your transparency. Need a lot more of it 👊🏼		Oh, go ahead and take one more shot at the @WhiteHouse, Bernie.
@billmaher If only the orange menace had to “convince them.” He doesn’t have to work that hard... he just has to say it. He can’t put in enough work to convince anyone. Hence all the opposition. He’s a complete whiny little bitch.
@WhiteHouse @PressSec 🤦🏻‍♂️ Can’t fix stupid
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse Well, congratulations! Less tweeting and more reviewing, please.
@WhiteHouse Sensationalism, fear and false equivalencies... just another night at the @WhiteHouse
@jerrasic1 @ColinDGallagher @WhiteHouse @CBP @USMC I feel like I’m talking to a puppet. Take care. I’m out.
@ColinDGallagher @jerrasic1 @WhiteHouse @CBP @USMC I’m talking to jerrasic. Sorry
@jerrasic1 @ColinDGallagher @WhiteHouse @CBP @USMC Lol. No baseline for that remark. You have no idea of my feelings on abortion but thanks for proving the generalization that too many do.
It blows my mind that so many Americans want to pump nearly 6 billion dollars into a wall but education and healthcare is too expensive. Wtf is going on?
@jerrasic1 @ColinDGallagher @WhiteHouse @CBP @USMC The border is not a primary concern. It’s way down the list of problems facing America. Look at the numbers. A wall stops nothing. Do you really expect them to stop coming because of a wall? You underestimate their resilience. It’s like saying cops stop speeding. No they don’t.
@ColinDGallagher @jerrasic1 @WhiteHouse @CBP I tried to respond lol.
@jerrasic1 @ColinDGallagher @WhiteHouse @CBP That is 100% sensationalism. I served in the @USMC and fought in Afghanistan. I totally understand the sentiment. I don’t want anyone hurt, but it’s also their job that they signed up for. With what you’re saying, wouldn’t a wall hurt their families? They’d have no job.
@ColinDGallagher @WhiteHouse @CBP What he said ^
@DavidCornDC He’s a narcissistic incompetent prick. The key word in your tweet (to me) is *game. This is anything but a game.
@washingtonpost I have to question if @realDonaldTrump knows the American and North Korean history in Hanoi. Maybe he would if he had the balls to serve during the Vietnam war. What a stupid place to agree to meet.
@DavidCornDC @MalcolmNance At this point, it’s just foolish to think the GOP would care. Apparently, morals are something that just blows with the wind... where it lands nobody knows.
@realDonaldTrump Please, Mr. President, tell me more about your ability to recognize hatred and scorn. Asshole.
@SenatorCollins As a veteran, I never once considered or cared about another’s sexual orientation or beliefs. I only cared about if I could count on them or not. They volunteer. Take them. Assuming they’re qualified.
@princessbeca @cenkuygur @JeffBezos Ok. But what? Your comment means nothing.
@Dericulous @CNN @AOC I will and goodnight. Anyone who reads this will understand. I think we could discuss an overarching solution. But people are so filled with hate.
@Dericulous @CNN @AOC You lost me. If you haven’t read it how do you know it’s a one sided argument? In a nutshell, that’s America’s problem.  Facts are facts.
@Dericulous @CNN @AOC I appreciate you sharing that but that was weak. Dark money doesn’t apply to corporations. That was @AOC’s point. His response was futile. Read the book “Dark Money.”
@ministercookie @CNN I hope you’re wrong. But, history is on your side. How sad.
@CNN Ok, whatever, I get it, but that’s just ugly.
@Dericulous @CNN @AOC What does that have to with it? I get it, she’s young but she won’t curl over and die because she’s out of venom. Facts are facts and she painted a picture of what our system allows people to get away with. Not one word had anything to do with political parties.
@CNN You may or my not like @AOC but she nailed this. She put in proper perspective how corrupt our system is. What she explained isn’t a GOP or DEM problem... it’s much broader than that. It’s an American problem and it has gone on way too long.
@USMC Semper Fi, Marine.
@cenkuygur @JeffBezos He made a bigger mistake by agreeing to meet Kim Jung Un in Hanoi. He clearly doesn’t understand the American and North Korean history in that region. Likely because of his bone spurs.
@CNNPolitics Does @realDonaldTrump not know the American and North Korean history in Hanoi!!!?? Oh, he doesn’t, he had bone spurs and couldn’t fight for the country he claims to love so much. He loves this country because we have allowed him to get away with all of his antics and make money
@thebafflermag Isn’t that what the GOP believes? Love this headline.
@ChristopherNeth @1967smc I just gotta say, my fellow veteran, I love the photo on your profile! Lol
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump You simply cannot support Trump and your own well-being. It just doesn’t add up.
@ImmaBFD @CBSNews He makes it easy lol
@realDonaldTrump What the hell are you talking about. What evidence have you seen of this? When has he ever shown interest in something other than maintaining his power?
So, @realDonaldTrump had his physical today. From what I am hearing his bone spurs must have completely healed because he’s finally going to Vietnam.
@CBSNews He’s going to Vietnam, so I guess the bone spurs self-corrected. 🤦🏻‍♂️
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump Bone spurs better not stop this trip to Vietnam.
@realDonaldTrump And Trump finally has to go to Vietnam.
@WhiteHouse What crap. Transformed veterans care? You haven’t even implemented the Mission Act. You also locked VSOs out of the discussion. Took it to the opioid crisis? How? By being willing to discuss medical marijuana? Nope. Not that. Tossing money at something doesn’t mean it’s solved.
@realDonaldTrump We’ve seen your schedule 🤔
@Militarydotcom This should get more interesting 🤦🏻‍♂️

@kaitlancollins He didn’t have to. When you make your opinion publicly known, they don’t have to ask. I would still be surprised if he didn’t.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump It's all about himself, the mighty dollar and the perception of strength.
@kaitlancollins I have a hard time believing that. 🤔
@CNN News like this hurts. The world is a tough place. I’m a new father and my heart hurts for them. Hoping for the best.
@JeffreyGuterman At my age, I always think of “the odd couple” or the “angry old men” movies. “You know what really gives me the red ass?” Ha. @realDonaldTrump is who
@captainmctweety @Reuters I get it. I do. But for a Christian nation we sure as heck are not good at turning the other cheek. I didn’t advocate to save his life or protect him. But how we decide to treat him won’t bring back the victim, either. It’s a cruel reality.
@Reuters A lot of people are here mocking a man’s dying wish. Why? He is going to die. Would it have been denied if it were a Christian requesting a priest? I think we know the answer. It’s not hard to get an imam in there. I promise it won’t make him come back to life.
We have to stop creating false equivalencies &amp; oversimplifying our problems. We need to take them more seriously &amp; find solutions. It starts with all of us having a voice.
@RadioFreeTom We overuse labels and terms so we feel comfortable &amp; feel like we understand the issue. I’m a capitalist, but I have concerns about where human rights end &amp; capitalism begins. From what I’m told that makes me a “socialist.” Because I’m pro free education &amp; healthcare.
@team4nicholas @robreiner Did I say anything about that? How about your ability to stay on topic?
@MaorBatashvili @WhiteHouse Speaking of idiot... your sentence makes no sense when you use the word “cause.” Didn’t have the time for the “be” part?
@JeffreyGuterman I enjoy how you keep history alive. If more of us did, we would not be in the situation we are as a nation. #LearnFromHistory
@jaketapper “This is a lynching. This is a legal lynching of me," Stone said in a recent interview on the fringe right-wing website Infowars.”		I don’t think he knows what a “lynching” is. What a dumb and insensitive remark. During black history month no less.
@robreiner They don’t even want to put in the “grunt work” to reunite these families &amp; its appalling! This is the USA, who I fought for in Afghanistan, essentially saying “you’re not Americans so we don’t care.” Explain putting our lives on the line for civilians in the Middle East then?
@WhiteHouse I don’t think our definition of “greatness” is the same.
@WhiteHouse 2 of the 4 activities involve food... I get it now.
@CNN You can take it to the bank... if they do not succeed... climate will change us. Ignore it at all of our peril.
@WhiteHouse It’d help if you started listening to those who disagree then. Words mean nothing.
@BrattylilAngel0 @MSNBC No debate from me. Both parties make mistakes and then try and take high ground. I feel like both parties have to accept the fact they aren’t always right. So do “we the people.”
@henryrodgersdc I don’t believe that shit at all. Say what you want about Bernie, he doesn’t dodge. Believe it or not, he probably had other shit to do than offer an opinion.
@robreiner As much as I agree... I hope he is out of office before whatever he is verbally vomiting is true.
@MSNBC Not shocking. The “rules” don’t apply to our supreme leader. Too many Americans don’t seem to understand or grasp the danger he creates.
@NBCNews We are likely better off that he doesn’t.
@CNNPolitics Most people know this. As much as I hate it, I fought directly against it, it’s not going away. Terrorism in general is here to stay. The discussion should be how best to fight against it. It doesn’t have to be boots on the ground. I’d encourage against it. Investigative work.
@CNN Of course he did. This is exactly the type of move he makes that either not enough people know about or not enough get concerned about. Drain the swamp my ass.
@ananavarro https://t.co/lvbx7dQMUN
@JeffreyGuterman @realDonaldTrump I’d also encourage each and every one of them to think about why it wouldn’t be. To think so many claim to be constitutional law experts 🤔
@CNN A problem only humans could create 🤦🏻‍♂️ 		Just legalize it already!!
@MSNBC But why? Didn’t @realDonaldTrump say just this week that “We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes.” 		Why boots on the ground if it’s such a threat? 🤦🏻‍♂️
@CSIS @MalcolmNance @SethGJones @natsecdalton @danrunde Chaos and lost sacrifice. We are between a rock and a hard place. Can’t stay forever but the strategy was probably wrong from the beginning. We are creating as many enemies as we are eliminating. More investigative work and less combat.
@chl_bo @WhiteHouse Fingers crossed!
@chl_bo @WhiteHouse I predict it’s his narcissism and reelection hopes at play. He tries to project so much strength and power. The perception of “such great” military success would be his mountaintop. Your thought is quite possible as well. What a time to be alive 🤦🏻‍♂️
@CNN I don’t think she has handled this all that well, but it’s certainly not keeping me up at night. Not when I consider everything else this country is facing.
In general, political pundits &amp; politicians lack depth in their critique of our #SOTU. The way so many debates are framed ignores the reason certain topics/solutions are being raised. Democratic socialism is an example. America has become “haves” vs. “have nots.” #Unsustainable
America is better at presenting a perception than creating a reality. All of the applauding, “USA” chants &amp; song singing seemed to undermine the serious problems our nation, form of government &amp; our everyday citizens are facing. Demonstrate a little sense of urgency. #SOTU
@Nick09405 @JeffreyGuterman Thanks, brother. I hate to say it, but I agree with your last sentence and that is terribly heartbreaking. Thanks for your service! I was medically retired after two enlistments.
@JeffreyGuterman I’m just saddened by the fact that my newborn son’s first #SOTU is being delivered by this narcissistic fool. Not what I had in mind when serving in the Marines. 🤦🏻‍♂️
@CNN Oh, it’s going to be “special.”
@JeffreyGuterman @Aristocles11 It means so much to a hitter and especially a young and inexperienced hitter to know they will get 4 ABs every night. Takes the edge off and let’s them play their game. I think Dustin Pedroia was hitting .172 after April during his rookie year and went on to win ROY
@JeffreyGuterman “The Say Hey Kid.” My dads favorite.
@jaketapper @barbarastarrcnn @TheLeadCNN I wish I was more surprised to hear this, but the truth is, I’d only be surprised if @POTUS had actually sought advice. As a Marine who served in Afghanistan... he does not know more than the generals 🤦🏻‍♂️

@CNN I’d like to see @realDonaldTrump take this seriously. A wall will not do anything to stop Mother Nature from making us all pay a steep price.
@AnnCoulter Are you freaking kidding me? Grow up. The world does NOT evolve around you.
@nytimes Are we talking football or a certain @realDonaldTrump’s approval rating?
@billmaher Doesn’t seem that complicated, does it? #FactsMatter
@dude_patriot “Faith: strong belief in God or in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual apprehension rather than proof.”		*absent of proof. Hard to guide my life to something without it. Not a whole lot different than wishful thinking/hoping. However, your point is well taken.
@nytimes #MedicalMarijuana anyone? It’s far past time.
@AnnCoulter A lot of things help with adversity and ups and downs. I tend to find it more helpful to have tangible beliefs and not wishful thinking/hoping.
@CNNPolitics Hey, democracy, take a back seat to my power hungry beliefs and what I think is best for me and my donors.
@maggieNYT In my opinion, there should not even be a debate about this. It has to be made public. All of it. Not one word should be hidden from the public. For heavens sake we need and deserve transparency!
@JRubinBlogger It’s probably because they’re not any different. It’s as simple as they value their positions more than they do this country.
@theintercept @shaunking Cautiously optimistic is a pretty good way to put it. However, I feel that until the Democrats leave corporations and their money behind there will always be questions about their motives. Let’s get money out of politics.
https://t.co/HdtU4lu36c “We have very fast airplanes, we have very good cargo planes. We can come back very quickly, and I'm not leaving.” 		His “in-depth” thought process is frighteningly simple.
