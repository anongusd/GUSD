@il_american @decunningham2 Given the most interesting common feature of previous EC system/PV splits - leading to Presidents Adams II, Hayes, Harrison II, and Bush II - Trump predicting the #ElectoralCollege would rob him of victory against a President Clinton II wasn't all that strange.
@Kayla81033401 It *might* contribute to keeping the two-party system mostly in place. (This can't be proven or disproven; I would say an effect is likely but weak.)		Not everyone likes the two party system, but if you do, that would be a reason.
For the same reason that large states dominate the EC (small shifts in popular votes lead to large shifts in electoral votes), the EC also incentivizes fraud strongly - along with voter suppression, count manipulations, and other forms of cheating by state and local officials. https://t.co/ULBICPfrhR
Now we reach a completely nonsensical reason. There's nothing but empty absurd rhetoric in claiming popular votes are un-American. If voting is un-American, then why do we vote for more offices more often than people in other countries? Why didn't we just stick with monarchy? https://t.co/9xN9dLOxee
Standard but incorrect appeal to the power of small states, factually wrong but understandable.		You can say that CA "decided" the popular vote in 2016 - but by the same standard, TX decided the EC. The EC amplifies large state margins into landslides.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p https://t.co/AFoX6LPKWX
The #ElectoralCollege doesn't preserve state power in the ways they're talking about. Their main example is about national health care.		Federal supremacy doesn't depend on the EC, though some growth in federal supremacy relates to the Civil War. See #1 for added irony. https://t.co/h1ClWzPdvp
Claiming the EC system is responsible for "geographical, cultural, and agricultural diversity" is absurd. It does not make tobacco or cotton grow better in the South, make Maine home to lobster fishing, or cause California to grow wines. This is simply wrong. https://t.co/eL4uHamMUB
The EC system led to a civil war in 1860. While the war did have an end result of putting an end to slavery, I prefer that electoral systems not start civil wars, and drilling down into the mechanical details of the election shows alarming possibilities.		https://t.co/YfybSkgjqZ https://t.co/GYIi9WuBhH
I'm seeing a TownHall article circulating in defense of the #ElectoralCollege. It gives 6 reasons to like the EC, which range from questionable to wrong to nonsensical.		The merely questionable one is about the end of slavery.
@Hoosierindepen All six of those are baldly incorrect.
@MittGer "The election system set off a Civil War" is usually classified as a bug rather than a feature.		Ending slavery was a good thing, but generally speaking, most of us would prefer to avoid civil wars. They're quite chancy things.
@jenkins1967 @RealJamesWoods The main reason being to try to insure that the President wouldn't be a puppet of Congress. Another reason was that it was the closest thing to a direct popular vote that could assemble support.		The #ElectoralCollege itself was not designed to protect small states.
@cryptographico2 @sean_spicier Those numbers are wrong. 		https://t.co/GVQ1sE3Ai0		Also, the conclusions are wrong. Want to see the election decided by swings in a few key counties? 		All Clinton needed to do to win the #ElectoralCollege was to score Obama-2012 margins in 3(!) key metro areas. https://t.co/088paHevYp
@Kayla81033401 When that's on the table, it's a lot more understandable why New England's delegations - representing states with no slaves - would still oppose a direct vote.		Not that you're likely to learn about the messy details like that from Prager's videos.		https://t.co/zm7k5hjeVW
@Kayla81033401 It's hard to overemphasize (B). In 1790, VA had slightly more white inhabitants than PA, but VA required property to vote while PA allowed every man (including black ones) to vote, so PA had *far* more eligible voters.
@Kayla81033401 The emphasis on slavery as an explanation for the #ElectoralCollege is off.		The oft-cited Madison speech referenced has two other important features:		(A) In it, he endorses a direct vote anyway.	(B) There was a *lot* of disagreement over who should be allowed to vote.
@Munkinsons This is pretty much backwards.		The ability of a single large state to decide the election is increased by the #ElectoralCollege, not decreased.
@musicman495 @ForecasterEnten ... in the modern primary system (1972-present), placing 1st in IA + NH + eventually losing has only been done by Muskie (1972), though Ford almost joined him in 1976 w/ the Reagan primary challenge. (Bit of a different beast from an open field, though.)
@musicman495 @ForecasterEnten My take would be that any candidate who manages, out of such a large field, to place first in both IA and NH is in a good position, and will survive the 4 early states regardless of who wins SC/NV.		I doubt any candidate will do so, but as you say, haven't even had 1st debates...
@DrTandtheLg @MaskedAek One hard-to-quantify factor that holds back a significant # of children of immigrants unless you spend more $ on interpreters or bilingual teachers:		Parent-teacher communication.		This is a double whammy when you factor in the importance of parent volunteers in school success.
@DrTandtheLg @MaskedAek About 1/10 of students are designated English language learners; special accommodation for them is not cheap (somewhere around +30-50% cost,  AFAIK) and only partially closes the gap. 		I'd envelope that as a fairly large effect. "Largest," I would not be sure. (3/3)
@DrTandtheLg @MaskedAek First factor: Immigrant parents make less money than non-immigrant parents. So they do pay less in taxes per student added. (We could say this about any low-income group.)		Second factor: Some of these students require more to reach equal performance. How much is unclear. (2/3)
@DrTandtheLg @MaskedAek Thought I would eyeball some figures. About 1/4 of K-12 students are children of immigrants, which is similar to the immigrant share of the population. 		At a first pass, that seems comparable, about 1/4 of tax base and 1/4 of students, but there are some add'l factors. (1/3)
https://t.co/Wn4E9uuEQZ		Considering the amount of misinformation about the #ElectoralCollege in circulation, I'm surprised at how good this article is.
@pennyro79328366 @VoteAndy History says that you have that backwards. Because of the #ElectoralCollege system, New York has decided more presidential elections than its fair share.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@gencaboose @EricHolder The numbers is that are completely wrong. FYI. She won almost 10 times as many counties as that.		https://t.co/GVQ1sE3Ai0		As far as key counties deciding the election ... Clinton only needed to match Obama's performance in 3 key metro areas to win the #ElectoralCollege. https://t.co/2efWOCH9BR
@KaiserWunderbar @eshaLegal You may as well say that he won the #ElectoralCollege because of only Texas; this is as apt.
@prageru If you think the #ElectoralCollege forces candidates to appeal broadly across the entire country, you have, at a minimum, failed to recall the election of 1860.		https://t.co/YfybSkgjqZ
@RWNemanich My thoughts on the subject in more detail are here:		https://t.co/zm7k5hjeVW
@RWNemanich The radical democrats who wanted an at-large vote, like Wilson, seemed to back the EC as the closest they could get to having the president chosen by the people. It was never a decision between EC and a direct vote, but Congress vs. EC, or Congress vs. direct vote. (2/2)
@RWNemanich I would disagree that it was created as a political compromise to get the slave states to accept the Constitution; NC &amp; SC delegations were the last holdouts *against* the EC. The main alternative at the CC - election by Congress - also had 3/5 compromise distortion. (1/2)
@RWNemanich (There's also some gliding past the difference between plurality and majority involved with this.)
@RWNemanich When you have one "definitely," two "I'm not sure, flip a coin," and your sample is really 1828-1992 (164 years), counting that as an estimated rate of 1 per 200 years is bad math.
@RWNemanich It's Hardaway (1994). Describes the election of a president "lacking a majority" as a 1 in 200-year event, counting only 1888. This requires some disingenuous counting whereby he explicitly discounts 1876 and 1960, implicitly discounts 1824, and glosses over the changes.
Currently reading through a book on the #ElectoralCollege that has me muttering angrily to disagree every page or two.		Even (or perhaps especially) people who claim that numbers aren't important make incorrect use of mathematics to try to prove their claims about the EC.

@meza_rafa @NancyRGough That might be higher than the percentage of peer-reviewed studies that replicate, depending on field. It's not as if we can take published papers as if they are some sort of inerrant canon law, or as if citing unpublished material is new. (Sometimes publishing takes a long time.)
@JeffreyASachs ...as far as I can tell, "outrage mobs" almost always involve attempts to cause offline consequences.
@JeffreyASachs I don't think you *can* bracket that off.		E.g., SSC case, based on the description you provided later in the thread, involved doxxing, attempts to cut off income, and all sorts of offline consequences.		Perhaps I don't follow right wing media enough to have a good sample, but...
@causalinf What he *does* do is startle people when he passes them, because he runs so quietly that they don't hear his footfalls coming. 		Makes me think that concentrating on trying to be "sneaky" - absolutely silent footfalls - might be one way to get to better form habits. (4/4)
@causalinf See in particular the Vibram lawsuit. Personally, also, my father's form is more consistently clean than mine when it comes to soft footfalls, and he hasn't ever gone into the barefoot / minimalist shoe thing in his many decades of running.		He's had zero knee problems ever. (3/
@causalinf While I do think the barefoot thing helped my form out some, the evidence for results from making a sudden change to barefoot or minimal shoes (e.g., Vibram Fivefingers) is mixed, and it would certainly be an easy way to injure yourself in transition. (2/
@causalinf Choosing your paths carefully could help. Concrete is worse than asphalt, asphalt is worse than turf.		Form matters a lot, too. When I was younger, I did the barefoot thing some, and everybody told me that's supposed to help force you into better form. I'm a little skeptical. (1/
(9) The Republicans' primary system could (and did) choose a candidate backed neither by a majority of Republican voters nor by party insiders.		The Democrats' primary system can't. You either need the backing of a majority of Democratic voters or the backing of party insiders.
(8) The Democrats still have #superdelegates (they're just not allowed to overrule a majority of pledged delegates) who get to vote in subsequent rounds.		In a convention floor fight, superdelegate (insider) support is likely to be critical to victory.
(7) That's not to say Sanders can't benefit from greater division of candidates. In either plurality voting or fundraising, having a higher floor of support means you benefit from a wide field.		However, he must build majority support to win. Trump didn't have to in 2016-R.
(6) Political outsiders generally have trouble winning convention floor fights. I'm not saying Sanders couldn't possibly pull it off, but coming in with a narrow plurality of support isn't a guarantee of victory when #WTA/WTM rules haven't created an artificial majority.
(5) Trump won the contest with minority support (45% or so depending on measurement techniques). His delegate count was inflated by #WTA/WTM rules. If 2020-D is that divided, a #BrokeredConvention goes to multiple rounds of voting.
(4) E.g., a few months ago, CNN polled him at +58/-23 among non-white voters,  a group he lost to Clinton in the 2016 primary. There are Democrats who like Sanders but prefer someone else; his support base does not appear as narrow as Trump's appeared in 2016.
(3) Sanders probably can't win every 1v1 contest, but out of the major contenders, he could probably win at least some. His reliability as a progressive (if not as a D-partisan) is widely accepted, and his raw approval numbers are good pretty widely.
(2) First, Trump appeared to be a #Condorcet loser among major 2016-R contenders &amp; would have likely lost 1v1 against any in a 2-person race.		There is little reason to believe the same is true of Sanders. 		Second, 2016-R used winner-take-all/most rules (#WTA), 2020-D will not.
(1) I've noticed some analogies being made b/w Sanders in the 2020-D field and Trump in the 2016-R field, and that Sanders could win the #2020DemocraticPrimary in a similar way (his path to nomination is a divided field).		The analogy is flawed in a couple of major ways.
@PsychRabble @jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish Drawing conclusions (or not) from T4 isn't a trust issue. It's a basic design issue. You can conclude "X OR Y" where X and Y are very different effects with different policy implications, but you can't just conclude X.
@PsychRabble @jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish If the controls were fully designed before being applied (which may or may not have been the case here), you have [potentially] meaningful implications in T5-T7 looking at the individual level, depending on the actual outcomes.		Preregistration solves the trust problem.
@PsychRabble @jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish I don't disagree that nearly *any* regression *can* be controlled into producing a desired effect.		However, if you are doing an observational study of this type and *not* using a design that controls for selection effects, you can't know you have any other type of effect at all.
@PsychRabble @jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish (The offered explanation is basically that in semi-final rounds, there was discrimination in favor of women by juries / committees. This does not build support for evidence of discrimination against women.) https://t.co/oyJeTvyn1l
@PsychRabble @jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish T4 is not a major problem for the paper's thesis, given that selection effects can be expected to confound any discrimination effects and T6-7 offer a control for the confound.		The negative semi-final coefficients are fundamentally less tractable. https://t.co/oXKzSVdwTq
@jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish @PsychRabble No individual test of a single approach being p &lt; 0.05 isn't really a major problem; results in both directions is. 		E.g., three independent p=0.1 effects pointing in the same direction is (statistically and empirically) much stronger evidence than a single p=0.04 effect.
@jonatanpallesen @joelwatsonfish @PsychRabble We have really good reasons to think that selection effects are important. In the T5-7 range, there's a real effort to control for those selection effects via individual effect.		Without that control, even a p=0.01 observation could easily just be selection effects at work.
@NYC__Native ... would not be higher than has happened in other political contests. Weird things occasionally happen, along with significant shifts in public opinion. These aren't p=0 events; they are not high-p events, but they happen non-trivially.
@NYC__Native I *am* an actual expert in how numbers work and how people make mistakes in doing social science (such as in predicting an election outcome). Correlated errors are a thing.		Sanders still had an outside chance after 3/15. The "egg-on-face" factor for forecasters like Enten ...
@NYC__Native @ForecasterEnten @FiveThirtyEight He was never not an underdog; but a "fundamental shift" of polling being off in one key region by a not-unexpected-margin plus a handful of points of underlying shift in support is not a p=0 event.		After NY, it was clearly time to him to concede if he wanted to mend fences.
@NYC__Native @ForecasterEnten @FiveThirtyEight His position was still wavering up to 4/19; after that, the share of remaining delegates steadily increased even after victories (e.g., in Indiana) and there was no plausible path to majority short of unexpected death or a scandal much larger than the DNC one that broke later.
@NYC__Native @ForecasterEnten @FiveThirtyEight Michigan is larger than average, with a very politically significant share of black Democratic voters.		The sort of "fundamental shift" that Sanders needed based on the data was little more than the margin of overall polling error plus a handful of points - before 3/15 and 4/19.
@NYC__Native This is quite clearly a prediction. Instead, things were bad in Sanders in Ohio, worse than his eventual actual results in every adjacent state. This may have had more to do with the Republican primary than with Ohio voters' preferences between Democrats. https://t.co/x1ZLEgx0PX
@NYC__Native Not great proxies, in other words. 		For the entire West ... NV and CO are not good proxies for CA+WA+OR. 		We started to see a sense of the West only after March 15th, and those earlier Western contests were very strongly in Sanders' favor, leading to significant gains.
@NYC__Native Which "nearby / similar" states to NY and CA had already voted?		For NY, what? VT, where Sanders cleaned up for entirely predictable reasons; MA, where he out-performed his national polling and came close, ME, where Sanders cleaned up; NH, where Sanders cleaned up.
@NYC__Native From the shifting polling on the ground, shifting performance by demographic in states, the ordinary wild variation in turnout, and the untested regional wild cards, the Northeast was quite unclear. Remember, NH + MA + significant shifts towards Sanders in national polling.
@NYC__Native It's not unusual for candidates to shift significantly over time during a primary, or for state-particular / region-particular effects to be decisive in a contest.		Predictions of which states Sanders would do better in in the Vox article you posted, for example, were terrible.
@NYC__Native State-level polling projections is, was, and remained terrible. The interactions between regional and demographic effects are a big wild card, as well as patterns of turnout variation (primaries have relatively unpredictable turnout rates), news cycle shifts, and scandals.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble Also, it occurs to me there's an obvious university-accessible low-budget experimental version of the study that should be easy enough: Have subjects evaluating blind / non-blinded musicians.		There ought to have been such studies done somewhere. Unless file-drawered. Hm...
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble I will say that as I'm digesting and re-digesting, there is a strong point made by @jonatanpallesen that the paper's stats as presented are an oversell, *especially* thinking seriously about dependence. The paper looks at n=(veryverysmall) conductors / orchestras.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble That's happening when you have a clear means / motive / opportunity for discrimination by conductors who are on the record as not liking female musicians.		I.e., circumstance + rosters + individual auditions together are a reasonable case for the thesis of the paper.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble I think the paper itself is ultimately justified, on the balance, when it says that the evidence points towards the blinding having had an effect.		It shows a number of individually weak measures, hovering in the statistically suggestive range, pointing mostly in that direction.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble Unless I am missing the list of which 8 orchestras it is and that overlaps only one of the blind ones.		That said, discrimination would presumably be happening (or not) in the non-blind case, i.e., with the blind auditions serving as a control.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble Ultimately, this IS only talking about n=11 orchestras.		The Medium article says that the blind entries from Table 5 came from only 1 orchestra. The paper says there were audition records from 8 orchestras in the sample; I think this may be a misreading by Jonatan Pallasen.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble I've certainly seen overselling of the paper's results, implying blind auditions caused the entirety of the change or made gender ratios completely equal. 		The biggest weakness from a statistical perspective is, I think, not in rote calculation or p-fishing.... it's dependence.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble The effect wobbles uncertainly (why should semis be different from finals or preliminaries?) and the paper only claims 1/4-1/3 of the variance based on the two analyses (bulk estimate based on roster / individual audition success).
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble The within-individual analysis is by design a better measure than the (dismissed as confounded by selection effects) gross success rate. The expected presence of discrimination in non-blind auditions over the period is reasonable (documented with quotes).		It *is* small-n.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble The paper has a strong base circumstantial case: 		(A) Orchestras became much more female.	(B) There were clearly prominent conductors who vocally disliked female musicians.	(C) Blind screens took over during the span of (A).
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble Now that I'm reading, I can recall having combed through this before.		I would say it's unfair to say that the claim about blind auditions "doesn't hold up." It's fair to say that the positive evidence is small-n, and that the paper is oft-cited for a small-n observation.
@joelwatsonfish @jonatanpallesen @PsychRabble I will have a look-see.
@SeanDEhrlich Since I went to a UC, my dissertation is freely accessible online. (Which, by the way, is awesome of UC. Those UC dissertations add up to a lot of publicly available research.)		Gets a handful of views / downloads a month. Might be just bots scraping content. I hope it's people.
I feel there's an important distinction between attacking a political candidate (e.g., "Candidate X is a bigot!") and attacking their supporters ("You support X? You must be a bigot!").		I think it's much harder to mend fences in the latter case. Is this a crazy thought?
@NYC__Native He did come back with the very next wave of states, quite strongly. 		At that point, the entire Northeast hadn't been tested against the polls; a whole high-uncertainty region. IMO, the time to count Sanders out of a plausible path to a majority of pledged delegates was after NY.
@NateSilver538 For example,  Sanders has highlighted his record in the civil rights movement and talked about racism - and very specifically anti-black racism - enough times that it's clear he's interested in appealing to black voters.		That doesn't mean black voters will break towards Sanders.
@NateSilver538 I don't think it matters whether or not Sanders is *interested* in uniting the different factions; I think he clearly *is* interested in uniting multiple factions of the party.		What matters is how those factions respond to Sanders.
@SenhorRaposa I could also see maintaining the appearance of a 50 state strategy paying dividends nationally and down ballot, even if those electoral votes are not in play in a 2 candidate contest...
@SenhorRaposa In a serious three or four way contest, anything could be on the table. Historically, that is easily a 10% scenario, and the indicators for it aren't at a historically low level.

(There is a perhaps tricky question on how you translate the results into a proportionate assignment of delegates for instant runoff type systems. There are good reasons not to want individual states to be winner-take-all pools.)
Plurality gets worse the more candidates you add.		There are a lot of other options that would give a lot more information about voters' preferences in a less chaotic way - approval ballots, Borda counts, or instant runoffs, to name a few. https://t.co/1pWipwebrg
(10) The combination highlighted as particularly troublesome (minority of total popular support and also disliked by party insiders) is unlikely with the Democrats' current rules.		Outsider with majority support, or insider with minority support, perfectly plausible. (fin.)
(9) If there's a risk, it's of the contest extending into the convention with no candidate reaching majority support. However, a candidate with minority popular support will need support of insiders to win a contested convention - superdelegates still have later-round votes.
(8) The Democrats used to use more variable rules, including winner-take-all/winner-take-most, in some key contests (contentiously including WTA in the case of CA in 1972). @NateSilver538 's examples - 1972-D, 1976-D, 2016-R - all involve non-proportional amplification.
(7) 3-4 viable candidates going into Super Tuesday is normal. The chaotic effects are concentrated early in the primary season and limited in impact by the absence of winner-take-all/most.		No unpopular candidate can gain a strong lead before the field consolidates.
(6) Attrition may not be strictly exponential, but it clearly depends on the size of the field and is faster with a larger field. If you win 0 delegates in IA and you didn't visibly snub the state, for example, that's deadly. More candidates = more with 0 delegates.
(5) ... many candidates will drop out early on or be disregarded as non-viable.		In a large field, I would expect 1/3 to 1/2 (or more) of the field to drop out or become disregarded per per contest, during the early 4 contests, until it's down to 3-4. Exponential decay is fast.
(4) The Democrats allocate delegates proportionately. You cannot have an unpopular nominee rack up a large early lead. You will not win 100% of delegates with 32.5% of the vote in a Democratic primary contest.		This means a long and potentially drawn-out contest. However...
(3) This was mainly due to winner-take-all/most rules. His strong early lead, for example, mostly came from the 50-0 delegate sweep from earning only 32.5% of the vote in South Carolina.		WTA causes chaos. Small changes in votes are amplified to large changes in delegate counts.
(2) Trump was most likely nominated in 2016 because of large field chaos among the Republicans. His head-to-head numbers against other Republican hopefuls were terrible.		However, he was able to get early front-runner status and win a delegate majority.
(1) It is a plain and simple mathematical fact that a larger number of [viable] candidates makes for a more chaotic election.		For the general election in the intrinsically chaotic #ElectoralCollege, things get very unpredictable very quickly with 3+ candidates. https://t.co/GfwO20CAdq
@donmoyn @BridgetPhetasy (C con't). Not strongly, but R-students getting lower grades in the study would affirm a claim of generic anti-R bias among TAs as well as the R-student sample simply having worse essays. The two causes are indistinguishable in that design.
@donmoyn @BridgetPhetasy If that's the best study, I would recommend follow-up studies.		(A) The design is highly vulnerable to demand effects.		(B) The sample of TAs (n=30) is small. The nulls are not a very strong nulls.		(C) The study exhibits a grade gap b/w D and R students. This implies bias.

@CapnSweet @mjaeckel Neither, I think. Anything he says can be coded as outrageous. This particular clip features him saying "Yes," agreeing with the interruption "Also known as slavery." 		If he'd avoided "indentured servant" in the first place, that could be coded as ignorance on slavery history...

@aaronfhamlin I do have some minor quibbles. For (4), the #ElectoralCollege system severely challenges national-scale reform of any kind.		For (5), I think it is clear that RCV is friendlier *than plurality* to 3rd parties, much as a simple majority runoff is; even if not the friendliest.
@fancynancyh84 @ArinaBones2 It was a decent school; IIRC, the guarantee was contingent on GPA as well, but a much more relaxed one than the GRE line. I had the sense they would probably have at least looked at a high-GRE-low-GPA applicant based on the high GRE score. (2/2)

@1StrongBlack1 @VABVOX In spite of population growth, 2 out of the last 3.		In the mean time, here's a slightly more meaningful measure: Sanders won the largest or second-largest number state contests (23) of any losing candidate for the Democratic nomination. (Clinton 1st or 2nd in 2008, w/ 22 or 24.)
@Jeanshelley5 @ChritopherMonk @BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump No on both counts. Gallup polling has shown that most people want to get rid of it most of the time.		Second, the #ElectoralCollege makes it easier to "a few states" (particularly the larger ones) to decide elections.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@1StrongBlack1 @VABVOX Now, go through those lists. Count how many numbers are bigger than 12% and how many are smaller than 12%. You will find that there are more on the bigger side.
@1StrongBlack1 @VABVOX Republicans' similarly not-meaningful popular margins in contested primaries:		2016: 19%	2012: 29%	2008: 24%	2000: 31%	1996: 38%	1988: 49%	1980: 36%	1976: 7% (primary challenge of incumbent)

@1StrongBlack1 @VABVOX No, quite literally closer than most. That was 12%. Here are the  the contested Democratic primaries with their (not particularly meaningful) nominal popular margins: 		2008*: -1 to 1%	2000: 54%	1992: 32%	1988: 13%	1984: 2.4%	1980*: 14%	1976: 26% 	1972: -0.5%
@beverlyfoust @ChritopherMonk @BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump That's much more likely to happen with the #ElectoralCollege than without. New York in particular has a long history of being decisive in presidential elections.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@ChritopherMonk @BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump It's slightly more complex math.		Imagine, for a moment, that California, after years of continued growth, has 270 electoral votes out of 538. California would have 50% of the electoral votes, but 100% of the power.		It's not linear. Large states usually determine the presidency.
@ChritopherMonk @BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump Most of them thought it was a bad system, too.		James Madison helped get it adopted in the first place, and *he* wanted to get rid of it. James Wilson was the first to bring it to the convention floor, and *he* preferred to have a direct vote by the people.
@ChritopherMonk @BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump Actually... 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@ChritopherMonk @BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump The last time the #ElectoralCollege worked per original expectations was when George Washington got re-elected. We've had multiple constitutional and political crises and near-crises (and one civil war) come out of presidential elections under the EC.		It's a bad system.
@BMcAdory9 @realDonaldTrump That's the sort of thing that happens when you legally have 51 separate little elections to fill an #ElectoralCollege rather than a single nationwide election. State by state ballot access issues are an actual thing.
@Aseemru I don't think he has a real incentive to resign. What does he get out of it? He doesn't even get to salvage reputation by resigning, he's going to get his name dragged through the dirt even if he *does* resign.
@NateSilver538 I would have to agree he has no visible incentive to resign.		If he resigns, he's the guy who resigned for a racism scandal, ergo persona non grata.		If he sticks it out, he has a full term and a chance to bury the scandal in three more years of achievements.
@mpfix1 I think that the fact that citations are a career/prestige-building device now interferes with the important academic practice of a clear and concise chain of custody of knowledge.		The "some current scholars claim X (example1, example2)" type of cite is flexible, I suppose.
@TheRealTwylaFox Very much not. Hillary Clinton was a known quantity - mainstream Democrat through and through, not appreciably more authoritarian, genocidal, anti-democratic, etc etc than the typical #ElectoralCollege victor.
@bldgblog The biotech cyberpunk version of "This is why you sanitize your database inputs."
@TheRealTwylaFox The core and basic argument is simply this: As an electoral system, the #ElectoralCollege is far more likely to help elect someone like Hitler than it is to prevent their election.		There are other types of institutions that help prevent Hitleresque leaders; the EC is not one.
@TheRealTwylaFox The Weimar Republic consisted of "free states" with their assorted own constitutions and identities as hypothetically sovereign entities dating back (in most cases) further than American states.
@StuartJRitchie If it genuinely fits all three, I'd go with "fraud" on the basis that it's the more universally egregious offense.		Someone who is incompetent or biased can justly take offense at being called a fraud; a fraud ought to be relieved to be mistaken for merely biased or incompetent.
@calahan_riley So can I get funding to build a radio-wave microscope and a scanning tunneling electron-beam telescope?
I mean, it's pretty weird that "Our #ElectoralCollege system will prevent the election of #Hitler" was even an argument offered, but people assign all kinds of strange properties to the EC that it doesn't have. It's a pretty haphazard system.
@KnowStraThomas @aseitzwald It is, the way that it works. 		https://t.co/T8ZhEZWo6R
@TheRealTwylaFox And the thorough follow-on for this line of argument over the #ElectoralCollege and #Hitler:		https://t.co/T8ZhEZWo6R
@joero3 , you said you were interested in the results of playing with simulating an #ElectoralCollege of the Weimar Republic... here's the write-up.		https://t.co/T8ZhEZWo6R
@_varsha_venkat Not in the exact same way - the debates within the CC are the best though not only key to the thinking of the delegates at the convention itself - but yes, the ratification debates are thoroughly important primary sources.
@_varsha_venkat That one made my list a while back. It's interesting.		Delving through a list of author names posted by a grad student to see if any of them have at any point misrepresented a few points of record when the primary source evidence has been very well collated is not, though.
@_varsha_venkat You can, if you like, ask them if they think that Madison fabricated this part of his notes, that they think the published journal of the proceedings and/or Madison's notes to have inaccurate tabulations of those votes, et cetera. https://t.co/FGF9CWxW8y
@_varsha_venkat They certainly talked about it on the record when debating other topics. https://t.co/suCmAOYEcx
@_varsha_venkat I'm pretty sure none of the experts listed would claim that Wilson was not in favor of direct elections, or that Madison didn't provide a principled endorsement of direct election (after Wilson's proposal failed). Or would contest the delegation votes on the EC (below). https://t.co/xWs16zgjey
@_varsha_venkat They talked about it a *lot* in debates at the convention.		Just not so much in the debates on the #ElectoralCollege system itself. There's Madison's speech of July 19th, though the full content and context of that one is often omitted from casual discussion.
@_varsha_venkat It's hard to say credibly that Hamilton, for example, was secretly trying to defend slavery, or that the entire Pennsylvania delegation was fond of the institution.		Conversely, it's hard to credibly claim that the South Carolinians wanted to see slavery dissolved.		3/3
@_varsha_venkat I wouldn't say there was *no* indirect influence of the elephant in the room on the room, but the pro-EC / anti-EC alignments were (mostly) the pro-democracy / anti-democracy alignments, and most of the major EC proponents also vocally backed a direct vote. 		2/
@_varsha_venkat I've combed through the accounts of every debate at the Convention on the #ElectoralCollege that shows up in Farrand, and it really doesn't come up much. The alignments also don't support slavery as an implied major factor, individually or by state delegation.		1/
@_varsha_venkat We may both know many Framers had suspicions about democracy, but the Vox article you linked to - which this particular point has digressed from - asserted that was irrelevant to the creation of the EC.
@_varsha_venkat Do you think it really have made it easier than election by Congress?		That's the alternative that Wilson, Hamilton, Madison etc were pushing against when they pushed for the #ElectoralCollege system.
@_varsha_venkat If you're fishing for "Congress was affected by the 3/5 compromise," I already said as much.		If you're trying to project the popular vote from the limited information available &amp; compare to 1796, I recommend you look at the Federalist seat losses across the board from MA to GA.
@_varsha_venkat Which, and why?		Are you suggesting that the Democratic-Republican majority elected to Congress in 1801, acting in joint session together, would have decided to elect Adams?
@g3rrity @_varsha_venkat I would tell you that you're quite plainly and obviously wrong about the #ElectoralCollege, but that there's a much more interesting case to be made about the American Revolution itself, and you are welcome to expand upon it.
@_varsha_venkat (There's certainly room to question (A), but the contemporary House elections point towards Adams losing popular support in states where Adams had legislator-appointed electors.)
@_varsha_venkat (A) Jefferson earned more votes, and it is likely he would have won more votes overall even had the entire country voted (unlike in 1796). 		(B) The incoming Democratic-Republican Congressional majority acting in a parliamentary election would likely have elected Jefferson.
I.e., name a presidential election, 1788-1860, that would have, under (A) an at-large vote or (B) a Congressional vote, given a less slavery-friendly president.		If you wish to (2) defend the technique of inferring design motives from consequences, I can offer no guidance.
I'm not claiming anything about your knowledge of arguments.		If you wish to (1) defend Dr. Amar's claim that the #ElectoralCollege protected slavery against my counterargument, name a presidential election, 1788-1860, in which the outcome would have changed for the better. https://t.co/ZEb0OSUXcL
@_varsha_venkat I have a doctorate on the mathematics of election systems. I wrote that Medium article. Read it, *then* decide what you want to argue against.
@_varsha_venkat (7) He's correct that the #ElectoralCollege is terrible, outdated, and needs to go. It's deeply flawed.		He's wrong, however, to conclude that skepticism of democracy wasn't an important factor and that slavery was in the adoption of the EC.
@_varsha_venkat (6) If you read the article credulously, you might infer that Madison proposed the #ElectoralCollege as a response to Wilson pushing a popular vote.		Wilson proposed an EC after his push for a PV failed. Then Madison got on board with EC and endorsed PV. The record is clear.
@_varsha_venkat (So if you want to judge by outcomes and fallaciously infer motives from outcomes, no, it didn't even have that outcome.)
@_varsha_venkat (5) As I pointed out above - read the article - when you look at who might have lost a direct election but won in the #ElectoralCollege prior to the Civil War, you have 1 definite (Adams II) and two other possibilities (Adams I and, if using a majority runoff, Lincoln).
@_varsha_venkat (4) Given the documentation available, slavery as a motive for the design of the #ElectoralCollege would have been most likely documented. It was certainly documented as a motivating factor in other roles.
@_varsha_venkat (3) Conjecturing a motive based on consequences is meaningless when you don't seem to even understand what the alternative was. The #ElectoralCollege was not proposed as an alternative to a popular vote, but to a Congressional vote (also affected by the 3/5ths Compromise).
@_varsha_venkat (2) Efforts to reform the system more thoroughly than the 12th Amendment did were underway both before and after the 12th Amendment was passed. Reform is very hard with the way the system works.
@_varsha_venkat I've seen that article before. It is unconvincing. In particular:		(1) Skepticism of democracy by many Framers during the CC is well-documented in Madison's notes. It does, in fact, "line up with the data."
@_varsha_venkat Those aren't the reasons it was invented. The actual reasons for the #ElectoralCollege are more banal; it was an exercise in expedient political sausage-making.		Slave state delegations were among the most resistant to adopting it (notably the Carolinas).		https://t.co/zm7k5hjeVW
Yep, the 1790s would have been a good choice. https://t.co/FRWAUqd9k5
@AlHen98 Building on (2), regionally divisive candidates have a structural advantage in the #ElectoralCollege system. This was visible in 1860; it was also visible a hundred years later, when Southern Democrats were trying to throw a wrench in the system (and very nearly succeeded).
@AlHen98 The #ElectoralCollege system as it currently exists, compared to a simple plurality election:		(1) Is no less "mob rule," with no more representation for minority viewpoints than a direct election.	 	(2) Was the proximate trigger for one civil war already.
@david_darmofal @sgadarian @cmMcConnaughy @jwamble25 South Carolina *is* an early-contest state.
@tracker1ne That's what's happening. The #ElectoralCollege squashes "the small voices." 		The main effect of the EC system on presidential campaigns is that presidential candidates ignore most of the country and campaign in a small fraction of states. Mostly larger states (e.g., Florida).
@NameNotPublic No, it most certainly does not. Past the expected election of @GenWaashington, the closest the system came to working as expected was in 1824.		https://t.co/jFOXygIJfR		The #ElectoralCollege was already in the unanticipated territory of accidental design by 1796.
@Gwtheyrn @VABVOX ... because once a candidate concedes or is no longer deemed viable, they stop receiving votes, but voters continue to add to the tally of the winner in later states.		Aggregate popular vote is even less meaningful when different states have different types of contest.
@Gwtheyrn @VABVOX On the Republican side, only 1 modern primary was "closer" by that metric - Reagan's 1976 challenge of Ford.		There have been closely contested Republican primaries, including in 2016.		The paper margins in a primary contest, though, are not very meaningful...
@Gwtheyrn @VABVOX By the historical benchmarks of actual presidential primaries, it was *not* a landslide. It was not clinched early, and the margin was not exceptional.		Of the 10 contested Democratic primaries using the modern system, 6 featured larger popular margins; 3 smaller.
@ashtonpittman I rather expect I would.
@ashtonpittman I am not convinced that making your identity a deliberate campaign message (e.g. "I'm With Her") ends up "neutraliz[ing] identity politics."		That seems rather more like doubling down and hoping you're not on the losing side of the resulting identity politics fight.
It's Sunday afternoon. What am I doing?		Sticking data in a spreadsheet to see how Hitler would have performed in a 1932 election in several alternate hypothetical scenarios with an #ElectoralCollege type system.
@CulturedModesty First, look at size *and length* of the funding package vs COL &amp; graduation times. Cut any with obvious net loss. If that leaves none, don't go. Maybe try again next year.		Second, look at job placement and likely advisors. Ideally, you want a good fallback choice for advisor.
RT @TexasTribune: 1/ You might be seeing headlines or tweets tonight that claim Texas says 58,000 non-citizens have voted in Texas. 		That…
@VABVOX He didn't get "non-stop positive press" (rather the opposite), and it wasn't a landslide. As primaries go, it was closer than most.		His support base is also fairly clear (socialists + anti-establishment outsiders), with a distinct niche.
In every single election in which the national popular vote margin has been smaller than the popular margin in one state, the #ElectoralCollege margin has also been within the electoral margin in one state.		The EC makes it likelier a single state is decisive.
@0bama_2012 This is all thanks to the #ElectoralCollege - in terms of raw national popular margin, NYC has had far fewer opportunities to be decisive.
@0bama_2012 As a historical point of order, New York City has had decisive influence over more presidential elections than all small states combined.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@0bama_2012 The #ElectoralCollege makes it *more* likely that a shift in a single major metro area, e.g., LA county, determines the outcome of the election.		Clinton's 2016 loss, for example, can be chalked up to a drop in performance in 3 major metropolitan areas compared to Obama in 2012. https://t.co/MOSMOcOSEO
@NateSilver538 I.e., if (B) Trump has a near-100% chance of loss in a pure two-candidate environment (not quite a true assumption , the #ElectoralCollege does weird things), any major shift due to a third party bid (C) could only have a favorable or neutral impact on Trump's chance.
@NateSilver538 I think the implicit reasoning is clear enough. 		(A) Trump has a "ceiling" of support below an outright majority.	(B) Therefore, any election that consolidates all anti-Trump sentiment behind one candidate is a losing election for Trump.	(C) A major third party bid is not (B).
@jackcurran49 (Honestly, nothing really ridiculous about biannual elections that happen on the same schedule as the federal ones.)
@jackcurran49 I think it's more ridiculous that most states elect governors in midterm years. It shields governors from accountability by sneaking them through in low-turnout years. (Odd year gubernatorial elections are even worse.)		Most states used to have biannual elections for governors.
(What I know about Samuel Miles thus far is mostly encapsulated here:		https://t.co/JRXnq0eiZG		It is honestly not very much.)
I keep reading reputable scholarly sources say that Samuel Miles violated a pledge to vote for Adams in 1796, but I don't see any citations to a source for him having *made* a pledge to support Adams - just the oft-repeated quote from a letter to the editor by an angry voter.
@jacobfhsmith @GabeTheCentrist Atlanta proper has a population of &lt;500,000. The Atlanta metro area has a population of &gt;5,000,000.		Similar deal with Boston. Those two have the 9th &amp; 10th largest metro areas in the country.
@siano2020 I had a typewriter with a working backspace key that used correction tape at one point. Pretty advanced model.		Mostly, you learned to type very precisely.
Just a routine reminder ... the #ElectoralCollege system really hasn't worked as intended, and it is overdue for replacement with a more modern election system.
Forcing people to work without pay on a continuing basis seems like it ought to be in violation of the 13th Amendment.
@anastasjoy @markos "Never underestimate white male confidence" is visibly a statement "about being a white male."
@markos Criticizing candidates for being white males seems an effective strategy if your goal is to be thought of as racist and sexist by more people, particularly moderates and conservatives.		I do not think it is an effective strategy for trying to elect a Democratic president in 2020.
@Noahpinion I'd say you pretty much need to transform the adjunct labor pool into the new professoriate in order to pull all of that off.
@smith_valence @pagalvin @RealSaavedra So that means ... 		... include race in the training data, thus identify effect of race on human  decisions and separate this from proxies, then turn race off in operating the algorithm?
@SenhorRaposa NC still had its loyal conservative Jessecrats willing to vote Democratic at the state level.		Such a dramatic shift.
@GrantrGregory @davidshor @gelliottmorris That's not to say that the effects found in the lab are fictitious, but that there are likely many effects of unclear strength in operation, adding up to the murkier (and sometimes nearly opposite) picture seen when looking at actual voting behavior in elections.
@GrantrGregory @davidshor @gelliottmorris The division is in terms of lab studies vs field studies. 		There are lab studies suggest particular biases against women voters under particular conditions / circumstances. 		Studies of results in the wild show small pro-female net bias or none.
@davidshor @gelliottmorris Taking that sentence at face value glosses over something like half of the literature I've seen on the topic - many studies show a bias in *favor* of female candidates (usually small and often not very robust vs controls). E.g.:		https://t.co/JVNGpBDtfz

@deray I have used two libraries in 2019 so far. It's January 17th and I haven't done much traveling yet.
@sarion_gamer I don't get why he has the apparent power to block a supermajority of senators from forcing the issue to a vote.
@boboncvn70 @DrTandtheLg @AOC A veto hasn't happened yet. One is threatened, but that's not quite the same thing.
Is this truly significant from a statistical perspective? Not so much, because n is small; but what I see routinely (and I'm seeing it right now in the book I'm reading) is a poorly-evidenced claim that the EC forces candidates to appeal broadly to the entire country.
Stephen Douglas in 1860 is probably a more striking example. He received the second-largest number of votes, roughly as much (depending on how you count up the fusion votes) as Bell and Breckinridge combined; but placed a distant fourth in the EC.
Once you do this, it seems the EC system has favored more polarizing candidates with a narrower base of support. Strom Thurmond came close to forcing negotiations in a House contingent election in 1948 with 2.4%; Ross Perot was shut out completely in 1992 with 18.9%.
Because most presidential elections in the US only include two major candidates, testing if "broad" or "narrow" support improves a candidate's performance in the #ElectoralCollege requires looking at races with 3+ major candidates. 80% is just as polarized an outcome as 20%.
Reading one of what someone seemed to indicate was a "standard work" on the #ElectoralCollege. Chapter 2 consists of largely mathematically incoherent narrative-building.
@Robillard @wpjenna See, when I read that quote, I note the word "empire," recall that almost no American politician uses the word positively, and see a very different reading.		I also am very curious what's been hidden under the ellipsis.

@nirvanafanclub @NateSilver538 The plain fact that Gillibrand was the first senator to publicly turn on Franken makes her the visible leader of the move to push Franken out, as opposed to going through the official procedure of an ethics investigation.		Thinking her responsible is not much of a stretch.
@nirvanafanclub @NateSilver538 There is no reading of the publicly available facts that supports claiming that Franken "turned tail and ran" out of unwillingness to submit himself to an ethics investigation.		Dem Senators, starting with Gillibrand, publicly turned on him and *that* pushed him out.

@graveyjones5 @Jacket_Spangler @aseemru @alexburnsNYT Also noteworthy in that poll is that he stood at +20% net approval among women (57% approve, 37% disapprove).		"Immediate" resignation (i.e., finalized within a week) is pretty much what happened and what Gillibrand positioned herself in favor of.
@graveyjones5 @Jacket_Spangler @aseemru @alexburnsNYT https://t.co/3in1xKaYxr		50% of Minnesotans (71% of Ds) opposed his resignation vs 42% in favor,  with 35% for immediate vs 60% for a complete ethics investigation.		That was 3 weeks after he said he was going to resign, and a week before it was finalized.
@graveyjones5 @Jacket_Spangler @aseemru @alexburnsNYT If you're looking for someone to be the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose Minnesota since McGovern in 1972, Gillibrand is clearly the best pick for that; Clinton won the state by only 1.5 points in 2016 and most Minnesotans didn't want Franken to resign.
@graveyjones5 @Jacket_Spangler @aseemru @alexburnsNYT I think you underestimate the degree to which people remember public figures doing something they didn't like, and the very existence of all the Twitter responses @aseemru is referring to backs that up.
@graveyjones5 @Jacket_Spangler @aseemru @alexburnsNYT That's inaccurate. Al Franken had a lot of national visibility before he launched his Senate run thanks to his background as a comedian. He was the sort to attract presidential-ambitions chatter:		https://t.co/LTOdoDl2sR	https://t.co/2A53NzAEho

@GabeTheCentrist @NateSilver538 There are several ways, mathematically, to measure the differences b/w the tipping point probability and the appearance share.		The L1 metric (sum of absolute differences) is 47.2 (Clinton) vs 28.2 (Trump). The L2 metric (sqrt of sum of squares) is 14.2 (Clinton) vs 8.7 (Trump).

It's true that many presidents (16) have been senators sometime before becoming president.		It's also true that only 3 sitting senators have won a presidential election - Harding (1920), Kennedy (1960), and Obama (2008).
Happy New Year! Time to go for a run!
@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa Senators are often candidates, but historically, not many of them make it into office directly from the Senate. (Sort the below list by "Previous 1" to see. Obama was a rare exception.)		https://t.co/4mOOaDEmdq
@mjdawidowicz @politicsluo Spot on. These are related on several levels, too.		Visible minority groups appearing to do well can fuel acts of violence - true for pogroms in Poland, true for the uprisings in Tulsa (1921) and Wilmington (1898) involving burning out a newly prosperous class of urban blacks.
I suppose it's time to start putting off procrastination until later.		I mean, really, I can procrastinate at any time, why bother to do it now?
@mnemosyneous Given that only around 1/4 of states actually benefit from it, that should theoretically not be a major obstacle, but belief in a benefit is as good as an actual benefit for that purpose.
@mnemosyneous Constitutional amendment would do the trick. Needs enough people behind that to happen.		Short term, I'm still hopeful for #NPVIC to serve as a bandaid.
Just a reminder... we still have an #ElectoralCollege. This should change at some point. Sooner is better than later.
@politicsluo (FWIW, "Do you support overturning Roe v. Wade?" may very well be the single most functional political litmus test in the modern US, for both sides of the issue.)
@politicsluo Candidate B's support for abortion rights just barely passes the litmus test (e.g., supports making abortion as inconvenient as possible short of overturning Roe v. Wade) as do their positions on the other three issues.		Bright line tests don't handle tough trade-offs well.
@politicsluo Candidate A wants to overturn Roe v. Wade (failing the litmus test) but is Teddy Roosevelt with a Norwegian social service support badge on the other issues.		Potentially awesome candidate, in other words, aside from that one issue.
@politicsluo Here's a simplified example. 		Let's say you have 2 viable Democratic candidates for state senator in your district, A and B, and you're a Democrat in a conservative district. You want support for Obamacare, legal abortion, progressive taxation, and environmental regs.
@politicsluo (More than half the time. And even then you'll sometimes fail to find one.)		If you're using multiple litmus tests, you need them to be really easy ones to pass - and the binary pass / fail nature of litmus tests can lead to a bad decision.
@politicsluo Let's say you care about 4 independent issues, and there's a p=0.5 chance for a candidate of some party passing your litmus test on each issue. You need more than n=10 candidates to look for in order to find a single suitable one.
@politicsluo E.g., "Is this person too right wing?" isn't really a litmus test. "Does this person support overturning Roe v. Wade?" is a litmus test (simple screen, non-trivial pass / fail probabilities).		Once you have many issues you care about, litmus tests are tricky.
@politicsluo I'd say the idea of a litmus test isn't that you have standards in an abstract sense, but rather, that you have a simple and easy-to-apply test that is at the same time meaningful in screening out candidates.
@AndyLuttrell5 @StuartJRitchie That and worse. 		I once knew a grad student who considered "throwing numbers in" to be a required but largely meaningless ritual she had to go through in order to get her papers published. 		She went on to a postdoc at a very prestigious school.
@davidshor @jacksantucci @MattGrossmann Why? FPTP is risky for both; it is a more chaotic translation of popularity to seats.		If you have FPTP, then depending on the fine details of what's going on politically at the moment, centrists or leftists (even both) *could* lose out by narrow pluralities across the board.
@davidshor @dylanmatt So... specifically... like UK / US zones? https://t.co/jrlbPavvNm
@bwolman @davidsirota Maybe that means I think of myself as particularly gullible by nature, but I do think that means that while there are many facts in the article, they are framed in a way that is potentially misleading. (2/2)
@bwolman @davidsirota In my case, I find his article disagreeable because if I had read the article credulously without checking facts and context, it would have left me with a very different impression of Beto O'Rourke than I do now after checking facts and context. 		(1/2)
@MichaelHeister @bwolman @davidsirota ... and unless the Democrats nominate someone significantly to the right of O'Rourke, it's likely that a Democratic president would sign anything that manages to get through Congress.		I don't think Obama was the limiting factor on health care reform.
@MichaelHeister @bwolman @davidsirota *All* the Democratic hopefuls are going to do some positioning and repositioning on those. I can remember how Edwards seemed to really force the major candidates to position themselves and make promises on health care reform.		What's deliverable will depend mostly on Congress...
@MichaelHeister @bwolman @davidsirota Well, for specific issues, you can look more directly at those issues rather than overall voting record by proxy. He ran in favor of "some kind" of universal health care system. He's not one of the House Dems to endorse the #GreenNewDeal (yet), though LCV likes him. My read?
@MichaelHeister @davidsirota I'm not saying he should be given a bye. I'm saying that the "TX argument" is a valid response to what Sirota wrote (attached).		The fact that the lean of Beto's district shows up in Sirota's argument means that the lean of TX-statewide is a valid counterpoint to make. https://t.co/7RipCYWZNe
@bwolman If you're sorting your Democrats out into discrete "conservative," "centrist," and "progressive" piles, definitely goes in the "centrist" pile. If you want to quantify a mix, you might say he's around 2/3 NDC and 1/3 CPC.
That would apply to his record in the 113th and 114th as well.		I'm pretty sure that one can find multiple conservative Democratic legislators this is *not* true for, i.e., that are closer to the more moderate Republicans than to the most progressive Democrats.
By most measures I can think of inventing, the difference in voting record between Beto and the most progressive Republican in the 115th seems larger than the difference between Beto and any more progressive Democratic in the 115th.
There's nothing really exceptional about any of this. Beto's voting record seems pretty ordinary. He breaks to the right of the party slightly more often than to the left of the party, but he does both, and like most Democrats, those breaks from the party are rare.
Very few of those votes (13) involve him breaking with both Cartwright and Connolly, and he's usually voting with a significant number of Democrats. Like other measures, this look shows him staying inside the pack a lot, tending slightly right of the center of the party.
I'm presuming that the caucus whips generally serve as a proxy for the way the caucus aligns. This is an imperfect approximation, but it seems like a reasonable first guess.		Here are his patterns of dissent based on this method. https://t.co/ZnFUwowWgR
The CPC is the progressive caucus of Democrats, the NDC is the centrist caucus of Democrats, basically. As a convenient first-pass to identify dissents, I looked at votes differing from the reps identified as the caucus whips.		https://t.co/LAIve3KnYR	https://t.co/KzTtgybpKu
So, after some discussion with @bwolman about @davidsirota 's article on Beto's voting record, I've decided to do a little bit of CPC / NDC oriented analysis.		Beto's voting record agrees 90+% with many other key Democrats, so the interesting parts are votes where he disagrees.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota Yes, it is of limited value. 		The prediction curve used by 538 is not linear and not adjusting predictions for partisan ID of lawmakers, which gives systematic errors in the predictions vs the trump scores. (Both parties show linear relationships, but different lines.)
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota If you count in the procedural votes, his record in 115th more closely matches the CPC whip than the NDC whip. If you restrict to major votes, the opposite is true.		I'm not done analyzing record vs the caucus whips.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota As a proxy for the caucus, I'll take the two caucus whips' voting records.		https://t.co/KzTtgybpKu	https://t.co/LAIve3KnYR		Computing :)
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota Especially if we want to talk about representativeness.		Beto voted with the Trump agenda roughly 30% of the time; roughly 30% of his constituents voted for Trump. 		The "predicted score" is not about representativeness.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota It's expected that someone running for statewide office may be closer to a competitive position for their state than at the lean predicted by district.		Mind, there are some particular issues with the model used for predicted Trumpishness by DL. We can go into the weeds on that.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota Compared to a Republican, he is very progressive indeed. Compared to a Blue Dog Democrat, he's progressive. Compared to Bernie Sanders, he isn't.		Compared to the crowd of Democratic presidential hopefuls, he's somewhere near the middle of the pack.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota If you read the piece at face value, the framing of "frequently," "many," et cetera obscure that piece of rather important context. One can just as easily say he has "many" dissents that are not conservative dissents.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota As far as cause and effect, no, we can't really disentangle.		He's a "New Democrat," yes, and that's the more centrist caucus. But the NDC is barely smaller than the CPC. That's a mainstream branch of the party. He isn't a Blue Dog either officially or by proximate voting record.
@bwolman @MichaelHeister @davidsirota Sirota points out that Beto is in a safe district in order to argue he is more Trumpish than predicted by decisions to cater to constituency. (As in attached quote.)		In the context of someone planning to run for statewide office, however, the related constituency is TX. https://t.co/kKEPbjeXKQ
@MichaelHeister @davidsirota Same with the "Trump 30%" figure. Tied to procedural votes, above average but not an outlier among Democrats by any means (even Democrats with presidential ambitions).
@MichaelHeister @davidsirota Pointedly, Beto voted against his party *less* often than the average Democrat in the 113th and 114th. And if you look at the numbers, rather than the percentiles, "top 20%" is already in the thick part of the curve - less than 0.5 SDs from the mean. It's not a normal distrib.
@MichaelHeister @davidsirota Here is a pointed example of misleading frame. After spending a while talking about "167 votes" and a six year record, Sirota says Beto ranked in top 5th voting against party in the last 2 years, omitting the other 2/3 of that record (below average, also not running for TX-Sen.) https://t.co/BX3hE7Affq
@MichaelHeister @davidsirota The "TX argument" is not BS, because unlike most representatives, he was running for statewide office. 		As far as stats, procedural votes are what pad the numbers Sirota is plugging - 30% Trump. 		Beto's voting record is not an outlier among Democrats by any measure I've seen.
@JMilesColeman I think a key to successfully communicating that result via maps is going to involve a shading based on either population density or just plain population.
No quantitative measure I've seen puts Beto anywhere near overlapping with the least conservative Republican in Congress. 		If you anonymized his voting record and compared it to the other House members, you would have no trouble determining his party  IDcorrectly. https://t.co/q6diuWCDI3
@ForecasterEnten Higher share of the vote? Not nationally meaningful. Compare Cook PVI (2016) vs margin (2018) for relative performance. An 0.2% margin difference is not that impressive when there's a 3 point PVI difference in the baselines.		Much more importantly, she's said she's not running.
@ElectionBabe Well, I'm none of those! 😅 Didn't think I was that unusual.		I even know some people who take it a step further and maintain a stockpile of likely gifts indefinitely.
@ElectionBabe Voters who move often (e.g., college students moving seasonally) can't even register to vote in the appropriate location until they move there - often in August or sometimes even September. 		Students in student housing + 30 day reg deadline usually adds up to &lt;62 day window.
@ElectionBabe I can't really agree with that comparison.		You can do gift-shopping in advance at any point. You usually know who you're buying for a year ahead of time. Voters can't even know who will be on the ballot in a general election until a few months before.
@david_darmofal By the time we get to Nevada, precedent suggests at most 5-6 candidates will be taken seriously. It's also unlikely that Nevada + South Carolina *combined* will trim the field down below 3 candidates.		Maybe this year will break new ground.
@david_darmofal There are an enormous number of people trying to compete for the Democratic candidacy. The field will narrow *very* quickly. Probably half the field will be effectively eliminated after Iowa, and half the remainder after New Hampshire.

@OsitaNwanevu Booker and Harris aren't portraying themselves as particularly centrist.		Beto losing Texas against an incumbent Republican senator by 1.6% positively screams "electable centrist."		Centrists also (in apparent contrast to Klion) don't see "white man" as a drawback in a candidate.

@diamondsnjeans @FlowersAreR3d @LeftwardSwing (If we use the current figures.)
@diamondsnjeans @FlowersAreR3d @LeftwardSwing When it comes to the House vote, it *does* have to be someone who placed in the top 3 of the #ElectoralCollege vote, so the House's options are limited.		It's also by state delegation, so that's a 29-19 Republican House w/2 split delegations.
@aseemru Oh, right, I forgot Gillibrand. (Big field, sorry.) She's not very Trumpward in her voting record, but like the others in that category who aren't Sanders, low net approval nationally.
@aseemru ... so if you want a less-Trumpward record on a current Congressional Dem, that's Sanders (deep negatives with party insiders), someone with low net approval nationally (Booker, Harris, Warren), or someone low profile (ones I don't know are on the radar).
@aseemru 30%, in context, isn't really that much. It puts him firmly anti-Trumpward of the entire Republican caucus and close to the middle of the Democratic pack.		If you look at the top 8 D-Sens likely to pursue a WH bid, he'd be just under 4 of them (Tester, Kaine, Brown, Klobuchar)...
@diamondsnjeans @LeftwardSwing @FlowersAreR3d That depends on how crazy things get. When you get a 3-4 candidate split, it's possible to win an outright #ElectoralCollege majority with &lt;40% of the popular vote.		https://t.co/YfybSkgjqZ

@gflack @bryan_caplan The Nazis were not dispassionate detached emotionless types. Nor are modern neo-Nazis who seek to emulate Nazis particularly dispassionate, either. 		I'm not saying that, say, Winston Churchill was a robot, but pretending the Nazis were calm and dispassionate is right out. (2/3)
@gflack @bryan_caplan Hitler was not noted for being calm and dispassionate, but rather for his highly emotional and charismatic rhetoric.		Even drilling down to related inspiring intellectuals, you're hitting lots of emotive figures like Nietzsche, who spasmodically orgasmed all over the page. (1/)
... I'm not buying the narrative, circulating widely, that Sanders just can't connect with non-white voters.

Numbers for white respondents:		Sanders +5%, 1.1	Biden +21%, 1.6	Warren -7%, 0.8	Harris -4%, 0.8	Booker -2%, 0.9	O'Rourke +8%, 1.4
Unlike the non-representative sample of donors / activists I've seen circulated on Twitter recently, this is an actual poll. Net favorables &amp; ratios among non-white respondents:		Sanders +35%, 2.5	Biden +34%, 2.5	Warren +7%,  1.3	Harris +16%, 3.0	Booker +4%, 1.2	O'Rourke +9%, 1.9 https://t.co/zPRelTWZ8J

@frakincaprica @davidsirota Klobuchar, Brown, Kaine, and Tester have similarly Trump-agreeable voting records in Congress. 		However, Harris, Booker, Warren, and Sanders voted with Trump significantly less often. 		I'd call both of those important pieces of missing context.

@kenner116 @VaPoliticalMeme New Jersey has long had notorious corruption problems. Locals may be accustomed to it, but it's really evident to people visiting from out of state.		As a pointed demonstration of the effect of off-year elections, voter turnout in the last NJ gubernatorial election was 35%.
@ForecasterEnten That article is based on a meaningless poll, given the non-random sample of something that isn't really a representative body. You know too much about polling to be one of the people pushing this article.
@Clarknt67 @ClaraJeffery Thank you for pointing out that this is *not* a representative survey of the population, as Clara's tweet seemed to imply, but instead a non-random sampling of a very narrow group.		This is not a meaningful poll of the voting population.
@poliscibitches @gin_and_tacos The death penalty one talks a bit about the overlap a little bit re: combination rape+murder cases (rape + murder = death sentence is a common pattern, controlling for this reduces the gap), but the other one doesn't isolate sex crimes from all other crimes.		Might, perhaps.
@BradJChester "Too many offices" is another side of the voter fatigue problem (and mostly due to local elecs). It does get harder for voters to figure out a ballot at that point.		VA's legislatures + statewides (3) + federal offices is at most 8 at once, and I'd say that's not overload at all.
@davidsirota It was a strategy that worked very well in 2016 *to win the Democratic primary*, which is why I rather suspect we'll keep seeing it.		Does seem like it comes with something of a liability when it comes to the general election, though.

Caveat #3: Within the "15th Amendment" era, you can really see a time series trend where turnout is dropping over time. This is thanks to a long-term decline in turnout in the South (i.e., Jim Crow).
So, for example, for comparing recent presidential candidates, as in the @Amy_Siskind tweet announcing that Hillary Clinton got more votes than any white male Democrat, you'd want to stay within the post-26th era. https://t.co/Zdi7I1S1rA
Caveat #2: Who is allowed to vote has varied over time. The last column points to the era in terms of electoral franchise. E.g., 1789-1824 saw many presidential electors appointed, not elected. Numbers from different eras mean fundamentally different things.
Caveat #1: All the caveats you find on https://t.co/aAuusYsaNU apply, since that's where I got turnout figures. There are some rounding effects on the 0.1% level (I wouldn't expect them to be more accurate than that anyway, especially for older eras).
The bigger picture of what I tweeted previously - presidential candidates in the context of "how good they were at getting votes," as @nalanpog wanted to see.

@nalanpog Obama '08 a little higher than Bush II '04 - 32.6%. Still under a third.		Reagan's '84 landslide doesn't even crack the 1/3 mark. To get past the 1/3 mark requires going all the way back to 1964. https://t.co/UTuGfpHV3Z

@prof_nch Every paper I work on turns into two papers.
@ArabellaTrefoil @reesetheone1 I don't think Democrats will *nominate* a "two white guys" ticket, but for reasons particular to the primary (and Democratic party).		I doubt the Democratic primary electorate will be more pro-white-men-candidates than the general electorate. The opposite seems more likely. (2/2)
@ArabellaTrefoil @reesetheone1 If Trump is dumped by the Republican party in the primary elections, there will necessarily be ample warning before the primaries are finished.		I don't see a good reason why Democrats should be concerned about the electability of a "two white guys" ticket. (1/2)
@il_american @SenhorRaposa I should object to the implicit assertion that Burr will be re-elected indefinitely, but the last time a senior senator lost a bid for a 3rd+ term in NC was ... uh ... 1930. 😅

@EricLevitsky @uprinfl @barmore27 To calculate the "extra" votes coming from CA:		2016, CA votes for president as % of eligible voters: 56.5%	2016, US votes for president as % of eligible voters: 59.2%		That's not millions of extra votes. That's almost a million *fewer* votes.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa I look forward to reading your essay, then. (You might want to post it on a blog in one piece. Twitter is terrible for this sort of thing.)
@Number_Keeper That would only very marginally improve the degree to which the #ElectoralCollege resembles a popular vote, though.		It would still be chaotic, still focus on battleground states, and the system would still be vulnerable to unusual events. 		OTOH, huge impact on the #Senate.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Snap answer. Jumping in the middle of a sentence again. 		You want to prove that structural reform in America now only works via ballot measure, unlike as in the previous couple centuries and change, start building that argument directly. That is a very bold thesis to prove.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Another snap answer. When jumping into the middle of a sentence, you might want to wait. 		California in 2008 is relevant. New York in 1826 is relevant. History is relevant. You can boldly assert we are in totally unprecedented territory, but that's usually wrong.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa ... and at the end of the day, Republican voters like gerrymandering little more than Democratic voters.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa ... or, in other words, there's little reason to expect that going backwards on gerrymandering will result in eventually going forward on gerrymandering.		OTOH, we have every reason to believe that going forwards on gerrymandering leads to less gerrymandering...
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa ... you prioritize Democratic control over fair processes now, there's little reason to expect that priority will ever stop being relevant.		Or to expect that Democrats, after embracing "temporary" tactical gerrymandering, will simply readily abandon it...
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa ... lack of alternatives.		There are alternatives to "Have Democrats gerrymander back until Democrats are in control." 		Those alternatives get harder when Democrats are urging "tit for tat" gerrymandering in blue states. There's also no real end game, for a simple reason: If ...
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa There was nothing my answer that referred to my original "Or..." that referred to ballot measures being essential to engaging in political activism on the statewide level. This is hard work. 		Your original central point,  "Democrats should gerrymander," was predicated on a ...
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa No, not a snap answer. Again, "of 2008."		I was speaking of a historical frame of reference. This is where one goes back and considers a situation that happened in the past analogous to a modern situation. Just because you want to ignore history doesn't mean I will.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa You're the one who makes snap answers here. Don't try to project that back on me.		There's a reason I reply to these slowly. California was not already solved in 2008. Politicians' positions are not fixed and immutable objects. Look at the historical analogues.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa That question is not particularly meaningful given that I do not accept its premises.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa "Of 2008." 		Step back and rewind your framing. History doesn't repeat itself exactly, but it tends to rhyme. 		Conversely, asserting boldly and baldly that we are in a position without precedent regarding traditional methods of pushing for structural reforms is a poor argument.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Republicans don't have the option of blocking reform and facing no consequences from it. 		On the latter, that was the era of King Caucus. Today, insurgents can and do make primary runs and grab party noms. And nobody will even challenge you to an illegal duel.		So again, no.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa There are Rs who think the same way. Or other variations on the theme.		Yes, right now, nationally, Rs benefit more from gerrymandering. Significantly more. That doesn't mean that R voters think gerrymandering is great. 		https://t.co/ncSZQZzbbz
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Tell that to Nancy Pelosi and the California Democratic Party of 2008. 		Or you, now. Some Dems with strong partisan loyalty think gerrymandering pro-Dem is worthwhile to gain Dem advantage. After all, the Republicans do it, so it's okay to do it back.
@konrad_jeff @paulkrugman There's a disconnect between "urban" and urban, and "rural" and rural. Census definition of "urban" includes all towns over 2500.		The big open question is whether suburbanization (now including remote-work exurbanization to small towns in rural areas) is dead or not.
The article linked doesn't even mention rural Vermont's effort to bring in telecommuters.		I don't think the evidence is clear. Changes are happening rapidly, good internet is still hard to come by in many rural areas, and economic pressure to scatter is still rising. https://t.co/JViIrvZzCr
@DugginsBetsey @IrPsych Been kicking around a lot of different parts of the US. Don't hear Deidre often, but when I have, it's been -druh or -drah.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Another bad snap answer from not reading, then. 		You said "structures and incentives." There were factions that had more to lose by the popularization of the Electoral College than the Republicans of today do by losing gerrymandering.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa No. Ask partisan Republican voters - and not so partisan Republican-voting independent voters, and Democratic voters - to support insuring fair, compact, competitive, and contiguous districts. 		This has the effect of giving Democrats more power in some states.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Late 1700s to early 1800s, and there were less democratic factions afoot than the modern Republicans, so no.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa To draw on a historical example: Why would any state legislature choose to give up the power to appoint presidential electors directly?		Why did they all (except for South Carolina, which was special) eventually do so?
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Describe to me the leverage that celebrities, other politicians, voters, leaders, donors, et cetera have over state legislators in any state...		... now take a step back and look twice. Think "convince," not "coerce." 		If you want "coerce," that'll require a federal approach.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa I didn't say it was easy.		Structural reform is never easy.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Let's start with what I already told you:		"Go to Alabama, get your hands dirty, talk to people about fairness. Petition and lobby."		Now. Who do you "talk to?" 		Everybody you can. Voters, leaders, celebrities, the works. 		Who do you "lobby?" State legislators and governor.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Again, that snap reply is answered elsewhere.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Recommend you don't reply to multi-part answers with a snap answer partway through. I brought that up in the third part.		The *processes* for reform are different in every state. The details are different in every state. At the end of the day, though, reforms are possible.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa The hardest part of that scenario would probably be getting it *to* voters in the first place. In CA, you can bypass the legislature entirely fairly easily compared to how things work in other states. I suspect ballot initiatives are not as easy in AL.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa ... it would very much depend on details and who could be convinced to back the campaign. Race is the wild card, especially because right now, partisan gerrymandering goes hand in hand with creating majority-minority districts that pack in African-American voters.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Given that redistricting reform passed in Utah this year during a cycle where Republican media were pushing a narrative that independent redistricting commissions are crooked and secretly under Democratic control, my guess would be 55%.		Completely not an expert on AL, but ...
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Here's your third "or." 		Go to Alabama, get your hands dirty, talk to people about fairness. Petition and lobby.		Proposition 11 passed in CA over the objections of the Democratic Party and the backing of key Republicans. Not many voters of any stripe like gerrymandering.
@AsInMarx @DrewVanDrese @KarandikarAkhil @SenhorRaposa Unless you make clear fair standards that can command strong support from the voting public and become popularized nationwide. Or pass federal legislation that puts pressure on states to adopt fair districting. Or...
@Dazzlino @realDonaldTrump @TIME The last time the #ElectoralCollege worked the way it was intended to was in 1792. And that only because they expected @GenWaashington to be a special case and win easy election. 		https://t.co/68qKmBAr8M
@AnonymooseGuy @lifesafeast @tribelaw To be fair, @HamiltonElector really tried - and part of the difficulty they faced was that many states effectively coerce electors into voting as pledged.		The original intentions have been thoroughly gutted.

Two years from today, the separate assemblies of the #ElectoralCollege will convene in their various states to decide the next president. 		The outcome of their vote will most likely be predictable, but weird things could happen.
@SenhorRaposa An argument can be made that one just *did* backfire. The current map was drawn by Republicans and voted in 7-6 on party lines; some argued it was a gerrymander at the time, and the 2018 results are what you expect if a wave bigger than the safety margin hits a gerrymander.

@QueenMab87 Although on the "missing the point" trail, there might be a lot that can be done by throwing money at early childhood education. 		I'm just dubious about throwing money at K-12, and pretty confident that the classed nature of college is strongly tied to its costs.
@QueenMab87 Stronger baseline standards could also improve the quality of education. Speaking from the math ed perspective, many universities spend a lot of resources on remedial education.		It is an expensive item, though, unless sweeping reforms are made to how universities are run.
@QueenMab87 If you hold the pool of spots available for students fixed (for budget reasons, it's unlikely to increase) and remove cost from the equation, that means that the increased access for lower SES pushes out some middle and upper SES students who are not as good students.
@QueenMab87 (IMO, but what do I know? I've only worked in both levels a few years.)		There are people who can't afford college who are as academically prepared as those who can. Free college means they could go.		Conversely, middle class students who can afford college would have to compete.
@QueenMab87 Improving K-12 education requires changes other than throwing money at the problem. (Rather like health care; we spend through the nose already.)		The cost of college to students is the main reason why it's not much of a force for SES mobility. There are dual factors for this.
@Jak_Riemer @DemRedistrict @EricHolder Population growth meant it had to be split up in the 2010 mapping cycle. The more rural part of of the district went into CA-8, which is one of the few remaining red districts. The very rural Nevada border no longer shares a district with parts of LA county.
@Jak_Riemer @DemRedistrict @EricHolder Attached is the old CA-25 map and the new one. It always scooped into LA county (note Santa Clarita's position on the two maps).		CA-25 stayed red after redistricting (2012, 2014, and 2016 elections). Trump is unpopular in CA's suburbs. https://t.co/wesogF1pXn
@Noahpinion California has kind of bad voter turnout. Below the national average as a percentage of the eligible population (i.e., even after discounting the immigrants who can't vote).		In order for there to be millions of fakes... CA would need record-low actual turnout.
@Noahpinion I'm hearing a lot of the "Take California and New York out and ..." rhetoric right now.		Probably the most pernicious variation is saying that California Democrats are inventing millions of votes out of thin air.
Somehow missed the WI actual house count. Also, here's 2018. https://t.co/rsTWX93ot6
NJ had a 5 point swing, which is bigger than most people expect when drawing a map. The goal of #gerrymandering is to win safe-but-narrowly (e.g., 55%-45%) but lose big (like 20%-80%).		A too-efficient gerrymander hitting a wave election can flip catastrophically like that.
If you look at the New Jersey row here, you can see something interesting.		In 2012, NJ's commission voted a map in 7-6 on party lines. It was described as a Republican gerrymander. 		The fact that it flipped in 2018 is actually evidence in favor of it being a #gerrymander (1/2) https://t.co/GcTvGMpE7E
@Jak_Riemer @DemRedistrict @EricHolder 2018 stats don't paint much of a different picture when it comes to California.

@quaid16 @GovernorTomWolf It worked out pretty closely to how you would expect fair single-member districts to work out when you earn &lt;40% of the vote in statewide races.		Without a #ProportionalRepresentation system, the minority party usually earns disproportionately few seats.
@Jak_Riemer @DemRedistrict @EricHolder If you look at the big picture, the CA maps look pretty fair. There just isn't a way for a minority party to get many seats with single-member first-past-the-post districts. #ProportionalRepresentation.		Attached, 2012 House results for states with &gt;5 reps, right after new maps. https://t.co/wEYjOYsh1V
@repvos They're the ones calling for the entire country to adopt #ProportionalRepresentation. 		For single-member districts, FPTP, each 1% past 50% often gets you close to 2% with fair districting. For 66% of the total vote, getting 82% of seats, (66/80) would be not at all unusual.

@il_american @BMcM2018 @SenhorRaposa Republicans lost very little ground with the 2010 map. Yes, some Republicans screamed foul. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't.

@jp_bolo4jp @NelleBelle1967 1968 and 1992 are interesting as 3-candidate elections. The pair of them show that having broadly distributed support across the country (Perot) is worse under the #ElectoralCollege than having narrow support in a region (Wallace).
@jp_bolo4jp @NelleBelle1967 You have that backwards. The #ElectoralCollege makes it more likely that a tiny little shift in a few big cities is decisive. (See 2016 for a recent example. "Wayne county" is of course Detroit.)		Historically, NYC decided a lot of elections.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E https://t.co/WVi76RCpWN
@jp_bolo4jp @NelleBelle1967 I know how and why the #ElectoralCollege was designed ...		... this was not brilliance, it was a mistake, partly driven by necessary compromises and mostly just a failed experiment.
@jp_bolo4jp @NelleBelle1967 No, because it (A) doesn't do anything it was supposed to do, (B) functions largely as a more chaotic (thus inferior) version of a simple plurality vote, and (C) wasn't really supposed to do anything particularly good in the first place in contrast to a popular vote of some kind.
@jp_bolo4jp @NelleBelle1967 The genius of the #ElectoralCollege is failing to work the way it was intended to work?
Small-n, but also in the "this seems obviously true" pile for a lot of us who have run around in the academic job market and rubbed elbows with a lot of scholars with relatively newly minted doctorates.		https://t.co/q99G2NcggO		And depressing. Let's not forget depressing.
@jp_bolo4jp @NelleBelle1967 It didn't work as intended. Trump's base of support were the hoi polloi. No #ElectoralCollege composed of wise political insiders making their own decisions freely would have chosen him.
@jkellybrown @allnullandvoid @PaulBegala @TeamPelosi @repbenraylujan @dccc @HouseMajPAC The #ElectoralCollege is chaotic and doesn't really do anything useful. It basically just takes the popular vote and randomizes it a little bit.
@EricLevitsky @MikeC1163 It was not a landslide. It was a squeaker. Within the margin of a little movement in a few metro areas.		Trump got 304 out of 538 electoral votes. Truman, in 1948, got 303 out of 531 electoral votes, in an election that was very famously close. https://t.co/13uG2ekMly

@Bradsjunk @TasteeW @Catsjustinspac1 @ebruenig @MattBruenig 2016 was a very narrow loss for her by the #ElectoralCollege system. (Crazy and chaotic that it is, it does not take much to tip it.)		There are many small things that could have led to a Clinton win.
@polisciguy2011 @SenhorRaposa Weird and funny, because in 1790, Rhode Island was the most urbanized state. Almost 20% of the population lived in Providence or Newport. (NYC was less than 10% of the population of NYS.)		Today, 230 years later, almost 20% of the population of RI lives in Providence or Newport..
@ebruenig Personally, I think two "big enough" factors were the self-defeating prophecy of her inevitable victory (less enthusiastic Dems felt safe staying home) and the way that her supporters attacked other Democratic voters as being racist and sexist "Berniebros."
@ebruenig In 2016, the Democratic candidate won significantly more votes for president. 		There just happened to be enough little fluctuations in the right places for the #ElectoralCollege to get weird. It was the kind of election that could have been decided by Midwestern weather.
@andrewdamitio At a minimum, I think Chicago wouldn't have ended up in Illinois.		I think PR's example shows us the likely difficulties with the Southern proposals for annexation of territories with significant existing populations, though.

No. See the whole e-mail scandal that wouldn't have been a scandal if the DNC hadn't tried to stack the deck.		3. The use of "Berniebros" to slur and stereotype is alienating. See #1.
@TasteeW @Catsjustinspac1 @ebruenig @MattBruenig It is as much "opinion" as your claim about Sanders's "failure to fully support the candidate."		He checked all the standard boxes. The alienation had other causes.
@TasteeW @Catsjustinspac1 @ebruenig @MattBruenig You want to pick causes, that should be #1.		You want to fish for a #2 cause? Look at the DNC / "the establishment" being blatantly unfair and trying to stack the deck.		How about a #3? Look at the VP pick. VP picks are major opportunities for reconciliation.
@TasteeW @Catsjustinspac1 @ebruenig @MattBruenig Well, I'd say I was right ahead of time.		It is quite clear that Clinton supporters attacked Sanders supporters viciously during the primary. This, more than anything about what Sanders did or didn't do, was why there was "visible dissent," a "damaged party," etc.
@TasteeW @Catsjustinspac1 @ebruenig @MattBruenig Around January of 2016, I pointed out that Clinton supporters, including many prominent ones, were crossing over an important line: Attacking other *Democratic voters* rather than just attacking other *Democratic candidates*, and that it would alienate Sanders's supporters.

@AsInMarx At least, none of the others you've brought up on a similar profile (young governors, not scandal-laden) appear to "have more support, funding, and establishment figures in their wing."
@AsInMarx I said "Those are some pretty good fundamentals that are hard to match," not that they were unique. You said he "offers nothing that can't be found elsewhere in a candidate that doesn't already have more support, funding, and establishment figures in their wing."		Which is wrong.
@AsInMarx And I've told you several times now that a current governor with similar experience should be considered to have as strong fundamentals.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa I think we can safely omit the 2012 Democratic primary as essentially uncontested.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa I'd say a sitting governor is likely as good as a fundamental for a candidate, provided you control for length of service.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa You don't look for exact simultaneous matches on N categorical traits when your sample pool looks smaller than 2^N.		There's barely enough to say that governors do better at running for president with any real confidence.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Launching a successful presidential bid from a small state is Just Not Done (TM). Usually. The only other guy who pulled it off got primaried in his re-election bid.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Thank you for bringing that to my attention... but only briefly. I'd say winning the 1st and 3rd-5th of your five(!) gubernatorial elections is a pretty winning record. More impressive than winning 2/2.		An "obvious" good pick in some ways, unusual in others. All of them are.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Being older than most successful candidates being a liability? That's something hard to be sure of.		https://t.co/G5WECkQwsa		We know voters abstractly prefer moderate age, but Reagan got re-elected.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Bush II, Reagan, and Carter also went from governor to president. The fact that governors are more likely to win presidential races than anyone short of incumbents or VPs is well-established.		The general idea that major scandals attached to a candidate are not helpful is likely.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa You're fixating on "is this person likely to win the primary."		What I'm looking at are the characteristics of successful candidates. Bill Clinton was comparatively young, governor, and his scandals broke in 1992. Barack Obama was comparatively young and had no major scandals.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa That's literally an n=4 comparison.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa He fits those fundamentals. Now, does he, per your original claim, "already have more support, funding, and establishment figures in their wing"? Does Granholm?
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa It's still not a very large category.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa The caveats about not having been knocked out of office or having major scandals hanging around? Those are generally signs a political career is over. Standard caveats.		Including sitting governors as the same, particularly ones in a 2nd term, would fit well under "fundamentals."
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Being old is something of a drawback for a candidate, I think especially for a Democratic candidate. This is not very fair.		Governors do better than senators, generally (this is fairly consistent over history). Sitting governors are also pretty good potential picks, mind you.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Not really. Those conditions are prior. Successful candidates have been typically generals (that age is over), former vice presidents (not many of those), governors, and senators.		If he won, O'Malley would mark out as 13th oldest (!) of 46 presidents.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Basically, what does that mean? O'Malley is pretty much the only Democrat in his category. 		He does offer some things that "can't be found elsewhere in a candidate that doesn't already have more support, funding, and establishment figures in their wing."
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa O'Malley's net disapproval bottomed out at -7% (and then rebounded afterwards back up to even in his retrospective approval shortly later, see above).		Malloy-CT went all the way down to an astonishing net -50% disapproval rating. Nowhere near the same.
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Note I mentioned "no major scandals." Blago is really right out for matching that fundamental, as is Brownback. 		For Malloy, well, I suppose you could argue the point, but I'm pretty sure this would be a dead weight around his neck:		https://t.co/aEiSS9M6M5
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa Blago was removed (not retired) and Brownback is literally part of the Trump administration. Malloy and Brownback both exited with incredibly negative approval ratings; O'Malley's weren't bad in comparison.		https://t.co/gx3y11s8sm
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa You have to go back to 1990 to find a D-MD gubernatorial candidate who posted better numbers than O'Malley in 2010. MD-GOV isn't exactly an automatic Democratic victory.		Preceded by (and defeated) R-Ehrlich (52% in 2002), succeeded by R-Hogan (52% in 2014, 55% in 2018).
@AsInMarx @BenJ_Rosenblatt @SenhorRaposa He's an undefeated (i.e., retired rather than ousted) former governor under the age of 60 with no major scandals attached to his name.		Those are some pretty good fundamentals that are hard to match, and I would score him high for the chutzpah to run against Hillary in 2016.

@SweetAl @PoliticsWolf @politicsluo I.e., in both cases, the situation post-election will be a Republican legislature and Democratic governor - neither side can make sweeping changes to the status quo at that point.
@SweetAl @PoliticsWolf @politicsluo (Well, strictly speaking, not necessarily *only* due to gerrymandering - they still did get a significant share of votes statewide - but gerrymandered maps played a significant role.)
@SweetAl @PoliticsWolf @politicsluo Republicans retained their majority in the state legislature (thanks to gerrymandering). In WI, they're losing the governorship; in NC, they're losing the supermajority that let them override vetoes.
@xenocryptsite If you take it, you earn $21,000 (and not get the benefit). If you don't take it, you get a total of $23,000. This is called a poverty trap: Working more earns you less.		Bright-line means tests do this. &gt;100% marginal tax rates would as well; tax rates are usually &lt;100%. (2/2)

@West_Looper @pedramolar @reemadamin I.e., those at the top of the SES ladder can afford a comparable private option much more easily, so not making the cut for a highly competitive public option is really not such a big deal; for those who aren't in the top quintile or so of $$$, that's a lot of money.
@West_Looper @pedramolar @reemadamin (3) makes a lot of sense to me. NYC has close to a quarter million private school students, and the area around NYC has quite a few more private schools.		Reminds me of how things are in California about UC admissions.
@brodiedduncan @Polit_eurOpines @HeidiYork @jimpiasecki93 @KimDeBarge @witliftin @sharicedavids @HillaryClinton @CharityNav 2018 in NC was about a five point swing from 2014 in NC. The maps, however, made that swing mostly moot in House seats.		The map was already declared unconstitutional by NC courts, and Republicans lost their supermajority in the state leg. 2020 NC house races will look different.
@witliftin @jimpiasecki93 @HeidiYork Look at the shading. Notice how you have very dark yellow extending in a nearly continuous belt in MS, southern AL, central GA, and SC? Notice how that belt resumes in VA?		It cuts off at the NC border (on both sides) discontinuously, replaced by light yellow (narrow margins).
@jimpiasecki93 @HeidiYork @witliftin NC had a later primary than the other southern states, and the result was much closer in rural NC than rural SC/VA/GA. You can see the effect pretty neatly on the county map - that strong "belt" of large Clinton margins across the south is interrupted in NC with narrow margins. https://t.co/Z1N0ek1gMX
@brodiedduncan @HeidiYork @jimpiasecki93 @Polit_eurOpines @KimDeBarge @witliftin @sharicedavids @HillaryClinton @CharityNav Conventional wisdom is that Donald Trump is an unusually unpopular president who will go down in flames.		This may or may not be correct, but I do think that prospective Democratic candidates have been thinking along those lines since late in 2016.
@brodiedduncan @HeidiYork @jimpiasecki93 @Polit_eurOpines @KimDeBarge @witliftin @sharicedavids @HillaryClinton @CharityNav I think it's a given that it would be messy even without the Sanders v. Clinton camp animosity:		(1) It's a "likely D" year by conventional wisdom. 		(2) The pre-clear of the 2016 primary means 12 years of sidelines, not the usual 4-8!		(3) No clear insider "successor."
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter My "view" that California's commission was the result of the ballot initiative process and was neither designed by nor supported by the Democratic state legislature is unlikely to change. That would be an established historical fact.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter If you want to improve on those redistricting commissions, you look at improving transparency, selection process, et cetera.		Giving up and letting the state legislatures do whatever they want will not improve the gerrymandering situation.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter Given that I'm the one telling you that politicians' interests conflict with the agenda of drawing a fair map, no, it's not news to me.		This is why redistricting commissions - nonpartisan with a clear established mandate to draw fair districts - are better.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter I recommend you take a couple minutes to compare CA to MA. Both are similarly Democratic (D+12 Cook PVI). Compare D-seats and R-seats in those two states.		MA's districts are drawn by state legislature.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter I'm aware that some people think the commission was hijacked, particularly Republicans. 		https://t.co/ufBbLPOu2E		Schwarzenegger thought the commission did a better job than the leg., as have many Democrats and most independents... and researchers.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter Again, the Democratic legislature *didn't* do that. Literally. 		The CA Democratic Party, in fact, actively *opposed* the creation of the committee; Arnold Schwarzenagger was a prominent supporter.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter The legislature plays a role in the selection of the commission, but its authority is derived directly from the CA constitution as altered by voters via proposition.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter Not in California.		https://t.co/DMVIinKtdo		In CA, per the *CA* constitution, voters can write law directly. They did so (over the objections of the Democratic Party) to form the commission.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter ... so if it's "not fraud" for state legislatures to draw districts on the basis of it being constitutionally sound, it's also "not fraud" for nonpartisan commissions to do so, as that is equally constitutionally sound.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter It literally says nothing about who is supposed to draw districts. There isn't even a requirement that states *use* districts. Read away: https://t.co/hx25nnBh2l		A nonpartisan commission drawing districts is as Constitutional as a state legislature drawing districts...
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter The Constitution is silent on that topic. A conflict of interest, however, is clear, and it is therefore imperative to take steps to check that conflict.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter Where a non-partisan commission has taken over the job, races are more competitive and districts are less often shaped like salamanders.		The fraud is allowing state legislators to choose their own districts to re-elect themselves. That's what was happening in California.
@SCOAMT @atlsportscholar @KentonTilford @JackJolis @KurtSchlichter They didn't have a choice. The power was stripped from them by the voters. 		CA's ballot initiative process is among the most aggressive direct democracy in the entire country. You don't need legislators to approve a law.
@JackJolis @KentonTilford @SCOAMT @KurtSchlichter I.e., this is normal for single-member districts when you don't have proportional representation.
@JackJolis @KentonTilford @SCOAMT @KurtSchlichter Their losses in Orange County (!) show that California Republicans are in a really bad spot.		What can they do? Get a divorce from the national party? Break off and start backing third-party candidates? Re-brand as conservative Democrats?
@JackJolis @KentonTilford @SCOAMT @KurtSchlichter ~33% ish, not 40%. Although that figure is less meaningful than usual given the D-D and R-R contests in CA.		One decent rule of thumb: Expect that every 1% you lose below 50%, you'd lose about 2% on a fair map. At 33=50-17%, you'd expect something like a 50-34% = 16% seat hold.

@AlbertsonB2 E.g., if I use "partisan" in a political context, people are likely to infer the group is a specific political party. Great if I want that, not so great if I want to refer to something else.

@NiallStanage That does not look like a "blue wall." That looks like a closer-than-average presidential election that can hinge on narrow results in a couple of states.		The idea of a #BlueWall was foolishness rooted in poor understanding of the volatility of the #ElectoralCollege system.
At a scale of (1 governor = 1 state legislature = state's US House delegation) + (1 senator = 4.35 representatives), with red = Republican, blue = Democrat, Green = independent...		... too washed out? Or is that just right?		#ElectionResults2018 https://t.co/jU5Y9hpbQs
E.g., remember all those weirdly distributed undervotes in Florida this time around? Manual recount happened, looked like yes, a lot of ballots left the race blank. Probably poor ballot design, but those were the votes.

(2) ... which is why being able to audit results is crucial. If this is low-p weirdness, an audit would clear it up.		#PaperBallots. https://t.co/uVBlZchxou

@SarahJKS77 @louann_fernald @TheCenteredEgg @DogginTrump @KathySolberg Here is an article discussing some of the reasons why low turnout figures were circulating immediately in the wake of the 2012 election:		https://t.co/bpHZlwlbMU
@CShentrup @Antagonist @ElectoralRef0rm Which happens with approval voting in the example given - fixed opinions on candidates, changes in results with the removal of a losing candidate.		The only thing that changes are the specific numbers assigned to candidates by ballots, but that is very typical.
@SarahJKS77 @louann_fernald @TheCenteredEgg @DogginTrump @KathySolberg I can be wrong.		However, I do not believe I am wrong here. You're citing numbers that do not match any of the sources I have checked for 2016.		Counts of votes vary, but generally not by that much, and the exact numbers you gave are present in 2012 accounts.
@SarahJKS77 @louann_fernald @TheCenteredEgg @DogginTrump @KathySolberg I wanted to know what specific page you were looking at. Such as this one:		https://t.co/CGlHs89Kep		Which gives the turnout for *2012* as 129,085,410.		You are citing 2012 numbers as 2016 numbers.
@Antagonist @CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm In practice, yes! Even a hypothetical IIA-compliant system may show reversals.		IIA tests the scenario in which you do not, i.e., voters have the same underlying opinions of each candidate. Subsets will shift maps. E.g., (9,3,1) with (1,0,0) ballot and (3,1) with a (1,0) ballot.
@SarahJKS77 @louann_fernald @TheCenteredEgg @DogginTrump @KathySolberg Link to your source, please. 		I believe you are looking at 2012 numbers (highest office VAP).
@CShentrup @Antagonist @ElectoralRef0rm *of those preferences. ^^
@CShentrup @Antagonist @ElectoralRef0rm No, they need not change preferences... simply the ballot that is a granular expression of those expressions.		If you prefer A &gt; B &gt; C, planned to vote for only A on your approval ballot, and A drops out, you are probably going to vote for B instead.
@Antagonist @CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm You can induce an order of preferences from a set of utilities but not vice versa, yes. You can also lose information to granularity (e.g., full preferences from a full-spectrum range ballot, but not an approval ballot; from a Borda Count, but not a plurality vote).

Most of the pairings I've seen people float are of the more typical "older states[wo]man on top, up-and-comer for VP" variety, which is why that feature is coming to mind.
I'm hearing a lot of chatter about possible Democratic pairings for the #2020election, and it reminded me of one feature of the #ObamaBiden ticket in 2008:		Fresh exciting "inexperienced" face with appeal to independents; reliable older partisan statesman type for VP.
@Fortunatebri @alexkotch @davidsirota OTOH, if he won his Senate race and immediately jumped to run for president, he could reasonably be accused of just using the Senate seat as a platform - and also be subject to whatever negative impressions might be focused on Senate Democrats and DC.

All this chatter about what states are / will be #2020BattlegroundStates really just underlines one point:		It's crazy that presidential candidates are *expected* to ignore most of the country when running for office because of the way the #ElectoralCollege works.
@LucioMM1 @joelwatsonfish @PsychRabble Interesting - I hadn't noticed (4) going through the paper and the contrast b/w individual and group rates. Women being significantly more willing to go to blind auditions makes sense as an explanation for that.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm You're not talking about the same system. 		I'm referring to the "exception" method in the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, which is strategy-proof. (Draw a random ballot, this ballot gives the output ranking of candidates.)
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Do preferences have fixed magnitudes?		This is not empirically true, given that preferences in practice are very unstable (see again choice paradoxes). 		For rational actors, preferences ought to correspond to the orderings of utilities, and hence have a natural magnitude.
@ElectoralRef0rm @CShentrup That's covered under "deterministic."		An interesting perspective on election by lottery of ballots is that the method is very much like invoking a temporary dictator.
@ElectoralRef0rm @CShentrup Right, hence not considering the additional class of "paradoxes" - or really just undesirable system features - related to incentives to misrepresent preferences.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Utility and preferences are not the same. 		Utility is absolute; preferences are relative. You prefer A over B, B over A, or are indifferent; utility tells us the value for you of each.		Utility is objective but inaccessible; preferences are subjective but accessible.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Exactly the class of argument I already alluded to.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm *IF* you make certain key axiomatic assumptions, you derive standard unidimensional expected utility theory. 		This does not render utilities accessible outside of hypothetical thought experiments, or that preferences correlate with utility especially well.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm It applies to reading chicken entrails as a method of making social decisions. Much more easily a multiple positional method that can be formally coded as a map from preferences to one of a set of positional ballots.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Mr. (0.1, 0.5, 0.9) has literally ten times the effect on the election as Ms. (0.09,0.05,0.09), so their votes are not counted the same, nor (importantly) do their preferences have the same weight... and that's talking about an impossible to implement system.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm And the mechanics of choosing between multiple possible ballots given a preference are not fixed by any of Arrow's five properties. These properties are defined in terms of individual preferences and social outcomes.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm 1) Bob ranks A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D. He then votes for A, B, C on his approval ballot. 		(2) Bob changes his mind and ranks A &gt; C &gt; B &gt; D. He then votes for A on his approval ballot. 		The change from (1)-(2) involves C improving rank-order position but losing a point.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Arguably, the difference of 0.8 utility should count more than 0.08 utility - one of these people is less affected by politics than others and therefore has less of a stake - but it's still covered by the theorem.		As I mentioned earlier, so is making decisions via entrails.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Strictly honest non-normalized utility voting would pass IIA. However, you run into difficulties with anonymity, because Mr. (0.1,0.5,0.9) has a vote that counts for more than Ms. (0.09,0.05,0.01)'s; and as soon as you normalize, you violate IIA again.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm I find pretty much everything he said agreeable... but he neither said that approval voting passes the IIA criterion (it does not, and this is easily proven) nor that approval voting was exempt from the mathematics of his theorem (simply that it used additional information).
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm I pointed this out and contrasted it with the case of monotonicity, where AV fails Arrow's version, but not a different (and perfectly meaningful) version of monotonicity.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm This was then not the definition of IIA in Arrow (1950), and would require most of the voters in the example to cast "trivial" ballots in the altered election (approving of no or all candidates, which under some implementations is coded as an "impossible" approval ballot).
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm I already showed you an example where you remove a non-winning candidate, no voter's preference changes, and the result would change. Bob, John, Paul, George, and Ringo.		You then dove down a rabbit hole trying to redefine IIA in a non-meaningful way (no change in ballots).
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm As a voting system, reading chicken entrails does not pass all five of Arrow's criteria, and has few redeeming qualities to recommend it from a mathematical perspective.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm His theorem postulates that voters have the ability to have preferences which are orderings of candidates. This is not unreasonable. His theorem says nothing about system mechanics.		Decision-making via reading chicken entrails, for example, is covered by Arrow's Theorem.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm I've provided you explicit examples showing combinations of preferences and behavior that show approval voting - and by extension range voting - violates the set of criteria defined in Arrow (1950).		This is not a big deal; but it is mathematical fact.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm The interviewer says so. Arrow deftly avoids getting drawn into an argument, instead focusing on trying to explain exactly how approval and range / score voting are promising in a way that would be difficult to anticipate from knowing his theorem.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm No, Arrow most certainly did not say otherwise in the interview you linked to, and the quote you provided does not, in fact, say that.		He talked about the fact that approval voting (et cetera) use additional information. That is not to say that individual preference orders DNE.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm No.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm This is not a bad thing; but it is a mathematical fact. IIA is an essential unobtainable property, and the violation of "positive association" is practically trivial in the light of more natural definitions of monotonicity to use for such systems.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Except that Arrow's theorem does apply to them. They are collective decision-making systems that translate between individual preferences and a group decision.		They do use additional information beyond just the orderings of those preferences (intensity, threshold).
@joelwatsonfish I don't think I've seen that either. I've heard some talk about self-sorting, but it's all been from the perspective of people moving to segregate themselves (neighborhoods, regions, and states becoming more politically homogeneous through migration).
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm Yes. And?		"So this gives more information than simply what I have asked for... Then again, this method does not necessarily avoid paradoxes. But it seems empirically to minimize their importance."		Et cetera.
@causalinf If the student was going on and taking more advanced real or complex analysis courses, undergrad RA / "advanced calculus" would be pretty necessary.
@causalinf A fundamentals course, if taught at the same level, could be better preparation for the types of mathematics done in game theory; real analysis is better preparation for understanding calculus very well, though most physics / engineering types just go straight to diff eq w/o it.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm If you review the interview, you'll note he also underlines the non-mathematical factor of importance that I do: Empiricism, and the fact that just a superficial look at incentive structures is not a substitute for seeing real-world practice.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm I listened earlier. If you parse carefully, you'll find he didn't say his theorem doesn't apply, or that approval voting avoids all paradoxes. He said that it used more information		He had good things to say about range and approval voting - as do I.
@CShentrup @ElectoralRef0rm That's a perfectly well-written page, and how we should generally think of monotonicity.		Arrow's original criterion of positive association, however, is stricter in that it requires positive association; thus a "silly" violation. (Not so for IIA, where AV fails, as is normal.)
@ElectoralRef0rm @CShentrup It is not a question of scope (this is mathematics, the scope includes any collective decision-making system) but meaningfulness. You can say whether or not a cardinal method will fulfill Arrow's version (almost none will do so); it is just rather silly to do, as I said earlier.
@causalinf A "fundamentals of math" class will generally be a course specifically on logic and proof-writing.		In some departments / programs, undergrad real analysis ("baby analysis" or "advanced calculus") serves a dual role as an intro proofs course.
@CShentrup Approval voting allows you to choose to approve 1 candidate or 3 candidates. Or 2.   Take an election with BobA, BobB, BobC (all voting per above), and Karen (who votes for C + D).  		Under scenario (1), C wins, 4 to 3 to 3 to 1.  		Under scenario (2), A wins, 3 to 1 to 1 to 0.
@CShentrup Add together several Bobs in the electorate with suitable other fixed voters and you have C winning under (1) but losing under (2), violating Arrow's version of monotonicity (positive association).
@CShentrup (1) Bob ranks A &gt; B &gt; C &gt; D. He then votes for A, B, C on his approval ballot.		(2) Bob changes his mind and ranks A &gt; C &gt; B &gt; D. He then votes for A on his approval ballot.		The change from (1)-(2) involves C improving rank-order position but losing a point.

@joelwatsonfish @PsychRabble In the face-to-face portion, the consistent suggestion I hear is to structure the interviews formally (and formally structure how interviewers are supposed to rate candidates). From that, seems structured evaluation of candidates might help for evaluating based on site visits.

@CShentrup That hurts C, who improved from ranked 3rd by Bob to ranked 2nd by Bob, thus violating the property as defined in Arrow (1950).
@SSFouts @ThiccVermeil @Ray_J__ @PatrickRuffini Also, states that are very small but not quite large enough for 2 districts (not quite large enough for 3 districts) have unusually *high* population districts. The extremes are Montana (just barely 1 House district) and Rhode Island (just barely 2 House districts).
@Ray_J__ @PatrickRuffini Some happens naturally; some does not. In some cases, Democrats helped create those packed districts as minority-majority districts. This is one of the reasons why the Democrats have been less effective at gerrymandering - competing interests within their own party.
@meelar Interesting perspective. Not sure if I agree, but it is an interesting perspective.
@PatrickRuffini "Packing" your opponent's votes densely into a smaller number of lopsided districts is one of the main #gerrymandering strategies.
@CShentrup Asking Bob to do that when he only voted for C in the first place is asking Bob to cast a trivial ballot. Asking Paul, George, and Ringo to do that when they voted for both of the other candidates is similar.		That's an "if" whose antecedent is pretty dubious.
@CShentrup Maximizing utility *is* a property. And yes, the fact that a system violates IIA is not all that important (ultimately, as I said, every reasonable proposal for an election system does).		That does not change the mathematical facts, or the importance of empiricism.
@CShentrup IIA is defined relative to preference orders, not an approval threshold. https://t.co/J12iFa09Xq
@CShentrup Apt, as rectangles are the more general case. Squares are not exceptions to statements that discuss all rectangles.
@CShentrup C improves in standing but falls in votes. Do a few transformations like that and C could drop from first to last place though C "rises but does not fall in the ordering of each individual," as Arrow (1950) defines the criterion.
@CShentrup Monotonicity *as defined relative to ballots*, yes. But if you define "positive association" re: preference orders as in Arrow (1950), threshold movement can invoke a violation (silly but mathematically correct):		Bob votes for ABC out of ABCD |-&gt; votes for A out of ACBD
I just looked at the top of the editorial manager, and it told me I'm #Reviewer2.		Really, though, this is a good paper. I don't know how I can live up to the title of Reviewer #2...
@CShentrup Candidates dropping out to change an election? That's an *important* question, and one that drives a lot of real-world dialogue.
@CShentrup In the case of IIA, the simple extension of the definition to a "natural" ask for a cardinal system: Hey, does the result change if a candidate doesn't run?		The answer that is *it can*, because there may be voters whose votes become trivial. Fixed ballots? That's a silly notion.
@CShentrup ... although that would be very silly, as there's a more natural definition to use for a cardinal system.
@CShentrup Arrow's theorem, from Arrow's 1950 paper, introduces IIA. IIA is the property that pretty much every voting system, including approval voting, violates.		Technically, approval voting violates monotonicity as Arrow defined it (i.e.,  thresholds moving in opposite direction)...
@CShentrup In an approval vote, you would either have to mandate that Paul, Bob, George, and Ringo cast trivial ballots, or allow them to change thresholds.		Arrow's theorem, as you can see below from Arrow (1950), relies on the preference orderings - not anything about the ballot. https://t.co/ru4Jqzh2X3
@CShentrup I'm not interested in getting in a Wikipedia edit war with you.
@CShentrup I've given you a direct example of IIA violation.
@CShentrup Let's ask you again. Who do Bob, George, Paul, and Ringo vote for?
@CShentrup Approval voting can be viewed as a ranked voting system.		Again, who do Bob, Paul, George, and Ringo vote for? If they prefer B over A, then B wins, thereby violating IIA.		It's a simple fact.
So, now that we've had the midterms, except for some arguments about Florida and a few other places...  in two years, we're going to trust the presidential election to a system that could be decided by a few hundred missing ballots somewhere in Florida. #ElectoralCollege.
@CShentrup Again ... Bob, Paul, George, and Ringo have not changed their preferences (which  we don't know) between A and B. We removed "irrelevant" losing candidate  C, whom only Bob liked.  Can B be elected? Yes. It depends on both their preferences and their  thresholds. IIA is violated.
@CShentrup This isn't really a crazy statement. Pretty much any textbook that covers the topic will tell you that every reasonable method - including approval voting - fails IIA.		The real question to ask is how often and how badly.
@CShentrup Bob, Paul, George, and Ringo have not changed their preferences (which we don't know) between A and B. We removed "irrelevant" losing candidate C, whom only Bob liked.		Can B be elected? Yes. It depends on both their preferences and their thresholds. IIA is violated.
@CShentrup Let's ask you again: Who do Bob, Paul, George, and Ringo vote for? A or B?		It depends on their threshold. Not their preference order. 		That's the same distinction that allows approval voters to be strategic without being insincere.
@CShentrup John, Paul, George, and Bob have not changed their rankings of A and B.		They are, however, likely to choose different thresholds. (And if we require them to cast non-trivial ballots, they are forced to.)
@CShentrup If you elect the same people that you would in a plurality vote, you have a functional equivalent to a plurality vote.
@CShentrup Bob votes for C.	George, Paul, and Ringo vote for A and B.	John votes for just A.		We remove C from the election. Irrelevant candidate. Who does Bob vote for? Who do John, Paul, and Ringo vote for? It might not be A. That is where IIA comes in.
@CShentrup False dilemma. You do not need to have 100% bullet voting for a approval election to function as if it were a plurality vote. Anything over 50% is striking.		In the SC&amp;W case, that was over 90%.
@CShentrup I linked you to a paper thoroughly documenting an approval election dominated by bullet voting.
@CShentrup "Utter nonsense" that has been documented to actually happen. Empiricism is important when you want to do science.
@CShentrup Approval is not "immune to Arrow." 		Mathematical theorems do not grant immunity. I'm familiar with the argument that the theorem is not designed to accommodate the additional information. I'm also familiar with the pragmatic reason it still fails (i.e., relative thresholding).
@CShentrup That's an interesting and absolutist perspective. Duck; walk; quack.
@CShentrup For Minnesota. ^^ 		That's the Jesse Ventura election. There was a strong incentive for those who didn't support Jesse to consolidate behind one of the two other candidates; they didn't.
@CShentrup False dilemma. I may as well ask you to point to an election where &gt;50% clearly didn't vote for their favorite.		Although, for that matter, we can be pretty confident that in the 1998 gubernatorial election, there weren't all that many people settling on their second choice.
@CShentrup You do not know how non-mathematically-behaved people are.		Real human beings frequently *don't even have transitive preferences.* You can offer someone a choice between product A and product B; they choose A. Then you pull out C and they sometimes switch and choose B.
@CShentrup Pretty much everything you've pointed to of any mathematical substance is something I knew over ten years ago.		Which brings me back to my point: Approval voting is a step forward - provided voters avoid the tendency to bullet vote. Which is not a mathematical property.
@CShentrup Again: "How often is a matter of some contention. It's hard to measure - and it's not going to be the same universal rate in every election and every place."
@CShentrup Are you claiming Brams made things up to make approval voting look bad?		Because that sounds like what you're claiming by calling that "mythology."
@CShentrup Yes. Every single one. That's the tricky part. A sharp mathematician can tell you what must happen and what could happen; but to know what will happen, you need a social scientist, a mathematician, and good empirical data... and you'll still be wrong sometimes.
@CShentrup I.e., the IEEE membership base had gradually gone back to only voting for one candidate each.		We will know how traditional political elections with approval voting go once we see them happen. Hopefully, Fargo will not be the only place that embraces electoral reforms.
@CShentrup How often is a matter of some contention. It's hard to measure - and it's not going to be the same universal rate in every election and every place.		https://t.co/W63syqwVhb	https://t.co/VoEe3AE9ij		(UK 1987 example.)		As I said, that reduction happens:		https://t.co/2ojXV9QvMj https://t.co/v5NlknUJ8z
@CShentrup Which leads us back to really the central contentious issue about approval voting: How sensitive an approval voting system is to problems hinges on the structure of voter behavior.		If voters judge candidates on their own merits and average half-approval, the system works well.
@CShentrup Note the restriction of objective judging, i.e., not in comparison to other candidates but simply judging against objective benchmarks, would lead to many "trivial" votes by voters (e.g., approving no or all candidates), which is generally not expected.
@CShentrup The MaskinArrow page contains an error, which inadvertently supports your point. Approval voting does, in fact, fail the IIA criterion.		It can only be considered to pass if you require strict objective judging by voters, ruling out strategic thresholding behavior a priori.
@CShentrup When you're telling the logic teacher that he's offering you a steaming pile of logical fallacy after telling the mathematician that he doesn't under stand "the basic math," it might be time for you to take a break to think about your approach to the discussion.
@CShentrup (For that matter, a utility calculation with a correct probability of individually influencing an election leads to the "paradox of voting," whereby economists conclude that voting is irrational behavior and wonder why it happens at all.)
@CShentrup Assuming rational behavior in even very simple settings with multiple actors is really not warranted, however. Again, behavioral economists have been testing that hypothesis extensively. Homo economicus is not a common species of human.
@CShentrup If we discount professional society elections as "real world" and cling to unproven assumptions about voter behavior.		All you need for perfectly rational bullet voting, however, is voter perceptions of their most favored candidate as being likely to win.
@CShentrup Depends on what elections you're talking about. In many cases, the answer is "we're not sure," just as we aren't sure whether or not IRV voters who only rank one candidate are doing so strategically or because they don't know how the system works.

@know1intrinsic Everyone should be automatically in the voter rolls. It's sort of hard to evade the government noticing where you live and sending you a tax bill for it, it should be equally hard to evade being registered to vote in the appropriate precinct.
@CShentrup If your system gave you the same results as a plurality vote because almost all voters cast bullet votes, I'd say you're in looks-like-a-duck-and-quacks-like-a-duck territory.		Of course, if your worst case is a duck, it's worth trading your existing duck for an approval vote.
@CShentrup I didn't say that approval voting inevitably devolves to a plurality vote. I said that voters tend to bullet vote - and if they do this, you have the same outcome that you would for a plurality vote.
@CShentrup The Laslier experiment was a hypothetical survey; we're not sure those voters would have actually voted that way with stakes on the line. We can *hope* so, but it's hard to be sure. 		One common thought: Once voters get used to a different system, they will bullet vote less.
@CShentrup They can and have held elections where almost all voters cast a bullet vote.		I gave you a link to a published paper analyzing an example of such.
@CShentrup Yes. And I say approval voting is a step forward from that.
@CShentrup There's no confusion there.		In the context of the professional society election in question, there was broad agreement that all of the candidates were well-regarded among the electorate. In that context, therefore, most bullet voting was expected to be strategic bullet voting. https://t.co/Tfbl6DY26M
@CShentrup No, I mean actual voting behavior in approval voting elections as observed. Famously within the field, this includes a well-analyzed election for the SC&amp;W society, i.e., experts on voting:		https://t.co/fT6ADa4duQ
@CShentrup Mind you, Condorcet winners will win an AV often, and the argument can be adapted to poll-strategy cycles.		The behavioral question is the tough one. And from what I've done, I believe approval voting works well *if* voters approach it correctly. It has some nice properties.
@CShentrup Those assumptions are not likely to be filled by voters in practice. I know they sound reasonable, but  speaking as an expert, shared expections of joint behavior at equilibrium is a very big ask. Behavioral economists have done a lot of nice work along those lines.
@CShentrup It really is. I read it before I started my doctorate in the field. My dissertation advisor was one of the experts discussed in it.
@CShentrup That "worst case scenario" is unfortunately common, behaviorally, and exactly what I was talking about. AV can give good results depending on how voters approach it.
Approval voting: It works better than a plurality vote, if people use it wisely.		The problem tends to be that voters tend to react to an approval vote by only choosing one candidate to vote for, and then you just have a plurality vote all over again. https://t.co/RruOB0T9rf

@slider_12 @seanmdav It is. There's some non-linearity in translating from overall percentage to seats, but 49.4% with 44.6% of seats is disproportionate, and you have to go back to the pre-Civil Rights Act era (marked by very low Southern turnout) in order to find a similar disproportion to 2012.

@TheRealTwylaFox It is worth noting that (arguably illegally and certainly contra the #Framers' intentions) many states currently coerce electors' votes by applying a fine, invalidating their vote, et cetera.		The number of "rogue" electors in 2016 would have been higher, from what I have heard.
@TheRealTwylaFox Many of those opponents were perfectly happy with the idea of electors appointed uniformly by state legislatures.		Most of those would have opposed the EC had they known it would end up with direct election of electors - much less pre-pledged electors expected to act as proxies.
@TheRealTwylaFox They weren't expected to be "entrusted with votes," i.e., pledged to support a particular candidate. 		Pledging was an unexpected - and early - innovation that ran counter to the intentions of the #Framers at the #ConstitutionalConvention. It developed naturally from the parties.
@TheRealTwylaFox Madison, Wilson, and Morris - three key supporters of the #ElectoralCollege - endorsed direct election of the president at the #ConstitutionalConvention.		The key early opponents who pivoted on the final version mostly opposed allowing voters a say at all.
@TheRealTwylaFox Even if you don't approve of the #NPVIC (I do, for the record), it's worth noting that it cleverly underlines a dangerous loophole - the #ElectoralCollege can be reshaped into almost any form by decree of substantially fewer than three quarters of state legislatures.
@TheRealTwylaFox It's a fundamentally bad system. That it can be cleverly "hacked" by interstate compact into any new form without passing a constitutional amendment, and *has already been* "hacked" into a form completely different from the Founders' intentions, are strikes against it.
@TheRealTwylaFox ... as more of the attendees of the #ConstitutionalConvention preferred electors chosen by state legislatures over electors chosen by the hoi polloi. 		They did not *want* citizens to have a say. They wanted the decision to be made by wise elites chosen by wise elites.
@TheRealTwylaFox The states have the power to choose any method they like. Historically, many of them chose methods that didn't involve the votes of their own citizens at all. (Particularly worth noting SC and NY.)		Fundamentally, the Framers had to allow that in order to get the EC approved...

@TheRealTwylaFox The #NPVIC isn't moronic. It's very clever.		It uses exactly the same feature that let states distort #ElectoralCollege by choosing WTA: States choose the allocation method.		This was politically necessary to pass the EC in convention, but terrible for insuring fair elections.
@TheRealTwylaFox A highest-remainder proportional allocation with a 10% threshold gives 270 Clinton, 267 Trump, 1 McMullin, unless I have some data entry errors for 2016.		Barring Constitutional amendment, though, there's no way to force all states to use the same allocation rule.
@economeager On top of the bad fit, even the napkin-theory is wrong - the two pinned 0-revenue points should be at 0% and 100%.
@pundit_2016 @DNC @FoxNews @POTUS @GOP @ABC @GMA No, it doesn't.		In fact, as you mention New York, I feel obligated to point out that historically, the #ElectoralCollege has made New York immensely important in presidential politics. Tammany Hall had a say in presidential politics because of the EC.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@TheRealTwylaFox I won't be surprised if evaluations of Clinton (nearest proxy for Gore / Clinton II), Bush II, and Trump change. Hayes and Cleveland, though?		It's really hard to make a solid case that Hayes was better than Tilden would have been - Reconstruction got gutted.
@TheRealTwylaFox I'm actually a little surprised on proportional allocation, though it may also depend on choice of proportional allocation rule used.
@TheRealTwylaFox Well, there's #HamiltonElectors and small shifts in numbers of raw votes to consider as well. 2016 wasn't a razor's edge election like 2000 and 1876, but in terms of minor changes having a major impact, it is definitely up there.
@TheRealTwylaFox Well, the following perfectly reasonable (i.e., precedented or intended) variations throw pretty much all close presidential races into reach:		*All electors chosen by district. I.e., original Wilson plan - depending on who drew lines.	*Different rules used in different states.
@TheRealTwylaFox What can be said readily is that none of the presidents elected against popular will have earned positive ratings from presidential historians.
@TheRealTwylaFox It is very difficult to evaluate counterfactuals realistically. For 2000, 2016, current partisanship is the dominant factor in evaluations.		For Tilden, the closest benchmark (NY reform oriented Dem) is Cleveland, who is generally evaluated much better than Hayes.
@TheRealTwylaFox What do you mean by "spread vote" redistribution?
@TheRealTwylaFox It is exactly the 3+ candidate elections where electoral systems are stress-tested.		1860 EC results are robust to the counterfactual 60-40 antiLincoln candidate, however.
RT @SarahCEStanton: Sent in my absentee ballot. Please vote, Americans. No social loafing. Vote, vote, vote!
@ChaplainDM @theblaze In 2000, NM had a razor-thin margin. This is widely forgotten because it didn't matter and neither candidate litigated the NM recount process. Whatever happened with Florida's electoral votes would decide the election.		The #ElectoralCollege is dominated by large states.
@TheRealTwylaFox As far as an example of a roadmap for electing an extremist, look at the patterns of support in 1860.		https://t.co/YfybSkgjqZ		We were lucky that Lincoln was not a Hitler, but he was elected with &lt;40% and was not a centrist candidate (and the centrists got thrashed in the EC).
@TheRealTwylaFox (3) This is correct but does not provide a check against a Hitler except to the degree that the presidential election system is independent of parliamentary elections - which makes the #ElectoralCollege's vulnerability to extremist candidates a hazard by the #HitlerMetric.
@TheRealTwylaFox (2) is correct. Winner take all was never intended. It nevertheless has happened, and makes the system especially chaotic and vulnerable to electing candidates with a narrow base of support in key urbanized areas.
@TheRealTwylaFox Violent suppression of opposition parties began before 1933 parliamentary I. Since this didn't lead to easy control of parliament, they banned other parties and tried again. The 1933 parliamentary II was conducted with single-candidate lists, making it meaningless.
@TheRealTwylaFox Hitler did not win the popular vote until after seizing power and compromising elections.		1932 presidential: Hindenburg 53%, Hitler 37%.	1932 parliamentary I: 37% NSDAP	1932 parliamentary II: 33% NSDAP	1933 parliamentary I: 44% NSDAP	1933 parliamentary II: 92% NSDAP
@MeLoseBrainUhOh @ForecasterEnten I agree it's a problem, but a small one, and the runoff does provide a clear block against extremists. E.g., Louisiana in 1991, France in 2002 (both with higher runoff turnout).		The bigger turnout problem is midterm scheduling.		https://t.co/8LbCAv7smJ
@ChaplainDM @theblaze You have that backwards.		The #ElectoralCollege narrows the battleground, and it is the most populous of the battleground states that routinely decide the election, e.g., Florida in 2000, Ohio in 2004.		https://t.co/N9dIYHvYFP
@MeLoseBrainUhOh @ForecasterEnten Plurality-with-majority-runoff (PMR) is pretty much the standard globally. 		It's not perfect, but it's a better behaved system than plurality without a runoff.
@Media4LifeMin I could just as easily say that Trump only won because of the way that Detroit and a few other cities voted. 		That's the thing with the #ElectoralCollege. It's chaotic. Easy to change. The 2016 election could have been decided by Midwestern weather patterns.
@ChaplainDM @theblaze James Madison wanted the president to be elected by popular vote. 		James #FatherOfTheConstitution Madison.
@theblaze "Populists hate it" would make more sense if the #ElectoralCollege's hands weren't tied.		Populists win in the EC all the time. Trump is exactly the sort of candidate, full of populist rhetoric and disliked by political elites, that the Founders intended to be stopped by the EC.
@craig_brewhaha @1776Stonewall @Amyloukingery @realDonaldTrump The #ElectoralCollege does exactly that with a 100%-0% winner-take-all rule. Remember when the election came down to a few hundred votes in Florida in 2000?		For that matter, 2016 was, as much as anything else, lost in three key metro areas: Milwaukee, Detroit, and Miami. https://t.co/cWFqddIRr9
@pundit_2016 @DNC @FoxNews @POTUS @GOP @ABC @GMA The #ElectoralCollege was a lousy system in 1796 and it's still lousy today.		It doesn't work the way it was supposed to and it doesn't really do anything useful today, either.

@TheRedQuest @causalinf Thank you for clarifying your meaning.
@causalinf @TheRedQuest Surveys on the subject of Title IX itself look sparse. Best that came to hand:		https://t.co/F7GbS9juz7	https://t.co/dnv0iQRyd6		It may be relevant to note that the 2016 Republican platform had a Title IX plank in it. (2016 Democratic platform did not.) https://t.co/Rvjl88aKUW
@causalinf @TheRedQuest At most tenuously, yes - AFAIK the big three factors are politicization (particularly among Republicans), tuition costs (particularly among Democrats), and adjunctification (particularly among insiders).
@causalinf @TheRedQuest I could show you a gallery of Fox News stories about Title IX. 		I would not be surprised if few people can identify what Title IX is correctly; I would not, however, be willing to confidently rule out Title IX enforcement as a factor in "politicization." Hence "arguably."
@causalinf @TheRedQuest Not at all. 		But while people widely view faculty having sex with students as somewhere between scandalous and wrong (at least up unless they get married, at which point retroactive legitimation happens), concerns about Title IX processes fit under concerns about politicization.
@causalinf @TheRedQuest Problem with that is that there's basically no position institutions can take on harassment that won't attract criticism, and Title IX enforcement itself isn't one of the biggies (tuition costs, politicization, adjunctification).
@causalinf @TheRedQuest ... now that you mention it, arguably. Implementation of Title IX processes in ways considered unfair (and political in nature, "due process" vs "believe the victim" is highly political) certainly lead to criticism of colleges universities.
@causalinf @TheRedQuest Insider Higher Ed is not the most neutral source on the subject, of course. I should really just have linked directly to the Gallup and Pew surveys that stirred up the fuss.		There are several different veins of criticism of higher education that are all growing together:

@SimonDeDeo @HarryDCrane Interesting. I am not shocked - had been thinking on the topic. Modeled dynamically or in a multi-actor system, discrimination can definitely function as an anticoordination game. A signal from initial discrimination *can* persist at length, depending.

@brett_matsumoto @economeager On the gripping hand, there *have* to be some studies out there of just the interview process and wearing heels. That's easier to measure than longitudinal outcomes.
@brett_matsumoto @economeager I've seen studies that say women are also affected similarly in career outcomes, but more weakly; OTOH, because of the heels thing, women's actual height is correlated more weakly with their apparent height, so I would expect a weaker measurement even if the effect is the same.

@david_darmofal @nytpolitics Heck, if Democrats are on the winning side of the cycle, it's not even *in their immediate interest* to have an independent redistricting commission.		This would protect the Republicans from a hard Democratic gerrymander after a #BlueWave.
@James_L_Hill @charliekirk11 Long answer is the whole article. An alternate long answer is "They're trying to count numbers that shouldn't be counted that way, and California's voter turnout is way too low for there to be a lot of extra illegit voters running around."
@DrewVanDrese ... that is, presuming the Bull Moose run folds back into the Republican party. If not, a four-term TR pretty much means the Republican party will have gone the way of the Whigs and been supplanted.		Trying to track forward past the 20s starts involving a lot of guesswork. Fun :)
@DrewVanDrese Democrats may or may not take over in 1916. Teddy Roosevelt could have held the helm to be the four-term president instead of his later cousin. 		Women breaking Republican probably secures Republican control in the 1920s. If the Harding types don't take over, perhaps no bubble...
@DrewVanDrese To start with, Wilson doesn't segregate Federal service. Then the United States probably enters WWI in 1914. Would this generate a massive backlash against the Republicans? Maybe.		Harding's unabashedly in-the-pocket-of-big-business brand doesn't take over the Republican Party...

@vinofictions @RadioFreeTom Yes. Congress can, by supermajority, put it to the states.		The state governments can also independently reform the Electoral College by compact, which is slightly more likely to happen - the #NPVIC doesn't need three-quarters of states signed on in order to function.
@RadioFreeTom That said, it is very hard to pass a constitutional amendment to permanently dustbin it without going through Congress.		We have not had an #ArticleVConvention yet.
@stubbe2hou @Nicole_Cliffe That may be rooted in a second order effect... many educated women refuse to date less-educated men, so men expect to be rejected by women who are more educated and therefore might not be willing to spend the time messaging.

@Tiki1125 @nickapls @YALiberty What is also simple fact is that Hillary Clinton would have won with Obama-level performance in three key metro areas, in spite of her negatives in rural areas. 		The #ElectoralCollege concentrates the political battleground narrowly. https://t.co/xByUsejZbm
@Tiki1125 @nickapls @YALiberty I've looked through the campaign expenditures by state and the campaign events by state.		This is not speculation, but fact: Trump and Clinton both ignored most states in the campaign and overtly concentrated on battlegrounds.
@Tiki1125 @nickapls @YALiberty If you want to think of "distribution of resources" in terms of policy terms, it's pretty similar. What nets you 1% in California won't cost much more or less than those than what nets you 1% in ten smaller states adding up to a California, and you have diminishing returns.

@SadiqKhan @peoplesvote_uk I think that #Brexit is a mistake, but "taken out of the hands of the politicians and returned to the British people" seems like disingenuous rhetoric when that was the idea behind the original referendum.
@Tiki1125 @nickapls @YALiberty I.e., the first million dollars you spend campaigning in State A get you a lot further than the second million dollars campaigning in State B. In terms of winning the most popular votes, the most resource-efficient method is to spend *everywhere*.
@Tiki1125 @nickapls @YALiberty Comment on this.		A huge amount of resource expenditure is in geographically targeted advertising. On a per-voter basis, advertising to Californians isn't appreciably cheaper than advertising to anyone else.		Also, dimishing returns kick in.
@Tiki1125 @nickapls @YALiberty Donald and Hillary *both* ignored most states during the 2016 campaign, strategically concentrating on states based on "battleground" status.		Obama tried to pay at least token attention to every state, with his #50state strategy. Still *mostly* concentrated on battlegrounds.
This for all #ElectoralReform. Major structural changes that are hard to make don't happen without broad support.

@nickapls @YALiberty Thought about it a little bit more, and this is a really good way to put it.
@ElectionBabe It shouldn't be that way. For that matter, the voters getting inappropriately scrubbed didn't do anything wrong - it's not their fault that someone else with a similar name moved somewhere.		Automatic voter registration is really the way to go.
@smotus You can call it scarring or pragmatic skepticism.		I'd call the steady drumbeat of Hillary Clinton's inevitable victory narrative an example of a self-defeating prophecy. Taking a #BlueWave for granted is a good way to mute it to a #BlueRipple. https://t.co/h6hseWrw0A

@YALiberty 3. This happens over and over again, for two reasons.		First, large blocs of votes are disproportionately more powerful. 30 votes in 1 bloc is far more potent than 30 votes divided into 8 separate blocs. 		Second, small states tend to be further from the center, whatever it is.
@YALiberty 2. FL &amp; PA have been absolutely important in all recent close elections (2000, 2004, and 2016). Presidential candidates tried hard in both and would have won if they won both - in each of those three cases.		Of course, in 2004, another large state (OH) had a closer margin.

@ConceptualJames I'm not saying nothing is ever wrong in physics research, but there's nothing remotely parallel to the psychology replication crisis or the steady stream of biomedical retractions going on in physics.
@ConceptualJames Possible difference (other than the recent CERN thing):		Many large fields have a network of people trying to deal with bad science / empiricism problems in the field. Those networks provided a more positive perspective on #SokalSquared.		Physicists don't. (Hence physics envy).
@politicalseason @nhannahjones @JanellRoss Yeah.

It might be a little bit embarrassing for Harvard to admit they do it, but doubt that will change.
@jennifernvictor I can see an argument for it, but I just don't think the numbers meet.		Democrats are way more into nominating women right now (probably for at least another few cycles) and Hillary Clinton was within a Midwestern meteorological sneeze of victory last time.

@learner_ok @SenhorRaposa As the current political geography falls, that would make CA...		... still a "safe state" and passed over except for fundraising purposes. The Democrats would be happy for another 10 votes out of California, but Californians would still feel ignored.		(1/2)
@learner_ok @SenhorRaposa The real issue in the EC isn't the number of seats, it's the distance from the national median. If CA was closely contested, it would be incredibly important.		Those extra "Senate" seats only matter about once every century or so.

@joero3 That would be the closest one. It is possible Clinton might have won a popular vote if he had enough of a home-state margin in New York. He probably would have polled terribly in GA/NC/SC, though.
@mnemosyneous I.e., there are some caveats to be had about "Was Madison presenting himself in a better light?" since he's the biggest single source for what was said. 		Regarding (2)... I can't say I do. If you elaborate a little, I might later.
@mnemosyneous 1. Source for everything at the Constitutional Convention is Max Farrand's Records of the Federal Convention of 1787.		I cut out almost all the discussion of franchise, I think, but Ratcliffe's "The Right to Vote and the Rise of Democracy" (2013) has really been my go-to lately.
@crbrendemuehl Well, there are things in it that are correct. Such as - yes, the EC wasn't designed to protect slavery.
@joero3 Since there weren't really all that many presidential elections in the 1796-1856 span, I think it's pretty easy to make the case of (2) - many of those elections were not very close.
@joero3 After looking at it, my position is that both of those arguments are incorrect. I.e.,:		(1) The EC was not intended to protect slavery.	(2) The EC did not have any protective effect on slavery compared to the alternate voting systems most likely to have been used.
@crbrendemuehl (6) Calling something a "stabilizing influence" in the same essay you decide that it was responsible for starting a civil war is really jarring.
@crbrendemuehl (3) Big cities had nothing to do with it. There weren't any in 1787.		(4) Big cities *have* subsequently had enormous influence in the #ElectoralCollege, in particular see NYC's reign of peak power in 2nd half of 19th century.		(5) The EC wasn't expected to narrow candidates to 2
@crbrendemuehl Lots wrong with this. 		(1) "Core of our system of federalism." No. It was shoehorned in by committee during the last two weeks as a last-ditch compromise and never worked as intended.		(2) James Wilson, not James Madison, invented the #ElectoralCollege.

@ShellenbergerMD @clarkamiller @stewartbrand (3-cont) I.e., really weird things can happen with energy prices.		For all I know, California might be coping with another round of market manipulations that haven't come to light yet. Just a caveat. Probably (1) &amp; (2) on the balance, but I wouldn't be so quick to rule out (1).
@ShellenbergerMD @clarkamiller @stewartbrand (3) One factor you haven't mentioned - energy "markets" are not really perfect matches for the EMH. (Remember Enron? I think a lot of Californians do.) It's a heavily regulated market with an assortment of middlemen, high-bar entry stuff, minimal root consumer mobility, etc.
@ShellenbergerMD @clarkamiller @stewartbrand (2) Yes, the time cycles tied to wind and solar are troublesome, and to really leverage that into a grid (or a complete off-grid home system) you need to be able to *store* energy cheaply. This is hard on the grid level (although basically reverse-hydro isn't a bad solution).
@ShellenbergerMD @clarkamiller @stewartbrand You ask "why?"		(1) You can't discard the hypothesis that nuclear energy makes things cheaper based on the price of replacement fuels - with nuclear, the big cost is the initial build, operating costs are super low.

@ShellenbergerMD @clarkamiller @stewartbrand "If it uses and stores electricity, and is out in the sun, I should put some cheap solar cells on it" isn't the worst idea in the world. Especially as the technology improves.		I would like to see more investment in nuclear, though.
@ShellenbergerMD @clarkamiller @stewartbrand The nice things about rooftop solar are that it doesn't require any added land at all and can be part of an off-grid build. It's making use of a surface that's already been built (and therefore already part of the impermeable footprint of civilization).

One of the most universally agreed-upon evaluations - among experts - is that a simple plurality vote is bad.		Finding agreement on what should replace it was hard in the 1780s when Borda and Condorcet published their most famous work on the topic, and remains hard today.

@il_american @SenhorRaposa The only caveat is that stripping US citizenship from people who do not renounce it in favor of PR citizenship isn't fair.		There's a humanitarian argument (Puerto Rico would struggle economically without U.S. money) but the U.S. can continue to subsidize PR and trade. (2/2)
@il_american @SenhorRaposa There is a clear argument for why Congress should not admit Puerto Rico as a state without a clear popular mandate in Puerto Rico: That would be seizing an unwilling subject.		There is no similar argument against granting Puerto Rico independence unilaterally. (1/2)
@il_american @SenhorRaposa I don't think it really should require near-unanimous support, or that a percentage threshold is the best way to measure that.		Take Puerto Rico. The 2017 referendum, at 97% pro-statehood, showed really only that the opposition parties could effectively command a boycott.

Just wanted to point out that the whole "big state = urbanized state" thing is a modern phenomenon, and the free state population advantage didn't come around until later (after the midwest grew some and NY finally banned slavery).
@Thurguston1 @Tropicalantix @Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 Well, that's using the 1790 census figures for the then-13 states.
@Tropicalantix @Thurguston1 @Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 Hang on one minute.		Virginia was the largest state in the country, even *without* counting the slave population, and expected massive growth. 95% of the population of the country was rural, including most of New England.

@Thurguston1 @Tropicalantix @Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 The #Senate was intended to be undemocratically dominated by small states. It was also intended to be a deliberative slow-moving body largely unresponsive to the public sentiments of the moment, like #HouseOfLords.		Unlike the #ElectoralCollege, it has often worked as intended...
@Thurguston1 @Tropicalantix @Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 That disproportion in the Senate is normal.		In the 1st United States Congress (1789-90), 27% of the population controlled 54% of the Senate.		12th Congress (1811-2): 23% controlled 50%.		32nd Congress (1851-2): 22% controlled 52%. 		67th Congress (1921-22): 18% controlled 50%
@Tropicalantix @Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 It was a major consideration, but they expected the #ElectoralCollege to be dominated by large states.		For that reason, when the House votes between the top candidates from the EC, it's a 1-state 1-vote rule. That was the necessary compromise to get agreement.

@GeekyConserv @Manson32 @deepwatermike @TaylorSwiftCon2 @Ocasio2018 If I may, I'd like to tie this back in to the #ElectoralCollege.

@liverpool_matt @Manson32 @barbaricblog @deepwatermike @TaylorSwiftCon2 @Ocasio2018 Historical footnote: Elbridge Gerry wanted the president to be elected by the governors themselves, with the governors' votes being weighted by the size of their state. (This idea did not get far at the #ConstitutionalConvention, but he did propose it.)
@deepwatermike @TaylorSwiftCon2 @Ocasio2018 It doesn't quite cook out that way. Power has to do with positioning, and having a larger bloc amplifies power. If CA was a swing state, it would eclipse Florida and Ohio and dominate the system.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@deepwatermike @TaylorSwiftCon2 @Ocasio2018 The problem with that is that New England was as sharply opposed to the idea of a popular vote as the South.		A popular vote was too radical for most of the Founding Fathers. James Madison and the Pennsylvania delegation liked it,
@Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 It may seem strange now, but Congress electing the president was in basically in every draft of the Constitution up until the last two weeks of the #ConstitutionalConvention.
@Mirobertson709 @Ocasio2018 It isn't. It's not about cities, either.		The main concern of the #Framers was the conflict of interest in Congress electing the POTUS.		They rejected a popular vote because they didn't trust it. New England's delegates combined with the South's delegates in rejecting it.
@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa This only applied to the states formed from the NWT, and was violated - Illinois was admitted under the 60K limit (shenanigans). American Samoa and Northern Marianas are both under 60K pop, but match actual population of Illinois in 1820 census after statehood.
@politicsluo @SenhorRaposa Clarifying the "implied minimum": 		The Constitution says "The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative," i.e., implied min 30K.		The Northwest Territory Ordinance, OTOH, set a 60K min.

The #ElectoralCollege really *does not do anything good* on a systematic basis.		If you liked the outcome in 2016, feel lucky that the cards happened to fall a way you liked, because the cards fall pretty chaotically.
I've said it once and I've said it again: Electing the wrong president is a lot more expensive than holding recounts or even re-votes or runoff rounds. It can (and will) cost you a lot more than the expense of updating your system to something better, #RankedChoiceVoting. https://t.co/JQtzxJA3w6
@aaronvandorn @gelliottmorris For the House advantage, all that needs to stay the same is that the densest inner cities stay massively more +D - that's just one feature of the geography. That advantage depends on less.
@aaronvandorn @gelliottmorris You can't gerrymander states.		Could I be wrong about which advantage will last? Yes. If literally nothing changes in the current trends and current political alignments, the Senate becomes a long-term Republican minority holdout.
@aaronvandorn @gelliottmorris ... which means that gerrymandering, or even simply *normal districting* in some cases, will easily pack urban voters densely in very lopsided +D districts.		Yeah, the numbers look striking at the moment, but it's unusual.
@aaronvandorn @gelliottmorris Vermont. Small, white, rural, old... more Democratic than California. Texas. Large, growing... notoriously Republican.

@grisaitis @JMilesColeman 7 incumbents, not 6, sorry. Can't count well.		That leaves FL and AL as the two odd cases. There are probably interesting things particular to both of those elections. In Florida, the outgoing Democratic governor was running for the Senate seat. (2/3)
@grisaitis @JMilesColeman It's a good question, so let's look at it. My first prior is that we're talking mostly incumbency advantages.		We only have 9 purples on the map.

@know1intrinsic @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery You have it backwards. By *keeping* the #ElectoralCollege, you give power to small "key" areas of the country in each electoral cycle.		It's no less "mobocracy," as the electors are chosen by popular vote and bound by a combination of laws and conventions.
@know1intrinsic @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Ever heard of #TammanyHall? That was a New York City institution. Tammany Hall got to affect *presidential politics*, because New York decided *a lot of elections.*		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E		Name a major city.

@know1intrinsic @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery I'm not saying metro areas should decide the election.		I'm saying that they have done so. The last election, for example? The margins in PA, MI, and WI would have been in Clinton's favor if she performed at Obama levels in Milwaukee, Detroit, and Philadelphia metro areas.
@know1intrinsic @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery That is no less true of the Electoral College... and the Electoral College's winner-take-all-rule effectively amplifies the margin in those concentrated areas.		New York has decided more elections than any other state by reason of size.
@know1intrinsic @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery Without the #ElectoralCollege, presidential candidates would need to campaign everywhere. It's not like Wyoming is an expensive ad market.		*With* the #ElectoralCollege, they only campaign in about 1/4 of all states... and that means a few large cities have disproportionate say.
@know1intrinsic @MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery The Founding Fathers did not expect electors to be...		...chosen by statewide popular votes.	...treated as anonymous proxies, rather than chosen on their own merit.	...coerced by state laws.		Also, they expected many #HouseContingentElections.

@DonnaDiva @LemieuxLGM There are people who want universities to engage in some kind of "due process" before expulsion happens for anything (e.g., via an honor court system).		There are also people who want universities uninvolved when it comes to other criminal offenses (e.g., underage drinking).
@DonnaDiva @LemieuxLGM Well, to do so, they'd have to also agree that cheating should become a criminal offense. 		It's not hard to find people saying that universities keep their nose out of punishing students for other offenses handled by courts - I'm thinking in particular of underage drinking...
@DonnaDiva @LemieuxLGM I've reported students for cheating several places. Some administrations will just shove it under the rug and do nothing. Others make basically a court system ("honor court") complete with hearings and a jury of peers.
@DonnaDiva @LemieuxLGM Universities are very cautious about expelling students for cheating because students can (and do) sue for being wrongfully expelled. Can even sue for being unfairly flunked out of a course.		Admin try to placate angry faculty but avoid lawsuits. Cheaters are rarely expelled.
@Polit_eurOpines My immediate guess would be that it's because that was part of West Florida. Something of a different antebellum settlement and development pattern.
@DouthatNYT They don't *have* to vote for anyone they don't think is qualified to be a Supreme Court justice. Really. There aren't any rules saying they're required to rubber-stamp the President's choices just because he belongs to the same party.
Counterpoint: If they are now competitive, they were already competitive - competitive is what *could* happen.

@djaznh @PatrickGman @FoxNews @BryanDeanWright @HillaryClinton @DNC Yup, I'm game :)
@djaznh @PatrickGman @FoxNews @BryanDeanWright @HillaryClinton @DNC No, it really doesn't. It puts a lot of power in the hands of voters in key highly populated states.		Which *usually* have been close-fought battlegrounds. The situation we have right now where three of the largest four states are "safe" states is historically unusual.

@BuzzSkedeebeck The Connecticut Compromise was designed for Congress, specifically.		#RogerSherman and other small-state types demanded (and got) an equal vote in the #HouseContingentElection, because they expected large states to dominate the #ElectoralCollege.		And large states have done so.

@BuzzSkedeebeck You have that backwards.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@BjBadger2wisky No, and no.		First, it has jack to do with suppressing the urban vote. The Founding Fathers decided not to do that. Second, historically, the #ElectoralCollege has been dominated by New York. 		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@BuzzSkedeebeck That's not how that works.		Abolishing the #ElectoralCollege means every voter counts equally. Retaining it means that voters in key states ... historically, this usually HAS BEEN #NewYork ... count for more, and everybody else counts for less.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E
@minervaneryse No, it is not. (Also, those numbers are wrong, Hillary won about 500 counties, not about 50.)		#NewYork has, in fact, decided more presidential elections than any other state. It's not even close.		https://t.co/uBPYYkoY4E

As is usually the case when you run the numbers on the history, there are a few little surprises in there.
There's surely another usable power metric out there for analyzing the history of the #ElectoralCollege, but fifteen metrics is surely enough, at least for tonight.
@Hazzle8 @ByronYork https://t.co/deMcE47a4F		"If, when meeting people with doctorates, you’re unsure how to address them, “Dr.” is always correct."		There is no real standard protocol dictating that one refer to only MDs as "doctor" in a non-academic setting.
@boy75_the @GlassCeiling20 @MistyRosas @smizoker @EdKrassen Never is a very long time.		It took over 200 years to ratify the 27th Amendment, but it eventually happened.
@GlassCeiling20 @MistyRosas @boy75_the @smizoker @EdKrassen The #ElectoralCollege very nearly caused Bush to lose in 2004 in spite of having a clear margin in the popular vote. About a hundred thousand more votes for Kerry in Ohio would have done it. Seems myopic to support it based on how it happened the last time.
@boy75_the @GlassCeiling20 @smizoker @MistyRosas @EdKrassen The #ElectoralCollege actually tends to do that sort of thing. California, NY, and Texas is passe, but it used to happen. Lately it's been more Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
@PatriotPennsy @LindaSuhler @PatriciaLRiver5 @HillaryClinton The #ElectoralCollege was not in any way designed to block the power of urban voters. Nor does it really do so in the long run, for that matter.		https://t.co/RAfz4DNPKd
@smizoker @MistyRosas @boy75_the @EdKrassen The #ElectoralCollege was an experimental feature of the #Constitution. It came about because there was a lot of disagreement about how to handle electing a president. It was an untested experiment, and did not work out as intended.		Even very bright people can get things wrong.

@jennifernvictor On the one hand, not many people change their minds between "vote for D" and "vote for R." On the other hand, the impact of a conversion is doubled (+1 &amp; -1).  On the gripping hand, nonvoting can be a decision based on changing one's mind.

@jaydanku @MarilynB777 @realDonaldTrump In 1796, it was large state Virginia on one pole, large state Massachusetts on the other, and the election was fought out in the other two large states between them - New York and Pennsylvania.
@jaydanku @MarilynB777 @realDonaldTrump Nope. But if / when NY becomes a swing state again, it'll be one of the powerful battleground states again, like PA today. Most of the battleground in the #ElectoralCollege consists of the more moderate half of the largest states. (True in 1796, true today.)
@RealPaulMcFreid Because having Congress elect the president would pose a conflict of interest. :)
@MarilynB777 @jaydanku @realDonaldTrump Strange but true fact: New York has, thanks to the #ElectoralCollege, decided more elections than any other state.		The EC made #TammanyHall important in presidential politics, to put a precise nose on that.
@Arnold07358256 @TedKSeastrom It's not obvious, but the #ElectoralCollege does not actually help small states.		It's the large swing states that hold the power within the EC. Florida in 2000, Ohio in 2004. Et cetera.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p

@AllieFontana @AstoriaTom @jbarro @aalali44 It was his; but it was very far from his alone. If other Democratic senators had not publicly pushed him to resign, I doubt he would have, short of a bad end to his requested investigation.		Though I don't know whether or not that investigation would have ended badly for him.
@PragPop_ Looks pretty sensible to me at first glance
@AstoriaTom @jbarro @aalali44 See, and then there's this side of the argument - that if Franken had gone through a lengthy ethics at his own invitation, he would be in a good position to insist that Kavanaugh needed the same level of scrutiny that he was willing to invite.
@jbarro #CoryBooker wouldn't be asking pointed questions of #BrettKavanaugh , #AlFranken would be instead. 		A few extra cries of "hypocrite" from Republican talking heads aimed at Franken, instead of all the other Democrats they're calling hypocrites instead. Not really much difference.

@ChrisFredbeck @meelar @ezraklein To be perfectly direct, the idea that electors would exercise their own judgement was already being undermined in the 1796. Since the presidential elector serves no other function, they were chosen based on who they were expected to vote for.
@haroldpollack @ezraklein The states have gone as far as to try to restrain the electors from acting on conscience.
@AlanSilverleib @ezraklein Yeah, me too. 		Minor point - they didn't envision state legislatures choosing the electors; they just couldn't agree on the method of choosing electors. (Hence the "in such manner as.")

@SeamusNorth @DrunkOnArrival @BearingTruth @LeonardNorthcu1 @StankSuzette @realDonaldTrump 1.

@npvgrassroots @flybabymoni @TaraRoss @prageru @DennisPrager @NatlPopularVote @cgpgrey This is exactly correct. It's way easier for fraud to flip battleground states with a narrow margin than to flip the overall national vote. If the controversies of Florida in 2000 are too close to the present to be objective about, look back at 1876.
@flybabymoni @npvgrassroots @TaraRoss @prageru @DennisPrager @NatlPopularVote @cgpgrey First, contrary to what many people think, the EC doesn't actually help small states.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p		Second, Montana has almost twice the population of Wyoming with the same # of House reps, so Montanans get a really raw deal in the House and therefore EC.
@flybabymoni @npvgrassroots @TaraRoss @prageru @DennisPrager @NatlPopularVote @cgpgrey It's only triggered once enough states have agreed to the compact to make up a majority of the Electoral College - which means that as long as enough states are in the compact as of the deadline for an election, it effectively becomes a national popular vote.

It would improve upon our current system, though, so I would like to see it succeed.		It's a step forward, and changing the #ElectoralCollege system is very hard.
@TaraRoss To append to that, we do have 3rd party entrants that do get support in the US, and this does cause potentially dramatic effects on EC totals. 2000 should come to mind. 1912 and 1860 very illuminating elections to study deeply w.r.t. EC's handling of party fragmentation.
@TaraRoss I don't assume the outcome would be different - I'm saying that given the information of the tallies, the probability that recounting (or other perturbations, *including* introducing a hypothetical 3rd party candidate) could change the election is higher under EC than NPV.
@TaraRoss @npvgrassroots @flybabymoni @prageru @DennisPrager @NatlPopularVote Lots of political scientists out there argue whether or not EC buttresses 2-party system. It wasn't designed to, but it might. Main Duverger-type effect still expected, but EC unique and stable 2-party systems rare.		Even ours breaks down sometimes, e.g., 1860, 1908, almost 1992
@TaraRoss @npvgrassroots @flybabymoni @prageru @DennisPrager @NatlPopularVote On the issue of voters maybe not voting after an early media call, that's an example of something that doesn't get fixed in a recount (a reason why a runoff or revote is better) and also of chaotic EC - any little *tiny change* in FL was potentially worth 25 electors. (2/2)
@TaraRoss @npvgrassroots @flybabymoni @prageru @DennisPrager @NatlPopularVote I'd read it the other way. There were only three disputed vote totals, and under a NPV, the disputed totals wouldn't matter vs margin. The EC forced them to matter, which meant disputes over votes in 3 states - and a pure EC technical issue in Oregon - created a crisis. (1/2)
@TaraRoss If you hold out for the same level of statistical confidence in outcome that recounting any national election within 1% would give you, you'd have to recount an outright majority of elections, including ones that we don't think of as close. (2/2)
@TaraRoss Fair enough - not everyone has a database of elections sitting in front of them. Here's the eight whose official counts were within 1% of the total population of the key states as a group:		2000, 1884, 1960, 1948, 1916, 1876, 2016, and 1976. 		Still an easier than 1%. (1/2)
@CircuitSwan The clatter of a manual typewriter, the breath of a flute, the slice of a sword, the taste of truth, and a half-full glass of love.
@BTreenew I am. I'm also precise with numbers. Mathematician, y'see.		Clinton won somewhere around 500 counties. 487 is the most common citation, but appropriate numbers vary (do you count parishes, independent cities, et cetera). Fewer than Trump did, but far more than 57.
@TaraRoss (At least under usual statistical assumptions. If you put credence in claims of Texas having been rigged in favor of Kennedy in 1960, you might change that to 4 out of 6 based on your beliefs.)
@TaraRoss I will repeat a central point to be crystal clear: In 5 out of those 6 elections, a national recount would have been *more likely* to change the outcome of the Electoral College than to change which candidate won more votes nationally.
@TaraRoss Take 1960; second closest election by popular margin.		Reversal of EC could have occurred by &lt;19K votes out of ~6.9M (&lt;.3%).		Reversal of NPV needed &gt;100K out of ~69M (~0.15%). Less likely!		Why? Counting errors happen in both directions, so % error drops with more votes. (5/5)
@TaraRoss The fact that we have not completed recounts in cases where it is appropriate (e.g., the halted 2000 recount in Florida) while a reformed system might include a systematic provision for recounts (or revotes]) not a legitimate argument against reform. (4/)
@TaraRoss Normal counting error is proportionate to the square root - not a flat percentage. The 2016 election is perfectly fine as an example - a three-state recount reversal with three narrow margins is unlikely, a three-million vote national recount reversal is prohibitively rare. (3/)
@TaraRoss Yes, 6 elections since 1828 would have triggered a 1% national margin threshold.		In that same window, 8 elections have been determined by a combined margin in the closest states of less than 1% ... and a reversal from a state level 1% recount is more likely. Basic stats. (2/)
@TaraRoss "Need" is a tricky word. It's a matter of preferred confidence in your outcome. You're comparing apples to oranges when comparing the status quo to a 1% recount threshold, because the status quo doesn't have the equivalent of a 1% national recount threshold. (1/)
@NoWayGray A system does not need to be random to be chaotic. Weather, for example, changes on deterministic physics; a small error in measuring today's weather leads to a large error in predicting next week's weather.		The EC amplifies small effects (e.g., ballot design in Palm Beach).
@npvgrassroots @flybabymoni @prageru @DennisPrager @TaraRoss @NatlPopularVote Worth noting, by the way, litigated counts are ones that were *very likely to reverse the election* as such.		Even today, it's impossible to be know if key electors from key states went to the true popular vote winner in that state in 1876 or 2000.

@NoWayGray No, it's pretty much a plain mathematical consequence of how the structure works. Chaos is the result of amplifying small differences.		When states assign electors, they take small margins (e.g., 2.1% in Ohio in 2004) and amplify them to large margins (20-0).

@flybabymoni @npvgrassroots @prageru @DennisPrager @TaraRoss The vast majority of elections 1828-present have given results more sensitive to state recounts under EC than national recounts of NPV. (1880 notable exception.) This is true whether we talk raw votes or the typical expected statistical variation from recounts (~sqrt(N)). (2/2)
@flybabymoni @npvgrassroots @prageru @DennisPrager @TaraRoss I'd like to comment in particular about the "closer" issue.

That means that EC margins are usually more sensitive to small changes and recounts than NPV margins, i.e., *closer.* (1/2)

@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll From 1828 forward, the difference between the #ElectoralCollege and democracy is mostly "noise," i.e., the #ElectoralCollege functions mostly as a slightly more fraud-and-error-sensitive version of a plurality vote.		It doesn't fulfill democratic goals *or* the Framers' goals.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (9) Sorry for the long rant, but much of that article is wrong, whether in its reading of the Framers' intentions or in its understanding of the mathematical nuts and bolts that drive power in a voting system like the #ElectoralCollege.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (8) In order to win a popular vote "because of" lopsided margins in a few areas, you have to also win large minorities of the population everywhere else. At the end of the day, no matter how you cut it, it's easier to win with "narrower" support in the EC than in a PV.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (7) There's only been 1 election in US history where a national recount would have been more likely to flip the popular vote than a state recount to flip the Electoral College. In any case, the cost of a recount, revote, or runoff is far less than the cost of the wrong president.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (6) Let's talk NYC. Thanks to the Electoral College, NYC has decided a lot of elections. See, for example, 1880-1888. (Even 1876 would not have been competitive if Tilden, from NY himself, didn't have strong NYC numbers.)
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (5) Television advertising on a per-capita basis is if anything more expensive in densely populated markets, and presidential candidates only pay attention to about 1/4 of the states - mostly larger states.		There's no reason to buy the argument that candidates will focus on NYC.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (4) Strongly regionalized candidates do quite well in the Electoral College. 1860 is a good example of that that I was just writing about on Medium (see most recent post there) - Douglas had broad support and got pasted by sectionalist Breckinridge in the EC.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (3) Even if no candidate wins a majority in the Electoral College, someone does become president. See 1824. This is actually how the Framers expected the system to work most of the time.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (2) The Framers thought the Electoral College would be dominated by large states. This is clear in Madison's notes of the debates. As a sop to small states, they would have an equal vote in the House contingent election. The article is completely wrong on that, in other words.
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll (1) There were NOT only three methods considered by the Founding Fathers. E.g., electors, required to be chosen by popular vote by district. Election by governors.		Electors required to be chosen for district was voted down because many Framers distrusted popular voting...
@ShannonSchlafer @JoyPotrykus @LineyRvS @HillaryClinton @ActMeasuresDoc No, the #ElectoralCollege gives control to a "couple of states with large populations" routinely.		2016 - Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. 2004 - Ohio. 2000 - Florida...  that's just in the last 20 years. The history goes way back.
@AstorAaron @Sumter @mattyglesias Although... interestingly... https://t.co/0D9yE0QsGL
@YoavKarny @KatrinaPierson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Although for Jefferson, Jackson, and Lincoln, those were all pretty close losses that made it clear they had the potential to win.		From the linked Wiki page, an interesting bit. https://t.co/n6aaVp4Xt0
@ShannonSchlafer @JoyPotrykus @LineyRvS @HillaryClinton @ActMeasuresDoc They certainly are. They just have very funny rules for measuring popularity. #PledgedElectors
@LouComunale @real_farmacist @realDonaldTrump @Rasmussen_Poll "Otherwise a candidate..." 		First? The #ElectoralCollege is what pushes candidates to only campaign in a quarter of the country. A popular vote would spread that attention out to the whole country.		Second? That is not why we have an #ElectoralCollege.		https://t.co/RAfz4DNPKd
@JuanDP3r3z Mostly because change is hard. Partly because a lot of Republicans mistakenly believes it protects their interests, instead of simply being chaotic - the #NPVIC probably would have passed threshold by now if not for that.
@raulpacheco Oops, I forgot the nifty thing!		North Carolina has an official *system* of long-distance biking routes along certain roads. They're marked with signage, though a lot of people don't know about them. Mostly intended for recreational riding.		https://t.co/sfXZEbwxGJ
@raulpacheco Not to say that there aren't areas that are easier to get around in without a car. Boston in particular is really good, and a certain *subset* of the LA area (but not the whole LA metro area). 		And then NC isn't "very white." Just easy to think that on a quick visit. (3/3)
@raulpacheco Cycling safety and ease depend on knowing the right routes, which is not always easy for a visitor, but people from the area can get around pretty okay (especially for regularly scheduled commutes) with the bicycle + bus combination. Rail would be nice. (2/)
@raulpacheco From extensive experience of mine and of family members who avoided car use, I'm going to disagree on the car part for Raleigh, Durham, Carrboro, and Chapel Hill. Pittsboro, perhaps.		The PART and TTA are both pretty good and the Chapel Hill / Carrboro bus system is *free.* (1/)
@dataandpolitics The 2016 drumroll about Hillary's inevitability seems like it was a self-defying prophecy, and people calling a  #BlueWave a done deal is definitely in the same category.
@jodiecongirl Definitely!
@DMatrixBlog @JhnDaniels @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY I agree that it has no place in the modern world. It didn't really have a functional place in the early United States, either; it just didn't work the way it was intended to.
@DMatrixBlog @JhnDaniels @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY Not really. 		James Wilson of PA was the first to put the EC on the table. PA was among the first states to abolish slavery. Only 2 states voted in favor of the first version of the EC (PA &amp; MD) with the South and New England against.
@DMatrixBlog @JhnDaniels @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY We've had the same two major parties (even though they've completely reshaped their positions) for &gt;150 years now.		In global terms, that's remarkably stable for a political party system, especially when the party has no formal (i.e., Constitutional) power designed in.
@Marianne1018 @GOP There certainly isn't a law against it, and I don't see anything in GOP rules against it. They just haven't voted against an incumbent since ... um ... Chester A. Arthur?		There's also nothing stopping the incumbent from making an independent run for president.
@DMatrixBlog @JhnDaniels @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY That said, it's at least partially right that the EC is much more sensitive to small effects, e.g., a minor party candidate pulling out some support in a closely contested state. The EC as it functions is literally chaotic.
@DMatrixBlog @JhnDaniels @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY (2), (4), and (5) are wholly correct. 		(3) is not an unusual belief among political scientists - the US has a remarkably stable 2-party system, and the EC is one of the unique features suspected of causing it (especially in contrast to plurality with majority runoff). (con't)
@DMatrixBlog @JhnDaniels @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY To correct a couple things in that article:		(1) Right in summary, wrong in details. New England was as vigorously opposed to direct elections as the South. Only the Pennsylvania delegation really supported direct elections. The MA delegation was particularly down on democracy.
@JhnDaniels @DMatrixBlog @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY It had several purposes; the big one was finding a way to finesse the conflict-of-interest issue involved with having Congress choose the president - which was the main alternative as far as the #Framers were concerned.
@JhnDaniels @DMatrixBlog @AngelRiveraLib @InLikeFlynn44 @AlisonForKY No, it wasn't. The #ElectoralCollege was expected to be dominated by large states. E.g., see the description in Madison's notes of how Sherman decided that it was acceptable... namely because the small states would get their turn in the House contingent election.

It can get slightly worse: If you're clever, you can produce a result by creative definition. Researchers are not infrequently clever and not infrequently interested in producing support for some particular answer, especially if paid to do so. (6/6)
Alternate definition gives a different answer. Often can give a different answer using the data already collected - dramatically so - or can lead to really different looking data in the first place.		Now we have contradictory answers to the same plain language question. (5/)
Some of those answers are probably terrible, or at least very disagreeable, and don't really match up to how the word is being used in the question they're directed to. If you're unlucky, this includes the original question. Someone else points out an alternate definition. (4/)
If you're lucky, other people go on to also use that definition to answer similar questions. So now you have a widely circulated definition of what 'segregation' or 'polarization' or 'racism' or 'false' or whatever means, and a bunch of answers relying on it. (3/)
So you come up with this definition. If your background doesn't include much mathematics or philosophy, it's probably deeply flawed, and even if you have a lot of math or philosophy, it still probably has at least one major flaw. Then you use that definition to answer the Q. (2/)
Sometimes, I think the credibility problem of social sciences has a lot to do with definitions.		You want to answer a question that people care about in plain language, but to do so, you have to come up with a more precise measurable definition for the words being used. (1/)
10 out of 11 pres-year governors have net approval ratings that are more than a standard polling error above the average net approval rating.		This level of approval is only seen in 14 out of 39 governors who don't have to face presidential turnout levels.
The difference in gubernatorial net approval ratings right now between governors who have to face presidential-level voter turnout and governors who don't is *10 points* right now. 		If you control for state partisan lean as https://t.co/8m0yNSvC5z does, that gap widens to 11-12.
There are 36 state #gubernatorial races this year. 34 of the governors elected this year will *not* have to face re-election in 2020 when voter turnout will be high.		We ought to #sync it up, folks.
@Vva10967 @jbview The two campaigns were in the same essential position and made similar decisions: I.e., play it out to the very end, until it was *actually* impossible for them to win (not just relatively unlikely). Crazier things happen in party primaries than winning 59%. (3/3)
@Vva10967 @jbview In March, when Clinton's campaign needed only 59% of remaining pledged delegates, they had a serious chance at pulling it off as far as anyone knew. Those scenarios were pretty plausible at the time. It wasn't until early May that it became essentially impossible. (2/)
@Vva10967 @jbview Speak for yourself. I knew delegate math then. Almost certainly, so did people in Clinton's campaign in 2008. It's not hard math - and no, there's no theorem off in the wings saying that a 150 pledged delegate gap is impossible to reverse. (1/)
@Vva10967 @jbview *After* the April 19th primaries, Sanders needed 59% of the remaining pledged delegates for a majority. 		By way of comparison to 2008, Clinton needed 59% of remaining pledged delegates after *March 12th, 2008* for a majority.		Both conceded in June.
@Vva10967 @jbview It only looked impossible if you counted endorsements from superdelegates as a binding pledge of support - which they weren't - and believed that they wanted to have the bad press of having overruled the will of the people. Which goes to show you bought the SD coverage.
@Vva10967 @jbview No, he wasn't "mathematically eliminated in mid-March."		Prior to the New York primary contest (April 19th), he only needed to win 58% of the tail end to win a majority of pledged delegates, which is far from impossible.
@GriffTheImpaler @chrisFnicholson @ProfHansNoel I will put it this way:		A Sanders supporter who thought that Clinton's victory is inevitable may simply not have bothered to vote.		In the primary election, that would net a vote in Clinton's favor. In the general election, that would lose a likely Clinton vote.
@Auagcusn1 @ProfHansNoel And, conversely, the top line number in reporting in 2008 always *excluded* the superdelegates, who - being unpledged - could change their minds at any time. Concrete example:		https://t.co/wHM586fcyy
@jbview I will say that I suspect quite strongly that coverage *hurt* her in the general election. Party loyalists rally around an inevitability to pivot to the general; marginal voters stay home rather than vote for an inevitable they're not excited about. (4/)
@jbview Did the NYT (and more importantly, many other outlets) embracing a position painting Hillary as an inevitable victor help her win the primary? Maybe. Odds were in her favor from the start; OTOH, party loyalists do like to rally around an "inevitable," and it was close. (3/)
@jbview Second, in 2008, most news outlets (yes, including the NYT), kept as their top line of discussions the number of *pledged* delegates, even though superdelegates were discussed, e.g., as in:		https://t.co/wHM586fcyy		Claiming the coverage was no different is plainly wrong. (2/)
@jbview *By the standards of presidential primaries*, the 2016 Democratic contest was a close-fought race. Most presidential primaries are concluded more quickly and with more dramatic-looking margins. (1/)
@arrowman42 @jjhparker @FiveThirtyEight *Bill* Clinton's electoral success involved another "AND" answer to the question of whether to concentrate on "white working class"  OR "diverse urban-centered" voters. 		Also like Obama, he promptly lost his congressional majority in the first midterms.
@arrowman42 @jjhparker @FiveThirtyEight Democrats gained seats in the House, Senate, and state legislatures in 2008 and 2012. (Dropped 1 in gubernatorial in 2012.)		The big losses happened when Obama wasn't on the ballot and Democrats stayed home in the midterms.
@arrowman42 @jjhparker @FiveThirtyEight What did Barack Obama get trying to please everyone? 		In electoral terms, an outright majority of the vote, twice - more in raw numbers, in spite of population growth, than Clinton OR Trump. Massive coattails downballot.		I'd say "be like Obama" seems like good electoral advice.
It's always fascinating to look at how incredibly well-liked Warren G. Harding was while he was still alive.
@JohnHolbein1 @PNASNews Backfire effect dominates, then?
@smotus One of my top Google search results on my name is a blank VT directory page headlined "Dr. Ezra Brown."		My name is not on the page. My name is not in the URL. My name is not in the source code for the page. I never even co-authored with Bud Brown, though he's a great guy.
@drdavidmalet @76Keeper @SocialSciNerd I think it IS an oversight not to specify, and I would hesitate to assume they would say any one thing in particular. I assume they probably would have disagreed vigorously with one another about this, and that it's hard to predict what consensus would have emerged.
@devicerandom @azfaust That might be a healthier model, provided we could cut the length of our programs down. Right now they're designed to take 5-6 years (and in practice frequently take longer).
RT @jamzfive: @scottgoeke @NateSilver538 try this:	https://t.co/ww5aHFd0vu
Writing just a couple short paragraphs about each presidential election really does add up quickly.		Illustrating them will take longer, unless I can be really clever with a good script. And even then...
@azfaust If there's no off-ramp, people get stuck: "Hey, I've spent 3 years here and don't even have a master's degree, if I quit now my resume looks terrible." 		Even if they feel "I'm never going to get a good job in academia," all the other options can look worse than finishing (4/4).
@azfaust I think a lot of people who would be better off not trying to complete a doctorate - who often eventually drop out of doctoral programs - don't know it until much too late. And on the flip, some people who are don't want to sign up for 5+ years until they hit M.A. / M.S. (3/)
@azfaust I don't mean "you get a master's after 4 years after advancing to candidacy." I mean "you get a master's degree after you've done the two years of graduate coursework a normal master's program would require."		Even just having separate doctoral and master's tracks seems bad. (2/)
@azfaust I feel that one of the most important things that is missing is to have a *functional* and *effective* offramp.		E.g., make sure your doctoral program *actually hands out a master's degree* automatically along the way. That's missing in a lot of places. (1/)
@M72798069 @blakeleyhpayne It might be my personal bias, but for reasons like this one, I think the trajectory of an undergrad major in computer science followed by going to graduate school in a social science sounds like a great career plan.
@smotus Most changes to the party nomination processes over the last 226 years have been in the direction of increased democratization and reduced insider power.
Pennsylvania really has been a battleground state amazingly often.		Even in 1792, provided we look at the vice presidential election...
@geareddev @FiveThirtyEight These are some smoothed ones for net approval (ending a few weeks ago).  Alternate hypothesis to eliminate: Polling numbers are more consistent for methodological reasons (polling *has* changed a little bit). https://t.co/GjIkONHRVC
@FiveThirtyEight It's impressive how *flat* the line is. I suspect it's unprecedented.
@whstancil @JFlavin Tell me exactly what you believe integration to be (even if it's access-to-whites as @JFlavin objected to), and I can help you measure it better.		"40% white people" is a not meaningful root definition; it is also at best a crude metric.
@whstancil @JFlavin I'm not saying you're wrong that blacks are experiencing a less positive segregation trend than nonblack nonwhite groups, I'm just saying I'm not convinced the measure given on the topline is the most meaningful measure of such. (2/2)
@whstancil @JFlavin Still a flawed metric. The bright-line issue still matters even if we define segregation in terms of access to white people rather than racial separation. E.g., hypothetical 0 movement + even decline in white pop = artificial trend under the bright-line metric. (1/2)
@whstancil @JFlavin If we had a 39% white-non-hispanic population (which we may at some point in the future) and every neighborhood had exactly 39% white population, we would not want to measure a 100% segregation rate. 		It's a flawed measure.
@whstancil @JFlavin binary relationship between identified groups, i.e., blacks and whites are X level of segregation from one another on a racial basis, Hispanic and Asian ethnicities are Y level of segregation from one another.		Relational network + scalar generalization seems better (2/2).
@whstancil @JFlavin If there weren't, I would say that would be a more segregated situation.		A 50-50 black-Hispanic neighborhood is certainly a long distance in component vector space from an even-mixing prior, i.e., 62-16-13-etc nationally.		You can certainly also measure segregation as a (1/2)
@JFlavin @whstancil I think some of it may be chicken and egg: It's easier to just measure "percent white people" than to calculate and explain a scalar metric that measures the degree to which people are living in own-group neighborhoods. I'd be happy to help a little there. (2/2)
@JFlavin @whstancil When practitioners redefine a term as jargon, it helps create confusion and disconnect b/w experts and lay people (and experts in other fields). 		"Segregation" means separation ordinarily, so a metric or set of metrics that reflects that more clearly would be better IMO. (1/2)
@fairvote In particular, one should worry that errors without ordinary counting structure error might be much more common in states that resist having recounts....
@fairvote The n=26 sample of statewide recounts is small and not random. I have low confidence in estimates of the actual size distribution of errors for that reason. We won't know breakdown of type and frequency of inaccuracies until recounts are routine.
@fairvote Something fairly significant that is not visible in this report is the expected error structure.		Accidental counting errors accumulate at ~sqrt(N), not ~N (e.g., 0.02%) or ~k (e.g., 1500 votes).
Quantify the democratic mandate of an elected official is more interesting than it looks.		This paper attempts to do it for Supreme Court justices, which is an interesting measure; basically, by max(PresPV,SenPV), Gorsuch has the weakest mandate ever.		https://t.co/srALMMior9
(Similarly, because of the single Maine elector, a completely consistent WTA counterfactual scenario also goes to the House.)
I didn't notice this before, but the fact that two Republican electors from TX did vote against Trump makes a difference between (PA+MI+WI) being a pivotal coalition and (PA+MI) alone being a pivotal coalition, if we're looking at "throw into the House" as a change of outcome.
@BlakeNorthcott Historically, consecutive nominations are uncommon and consecutive wins are rare. 3 in a row with the same author and publisher is unprecedented, and all the more striking because the genre is so much larger than it used to be.
@emayfarris In addition to the other things mentioned, I'd add under "contextualize" making sure they have an idea of how they should expect their job performance to be evaluated (or informally judged) by:		-You, as department chair.	-Various administrators if applicable.	-The job market.

@alexkotch @ThomTillis @SenatorBerger @RepDavidRLewis @SenatorBobRucho I wouldn't go that far - those are victory percentages, not forecast margins, so 63-37 in NC-13 is pretty competitive (20th most competitive House seat in the forecast) - closer than 2:1 odds.		Gerrymandering can backfire. Needs a bigger #BlueWave than currently expected, though.
@KeriLeighMerrit 2. A 19th century unskilled day laborer earned about $1 per day in the South in 1860 (without board). Index on that and take the $130K as gospel, and we discover that today's unskilled day laborers earn $162 per day.		Which I'm pretty sure is not accurate.
@KeriLeighMerrit 1. That figure smells fishy.		The high numbers are calculating *value* and assuming that equivalent to *price*:		"Thus, a measure of the average value of a slave would be the present  value of the net rental cost over the life expectancy of the average slave."		Value, not price!
@micahcohen If the model is saying that there's a 10% chance of swinging (+58D), i.e., a number of states between 1994 (+54R) and 2010 (+63R), that doesn't sound like a terribly impressive #BlueWave.
@KirkNienaber @mattyglesias Free college tuition is a big one.

@amhistory1776 @xargos32 @DesertFloor @tat2d57 @SethAbramson Contrary to whatever you might have picked up in that #8thgradecivics class, the Founding Fathers *expected* large states to dominate the #ElectoralCollege. 		That's why, when nobody gets a majority in the EC, each state gets 1 vote in the House contingent election.
@amhistory1776 @xargos32 @DesertFloor @tat2d57 @SethAbramson Now, notice the giant white areas? Those are states that have yet to be in the sort of decisive position that Florida was in 2000... that Ohio was in 2004... that as a group, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania were in 2016... 		Wyoming has never been in that position.
@amhistory1776 @xargos32 @DesertFloor @tat2d57 @SethAbramson Darker shades represent exercising power more often. Notice something about New York?		New York was the largest state in the country from 1810 to 1960 (ish). Back in those days it was a battleground state, and decided elections very often.
@amhistory1776 @xargos32 @DesertFloor @tat2d57 @SethAbramson You have that backwards. A single small state has been in a decisive position in the #ElectoralCollege once (1876). Small states as a group arguably been decisive up to two more times (1796, 2000).		*This* is the real picture of the history of power in the Electoral College. https://t.co/8HeasS5PaZ
@Browsinaround @HuffPostPol That is not how power works. It's a little more complicated, because electors aren't elected independently by district.		Larger blocs are disproportionately more powerful - and it's all about #battlegroundstates.
It felt really nice to wander down to a university campus and spend some time in a research library digging through articles and wandering the stacks getting distracted. I'd been missing that sort of thing.
@Ham66 @SwankAllison @WhiteWhiskers0 @SenFeinstein The #ElectoralCollege has not worked "exactly as designed" for a VERY long time.
@Dr_EDR @vulcanhammer Power is slightly more complicated than that. A larger bloc of electoral votes has more power per electoral votes. (E.g., a 270 vote bloc would have 100% of the power, not just 50.2% of the power.)		It's about battleground status, not size. 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@DaveHaase1 @SethAbramson That is NOT why we have an #ElectoralCollege.		The Framers weren't thinking about rural voters when they set that up. Not at all. The couple thousand pages of documentation on what was discussed at the Constitutional Convention lacks any such idea.		https://t.co/RAfz4DNPKd

The level at which we can expect attacks on our election process - domestic or foreign - is at the counting level. Always has been.		Individual voter fraud, the traditional bogeyman, takes a lot of people-hours. Compromising the counting process is much easier. https://t.co/YINYLg4JMq
@loisbeckett @onthemedia To me, it seems disingenuous to describe the 1965 immigration law as an example of "been there, done that" white supremacist policy.		Southern segregationists - i.e., overt white supremacists - actively opposed the law's passage. White nationalists of today hate its effects.
@CShentrup @fairvote The example voter has one reason to vote D+G (hedging against G loss) and another reason to vote G only (to maximize effect towards G win).		The system works best when on average voters approve of half of their options, but behaviorally, bullet voting happens a lot, sadly.
@GuyAPerson @fairvote Back in my student days, I *did* get a couple of on-campus clubs to adopt approval voting "correctly," but those cases had some unusual characteristics. E.g., auditioning for solos within an a capella group. ~5-10 candidates, ~12-16 voters, and strong bottom-rank prefs.  (2/2)
@GuyAPerson @fairvote There are some professional societies that have used approval voting for a while (starting in the 1980s). Almost all the case studies show very high rates of bullet voting, even with expert voters (e.g., SC&amp;W society). (1/2)
@fairvote Very typical example of approval voting leading to near-plurality voting behavior. *If* you can train voters out of bullet voting, approval voting can work well (particularly for very large preliminary rounds when meaningfully ranking candidates is hard), but that's not easy.

@Mikanojo @YouSoStupid1 @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton This affects elections for the House of Representatives and state legislatures, but not generally the #ElectoralCollege, since very few states choose electors by district. #Gerrymandering *is* quite important, but the EC's problems are its own.
@seandayley @bpjauburn @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @ajplus @HillaryClinton The #ElectoralCollege wasn't *designed* to protect "minority states" or small states. 		The House contingent elections were supposed to fulfill that role.
@Mikanojo @YouSoStupid1 @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton The #ElectoralCollege *does* favor large states - just not large *safe* states. So, for example, Florida decided the 2000 election, but small swing states (e.g., New Mexico) and large non-swing states (e.g., New York) were sidelined.		https://t.co/N9dIYHvYFP

The Founding Fathers thought that large states would dominate the #ElectoralCollege, but that most of the time, no one candidate would get a majority.		Small states would then have power in the House contingent election.
@YouSoStupid1 @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton 3. This does not in any conceivable way line up with the wise indirect decision-making described in the #FederalistPapers, nor is it in line with the vision of the Framers that becomes apparent when reviewing records of the original #ConstitutionalConvention.
@YouSoStupid1 @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton 2. The #ElectoralCollege in its modern form (1828-present) acts like "noisy" version of the popular vote, where voters blindly choose slates of electors, whose names are not even listed on the ballot, on the basis that they are pledged to vote for a particular candidate.
@YouSoStupid1 @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton 1. The Electoral College was intended to act as a deliberative filter - a body of wise individuals who would not have any conflicts of interest (as opposed to legislators) and not be easily swayed in ignorance by demagogues (as opposed to the common people).
@Ericestey1 @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton This talking point is false. The Electoral College concentrates power in the hands of a small number of key states, and those key states are very rarely small states. 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@seandayley @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton No, it doesn't. Historically, in fact, the Electoral College gave a huge amount of national influence to New York City, as at the time New York was a swing state - which meant that Tammany Hall could swing a presidential election.
@SarahNSilvestri @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton No, it wasn't. The Electoral College was put in place with the expectation that large states would dominate it. Then small states would have their turn to have a say in the House contingent election.
@Moontalonz @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton You have this backwards.		The #ElectoralCollege makes a small number of states (mostly large) very powerful, and allows presidential candidates to ignore most states. A popular vote would give voters in every state a say.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@DoctorDickey @Mikanojo @the_original_bh @bpjauburn @ajplus @HillaryClinton This is not why we have the Electoral College.

@janewordsmith @tjvalenti @GranJanis @Richard_Sammon @shady_simpleton @Heather3E8i8 @ReneeCloyd1 @BMLewis2 @christinawilkie We very nearly had what would be called a parliamentary system (executive elected by legislature), but it would still have had our more difficult removal process (impeach+convict rather than "at pleasure"). YMMV, though Congress wouldn't have elected Trump.
@AnneTheWriter1 @Bugl3t @WG_Blue1 You don't need a #ConstitutionalConvention to submit an amendment; you can also do it with 2/3 of both houses of Congress. 		The #ElectoralCollege is a bad system, and it should be abolished. Its operation can also be modified by the states, e.g., by #NPVIC.
@IanStark @NateSilver538 Wouldn't be surprised, but it's also traditionally thought that being in office has some geography-insensitive advantages. That gets you a small permanent staff, free mailings, free travel, presumably easier access to donors and interest groups, et cetera.
@jdavidsonlawyer Not the perfectly normal end of Obama's "honeymoon" early approval ratings, much less by the *effect* of a scandal tied to Bush II's administration that broke two months into his presidency *on* those approval ratings.
@jdavidsonlawyer So we have an understanding of what factors are meaningful and what are simply ordinary.		Republicans holding lots of state governments recently? Heavily related to turnout (ordinary patterns that happen to align more with partisanship in that direction) and gerrymandering.
@rjgstone @profmusgrave I agree with this - most students don't really have good information about whether or not a prof is good *for them* until after taking a class with them. If I had been registering for classes based on campus gossip, I would have avoided profs I ended up liking.
RT @NateSilver538: FWIW, as I've been very deep into the weeds researching and coding 538's House model—yep, it's coming soon!—I've become…
@jdavidsonlawyer Now, if you want to see what it looks like for a president to lose the faith of the people over time in terms of approval ratings... not all presidents leave office on an ascending note like Obama and Reagan. https://t.co/pOPFFH9bSy
@jdavidsonlawyer Not before the 1982 elections. 		The first set of midterms fall around the 700 day mark on this graph - Reagan hit bottom shortly after that. He recovered later and enjoyed immense popularity mid-term, but Republicans still went on to lose the Senate in the 1986 elections. https://t.co/0XdERLspNc
@jdavidsonlawyer If you look at a lot of presidential approval ratings, you realize an early "honeymoon" period is normal.		Other presidents have seen more dramatic declines in popularity over the course of their presidency.
@jdavidsonlawyer Read the article. It's comparing 1994 to *other midterms*. Turnout was way lower than in 1992 or 1996.		I'm not saying Gingrich did nothing in 1994. The gains that Gingrich made in 1994 turned out to be long-term gains for the Republican party - new reliable midterm voters.
@jdavidsonlawyer That's not what that graph says.		AIG bonus scandal hit in March. Obama's approval rating spent the next couple of months climbing from 60 to 65%.		https://t.co/MTjCiEMsQn		Those dips below 50% approval were in 2011 and 2013-2014.
@jdavidsonlawyer "Why" is because voters' interests are tied to how much exciting stuff is on the ballot and what they know about. Presidential elections bring people out to the polls who don't otherwise vote. More people know what's going on in a presidential election year.
@jdavidsonlawyer So does that mean you think low voter turnout in 1982 and 1986 meant that Ronald Reagan was ineffective as a president and as a leader of the Republican party?
@jdavidsonlawyer @cmMcConnaughy For that matter, anyone following the AIG bonus controversy ought to have known that (A) Bush, not Obama, was president when AIG was bailed out and (B) Obama very publicly objected to the bonuses.
@jdavidsonlawyer @cmMcConnaughy Then why did voters similarly not turn out in, say, 1982? 2010 turnout was normal for a midterm.		Simpler explanation: Turnout was low because it was a midterm election, and the voters reliably turning out (e.g., old people) were more Republican than the general electorate.
@jdavidsonlawyer @cmMcConnaughy By contrast, if you look at the total drop in Obama's support in NC from 2008 to 2012, it was only 1.35 points. "Democrats stay home" is a boring headline. It's normal to see turnout lower in midterms, and lower turnout currently tends to mean a more Republican electorate. (2/2)
@jdavidsonlawyer @cmMcConnaughy The results of the various 2010 elections had little to do with AIG bonuses. They had a lot to do with lower turnout.		Here's a benchmark from the US Senate seats in NC.		Dole *lost* in 2008 with 1.9 million votes in 2008. Burr *won* in 2010 with 1.5 million votes. (1/2)
@jdavidsonlawyer @cmMcConnaughy For state legislatures, in addition to the low turnout issues, Republicans are in a demographic position to perform very effective gerrymandering with tiny little state legislative districts, and were in a strong position in the 2010 Census redistricting cycle.
@jdavidsonlawyer @cmMcConnaughy I'm pretty sure that people are studying that... on state-level gov'ts:		Gubernatorial elections are less synchronized with presidential elections (22% vs 50%) than Senatorial elections, which drives down turnout and thereby favors Republicans. (1/2)
@SocialSciNerd Doesn't stop at the poverty line, either. Part of how the rich get richer is that they can basically make money by borrowing. 		A widely publicized example: Zuckerberg taking out a 1% mortgage instead of buying a house outright.
@chloemariahall @AcademicChatter I've used TikZ... I'm in a field where LaTeX submission is typical. If you work in LaTeX markup usually, it's not too hard to pick up. 		Conversely, if you're not working in LaTeX, there is very little reason to ever consider using TikZ.

@charliekirk11 If the Census undercounts non-citizen residents, the major electoral impact isn't going to be on presidential elections. It'll be in the House, as House districts are drawn by population, and accordingly also affected by gerrymandering. (4/4)
@charliekirk11 California isn't the only state with a large non-citizen population. Texas, Florida, and Arizona have a lot of non-citizens as well - both parties get electors out of this. Florida also happens to lead the nation in *citizens* ineligible to vote. (3/4, changed my mind.)
@charliekirk11 Slavery was the original large distortion in the EC, of course. Non-voting slaves got counted (at a discount) for Congressional representation and therefore also the #ElectoralCollege. Today, felon disenfranchisement and incarceration provide distortions as well. (2/3)
@charliekirk11 Resident foreign nationals being counted in the Census is dictated by the Constitution (I.2.3). The fact that the #ElectoralCollege gets distorted by population ineligible to vote is not new (see 3/5ths rule) but is a reason to get rid of the EC. (1/3)
@realtj49er @kelly2277 @were_stiII_here *Trying* to make it work smoothly without causing major crises means sweeping a lot of stuff under the rug and making decisions that - when viewed objectively - are questionable in nature.		The EC doesn't work like it should, and mostly, people don't want it to, either.
@realtj49er @kelly2277 @were_stiII_here The fact that the parties have widely ignored the law when choosing electors to submit to the states, and that this practice has not been frequently challenged, is a very interesting one. 		At the end of the day, the Electoral College *isn't working* as it was supposed to.
@realtj49er @kelly2277 @were_stiII_here In the aftermath of the 1876 election, acceptance of a *former* postmaster in Oregon as qualified to be a presidential elector hinged on proving that he had indeed resigned before serving as an elector.
@realtj49er @kelly2277 @were_stiII_here I don't think it is misleading. "no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or  Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector."		The law is simple; it is not being enforced.

@familyunequal @JonahNRO I'm disappointed to find that it wasn't just selective citation of one of the higher-end estimates in a published paper somewhere without review of the full range of figures or trying to determine which estimate is most credible. 		That would be better if still not good. (5/5)
@familyunequal @JonahNRO In some ways, trusting Caplan as an expert is the mistake. "Hey, this guy is an expert in economics, why go crawling directly into the marriage wage premium literature to see a fuller range of figures?" I can understand someone doing that. The larger narrative is tenuous. (4/5)
@familyunequal @JonahNRO I would not trust that Caplan didn't also make other mathematical mistakes, but given the really small race gap in income in his table, I'm guessing that separating the datasets by race might produce a dramatically different regression. I'll look more at it later. (3/5)
@familyunequal @JonahNRO Caplan saying 44% in his post with a log coefficient of 0.44 is a bad mathematical mistake. Estimating exponents as percents as an approximation falls apart well before that; e^(0.44) = 1.55.  Highest figure I've seen cited in a published paper is 50%. (2/)
@familyunequal @JonahNRO As basically "napkin numbers" from Caplan, yes, that would be shoddy research practice. Yes, it is also higher than most numbers in the literature, from what I can see, and there are mistakes involved. The narrative constructed around those numbers is also questionable. (1/)
@familyunequal @JonahNRO That many y-axis errors in a published book does look painful. I would hope that someone in the editing / copyediting / reviewing / beta-reading process would catch things like that. =/
@familyunequal 44 percent is on the high end of the range of estimates for the marriage wage premium after controls. (Larger than the gross gap, but these things sometimes *increase* after applying controls.)		I would not be surprised if @JonahNRO can produce a credible citation for this claim.
Makes it sort of important to identify and remove unnecessary inconveniences. Like voting on Tuesday, not having automatic registration, or having state and local elections on different dates from federal elections. #WhyTuesday #ElectoralReform
Voters doing more work in the act of voting (ranking instead of picking one, having multiple rounds of an election) makes for a better decision process.		The more work involved with the voting process, the fewer voters show up to vote, which makes for a worse decision process.
@nytimes Finally, something misleading: It talks about the share of *hospital* expenses consumed by administration. Overhead (and arguably also profit) of insurers is an administrative cost from a total costs perspective. The problem is even worse, in other words.
@nytimes Also absent from this articles: The role that insurers play in obfuscating true prices from consumers. Obscuring price information usually leads to a less efficient market. Again, insurers have a perverse economic incentive.
@nytimes Absent from this article: Any mention of the fact that insurers have an economic incentive to put additional obstacles of paperwork between them and payment and the leverage to get away with it.
@MCrowderMeyer (Or at least, the Ph.D. production rate was majority-female, which is not exactly the same thing - women in psychology may have sent out fewer job applications to tenure-track positions. Don't have that at my fingertips.)
@MCrowderMeyer The irony is that *perceptions* of a bias favorable or unfavorably to one sex are not necessarily very closely correlated with the actual existence of the bias. The psychology candidate pool in 1999 was already majority-female.
@MCrowderMeyer I would think so. It's a big visible signal.		I would like to underline, by way of contrast:		https://t.co/N3A6lFn1dQ TT hiring favoring women in STEM fields (2015).		https://t.co/VzjXi8Mr2G TT hiring favoring men in psychology (1999).
@lorenc2 5-10 years as a low-wage grad student is a killer of a fixed cost, too.
@kevindavis338 Yes, they elect by district. In every other state, a geographically concentrated landslide with losses in most counties can win all electors from a state.		(Also, Clinton won 487 counties, not 57 as the above image purports.)
@elfofdoriath9 @gin_and_tacos Ofc, that was almost 10 years ago now, philosophy gets more respect than most others humanities fields, most of the rejections I got were never explained, and I do get the sense that the level of hostility b/w humanities and STEM is in general on the rise.
@elfofdoriath9 @gin_and_tacos YMMV. I had a whole stray degree in philosophy. Out of all the math and physics grad schools I applied to, nobody made out my philosophy background to be a bad thing. Some thought it neat. Got an offer from a top-25 physics doctoral program.
@lorenc2 I agree that we should be trying to bring more socioeconomic background diversity into academia.		I suspect if that's to happen in a meaningful way, pursuing a doctorate needs to become an economically sound choice rather than a net economic negative.
@kevindavis338 After all, he only won PA because of Philly. NC because of Durham. Et cetera. In every remotely close state with major metropolitan inner city areas, you could "account" for the state-level victory with one or two urban landslides in a tiny area of the state.
@kevindavis338 You could write a similar narrative about Obama's victory in 2008 concluding that the Electoral College is terrible because those urban voters handed Obama victory.
@theNorthVision @smerconish The Electoral College does not protect small states, nor did the Founding Fathers intend it to.		The Electoral College does not protect rural states, nor did the Founding Fathers take any steps that were intended to protect rural voters' interests in writing the Constitution.
Mind you, there *were* FFs who expressed a desire to disenfranchise [most] urban voters. They were in the minority and outvoted at the Constitutional Convention.
I see a lot of people telling stories about how the Founding Fathers were carefully setting things up so that rural voters would dominate the system.		This isn't really true. 		https://t.co/RAfz4DNPKd

@Potomacbeat @manar0808 @TheEconomist @vnatale I understand why people think rural voters are helped by the Electoral College - mostly because they think it helps small states. It does not.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@Potomacbeat @manar0808 @TheEconomist @vnatale I disagree.		Rural voters are helped by the Senate (accidentally, not by intention) but not by the Electoral College.		https://t.co/RAfz4DNPKd
@Potomacbeat @manar0808 @TheEconomist @vnatale No.		What I meant: It's the sort of thing that often *sounds* reasonable to many people at first glance. 		Property requirements / thresholds of taxation to vote were common in the early days of the Republic (and in England as well). We moved away from them for very good reasons.
@Potomacbeat @manar0808 @TheEconomist @vnatale No. It is a converse of sorts of "no taxation without representation," but the consequences of "no representation without taxation" seem pretty dire when you dice them down.		Converses can be pretty radically different.
@Potomacbeat @TheEconomist @vnatale This stuff adds to the the poor / rich thing where money is concentrated in urban areas (meaning taxes). It's more expensive to service rural areas.		Driving 100 miles to deliver mail to 100 people will cost more than driving 1 mile to deliver mail to 100 people.
@Potomacbeat @TheEconomist @vnatale Reasonable point of comparison: The state of West Virginia has around 1/3 of the population of the DC metro area. Coincidentally, this is around the fraction of DC area commuters using the Metro.		https://t.co/K8FHR29u3Y		Roads through rural mountains? Comparatively expensive.
@Potomacbeat @TheEconomist @vnatale Transportation is a striking subject when it comes to efficiency of spending, since you mentioned metro trains.		https://t.co/Intmr9GYnn		The greater DC metro area served by transit has a population in the millions. This is chump change.

@JenAshleyWright (3) There's very little difference by sex on opinions about abortion, meaning similar numbers of conservative men and women. 	(4) The religious right is opposed to single women having sex, so the group targeted sees reduction in premarital sex as a good thing.

@KevinMKruse "DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN!" 		I wouldn't call it a million-to-one upset. I wouldn't object to "ten-to-one." The #ElectoralCollege is very sensitive to small perturbations.		PA / WI / MI results easily within the margin of fraud; also not exceptional prediction error from polls.

@cmMcConnaughy So, for example, it may very well be that a relatively dark-skinned white person may have a higher melanoma risk than a relatively light-skinned black person sharing the same skin shade. 		Ofc, that circles back to the issue of recording skin color, not just (convenient) "race."
@AdeAdamson The strength of the time trend in diagnosis among whites (as opposed to mortality) is fascinating. Is that a simultaneous dramatic rise in incidence with a coupled rise in treatment efficacy, or increased diagnosis of melanoma not likely to be fatal?
@cmMcConnaughy Also, there's the swimming pool / beach thing. For other various reasons (ranging from hairstyles to country clubs) everything related to swimming - the major "strip down and go outside getting UV blasted" activity is mostly a white thing. I imagine that affects melanoma risk.
@cmMcConnaughy That said, there's a *major* cultural difference in attitude towards tanning.		White people currently think it is fashionable to go outside and get a tan. Black people have a more complex relationship - a number of moms keep kids out of the sun so they don't get darker.
@nomrahydwor Okay, that makes the model more understandable. Still a bit skeptical - the existing gap only fuels a current ~0.2% gap in T15/B35 (mortality gap for old people pushing the other way), and I would be hesitant to extrapolate blind continuation of those trends.

@NormOrnstein I can buy "older, whiter, and more rural," but I'm having trouble buying any significantly "more male" of a population, especially given that (A) the sex ratio difference is already fairly insignificant and (B) when a population ages it typically trends more female.
@charles_gaba @NormOrnstein Re: the "1-vote" scenario you describe - if only one candidate had votes from electors (and a majority of electors abstained) the House would be forced to have a one-candidate election. The House doesn't get to pick candidates out of a hat - have to be top 3 from EC.
@cmMcConnaughy Even South Africa eventually ended apartheid. I imagine that we would have desegregated public schools in 47+ states by the early 1990s. Maybe I have too lively an imagination. YMMV.		Hard for me to imagine Runyon v. McCrary coming from outside the courts, though.
@Faizy_psy @twoscooters I think the key phrase is "do not particularly care." Doesn't mean want, doesn't mean not want, just doesn't make a clear difference. Seen studies where men pick on age + BMI + (maybe noise?) while women show clear selection on other factors.
@d1Vinman It's not quite that simple. For example, if one state had 270 votes, that state would have 100% of the power, not 50%. In practice #ElectoralCollege power concentrated in voters in largest swing states.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p

@rowdythedude @nazani14 @pptsapper I expect there *were* plenty of Confederate soldiers who wished their legislatures had never voted to secede, but still wanted to stop Sherman from burning Georgia to the ground. Not wanting your home devastated is a powerful motivator.
@rowdythedude @nazani14 @pptsapper Current slave-holding households made up 20% (AR) to 46% (SC) in Confederate states. While most enlistees would not have personally owned a slave (being mostly younger men), most would have had some stake in slavery - relatives or employers who did own slaves.

@JYSexton Not "never." It's been a while, but Eisenhower was fiscally prudent.
@billpresson @LoungingWithL @IamTrentJeter @voxdotcom It can, *if* electors are chosen by district (only Maine and Nebraska, currently, though not unusual in the early days of the EC).
@coachHill80 @voxdotcom Madison, his own notes on his speech at the Constitutional Convention: "The remaining mode was an election by the people, or rather by the qualified part of them at large. With all its imperfections, he liked this best."		Madison *wanted* a direct election for president.
@LawLegalHistory @voxdotcom (26-5-4-1 if we're being very precise about the different alternatives to Adams in NY, 1824 was a messy election.)
@LawLegalHistory @voxdotcom (3) The pro-slavery side were also the populists, and did well in popular votes in mid-Atlantic states. E.g., PA for Jefferson 14-1 in EC in 1796 by vote; 8-7 by legislative appointment in 1800. NY for Adams 26-10 by appointment in 1824, Jackson 20-16 by vote in 1828.
@LawLegalHistory @voxdotcom (2) Madison's speech in favor of direct election (and bemoaning that it would not pass) wasn't *just* about slavery. You had to own land in Virginia (25-50 acres depending on type) in order to vote in Virginia; Northern states w/ similar laws also voted against direct election.
@LawLegalHistory @voxdotcom Interesting article, but I think the expert there has three key things wrong. 		(1) Just because a system functioned a certain way doesn't mean it was designed to. I would say that the Electoral College really didn't work out as planned. We have documentation of intentions.
@JYSexton Responding to a call for race-blind admissions by citing the era of private "segregation schools" sounds like hyperbole.
@SusieFierce @samswey @aliasvaughn Not quite that. Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania are all pretty populous states (most states have &lt;10 EVs), and those were the clutch states in 2016. 		Most tiny states are "safe," like Hawaii (D+18) and Wyoming (R+25). Small states are on both sides, too.
@drvox @rtraister (3/3) The main alternative to the Electoral College at the Convention was election by Congress, already affected by 3/5ths Compromise. Neither the South *nor* New England would back a national popular vote. PA's delegates happily would have, but they were "radicals" then.
@drvox @rtraister (2/3) The Chait article cited as saying the Electoral College was founded on slavery doesn't mention the word slavery. Bad citation practice, mostly, there are plenty of articles with that thesis. Just not that one. That one says it has a racist effect *now*.
@drvox @rtraister (1/) Contrary to what one might believe from the article...		The US Constitution never barred nonwhites and non-males from voting. In the early days of the Republic, voters were not only white men. E.g., blacks could vote in PA, women in NJ. Different states had different rules.
@77rocket That article is wrong. The Founding Fathers did *not* intend for the Electoral College to block the power of large states. To the contrary, they expected large states to overwhelm small states in the Electoral College - which has, in fact, happened more often than not.
@HedyWhite @xiruxi @ChanceBGardener @jeffreynye @jonathanurick @asymmetricinfo While it is true Bill Clinton only won a plurality of the vote in 1992, he *probably* would have won a majority in a two-candidate race.		https://t.co/7m3adePl2A		IMO, it would have been better to have a majority runoff to be sure. The  EC system doesn't handle 3+ candidates well
@jay47711 @ClevelandBro_ns @cryptan @aseitzwald You can believe me as an expert, or consult a history book yourself.		To go nuts and bolts with the convention proceedings, the traditional "gold standard" source is Max Farrand's "The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787."		https://t.co/VxQqe0TMCw
@jay47711 @ClevelandBro_ns @cryptan @aseitzwald And by "malfunction" I refer you to the well-known early disasters leading to the passage of the 12th Amendment. 36 House ballots to break a tie between Jefferson and Burr should certainly qualify.
@jay47711 @ClevelandBro_ns @cryptan @aseitzwald No, that's not what I meant.		What I meant by "mutate" is that the #ElectoralCollege didn't take its modern form until around 1828 (largely winner-take-all plurality vote by state), and that modern form wasn't anticipated at the Constitutional Convention.
@jay47711 @ClevelandBro_ns @cryptan @aseitzwald As a political compromise, it was a successful exercise in sausage-making and sausage-selling; as a piece of political engineering, it was the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.
@jay47711 @ClevelandBro_ns @cryptan @aseitzwald The design of the Electoral College was not brilliance. It was an last-minute addition thrown in by a subcommittee in a piece of complicated political sausage-making. Once put into effect, the EC then proceeded to malfunction and mutate wildly in ways they didn't expect.
@americarocks4u @DavidRomeiPHD It just doesn't happen to be all of the large states every time. TX, NY, &amp; CA may be "safe" on the sidelines right now, but they've all had their turns.
@americarocks4u @DavidRomeiPHD No, it does not. The #ElectoralCollege places the decision in the hands of about a third of the country living in key "battleground" states. Half of all presidential campaign activity takes place in "a few large states" because of the Electoral College.		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin It's the way the EC works that gives them disproportionate power. *Which* of the high-population states are decisive battlegrounds rotates, but it's almost always some of the high-population states that are key battlegrounds in the EC. 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin In terms of what states the EC puts power in, it concentrates power in the hands of a few key states. It's most recently been PA, FL, OH, etc, but historically NY had an absurd amount of power over presidential elections. Particularly in last half of 1800s.
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin I would say that in particular, the EC was designed to check the legislative branch. Most drafts had Congress electing the president; the EC was independent as a step to allow the president to check the power of Congress better.
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin I know there are arguments for not using a national plurality vote to elect a president, and historical reasons for ducking away from national direct voting (voter eligibility, slavery), but I'm not convinced the contemporary EC is *exercising* any of those "good reasons not to."
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin There is a difference from being within the letter of the law and following the purpose of the law. Except for arguably "binding" laws dictating electors' votes, the system stays within the Constitution's framework; but not functioning as intended, thus not serving its purpose.
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin Plenty of them were unfond of the system, either from the start or as matters developed, but they couldn't build a national consensus around an alternative. Although I will say that by the time the EC took its fully modern form (1828 and later) most FFs were dead or retired.
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin No. I expect you to believe that things weren't working as planned and had to be fixed in spite of the fact that changing the Constitution was hard. The 12th Amendment was the one emergency patch that managed to get consensus support. Other attempts to fix EC failed.
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin I have a lot more to say about that. https://t.co/jFOXygIJfR
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin The very idea of electors being "pledged" came later. They didn't realize the role political parties would play.  The closest we have ever come to the EC working as the Founders intended it to typically work (they expected super-popular Washington to be a rare anomaly) was 1824.
@moodyredhead @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin (1) Electors were supposed to be wise political insiders making own decisions. Per Federalist 68, populist political outsiders like Trump need not apply.		(2) The #ElectoralCollege was supposed to serve as a nominating body most of the time. The House would then choose from 5.
@OLawsen @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin NY has decided the presidency more than any other state. CA was the potently decisive "tipping state" of the election in 1916, and also played a key role in the 1948 election. 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@AaronBrynen @DrDaveOrts It's a little more complicated than that because of the way winner-take-all blocs work out. Bigger blocs have more power per electoral vote, and voters have more power if they live in states that are likely to have narrower margins. 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@DrDaveOrts @soso08 @ObsoleteDogma @keithboykin The #ElectoralCollege is more sensitive to fraud than a national popular vote. Or just regular counting errors (see 2000). Much easier to mess up or cheat by a few thousand votes in a key state than a few million votes over the whole country.
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov @CynthiaNixon Unless we return the #ElectoralCollege to the intended operation where electors are chosen for their wisdom and figure things out from themselves rather than having marching orders from a plurality vote, the EC is *more* vulnerable to the effect of misinformation than a NPV.
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov @CynthiaNixon One thing you might want to keep in mind is that if Kerry, in 2004, had gotten Obama-2008 numbers of votes in *just* the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati metro areas, he would have won the #ElectoralCollege while losing the national popular vote. It really does cut both ways.
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov @CynthiaNixon The #ElectoralCollege does not help small states or rural areas. I understand why you might think it does, but it does not do so. 		https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov The #ElectoralCollege is one of the least popular pieces of the American constitutional structure, among both the left and the right. Updating the election system isn't really a partisan issue, just a sensible thing to do.
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official @POTUS @realDonaldTrump From 1828 forward, #ElectoralCollege has acted mostly like a #plurality vote. The differences have had very little to do with the Founding Fathers' intentions (e.g., greater vulnerability to fraud) and mostly amount to unintended "noise" rather than anything meaningful.
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official My take is that it has few if any redeeming qualities and ought to go. Even replacing it with a basic plurality vote would be an improvement. Not ideal, but I'll take "improved" over trying to get something perfect. Easiest next step? Runoff if no candidate has actual majority.
https://t.co/N9dIYHNA4p
@TurtleTourGuide @SaraBethSimon @Styx666Official @sportsgals Well, how else do you expect the man to get around having been elected by an institution he disagrees with? It's awkward to try to find someone else to do that tough of a job under the table, and she was conveniently living in the White House already... 😜
@JoeyEDawes @seanhannity @HillaryClinton @DailyMailUK @DailyMirror "Worked" except when the 1800 election got deadlocked, leading to the 12th Amendment to patch the system. And then the 1860 set off a civil war, which is usually not good. And then 1876 and 2000 had to be figured out on the fly... https://t.co/ylRU1f5Tmj
@news_flea The Founding Fathers were not the least bit worried about California, and in making the #ElectoralCollege, they built a system in which the largest state of the day, Virginia, elected four of the first five presidents.
@SaraBethSimon @TurtleTourGuide @Styx666Official Do you know who else thought a popular vote was the right way to elect a president, and repeatedly dissed the #ElectoralCollege system?		I'll give you one for free. James Madison, best known as #FatherOfTheConstitution.
@jackieugarland @allisonfedder @TwitchyTeam Madison, August 23, 1823: "... the eventual appointment on the H. of Rs. voting by States, was, as you presume, an accomodation to the anxiety of the smaller States for their sovereign equality ..."
@jackieugarland @allisonfedder @TwitchyTeam Notice that the article doesn't provide any support for the claim about small states? That's because there isn't any. The Founding Fathers thought the EC favored large states. Small states got 1 state = 1 vote in the House contingent election in order to buy their support.
@GavinMcCollum @Clarknt67 @JenD1974 @everydayvaluetv @davidaxelrod One thing that happens in primaries is that once a victor seems inevitable, party loyalists close ranks behind the inevitable winner to move on to the general ASAP.		Having all those SDs publicly declared (and counted by media outlets like NYT) may have hampered Sanders' run.
@allisonfedder @TwitchyTeam I can't think of any ways in which the #ElectoralCollege functions effectively to protect minority interests against mob rule. Can you explain your reasoning?
@hill_charlotte Ever since Warren G. Harding, the main Republican economic policy argument has been simple and endorsed widely by business leaders. It hasn't changed much since then.		Simplicity, repetition, and endorsements go a long way.
@PrezHillary17 @Neilfan12 @Fem_Atheist I was. And I took early note of the fact that Sanders was winning heavily among the groups that are underrepresented in the Democratic primary electorate. 		As I said above, "more people" is not the same as "more Democratic primary voters." Or even "more Democrats."
@PrezHillary17 @Neilfan12 @Fem_Atheist Many people underestimated the degree to which the #ElectoralCollege is chaotic, which is to say, sensitive to small perturbations. A small shift in popular votes can make a large change in electoral votes. National vote margins are much more stable.
@PrezHillary17 @Neilfan12 @Fem_Atheist They were fairly typically accurate.		https://t.co/CBHO3GXem5		With the #ElectoralCollege, really weird things can happen. Personally, I think that the way Hillary's victory was described as inevitable was a self-defeating prophecy. Too many Democrats complacently stayed home.
@Neilfan12 @Fem_Atheist @PrezHillary17 Not "more people." Just "more Democratic primary voters."
@Neilfan12 @Fem_Atheist @PrezHillary17 I.e., not an illusion. Just not really enough of the right sorts of people to pull out a win in the Democratic primary. There's plenty of evidence out there.
@Neilfan12 @Fem_Atheist @PrezHillary17 On the ground, as the 2016 primary drew to a close, opinion polls showed Sanders as better liked than Clinton overall. For example:		https://t.co/NkrMhEkvew		With expertise, you can infer it logically from primary results and the old/young insider/outsider issues.
@PrezHillary17 @Fem_Atheist @FashionVRfan @Neilfan12 Yes, that is so. There were old people who preferred Bernie; just like you, however, they were within the minority of their demographic. C'est la vie. We aren't always be perfect reflections of our demographic profiles, nor should we try to be.
@Neilfan12 The open vs. closed primary debate is always interesting, but... 		... my point simply is that @Fem_Atheist was correct that more people wanted Bernie, and @PrezHillary17 was incorrect that more people wanted Hillary. I would say non-Democrats should be included in "people."
@PrezHillary17 @Fem_Atheist @FashionVRfan @Neilfan12 Hillary was an insider who appealed to party loyalists and old people. Bernie was an outsider who appealed to independents and young people. Given an equally wanted pair of candidates like that, the insider would thrash the outsider in the party primaries by a huge margin.
@PrezHillary17 @Fem_Atheist @FashionVRfan @Neilfan12 Bernie lost the primary, yes. Was it "fair and square"? Arguable. Did more people want Bernie? Given his numbers among independents and other groups who were underrepresented in the Democratic primary process, yes.
@wpbotz @Richard_Sammon @shady_simpleton @Heather3E8i8 @ReneeCloyd1 @BMLewis2 @christinawilkie I *do* expect pres candidates will pay attention to Michigan in 2020 as a battleground, since the margin was narrow and surprising in 2016 and MI has 16 EVs (tied for 8th most w/GA). Similarly for NC in 2012 after Obama's surprising but narrow win in NC.
@Richard_Sammon @shady_simpleton @Heather3E8i8 @ReneeCloyd1 @BMLewis2 @christinawilkie Presidential candidates spend very little money and very little time campaigning in small states (except IA and NH, primaries).		2012 visits: https://t.co/mXBxhELmnf	2012, money: https://t.co/qyIt4BH0mO		Every modern presidential campaign concentrates on the largest swing states.
@cloudydays1971 @Richard_Sammon @shady_simpleton @Heather3E8i8 @ReneeCloyd1 @BMLewis2 @christinawilkie Correct "twice" to "five times." (Also 1824, 1876, 1888, though in 1824 it was the House contingent election part of the system rather than the EC part.)
@Richard_Sammon @shady_simpleton @Heather3E8i8 @ReneeCloyd1 @BMLewis2 @christinawilkie The craziest thing is that the #ElectoralCollege doesn't help small states, but the fact that people think it does is one of the reasons that we still have it.
@basstransfer @iusedtohaveaol @DonnaWR8 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS That's not a good reason to like the #ElectoralCollege. It doesn't actually protect rural voters.		For that matter, it doesn't work *anything* like how the Founding Fathers expected it to work. https://t.co/jFOXygIJfR
@hill_charlotte The most striking thing about that graph is how dramatic the share difference was in Democrats' favor in years like 1964. 		Now I'm wondering how the graph might look including every year and every party....
https://t.co/ylRU1f5Tmj
It's not a perfect system, but it's a lot better than a simple plurality vote - and it's training voters to get used to ranking options, which is the foundation of a lot of the other options for running a well-behaved election. https://t.co/GkHMo6wNVB
@sarawenfinger @expressojf @thewayoftheid @eclecticbrotha @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The #ElectoralCollege has been decided by New York more than by any other state, FYI.
@curlsywhirl @Lynoc53 @colcrosbie @algore @43georgebush The number of yeoman farmers who would be inconvenienced by the logistics of horse-powered travel through the countryside has got to be pretty small by now...  #WhyTuesday
@chainfree2b @Slate Points aren't really the same as power. Power - leverage - really has to do with "battleground" status, and the most powerful states are usually the biggest battleground states. (Florida in 2000, New York in 1880, etc.) It is a very unequal system, though.
@_EthanGrey 3/2, sorry, I can't Twitter correctly yet. Not used to it. Opinion - we should not be discouraging qualified women from running by telling them they will face an uphill battle at the ballot box.
@_EthanGrey 2/2. While lab studies show the structure of bias, most studies of candidates in the wild show that on the balance, between all the factors, women candidates either perform similarly at the ballot box or have a modest electoral advantage. E.g., https://t.co/TD2Y3v24uJ
@_EthanGrey 1/2. In spite of the fact that she lost the #ElectoralCollege and in spite of the fact that those prejudiced against women voted against her, she earned more votes, came within a statistical sneeze of winning the EC, and would have won any normal electoral process.
@KJMushung Modern #ElectoralCollege process didn't really mutate into place until the 1828 election cycle. And threatened to restart the Civil War with the 1876 cycle.
@tin_man_0317 @DatterJuni @HeyZuesChristo @nullnotvoid @WayneDupreeShow @TheTrumpgang @ABCNetwork @iamwandasykes @therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump @POTUS (Small state advocates then screamed bloody murder when the 12th Amendment cut the system from "top 5" to "top 3," since they felt that made it almost impossible for even a regionally popular small state candidate.)
@tin_man_0317 @DatterJuni @HeyZuesChristo @nullnotvoid @WayneDupreeShow @TheTrumpgang @ABCNetwork @iamwandasykes @therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The Founding Fathers thought the #ElectoralCollege system would regularly elect presidents who only won the vote of their home state. Small states would then get a say in the House contingent election.
@aidaneus Yukon, Nunavut, and NWT are above the min pop for a state, but you're probably right. By existing legislation, you'd have the temporary addition of representatives, followed by reapportionment back down to 435 total (b/w US and CA) after next decennial census.
@DatterJuni @HeyZuesChristo @tin_man_0317 @nullnotvoid @WayneDupreeShow @TheTrumpgang @ABCNetwork @iamwandasykes @therealroseanne @realDonaldTrump @POTUS The Founding Fathers had no clue how the Electoral College would actually end up operating. It was a politically pragmatic compromise of the moment.
@HeyZuesChristo @tin_man_0317 @nullnotvoid @WayneDupreeShow @TheTrumpgang @ABCNetwork @iamwandasykes @therealroseanne The one by @kennethfield is also really nice: https://t.co/BlpWburArW
@geoczar4 Votes cast per Congressional district, California 2016: 268,000	Votes cast per Congressional district, US 2016: 314,500		Not a lot of room for extra voters showing up. Non-citizens do give Cali about seven extra #ElectoralCollege votes, though.
@RoyalCoug @Lawrence Better sports analogy, IMO: Wins more games in a series. You have a fixed set of contests, and it doesn't matter how many points are scored in each one, although the points are meaningful within the context of each contest.
@ContestEntry411 @LarrySharpe Hillary's campaign could've won with more votes outside metro areas, OR more votes in Milwaukee, Detroit, and Philadelphia metro areas. Easier for metro areas to swing a state than a country. #ElectoralCollege is just a more chaotic popular vote, really.
The #ElectoralCollege is weird, but it was supposed to be weirder: https://t.co/jFOXygIJfR
@Anna_ohlala @juliejewels2go @MichaelDKolpack @darylsturgis @LoriJSchaffer @VABlueBelle18 @Minervasbard @realDonaldTrump Yup. And not just a 2016 thing. The #ElectoralCollege is really hard to predict because small changes in votes lead to big changes in electors.
@JohnRayNatuRal1 @AJDelgado13 If you don't like New York deciding presidential elections, you should fear the #ElectoralCollege. NY has decided a lot of presidential elections. Most dramatically 1880/1884/1888.
@ContestEntry411 @LarrySharpe Democrats are complaining that winning NYC gets them the whole state's electoral votes in one big winner-take-all pot?🤨
@meredith_angel1 Also in 1876 and 1888. Although that was a very different Republican party then. 😉
@NewAmericanMag Not really. If you look at the voting record of the "Southern California" counties, that would be a battleground state with electoral votes (and Senate seats) potentially up for grabs.
