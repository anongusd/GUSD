@Boyd_2650 @kwilli1046 rump tv is not a reputable source for unbiased information.  This story is FALSE !
@ReneeCarrollPhx @GrizzleMaximus You need to consider the source in that publication.
@alexlalbert @steph93065 Maybe you should be saying that one shouldn't do this to @steph93065 . She politicized personal assault,  trauma above by saying '... the culture of victimhood is 'owned by the left".	My bottom line is that ANYONE can be a victim of anything. It's not a republican or Dem. thing.
@Honesty7111 Haha... yeah.
@steph93065 Oh give me a break.  If you weren't republican you wouldn't be saying that.
@DeadlineWH @KimberlyEAtkins @NicolleDWallace I'm ready for donny rump and the gang to be in cuffs and held accountable for their crimes before a court's magistrate.
