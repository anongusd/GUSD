While spewing lies about abortion and reproductive health, Trump and the GOP have been trying to cut funds from critical nutrition programs SNAP &amp; WIC‚Äîprograms that millions of women &amp; children across the country rely on to meet their basic needs. #HowDareYou
Where was the ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù party when an immigrant woman went into premature labor and had a stillbirth four days after being detained by ICE? Their silence, in the wake of such personal and calculated tragedy, speaks volumes. #HowDareYou
#HowDareYou: The GOP is trying to criminalize abortion AND make giving birth a pre-existing condition. This is about controlling and punishing women. Period.
The GOP's extremist rhetoric and outright lies about abortion have REAL consequences. Research has shown that death threats against abortion providers have DOUBLED and clinic obstruction has TRIPLED since Trump's election in 2016. Inciting violence isn't "pro-life." #HowDareYou https://t.co/iaL035lLOx
In the last election, candidates were confronted with an urgent call for meaningful legislation to #EndGunViolence when the #Parkland shooting transformed a group of teen survivors into our national conscience. They and other young people across America made the difference!
As gun violence remains a national crisis in our communities, our thoughts are with families that have lost loved ones and our prayers are that the US Senate will listen to the people‚Äôs cries for common sense solutions to #EndGunViolence and keep our families safe.
The kids and families of #Parkland became the change they wanted to see in the fight to #EndGunViolence in America.

With 97% of Americans supporting background checks ‚Äì including the vast majority of NRA members ‚Äì Mitch McConnell should respect the people enough to allow a vote in the Senate on this common sense solution to #EndGunViolence.
When Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic efforts to #EndGunViolence after Sandy Hook, our heart sank as a nation. The strength and courage of grieving Newtown families and the activists born of that tragedy eventually galvanized us at the ballot box to say enough!
After nearly a decade of Republicans blocking common sense solutions to #EndGunViolence that they once supported, the new Democratic House Majority just passed 2 bills to strengthen background checks and keep guns away from those who shouldn‚Äôt have them. https://t.co/zQg8ExH1Gm

This epidemic of racist, homophobic and transphobic attacks must end. No one should be forced to live in fear of being assaulted for who they are.
#Trump and his MAGA slogan have become synonymous with bigotry. But we shouldn‚Äôt pretend that racism, homophobia and transphobia began with Trump. They are problems that have long plagued our diverse communities.
These attacks against vulnerable communities are fueled in part by the bigotry emanating from the Trump Administration, from his racist hateful wall to his efforts to ban Muslims from entering the country and trans people from voluntary military service.
#Transgender people and those living at the intersections of these identities are often impacted more intensely.
We are outraged, but not surprised. This assault on Jussie is part of an increasing wave of attacks against LGBTQ people, people of color and indigenous people, immigrants, Muslims and Jews.
Jussie is an openly gay Black actor who came out in 2016. He has been strong champion for #LGBTQ people ‚Äî especially those of us who are also people of color. We are saddened and angered by this hate crime against him. We send our love to him and wish him a speedy recovery.

For all these reasons, Brian Kemp‚Äôs entire governorship is illegitimate. Every action he takes and every bill he signs will lack the democratic legitimacy of a freely and fairly elected leader.  14/14
The above violations of the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act, the Help America Vote Act, and Georgia law are being challenged in court by @FairFightAction and @CareInActionUSA 13/14 https://t.co/1wpxGHjGDE
Brian Kemp‚Äôs outright voter suppression tactics and his gross mismanagement of the electoral process fundamentally undermined Georgia‚Äôs democratic elections. 		Kemp disregarded Georgia‚Äôs voters at every turn - all he cared about was winning the governorship for himself. 12/14
Voters trying to vote absentee were also disenfranchised -  some voters who submitted applications never received their ballots, some arrived too late, and some were illegally rejected. 11/14 https://t.co/3McIfa39JS

Elections officials failed to supply enough voting machines for the expected turnout. Thousands of voters were forced to wait in egregiously long lines - an average of 3 hours in the Atlanta area. 8/14 https://t.co/icdekmmN2O
Georgia elections officials closed 214 polling locations under Kemp‚Äôs watch between 2012-2018. That‚Äôs 8% of all Georgia precincts, many of which served people of color. 7/14 https://t.co/inGSh4zWGx
Kemp suspended tens of thousands of new voter registrations, many due to inconsequential typographical mismatches in state databases. 6/14 https://t.co/zwZcoMkJF2
Kemp unconstitutionally purged the voter rolls of nearly 10% of all voters in 2017, using an absurd application of Georgia law. 5/14 https://t.co/xMYHG49Zeu
Through outright voter suppression and gross mismanagement of the electoral process, Sec. of State Kemp disenfranchised thousands of voters, disproportionately people of color. 4/14 https://t.co/nV6u63CmQA

Accountability is just informed policymaking. We have known since 2015 that the Saudi-led coalition is committing war crimes in Yemen with U.S. support. As @ChrisMurphyCT says, ‚Äúthere is an American imprint on every single civilian death inside Yemen.‚Äù https://t.co/wPnZ8aPSUO
Today, we know that Saudi Arabia killed Jamal Khashoggi. We know Saudi Arabia has increased its bombing of Yemen since the U.S.called for a cease-fire. And yesterday, the U.S. abruptly "pulled the brakes" on the UN cease-fire. https://t.co/Z7vMYqjbd2
Congress knew about these crimes in 2016, when Rep.@tedlieu, a former Air Force lawyer, said members of U.S. armed services could be prosecuted for war crimes for providing support to the Saudi-led coalition‚Äîbut U.S. support for the coalition continued. https://t.co/gRN0TXdQVn
Congress knew about these crimes in 2015, when U.S.-supported, Saudi-led airstrikes quickly escalated to include attacks on civilian sites, including this Doctors Without Borders clinic. They refused to act. https://t.co/iIARrv0Fas
This is the second time this bill has come up for a vote. The first time, Senator Corker said they couldn‚Äôt end U.S. involvement in #Yemen because senators didn‚Äôt know what was happening there. That was a lie. https://t.co/OwouIQ1prP
The Lee-Sanders bill, SJR54, will end U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, if it passes the Senate and the House. And it is a privileged resolution, so the president cannot veto this bill. Together, we can help save millions of lives, and Trump can't stop us.
How does war cause a cholera outbreak? In 2015, Saudi bombings hit water treatment sites in Sana‚Äôa, Yemen‚Äôs capital city. Clean water became unavailable. To date, there have been over 1.2 million cases of cholera in Yemen. https://t.co/98f9luTyAp
Over 85,000 children under 5 have already died because of the famine and cholera outbreaks caused by the U.S.-supported, Saudi-led coalition‚Äôs indiscriminate bombings. https://t.co/b7wCKxQNir
Amal, age 7, was just one of the heartbreaking casualties of this war. She died of famine caused by the Saudi blockade on Yemen‚Äôs ports and its indiscriminate bombing of civilian sites, which drove up the cost of basic food items and made markets unsafe. 	https://t.co/X6papFV4BJ
Yemen is the world‚Äôs worst humanitarian crisis. Since 2015, the Saudi-led coalition, with U.S. arms, fuel, and tactical support, has been responsible for two-thirds of the civilian casualties in this conflict. https://t.co/UhDFqvMmRb
