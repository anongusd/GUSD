Am I about to grab my 4th cup of coffee in the last 12 hours? My mouth tells me know, but my “Unending need to get things done” tells my mouth to “Shove the caffeine goodness down my throat”!
@ShinkariAlex How do you think you and I became friends.... must be 5’11 or taller.
@Hoffafiles Hoffa, you know Pumpkin Spice Lattes are available at all Starbucks, not just at Berkeley, right?.... Right?
