@LuditeSam * non competitive conversation	I should also mention that I'm not trying to make a point about D&amp;D versus other games, just that your description of the only part of the book that offers characterization being physical description is really weird to me.
@LuditeSam In what universe are you allowed to ignore everything on your character sheet and not make any skill checks when playing D&amp;D? Even in some insane hypothetical scenario where skill checks are completely avoided by doing nothing but competetive conversation, an elf is still an elf.
@LuditeSam I should mention I haven't had a chance to watch that video yet.
@LuditeSam Then I build NPCs to focus on another aspect of their character they actually care about.	More to the point, I don't think your initial statement that physical description is the only part of the book about RP holds up and what you've posted has made me more sure of it.
@CStevenRoss @LuditeSam Noice, found it on Youtube here: https://t.co/1TCD4TnC4W	I'll probably watch it on the train tomorrow, and maybe let you know what I think, if that's cool.
@LuditeSam Also if a player refuses to roleplay their interactions after being prodded, I would take that to mean they are having anxiety, but if it was clear they were serious about not wanting to roleplay I would probably encourge them to find a different DM.
@LuditeSam This just pushes the problem back a few additions, it doesn't solve it. I am willing to bet that if talking to NPCs was a thing and there was a stat called "charisma" they knew it tells you something about who your character is.

@LuditeSam @CStevenRoss You really think having your CHA define how charismatic your character is isn't intentionally implied by the rulebook? That it's something players came up with themselves that the 5e rulebook writers would be shocked to learn of.
@LuditeSam @CStevenRoss Really I'm just mystified that you would play a 15-Cha elf and a 5-Cha half-orc the same way when you're not in combat.

After all, I've played games where combat never occured, but I wouldn't use that to say that combat isn't a core appeal of D&amp;D or that combat focused players aren't one of the
@LuditeSam @CStevenRoss 1/	Yeah that wasn't a hypothetical question, it would actually be really interesting to me to see someone play like this. Although if you're trying to make a statement about what the core appeal of D&amp;D is, it would make more sense to me to use a published suplement
@LGLancaster 2/	This behavior lasts for three days, after which the meal explodes in a cloud of butterflies.
@LGLancaster 1/	The meal grows tentacle-like limbs and evades being eaten, but maintans a friendly disposition towards its creator even after several attempts. It retrieves small objects thrown by its creator and warns them about newcomers by producing low gurgling noises.
@LuditeSam I'd like to see you try and play a game of D&amp;D entirely without roleplaying.
@LuditeSam I disagree completely. Your character's abilities imply parts of their backstory, which in turn implies their personality. For instance, if your character can talk to animals, what does it say about them if they are or aren't vegetarian?

Finally, they can really do a number on your heart. That's why I had to quit them.	In summary, ADHD pills are bad and honestly the most healthy way to use them is probably to save them for music festivals.
Third, the crash from amphetamine withdrawal has symptoms that are eerily similar to ADHD. If you stop taking your ADHD pills and oh no you can't focus even a little, that wasn't how bad your focus was before you took them, and your focus will recover to pre-amphetamine levels.
The second thing is that everyone I have ever known with a prescription except for me sold their pills to college students. Actually, the fact that I took mine every day as directed instead of running out early contributed to how bad my crash was after I stopped using them.
The first thing you need to understand about ADHD pills is that they are meth. If you wouldn't give someone meth as a long term solution to their attention issues, don't give them amphetamine pills.
