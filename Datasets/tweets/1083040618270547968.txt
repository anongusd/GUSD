@2015retired @WVTM13 I agree, especially nowadays as you see so many people not being able to control themselves. Unfortunately it is taking way too many innocent lives. Definitely starts at the home though &amp; how their raised in most cases, really sad to see 😔
@anndeluca5 Absolutely. It’s so unfortunate what they are putting Pres. Trump through when he needs his attention towards running the Country. This needs to end soon. Costs are in the multi-millions now and tab is increasing everyday.
@kylesperhour But it doesn’t say Pres. Trump was involved or even knew about it. Have to wait &amp; see still but I highly doubt Pres. Trump had anything to do with that. Again, wait see

Texas Republicans Fight To Keep Muslim In GOP Leadership Position https://t.co/kkAdy31KgH via @freedom_moates. Dems constantly say we‘re ‘racist’ etc. When in fact, it is T͟͟H͟͟E͟͟M͟͟ who are, check this out, you’ll see the truth. We‘re NOT racist just because we want to be safe?
@xanawho @AppSame @realDonaldTrump @CNN @KUSINews @TheDemocrats AND it’s not Trump fighting immigrants, he is fighting ILLEGAL immigrants AND he has stated why he wants the Wall &amp; drugs are included in his reasoning as well as all the other issues involved. He‘s for the people &amp; Dems are for more power &amp; $$. You need to educate yourself more.
@xanawho @AppSame @realDonaldTrump @CNN @KUSINews @TheDemocrats No it’s IS the Dems. Maybe Trump started it but the DEMS NOW OWN it. All they had to do was meet with Trump at the table to negotiate but they refuse &amp; go on vacations instead ie Hawaii! Trump is trying a LOT harder to stop the shutdown but it is the DEMS WHO N͟͟O͟͟W͟͟  REFUSE!

@BetteMidler Ha ha u r such a hiprocite &amp; a ‘has been’, who r u again? I forgot. U celebs ALL  have gates/walls &amp; lots of $ what do u care, just all talk. U r ALL the same. Put ur $ where ur mouth is if ur honest. At least Trump cares &amp; try to keep u safe.
@BPup50 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer I’ll be waiting! ❤️👍
@VECancel @cher @MSNBC It was a scam &amp; not by him (Trump).
@VECancel @cher @MSNBC It’s fake news.... not true. Media needs to verify facts.
@STELLA_1OO @denisecrowland @cher But very true. She’s all walled in, security, etc. Has tons of $. She’s jealous as she wants his power too! Celebs. such hiprocrites! Trump is trying to keep u safe, made good on his promises so far &amp; Dems hate it so they don’t want to give it to him. Dems r evil, Trump = good!
@nancyrollings @cher She has a wall, what does she care? She has lots of $, etc. all talk.  Trump at least is trying to do some good while all the Libs &amp; Dems keep trying to pull him down but guess what? He loves it &amp; rises way above it! I wish we had him 4 r PM! TRUMP❤️!
@Jason_Stuart @cher U mean Dems watch. Trump may have started it but Dems NOW own it. At least Trump is trying to keep u safe. Dems want open borders &amp; lots &amp; lots of $ &amp; power. Trump already has it &amp; doing at least good with it. Open ur eyes &amp; don’t drink any Kool aid from the Dems....
@uponthisrock627 @cher If that happens, WAY WORSE honey... think Pence will be better? Watch what u wish for. Trump is way better! I’d trade for Trump vs. our PM anyday. At least u got great economy, lots of jobs, etc. U should be more grateful for what u have, ! At least Trump is making USA better.
@cher OMG, Trump did N͟͟O͟͟T͟͟  Kill anyone, let alone those 2 precious children! You Celbs are A͟͟L͟͟L͟͟ the same! Out of touch, $ hungry, u r the 1’s who R corrupt &amp; would do A͟͟N͟͟Y͟͟T͟͟H͟͟I͟͟N͟͟G͟͟  for a $! Where were U when he HAD said this from his campaign trail! U LIAR!
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer &amp; Trump is N͟͟O͟͟T͟͟  loosing A͟͟N͟͟Y͟͟  support! He is gaining B͟͟I͟͟G͟͟   time! I bet you he’ll win 2020! Pelosi &amp; Schumer are evil &amp; trying to destroy America, open your eyes &amp; ears &amp; you’d see it. Big time! Dems just are $ hungry. Trump is at least doing good for your Country
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer What failures? You’ve got an amazing economy, jobs, etc. I would trade for Trump any day over our HORRIBLE, treasonous, loser PM we have! At least Trump is making America Great Again! Give us Trump &amp; you can have ours! Any day! Trump 2020 👍
