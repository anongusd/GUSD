@JaimeNeutron_ That‚Äôs a good point, and I‚Äôll read the bbc article now. I don‚Äôt know that we can assume the percentage goes up exponentially over years without stats saying that though
@andrew_amarone @FairoozAdams But also, thanks for being a sane person to argue with on twitter who has good arguments lol. It‚Äôs refreshing
@andrew_amarone @FairoozAdams True! But I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs totally accurate to call women who have abortions ‚Äúsurvivors,‚Äù the word we use for rape victims, for a procedure they chose to have and, overall, do not regret. I think we should frame the issue differently and destigmatize motherhood, that‚Äôs all.
@FatalisSmilodon @andrew_amarone @FairoozAdams It isn‚Äôt any one political ideology that is or isn‚Äôt stigmatizing mothers and tbh I‚Äôm bored of everyone on twitter constantly insisting that their side doesn‚Äôt do this or that thing that the other side does. (This is completely not exclusive to you so don‚Äôt take it personally)
@andrew_amarone @FairoozAdams Ok, but 95% of women who get abortions don‚Äôt regret it. It could still be a traumatic event, but that does complicate the picture. That‚Äôs why I think we need to make it easier to be a mother https://t.co/VHHnEBiT45
@JaimeNeutron_ 95% of women who get abortions think they made the right decision. Does he not believe them? https://t.co/VHHnEBiT45
@andrew_amarone @FairoozAdams So he believes the babies who survived botched abortions? What are they saying and what does he believe? It sounds to me like he is overstating the prevalence of botched abortions to scare people
@JaimeNeutron_ Again, .00073% die. It‚Äôs not that risky of a procedure. There are other reasons to be pro-life that are based on facts
@JaimeNeutron_ ....so what survivors is he talking about? That‚Äôs the point
@andrew_amarone @FairoozAdams The percentage of botched abortions is also really low though, if they‚Äôre performed properly. If we want to reduce abortions we shouldn‚Äôt engage in scaremongering, we should destigmatize motherhood (including single motherhood) and help women with careers support their kids

@zacharymfreiman We know
@JoeSageman He's just blaming them for contributing to the atmosphere of incivility by responding inappropriately to another act of political violence, not saying they carried out the attacks. Also where are you getting the stats about Dems usually being the targets?
@JoeSageman My point about "Twitter crazies" didn't just necessarily mean Chapo people on Twitter, but anyone without institutional power who makes threats or dehumanizes their political opponents
@JoeSageman By that logic, you could just say that the president isn't inciting violence, those violent people are just crazy. We don't know what's making them violent, but their crazy echo chambers on and offline that dehumanize people might contribute to it.
@JoeSageman The guy who shot Scalise was a Super Online Bernie bro who posted horrible dehumanizing memes about Republicans, and the guy who sent ricin letters last week to the president and the Sec of Defense ranted abt the 1% as ppl who buy others on social media. It's Twitter crazies too
@JoeSageman Rhetoric and video games and rap music don't cause violence. But if someone raps or writes a country song or whatever about killing someone, it's telling a story through art, whereas writing "Steve Scalise deserved it" on Twitter is...not that
@JoeSageman Anyone has the power to make a bomb online and send it in the mail! This is what I don't like about privilege arguments that negate any responsibility for people 'punching up.' To an extent they're right, but not for lone wolf acts of violence that can do a lot of damage.
@VanniHashimoto Because I'm an annoying Zionist?
If the bomber meant to attach an ISIS flag to frame Muslims for the attempted attacks, but accidentally attached a right-wing meme because they can't read Arabic, then this story has somehow gotten more depressing. #bombscare https://t.co/BOj4S3e2M4
RT @classiclib3ral: These absolute geniuses thinks the bomber wrote their own return address on the packages https://t.co/Sp7NABT1zu
@JoeSageman Second, it's rando nobodies who shot Steve Scalise and probably sent the bombs! We can't know who's going to turn violent from Twitter, true, but making it okay to call your political opponents termites or Nazis makes it seem like a moral imperative to be violent with them
@JoeSageman First, we know that rhetoric matters, because if it didn't Trump would be basically an average Republican president (aside from his immigration policies and breaking up the TPP.) People are mad at him for saying things ("the media is the enemy of the people"), not just doing them
@JoeSageman for being against gun control and how they contributed to the breakdown in civility, and not to the actual motives of the pizzagate shooter
@JoeSageman The breakdown in civility is related to violence and that‚Äôs what he was talking about in the thread (the next tweet is about the Iran deal and how opposing it meant you were bought off by Sheldon Adelson.) I think he was referring to the hot takes about how Scalise deserved it
@JoeSageman I mean the race baiting stuff is way more republicans‚Äô fault, but also the your-opponent-is-bought-off conspiracy theories are bipartisan
@JoeSageman Smh you‚Äôre a millennial and you can‚Äôt even make the meme
@JoeSageman Wrong, Seth Mandel is a god!! But also he was the ops editor at NY Post when his building was repeatedly evacuated and surrounded by cops because of threats against Fox News (which shares the building) so he‚Äôs actually experienced credible threats of political violence

In conclusion, never do this! And by the way, this is all 100% true and it took place at this ridiculous place called Caliber 3 in Efrat, Gush Etzion (near Jerusalem/Bethlehem) https://t.co/bqtkHESPQm
On the drive back over the Green Line, as you fantasize about having access to a restroom, the store clerk from the gun gift shop messages you. "Hey! Facebook said I should add you, what a coincidence!" You have no mutual friends. He got your name from your passport.
The head of the program comes out to make a long speech about the Jewish people's right to live in Judea and Samaria, which he delivers by screaming and pointing at the ground. Then he makes the bar mitzvah boys read a poem about Auschwitz.
Your group begins an obstacle course, which consists of push-ups, running, and then shooting a gun as quickly as you can at the targets. Sadly, you're wearing a dress, so you let the bar mitzvah boys take your turn and go to read a Kindle book about the KGB.
You learn how to shoot a machine gun at a target on the side of a mountain. There are two recently bar mitzvah'ed boys who are very cute and excited about this. Unfortunately, neither comes close to hitting their target. They are a two-person argument for strict gun control.
Another extremely muscular blonde man in sunglasses brings an attack dog outside. Everyone gathers in a circle to watch as he repeatedly orders the dog to attack and to stop attacking. The dog is very obedient. Everyone applauds with awe.
Suicide bombing simulation. Apparently, suicide bombings consist of a extremely muscular men in yarmulkes shoving everyone onto the ground. This strikes you as not a particularly effective defense method against bombs, but you're told the bomb squad defused the bomb elsewhere.
You watch a training video with loud men shooting terrorists. (There are no terrorists at the fantasy camp, just Palestinian cleaners. They have cars with Palestinian plates in the parking lot, which according to your tour guide proves there is no occupation.)
When you arrive at the fantasy camp, which is not actually affiliated with the Israeli Defense Forces, you spend about half an hour looking at the large guns in the gift shop and making small talk with the store clerk (if you're a cute girl, he will hit on you.)
You have to go through part of the West Bank to get there, which is already a drawback for both political and practical reasons. Practically, you're basically not allowed to stop the car to use the bathroom anywhere, which your tour guide will invariably not tell you beforehand.
This article lists 11 things not to do when visiting Israel, and yet found no space for "Avoid the IDF fantasy camp in the West Bank where old white people pay to shoot guns for an hour and simulate a suicide bombing." From experience, this should be #1 https://t.co/RE5VTTJQce
