@cwb1115 @RepublicanKC @repcleaver Not the point Both of these men were American citizens afforded the right to due process PERIOD... this sets the president that the President can have anyone assassinated for Political reasons. At a minimum they could have been indicted &amp; tried in absentia.
@cwb1115 @RepublicanKC @repcleaver Yes al-Awlaki &amp; Samir Khan were both American Citizens &amp; Both assassinated by the U.S. government without due process... This is a fact and not up for debate.	So yes this was a direct violation of the 6th Amendment.
