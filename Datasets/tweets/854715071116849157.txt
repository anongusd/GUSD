Today marks six months since President Trump signed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct into law. Since then, we’ve seen larger paychecks, bonuses, wage increases, expanded benefits, and 1 million new jobs. Plus consumer confidence is at an 18-year high and unemployment is at an 18-year low. https://t.co/Mk2h6kiJLd
The House has passed the #2018FarmBill providing certainty for Kansas farmers &amp; ranchers by protecting crop insurance, repealing burdensome regulations like WOTUS, investing in rural broadband &amp; reforming SNAP to help those in need while encouraging Americans to get back to work. https://t.co/BPck95vQJl
I'm disappointed the common-sense immigration bill I cosponsored to fix our broken system failed. We need solutions that secure our border, close loopholes, &amp; provide stability to DACA recipients without providing amnesty or incentivizing breaking the law. https://t.co/oS0JYluu5x
The needed &amp; overdue delivery of #KC46 tankers is great news for our country, and I'm proud @22ARW is slated to receive the first round. The Airmen at McConnell have been working tirelessly to prepare for this delivery. https://t.co/DiVxwzR5ZX

(2/2) I urge the Trump admin to take a more targeted approach to these tariffs &amp; maintain focus on bad actors like China. As a strong advocate of free &amp; fair trade, I will continue working to ensure any trade negotiations produce favorable outcomes for KS manufacturers &amp; farmers.
While I support the president’s overall strong posture on trade negotiations, today’s tariffs on steel &amp; aluminum from Canada, Mexico and the EU are disappointing. Retaliation from these tariffs puts Kansas manufacturers and farmers who rely on aluminum &amp; steel at risk. (1/2)
