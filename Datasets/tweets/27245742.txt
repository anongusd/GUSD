Not clear Trump can confirm a new SecDef. 1) Has to find someone qualified who will go before the Senate and defend Syria/Afgan withdrawal 2) Easy to see some GOP sens refusing to vote for such a nominee (Graham, Rubio, etc)
To all those saying this is what he campaigned on, he also campaigned on criticizing Obama's irresponsible withdrawal from Iraq. Remember when he called Obama the "founder of ISIS"?
Anyone who criticized Obama's irresponsible withdrawal from Iraq but defends Trump's irresponsible withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan needs to check their hypocrisy.
