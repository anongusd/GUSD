Just as I would ask other Democrats to throw support behind @ewarren or @SherrodBrown (if he runs) or @KamalaHarris or @TulsiGabbard if they win the nomination.
We can't do a #NeverBernie or #BernieorBust again. Listen I don't support @SenSanders or @amyklobuchar or @JohnDelaney or @SenGillibrand or @JoeBiden but  I will throw my support behind them if they win (begrudgingly for Delaney [luckily there is no way in hell we will win])
@JohnDelaney to have left already and he hasn't (he needs to) and I thought @VoteOjeda2020 would have made it to the Debates at least.	5. Whoever wins the Primaries wins. Whether its who you would have picked or not whoever it is will need our full support to beat Trump.
The oldest candidates that either are running or are probably going to run e.g @SenSanders because of the fact that he takes money from insurance companies and the @NRA and @JoeBiden is a New Democrat Centerist. 	4. Don't count anyone out until their out. I would have expected
2. Don't just support a canidate based on the fact that they can put on a show. Support them on policy and their passion for the country.	3. Don't count anyone out based only on age. If you don't like a candidate make it based on personality or policy. I don't support either of
Before entering the Democratic Primaries next year I would like every Democratic voter or supporter to think about the candidates thinking about it like this.	1. While beating @realDonaldTrump is super important we need a candidate who can do more than just beat Trump

I may not agree with you or really like you but I respect you because you have been a fairly reasonable person to debate with. You stand your ground on what you believe.

@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends Thats not true I don't worship George Soros. To be 100% honest I don't even 100% know what he has done. I respect @CNN for there talented and profesional reporting. And if given a good case to do so I will change my mind.
@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends I don't see how you can see a correlation there. But ok.
@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends I count a total of twenty
@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends Yeah two in a tweet but over this debate there has been way too many.

@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends The right side of history is determined by the people on that side of history. For instance Nazi's are on the wrong side of history but they would probably say that they are on the right side of history?

@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @seanhannity Now you've totally got me confused. First shoutout to #toomanyhashtags second are you referring to the drug msm. Third its not rational to listen to @seanhannity or @TuckerCarlson or if you prefer @foxandfriends
@GrayJustice1776 @realDonaldTrump Never said that supporters of @realDonaldTrump are demons because they aren't. Fox News anchors are demons because  most other Trump supporters are people who will listen to reason but Fox News spout lies and call them truths and they will not listen to reason.
@GrayJustice1776 No this is a little thing I like to call free thought. Don't need no social engineering. Just a little common sense.

@NRA Please do us all a big favor and don't tell people that people who want increased gun laws want to get rid of the second ammendment. Thank You.
@TrumpAirport @TrumpAirport As a current Ohioan please don't bring that trash here. Thank You.
RT @TrumpAirport: Which Ohio Airport should be renamed Trump Airport? #OhioWX
@TrumpAirport None of them.
