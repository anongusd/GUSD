As I've said before, my bill was step 1 - we need these EOs and the Paycheck Fairness Act to make more progress on #equalpay. #NoMadMenPay
For once, it is a HAPPY #EqualPay Day. But we still have more work to do! http://t.co/gZ70V5RO5S  #NoMadMenPay
Today I stood for women nationwide while celebrating an #equalpay victory @WhiteHouse! http://t.co/gZ70V5RO5S  #NoMadMenPay
RT @WhiteHouse: FACT: Women account for nearly half of our workforce, yet on average, they still earn just $0.77 for every $1 men earn. #No‚Ä¶
That means men and women in similar jobs are being paid the same. We must also keep working to get women in the pipeline. #NoMadMenPay
The @whitehouse is committed to #equalpay ‚Äì through today‚Äôs executive orders and with its own staff. Equal pay for equal work. #NoMadMenPay
I agree! RT @LisaMaatz: "It's nice to have a day, but we'd rather have equal pay!" -- @BarackObama on Equal Pay Day 2014. #NoMadMenPay
RT @JuliaBrownley26: Honored to join @Lilly_Ledbetter @ White House for signing of two executive actions to help women achieve #equalpay. h‚Ä¶
RT @RepBeatty: Proud to stand with @Lilly_Ledbetter @NancyPelosi &amp; @RepMarcyKaptur on #EqualPay for #EqualWork #NoMadMenPay http://t.co/Yaf‚Ä¶
@RepMarcyKaptur @NancyPelosi @RepBeatty Thank you for your support! #EqualPay #NoMadMenPay
RT @rosadelauro: Time to pass Paycheck Fairness and update #EqualPay Act for the first time in 51 years. #NoMadMenPay
Today's @whitehouse #equalpay event was exciting. Read @LisaMaatz‚Äô recap. http://t.co/gZ70V5RO5S  #NoMadMenPay
I urge Congress to join the president on the right side of history by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. #NoMadMenPay
Today's EO will ban federal contractors from retaliating against workers who discuss salaries - this gets at a barrier I faced. #NoMadMenPay
I told the President that folks often refer to me as the face of fair pay, but for today that title belongs to him. #NoMadMenPay
RT @AAUWPolicy: How great was @lilly_ledbetter at @whitehouse today? She's tweeting with us now! #nomadmenpay http://t.co/vPfQGJHqsf
I was honored to stand on stage today on behalf of women struggling to make ends meet because of the gender pay gap. #NoMadMenPay
Thank you for joining me today! When women #talkpay they are making a difference.
If women are knowledgeable &amp; organized, we can, with men's help, make lasting change. #talkpay
.@RepGwenMoore Exactly! #FairPay Act brought attn to wage gap -  but there's more to be done! #talkpay
@AFLCIO @ToniVP Yes! Teachers/careworkers also have huge responsibility &amp; wrk long hrs. We need to start compensating them fairly #talkpay
.@AAUWPolicy If we focus on making education abt Equal Pay available young women will be able 2 negotiate salary &amp; ensure fair pay #talkpay
.@rosadelauro @nwlc I learned my wages were lower because of an anonymous note.  PFA would let women #talkpay freely at work.
.@nwlc When I started my fight I found out my story is not unique‚Äì many women have similar stories. We need to #talkpay 2 end discrimination
RT @nwlc: It took @Lilly_Ledbetter 20yrs to find out she was being discriminated agst. How long will it take you? Share Image: http://t. ...
.@SenatorBaldwin We need to speak to everyone we can to explain how impt it is to improve wage gap as an issue affecting families. #talkpay
@NAACP_LDF We shld continue to speak out abt lack of pay equity &amp; organize/vote together. When we speak as one voice, we're heard. #talkpay
.@SenatorBarb Exactly! Pay secrecy means women don‚Äôt have info they need to negotiate their salaries. Women need the freedom to #talkpay.
RT @nwlc: .@SenatorBarb We thank you for introducing #PaycheckFairness.  #Talkpay!
.@SenatorBarb #paycheckfairness wld give women more protection &amp; allow them to learn if they're being paid fairly- &amp; if not, why. #talkpay
. @CatalystInc We must pass Paycheck Fairness - if that had been law in my time, I wld have a 40% lrgr Retirement/Social Secy Fund. #talkpay
Women must earn a decent and equal wage to sustain themselves &amp; support themselves when they retire. #talkpay
Here to #talkpay with @nwlc. Join the conversation!

We need to pass Paycheck Fairness - if that had been law in my	 time, I would have a 40% larger Retirement/Social Secy Fund. @NPWF #talkpay
It would give women more protection &amp; allow them to learn if they're being paid fairly - if not, they can learn why. @capcongress #talkpay
We need to pass Paycheck Fairness - it would strengthen/update the Equal Pay Act &amp; protect workers. @misslenabadr #talkpay
How cld any women not be affected? When I started my fight, I found out my story is not unique, it's everybody's story @HadassahOrg #talkpay
We should continue to speak out abt lack of pay equity &amp; organize/vote together. When we speak as one voice, we're heard. @9to5org #talkpay
Teachers/careworkers both have tremendous responsibility &amp; work long hrs. We need to start compensate them fairly. @FeministFriends #talkpay
We should invest in training like @AAUW pgrms training young wmn to enter nontraditional  jobs &amp; how to negotiate pay. @OTLCampaign #talkpay
Yes - it would draw the focus to what each employer is paying on diff levels. @amytruck #talkpay
If women are knowledgeable &amp; organized, we can, with men's help, make lasting change. @Kerri_Ryer #talkpay
If we focus on making education abt Equal Pay available young women will be able 2 negotiate salary to ensure they receive fair pay #talkpay
It will make more progress in the next 4 years bc men understand women must earn a decent wage to sustain themselves/retire. #talkpay
Wage Equality will move forward - it's an important issue to our nation &amp; the well being of Amer Families. @AmaniHerron #talkpay
The Equal Pay Act is 50 years old this year, and we need fair pay for women and minorities vs. men. @emonkus #talkpay
We see that the Fair Pay Act brought attn to the wage gap - more people who have faced discrimination have come forward. @emonkus #talkpay
We need to speak to everyone we can to explain how impt it is to improve wage gap as an issue affecting families. @amytruck #talkpay
We should tell lawmakers why this matters. It's not a D/R problem, it's a matter of human value &amp; dignity for workers @erintothemax #talkpay
