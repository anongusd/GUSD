RT @SenateApprops: Chairman @Daniel_Inouye's floor statement on the 6 month CR: http://t.co/42V6hX3A
"At some point, this body needs to alter either its behavior or its rules."
The bipartisan zeal for regular order last spring has been crushed by dilatory tactics of a few members that have wasted the Senate’s time.
“This is a sad day. The Senate is forced to take up a six month continuing resolution instead of acting upon regular appropriations bills."
"I disagreed with those who used the filibuster against health care reform in 2010, but in both cases I defended their right to do so."
“I did not agree with those who used the filibuster in the 1960s to try and stop civil rights legislation."
"It is true that for some time the use of filibusters has been increasing, but this year it has truly exploded."
“I have never experienced anything like this in my years in the Senate."
"Nearly 30 percent of the Senate’s time this year has been completely wasted...."

This is the plan I’m proposing.It’s a plan that incorporates ideas from many of the people in this room tonight Democrats and Republicans.
"I will protect Medicare," President Obama
I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to the deficit, now or in the future.
No government bureaucrat or no insurance company bureaucrat will get between you and the care that you need.
I will not back down from the basic principal that if Americans cannot find basic coverage we will provide you with a choice
To my Republican friends, rather than make wild claims about government taking over healthcare we should work together.
Consumers always do better when there is choice and competition. That's how the market works.
Individuals will be required to carry basic health insurance just like most states require you to carry a drivers license
If there are affordable options and people still don't sign up for health insurance we pay for their emergency room visits
Under this plan, it will be against the law for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition
