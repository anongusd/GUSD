Gotta wonder how the #Wayfair #SCOTUS decision will affect the few states that do not have sales taxes. Will they jump into the action and put a sales tax on online purchases only, or just use it as an excuse to impose a new tax?
With today's #SCOTUS decisions, there are three outstanding cases from April (including Trump v. Hawaii). The three justices who have not written for April yet are Roberts, Thomas, and Alito. All are very likely to support the travel ban.
This #SCOTUS decision will create massive uncertainty and open the doors to people getting taxed by politicians in other states (who they can't fire if they don't like the taxes). Big problems. https://t.co/ZWdTPTsUbE

The vast majority of people will get sick at some point, &amp; there's very little government can do to prevent that. #MakeAmericaSickAgain
That's not how this works. Most of the debate about healthcare isn't even about care, it's about how it gets paid for. #MakeAmericaSickAgain
America was sick, they think, and then Obamacare passed and BOOM! Sickness healed and America was well. #MakeAmericaSickAgain
