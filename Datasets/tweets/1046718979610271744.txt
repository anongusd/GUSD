@HelenHu90069822 Yes.	And at times, I wish I did still
@vic_tracy 	Hi Vik,	Thank you.		You live your life as you choose and so long as you act in a law abiding manner it does not, nor should not, be anyone else's concern.		There are enough PC morons around without them telling you who to be with.		Take care 	I am not gay just happy.
@HelenHu90069822 	Yes she is all of that 	Lived there in 1980's, 1990's, and briefly 2000.	Had businesses each time as well.	Sydney is not like Melbourne not Perth, definitely not like Brisbane, it is unique.	Tourists may like the Dundee walkabout, but must spend time Sydney
@JustMyStyle579 	Jung,	Thank you
@brithume 	Hi Brit,	Always liked you as a presenter or anchor, because you can anchor any presentation.	True pro.	Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, Peter Arnett, almost but not quite Walter.		Thank you take care.		"Good journalism is a haven; bad, a threat to democracy".
@clubwolfe 	Thank you
@jcpenni7maga 	Thanks
@HelenHu90069822 	Hi Helen,	How is Sydney?
@Luna_Om90 	Gracias
@KAGkraken He loves it doesn't he.		Did you hear about the streaker at the Eastern Zone conference football final.		Ran naked up the players tunnel	(which gives me nightmares)	onto the field of play.		Past 2 Catholic Nuns in the stand?		One had a stroke.	The other one wasn't fast enough.
@KAGkraken Burnt rubber
@raymond_zick 	Thank you Raymond,	Crazy, openly threatening NY	Police and their families.	Must be stopped urgently.
@kiwireportfeed There are a lot https://t.co/fl2JzRDeVl who have only one comment when seeing that photo.		"Would I love to be where that club is right now"		I will leave the rest to your speculative imagination, but say:	"It is all in the grip".
@MelissaBWhite2 	Melissa,	The imagery you use on your site is just amazing.		You have an amazing soul.
@LindseyGrahamSC @JoeBiden Lindsey,	Are you up late?	Or an early riser?	Or both &amp; no comment.		DJT	Did the right thing with Kim.	If he yielded:	1. Keeping China in box gone.	2. North Korea tests start.		Kim and Xie	Need to see this President, as Margaret Thatcher put it:	"is not for turning"		Rest easy LG.
@RealBasedMAGA @JudyMoo64479187 I call that "Motive for Lying".		Like a jilted lover.	Or woman scorned.		Passed over for US Attorney General Cohen lies about everything "to get Trump".		But like a real dummy he got himself.		Should have shut up		Lesson for:	Schiff, Elijah, AOC, Omar, Chuck, Nancy	"no more lies"
@realDonaldTrump DJT		Forget Krassenstein, he is just, - crass.		MS13 Gang Problem	This is your number one.domestic issue right now		These mongrels threaten to kill NY cops &amp; families.		Sir, they need to be dealt to by military &amp; Long Island you know can be closed then "insurgent" searched.
@KAGkraken 		Use liberal tears as lube.		Given all the fake crying, it must be:	"Slippery When Wet"
@NBostar @davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump Yes USA is,	but getting this regimes hands off the levers which could kill 200 million Americans is a bigger priority 		Mr Warmbier is a tragedy of terrible proportion and DJT has not forgotten it, that is in part why he walked, no trust.		Priority, getting their nukes, now!
AMERICA	Critics of President Trump		Who rebuilds USA Armed Forces as part of his strategy		Politicians/Journalists	Loudly claim all rights under Declaration &amp; Constitution but will not defend USA, the country giving them to you.		President Trump builds military, to protect you.
@Lrihendry @BunkHee Yes, except for limited action by Graham, Meadows, Crenshaw, and Hannity they are as absent as they were on passing legislation when they had the House.		Hannity?	Oh, sorry!		He's more active than most, maybe after DJT's 2nd Term it could be President -	I'm kicking butt - Hannity
@blockthisbitch4 @kilroyjc @RepAdamSchiff Further,	You need to improve your language in a public forum.		We are not Direct Messaging so in this public cut the bad language out.		And stop leaping to conclusions which have no basis in fact.		Schiff is an insidious little prat.
@blockthisbitch4 @kilroyjc @RepAdamSchiff Thanks for return.	Problem 	Language usage corrupted.	I said Schiff is queer.	Where I come from that means weird.	You leap to gay		Understand Schiff got money from Congress to settle.		19 ye old did not earn it.	No tax paid.	A settlement.		Tip for You	Follow the money		Take care.
@NBCNews NBC		True 	Your report reflects fact.		Unfortunately	Disappointing your reporters &amp; journalists seem incapable of reading subtle signals.		Real Outcome	If DJT said yes, signed.	1. China	Would kill USA in trade talks.	2. North Korea	Starts testing again.		DJT	Good deal or No deal
@PressSec @HappyManor @realDonaldTrump Well said Sarah.
@KAGkraken Spotted Alaska.		They are forgotten.		It is a harsh environment.		Camped in front of China and Russia.		Then there are the climate issues.
@blockthisbitch4 @kilroyjc @RepAdamSchiff Pal,		I am not interested in that rubbish.		The only things that count are:	1. Congressional Expenditure Schedule.		2. Payment to.		3. Who banked it.		The stuff idiots like you get into is an example of how nuts Democrat backers are.		Schiff is queer.		You are neurotic.		Grow up.
@KAGkraken 	Thank you.	Well spotted.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		That is clever.		Apart from Antarctica, most far flung USA base.		Often forgotten, critical early warning role.		Maybe in down time (ha ha),	fly via New Zealand to visit Antarctica.		Can not recall if Agnew did, or any other President.		First hand look at climate
@rasrivas89 @Jenn198523 Game of Thrones		How appropriate		Renamed		Game of Schumer.		Problem 2-fold:		1. Script will make you Chuck.		2. As a backer you will lose so much money you will need his tissues to cry in.		Chuck	Not star.	Mon-star.
@TimPendergrass7 Poltergeist,		With you watching little Adam Schiff.		He does not have a ghost of a chance.
@blockthisbitch4 @kilroyjc @RepAdamSchiff You clearly want an argument 		You are taking Schiff's side.		In politics there are 2 Rules	1. No such thing as coincidence.	2. Follow the money.		If Schiff was innocent, there would have been no taxpayer money paid out.		Unlike false Trump witch-hunt.	Absolute proof Schiff bad.
@Ilhan OMAR	You ignorant little traitor.		Unlike you Donald Trump before you were born has been engaged in charitable and community acts, for no reward.		You have questionable status.		You take an Oath you break.		In 2020	You will be political history.	President Trump will make history.
@Soledad30777243 	Incredible
@RudyGiuliani @peterwhiteboy1 Rudy.		Democrats	Back yet another loser!		You would have thought after Hillary, they would learn.		Nope.
@realDonaldTrump You have tried hard.		You were looking at Kim's face when the Intel was put.		So you know his surprise 		President Xie will be a very interesting meeting, to keep detente going.		Interesting Poker Game	You, Putin, Xie, Kim.		I will bankroll you.		But would love to be the dealer.
@ChristinaMann2 	Christina,	Unfortunately, Democrats will not let it go.		They think it validates them.		President Reagan carried 49 States.		I think GOP has learnt lesson, if they get House back, pass legislation.		Senate, use Nuclear Option, or you cede power to DNC minority.
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump David,	What is more important.		Accepting word of leader of country that he personally did not know of or order horrific treatment of Mr Warmbier?		Or:		Insult him, when you have no proof, then in a fit of rage, he blows his cool &amp; fires nuclear weapons at Tokyo &amp; Los Angeles?
@BreitbartNews @ressiger1111 @SebGorka @AlexMarlow @SiriusXMPatriot Dr Gorka		I agree.		World been there many times before.		WORST EXAMPLE	Clever but stupid	Bigot	Loud mouthed 	Wanting to take over		WORST REACTION	Appeasement		RESULT	Worst loss of life in history.		HOW	World War 2		WHO	Adolf Hitler		CAUTION	AOC ancestor destroyed Aztecs.	USA next
@GrossmanToni You are welcome Toni
@GrossmanToni 	Hi Toni,	Thank you.		Nice to see someone else has a good thought about DJT.		So many Monday morning quarterbacks, yet they would not even be in the dance.		Take care.
@RepAdamSchiff 	You used USA taxpayer money to pay off a teenager you had sexual relations with when it was not consensual.		You talk of duplicitous conduct.		The boys death was horrific.	The price of life in N. Korea is little &amp; Kim says did not know.		Your payoff = You did know
@EricTrump 		Eric,	To those of us with a brain, your Dad has done so well.		It is a moving feast.		Pressure builds, sanctions remain on China, so China reimburses USA farmer losses.		China pays off deficit, unless they successfully lean on Kim.		Tariffs pay down USA deficit 	QED.
@BeaverGerald 		Go over your State line to Kentucky, to a large building guarded daily by 3 Divisions (60,000 Troops) named for my ancestor Henry Knox.		1st US Secretary of War.		Understand lawyer, my Family has been in this game successfully for hundreds of years		Yours have not
@BeaverGerald @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Really 		And you have had years of actual foreign policy experience.		You have actually sat in on talks like these.		Additionally I have been on 7 United Nations Observer Missions 		Believe me, you are entitled to your opinion , but yours is flawed.		DJT will get it done, not DNC
@HeatherChilders 		One day I will see that you are checked in as	"Following me"		Then I will run down the road yelling "Eureka, Eureka".		Unlike Archimedes I will leave my clothes on, no point in scaring the neighbours away.		Heather, you are beautiful.		Thank you.
@BeaverGerald @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You moron.	Are sanctions still in place.	And if China does not start to pressure North Korea, they will not have the trade deal signed.		So sanctions with China put literally a deficit reducing sum into the USA economy.		This is a negotiation the USA will win, as it acted quickly
@SassyDragonfly @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump You are an idiot 	North Korea is only a pivot point for trade and security with China
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff		Jared Kushner	He is not a mystery.		He is POTUS secret weapon.	He gets things done.	People in work.	Peace treaties	America moving forward.		Adam Schiff	Is the mystery.		You get nothing done	You are a child molester.	How did you get in Congress	2020 get out.
@TheCruelBrat @FinDommes Brilliant!	Class bitch.
Michael Cohen to Congress		Stated	1. He had lied to Congress.	2. He had been convicted of lying.	But	3. He is not a liar.		4. I make 3 points:		4.1 Conviction proof of act.	4.2 His claim is delusional.	4.3 He speaks like a mob boss either:	a. Not bright.	or	b. Mentally afflicted
@RobinHurley10 	Hi Robin,	Thanks early riser.
@seanhannity @RobinHurley10 @POTUS Sean	MS-13 Directly Threatens NY Cops &amp; Families Long Island		How is this not an existential  threat against USA?		Ultimate result of porous border.		PRESIDENTIAL OATH	"...all threats foreign and domestic....."		LONG ISLAND	Close off, martial law, kill Order needed.		Ask POTUS.
@seanhannity @RobinHurley10 @POTUS Sean,	You did very well.
President Trump		MS-13 Gangs in New York.		Your Oath	"...Protect the United States of America from all threats foreign &amp; domestic..."		MS-13 has made credible threat against sworn Police officers &amp; families.		Long Island	Invoke Authority, close Long Island, send in US Military.
@GovMikeHuckabee @angiedetroya You mean he wasn't?		Call him W.C. for convenience, and he flushes with embarrassment.
@paulsperry_ @DJ58091041 Conspiring for the purpose of Perverting the Course of Justice.		A Member of Congress colluding with a criminal, convicted of lying to Congress, &amp; heading to jail, to damage The President of the USA.		Get late-Stephen J. Cannell, there has to be movie in this.		Liars and Morons.
@huston_kristie 	Kristie,	I could not resist.	Poem OK?	You are a night owl?	Sweet dreams
AMERICA	MS13 Gangs Target NY Cops		DEMOCRAT	No existential threat Southern Border.		What of 55,000 MS13 gang members in USA including those deported re:entering illegally, now killing US cops?		POTUS	Seal off Long Island bring in US military, impose martial law, kill if need be.
ODE TO ADAM		Adam is a wanker,	A wanker, a wanker,	Adam is a wanker,	So Schiff-ty is he.		He colludes with Pelosi,	And conspires with Elijah,	Adam is a wanker,	So Schiff-ty is he.		Roll on Elections in 2020.		Adam - "You're fired"
@DonaldJTrumpJr @peterwhiteboy1 Given Criminal Justice Reform passed due to the hard work of your Dad.		Michael Cohen will not last 3 years.		An ironic form of justice.		But to a guy who is a known liar, who was also known in his district for threatening a 12 year old boy.		Real tough guy.		Wanker.
FOX NEWS 	North Korean Talks.		Presenter Jillian Melee	"Let me play the Devil's Advocate".		Sweetheart	There is no way, anyone who looks as gorgeous as you do could ever be a Devil.		Angel	Definitely.		Rob's not bad either.
President TRUMP		USA - North Korea Talks 		ISSUE	Your expose' undeclared sites.		BEWARE	Kim purge to find leaks will be swift and lethal 		TASK	High altitude surveillance.	Protect sources at all costs.		REASON	Next talks.	Kim will not want any Trojan Horses.		He knows you clever
President TRUMP	North Korean - Chinese talks		ONE CERTAINTY KNOWN	USA sanctions remain.		CHINESE CERTAINTY	No deal - sanctions increase		POSSIBLE OUTCOME	Like wounded wild animals they may attack, USA can handle.		PROBABLE OUTCOME	China step up on N.Korea.	Get economic benefits
@Caliicoder3 @RebeccaFaussett COHEN	Given Joel in movies &amp; Leonard in music; you are disgrace to a class name.		You drink at well of DJT's largesse &amp; when your hand is caught in cookie jar you squeal like baby.		3 Yrs in Protective Custody	Criminal Justice Reform means DJT is appreciated.		Your life is over.
@DiamondandSilk @VanhoozerCarol @RepCummings Girls,	As usual.	A dose of commonsense.	Pity Cummings needs whole bottle, teaspoon won't do.
President TRUMP	North Korean Peace Talks	Bump, after 70 years no-one said it would be easy.	Time to leverage President Xie's pressure on Chairman Kim as Sino-USA sanctions are on table subject to deal.	Beware 	DNC ties-Chinese People's Party, if they leverage to hurt trade talks.

@GainVVIP I agree with your philosophy 100%.	.
@GainVVIP 	Carpe Diem!
@tesamarylagvaz1 	You have a great look.
@SILVIADOMI222 	Who is the girl in the picture below the cards in your tweet.
@pasthypogu 	Great site
@Silviadomi22G 	Fabulous face
@apenaspelols 	Very impressive.
@apenaspelols 	Thanks.	Love your attitude.	Have a great day yourself.
@wouldgreys 	Great smile
@apenaspelols 	I was flicking through sites came on yours.	Liked your imagery.	In one of your shots you have a tongue out with a caption.	Saw it	Liked it	Tweeted you.	Hope you do not mind.	Have a great day.
@laurenfloret 	Thank you.
@mjesusgz 	Thank you
@danchantall9 	Great site Danielle.
@Marisa20399139 	Just superb
@120w_max @amwcb6179 I agree.	These crazy morons seek to rewrite history.		The original purpose plus that serving military before they go to war are required to swear an Oath to God and country as they did then must save it.		This is crazy.		2020 House back to GOP &amp; as much of Senate as possible.
@julia_zba 	Stunning eyes and look.
@jcpenni7maga @Trump454545 @ThomasVLinge Great tweet!
@tesamarylagvaz1 	You have an amazing look.
@garciacg17 	That image is so cute.	I pray that is all it is meant to be?	If so, great, the beauty of innocence is so often ignored in this day and age.
Rep. Elijah Cummings(D-MD)		Is an overpaid, over bearing oaf.		Who flagrantly disobeys the Rules by which such hearing should take place.		President Trump would make so many payments in his life, how can he recall all.		Cohen is a proven liar.
@IvankaTrump Ms Trump,	It would be so nice if political differences could be put aside to advance the cause of peace.		But like rats gnawing on a bone Democrats will try all steps to denigrate your Dad and to hell with America.		Washington would adjourn Congress until 19 Jan 2021	for silence.
@Oi__4i 	Thanks, you were quick.	You are up late.
@tesamarylagvaz1 	Tesa Mary,	If I have your right name (?).	Great site, great look.	Please keep in touch

@IsabelPerez1232 	Thank you Isabel
FOX &amp; FRIENDS		Brian Kilmeade		Michael Cohen	Give it a rest.		You act no better than others who just do not get it.		Cohen is a CONVICTED LIAR		In other words he has Zero credibility.		This is not a maybe, if so an Appeal would have been filed, and his jail time stayed.		Grow Up
@TeHenderson14 	Yes it does.		I do not think it was a slur though, it is just that Obama like so many on the left was a theorist.		If you need to see what Trump has done, just look:	1. Hotels.	2. Casinos.	3. Golf resorts.	- including World's Best.		Golf very big in Asia so is DJT
President Trump &amp; Chairman Kim	In Vietnam.		I look at them together &amp; one thing is very obvious.		Hence need for a strong personal relationship.		Please can the USA Press &amp; Democrats not ruin it.		Chairman Kim looks to DJT as his trustworthy &amp; protective Older Brother.		Great.
@Paulkingi1 	Paul,	How are you.	You stirrer.		Miss McCain is no dummy:		1. At Dad's funeral had a go as she was hurting &amp; she believed all she said		2. Now Meghan has realized her Father &amp; DJT agree on a lot of things.		So she will not endorse DJT but she is parallel backing.
Miss MEGHAN McCAIN		Your Daddy's Spirit 		Late Term Abortions.		1. Your opinion is normal.	2. Your opinion is kind.		Stay strong, your Dad often painted a rebel was for most part a centrist.		But always interested in seeing American values to the fore.		You are your Daddy's girl.
@NikkiHaley 	You have so much credibility and known courage, very well done on speaking out on this.		No one supporting this can in the same breath claim to embody the values of The Founding Fathers, nor any who have laid their lives on the line to protect America.		Good girl.
@DustyOldBooksS1 	Thank you Dusty.
@harunarabacisg 	Thank you very much.
@Oi__4i 	Thank you
@LindseyGrahamSC @loverboy12390 @realDonaldTrump Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Mitch McConnell.		Support For President Trump on Border Protection		Today USA can be proud the petulant Democrats who care not one jot to protect Americans were smashed.		2020 your loyalty to DJT will be rewarded with another House majority.
@HappyManor Simply one of finest replies I have seen on Twitter.		One speculates on a female "cow" blue whale being orally adept to handle that monster.		The "bull" male we know talks on multiple levels so is he talking in various languages?		If so he must be our largest cunning linguist?
@HappyManor Brilliant,	Never said better than by a couple of good looking women dressed to impress
@VictoriaD6363 	Like your site

@TeaBoots 	Thank you,	Ruthann
@TrumpsAsianChic 	Thank you very much.
@PublicForum3 	Like your tagline.		Moral	Two wrongs do not make a right.		And	Who the hell wants to see Chuck and Nancy standing together again?
AMERICA		THIS IS NUTS	Democrats &amp; left Media seek by proxy - discredit President Trump deliberately in hope it will flowon to USA business.		Flowon to business will they hope lead to stock price falls &amp; end Trump claim economy doing well.		PROBLEM	401K values will drop badly.
@redpillmamma @AOC I have not even begun to have a go at AOC.		Green New Deal	Total over reach.
@mitchellvii How is your Mother Bill?		In the scale of things, Family comes first, not politicians!		But to comment:	Cohen is a convicted liar.	Cohen is to go to jail for it.	Cohen crossed a very high bar to be sent to jail.		So his testimony on event or circumstance is unreliable.		Appalling
@AOCpress @ForLapua Just dumb.	Leading dumber.	To the dumbest of all.	Nancy, Chuck, and Adam.
@PressSec 	You are a revelation as a Press Secretary for President Trump.		As someone who had contact with DJT back in the 19990's he is a good man &amp; will really appreciate having such a good cog in the wheel.		Sorry you have copped flak.	God Bless.
@MarthaNewsom4 	Thank you Martha.
SCOTUS	American Humanists Action		Seek removal Cross to all War Veterans.		US Supreme Court	Chief Justice Roberts	You are to hear appeal on 9th Circuit Ruling to remove	Based on	Not all soldiers Christian		SCOTUS	All USA military swear Oath to God &amp; USA.	Therefore Cross justified
SEAN HANNITY		Your offer	Rep. Adam Schiff	1 hour your Hannity Show		SUGGESTED TIMETABLE	0-24 Minutes	Cut to shreds		25-49 Minutes	Schiff wiping himself off floor		50-54 Minutes	Schiff uses Chuck's tissues to wipe tears/nose		55-60 Minutes	Exits studio on knees, tail between legs.
@TomiLahren @JamesAndrew1989 Tomi,		Nancy Pelosi	Wears pants suits.		Probably to hide her crooked tired looking legs.		Metaphor	For her crooked, tired looking policies.
@Jenn198523 Because.
@atensnut @randybr04776850 No at Hillary's teacher		Man with no respect:	1. Oval Office (sex with intern in it)	2. Marriage Vows.		Lied on TV about it to America.		Gave Russia US$7Bn to pay its debt.		Told Obama:	1. No bailout Lehman, starts GFC.	2. End Iran sanctions &amp; pay them.		Evil = Bill Clinton.
@Jenn198523 	Yes let's
Maria Sharapova,	Saw a picture of you carrying my favourite breed, a Pomeranian.		Absolutely gorgeous.	So cute.		Now, let's talk about the dog.
Representative Schiff		Mueller Probe &amp; Congress		Weeks ago DNC probed A-G Barr on if he would interfere Mueller.		Now Mueller Report due out &amp; you seek to rewrite US Law which mandates A-G has power to release or not.		Where I am from you would be called a "wanker", Little Adam.
DAN BONGINO		Saw you on FOX		Love the passion 	It is not misplaced 		The Democrats are certifiable.		Rep. Schiff in attitude reminds me of:	Himmler &amp; Goebbels.		Does not care about USA.		All care, No responsibility.		Check out my tweets, today.		Keep strong!
@CindyG1110 	Cindy,	Thank you.
@RealRobGeorge 	Robert George,	Not a bad first name that.	Thanks for the tweet.
KAMALA HARRIS	ELIZABETH WARREN	COREY BOOKER	BERNIE SANDERS	&amp;	HILLARY CLINTON		ALL	Promote unaffordable 'Green New Deal'		ALL	One thing in common.		Historically paid by taxpayer.		PROBLEM	They do not know how to earn money, just how to spend taxpayer money.		TRUMP does know how.
@ForeverLogical @donaldbroom @KamalaHarris I sincerely hope that is meant to show that the move by President Trump on getting prescription costs down is needed as critical step.		Example:	UK every year runs health budget deficit in excess of £230 billion, biggest single shortfall in UK Op.Budget.		Reducing cost critical.
USA Hate Crimes On Rise		Democrat Strategist Tells Us		No wonder.		DNC backers blame Trump!		Really.		COVINGTON	Young man with MAGA Hat	accused of hate crime.	False.		SMOLLETT	Claims MAGA hat wearers attacked him.	False		MUELLER	No Trump-Russian collusion		Hate crime = Democrats
President TRUMP		North Korean talks Vietnam		Home of Schofield Air Base during Vietnam War.		Good Luck		You &amp; Chairman Kim can get a deal done to benefit all.		President Xie is on side.		Peace provides, war does not.		Proven	Sound friends are best won from initial tensions		Do it
@RealJamesWoods 	You always make good commonsense.	Your "suicide watch" is not stupid.	He sounds as wound up as a bamboo spring.		Which raises another issue.		Who put him up to it?		Would he have brains to plan this even though it failed, it nearly did not.		Where's Rahm Emanuel?
President TRUMP		You are doing a job in Office President George Washington would proudly acknowledge is in the best interests of safeguarding the Republic.		America protects the World.		America looks to her President for her protection.		You have not been found wanting.		MAGA
@thecjpearson @Ryder55480709 Well said.	That rubbish helps to keep the divisions real or imagined alive.		It is crazy, when I used to see Donna Summer and now Kelly Rowlands.		Do I think wow what stunning black women, no.		Just what stunning women 		"Content of character"
MR WARREN BUFFET		Criticism President Trump		I was in j/v your mate Bill, I met in 1991, then j/v Ted Arison, Kirk Kerkorian		I know money you're great taking value out of entity.		DJT brash who cares, he embodies USA entrepreneurial spirit.		All rallies gives credit USA workers
@stucam7771 @debeers023 That is just crazy.		Answer me 2 questions:		In world you wish to live who starts businesses which hire people?		Do you think:	1. There is garden with a money tree.	2. Government does.		Tax cuts help millions of small business keep afloat and hiring.		Try owning one theorist!
@RealBungalowMo 	You're not old.	You're matured vintage.	Best with good:	1. Company.	2. Wine.	3. Music.		The era we all come from is going.		The skills, feel, feeling, expression &amp; genuine love of music are going at increasing pace.		It is cruel but true	"time waits for no-one.."
@GrossmanToni 	Toni,	Thank you.	That is a great shame.	Especially as he is by reputation with people I have known a long time, a very nice guy.
@alenameadollar 	Thanks Alena.	Great shame.
PETER FRAMPTON		Peter,	Heard you are ill.		If I can speak for all who are still here who were teens at time "Frampton Comes Alive" was released.		It faced stiff opposition, but triumphed to be No1.		You are very underrated, but great.		Go on tour if you must, but keep safe.		GBPF
@alenameadollar 	Alena,	We both like great music.		Just heard Peter Frampton is nearly finished in his career.		Marvellous performer, even had a stint playing with Stevie Nicks.		If you get a chance look up:	"While My Guitar Gently Weeps"		It will when Peter hangs it up.		Talent.
@brandymstanford 	Thank you Brandy.
Trump &amp; Mueller Probe		Day &amp; Tucker Article	Makes no sense.		They confirm presumption of Report content.		One Question	Given vindictiveness of DNC 2 years post-Election as b4 vote they knew GRU hacked,	why did Obama give money to Iran &amp; end sanctions, when Iran &amp; Russia allies?
@alenameadollar 	Thanks Alena,	How does someone with such good musical taste have so few followers?	Hopefully this lifts that!	Take care
@CoryBooker @Emolclause Senator Booker,	You have lost the plot.		Despair is coming from your Democratic colleagues who are determined to ruin a Presidency to gain power.		Tell me does DNC intend to make permanent:	1. Tax cuts.	2. USMCA.		Or are you (DNC) going to openly ruin USA economy?		USA or BUST?
@NRCC @Vanessa11510588 Yes
@catturd2 @Preacher_BF Just One More Weekend		Another effort like that and you may well be considered for the: NAPFFFA		President Trump thankfully got rid of its close cousin NAFTA.		Your trophy known as:	North American Pussy Food Fish Finding Award		Is not currently on his radar.		Check that KellyAnn.
@Jenn198523 	Hi,	Thank you for tweeting me.	I would be a twit not to tweet you to say, I pray you will tweet me often.	Now I am all a twitter.		I was thinking of lying down to sleep, but not with DNC manifesto, too uncomfortable.		USA does not need 2019-2020 Democrat politics.
@marienassar_ 	Hi Marie,	Like your attitude and imagery.	Thank you for honouring me with a tweet.	May there be many more.
@PardueSuzanne 	Thank you Suzanne,	You honour me.

AMERICA		I am listening to some of the best music ever 		All USA all night long 		AMERICA		You have much to be proud of.		Don't let sad sack Democrats spoil ride USA will have with DJTrump.		MIKE LOVE - Beach Boys	Mr President	You have done so much for music for decades.	No lie.

@charliekirk11 @McgeeverMartin You are still missing the main players.		I believe you seriously want to help, so.		Ring and ask to see Henry B. before he passed away then follow his guidance.		He knows where all the bodies are buried, who put them there, who paid for it.		Do some basic research not speculation
@mikandynothem @Beachbabe661 @DaRealGrizzle @DineshDSouza @KatTheHammer1 @DonnaWR8 @codeofvets @LeahR77 @RealKyleMorris @TheTrumpLady @chuckwoolery That is the technical definition.		But we all know:	Neither Hillary not the Democrats will allow truth &amp; fact to get in the way of a story.		Note	I did not say good story.	There is nothing good about Hillary and her sorry cabal of liars, thieves and despots.		Have a good day.
@wolfpackboss 	Thanks Manny.	Sorry for mispelling your name.
@wolfpackboss 	Thanks Mannie
@HeatherChilders @FoxNews @FoxFriendsFirst @TVNewsHQ Heather,	Thank you 	You should be in DJT's team	Kim would never ever say no.
@SophiaRyan25 	Sophia,	When is your birthday please?
@MelissaBWhite2 		You are simply beautiful.	Most amazing face.		I pray you are happy.		Photographs of your face should adorn every photographic journal to demonstrate simplistic beauty in its most obvious form.		Please keep me in your loop, your photographic gallery is terrific.
@PetmaniaHill 	Hi Lynda
@AnneSmi10408486 	So whine and moan and bitch to me if you wish Anne.		Apart from that, have a great day.
@SophiaRyan25 	Love your site.	The photo image you have used, is that a young Claudia Scheiffer?

@AnnaDAlger 		Anna,		What do I say?	Beautiful site.	Incredibly beautiful images.	Unbelievably beautiful face.		Have you seen the images used by Chris Rea, to accompany his gorgeous music.	(On the beach, Josephine etc..).		He is dying, has such a lovely soul.		Please revert to me.
@sarahcarterhere 	You are right.	Only you can.	If you wish to.
@MelissaBWhite2 		Melissa,		I am very impressed.		Your site is very well organised, your photography spellbindingly beautiful.		Musician Chris Rea uses very beautiful still images to accompany his sound.	(On the Beach etc.)		He is dying.		Please check it out.		Revert to me.
@LauraTDanis1 	Laura,	I love your work.		Have you seen the breathtaking photography used by Chris Rea to portray his music.		Go to YouTube 	"On the Beach"	"Josephine"		He has a terminal illness.	Very sad not long to live.		I thought his beautiful soul may appeal.		Keep in touch

@semljnika 	Daria,	Have a nice day.
@BullPup2A 	Tracy,	Very impressed.	See you follow Dr Gina.	I do also, tweeted 2x recently.		As a male I could feel threatened two beautiful women are frank in their opinions (if I was Democrat),	but not being a wimp, and being a man I feel invigorated.		Keep safe and tweet me pls
@BullPup2A 	Very apt remark on Kamala.
@HeatherChilders 	Heather,	Hope you are well.	Thank you for your support.	You are a real sweetie.
@presaptorbu 	Thank you for your support.	You are new to the forum.	May our numbers grow together.	Take care.
@RickSantorum @GoekeRay You can not support that.	Am I right?
@kjune65 @Larken41 Yes.	She is a prejudiced, pompous, self righteous glib idiot.		One thing DJT is exposing is how stupid so many of the "political elite" truly are.
@linda_kelehan Linda,	I might like to have jabs at a clown like Adam Schiff.		But he will not ever occupy my valuable free time, to the extent I research him.		There would be nothing to find worthwhile.		I believe he has problem in respect of sex with teenage boys.		Not a "fit &amp; proper person"
@BlackLives_MAGA @PDeplorablegirl @RealJamesWoods @RegularJoe25 @AdamSchiff @JussieSmollett Where is the trail of that dragged log through wet mud?		On the brain power shown by the House Intelligence Committee Chairman thus far, he has very little.		Intelligence that is.
@RealJack Trump Attacks Abortions		President Trump, a politician backing words with action.		Over time, abortionists will be regulated out of accepted existence by negating Roe v Wade then it's struck down.		Abortionists claim Planned Parenthood off back of babies lives.		Good on you DJT.
@linda_kelehan 	Thanks Linda.	Schiff is a horrible little man.		He is a man isn't he?	Seems a bit off-base.
@RepAdamSchiff 		Have a nice day.		There were two men like you in the Nazi Party prior to and during World War Two.		Josef Goebbels	Heinrich Himmler		They caused the world much pain and sorrow, for an ideology rooted in evil.		You have demonstrate all of their insidious hallmarks
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff		I concur it must really hard for a man in your position &amp; very frustrating to deal with President Trump, and the White House.		Clearly President Trump is a highly intelligent person.		Whereas	You could not follow the trail of a dragged log through wet mud.
@TeHenderson14 Cut it out.		We know historically that the Communists have brains.		Democrats have provided us with no such proof.
President TRUMP		Not responsible for division which is touted daily as apparent by media.		DEMOCRATS	Hillary Presidential Debates to 2019		Democrats could not beat grass roots call DJT inspired people to hear.		So claimed divisive.		His hats are attacked.		The hats do not attack.
@RepAdamSchiff 		I often have a go at you.		Serious question.		As Chairman of House Intelligence Committee 	You are reliant upon those agencies which supply critical intel.		Have you tasked time &amp; resource to evaluate damage done in past 20 years due to cuts by President Clinton?
@RepAdamSchiff @RepJerryNadler @RepMaxineWaters @RepRichardNeal @RepEliotEngel @RepCummings Representative SCHIFF 		You know USA Law.		You know A-G Barr has total discretion over release of the Mueller Report.		Try any underhanded move and you will be in breach of your Oath of Office.		A-G Barr does not need your biased advice.		Be intelligent	Go and watch grass grow.
@EdKrassen @HillaryClinton Ed		You are not very bright.		Throughout history:	Illegal abortions existed.		This move will do 2 things at once:		1. Reduces legal abortions.		2. By increased use exposes 	illegal actors to law enforcement 		Unless, as a Dem, you back crime.		Illegal abortions happen daily.
USA - KOREAN Peace Talks		Democratic Party Stupidity 		WHAT GAME IS THIS?	President Trump meets Chairman Kim.		SAME DAY	Cohen appears before Congress.		QUESTION	How can this show USA in the best possible light?		Do Democrats want nuclear war, both at home and abroad?
QUINCY JONES	29th January 2019	Passing of James Ingram		May I offer to you, sincerest condolences on the recent loss of your musical Son Mr James Ingram.		You may recall my face from times with Mr Gordi &amp; Mr Barsalona.		James had a gift you gave to the world.		Sadly, I thank you.
To:	The Family of James Ingram		Lost to us 29/01/2019		To Debra (married 44 years)	To Phillip (Son)		To 	Quincey Jones	Patti Austin	Linda Ronstadt		I did not know.	Too much useless noise.		What a performer.		"One Hundred Ways"		A recipe for loving your lady by a man who knew how.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Ronna,	To be blunt.	Because Kamala &amp; Smollett are symptomatic of why people if colour have been vilified too long too often.		She is really clever shoots him in the back herself in the foot and takes aim at DJT.		President Trump has a one word answer to these morons:	"missed"
@charliekirk11 @AlphaGlobalCorp You have a following.		If you want to win arguments you must attack people at their core.		That is why I was champion debater, not a mass debater.	(Not aimed at you)		I used circular argument on Harris about giving People more money.		To show she is saying what DJT is doing.		GB
@NancyJKoch @HinksonIrving @realDonaldTrump @VP How can they do that?!		Even if woman was in a life threatening position they can use a C-section with an almost 100% success rate.		There is only one way to deal with this absolute nonsense.		Given at that age they are a living being, a Doctor doing this must breach their Oath.
Harry Potter &amp; the Philosopher's Stone		I have never watched any HP but had a feeling &amp; watched my friend late John Hurt be his usual classy self.		Co-starred with cousin in Man for all Seasons.Used to hold acting NZ classes.		John Hurt you are sadly missed, you had a rare talent
SMOLLETT,	Liar, overpaid, making up accusation &amp; using props to suggest connected to President Trump.		McCABE	Liar, overpaid, making up accusation against President Trump.		COHEN	Liar, overpaid (by fraud), guilty - making up stories to implicate President Trump		Who is next?
@DABIRDISDEAD 	Thank you
@charliekirk11 @808CONSERVATIVE Charlie,		What about GFC &amp; Trillions of USD$ in Debt accrued under Obama due to Henk Paulsen being told, DO NOT bailout Lehman Bros.		Clinton gave Russia USD$7Bb to settle World Bank default.		Lehman refused to pay in so Clinton repaid this via Obama, GFC nearly ruining USA.
@TomFitton 	How can New Jersey do that?		Surely new A-G Barr will ask the Supreme Court for a Ruling striking this down.		Further, forbidding other States from invoking such a move.		Have these States which owe so much money, got so little respect for taxpayers they can waste $$.
@KamalaHarris AG Kamala Harris		Put Money In Americans Pockets		Wonderful thought		But Democrats tax it back.		Hence TAX CUTS.		You wish to help Americans		VOTE for DONALD TRUMP.		You support his policies.		PRESIDENT TRUMP	Puts MONEY BACK in the HANDS of the PEOPLE		How generous		God Bless.

@ewarren Senator Warren		Student Loan Debt.		Only 2 solutions:		1. Forgive all debt, to ensure no unfairness re:courses.		2. Work at politics to make easier for business to:		2.1: Employ more educated workers.		2.2: Pay staff higher rates of pay so they may pay down debt more quickly.

@TTOPSSS 	Hey TTOPSSS	Thanks you for your tweet.
@davidfrum 	Thanks David,		There are journalists.	Then there are journalists who pay attention.	You fall firmly into the latter category.		Well done.
@alexiskennedy 	Thanks Alexis.
@DanBender_SJ 	Dan,	You have retired.		Two comments from me:	1. Given the times do you regret retiring.	2. You must be glad of being able to post on Twitter.		Keep safe, keep having an opinion.
@NeilFinn 	Hey Neil,	Sounds like some people are the human representation of "four seasons in one day".		You have had applause and a level of criticism over your being in Fleetwood Mac.		Let the critics try it on, while you appreciate the honour it is not easy 		Lindsey is well??
@buffisnraged 	Hello Enraged,	We all are, at some stage.	What has your ire presently.
@MCraft0925 	Hi Matt,	Thank you for your tweet.
@parscale 	Hey Brad,		You I am envious of.		You have the opportunity to help engineer the re-election of the most deserving President of the USA in my lifetime.		Well done pal!
@adamhgeller 		Adam,		Keep up the good work.		Now, more than ever, with the revelations of Andrew McCabe and a conclusion to the Mueller Probe possible.		The People need to know how their President is doing.		Your job, well done.
@KellyannePolls 	Kellyanne,	Thank you.		You are just brilliant.		You, and all the other ladies in the Administration, but in particular you.		Show how this President is actively embracing equality in the workplace on merit.		And you are very meritorious.
@AJGuglielmi 	Anthony,	Thank you.	You and yours do a tough job.		I do not know if you are able to respond, but a simple ask:		Surely a President who is prepared to attack some of the levers of crime (drugs, gangs) frees you up to be even more people focused?		And reduces the risk
@MamaMadisons 	Hi Jane,	Thank you and that is so true
@HeatherChilders 	Thanks Heather,	Great show.	Now you have to get the big man on as a guest.	Just ask him, he will not say no, you are commonsense.	Keep it up girl.	Follow me.	Kind regards.
America	New York Twin Tower Attacks		Some have this Michael Moore driven stupid belief Bush Family involved in attack.		Worst fake news ever.		Like saying FDR gave Hira Hito clearance to attack Pearl Harbour.		President Clinton fault not Bush.		He cut USA Intel budget to 2001.
@dbongino @JANIGAYL Dan,	Keep up the commonsense.		Maybe DJT will come on your show.	(Hannity, Laura, Judge)		You with Heather &amp; Cavuto are slightly behind.

@mitchellvii @Donadeedooda How is your Mum, Bill?
@SpeakerPelosi @OversightDems @HouseIntel Speaker Pelosi,	Give it a rest.	You care not one jot for your Party or the political balance it provides the USA.		Cohen, McCabe, Comey, Clinton, have all lied, once a liar, always one.		Americans deserve a break, from the relentless assault on their President.		DJT wins, it ends
@ewarren Mrs Warren		As an eco-friendly candidate		1. Do you have a campaign bus?		2. Is it petrol, diesil, LPG?		3. You know all are fossil fuels?		4. You do know by-product of drilling to extract natural gas is METHANE?		5. Do you stay in hotels?		Time to head home.	Pack up your TeePee.

@MsAvaArmstrong 	Thank you Ms Ava.		There has to be a good book out of this McCabe matter.		What with Carter/Page and Steele documents plus the force of personality of DJT.		Tastefully written, copies signed by DJT with a small payment to an American charity.		Go for it.

@DiamondandSilk @jennife38666052 Brilliant girls.		You are full figured African American girls rocking FOX and proud to do so.

@NikkiHaley Mrs Haley,	I have huge respect for you.		However,	I am not an American, despite my Family history.		I look at that interview dispassionately.		Watch it again, v. carefully 		McCabe stated Rosenstein brought matter to him quite clearly after he received guidance		From 40th via who
@JustMyStyle579 	Let us not forget Waters fake tan.
@We_Have_Risen @TiwariLalmani @Avery1776 It's OK Andrew McCabe		We are stressed too.		We can not figure out if you for your unselfish act, get:		1. A 12mm rope - to be hung by.		Or		2. A firing squad using NATO 7.62mm or 9mm rounds.		Or		3. 30 years to life without the possibility of parole, in Fort Leavenworth.		Idiot
@realDonaldTrump Yes,	That is one of the many disgusting things.		If you play someone in sport or compete against them in business, or for the hand of a beautiful woman and you win, you don't crow, you have not.		If you lose, do so graciously.		Nor do they thank you for giving them a good story.
@The_Monarch 	Great knowledge.	I was surprised Herb Alpert had become so rich.	He really is so talented.	Soundtrack to so many lives	Including mine.		Thank you for replying.	We can not let these political morons dominate a forum.		Good to have dig at them, but life is for living.
@BBCBreaking Nice to see party loyalties are to the fore.		Voted in under one Party agenda, then jump ship in what in business would be a gross breach of contract 		If you want to jump ship, go back to your electorate and ask your voters for their mandate.		Or do you lack the courage.
LINDSEY &amp; KIRSTEN BUCKINGHAM		Lindsey,	You are not forgotten.		I pray you do not mind me checking up on a musical architect of our lives.		To you both, I pray everything on the mend.		We can live with memories, Son, you have nothing to prove.		Except to love your Family.		Love RS

@RealJamesWoods @starlowell They are just nuts James.		Or, caught with their pants down, they are making up excuses.
@RealDrGina Very.		The beauty of it is this.		1. President Donald Trump has a much wider base than is openly apparent.		2. One year after becoming President, DJT woke up to fact he is POTUS, and he is now full on.		This is a man who will shape history, because he does not have an ego.		GB Dr
@StellaH14038233 	To a degree you are right.	However,	The Rule of Law 	Is the Rule of Law.		I do not believe William Barr will be so tolerant of a sworn person violating legal order.		But like so many,	You do not grasp	Bill Clinton is puppetmaster	He knows all the rules &amp; levers.
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff		For a man who is the Chair,	of the:	House Intelligence Committee.		You are not very bright.		In 2020:		The Democratic Party		will suffer its worst defeat since Reagan.		You will be partly to blame.		Wait until Party is vindictive on you.		Ouch!

@DashHaber USA Lower Courts		SITUATION	Judges are lawyers who have climbed the ladder.		No doubt many on Lower Court benches have big egos.		MY PROBLEM	No Lower Court should stall Trump Act, but may do so to get higher Court case law set.		I believe that to be a gross waste of public money.

@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews David,	As I pointed out the other day.		Penalty for treason in USA is Death.		That was why I highlighted to DJT 5 days ago, if some nutter, on a belief created by these dickheads had taken a potshot, someone else may have been hit.		DJT is now very angry lucky he is not cruel.
@dm1299 @Jenn198523 You are right.	My apologies.	Like any band, sometimes lineup needs revisiting.		Could have named it:	DJT &amp; The We The People Band.		Hard call, nose in it.

@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Tom,	Like the work you do.		Ironically,	I do not believe Court Judges will act like that.		I may be wrong, but they also swear an Oath, further they realize the Oath of the Supreme Court which really validates DT Declaration.

@mitchellvii @ShirleyRinguet5 Bill,	When DJT introduced his brand of reality show it threw the default script out.		Exec's. were losing millions in sponsorship revenue.		They had to start again from behind.		Critics you hear are being pushed by serious industry players, whom DJT cost money by his innovation.
A man in 2016 came to DC.,	To work with, an open heart,	And flush out a swamp, bigly.		Works hard, will to the end,	Right over wrong, he says,	People on me, you can depend.		So now he gives Dem's a thump, 	Emergency crisis, to protect USA,	That's our man, President D. J. Trump

@RepAdamSchiff Rubbish.		Congress has that power providing it acts responsibly		Constitution vests Executive Power in The President.		Also gives President right to set adjournment.		Congress has NO power if NOT in session.		Congress not in session vesting means President can rule by Exec.Order.

@ScrewedHumans Why is President Attacked?		President Trump represents something seldom seen in Washington.		He can not be threatened or co-erced.		Critically	A lifetime at top he knows skeletons.		He knows when an opponent is lying, and why.		That is the most potent of weapons - embarrassment.
Mr President,	Executive Authority		You have to assert Authority over Congress before gone.		1. Congress usually sets recess date.		2. You adjournment duration		3. Congress passes Bills only when in Session		4. EO Executive Authority vests in President to protect USA from Congress

ATTORNEY-GENERAL BARR	(Real)		Sir,	You advocate Rule of Law.	When Member of Congress swears Oath of Allegiance, they are bound in all they say &amp; do.		Thus, any advocate of status quo at Sthn Border can not be protecting USA from ALL threats Foreign &amp; Domestic 		Please sanction
@RepMaxineWaters @NancySinatra Rep. Waters.		American people will not join an action which harms them		Deaths caused by illegals, or drugs which come over Southern Border are not to be celebrated		You are in breach of your Oath of Allegiance, to protect USA from all threats foreign &amp; domestic.		Please resign.
@realDonaldTrump @Beachbabe661 Donald,		You are doing the right thing.		Since when are the deaths of 20,000+ Americans every year either directly at hands of illegals, or drugs through the border not Emergency.		Neither 9th Circuit Court nor Supreme Court Justices will Rule that situation remains status quo.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump That is a lie..		You are not permitted to lie.		Do that again &amp; I will see if grounds exist for your dismissal from New York registry as "not a fit &amp; proper person".		Rep. Pelosi told President, Bill would not pass House.		It did &amp; Democrat Senators did not get it to 60 votes.

@JennyLynnO1 @AOC How does a person like this get into Congress.		Was she at the "tippy top" of available Democrats.		Lucky New York is so well represented in the Senate by Democrats?		By a bigger dummy = Chuck		Makes you sick.
Vladimir Putin's most memorable photo ops https://t.co/CagWBRDvPV
VLADIMIR PUTIN		Siberian Tiger Cub	Just saw a photograph of you with a tiger cub in a basket.		Taken at your Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside of Moscow.		Classic picture.		Just brilliant.		Phone President Trump.		Take care.
@ScottPresler @Joeyinwi @AOC GANGS &amp; Democrat Party		This issue most Democrat politicians, refuse to deal with, despite loss of USA lives.		Post-Civil War	Democrats known for close ties to killer renegade gangs, &amp; when in power for giving them amnesty		eg: Quantrell's raiders after Bosanquet Quaker massacre.
@Joeyinwi @AOC Well said
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump President Trump		His title, not his Twitter handle; is not shredding The Constitution.		You confirm swearing an Oath of Allegiance 3x as Senator since 2006.		Why will you not protect &amp; defend USA from all threats both foreign &amp; domestic?		You have had 30+ years.		Your time is up.
@SenSchumer 		New Yorkers		NY big vibrant city, many types of people, you are now learning why DT is successful.		You are a talker.		Donald Trump is a doer.		You &amp; Nancy with Reid etc.. could have fixed this, didn't.		Wall completed by 2020.		DT re-elected.		As your BOSS 		Enjoy.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator Schumer	You &amp; Speaker Pelosi claim Comprehensive Immigration Reform needed, not President's vanity project.		Thank you for giving POTUS his point of fact to SCOTUS.		You/Pelosi in Congress 30+ years, enough time.		President gave you two years + last chance &amp; you failed.
Chris Wallace - FOX		Emergency Powers		Question	Why are you such an apologist for the Democrat Party.		When members of that Party clearly have had involvement with this McCabe plot.		Question 	Why do you not understand that Americans are dying due to the porous Southern Border?
@DonaldJTrumpJr @KathleenFiscel1 @JordanSchachtel DJT Junior		I love your Dad, due to courtesy he paid me 2x in 1995, when he did not need to do anything.		I still have original letters he couriered to me with his gold embossed Trump Enterprises Incorporated on.		Know that:	McCabe &amp; co-conspirators endangered whole Trump Family.
@university_fox That girl.	Great smile	(and....)	Great smile.
@AGWilliamBarr And then approach your day		No holes BARRed
@SenFeinstein NO NATIONAL EMERGENCY		Did you side with Speaker Pelosi &amp; refuse to meet Angel Mum &amp; Dad's.		NO NATIONAL EMERGENCY		Tell that to families of Law Enforcement Officers killed by illegals over last 15 years		They Swear an Oath like you		APPEASEMENT	Kills Americans.	Just like WW2.
FOX &amp; FRIENDS		Great day for US Democracy.		1. Your Question	 Where outrage re: McCabe?	- America has not absorbed just how serious this is.		Furore still to come.	(Pelosi/Durbin - out)		2. President Trump has been hounded due to a plot.		NB	Ocasio-Cortez	An unmitigated idiot
@codeofvets @Cb59Carolina75 Love your presentation.		Your perspective is correct.		Footnote:	If I were an enemy combatants (which I am not) &amp; facing you, I would be stuffed.	You are stunningly beautiful.		I pray for the soldiers General Counsel for USAF &amp; Joint Chiefs act to end this travesty.		Good luck.
@Koolology I have no inside knowledge, but Donald Trump is a first-class lateral thinker.		I believe he has permission of Constitution to protect USA from all threats:	1. Physical.	2. Financial	restated in 1976, then he can act.		There is no doubt he gave Congress their chance.
@RepAdamSchiff Rep. Schiff.	It is not unconstitutional.		You claim to be intelligent.		Think on this.		Were you consulted in any way to do with McCabe plot?		This is no game:	You swore an Oath of Allegiance.		If you knew &amp; failed to advise The President or Chief Justice you are in deep trouble.
@cvpayne Thanks for your impartial reason Charles.		Always liked you, nice to know some standards never change.
@Koolology Personally I do not like he has, I don't believe he is beaten.		So many moving parts to this, plus media is so parochial, are we told enough?		Example	Did he decide to act because he knew what McCabe was going to confirm.		McCabe means Democrats at high levels guilty of treason.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump I pray you had nothing to do with McCabe's conspiracy to overthrow an elected President of The USA.		You are a sanctimonious prick, for whom I have no regard, but America will be shamed if with Speaker Pelosi you helped this plot.		Statutory penalty is Death by hanging.
@KimKardashian Kim &amp; Kanye		Well done.		Kenny is just phenomenal.		Have a great Valentine's
@Tiraeche @realDonaldTrump Granted.	You are right.
@AGWilliamBarr Have you been to see Elton John on his farewell Tour?		My Godson Dr Knox, you, and EJ could all be from same pod.		Life is not always serious.
@AGWilliamBarr @AmyRMartin1976 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump AG Barr		Welcome back into Office.		Nice to see the Rule of Law.		Sir,		Many will suggest things.		Respectfully,	May I ask you look at McCabe issue as Treason.		Post-President Lincoln's demise, traitors hung, incl:	woman.		Spkr Pelosi is in McCabe up to her neck.		Happy hunting!
PRESIDENT TRUMP &amp; AMERICA		Sir,	Among WH detail are some of USA best shots.		Ask them about accuracy.		McCABE	His treachery could have led nutter to shoot at you, what if they missed, got FLOTUS.		SIR,	Time for you to get very ANGRY		Pelosi/Schumer/Lieu/Mattis all knew about this
@DavidWohl @realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson David,	I like you.	But you are not tough enough.		This treason.		Statutory Penalty = Death.		What if a maniac in their conspiracy, or nutter, had shot POTUS?		This is NOT a game.		McCabe must be executed.		Donald Trump would be the kindest POTUS ever if he spared him.		Charge all
@Joanand20255781 @Jenn198523 @SpeakerPelosi EMERGENCIES	Democrats ignore facts.		QUESTION	McCabe	Did Senior Democrats know what McCabe engaged in?		If so, treason.		QUESTION	Have Democrats wrongfully attacked this President,:	1. To get him to crack?	2. To cover their tracks?		POTUS 	Must Order DNC checked out.	Maybe Barr.
@SpeakerPelosi Your hypocrisy is appalling.		You rightly eulogize Parkland.		Yet you will not meet Angel Mum &amp; Dad's.		You have missed one fact:	No Judge will overturn National Emergency Declaration, when supported by numbers of SWORN Law officers KILLED by illegals.		Chuck &amp; you are too smug.
JUAN WILLIAMS - FOX		You asked why was President Trump having private conversations with Putin.		Every President has private conversations with the President of Russia		Russia is 2nd most powerful.		That is why the HotLine was  put in.		Conspiracies still.	After McCabe.	Grow up.
NATIONAL DISGRACE		ANDREW McCABE	Publicly declared he &amp; others engaged in Act of Treason		Treason discovered when Washington &amp; Lincoln were Presidents resulted in the traitors being executed.		McCabe should be in jail 		He &amp; all others must face treason charges &amp; death penalty.
President Trump		Democrats are crowing.		Why?	Because yet again comprehensive Immigration Reform is gone from table.		Issue	Voter registration &amp; voter ID		To prepare case for	Natl.Emerg.		Get stats over last 15 years of sworn law officers killed by illegals.		No Judge can ignore.
@DLoesch Respectfully,	Democrats already can.		Old rule	"There is no precedent until one is set"		Pelosi Point	Gun violence 	Sure, very serious.		But she suggests a National Emergency could be declared, in peacetime, to upend the Constitution's stated right of The People    "to bear arms"
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse President TRUMP	Democrats ruin your Presidency.		Pelosi &amp; Schumer believe they run the show.		Get 14 day CR.		Pelosi ignores previous National Emergencies.		Separate Bill	1. All excluding	2. HS &amp; Wall		Congress ignores US Border Guards costs 		Sign 1.	Adjourn Congress	Singh
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Russian Probe Against You	McCabe	Now America knows truth.	Democrats	Are exposed		Best Defence	Good Offense		BILL	1159 pages do not sign	CR for 14 days	Congress stays		Redraft	50% of $25bn in 2019	50% of $25bn in 2020		Or Congress	Adjourned on recess to 19/01/2021
@jeangalvanonly 	Thank you.		America would support a Bill providing proper Border security wouldn't they?
@Tweets4MAGA Did Congress pass a Rule allowing the wearing of headscarves by women.		Because MEN are NOT allowed to wear HATS.		Oh sorry.		That's called		MANNERS ##########		What happens next, suicide bomber in full garb comes into Congress posing as woman?		They only have to be right once.

@huston_kristie 	Kristie thank you.
@RightParent You are VERY.polite.
President TRUMP		Request 14 day CR.	Demand		Advise you want the Bill to be named		SINGH		To honor Officer Singh.		1. Line item veto.		2. Amend the numbers.	(50% of total needed)		3. Protect ICE.		4. T &amp; C's repeated in 2020	(Wall, Ice etc)		So work completed by 2020 election.
@GovMikeHuckabee 		Contact President Trump immediately &amp; give him leverage over Bill.		Have him demand 14 day CR	(It is 1200 pages)		1. Bill named "SINGH" honor Officer Singh &amp; 5 mth old boy	America will agree		2. Line item veto	3. Amend as reqd. ($$}	4. T &amp; C's to repeat in 2020
@heyhoppaJim @Jenn198523 @GOP Schumer.		Respectfully I tender the only thing Schumer has in common with the Bard is that both surnames start with S.		Shakespeare was brilliant.		Schumer	"Could not follow the trail of a log through wet mud"
@MatthewCharti11 @Jenn198523 With respect National Emergency authorized by an Executive Order.		President's Powers come from Articles.		Amendments are changes amending Constitution.		Constitution is in 4 parts:	1. Articles.	2. Amendments.	3. Rules of Application.	4. Case Law.		Articles set in stone.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Demand Bill be named:	"SINGH" for 5 month old boy.		Unless you can sign it, use 14 days CR to:		1. Line item veto as needed.		2. Amend as required.($$}		3. Augment your changes with sworn document of DHS supporting your changes.		4. Demand T &amp; C's repeated 2020.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President		You are to receive a 1200 page Bill you have not a show in hell of reading in the timeframe.		Democrats are trying yet again to Yank your chain, Schumer even trying to tell you how to do your job 		Instruct MCConnell to issue you a 14 day CR.		Tell Chuck get stuffed

President Trump		Demand a 2 week CR now.		That allow you to	1. Examine the Bill.	2. Veto parts not liked.	3. Make adjustments you want.	4. Re-present.		How can this single issue with side matters be filibustered into Bill of hundreds of pages which in timeframe you can not review
@gatewaypundit @JacobEngels President Trump	Mueller v Stone v Barr		Sorry to put on your plate.		But America wising up to you, one of very few honest voices near politics.		If Mueller leaked re:Stone to CNN, drawn weapons in use, can Barr sack Mueller.		Whittaker staying may be more viable if Barr will not.
@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @MjrCitiesChiefs @MCSheriffs What are you going to do when the Special Counsel clears President Trump?		Are you going to be a man and apologize.		Or is the truth that Special Counsel investigation or not he has a target on his back and you keep going.		Which is it, admit wrong or prove you are biased?
@ewarren Mrs Warren,		Are you suggesting if the USA is attacked, more particularly by nuclear weapons, it does not have the ability to respond.		A reply would be war.		So you are saying President can not protect America.		But Obama could.		You are not only a liar, but a traitorous fool.
@CliffShep 		Thanks Clifton.		As a USA Army veteran		1. Thanks for your service.		2. You and your fellow soldiers must grate your teeth when you see and hear politicians who will not secure the border of USA.		Slap in the face to your service.
President Trump		Border Security		1. Sign 2-week CR.		2. Congress	2.1. Lift to US$3.6bn		2.2. ICE beds gone		2.3. Number of miles of wall build gone.		2.4. Access to appropriated unused funds in Escrow with identified US Depts		2.5. Mandated 2020 provision of (2.1) &amp; (2.4) above.

@trex44820 @Jenn198523 With Donald you can, he always has a Plan B, and if that fails Plan C, then Plan D		And those don't work then you get a bit of New Yorker into it.		Go back to Plan A, grab it shake it, kick the Mob out, then implement it.		Works.
@GOP Collusion delusion.		Schumer stoomer.		Pelosi &amp; Schiff		Look a bit stiff		As they failed yet again		To quiet this Presidents pen		Try as they might		They ain't got it right		Trumps done nothing wrong		As he has said all along.		Two years of pure farce		Sat the DNC on its arse.
@SenSchumer The amount of drivel which emanates from your mouth is exceeded only by its stupidity.		Why don't you or Pelosi have guts to meet Angel Mums &amp; Dads, who have lost relatives to illegals.		Because you would be admitting President Trump is right.		You are safe 2020, lucky.		Bludger.
@culttture @BigOli269 @BetoORourke @PhilPrazan This is a President who is trying to stop a scourge killing thousands of Americans every year.		And that is how you react.		You are lucky, very lucky to have such a President in power.		The stupidity of your attitude enhances why he is needed, because you do not have a brain.

@Paulkingi1 	Hey Paul.		Pretty obvious I would think.
President Trump	No shutdown.		Schumer will be smug.	2020 he gets off scotfree.		If you:	1. Avoid shutdown.		2. Refuse ICE reduction.		3. Refuse scraps, which don't give other $1.6Bn.		4. Exec.Order &amp; argue Congress admits problem but won't fund.		American voters will be with you.
@Koolology Thanks.	You too.
President Trump	Border Deal		Sir,	Do you have line item veto power on this deal?		Then take out:		1. Reduction in ICE beds		2. Restraints upon how funds are spent, which makes it appear as if Congress knows what Border Guards have stated they need.		If DNC retracts	Exec.Order.
@Koolology Thank you for the decency of your response.		And you are 100% right.		Personally he is in a hell of a bind, he does not want to furlough those people, does he give away chip and Exec.Order or use other fund		And that ICE bed redn crazy.		Why won't Dem's protect Americans?	Treason

Still is, El Paso used to be a vipers pit.		Modern times, yes crimerate is down, without a doubt in part due to wall.		You did well.
@BBCWorld Katy,		Who would.think you would intentionally do something with that implication.		Sometimes it pays to keep a low profile.		Robert Kwok (Shangri - La, Hotels) has favourite saying:	"Tall trees attract strong winds"		Is Orlando behaving himself?		God Bless you both.

@DeanDearinger 		Hi Tony,		9th Circuit Ruling.		DT is reminding them all that in deal making fools rush in.		As in war victory is more often than not, won by exercising patience.		At least then you can see the lie of the land.		God Bless.
@Koolology 	Are you crazy.	Folding has never been on table.	Ironically, Corey Booker used a name to describe what he called as a "moment"		Spartacus		Do you know the story.		Faced by three he ran, they chased, separating, he turned, took them one at a time.		Not Corey.		Hi Donald
Speaker Pelosi		Please try:	Meghan Markle's	ELEMOR Cream		It will Improve your looks.		You are looking very tired, &amp; bitter &amp; twisted.		It fixes wrinkles.		Give some to Chuck, it may straighten him out.		Given 9th Circuit Court's Ruling, the Democrat Party can pack up its tent.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President		El Paso	Showed shutdown not needed.		You have hearts &amp; minds of majority Americans		Hold high ground:	1. Veto ICE clause.	2. No other $1.6Bn you sought.	3.

President Trump		Committee Proposal		Even Obama's Border Chief rejects ICE bed reduction.		If you have other funds to add to $1.36Bn to make it up call DNC bluff.		Take money but VETO ICE bed reduction.		Bet DNC withdraws.		Then:	1. Go to SCOTUS	2. Order USAF as CnC to build.

@parscale @realDonaldTrump Because they have come to see The President of The United States of America.		A man who stands for USA.

@Joeyinwi 	Thank you Jo Co.
@HeatherChilders Heather,	You need to talk to your man about that.		If there was more desire to watch a fireworks display, in contrast to going to bed to be properly loved, then the man loving you, is simply not inspiring enough for you.		Love your show, great to have you back, you are a beauty.

@TomFitton DT	Is in much better health than he should be, because he is tough.		There is a reason why men in physical working roles go to his rallies and vote for him, because he can roll his sleeves up.		No drink, no smoking.		DT wants to get on with taking USA into the future.
@ChuckGrassley Well done.

@realDonaldTrump Good Luck		Hope you are taking the January 2012 - December 2018 El Paso crime statistics with you.		These were absent from all arguments put forward by critics of you.		They covered 2006-2011.		They know the truth backs your claims.		In memory of an AllStar:	Belt it out of Park.
@peterboykin 	Thanks Peter.	At least DT is sane &amp; normal
@GeorgeTakei Mr Sulu,	Chart a different course.		Clearly someone paying less tax is going to have less to claim back.		You are an intelligent man.		Surely only argument is post tax pay workers take home.		Can you publish those figures.		Mr Sulu,	I would expect you to be neutral, facts count.

@JoeFreedom1732 	You are right.	Truth is foreign to Democrats.
@PaulEmbery @terencehooson You are talking about Iraq.		Unfortunately it was needed.		Truth has not been told.

@michaeljohns @ROHLL5 Correct.

@davidaxelrod @amyklobuchar Mr Axelrod,	Her bridge collapse into Mississippi, another Democrat deception.		Bridge collapsed as river salt air corroded all bolts.		President Clinton to zero deficit took FHMW monies including R&amp;M for bridge, due every 2 yrs.		Collapsed start of Bush.		People died in collapse.
@RickAyres9 Understand.	I come from a military family		As my Father (97), WW2 vet says, they want you to serve and when your serving you are cannon fodder, when you are out they want to forget about you, and both times they treat you like shit.		Maybe we can get it fixed.		Worth a try.
@RickAyres9 No harm in my saying that as I do not know you.	But no offence meant.		Re: The President.	I just flicked off a tweet in a general way to Donald and if he sees it he will act.		He is nothing like way Democrats paint him he does care, but lot of times people do not inform him.
@realDonaldTrump PRESIDENT TRUMP		URGENT - PRIORITY		VA Disabled Veteran	Rick Ayres		Here on Twitter.	His handle is in replies to me.		The system is not working for him, still.		Details count.		Show the USA Vet Rick Ayres matters.		Then Democrats have NO defence.
@RickAyres9 Rick,	That is disappointing.	Have you written direct to President Trump?	If you have been straight with me, and I have no doubt you have been, let's cut through the bureaucracy and go to the top.
America	When will Democrats tell you truth?		PRESIDENT CLINTON		1. To zero deficit:	1.1. Cut FHMA	Mississippi bridge failed.	1.2. Cut Intel Budget	09/11/2001		2. Gave USD$7Bn to Russia	World Bank default.	Lehman refused.		PRESIDENT OBAMA	NO Lehman bailout - collapsed	GFC began
Senator Amy Klobuchar	Mississippi - I35W Bridge	Campaign launch talks of collapse of bridge into Mississippi.		CAUSE	Bill Clinton to zero deficit took $884Bn of FHMA budget		Including bridge R&amp;M to replace bolts every two years - sea air corrosion Mississippi		Intel budget = 9/11
@SenSchumer USA	Will have good fortune.		If you work with an elected USA President.		Are American People to suffer &amp; world retrench economically because Democrats in House &amp; Senate will not co-operate with President Trump.		Also applies to 2020-2024 as President Trump will be re-elected.

@cananyonecme Are you nuts.		The reason you can speak or tweet so freely is down to a USA military which protects you, even when you do not ask for it.		Go and watch a Western, or ask people after tsunami in 2004.		USA military unselfishly and at cost of lives, steps into a void to save lives.
President Trump		Rumours - Unbelievable	You are to blame for Bezos troubles.		USA Historically	Been Here Before.		Jesse James Gang	Accused of robbing bank and train one day apart.		Problem	500 plus miles apart, no train link.		Naive Chicago papers	"Jesse James Gang Again"		QED.
President Trump	Southern Border Security.		You knew this would happen	Everyone focused on $5.7bn		No-one has mentioned other $1.6Bn you wanted + $5.7bn		Committee	Give us details.	Publicity tells illegals weak points.		Exec.Power.	Youngstown does not apply.	Use Army Gen.P. Funds.

@TomAhernCPD 	Sir,		I do not live in Chicago.		But we hear of the lift in your city's crime rate.		That is difficult enough &amp; dangerous enough for your Officers to deal with, absent attention seekers, wasting your Officers valuable time.		If justified, prosecute, to send message.
@GOPChairwoman @parscale Ronna,		This is NO joke.		Every budget year UK NHS runs massive deficits.		DNC Candidates	Must submit their proposed Healthcare plans to CBO identifying:	1. Cost.	2.

@Saphina77 @NancyJKoch @POTUS May you find Peace in your heart for the life your Husband and you shared.		Take care.
@tmcterbear @SupportAmerica9 Fortunately you are wrong.		Your Son's death is terrible.

@realDonaldTrump @Maggieb1B President Trump,		What your supporters recognize.		And your detractors ignore.		You are a real American.
@Paulkingi1 Now I have you.	But I think I knew you years before.	Only good stuff.
@GOPChairwoman @vikaroo5 Democrat Party Stupidity		ObamaCare	Genuine first step to fix a decaying system.		President Trump	Tried to reframe HR51 as too costly for many.

@Paulkingi1 	Paul,	Your name rings a bell.	Thank you and have a great year.
@Jenn198523 That is truly beautiful.		Anyone without a child must want to experience that one day.		Who could think a child so innocent could grow old, to be as spiteful &amp; vindictive as key Democrats in Congress.		The blood of every sworn law officer killed by illegals is on their hands.

@RepAdamSchiff @RepJayapal Correct me if wrong.		Was that policy initiated by President Obama?		Clearly you think that a two year President has sufficient time to fix the screwups of a two Term President.		With all the unnecessary harassment of President Trump it is a wonder he gets done all he does.
@TakeshiInagi 	Thank you
@ewarren Mrs Warren,		That is unless your marriage is fake.		Save the taxpayer some money.		Pay for an exploratory committee on how to acquire honesty.		Once completed:	1. Pay bill with your illegally gained salaries over 33 years.		2. Pass results to DNC so they can learn.		No more lies.

@Susrez 	Susan,	You are right.		They will not work across the aisle.		So Americans have to ask, do they want obstructionists in Congress; or Members elected on a positive agenda who work to make it happen.		These people are paid for by taxpayers.		USA must work smart to keep up.

New Zealand.		John "Cocksy" Cocks, reality TV builder in NZ has died.		To:	John's Family &amp; Friends		This a guy who loved life.		I am no fan of churned out hum-drum reality TV shows.		His were never hum-drum.		Full of good humour, with a pinch of hard-nosed reality		Rest in Peace

@Jenn198523 Glad you are awake
@TheJordanRachel Themselves.		To the complete and utter disdain of anyone else.
@kushtiannn @Jenn198523 @KamalaHarris Very clever.		Imagine her skin would crawl, because she does not get it.		Donald Trump has had a personal revelation, maybe about 12 months into his Presidency.		He realized he can do things others can not.		Unfettered USA would become world's biggest powerhouse for 500 years.
@dcrow_baby Thanks.
@GovMikeHuckabee @MapYourSuccess @realDonaldTrump With a dead rat.		Can I suggest to you 		Go to Ancestry website.		Produce territorial overlays of surnames:	1. Cortez.	2. Cortes.		Hernan Cortes/Cortez are historically one in the same.		Ocasio Cortes is related to a homicidal maniac who slaughtered &amp; tortured Aztecs &amp; others.
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff		When is enough, enough?		Two years, of attacking President Trump.		As Chmn, House Intel Comm	You know:	1. Sec.Clinton aided/abetted Benghazi killing USA Ambassador	2. Pres.Clinton in defiance of USA policy, gave USD$7Bn to Russia to pay World Bank default.
@MapYourSuccess 	Thank you for your tweet
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 I do not know what your beef is with me.		You have me linked with mommags2579.		Maybe that is what caused you to reply like this.		Or do you like your indigenous people being hurt, by those with no claim of right to do so.		We battle for Maori equality in New Zealand.		Take care.
@dcrow_baby Thanks Deanna.		I did not want to get in hot water with you.		I am in running battle with person who is insulting me because I believe Elizabeth Warren must resign due to her fraudulent claim of Native Indian heritage on her Bar Registration.		Ironically battle is with Apache.
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 I am aware of that 		That group sets the standard in Western civilization for reasons why any person is removed from a Parliamentary or Government role.		Gaining an advantage by the use of fraud constitutes grounds for resignation or removal.
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 You are an Apache woman.		How can you defend anyone who falsely claims a blood link to any Native American?
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 The person who is incoherent is you.		Clearly you know nothing of the Law.		Her false declaration grounds for instant dismissal.		Attaining Bar status is worth millions $ over 33 years.		Discovered No Admission.		She committed fraud.		You are too stupid to see it, or a Democrat.
@magic4sure 	Thank you Rita.	I really think he did a Babe Ruth and belted it all the way to Venezuela.	On top of his game.	God Bless,	Please keep in touch.
@mommags2579 @ghostdancer2017 Yes,		You are right.		What if her filing was race quota related?		Now 33 years ago.		Off the cuff criticism our perspective stupid.		The facts are:		1. Lied on form.		2. Gained pay rates &amp; jobs she would not get.		3. Must be disbarred.		4. Must pay back taxpayer.		5. Maybe gaol.
@mommags2579 @ghostdancer2017 Agreed.		She lied.		33 years and maybe as much as USD$14 million in income, when an average person is USD$1.65 million.		"Steal a little &amp; they throw you in jail,	Steal a lot &amp; they make you a King"	(Bob Dylan)		Warren 2020, over now!		And DISBARRED.
@TPotterf 	Hi Toni,	Thank you.	Great State of the Nation.	Keep in touch please.
@schildt_b 		You have had it hard.		America, and let's face facts, most if not all of the Western world, is built off the backs of the sacrifices you, your Family, and others (my Family - Dad WW2 - 97) made for us.		Thank you for your service, and your sacrifice.		God Bless.
@dcrow_baby 	Deanna,	Which reply?	Thanks.
@dcrow_baby Deanna,	Dear,	Sent a few tweets can you tell me what this referred to please?	Thank you.
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 In your tweet you insult me:	"invent further misconduct"		Warren's fraud forces you from House of Lords.		She lied 1986.	Discovered:	No admission to Bar; lower  pay, 33 years, mostly on taxpayer funds		She hurts Native American Indians		You	Relative qual's do not give them to you
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 See my reply to your other tweet.		You seem to think it is acceptable to lie on a registration form.		You say she passed exams, do you know if she cheated?		Do you know if at that time there were concerns over wider exam cheating.		She has committed fraud.		No excuse - She is Out
@ghostdancer2017 @mommags2579 Thank you for your reply.		Understand your point 		But can not agree.		I have history with Warren.		She lied on her Registration Paper which is part of process to be admitted as Lawyer 		Given that deception what has she done illegal since?		She MUST be DISBARRED		May be charged.
@MajJohnCClark Elizabeth Warren		Major,		She has committed FRAUD.		Since then she has largely been PUBLIC SERVANT.		She should:		1. Resign candidacy.		2. Either go to jail 	Or:	3. Have to repay difference b/w public servant &amp; average wage.		She must be DISBARRED.		Trust new A-G will prosecute.
Elizabeth Warren Fraud		What a debacle.		Warren on her Registration Papers to be admitted to Legal Bar.		Claims her heritage as American Indian.		Why	To accelerate her admission by leveraging sympathy or a race quota?		This woman has gained her income for 30 years due to FRAUD.
President Trump		State of the Union Speech		President asks Congress to pass a Bill forbidding late termination of pregnancies.		Not one Democrat woman in white, nor Nancy Pelosi either stood or applauded.		That is most damning indictment of their morals.		In 2020 vote them out.
Your wife
Jared Kuschner.		State of the Union Speech.		You are a lucky man.		Ivanka Trump is not only a Mum, your husband, and very smart.		Ivanka is breathtakingly beautiful, and you make a great team.		Well done.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Speaker Pelosi.		President Trump	Smacked the DNC to history in 2020.		Fact Check	Take your time.		First though	Resign from Congress.	Then you have time to do so.
President Trump		State of Union Speech.		Finishes Democrats 2020.		Only DT competitors:	1. Ex New York Mayor.	2. Coffee empresario.		All three billionaires.		Any debate only on issues.		Each is individually very competent.		President Trump	Will win.	He knows the real issues.
@destinlola 	Yes you are right.		DT is agent of change for better.		Imagine, with his building &amp; development &amp; design skills he can transform USA infrastructure, in next 6 years.		If only Democrats in this Committee will give DT US$25Bn &amp; tell him to finish it fast.		He will.
@unclepaulyrules @Jenn198523 Maybe.		But, anyone in a position to do what he can do to help his country, and who chooses to be obstructionist is not smart.		Schumer is too dumb for words.		USA has seen it before:		Lincoln's original Proclamation was opposed by Dem's.		And 2nd iteration became 13th Amendment.
@leticia_stocks @Jenn198523 Oh you are very clever.		Picture tells a 1000 words.		In this context perfect.
@pastortammy11 @Jenn198523 Yes, they were.		And as I have pointed out repeatedly, as a member of a Family which helped to draft both the Declaration and The Constitution.		The USA is a Constitutional Republic, which votes using the principles of democracy.		Socialism is illegal as a type of USA politics.
@RiderStrong6 I'll take that under advisement.		At times she was simply not in sync with the rhythm of the room, or her party.		You think sober, hate to be cruel but I do believe she is past her "best by" date.		Time to resign.
@SecNielsen 	Keep up the good work.		You can not take water in a bucket, to fight a fire, if there is no bottom to the bucket.		The Southern Border is America's rear end, and her enemies have an open invite to kick it.		That is just not right.	Lock it up tight.		Good work.
President Trump		SOTU Speech		My Grandma was a World Champion at cards - 500.		Top hand in 500 = No Trump's		Yet again you defy odds.		Before an audience of just over 500.		Congress by you, was well and truly TRUMPED.
PRESIDENT TRUMP		Great Speech.		You could not have done better.		Let no-one doubt.		You are The President of The United States of America.
SOTU Speech		President Trump	Is braining the Congress.		Speaker Pelosi	On many points made is sitting there, incredulous at what is being said.		She is simply not up to speed, or drunk.		Schumer, Schiff, Ocasio Cortez, Sanders, Harris are not loyal to USA.		USA is FREE, they sit.
@KamalaHarris Are you a fool?		You walk across a room by putting one foot in front of the other.		President Trump	Did not create the inequality.	His administration, and his Presidency have worked hard to fix this.		You live in the past.	Argue and fail to resolve.		Under DT change is happening.
@HeatherChilders President Trump.		Truth is power.
SOTU Speech		Democrat Screw Up		Oh gosh.		DT talks about 58% of new jobs being filled by women.		&amp;		Democrat women in white, figured out it was about them, and miraculously they stood and applauded DT.		You could see a reluctant Nancy stand &amp; clap, Chuck sat like a dummy.		He is.
STATE of UNION SPEECH		PRESIDENT TRUMP	Is knocking it out of park		Forget Brady, this gets ring.		SPEAKER PELOSI	Sits like stuffed Dummy		Can't celebrate America's greatness.		SUMMARY	State of Union is strong.	US Congress is divided upon party lines &amp; Democrats are failing USA
President Trump	Democrat Legislative Ban on Military to Build Wall.		Sir,	Do you have alternative.	Then take gloves off.		1. SOTU Speech	Marines to stand by to evict &amp; arrest guest if she heckles, she is forbidden to speak.		2. Border Wall	DNC treason.	You CinC, USA is at risk.
Sorry Sade Adu,	Twitter overwrite.
To Safe Adult,		Belated Birthday Greetings		Saw you first time in Sydney at Gareth James's Entertainment Centre.		Then you were new &amp; feeling your way, but as with your career, you have used top class musicians to compliment your quite incredible style.		Have a Happy 60th year.
@sparkyNadine 	Thanks Nadine.
@therealritty23 	Thanks Richard, up late.		How low can Democrats stoop to?		Wait until guest woman heckler interrupts.		My reading	This is Constitutional duty &amp; a legal proceeding, so only person who can interrupt is Member of Congress		She heckles, must be arrested for contempt
@SavingTheWest 	Thanks Colin
@StephanieJKram1 	Thank you Stephanie.
@realDonaldTrump Knock it out of the park.		If that loud mouth activist interrupts your address it will be a nail in the coffin, of the poorest opposition party in history.		From Abraham Lincoln to your Presidency you can only call them the party of "obstructionists".		Swipe them to the bleaches

@GovMikeHuckabee Have you offered your services to President Trump with respect to a clean out team to fix both the DOJ &amp; FBI, for William Barr.		DT knows both he and USA can trust you, and you have the gravitas to do the job.		And in God you do Trust.
@mitchellvii @MaliaReeves11 In 2020,		Democrats do not understand the deep seated level of outrage by decent Americans.		Is Donald Trump perfect?		No.		But he is real, and if children can be relied upon to tell the truth then they love him.		Because they see he is one very serious big kid.		Not a sad sack.
@BoeingAirplanes Good on you promoting.		I will always trust a Boeing.		Keep it up
@TXbonniejean 	Thanks Bonnie,	I wonder if they ever strapped on a Schofield revolver?

@gatewaypundit Ruth Ginsberg.	I will not decry her public service, irrespective of her leanings.		I do wonder what she thinks of this late-term abortion legislation.		Wonder if she would curse &amp; point out it does not always work.		Just look at Chuck Schumer!
@borrin @jamersr13 Bob,	I would have.	Even more pointed.	Ran out of characters.	There is an irony there.	Clearly Nancy Pelosi has no available character.		Aw hell, we knew that already.
@AppSame @DFost14 @SandraTXAS @gatewaypundit See.		See what happens.		That's Nancy Pelosi without moisturizer.		Oh well.		She looks better than Maxine Waters.

President Trump		Senility "Bye bye Nancy"		This Democrat Congress,	It's so mean,	It's the worst, we've ever seen,		So bye bye Nancy, bye bye,	Don't forget to take Chuck,	Or he'll start to cry,		Nancy please take a walk,	Leave the halls of power,	Nancy just go, 	Now is the hour.
PRESIDENT TRUMP		Your campaign judgement in 2015-2016 was right.		BUILD THE WALL		As Commander-in-Chief		Do as George Washington &amp; General Henry Knox would do.		Force a Constitutional crisis.		ORDER the military to build.		Ignore a Judiciary which you have Executive Power over.
@Pacu133 	Your Lenin message correct.		Many young people do not know Russia was USSR or what initials stand for.		I used to deal with U Thant.		From Burma, run by China, he told me he was resigning as China vetoed sending UN troops to end coup of Father of Bashir Assad		Now look!
@OeeTran 	Thanks very much.
@cvpayne @RamsNFL Oh Charles,		You are a hard man.		SOTU today will bear you out.		Ability is one thing, focus is everything.
@PKY92941436 @SpeakerPelosi Mrs Pelosi,		That would not have fixed the issues you have stated		In fact it would have entrenched the influence of unelected, monied, lobbyists over elected politicians who in the Democrats seem to with casual disdain for voters, forget why they were voted into Office.		Retire.
@Jenn198523 @Jhwrr Go to sleep

@Jenn198523 	Really.	Did you like that message.	Gosh.
@KellyannePolls 	Mrs Conway,	You are no dressed up imitation, you are the real deal.		The State of the Union speech should be illuminating.		I can not believe either of the two main political parties could wilfully allow illegal aliens en masses to enter the USA to cause it harm.
@GovRonDeSantis 	Governor,	For the first time in quite a while I had some Florida oranges in New Zealand.		Your crops had been ruined.		They are a class act, as are Floridians.		Good luck with using your skills and fairness to help the great State of Florida thrive.		God Bless.
@CosmoMcCoy28 @Jenn198523 @HeatherChilders @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews Smarter, and true.	I have one more for you.	There is an "I" in Patriots.		Regretfully that is a pronoun Democrats can not spell.		Just imagine Chuck punted over the crossbar from 40 yard line, Nancy nagging as his rear end, not tight end, sails over the black dot.		Just a point
@HeatherChilders @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews Tom Brady,	Yet again proving an old ethos holds true.		Winners are grinners.		And:		There is nothing wrong with being a winner.		Further, it is a team game, and although he is a recognizable face.		There is NO I in team.
@TheJordanRachel Very lateral thinking of you.		Would the DNC give a refund?		Do anything?		Probably not.
@vegod_jean 	I direct messaged you.	Friend.
@howlett_delma 	Thanks Delma
President Trump,		I hope, 	Away from the rigours of dealing with so many useless backstabbing Democrats, who can not act to protect their own country.		You enjoyed kicking the butts of two reasonable golfers, who like you, and most Americans, enjoy winning.
@Maggieb1B 	Maggie,		Question	As a man if I may ask this.		Surely a vast majority of women hold nothing in higher regard than Motherhood.		If that is true, then surely the late term abortions issue must cause serious anger amongst Mother's everywhere?		Who are usually voting age.
@ewarren Mrs Warren,		The only racism I see comes from the Democrat Party.		And constant attempts by you and your Democratic fellow candidates, to demonize President Trump will give him the landslide he needs to run USA properly.		Acts by you and other DNC reps will consign DNC to history
@magnettothesea 	Thank you.		The last time I was with Stephanie, a certain rock musician by the name of Tom Petty was at her side.		Just normal people with an extraordinary amount of talent 		Is Stephanie follows you &amp; you don't know, sweetheart still have your gift.		Love you GB
@SebekTravis 	Thanks Travis.		I just saw a tweet from Adam Schiff, I had to reply to		These Democrats don't care about America.		Only themselves.		Unbelievable.		God Bless You.
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff.		Do you hate your country so much that you will do nothing to fix a problem causing the deaths of thousands of Americans every year.		You are a traitor.		You snivelling apology for a human being.		Go and see Officer Singh's 5mth old baby boy.		Or the next.
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Senator Graham,		President Trump,		May not need emergency declaration if Joint Chiefs can provide capital from appropriations.		Further, use of returned vets for wall building security can cut PTSD soldier suicides.		Imagine, DNC helping with USA soldier Health &amp; Safety.		Do it.
@magnettothesea @StevieNicks @fleetwoodmac Stephanie sure was and is still gorgeous
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams Are you so blindly biased that you can not see the good President Trump is doing.		Or is he responsible for USD$22Tn Debt USA has.

@magnettothesea @fleetwoodmac @StevieNicks Well done.
@Wakeuppeeps123 @VeldaMcConnell2 @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Crazy.	He is not the subject of the Mueller investigation and is The President.

President Trump		I have fair idea which "table is to be set" at State of the Union Speech.		Will you wear a Michael Jackson SARS mask to avoid breathing in the gross hypocrisy of Democrats.		You must feel let down, as Abraham Lincoln did about The Proclamation.		Protect &amp; Defend.
@Jenn198523 	How are you?
@RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff.		President Trump	Got you to fall for one of oldest tricks in world.		You just stated this Offence:	"Against administration of Justice"	Is very serious.		The DNC Congress now has NO reason to NOT prosecute:	1. Hillary Clinton.	2. Bill Clinton.	3. James Comey
@GovernorVA Governor,	From a practical perspective you have not shied away from calling for others to resign, for their acts.		Democrats	Call for President Trump to resign when he is doing nothing wrong.		You,	Stop being a gutless moron.	Act like a man.	Borrow tissues off Schumer.	Then quit.

@HeatherChilders 	Heather,		Two responses, I am honoured.		You can direct message me.		I really mean my compliment.		Your new more aggressive style is good, questions of steel in a velvet glove.		Whoever wins your heart I pray they realize their luck!		I am proud to be involved.
@Truthaccordng2b 	Thank you.
@JohnWickI007 	Thanks John.	I will not interrupt.	Let you get back to your kissing.
@Burn1Lynn 	Rhonda.	Help me!	Oh, you have already by replying in support.	Thank you very much.
@jerry_armel 	Sergeant.	Stand easy.	Thank you for your tweet Jerry.	Keep in touch please.
@Drs27Kn9t1 	Thank you Roydan.
@RandyShort33 	Hello Randy,	Thank you for your support.	God Bless.
@Isyel 	Thanks Chelle.	How do people harm the most vulnerable, then have the gall to try and justify it?	Makes my skin crawl.

@DenisCoghlan 	Thank you Denis
@joeblow745 	Hi,		Glad you agree.		Pierre sold himself as something other than who he truly was 		Clearly like Father like Son.		How is Canadian life absent lying politicians?
@itnaturalpix 	Thank you 	Nature is gorgeous.	The most beautiful thing on Earth.
@leighgoodison 	Thanks Emma.	I love POTUSA
@JohnWRoss7 	John Ross		Thank you.		I agree with sentiments on your site 		America is the greatest country on Earth.		It does not always get it right, nor right first time.		But, as most generous &amp; benevolent nation in history it has earned right to make mistakes it then fixes.
@mjkase53 You are welcome.
@beatraider 	Thanks Julie
@Jt428cj 	Thanks Jim
@mjkase53 	Thanks Mary Jo
@HeatherChilders 		Heather,		Thank you.		You are really showing your mettle, deeper questioning.		Enjoy, keep it up.		Back from a break you are FOX's newest secret weapon.		Gorgeous, classy, incisive.		Any man failing to answer your queries, will look weak.		If I was single?		Tks
@SpeakerPelosi Well nice to know the Party of Lincoln:		1. Supported the Emancipation Proclamation when the other Party opposed it.		2. Passed Amendment 13 when other Party abstained from support.		3. Elected first Black Member of Congress.		Oh, right.	Democrats are Other Party.	And finished.
@joeblow745 	You think Justin Trudeau is a lying, back stabbing, highly unreliable flake 		Almost as bad as his Father Pierre, who was also an absolute womaniser.
Democrat Changes Mind	Virginia Representative says had she read Bill she co-sponsored on abortion, she would have not done so.		I raised 2 issues	1. Negligence.	2. Bribery.		She's sorry for negligence.		Congress must investigate.	She co-sponsored Bill without signing off as read.
@Jenn198523 I agree.	It is disgusting.	In a country which stands for freedom of thought, speech, movement, providing you behave legally, to force anyone to be in this is an abomination.
@HeatherChilders @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews Thanks Heather,	Great segment.	Now you have involvement in weightier issues.	God Bless
@LindaJa85459236 	Hi Linda,	Thank you
@realDonaldTrump 	President TRUMP	Border Structure Name	I have looked at the design.	This name is an old one.	It is also the name given to one of the most expensive areas of real estate in California.		BORDER PALLISADE		Call it that, no more wall, the spikes on top are that name.
@johncardillo @anthonymacleod5 John,	For me raises 2 important issues which must go before Congressional Disciplinary Hearing, maybe jail.		1. Lawmaker publicly states they used no careful due diligence to co-sponsor Bill	(Negligence)		2. As no due diligence, what were they paid/promised for support 	(Bribery)
@JoeD12946835 @realDonaldTrump Thanks Joe
@JoeD12946835 @realDonaldTrump The Book?
@realDonaldTrump @RVLawson_Author And		Very bad		Feng Shui
@senatemajldr HR1	Is a political abomination.	It is a well rehearsed plan by Democrats to place Congress not as co-equal, but in the driving seat.		I would trust the Senate will vote it down in the interests of Democracy.		Founding Fathers balanced the system to avoid undue influence 		Protect
@dbongino @hernandm2 Nice to see you are copying my layout.	Keep it up Dan
@realDonaldTrump Your USA-China detente		Seriously		You and President Xie must co-author a book.		It will be a huge bestseller.		Title:	West meets East	Sub:	Art of The USA-China Deal	Cover Photo	You (right), President Xie (left)	Face each other shaking hands.		Proceeds to USA-Sino Friendship Fund
@nancy41557 	Thank you
@KatharineBD 	Thank you
@55true4u @DianeRosemond Yes.	Treason.	But covered by a document
@mitchellvii @dr__lisaann Exactly.		With 60 votes needed in the Senate, and the GOP support so weak, it is easy to.see why President Trump has battled to get things done.		Crazy,	Now McConnell making noises of supporting an anti-shutdown Bill, stealing Presidential leverage &amp; a major check on Congress.
@Margerey3 		ON TRUMP 2 GOD		Dear God,		Oh how I hate to write,		But the Dem's are dirty,		And ruin the USA, in their fight,		They lie so freely &amp; don't do much,		Pelosi whines, Schumer cries a bunch,		So help us God I am your fan,		Trump's trying hard, 		He's the USA's main man
@Lmc30807732 @SpeakerPelosi 2020 Presidential &amp; Congressional Elections.		USA People will vote for a President:		1. Who keeps his word	1.1. If he is right.	1.2. If not right tells People why.		2. Who builds strong economy off sound basics.		3. Stops countries stealing from USA.		DNC Congress &amp; Pelosi = OUT
@FiveRights 		Philip,		Just for commonsense.		What is wrong with his support of:	1. Strong safe borders.		2. Reducing the flow of drugs		3. Cutting human trafficking.		4. Opposing f/term abortions		5. Ending a 18 year Afghan presence		6. Fixing Nth Korea.		7. Fixing Deficit.
@Rise1Soar2BFree @vikaroo5 AOC is a Nutter		A chipmunk or squirrel looks after their nuts.		Then eats them.		AOC is an unpalatable nut.		In fact:		She is right at the "tippy top" of DNC nutters.		AN AOC RHYME	AOC is a nutter.	And a lunatic to boot,	Her ideas are extremist,	She's as 'nutty' as a fruit.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		EXECUTIVE POWER is vested in The PRESIDENT		Your push for the wall is in the BEST interests of the USA.		I pray GENERAL DUNSFORD can provide you with FUNDS and ARMY CORPS of ENGINEERS.		Use RETURNING VETERANS as security for builders, it MUST cut PTSD suicides.
@Jason2956 	Thanks Jason,	Democrats crazy.
@CliffShep 	Thanks Clifton.		I am not trying to be rampant on views.		But I do object to our most vulnerable, babies, being regarded by Democrats as a %
DEMOCRAT DISHONESTY	Saw: FOX "Outnumbered"		Democrat supporter false on Abortion Law in Rhode Island/New York.		Ginsberg gone, Trump appts 5th Conservative Judge, SCOTUS ends Roe v Wade.		NY, RI, etc. passed State Law to counter.		DNC	Full term abortions = small%	Great babies = %
@tw_bass4trump 	I knew a Dick Bass once upon a time (Snowbird).		We used to go climbing together with Frank Wells.		Are you related to Dick?
Genetically Edited Babies	Chinese Doctor &amp; USA links		Why?	What went wrong?		You are being applauded for your success in China, but what about the catastrophic historic failures in the USA?		1. Occasio Cortes	2. Adam Schiff.		And why, why did you refuse to fix up Andrew Cuomo?
@RobertJohnDavi 	How are you Johnson, and Johnson.		There an ever diminishing number of actors, actresses, singers and performers no longer with us.		Glad you are Robert.		Keep safe and keep having an opinion.
@JimPolk @GOPLeader @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @senatemajldr Absolutely!
@ClandestineRos1 @CannellRichard Hey,	That is an awful empty feeling to have to live with.		Keep strong, if not just for yourself, but to honour and pay tribute to the person who has gone.		Does time heal every wound?	Nah it's rubbish.		If you've truly loved it will be there for life, it just evolves.		God Bless
@MSNBC DAMN	More Mueller Excuses 		Someone leaked something about someone to somebody for no particular reason.		Oh, whoa's me.		Mr Mueller,		Phone Cryin' Chuck (no leaks).		Ask him for some tissues!		And when you have wiped your nose and dried your eyes.		Grow up!
@RepAdamSchiff Rep Adam Schiff		Californian Joshua Tree damage.	Appalling, inexcusable.		Are you trying to blame President Trump for this.		Democrats share the blame.		Probably drug crackheads or illegals did damage.		How do USA youth learn values when your Democrats will not secure the border?
Sims Book - Trump.		"He was most self-assured person I have ever met".		What's wrong with that!		Do American voters want a President who is:	1. Competent.	2. Confident.	3. A deal maker.	4. At heart no showoff.	5. Genuine.	6. Tough.	7. Proud to be American	8. A winner		You betcha!
@JohnBrennan 	President Trump will never place the USA, her People, his Family, or himself in silly danger, you're scaremonger.		Under morons like you USA military has so degraded in strength there are nuclear missiles which could net get lost, let alone to war.		Stop whining.
@tedcruz 	Senator Cruz,	Congratulations on you being more outspoken.	Call it the way it is.	It is an abomination.		You have 2 counties named after interesting relatives of mine (Knox &amp; Polk), one day with you more speaking your mind we can Cruz into one named after you		God Bless
@charliekirk11 Charlie,		You like the way I format.		I should have charged a fee.		If you want to sell your message then spaced is way.
@realDonaldTrump Take wall into Rio Grande.		Go back to original deeds my ancestor President James Knox Polk (11) who got them from Sam Houston used to annex Texas into Union.		Only way Emergency Power invoked, otherwise opponents say "feet on soil" exemption = EP pointless.		Same for every part.
@Jenn198523	As I love you
@AraeEnlightened 	I believe she should be charged, not for what she has done that we all know of but for that we can not see.		Hillary is like an iceberg 90% unseen.
@senatemajldr Senator McConnell	HR1	This is something I have railed against in limited form.	This is also an attempt to diminish the role of President to titular, as with the British Monarchy.	If HR1 were to.pass socialism will follow and the American dream will be over		Protect America please
@jpyoung27 	Joy,	Thank you.	Annie get your gun.		Tell me	Have you ever fired a Hawken, with black powder?
@Jenn198523 	Love you baby
President TRUMP		Schiff &amp; Schumer went down the road,	To fetch a pail of water,	Nancy nagged, said come on back boys,	Do you really think you oughta?		She said to Chuck "go out back",	And use that big, big pump,	He cried "Oh Nancy don't nag me please,	That pump is owned by Trump.
@RoscoeBDavis1 @AraeEnlightened Do not get too carried away.		Hillary did not lie.		She simply did not disclose the full truth.		To us that is bullshit.	But by being partially true she covers her butt.		You need to find the official who gave her that feeder info?
@JuliaHB1 @starlowell Well at least they are not the New Scotland Yard.		Their Inspectors investigated a break-in to the main ablution block.		To find dastardly thieves had stolen all the toilet paper.		The Commissioner stated:	"They have nothing to go on"
@RadioMattM1 @Jenn198523 To a degree.	Democrats trying to put halter on President.		Determined to kick to touch fundamental principle of the Constitution that Executive Power vested in Office of President.		They seek to make titular role like Queen.		In USA President is voted in by country as Trail Boss.
@Jenn198523 	I am here sweetheart.	No you did nothing wrong.	I had to see my Aunt who lost her only remaining sister, and best friend, last year.	It was not a chore, they raised me from 4.5 to 7, so I am what I am, an what I am, am what I am, largely due to them.	And I love you.x
@MazurikL @jamersr13 @POTUS Honestly,	Was Paul Ryan that touchy-feely?	I never knew.	I thought the guy was OK!	I may have to stand corrected.		Because I back DT all day!!!!!

EMERGENCY POWERS		Congress Fails To Act		Democrats can not win.		EP Declaration will not have DACA or TPS		So will show true heart of Democratic Leadership.		Nancy/Chuck	Border barriers will go into rivers to avoid feet-on-soil exemption		2020	DNC will be Party which can't act
PRESIDENT TRUMP		ALERT		UNCONSTITUTIONAL Action		Democrats in Congress	Considering legislative ban on Shutdowns		Presume would need total of 2/3rds to pass independent if your signature.		Removes investing Executive Power in President which is contrary to Articles.
PRESIDENT TRUMP		URGENT		DO NOT GET CAUGHT IN CIRCULAR ARGUMENT		ILLEGALS	Feet on USA soil = asylum.		WALL/Barrier	Must be out to furthest point	Including built in Rio Grande		NOT DONE		DNC TRAP	Argue illegals feet on USA soil, Constitutional right.		Em.Pwr. then can not stand.
@HappenShitDoes @SnakeTyann @realDonaldTrump @60Minutes ILLEGALS	CA	Unsure, if so high, alarming.	If so Texas not example of overall USA number.		USA	Too kind.	Illegals making policy.		Congress 	1. Fiddling while USA burns.	2. Abdicating responsibility.		USA Future Planning 	Health/Education/Govt.Svs	How?	If real numbers unknown.	Dumb
@realDonaldTrump @60Minutes Sir,	VOTER FRAUD	Texas	50,000 of 90,000 total = USA  up to 1 million.		WALL	You've built.	Bailey Bridge	(Army.Corp.Engineers)	Footing to water's edge		Build to limit of Texas land.	See Houston &amp; Polk papers on actual extent, build to it.		IMMIGRATION	Feet on USA soil must alter.
President Trump		COST: Illegal Immigration		Overview	You are too conservative	My illegals number is less		Mine	Illegals = 15 m	USA Pop = 330 m	USA GDP = $23 TN	Illegals lower value = 35%		Calculation	((15/330) = 0.45 X $23Tn	= $1.045Tn x 35%		Result (Year)	Minimum cost = $366 Bn
@RepSwalwell How can you honestly draw that comparison?		Are you aware of how many families on the border in a number of states, who have suffered murder and rape at the hands of illegals right after their illegal entry?		Do you think you sanctimonious prick you could have respect for them?

@charliekirk11 You are wrong.		Both Communism &amp; Socialism love Rich &amp; despise poor.		Providing rich are inside their fold.		Classic example:	Communism:	Cuba, Castro = US$1.6Bn	Socialism	USSR = Politburo, dachas.		Bottom line	Communism &amp; Socialism are Capitalism.	But for an elite few only.
@JimPolk 	Jim,	Trust you to pick up on that story.	In this time, that is a story from a time hundreds of years ago.	When all a young fella had was open frankness &amp; luck
@JohnBrennan Brennan,	You insult President Trump and all Americans on baseless, splutterings of a man whose time is past.		You are a loathsome person.		In the past you &amp; I would have gone into gunfighters alley &amp; you know the result of a case of slow.		Leave Donald Trump alone.		Your through.
@chuckwoolery @JamesAndrew1989 Chuck,	I pose this to you.		Dems mad at Trump, why?		Think on this:	1. Pelosi acts like dilettante.	2. Dems disrespect Trump.	3. Pelosi tries tell President what to do.	4. Hillary was to be 45th.		Pelosi anger:	Clinton President, Pelosi calls shots.		Trump stole her power play.
@dennisrodman Mr Rodman,	You are a bit of an unsung hero.	Anything you can do in the furtherance of peace is gratefully appreciated.	Well done.

@Robbin_Young @rpmmasaya @KamalaHarris Kamala Harris &amp; Wee Willie Brown		Oh sorry Willie.		Not so wee.		Sorry Robbin Young,		I hear Kamala will get back to you.		Apparently she has to sleep on it.		Whoever's "it" that might be.
@thehill Kamala Harris Foreign Policy 		Given most World Leaders are men and older, is foreign policy literally going to get on top of Kamala Harris, if she became President in 2032?		Given her penchant for men 30 years older and married.		Will she sleep on her decision &amp; surmount issues?
@tedlieu @CorinneMCH I do not like you.		But,		Well said and appropriate.

@SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi,		At 78, you had chance by 2020, to side with probably the greatest President the USA has seen, alongside:	George Washington	Abraham Lincoln	Franklin Roosevelt		Instead you went negative.		You should have cared about the USA.		Help your Country, side him on border.

@SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi		Everyday you use leverage.		You know NATO is USA &amp; UK		Without USA, Russia would cough and almost all Europe would crumble.		Sometimes you need to let related parties know:	Do not take us for granted.		Speaker Pelosi	You have 21 days.		Please focus on the USA.

@Bekjjj @Jenn198523 @realDonaldTrump If Barr is honest then what happened with Stone must stop.		Mueller must be done &amp; run on or before Primaries start.		If I was Donald I would hire two very good people who cracked Swiss Banking Secrecy, to do a global look for money paid to Mueller.		If any?
@johncardillo @AylaForTrump Non-Prosecution Clinton's 		Sir,		You ex:NYPD.		Do we wait for William Barr?		Surely law enforcement &amp; military can see a disgrace, not Rule of Law?

@tarheel_texas @realDonaldTrump Lee,	With respect may I suggest you read The Constitution as like most you have not.		That text was written fresh from war, heading into a British rematch.		Founding Fathers were very careful, Executive Power is vested in The President.		SCOTUS sworn under same Oath will confirm.
@peterboykin @jamersr13 @realDonaldTrump Peter,		That is a very judicious use of an old Rolling Stones anthem.		Just watching Dire Straits on YouTube, typing this:		Private Investigations	Telegraph Road		We need both into Clinton's and their donor's influences over DNC, DOJ, FBI, CIA, the current House and Senate.
@SpeakerPelosi What load of rubbish.		You have been in the game long enough to know that at this level there are always the ones who think they:	1. Have more authority.	2. Know better than superior	3. Have unrewarded eagerness.	4. Can get away with anything.		You have been in this 40 years.
@CBSNews USA Sthn Border Tunnels		President Trump	Construction design expert is aware of this and wants to redo areas where needed.		Refer to Disputed Territories Settlements Wall, which has no significant incursions.		This is design/build matter for experts.		President Trump built before
@SenGillibrand Senator Gillibrand		Pack up your campaign bus and head home.		Donald Trump has shown the American People how a President is truly open and honest.		You have shown with other Democrats (not Joe) that you are dishonest.		You should protect your Senate seat, because this is a no go.
@AnnCoulter President George H.W. Bush	criticized by Coulter:		You disgraceful impolite tart		How dare you think you have any right to criticize a man who laid his life on the line in WW2 so that morons like you may be free to speak.		If you wish to criticize, have the guts to run for Office

@realDonaldTrump You are right!
@RichardVeii @realDonaldTrump Richard,	Can understand your concern, but glad your loyalty shone through.		While I do like your view on a number of issues, please do realize President Trump is a long way from defeat.		If DNC members do not act:	1. USA People will see it.	2. SCOTUS will not thwart his Em.Powers
@KamalaHarris Kamala Harris		If you knew Donald Trump you would know he has deep principles.		He took an Oath as President &amp; will not break Oath.		DT is sick of seeing death, be it Police, journalist, enough.		Border will be shut.		You would agree if you love USA.		But you love only yourself.
@DanielaQCrew Yes,	How do you do that at full term.	Andrew Cuomo could not claim it a conscience matter.	He is a baby killer.	No other way to say it.
@DanielaQCrew 	Daniela,	Thank you.		Alabama Supreme Court	Surely decision should lead Roman Catholic Church to take matter to USA Supreme Court, to get ruling overturning recent decision of New York City.		USA Supreme Court	Would not overturn Alabama so must invalidate New York
@brandongroeny @SteveZmann Brandon,		Very well said.		Better than mine.		How can there be a dispute on protecting your country?
@Education4Libs @SteveZmann Exactly.		You one of few seeing fact.		Laughable but pathetic:	1. This is to protect USA.	2. Pro-DNC media insults.	3. Schumer crows &amp; insults.		Only one with sense:	Nancy Pelosi 		She stayed silent even when Chuck invited.		Why?		She saw Trump trap	Look beaten, then win.
USA Security	Needs to be fixed now.		The shining City on the Hill of the past is in the past.		USA in deep debt &amp; fixing drain caused by flow of drugs, crime, health problems is critical.		Coulter has opinion to sell books, no guts to run for public office.		False prophet.
Emergency Powers	Twitter overwrite	Sorry
USA Media &amp; Anne Coulter	Grow the hell up.		If you all stepped back from your egos and insults.		You would see Donald Trump put Dem's into a Constitutional corner.		Talks fix now a 40yr issue or he uses Energy.Pwr and DNC has no legal argument.		Fair weather friends are not good.
@JimPolk I agree.		Senator Schumer	No re-election 2020, so feels invulnerable.		Plus he states worth only $900,000 (he has much more squirreled away offshore).		He should recall old sayings about reaping what you sow.		Donald signing CR wipes out DNC challenge to Em.Pwr use.
President Trump vs Democrats		Media	On CR &amp; future are nuts.		McConnell did not put both Bills on Floor to show winner		CR	Gives Dems time to agree to Border Security experts plan 		Dems try to be experts, talks fail, Dems lose DACA &amp; TPS.		Emergency Power Use	DNC can not oppose.
@Jenn198523 @UsLiberate GOP voted for Federal Pay		You are right.	Democrats did not.
Senator Schumer	You get CR &amp; chance to fix border security.		But	First chance you launch a visceral verbal attack on a POTUS trying to do his job.		DON'T	Fix border security thinking you can kick it down road		Bad mistake, you will have NO Court argument against Emergency Powers
@HeatherChilders @POTUS @realDonaldTrump President TRUMP	Sign Continuing Resolution you must get something.		Bottom line	Put onus onto Democrats.		Draft an MOA	Signed by Schumer &amp; Pelosi that after 26 days of talks if unresolved you retain right to use Emergency Powers to build wall without challenge.		Tell America.
@MrsLwashere 	Thank you
@RepAdamSchiff 		Representative Schiff.		Election to Congress &amp; appointment as Chair House Intell.Comm. are applauded.		Ending Shutdown	To get a CR and start talks:		Q	Will you sign MOA:		1. P/pay wall.		2. Day 46 if talks fail, POTUS uses Em.Powers no demur
@HeatherChilders Heather,	What do you mean $25 million?
@realDonaldTrump Read my tweet		Solving Shutdown Stalemate		One above this.		Do action publicly.		Then public can see if DNC is not telling truth.		With Mueller clearance.		2020 Trump Landslide.		Against All Odds.
President Trump		Solving Shutdown Stalemate		WH Counsel prepares MOA	for	DNC Members of Congress		REQUIRED	All DNC Members of Congress to sign.		TERMS		1. Part payment on wall made.		2. If talks fail on Day 46:	POTUS may invoke Emergency Powers on wall without a legal challenge.
Rep. Slotkin (Dem) - FOX	Q	What needed?	A	1-2 Punch	1. Open Government.	2. Then talk.		DNC dishonors Promises.		Trump top line developer wants wall in part only.		WAY FORWARD	CONGRESS	DNC Mbrs sign MOA	1. D/payment on wall	2. POTUS can use Emergency Power if talks fail, no legal
To The Global Medical Community		I am seeing an increasing number of people from mid-50's upwards succumb to &amp; pass away from pneumonia.		I want the short version from Experts (not people who think they are) on progress in curing this life threatening condition striking so many.
@HouseCracka @SteveZmann The Lord Giveth.		And the Lord		Taketh away.		Really Jesse Jackson, 		That must have been creative.		Kamala Harris does not even look good, and on the taxpayers dime is running to fat.
USA 	Commander US Coastguard		He can not fathom why his people unpaid.		DEMOCRATS	Time is up.		You can whine all you like.	Your blind vitriol is hurting Americans, so cut excuses.		PRESIDENT TRUMP	Get $ from Gen.Dunsford.	Security on wall build gives ret. vets job cuts suicides
@Jenn198523 	Where are you?
President Trump 		No Joke		To get away from this drama for a moment.		Go to YouTube Music		Play:		Gary Moore	Still Got The Blues For You	(52 million views)		So good.	Audience silent right to end.		(See: James Dunsford)		Diff:	You &amp; DNC	DNC: No compassion	DJT: You have heart
@Jenn198523 	Are you there?
@AndreaSmithCLT @BofA_News @AnneFinucane @CathyBessant @sheribronstein @CKatziff So long as the women are not like Nagging Nancy Pelosi.
Rupert Murdoch - Fox Live		Hope your health is great.		Just watching	Heather Childers, Jillian Melee, Carly Shimkus, Shannon Bream, Ainsley &amp; others.		As a man you do not tire of seeing these ladies who are:	Smart, well presented, well spoken, gorgeous, positive.		Fox is a winner
@GKeile @Scott3170 Mitt Romney,	You get 6 years in the Senate because at the peak of his popularity President Trump turns up and asks a very Conservative State to back you.		What do you do, in the first important Senate Vote you vote against him.		You are a 5th Columnist.	I would also you.		Gutless
@JoeD12946835 Absolutely, you have the right
@CliffordBauman Thanks Cliff, take care.
President Trump - MAGA Hats		To all media &amp; people criticizing MAGA Hats.		President Donald Trump 		1. Proven marketing genius.		2. Ran for GOP Party.		Both MAGA hat &amp; GOP use color RED		Taught at school colours of spectrum 	= R-O-Y-G-B-I-V		Red has highest possible visibility.
@DFBHarvard If you want to see what an unplanned pregnancy and poor parental guidance looks like ...it looks like		Chuck Schumer		Why wasn't he aborted?		I believe this NY Law is in breach of UN Human Rights Declaration on Rights of a Child.		It is murder.
@Patrici15767099 @kateMAGA3 How insane is that?
@OmarHamada Sir,	Did not the United Nations under The Rights of a Child define when a foetus was classed as being human?		As a full charter member since 1945 that would render that NY Legislation in breach of a UN Charter mandate, and invalid.		Needs to go to SCOTUS
@TheJordanRachel Sweetheart we've known that for years.		Darn,	Now head in the sand Mitt,	Knows his game is up.		In his case do you know what stands between his faith and stupidity?		One 'm' too many
@FiveRights 	I have see your face before.	Related to George?	Used to know him when he was with Stephen Bechtel.		Yes you are right.		NP is vindictively strategic he is productively strategic.		Sooner or later the former runs out of friends.
@MatthewSWagner 	Thanks Matthew
@marcorubio @AlanSte75898462 Senator Rubio.	If it does not rain it pours.	Does USA have carrier capacity offshore to move in if he is foolish enough to tamper with the diplomatic sovereignty of USA Embassy?
@PressSec Regretfully,	Speaker Pelosi	Charles Schumer	Dick Durbin	Elijah Cummins	&amp; Others can not be trusted.		Gen.James.Dunsford.	Access $25-30Bn from appropriated discretionary funds.		Confirm then reopen.		Masterstroke would be reimburse contractors out of spare &amp; pay any bridging costs
@CoryBooker Senator Booker,		Wilbur Ross said something which was both heartless &amp; stupid.		You know full well that he is a numbers wonk, and President Trump does care.		If you look for credibility into 2020, do not make cheap shots.		People remember.		They would if you helped fix shutdown.
@MatthewSWagner @RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff.		On this occasion do not be a smartass.		Answer the question please:		Do you love the USA?		You swore an Oath to uphold and defend the Constitution.		USA Law:	Life, Liberty, &amp; Pursuit of Happiness.		How is any Democrat not in breach of their Oath.
@MatthewSWagner @RepAdamSchiff Representative Schiff		You are maybe lucky in that you are relatively new to Congress.		So criticism of you not as well deserved.		But, your aged leaders have lied before to the American People.		President Trump has said enough.		Fix crime, drugs, DEBT.		Question	Do you love USA?
@ChuckCallesto Anyone who calls for that sort of action, given the sheer number of morons around these days, should be investigated put on trial and taught the rule of law with a 30 year jail sentence.	Disgraceful.
@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump,		Time for you to ask of:	Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General James Dunsford:		Please in interests of National Security to loan project from  available appropriated Discretionary budget US$25-30Bn to finish project fully.		Repaid from seizures.
@realDonaldTrump 	Sir,	Joint Chiefs, now.	Democrats have proven they do not have an interest in the people of the United States of America.	You must now step up to the plate &amp; bat them out of the park.	Ask for whole budget.	Simultaneous go on attack to find prior appropriations.
Olivia Holt,		Your SuperYacht Look		You are sensational, one of the best looking young woman anywhere.		The outfit is stunning.		Whatever you do young lady, do not cheapen yourself.		The best men will be patient the best will rise to the top.		And only the best must do		Good luck

President Trump		With the greatest of respect.		Your steadfastness over this issue has the left wing side of journalism so confused, they are akin to:	"putting an Irishman in a round room and telling him to go and stand in a corner"
President Trump	Government Shutdown	Democrats Not To Be Trusted		Senator Warner (Dem)	1. Open Government.	Then	2. We negotiate.		If we can't resolve, then shame on us.		President Trump says 	NO	Fix.	No cans down road		Me	Everyone has excuse for failure, DT only reason for success
@LaJukilop 	You have great hands.	Thank you.
@Chi2SoCal2LV Thanks BLL,	G m, to you.
President Trump	Mike Pompeo		Saw him address America's conference on Venezuela.		Much better suited to global stage in role, than Tillerson.		No disrespect to ability of Condoleeza, he first since Henry B., I thought great		He is fixing Kerry/Clinton bowing &amp; scraping		USA tall
Senator Joe Manchin		You are a good man, but you just do not get it!		President Trump is one of the greatest developers of property in world history.		His offer included expert input on costs from Border staff.		He wants Govt open.		But your Senior Democrats can not be trusted.
@MERB94851476 	Merb,	I did not notice the overwrite	Sorry, thanks for it all as said
@therealritty23 	Richard,	Absolutely.	Problem is most Democrats have not been in business so just do not have maturity to understand money does not grow on trees.		I suppose they think taxing the "tippy-toppy" will do it.		Yeah right!

Senator Rick Scott.		I vastly underestimated you.		Clearly Donald's judgement vindicated again.		You're making right type of commonsense at right time.		GDP=$23Tn illegals=$780Bn	If gone	Leaves $400Bn to cut deficit		Southern Border gives this saving with wall, staff &amp; technology
President Trump,		4. Was unprintable.		Sorry
@realDonaldTrump 		President Trump		Remind Congress Speaker Pelosi won election due to abstention to cut numbers?		Mr President,		She:	1. Refused an unseen offer.	2. Lied to you &amp; Congress on Security.	3. Falsely accused you of leaking her travel.	5. Banned timely SOTU.		Enough
@knobcreek4ever 	Thanks Cindy
Democrats Don't Get It		President Trump &amp; GOP Senate are NOT going to open Government until his Border package agreed to.		Young Democrats coming with bi-cameral talks don't get it.		Your Democrats leaders in past did not keep their word.		NOT again.		Trump's way is Experts way.
@Serremmy @MzVTrumplican They can't do that.	It is against the Constitution.	Requires Amendment.	No way they can get that.
@MickGollihue Makes her claim of Secret Service not being able to provide secure environment in Washington, D.C. pathetic.		Clearly she has had too many juniper fruit.		Worse you can only dilute gin with so much tonic, but Donald is too much tonic for her, and she knows it.
@geboller 	George,	Thanks for your tweet.	Nice to hear from someone who has good taste
@KellyannePolls 		URGENT		I tweeted Donald	He must attack.		Impeach Speaker Pelosi		Sir,	You have best Constitutional lawyers.		Charge	Misleading President &amp; Congress		Speaker	Wrote claiming security critical reason for delaying State of Union speech		She lied		Pelosi must resign
Monica Crowley		Just saw you on Hannity.		Have not seen you anywhere since the McLaughlin Group.		You are still an outstanding looking woman, and you always make great common sense.		Take care.	God Bless.
President TRUMP		Deporting illegals from USA		Please speak with	Malaysian Prime Minister	Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamed	while he is still alive.		Dr Mahathir deported 890,000 Indonesians 1997-1998, Muslim ctry - Muslim		He was not popular doing it but did, he is expert at it.		Good luck
President Trump		Impeaching Speaker Pelosi		Sir,	You have access to the best Constitutional lawyers.		Charge	Misleading President &amp; Congress		Speaker Pelosi,	When writing to you claimed Security was critical issue in delaying State of Union speech.		She lied.		Pelosi must resign.
President TRUMP		Key difference with Dem's		Military	US Supreme Court upholds Trump Administration's ban on LGBTQ.	Why	Because military asked for it		Border	Trump asks funds for wall	US Border Guards	Want wall	DNC	NO wall		Difference	Trump	Relies on experts	Democrats	Are experts
President Erdogan of Turkey	In the spirit of Kamal Atatürk		Please be merciful in respect to the Kurdish People.		Sir,	I am a New Zealander whose Grandfather's fought at Gallipoli against brave Turks.		At ANZAC Cove	We enjoy Turkish generosity.		Please,	Be merciful, let them be.
@BretBaier @jamersr13 @AmyBaier1 Your a big powerful man.		But that must show you that in a moment, life can end.		It gives you pause.		Although you are a considerate TV Host think on all US personnel in war zones who live with life &amp; the other every day.		Puts Pelosi pettiness in perspective.		God Bless family.
President TRUMP		Democrats say:		1. Open Government		2. Then negotiate.		TODAY	Senator Warner on Cavuto CONFIRMED your big FEAR		He said do 	1) above	Then	2) and if Congress can not get this done, shame on us.		You must tell USA failure to do this on Southern Border NOT an option
@Jt428cj 	Thanks Jim
President Trump.		Now shackles are off, where 		1. Your Immigration Proposal has been rejected by Democrats.		2. State of the Union Speech gone from Congress.		You need to realize Nagging Nancy hates your guts.		See Joint Chiefs for $25Bn		Once confirmed available end shutdown.
@JoeD12946835 Thanks Joe.	Thought you were.	Clearly Donald made a bad choice with Cohen, now a proven liar.	Yet Democrats are so set on having a go at Donald, they rely upon a convicted liar for a witness, what a joke..
@JesusUreno2 	Thanks Jesus.
President Trump - Cohen		Cohen a liar alleges threats.		Now like Covington media is claiming President Trump &amp; Rudi Guiliani have threatened Cohen.		NO threats have been made		Media should focus on Cohen's father-in-law.		Or is that too embarrassing?		Donald Trump gave you tip.
@GOPLeader 	Rep. McCarthy		State Of Union Speech		I believe President must give Speech from Oval Office.		Reasons 	1. Identifiable location.		2. Where he waited for Pelosi over Xmas.		3. Shows Democrats responsible for shutdown		4. Furloughed workers can see no wasting money.
President Trump		State Of The Union Speech		Sir,	I believe you must give Speech from The OVAL OFFICE.		My reasons:	1. Identifiable location.		2. You were there over Xmas		3. Continuation of you waiting for Pelosi to front up		4. Furloughed staff will see you not wasting money.
@JoeD12946835 Whose first name?
President Trump	Cohen - Davis - Democrats		Can Common Sense rule?		Oversight Committee to hear from Cohen against Trump.		2 Bars exist here:	1. Cohen convicted of lying.	But far more serious:	2. Lying on such scale Cohen sent to jail		He can never be believed on any subject again
@KayaJones NY - Gov.Cuomo - Abortions	This new law is murder.	Praying will not solve this.		The US.Supreme Court has inherent jurisdiction to review any USA Laws.		SCOTUS	Must urgently review Law on basis it had been determined previously when babies in womb are to be classed as a person
President Trump - Rep. E. Cummings 	Enquiry into:	White House Security Clearances 		AMERICAN WORKERS	need be very concerned		This not Russian collusion enquiry		But to deny Donald access to trusted team who have led to stock mkt rises, low U/E, wages up.		This will hurt 401K's.
@Independent 	The EU exit by UK &amp; Nthn. Ireland. is a real mess.		EU locked UK into deal with good economies, then over time EU Crtl Bank gave Greece debt it could not pay, &amp; France, Spain, Italy, really failed badly in GFC &amp; still do.		EU does not want UK to go, UK No 2 in EU.
@Jali_Cat 	Well said.
President Trump		Resolving Shutdown		Executive Power vested in USA President.		Executive Order	Senate Vote is conscience vote private, vote count but no-one identified.		Executive Order	House Vote is conscience vote as with Senate.		Allows Members in both Houses to vote freely.
Sen.Sherrod.Brown v Trump		Just saw you on MSNBC		You stated in Congress for 2 decades.		So you came at end of Clinton, through Obama, and to date DNC has shutdown Govt 20x.		Trump will NOT open Govt. as DNC can NOT keep word on negotiating.		DNC has misused appropriated funds.
@DrRizwanAhmed1 They are brave.		I can not get Erdogan.		If Kamal Atatürk was still alive this would not happen.		President Erdogan in the interests of regional stability needs to leave them alone, establish a territory, then over time trade &amp; prosperity will follow, I have been to those regions
@GunsMimi Ma'am,	If you knew a little more of what you speak, you would make sense.		Conspiracy theorists, I have no interest in.		Further you have no business telling people how to think.		Due to my family I have sat with World Leaders for 40 yrs.		You have no idea of how the world works.
@GunsMimi @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sweetheart,	Nice of you to think I am naive.		I started dealing with U Thant, UN SecGen, as a teenager, which is why Syria concerns me, as does China, not Russia.		Sure, President Trump has an agenda, which to fix the domestic economic of USA.		Ma'am,	Do not underestimate people.
@GunsMimi Ted Kennedy was a Democrat
@ChuckGrassley Senator Grassley.		Americans could not ask for wiser Chair.		In past had lot to do with these companies at Board &amp; Ownership level.		ONE ISSUE	R &amp; D biggest corporate cost	Take from P&amp;L's, treat as separate &amp; claimable.		Claims to be monitored		Fix this R&amp;D continues prices drop.
@Pink_About_it Full Term Abortions.		That is crazy.		That is murder.
@RepAdamSchiff Rep. Schiff.	The difference between you &amp; Donald Trump, on this.		He is President, and listens to Joint Chiefs who clearly asked this issue be fixed.		You are a classic example of left leaning politicians who think you know more than those in Command.		Otherwise No SCOTUS Ruling.
President Trump		Democrats are now blaming you for furloughed workers missing a second pay check.		Democrats forget:	Nancy Pelosi's air junket to Afghanistan for 7 days left those furloughed workers without pay.		That is the real truth.		Trust no-one.
@thehill Sen. McConnell		Democrats are now wedged into the corner.		Keep the pressure on.		USA security, and increasing costs of living, are all tied to this.		Successfully resolved this will take at least USD$700Bn out of the deficit, and put USA on path to sustainably reducing USA Debt.
@DrShayPhD @Chickasee Kamala Harris		Do you mean Kamala Harris had an affair with a married man?		So could we see a secret interview where Harris tells how as a 	"woman in power she gets to grab men in private places, and they just let her".		Now where have I heard that before?		What a hypocrite.
@GunsMimi Mimi,	To be blunt I see list being:	2017-2020: President Trump	2021-2024: President Trump	2025-2028: Ivanka or Haley	2029-2032: Radcliffe.		Sorry,	No Democrats on the list.		Last 2 years &amp; next 2 years, sours DNC voter for next 3 cycles		DNC female push 2020 to beat Ivanka as 1st
President Trump		You are a genius.		In conjunction with Senator McConnell, you have backed the Democratic Party into a corner.		They must vote to support in the Senate, then in House or be exposed as fraudsters.		Carry on.		The Art of The Deal.
President Trump		MEDIA STANDARDS		I have one metric to judge if media have overstepped.		2 Simple questions:	Would Walter Cronkite have ever been sucked into this Covington matter?		If via bad reporting he was, what would he do?		A:	1. Highly unlikely.	2. Apologize then resign.
@realDonaldTrump 	Media Bias		You could do an Arthur Anderson on offending Media, given Amendment.		Media job is to report news.		When media starts making up the news, they fabricate.		Given negative cause &amp; effect can be proven beyond doubt, no different to Arthur Anderson.
@RepAdamSchiff 		Can you imagine how angry American voters are with the constant attacks on POTUS.		You can't believe Democrats will win in 2020.		All metrics Americans really value are great, jobs, wages, gas, safety.		Only move Democrats have left is to sabotage USA economy.
@RepAdamSchiff You are Head of House Intelligence Committee.		You criticize President for use of Twitter yet you do.		Donald Trump put business into bankruptcy protection 6x repaying all fees, fines &amp; interest		That is why he knows levers.		What	Russian allegations don't work, so next fake news
@Arizona_momma 	Thanks for your tweet 		Arizona is neither sanctuary State nor has sanctuary cities.		What happens now with the resurgence of Democrats in your State?
@auntiegigirocks 	Thanks Julie
Fox &amp; Friends	Covington School Fallout	Solution		George W. Bush after Enron/Ken Lay scandal put Arthur Anderson out of biz.		No1 World Accounting Firm		Media	Time has come to weigh up putting the prime television &amp; media companies who led this false story out of business.		Tough.
@Jenn198523 Then DM me please 	I love you
@kelseyjharkness 	You are seriously good &amp; seriously gorgeous 		Donald Trump	Q 	No-one is asking:	This has been ongoing for 2 years &amp; will clearly go to 2020.		When President Trump wins re-election, is USA to be subjected to 4 more years of vitriol?		DNC knows 2024 Ivanka wins.
@Jenn198523 	See you are still awake.	Miss you.
@Jim_Jordan 	Really like the cut of your jib.		Do not know if you aspire to the highest Office, but your District, State, and Congress will all be grateful for your service.		Back this President with all you have, he will not let you down, and is a "man to ride the river with".
@KellyannePolls 	You are a bonafide champion.		You are maligned by Press &amp; you never back down.		Had a friend pass away Oct. 3, 2017, who wrote a song about that attitude.		Give Donald my kind regards it is a while since Maxim's des Mers, but I will never forget his courtesy.		GB
@Alyssa_Milano You are seriously divisive 		How if you love your country could you have such hate.		There are children out there wearing those hats because they mean Donald Trump.		To children he's the Father Christmas who turns up &amp; gives them free helicopter rides.		Get some common decency.
@GunsMimi 	Very clever
@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson Speech Tip	The Union is strong.	The People work hard &amp; are willing.	Regretfully, key Lawmakers are weak, and unwilling to let America embark upon a future of less crime, better healthy outcomes &amp; a brighter future for the USA.		With your help, I will not let that happen.		GB USA.
@lorie_tuttle Thanks Lori.	Shame he was a raconteur like Ernst Hemingway.		Take care please.
@realDonaldTrump 	Tap the Joint Chiefs.		By my reckoning they must have over USD$87bn spare discretionary funds, that were appropriated.		Tap them for USD$25bn, lge part in payroll to build wall and security.		Troops home need service, may reduce suicides.		Gen. Knox would do it.
@lorie_tuttle 	Thanks Lorie,	That was a beauty.	You can hear the honesty.	Not many speakers do that.	Take care		Question	Are you related to the Tuttle who is a famous Western Writer?		If you are, I loved his books.
@realDonaldTrump Just saw your speech on YouTube.		Must go down as one of the finest ever given.		You covered some ground.		On a day remembering Dr Martin Luther King Junior, he would have clapped, taken your hand and stood with you.		Use It.Chiefs, get it done.		Liberty and Freedom have a price.
@NancySinatra @washingtonpost Brought up your Dad on YouTube the other day singing "Old Man River".		In his white suit.		What a performance.		Had VCR recorded years ago glad he is on YouTube for it.		And he is enjoying learning the song as he sings.		Be always proud Ms Sinatra.		He gave you the right to be.
@GovMikeHuckabee @ShannonBream @FoxNews In tune I hope.		Then follow up with:		"We shall not be moved".		Special dedication to all Democratic Senators and House members, who have one shred of love for the protection of the USA.
@LisaMei62 @realDonaldTrump Thank you.		That is on a day when Dr Martin Luther King Junior is remembered, including by President Donald Trump, a speech to sit alongside his, as the finest ever given.		The beauty of it is that like Dr King, President Trump is not doing this for reward		Donald we do love you.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump On the day commemorating the life and passing of Dr Martin Luther King Junior.		You have no right invoking his name or memory to aid any political cause.		He acted upon his beliefs &amp; did so in the name of God.		He did not seek reward.		If your cause is so weak then abandon it.

President Trump		Democrat Deception		Democrat Demand	- Open the Government		Democrat Dilemma	- Past promises not kept		Democrat Intent	1. You open Govt.	2. On promise of talks.	3. Talks go nowhere.	4. Delay &amp; deferred to 2020.	5. 2020	Trump petulance closed Govt. then no deal.
@puhlio1 Karen,	Anytime.		Huge feeling of emptiness 		Take your time, acknowledge what you have to, sister-in-law's pretty special, they won the heart of your brother.		Say all you need to say, this is a one time affair.		A lot of people are passing far earlier than expected		Stay safe.
@puhlio1 I offer my sincerest condolences.	Sept 2018 then Oct 2018 I lost my GodMother and favourite Aunt, then my Father's only brother.		So I do understand, it is now a very difficult time.		You take care, know my best wishes extend to you and your Family.		God Bless
@AnnCoulter @Chris_1791 Ms Coulter,		He is not offering amnesty.		Hard deal to do as DNC is untrustworthy.		Schumer says Open Government we can talk.		Democrats in past said same, and did nothing.		Wall will get built.		If you want better, run for Public Office.		Trump trying, talk is cheap.
Senator Chuck Schumer		Your Honesty	1. 30 years lack of action.	2. Allow misappropriation $.		How dare you:	3. Say President Trump has gun to your head.	4. Say President not honest.	5. Play with furloughed workers peace of mind.		Your hypocrisy is horrid.		Do your job.		Or resign
@mikefm1946 Brilliant.		Trust commonsense Chuck to propose this.		Senator Cruz,	Get this enacted urgently.		Question	Does President have right to file Presidential Order for compulsory acquisition of funds in National Interest.		Clearly funds actual &amp; account, accepted as proceeds of crime.
@HeatherChilders 		Heather,		You are a great host.		Blood Moon	&amp;	Frank Sinatra		Says it all.		Welcome back.

@chuckwoolery @RVLawson_Author Chuck,		Shaken not stirred.		No wonder Nancy makes no sense at all.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Carry on.		Have just dealt with idiot who can not grasp frozen Iranian assets, do not put $1 into USA coffers to pay for surveillance/enforcement costs USA wears, to stop Iran getting Nth Korean or Chinese nuclear weapons for missiles.		To them USA, welfare fund.
@trumper_tantrum Your failure to speak to the merits of the deal, yet your disparaging of me, says it all		All care, no responsibility.		Maybe an early tweet of mine not clear enough.		Did not expect such a stupid response, or wish to push it.		I have dealt internationally for decades know ropes
@trumper_tantrum Understand this.		My Family has fought for King, Queen, country &amp; USA for 1000 years.	Don't speak to me of service	Look at	Fort Knox &amp; Schofield Barracks to know my family.	USA has been bludged off for years.	Obama doing what he did was wrong, no payment to USA, USA wears cost.
@trumper_tantrum I don't think we have them US$150 billion at all.		Thank you for your service.		You miss the point.		Assets frozen not liquidated		So who pays USA for costs including surveillance including:	Carrier fleets in Indian Ocean and Arabian Gulf.		Sanctions gone Iran gets a free pass
@trumper_tantrum 	Your apology is in order.		USA not world welfare fund.		Iran is world danger.	Who pays USA for sea surveillance stopping Iran putting Nth. Korean nuclear weapons on missiles aimed at Eygpt, S.Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Israel.		Frozen = unsold, USA pays.		Obama fool.
@lcummins579 	Thanks Lisa
@Elizabe10203440 Thanks.		You know many criticize USA.		USA does not always get it right, but eventually does.		Post-WW2 world peace due to USA military might, then reserve currency status.		If China, took that from USA.		God help us all.		2030, USA debt untenable.		Trump is USA ace.		He can fix.
@unscriptedmike @Rocket54441 You are right.		Imagine.		9% of USA population gone.		Equals 12% lift in standard of living, if drugs down big, through border wall.		Over time	Less crime, health costs, law enforcement 	More productivity, safer, USA happier.		To not be unrealistic, this is a Win Win in every way
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Carry on.	In post-World War Two USA, this is biggest stand ever.		Democrats 	Only argue, no yield, it is his campaign promise.		Drugs alone	Destroying learning abilities of children, future of USA.		You will save USA trillions.	(Health, Law, Productivity)		WALL.
@trumper_tantrum 	Iran Sanctions		You eg: of what DT &amp; I have issue with.	USA not welfare fund.		Explain	Iranian assets frozen.	Not confiscated/liquidated.	Enforcement costs paid by USA.	Obama frees Iran sanctions, no sale frozen assets gifts  USA spend, over US$150Bn.	Allies $0
@jetrotter 	Why the Mexican J. Lo?		You are much better looking.
@trumper_tantrum @Jenn198523 @bacchaus351 How much do you know about International Finance and Settlements?		140 characters does not give space for points, I tried to shorthand it.		No offence	Do you have experience?		Clearly Obama did not take a loaded C130A to Tehran.
@Elizabe10203440 Correct.		Why on all currency it states	"......(note) is legal tender for all public &amp; private debt"		Believe me that:	"Jewel In The Crown" China desperate to get hands on 		If Democrats keep distracting President, USA may not be able to oppose (2030).		USA must pay debt
@LisaMei62 	You are a straight shooter.		Question Please	2024 Putin's last time in power comes to an end.		Would I be right in assuming given the Yeltsin years &amp; the strength of Putin, the lid in the ensuing power struggle could really come off, and seriously destabilise world?
@Sparky20073397 I agree.		If Democrats could check their egos at the door.		Firstly it would give everyone  more headroom &amp; breathing space.		Secondly it would allow for constructive resolution of a matter which is only going to get worse.		Pre-planning for the future is best type of leadership.
@1skycaptain @Jenn198523 @davidhogg111 Never had a chance to respond to you the other day 		Gosh, you must have been glad you had the only real effective argument to thugs like that.		Well done.		In days gone by, sheriff's, Wells Fargo used Greeners or "riot", real deterrent.		Hope you got kiss &amp; hug!
@doctorneilsmith @Jenn198523 Correct.
@trumper_tantrum @Jenn198523 @bacchaus351 Thank you.	In large part you're right.	However, there were number of additional costs over years which those funds could pay for, i.e: surveillance.		That money has to come from an income stream or it is paid from New Money.		Obama was reckless, Iran is not a good global citizen.
@Susrez 	Don't know Susan.	Some like, some don't, some copy 	I figured where appropriate may be nice way to comment.		Notice President Trump said Cryin' Chuck the other day, when he says Nagging Nancy, I guess I will high 5 myself.		You're good Susan		Has shutdown hit you at all?
@ColinJeffrey6 Thanks Colin.		Always trust a Scots not to varnish the truth		Agree, EU basically held the 2nd lgst economy as p/thing		Excl: Draghi, EU Crtl. Bank, rest in power German supporters.		Never put UK in top spot.		Same with UN, never USA or UK in top spot.		Can't always pick friends.
@Tweets2Maggie 	Thanks
@sallis1rena2 	Thanks Paula
@ColinJeffrey6 	Thanks Colin,	How's Scotland?		Serious Question	How is the feeling re:Brexit?		Correct me if I am wrong will you; did former SNP Leader Alex Salmon, support or oppose a vote to leave EU?
Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-Tx)		Future President		Definitive Speaker.	Intelligent, no bs, looks good	When President Trump's 2nd Term is over, real possibility.		2020	Anti-Trump Bias must be kicked to touch.	Donald Trump must be re-elected.
Debbie Dingell (D-MI)	Trump Critic	States she finds the closing of 6 areas of Government by Donald Trump to be ridiculous, abhorrent, needless.		But can not explain:	1. Why Border Security	Not enacted properly for 30 years?	2. Where funds gone to pay for it?		Then says no honesty
@AnitaDidomenic1 	I know it was in reply to a dig I had at Schumer.		But the concept of a grown man being handled by latex anything conjures up some rather weird concepts.		I do not like Schumer at all, but even in fun pushing this.		Not for me
@TheJordanRachel @realDonaldTrump Exactly.		How many shutdowns have happened since they Durbin, Hoyer, Cummings have been there, plus add in retired Harry Reid, John Kerry, and Barack Obama.		Unfortunately,	Donald Trump, is a very easy, visible target to have a shot at, the Democrats are full of it.
@Jenn198523 @bacchaus351 What does that message refer to please?	What the heck is TDS?
@RealLiteSleeper @Jenn198523 @Fuctupmind @MarketSavant I do support Rule of Law, my ancestor Gen. Henry Knox fought for America's Independence to secure it.		If Barr had major role in that horrid episode in USA history do you think he would get free pass?		This forum may give you 15 mins of fame, but do not 	engage me on conspiracies
@dyl30g 	Nothing personal but would appreciate originality.	Or does everything I do get copied?
@Jenn198523 	Never seen that:	Ode to Hillary.		I drafted Ode to Chuck independently.		But it is clever.		Albeit I did mine in 140 characters.
@mitchellvii @Tweets2Maggie Schiff happens
@Jenn198523 @chuckschumer Sometimes people build walls even around their hearts, to have them melted as obstacles by a kind word, or a gesture, from a would be lover, or friend, or even a stranger.		Walls are not immoral it is like everything, how anything is used.		Donald,	Build the wall.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump President Trump		Washington for 30 years has become a cesspool of lobbyists, corruption, nation building &amp; Gross Abuse of Power.		President Trump	Stands alone as a man who can be trusted to fight for an America, many believe lost.		It's not, it's promise is in eyes of every child
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump You used to be such an attractive woman.		Then you went off the rails and now you are as ugly as sin.		Did they run out of roles for left leaning liberal morons in Hollywood.		Get a new script.		Trump is not the problem.		Clinton, Pelosi, Schumer, and Durbin are.		Obama a fool.
@doctorneilsmith @Jenn198523 Gone to Tehran
@CliffShep 	Nothing is impossible to trace.	Not if you know not what you are looking for, but how to look.	That is how we broke Swiss banking secrecy.
@LaRae_Writes 	Like many politicians and lawyers when x-rayed.		Doctors found them unusually, to be:	Gutless, heartless, and spineless.
@Kimmerztweets 	Thank you
@ragstorm 	Thanks you.	You have to have some fun.
Ode to Chuck		There was a Senator called Schumer,		In politics so long, hardly a learner,		Asked to fund security on the stump,		He refused a President called Trump,		So the voters not liking his way,		Took 7 of his Senators away.		Moral	Don't ignore a man called Trump.
@JohnWRoss7 	Thanks John
@LaRae_Writes @SenSchumer No paper.	Nothing to go on.
@DeplorableTrump @casabrenat Long live Twitter.		Mr President.		Found the opening of a 24 Hour White House Television Station		You could find it initially out of Presidential Discretionary Fund.

@Jenn198523 Democrats Misappropriate Southern Border Security $$		To Clarify	Total Appropriations last 12 years Homeland Security specifically Southern Border over $80bn		Total payroll same time less than $25bn.		Where balance?		Raided to pay Iran		With several other funds		Obama not Trump
@Jenn198523 	Check your Direct Messages
@Jenn198523 You Want Boring &amp; Reckless	African-American woman on Twitter asks, if funds were appropriated for Wall last 3 Budgets, where is it?		Q	What is only large unusual multi-billion $ payout not in USA by Govt.		Obama gave Iran $150Bn.		Q	Is that why DNC so antiwall	Their secret is out
@RealLiteSleeper @Jenn198523 @Fuctupmind @MarketSavant Pal,	Humans like him are skin to an iceberg, 10% visible, rest does not come out unless needed.		I am not naive, but I will not have my valuable life taken up by conspiracy theorists who try to tell me how to think.		Don't do that again.		Right now USA needs Hard Rule of Law.
@Jenn198523 @chuckschumer Slat Fence Problem	Only problem with slat wall is that if drug runners caught by a single Border Guard they can shoot guard through slats.	Concrete wall can have surveillance or tasked satellite(s) to watch.
@RealLiteSleeper @Jenn198523 @Fuctupmind @MarketSavant Barr is a traditionalist.		Big difference.		With respect,	It is enough to think on acts of Democrats let alone on conspiracy theories.		I have open mind, if his push of Rule of Law is symbolic of Deep State I don't see it.		At this time, the Rule of Law has never been needed more
@Elizabe10203440 I believe it, we had it as bad operating against aborigines in Australia.		However,	It is now 2019, so historical argument does not fly.		Principally, due to obligation of USA to report numbers to the UN.		USD$ only reserve currency on Earth so USA obligations must be met.
@SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi,		That is good.		Add into that Bill.		Make foundation document upon which eventual reform of immigration is based.		Then in bi-partisan way, all furloughed staff can go back to work &amp; both sides of The House of Congress can act in best interests of USA.		Well done
@HeatherChilders You are not on FOX at present.		Hope you are OK Heather		The interviewing on your show of late by you, has been really very good, strong and determined, by you, to get answers to questions, not platitudes.		Pray you are due back soon.

@NBCNews A Big Deal		Women are 50% of the population yet have long been under represented in every facet of life.		Even a bad Presidential candidate like Hillary Clinton has still touched a flame to the torch of igniting women.		Men have to realize women bear, nurture, and raise us all.
@ressiger1111 	Thanks Sharon
@ChuckCallesto @KimberlyMcLach1 Pelosi Slurs Words		Just like food outlives its Best By Date.		Nancy Pelosi's falseness has a past its Best By Date smell reaching around the globe.

@Fuctupmind @MarketSavant William Barr is Alcatraz		Democrats opposed 	Using plastic teaspoons on its wall.		He is composed, and when needed taciturn, at other times engaged, but very competent.		Rule of Law will prevail
@LindseyGrahamSC @peterwhiteboy1 You are referring to BuzzFeed?		If you are, about time.		That sort of cheap fishing journalism in another time and place could predicate war.		Not good.		Prosecute for attempted subversion of justice.		Well done.
Baby Falls From Car - Safe		A baby in a car baby seat not secured properly in the car, fell out onto the roadway.		Miraculously baby safe.		Mother to be prosecuted.		Car Seat Manufacturer	No matter how bad it is, your car seat kept the baby safe.		Well done on a great design.
President Trump		Anyone doubt he in charge!		Listen to his pro-Life address from White House.		Too many lawyers, journalists, politicians forget		Founding Document of The United States of America is:	The Declaration of Independence		Principle	Life, Liberty, Pursuit of Happiness.
@BlueStateSOS @TRUMP2021105090 @gatewaypundit Yours is such a logical question.		Yet there is never a response from Speaker Pelosi.		The silence is much more than deafening.		It is treasonous 		It appears Democrats have neither respect for Office of President (tantrums) nor of USA security (border).		Clearly Pelosi wants S25
Special Counsel - BuzzFeed		BuzzFeed	Posts story which convicts President Trump of felony.		Special Counsel	Rare step goes public:	BuzzFeed story not correct.		BuzzFeed	Replies asking Spec.Counsel to specify.		Summary	BuzzFeed prints rubbish to gain reply then fishes		Charge them
@jaketapper @DonaldJTrumpJr Mr Tapper,	You enjoy a privileged and prime position, in American media, and much of the time you are a true professional.

@LetsNotWorry19 No worries.	Thank you.
@LetsNotWorry19 @Jenn198523 @davidhogg111 Nor do I want to.	I am only interested in serious credible news that is directly related to the sound and peaceful progress of the USA.

@LetsNotWorry19 @Jenn198523 @davidhogg111 Resembles a young Dick Durbin, just looks more intelligent.
@davidhogg111 Your statement is nonsense		The lady I was in love with was in Tower One in 2001.		Their attackers came from a lot further than a mile away.		You need to remember what President George W. Bush &amp; New York Mayor Rudi Guiliani said after that attack		They need only be right once
@Kashmir27Wolff 	Thanks Kashmir
@realDonaldTrump 		Bring it to an end, wall funds in place no drama/oversight 		End shutdown, with apology to workers as needed.		Contractors do not get paid?	That needs looking into.		When Barr in place up end sanctuaries, as to access they commit federal offence.		Build wall.
@realDonaldTrump Just watch your step.	Get a good night's sleep.	Then knock them out of park		You did right cancelling her.		Pay rosters are prepared a week in advance.		Her action was a slap in the face to furloughed staff.		But it showed you are acting on principle, her acts merely for spite.
@Drevmar @Jenn198523 Yes.	More materially deadly.	The problem with the swamp DT is trying to drain is that when he detonates something, it explodes, and the muck not only stinks it get on everything.		I have a real hate of liars, thieves, and hypocrites.		This current crop of Dem's are appalling.

Pelosi &amp; Democrats Flying to Afghanistan		If Speaker Pelosi, 11 other Congressional Democrats + staff wish to fly to Afghanistan, there is an option.		To save money they hire Lear Jet &amp; do it British way.		English to get 100 in a Mini (car) made 1 foreman rest crawled up his ass.

@Sparky20073397 Agreed.
To My Tweeters		Just had a misinterpretation of a tweet to me cleared up perfectly.		You are all first class!		Why can't Washington work this way.		Speaker Pelosi	Give Donald $10Bn this year &amp; next, tell him get it done.		He will publicly thank you &amp; say USA moving forward.
@Sparky20073397 No worries Sparky.		Thank you for the courtesy of replying to clarify.		If only Washington would work so well.		No one can say Donald is not trying.		God Bless.
@Sparky20073397 	Were you calling me a socialist?	Do not ever make that mistake again 	When members of my Family helped to build the USA.	Ocasio-Cortez is a misguided fool, and I am a Conservative.
@kurteichenwald Trump denial Cohen claim		He does not need to deny it.		The accusation is meritless.		A murderer can be believed as they are not a liar.		Cohen is not only a liar.

President Trump		Reasons for my Suggestion		STATE Of The UNION SPEECH	Oval Office is People's Office		Plus:	No need extra security costs		SHUTDOWN FIX	Do it immediately.	No need publicity.		MORAL HIGH GROUND	You now own it.	Pelosi is finished.	Democrats 2020 finished.
President Trump		STATE Of UNION SPEECH	In keeping with your wish for USA Government to not be wasteful:		Deliver SPEECH from:	The People's Oval Office		GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN	Fix.	1. Jt.Chiefs confirm money there to Pay Homeland Security &amp; for WALL	2. Sign all Bills except CR/HSec.
@BeliaK7 	Yes you are exactly correct

@707Damage To be honest.		A lot of this went under radar		Mahathir was very good.		At time:	Malaysia:	1. Largest chip manufacturer.		2. Built sister city to Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya to move Malaysia to modern.		3. Petronas Towers just up.		It was almost like Soros was a bump in the road.
@707Damage I just posted a general reply.		To answer your question.		Soros had executed run on British Pound, then Yen, then he attacked Ringgit.		He lost sufficient capital in his run against ringgit to clip his wings.		Now he resurfaces.		Soros is a loathesome being		He profits off chaos.
@707Damage 	Mahathir 1998.		Asian financial crisis hit in 1997, by early 1998, Yen and Malay ringgit bad.		Mahathir	Commonwealth Games due. Passed law foreign visitors on departure leave with Malay ringgit only		Enacted Malaysia pocketed USD$4bn in currency profit over 60 days.
@707Damage 	You do not know
Trump Clips Pelosi Wings		USA Trump hating Press	Grow Up		Speaker Pelosi	1. POTUS - No State of Union Address	2. Refuses to budge on Wall	3. Lies about POTUS security		President Trump	1. Let's do a deal.	2. No play until a deal		President	Commander-in-Chief visited troops on Xmas
@Jenn198523 Soros is Evil	Ask Malaysian Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Bin Mohamed &amp; Prime Minister Abe of Japan about George Soros.		Soros caused the Asian Financial crisis 1997-1998.		He saw chance to leverage his capital to take down Yen and Ringgit, only brilliance of Mahathir stopped him.
@brithume 	Always liked you.	You hark back to an era of journalism that was fact rather than vitriolic opinion based.	Welcome chance to debate with you, on real issues.	God Bless.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump This is a DNC shutdown.		Be honest.		As likely Speaker you told President Trump at The White House he did not have Congressional votes for Bill funding Wall.		You deliberately misled The President into taking  responsibility for a shutdown you &amp; Sen. Schumer own.		Grow up, fix it
@AnnCoulter 	I am led to believe you like me were convinced when Donald ran for Office he would win.		I am on official Government Record in New Zealand, on the day he announced his candidacy for stating he would win, and NZ policy had to move that direction.		Known him since 1995

@SenFeinstein @mozingod123 Senator,		That was a principal platform of Democratic President Barack Obama.		At that time, you had the capacity to carry out his agenda.

@charliechick7 	Hi Cheryl,	Thank you.
@davidaxelrod @POTUS @realDonaldTrump 87% of people surveyed say the shutdown is not affecting them.		Your Blue color is showing.		How can you support people who allow the Southern Border to remain a Clear &amp; Present danger to the USA.
@Jenn198523 	You are so cute.
@ShirleyCatron 	Thank you Shirley.	Sad day.	Not a game.	Some think it is.	People actually get killed.	I would jail Pelosi, Schumer
President Trump		Pelosi &amp; Schumer &amp; Clinton's		You are so close to sxposing Clinton corruption, you now have the swamp trying to stop you.		On a day when brave USA Special Forces have been killed, keep on pushing.		Know Founding Father's had traitors in their midst.		Deal to them
@SteveScalise @Cb59Carolina75 @realDonaldTrump Tell the USA voter, not just on Twitter.		In 2020, these obstructinists must be removed.		Democrats were the same at the time of passing the 13th Amendment on the abolition of slavery.		They opposed the first format, then did not fully support it.		Yet they try to claim credit.
@goombahracer 	Thank you Reverend.	God Bless.	You need the patience of Job with these Democrats.
@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump,		US Casualties in Syria.		Get tough on Democrats now		Their arguing like spoiled brats has pinpointed chance for ISIS &amp; other mongrels to strike USA forces.		Take gloves off, hit ISIS with airpower to destroy.		Warn Democrats jail for treason.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump.		State of the Union Address		Tell Nagging Nancy Pelosi to get stuffed.		You have right to address USA and tell public the truth, which includes a lot of really good news.		Speaker Pelosi is trying to remove your visibility again.		Democrats should fund the wall
@goombahracer 	Thanks Reverend,	Yes you are on the money.		I doubt anyone will question boys will be boys &amp; Donald did try it on		But that is a long time ago &amp; he has done so much good both in USA &amp; globally since this anti-feeling is inexplicable.		I can attest to DT's courtesy

@MichaelDelauzon @ManeBlonde Deduct $14,465.75 off each of them on average, being:	176,000/365 X 30 Days		Or days s/down lasts.		Use the nearly $8 million to pay costs of those staff furloughed who had to get bridging finance for non payment of salaries		Would love President Trump to EO it, see who opposes.
@catturd2 @TheJuliaWeber Hey Fireball,		Well said.
@Jenn198523 	Hello.		How is your sojourn in this space.		Love you.
@electrode66 	Thanks David
TRUMP - Supporting Russia	This is nonsense		FACT	Bill Clinton got USD$7Bn off USA Finance Houses/Banks to pay Russia World Bank default to stop invasion of Poland &amp; Czech Republic.	FACT	Lehman did not contribute	FACT	Obama/Hillary	Lehman no bailout = GFC	Iran = lifted sanctions
@Elizabe10203440 @ajsrun1 How is this possible?		Look to blame those responsible 		When the application was made, Notices must have been filed, so who:	1. Filed this.	2. Filed a Notice of Opposition	to get this to a hearing.		Or is this an interim injunction.		No census can exclude citizenship numbers.
@pablocrz62 @YouTube Biggest damage to USA free capital.		Alan Greenspan's repeated cuts in cash rate over 4 hrs which precipitated GFC.		Why?		He cut interest rates retirees use to bolster capital.		As they had to dip into capital discretionary spending &amp; investing shrank and/or became more risky.
@ShannonBream @foxnewsnight @FoxNews Shannon,	This has been said before.		You do not need makeup.		Any camera which does not show you to be a truly beautiful woman, needs a change of lens.		I  sure I speak for all sane men
@peterwhiteboy1 	Thanks Peter.	The liberals seem to lack any scruples or commonsense.
@Beyonce 	You are due to perform Down Under.		Australia and New Zealand.		Hope this finds you and yours fit and well and happy.		God Bless
@repjohnlewis 		Sir,		You stood with Dr Martin Luther King Junior.		You love your country.		You rightfully push your race hoping for greater equality &amp; opportunity.		President Trump has pushed those issues &amp; is succeeding.		Sir,		Please support his push for more border security?
@StevieNicks 	Stephanie,		I pray my tweet finds you in good health, and as happy as you wish to be.		YouTube is a marvellous tool but nothing can beat seeing you live.		Or sitting down having a lemonade and lime with you and a quiet chat.		You look fabulous.		Love you Stephanie
@taylorswift13 	Pray you are having a good time on your tour.		If complete I pray you enjoyed yourself and took your music to many new fans.		You are quite an act.		In every sense.		God Bless.
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,	I will be forwarding to you a Brief:	Proposal 8E: 2019-2029.		That document will not now be with you until February 2019.		Thank you
@HeatherChilders 	You have responded to prior tweets of mine.		I am both curious &amp; concerned.		You are absent from FOX.		Are you OK?		If you need help with anything reach out, and I will help if legally possible.		Take care Heather.
@LeslieFeffer 	Thanks Leslie,	Two people taught me that	1. Dr Norman Vincent Peale.	2. Richard deVoss Senior.		Lesson well learned.
@DavidShaneMcD 	Thanks David
@realDonaldTrump @DavidShaneMcD Where have you ever had an opportunity to continually fire off on so many different subjects and be completely engaged.		No wonder you are getting very little sleep.		What a job.		At least I know you respect it.		God Bless You	and 	God Bless the United States of America.
@bba063c98b4e409 	Thanks 	Reporting like this is childish
@JanieVanHalen @DannyLedford4 Old rule.	To be successful.	Pay yourself first.	It is not greed.
@SenRickScott @yoly4Trump @foxandfriends @FoxNews Sen. Scott.		I have an apology to make to you.		You are clearly a driven man, reliable and commonsense.		Trust you will back Donald and good policy for USA.		Those two caveats usually converge.		God Bless.
@greeneyedlucy84 @peterwhiteboy1 Who cares		Donald paid for it.		Not taxpayers.		Grow up!
@magnettothesea @StevieNicks @fleetwoodmac Stephanie,		That was a long time ago sweetheart.		I pray you are well, and you are allowing that glorious voice of yours to rest and recouperate.		You know when we meet again, the four words I would love to hear you say to me, and it is a long time since Sydney.		Love you always.
@washingtonpost Trump Wall	Border Tunnels found		That is why he wants to build a wall.		Israel had same problem until they built the wall around the then new settlements.		Foundations go deep and are reinforced no tunnels.		You liberal lefties really have no clue, not do you care about the USA.
@BillKristol Mr Kristol,	Wrong, confirm - Rep. Lieu.		Sec. Mattis gave Order that in event of nuclear attack his position to be informed first.		That impeded Presidents "Chain of Command" right to Order First Strike Response.		Mattis Illegal Order	Threatened lives of all Americans		Sacked.
@LisaMei62 @StorinoCarmella These Democrats are just un-American
@DoingRight1 @KathleenFiscel1 @POTUS Brilliant!
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump Mr Fitton,	Saw you for first time on Fox yesterday.		Like the cut of your jib.
@realDonaldTrump Enact a Presidential Order cutting their pay.
@realDonaldTrump @Lexmex14 I wonder content of runway talks b/w Loretta &amp; Clinton.		Your troubles due to 	"Zero deficit" Bill (42) giving US$7Bn (non-Govt) to pay Russia World Bank default		Lehman refused to help, denied bailout, GFC started		Did Russia then pay Bill to get Obama to drop Iran sanctions?
@HinksonIrving 	Thanks Irving
Democrats in Puerto Rico		Cost of trip paid for by who?		Tell me did the Democrats pay for this out of the "tippy-toppy" of their salaries?		Or did taxpayers?		Schedules are changed all the time, they should have been in California for fires, and now for the Wall.
@senatemajldr No Senator McConnell		If it smells of hypocrisy	looks hypocritical it usually is.		Only problem with this hypocrisy:	Sworn Law Enforcement Officers are being killed as are innocent Americans.		When are Democrats going to be held guilty of negligent homicide?		0 accountability.
@electrode66 		David,		Thank you for retweeting me		Love the image at back of your address.		I wonder what view they would have had at the dishonesty of Democrats in this a modern context.		They had traitors back then, and a rather immediate and permanent fix.		Keep in touch.
@charliekirk11 You are not meant to see that.
@ShannonBream 	You run a great show.		I could not believe when you had guests comment on Barr, at the very end, one could not contain himself and had to imply a slur on him without evidence.		His credibility for life, gone.		Keep up the good work.
@cvpayne @HinksonIrving Charles	You have a voice.		Vocally come out for Trump.		Close the border.		Democrats want immigration reform before they lock the stable door.		That stable door (border) locked, before immigration reform, reduces drugs also		Drugs destroy children's learning &amp; future productivity
@Micheleta14 @StorinoCarmella @RealJamesWoods Nero fiddling while Rome burns.		Simple Question	In 2020 can any Democrat truly stand for public Office, in any capacity:	President	Senate	House	and claim they have best interests of America at heart?		Americans are not stupid.	No matter number illegals voting.		2020 - DNC - No.
@bmcalif14 @Jenn198523 @jamersr13 Chance to take action comes again in 2020		In 2018, American voters lied to by Democrats voted to take House away from POTUS.		And not give him 60 Senate votes.		If Dems ousted DT in 2020, market would drop 12,000 point in 5 days.		401K values trashed.		Trump needs clear mandate.
@charliekirk11 Charlie,	Not criticism, your figure is too low.		ME	Scott Dunlap (1990's) USA, famous for fixing corporates I was said to be Euro equal.		Your estimate is very low.		Simple Rationale.		Illegals 9% pop.		USA GDP $22 TN = $1.9Tn		Low paid = 20% nml wages		Still $380Bn per year
@realDonaldTrump Yes you are, which is why:		2020	You are re-elected.	GOP gets back House.	GOP gets 60+ in Senate.		Keep on wall, Democrat position untenable.		Did you see wall survey?	Wash. Post?		Fake	42% support for wall.		But	87% GOP		On 2016 	GOP = 40% of 42%		Only 2% support from DNC/Indep
@KayaJones 	You no pussycat.		Strong advocate truth, justice &amp; American way		How people forget USA Founding Principles:	Life, Liberty &amp; Pursuit of Happiness.		GOP President, Senate, House = USA happy.		Now DNC House = Chaos		2020	Re-elected	House - GOP	Senate - GOP 60 seats
@bmcalif14 	You are right!
@KellyannePolls Sorry,	I spelt your name wrong, my humble apologies.		You are an absolute classic.		Your rapier-like sarcasm to fools in the Press, brilliant.		Acosta is a narcissistic moron.		I pray American women do appreciate just how much of an equal opportunity boss President Trump truly is
@MoganDane 	Thanks Mogan
@realDonaldTrump I am so very sorry for you.		You want the best for USA.	I know you love your nation.		My worry USA Debt 		Must:	1. Stop growing.	2. Be paid		You To Date	1. Tax cuts	2. USMCA.	3. Drawdowns	4. China FTA	5. Sthn Border &amp; Wall		Big threats	1. Dems wear you out  	2. Low DOW Diversity
@realDonaldTrump 		To KellyAnn Conway		You are an absolute sweetheart.		Your sarcastic wit a delight.		DT is well served by a cadre of very competent &amp; intelligent women, you are of that group.		I pray self determined American woman, realize how much he values women &amp; loves USA.
@guardianweaver @Jenn198523 @realDonaldTrump Christie	Yes because with Huckabee Donald knows he can trust them, now they can step up.		Look Chris Christie has his critics so what, he was good enough to be Gov of NJ.		For far too long GOP argues internally, those two can do the job, no debates, just get on with it.		DT clear
@Jenn198523 I am so glad you little minx
@Jenn198523 	I thought you were going to sleep.		Go!
@realDonaldTrump 		Fight Back Hard		Sir,	Take offensive.	Mueller blank, you knew, we knew, you love USA 		Appoint	Presidential warrant	1. Gov. Mike Huckabee.	2. Gov. Chris Christie		Special Investigators	Investigations into DOJ &amp; FBI &amp; prosecute anyone held guilty of malfeasance.
@q4aprwin3_1229 Twitter at its finest.
@DeplorableTrump @jamfixer Survey Blame for Shutdown		This misses two critical groups.		Senate Republicans	Senate Democrats		Add them to list delete none.		Senate Democrats will be held most responsible as they are.		10 votes, oh sorry 7 votes.		Sen. Schumer disgraceful.
@charliekirk11 FBI Fail To Check Clinton		You are right.		But goes further than you realize because you are not quite old enough.		President Clinton had Russian $7Bn default on World Bank loan paid by US finance houses.		Lehman refused, Paulsen told no bailout, GFC started.		Follow the money
@JohnFromCranber @xbrooklynite21 Yes,	You are right, Hillary would have cemented his acts to detriment of USA, because they can not grasp as theorists, USA is a giant business with social responsibilities.	Not once did Hillary or Dems refer to paying down the debt.	Trump will.	He knows USA future if he does not.
@burns1040 Agree ,100%
@jamersr13 	Very good,	I'll pay that one,	Setup needs work,	But oh what fun.		The Dems are nuts,	Gone over the edge,	No help for the People,	They don't even hedge.		Dems really are out of line, 	And they are, out of time,	Worse they cheekily do it,	On the USA tax payers dime
@realDonaldTrump But you know, and I know:		She Warren squaw talkem with forked tongue
@RyanAFournier Brave woman.		Notice the Democrat men do not have the guts.		Further,		One could hardly say this lady has an ulterior motive as she may be ostracized.		Therefore she is being honest.		Very well done.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Right on.		Time USA used her military might &amp; her brave men &amp; women, a last resort, not cannon fodder.		Erdogan must realize this is not WW1 nor Gallipoli, and Ottoman Empire long gone.		Q.	Who leeked war plan workup against Nth.Korea?	If leak, find &amp; jail them.
@MarketSavant 	Thank you for noticing the Poem.		Democrats are forsaking the USA.
@Richieamx 	Re the Poem		Thank you for noticing.		Democrats forsake the USA
Twas the night b4 the next,	And Democrats are stumped,	They appear out of touch,	Truly they've been Trumped.		They reach here reach there,	Not hearing voters call,	Partying in Puerto Rico,	Instead of building the Wall.		So what lesson must they take,	Your country, do not forsake.
@JudgeJeanine 	Your interview with President Trump,		Very well done.		See my tweet says it all.		Donald Trump is thoroughly genuine, and a one-off.		USA would be very foolish to disregard his unique skillset and his ability to enact.		Results really matter.		God Bless.
@Jenn198523 They are not sane.		USA is Israel's greatest ally.		Does USA have to longterm endure radical Islamic ideals within her Congressional midst, in the name of diversity.		Lucky 2020 there is another vote on her membership of Congress.		The will of the People.
@schul47 @Jenn198523 Yes
@StarkVegasRD 	Thank you.
Judge Jeanine on FOX with President Trump.		Any doubts about the honest frankness of Donald Trump should be gone.		Whether you are a GOP or DNC usual backer.		Look at your pay rate, less tax, boosted 401K funds for your retirement		This President cares about you, 2020 vote him in
Kim,	I am to get married this year.	Very lucky.	Would it be possible to ask you, pretty please, to sing that song at our wedding.	I will make all accommodations to.make that possible.	It would be so appropriate.	Thank you for tweeting	Love you, keep safe
@TheBreckWorsham @POTUS Stunning commentator, stunning commentary.		Keep it up in all senses.
@DoktorPaulie @DejackomeLisa Ppzpppppzzzzzzpz
Castro launches Bid for Presidency.		Notwithstanding background story &amp; current position of service there is NO way a Castro can be allowed anywhere near USA Presidency.		Given:		1. Sth.American illegal migration and Hispanics at 12% USA pop.		2. Castro - Cuba Communism.		No USA.
@AnnaMar15091009 @NoRightWing @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump You are a fool if you think Donald Trump is subservient to any human.		And he passionately loves the United States of America which clearly you do not.		Carry on backing Pelosi &amp; you will further your irrelevancy.
@jamesho93139786 Pelosi	That is possible.	Until she got considerably older in the last 10 years she was still a good looking woman, seriously well put together.		But she now looks, tired and washed out, and mean 		She hurts USA and blames everyone else.		There's a word for that 		Useless
@jamesho93139786 @aghjr1 @Jenn198523 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump A nice cold beer, washed down with a vintage bourbon, and not a damned, incompetent, moronic, lying Democrat getting drinking space.		Thanks Jim		Have one for me.
Katie Hill (D) - California		You started your argument looking reasonable.		Then you descended into a varying level of misinformation and outright inflammatory lying.		By the way, you swore an Oath to uphold the Constitution, so that is not Mr Trump, but President Trump.		Grow up
@realDonaldTrump Watch your step.		I have never seen opposition party with such a pathological hate for you.		It is demented.		You need to be harder.		If you take the fight to them right now I feel 70%+ will support you.		Clearly, better to resolve it.		Courts have no right to review Nat.Em. call
Kim Carnes	Love Comes From The Most Unexpected Places.		Kim,		Long regarded this best love song I have ever heard &amp; notwithstanding Barbra's or Jose Feliciano's versions, you sing your song best.		"If nothings said, then nothing is ever heard" 		So true, communication key		Thanks
@AdoredByMyKing 	Thank you.	What a crazy place American politics is right now!	You should be asleep.	Thank you
@SecNielsen @XMerc45 @DHSgov Madam Secretary,		I love Donald, he is a great guy, but I will say that both Speaker Pelosi in particular, and Senator Schumer are very lucky I was not President when you were asked to give evidence.		Which they interrupted.		I would have jailed them for contempt.		Great Job.
@yogagenie 	Noone could call you deplorable and retain any credibility as intelligent.	Well done
@q4aprwin3_1229 Thank you
Democrat Requiem		Twas the night b4 the next,	All through the Land,	No Dem was working,	All had been banned.		For publicly lying,	Not telling true fact,	On the Walls' safety,	I wish they were sacked.		To	Nancy, Chuck, &amp; Durbin the Dick,	You all tell lies because you are thick.
@SteveScalise Representative Scalise	You understand what your title truly means		Some in Congress dwell in an era where they could lie &amp; deceive &amp; get away with it, impervious to critique		In this age where knowledge is power &amp; all can access it, the dinosaurs will feel voter wrath.		Not you.
@NeilFinn Neil,	In the face of criticism 	To hell with them.		To you and yours	Have the happiest and most prosperous of New Year's.		Love to sing with you.
@SenateGOP @Juicerden GOP Debate		Your factual video.		Says it all.		Indisputable.		Action about time.		Back USA &amp; President Trump
@LouDobbs 		Lou,		Good thought.		A credible survey on a major medium to confirm public sentiment.		Surely a 70%+ result in favor of President Trump's wish for the Southern Border is conclusive.		Further, imagine in 2020, a China trade deal done, he gets 65% USA vote, LANDSLIDE..
@SpeakerPelosi 		Speaker Pelosi		Further to earlier tweet.		You are in Breach of Oath you swore to become both a Member and Speaker, to uphold and defend The Constitution.		USA Law is premised upon Innocence until proved Guilty yet you pre-judge The President.		Enough make offer!
@SpeakerPelosi @RepScottPeters @realDonaldTrump Speaker Pelosi		President Trump does not bear grudges.		Offer him full budget of USD$25Bn to get job done right!		He will take it &amp; your legacy will be intact.		Against USA Law you pre-judge him guilty of an act when he is innocent until proven guilty		Join him for USA benefit
@Tell_Michelle_ @tjd1943 You are most welcome.
@Redtowel4 🤗
@LindseyGrahamSC @ReneeMcCone @realDonaldTrump Senator Graham		Then move to Executive Order.		Difference	Use provisions of Constitution which vests in President Executive Power on National Security threats:	1. Financial	2. Physical.		NB:	Not trampled upon by Act.	Act not Amendment.	Courts have no overrule this.		See Fort Knox
@lilbulli1031 	Tracy,		You are a smart girl.		That quote of Jefferson has  never been more applicable.
@CongPalazzo 		Congressman,		Do me &amp; USA favour please.		Ask former Governor Haley Barbour about my Proposal 8E, from 2009-2010.		Then contact President Trump &amp; tell him that my Proposal 8E: 2019-2029 is a revamped version of that.		30 million jobs &amp; America debt free &amp; solvent.
@magnettothesea @StevieNicks Stephanie,	You do not look a day over 21.		Love you baby.
@GregNorberg @hilsbakbrace Barack Obama Large Office		Be fair he needs that size.		It is divided into space for:	1. Ruminating on errors - 20%	2. Regretting errors - 20%	3. DNC Member Waiting Room	3.1. Spkr Pelosi - 10%	3.2. Crying Chuck - 10%	3.3. Chuck's tissues - 50%		The % do not add up	Neither did he!
@Tell_Michelle_ @tjd1943 Nice to see she has some of the standards the DNC seems to set these days as mandatory for membership and public representation.		She should be fully audited by the IRS 		Michelle, forgive me, you are a stunning presenter.		Have a nice day
@bennyjohnson @BretBaier Yes	Some people are dumb.		Some of those people (Acosta).		Open their mouths and prove it.
@Pink_About_it @purplepam1952 The enemy within is looking more and more like the DNC
@Redtowel4 🤗
@Donadeedooda @jujube23 @WhiteHouse Yes
@ShannonBream 		Speaker Pelosi silence over death of sworn Police officer Singh meets your definition of evil?		But clear Directive from DNC to all Californian Members of Congress, House &amp; Senate, to say nothing truly evil.		California in 2020 needs to go Reagan &amp; support Trump
@Redtowel4 Priceless.	Looks like a duck.	Sounds like a duck.	It is a duck.		And they are quacked
@KatrinaPierson 	Keep up the good work.	Well done
@SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi,		You could not wait to start whining that old chestnut.		Since you, Chuck, Dick, Steny, &amp; Elijah have been in Congress there have been more shutdowns than ever.		You &amp; DNC Congress by dipping into pockets of innocent Americans, be ashamed		Schumer Senate shutdown.
@Jenn198523 That is terrible.	Can anything officially be done about this 	Or would Democrats interfere again with the rule of Law
@TheJordanRachel Exactly.		Nancy and Chuck,		Like a Trojan horse, are 5th Columnists.		The enemy within.
@POTUS 	Democrats can not take you to Court to challenge.		Constitution vests Executive Power in The President.		You tick both threat boxes:	1. Physical.	2. Financial.		Act not an Amendment.		Prior Presidential statement (Obama) contextual proof of border crisis.		Override Court.
Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY)		What is the matter with your personal integrity?		The Irish once had pride.		How can you to Bill Hemmer villify this President on his security measures for Southern Border, or intent to invoke Executive Power, given words &amp; actions of President Obama
@JackPosobiec @MAZINGERZMBA Only three responses one can make to that observation.		China view	Good things take time 		USA view	Time waits for no-one.		Applying to all	Time is on our side.		Really, which?	USA		Why	Because with China.	Procrastination is the thief of time.
@NoRinosNoDems 	The imagery of Donald John Trump as 007 a la Sean Connery is first class.		Doubtless a role he would have handled with discretion, distinction, and aplomb.		To the chagrin of Democrats.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		2019-2020 Your Presidency		Clearly unless DNC rejigs heirachy you do not get much cooperation as they embark on obstructionism.		This is example of how you act to move USA on &amp; up, hopefully it gets votes.		Ask Nancy if DNC give you full $25Bn, it may save her.
Heather Childers - FOX	Border Wall		Fabulous interview with Mr Davis.		That is an old name in that part of the country		I wonder how big his ranch is.		Speaker Pelosi,	What exactly has she done?		When asked to front, she did not, Obama won votes this issue.		Shocking		Good girl.
@RepHartzler @Tim_Poole_ @POTUS Well said.		In the most dignified way.
Pelosi &amp; Democrat Party.		You have 3 options		1&amp;2	1. Support Trump US$5.6Bn.		2. If you do not back it:		Pass Act compelling California (Sanctuary State) pay Arizona (non Sanctuary) funds to build full border length wall so checks on transits for safety		3. Do nothing	Traitorous.
@STEPHMHAMILL @SpeakerPelosi Stephanie,		You are not being tough 		Call it as it is.		If President Trump is forced to call a National Emergency		When 8% of USA population illegal, living off generosity of all Americans.		He is forced to do so due to Democratic Representatives lying to the American Public.
@Jenn198523 @jamesho93139786 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Thank you dear
@MuskieRuskie 	Thanks Randy,	A very beautiful lady friend so lifts my spirits, thought I would put some words together.		To be blunt poems on likes of Schumer, Pelosi, Comey etc.. easy.		Worst case would be if Dems had someone named Hunt.		Hard to rhyme without crudeness.
@joannapisani2 	Thank you	Schumer is a snotty nosed little prick.
Trump - The Wall - Media		Just watching:	Sean Hannity	Laura Ingraham.		FACTS	Trump to be re-elected 2020.	Public is turning on Media.	Media depends on sponsors		Sponsors:	See drop in public support.	Will pull sponsorship 		Media Owners	Costs you income	Tell your hosts - cool it.
@charliekirk11 Charlie,	Nice to see someone else using my open style layout.		Clarity delivers best.
@Jenn198523 @jamesho93139786 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump You like that.		It is yours.		Was thinking of one for Schumer,	As he says he knows the border,	But from New York does he know Yuma,	Was an army prison and a fort,	Not the Ritz if you got caught,	So Schumer says he knows the border,	Well Pal a wall gave Yuma &amp; El Paso, Law &amp; Order
@SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi,		President Trump initially, accepted responsibility for shutdown.		Due to you assuring American Public from White House, that a GOP House, prior to you as Speaker, would not pass Bill to fund Wall.		They passed the Bill.		Schumer Senate owns Shutdown.		So do you.
@TheJordanRachel 	Jordan,	Get into him		Make him uncomfortable.		He gives journalism a bad name.
@Acosta Acosta,	You have less standing than Hillary Clinton or Alyssa Milano.		You had affrontery to refuse Presidential Order relinquish microphone, Cease &amp; Desist.		You then bully a young girl doing her job.		Then you report false detail as fact.		Pathetic		Walter Cronkite you are not.
@justyemma 	Well said.
@Alleanna14 	Crazy Democrats.
@LoRosS26 	Thank you for your tweet.	This does not happen in Switzerland, under Canton system.	Keep in touch please.
@realDonaldTrump Good luck.		Keep safe.		Not all Texans are Republicans.		Watch your back.		Know that a lot more people love you, you big lug, than are seen in surveys.		If only Democrats would tell the truth, and back maybe a USD$30Bn spend, job can be done perfectly.
@RepAnthonyBrown 	Representative Brown,		Sorry to use an over asked question.		But you are such a misled, ill informed, and inexperienced political novice.		Clearly offered inducements by Speaker Pelosi.		If so bad, how come:	Obama, Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin etc, previous backers?
@realDonaldTrump 		President Trump		Well done.	Stay strong.		Get SCOTUS ruling legitimacy.		Declare National Emergency.		Co-opt Army Corps Engineers.		Build.		On legitimacy, fund to full completion to USD$??????		God Bless The United States of America.
@Jhwrr Hillary Clinton,	Just palpably evil.
@SenSchumer @SpeakerPelosi Speaker Pelosi and	Senator Schumer,		If you joined with President Obama to enact Legislation you could fix this problem as America seeks to move on.		Oh, that's right you did.		Now is your last chance to do the same with President Trump.		Act now you can both retire with dignity.
@CongressmanHice 	Congressman,	You were in the Armed Services, now you serve in a public spirited capacity.		A true patriot.		You speak the only truth on this matter which is needed.		Spkr Pelosi &amp; Sen.Schumer are 5th Columnists.		Of the worst kind.
@Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer Do you really think most Americans:	1. Believe you.	2. Think you know anything.	3. Think you are relevant.		By the time Donald Trump will have done more for the environment than you can conceive.		Imagine if your lot left him alone or helped?		Instead of talking, act to help USA.
@RudyGiuliani @dwlove9 Correct.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Charlie,	You are right.	And do you know how stupid they are.	They could have America with them.	If they followed an old saying:		If you can't beat them, join them.		They should back Trump, but they cover for Clinton's.		See my Pelosi poem. Today.
@jamesho93139786 @Jenn198523 @SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump The pun was sort of OK.	It needed a good punchline		I would dearly love Pelosi the Bat,	To hangup the gavel so that is that,	She had a chance to make it right,	To back America in this big fight,	But like the bat which hangs wrong way up,	She backed the Clinton's and f--ked it up
@jamesho93139786 	Re: Nancy Pelosi		Your description of her was suitably restrained.		Less is definitely more.		Though on her character less is less, she is an horrific human being.		Just think, being gold digger she is, that in 1970's she tried it on with Donald.		He declined.
@parscale @MaryFass3 @realDonaldTrump Great call.
@jdawsey1 	As a cigar and bourbon man, surely you must have had regard for Donald Trump's Oval Office address.
@cristinalaila1 @MaryFass3 @gatewaypundit How is that possible?
@jamesho93139786 @Jenn198523 @realDonaldTrump Agreed, along with George Washington.		Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin and like would have been run out of town on a rail.		Probably tarred and feathered too.		Can you believe it:	Not one of them has even offered a word of condolence to the Singh Family?		Thought Durbin may have		Gutless
@LoriLandRich 	You are a Texan by birth.		Then you would know the canebreaks over the Rio Grande?		That area has been being used to smuggle bootleg, guns, money, people for centuries.		Those Indian trails are old.		Now they must be closed as their use really threatens the USA.
@jamesho93139786 @Jenn198523 @realDonaldTrump James,	I believe President can act on his Authority as conveyed by Constitution.		National Security	Executive Power vested in the President on threats	1. Physical	2. Financial		The Act to.limit Exec.Power is not Amendment so does not overrule.		Jefferson would build the wall now.
@TheJordanRachel 		They are showing their win at all costs mentality.		They want the Oval Office.		To get it back they are willing to put American lives on the line.		They have done this before.		But with DT as President they are now exposed as reckless, hypocritical traitors.
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump Representative Pelosi		Lying to American Public about President Trump being passionate on National Security, does you no credit.		You told him &amp; 320 million viewers, he did not have vote in House to pass Bill, he did.		Schumer Shutdown	DNC Senate failed to give 10 votes.		Retire.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump - Wall		Simultaneously:		1. SCOTUS	File Presidential Request.	Urgent Ruling validity National Emergency.	1.1. On papers.	1.2. Be brief.	1.3. 4 pages	Issue, Threat, Fix, How		2. Declare National Emergency allowing coalescence major players.	(Army Corps Engineers)

@ILabe8 	Thank you
@PJeannieM 	Jeannie,	Thank you
@FullPricePod 	Thank you
Democratic National Congress		In the interests of National unity, stand down zealots:	Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer, Cummings, and Durbin.		They do not seek to take America forward.		Breaking covenant which introduced the GOP &amp; DNC as the two main political parties in the USA System.
@JessieJaneDuff That is so disgusting.	For that alone both of them should be forced to resign from Congress.		It is as my Father (97) WW2 veteran has often said.		Government only wants you for two reasons:	1. Fight for them.	2. Use you for their gain.		Rest of time they treat you like dirt.
@ChatByCC 	CC,	Thank you for supporting President Trump.		Donald Trump is a genuinely caring, considerate, compassionate, and courteous man, who says what he means, and means what he says.		It really is all about America.
@dbongino 	Love your message and the passion of its delivery.
@ILabe8 	Thanks Cheri
@PJeannieM 	Thank you for your tweet.
@theeleanordavis 	Eleanor,	Thank you.		Yours is always an elegant historically significant name.
@SecPompeo @denisecanady1 Secretary Pompeo,		You do great work.		Tell me, while Homeland Security has tacit control, surely with illegals crossing the USA border, that is a Federal offence, and falls into the jurisdiction of the State Department.		Mike, could you publicly support The President.
@maggieNYT Maggie,	Surely that is to his credit.
@BillHemmer @SandraSmithFox @TomPerez @marcorubio @KellyannePolls @ByronYork @SenatorLankford @RepCartwright Great Show Bill,		You always have had, well done.		Your co-host is great too!
@Mike00794195 @theeleanordavis @simonhedlin @AOC Well said.
@justonepatriot @realDonaldTrump @Cabinet @TheJusticeDept @SpeakerPelosi @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @senatemajldr @SenateGOP @SenateDems @TuckerCarlson @IngrahamAngle I have just two questions:		Is there cold turkey treatment available to rid a person of the image of Nagging Nancy Pelosi?		Do you believe extra funding is available to Congress for when Democrats have to cave to President Trump?		Reason	To buy extra tissues for Cryin' Chuck?
@AnnaApp91838450 	Anna,	Well said.
@RepMaxRose 	Support President Trump,	He will help your hopes and aspirations happen.
@scottienhughes 	Scottie,	I am a Donald Trump backer.		Keep up your good work, and always remain objective.
@cvpayne 	Charles Payne,	As an investor, multiple business owner and considered an entrepreneur,		I always love your take on business in the real world of now, and your perception with respect to the future.		You live up to your Mother's hopes and aspirations.		God Bless you.
@Tellep51jmt 		Is Hillary Dirty?	Joseph,	Thanks sarcasm is lowest form of wit.		I can not get lower than Hillary Clinton, I figure it was appropriate.		She is so dirty, it caused the death of USA Ambassador to Libya, for that death she must be charged.
@catturd2 @StorinoCarmella Tell me ----- Catturd  2,	Sorry,	I nearly forgot the 2.		Do you think that Senator Charles 'finger down the throat, with everything else, Chuck Schumer, resembles in any way a cadaver previously suffering from an anal retentive condition, known as "idiocy", or am I not cleareyed.
@Jenn198523 Do you really think so?		That's terrible.		Just imagine her anti-Semite message spread &amp; taken up by fine Democratic Leaders Pelosi &amp; Sen. Schumer.		America may be destroyed from within.		Gosh, that would be like letting thousands of illegals into USA.		Now, who'd be that stupid?
@HeatherChilders @FoxFriendsFirst @FoxNews Heather,		Great promotion.		And your smiling face and enthusiastic attitude does nothing but enhance.		Brilliant girl.
Democrat Senator Ed Markey		John Bolton	New National Security Advisor		You	President Trump is preparing for War		Sir	You are nuts.		May I suggest	Take more of the drugs your fellow Democrats will not stop crossing the Southern Border.		You	Are not fit to be in the Senate.
@realDonaldTrump @MaryFass3 Your Address was Perfect.		The American People know you are telling the truth.		Circumvent any attempt at a Court action challenging you declaring National Emergency.		SCOTUS	Go to Supreme Court for an urgent confirmation of your right to declare.		If you believe necessary.
@kayleighmcenany 	Well said.		Real facts tell the real truth.		Laterally think for a moment		How much productivity will USA lose over next 20 years given the influence drugs have on the learning ability of young people?
Sean Hannity - FOX News	Mueller not after Trump		Special Counsel Mandate:	Investigate Russian links in 2016 Presidential Elections.		President Trump knows he has done nothing wrong		Is Mueller true focus:	Hillary Clinton?	Clinton Foundation &amp; Renaissance Group?		Is Hillary dirty?
@greggutfeld @Juanita74650255 Greg,	My view		Nagging Nancy and Crying Chuck, DNC moving cadaver, who is to reprise Vincent Price's role in remake of "Thriller", at the lecturn.		I expected them to open:	"Comrades......"		They are Socialists.		More shutdowns in USA Govt history since they have been in Congress
@RealJamesWoods @jetrotter You are not into bullshit.		Did you watch the White House matter when Acosta played up.		He raised his hand to move away that young girl.		Did you see Donald.		He came from behind the lecturn, prowling, like a protective Father		Had he touched her, Donald would have flattened him
President TRUMP	Oval Office Address		Sir,	You lived up to your promise of "I can be Presidential".		Your address defeats any argument or any attempt at a Court rebuke, this is about America.		You swore to defend the United States of America.		America can be glad you do.		Sleep.
@ANDIpeaceout @Jenn198523 Andi,	You are blatantly correct.		Problem is that most do not read, nor understand the Constitution.		Nor in the touchy feely politically correct sanitized world in which we live do most realize that was written by a Nation not long from the ravages of War.		Well said.	Facts.
@chris_law_lee @Jenn198523 You need to read and actually understand the Constitution.		When I mean read, I mean read, not gloss over it.		Executive Authority is vested in the President.		He determines if a National Emergency exists:	1. Physically.	2. Financially.		Sorry you are too blind to see reality.
@RichardVeii I see.		Really raises one question I have asked for months.		What does Mueller have?		If he is honest great.		But it smells of running into re-election cycle, to what, pay back DT for Comey?		SC need time limit: 30mths	6mths setup into	18mths investigation	6mths final memorandum.
@RichardVeii @BJBradyLynch1 @gatewaypundit Mr Hannigan,	What exactly is her relevance?
@KayaJones Seems a reasonable thought.		Bring on:	Roe v Wade
Harris Faulkner - FOX		Just quietly.		You are a highly competent interviewer, and a stunning looking woman.		Well done.
@GOPChairwoman @sandyy889 @realDonaldTrump Ronna,		Correct me please if I am not up to speed.		Firstly	Since when are broadcast networks allowed to refuse any sitting Presidential direction that he needs airtime?		Second	Why do Democrats get right of reply, to a non-partisan Presidential Address.		Keep up good work.
@justyemma 		Emma,		Can you imagine Hillary saying "I'm from Govt. &amp; here to help".		Makes the spine tingle, with dread.		Not much better from:	Nancy, or GOP's moving cadaver, Cryin' Chuck.		Trump	Young people (women) in Admin. positions.	DNC	House/Senate old, too long in jobs.
@EdmundHulton @howlett_delma Yeah.	It's as Hillary said.	Just a bunch of deplorables.		Isn't nice	People vilified for their vote.	At least now so many people in USA know the Democrats view on them as a people.		Further that it continues the view espoused by Hillary.		GOP is not in trouble	DNC is near an end.
@kurteichenwald Grow up you leftist moron.		You talk about a man left a fortune who for 30 yrs has grown it 30% pa.		Major employer, successful businessman		You have done what?		How can you villify Trump, yet DNC reversed support?		Hundreds killed/yr by illegals	Thousands of children on drugs
@RepAdamSchiff Your disdain for USA which gives great privilege you enjoy disgusts me.		In Washington's era Henry as Secretary of War would have had you shot as a traitor.		President Trump can see what is coming as birthrates Sth America soar, plus harm of now.		Act to help USA.		Get some guts!
@RodStryker @chuckschumer Next Senate Election	Chuck both Chuck's out.
@DvmRobert @MsInvisibleok @DennisDMZ What an absurd question 		Golden Globes of course.		After all, they have to be able to have the safest possible environment, from which to dispense their self-righteous views on their perceived entitlements, irrespective of the callous arrogance of their arguments.
Senator Joe Manchin	Here is a classic example of a Democrat in the true sense		Unlike his colleagues	Pelosi, Schumer, Cummings, Hoyer, Durbin	he wants USA protecting action to be enacted.		Good on his courage, done with a true pioneering sense of what is right and wrong.
@Judy80981020 	Thanks Judy
@TheMarkPantano @Nikkki_R ILLEGAL DEPORTATIONS	I can not support your point that illegals can not be deported from USA in large numbers.		1997-1998, I lived in Muslim Malaysia, when Prime Minister Mahathir ordered deportation of 893,000 overstaying illegal Muslims home to Indonesia.		Hired cruise ships.
Michelle Malkin	You have a beautiful mouth and it looks even more magnificent, when you use it for a just cause.		No matter the lens the Wall is looked at through:	1. Security 	2. Illegals cost to USA.	3. USA Border Guards relief.		No argument can be made against building it.
President TRUMP		Democrats 	Demand equal broadcasting time.		Following your address.		Have they lost their minds.		Yours is a non-partisan address from the White House.		How do Democrats get the right of reply?		They do not .		There is no provision for a right of reply.		None.
President Trump		Your Emergency Declaration		Understand the Constitution.		Vests Executive Power in the 	 President		USA Supreme Court	Has no power to intervene		National Security	Your call at your discretion	You are President not SCOTUS.		Then Get Some Sleep 	Take a day, do it.
President TRUMP		Donald John Trump		Sir,		You have a case to make.		You tell the American People		Leave them in no doubt of	1. Facts.	2. Who is boss.	3. What you authorize.		I do not know an argument.		Drugs alone kill productivity.		Costs kill the USA economy.		God Bless you.
@Jenn198523 @ejabel2 USA Constitutional Republic	System democratic process of electing State &amp; Federal.		Sharia Law	Has NO place in the USA.		I pray Oath of Allegiance of the new Democrat Member if Congress fully understood, as official penalty for Treason in USA is death.		Irrespective of Office.
@BoxingLifeLong Mattis		It is true &amp; marks the true character of President Trump.		He loves military, did not serve &amp; believe he wishes for 2 lives, where he would have, so respects.		For his service he gave Mattis the dignity of carrying his colours from the field.		2020 DT must be re-elected.
@megrod2778 	Thanks Maggie
@Liz_Cheney 	Love what your doing, the decency you stand for, how you express yourself and what hopefully will be the positive results for the USA with respect to any issue on which you have input.		To you and yours have a very Happy and Prosperous New Year.		God Bless
@charliekirk11 USA SENATE		Charlie Kirk		Can you publish a list of the names of all the Senators up for re-election in 2020?		Nice to know who to support and who to forget.
@DavidShaneMcD Well done.	Great sense of humour.	Keep in touch.
@DavidShaneMcD David,	Not so much animals, I am not of your persuasion, but doubtless find it difficult to be angry with a ball of fur called an opposum, unless he scratches.		But our native bird the Kiwi may be to your liking, though do not bend over, his long nose could be a pain in the ass.

FOX News - Steve Hilton		Absolutely brilliant.		Do you know straw to break camel's back?		Mattis	Gave Order in nuclear strike, he told before POTUS ending POTUS Chain of Command right to Order 1st Strike Response.		Mattis	Did this with DNC.	Placed all Americans at risk		Treason.

Trump vs Democrats		Q	Is it more simple?		GOP	1. Lincoln freed slaves	2. African Americans	2.1 1st in Congress.	2.2 Lowest A/A U/E 50 yrs		DNC	Follow don't lead.		Missing	Female POTUS		Trump good Ivanka win 2024	Q:	Anti-Trump ruins her bid?		Why	For Democrats.		Motive	Jealousy
MSNBC	Kasie - DC		For allowing guests to laugh or snigger over anything to do with 9/11/2001.		This is the largest attack on USA soil in history.		Kasie should be:	1. Sacked.	2. Banned from broadcasting.
Terrorism - USA Border		MSNBC - Kasie DC	Today	Raised 9/11/2001.		Guests Sniggered	On terrorists being in planes.		Fact	Over 2,900 people died.		Additional Fact	Terrorists need to succeed only once.		Border 	As terrorist entry point - low		President Trump	Prevention now best cure
@SfcDrill @DeeGR8whiteluvr @FaceTheNation @LindseyGrahamSC Absolutely.	But they are Democrats and they know it all.		Maybe we could tax the "tippy top" of Pelosi, Schumer, Cummings, Hoyer, and Tricky Dicky Durbin salaries to help pay for.....anything.		Wait for the tax increases.
President Trump 	Reopening Govt		Democrat Deception	POTUS signs Bills only Dept unfunded Homeland Security		Big Issue	President Clinton to zero deficit slashed intelligence community budget.		Result	9/11/2001		Questions	Does USA trust Democrats on security? 	Is this Dem coverup?
@rick19936479 @Jenn198523 You support thought?
@Tim_Poole_ 	Thanks Tim.	You are an ex-coach, planner	Surely right order critical?	Thanks
Rep. David Cicciline (D-RI).		Do you know more than US Border Guards on walls?		How can you claim resolving wall dispute if Bills ending shutdown signed, when Pelosi/Schumer oppose?		Will Democrats sign contract to provide USD$5.6Bn if he signs those bills &amp; reopen Government?
@smokeygotarat 	Very clever.
Fox News - Chris Wallace		Question	Is that man a journalist?		Or:	Is he a Democrat apologist?		Can	He fight as hard for the USA.	As he opposes POTUS.
@Tammyking16 @ReneeMcCone Well said.	Chuck Schumer will only cry genuinely twice:	1. Voted out of Senate.	2. No pay.
USA Border Security		USA must ramp up securing borders of all 48 contiguous States.	Cost may be USD$100Bn.		Democrats	As usual have issue wrong way around.		Order	1. Secure ALL the borders including Points of Entry.	2. Comprehensive Immigration Reform.		USA	House in order first.
@DanCrenshawTX Rep. Crenshaw	Best of good luck in the continuation of your service to greatest most generous country in world history.		I ripped into Paul Krugman, two weeks ago, he is far too negative, gained prominence post-GFC.		Non-problem solving reflectionist.		Look forward to your career
@bethanyferg1 	Thank you
@Jim_Jordan @Stephaniec7257 Rep. Jordan.		DT can use Emergency powers.		Schiff as usual uninformed.		President Truman	Could not use Emergency Powers as it was wartime &amp; Act having precedence was	War Powers Act.		It is peacetime 2019.	Executive Authority vested in The President.		Good luck
Democrats Lecturing USA		Rep. Steny Hoyer.		You have been in Congress for years, why do you not follow Constitution?		You said, you want Senator Mitch McConnell to act as you dictate.		Sonny,	He is Senator, you are not.		He &amp; GOP	Can act as they choose to, as elected to Office
@RoscoVandusen 	You have a very interesting background, and a unique set of skills.
@BernardKerik @HeatherChilders @realDonaldTrump @USNavy President Trump	Can not halt a military court martial in peacetime.	(No War Powers Act invoked)		If warranted he can pardon.		Military must be praised, as they have moved to military hearing ASAP to ensure over by end of Trump 1st Term		Democrsts will not pardon	They will execute
@RepAdamSchiff You are wrong.		Read Constitution.		Comparison is a non-starter.		Democratic Party supported wall USA Border Guards want for years.		Rep. Schiff,	A lie is a lie.		Congressional Records show your fellow Democrats are turncoat liars, and throw under a bus America safety.		Resign.
@realDonaldTrump 		Order to protect the Border.
@realDonaldTrump Did you like my poem and hook line.
@tommyhedrick Did you get it.		Then take her to the House Disciplinary Committee for financial misdemeanour.		Providing funds in conflict with a current voting position.		It is not the amount of USD$ it is that it is a financial consideration.		I hope you have her a receipt.		Well done.
@tommyhedrick Brilliant.
@BillKristol Constitutional crisis?		Rubbish.		You have not read Constitution.		The President has absolute jurisdiction over threats to USA	1. Physical security.	2. Financial security.		The Constitution vests Executive Power in The Office of The President of the United States of America
@SenSchumer Senator Schumer,		You were elected to:		Uphold the Constitution.	Protect the USA from all threats foreign &amp; domestic.		A killed Police Officer sworn like you, to protect &amp; serve was buried yesterday.		To honour him &amp; others dead due to illegals you argue semantics and do nothing.
President Trump.		My apologies for asking you,	As your workload is so high,	You let Dem's choose a path,	They said no, so time is nigh		For you to make the Call,	To Order building the Wall,	Voters will not let you fall,	As that act protects them all.		Order to Protect the Border.
@MarianneLockri1 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Thank you for your tweet.		President Trump has given the Democrats opportunities to act in the best interests of the USA, now they are acting in a treasonous manner to put USA citizens at an avoidable risk.		Time to Order if they fail to agree.		Thank you again.		God Bless.
@AOC Do you think you are leading a Spanish-Mexican hidalgo reverse takeover of USA.		You need to realize you are in USA Congress, and do some productive work.		I know you still think you own Los Angeles founded by 9 hidalgo families.		Forget about it.		Leave 45 alone		Pass Good Law.
President TRUMP	Govt Shutdown - Wall		Pull thorn from lion's paw.		Instruct McConnell deliver all Bills excluding Homeland Security &amp; CR to White House.		Sign all but CR-HS Bill.		Time to deflate Democrats.		After 8 years with Obama for Democrats to moralize over you is pathetic.

USA Border Wall - Trump		Surveys by Networks.		Can you raise sample size of your Surveys on support/not		Suggest:	1. All Southern States.	2. Size = 10,000 each State.	3. Ratio = 50% Urban/Rural		Ca., Tx., NM, Az., Ne., La., Ar., Al., Mo., MS., Florida.
@justonepatriot 	Thanks Patti
President TRUMP		If Democrats do not agree to fund the Wall.		Order it.		Further, your decision at your sole discretion.		They can not apply to Court for injunction.		Not up for debate.		You are President.		Constitution	Vests Executive Authority in the Office of the President.
@charliekirk11 You are right.	But think on this.	If if 22 million illegals say 14 were deported.	Wages would go up, job opportunities would increase, job training would upskill many unskilled.	Yes I know labor is needed but unpaid tax, crime, drugs, are funding USA debt	Drugs = non productivity
@smoss319 	Direct Message me please

@smoss319 Donald is a master yes.	I known since 1995, b4 you.		You do not get it.		Congressional Rules stand, legally set precedence, DNC  ranks full of lawyers.		Every step through to Am.25 is being tried by them, incl:	Taking from him Chain of Command.		Mattis ordered it, sacked.
@realDonaldTrump President TRUMP		Democrats are just Stupid		You know I have advocated use of National Emergency provision of Constitution to build the Wall.		Now Democrats say Courts will declare it illegal.		They Do Not Get It.		Executive Power is vested in you only.		Decision is yours alone.

@CannellRichard 	Thanks Richard,	He has gone hasn't he.	Such a shame, very good.	You take care.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Rep. Lieu.		You forget USA Law.		Constitution vests Executive Power in the President.		As no foreign deployment,	President Trump does not require Congressional or Judicial oversight.		If, President holds USA:	1. Physical security	2. Financial security	is threatened:		He can act.
@RepAdamSchiff Rep. Schiff		You are an idiot.		Difference b/w him &amp; you:		1. He does not lay out working papers.	He outlines problem and solution and is impatient.		2. You lack the brains to see the architecture of the solution.		He created skyscrapers, big buildings.		You create headaches.

@ManeBlonde @RWR1776 @suzydymna No I do not.	I think she is what used to be called a 5th Columnist.
@theeleanordavis 	Thanks Eleanor.
@DoingRight1 	Thank you, DT is trying hard.		Funny to watch when he is dealing with the laptop using briefcase carrying paper shufflers, reporters.		He is practical, they do not have a clue.
@ManeBlonde @RWR1776 @suzydymna You are right.	One rule DNC.	Crazy.
@MaryFass3 	Thank you Mary.	He needs some prayers
@RWR1776 @suzydymna @ManeBlonde True.		But it still does not obfuscate her legal obligations with respect to the Oath of Allegiance.		Next she will be put on the	Ways &amp; Means	Intelligence	Committees.
@suzydymna @ManeBlonde Question	Oath of Office specifically forbids dual allegiance.		How did she make it past a screening process?
@charliekirk11 New Congressional Rules		Look hard before comment or act.		DNC	Seek to elevate Congress to same status as Office of President.		Constitution	Vests Executive Power in Office of President.		SCOTUS	Needs to void Rules or he loses Executive Control.		See my tweet	Act please.	DNC game
President TRUMP		URGENT ----- URGENT		New Congressional Rules		Supreme Court review/void.		New Rules	Seek to elevate status of Congress to equal footing your Office.		You Do Not Act	You lose Executive Control.		SCOTUS	Must review &amp; void as Unconstitutional.		Beware DNC diversions
President TRUMP	The White House Garden address was brilliant.		No other President in my life has taken so much time to be forthcoming.		You set out your agenda, and ticked off boxes incl:	Pa. farmers voting Russian.		You were in command &amp; restrained.		After all this Proposal 8E.
@GOPChairwoman Ronna,	You have had busy week.		You are staunch.		JOBS	Tell me surely, given time.of year, NO way Dems can criticize those numbers.		Ultimately	These are Americans with jobs. Unless they want a "deplorable" Hillary moment alienating voters.		This must win Donald 2020.
@livingforyah 	Good on you Susan
President TRUMP		Swore Defend Constitution.		New Rules 	Pelosi claim Congress equal your Office		Constitution	Vests Executive Authority Office of President		SCOTUS	Ask they void Rules as violate Constitution.		Or	DNC usurp your power 2019-2020.		SCOTUS	Sworn uphold Constitution.
@GovMikeHuckabee @Richieamx @realDonaldTrump Good on you Governor.		Too many untruths being told against Donald.		Do I trust him,	With my life.		Do I trust Pelosi	Never.		Carry on Governor.
@Jenn198523 You should be in bed.	Mine.	Lol.
@charliekirk11 Charlie,	The spite the USA is to see from Democratic enquiries which sees them blunt the edge of President Trump for his 4 year Term just to cover up the dishonesty of Hillary and Senior Democrats.		Donald Trump is the only one who is honest.		All of them are corrupt.		2020 Trump
@realDonaldTrump 		President TRUMP		Break the WALL Deadlock		Use the Constitution.		Congress has recessed to Tuesday next week.		At tomorrow's meeting with Pelosi &amp; Schumer, advise if no funds for wall you will:		1. Sign Bills but not CR/Homeland		2. Adjourn Congress for 6 months
@newtgingrich 	Wish you had the gavel.		Then Donald could get back to being President, the nit pickers could go, uncertainty in the stocks would evaporate, and critically China would see he is in charge without ambiguity 		As they see things through their lens only.		Take care.

@ajsrun1 	Hi Andrew,	Will not be surprised, so will not waste words.	Pelosi us an absolute fraud but due to her position and support from Head DNC hatchetman Steny Hoyer, she is very dangerous.	And cold.
@DavidPiepho 	Thanks David
@DOlivr 	Thanks
@Riskographer2 	Great name, appropriate,	Did you see DT's brochure front page "wall is coming".		He is making the Democrats look like old fuddie duddies.		Take care.		Keep in touch.		I may need some advice.
@realDonaldTrump @MAZINGERZMBA Briefing Room 		Tactically brilliant.		On a day when symbolism was with Nancy regaining the gavel.		You put it front and centre with real experts, that just like her prior claim you did not have votes in House &amp; you did; experts tell USA, walls work.		Unfunded	Democrats own it.

President TRUMP	Already Speaker Pelosi has told Congress it is co-equal with Presidential &amp; Judicial branches.		Constitution states clearly it vests Executive Power in The Office of the President.		She will attempt in effect a boardroom coup to usurp  your authority.		Be safe.
Pelosi Speaker - What Cost?	Yet again Pelosi is Speaker.		Standing beside outgoing Speaker McCarthy she basks in her victory, not the majesty of Congress.		For sake of USA and world one hopes her profligate zealousness drive to attain power matches a performance benefitting USA.
@FiveRights @caselvis58 Obama, with full support and help from,	Clinton's, Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin, Cummings, Hoyer.
@Jenn198523 	Thank you for your tweet.
Representative Cortez	Are you related to Hernan Cortes?	Distribution both names remarkably similar.		Did Family split due to mass murder he carried out on Aztecs?		He came from Medellin Spain, same name as infamous drug gang in Mexico.		Do you seek USA Presidency?		You will not.
President TRUMP	Breaking WALL Debate		24/48 contiguous States Sanctuary or offer same.		USA Law - Equitable Liability	Sanctuary locations bear cost of illegals offending in non-sanctuary areas.		Interstate = Federal		Ca., In serious deficit must fund Arizona border length	Barrier
Stock Market Drop - Trump	APPLE share price dropping due to lack of sales in China.	Chinese economy is slowing	CRITICS	Due China/USA trade issues	Not war yet.	CORE ISSUES	USA - Economy $23Tn	USA - POTUS focus not Apple	China gauging USA for years	PROBLEM	Dem's create instability.
@realDonaldTrump You are right.	Time to get tough.	Order Pelosi to White House.	Have at her over insults.		That security of USA being hung out to dry as Pelosi not liking word wall is nonsense		Clearly while senile, Democrat recalcitrance is impacting USA life.		Tell McConnell use Nuclear Option.
@BambiNevada Yes it is.	Well done.	Please keep in touch.
President Trump's Son		USA News Media		Some USA news media are running stories on Barron Trump, youngest son of the President.		THIS IS DISGRACEFUL		There is no possible excuse for bringing a child into any of this &amp; esp. one who has not even attained a majority.		Try decency.
@BambiNevada 	Thanks Bambi,	Can we point your sarcasm skills at Nancy and co.	Happy New Year
@bud_cann @IBURSp Islamic Belief Structure	That is why any person who wishes to enter USA as a legal migrant, should as part of their character test, when they tick a faith box, be required to define certain key beliefs, like that.	If a belief, denied, no excuse.
@GOPChairwoman Trump &amp; Women		Ronna		You, Kelly-Ann, Gov. Haley, Ivanka &amp; so many competent women on Trump Team.		Level of responsibility he gives to women &amp; interaction puts to rest claim of misunderstanding fairer sex.		Bottom line	Donald Trump loves &amp; respects women, and proves it every day.
Mitch ROMNEY		Forget him.	Failed candidate, freshman Senator.		USA rcan not afford to be dragged into minefield Democrats &amp; Romney trying to create.		They want 2020 campaign to start now.		Trump wants USA up &amp; running.		Ignore Romney, unless you do not love your country.		Focus.
@JohnSmi17656293 	Thanks John,	Nice to hear Conway.	Totally a-political.	Just the facts with a ton of passion.
President TRUMP	Re: Pelosi - Get Tough.		White House - Exec.Power	1. You Order Pelosi there.	2. She must obey even if Speaker.	3. Direction so WH MTG is legal proceeding.	4. Direct Sec.HS table facts	5. Pelosi must listen or jail 30 days for contempt		She would do it to you.
@HeatherChilders 	Thank you.
Kelly Anne Conway - FOX		Brilliant.		You are right on all fronts.	Classic example of:		1. Trump loyalty to you.	2. Your loyalty to him.		Only person selling message better than you is Donald Trump.		Albeit two Mikes do great (Pence, Pompeo).		Sanctuary Laws must go!		God Bless.

@chrisappeh1 	Agree with your sentiment completely.	Happy New Year.
@RudyGiuliani @UsLiberate I too have said comparison is fair.		Float, guilty, hauled out, burned at stake.	Sink, drown, innocent.		Same result, dead.		Rudy,	Christchurch, NZ, post quakes we had a Mayor, who calmed all.		You did that, NY, 2001, I lost girl I loved.		Protect Donald.	Ask for help.		God Bless
@IvankaTrump 		Happy New Year.		2019, will be a year unlike any previously in your life.		Hardly fair, given all the good work you have been doing.		Democrats &amp; their support will try every dirty trick to have a go at you.		Trust your Family rely on Dad.		2020 will deal with DNC.
@jairbolsonaro 	Excellente, Bravo.		In English.		Congratulations.		Your victory, can uplift Brazil, your difficulties will be many.		Reach out around the world, for true friends for pillars on which Brazil can rely.		Clearly Donald Trump is &amp; if you are honest, so is my family.
@kimguilfoyle 	Kimberley		I do not know what went on at FOX.		That is your business.		But in the ratings dependent media industry, protecting a visually appealing, competent one, i would have thought essential.		And I have known the Murdoch's from Toorak, Melbourne, for decades.
@rolandscahill 	You are a Calvinist.		Welcome.		I am the Eldest Son in my Family, and the Direct descendant of John Knox.		Do you foil, epee, or sabre?
Neil Cavuto - FOX News		Debt USD$22Tn	You are right.	Now cuts into Govt funds for: Social, Defence, Health spending.		TRUMP	Deficit up 2018:	Buffer to avoid GFC2.		DEMOCRATS	Stop Trump zeroing deficit:	Savings	Wall = USD$200Bn	USMCA = $100Bn	Syria = $20Bn	Afghanistan = $80Bn
President TRUMP - Kanye West 	FOX - Shephard Smith		Disgusted your China to Kanye remark.		FOX	Kanye 150 million registered followers		Exceeds total viewers Fox.		Who more influential?		MATTIS	Guilty	Interfered with POTUS right of reply to 1st strike nuclear attack.	Treason
@TheJordanRachel Raised.	He is a loser.		Just remember his religion.		Take the m out.	Says it all.
@JustMyStyle101	You do good work.
@SheriffClarke 	President Trump - Wall		What is your position?		Realize you must be careful.		Question	Illegals try 24/7/365 to cross border.		Budget - no funds to be full strength 24/7/365.		Wall must provide barrier &amp; relief, to overworked staff.		Yes / No		Keep safe		Thank you
@CBSNews Trump Wall Money		Why would he tell?		Stud Poker	Do you tell your opponents the cards in your hand?		Even Democrats are not that dumb.		President Trump far from it.
@TomiLahren Tomi,	As I have tweeted 		No such thing as a coincidence in politics.		This riot out if the blue exactly on the eve of DNC regaining control of the House.		Remember at MidTerms the caravan also a pivotal issue, timed to coincide.		Two coincidences, no.		Planned.		Treason.
China - Taiwan Unification		President Xi	1. Chinese never attack Chinese.	2. Reunification based on One Party Two System		Fact	3. President Xi also said all options including military force remain	4. Hong Kong	One Party Two System method not even fair elections		China loses face.
@TheNotoriousMMA 	You got whipped when you fought Mayweather.		My Father won 2 Gold's at the WW2 Armed Svs Championship, Cairo, before El Alamein.		Said Marciano best he saw, Mayweather close.		Conor,	Take it like a man, admit better man got you then move on		Irish not bad sports
@realDonaldTrump @thorntreehill President Trump.		You poor chap.		I know you like visible action		Unfortunately, your reward is largely going to be in history books.		One Saving Grace:	Pelosi, Schumer, Romney, Comey etc...		Will be footnotes to the core article featuring you as an absolute vindicated winner.
Marc Thiessen		Love your attitude and your review of President Trump.		Agree Pelosi right now can give him his wall funds, and get concessions in return.		Key Problem	You state ISIS not defeated, has USD$400million.		How do you know?		If true, USA has since WW2, power to seize.
USA Sec. of State Pompeo		Russians seize USA citizen Paul Whelan		Charge	Spying		Whelan Employer	Borg Warner		Core Business	Transmission reduction gear		Core Use	Shipping (military, cruise liners, commercial, superyachts)		View	Putin retires 2024.	Power conflict with oligarch.
President TRUMP - WALL		Why can't opponents get it!		USA Border Guards want &amp; need a Wall.		Why.	24 hours every day illegal immigrants assail border		Guards	Budgets do not staff 24 hrs.	Wall provides them relief.	Easier to repel illegals.		Beaurocrats don't get it.	You do.
@AriFleischer 	Mr Fleischer,	As an independent observer, I have never for a moment doubted your intelligence or commonsense.		To you and your loved ones, have a Happy, Safe, and very Prosperous New Year.		Hold onto your hat.		2019 will be many 8 second rodeo rides in one year.
@Jim_Jordan @MZHemingway Yes.
President Trump - ALERT		What Do Democrats Want		What gets you funds if any.		1. MidTerms - Key issue.	2. House h/over - Key issue.		The Caravan		Democrats want you to allow caravan in.		To rub your nose in it		The Ultimate Back down.		To humiliate you.		Tell them to get stuffed.
President Trump - ALERT		USA Border Troubles - 1 Day Before Dem's Take House		SIR	NO such thing, coincidence in politics.		USA has best technical &amp; grassroots investigators.		Someone with DNC paid this to happen.		FBI to Mexico, grill all rioters, find out who.		JAIL FOR LIFE.
@realDonaldTrump 	Stay in the offensive.		Albeit the most offensive are Democrats like Schumer and Pelosi.		Watch your back.		2020 Democrats lose big.		Please Publish List Of:	Senators up for election	2020.		Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump @SusanSt08942260 President Trump		Schumer delaying approvals		Precedent rules in Law.		In handbook does direction exist on 'reasonable' delay?		As peacetime, this longest delay, can not be reasonable		As Executive Power vested in you can you confirm appts w/out recourse?		Due to unreasonableness.
@Jenn198523 	You need to be loved.	Often.	By me.
@NeilFinn God Bless You Neil
@dcrow_baby @Briteeye777 Absolutely.	But it is great theatrics.		Then a hand comes up to the forehead of Pelosi, and she says:	Oh my God, Mr President:	What a big beautiful wall you have.		He can play them at their own game, but what about Dems helping to fix:	Immigration	Debt	Healthcare		Thanks Deanna.
@Jenn198523 	Really,	I am overwhelmed with joy 	Happy Festive Season.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Rep. Pelosi		You repeatedly criticized this President for using Twitter yet you have an account.		Now you may end shutdown your Party created.		Then launch inane enquiries to discover nothing.		Obamacare needs replacing, Debt repaid, border security must be fixed.		Do your job.
@Briteeye777 @dcrow_baby President Trump 		Paying for the Wall.		Forgive me a dumb question		You renegotiated NAFTA.	Cornerstone Legislation.		USA savings over US$100Bn per year.		Can precedence provide you access to savings to pay for wall?		NB: 	You have power to time assessments on savings, monthly
@ARmastrangelo @dcrow_baby Alana,	Surely this is a good aspiration?		Do you agree?

@realDonaldTrump Ms Pelosi &amp; Crying Chuck would not give you credit for a newspaper.		USA slowly moving in behind you, those not there.		You must look carefully at Executive Power.		You can adjourn Congress at will. If they are going to slow down your agenda, revenge for Bill send Congress home.
President Trump 2019		Fox News Live	Inexperienced Show Hosts		Biggest 2019 drama for President Trump is delay Schumer has instigated for approving 360 Departmental Heads &amp; key staff.		This not in best interests of USA giving Russia &amp; China chance to make huge gains against USA.
@charliekirk11 Gee Charlie,		You do not pull punches.		Well said.		To any Democrat supporter determined to have a crack at President Donald Trump.		In respect to his achievements and work ethic, they should remember a very old saying:	"There are none so blind as they who shall not see".		Crazy.
@thehill Key = Barack Obama	For good of country he must come to White House with Michelle.		Listen to Donald, endorse US$5.7bn &amp; tell Nancy &amp; Chuck to not oppose it for good of country.		Quid Pro Quo	DT concedes Obama helped economy: BO - Trump turbo avoided GFC2.		No games, people dying
@BarackObama 		When you were voted into Office you were the great new hope.		An untried experiment, yet for me fitting reward for African American people who have served USA with distinction.		Honour your history, Donald has his hand out to you, take it &amp; unify the USA.		Together
@BarackObama Stepped up how Barack?		Democrats not fighting for USA, but for ideology saying President incompetent.		Deep down	You know that is false.		You know what he has done.		Sure some is down to you, but his turbo boost of economy, stopped Dow being 20,000 &amp; dropping to 12,000.		= GFC2
@FLOTUS Happy New Year 	To you girl.		You are without doubt Donald's biggest asset.		Sometimes doubtless, he has to be reminded.		You champion causes that endear you to decent folks.		When Donald is re-elected in 2020 above the frey, you are one reason he will be.		God Bless to you both.

@Jenn198523 	Thank you for your tweet.	Love your support.
@SteveScalise @SusanSt08942260 Rep. Scalise,	Forgive me asking an obvious question.		How can the stopping of these "queue jumping" illegal immigrants, be anything other than in the best interests of the USA.		Can you publish list of the Democrat Senators who are up for re-election 2020?		Then GOP has 60 votes.
@RichardVeii 		Mr Hannigan,		Have a Happy New Year.		2019, us a year in which you should thrive.		Doubtless the destructive nature of the Democrats will be to the fore.		Their attitude, to hell with the economic security of 401K's and USA business.		2020 vote Democrats out.
@BattleBornThom @MyTeresadampier Elizabeth Warren		With no Indian blood little Pocohontas can not join Sitting Bull.		So she must stand with Custer.		Her last stand, like his.		Do we learn if her Exploratory Committee tells her, don't be stupid.		No Indian blood, maybe:	Elizabeth Warren is Chinese.		Che che
@Rvndave @CNN That is the solution.		They have NO interest in helping America advance.		It is like watching a drama on Police on TV.		When storyline for show gets weaker, in a vain attempt to boost audience interest they investigate themselves.		Series cancelled.		Cancel the Democrats 2020.
@Jenn198523 @JustMyStyle101 USA State Sanctuary Laws		Question 	Why can Law Enforcement not override this law?		Issue	This protects illegals in some cities.		Problem	ICE complains can't act.		Solution	Use FBI		Reason	Illegals crossing borders commit a federal offence.		Jurisdiction	FBI		Referral	Hand to ICE
@RealJamesWoods @POTUS That is not a bad suggestion		That puts a stamp on the issue and throws down the gauntlet to Democrats.		POTUS may wish to avoid Officer Singh's dignity and memory being politicizes.		But, I guess it is already.
@realDonaldTrump @teamnettles President Trump		The same to you.		You deserve it.
@ABC She was a cleptomaniac.	She wanted to keep it.	So cut it off.		Adds whole new dimension,	To closer relations,	And to him also.
@Nigel_Farage @teamnettles You need to be back in the political game.		You would get re-elected with an overwhelming majority, sufficient to get you into 10 Downing Street.		Donald will be re-elected but remember, there is trouble due with Russian power struggles as Putin leaves 2024.		UK needs you, do it.
@NeilFinn Neil,	To you, your Family, Tim and his Family,	Happy New Year,	Thanks for the music.	You are always consistently lifting your game, well done.		Wish your new band members, Happy New Year from me, and ask Stephanie if I may contact, Dennis, Glen, and Rob Light,	on a biz proposal.
@JackPosobiec @Actibonnie Yeah disgraceful,		They have no respect for the sovereignty of America, nor of protecting her people.		Maybe William Barr will act.		She committed treason.		Jack,	Happy Festive Season and a Prosperous New Year.
@teamnettles 	Not a bad birthday present.	Tweet Donald 	Yours is an unusual birthday.	You may get a birthday tweet from the man.	He does care about people.		That's what Democrats do not get.
@realDonaldTrump @teamnettles President Trump,		You are right.		Carry on.		To you, your lovely wife, and the best looking family to be in The White House,	Happy New Year.

Badly in debt, Bill says State to be charged all costs.		In other words		Unlimited illegal entry.	Taxpayer pays.		Future	High taxes to pay costs		Wrong
@AmyMek @JANIGAYL Open Entry For Refugees	Germany	Given your comment is on the Open Border policy of Merkel which let in 1 million.		How is		USA	No hard border + Sanctuary Cities		Any different in outcome:	Given death of Officer Singh and others?
Cash rate
President Trump		USA Media Malware Attack.		Send Mike Pompeo to North Korea to get assurances not them		If no, cut talks.	Call in Powell advise him he must in SWAT analysis have regard to geo-political risk before raising cash risk, lest USA economy stalls.		Domestic = 68% of GDP
President Trump - WALL		President Trump	Mexico will pay for the Wall.		Democrats	Why ask us for $5.7Bn?		Reality	Trump redrafted NAFTA		Democrats	You can't.		Trump	He did.		USA Savings	Over $100Bn per year.		Wall US$5.7Bn	Interim seed funding		Liberals	Think laterally.		Grow up.

@Chris_1791 	Happy New Year.	For your courage, brilliant.
@BillKristol Trump Presidency		Bill Kristol		The only wishful thinking is your irrational thought.		Donald John Trump will be re-elected in a Landslide.		Democrats 	Can walk to Congress &amp; give him Senate vote for the Wall.		It is hard to walk in one leg.		Reason	Other foot is in their mouth.
@Jenn198523 	Thank you for your wish.

What I learned at work this year https://t.co/NTOf1nqBQ5 via @billgates
@Jenn198523 	You did not ask me what the deal was you saw DM then got mad.
@Jenn198523 Well done.		Read my emails (x2) please.		DM me.
@alfranken You resigned in a cloud of disgrace.	You should stay out of casting aspersions on other people.	You do not have a moral right.	Join Nancy hiding in Hawaii
@LeoDiCaprio 	Long time since Rastes, Llam Phroa, Yacht Haven, Phi Phi Island, The Beach.		You have done well.		Leo, I am sending Proposal 8E: 2019-2029 to White House January 2019.		Employs 30m Americans, w/wide application, revamps energy, zero emissions.		Want to help?	DM me.
@Jenn198523 	Simple.	Marry me please.
@Jenn198523 	You have mail you should read.	Both DM and Email.	You want me to say it out loud.	What I did was wrong, it was bad judgement, and I am sorry.	The ladies had all had:	1. Cancer.	2. Attacks they survived.	I thought DM more private.	I do love you.	Read the emails (X2).
@realDonaldTrump @JesseBWatters You are The President of the United States of America.		Executive Power is vested in you.		You are not maliciously vindictive.		Right now you need to give all of them a metaphorical kick in the teeth.		Exercise your power if due cause, have Secret Service arrest them for treason.
@realDonaldTrump @MajJohnCClark Build The Border Wall.		Donald, as usual your gut is right.		Aside from being a known identifiable physical barrier, it is a deterrent.		Like a flu jab. 		Have you a deterrent for pesky Democrats?
@DGazump Difference between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau.	One is a pencil head, laptop using, briefcase carrying, holier than thou f/wit.		Then there is Donald Trump.		Builds things, super practical so smart averaged 30% pa growth in his inheritance for 30 years.		Knows how to connect.
@roddfarrell 	You are amazing.	DM me please for a deal.
@Kimber15065649 DM me please.

@MZHemingway 	Mollie,	Remember you when you first came to FOX 		You have proven yourself a valued, rational thinking, get for the FOX Team 		Happy FestivebSeason
@realDonaldTrump Hello Donald,		Understand China is moving forward.		Personal relationships count		Is Barack Obama in Hawaii?		With Nancy Pelosi?		They seek to have at you.	Yet have nothing on you.	As there is nothing.		Crazy, McCarthyism in 2019.		God Bless You and your Family.
Fox News 2019 in USA	Business pundit = recession		Crazy		USA just dodged 10 Year cyclical market collapse.		1st time in 40 years (1987)		Why so many negative.		72% USA economy domestic		No reliance on OPEC oil.		China needs USD$ Foreign Direct Investment to thrive.		Trump right.
NANCY PELOSI in Hawaii	Real Reason		Pelosi in Hawaii to see Obama.		Pelosi to push enquiries into Trump 	(After he offered her votes to make her Speaker).		Pelosi needs to clear up/or coverup, how Obama gave Iran USD$150Bn of USA taxpayer funds.		What influence Hillary had.
Nancy Pelosi out of Congress		Imagine Paul Revere yelling "the British are coming"		And:	George Washington saying:	"I'm going on holiday".		Nancy Pelosi	Says to all Americans, not just the 25% unfunded Government workers.	"I do not care about you, any of you"		POTUS sits waits.
@GOPChairwoman @gpnavonod @realDonaldTrump Ronna,		To you and your loved ones, have a Happy Festive Season.		Re-electing Donald Trump in 2020 is an absolute imperative.		He is the real deal, but then I have known that since 1995.		Given the Democrats have been relentless in their attacks on him, you must be resolute.
@SandraSmithFox 		Hi Sandra,		Thank you for courtesy your tweet.		You do great work in face of human cruelty &amp; stupidity.		Morocco &amp; Officer Singh 5mth old baby, examples of that.		How you keep composed is to your great credit.		Watch for 8E 2019.	DM me.		Happy Festive Season
@HeatherChilders 		Heather,	Notice you are a Carolina girl.		Just a thought.		If Rhett Butler were real, and alive, I can guarantee where you are concerned, he would definitely have 'given a damn".		Any Southern Gent would.		Take care, have a great Festive Season, get fit.		DM me
@HeatherChilders 		Hi,		Thank you for your tweet.		Gosh, this time of year it is good to reflect:	1. On what you have done, not just for you, but others.	2. Count your blessings for being lucky enough to meet some no longer among us.		You are beautiful,	DM me.		God Bless you.
@STEPHMHAMILL 	Hi Stephanie,	Thank you for your tweet.	Follow you.	Love the way you think 	DM me if you wish 	Happy Festive Season.
@The_Trump_Train It is called gutless.		Much better having a President who calls it the way it is.		Difference between theorist and realist.		Nagging Nancy is past her used by date.		So much promise 	Such a shame.	Useless.
@TheJordanRachel @dcrow_baby @realDonaldTrump Yes
@realannapaulina @SusanSt08942260 I have seen few people look so gorgeous when they are ticked off.		How stunning are you when you are seriously angry.		Happy Festive Season.		Go Donald.	Go USA.
@agapaoflower 	When Officer Singh was shot I did not know there was a fund so I tweeted that as a suggestion.		Since then I have had a thousand respond saying a good idea.		Clearly most people do not know one exists, I thought if you put access details to me people see and give
@agapaoflower 	Great Sam,	I suggested it on hearing, and the response has been overwhelming, so that is good.		Can you advise me the exact details so it will go to all the people following me, and people will see it publicly.		Thanks Sam.
@Chris_1791 @FoxNews How did that happen?		She looks in great health.		God Bless.
@charliekirk11 Charlie,	It is called hypocrisy.		One of worst aspects of this dispute, is mindless referral by Democrats to who owns shutdown.		Who cares.		But instead of fixing it, Democrats scatter.		In 2020, I pray voter gives President Trump an absolute controlling majority in both Houses.
@CB618444 Laughable.
@CB618444 	CATIA,	I wish you a very Happy New Year.		You are a cancer survivor, so you are very lucky, and very brave.		Well done 		Best wishes to you and your loved ones at this time.		You are a stunning looking woman. Good luck.
@HeatherChilders @Bre_payton Heather,	Many forget after World War One horror, world hit by an influenza Epidemic, which killed more people than war.		It devastated my country of New Zealand, as with yours.		Sorry for loss of your friends, at a time when happiness should prevail.		God Bless you girl.
@HeatherChilders 	You are a very lovely and compassionate woman.		You have suffered your own personal struggles making your compassion more laudable.		Heather,	Love your presentation, you are an absolute treasure.		Have a very Happy Festive Season.		If you wish DM me.		Take care.
@TheJordanRachel Comey-Clintons-Obama	If you knew the facts, you would be shocked.	Do you know why Henk Paulsen refused to bailout Lehman Brothers causing the GFC and it's inter links with Bill Clinton?		DM me not for public viewing, if you are serious.		This where Trump hatred started. Clintons.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump Representative Lieu,		Not Trump Shutdown	Trump shutdown closed with House putting that Bill before Senate.		Now it is all Democrat.		Difference	President Trump said he would own shutdown based on Pelosi saying Bill would not get House votes. 		It did.		Now your Party responsible.
@TheJordanRachel 		Thanks Jordan,		You can Direct Message me if you wish.		I do love your aggressive stance, great lateral thinking.		I wonder if DT will do it?		DM me, clearly you have other thoughts.
@TheJordanRachel 	Ending Repatriation of Funds to Mexico 		That is a very clever, decisive move.		In context of new trade agreement, may be considered too tough, but, first class suggestion.		Well done.
@SusanLiTV 	Further to my tweet &amp; I have been impressed by you for years.		DT re-elected 2020, by 2022, I suggest DOW will hit 30,000 pts.		Were he alive Kirk.K. confirms I told him Jun 2006, GFC end of 2008.		2018 DT/USA dodged:	1987, 1997/98, 2008.		DM me to talk.		Happy N/Year
@SusanLiTV 	Hi Susan,	Used to follow you on Bloomberg.	You were great there, now at FOX you will shine.	Had some involvement with GFC, and j/v's in my life with:	Gates (1991-94)	Ted Arison (1996-98)	Kirk Kerkorian (2005-08)	Feel market missed 10yr cyclical hit with 4,000 pt drop.
@bacon_texas 	Exactly.		Where is the money?		Sitting in Appropriations somewhere.		Unless it was diverted to be part of the Iran USD$150Bn that Obama paid out.		Is that why Democrats have harassed President Trump for two years.		They took USA security $$$ and paid it to Iran.
@TheBreckWorsham 		Happy Festive Season		Constitution supporter.		I have told him repeatedly:	Use power of Constitution to adjourn Congress now and indefinitely.		Then see the Democrats absent their political soapbox and 15 mins fame, cave on the Wall.
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely.		You have Constitutional control over financial safety &amp; sovereignty of USA financial system 		USA Secret Service jurisdiction on Fort Knox deposits including USA Treasury Plates.		If you deem Border financial and/or physical threat close it.		Keep Congress shut too
@NutriFitnessSol 		That is disgraceful.		I called for a $3 crowd fund donation fund for the little fella.		You may be tough, but will you back it.		Let the little boy realize his Dad stood for something.		Gives him an anchor in his future.		Good work.		Happy Festive Season.
@realDonaldTrump 	Pray you saw my tweet re: Morocco murder		Never rains it pours, sorry.		This one for the good of the aid community, for a NATO friend, and to give peace to grieving parents.		If possible, this one from your heart, no one needs to know
QUESTION	Clintons-Obama-Iran-USD$-9/11/2001		Did left smear Bush (43)/Trump to coverup biggest USA treason?		1. Clinton cuts intel funds.	2. 9/11 under radar.	3. Sec.State Clinton influence Obama.	4. Clintons paid USD$Bns.	5. Obama:	5.1 Ends sanctions.	5.2. Pays Iran USD$150Bn
@SebGorka Hey.		Have Happy Festive Season.		Glad you bat for Donald.		People who do not know him, do not realize he has been grooming himself for this job unknowingly, all his life.		He is super talented, smart, courteous, doesn't tolerate fools.		A man to ride the river with.		Trail boss.
@realDonaldTrump 	Morocco.	I presume you are aware of a brutal killing of Norwegian trainee female doctor there.		Sorry to ask but this is brutal 		Can you, with Norwegian SF &amp; Moroccan Govt. task USA Rangers there to hand this gang its final needings.		Clear threat Aid workers.
@TheJordanRachel 	COMEY	You are right.		But:	Why is it, every time we ask about something to do with this person, obvious questions like this are missing, under a veil of claims that the questioners know right questions.		They know answers, but do not want them known by public
@RodStryker @UsLiberate Back you 100%		Can a crowd fund page be set up for $3 donations for Mr and Mrs Singh's little baby 		So that he knows he Dad was a brave law abiding American who died doing his duty.
President TRUMP	Donald,	I would never normally ask you a favor, I have no right.	Forgive me.	For handing you a New Year problem not to do with USA.	Morocco	A young Norwegian trainee doctor was brutalized &amp; killed.	Can you with Norway send in Rangers &amp; wipe them out.		Owe you 8E.
@rickygervais 	You know sometimes you are actually funny.		Hilarious 		Sometimes.		Actually funny.		Sometimes funny.		Hilarious actually.		Hmmmmmmmmmmm
@Alyssa_Milano Alyssa Milano		Yes, it is a tragedy.		But why do you hang the hat of blame on President Trump.		You are not stupid.		He is 3 weeks away from 2 full years in Office.		Is he expected to wave a wand and fix programs cut as Bill Clinton zeroed the deficit		He could if you helped him.
@YaWorstNghtmare 	Happy Festive Season
Moroccan MZLMS	You will get yours for what you did to that poor little Norwegian girl.	You are spared my not giving it to you.	You disgusting scum.	You are pelados.
@ElianaBenador @fdmaynard @AppSame That is absolutely disgusting.	Everyone of those mongrels needs to be put in a grave.	Send that to President Trump.	With my message.		Donald,	Special Forces, act with Norway. Kill the lot of them.	Thank You.		That is really sickening.
@donaldtrumpforc 	Well done
@KipTalleyDC Yes real worry.		Time 	Reds Under Beds Democrats 	stopped 	POTUS forging non-confrontational links with Vladimir Putin.		Putin and Donald Trump seem to get on.		Putin is strong, gone in 2024 Trump re-elected gone 2024		Golden Opportunity to put in place Peace for 50 yrs.
@storyheadjillmc @RepMattGaetz @POTUS Do not be silly.
@littleblackmsk 	Do not be an idiot.		He is game changer.
First Lady Melania Trump.		Press can not dent Donald, now have go at you.		No worries, you are universally loved, admired.		Except by moronic bigots.		FYI	YouTube has photo of you showing which reminds me of		1. Raquel Welch at her prime		2. Ursula Andress in Dr. No.		God Bless
@JohnBrennan Brennan,		Never liked you.		Never trusted you.		My Family is a big part of US military history.		Fort Knox after Gen. Henry Knox.		Schofield Barracks after Gen.J.McA.Schofield.		Both US Sec. Of War.		You are out of time.	USA needs smart wars.	Trump right		Where is $5bn from Iraq?
@TomiLahren 	Ted Lieu		You do know Ted Lieu has advocated:	1. End to free speech.	&amp;	2. His act led to Mattis sacking	Democrats seek to change  Chain of Command ending President Trumps' right to respond to nuclear strike.		Mattis directed he be told of threat before POTUS		Sacked.
@SportsRetriever Yes she is beautiful isn't she
@NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Nancy,		Does it matter 		Deceive enemy.		Do you want Air Force One attacked by SAM missile, killing 200 people, including President.		Your hatred can not be so great, if so, you disgrace your Father's memory.		Tell me,	When you were young &amp; attractive did Donald Trump reject you?
President TRUMP		You must use Constitution.		Send Congress out on a long Adjournment.		You and you alone have the power to invoke, then you,:	1. Executive Order funding for 25% shutdown.	2. Executive Order funding for the Wall completely 		Both National Security.
@gdert9 	Cathy,		You liked my thought.		What a great way to send the message.		And increases transparency.		Of course,	It would be closed down when Democrats one day get back in the White House.	(When He'll Freezes Over)
@boxersforlife @cannabiscultur6 @CNN Brilliant!!!!!!
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS To you and your loved ones, have a Happy Festive Season.		Just a thought.		When DT is re-elected 2020, are you running in 2024?		Just a thought.		There is a community minded, very focused popular actor, spiritual &amp; an activist for USA values.		Consider for ticket.		Chris Pratt.
MSNBC		Your presenters are so left leaning, biased &amp; partisan.		President Trump charts his own course as is his right.		He is President.		In 2020 he gets re-elected.		Is the USA to suffer from the division media like you push or will you focus on news &amp; issues Americans value?
MARIA SHARAPOVA		Dear Maria,		May I wish you, your Family &amp; loved ones, a very Happy Festive Season.		A former tennis player invited to all 4 majors, your career has been great, and I believe you are now the most beautiful girl on Earth.		A delight to be alive to see you.
@JohnCornyn 	Happy Festive Season.		You are right.	The hypocrisy is appalling.		Senator,	I am going to be putting a revised version Proposal 8E before President Trump in January 2019.		New version of one I sent your Office 2010.		Can you re:review?		USA economic benefits fix debt
For 2019, I hope … #HappyNewYear #2019Hopes 		I pray,		World sees this is our only home &amp; we must care for it.		Humans fight over territory, lost decades/centuries later.		So stop.		No country is free of poverty/suffering.		Let us fix problems, not  make ones we have worse. https://t.co/dTRAcrJUpI
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	Now know why you made it in New York development &amp;  why Democrat b/s no drama		You just let it go 		Media reaction to your troop  visit, thrilled your gorgeous wife was there, disgusting.		Media forget troops give freedom they enjoy &amp; troops love you.		Go figure!
@realDonaldTrump Donald,	The troops love you.	The markets love you.	401K's love you.	And you are back 		Build the wall under Democrats noses.		Get some rest.		I know you are on top of your game, but if you take day off right now &amp; media called it, public would tell them shut up.		Happy New Year.
World Advertising Council	I realize it may not be politically correct, but has anyone in your esteemed organisation worked out?		Is President Trump's MAGA Make America Great Again, most far reaching, successful independent promotion by an individual in history.		Trump created it.
@winstonCovfefe @Actibonnie Now Merkel &amp; EU's true aim shows.		UK citizens saw it recallin lessons of WW1 &amp; 2.		Germans determined to take over, engine for them to do so is China.		Early 2000's all industrial grade lathes went to China, giving them ability to make heavy construction 		Thank God for Trump.
@mckee_danise @MAGAindex @RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump Donald Trump-Troops	At the end of the day, the only people who have a vote in the liking and value of President Trump's visit are the USA Troops.		They give us freedoms we enjoy including Twitter.		Troops loved it.
@HarryEarthling @walshtown @MAGAindex @realDonaldTrump You are a disgraceful moron.	Consider yourself lucky
@papaholzzz @MAGAindex @RyanAFournier @realDonaldTrump Someone he could trust.
@realDonaldTrump @princessloveMT Well done Mr President.		Troop visit.		Trade delegation in China.		Powell safe		3 diverse but positive acts.		Well done		And bringing troops home 		About time		You act
@SandiMPatriot @tomatoupstairs6 @FuctupMike How can person kill &amp; walk away?		Lawyers must see no protection for Sanctuary City in this case.		Simple reason	Declaration of Independence Founding document of USA.		Murder breaches principle of Life, Liberty, and Pursuit of Happiness.		Absolute precedence.
SCHUMER dislike of TRUMP		Figured out why.		Schumer	30+ years in Congress.	May expect run for President 		Trump	Brash New York property developer 	TV personality.	A presence.		2015	Trump comes from nowhere	2016	Trump now Schumer's boss	2020	Trump likely re-elected.		Schumer	Hate
President TRUMP 	Commander-in-Chief		There is a reason for the title		Because he is in command.		Totally.		1. Markets rebound during shutdown.	Why?	1.1 10 year Bond rollover went with minor hiccup 	1.2. Trump trade team in China, positive, but careful.		2. Trump Visits Troops.
@RandPaul @dwlove9 Senator Paul		Nothing like a subtle dig to make your point.		Have you thought of strafe bombing.		Ever heard of Stealth.		No, not the war technology.		You two shake hands.	You can fight the Left.		United you stand divided you fall.		Happy Festive Season

@Jenn198523 		Jennifer,		I just loved you loved my tweet on Pope Francis.		I  can not stand someone who stands in a glasshouse throwing rocks.		Pope Francis has done much to "drain his swamp" 		But he has certainly not done enough to be lecturing others.		Sweet dreams gorgeous.

Close Congress.		Keep them adjourned.	Constitution says you can.	Do it.		No soap box, you watch Democrats back off.		Take care of u.
Democrats - Mexican Wall		MSNBC 	Experts saying Wall old hat.		USA has technology to do a far better job 		Trump inaugurated President Jan 20, 2017.		How in 8 years of Obama era was all this super Bond style stealth technology NOT put in place?		They had funds?		Build the Wall.
@CharlieDaniels @TomFitton Nor should it.		What is laughable is the contrary position of Democrats.		Obama was the President.		Clinton Secretary of State.		An Ambassador is by USA Law the "embodiment of the President"		And Hillary gets a pass.		How?
@RodStryker @UsLiberate @POTUS That is absolutely brilliant	Happy Festive Season
@NBCNews @OhLadyMeg That is crazy.		POTUS realizes it is essential he is on deck, if a positive development occurs 		And do not tell me NBC knows what the Democrats are doing because NBC would be guilty of subverting Government.		Treason		Leave Trump alone.
@richardbranson Well done Richard.
President TRUMP		Rumour	Masters do resemble pets.		Rumour	Rep. Pelosi has a pet multi-talented jackass.		Problem	As 4-legged variety was not available, next option was Sen. Chuck Schumer!		Result	Opposite to 'I Dream of Jeannie',	Chuck answers her phone calls with:	"Yes Master".
@Dylanesque2604 	Nothing wrong with Bob.	Happy Festive Season

FOX NEWS		Wall Polls		Can you fix your Polling?		54% of Americans against.		Surveying 1,427 people.		330 million Americans.		Increase survey size, plus in such specific matter, survey		Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada.		I will bet 90% want a wall.		Normally good Fox		Lift game.
@Hanntity @dwlove9 Sean,		You are right.		Total annual money in unpaid tax, depressed wages, healthcare &amp; crime illegals cost USA = $200bn PA.		Wall is a solid base, not whole answer, but saves US approx 18% deficit.		5 more annual deficit gone.		Trump averted 2nd GFC by making economic buffer.
@GrassrootsSpeak Ms Greene		The problem with a moron like you is your pessimism.		Even when things going well, like Hillary and to a degree Nancy or Chuck, you are negative.		Stocks down as biggest hit they will take, due to cycle of 10 yrs bonds.		You too dumb to see it.		Trump averted 2nd GFC.
@CB618444 	Best wishes to you and yours for a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year.		So glad you survived cancer, I guess you can not keep a truly good woman down.		Or one so beautiful.		DM if you wish, to help DT.		2019 to be hot year politically, petsonally

@realDonaldTrump @debs4trump President Trump		Merry Christmas to you.		Why are Democrats stoking fire, with respect to Share Market.		Under Obama debt grew &amp; they were all in Congress.		You've avoided 4th financial collapse, by giving back prior gains.		I believe DOW will be 30,000 in 2022, during 2nd Term.
@skyways4u 	Happy Festive Season to you, as much as it can be.	God Bless
@IvankaTrump Merry Christmas to you sweetheart and to all of your Family.		God Bless
President TRUMP		You have avoided the 2018 financial crisis as below:		DOW JONES	1. 02/01/2018 = 24,824.01	2. 24/12/2018 = 21,792.20		That is a 2018 drop of:	3,031.81 Points		Vastly different to:	1987, 1998, 2008 (GFC)		USA Public 401K's pretty good.		Democrats tried to ruin them
@richardbranson Merry Christmas Mr Branson	and may your New Year be both Prosperous and Enjoyable.		Time to rejoice those who are with us and remember those who are gone.		But to give thanks for all.		To you and yours lots of love
@RealDrGina @Nosafetypinneed Dr Gina,	You are smart, gorgeous, and prepared to speak your mind.		Thank God for all of the above.		Keep advising Donald.		Healthcare is the Achilles Heel of every Administration, as it is in UK.		Happy Festive Season and Prosperous New Year.
@_realBlackTrump @gpnavonod That is the simple truth.		To you and yours, may your Festive Season be Merry and the New Year be both prosperous and progressive

@MBOKSR_MAGA @malibujonfanti @realDonaldTrump Tell it as it is.		Schumer either moron, or fraud.		How is Trump responsible:		1. Originally Pelosi to ALL Americans said Bill would not pass House.		2. Bill before House only needs Democrat votes to happen.		Chuck, front up, or you will be recalled in history as a footnote.
@TheFakeLiberal @malibujonfanti @realDonaldTrump Love your thoughts.		Time to expose the real swamp.
@SenSchumer @NancyPelosi Sen.Schumer &amp; Rep.Pelosi		Do You Love America?		Think about Americans.		President Trump is loyal to United States of America		No one wins in game of brinkmanship you play.		Turn the page, grant US$5bn		Or 	1. Congress adjourned.	2.

@patton6966 	Happy Festive Season
@realDonaldTrump Donald,	You may be alone, but you have the unseen silent majority in support.		Wall Polls wrong.	Schumer a holdout.	Pity about Mattis act.		Well done.	First time since 1987, no financial crisis.	Due to your buffer &amp; Americans hard work.		Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
@GregNorberg @dwlove9 That video says it all.		I wonder in identifiable Terms, what Schumer &amp; Pelosi can actually hold up as something they have done to help USA.		Last 20 years in Congress they have been huge part of more shutdowns than in Congressional history.		There is a word for that:	Useless.
@sxdoc @malibujonfanti Why is this not Front Page?

@Civil_war_elect 	Merry Christmas Mark.		Hang on to your hat.		2019, what a ride.		Congress on year long adjournment.		POTUS by Executive Order 		2020 	President Trump re-elected.	Dem's lose House 		2022	USA Debt gone		2024	Proposal 8E fully underway	30 million American jobs.
@GmailGlady 	President TRUMP - Miracle		USA avoided 1st time since 1987, financial shock felt globally.		Trump has not plunged USA into crisis.		1987, 1997-98, 2008 all bad.		Trump foresight:	2016-Elect	2018 r/over crisis likely	He builds buffer in economy to absorb hit.		POTUS
@SenBobCorker Senator Corker &amp; Family,		Happy Festive Season.		Can you stop being so anti The President.		I know you are leaving, but your voice has scaled weight		If DT can stay to 2024, the Debt will be gone by 2022.		Really gone, not swept under the carpet, larger deficit, to pay off debt
@NancySinatra 	Ms Sinatra,	For all you are, and for all your Family means, including quite obviously, your Dad,	Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.		Given it is Paul Robson's, I still love your Dad singing in whites:	Old Man River.		And he enjoyed doing it	God Bless
@dcrow_baby 	Hi Deanna,		Merry Christmas to you all.		Yes,	Schumer should resign.		He is a fraud and a crook.		I wonder where his offshore accounts are.
@Jenn198523 	Love you.	Merry Christmas.
@Jenn198523 		Glad you liked my tweet.		Typical left leaning media.		They get huge revenues on covering those crisis.		Yet Donald avoids the USA having another with a small drop in share values, no one says a thing.		Like his use of Ch11 to help his biz, he paid all debt.
@SusanSt08942260 	Susan,	Love you love my sense of humour.	If it was not so serious.	Happy Festive Season

@Civil_war_elect @realDonaldTrump Well done
@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump Absolutely
@C_3C_3 @SusanSt08942260 Well done.		We should rename election to the Senate and Congress	"Representation for Dummies"		Worked for computers.		What's next.
@KamVTV @Michele111332 Nagging Nancy drunk?		Surely not.		Well that explains irrational behaviour.		What excuse do you have for her malignant, malicious, stupidity?
@ACTforAmerica @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump Well Done.	Merry Christmas.
@RandPaul Trump - Mattis		Why is a main player Representative Lieu?		The same person who has advocated eliminating Free Speech.		Which foreign Government is paying Lieu?		This is outright treason.		This is USA version of English Guy Fawkes "Gunpowder Plot".		Arrest, charge, jail, the lot.
@RandPaul 	Senator Paul,		As years pass you make more sense.		Can you help the President?		Were you approached about taking away from President, right to instant retaliation in case of nuclear strike on USA?		Can you stand and expose the main actors?		Why weren't Americans told?
@SenSchumer Senator Schumer - Mattis		Senator,		Apologize to USA people then resign		You know Mattis working with Democrats to change Chain of Command.		USA attacked, nuclear strike, you intend to take away POTUS capacity to respond.		As it is Trump		You/Mattis gamble with USA lives		TREASON
@RealJack @Actibonnie Well said.	Of the People, by the People, for the People
@tommyhedrick Trump - Mattis		I have had gutsful of left leaning media not telling truth.		POTUS must Order Mattis to tell public truth.		Mattis should.		As for Schumer, his "temper tantrum" remark is contempt of Office of President = Jail		401K's	Stocks down 4,000 PTS	Dem's have cost public $
@tommyhedrick TRUMP - SYRIA - MATTIS	You are right on Syria.	Turkey &amp; NATO an issue.		MATTIS another reason		President Trump has out of courtesy for his service, let Mattis go when he should be charged with Treason.		Mattis subverted USA Chain of Command, to stop POTUS reply to nuclear attack.
President Trump	Take Care	Democrats not finished		2 yrs Mueller nothing.	Now they try mentally unfit		Ex-CIA Panetta asked, solely to lay groundwork		You must Order Mattis to go public on why he is gone.		For trying to stop you having control of Command Chain.		An act of treason.
@SecretSanta161 	You have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.		In the New Year, I may well use your help.		Thank you.
@JesseMulligan 	Hi Jesse,	How is the debonair presenter on TV3, and no I am not referring to Mike M Roberts: albeit a certain winning Dancing with the Stars co-presenter would argue.		The Project works in large part due to you well done.		Merry Christmas to you and yours.

@neal_katyal 		Mattis Resignation	You are a Supreme Court lawyer, so I thank you for your site; due to details from Rep. Lieu; clarifying why Gen. Mattis had to step down.		I pray no more interfering in Command chain is in the works, that is National Security issue, and treason.
@tedlieu @neal_katyal @EdMarkey @POTUS Representative Lieu		Removal - General Mattis		Thanks for clarifying why General Mattis stood down.		He was seeking to illegally interrupt command chain on USA reply to nuclear attack.		President Trump had to let him go, and respectfully, did not publicly out him for treason.

@GmailGlady 	Have a Merry Christmas.		With respect.		Comey lied to Congress.		When  my ancestor General Henry Knox (Ft. Knox), was alive, that conduct, was an offence punishable by death.		I pray that is not your usual standard in life.		If it is, it is very poor.
@hughhewitt @chuckschumer @realDonaldTrump Hugh,	You are absolutely right.		See my earlier tweet today.		2019	Hope Donald keeps Nagging Nancy, Crying Chuck, Delinquent Dick (Durbin), Easy to forget Elijah, proctologist's mate Steny, and the cast of Deplorable Democrats out on a very long adjournment.

@BillKristol Senator Bob Corker fair weather friend.	For God's sake, your sake &amp; America's sake use brains you have &amp; stop stirring.		Fact	Contempt of The Presidency		Schumer with his "temper tantrum" remark would be in jail for 30 days, in times past &amp; have to write apology to avoid staying.
@IngrahamAngle @caselvis58 Laura Ingraham,		Have a Merry Festive Season, and a Happy New Year.		President Reagan	What dignity.		Friend sent me two clips one of Ronald addressing troops.	Brilliant.		So much so I got out letter to me from him and Nancy, 1987.		Loved and respected that man.		Same for Donald.
@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump		Democratic Party Shutdown	Democrats own this action.		In Oval Office to America:		1. Nancy Pelosi told you, House would not pass Bill to fund the Wall.	2. Schumer No votes in Senate.		Bill did pass House.	Chuck stopped it.		Chuck owns failure.
@realDonaldTrump And Donald,		Not fake news.		They're full of it, give praise, they act like emboldened unchecked bullies		Adjournment.	Are last bills funding Govt ready. Order Clerk deliver to Oval Office, sign to pay workers.		No CR. 	Send Nancy, Chuck, Elijah, Adam &amp; Dick on long break.
@Redtowel4 		All American,		You absolute sweetheart.		Best use of a GIF I have seen.		To you and your loved ones,	Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		You did right thing.		Now sign the 7 funding bills.	No CR.		Tell Nancy &amp; Chuck you intend to Recess Congress &amp; adjourn until at least June.		The $5.7bn will magically appear.		Watch your back.		You need 15 Den votes Senate, not 10.		Merry Christmas to you all.
@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump	Re: Wall v Shutdown		You did right thing!	Polls wrong.	Dem's do own it.		W.H. when you took it, Pelosi said would not pass House.		It did.		Senate needed 60 votes, 51 at best-maybe 5-15 Democrat votes.		No Dem. Vote for Bill, failure = Democrats.
@RepAdamSchiff Congressman Adam Schiff		You disgraceful little man.		You do not have moral high ground to call Assad or MBS conduct into question.		For you to critique President, is a joke.		Spending public money to hush up your philandering with young boys.		Get a grip on your...whatever
@realDonaldTrump 		President Trump,		Stick to your guns.		Democrats think you will not win a 2nd Term.		Their entire push is based on that.		You got US$5bn in Congress		Stick to your guns.		Merry Christmas.		Send Congress home indefinitely
@greggutfeld Love your show and attitude.	You are right.	Trump will win.		Name one person smarter.	I hate to say it.	Maybe James Comey	He lies to Congress, lies to the Public, lies to everyone, including his ego, sells books, avoids charges, gets off scot-free.
@Jenn198523 Merry Christmas Santa's gorgeous little helper.		No wonder delivering gifts takes only 1 day, and overnight at that.		He wants to get back quickly so that he can ravish you and give you a very large loving Christmas present.		That is my deeply penetrating analysis.		How say you?
MSNBC on TRUMP	Are you at MSNBC bright?	Think not.		Trump has Mattis resign.	Putin applauds.		Wonder why?		Because in environment	1. You criticize POTUS.	2. Conspiracies thrive.		JOKE	Putin tactical master.		Unlike POTUS unfairly 		He has total control.		Putin is laughing at YOU.
@Juanita74650255 President Trump on Troops	POTUS is right.		17 years in Afghanistan long enough.		How many meetings, how long a piece of string?		Current MTG no better than one under Obama.		Troops home, Taleban warned, stay in your country		Harm us again, next time, gloves off we destroy you.
@SenCortezMasto Senator,	Donald did not tell a lie, Mexico will pay for it, but over a couple of years through new trade deal.	Can you not allow a man to out in place a plan which ends the deficit &amp; retires USA Debt, or are you not bright enough.	Illegals cost USA $200Bn per year, 20% of deficit
@ChuckGrassley @realDonaldTrump Senator Grassley,		I respect you.	But you are wrong.		Think on this.		17 years, too many talks.	Taliban set in ways.		Bring troops home.		Warn Taliban.	Go outside country, do USA or allies harm, we will hit you with full force of USA military, no mercy.		Behave or be destroyed.
@realDonaldTrump Donald,		No-one has referred to the Great Wall of China.		The only item Neil Armstrong could see on Earth from space.		Ironically, China protected herself to now threaten USA.	USA needs wall to keep No1.		No wall is hole in bucket through which USA deficit &amp; debt grow ($200Bn/yr)
@SenBobCorker Senator Corker,		Have a Merry Christmas.		Back The President on this.		It may appear chaotic, but it is planned chaos, Donald has been winning all his life by getting people off balance.		He is a Master at it.		Happy Festive Season.

@GuyonEspiner 	Thank you for your tweet.		Get some rest over break.		2019, is going to be a big year.		Realize, that while share sell off has occurred NYSE, for 1st time 40 years, no crisis.		Next 6 years, DOW will go to 35,000, NZ to 15-17,000 if enough diversity.		Merry Xmas.
@DavidSlack 	Thanks for your tweet David.		You do good work.		2019 will be a frantic year, both economically globally, and as a consequence to NZ, and socially, so NZ needs your smooth analysis more than ever.		Merry Christmas
@kwilli1046 @RichardTBurnett CBS Corporation - TRUMP WINS	Just think about the thousands of children, just like those two, who will rejoice because their Dads, and Mums come on home.	Afghanistan, 17 years.	USA does not need another 38th Parallel (South Korea) or Germany deployment, these over 50 years.
@CNN @CNNOpinion Bulls--t.		I would not hesitate to trust him with my life.		And I have known him, and his character since 1995.		You work for Captain Courageous, what has Ted thrown his spine and morality out the window?

@LoriinUtah @LaylaAlisha11 You and your Family,	Have the best Christmas and New Year you can have.		Some say time heals.		Does it matter, it is good and honourable to take time to; instead of forgetting who we have lost: remembering them, their lives well lived.		God Bless you and your family
@maggieNYT 	Ms Haberman		Thank you for your tweet.		You are a good investigative reporter with sound grip on fair &amp; balanced.		2019 is going to be a more dramatic version of 2018.		Anyone focused on chaos to come in Russia as Putin term ends 2024?		Merry Christmas, you &amp; yours.
@JackPosobiec 		Sir,		Thank you for your tweet.		I follow your comments.		They are almost without exception, prosaic and to the point.		DC developments over next 6 mths will put the cat among the pigeons.		Merry Christmas to you and yours.
@nadabakos 	NADA,		Thank you for your tweet.		Your back story makes you a very interesting, highly intelligent human being.		Having worked for two Governments, both in 5 Eyes I can not pry, but certainly will look at anything you say.		Merry Christmas to you and yours.
@Jenn198523 You are absolutely correct.		How anyone can be so sensible, so right, wearing a Santa hat, and looking adorable is beyond me.		But you do it so well
@IngrahamAngle 	Laura,	Understand you are leaving FOX.	You are a pretty decisive person.	Appreciate your contribution to what FOX seems to understand is democracy.	Many others seem subservient to almost socialism.	Good way to go, leave at Christmas, New Year, new start.	Good Luck
@JoeBiden 	Mr Vice President,		Don't get sucked in to fake sympathies put out by Nancy Pelosi &amp; Chuck Schumer.		Surely you are a smart enough upper echelon politician to realize Americans have had enough B/S.		Staff serve at POTUS pleasure.		Get above frey.		But 2020, Trump wins
@realDonaldTrump 		Mr President,		Do you know what is nice to see?		You on the television, telling the American People and the world, how it is.		You have a full schedule and I do not want to put a burr under your saddle but now is the right time for weekly firesides.		We love ya
@mymeditrax @Nosafetypinneed To back up The Duke's statement:	Oscar Wilde once said:	"Some people are stupid, some of those people open their mouths and prove it"		Oh, hello Nancy, Chuck.		Grrrrrrrrrrrr.
@Nosafetypinneed 	Thanks for your tweet.	Like your style.	I can not stand those psychophant morons Pelosi, and Schumer.	What amazes me is the open contempt of Schumer to the American people.	I would love to employ him.	Sacking him would be a moment of great pleasure.	Merry Xmas.
@NancyPelosi Mrs Pelosi,	Given past Democratic votes for border security.		You have the credibility of John Gotti.	Difference	On you the mud sticks.		Do you really believe American voters are so stupid.	Are you like Hillary Clinton, 50% are "deplorable"		Retire.
@realDonaldTrump Exactly.	Just like the feigned handwringing today over Sec. Mattis	In your Office they criticize.	He leaves, "Oh, chaos ensues"		Donald 	The only chaos in Congress is in the aged Members in Leadership on the Democrats side (Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer, Durbin etc.)		And get some sleep
@UltClassicRock @StaeubleAndre Absolutely.	And Tom would have had the biggest smile on his face	Well said.
@magnettothesea @StaeubleAndre @StevieNicks @rockhall @fleetwoodmac Stephanie,	You are still the most beautiful woman on Earth to me.	Those photos are great.	Congratulations on Hall of Fame.	Are you still friendly with Dennis, Glen and Rob Light	Love you baby
@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump,		Well done.		Send Chuck &amp; Nancy home until June 30 2019.		Use Executive Powers to Order:	1. Wall completed		2. VA computer replaced		3. Secret Service to initiate print of USD$40Tn to:	3.1 Retire all debt.	3.2 Fund infrastructure		You look tired
@InnSheep @madmamma4 COMEY - Memory Lapse		You are right, but not one media has focused on the obvious.		Comey could have plead the 5th but he did not.		He chose to lie to Congress, like Gen. Flynn but gets a free pass from prosecution.		Hope new AG Barr clips him
@SenBobCorker Senator Corker,	I tender my unreserved apology to you, further asking your permission to withdraw my caution &amp; apologize for its implication.		Your letter was forthright &amp; befitted a tribute to a man of the calibre to whom it referred.		Well done.		Merry Christmas to you &amp; yours.
@WhiteHouse To The White House.	Well done.	If only President Trump was given credit for the real work away from headlines he does		I have never seen a Leader not only so maligned, but so unfairly maligned.		Merry Christmas to White House.
@SenBobCorker Sen. Corker,	If in your statement on the resignation of Sec. Mattis you make one unsupported claim where you make an assumption, not based on fact, which in turn disparages The President, you will be guilty of treason against the sovereign authority of The Presidency.	Watch out.
USA CONSTITUTION	Wish political commentators (Juan on Fox) would read:	Constitution.	1. Vests Exec.Pwr. President	2. President has Executive Authority National Security:	2.1: Financial.	2.2: Physical.	3. Adjournment of Congress at Presidents' will.	4. No Congress: POTUS uses E.O.
US Gobernment Shutdown.	Trump vs Pelosi &amp; Schumer		Crying Chuck &amp; Nagging Nancy again.		Lying to public, on sadness at Mattis leaving Admin., &amp; CR being only option to DT.		RUBBISH	Congress adjournment 2019 to June 30th at least. DT runs Govt by EO incl: Wall.		Congress no say.
@ChuckGrassley Senator Grassley,		Well done		Fight for your reputation.		All your years of service.	Regretfully, in this modern era, service is paid lip service by so many who have not in any way done so.		Happy Festive Season to you and yours.
@realDonaldTrump 		President TRUMP		Do not back down.		Sign those 7 Bills not the Continuing Resolution.		Send Congress into recess with adjournment June 30, 2019.		Schumer/Pelosi scared only they have won MidTerms and you take their platform away.		They do not care about USA.
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle We all still love you, you know.		There are millions of Americans who have their fingers, legs, arms, lovers hair crossed, praying you will tell Nagging Nancy and Crying Chuck, the're fired.		At least first 6 mths of 2019, maybe all of it.		Donald they are not practical you are.
@RealJamesWoods Hey You,		Even though you do not respond, like your opinions, loved your acting, so:		To you and yours James Woods, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.		And thanks.
@realDonaldTrump 		President Trump	URGENT		You do what I advise about extending adjournment time of Congress on recess out to June 2019.		But		Do not sign the CR.		Sign the actual bills. 		Congress then is blunted for a reason to resume sittings.		Give them nothing.		Go hard.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump	Re: Syria	You made right call	Doomsayers can't see future &amp; when USA lawmakers can not secure border, criticism a joke.	Re: Wall	No need shutdown sign Bills Tell Congress adjournment to June 30, 2019.	Const. vests Exec.Power in you.	Spend by EO, incl: Wall.	Legal.
@GaileyGirrl 	Thanks Gail,	Have a Merry Christmas
@Cb59Carolina75 	Thank you for your tweet.		See DT pulling troops out of Syria.		I agree with him.
@realDonaldTrump Well done
@AmbJohnBolton @dwlove9 Secretary Bolton		You have long served the USA.		To not waste words.		To you and your loved ones, I pray you have a Merry Festive Christmas, and in the context of 2019, a Safe, Enjoyable, and Productive New Year.		Safe hands Mr Bolton
@CJHanselman 	Thank you for your tweet
@davidaxelrod David,	Why do you belittle yourself?		You more than nearly anyone on Earth know how varied are the subjects the President must deal with, at a moment's notice, or long term.		You know it is continuous.	You know he ran on this.		Be decent, apologize, be a man.		It's Christmas.
@elonmusk Very smart Eion.		Now you know how Steve Jobs felt, when Apple turned on him.		No creativity, funds from Bill Gates, Steve back in, Apple reborn.		Tesla does not have creative juice without you, and you need a lateral thinking business platform.		Well done on this, revolutionary.
President Trump		For 2 years for Hillary, Dem's have ruined your Presidency.		Now at last minute 2018 they shut down funding wall to send you a present prior to a Democratic House majority.		They are stealing Presidency		Put foot down.		Bargain 2019 adjournment for wall funds.
@realDonaldTrump 		Mr President,		You shut down Government, 1. Fund Bills by Executive Order first thing in New Year.	2. Tell Congress adjourned for 2019.	3. Exec.Order. funds for wall.		You win 2020 &amp; Dem House gone.		Pelosi/Schumer are not in charge, you are The President.		Act
@JaniceDean @IncredibleCulk I only have to see your name to have a smile on my face.		You are a sweetheart Janice Dean		To you and yours,	Merry Christmas and a Happy and safe New Year
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,	Don't kick can down road, you will not be re-elected, and not sound.		Pre-empt everything:	Call party leaders/whips to WH.		Tell them, no money for wall	1. No bills Signed.	2. Congress after recess, will adjourn until at least June 30, maybe all 2019.		Then E/O
@PaulieD55 @Jenn198523 You are right.		They had the power but prove to be gutlesd
@willchamberlain @Michele111332 Well said.
@realDonaldTrump 		Mr President,		Imagine the USA without any debt?		No more interest payments, and enough capital in bank to pay for development.		This will be your lasting legacy.		Some in Congress think tiny steps best		You know big step is needed		USA must not be modern Rome.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President		USD$40Tn use	1. Pay Debt	1.1 C/flows USA funds with Treasury Notes so they can meet retiree p/outs.		1.2. USD$ - 30%		2. Increases exports.		3. China gets $3Tn = $2.1Tn, must use domestically.		4. $10Tn USA infrastructure		5.$7Tn for Proposal 8E.		No more interest.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,		Sack Powell.		He is a Comey hiring error, he will use Fed to stop your agenda.		USA debt, biggest issue.	Tinkering won"t do.		Constitution vests Executive Power in Presidency.		Next 2 years print USD$40Tn and pay off debt completely.
@BlueStateSOS 	Merry Christmas.	2019	Will be a tumultuous year, for:	Crying Chuck &amp; Nagging Nancy.	Keep supporting Donald.		Get young girls out voting for him 2020, he backs:	1. Equal Opportunity.	2. Equal Pay.	3. Women's rights.	4. Upskilling and upscaling pay and conditions.

@DeplorableChoir @mbohannon9 you are so beautiful
@senatemajldr 	Merry Christmas Senator.		2019 will be the most important post-WW2 year in USA history, and you as Senate Majority Leader have one of the great seats to observe from, and as Leader play a huge role in shaping.		Proposal 8E: 2019-2029, will allow USA to prosper.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Senator SCHUMER		4 Issues	1. In Congress 37 years.	2. Not rich, so honest.	3. Harvard, so well educated	4. Debt, biggest USA issue.		Question	Given Trump saved his biz 6x using Ch11 provisions &amp; paid all debt, can you cut him slack?		USA needs to pay debt, he can do it		Help him
@BillKristol @esaagar @ComfortablySmug Bill,		If Democrats stop hounding him, he has time to do so.		Nice to see you mellow to ask instead of disparage or attack.		He is enacting a lot of things to improve USA life.		Now he will focus on the big one, Debt.		Gone, America can breathe.		Merry Christmas to you and yours.
@Tim_Walz 		One Aries (me April 10) to another, congratulations 		I pray for Great State of Minnesota, that a Democrat politically, you will reach out to this President, establishing friendly links which can only benefit your State and USA in good times &amp; not.		Merry Christmas
@RealMattCouch @PennyHicks13 Adam Schiff.		What a hypocrite.		How low could one of the Democrats stoop 		Donald used his own money.		And when the two women were at their prime both gorgeous 		We all know DT loves beautiful women, I guess little Adams judgement is a bit bent, I mean crooked.		He is finished

@charliekirk11 @rpmmasaya Hi Charlie,	Why is this statistic not being discussed publicly.		This clearly shows individuals and companies voting with their feet.		Unfortunately it may not get DT a 2nd Term.		Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year
@sandster29 	Hi Sandy,	Yet another issue the Trump White House gets limited or no publicity on!		Merry Christmas
@tina_tmcronin1 		Thank you Tina for your tweet.		Yes we love Donald Trump too!		Talk about a President who gets things done.		It is like having John Wayne in the Office.		Did you see Crying Chuck &amp; Nagging Nancy in White House.		By end DT sent them to the outhouse!		Merry Xmas
@Actibonnie 	Thanks Bonnie.	School shootings are tragedy of the worst kind.	They steal the flower of youth before it has had time to bloom.
@IvankaTrump 		Thank you for informing me.		You do so much behind the scenes, with &amp; without Jared		DT loves to out think issues, but honestly short of fences, limited exit/entry pts., X-ray all bags, I am stumped, he is too.		DT knows he must fix, you're part of that solution.
@AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Andrew Pollack	Sir,	I know of tragedy.		Do not know of work you do. 		I know this, having run 65 primary/intermed. schools, in administration in NZ.		All children are our future.		They must be safe at school to learn, play, love, mix.		USA has bad problem, your help is a Godsend.
General Flynn - COMEY	Judge Emmett Sullivan,		May rule, while Flynn lied to FBI, due to then FBI Head Comey admitting he broke protocol with White House, home to President, that then conduct of FBI to not caution Flynn on counsel, was unfair &amp; Abuse of Power.	12 mths probation.
Senator Rand Paul,	Saw your interview on Neil Cavuto's show.		You are really coming of age		Nothing you said do I not agree with, even greater oversight of the Fed.		I have no doubt Greenspan's 47 of 48 months cash rate cuts put GFC unnaturally to fore.		You &amp; yours MC &amp; HNYr.
@SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan,	You as much as any, then for your State, then as Member of Congress, know just how precarious the solvency of the USA is as she trades now, and that by 2026, on a trajectory from Obama, USA trades insolvent.	Donald Trump can solve it, but he needs time to plan.
@PressSec Miss Sarah Sanders,	To you &amp; yours lol &amp; best wishes for Merry Christmas &amp; Happy, Safe, Prosperous, New Year.		You do sterling work girl, Donald found a diamond.		I tweeted DT get on front foot, now is chance, as Mueller destroying evidence get his warrant voided by SCOTUS ASAP.
@Jenn198523 @ReneeMcCone Cheeky, as I am kissing you
COMEY AT CONGRESS	You are a disgrace.	The FBI Founding Director would have had you shot on assignment.		You have lied, conspired to derail Law &amp; Order, and lied under Oath before Congress.		My ancestor Henry Knox would have had President Washington execute you.		Go to jail.
@TomiLahren You are adorable.		NSA Report:	Person seen fleeing area into air space riding a broom
@beatraider 	Mueller Now		Hi Julie,	Mueller may have destroyed thousands of investigation documents.		If so, no claim of what they were valid, no proof.		Mueller work compromised, Warrant uplifted &amp; scrapped.		Donald must ask SCOTUS, ruling on valid convictions.		Mueller finished
@HeatherChilders 	Thank you for your tweet.		Love your address photo, Rupert's Executives have an uncanny knack of hiring exquisitely beautiful, smart presenters, Cavuto excused.		Tell me, surely DT in WH real boon - news based channels		To you and yours, Merry Christmas &amp; H N Yr
@margarettalev 	Hi Margaret,	Have you got a role which traverses for an intelligent person two of the greatest theatres in their respective fields.		The ultimate Seat of Power, and the most well funded, researched financial critic in the world.
@IvankaTrump 	I know you try to remain a-political, just leave it with DT TODAY.		If true Mueller has destroyed documents, no evidence what they are, a claim is inadmissible.		Warrant tainted, Congress to endorse sacking and SCOTUS urgent ruling - valid convictions.		SC role over
@IvankaTrump 		Ms Trump,		First of all, to you and yours, a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.		2. You and your husband have been lions for USA, great work.		I have sent another text to you can you see DT about it urgently please?		Take care, be safe.	You are a good girl.
@RealDrGina 	Hello Dr Gina,	I know you are happily married, but sweetheart if you were actively making house calls I would force myself to be sick, for the privilege.		Merry Christmas to you and your loved ones.		Are you going to talk to DT on your take re USA health system?
@Actibonnie 	Hi Bonnie,	Merry Christmas.	Seems like Prosecutor Mueller has done what many do, he has over reached.	He needs to be charged 	Oh the irony.
@TiwariLalmani 	Merry Christmas Lalmani
@dudandi_miriam 	Hi Miriam,	1st: Merry Christmas.	2nd:	Is there proof Mueller destroyed documents.	If so number of things happen as result.		1. Must be construed action to pervert justice.		2. Albeit other proof his work tainted, authority gone.		3. Those convicted cleared.
@beatraider 		Thanks Julie,		The man is under crazy pressure, from Democrats who I initially thought were bad losers.		Now I know they are crooks, trying to cover up their treason with Iran by having go at DT.		Merry Christmas, be Happy, have great New Year.
KATE BECKINSALE	You have the most divine face, eyes, and smile; not that every other visible part of you, is not perfectly divine		I pray you &amp; your loved ones enjoy a beautiful Christmas, &amp; happiest of New Year's, &amp; if you wish to visit New Zealand, I will pay for you &amp; family.
@Jenn198523 It is not.
@newtgingrich @DiamondandSilk Speaker Gingrich,		About time a Senior voice of reason spoke.		Be careful, or the Democrats will have at you.		I believe this stems from Iran deal, and Clinton's paid money to curry favor with Obama, which saw:		1. Sanctions gone.	2. A/ment.	https://t.co/qttxYVSF8U$150Bn to Iran.
@Sherry40614670 	Thanks Sherry.		Can you believe this.		2 years of daily attacks on President Trump, by Dem's.		Yes, Hillary will accept vote.	Really, what rubbish 		Remember Clinton's were poor, not any more.		All Senior Democrats are in this.		This USA Profumo moment.		Trump OK
@RudyGiuliani Rudy	You really need to focus on the Iran Deal.		Think for one moment.		To maintain 2 yrs constant attacks on President means 1 of 2 things:		1. President guilty something very serious.	(We know that is rubbish).		2. Opponents hiding matter.	(Iran - $150bn, Clinton Foundn.,Obama)
President TRUMP		2 years after your 2016 win, not for one single day have the Democrats eased up.		Hillary: "I will accept vote".	Rubbish. Bad sport.		If drama ongoing 1 year, OK?		Reason no break 2 years, to prevent you from looking into Iran/Clinton Fdn Deal.		Snr Dems corrupt.
@dcrow_baby		Thanks Deanna
President TRUMP	USD$5Bn for Border Wall.		Get on front foot offensive.		Sen. Chuck Schumer says you will not get US taxpayer funds to secure border.		He can explain how:	1. Obama signs Iran a/ment	2. Iran sanctions lifted.	3. Obama gives US$150Bn to Iran as gift.	(Taxpayer funds)
USA News Media/Congress	You attack President Trump but look in wrong direction.		Clinton Arab-Israeli Peace Talks in 1995 are key.		Those would not happen, if Trump did not offer to buy NY land so Clinton could repay Sultan of Brunei (Islam) for sovereign theft ($19bn) by nephew
@Jenn198523 	Hi,	Fancy seeing you on twitter.	Kind regards.
Rudi Guiliani - Donald Trump	Pal,	When New York was hurting, you, and President George W. Bush gave us all comfort.		Now you do it again with old mate President Trump.		Special Counsel Mueller &amp; staff have not acted in a fit &amp; proper manner, so they must not get near POTUS again.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump	Border Separation		You need to make public aware of these things.		I can not figure out why the White House does not have her own TV, Cable, Satellite broadcast.		You could weekly, take your messages into USA homes.		You could set this up in 45 days, presenter you
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Nice to see you have some time to do things you wanted to do in last couple of days.		Call Bill Gates if there is one man who can write code to recover deleted, he is it.		Comey must be on same charge as Cohen, lying to Congress.		Shut them down		Hillary is next.
@krassenstein Nothing.		Don't you have a brain?		The Clinton's are dirty.		Are you so biased you do not think?
@RealDrGina @realDonaldTrump Exactly.		As one President did say:	"The buck stops here".		Question:	As a Doctor do have a liquid, maybe sodium pentathlon, you could inject James Comey with, so at his visit to the Hill today, he can remember to tell the truth.		Merry Christmas to you and yours.
@DavidKing478 @xbrooklynite21 @AGLynch @Comey @POTUS Game, set, and match.		Hillary must go to jail.
@kanyewest 	Merry Christmas.		2018 was a year you stood up, you did not back the wrong man.		Look at African American:	1. U/E rates low.	2. Wage rates up.	3. Employment/training ops.		Plus Criminal Justice reform.		Truth to power, Trump is doing it, others just talk.		God Bless.
@dcrow_baby 	Deanna,	How are you.	I can not believe, someone of the age and experience of Senator Richard Durbin could stoop that low.		Forgive my quip:	Dick by name, dick by nature.
@SenatorDurbin 		2020		1. House majority regained by GOP.		2. President Trump re-elected.		Then be very afraid.		Obama/Clinton fraud, backed by you, Schumer, Hoyer, Feinstein and Pelosi, will be exposed.		Iran actions are treason.		Re-elected, Donald Trump will not make mistakes.
@SenatorDurbin Twitter overtype.	Was Durbin.
@SenatorDurbin Senator Durning,	You know what the true medical facts are behind that poor girl's death.		What is appalling is a person of your experience, using the death of a 7yo girl as a crutch, for you to attack President Trump.		You are past decency, and your used by date.		Resign.
@Jenn198523 @Trump454545 Merry Christmas.
@TomiLahren Tomi,	Love your show &amp; attitude.		Key to Dem attack on Trump	Take a look at Iran:	1. Clinton Sec.State to 2013.	2. Foundation USD$millions (hundreds) until 2017.	3. Why-buy influence.	4. Obama	4.1. Declines prosecute 15.	4.2. Sign a/ment lift sanctions.	4.3. Gifts Iran US$150Bn.
Jonathon Wachtel,	Are you related to Waddy?	Direct message me please.
@nancy73gg 	Thanks Nancy.		There is something really dirty going on with the Democrats constantly attacking President Trump.		Iran is central to all of this &amp; I hate to say it, the Obama Administration is in it up to their eyeballs.		Clinton's are dirty, they once were broke.
@BarackObama President Obama,		You may Direct Message me your answer, in private, but I reserve the right, to post it.		Bluntly, 	I do not like what is being done to President Trump, he is political novice, his time as practical man being wasted.		To cover up, Clinton fraud.		Intolerable.
@BarackObama President Obama		2 Questions		1. Who could Hillary Clinton have claimed access to &amp; influence over, in your Administration to justify Clinton Foundation receiving hundreds of millions USD$?		2. Why did you, in addition to lifting sanctions, gift USD$150Bn to Iran?		Please answer.
PRESIDENT TRUMP	ALERT	Clinton 	1. Sec.State to 2013.	2. Foundation millions to 2017.	3. No direct WH influence so who offered her contact?	4. President Obama.	5. Why?	6. Obama US$150bn to Iran, lift sanctions.		You Threat	Sanctions back, scared u dig deeper.		US Profumo moment.
Hillary Clinton Treason	Democrat Party collusion.		This no longer a joke.		Schumer &amp; Pelosi no longer support funds for a wall to protect USA.		Obama gives billions to Iran.		Democrats implacable, why?		Could these attacks on Trump be a smokescreen?		Is this USA - Profumo moment?
Hillary Clinton Treason?	NEWS ALERT.		Clinton	Sec. of State 2009-2013.		Clinton Foundation	Hundreds of millions funds to 2017.		Question	Clinton no direct role so who does she have influence over to get $?		Answer	Barack Obama		Issue	USD$150bn to Iran		Threat	Trump exposes Iran.
@ft_content FT Content	That is correct &amp; gets worse.		Proposal 8E	Will ensure that to a degree the increase in temperature is mitigated, in a unique way.		I will be pushing 8E with a Brief going to White House early 2019.		Thank you
@krassenstein @susan_blakely Brian,	Nice to see you engaging in productive commentary.		Given multi-million $ fraud alleged against Clinton Foundation are you an unbiased critic?		When tax fraud carried out, takes money from Education, Health, social services that make USA a better country.		Are you fair?
@HillaryClinton Hillary Clinton	You have been exposed as a greedy, self serving, fraudster.		Your charity will be found to have operated as a deposit fund for entities to subvert USA, you, guilty of treason.		Now, you disparage USA Border Guards, read report, she had no food for 1 week.		Loser.
@dcrow_baby 	Thanks Deanna,	Merry Christmas to you and your family
@TheTestyTarheel @realDonaldTrump Testy,	That is the reason why any American can trust Donald.		But,	The hours he is putting in, it will kill him if he does not get results.		Do Pelosi/Schumer care, not one not, nor about US public.		Healthcare &amp; wall are critical.		Testy, you do not need to duck, I'll kiss you.
@V_actually @xbrooklynite21 Very true.	Disgraceful
@paulkrugman Prof. Krugman,		You are a fine one to talk.		Start of 2009-11 you were very popular for comments on state of world economy post GFC.		Before Black Swan, I am on record for saying GFC 2008.		You are nothing but a reflectionist, no solutions.		If you criticize offer an alternative?
@RedNationRising @xbrooklynite21 Merry Christmas, and a Happy, Prosperous, and Commonsense New Year.
@Jenn198523 @LaylaAlisha11 Adam Schiff	A True Member of Congress.	But homosexual Member.		Puts different slant on his anti-Trump stance.		President Trump always surrounded by beautiful, smart women.		Did Adam Schiff fall short, did little Adam, not measure up?		Is Schiff so 'hard on' DT due to jealousy?
@realDonaldTrump @RyanZinke Donald.		Close Congress.		You have the Power.		That is why the Founding Fathers gave it to you.		Imagine first six months of 2019, without Nancy or Chuck nagging you.		Plus it will give sunlight to all the claims/actions against you.		Cohen is a moron.		Get China onboard.
@GOP 		President Trump,	Should sign the Bills to keep Government going, so those staff do not suffer.		Congress	On recess, extend adjournment to June 30, 2019.		Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff, and others thrive off their 15mins of fame.		Strip them of the spotlight.
@davidaxelrod @GOP @realDonaldTrump David,	You are a smart guy.		But HR51 passed resulted in major price shifts, and many promises made, were not kept eg: keep your Doctor.		No way should a person on $30,000/yr pay $26,000.		Barack has to help redo his Bill, it is his right, he started it, he's smart, must help.
To All The Beautiful Women In The World		Those who are, who believe they are, have been told they are &amp; those who do not know.		Have a Merry Christmas &amp; a Happy &amp; Prosperous New Year.		We men would be lost without you &amp; yes, we do love you.		Stephanie,	Love you, every day, girl.
@JaniceDean Janice Dean		America's weather sweetheart.		Merry to you and yours.	You are adorable.
Sheriff Mike Neilson	Boone County, Indiana	142 Police Officers killed in 2018.	CONGRESS	For a State the size of Indiana, to have 142 sworn Police killed is appalling.	You need to act to protect your fellow Americans.	Fund the Wall.	Do it once and properly.	Then do something else
FOX NEWS 	Omar in USA Congress.		Right question is this.		Rep. Omar	You swore Oath of Allegiance to be Member of Congress, which has precedence:	1. Your Oath to USA?	2. Your faith in Islam?		In vote on issue USA/Islamic nation will you favor USA?		If does not favor USA expel her.
TRUMP Affair Payments		President Trump can not be fairly/honestly queried by Mueller on this matter.		Media/lawyers have gone public on what will/will not find Trump guilty.		Cohen, led by media, saying what they want to hear.		POTUS accused by liar/2 prostitutes.		This is crazy.
Former President Barack Obama &amp; Former First Lady Michelle Obama.		Why don't two of you &amp; girls go up to White House &amp; wish President &amp; his Family a Merry Christmas!		ObamaCare, you opened Debate; on change, participate.		African Americans gaining equality, help him.		God Bless
@charliekirk11 @dwlove9 @realDonaldTrump Yes absolutely.		Chance for USA Healthcare to be correctly mandated, accessible all Americans.		Given Medicare &amp; MedicAid are fiscally bankrupt, offers opportunities for great lateral thinking.		Just one thing, to be kind, I never liked Obamacare, but at least he opened debate.
@jmclaughlinSAIS 	Thank you for your tweet!	Merry Christmas.
@danbalz 	Dan,	Glad of your infrequent tweet.	Thank you.	Merry Christmas.
President TRUMP	All Executives serve at your pleasure.		Before GOP loses House.		Order Rod Rosenstein to give evidence to the Committee.		If he refuses or delays, sack him for Gross Misconduct.		Get on the front foot, NOW!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	Well done.	Now enjoy Christmas.	In New Year relentlessly get on the front foot.		Extend the Congressional adjournment, until the end of the financial year 2018.		Watch crying Schumer beg to give you the ten votes.		God help Schumer if illegal kills another American.
@dcrow_baby 	Deanna,	Thank you for your tweet.	To you and yours, please have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and prosperous New Year.	Big hug!	God Bless
James Comey - Bill of Rights		Amazing!	Hard to know which worse, Comey on Flynn before an audience.		1. A self-serving, delusional, egotistical, narcissistic, ex-FBI Director.	or	2. Psycophantic laughter of audience.		Comey outlines how he removed Americans right to due process.
Senator Lindsey Graham 		You on Cavuto.		Did you read my Tweet?		You added in Avenatti, sorry forgot him.		How could I be so stupid to forget a sleazy lawyer who with 15 mins of fame thought he could be POTUS.		Agree on MBS, sanction SWIFT use for oil payments.		Merry Christmas.
President TRUMP.		Just look at your accusers.		This is how the Will of the American People is being subverted by Democrats, through their goading of Special Counsel.		Your accusers	1. Proven liar to be jailed.	2. Two prostitutes, who ask for payment in extortion.		Only in USA.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,		Read my tweet.		Cohen &amp; Flynn mistakes.		Not first Administration to have NSA hiring problem.		Watch your step.		Dem's covering Clinton's &amp; whoever, Obama Admin.  (Foreign Affairs) Hillary paid to influence.		Donald, call Juan Zarate to search for Clinton mole $
President TRUMP	Donald,	For the good, and secure future tenure, of your Presidency, you must abandon any loyalty to former National Security Advisor Gen. Michael Flynn.		Once a liar, always a liar, just like Cohen.		No need you to be dragged down you did nothing wrong.		Job focus
President TRUMP		Don't close Government.		Just invoke the Articles of the Constitution, which allow you, when Congress is in recess, to determine the length of that adjournment.		Further, if they decide to not recess, you have power to Order it		Dem's not in Congress 2019,	Peace.
@NancyPelosi Nancy Pelosi	Do you honestly believe that attaching your sympathy to that tragedy, will buy you any credibility or understanding!		Grow up!		You have an opportunity to come together with this President, with Senator Schumer, and UNITE the USA.		Instead you divide.		Treasonous!
@RealJamesWoods @joann1304 James Woods,	I tweeted about this a while back in response to Democrat Elijah Cummins.		I know you have seen it all before, but I know you are unbiased, give e/one fair go.		How low can these publicly paid servants stoop, making a little girl a political crutch.		He should resign
To FOX &amp; Friends	To Steve Doocey &amp; Brian Kilmeade, and the beautiful rose Ainslee b/w two thorns on couch.		Thanks for another Great Year, yet again, for most comfortable way to watch latest News and human interest tales USA/global.		Diff FOX &amp; rest.	FOX presentation is happy.
@DrDannielle You are not seeing the bigger picture.	In run-up to 2016, Hillary not Sec of State.	Only way she could offer any influence to foreign funders is if she could prove influence over Obama.		To get Clinton, simple:	Foundation not operating as a charity, which pays 0 tax.		Tax fraud.
TRUMP-Podesta-Clintons	Now we know why Trump is hounded on no evidence.		If Clinton Foundation taking this scale of foreign funds, in 2016-2017, and Hillary no longer Sec.of.State in run-up to 2016 Election foreign influence is over OBAMA.		So Trump is a diversion.		DT gut US DOJ
@magnettothesea Sweetheart,		I pray as the newest member of the Hall of Fame, and the 1st Female two time inductee, you greeted the new day with a spring in your step.		A 'Silver Springs'???		Lots of love always.
President TRUMP		WH Chief of Staff		Why not Stephen Millar.		I know he is your Senior Policy Advisor, but he is the strongest possible advocate and a very eloquent speaker.		He loves your message and can sell it.		But if he does not want it, no harm done.		Perfect for 2019-2020.
@RepCummings Representative Cummings	Migrant Girl Death	I demand you resign from Congress.	You are not a 'fit &amp; proper person' to be a gentleman.	How dare you use her tragic death to attack US Border Guards &amp; President Trump.	Medical report states she had not eaten for many days.	Be ashamed.
@DustyOldBooksS1 	Dusty,	Thank you.	How can a girl who appears to be on top of the world, do that?	Then you see these nagging Democrats intent on pulling down rather than building up
President Trump.	James Comey.	You need to ask the DOJ, on the basis of his televised admission, if Comey can be prosecuted for a Gross Abuse of Power &amp; Breach of Civil Liberties/Bill of Rights, with respect to Gen. Flynn.		Knock chip of his wall.		Merry Christmas Donald &amp; Family.
@FOX2News @DustyOldBooksS1 Jessica Starr	FOX	What a tragedy.	Why, how can life turn on you that much?
Harris Faulkner		Great interview of President Trump.		You are a sensational looking woman, and Donald knew he could get away with nothing, because you are good, at your job.		Very well done.
Mr President	Chief of Staff		Take the man who is volunteering for the role.		If you trust him, welcome him, then move forward.		Get on the offensive.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Mrs Pelosi,	For a woman, at a time when ladies are trying to reinforce their rightful position in the world, you are a dichotomy.	Women are always regarded as protective of their family, yet to make Americans safe you will not fund protection.	Back POTUS, be on historical record.
@utapao1 @steph93065 @chuckwoolery @AWRHawkins @BreitbartNews @SenSchumer @POTUS very clever.		Would be really funny, if not so serious.		Can Congress not hear what US Border Agents are saying?		Typical politicians, know best, but no nothing.		Thank goodness Trump listens.		Oh, he's not a politician.		No, a Leader.
@FatherThyme59 @DustyOldBooksS1 @dbongino ENTRAPMENT.		Disgraceful.		That is a gaolable offence.
@brycetache You are a malignant dreamer.		2020 he will be re-elected, because by then the truth will be out, so that even you can understand it.
@BBCWorld Who do you believe?		Man proven as a liar in a Court of Law?		President of the United States of America.		POTUS anyday.
@RealDrGina Exactly.		No money could have been paid to either woman, unless they sought it by threat, or threatened to go public.		Which means the primary act was extortion.		If DT said handle that type of matter for me I did not know details, Cohen lying to buy favors.		Merry Christmas.
@marcorubio Your time will come for the Oval Office.		What about share splits, capital raising which makes balance sheets artificially better, pays obscene bonuses.		Biggest problem USD$23Tn debt is domestic debt, it is stopping Pension Fund investment for future payouts.		Raided during GFC.
@Chromanova @DannyAShea You cheeky bugger.		I am a Trump supporter.		But that is a classic, pity you can not make hand hit cup.		Even Donald would find that funny.		Well done!
@RepAdamSchiff Rep. Schiff,	Albeit the social side of running a country, you must agree USA is a huge business.	USA debt 45% owed overseas, bad enough, but domestic debt is stopping Pension Funds earning to pay retirees in future.	Talk to the President, he has plan to lower debt.	For USA sake.
@magnettothesea Sure, and you always pay your dues to your band mates.	This award is for you, and all the people who helped get you there, bandmates, friends, and Family.		Stop being hard on yourself.		Sitting here hearing Tom, Girl, life is too short.	Take the wins.		Love you Stephanie, always.
Musicians Lost	I am here listening to Tom Petty, sent a tweet to Stevie Nicks, who years ago introduced me to Tom.	Stephanie in R &amp; R Hall of Fame last night.	Listening to YouTube collection, Prince, Jeff Lynd, Ringo Starr, George Harrison, &amp; The HeartBreakers - Tom, miss you.
@DirjjAB @SusanSt08942260 @SophieSRapp @brithume 100%	Most media only interested in headlines not consequences, they do not care America is on financial precipice.		Not GFC2.		If USA loses Reserve Currency status, world in chaos, loses trillions, banks bust, savings gone, 401K worthless, war.		Trump free to think can solve it.
@gailsline @dwlove9 Man,		What a shot!		Who is the guy, beside the gorgeous woman?		Oh, USA President.		Lucky man.
@NBCNews @NBCFirstRead NBC,	What is boring is that the President of the USA has in 30 yrs increased his inheritance from $450m to $3.5bn, in the toughest real estate market on Earth.		USA $23Tn debt, he is man to fix it, but you nag him, waste 4 valuable years.		2026 China may = world Reserve currency.
@seanhannity Sean,		Push it.		I have a funny feeling Mueller not the problem, albeit that investigators acting for him have gone too far.		Just listening to Tom Petty "Waiting is the Hardest Part"	same here.		Can we have honesty in the process.		POTUS want to lift up USA, will they let him?
@washingtonpost President Trump is right.		Or have Americans forgotten that old saying:	'There are many ways to skin the cat'.		Get off his back.		Just think, if you did not hassle him, China fixed, infrastructure spending underway.		More Americans being trained, USA future assured, as a winner.
@StevieNicks 	Stephanie,	Well done on Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame.	Love you always girl.	You look great.	Sound better.	Robert Schofield.
To STEPHANIE NICKS		Congratulations sweetheart.		You were always in mine and millions of other people's: Hall of Fame.		Now you are in the real thing, Tom would have approved, and your Mum &amp; Dad would have been very proud.		"...and they are poets, but they are priests of nothing"
TRUMP vs Democrats		I can not understand Nancy Pelosi (78).		If she retires from Congress 2020 (80), why she seeks to:		1. Harm/divide USA by:	1.1: Leaving borders open?	1.2: Attacking President doing good for USA?		Instead of:	2. Leaving Congress with legacy of backing the WALL?
FOX - Judge Napolitano	Trump Guilt or Innocence.		Judge N. said Cohen Judge ruled POTUS committed felony.		Failed to point out Cohen Judge said C. proven liar.		Cohen claims POTUS knew it was campaign violation		POTUS says pay them, but not advised of violation.		I believe POTUS.
First Lady Melania Trump.	Ma'am,	You are seriously impressive, your work genuinely appreciated.		President Donald Trump can have no better person watching his back, and you do genuinely love USA for every thing it has opened up for you.		Carry on good work.		Merry Christmas

@chuckwoolery @pamela_blaylock Flynn &amp; FBI Abuse of Power.		You hit nail on head.

@esaagar @Rvndave @SebGorka @seanhannity Flynn POTUS Chief of Staff		Don't be ridiculous.		Bob Mueller is undergoing vetting.		POTUS says it will be long &amp; painful a rendition no less.

New Zealand	Minister of Justice	Honestly. Andrew Little.		NZ Govt takes Google to High Court over contempt.		Under urgency, NO Judge will endorse that contempt, 45 days High Court, 45 days CT. Of Appeal, 45 days SCONZ.		Fine: NZDS500 million.		On SCONZ ruling, 30 days to pay.
New Zealand	Minister of Justice	Honourable Andrew Little.	Google suppression breach		You state you can not enforce suppression orders on a foreign entity (Google)	You can.	Google operates in NZ.	Use contempt to:	1. Fine Google NZ.	or	2. Shutdown Google in NZ.	Threat will suffice.
President TRUMP - Issues	VOTERS - 2020.		Candidate Trump 2016, told you he would "drain swamp", doing it now.		Mueller investigation etc.. is how threatened "swamp" fights back.		Cohen, proven liar, slags Trump after light sentence.		Pelosi/Schumer deceive.		Trump in, 401K's up.
@Independent Nancy Pelosi	Really attractive, when 25 years younger.		Only reason she appeared to score verbal hits, is because Donald (72) Pelosi (78), he was being courteous to an older woman.		Trump still attracts younger good looking women (see 1st Lady); Pelosi, aged attracts criticism.
To Gemma &amp; Ritchie McGaw		Stunning news.	What a Christmas present.		Just imagine Ritchie,	Into a ruck or mail, and coming away with that little bundle of joy.		Definitely the touchdown and goal of both of your illustrious careers.		God Bless	Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @seanhannity @FoxNews Mr President,		You wife, First Lady Melania, came across as exactly that, a Lady.		Clearly you are a team.		The First Lady is measured, passionate, and careful.		Clearly no-one you would seek to annoy.		Very well done.		To you and your Family,	Have a very Merry &amp; Happy Christmas.
President Trump,		I have had a gutsful of glib Senator Charles Schumer.		He is now attacking you by saying you will shutdown the Government.		NO.		Upon Congress recess you have total discretion on length of adjournment.		Close Congress 2019.		No wall No Congress.		10 Senate votes
@davidaxelrod @realDonaldTrump You are a first-class stirrer.		You are not blind nor naive, you know people riding on coattails, get carried away.		Swept up in a campaign, a candidate not expected to win, a political novice, uses people used previously by others, who are no good.		Do you trust Cohen's word?
President Trump	Re: Cohen		You need to front foot this before Press make it up.		This is Cohen who was "strong arm" all over place, befpte he knew you, including making threats against children.		He is nothing but a thug.		Bad call hiring lowlife like this Rudy must nail Cohen
@DottieJoyner1 @CJHanselman @realDonaldTrump President Trump/Pence/Pelosi		Dottie	Mike Pence is there if needed, if things get out of hand.	For example, if Chuck Schumer got so riled up he shook his stick at POTUS, or if Nancy shook Chuck's stick.		Don't worry, Donald handled both of them easily.
@BarackObama @davidaxelrod President George.HW. Bush.	That funeral was something.	Nice to see you there.	Take care Mr President.	Why not back Trump on wall?

@realDonaldTrump 		President Trump	Last from me tonight.	God Bless.		Women paid by M. Cohen.		No-one focuses on how it happened, both women must have approached Cohen or you.		Why?	1 reason:	To blackmail you.		How?	Affairs 10 yrs ago.		You	Pay them		Him	No advice	Counsel failure.

@RealDrGina 	Thank you for your tweet.	To you and yours please have a Merry Christmas.
@RealDrGina In thanking you for your recent tweet to me, I scrolled through your recent history 		Your open borders &amp; no transparency comments, sound like deal offered by socialism.		Only, lack of transparency tends to impact domestic population, who also suffer from a lack of transparency.
@KatrinaPierson 	You have a very attractive face.		Now I know why Ted Cruz looks happy all the time.		Well done to both of you.
@QTAnon1 @DustyOldBooksS1 Trump Re-election 2020	After The President has:	1. Got wall underway.	2. Survived nonsense actions by Dem's/cronies.	3. Tax reform underway.

@Jenn198523 Proven, that is entrapment.	Everything is out.
@SenKamalaHarris @NancySinatra Trump Critic Kamala Harris		You have neither the good character or sound judgment to occupy The White House, let alone take shots at a man, who has:		1.

USA DODD - FRANK ACT	Mr Christopher Dodd.	You &amp; Barney as superb Rep's, moved USA forward, I am brassed off you take all credit.	2008-10 I sent 290 pg dossier to 320 (Congress, https://t.co/D34VtyFxTl,POTUS) pushing  changes.		My courier receipts as proof, predate Dodd/Frank work
@KyleKashuv @LaylaAlisha11 @davidhogg111 That is so vastly true.		Just on terrorist attacks, I can not remember the last time I heard of Catholics or Anglicans, Baptists, Jews, Mormons, Presbyterians being accused of savage acts of terrorism against innocents.		Why?	Because we want to live life.
@realDonaldTrump 		President Trump.		"The buck stops here".		Today, to the chagrin of Democratic leadership, over fixated stupidity, they allowed you, their modern day nemisis, to restore dignity &amp; power to The White House, in a single sound bite, yours:		"I will own that".		2020
@Alisonmau Because a lot of men are not, in the old fashioned sense of honour &amp; courtesy.		They are gutless.
@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump		1. Public airing WH meeting - Pelosi &amp; Schumer was brilliant, you boxed them in.		In context, I was expecting you to say:	"Nancy, Chuck, you're fired".		2. If not campaign funds violation, give aide $100, send carton of tissues to weeping Chuck.
@KatrinaPierson 	Donald never fails to surround himself with beautiful women, and you are NO exception.		Great smile, thanks for your tweet, and please Katrina, keep in touch 		Having a beautiful woman tweet me, makes me feel 10 feet tall.		God Bless
@Actibonnie 	Thank you Bonnie
@BillKristol Exactly.
Do what you have Mr President
TRUMP-Schumer-Pelosi	Read the Constitution.	1. President as C-in-C has an absolute duty with respect to issues of National Security, be they:	1.1. Physical.	1.2. Financial.	To use Executive Authority.	2. President in an argument can adjourn Congress in recess as long as he wants.
@JackPosobiec @Actibonnie Jack,	Given that is the situation, how is it, with Democrats insisting Sessions recuses himself, and Whittaker, and he refused to be pilloried; that Nadler, in accordance with House Rules, has not been required to recuse himself, and step aside.		He is a conflicted crook.
@LookingForGems @mitchellvii Do you mean you had any left.	Those two are idiots.
@steph93065 You are a little sweetie.	If only Govt was that easy.
President TRUMP		Well done 		You moved Schumer around until he took one of his feet out of his mouth, and stuck it in a cow pat, while you came up smelling of roses.		The thing I can't get is this.		You have built skyscrapers &amp; understand cost overruns, they can't build consensus
President TRUMP		Pelosi and Schumer are just not bright enough.		Send Congress home for 2019.
President TRUMP		White House Chief of Staff		3 alternate choices		1. Chuck Schumer.	Have plenty of tissues, cries a lot.		2. Nancy Pelosi.	Zero emission transport Greenie, needs cupboard for broom (Witch of West);	chaos assured		3. Michael Bloomberg	Closest he gets to Oval Office
@Tweets4DJT 	You run a good site.		Great feedback and articles.
@realDonaldTrump 	President TRUMP		President George Washington, would not hesitate to close Congress whole of 2019, in your position.		Conversation, with my ancestor Gen. Henry Knox:		"Well Henry?"		"Mr President, close Congress, this is not what we won in 1776 for".		"Ok Henry".
@elonmusk Eion,	Well said.	The years of the combustion engine in mass transportation use, is gone.	How are you on picking up GM's plant, to increase capacity and lower sale price pointing for consumers?
@realDonaldTrump President TRUMP		Put Congress into a Recess for all of 2019.		It has been done before.		To those who do not wish to represent the safety interests of their constituents.		Send the children to their Home States for 2019.		Order, as you can, NO DC access

@realDonaldTrump 	President Trump.		On light-hearted but serious note:	Phil Collins &amp; Phillip Bailey sang about	The Chinese Wall.		That has protected China for some time.		What, are Americans going to be second to China.		If they do not give you the money, send the children home.
VETERAN'S MORTGAGES	Tunnel to Tower Foundation		Mark Wahlberg.		This organisation pays off the debt on mortgages for families of veterans killed in service?		What a brilliant initiative.		You are not my favourite actor, though I do like what you act in.		But this, makes you TOPS!
@realDonaldTrump 	President TRUMP		YOU CAN NOT LOSE		You put Congress in Recess for 2019, they can not from Home States use technology to put together a quorum.		Albeit devised in another era CONSTITUTION conveys the intent Congress recessed as can not be relied upon.		Good Luck!

@EdKrassen 	Thank you for your tweet.		You are such a contrarian, I guess even if a lot of things are fixed by Trump you could not give him credit.		Shame, that is called civility, it a marker of intelligence.

President Trump.	Watching MSNBC I can not believe drivel, they query 2016 win.	Hillary odds less Secretariat in Belmont &amp; like him you won.		Get on front foot, get your base energized.		On State Budgets given jobs, if Dem's don't fund $5Bn,can States offer bonds to get $? 		Easy.
Mr President,		James Comey.		As President, do you have the power to ask SCOTUS to Order Comey to undertake a psychiatric evaluation prior to him being back before House.		I seriously believe he is "delusional &amp; self idolizing" i.e: a narcissist, his testimony that of a nutcase.
@V_actually @DejackomeLisa Absolutely,		You get stuck into him.		The ultimate oxymoron.		He is Ranking Member on the House Intelligence Com.		He could not follow trail of dragged log through wet mud.		But he is a vindictive little sh--, I mean Schiff.

President Trump		Be careful.		Democrats are after blood, yours.		They say you're corrupt.		What was there to hush up?		10 year old affairs!		Those are not crimes.		Are Dem's saying, if voters learned you had affairs they would not have voted 4 you?		You need a SCOTUS ruling.

@RichardDawkins Mr Dawkins,	For years you have played a hand in intelligent discourse.		Yet in one article, you show yourself to be a poorly researched moron.		Donald Trump, has books &amp; interviews 30+ years ago, to prove he has strong views on leadership &amp; USA.		Finally he had to act, &amp; did.
President Trump.		Why is it that:		1. Republican:	Members of Congress, supporters, strategists, analysts etc..		Look on top of their game, smiling yet focused.		While		2. Democrats	Present &amp; past of all hues, eg: Pelosi, Schumer, Comey etc...		Look washed out, washed up.		Losers

Clearly loyal &amp; international contact book.
President Trump		Mauri's Show		Just saw a clip from 2000 where Donald gave money to a little girl and her Mum.		Everyone should watch it.		He was a private citizen.		As Maurice says, most generous person he knows.		This is who Dem's hate.		Hillary &amp; Pelosi give, us all headaches.

@nytmike 	Hello Mr Schmidt,	Thank you for your tweet.	Would you like a copy of the Brief of Proposal 8E which I will be forwarding to Donald Trump.		Then you can be properly informed &amp; act accordingly.		If the answer is Yes DM me.
@mattgaetz 	Matt,	Thank you for your tweet.		You appear to be a sensible forthright younger man.		Everyone of commonsense &amp; decency is celebrating, remembering &amp; lamenting the life of former President George HW. Bush.		You can not match him, but live by his example, act for USA.
@DustyOldBooksS1 	Thanks.	Can not figure out how this happens.	Corrupt.
@DustyOldBooksS1 	Thank you
@politicalnutcr1 	Thank you
@TiwariLalmani 	Thank you
@GrassrootsSpeak You really make no sense.		Wages are moving up at a rate unseen for decades.		Those same people are paying less tax.		401K's are up in value.		Who are you,	Wealthy?	Idle rich?		To suggest POTUS in bed with Russians is ludicrous.		Just like you.
@IngrahamAngle 	You run a great show.	Get Ivanka as a guest!
@JulieReichwein1 @LaylaAlisha11 @POTUS President Trump &amp; Pence	Rumour Pence to be replaced.		What rubbish.		Mike Pence is loyal, looks good, speaks well, brilliant 2- i-C, great speech maker, loyal.		6 more years
@TheOfficerTatum @Actibonnie And the remaining 68% can be found within Democratic Party ranks in Congress.
@anniekarni I guess Hillary will need all of her friends in House with Donald's new A-G.		Because Hillary knows with this ex-George H.W. Bush lawyer she has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, for he will leave	"No holds barr-ed"
COMEY - House 	Representative ISSA	Is time before GOP cedes to Democrats, to issue proceedings against him, on grounds of false or misleading evidence.		Comey NO longer Director	Did FBI counsel suggest his answers compromise ongoing investigation?		Will they finish under Dem's.
@seanhannity @dwlove9 Sean,	If they do not ask Comey why he said under Oath in contradiction of his alleged Memo's on White House talks with POTUS	1. Written	There were very few.	2. Oral	There were so many........		They are both Official record Under Oath, one or both are Perjury to pervert justice.
@NancyPelosi Mrs Pelosi,	After many years not House speaker, can you GROW UP.		Job numbers not large, U/E same low, wage growth high, means:	1. USA economy strong, not enough staff, competition in wages.		2. Training, upskilling, great for poor, school leavers.		This creates opportunity.
President Trump.		Congratulations on your pick of Mr William Barr for the position of USA Attorney General.		This man Former President George H. W. Bush, placed his trust in, as his A-G, and through to today he has never betrayed that trust, nor will he.		Great pick, well done.
President Vladimir Putin	USA - Russian friendship.		WW2, the bravery of Russian soldiers from East &amp; Allied push (USA) saw greatest "pincer" move in history, end of 3rd Reich.		Please knock action on head 		USA Russia's mate, you know it.		Ring Donald.		Be JFK to Nikita Kruschov.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Go to the Comey hearings.	Your right.		Receive permission from House Senior Rep allow you to attend and question.		Ask him why Memo entries on conversations with you number of Clinton emails different to later testimony		Fabrication of evidence to pervert justice
@DustyOldBooksS1 	Thanks.		Retweet it to everyone now!
FOX NEWS - COMEY	News ALERT		President Trump.		Under the Constitution there is NOTHING in law to stop President Trump appearing at the Congressional hearing and asking extra judicial questions.		Both in examination and in cross.		Imagine that.
FOX &amp; FRIENDS - Comey	ALERT!		Congressman says Comey presided over dysfunctional FBI, worst in years.		Mueller Head before him.		Given FBI global reach, if so disorganized, who oversees checks on Directors causing agent deaths in-the-field?		Are Mueller/Comey covering each other?
President Trump	HELP	To the GM worker on FOX who asked Donald for help.		He will if he can.		Ask how deceitful Democrats and supporters can be.		Notice GM announcement not in play until after midterms, with President now powerless to act on his own.		Know this, Dem's won't help.
President George W. Bush,		Today, you said "ta-tah" to your Dad in the best possible way, the Texas way.		Not so much a goodbye, as "See you another day".		"You know you can always tell a Texan, you just can't tell 'im much".		To you &amp; entire Bush Family,		Well done &amp; God Bless.
@ArianaGrande We love u 2, to u.		So good.
TRUMP-Mueller-Cohen	MSNBC	I do not believe claptrap on channel, commentators of varied experience engaged in espousing hypothetical rubbish.	If they know contents of Mueller's Final Report before release they &amp; he should be jailed.	If this lasts for Trump's Term	be very ashamed.
@VanJones68 	Van,	DM me will you.	You part of Criminal Justice Reform.	My Proposal 8E creates 30m new USA jobs over 10 years,	2-2.5m off Food Stamps. Fresh Start key to recidivism	Q.	No. released convicts in US?	How many unemployed?		Clear opportunity to absorb 500K to 1million
@Redtowel4 @ellen78834490 Love your comment.		Previously I had said 	"Lemon by name, Lemon by nature"	But as you brilliantly pointed out:	Lemons are bitter, or, tart.	Well done.
@thecjpearson @malibujonfanti @realDonaldTrump Pearson For Trump.		Today a man was laid to rest who acted in accordance with his own judgment, and as you know, he was a brave:	WW2 veteran, CIA boss, VP, President, Proud Father and a loving, faithful, Husband.		Back your judgment.		2016 Democrats lost, still they are whining.
@TeamPelosi 	Team Pelosi	Is this address officially sanctioned by the Democratic Party and/or Mrs Nancy Pelosi herself, please?
FOX NEWS - TUCKER	Subject: DT sacking Mueller		Your female guest wrong.		1. Under National Security	President can fire anyone.	2. Sessions n/a no longer A/G.	3. Acting A/G - no Congressional appt., so by default POTUS has power.	4. SCOTUS backs POTUS.		You ask SCOTUS.	Your right.
@GOPChairwoman Ronna,	Could you Direct Message me, as a matter of urgency.	Thank you
@RealErinCruz @JudyMoo64479187 MUSLIM ATTACK on bus	In and of itself this appears harmless.	Until, consider this:	In UK there has been an alarming number of people blinded by random acid attacks.	Had that liquid sprayed been acid, enough to blind this matter could not be laughed at.	That woman should be warned
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Good luck.		Make sure their promises locked in unable to be reneged upon.		China now knows weak post-talk talk release worth 600 PTS Day 1, plus Net 100 Day 2, on DOW.		Clearly significant promise made, enacted, then retracted, more damaging.		Make USA insulated.
@WSJ WSJ - China cancel Boeing		Question	Did Chinese having placef order, gain access to technology?		Could default be because bled electronics, avionics out of product to replicate?		Or could default be China is running out of cash &amp; why they in trade talks with DT?		Is China broke?
@GOPChairwoman GOP Chairwoman Ronna		Terrible analogy, but must be made.		"Talk about flogging a dead horse"		On that basis:	Can we accuse Democrats of Cruelty to Dumb Animals?	Answer:	That is no way to refer to:	Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, or (Pocohontas).		Just don't refer to them at all.
@SenSanders 	Mr Sanders,	Thank you for tweet.		IDEOLOGY or IDIOCY	Believe you wish help USA.		2020 too old, another Nader.		Switch.	To help young people, ditch Dem's, go to Donald, ask him for Secretary for US Youth (under 21).		Do now, you get.		After his 2020 win, irrelevant.
@VanJones68 	Mr Jones,		Thank you for your tweet.		Three weeks ago, you stood with DT, in support Criminal Justice Reform.		You have been attacked.		CJR is now held up by Dem's no reason, except DT push.		Call Dem's out to A/A voters.		Respond to me with access to DM you please.
@thehill 	Thank you for your tweet.	Have been watching your headlines of late, and you are not as biased as I had believed you to be.	Keep it up.	There is no reason why Fox should have signing rights to Fair &amp; Balanced, all media should be irrespective of its angle.	Well done!
@RealJamesWoods 	Thank you for your tweet.
@anniekarni 	Thank You Annie Karni.	What have you thought of this past week?	America certainly knows how to send off a Former President, and much deserved.
@nedprice 	Hi Ned,	Thank you for the courtesy of your tweet.		This week fascinating, unlike ever before, the real end of an era, no more WW2 Presidents-shame.		Donald is doing OK!		Very concerned China now knows, weak post-talk releases, can damage DOW.		DT must fix this danger.
@margarettalev 	Hi Margaret,	Thank you for your tweet.	I would love to see Michael opposed to Donald in 3 debates.	One on one, those debates would be rivetting, critically focused on issues, which is what America needs now.
@MikeDorning 	Thanks Mike for your tweet.		Your Owner throwing his hat, tentatively in ring.		I pray he pursues, as there is no doubt he is smart/driven.		Clearly could be Perot to Donald Trump, but I prefer him as Democrat.		If only 2 in debates will be brilliant, on issues.
@politicalnutcr1 		Thanks Wesley,		That was a heck of a service.		I can only assume it will be bigger and better in Texas.		I pray the media allow the Texas version some privacy.	George is a Texan, and this loss to him cuts deeper than all bar one 		Have a great day.
President George W. Bush.		George,		That was a fine service.		You did your Father proud.		Your Father and your Mother would both be very proud of the way you carried yourself.		You are your Fathers' Son.		God Bless.
NEWS ALERT	President Bush Funeral.		Just saw John Bolton talking with Dick Cheney.		First thought.		Iran, you are in real trouble, if you do not start acting on the world stage, with decency.		Just remember, the USA helped you, after the deadly earthquake which killed thousands.
President George H.W. Bush.		All commentators.	You ask how he did things.		Understand this in context.		When he went to Yale it was:	1. Harvard.	2. Oxford.	3. Cambridge.	4. Yale.	5. Princeton.	6. Sorbonne.		He finished in 2.5 years.		IQ would be 180-185.		He was a relaxed genius.
@realDonaldTrump Are you following my tweets.	Be careful Donald.		When you see 8E Brief, you will see that it:	1. Strengthens USA, in all ways, financially etc.	2. Offers you access to the young and green vote for 2020.		Take care.
President George W. Bush,		Sorry.		Today, say everything.		He was, is, and will always be Dad.		Respects to you and all of the Bush Family.		God Bless you.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump.		Well done on handshake with former President George W. Bush.		Move forward together for good of America.		Remember, due to Enron, President Bush (43) enacted two brave biz moves:	1. Directors sign Annual Reports.	2. Shut Arthur Anderson, No1 Firm.		God Bless.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump		Just be very careful.		I have seen it with New Zealand dependency upon China buying exports.		China now knows non-filing of a definitive statement on trade progress causes major market upheaval, and that USA economy is vulnerable to leverage 		You must stop that
@WeAreOne_Q Silently.
@realDonaldTrump You are doing well.	Be very careful.	Just saw Maggie Haberman on CNN, one of these experts on everything, and she dropped a clanger.	Democrats	See you will likely win 2020, so they are focused on 2024 so are having a go at Ivanka.	Be very careful, there is no limit to their envy.
@dcrow_baby 	Mueller is a strong character.	I pray he proves to be anything other than that being talked about.	In other words, does his job, produces findings that leave no loose ends.	No room for would-be experts to hypothesize 	There is either proof or no proof.	God Bless.
@PennyHicks13 	Thanks.
@dcrow_baby 	Thank you Deanna.
@TheVijayMallya Mr Vijay Mallya,	It is a long time since you had the "Battered Bull".		I pray your investment into niche brewing in the USA has gone well, and that you are well also.		The KingFisher is well named.		Kind regards.		Email:	robert.schofield58@gmail.com
President George W.H. Bush.	Bob Dole - Rush Limbaugh		Great comments you made.	What a display of courage of charging the gates of hell by Bob Dole today.		You are right, and at 95, like my Dad(97), they are a different breed.		Pres. Bush flew Pacific, saving NZ., our love to him.
President Trump	Mueller Probe-Intention		I have bad news for you, lest this blows it for Democrats, hope it does.		Mueller is going to let this go through to the period of Nominations for 2020.		House Dem's will file to impeach, to stop you standing for re-election.		Dirty pool.
FOX - TUCKER CARLSON		Few weeks until Dem House.		Their Focus: 	USA - Trump impeachment?		My question	2yrs after Clinton loss surely time enough to resolve issue  		Mueller is investigator, if Democrats try directing Mueller they will be guilty of perversion of justice.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	I respect you and trust you.		Now you have to get US$5bn to build a decent wall.		USA no good without strong border.		Note	My 3rd major US ancestor James Knox Polk annexed Texas into Union after the Alamo.		But without Sam Houston??		Southern States critical to 8E.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,		You are right.		My Proposal 8E self funds.		Consider:	Big change = big $$.		8E multiple income streams, profits = way pay for it		Energy now costs too much to build &amp; use.		8E is built/expanded w/wide investors buy in on bourse.		GrRev&amp;GP fund ROI/Investment/growth
Mr President.		I never realized Former GOP Head, ex-Gov. Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour still alive		Contact Haley, he can confirm I approached him first with an unsophisticated version of Proposal 8E at the end of 2008 just prior to GFC and 2009 GOP Governor's forum.		God Bless
President Trump	Fixing: Crown Prince Selman		Answer easy, Saudi Arabia still buys US goods thwarts Iran &amp; does good.		Use SWIFT	Seize 12 mths Oil revenues.	Deduct proveable SA costs.		Balance	UNHCR for humanitarian aid, worldwide incl: Yemen	If info is so strong MBS lied.		Do it!
@1776Stonewall 	Do you know how President Andrew Jackson saved USA?		DT is doing same thing here and now.		Can you imagine their false outrage when Donald Trump get re-elected.		I can hear the whining down here already, and it is such a sweet sound.
President George W. Bush,		You may not see this, as not known tweeter, like 45th.		Today you say farewell, not to 41, but to your Dad, the man you love.		In this last time of publicly speaking to your Father, be honest with him, tell it as it is, leave nothing unsaid.		God Bless.
Kate Beckinsale		A friend sent me images on a site called Pinterest.		Some were of you, in various outfits, and breathtaking.		I am very firmly convinced you are the most beautiful woman I have seen in 30yrs.		Please direct message me, or email me to:	robert.schofield58@gmail.com
@Sherry40614670 Thanks Sherry.
@GOPChairwoman 	Please Direct Message me.	I will expand on this as and where required, directly with you.
@GOPChairwoman @nancy73gg I presume you mean State Legislature.		There is a way to stop that, but it is very complex, and I would like you to tell DT I told you.		As a State it draws Federal Funds in Appropriations income, simply if it funds "illegals" DT Exec.Order. stopping Ca. getting any Federal Funds

But, Obama took my "silver bullet"solution 2010, said "no silver bullet" there is, Proposal 8E.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	You are doing really well.		Plus, your handling of the ceremony with respect to paying tribute to President George Herbert Walker Buah, has been first-class.
@Sherry40614670 	Hi Sherry,		Thank you for your tweet.	Sad time with passing of President George Herbert Walker Bush.		I do not know how you feel, I have living Father (97) who served 1939-1945, in North Africa (Al Elamein) &amp; Italy (Monte Cassino), so I may be biased.		God Bless.
@derekjGZ @realDonaldTrump President Trump - Responsibility for Nuclear Deployment.		Sonny, this is not a b/s B Grade movie, lot more safeguards in system than you know.		Anyone declaring they know is liar, or faces life in jail for treason.		Donald has finger on, I trust him implicitly.	He would not miss.
@jgm41 @GOPLeader Dog is man's best friend.	Noticed	Excluding:	Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, all other Presidents have ridden horses.		The animal most responsible for man's advances through the ages.		Not a bad combination, a dog and a horse, America rose with them as bosom buddies.		RIP GHW Bush
Era of President GHW Bush		On YouTube saw interview by Maria Menounas of Barbara Eden.		Everyone older will recall the sight of a scantilly clad (for the era) beautiful girl, acting alongside Larry Hangman (JR Dallas) making us laugh.		Barbara is still gorgeous.	Now GHWB is gone.
Mr President		Mueller/Cohen deal.	You have Power to unwind.		If Cohen no jail, use Corsey claim, Order A-G to petition SCOTUS on plea deal use as coercion to get false evidence.		That Act is Collusion, which is grounds to overturn any judgment. Special Counsel ruling = judgment.
Sean Hannity	President George.W.H.Bush.	You say some media deride his courage, they are liars.	GWHB volunteered 1941, at time Allies no major win over Axis Powers (1st 1942, then Al Elamein 1943).		GWHB did not know if he would live, that is courage.	Please use	Yr Father&amp;Mine=WW2
President Trump	Sir,	In week a brave, principled, honest, decent, President is being eulogized, &amp; laid to rest, you must act.		Your JFK-Cuba moment.		Invite Russian President Putin to bilateral meeting at Camp David (3 days) speak to Kissenger &amp; Baker.		Mueller can not run you!
@SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan.		You spoke very well, with a youthful exuberance, the late President himself would have loved.		You paid respectful tribute to a unique man, before a gathering of yesteryear and today, and you did it well.
Tribute to President Bush		FOX Show		Martha MacCullum		Nice show, sad day.	Very respectful.	Very insightful.	Very impressed.
@GaileyGirrl 	Thanks Gail.		President Bush, what a true American hero.	73 years married, a man who gave his vows, with his wife, who kept them, and their love, all his life.	Good looking, distinctive, whip smart, determined, with courage and an ability to organize, unparalleled.
President George H.W. Bush.		End of an era.	Beautiful, truthful, eulogies spoken in memory, in praise in thanks, for the life and service of former President Bush.		Given the defining event of the 20th Century was World War Two, this last President of that era, was very special.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President		Mexican Border Wall		For the life of me, I can not understand, how any fellow Americans, most especially those in Public Office do not want to secure the Southern Border &amp; do it properly.		I pray Senator Schumer will recognize his public duty and support you in this
President Trump	Your provision of Air Force One to carry casket of 41st President of the United States of America, President George H. W. Bush was first class.		President Bush would have gladly acknowledged it.		I pray George W. shakes your hand at service.		Very well done.
@thehill @TheHillOpinion Juan Williams.		5th columnist.		How can you, at time when:	1. China will be back in fold.	2. Post-Brexit UK free of EU debts good for USA.	3. Post-Brexit EU27 will need good USA FTA, they are broke.		To suggest a USA downturn is deliberate deflationary talk, economic stupidity.

@DanBender_SJ @ksager @amirmehrabi @BarbiHeller @avb8221 @jack16arm @shannonhadd3 @amgonzo73 @ilyaskhan544999 Hello Dan,	Thank you for honor.	I believe Eion given rough treatment.		He is suffering, as if a tortured genius.		Doubtless Eion has kept most of his stock.		Do not hesitate to DM me, to get my private contact details so you can send me an Info Mem.		Always interested, thank you.
America		Your patriotism to the fallen, speaks volumes to the character of the United States of America.		You are the most benevolent, and forgiving nation this world has ever seen.		"Shining Beacon" on a hill,	Yes, you are, and that light still burns at her brightest.		God bless
President Bush's Dog.	I pray the dog is going with the casket to Washington.		NOT separate.		That would break the dog's heart, and President Bush.		Just remember:	Dog is man's best friend.
NEWS ALERT	President George.H.W.Bush		Just received direct message from a frequent tweeter, who tweeted, they used to be a Bush supporter until they woke up to fact they are corrupt.		Sender ID:	Lexy@politically.yrt		Some have no brains nor any decency she believes Moore rubbish!
@HorseRacingCOO @Rvndave France has been TRUMPED!		Magnificente!
@BillKristol Trump House losses were relatively small.		2020 they will reverse back to GOP, as voters see how frustratingly stupid Dem's have become.		By 2020, Americans will see their pocketbook and USA accounts have turned corner.		That will finish Democrats for 12 years (4 DT, 8 Ivanka).
@SteveWinst57 @SkySportsNews President Trump	Can you govern to 2020?		Senior Democrats confirm, they will not sign:	1. Trade Agreement replacing NAFTA.	2. Criminal Justice reform.		Debt ceiling bill, will be near impossible		F/Father's foresaw drama, why you have power to close Congress, &amp; Order out of DC.
President Trump - Alert	Not satisfied the Mueller Probe will find nothing.		Left leaning journalists are now pushing that a market downturn is coming.		This is nothing short of economic treason.
President George H.W. Bush.		Vice-President Cheney and	Secretary of State Baker.		Just saw you interviewed by Chris Wallace.		You two still epitomize why President Bush was able to do things he did.		He assembled a top team &amp; as a great trail boss, headed it in right direction.
@Tweets4DJT Hi Christine,	Your tweet is shocking.		Canada has looked on the rise, you are saying, illusion.		Tell me is this chap Trudeau no better than his Dad Pierre proved to be.		You too young, Pierre was world's No1 womanising playboy		Maybe this new Trump deal good for Canada as well.
@TiwariLalmani I was involved in major Oz defence project 1990's.		Oz has US$1.1tn economy, with large country &amp; 26 million people, Oz first priority is to stop illegal border entry.		So major spend on coastal patrol boats, but Australia has major submarine fleet.		Never under estimate Oz.
@IvankaTrump Ivanka Trump.		You watch your step.		Members of the Democratic Party are going to keep at you, as the proxy for DT.		Bluntly,	Listening to fawning Dem's seeking to invoke George H.W. Bush's ethics as their own, is as low as they could go, sick.		Current older Dem's traitors.
President Trump Deals		Who does Rep.Cartwright (D-PA) think he is?		1. Suggesting reigning in key moves DT is making which	1.1. Reduce deficit.	1 2. Keeps momentum	2. Invoking Late-Presidents' name.		2020, if Dem's try stopping Trump, they will lose House and Presidency.
@ABC @GStephanopoulos Rep Schiff,		What is going on?		You are Ranking Member on House Intelligence Committee.		Robert Mueller as Special Counsel was sworn to investigate.		Clearly Mr Mueller places his findings on record.		Are you worried:	1. No collusion?	2. Democrats unable to tamper with evidence?
@TiwariLalmani About 12.	Clearly, all nuclear powers go ahead of Australia, but Oz does have a strong navy (subs) and airforce, plus while small in number, Oz soldiers are very effective.		USA, Russia, China, India, Canada, UK, France, Pakistan, North Korea, Japan, Australia.
G.H.W.Bush.	Oz PM visit, how is WH?	Bob Hawke, happy, how GB?	GB calls in Quayle.	Q:You're Father's Son, sister brother, none, you are Dan?	I'm me. Good Dan.	Hawke in Oz calls DPM, Paul you're Father's Son, sister/brother none, you are Paul?	Bob I'm me.	No Paul, you're Dan Quayle
@ukgirl420 Al Sharpton Scandal		You are brilliant.		Is this not the Sharpton Nancy Pelosi said deserved thanks for saving the USA?		Saving the USA?		From what?		I suppose, with his charity involved it may be for a small book run.		Saving USA from increased strokes, brought on by his rubbish
President George H.W.Bush.		It is a shame it takes the death of a truly great American patriot &amp; servant, to bring temporary respite to the vitriol preceding his sad passing.		Would it not be nice to have as his legacy, restoration of the civility, yet resoluteness, he espoused.
Mr President.	Donald Trump.		President George H.W.Bush.		You know, and I know, you can make human miracles happen, you have done so.		3 days to organize 25 USAF equipped transport planes USA-wide to take WW2 vets to GHWB DC service.		Your tribute, he was their Commander-in-Chief.
Pope Francis		You rule a faith which has at times acted disgracefully.		Whether it be:	1. Spanish Inquisition	Where your priests tortured 6,7,8,9,10 year old girls/boys for being children.	2. Sexual abuse by priests.	Again of children.		Now you seek to advise USA	No	Silencio.
President William Jefferson Clinton.	I just saw you talk about the late-President George H.W. Bush, to Brit Hume.		What you said, was clearly meant, and well said.		G.H.W.B is the last President of an era, we must always be grateful for, but hopefully never need to see again.
President George W. Bush.	Your Dad	President George H.W. Bush.		My WW2 Dad (now 97), lost his wife (92) in 2014, year in Italy, with Prince Harry, he  commemorated 70th Anniversary Battle of Monte Cassino.		They lost my twin older sisters to thalidomide poisoning.	Special people.
@Linda35864239 	Great tweet.	He is right.
@Susrez 	Veterans @ President Bush State Funeral.		Thank you for your tweet in support.		Passing of President Bush such headline event, as many talk about service, it would be nice to see many who served, not rich enough to do so, in attendance.		Good use Presidential Fund.	Kind.
@JebBush @marcorubio My condolences to you Jeb Bush.		You must now grieve deeply.		Your Father very bright man.		Talk of Desert Storm, but no one talks about how it was so well organised and over so quick, no USA combat deaths.		Jeb, at service, lay hand on him please, for all the WW2 veterans.
@georgepbush My Dad fought WW2, at 97 in reasonable health albeit scares.		Served https://t.co/hgXzn1txMG &amp; Italy (El Alamein, Monte Cassino).		Had Uncle fought with you Yanks in Pacific (Bougainville, Guadacanal).	All hell holes.		Your GrandFather special man, from special era.		We are lucky
@SenBobCorker Senator Corker		One reason why you are detested by many, is due to you having no moral compass.		Even in a supposed message of condolence and tribute, you use it to have a shot, at President Trump, on unity.		The late-President Bush was a decent man, you are neither.		Not today.
@Education4Libs @StorinoCarmella You are not meant to notice that.
@BetteMidler 		President George HW Bush		Bette Midler.	On the day we remember an age of hardship which forged reason, from the Great Depression, through WW2 to all since.		Is that tweet really appropriate?		And are the contents acceptable?		Miss Midler, demonstrate some class.
@realDonaldTrump President George H.W. Bush		WW2 veterans diminish in number daily.		President Bush to have State Funeral.		One-off opportunity, to fly, accommodate, feed, those WW2 veterans at service.		Bearing health in mind maybe 8,000 men at $10,000 cost/person.		Could use Presidential Fund.

President George H.W. Bush		To those of you too young to know Desert Storm, Gulf War One, know this.		Saddam Hussein's troops/tanks attacked Kuwait, killed &amp; raped thousands, beaten polluted air &amp; Gulf setting 2200 oil rigs on fire.		Coalition 500,000 from 60+ nations fixed.
President George W. Bush		I offer my sincerest wishes of condolence to you.		Forever, now, in the past. and in the future, you will always be your Father's Son.		George, you only ever have one Dad.		When your Dad has his legacy, what a source of pride, what a standard.		God Bless
@georgeisinhell 	You disgusting good for nothing bum.		George H.W. Bush reacted to the act of a murdering swine Saddam Hussein attacking a defenceless Kuwait City.		You, and people in Iraq had  38 years while he was in power to overthrow him, but you did not have the guts.
@FLOTUS To The First Lady,		You are a real sweetie.		America lost a treasure, a man impossible to replace.		Few World War 2 veterans are left, from war which killed 60-80 million.		America must give him the grandest, yet simplest of State Funerals, a Soldiers' sendoff.		He earned it.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews Mr President.		I missed Hannity live will find.		Donald,		Nice remarks on passing of Former President George Herbert Walker Bush.		He was from special era.		For Vets	Please get their computer system replaced, dedicate in G.H.W.Bush's memory.		State Funeral.	No man earned it more.
President George H.W. Bush 	You, like my Father, served in WW2 to give us peace.		Gulf War 1, you set highest standard for Generals (Schwarzkof, Le Bailliere) in charge of largest armed forces post WW2.		No combat coalition soldiers killed.		Go to your beloved wife.	Rest in Peace
@realDonaldTrump Mr President.		You must meet with Vladimir Putin.		For detente, and because he will be under increasing Politburo pressure given his retirement 2024.		Plus ask him release sailors.		Otherwise	You will be perceived as a President vulnerable to adverse Press coverage.		Not you.
@kevincorke @madmamma4 G20 - President Trump		The Democrats won't like it.	The Trump's are in town.	Donald is there to do a deal.	and	The 46th President of USA is at G20 (Ms. Ivanka Trump),	not until 2024.	4 major female players G20.	Merkel, May, LeGarde(IMF), and Ivanka.	No man will refuse her wishes.
@GrassrootsSpeak Ms Greene,	Your demand the Trump's pay back perceived monies spent on them.		Grow up.		Do you remember	1. He donates his salary to charity.	2. Costs for Mar e Lago are met by him.		Grow up!
@CorinneMCH @realDonaldTrump Corinne,	What are you raving about?	President Trump	1. Is rich.	2. Stays rich by smart spending.	3. Russia, obvious place to put Hotel for high net worth people (Moscow).		Did not go ahead, so what.		Interesting point, why would Russia not offer sweetheart deal to Trump.		No deal
@tthompie @madmamma4 New York Women Pay For Tape Kits after the assault?		Tell us all, was this policy put in place under Michael Bloomberg?		If so, was this a cost cutting part of his budget.		If so, that is not American!
@BillOReilly Correct
@RogueFirstLady Robert Mueller - is he Gay?	Who knows.	Who cares.	He must be		Why?		Well,,,he investigates then implicates everyone without concrete evidence, so maybe little Bobby Mueller is gay.		I do certainly know one thing after Donald Trump's written answers, he is NOT happy.		Tough.
@RogueFirstLady 	You very bad imitation Lady First in House of White.		Question.		You believe that little Bobby (Mueller), has he come out, on being gay.		Use him in House of White, on Christmas Tree, as the Fairy.		Maybe he grant wish.		Yeah, little Bobby, when are you finished.
@dcrow_baby 	Thanks Deanna.	Crazy,	Mueller thinks he has default power over the President.	For a GOP Bush appointed FBI Director, he is a quizzling
@realDonaldTrump Mr President.		Your Constitutional powers.	1. Order Congress closed.	2. Order Members home.	3. Congress no quorum.		4. Reason behind Orders:	4.1. Govt Budget = Federal.	4.2. Members - State Rep's, but no Congress.		National Security	Border/Budget vested in your Executive Orders.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President		Donald Trump.	Ignore critics.		You have 2 years to prove you.		Congress a joke. Members should be Ordered to 1 week soup kitchens feeding poor.		Fund wall, National Security, "dreamers" same way.		Congress closed, no quorum, purpose of Constitution.	Pass own Budget.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	Veto Bill, if you so choose.		1. Close Congress indefinitely.	2. Under Constitution	2.1 Run by Executive Order.	2.2 Order Congress closed	2.3 Amend Bill, National Security.	3. Seek SCOTUS ruling  Spec.Counsel right to coerce 4. Presidential warning Mueller conduct.
@realDonaldTrump @LibertyNow10 Mr President	Good luck with Putin.		Mueller,		Sir, you are sworn Defender of Constitution.		A cornerstone, life &amp; liberty.		Any Probe coercion is in violation of those rights.		Given proof (see Court case) post-probe, charge Mueller for violating Sp.C. Oath of Office, &amp; jail him.
@coton_luver @DannyAShea GOP - Russian Money	What a load of rubbish.		How dare you make such a statement &amp; not have shred of evidence to back it up.		Be very aware of your fellow Americans, of type who fought &amp; won Independence.		When Mueller report shows nothing on POTUS, 2020 Dem House majority gone
@BillKristol Mr Kristol,	At best you are world-class.	At worst rabble rouser.		President Trump not guilty of any criminal acts.		When is GOP POTUS to get fair go at fixing USA?		Sen. McCain's daughter at service, said USA is great, but USA is decaying, and is debt-ridden.		Let Trump fix it.
Fox&amp;Friends - Sean Hannity	URGENT		Me	You raised obvious, but did not see connection.	You	Media publishing stolen material from unknown source.		Q.	What if unknown source = Hillary Clinton?	Why wash equipment = to hide her treason?		Me.	Libya ended her career, is Mueller revenge?
Speaker Ryan,	All the critics do not count.		When you have a portrait on the wall you are now an historic fact for all of time.		Critics can not rewrite history.		Good luck with your future.
President Vladimir PUTIN	G20 Summit - POTUS		Armistice Day Remembrance - Paris.		I saw your friendly touch to President Trump.		Mr Putin, WW2, Russia lost 23 million people, too many.		Be kind, release the Ukraine sailors, to meet Donald.		World needs Russia, we need you, do it!
@ABC What a shame.		All in the prime of their lives.		Rest in Peace
@Independent President Trump tweets.		And like sheep you follow.		Do you not have any creative flair to respond, have media cutbacks so gutted your prime talent, the balance can not think of a response.		Donald is having a dig at you, it is near Christmas, and you and your kind BITE.		Relax.
@TheIndyFilm @Independent Mr Tarantino,	Hope it is not your screenplay, it is a wedding, so violence is out, well of the malicious kind, so no pulling AK47's out of wedding cakes.		You make memorable movies, may you both make beautiful music together for the rest of your lives.		May the Peace be with you.
@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Mr President,		Fox &amp; Friends just paid tribute to 3 USA servicemen who paid with their lives to keep us safe and at peace.		Two GI's saved my Father's life, as a NZ soldier in Italy in WW2 or I would not be here.		To the Families of those lost, they gave, so we live.	What a gift.
@Tweets4DJT Oh Christine,		That is disgraceful.	If no possibility of mistake.	Death penalty, ASAP.		That lady deserves nothing less.		To Mrs Sollowin's Family,		No words, no deed can make up the emptiness you will be feeling, so very sorry.		May God be with you.		This is just shocking.
@NancyPelosi @HouseDemocrats Mrs Pelosi,	For good of USA and unity, pay respect by remembering when your Party was not openly backing you, the nemesis of Democrats, President Trump said GOP will back you as:	1. You deserve it.	2. He can work with you.	For USA, do so.		DT not just winning close Senate seats.
Mr President.	When you criticized the Fed for raising interest rates.		Multitude of critics said you had made another wrong call, as rate rises do not slow growth.		Mr Powell now suggested he may take breather to assess impact.		This says to all Americans, you know field of play.
Thanks Deanna.
@BillKristol "I did not have sexual relations with that woman".		Guess Dem's lie so much, when Republican tells truth, they can't recognize it.		Intern sees BC in chair pants at ankles:	"Mr President you asked me here to see a clock"	BC	"Well it would be better with your face &amp; hands on it"
Mr Robert Mueller.	Sir,	Please provide Americans proof of corruption by either	1. Administration.	or	2. Candidate Trump.	or	3. President Trump		President has growing list of serious economic/political issues to deal with.		Given your access &amp; experience, stop hamstringing economy
@BillKristol Mr Kristol,	That will not be needed.		Albeit Congress is to get a short, sharp lesson on the power of:	1. Donald Trump.	2. The Presidency.	3. The Constitution.		Your fly miles will lift, as you chase Mbrs of Congress to home States for stories.		May be a Pulitzer in that for you.
@usminority @PennyHicks13 Changing minds re:POTUS		Focus	You are correct.		Tip	Best direct way is through the one thing they all have, not a phone, an idol, simple, their Parents.		Method	Parents have jobs &amp; tell children:	1. U/E low, all races.	2. Wages Up.	3. Taxes down.	4. 401K's in great shape.
@politicalnutcr1 	Thanks Wesley.	Hard to get cogent message out in 140 characters.
@MikePenceVP @realDonaldTrump Mr Vice-President 		Really???	So is world.		How did you enjoy APEC, given Secretary-General of APEC is old acquaintance.		I audit reviewed his work for former NZ PM Helen Clark (ex-UNDP Head) prior to his appt. https://t.co/OoTWxvuTXT.Reserve Bank.		You are good.		Merry Christmas
@FLOTUS @LibertyU FLOTUS	White House decorations, brilliant, dressed, lit, they will be spectacular.		Forgive me.	No one comments that you are the finest example of DT's best judgment.		You are elegant, poised, intelligent, eloquent, seriously beautiful, and genuine.		Merry Christmas to you all.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump	Yes it is, and the made up hate is not fact based.		I have tweeted former President Barack Obama, to stand with you over GMC.		Over 100yrs, Family Master Agents GMC to NZ.		Obama did this well, time, in interests of USA, you both realized your commonality.		USA
Fmr President Obama	Sir,	Time to stand up with President Trump.		Auto Task Force	Your baby with Steve Rattner	helped by my mate Kirk Kerkorian, saved GMC, while Marchionne saved Chrysler.	Unity	USA needs unity now, DT not happy GMC move, shed dislike, stand with him at WH.	Do it!
@realDonaldTrump President Trump	2018 World Economy	Press: No comment	Why: No credit to you/team	Situation	Oct 1987: Stk Mkt crashed.	Oct 1997/98: Asian crash	Dec 2008: GFC	Where is 2018 crash?	US Wages Up, Tax Down, 401K's very sound.	Families:	Men protect, women nurture	Both know USA better off
@thehill Former FBI Director - Comey	You should be in jail, for either:	1. Making false records.	In violation of your Oath of Appointment, false witness	(Memo's on alleged WH mtgs).	2. Perjury	Under Oath 	(Before House Committee)	Subject	No. Of Clinton emails	Thousands or very few.	Liar.
@FLOTUS 	Mrs Trump,	I hold dear letter of October 14, 1987, from First Lady Nancy Reagan, also signed by President Reagan.		A firm supporter of The President, you have come into your own, and anyone with a brain, respects and loves you.		To you, President &amp; Family Merry Christmas
@realDonaldTrump President Trump.	No Snipe at Snipes.		Please note my caravan tweet.	I refer to historic tear gas use.	Dropped during Obama 	You no speak caravan until on move.	Composition caravan clear USA threat.	Who funded it, clearly political, against you, but a real danger to USA.	Prosecute
@TheRightMelissa @TimRunsHisMouth President Trump	Caravan &amp; Tear Gas Fraud		Question	POTUS never spoke caravan until on move.		Border Tear Gas use numbers drop last 4 Obama years.		Drop as people arriving at border, knew they would get in, so no need trouble.		So, who funded caravan, and  kept it going &amp; growing?
@MillennialCon_ @politicalnutcr1 @realDonaldTrump @TPInsidr President Trump.	POTUS is not fascist.	Further, he really has no interest in the Right Left Fringe political argument.	Exactly what is needed.	House Democrats hopefully will realize this a President who will push legislation helping USA through Senate &amp; sign it.	Dem's need to act
@SteveInDC2020 @Old_Man_Rants Bring it on.	Just make it the truth.
@RealJamesWoods @dwlove9 Alyssa Milano	Mr Woods,	Girl showing breakdown she had with alcohol years ago has addled her brain.	Statistics on caravan do not show numbers of women &amp; children she is claiming, doubt they were rioting, so if anything it was collateral, but tear gas effect is temporary.
@_realBlackTrump @thorntreehill President Trump - GMotors.	I believe you are right.	Marks dirty move in politics.		My Family NZ Master Agents GM for 100 years.		Given funding &amp; tax breaks USA gave GM, disloyal to USA.		President Trump said 	GM, make vehicles USA wants to buy, previous problem		Sensible comment.
@Tweets4DJT 	I tweeted other day, elected Office won on promises then unhindered, if unkept, Official removed on basis of pecuniary gain by fraud.		Not President as can not get funds for wall freely.		This next step, as Congress duty to protect USA, they must fund wall, or liable
@LookingForGems 	Thanks for your tweet.
@BillKristol 	Thanks Bill for your tweet.
@TEDTalks 	Thanks for your tweet.
@jameshohmann 	Thanks James,	I am curious, forgive me being a little contrarian.		As a Washington Post correspondent, how do you feel economy is doing?		Why is it media focus on deficits, regularly, but on National Debt only during debt ceiling talks?		DT trying to lift solvency.
@realTylerZed CONGRESS IQ TESTS		Don't be ridiculous.		I have never seen anything so stupid as a suggestion.		Test the IQ of incoming Members of Congress.		Crikey	So few would qualify, ones left might actually legislate.		Caveat	Schumer Test	Needed box of tissues on hand for when he cries.
@realDonaldTrump @nancy73gg Mr President,	Leading in to 2020, you have to face facts that probably, 37-41% of voters back you, maybe 38-43% do not, so you fight over 25-16% votes.		If Dem's do not block, tax cuts will be in back pockets of voters &amp; Healthcare reform underway.		Some won't change, some will.
@realDonaldTrump @nancy73gg Mr President,	You need SCOTUSA Ruling your right under Constitution to impose measures to safeguard National Security of USA including borders.		On Ruling by Presidential Order ask Congress approve funds, if refused, hold in contempt, close Congress, appropriate by Exec.Order.
@GaileyGirrl 	Thanks Gail
@NancySinatra @realDonaldTrump Miss Sinatra,		For what, don't be silly.		To paraphrase a line from one of your Father's famous songs:		"You are getting.........under my skin"		Aren't you lucky under The Constitution you can say what you do, in many places you can not.		What did Donald turn you down years ago?
POTUS - Mueller Probe		Understand Mr Mueller has not finalized Report but has made preliminary edition available to Rep.Schiff, and now Dem leaning media are claiming report damning.		Q.	How is it legal Schiff leaks non-final report to media?		You Sir, Ranking Mbr, are a traitor.
@jimdwrench @PennyHicks13 @realDonaldTrump So don't deport him.	Jail him for life, in solitary confinement, 2 visits/year; or execute him.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump	Background	From time to time Supreme Court used to clarify limits &amp; application of Constitution.	Question	1st Amendment.	In a modern era, with instant access to resource to check.	Is it worth asking SCOTUS to rule on obligation of Press to print truth, when known?
@VPNightshade 	Thanks for your tweet
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Senator Graham,		Nice to see you going in to bat for The President;		1. DT does love America.		2. DT has had so many in whom he placed trust, let him down, or try to stab him in the back it is disgusting.		President Trump was/is right, this a proxy invasion.		Well done
POTUS - Mexican Border.	Point	Instead of Americans insulting other Americans, can you all step back, just for a moment &amp; look.		Caravan originally 1200 in number now 10x bigger.		Q's	1. How can all be genuine?	2. How can "queue jumpers" be backed by normal people?		Protect USA.
@realDonaldTru_m President Trump		Quote	"Some people are very stupid"		Comment	Yes.		And as Oscar Wilde once wrote.		"..and some of those people open their mouths and prove  it."
@realDonaldTrump @Juanita74650255 Well said.		This was the job you were born for.		Sometime in an interview it would be nice to hear just how much it challenges and inspires.		There can be no better placed, more evaluating person to enlighten the public on the most powerful role on Earth.		God Bless &amp; GB the USA.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President	You know my Father, and NZ, Australia, India, Poland, Canada, USA, soldiers bravely fought &amp; many died in WW2, as Europe allowed Hitler military buildup.		Then asked us to fix.		You are right, time they honor those sacrifices.		They have had 73 years living off USA.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President		Border Wall.		In interests of avoiding gridlock in House, take USD$1.5bn offered for wall.		Go to Bechtel, offer them USD$4.5bn in tax breaks by Executive Order, giving them USD$6bn, covers blowouts.		In intetests of https://t.co/REIkcmxilQ.		Then 2019 Proposal 8E.
@PradRachael @nancy73gg @BreitbartNews Gov. Kasich,	Your right in USA Law, a privilege afforded by sacrifice of Veterans honoured on Memorial Day,	think these options:		1. Could you beat DT?  No.		2. Is it better to go to DT and ask, given my experience. can I help in any way?  Yes.		(DT, great to have you!)		For USA.
@steph93065 Steph,	In part you are absolutely correct.

@Rainbow_Whisper @Jenn198523 @YouTube That was very creative 		I wonder if Donald has clicked on it.		Donald, you should click it.		You have seen this before, as you made it, but the way it is packaged is very good.
@IfHawes @pamela_blaylock Well said Mr Hawes.		And yet they accuse him.		Makes me sick, because I know Donald Trump to be smart, honest &amp; courteous.
@PennyHicks13 	Thanks for your tweet.		I can not understand why Politicians who make promises to get elected,  make no visible effort to carrying them out, once elected, yet are not prosecuted for fraud.		At least again, Donald Trump comes up Trump's.		He has done what he can.
Rothschild chides POTUS		Mr Rothschild, 		Le Banque de Gothard oldest Bank in history.		Schofield's Finance, UK, 2nd.		125 yrs b4 your Family in Banking.		You say President Trump upsets World Order.		He runs USA, not bank.		USA helps everyone, Donald knows this.		Leave him alone.
@Old_Man_Rants @PennyHicks13 Congresswoman-elect changes stance	Simple solution.	For this &amp; any elected person, who runs on set of views and actions, then acts in contrary way.	They must be prosecuted in Court for fraud.	As they become paid public servants, they therefore obtain reward by deception = Fraud.
@ArianaGrande Ariana,		I agree with you completely.		So in spirit of Manchester, what about a Goodwill Concert, in spirit of Lennon/McCartney song, "All You Need Is Love".		Get hands together across oceans and share moment, technology is there, is the will?		Invite POTUS to open USA leg.
@TiwariLalmani 	Thanks Val
@valval41 	Thanks Val.
@therealcornett @Rvndave Senator Schumer,	After over 30 years in the USA Senate, do you not think it is about time you helped America and Anericans, you have lived off their tax paid salary enough to do so.		Americans want legal immigration!
President Trump		Proposal 8E		Of great benefit to you, is that 8E will absorb a great amount of USA made steel and aluminium.		Just like nature's balance, ironically, manufacturing vast amounts of USA steel, a polluting process using coal, will control global warming.		Talk soon.
President Trump	You have been sent many tweets/emails on what is global warming.		Unfortunately, not one sent, told you what is responsible for 70% of global warming &amp; this one factor is the hardest problem to fix. 		This is why I researched &amp; tested Proposal 8E, as you will see.
@stonecold2050 @sarah_siskin How dare you accuse Ivanka Trump of lying.		I suppose you believe a man who is married does not know that it is wrong to coerce a young girl, not his wife to give him a bj, but that if that man is President, his judgment is spot on.		Ivanka Trump is doing good for USA.		Do you?
@valval41 	Thank you Val for your tweet		So many Trump supporters.		Great.		2020 Presidential Debates can be the greatest ever.		Dem's need to nominate Michael Bloomberg.		Then debate only ISSUES.		Donald will win.
@IngrahamAngle @valval41 You are a gem, love your show know why 		I did not know you worked in Reagan Administration.		1985-1987	I introduced First Lady Nancy Reagan to The Women's Institute.	Patrons were:	Lady Sonia McMahon, Dame Vera Lynn.	(Still have 1987 WH Letter from FLOTUS/POTUS thanking me).
@nancy73gg 	Nancy, glad you like.		No way Donald interferes with Mueller Probe as he has nothing to hide, on his answers probe quick end.		Mueller honest, seen it all, he will know DT clean.		2018-2024	Trump to act on Climate Change. His name will go into history. May use my 8E.
@BretBaier 		Hi Bret,		Honored by tweet, you First Class.		Four things:	1. Mexico asylum holding area, Trump brilliant!		2. Mueller Probe	No DT meddling, as finding NO collusion, ends it.		3. 2020 Trump landslide.		4. Ca. fires &amp; USA Droughts. 2019 my Proposal 8E must start.
@maggieNYT 	Thanks Maggie
@Susrez Susan,		We wish 		But I think the only things to silence Teflon Hillary, will be Old age and senility.
@parscale 	Brad, thanks for tweet.		Two Massive boosts - 2020		1. Happening	Mexico to create Mexican holding area for asylum seekers. Clearly USA can part fund to support this area.		2. Due.	Mueller Probe	In unambiguous statement concludes:	NO credible evidence of collusion.
@realdonaltrump9 @sunset6798 Mr President.		You sly devil.		Congratulations are due.		Out of the blue, clearly much work behind the scenes, it is announced Mexican holding to be created to avoid these border immigration issues.		Brilliant, and to quote Spock:	"Logical Captain"		Hope Thanksgiving enjoyable!
@rpmmasaya 	Thanks Roberto,		Re: Comey.		He should go to jail.		He clearly believes he is above USA Law.		Foolish Democrats see Comey as way to attack POTUS.		They do not know USA public will rebuke Comey for not telling truth, being Prima Donna, and Democrats lose votes.		Good.
@TiwariLalmani 	Thanks Lalmani for your tweet on my remark about James Comey.		He should be in jail for perjury.
POTUSA - Mueller Probe	Media wrong.		I do not believe President Trump will interfere in any way to hinder Mueller Probe.		He knows Mueller best way for 2020, probe completed, NO collusion, re-elected in a Landslide.		Key:	DT knows he is clean.		POTUS then acts on climate change.
@Susrez 		COMEY Reply		Hi Susan,	No reply Mr Comey, no time.		Given he spends it drafting fantasy stories claimed fact.		Either that or:	1. Ego will not let him?	(No!)		2. Does not want to admit he fabricated evidence?	(No, can't be that, not little Jamie)		Yep.
@realDonaldTrump @USTreasury @stevenmnuchin1 Great to see progress on lowering number of food stamp recipients by giving them viable alternatives.		That is what a real POTUSA does, alas P. Obama did not.		As you demonstrate there is no substitute for practical business experience.		Needs to be taught school.		Keep it up DT.
@Susrez 	Thank you for your tweet
Mr James Comey		To honor my USA ancestor, Gen. Henry Knox, and Family blood in USA soil; would you enlighten me please?		Why do your Memo records of alleged WH mtgs with POTUS differ from your Committee  testimony?		You:	a. 1,000's of emails.	b. Very few.		Fabrication or Perjury
@kenvogel @BillKristol Check your stats 	DT 53% same as Resgan
@QuancyClayborne @DannyAShea @GOP This shows how silly things are.		In The Appropriations Bill, commonly called the Budget, those items are referred to as Entitlements.	Medicare, MedicAid, Veteran Affairs payments, Superannuation.		World Bank calls them Entitlements.		Unpaid USA will lose reserve currency status.
@Jenn198523 	Are you there?
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,		As I tweeted:	You have power to:	1. Close Congress &amp; reopen.	2. Order Members out of DC to their home State.	3. Govern by E.O.		You may have power to E.O. tax waiver company to have them fund building wall		NB: Comey Perjury	W.H. Memo's &amp; House Testimony difft.
@FLOTUS @Justsaytruthnow @WhiteHouse @NatlParkService Mrs Trump,		Merry Christmas to you &amp; your Family, you do gd work.		The WALL	Tell Donald, find Corporation with capacity to build wall.		Order Wall built in 3 years.		Executive Order Tax Relief 10 years to cover costs.		Constitution empowers him, Congressional approval NOT needed.
@MMFlint You are a stirring pain.		POTUS spent the day going to various groups, as seen on network television, to thank them for their efforts and courage during the year.		You go to an interview he gave and attempt to suggest he claimed he did it all.		He said "My Administration".		Idiot
@AndrewCMcCarthy @TiwariLalmani Question	To an intelligent respondent.		Given the flak POTUS takes, 	and has been taking, for no good justification, and on an historically unprecedented scale, just because Hillary Clinton lost:	What level of discord will there be if POTUS tries to upend: Roe vs Wade?
@SassyKadiK @DannyAShea Are you asking if there is anyone out there who does not believe President Trump takes bribes?		1. Of course he does not.	2. He donated his salary on rotation to charity.	3. You may be very surprised at large donation to Veteran Affairs system he may make in near future.		Give up
@GrassrootsSpeak 	Ms Greene,	You are an absolute nutcase		1. Khashoggi was not USA citizen.	2. His Father Adnan known as "Merchant of Death" lgst illicit arms dealer in history, (15-20million deaths).	3. POTUS has no business deals with Russia.		You, good reason why he wins 2020.
@themarketswork @pamela_blaylock USA CONSTITUTION	Yes, you are right.	But, Democrats + some GOP want end Electoral College.		Founding Fathers to Andrew Jackson &amp; James Knox Polk,   knew, key Eastern States, NY &amp; FL., could dominate voting,  Texas came in, Ca. grew.		E/C system fair, it zeroes population weight
@Lara53049065 @PennyHicks13 USA &amp; ISLAM	My respects to law-abiding members of Islamic Faith.		You are Muslim Leader?		How dare you make such remarks, have you no brains?		Do not focus on America in a fight, be afraid when you poke the bear, of America's friends who help her. 		Use your brain &amp; stop this.
HAWAII 5-O		To: ALEX KURTZMAN	Alex have you &amp; fellow Directors sorted out pay dispute (Grace Park etc..) to allow for further episodes to be recorded?	They're good credible team, &amp; they look good.	One bonus with 5-O Old &amp; New, they're not heavy on gore, or in-depth gore analysis.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,		I pray you and your Family had a Happy Thanksgiving.		You must fix shortfall in USA Vet service (see Hearings):		1. 10,000+, 31-60 day delays on issues.	2. Computers archaic, need  replacing.		Suggest	If Congress No to Budget you pay it. 	Cost maybe US$300million.
USA		Happy Thanksgiving USA!		Understand this.		The United States of America is the greatest country on Earth.		Before any of you criticize anything, or anyone, please think of those who have gone before, to give each of you the best chance in life you live.		It is your choice.
PRESIDENT. TRUMP.	Saudi Arabia.	POTUS showing maturity in foreign affairs, Americans need to love.		World now, most dangerous since 1938-1939.		Putin retiring, leadup to 2024 Russian Elections means chaos; China flexing; Iran new missiles; EU disarray.		Be glad POTUS loves USA.
@SafetyPinDaily @NancySinatra Who are you to stoke fire.		If you think White House wants massacre at border you are nuts.		Gen. Kelly, superbly qualified to issue directive that troops can defend themselves, if need be with lethal force.		UN charter states person can use lethal force to defend themselves.
@CBSNews Priceless CBS, 	Well done
COMEY SUBPOENA	About time.	Hope Judicial Committee seeks clarification of difference between his Memo's of alleged mtgs with POTUS &amp; previous House Testimony.	(Thousands of emails, or very few)	Critical as both not true, so he lied on record.	Charge him with perjury to pervert.
PRESIDENT TRUMP	Judicial interference.	Constitution empowers you to E.O. for National Security:	1. Financial.	2. Domestic territory.	Post-2 yrs POTUS, Congress	3. Ticks o/seas deployment.	But	4. Domestically no say 1&amp;2.	Q	If Const. says Congress no say clearly judiciary no say.
IVANKA TRUMP - EMAILS		Democrats need to show the strategist pushing this attack, the door.		Democrats	1. You lost in 2016.	2. Put your bruised ego's aside.	3. You now hold House majority.		Focus on what moves USA forward.		You can have credit in history, and POTUS will sign it!
@jteagle55 @ReneeMcCone @AGWhitaker_ Agreed.		But over next 2 years.		Ample time to introduce the use of ID cards and retina scans to vote, nationwide.		Plenty of time, then fraud gone.
@BillKristol @SarahLongwell25 @KaylaforAmerica @monacharenEPPC @chavezlinda @SykesCharlie Mr Kristol,		Happy Thanksgiving.		The world is a better place for your shared opinions.
@margarettalev 	Hello Ms Talev,	I am honoured by contact.		Sorry to put you on the spot, but is Michael running 2020?		My life contacts include:	Gates, Ted Arison, Dick Bass, Kerkorian, M.Forbes, J.Kluge, K.Packer, D.Trump: all same one way.		Persistent.		Michael as good as any.
@jameshohmann 	Mr Hohmann,	Thank you for your tweet.	You work for and with a very prestigious news media source.	Funny how now, in this digital world I can not know say newspaper.	I am honoured by your contact &amp; would love you to keep in touch.	2019 is to be a big year.	Ppsl 8E.
@IvankaTrump Ms Trump,		I support what your Family is doing, and of course your Dad, he is doing great!		But you.		After all good work you are doing, Dem's attack you over non-secret emails.		Very low blow.		Know plenty support you.		And you help those in need in USA.		Happy Thanksgiving.
@nedprice 	Hi Ned,	I guess you have seen a lot.	Did you really need to resign?	You will find over time, you will know less and less about the day to day issues.	You will also find previously open sources are less.	Keep in touch, I am curious.	Just to clarify, you left, Yes.
@maggieNYT 	Hello random woman.	Maggie,	You know, notwithstanding political allegiances and I am in DT court all the way.	You must admit, politics in the USA is now with DT, very alive, full of content &amp; unpredictable.	Makes your life much more interesting.	Keep in touch Maggie!
@dcrow_baby @mattybum25 @realDonaldTrump @michelleisawolf Hi Deanna,	Can not understand a couple of tweets.	But that Matt, just another eg. Of a moron.	USA is alive, positive, moving forward.	Guys like Matt are so poorly researched, a fool.	Do you see POTUS Press conference, confident, in command.	Have a great day, Deanna.
@realDonaldTrump 	Mr President,	Mar a Lago address, on money.	2 yrs on who could believe USA so vibrant!	Comment re: Saudi Arabia only one you could make.	Border must be strong.	China now feels USA power.	Ivanka critique is vindictive.	PS: USA needs Proposal 8E to be solvent 2024
@mattybum25 @realDonaldTrump @michelleisawolf Yeah Matt,		Yeah Donald Trump bombed as a Casino operator.	After succeeding.	But casinos went through rough patch globally, so he got out.	Know how bad he bombed, he sought bankruptcy protection 6x to save business.	Paid all debts, plus interest.	Then expanded.		Matt he is winner
@Sherry40614670 	Thanks Sherry.
@StormIsUponUs @StorinoCarmella Yes.	The time is nigh,	Democrats do lie,	Some GOP are sny,	To undercut POTUS they vie,	Saying they act from on high,	Yet although they try,	A lie is a lie		To Anti-Trumpists		Oscar Wilde said:	Some people are fools, some of those, open their mouths and prove it.		Hi, Bob Corker.
@Newsweek Mr King,	Minus your crap,  does USA again need to jump to false reports &amp; send more US troops to war.		Do you have no respect for lives of fellow Americans, as Iran will attack SA if no USA.		Ivanka NO State secrets like Hillary &amp; how is A-G crook?		You stick to writing Fantasy.
@Rise_Soar_BFree @malibujonfanti @SenateDems @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump Do you see high-brow attitude:	"Oh, we are better than them"	Is there with Clinton's &amp; Obama's.		Not with:	Reagan, Bush Sr., Bush Jr., &amp; not with President Trump.		He is too busy fixing a mess while running a nation; and does not have a SNOB bone in his body, to be like that.
#retweet4good		Brilliant
@ReutersWorld In January 1999, I spent 9 days with our yacht under arrest, at Cap Nicobar, after we were ordered under Indian Navy guns, to vacate the sheltered harbor of Great Nicobar Island to the South.	We had 3 outriggers come out to us but as Master would not let them aboard.	Hard luck.
@SenBobCorker  	Tweeted you list, 3 men in 20th Century who caused deaths of over 10 million people each:	1. Hitler.	2. Adnan Khashoggi.	3. Stalin.		You busy, but no reply.		Adnan many foes, yet you will place USA/world economies at risk on killing of son of mass murderer.		Crazy
@RedKeepsRolling @ellen78834490 Jim Carrey,	What sort of nutty comment is that.		Have all those silly film roles you take, addled your brain.		You can say whatever you like to say, but just because you are worth over $200m does not make you sensible.		Your comments are those of an idiot.
@Old_Man_Rants The message in that tweet says it all about us, from a President who respected power.	Many do not know, he was during Presidency the richest man alive.	His trusted General was my ancestor Henry Knox after whom Fort Knox is named.	Democracy is a scalpel, well used we all benefit.
@HeatherChilders 	Heather,	Thank you for honoring me with your tweet.		May I, hopefully, not transgress, seriously:		Staff recruitment policies at FOX must be superb.		FOX female presenters look good, have great diction, appear able to speak their minds, are immaculately groomed.
@dagorosso 	Thanks Brock.
@PennyHicks13 	Thank you.
@sbamacrazy 	Hello Kenneth,	Thank you for your tweet.	I do like the cut of your jib.
@GOPChairwoman 		Hello Madam Chairwoman,	Thank you for your tweet.		Your work is cut out for you now.		As Donald continues to cut, trim &amp; reshape, parts of the USA economy which underperform, you now have a Dem House to handle.		Be loyal to him, he will win.		Bon courage, Madame.
@SpeakerRyan Speaker Ryan,		You are about to leave your post.		Notwithstanding certain criticism, you have been a good Speaker, and a first-rate Representative for your water conscious State of Wisconsin.		Please, deer hunting, just out of Congress, do not shoot yourself in the foot.		Hmm....
@SenBobCorker @SenatorMenendez Senator Corker,		20th Century, 3 men only each responsible for deaths of over 10 million people:	1. Adolf Hitler.	2. Adnan Khashoggi.	3. Josef Stalin.		This Khashoggi died horrific, but your brain is on leave if you disrespect POTUS putting USA first over any member that family
@BillKristol Both.
@SenBobCorker It is not, grow up.		Senator Bob Corker are you  an advocate for late "merchant of death" Adnan Khashoggi, for whose deeds this Khashoggi paid the price.	And what.		America loses revenue &amp; thousand of jobs, while you moralize for family which has killed millions worldwide.		Fool
@AmyMek That is crazy!
@realDonaldTru_m @HillaryClinton Tight squeeze.		By my reckoning that is almost half of all voters in 2016.		Don't worry, when you get tired of shaking hands with people thanking you, wheel out Hillary and the rest can shake her hand and say:	"There dear, it's alright, you tried, but you got Trumped".
@realDonaldTru_m 	Mr President,		Notwithstanding apparent horrific killing of Khashoggi I agree 100% your decision.		Hand wringing, your critics (Schiff) largely proxy at you.	Khashoggi's own allegiances and sins of Adnan "merchant of death" should  not threaten USA jobs/economy.
@RichardDawkins 	Richard,	You are a known smart man.		Hillary did not lose 2016 due to emails.		She lost because she acted as if result was already in, she was superior, others were "deplorable", and she was not positive.		Americans naturally very positive people.		So is Trump.
@Amy_Siskind Rep. Harley Rouda,	Would seem to me to have the type of bi-partisan spirit a Representative of any hue should enter politics with.		To do what you do, and achieve what you intend to achieve: "by the people, of the people, and for the people".
@nedprice Fair enough.
@MSNBC @JoeNBC Joe NBC	You have to be nuts.		Ivanka Trump does not have access to State secrets, and works to help:	1. Vets.	2. Impaired.	3. Underprivileged.	4. African-Americans.	To get them:	a. Education.	b. Jobs 	c. Healthcare.	d. Benefits.		Leave her alone.		Hillary got Ambassador killed
@RealJamesWoods @dwlove9 Best and brightest.
@LoufromCT @KimberlyMcLach1 @realDonaldTrump Idiotic District Court Judge		Under Westminster system Prime Minister obtains Order in Council from Governor General (Queens Rep) and signs having no confidence in their judgement. 	Sacked.		In USA.	President Trump to Judge:	"You're fired"
@sbamacrazy 	Hi Kenneth,	Thanks for tweet.	Q.	I believed The Constitution empowered President to use Executive Power to handle at sole discretion, any threat to:	1. USA security.	2. USA financial security.		Only needs Congress for a foreign deployment.		Who is this Judge, crazy!
@parscale 	Hi Brad,	He is doing really well, now more comfortable in role.		And chewing through work.		I have set up many global promotions, the one hook to promote Donald Trump in 2020 for me is:	"Vote Donald Trump, this man as President works very hard, to get results for you".
@Newsweek Prime Minister Khan,	Respects to you, your Family, and great nation of Pakistan.		Please, let spirit of cooperation continue.		But, irrespective of your power base, do not back errors, prior to you being PM		Bin Laden killed 2900 - 9/11.	Life has value in USA		Talk to Donald.
@MelissaM_Haskin I wonder who was on DT's Turkey Pardon List.	1. Hillary Clinton.. err. No	2. A. Schitt..x Schiff..err. No	3. C. Schumer...err. No	4. R. Mueller...err. No	5. Mssr. Macron..err. No	6. Fraulein Merkel..err. No	7. Theresa May..be..err. No	8. Vladimir. join me	9. Real Turkey hmm..Yes
@NBCNightlyNews That is a Judge irresponsibly wasting taxpayer money.		President has Constitutional right, under National Security, to Executive Order the borders closed to Santa Claus, if felt a threat!.		Judicial decision will be overturned by Supreme Court, hearing Under Urgency.
@BillOReilly How does that relate to Press.		Most Press in Democrat camp.		Keep baiting President Trump and he bites back.		Why not he hates bullies.
@BillOReilly Mr O'Reilly,	Over years you matter of fact.		The Problem.		DT sees things real time, not fantasy.	1. 2 yrs left, 1st Term, guaranteed.	2. USA trades insolvent, is broke, living on credit.		He wants to fix economy and uplift socially, tough get.		Dem's don't care, his aims.
@IvankaTrump 	Dear Ms Trump,	Are you now stopped from tweeting, due to protocol?		That is shame, illegal, in breach of Constitution.		Dem's try all tricks to run WH.		Get DT sign EO to permit you &amp; he tells Dem's "back off" or I after lame-duck, I close Congress, Order you home.
USA Wrongly Blamed Again	USA being blamed for deaths of children &amp; families in Yemen due to bombing by Saudi Arabia using USA made bombs.	THIS IS CRAZY!	Why not Russia in Yemen?	What about children &amp; families slaughtered by soldiers or militia using Russian Kalashnikov AK-47's?
@OliverMcGee @bbcregular @POTUS @DeptVetAffairs @realDonaldTrump President Trump - Vet Care.	I thought the TV presenter was engaging in a joke, he was not.		307,000 vets passed away not getting proper care.		3,600 VA Staff sacked for not doing job.		Vet care compromised due to bad staff.		POTUS is cleaning house and he is building up momentum.
@AmandaJaegerTV @gpnavonod Tweet rewrite destroyed joke.	Adam Schitt, not Scott.
@AmandaJaegerTV @gpnavonod Sweetheart,	You are gorgeous.		You are also a real fantasist.		If you want a new job, go and see Rep. Adam Scott, the Rank Mbr House Intel Committee, maybe he can figure out where the snow went.		If not you are both in the Schitt.		Brilliant piece, and seriously you are gorgeous.
@KatrinaPierson @dwlove9 President Trump.		Budget Cuts.		Criminal Justice Reform.		President Trump doing what he does best, cutting costs, making business efficient by weeding out poor waste.		To non-biz people, his cuts are to Cost of Business &amp; Operating Expenses, not services or staff or salaries.
@cs00582scs @Trump454545 @POTUS Cindy,	Hear your anguish, President Trump doubtless less hair.		But,		He is the Defender of The Constitution which grants freedom to choose.		He knows &amp; trusts Ms Conway, who could not be more staunch, she has been there from start &amp; defended DT with courage.		Leave her in peace.
FACEBOOK - Zuckerberg	Auction of girl using site.		Mark,		Here's your chance to atone.	You can afford it.		Buy her freedom.		Sponsor her for Education, Green Card, USA life.		Clearly shut site to this biz.		Chance to mind-meld with President Trump, fix, girl saved, you 2 heroes.
@LauraLoomer @jaxs5858 Laura,	I agree but key point missed.		Representatives nt problem, it is who comes to see them Dirkson/Hart Bldgs wearing f/face &amp; cloak.		We've seen suicide bomber men disguised as women.		Opens Congress to attack, and The President.		Not acceptable, deny them, they are in USA.
@realDonaldTrump @mauriciomacri Mr President,	Do you recall when the media laughed at an incoming and new President using Twitter.		Yet now, it must surely be that you are The President most engaged with the public at least since the late-President Kennedy.		That is a credit to you.		Long may it continue.
@brian_mansfield @taylorswift13 Just hope no-one interferes using contract as leverage.	As a man I can not believe in 2018 ladies, particularly younger pretty ones still vulnerable to predators,l.		Taylor, Akld concert superb.		Songs make sense, great voice, presence, look, carry yourself as a lady.		Well done.
The night is young.
@dcrow_baby 	Thank you Deanna, how are you doing.	Did you see Donald's tweet on Schitt, I mean Representative Schitt.	Hillarious.	Now Donald's really in the ..........................pooh.
@realDonaldTru_m @JudyMoo64479187 Just a remark.		When you finish your first Term in Office, Americans will be begging for you to have a Second Term.		In a world of absolute despots, most Americans realize, you were a "lad" once, now you are the real thing.
@realDonaldTru_m @JudyMoo64479187 Take a bow.		Co-write for SNL.		Their script writers can't get it right either.		Just one question:	What sort of "Shitt" do you think you are in now?		And don't forget he is "rank------ing" Member on the Intelligence Committee.		Now there is an oxymoron, or possibly just a moron
BRAZILIAN PRISON Murder	Criminal murders prostitute to get moved elsewhere.		I would love to visit South America.		Why should economies which hold life so cheaply get 1 cent.		Girl treated like garbage I would keep swine who did that in same place to drive him nuts, or shoot him
@TheDemCoalition @kurteichenwald @realDonaldTrump Have you ever been in a forest fire?	Have you ever had a mate flicked 40ft through the air to his death, as the burning tree he tried to cut was a "barber's chair".	Oh, that's right, you've never worked hard.	Heavy u/growth major cause f/fire severity.	Many other reasons.	Grow up
@MelissaM_Haskin @mbohannon9 @WhiteHouse @POTUS Melissa,	California is very important.	9th biggest global economy.	Jerry Brown &amp; Donald Trump old enemies, before you were born, both used to be rivals dating beautiful girls.	Jerry, too old now.	California, heavily in debt, needs younger guy/girl who apolitical can uplift it.
@RealJamesWoods You are right James Woods.	Socialism is a creeping evil which purports to be freedom, yet imprisons the people who live under it.	Question	Years ago you made a movie called "San Salvador" am I right or close, violent but very real movie.	Did you have chance to visit and observe?
@STEPHMHAMILL Oh cut it out Stephanie!		Make it filet mignon, with a little bernaise sauce, and a glass of Californian CabSav.
President Trump	CARAVAN ALERT	BBC Interview Today		Tijuana residents do not want caravan to stay due to their lawbreaking.		They want them gone.		Tijuana residents now think legal immigration right way, say President Trump right.		BBC cuts off interview.	Fake Press, disgraceful.
@RWPUSA 	Mr Painter,	I consider it a privilege when moving through internet I found an address to Boston University Law School given by Sumner Redstone.		Then Q&amp;A with Mr Schwartz.		Have you had the privilege.		Principle concept is:	"Content is king"		What great intellect.
@mckaycoppins McKay,	Sorry Twitter overwrite.	Humor, not humorous.
@mckaycoppins 	How appropriate McKay Collins.		You allude unabashedly to being a pseudo handsome Donald Trump, then in your bio you are author.of:	"The Wilderness".		When given your USA base you are in wilderness of USA political life.		Love your humorous, please keep in touch.
@VaibhavDutt5 I do not agree, and Vaibhav that respectfully does not mean you irrationally responding to my tweet with dozens of replies.		Imran is a Leader, he is not stupid, but as good leaders do, they do not charge in.		They look, listen, plan, then act, and he is a good thinker.		Patience
@kurteichenwald 	Thank you Kurt.		Book can not, in my opinion, be replicated or surpassed digitally.		Greatly support storage for posterity, of all books we read, but sheer tactile feel of a book in your hand, wow!		As person going blind (glaucoma), easier to read a book. 53
@RusselNorman 	Mr Norman,	Thank you.
@KipTalleyDC 		Hi Kip,	Like your boss.		As ship's captain you know a boat runs only as well as you attend to detail, and make working environment easy as possible to function.		Have hired over 400 captains on private megayachts so value you.		May the wind always be at your back.
@Toole67 	Thanks Heidi.	Grrrrrrrr..........
@CommonSenseSqu1 	Thanks
@pahubb43 @nancy73gg Peggy,		I have tried to point that out on previous tweets.		You do it so much better.		African-American people built/rebuilt Washington, DC, so to not forget European American population, African-American people have nothing to apologize for, but badly treated	Why?	Color.	Crazy!
@anniekarni 	Thank you Annie,	I will keep you in mind.		Politico is a good service.		On your web photo, be happy!
@RepAdamSchiff 	Congressman Schiff.	You are strongly critical of the 45th President of USA.	I look forward to seeing how you perform, esp. in role of Rkg Mbr. House Intell.Comm given weak Dem security in past 25 yrs.	Weak security people die 	Donald Trump is not weak.	Good luck.
@maggieNYT 	By the way.	You are not a random woman.
@maggieNYT 	Hello Maggie,	I do not know your history, but do understand promotion in the ranks.		An honest opinion from you, do you as a journalist truly appreciate the type DT generates, to make your working life lift I will eager to a new level for you?
@BillKristol 	When I tweeted you a week or two ago, I foolishly failed to grasp what poking a sleeping giant truly meant.		But when people write, talk, argue, and discuss they do not usually make war.		So for your intellectual input to lift Twitter, thank you.		Good jousting.
@TomSarg11071833 	Thanks Tom,	Imagine under auspices of National Security invokes Constitution and grants Bechtel Construction with financial capacity to build the wall.	Nothing Congress can do.	Hopefully Congress made up of Patriots.
To Pakistan Prime Minister RT. Hon. Imran Khan.		PM,		We saw you lead teams to victory against:	Richards, Botham, Border, Hadlee, Gaviscar.		You were/remain winner.		President Trump criticizes old Pakistan.		Talk to him, do not fight him, you both too tough to yield.	Talk please!
@realDonaldTrump And Mr President you know I love and admire you, please do not have a fight with Imran, he is truly one of the good guys.	More importantly his word is his bond.
@realDonaldTrump Yes,	And you know from tweets I have sent, because in 9/11 I lost the English girl I loved, I have been vocal about how that prick lived in Abatibad for 15 years, down road of major military base, crazy.	But Imran is man to fix this.	Like you he does not stand for rubbish.
@realDonaldTrump 	Mr President,	I do not often criticize, this once, must.		Pakistan PM Imran Khan	In America 1980-90's cricket had no profile 	Down Under Imran Khan is a Champion &amp; Leader of Men.	He can help Pakistan.	Call him, invite him to WH.	I love you both, shake hands guys
TRUMP criticizes Seal raid - killed bin Laden.		PROOF TRUMP RIGHT		POTUS to McRaven (ex-Seal) &amp; Brennan (ex-CIA Dir.), too slow to get bin Laden.		Bin Laden in Abatibad 15 yrs 30km major Pakistan military base.		Great intelligence sharing.		Rubbish - none.		PROOF Trump right.
@Toole67 rrrrrrrr.............
@Tweets4DJT That is disgraceful.		While nothing can bring that poor woman back to life, or comfort her relatives and friends, nor assuage the anger of the observer, if it can be proved beyond any doubt, not reasonable, ANY doubt he did this, he should be put legally to death immediately.
@Tweets4DJT 	That is just so sad.		To you my sympathy.		To the little fellow, may he rest in peace, but never to know what he missed, crazy.		There are some absolute irresponsible morons in the world.		Go with God and never forget, you will value always what you had.
@Juanita74650255 How dare you suggest, like the majority of Americans, you self serving prick.	Electoral College was designed to avoid Ca., NY., dominating small States.	Donald Trump is boss.	Go on backing losers, or back him, and in turn the nation you say you love, the USA.	If you have the guts
@gaye_gallops @c_siera Well that stirs things up.	With Donald Trump in The Oval Office and Lindsey Graham riding shotgun in the Judiciary Committee, it looks like we have the beginnings of a great posse, into 2020.	I would suggest Dem's focus on USA first, not self gratification.	Grassley tried hard.
@Tweets4DJT @TomSarg11071833 President Trump Border Security.		Child who died:	You poor little fellow.		Donald,	Close the Southern Border.		If Congress will not give you funds, use Exec. Authority.		Ask Bechtel Construction to fund building &amp; in interests of National Security E.O. zero business tax 10 years
@thehill Trump to Mueller.	Anyone who thinks this President, this Man will not full frontal Robert Mueller is a fool.	This President does not have a backward step in his arsenal.	In 50 years I have not seen anyone rip The Presidency from complacency to action so effectively.	DT good luck.
@IngrahamAngle 	You run a great show.	It does not matter which side of the political spectrum a person comes from, you just want the story the facts.	That is your job.	Pity a few in your industry do not understand this core value.	Well done.
@SteveWinst57 Few in sport, from an era of global names, playing a great team sport, have done more.	You are as well known as:	Sir Bobby Charlton, Peter Shilton, Kevin Keegan, Paul Shearer, even David Beckham.	From when egos frowned upon, this shows high regard, for you as a man, now a Knight.
@PeteHegseth @Twins_Chat That is not fair.		The chair is not big enough.		Where is the bib?		But, jokes aside.		You have a real President in the White House now, recognize the difference and get on with your life!
@AmyMek 	Since when has there been Sharia patrols in UK ?		That is not on.		There is a legislated separation between Church and State so there should not be a religion or race based patrol anywhere in UK.		Come on Theresa May get to grips with your country!!!
@MichaelAvenatti @NoRightWing @realDonaldTrump Keep Quiet.		Notwithstanding that horrific act, you do not sit in judgment on this President.		He is as high above you in every way, as an Ace is above a 2 in a pack of cards.
@charliekirk11 @Slaughth1 Avenatti.		One rule for everyone else.		Prime hypocrite.		And too dumb to see it.
@RealCandaceO 	You are absolutely correct.	Want all the headlines when they speak out, DT sorts it out, and then you find out what their values are.		Their egos not issues.		" ...Content of character"		Best 2 lines in any speech I have heard or seen, says it all.	Candace, great!
@NBCNews Real issue.	President is doing his bit.	Very did theirs long ago.	GOP get officers elected for Congress.		Democrats can not decide on a Speaker.		Grow up please, real people need your help.		If you don't hurry, Donald will send you home like little children, and run USA by EO.
@HouseCracka @malibujonfanti @anntensity The Constitution empowers any President to close the Congress at their sole discretion, and literally order them home, be they House or Senate, or he could order a selection home.		Pity he can not send some as advanced party to Mars.		One way.
@Cernovich What excuses?		Grow up!
@realDonaldTrump 	Mr President,	Take a break, to remember guitarist Roy Clark.		Your love of music well known.		Take moment to watch clip of him playing 'Odd Couple'		Found under	"Baseball by BSmile"		Andre Segovia would smile.		His mastery guitar, your mastery, running America.

@Toole67 	Thanks Heidi,	Gee that is a mean looking dog.
Californian Fires	Well done to firefighters in Southern California, on getting 44% of fire, under control.	In the conditions, absolutely sterling work.	No one knows that area more than you, and when I push for 8E, I want your help, and your jobs are gilt-edged secure.	God Bless
@Chris20788917 	Thanks Chris.	I just can not figure it out.	These terrorists wage war or acts of violence causing horrendous death &amp; casualties.	On battlefield, or full-scale war they are shot.	Why in peacetime if they use weapons or tactics of war, are they not put to death?
@dcexaminer CNN lawsuit has no merit.		At time of press being invited to White House for briefings it was on basis of invitation.		It was always known that as WH Official Residence of POTUS, invitation may be revoked and 1st Amendt does not apply.		Do you all want ban?		Ted Turner, back off.
@abcmelbourne @abcnews @PercyKaren Melbourne Terrorist jailed		Not good enough.		For 24 years, he is in a cell paid for by Australian Tax payers, spreading hate.		Is he then deported?		Why not send him out of Oz to offshore detention, having biometrically scanned him so he can never re-enter Oz?		Or, shoot him.
@ACTBrigitte @Believe_N_USA In a short, succinct tweet, you have said what many Americans are realizing.		In old American language, and what used to be the greatest compliment you could pay,		President Trump is a trail boss.
@ScottforFlorida @TiwariLalmani Senator Scott.	You have on confirmation been given a real honor.	Use it.	You are no use to this President if he has to go around wiping your nose.		I tweeted as Governor you had power to sack Broward County Commissioner, as you had to sack Sheriff.		This President is efficient.
@GKeile Absolutely.	Man or woman irrelevant.	Color of skin - no.	Content of character.	Talker or doer.	Doer.		Congress.	Fund that wall.	Get the best brains possible to fix USA Healthcare.		Obama tried, good on him.	Now fix it properly.		The American Way.
@CBSEveningNews Avenatti vs Donald Trump	Notice, for all unsubstantiated claims against President Trump for philandering, which is his business, no allegations of the type Avenatti accused of.		President Trump a lover of beautiful women, not the other.		Take a look at First Lady for proof
@Newsweek Trump Unhappy with May.	Newsweek	How do you know this?	Un-named WH Source.	They should be sacked.	Press can protect sources but not when it threatens USA economic &amp; bi-lateral friendships.	Like Acosta, you are aware White House official residence of POTUS.	You by invitation only.
Global Beauty Alert	If there is a prettier face on a woman than Camilla Belle, it must be Maria Sharapova, or Taylor Swift.		Question	Worldwide Guys.	Have you noticed how beautiful many women are today?		Put down your weapons &amp; focus on winning hearts.		All you need is love- JL.
@MSNBC MSNBC-USA Election Rigging	MSNBC, can you give it a break.	Are you aware Mueller has nothing on POTUS and you are panicking as gravy train of headlines disappears.	Now you attack FACEBOOK to link into Trump 2016 win.	Give it a break.		Zuckerberg, sue.		Be fair, let POTUS run USA.
@ChristusPatriot @UsLiberate George Soros - USA Voting		Mr Soros,		Can you realize American voters are NOT for sale, this is why Russian probe without merit.		You nearly ruined UK, Japan, Malaysia (but for Mahathir).		This is not a game, you ruin lives, be a good chap and stop trying to play God.		Be silent.
@Actibonnie 	California GOP	Thank you Bonnie.	You know, I would imagine Californians are now past the hand in air, it's climate change Dem argument.	So what, when is man going to do something so big it has impact, a step change.	Plus they can not like seeing food prices go up.
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,	You and your husband are batting 1000 for the USA.	Get DT to look at introducing biometric card for voter ID, retina scans to vote, no registration, no vote, no excuse.	19 million illegals USA unfair impact.	Message me Yes on send 8E Brief (Dec) to you.
@JamesOKeefeIII @rpmmasaya USA Voter Fraud.	No-one should have access to a voting ballot form unless they are entitled.	That entitlement must be proved before being given form.	Excluding sightless blind, the foolproof way is retina scan to get form, scan to lodge.	Too much at stake to allow margin of error
@Patrici15767099 @Actibonnie GOP California-Trump		I wonder how blue California will stay, as DT allows me to start Proposal 8E:2018-2028 which will be 2019-2029.		This when 8E hires over 2m in State, intro's major capital injection, removes threat of major forest fires, and lifts food production in State.
@USA4TRUMP @rpmmasaya @gatewaypundit Senator Rubio,	Nice to see you are firmly on the Trump wagon.	That is the true meaning of United.	President will always want your unique perspective, which only youth, intelligence, diversity of background and experience can give.	Help him out Marco.	He is boss, but share burden.
@vyshakmv 	Thanks Vyshak,	I got dragged into tweet fued I knew nothing of.	All it takes is leaving someone linked in instead of involving only those needed.	Vaibhav has apologized, the other party has not.	Enough said.

@Toole67 	Thank you Heidi.
@VaibhavDutt5 Thanks Vaibhav,	I figured it was something like that, so grateful.
@thehill FLORIDA FIASCO	Federal Judge agrees with President Trump, most sensible people.		Problem part stupidity, part parochialism, Democrat supporters hating GOP.		Can 2018, with President Trump firmly in charge, be last year of this nonsense, voting move to retina scans &amp; 21st Century?
@NaveenB80187508 So am I, brother!		It is simple yet complex.		I am to sleep, let us talk soon
@VaibhavDutt5 @Speak_Truths_4X @VP @narendramodi Vaibhav,	Can you disconnect me from your multiple Twitter tag.	Your contact Legal Immigrant has argument with you and I have been linked in.	Otherwise I will block both and have both barred.	I was having polite tweets Indian people, you &amp; they have polluted my account, please fix
@Speak_Truths_4X @vyshakmv @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi @noconversion I do not know who you are, but you will sever my contact from this ongoing verbal war you are having with these other parties.		Cease and desist.
@Speak_Truths_4X @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi Again, I am not in this, I have been asleep while this is going on.		You will remove from link or I will have you removed from Twitter, you are not sane.
@Speak_Truths_4X @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi @noconversion Again, I am not in this discussion, sever my connection to this.
@Speak_Truths_4X @VP @narendramodi I know nothing of what you tweet, why do you continue to link me?		Are you too lazy to sever?
@Speak_Truths_4X @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi I find your linking me to the argument you are having with them unacceptable to me.		I am a New Zealander, and you do not insult me in such a way.		Unless in tweets I read you change your tone to one of rational, non-insulting remarks I will block you and report you.
@Speak_Truths_4X @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi I am not denying anyone anything, non-response due to sleep.		You linked me with people you have running argument with.		I have 20 plus long tweets from both of you, that will stop right now.		I like rational discussion and Legal Immigrant do not be rude to me.		Are we clear?
@VaibhavDutt5 @Speak_Truths_4X @VP @narendramodi Thank you for clearing that up, I thought we were doing OK also.		Sorry for not responding earlier, a man has to sleep.
@dcexaminer That is an interesting perspective.	Coal always part to play USA energy map.	Not interested in debate.	USA uses steel, requiring higher temps, needs coal &amp; coking coal to be viable.	But much better way with respect to everything else.	USA infrastructure is aged, needs refit.
@IvankaTrump Ms Trump,	You and Jared are a great team.	Well done.	Advance America!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President	Why has no-one prosecuted James Comey for:	Version 1	Memo's of alleged post-WH mtgs with you, as an inaugurated FBI Director.	Version 2	Committee of Congress, under Oath.	Clinton emails (few/many)	1 is perjury, no corroboration, credibility.	Pervert Justice = Gaol.
@VaibhavDutt5 @Speak_Truths_4X @VP @narendramodi You need to read more carefully instead of running things together.		I said our family had interests going back over 300 years.		That is separate to Grindlays.		Don't look for conflict with me, when none exists.		Do I make myself clear?
@pumpernickel888 @DannyAShea @mitojorge @kanumankalwa @krassenstein @BetoORourke @RepBetoORourke @KamalaHarris With respect, your time is gone.		Can you not get it.		President Trump would love it if you lived &amp; respected him, but in the end who cares.		He is lifting the strength and wealth of America, get on the train or be left behind.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	You must be very encouraged by this early act of bi-partisanship, from this new Congress.		As usual you have been on the money at every turn.		The handpat you got in Paris from President Putin was a great nod to warmth, now China is understanding.		You are doing it!
@VanJones68 	Mr Jones,	I tweeted well done to Sen. Booker re:justice reform, you put to President in a classic example of bi-partisanship &amp; a new Congress.		You tweeted me I am proud to make acquaintance. 		You now know, you can work with this President.		Keep in touch, stunning.
@CoryBooker 	Senator Booker,	If bi- partisan justice reform example of legislation you &amp; your fellow Democrats can enact, to help unify the USA,	Congress could be most productive.	Sends signal on Mrs Pelosi being Speaker, and it shows you can work with The President.	Well Done.
To Nigel Garage,	Just saw you on Fox &amp; Friends.	Very impressive, direct, blunt, and correct.	Why not go back into UK political scene and fix focus.	Your leaving I could understand, now you need to be running show.	For UK.
@VaibhavDutt5 @Speak_Truths_4X @VP @narendramodi Yes, 	I do not disagree with you on your point about Hinduism.		It is definitely under threat, &amp; despite India the world's biggest democracy, she must protect her heritage.	Clearly the Hindu religion is central to that action.
@VaibhavDutt5 @Speak_Truths_4X @VP @narendramodi Vaibhav,	You are a veritable font of information.	Albeit is a little more complex than as you state.	Not to cause offence.		My Family interests in India go back well over 300 years.		We were prime movers on Barclays Bank Board to introduce the bank you know as Grindlays.
@TiwariLalmani Agree, understand shame.	But, in the Spirit if Diwali, I feel certain, the Gods watching over her waters, would rather have Indian Government and wealthy Indian families (Mittal, Ambani, Tata, Khan, Mohdri etc..) do what Indians do best, act, and fix.	Do you agree?
@Speak_Truths_4X @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi Of course values are different.	Who am I to judge.	I do not like your inference that yours is only opinion which counts.	There are so many human rights abuses globally it is disgusting	But while not stopping trying to fix it is banal to think you can dismiss millennia of history.
@RealEricYoung 	I mean "ruff".
@GOPLeader 	Mr Kevin McCarthy	You have just been re-elected GOP House Champion.	I tweeted you, but when I looked for it, it was not at top or near on tweet list.	My ego does not need assuaging.	But you are important, ask Twitter if you can fix.
@RealEricYoung @2covet Rough!
@battleofever @Actibonnie Hillary Clinton Exposed.	Well, it rids President Trump of one headache.		Hillary has used her position, access, contacts, to get immunity for someone who is a criminal, then colluded to derail justice.		Immunity can be overuled if collusion to pervert.	Q.	Any link to Democrats?
@NancySinatra @essenviews @realDonaldTrump Ms Sinatra,	Pick up the phone, and ask Donald what he is thinking of doing and why.		You may find what you think is not the full story, and remember he is 72, so he is well aware of the people he has grown up with suffering.		You know he is not a fool.
@STUinSD @Actibonnie More than 1% of total population, in terms of voting about 1.8%.		Crazy, and well done on what I call smart due diligence and excellent lateral thinking.
@ishan007_ishan 	Thanks Desi
@GOPLeader 	Congressman McCarthy,		You do me great honor.		Condolences House loss, potential blow to President's agenda, but have faith his/GOP deal-making skills.		Refer my TedTalks tweet today.		For USA 8E must happen, can send Brief to you &amp; Ms Ivanka Trump (mid Dec)
@SandraSmithFox 	Thank you Sandra.	I am a big fan of FOX, but I come at it from a different angle.	I know members of Murdoch Family, in Oz I employed as a PA, a JP who every week dined with Murdoch Family in Toorak.	I trust Rupert's journalistic standards and his employees.
@WayneDupreeShow 	Thanks for your tweet Wayne.
@IvankaTrump 	Thank you for following me, I am truly honoured.	Two questions please.	1. Forgive me, but in 2024, what age will you be, 46?	2. Please go to my TedTalks Twitter.		God Bless you Ivanka.		Your Dad will rewrite history in Office and later reflection, by others.
@Jt428cj 	Hello Jim.	Are you from that Tuttle Family?
@rocky16101327 	Thanks Stan
@n_lalitha 	Hi Lalitha,	I have a feeling you are right.		Interesting how richer men &amp; women are again in charge.		I know the arguments, but by and large, I want successful people running a country.		Their vision not constrained as showing in India, China, Russia, and the USA.
@TEDTalks 	Thanks for honor.	Pray to push Proposal 8E: 2018-2028, to:	1. Stop Ca. fires 2024	2. Cease USA drought	3. USA emissions 51% 2012 lvls	4. Food Stamp to 10%	5. Use USA made steel	6. 10 yrs t/transfers pay USA US$7-11Tn	7. New global bourse	8. Mass jobs Africa, no EU exit
@dcexaminer 	I am honoured to receive a tweet from you, thank you.
@EdKrassen	Hi Ed,	Thank you for your tweet.
@VanJones68 	Hello Mr Jones,	Glad to receive your tweet.	Please keep in touch.
@RealCandaceO 	Hi Candace,	Thank you for your tweet.	Absolutely, you can be who you choose to be, you can try what you wish to try, you can work as hard as you wish, you can study, love, and enjoy life, legally, BUT, be You.	You are the only one of you.
@ranjanninu 	Thank you Ranjan
@TiwariLalmani 	Lalmani,	I do not have an historical or cultural right, so not bathed in Ganges River, "giver of life"		Tell me, with pollution of modern world, and India's vast population, you can not be happy about the river being so defiled, by "plastic" to me it is sacrilege.
@Ranjeet__123 	Thanks Ranjeet.
@grawlee 	Thank you for your tweet.
@BillKristol Avenatti.	Welcome back to the fold.	It is not that any dble std was being applied.	It is the apparent fraudulence of a man who tried to cut a swathe through others.	You reap what you sow.	Innocent until proven guilty, beyond reasonable doubt.
@Speak_Truths_4X @VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi You are right,	India has massive problems, but please with what is going on in Florida, the baying for blood over the President appointing acting A-G, with respect do not try to give me legal lecture.	India not USA, class system existed 1000 yrs before USA	Can not be quick fix.
@BAChhatbar 	Hello Bhavesh,	I felt someone had to say something.	My Father her served in WW2 in Egypt and Italy has always told me of Indian soldiers with them in war.	Particularly the ghurkha's.		Great trust in people who fight with you, always.
@VaibhavDutt5 	Yes,	You are right.	But in 2020 Donald Trump, if he wishes to run, will beat the Democrat contender, pointlessly.
@BillKristol Mr Kristol,	An op-ed tweet like that brings in true joy to the GOP.		You obviously did not notice the handtap Vladimir Putin gave DT in Paris.		There is not much in the world, more nauseating than Chuck Schumer starting to lecture from the pulpit while failing to fool public.
@Vishalkran 	Hello Vishal Karen,	You guys look as if you are enjoying yourselves.		Thank you for liking my tweet, very significant VP Pence travelling to India at this time, when serving and fallen troops are remembered for their great sacrifices.
@charliekrinkler France would not be that imbecilic.	Who is stoking this tension.		I do not believe the way in which President Trump carried himself in France did not:	1. Pay tribute to France.	2, Show complete respect for the day being respected in Armistice Day.	3. Respecting USA fallen.
@UsLiberate 	Thank you for your tweet.		We can but wait and see if action is to ensure, if it does I can fix this problem, but the politicians need to realize California is a big State and this is a large deadly issue.		But it can be fixed, with hard work.
@TiwariLalmani 	Lalmani,	Thank you for your tweet.
@madmamma4 	Thank you for your tweet.		Clearly Jerry Brown is all smoke and mirrors.		He has sat on his hands since his return.
@desertratphil 	Hey Phil,	Glad you liked my tweet.	How does this going on in Florida happen in 2018.		Clearly some of these older politicians, and their helpers, actually believe they can pull off this sort of swindle.		God Bless.
@Nitinyanandu 	Nitin,	Thank you.	You are a serving soldier.	May I ask your rank.	Keep in touch, and keep safe.
@VaibhavDutt5 	Vaibhav,	Thank you again.	If you are in business in USA I pray it is successful.	Thank you again.
@Ekdeshbhakta 	Hi, 	Thank you for your tweet.		India is a country of vast history and culture, as are her people.		Shukriah
@ranjanninu 	Thank you Ranjan.		I believe VP Pence in India at this time is a clear signal of a larger involvement between USA and India.		Providing President Trump is re-elected in 2020, and the Democratic Party, which has poor trade record, does not greatly impact his agenda.
@NaveenB80187508 	Naveen,	I pray you can read English.	Thank you for your tweet.		VP Pence being in India at this time, 100 years since WW1 Armistice is an ultimate mark of USA saying "Thanks India" and "the USA remembers and values your brave role".		Well done, keep in touch.
@RhondaDanielso2 	Thanks Rhonda,	I felt it had to be said.
@VaibhavDutt5 @VP @narendramodi Thank you Vaibhav.		Without doubt, in the vast multi-cultural nation of India, for those of us traditionally taught, the Hindu population is central to your great nation.	There are great regional  tensions, as USA VP Pence shows by travelling there, India is highly regarded.
@hermitvin 	Hello Hermit,	Thank you for your tweet.
@WildHogs6 	Thanks very much.		Nice facepage!		Can you believe what they are trying in Florida.		Democrats have no idea what they are up against in 2020, if Donald reruns.		They will be slaughtered.
@brandyazUSA 	Thank you.		Clearly no response yet.	That WH Press Briefing Room was vintage TV.		When Acosta brushed aside the girl's arm, Donald like a protective Father stepped out and I believe he would have smacked Acosta.		They underestimate DT at their cost.
@TerryV223 	Thank you for your reply.		Sometimes you just have to call people out, thanks.
@joann1304 	Thanks for your tweet.		I saw that and had to tweet a reply, I am glad with the words I typed around the wrong way, you figured out what I was saying.		Thank you.
@SpeakerRyan Classic.	See you Congressman Ryan.		Mr Speaker.	Irrespective of criticism, I believe you can go home, and sleep well at night, the country is much better positioned now than before.	Job well done.
@TIME You are lying.		Given your heritage I find that offensive.		The President had a mandated authority to ensure the internal and external security of USA.		Florida as 4th biggest state, population/economy poses a threat both fronts, given proximity to Ctrl/Sth America.
@LauraLoomer @joann1304 You are a quality, hard working, investigative reporter, may I offer 2 subjects I believe will do finish her campaign, over 	1. USD$134million fraud Arkansas real estate deal.	(Her part)	2. USA Libyan Ambassador, embodiment of President killed (Her incompetence).	They finish her.
@Steve52925949 @ignacio1981sala To Jerry Brown.		Proposal 8E will fix the fires which are a real problem for California.		Begun, mid-2019, Ca., Or., &amp; Wa., fixed, major fires gone by mid-2024 if no natural delays e.g: earthquake.		8E 10 yr project nationwide.		Can be shared initiative b/w President &amp; Democrats
@paulsperry_ @brandyazUSA Who is fronting :	Jim Acosta?
@Jessiesworld08 @xbrooklynite21 Dead Florida Voters	What, does not Heaven have sun drenched beaches, bikini clad beauties, and hanging chads.	So they returned.	Sorry Florida has moved on.	Florida now has a whole new way of cheating at ballot box.
@JennyLynnO1 	Thanks Jane,	Spread the word.	Proposal 8E: 2018-2018 is coming.	Up to DT
@ZiiM84 VOTER ID	Like attitude, not solution.	20% unable to fingerprint.		Retina scan effective/easy:	1. Go vote.	2. Present biometric card.	3. Scan left/rt. eye.	4. OK.	5. Form issued chip (embed)	6. Vote.	7. Return form. 	8. Form scanned.	9. Random left/RT eye scan, OK.	10. Vote lodged
@magnettothesea 	Thanks.	I pray Stephanie is recovering well, and there are no other problems please!	Love you girl, always have, always will.
@Civil_war_elect 	Thank you Mark,	You know unless as a male you really watch, women's basketball, netball, soccer &amp; volleyball, as you do, you do not grasp how serious &amp; dedicated they are, and they hit hard.	Well done!
@WhiteHouse 	Dear General John Kelly,	Sir,	I appreciate I speak out of turn, to man of your statute, &amp; humbly tender my apologies.	Sir,	If President does not want you to go, will you stay at least until 2020.	You do not look like a man to run from a fight!	DT is in one for USA.
@nrskim @CBSNews I do hope you were referring to Hillary Clinton's chance of being elected President.	If not explain please?
@JannaWilkinso69 @c_siera @VictoriasSecret Classic Janna,		Do you think she got abreast of the audition.		Or is her success 'nip(please) &amp; tuck'.		At least she had a go without a boob.
@JacksonDiehl @jameshohmann It is possible Crown Prince Selman's power has gone to his head!		What a dilemma 4 POTUS?		Given Iran would attack an unsupported Saudi Arabia, who balance the Mid-East.		I still think if Saudi paid bill to USA cut oil income 1 year.		Then CP Selman will be gone, King or other!
@ericawerner Do you revere Dr Martin Luther King Junior?		His words: (man = person)	"..that no man shall be judged on the colour of their skin, but by the content of their character."		Do you know what that means?	You do not.		You say GOP white/male.		GOP 1st AfricanAmerican in Congress.
@JesseKellyDC @JackPosobiec @realDonaldTrump You may be right, but can they understand a warning that if they are involved in another 9/11, next time, no troops they will be bombed out of existence.		Key problem, this region has caused problems for USA, Russia, China, and India.		Now they find "rare earth" minerals????
@RealDrGina 	Dr Gina,	If I may intrude all but briefly.		Taking aside the politics, the figures do not stack up.		In Broward County when 63,000 votes found, 90% were for Democrats.		The point you make, I agree with, in 2018, this type of  fraud has to have run its last race.	GB
@VP @narendramodi Excellent Mr Vice-President.	Many do not realize &amp; many forget that India was staunch ally in WW1 &amp; WW2.		India lost more than 1.5 million people in WW2, and are a real ally in South-Asia.		Very well done, that at this time you act to support such a valued global partner.
@davidaxelrod 	Mr Axelrod,	You are an intellectual man, but not all your decisions are good.		This goes to wife of man who has supported one of two main American political parties, helping Democracy.		Are you saying his wife should not get credit?		In MeToo era, shame on you.
@morgfair Stop taking free shots, when you have neither the intellect, nor commonsense, to back up your argument!		DT has his hands on pulse of America &amp; World like no leader I have seen.		The handpat in Paris from Putin &amp; surprised thanks from DT said talks will go well, as will China.
@morgfair Behave yourself.		Because in a time of trouble you would ask for big man's help.		Leave him do his job, or watch America under a mountain of debt he did not create, sink below China, India, Russia, Germany and then you can wonder why!
@ChrisJZullo Do you know nothing of history.		America post Civil War was a sleeping giant, came into WW1, and tipped the scales.		Until 1941 USA only supplying arms, to Europe.		Pre WW1 and WW2 Europe the most heavily militarized area on Earth, but not strong enough.		USA came in, game over.
@washingtonpost USA MILITARY Edge Blunted		Congress, both sides,		This President, been right all along to want all branches of military incl Space built up.		Gen. Henry Knox (Fort Knox)  1st USA Secretary of War for George Washington, then richest man in world, my ancestor, would agree with DT.
@RhondaDanielso2 	Thank you for your tweet.		Without doubt Democrat Party has long way to go before believed credible.		But it will be worse for them if they continue to stop this President, spook markets, and cost hardworking Americans their 401K money.		Typical &amp; not fair.
@realDonaldTrump @JennyLynnO1 Mr President,	He is ex-NASA &amp; has served, 	but enough is enough.		Mr President	Californian fires horrific.		As Speaker Pelosi's State, you can both implement my 10 yr Plan Proposal 8E.		Start in Ca.(fires gone)&amp; SC (USA farmers drought free), &amp; you use USA made steel to do it.
@rising_serpent @dwlove9 Florida Vote Corruption		Brenda Snipes was held by a Court of Law to have violated several voting laws.		Any critic has the right to rely upon those decisions.		No person suggesting Snipes is good at her job, has any credibility or commonsense, given those judgements.
@Tim_Canova @ReneeMcCone Shame, Beautiful woman,	Makes you wonder if she has a wish to go to prison.		A-G's are not immune to prosecution over criminal negligence, nor possibility she has been paid to turn a blind eye.		Clearly she will protest, but inaction by her &amp; Rick Scott, smells.		Floridians lose.
@IvankaTrump 	URGENT.   ---.  URGENT	CNN Action re: Acosta	Please go to your Dad.	1. 1st Amendment does not apply.	2. Entry by invitation of POTUS.	3. Press knew from 1969.	Plus	4. White House Official home of President.	Hence invitation.		Action has no merit.	Lesson Ban CNN 1 yr
@magnettothesea 	STEVIE NICKS Tour Illness		What is this I hear about the lady I have loved my entire adult life being ill on tour?		Sweetheart, last time I was with you, you introduced me to Tom Petty and now Tom is gone.		Sweetie, be safe, life is precious, as are you, to me.	x
President Xi Yinping	Tiger &amp; Rhinoceros Part Ban	President Xi,	Your decision to maintain a ban on taking &amp; using parts from these animals, in China, shows you have a Good Face.		You are a distinguished man, it is right for you to use your power to protect these at risk animals
@canalzone721 	Thank you for your tweet.
@ChrissyAnn7876 	Thank you Christina.
@CJHanselman 	Thank you for your tweet.
@brandyazUSA 	Thanks for your tweet.		I believe your State has gone blue.	Enough to make John McCain rise up.
@fdmaynard 	Thanks for your tweet.
@politicalnutcr1 	Thanks Wesley.
@dwlove9 	How are you doing?		California, terrible, nothing so destructive as fire.		You can tell those who have been in fires, due to one fact.		In big fire, it is not heat, it's  noise, fire wind is deafening.		I pray for those in California those suffering loss, fighting fires
@Cb59Carolina75 	Great shot of Tiger,	Thank you for your tweet.
@susieqfarmgirl 	Susie,	Thank you.	Give him a hug, kiss, and tell him you love him.	And well done.		No man can ever understand the bond between Mother &amp; Child, you see it in animals, and although unseen in humans, it is fiercely there.		Well Done.
@jaketapper @WSJ And that Mr Tapper is why President Trump is focused on USA trading as a solvent entity.		As you brought this issue up, as a loyal American, you must support that objective as worthwhile, surely?
@StephenAtHome You stirrer.	Why not have some comedy?	Check on Hillary's emails.	Oh, that's right, she lost them.		Hillary, lost emails, lost Ambassador in Libya, lost in 2016, will lose in 2020.		Hillary Tombstone:	"Tried. Trumped".
@MSNBC Absolutely.	Normal person will see young girl reach out left hand for microphone, Acosta right hand came down to her inside elbow, in a block.		I saw DT move from lecturn when he did that, Acosta very lucky.		Press must remember White House entry is by Presidential invitation.
@ChrissyAnn7876 	Thanks Christina,	Your Mum in Photo?.		Hillary wants to run in 2020.	History will call her Dennis Connor, USA politics.		Great start, some wins, got cocky, then embarrassed Party trying to defeat 2 Term President Trump		On her headstone 2 words:	"Tried. Trumped".
@susieqfarmgirl 	Thanks again Susie.
@realDonaldTrump 	Mr President,	Macron needs history lesson		General deGaulle post WW2, in 5th Estate sought to move France from dependency on USA rebuild.		But, he was not so rude as to not thank USA and other Allies for the help they gave France, to restore her way of life.
@susieqfarmgirl 	I tweeted lady who lost her son, great example of:	"Best &amp; brightest"		We live because they give.		You have one, in uniform too be proud.		DT spoke to fallen in France, who fell so we could stand up.		Anyone forgets that, they forget the reason for living.		Life.
@BostonMaggie 	So sorry.	Your Son looked like he was a stand-up no-nonsense sort of guy, a family man, good man to have a quiet beer or two with, play some pool, then lean back and let him tell you about his newborn.		Such a loss, thank you for your contact.	Keep in touch please.
@jigsawdeal 	Hey,	Just so long as she is not catching the midnight train to Georgia.	Q:	Do you like Slow Train Coming?		Thank you for your support.	Get some love.
@ReneeMcCone 	Hello Dr McCone.		Clearly you are right.		A GOP united front supporting President Trump is ideal, but the vageries of human nature and ego, with politics &amp; power do not always easily fit.		He will deal with Democrats.	Do Democrats want a legacy as builders/creators?
@Darkohako 	Thanks Steve,	Keep in touch will you please.
@TIREDofTERROR 	American Woman.	Great song, Burton Cummings and Guess Who?		Terror crazy, Melbourne, City I love, and soul of Australia, got hit again by a nutcase.		And California being terrorised by nature.		God Bless California and all standing in defiance of nature's ravages.
@RubyRockstar333 	Thanks Ruby.
@sunset6798	Thanks Mollie,	You are right GOP must be a team.	However understand, Donald Trump is President to help all Americans.	If GOP does not stand with him, he will do deals with the Democrats giving them credit, if it is good for USA.
Thanks for your tweet please keep in touch.
@Jt428cj 	Jim Tuttle,	I presume you are an American, through &amp; through.	Yours is such an unusual name, are you related to the Tuttle, Western writer who was like Ernest Hemingway.	If you are, you must be, I loved his books, your history predates Civil War.	Yes, GOP must be a team
@forthetruth_ 	Love your tag lines.	You are right, stand as a team.	No question DT has the guts, do the other Republicans.	Or do Democrats put his agenda into action, claim the credit, and ironically Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, Schumer get credit for pushing greatest USA success.
@caselvis58 	Hi Cheryl,	Love me tender, love me true		He was quite the performer just a truly gifted natural.		Ironically, President Trump appears to wear the cloak of President very well also.		Absolutely, Republicans must stand as a team, what a golden opportunity to lift  USA.
@CJHanselman 	To a humoress skeptical,	You are right, it must be a team effort.	Especially with what Dem's have got planned.	Time to "circle the wagons".		Pity Democrats do not want to be positive for USA with the most positive President possible.
@sunset6798 	Thank you for your tweet, you are right.
@mkl300 	Hello Monica,	Are you one of the silent majority who supports DT &amp; want action?	I agree with your thought, it is a team effort for USA.	Republicans should stand up.
@rpmmasaya 	Roberto,	You opinion is right.	Actions speak louder than words.	At least with DT you get action, but I agree with you, it is meant to be a team effort.	Thanks keep in touch.
@Slaughth1 	Plenty of hypocrisy.	Fortunately DT is countering it with plenty of action.
@CommonSenseSqu1 	Absolutely.	This is the difference between this President and others of recent years.	If you follow his history, and his interviews and books he has clearly had an intent to be President unless another did it well, they did not he will.	Commonsense	Keep in touch
@Darkohako 	You are right.		They must act together and act responsibly.		You know what human beings are like, they like a trail boss, but unless being relatively self sufficient themselves, they become reliant upon the boss.		You would wish not, but humans are creatures of habit.
@TIREDofTERROR 	Thank you
@tommyhedrick 	Thanks for your tweet.		Just imagine if you ran a business on this Floridian level of efficiency, or if you consulted and gave advice leading to it.		You would be out of business quicker than you could blink.		God Bless you.
@Darkohako @RichardTBurnett Take look at the Costa video.	At one stage when Costa was rude to the girl, and had downward blocked her arm, President Trump moved from behind his lecturn.		He was prowling, if your a man who can genuinely read sign, believe me DT would have clicked him, and DT is a big man.
@GovMikeHuckabee @VPNightshade Governor,	Very Christian of you.	Great sense of humour.		Question		Can Hillary be exported over there on a two for one deal?		No idea what to use her for, but can guarantee whatever it is she will screw it up.
@FLOTUS Trust to sensible women to get along, while the men quabble over the Price of Wheat.
@VPNightshade 	Yes seen it.		Way economy going, if she runs, it will be Trump landslide.		Hillary	Talk about past used by date.
@HuffPost French jibe at Trump.		President Trump did not go as French failed to see route was secure for Secret Service to clear.		Last 2 big times France did not secure country, Germany walked in and USA, UK, NZ, &amp; others had to hold their hand while throwing Germans out.		Macron, stupid.
@SHAPE_NATO That short synopsis says it all, but due to WW2 being only 21yrs it does not say enough.	After Pol Pot, Rwanda, Sudan, ISIS, to suggest the Holocaust must not happen again, is just not heard.	The world is full of very cruel people.	Thank God for USA, for you give us what we have.
@realDonaldTrump Yes.	Given your assistance in keeping with the arms supply deal started by President Barack Obama, one would hope Saudi Arabia exercises a degree of gratitude and does not aggravate the pricings.		Fortunately USA independent.
@kateMAGA3 Thank you for your tweet.	I feel as you do.		Ironically, the catalyst may be this debacle in Florida.		God Bless.
@Susrez 	Hi Susan,		Just think how the Democrats will jump up &amp; down, when DT decides to move on Roe v Wade?		Nancy Pelosi will look like a Mexican jumping bean, Chuck Schumer will be crying, and Steny Hoyer will be handing him tissues.		Do they really care - No!		God Bless.
@brandyazUSA 	Thank you for your tweet.
@nancy73gg 	You followed my tweets.	I was fairly wide ranging, hope you think I made some commonsense.
@kateMAGA3 	Hi Kate,	Why do Democrats care for their egos more than USA.		Dem's with 9/11, could not impeach George W. Bush.		Notwithstanding nonsense from idiot Michael Moore.		So POTUS, cops it in neck for Bill not keeping hands off an intern, then lying about it		Its Revenge
@nancy73gg 	Hi Nancy,	How was Venice?
@Actibonnie 	Thanks Bonnie,	Age is not a barrier.	Attitude is.	Clearly for you, neither is.	Good on you.
@JANIGAYL 	I see now.	Very clever, very funny.
@JANIGAYL 	Thanks Jani
@JANIGAYL 	Hi Janice,	Thank you for your tweet.	You referred me to something of Kellyanne, sorry I am tired, just about to go to bed, let me know please.	Like you I am a staunch supporter of President Trump.	Democrats are an ongoing joke.
@debs4trump 	Thanks Debbie.
@radma11 	Thanks Ruthie for your tweet.
@Actibonnie 	Thanks Bonnie,	And why not health &amp; beauty.
@CorinneMCH @realDonaldTrump You are nuts.	Democrat accountability is akin to trying to clean a windscreen on a moving vehicle with a muddy rag, and wipers which don't work.	You are still travelling, no clue where you are heading, nor commonsense to stop &amp; think first.	You are not in WH so how do you know?
@WillyLimp @SABRINASPICE3 @RickTamargo @realDonaldTrump Benghazi, happened during President Obama, with Hillary Clinton Sec of State.		Get your years straightened out, please.
@debs4trump 	Debbie,	Thank you for your tweet.		Hardly good news.	But worthy of a laugh.		I could hardly focus earlier.	No not depleted blood sugar levels.		The announcement Hillary is running in 2020.		Well if she starts now, she'll be fit, and beaten fair and square by DT.
@radma11 	Ruthie,	Thanks for your tweet.
@Riskographer2 	Thanks for your tweet.	You love great novels 	Can you imagine the novel to be written on this President after his second term, his history, legacy, and the boundless conspiracy theorists who will try to rewrite history.		There are some wonderful American novels.
@DrDannielle 	Thank you for your reply.	Clearly you agree.	Please keep in touch.
@Nancy1959 	Thank you Nancy for your tweet.	The last American Nancy I had dealings with, was the late First Lady Nancy Reagan, back in 1987.		I introduced the First Lady to the Australian Women's Institute whose patrons were Lady Sonia McMahon, and Dame Vera Lynn.		Keep in touch.
@Laurelblack20 	Hello, thank you for your tweet.	If I need flowers over there I now know who to instruct &amp; pay.	Can you believe Hillary?	Unbelievable.	Do you know, no-one has fully resolved the missing US$134million from the failed Arkansas deal.	She is a fraudster
@mxdrace 	Thank you for your tweet.
@ADeplorableBeam 	Thanks for your tweet.
@joann1304 	Thanks for your tweet.	America is unique, the French forget without USA troops/arms/help, France would not have her identity.		France to rebuild post WW2, de Gaulle asked for 7 million champagne bottles to sell, to be out of Marshall Plan.		Most sold to USA buyers.
@DrDannielle 	Danielle,	Thank you for your tweet.	Nice to see you have a normal sense of humour.	Keep in touch please.
@FLOTUS 	May I pay you a compliment, without incurring your wrath or of your husband, or other members of your family?	1. You are a superb looking woman, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy looks plain.	2. The only woman I have seen who will surpass you in the White House will be Ivanka.
@FLOTUS 	Your husband was perfect in his address in France.		No one could have done it better.		You should be very proud.		Take care Madam First Lady, carry on your good work.
@DrDannielle Danielle,	Thank you for your reply.		Your qualification is great.	You must appreciate the heaven sent coincidence allowing you to compare screen with reality of USA political scene, as playing out.	Topped off by Hillary stating she will run in 2020.	There is a thesis in itself!
@Maggieboo15 	Thanks for your tweet.
@Olga55964841 	Hello Olga,	Thank you for your tweet, and I can promise you President Trump thanks and respects you for your support.
@ellen78834490 	Thank you Ellen.
@dubes09	Thank you Carole.
@RodStryker @kateMAGA3 @POTUS You do not know just how right your crazy notion may be.	On the face of it, it looks like a cunning plan.		What though is your thought on Hillary still trying to be President 		Given her record of Federal and State paid jobs she is a "Bludger-in-Chief".
@trendsNewsday @ellen78834490 Mssr Le Presidente Macron,		Tu est tres foux.		Etas Unis est tres grande amie por France.		Regardez moi s'il vous plait:		You have no regard for the sacrifice of Allies to save France, you are no better than a "collaborateur".		Tu est vraiment penible.
@JennyLynnO1 	Thanks, you are so cool, and a real whippersnapper!
@PaulRieckhoff 	Have you let The President know there are problems.		The timing could not be more perfect.		If he is aware of problem in Veterans Program, it will be fixed.		Call the White House ASAP.
@Nancy1959 	Thank you Nancy.		I thought President Trump was very measured and respectful at the service.		Just what servicemen and women, and relatives of those who have fallen, want to see from The Commander in Chief.		He continues to pleasantly surprised.
@foxandfriends 	URGENT	What is this about a Federal Prosecutor being sent to Broward County to investigate corrupt practice including allegations of voter fraud, being found shot dead one month ago?		If this is true, send in USA Marshall's and sort it out.
@RichardTBurnett 	Good stuff!
@IngrahamAngle 	What is this about a Federal Prosecutor who was sent to Broward County to check up on fraud allegations, being found dead one month ago?		If that is the case, old USA law needs to be invoked.		Send in US Marshall's.
@IngrahamAngle 	Love your show,	Presentation great, content first-class, argue both sides.	This situation crazy.	With Dem's control of House Bill on Voter Identification, will not ever get through.	Unless GOP introduce under urgency, or unless POTUS uses National Security reason.
@dcrow_baby 	Deanna,	Thank you.	Notice he has not responded	He knows why, and so do I.
@mjs_DC @xbrooklynite21 That is out-of-time.	Twitter rewrite.
@mjs_DC @xbrooklynite21 You could not get much higher condemnation.		But will Supreme Court act?		Does President Trump have to ask the acting Attorney General to intervene, and ask SC for a ruling on the validity of the out-of-town votes and the contaminated ones?
@MSNBC Andrew Gillum,	Did you not concede?	Are you not a man of your word?	If you win, enjoy your victory clearly you do not realize in politics you play the long game.	Voters will not forget your word is worthless.	You will be surprised when that bites you, just when you need support.
@RubyRockstar333 @TomCrompton3 @jack @realDonaldTrump @parscale @TwitterSupport Just another I'll informed moron.	Apparently, the French had not made provisions which met with Secret Service security protocols.	Consequence did not attend.		Morons seem to forget that what started WW1 was a political assassination, so on this day of all days, no errors please.
@jaketapper @CNN Mr Tapper,	No joke, have you been in a big fire eg: 150,000 acres?		Guys/Girls at scene fighting fiercely risking lives.		When fires over DT must bring in my Proposal 8E, I can stop fires coming back, like this, if begun, early 2019		8E starts Ca. &amp; SC, stops Ca. fires from 2025.
@1776Stonewall @xbrooklynite21 You are right.		But how to solve.		Is there any precedence for Supreme Court overturning a MidTerm Election result?		If not imagine difficulty in getting that heard?
@Riskographer2 @fdmaynard That is just crazy.	Democrat supporters?		Have to ask, looking at the woman in the left, I did not realize Hillary Clinton had aged so much?		She can't run for Office, she can't even run for a bus.
@jaxs5858 	I have to ask, is the dog;	1. Longsighted?	2. Shortsighted?	3. Looking for sympathy?		Crazy times, if you cheat or lie, you are done!
@JohnBir48070606 @gpnavonod @ScottforFlorida You are right.	The authenticity issue can be supported with the same technology used in banknotes, with initiation using the retina scan, you could even put a PIN with it.		What is going on is appalling.
@ScottforFlorida @xbrooklynite21 Governor,	I took a verbal shot at you before with respect to your F&amp;F interview.		I can not understand why as Governor you did not sack Commissioner, nor took fomal request to A-G to have it done, due to wider public interest.		You did have authority to remove Sheriff, why not?
@JennyLynnO1 	Do you like my name for her	"Bludger-in-Chief"
@DrDannielle 	Hi Danielle,	Thank you for your tweet.		DT had to say something, but as Jane pointed out and you support, he is damned if he does, and if he said nothing, others would criticize 		May I ask what discipline of your Doctorate is please?
@JennyLynnO1 @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz @DRUDGE @FoxNews @FLGovScott @marcorubio @MarcCox971 @FBIMiamiFL @FBI @DHSgov @VP @kilmeade @TheJusticeDept @DrDannielle @gatewaypundit Jane,	Yes, absolutely.		Sorry,	I can hardly speak or tweet right now, I am in shock.		Hillary Clinton announced she is running for President in 2020.		I can not speak well nor tweet because I am laughing too much.		The USA's Bludger-in-Chief is back.		Hysterical.
@MSNBC President Trump,	In a non-partisan way, trying to draw a line under votes which are credible 	Clearly The Commissioner in Broward County has admitted putting votes of illegals in with legitimate late votes, contaminating them.	Actions mistake or fraud.	9 years in job? Idiotic
@BillKristol @HowieCarrShow No-one should abuse you, for reasons, below, even when you appallingly wrong.	Reasons:	1. You have heard it before.	2. As before, you don't care	(1st Amend protects right).	3. Your contrary opinions:	a. Usually well expressed.	b. Use plausible intelligent arguments.(Confuse us)
@dcrow_baby 	Deanna,	Thank you.
@dcrow_baby 	Thanks Deanna,	Love you like my views, as I like yours.	Tell me about yourself if you wish, message me privately.	If you wish.
@Sherry40614670 	Thanks Sherry,	Two thanks, different tweets, different issues.	Now I am curious.	You may message me if you wish.
@customautotrim 	Thanks for your tweet.
@BenPrestonhp 	Thanks Ben.	Amazing how others cause trouble yet everyone else is to blame.	Islam, and others, need to stand up, face up, and be accountable.
@JennyLynnO1 	Thanks Jane,	You are a class act alright.	God Bless you and USA!
@SneakerHandbook 	Thanks for your tweet.	I am now a follower.
@Believe_N_USA 	Thanks for your tweet.
@LibertyNow10 	Thanks Salt of the Earth.		What a schnozzle!		Though after hearing Rick Scott on Fox &amp; Friends, I know he was on ground during hurricane season, but I will bet Donald Trump gave him considerable backbone.
@Sherry40614670 	Thanks Sherry.
@JennyLynnO1 @realDonaldTrump @RepMattGaetz @DRUDGE @FoxNews @FLGovScott @marcorubio @MarcCox971 @FBIMiamiFL @FBI @DHSgov @VP @kilmeade @TheJusticeDept @DrDannielle @gatewaypundit Jane,	Given the consequences of these previously unknown ballots calling in the "bomb squad" is apt.		Clearly the vote registrar and sheriff are corrupt and should have been sacked by Gov. Scott, he did not.		Did you see his F&amp;F interview?	Duck shover (weak)		He was nearly crying
@realDonaldTrump Absolutely!		Great speech in France, you did the fallen and those who serve, very proud.		Just as a Commander in Chief should, and you did.		Rick Scott Florida is weak, watch him, if he does not get his way (e Tu Brute').		God Bless you Donald.		California needs Proposal 8E.
@foxandfriends 	Rick Scott - Florida	Thanks and your restraint.		When you asked why not sack woman after judicial ruling he blinked,  answer akin to child losing toys.		Why not ask about Sheriff.		Governor has power sack both, he knew, but he got Broward votes to be Governor.
@BenPrestonhp @avachat110 Well said.	Unbelievable.	After the carnage, followers of Islam (alleged) have been involved in from Embassy bombings (1990's), 9/11, Madrid, London, Paris, Nice, Moscow, beheadings Libya, now mass ISIS graves found, the faith of Islam needs to front up.	Wars post 9/11, after fact
@Independent Re Attack Trump Card Fires		You experts can have a go at President but do not dare have a go at me.		I have been in Forest Fires &amp; work I enacted 1984-85 in Vic, Australia, was told 2011, without it Black Saturday fire toll 1600+ not 183.		Trump trying to get action, help him!
@Independent Attack on Trump re: Ca Fires	I take offence at this.	He is right in part but does not express himself well.	- FED AID has not been cut	BUT	1. Experts raise droughts.	2. California aquifer at 10%.	3. Ca. drying out.	Cause (1,2,3?)	For 40 yrs no-one refilled aquifer to cool ground.
Hon. Winston Peters.		Compliments I do not often pay to you, albeit you are deserving of many.		However,	Your comment today on the speech of French President Macron was correct.		We lost 3 at Somme (Knox) remembered every year.		NZ's sacrifices changed this country.		Well said!
Governor Jerry Brown		California is world's 9th biggest economy.		Rightly you seek Federal assistance over your fires.		But what are you doing?		Under Arnold and you, your State is dry &amp; back in Office you have been more focused on your retirement.		Hand job to younger person.
@Believe_N_USA 	Thank you for your tweet.		I feel DT did real well.		When media were saying what events he should be remarking upon, he ignored them all, Thank God and paid tribute only to those for whom the day exists.		If that is standard DT sets, then how can you oppose it?
@WashTimesThreat @tommyhedrick This is just a joke.		In fourth most populous US State and 4th richest, this is the respect voters in Broward County receive for voting.	The whole system is flawed.	Is it that hard, to lock full boxes, and when vote closes to have picked up by State agents?	No 3rd party at all.
@USATrump45 @JennyLynnO1 That is just ridiculous.		Why don't the Democrats rewrite history, or redraft the Bible?		Here is the biggest test for the US Supreme Court, and unexpectedly for President Trump.		These new finds, everywhere must be tested for validity.		Given Federal impact, SC jurisdiction.
@Sherry40614670 	Thanks Sherry.		She has been quite a week.		MidTerms, Melbourne Cup, 100 years since the end of the War to end all Wars, World War One.		Yet 21 years later we did it again, and worse.		Would we would have war	If politicians in France told, you fight first.		GB.
@AmandaLeeHouse 	Hi Amanda,	Guess next 2 years to be high times politically.		Fervent ground for political conspiracy theorists.		I have funny feeling Mueller will announce nothing found then watch Democrat knives aim at his back.		To help DT next 2 yrs, sell his PMA to USA.	Tks.
@mattgaetz 	Like the cut of your jib.		In your role, rely on no-one but President &amp; you.		Your allegiance must be to your State, President, Flag.		Beware others even in your own State who may involve you in matter, you can easily resolve prior to moving on.		Florida vote, ask DT!
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,		FYI-Twitter auto corrects a wrong spelling of Trump name now, by error typed Yrump. Trump name now part of the ether.		Thank for your tweet.		Of concern, there are some nutcases saying things about your Dad, I defend when I can.		DT did well in France.
@PaulaJa22779473 @LibertyNow10 I am getting a little nervous.		The Governor of Florida says 	1. He is heading to DC	2. He gets things done, and wants to help DT do same.		But,	3. He declares victory b4 1.	4. Knows corrupt he fails to:	a. Fire Broward Elect. Officer	b. Fire Sheriff.		Gov. Scott, DT is efficient
@Believe_N_USA 	Thank you.		In 2024, when DT leaves after 2 Terms in Office, I do believe America will have financially and socially, derived great benefit.		And one word to describe his Presidency will be the one I tweeted before he used it, it is appropriate:	"Commonsense"
@trngchief11 @DavidNakamura No,	There is nothing clear about what you said.		In fact what you said is such a garbled load of rubbish I would seriously question:	1. Your sanity.	2. Your coworkers safety in the job you do.		You need a physiological evaluation, unless as I suspect, you seek 15 mins of fame
@trngchief11 @DavidNakamura Ken	With respect if I was Director of FBI, I would order investigation into you.		How dare you suggest the sworn Defender of the USA	Constitution tramples on it.		And calling President Trump a traitor is beyond the pale.		You are AA and as DT helps AA's a disgrace to your race.
@trngchief11 @DavidNakamura Ken,	Think before tweeting.	Bluntly,	1. Russia/USA have been in proxy wars for 60 years.	2. A talking DT trying a reset 	(Do you like best/brightest in USA serving/dying in stupid conflicts?)		DT view.	Have biggest stick, so big your enemy will not want you using it - deterrent
@trngchief11 @DavidNakamura Ken,	Syria yes.	2016 no		Respectfully,	The suggestion farmers in Michigan, Pennsylvania for example, voted for DT due to anything Russia did in 2016 is ludicrous.		There is a real difference b/w factual acts &amp; imagined.		I feel anyone suggesting DT would harm USA should be jailed
@foxandfriends 	Donald Trump		Presenter		You said it better than I have heard.		Donald Trump understands who voted for him, and to whom he is responsible.		Sara, is right,		Donald Trump will make deals, if the deals can not be done, Democrats will be exposed for foolishness.
@realDonaldTrump 	Poland,	A true ally of America.
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,	Your Dad did very well in France, not that I need to tell you to be proud of him.		Those fires are horrific.		God Bless the United States of America on this Day of Remembrance.
President Trump.		Well done.		The speech commemorating 100 years since the end of World War One was perfect 		You remembered things of importance to this day, and in your own style rightly and properly paid tribute to the fallen and serving American soldiers of all hue and rank
@foxandfriends 		URGENT		World War US Vet sacrifice.		Remember, post-WW2, USA rebuilt Japan, and rebuilt Europe through MARSHALL Plan.		If you lived in Europe you would know European leaders wanted Marshall Plan, but not obligations.		USA did not start either WW just ended them.
@CoryBooker 		Well done Senator Booker,		Today is the day they are remembered for their selflessness, not anyone or anything else.		Do not know if you lost any in either WW but African-Americans, like our Maori served with bravery and distinction.		Well done to you!
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,	I just can not believe some of the tripe written about your Father it is sickening.		I guess your Father is like an old West sheriff, goes in to clean up, is attacked by those scared of being found out, then job done, not wanted.		His loyalty to USA fullon
@washingtonpost @morgfair Trump Frightened	Honestly, you are a very clever but highly delusional conspiracy theorist when DT	1. Will not shut Mueller.	2. 6x used IRS bankruptcy law to save biz.	3. Repaid all debt/interest	4. Checked by IRS on audit.		Your factless article theory baseless.		Why would he?
@sarah_siskin One can but try.	And Donald does have big feet so from time to time he does shoot himself in foot.		But, seriously, in the end USA will be better off.		Old style Democrats seeing they are left behind, fight for their identity.		Their new Mbrs of Congress want change &amp; progress.
@sarah_siskin Thank you Sarah.		Look we do not know each other, but I do know some key players, going back to Arlen Spectre.		Have dealt with past/now:	300+ Mbrs House/Senate;	Governors, 4 Presidents, incl P. Reagan, &amp; many wealthy Americans.		You must read b/w lines.	Donald is cleaning house.
@sarah_siskin Granted.	What you say is true.	Politics is a nasty business makes for strange bedfellows	WW's you know Americans laid lives on line for Europe, 		DT is saying you do not get away with that		With respect to Mrs Obama, rule of thumb, prior POTUS's stay silent, Obama acted 1st	Truth
@soogemini68 	Thanks for your tweet.	For decades forests in Ca, owned by families worth up to US$100Bn have grown absent viable u/growth chks	Some cut 2% only.	When f/fires spillover, killing innocents, noone including Gov.Brown will take these rich families on.	Usual is to sue.
@trngchief11 @DavidNakamura Ken,	You disappoint me.	How does he align himself with Vladimir Putin?	We are 70 years past Stalin who slaughtered millions.	Putin runs the largest country on Earth 9 t/zones.	Russian forests store CO2, enough to kill us all.	We must get on now.	Stop stabbing DT in back.
@DavidNakamura @trngchief11 Do you think for just one moment the Americans who fought and died or survived, would appreciate USA being linked in to Communist and Fascist regimes given USA lives lost + Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe.		Trump is there for Vets, but does not like company.		Respect the Vets
@sarah_siskin 	Hello Sarah,	Who cheated?		Florida and even Arizona is an affront to honest people in USA, who voted for result.		You must admit, post 2016 the last 2 years of continual attacks need to end. 		You also know they will last until 2020 at least.
@soogemini68 	Thank you.		Nice to be liked by someone who sees truth.		1984-85 in fire (150K acres) N/east Victoria, Australia, running part cleanup post 1983 Ash W/day, fires (71 died).	Much Ca. forest owned by  very rich families, spillover fires kill innocents.	Should be sued.
@DanRather Are you going to apologize for this now you know truth.		I would trust your historical integrity would allow you to promote truth rather than a deliberate left shot on a day such as this.		I lost 3 relatives at Sommes, so please, choose your words carefully.
@RealMuckmaker @sarah_siskin Tell me please,	Do you speak for all people who voted Donald Trump President under Electoral College System.	Are you so enamoured with your own ego, you believe you know more than Adams, Franklin, Jefferson etc..who created this system and the millions who voted.	You are a fool.
@kersti_malvre @realDonaldTrump Respectfully,	Not to take President's side but know history.	In late 1970's California had major fires in the Orange County.	Governor = Jerry Brown	Neither Schwarzenegger nor Brown 2nd Edition did anything, relying on business to control	They do not act as it costs too much money
@realDonaldTrump President Trump,	Is right!.	The same thing happens in the State of Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, leading to Black Saturday which burned 4 million acres killing 183.	Not the main problem, but lack of firebreaks &amp; undergrowth control encourages firestorms.
@PutinRF_Eng President Putin,	Very nice to see you at Armistice Day Memorial, Paris, France 	Noone from the Western Powers can comprehend the loss of over 23 million people, as Russia suffered.	Russia became our ally WW2, USA has been friend to you, we must end any drama.	Russia too important
@foxandfriends 	Armistice 1918	Not to forget that straight after the end of World War 1,	The Influenza Epidemic hit killing over 100 million.	Almost as if the world cried.
@foxandfriends 	URGENT		Today,	Armistice Remembrance.		Please can the banner talking about Khashoggi.		Today 100 years on that is in very bad taste.		Electronically remove it please.		I am a Fox Friend		Thank you.
@SteveWinst57 	Thanks for your fast tweet.		I could not help myself.
@elonmusk So,	How bigger deal do you want to be involved with?		Or have you had a restraint of trade imposed upon you?
@Newsweek That is a 'prick' of an accusation.
@TIME C: Oh, well of coouurrsse!		C: One must have a tipple, musn't one.		C: Or two.		C: No, no, not that renewable energy to refuel, let's try that 2005 Cloudy Bay from New Zealand.		C: Now where's my corkscrew?		Aide: No your Highness it's a screwtop.		Charles: Clever little kiwi's.
@kilmeade @MorganOrtagus @foxandfriends Book - Andrew Jackson		Do you cover Astor period?	Do you know Jackson's greatest in Office move.		He sent 2m+ "Conestoga" settlers to California, Oregon Washington, to stop Russia seizing these States under a Treaty (reason for 2nd Am.).		One my ancestors James Knox Polk (11th).
@Believe_N_USA 	Thanks for your tweet and your commonsense.
@customautotrim 	Thanks for your tweet.		I am certain you realize, a public servant refusing to obey Court Order commits Contempt of Court.		Only resolution is for that or higher Court to issue:	1. Arrest warrant for person.	2. Warrant for seizure.		Use local law or State/FBI.
@KipTalleyDC 	You have Court Order &amp; public servant not obeying.	1. Go back to Court urgently.	2. Request 2 warrants arrest and seize documents to prevent perversion justice	3. If local law enforcement not act use FBI/State.	4. Sen. Rubio asks DT for EO doing everything FBI acts.
@LibertyNow10 I have given you your answer a few moments ago.		Do you realize you have tweeted me more than 10x in very short time.		Cool down!		I am not the Florida sheriff nor the Court or vote Official if you expend as much with them maybe it will be fixed.		Keep me informed, you must focus
@LibertyNow10 You do not read, an Order was produced &amp; disobeyed.		US Judiciary will not accept County Sheriff usurping authority of Court.		On Grounds refusal to obey lawful Court Order go back to Court or get leave to go higher, get Warrant to seize &amp; do so.		No excuses, there is no grey.
@Education4Libs @tomferrari To a degree you are right, but California has a much more serious problem, which unless taken care of will turn California into a continually fire ravaged State.	As the 9th biggest economy on Earth, plus 40m people, that is crazy.	I will not publish problem I want to fix it - 8E.
@TinaLayne77 	Hypocrites, liars, and thieves stick in my craw.		No excuse in politics, judged on acts.		That is where DT rewrites script.		Many say he is doing what he campaigned on, critics &amp; others fail to see level of his forethought before he made promises.		DT is very smart.
@LibertyNow10 	No disrespect but, tone down language.		I am not a prude, can swear like a muleskinner if I wish.		But, given situation, cool reasoned thought coupled with calm decisive action will fix this mess quickly.		USA citizens have right to a functioning elected Govt.
@LibertyNow10 @POTUS In 2018, there should be no voter fraud, but human beings are human beings.		There is no reason, why without going online, voters do not go to polling station, retina scan, get form, form vote loaded in system, retina scan to close, vote locked in.		Get Bill Gates to write code.
@LibertyNow10 If you wish to get action you must work in system.		Sen. Rubio can question but he can act if has a quickly organized petition before him with say 500 to 1000 signatures of people who live in Florida, vote affecting functioning democracy of whole state.
@LibertyNow10 	Given you are certain about the Sheriff, and you have proof, which stacks up.		Take it to Senator Marco Rubio, ask him to put it before POTUS and he has the power to order Sheriff removed, under auspices of Sheriff being armed, if corrupt, public security issue.	GB
@CongPalazzo 	Hello Congressman,	Thank you for your tweet.		Remember when the public were led to question The President's use of Twitter.		The man sets his own rules, but has wisdom to listen.		Sorry about loss of House, but you must act to pass DT agenda Bills.		"Bird in hand.."
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,	Tk you.	Message me how to get you fast, Proposal 8E: 2018-2028. 	8E:	1. 10 yr build (100+ yr use).	2. 30m US jobs 3yrs, +3%pa.(S/floor to Exec).	3. US tech trfrs w/wide.	4. Eg benefits:	a. End CA wildfires.	b. Cut US 2012 emissions 51%.	5. Post-seed bourse
@HouseGOP 	Thank you for honor of your contact.		Sorry for loss of House, but, left victory so small bi-part co-operation' essential to make House run		You must be quick to pass legislation forming part of DT overall plan, for signing.		'Bird in hand' action please.		Contact me.
@SaraCarterDC 	Hello Sara,	You are a good journalist, nice to have a mechanism to communicate with you.	You may if you wish do that directly, by messaging.	Who knows, one day very soon, DT and IT may ask for Proposal 8E 2018-2028.	DT pro-active.	You may just get scoop.	Thank you
@ChuckGrassley 	Sir,	You do me great honor.	I followed your work through 110 &amp; 111 Congresses.		The American Democracy which my ancestors played part in furthering withstands many shocks, yet largely delivers for USA people.		Long may that continue, due in part to Rep's like you.
@nytmike 	Hello Michael,	Never let it be said American politics is dull or lifeless.	Washington DC makes the Court of St.James seem passe'.
@DiamondandSilk 	Thank you your tweet.		Media on DT for not being at WW1 ceremony, given his workload wonder still alive.		Mine fought (some died) at Somme, Flanders, Gallipoli, so well aware of (lost feet to footrot) but soldiers say	1. Nice of him to come	2. He's got job to do.
@radionz CALIFORNIAN FIRES	California will suffer larger wildfires, until State/Governor act different to Arnold, ring D.C. speak to D.T., tell him they must see 2018 version Schofield's Proposal 8E (hires to 30mn, 10yr build USA wide; 1 of 37 core benefits, elimination mass CA fires).
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews If you have a signed Court Order, and you are being denied access in accordance with that Order, you have Grounds on the basis of their actions with their motive and opportunity to get a Warrant to Urgently Seize, and instruct Police to enforce immediately on issuance.	Game over.
@cvpayne It is not evil, it is just crazy, it fly's in the face of true love, &amp; unintended consequence.		Albeit, given the cost of living, so many badly cared for &amp; mistreated children, in the cold light of day for the many without means, hmm.		But, not a good ad.
@IvankaTrump Semper Fidelis.	Sursum to the highest.
@marcorubio 	Good on you Senator Rubio,		Use your political weight, cut through the rubbish and invoke whatever legal weight and jurisprudence you can bring to bear before a wrong which is too difficult to undo, is perpetrated.	This strikes at the integrity of USA.	Well done.
@realTylerZed Clearly.	Export it to Syria, Iran, North Korea, China &amp; Russia, and the double negative might turn them good!
@BillKristol Is there any other reason?
@MaryMister8 	Thanks Mary.
@JennyLynnO1 	Jane,	Crazy, I dealt with Broward &amp; Dade Counties, as Broward made excellent superyachts, which I put staff on globally.		So I am very disappointed.		The Supreme Court should be asked to intervene as it appears Constitutional Election directive violated.	(Fairness).
@Tim_Walz 	Thank you for your tweet.	That is a great State you represent.	Correct me if wrong please, but has not Minnesota been a leader in water reticulation and use, critically the State being intimately involved with the research work of your tertiary institutions.	Tweet me.
@godisgood1961 Thanks Kim,	POTUS questioned:	"How come all ballots found for Democrats"	Forgive legal argument:	1. Election, constituted.	2. Legal proceeding.	3. Tampering = attempt to pervert justice.	4. FBI impound all materials, carry out complete recount.	5. Photo ID, future, retina scan.
@MikeGrunwald 	Hello Michael,	All President's have events which historically define Presidency.	President Obama 2008-2011 world 2nd lgst fiscal disaster		As Greenspan cash rate cuts 46/48 mths cost America aged investors discretionary spending, Obama did okay.		Post-2012 did not.
@Clyburn 	Rep. Clyburn,	Thank you for honoring me with your tweet.	I have seen your name in Congressional lists in past, so you are very experienced.		Away from political bias, keeping with Dr King's speech "....judged by content of character", what for you are Govt priorities.
@morgfair 	Thank you for your tweet &amp; your engagement.	I would love to read more on your take of foreign policy,	and other issues you value.		Given travels, experience, and access you received over many years offers you unique view, I would love to learn more.	Morgan, thank you.
@RepMattGaetz 	Hi Rep. Gaetz,	You came up due to Ronna following you and I.	Firstly, post midterms, good luck with your service, you are serving in the Government of the greatest country on Earth, be proud.	Secondly, how what is going on in Broward is happening is beyond me.
@GOPChairwoman 	Hi Ronna,	I say this to you tongue in cheek.	Please explain fairness to me, when Florida so clearly smacks of an attempt by the Democratic Party to pervert the course of justice.	Further, you are getting a roasting, at every turn	Keep strong, fight the good fight!
@IvankaTrump 	Ms Trump,	Great work on job creation, your team clearly good.	May I send you Proposal 8E 2018 version, self funding after seed, it reduces food stamp recipients 5%, and absorbs people who left w/force, 10 yrs implementation, global application. 	Message me securely.
@kateMAGA3 	Kate,	Kind regards you &amp; your veteran husband.	Hard to believe you are GM to 4.	How do you both feel about President Trump's strengthening military.	I think you need clear visible strength to avoid conflict.	Please ask husband does USA need 16 battle groups not 11?
@lilbrownpolgirl 	See I am under your spell already.	How?	I love independent thinkers.	That is what makes the world go around.
@meallycresser93 	Hi Wendy,	Thank you for your tweet.	Keep in touch please!
@tomferrari 	Hey Tom,	Thank you for your tweet.	You enjoy camping, outdoors, so do I, have done all my life.	That appreciation of nature is the only way in which you can appreciate what we have lost, and run the risk of losing.	Wait until DT moves on pollution, he will	God Bless
@godisgood1961 	Kim,	Thanks again.	Very impressed.
@jeananimal 	Thank you for your tweet.	How does Florida happen in 2018?
@marcorubio 	Senator Rubio,	2 questions:	1. Does current Gov. Scott have right to:	1.1 Call FBI to seize all records, as fraud has or may be committed?	or;	1.2 Ask President do same?	2. A rival for GOP  nomination 2016, your evaluation President Trumps' time in Office.	Thank You.
@godisgood1961 	Hello Kim,	Great hat, smile, attitude.	How does Florida happen in a modern America?	Love your positivity, and I am sure DT does too!	He would spend hours a week searching twitter.	Interesting, so many people now use Twitter, why, DT!	Love ya!
@MaryMister8 	Hi Mary,	Florida again.
@TomSarg11071833 	Tom,	Interesting DT in France.	Paying appropriate respect to troops fallen and survivors, who gave of themselves in selfless service of saving everyone.	Interesting to see P. Macron talk big until the man arrives	then "excusee moi, Monsieur le Presidente Trump".
@JennyLynnO1 	Thanks Jane.	Can you believe what is going on in Florida(and Arizona)?	Do believe Gov. Scott jumped the gun, but even so, so many votes being found, every vote should be verified.
@stellabardot1 	Guilty.	I have found you.	Now, what do I do with you?	First, thank you for your tweet.	Secondly, what issues are sticking in your craw?	Please come back to me, I like your sense of humour.
@tommyhedrick 	Thanks for your tweet.	These voting problems could be eliminated by the use of a voting card loaded with a biometric chip using a random right/left eye retina scan, as I had suggested earlier.	In 2018, for USA to not use as No1 OECD country, opens USA to ridicule.
@JulieAnneGenter 	Ms Genter,	Your aggression on behalf of your Ministry for Women is to be applauded.	The young lady who has pushed the issue of women being bullied or worse in the legal system in NZ appears smart, I would think a good addition to your Ministry.	Now Min. For Men.
@realDonaldTrump @USMC Mr President,	As a Mark of Respect to the US Marine Corps, not only can every free-thinking human being on Earth give thanks for the sacrifice of USMC, but, in a moment's reflection, I ask people to think how many millions of people their actions have saved.	USMC - God Bless you.
@RWPUSA 	Thank you Mr Painter, for your tweet.	Given your history including work on Ethics which really is meant to divide modernity from prior feudal systems, I have to ask for your view on Florida voting. 	In an ordered system how can votes so magically appear in such numbers?
@foxandfriends Flake by name.	Flake by nature.		The only thing he seems likely to run from is his shadow.	Lucky he is not dyslexic.
@Primetv_NZ 	How do I install Prime TV on my HP Laptop please?	I use MSN as a browser and it advises against putting Chrome on, and I can not risk laptop.
@magnettothesea 	Love you Stephanie.	I am sorry for the loss of Tom, that just must have been and remains, an unquenchable empty pain.		Further, I offer my sincerest albeit belated condolences for the loss of both Howard, and Glen Frey.		You are always loved and missed sweetie.	X
@XHNews I wonder which USA/UK Aero Development Program the Chinese military stole that concept from.	Beijing	Do not worry, Ft. Meade will have an appropriate b/door built in to whatever you have misappropriated.
@realDonaldTrump 	Mr President Donald Trump	Do you know the above fits exactly on smart phone line.	Similarly, you fit in the Office you now hold, you wear it well.	Mr Acosta, and The Press need realize, WH Brady Rm is courtesy extended by you.	WH your House.	Press need manners.
@realDonaldTrump Mr President,	My Family lost 3 at Sommes (Knox), GrandFathers lived.	It is great you there, u should try to meet QE2 in England, straight after.	Your Presidency post midterms is developing real gravitas.	Vote showed USA with you.	Her Majesty will see you immediately, do it.	GB.
@Sarit55737507 @liyaomer Fancy finding you on a site promoting the virtues &amp; activities of the woman I most admire &amp; have loved all my adult life.		If Stephanie reviews this, know October 3, 2017 was very sad day, last time with you + Tom &amp; Mickey Heyes.		Only you, Mickey &amp; I know where, love. x
@magnettothesea 	How are you?
@Sarit55737507 @liyaomer Thank you Sarita, please excuse my ignorance, I had been up all night, but can have no excuse.		Boy, big mistake, sorry.
FOX NEWS - Mr Hannity		Rick Scott still Governor?		Needs fast help, ask POTUS use Constitutional Power:	1. Gov. Scott orders National Guard/FBI seize records.	2. POTUS asks SC to order urgent 3rd party vote count.		Request made based on:	3. National Security.	4. Public interest.
@MaryMister8 	Thank you Mary.		So many times America gets hammered for the mistakes, actions, prejudices, and vagueries of other countries.		The Middle East has been a thorn in the peace of the world for thousands of years.		To suggest USA responsible is just stupid.		God Bless
FOX NEWS	Sean Hannity		OXYMORON - Schiff.		Ranking Member of The House Intelligence Committee, says it all really.		Congressional Democrats are without doubt worst pack of losers ever seen in USA Politics.		On basis of what said, I believe DT may close Congress &amp; Order them home.
@RudyGiuliani @emmafardafi Mr Giuliano,	Does President Trump have right to ask Supreme Court under urgency to intervene?		Also, I never had chance to thank you directly for what you did for NY &amp; USA after 9/11.		I lost English girl I loved,	never married, nor will, you &amp; GWB were USA offensive dream team.
@JennyLynnO1 I have to ask.	You are not the Jane Tarzan was with, swinging through the jungle, when he let out the loudest yell:	"wrong vine, Jane"
@mbohannon9 	Hey Mike,	Did you like my little ditty?
@JennyLynnO1 You have a sensational smile, your husband is a very lucky man.		Do not work too hard, and please tweet me on anything.
@realDonaldTrump Trump on Scott Florida	Yes they did, but they also voted for Governor Scott's:	1. Ability to work with others to get things done.	2. His proven interpersonal relationship with you, and how you both get things done 	Sen. Nelson ex-NASA time has moved on.		Good luck.
@MissyElliott @mattybum25 Missy Elliott,	Yours is a tweet I can really understand.	In past month I have lost to old age a favoured Uncle and my favourite Aunt.	Yet for all my pain, not to compare, but how do you deal with, or minimize, that someone you saw yesterday you will not ever see again.	A tragedy.
@AltUSPressSec @Cpn8167 @brithume On the day of another shooting tragedy, do you think you could do away with the mindless accusatory conspiracy theories.		Get some manners, have respect for those who have passed away, grow up, and cool it!
@avachat110		Fortunately she has to, that is why the individual signing they will abide by The Constitution, is so critical.		Been around since 1960's I	think, but is mandatory.		Therefore no excuse.
@lauracox1959 	Thanks Laura.	You are absolutely right
@theruballos 	Thanks for your tweet.
@liyaomer @Sarit55737507 I do not read Arabic, you must have known that when you tweeted, so why do it.		With respect, at a time when some disciples of Islam seek to preach generosity of spirit, why are there ones like you trying it on.		Do not use my screen for your messaging.		Islam still not in clear.
@echothump @wendypeavy @trngchief11 @dcexaminer @michellemalkin Good stuff, thank you!
@politico @morgfair Critical to evaluating Donald Trump's tax returns.	1. Has done nothing wrong.	2. He has been examined by IRS before.	3. That due to use of bankruptcy provisions to protect business.	4. He repaid all debt, many do not.	He &amp; team know tax so well this why he made changes quickly.
@donnynogood @NeilFinn Excluding one man, the best.
@legendaryhour @HodgsonMikey @NeilFinn There are words I could say to you, I won't.		Fleetwood Mac members in early 70's, nothing to prove.		Mike &amp; Neil 1st class musos and as Lindsay took mantle from Peter Green, this is new version.		1. Mike been in loop far longer than Vito &amp; Burnett.		2. I love Lindsay's playing.
@NeilFinn How is the mix and productivity with your new bandmates working?		Have been hearing quite a lot of yours and your son's music lately, although you have heard it before, your tunefulness is really very good, nice cadence, great sound.	Did you mix latest work at home?
@JennyLynnO1 	Finger reference was because you claimed to be so snowed under.	So I sarcastically tried to paint picture of you typing feverishly, wearing a finger out like shoe leather.	That will teach me.
@paulbrislen 	Thanks Mr Technology.		Merry Christmas to you and your Family.
@paulbrislen Convict and fine him.		While you're there, get that smarty pants reindeer Rudolph as well.		I mean really, who would call their reindeer Rudolph, it is almost as bad as calling some others Donna and Blitzen. 		But hey, what's in a name.		No stocking for you this year.
@MsAvaArmstrong @shadesome No you are not.		And I believe President Trump &amp; President Putin are in regular contact, as I would hope they would be.		To maintain the order we have which prevents a global conflict from accidently happening.
@RealJamesWoods @JudyMoo64479187 @realDonaldTrump Does he need a whip, and spurs as well?
@ArianaGrande Miss Grande,		Today given 1000 Oaks, that message in that tweet, is the most appropriate I have seen.	God Bless you both
@prewcrew 	Hi Kathy,	The wall has to be completed.		Thank you for your tweet
@KimberlyMcLach1 	Thank you again Kimberley.
@trngchief11 I will look at that.	1989-1990 I reviewed NZ's lgst health provider, Akld Area Health Bd, for NZ PM		Pres. Clinton asked Hillary 2 help. I read up on MediCare, MedicAid, sent 200 pages to her on fixing system.	I could see then clearly too costly in future 4 Fed, States, patients.
@Sherry40614670 Sherry,	I was working this unfolded in front of me.		I have several friends in that area, I pray all &amp; kin are safe.		This behaviour far too often.		I know 2nd Amendment must be maintained for USA security, but I do not see a nutter being a "well regulated militia"		God Bless.
@trngchief11 	Ken,	As I said to the person who co-tweeted us, that may have been an error, Healthcare is such a massive issue, taking quick action absent research can be fraught with problems.	A rebate may be needed.
@KimberlyMcLach1 	And Kimberley	You survived breast cancer.	That is just brilliant.	Very well done.
@KimberlyMcLach1 	Thank you Kimberley.		Love your tag.		Young at heart, almost 50.		I am past that, but if I had a smile as good as yours I would feel young every day.		I hop up in the morning, and the mirror says to me:	"Oh no,,,not you again"		God Bless, keep in touch.
@bbcregular 	JoAnn,	Thank you.	You are a Mother.	Far be it from me to even pretend to understand what the Mother's and Father's of the 1000 Oaks Shootings are going through.	God Bless, and God Bless the United States of America.
@Sherry40614670 	Hi Sherry,	Thank you for your tweet.
@echothump @wendypeavy @trngchief11 @dcexaminer @michellemalkin To that comment you may well be right.	That bears much closer examination, and it may well be there is a case for USA Government providing a future care rebate equal to that loss, as opposed to a compensatory payment.		Listen so many tweets is not sane, calm down.
