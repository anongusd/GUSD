@The_Trump_Train @realDonaldTrump This is an embarrassment to our Country and to the world that watches....this from the President of the United States...shameful
@MikePenceVP @realDonaldTrump Yes because you wouldn’t have a job working for a dishonest President
@realDonaldTrump When you stop trying to avoid the truth.....you are a contributor to the issues with Russia. There is no way you can walk away a state you have “clean hands”!
@realDonaldTrump You are trying to lean the investigation by tweeting about Muller and suggesting he has somehow been inappropriate in his investigations. He is close and you know it!
@realDonaldTrump Nothing important to tweet so you tweet some bogus crap. You are doing damage to our Judical System...somehow you think you are better than every president before you...simply fake news
Please re-tweet it will help raise funds for the firefighters. Thank you Aaron, as a Couch I remember you playing some baseball in Ukiah / Rewood Valley....proud of you in so many ways! https://t.co/mDiTaQXBq0
@marcorubio Just depends on what side of the fence you stand on. If you were a Democrat you would have 10 reasons why Republicans are wrong......so tired of the “fake” elected officials
@realDonaldTrump That is not true I have been watching over the course of this past week and the media has been reporting how close the races were and once there were concessions reports went out as the the party that prevailed....you are providing fake information!
@realDonaldTrump You don’t need a wall.....you need good policy and procedure along with additional hiring of Boarder Patrol Agents with stations built in various areas along the Boarder..and a bunch of agents that can operate drones with night vision that can spot people trying to cross broader
@realDonaldTrump Do you need more attention Mr. Trump
@realDonaldTrump You are doing a great disservice to our Country by claiming a conspiracy theory about the News. You are causing harm to the integrity of our nation and the Constitution. We are a political version of your “your fired” program.
@realDonaldTrump It would be very good if you stopped being Rude and doing and saying anything about Americans that just happen to be Democrats. It seems that some American people take the way you act as a permission to be really stupid and in some cases very harmful. Please Be Presidential.
