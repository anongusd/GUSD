@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon See my later message. I agree that this policy isn‚Äôt good, but instead of making it another argument against the apparent immorality of wealth inequality (which is exactly the point she is trying to make), just don‚Äôt allow people to hold spots.
@kzap333 @CLK55 @AOC @Wimbledon You‚Äôre claiming that this isn‚Äôt an argument of morality, and yet the language used throughout this thread regarding fairness and money is inherently a moral argument. Again we‚Äôre not going to agree.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon However, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs immoral as people can queue, entrance to the event is free, and people are voluntarily holding a single place in line in return for payment. If people are basing immorality on the money element, then just demand that people cannot hold spaces.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon It‚Äôs pretty clear we‚Äôre not going to agree. I just think we need to have a more specific definition of immorality, and not just believe that everything we might not like as inherently immoral. I‚Äôm not a fan of that practice either, and have never claimed to be an advocate.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon I‚Äôve never stepped off topic. My issue throughout is the assumption of immorality based on something being viewed as bad behavior. The difference is that seats are presumably free, so it‚Äôs first come first serve. If people want to go, they can queue. Tickets require a fee.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon 3) now, if homeless people can make money holding a single place; why is this bad IF there is nothing stopping anyone else from also waiting in line? This is an absurd accusation of immorality.
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon 2) loving the use of Wimbledon as an example by the way. Certainly an excellent example of fair, accessible and affordable sporting events...
@CLK55 @kzap333 @AOC @Wimbledon 1) You‚Äôre synonymizing holding someone‚Äôs place in line with allowing them to join with the person waiting. If there‚Äôs nothing physically stopping people from queuing, and the person swaps out so no places behind them are replaced, it‚Äôs not the same as cutting in line.

@LahavHarkov It‚Äôs just playing the intersectional game on level 10. It‚Äôs disgusting that candidates who ran in part on the fact they provided diversity to Congress are using that diversity as a shield against legitimate criticism of bigotry.

@RubinReport Not even subtle anymore.
@Rossputin @IlhanMN This is just a slightly more wordy ‚Äúsorry not sorry‚Äù.
@NuanceBro @RubinReport In all honesty, I‚Äôd have to look into Ron Paul more deeply as I have quite patchy knowledge of his history, and don‚Äôt feel comfortable to jump to yes/no on anti-semitism. Is he an example, for you, of misassigned antisemitism by @RubinReport?
@NuanceBro @RubinReport 2) at worst, yes from my limited knowledge of him, his words and actions could definitely be defined as anti-Semitic in the same way that many on the Left are.
@NuanceBro @RubinReport 1) In the context of the cartoon, if it was his staffer who tweeted it, one must assume they‚Äôve been fired. If it was him, it was either anti-Semitic (as well as racist) or stupid, or both. On a general level, he‚Äôs at best heavily involved with anti-semites.
@NuanceBro @RubinReport Regarding that cartoon he posted and deleted?
@morganisawizard @NotEricWagner We need more clarification regarding what ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù means. Is it ‚Äúmust be vaccinated to attend public school‚Äù? Or is it ‚Äúwill be forced to vaccinate‚Äù? This is crucial context. Regardless, I fail to see how this is in any way related to being or not being pro-life...

@Ostrov_A @SpeakerPelosi @TheDemocrats @IlhanMN I‚Äôm gonna guess no.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom So you‚Äôre not answering my answer to your concern. Endless deflection from the issue of whether BDS applies a double standard and whether the one-state solution is bigoted. You‚Äôre not worth my time.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Then I hope they‚Äôll be advocating for the same from Egypt and Jordan, if they‚Äôre not focused on a double standard for Jews? It‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre not listening to what I‚Äôm saying, and just focussed on deflecting from my concern of consistency of criticism. Not worth my time.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom You‚Äôre not reading what I‚Äôm saying. I agree with you that not all criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic. But if the only criticism is of the one Jewish state, and worse countries are never mentioned, that‚Äôs concerning no?
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I didn‚Äôt say support Palestine over Israel. I said openly support BDS and one-state solution. A one-state solution, implemented by a state that cries ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù, and by Hamas‚Äô charter which calls for the murder of Jews, won‚Äôt cause death?
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Interesting that there is no such boycott or protest against Egypt or Jordan for persecution. Just a thought.
@Ataur005 @Ehmashoes @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom If you noticed, I stated that BDS is bigoted. You‚Äôre not defending that, just trying to deflect by forcing me to argue that Zionism isn‚Äôt bigoted. Not going to waste my time on an argument I wasn‚Äôt even posing because you can‚Äôt defend BDS.
@CJEriksen @ewarren I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a huge difference. Individual policies often go hand-in-hand with popular sentiments if they‚Äôre of certain topics. For example, welfare state + taxes + class warfare against the wealthy.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I don‚Äôt know what your personal views are on the matter, but for characters like Omar and Tlaib to openly and consistently criticize Israel while advocating for BDS (which is based on bigoted lies) and the one-state solution (which would result in genocide) is not reasonable.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre honest enough to see that. But before I waste time on this, are you going to reject any borderline-AS things Ilhan Omar has done, or just flower behind the ‚ÄúIsrael isn‚Äôt Judaism‚Äù argument? Because if it‚Äôs the latter, no ‚Äúevidence‚Äù will change your mind anyway.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Maybe because the boycott is based on bigotry alone?
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom I agree that Israel doesn‚Äôt ALWAYS equal Judaism. But at the same time, anti-Israel or anti-Zionism is not mutually exclusive from anti-semitism. If applied inconsistently, for example, against Israel and no other countries, then it‚Äôs targeting the one Jewish state.
@ewarren Celebrating populism...awesome...
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom And if this one tweet was made, I‚Äôd be less inclined to jump to ‚Äúanti-semitism‚Äù. But it‚Äôs not the first, and it won‚Äôt be the last.
@Ehmashoes @Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Which would be fine if #IlhamOmar consistently made the same comments regarding other PACs. But she doesn‚Äôt. She‚Äôs consistently targeting Israel.
To be fair, I can‚Äôt help but giggle every time say ‚ÄúHezbollah‚Äù...what‚Äôs hilarious is she opens by talking about sound bites out of context...and then laughs about Hezbollah... https://t.co/3ZBb7BdAcv
@Ataur005 @Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN @haaretzcom Yes I realize that. It‚Äôs a joke how a comment that could have been about Israel was actually just another standard anti-Semitic trope about Jewish conspiracies and money-based power
@TheRealDSuggs Despicable.
@Ostrov_A @shaunking @IlhanMN It‚Äôs all about those Benjamins. She was talking about Netanyahu, right? Right? No? Oh...
@sjs856 @breakfastclubam @HowardU Thanks for talking about it though, I found it interesting even if we don‚Äôt agree.
@sjs856 @breakfastclubam @HowardU However, for me, I find it hard to take her seriously as the ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù icon she‚Äôs claiming to be when her history is mixed at best along these lines. The primaries will be interesting when she‚Äôs tested on those lines for sure.
@sjs856 @breakfastclubam @HowardU 1) Does appealing the ruling re: the death penalty fall under that? There are multiple issues with her past as DA/AG that are far from progressive, but I understand if you base that on things you care about.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 3) but it‚Äôs also clear that the ability to check for contagious diseases should be part of any immigration control system, and so the influx of any illegal immigrants carries the obvious risk of preventable diseases that are prevelant elsewhere. This also holds for travel.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 2) and regarding immigration, I think it‚Äôs both difficult data to get hold of, and also not the entire problem by a long shot. I think we should be careful to focus on the issue of reduced vaccination rates, rather than just laying the blame squarely at the feet of immigration.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 1) I‚Äôd like to look into how many parents abstain from vaccination and don‚Äôt send their children to public school for related or unrelated reasons.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 2) ...to then argue about conservatism. If it was to stop children from attending public school, I have zero problem with this. If people are thrown in jail, then I agree more with your reasoning. So I guess we need more specificity regarding the bill and enforcement/outcomes.
@KayFellowz @FDRLST 1) I think it‚Äôs an interesting argument, but one that is trying to use basic conservatism as a loop hole as opposed to logical reasoning. The bill‚Äôs goal was to disallow non-vaccination for ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù reasons. I‚Äôd like to see more info regarding the outcome of this...
@KayFellowz I wrote an article about precisely this for the @FDRLST. You can choose not to vaccinate, but you should isolate yourself from those you would put in harms way. Every choice has consequences. https://t.co/pkZSDB8cHU
@KayFellowz @ChuckEChaves If you choose not to vaccinate, then you should isolate yourself from society. It is not your right to choose not to protect yourself and others and then willingly put yourself and others at risk without their consent. You can have either, but not both.
Omg no way. #shutdown2.0  https://t.co/uBqHwbuBA0
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU So that‚Äôs not really answering my question, it‚Äôs just providing a promise of legitimacy which means nothing to someone who has a difference of opinion. Not sure we‚Äôre going to get anywhere here, but I appreciate the conversation.
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU And so it becomes an issue of how many ‚Äúnon-progressive‚Äù things are needed to no longer be non-progressive? Seems highly subjective. If someone does one anti-Semitic thing, for example, and lots of non anti-Semitic things, are they anti-Semitic? How about two/three/four?
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU And again, Back on Track isn‚Äôt fully positive (i.e. had some significant criticisms regarding illegal immigration) while being objectively positive in general. But there are instances of her career that are thoroughly non-progressive
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU What are your thoughts on the number of people who are disagreeing that she is the progressive she suddenly claims to be? Such as the argument posed here: https://t.co/1Q4d9l5I2Z not looking for a ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù, but I am genuinely tired of politicians reinventing themselves as needed
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU While it‚Äôs almost certain she did a lot of good if she was a prosecutor, there is a lot of evidence that she‚Äôs not the progressive prosecutor she is now claiming to have been.
@sjs856 @KamalaHarris @breakfastclubam @HowardU Then I guess all of the conflicting ‚Äúinformation‚Äù isn‚Äôt free?

@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel So, overall 1) cut out emotion, 2) focus on the key argument, 3) use their set of core beliefs about the value of a human
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel The key part is to play by the logical rules of the person you want to influence, and not by your set of assumptions. It‚Äôs like trying to convince an atheist that god exists by citing the Bible, when they don‚Äôt believe that the Bible is of any historical value
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel So then I focus on the key point of disagreement, which is whether unborn life is life, and whether that life is morally human. Since we can all agree that killing a human life is wrong, that leaves us with the single task of deciding when life begins
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel The main tactic I use (which has been successful in at least starting a dialogue) is approaching it with no emotional arguments. Abortion is so naturally emotional that it often means that logical arguments are lost very quickly
@RoseLaoutaris Telling someone to be an adult and only have a few drinks before driving is the most childish argument
RT @jaketapper: Mattis farewell message: ‚ÄúOur Department is proven to be at its best when the times are most difficult. So keep the faith i‚Ä¶
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel If we got rid of all of the emotional arguments that distract from this core point, I think the pro-life movement would be more successful
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel Except you‚Äôd then have to make the argument that the parasite is of same moral value as a human, which comes down the the same core argument that we get to every time. Is an unborn baby/fetus/embryo a human.
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel Like yours if someone calls a baby a parasite, for example
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel The issue with the abortion debate is it‚Äôs trying to STOP something, and so the debate will always change and reasons to keep it will evolve, so it‚Äôs the responsibility of the pro-life movement to approach each new reason with logical and objective arguments
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel You started by saying that those who deny that abortion is murder are like flat-earthers. That‚Äôs unlikely to open a dialogue with anyone who may change their mind, even if it‚Äôs one person, and that one person decides against having an abortion, if it is murder, isn‚Äôt it worth it?
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel Ok, then what‚Äôs the gameplan? Yes, many can‚Äôt defend their position, because it‚Äôs often based on flawed logic. Yes, many refuse to hear other opinions. But some may be willing, and so if abortion is worth fighting against, then it‚Äôs worth using persuasive tactics.
@sinreligious @ZeldaAGabriel It‚Äôs certainly a good response to the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a parasite‚Äù logic!

@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel You might be right, but the issue is that calling someone ignorant is usually an unsuccessful way of getting them to change their mind...
@Sara_Rose_G Is neither an option?
@ZeldaAGabriel I would much rather focus on the core principle of when life begins rather than calling abortion a Holocaust, for instance, since (as a general society) we already believe murder is wrong, and so the key step is believing that unborn life is life
@ZeldaAGabriel I think we both agree in that case. I‚Äôm fine with using both, but just talking about the dehumanizing aspect is divisive, and regardless of whether it‚Äôs true, is more likely to deter people who might otherwise change their minds about abortion
@ZeldaAGabriel Again, this is ignoring my entire point. If I agree with you, then it‚Äôs a waste of time because we both agree. If I disagree with you, then you‚Äôre doing nothing to change my mind except for purely emotional arguments based on the belief that others may not hold
@ZeldaAGabriel But if they are or aren‚Äôt, these statements are meaningless through the eyes of someone who disagrees - which is my point. If someone doesn‚Äôt think unborn life is life, the objective is to persuade them that it is life, not just call abortion murder or slavery.
@ZeldaAGabriel And so while your comment regarding the comparison is understandable, it won‚Äôt change anyone‚Äôs mind who disagrees with you.
@ZeldaAGabriel Not at all. I made the point that instead of two sides shouting ‚Äúit‚Äôs murder‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs a choice‚Äù, those who are pro-life need to focus on why unborn life constitutes life. That should be the repeated focus as it‚Äôs the point of core disagreement.
@ZeldaAGabriel Read what I‚Äôve said without your quick assumption that I‚Äôm simply a pro-choicer, and see it from a different perspective
@ZeldaAGabriel You‚Äôre really not reading what I‚Äôm writing, and assuming that I‚Äôm pro-choice. My point is that you need to engage with those who disagree by focusing on why their core assumptions are wrong, instead of saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù, IF you want change
@rs_love123 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn‚Äôt agree with the comparison.
@steve_stout_ @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn‚Äôt agree with the comparison.
@steve_stout_ @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel I think there are reasons regarding personal responsibility, and then whether or not it should be funded with public money
@JasonHa63444912 @LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn‚Äôt agree with the comparison.
@ZeldaAGabriel @LiveAction My point is that if pro-life groups want to change minds, then they have to focus on the point of difference, and persuade those who disagree that unborn life is life. Just comparing it to murder or slavery is meaningless if the person doesn‚Äôt agree with the comparison.
@LiveAction @ZeldaAGabriel This is only true if one‚Äôs reason for ‚Äúhating‚Äù abortion is the belief that abortion is murder. In that case, this argument holds. If not, then it‚Äôs not equivalent to the other examples, because they‚Äôre all based on the premise of life. We must be specific and honest.

Only those attempting to apologise for the far right argue otherwise‚Äù, because it‚Äôs fine to debate their place on a spectrum, but to label me as an apologist is absurd and incorrect
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Which I do reject on the basis of being Jewish. While you‚Äôre right that there are a small number of far-right Israeli political groups, they are also based on ethno-nationalism, and the vast majority of European far-right parties are deeply AS
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G And then for some reason that got categorized as Nazi/far-right apologists
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G I apologize, I misread your last sentence. My point regarding the Nazis was that, while they have some far-right traits when it comes to ethno-nationalism, they also have far-left traits such as state-level control of industry and means of production. So it‚Äôs not a simple as L/R
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G And that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôve tried to so, so your comment is irrelevant.
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Again, you‚Äôre just accusing me of being far-right with ZERO evidence. üëã
@pavel_itoje @Sara_Rose_G Indeed, Hitler himself denied that the Nazis were Left or Right. They don‚Äôt fit into this convenient spectrum which allow people to bash anyone with vaguely conservative viewpoints

@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy Not worth any more of my time. Please try and question the unshakeable support of Tommy Robinson. It‚Äôs obviously a good thing to try and combat these awful crimes, but that doesn‚Äôt justify blind support of someone of his character, history, or temperament.
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy Two things can be true at once, and that‚Äôs the point you don‚Äôt understand. I can want these atrocities to end, as I hope the majority of people do, AND think Tommy is not the man to lead this fight. You only understand binary arguments it seems
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy Do you perhaps think that I‚Äôm trying to make a difference by pointing out that Tommy is not the hero he‚Äôs held up to be, and not a conservative thought leader? Or are the only acceptable actions mimicking Tommy by screaming bigoted rhetoric in the street or breaking the law?
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy üòÇ you‚Äôre hilariously illogical. The police are the ones who handle this, and they clearly are given that he was outside an ongoing trial. I, on the other hand, am NOT on trial, and you won‚Äôt bully me or deflect from the original comments made.

@jme2020 Spurious? He went to jail for all of these things...
@Johnwadey @BBCNews Fair treatment for everyone means rights to a fair trial, too. If he wants to expose, then focus on exposing the unexposed, not jumping onto an existing court case and trying to get thrown in jail to act as a martyr.
@ganais_anais They‚Äôre ignoring it SO much that the alleged rapists were exposed OUTSIDE THEIR TRIAL. You can‚Äôt expose someone who is already charged and in court.
@DAN0C0NN0R @adamhamdy He wants to use obviously emotional and dreadful crimes to further his own narrative and political ambitions. He‚Äôs not exposing people if they‚Äôre already charged and facing trial. He‚Äôs just jeopardizing the trials, and therefore the chance of justice for actual victims.

@korlando2251 @BridgetPhetasy Agree. I think that while some of what some Dems have been doing (accusations of sexual assault with no evidence) can be defined as evil, it‚Äôs wrong to label the entire ideology as evil or satanic. It‚Äôs also unproductive if we want to repair division.
@TomiLahren The value of protest is linked directly with the reality of what is being protested.
@DVATW I disagree wholeheartedly. The #MeToo movement has been abused and hijacked, but to label the movement like this is appalling.
@BridgetPhetasy Absolutely. I‚Äôm certainly not one to assume the moral high ground for any politicians! But I think it‚Äôs been very much the Dem talking point of recent times to beat all opposing arguments down with accusations of immorality, rather than addressing points of disagreement
@BridgetPhetasy I think the key issue is that many Democrats claim complete ownership of morality, meaning that anyone who disagrees with them is inherently immoral as a result
@BridgetPhetasy The self-censoring is another weapon of the more radical Left. Bully those into ultimately being afraid of voicing reasonable, rational opinions.

@OkeyMor57 @Slate If this only applied to homosexual couples, it would clearly be discriminatory. However, it doesn‚Äôt, and so the headline is very misleading. The basic rule is now ‚Äúno visas for non-married partner if you are able to be legally married in your country of origin‚Äù
@OkeyMor57 @Slate I‚Äôm saying that this article is implying it‚Äôs discrimination based on sexual orientation, which it is not. If you are from a country that allows gay marriage, you must be married to get a visa. For homo-/hetero-sexual couples alike, they can only get visas if married (if legal)
@Slate This is false. They‚Äôre denying all non-married partners for heterosexual and homosexual couples. If you are married; you can get a visa. If you are from a country which does not allow gay marriage; you can get a visa.
@kayleighmcenany @SenBooker Got to admire his honesty that it doesn‚Äôt matter to the Dems whether he‚Äôs innocent or not...in a way...hmm maybe not.
@xan_desanctis Woah. üôÑ I wonder what the acceptable length of the investigation could be? I think there‚Äôs a relevant day in November, right?
@SenGillibrand A country that values due process and evidence with accusations would also be nice. There‚Äôs a big jump between ‚Äúlistening‚Äù - i.e. taking accusations seriously - and believing. You have to have evidence to pronounce guilt of the accused.

@RitaPanahi It still means there are 6096 idiots out there unfortunately
@robtr2 @TikiMaximus @washingtonpost It‚Äôs also logically misleading. You can get in bar fights without drinking to excess. Every attempt to link drinking with Kavanaugh lying and that he must therefore be a rapist is just clutching at straws with no real evidence to rely on.

@KellyAngard @LouiseMensch @DarcieChan @thespybrief @realDonaldTrump Yes. If proven, perjury should be treated as a crime, which it is. Generally I‚Äôm in favor of enforcing any laws on the books, but hey.
@KellyAngard @LouiseMensch @DarcieChan @thespybrief @realDonaldTrump I do think there‚Äôs a legitimate problem in partisan politics where you condemn/condone based on personal bias, so this is a fair comment. However, I‚Äôve also become pretty cynical, since if we actually enforced the punishment of perjury, most politicians would be in jail.

@gal_feisty @SenGillibrand I agree, an investigation is reasonable. But the dems could have asked for an investigation when the accusations were made. Delaying it seems like justice isn‚Äôt their primary concern, no?

@KamalaHarris Calling on the accused to call for themselves to be investigated is absurd, and you know it. If you want the investigation, press charges. Otherwise, stop grandstanding for 2020.
If we sit and permit someone to be bullied into asking for an investigation into themselves, something no-one is required to do, we‚Äôve lost something significant.

@Slate This is fundamentally false reporting. He denied having sex while at High School, but did admit to drinking, but not to excess and that he could remember his actions. These headlines are blasted out so you can then label him as a liar. Despicable.

@LouiseMensch "Kavanaugh's (and the SC's) every decision &amp; good name will be forever tainted". This is the Dem's political back-up plan. If he's proven guilty, then he is (quite rightly) disqualified. If not because of lack of evidence, they can demean every decision he makes.
@RealMarkKennedy Please, that was SO last news cycle.
#Haircut pro-tip: When asked "How long would you like your sideburns?", do not reply "Please could you trim them where they start getting thin?". This is an arrogant assumption of hair symmetry that can backfire.

@ellencarmichael @johnhawkinsrwn These kind of reports, which are aimed at discrediting the accuser, are irrelevant. What is relevant is the evidence, or lack thereof. That‚Äôs enough. That should be the focus.

@Slate The fact is that this is occurring, as we all know, during a high-level federal proceeding, and so it‚Äôs natural and logical to have deadlines, otherwise this could (and would) be dragged out for months, for both legitimate and illegitimate reasons.

@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein And I feel we‚Äôve come full circle, I‚Äôve addressed all of this in the article.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein See part 2! üòÇ
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein 2) and I‚Äôd be a little more willing to accept the usage of ‚Äúholocaust‚Äù if the context of its usage wasn‚Äôt genocide-related or ‚ÄúThe Holocaust‚Äù, which unfortunately is how it‚Äôs used in a lot of cases.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein 1) Ah sorry I didn‚Äôt realize it was specific to Holocaust. In that case, I think the word has enough modern connection with ‚ÄúThe Holocaust‚Äù that it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that when it‚Äôs used, it‚Äôs referring to the event and not the original definition.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I think it is, regardless of opinions held. An extreme example of this: there is a debate regarding whether the world is flat or round, despite most believe it is clearly round. However, saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no debate‚Äù isn‚Äôt a way of proving a flat-worlder wrong in a logical way.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I agree that ‚Äúmost‚Äù is an exaggeration, but by most I meant it‚Äôs possible to make an argument for most, not that most are, if that makes sense. Again, I think the dehumanization argument is a logically sound argument, but again  that doesn‚Äôt mean genocide.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein And here‚Äôs the problem. I wasn‚Äôt entering a pro-life/pro-choice debate. None of the article included an opinion on abortion. Just questioning the logic and effectiveness of using such language to advocate for pro-life views.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein ‚ÄúMost‚Äù and ‚Äúcan be‚Äù are he important parts in my sentence. Punching someone can be seen as an act of assumed superiority. And yes, the word was used before. But so were many words that now have inflammatory meanings, and doesn‚Äôt counter the article‚Äôs argument.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein Then this works both ways, it‚Äôs possible for pro-lifers to criticize abortion in isolation without having to compare to genocide or The Holocaust. It‚Äôs really the logical leap to that comparison that I have a problem with, not general pro/anti abortion opinions.
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein But there is a real widespread medical debate regarding what constitutes life, while there is no legitimate medical debate regarding standards within post-birth humans.	Again, I understand the arguments, but it‚Äôs too large a leap to jump to genocide.
@JodiKoberinski @MarkDice Well then Bailey‚Äôs seems much more appropriate!
@merlinspants07 @autumnhklein I can understand that viewpoint, but I still think it‚Äôs too large a leap from that to ‚ÄúThe Holocaust‚Äù or ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù. Really most physical crimes against a person can be defined as dehumanizing or assertion of superiority.
@SenGillibrand The FBI make the decision whether they should investigate or not, and since the accusations are not a federal crime, they are not obligated to investigate, so implying that this is tantamount to silencing Dr. Ford is incorrect, regardless of whether her accusations are true.

@HashCigarette @sherpayy @benshapiro Firstly, the ‚Äúhow‚Äù is the immoral part. Secondly, I think it‚Äôs not a full gone conclusion that those are good things.

@cam_wallaceee Why?
@MacKurva @SenFeinstein I disagree there. There shouldn‚Äôt be a statue of limitations for reporting the assault. However, there is no reason for Feinstein to withhold the information except for political. There‚Äôs a difference. Feinstein is not an alleged victim.
@NuncVideo @KassyDillon Well how kind of you to take over both the meaning of the photos she chooses to post and her future! Even if your trolling, this is just silly.
@NuncVideo I‚Äôm not going to try and speak for @KassyDillon obviously, but her photo is clearly to counter the view that ARs shouldn‚Äôt be sold, not as a dating photo...?
@BrianTubbs @AsheSchow The word ‚Äúbelieve‚Äù is subjective, but important in cases of accusations of sexual assault. It seems like research shows that not being believed is a barrier to many reporting their attack, so the language used is important. You can believe the accusation and then investigate.
@KayFellowz Agreed. The abuse of the movement by those who should be its biggest advocates is in no way representative of the movement itself.
@JamalDajani @meirohana1 Do you have links to examples of a Palestinian civilian being stabbed to death by an Israeli civilian and being portrayed by Israeli media as a militant? Just curious.
@KassyDillon His later claim is that if the roles were reversed (i.e. it was a Palestinian ‚Äúmilitant‚Äù that was killed), the militancy would have been reported. W...t...f nothing like casual justification of murder of a civilian
@SenFeinstein We shouldn‚Äôt dispute the accusations and should look into this legally, as we should with all such accusations. However, maybe if you‚Äôd shared the information you had in July they‚Äôd have more time? Oh wait...
@Jim252525 @BrianTubbs @AsheSchow What‚Äôs a pro-deather?
@BrianTubbs @AsheSchow Huh? Believe the accuser means not dismissing their accusation and following legal procedures of investigation...none of that impacts the presumption of innocence.
@glitterelf @Tranny_Bane @cam_wallaceee We need to acknowledge that it‚Äôs possible to believe the accuser and follow procedure AND question Feinstein‚Äôs motives and choice of timing.
@TomiLahren What people aren‚Äôt considering is that both can be true. The accusations can be true, but Feinstein‚Äôs timing can be political.
@RAMRANTS @AsheSchow The key point is that there will be a large enough group of people who think lie detector tests are legally admissible because they‚Äôre used in CSI or SVU.
@AinsleyBBrown I agree. It‚Äôs bad regardless of what element of history is being removed.
@AsheSchow I think the lines are being blurred here. We should be able to follow legal process and believe the accuser and address evidence, while also questioning Feinstein‚Äôs choice to withhold accusations for political reasons.
@diva3102 @ElishaKrauss For Feinstein to delay the accusations for any amount of time opens legitimate questions about her political tactics. This can be true while also believing the alleged victim and investigating. The speed of the process is not relevant when evidence is withheld for such crimes.
@benshapiro Exactly. It‚Äôs possible to both believe the accusations while waiting for evidence AND question Feinstein‚Äôs timing and motives for concealing such an accusation.
@benshapiro Which is exactly what both sides need to do. Evidence is what matters. When people start to make excuses based on his age at the time of the alleged assault, it implies guilt. We should also be able to listen to the accuser while also questioning Feinstein‚Äôs choice of timing.
@autumnhklein It‚Äôs bad that rather than discussing the evidence, people are trying to undercut it by unethically excusing the behavior...

@ElishaKrauss What‚Äôs disappointing here is the timing. If the accusations are true (and I think we need to remain ethical and believe all accusations with evidence) then Feinstein‚Äôs delay in releasing the information is troubling. If the accusations are false, then it damages #MeToo.

@Bohomoni1948 @JudeanPF @lakecountydem @therealeffzee @mattduss @robertwrighter The majority of the land was actually owned by absentee landlords who rented the land, who sold the land when Israel was formed...but yeah theft and squatting.
@mattduss And Obama‚Äôs administration was significantly more anti-Israel than others have been...so unless the entirety of that extra $100 billion you mentioned was given between 2008 and 2016, not sure how that‚Äôs relevant to the original point.

@DevinSenaUI Are you talking about the same woman? Because if so, I‚Äôm sure there are some who have their children put up for adoption that regret it. If not, then it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare their feelings of regret as they‚Äôre too different people in two different situations...

@morganisawizard That sounds a bit capitalistic to me...
@Ocasio2018 It is real, but a 35-year anecdotal timespan is hardly enough to make a judgement on whether the cause of this much activity is because of climate change.
@JackRodriguez4 They are aware of this. However, enough people will watch this video, hear the phrase ‚Äúabortion-inducing drugs‚Äù, and believe everything, regardless of the fact that saying what someone else said isn‚Äôt the same as thinking it. Very scary
@jstoner627 @CoryBooker Regardless of political tactics, ‚Äúconfidential last night‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúconfidential today‚Äù, so my question still stands. I‚Äôm glad that, if true, the GOP work that late! Excellent work ethic.
@girlsreallyrule @JackRodriguez4 @HillaryClinton It‚Äôs truly worrying that people can listen to these words, with the abortion-inducing portion being immediately preceded by ‚Äúthey said‚Äù, and come away thinking that Kavanaugh THINKS those things. Saying something someone else says or thinks is not the same as thinking that.
@CNNPolitics So he genuinely apologized, and yet people are still demonizing him, after calling for him to publicly apologize.
@KayFellowz Agreed. This is bad regardless of the perpetrator of victim. I think the solution is for the individuals targeted to vocally reject the bullying, viewers to stand up regardless of whether they agree with the victim‚Äôs views, and for companies to stand up also.
@haaretzcom While it‚Äôs legitimate to say ‚ÄúFive times Trump made decisions that Palestinians (or certainly Palestinian leadership) didn‚Äôt agree with‚Äù, using the word ‚Äútargeted‚Äù is very subjective, especially regarding point 1 - US embassy.
@KayFellowz I guess it‚Äôs also an indication that this bullying or threat of job security based on political affiliation is dangerous because it‚Äôs working?
@KayFellowz Sigh. The increasing acceptability of mob bullying is pretty worrying.

@lyndseyfifield 2) I suppose your point is especially valid when it‚Äôs the first time anyone has followed a given story, so it‚Äôs what frames their perception of the entire event.
@lyndseyfifield 1) Yeah, I think the problem of journalists cherry picking the points that best fits their desired narratives is a pretty wide one, and is fairly hard to avoid when people aren‚Äôt in the habit of researching primary sources themselves.
@lyndseyfifield There are key details missing for people to gain enough perception of what happened to gauge guilt, certainly. But the detail that the shooter was in someone else‚Äôs home uninvited is quite different, unique enough to be of interest.
@ILikeMikePerry @daveanthony @RedwoodGirl Saying ‚Äúyou owned yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúyou admitted your error‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make it so. It‚Äôs the Twitter equivalent of just putting your hands over your ears and screaming. Scandinavian countries are not socialist governments, therefore shouldn‚Äôt be used to flaunt ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù.
@ILikeMikePerry @daveanthony @RedwoodGirl That‚Äôs precisely not what I‚Äôm saying, but congrats on your attempted ‚Äúgotcha‚Äù.
@ILikeMikePerry @daveanthony @RedwoodGirl The retweet references socialism being bad, and the response compares the US to a few other countries‚Äô child poverty rate. The implication is clear - socialism isn‚Äôt bad. Yes, they have socialist policies based on hugely successful capitalism. That‚Äôs not socialism.
@NoahPollak It‚Äôs also historically ignorant as shekels are an ancient unit of currency used by many cultures. You can‚Äôt just label someone as antisemitic because they use a commonly used, and non-derogatory, word as a term for ‚Äúmoney‚Äù.
@daveanthony @RedwoodGirl Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden are not socialist countries. They‚Äôre capitalist countries. China, and Venezuela are socialist, however.
@KevinSMayfield @xan_desanctis Oh it wasn‚Äôt any implication on my part of an excuse. It was a question of why ‚Äúoff-duty‚Äù was used. This seems beyond awful if the report is true. Just awful.
@PardesSeleh @LisaAMoyer That‚Äôs a pretty common phrase, and isn‚Äôt anti-Semitic because shekels are an ancient unit of currency used by multiple cultures. I‚Äôm all out for calling out anti-semitism when it exists, or indeed all racism, but there has to be evidence. The word ‚Äúshekels‚Äù is not evidence.

@MillerBombz @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Gillibrand or Clinton would be proud of that selective quote! I said the target IF NOT EXPLICITLY PROVIDED is irrelevant. She‚Äôs accusing SOME GROUP of being hateful without either evidence or specific naming of that group or individuals.
RT @redwhitebluex2: @montie @LowTaxChloe A Barrister...blaming the victim...awesome.
@medwoman1 @daren_barnett @kenjKage @SenGillibrand I think this is especially true when it comes to abortion, because the true core of the issue (from my understanding) is the definition of life. All arguments stem from that focal point of disagreement, and so talking about souls or choice etc don‚Äôt always apply across sides.
@medwoman1 @daren_barnett @kenjKage @SenGillibrand I think this is a case of arguing over issues that make assumptions for which there is no agreement. There‚Äôs no point arguing with/without the assumption of God if not all parties agree (for example) that God exists.
@MillerBombz @Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY I think the target, if not explicitly provided, is irrelevant. It‚Äôs a competitive political post, so it‚Äôs fair to assume that the ‚Äúthey‚Äù are her political opponents, unless otherwise stated.
@medwoman1 @daren_barnett @kenjKage @SenGillibrand Again, this is a distraction from the original point. Your arguments are based on your assumptions of life, however, and aren‚Äôt a legitimate counter to anyone who disagrees on that assumption. It‚Äôs like arguing an atheist by citing the Bible.
@medwoman1 @kenjKage @daren_barnett @SenGillibrand But paths, by nature of their design, have limits and constrictions. The whole point of general law and order in a civilized society is to define these limits fairly to enable liberty for individuals without impacting other freedoms unnecessarily.
@Ben_Ghanem @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Are you agreeing or disagreeing...? What I‚Äôm saying is that making a blanket statement about an entire ‚Äúother‚Äù, I.e. ‚Äúthey‚Äù, are hateful is itself hateful because you are negatively labeling an entire group of individuals, something the Democrats correctly criticize.
@medwoman1 @kenjKage @daren_barnett @SenGillibrand I think this being warped into a debate on abortion is missing the original point. It‚Äôs not enough to follow your own views of morality because it opens the door for complete subjective morality to every obvious extreme. What‚Äôs important is not to assume moral superiority.
@nevvyz @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY Why not? It‚Äôs a sweeping statement implying that a faceless ‚ÄúThey‚Äù are hateful.
@the_edwin_mix @Ocasio2018 @Biaggi4NY No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a specific criticism of making general statements like ‚ÄúThey hate‚Äù. I.e. broad accusation of general hatred.

@tom_watson @LowTaxChloe When many of the aggressive players in the political arena label everything as a ‚Äúfight‚Äù, ‚Äúwar‚Äù or ‚Äúbattle‚Äù, or opposing viewpoints as violent, then violence or at least threat of violence begins to become acceptable, because it‚Äôs fighting violence with violence. It‚Äôs disgusting.
@robsmithonline When the aim is to spark outrage regardless of truth, you know their entire political strategy.

@fuglydug @SenGillibrand One word for you: Whataboutism. The rules are the abuse of the SC to push through lesislation. I believe this regardless of whether the government is on the Left or Right. That‚Äôs not the purpose of the judicial system. You‚Äôre assuming I‚Äôm biased, but I am not.
@zorro7787 @SenGillibrand Hence legislation being pushed through by legislators. If it‚Äôs illegal by law, it can‚Äôt be done. If it‚Äôs legal by law, it can. But don‚Äôt force legislative matters to the SC to avoid responsibility. It‚Äôs an abuse of the judicial system.

After more polite conversation regarding Palestinian aid with @TheFrauBlau, Craig added me to another threatening list. I hate to block people, but he‚Äôs now blocked. It says a lot that I‚Äôm added to these kinds of lists when I‚Äôm expressing moderate conservative views... https://t.co/1Q16Ch2pIW
@LaciWilliams10 In all seriousness, I‚Äôm not a fan of these nano news cycles. Nothing matters for very long; which tends to mean nothing really matters...
@BarryMoskow @MDScienceMom @medwoman1 @SenGillibrand If we focused on my second point, which is for legislators to legislate and judges to judge, no-one would have anything to be so concerned or faux-outraged about. You can‚Äôt abuse a system to your benefit and then be enraged when it might not go your way. The system is broken.
@xan_desanctis This entire mess is a result of losing sight of what the judicial branch is for. It‚Äôs been treated as a legislation cheat-code for decades, and for legislators to avoid taking any responsibility or risk
@AymanM These two cuts are not comparable. Objectivity and context is important here. The first cuts are justifiable due to the politicization of refugee status and misuse of funds. The second cuts are, in my opinion, hard to justify.
@LaciWilliams10 It‚Äôs certainly busy work for our thumbs!
@JudgeJeanine And the Left‚Äôs go-to tactic of calling anyone on the Right a racist bigot sexist homophobe without any evidence.
@Pontifex @ynkyfan20 1) Free will? 2) Does God‚Äôs plan include the abuse of religious power for evil?
@KamVTV Ironically, both objectively mediocre football players at best.
@TianaTheFirst @benshapiro Not the most convincing argument from Matt...
@SethMacFarlane @AlexBorstein Congrats Alex. Also, thanks Seth for confirming that you‚Äôre not the voice of Lois.
@bailnicole Can you provide context? What does better treatment mean, and who is being talked about with regards to ‚Äúmore pay‚Äù?
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman Universally true!!!
@RoamingMil I think this is an excellent point. In my mind, it depends on the severity and frequency of their extremism. If someone has a mixture of reasonable and controversial statements, yes. However, if the agreeable statement is alone in a sea of garbage, no.
While @TheFrauBlau and I have respectful and civil discussion, I‚Äôm apparently a terrorist. Glad @CraigY704 was there to tell me! Or maybe it‚Äôs just a list of people who might be interested in watches for terrorists? Who knows at this point ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è https://t.co/owyI3RbgSO
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman üëçüèª My impression has been that some cuts have been more justified than others. For example, I was generally supportive of the UNRWA cuts based on demonstrated fund misuse, but this new example seems far less justifiable at first glance.
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman Absolutely, while I‚Äôm generally pro-Israel, it would be wrong not to acknowledge that there are real victims on both sides of this hugely complex situation. Thank you for the link, I‚Äôll read it later, and thank you for the genuine civility.
@KayaJones Literally not the definition of treason. It can be bad politically, but criticizing Trump is not treason. He‚Äôs not King.
@xan_desanctis Is that your opinion or are you quoting someone else‚Äôs statement? Who am I kidding, it doesn‚Äôt matter apparently.
@realannapaulina Can you provide some more context?
@RagingGayCons Seagulls aren‚Äôt arrogant enough for that analogy. Try a peacock or a flamingo.
@trilll_nate @Kesterdaughter Certainly a lack of sympathy
@TheFrauBlau @SarahKSilverman I have no doubt that people are suffering as a results of these cuts. If you have the sources you‚Äôve read, I‚Äôd be genuinely interested in reading them for more info and context. However, there‚Äôs also a reason Arafat was a multi-millionaire while his people lived in poverty.
@BrittMcHenry What were her statements? Some more context would be helpful
@SarahKSilverman So @SenFeinstein got the political stunt she wanted.
@endofanerajc Drugs can kill you. But statements are made for a reason, and statements like that given the context and timing are more than the words alone. @bailnicole understands this, and is just a provocateur.
@nypost It‚Äôs possible to both criticize Serena‚Äôs behavior during the game AND commend her for congratulating her opponent in defeat. She wasn‚Äôt a sore loser.
@trilll_nate @Kesterdaughter These kind of ‚Äúserves you right‚Äù comments are just so needlessly inflammatory. Got to wonder what the purpose of them is.
@KamalaHarris But you said you wouldn‚Äôt vote for him regardless, do you think these documents will change your mind? Also, were you concerned when the Democrats abuses the Supreme Court to force through legislation?
@marklutchman He‚Äôd also have better passing stats than Kaepernick too...
@SarahKSilverman The PLO calling this poliical blackmail is the height of irony given their history regarding the use of foreign funds. While I feel truly terrible for the people who are affected by these cuts, some money doesn‚Äôt go to these people. It is at least part-funding continued violence.

@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump This type of ‚Äúergo decedo‚Äù argument doesn‚Äôt actually solve anything. It‚Äôs important for conservatives that we debate specific issues openly. Telling people to get out isn‚Äôt a way of growing conservatism. It‚Äôs a way of alienating people who disagree.
@bailnicole I have to disagree. While prison is indeed meant to punish, there is a difference between government-approved punishment that follows rules and chaotic anarchy that leaves people to fend for themselves. Doesn‚Äôt make us much better if we disregard the rights of the vulnerable.
@redsteeze ‚ÄúChecks and balances blah blah blah, now let‚Äôs abuse the judicial system to force through legislation‚Äù
@endofanerajc In what context? Not being snarky, just interested in more info
@SenGillibrand Firstly, there is no evidence of this. Secondly, this should be a lesson to push legislation through legislators and not the judiciary. You made the most of a Left-leaning Supreme Court, you have to play by the rules of the game you‚Äôve abused.

@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Accusations aren‚Äôt evidence. I know my own views. My own views are very clear, as you yourself has sad. I‚Äôm proud to own my views.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I know my own views. My own views are very clear, as you yourself has sad. I‚Äôm proud to own my views.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 üòÇ what are you asking me? Copy paste as much as you want, but I‚Äôm fairly sure anything I say will be unacceptable to you. How do I prove to you that I‚Äôm not racist when there‚Äôs no evidence that I am in the first place?
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Well you‚Äôre the expert. Until today I didn‚Äôt know I was a racist sexist bigot homophobe who hates everyone. I‚Äôm pretty lost. I‚Äôm certainly not ashamed of my views as there‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed by.

@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I know. This is amazing for my daily stats. Every time you say you‚Äôre going to leave is great news for me because I know 20 comments are coming in a few minutes.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 What are you asking me? Am I a Trump supporter? No I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm a conservative. None of my replies on this entire thread have been about Trump. Or racism. Or sexism. Or women. Or any of the other things you‚Äôve accused me of.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I‚Äôm amazed my rating from you is that high. Thank you again!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Thanks for reading my stuff though!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Remind me how it‚Äôs racist to mock Kaepernick for being bad at a sport or laughing when Zina Bash is accused of being a white supremicist for scratching her arm? Surely you can‚Äôt see that this is mildy absurd
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I thought you left the conversation two times. I‚Äôm not going to defend myself against bullying or misinformed insults. Looking forward for your third return! What will I be accused of next week, ladies and gentlemen? Killing puppies?
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 This is embarrassing. I truly hope you‚Äôre a troll. To accuse me of all of these things with zero evidence is ridiculous

@michaeljknowles I went to Disney Land once. I‚Äôm therefore Mickey Mouse.
@chris08018 @shaynaEjames Yeah it‚Äôs a big problem. The ability to deal with views you disagree with calmly is crucial
@chris08018 @shaynaEjames I think many Leftists (not all, which is important to remember) definitely get aggressive when ideas are questioned, because every idea is based on the personal assumption of the moral high-ground. I‚Äôll keep trying because it‚Äôs important that arguments are logical and objective!
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 This is why progress is so hard. I genuinely do want discussion, and nowhere have I talked about my or your pro-life or pro-choice views, just the logic that arguments are based upon. But you just want a fight, and label me as someone who is trolling you. It‚Äôs a real pity.
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 I‚Äôve watched Planet of the Apes. Caesar is pretty darn clever after all
@shaynaEjames @chris08018 Wait, I thought we were done? Maybe you could define what you meant by Trumpanzee to clear up any confusion? I took it as a Trump voter/supporter (I am neither), with the intellectual capacity of a chimpanzee (which is probably false, depending on the chimpanzee).
@CassandraRules @JacobAWohl He‚Äôs definitely the best on CNN.
@chris08018 @shaynaEjames It‚Äôs just bait. I didn‚Äôt rise to it. Because I really DO care about real discussion.
@shaynaEjames As said on our other conversation: Goodbye. I‚Äôm disappointed that you weren‚Äôt able to see what I was saying through your assumptions about who I am, what I believe, and why I‚Äôm taking the time to talk to you.
@shaynaEjames Goodbye. I‚Äôm disappointed that you weren‚Äôt able to see what I was saying through your assumptions about who I am, what I believe, and why I‚Äôm taking the time to talk to you.
It‚Äôs a shame as I‚Äôm actually interested in real discussion. But apparently I‚Äôm a twat who voted for Trump (can‚Äôt vote - üá¨üáß) who hates women. This is going to be an uphill battle but I‚Äôm going to keep trying. Real, respectful discussion is the route to change. #redwhitebluex2 https://t.co/CoTxz9o2pZ
@shaynaEjames Ultimately, a debate can exist as long as there are multiple viewpoints on a topic, without making any valuations on validity of the debate arguments. For example, the world is flat. A debate exists because some believe the world is flat, even though my feelings are pretty set üåé
@shaynaEjames I can understand why you feel that way. But many reasonable debates DO exist as there are undeniably people who disagree with you. The fact you don‚Äôt respect their views doesn‚Äôt make the debate not exist. Thank you for being slightly less rude, we might be getting somewhere!
@cam_wallaceee This type of grandstanding is beyond ridiculous. If you want laws, push them through legislature. Don‚Äôt use the judiciary as a political cheat-code and then be annoyed when the Republicans get the controller!
@sujishin92 @brithume @CoryBooker If politics had an ‚Äúineffective effort‚Äù award, he‚Äôd won the prize!

@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand And trust me, as a Jew, I might have a grasp of what it‚Äôs like to be discriminated against. However, that doesn‚Äôt make my views right or wrong! You think I think I‚Äôm a victim. My words are what I stand behind, not my intersectional group.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand The subject was Gillibrand‚Äôs comment that no debate exists due to safety provided by abortion. I said that a debate does exist. You start talking about women controlling their bodies. I would love to stay on topic.
@shaynaEjames Call me all the names you want. A debate exists when there are sides who disagree. This is a logical fact, not a political opinion. So to say a debate doesn‚Äôt exist is absolutist. Yes I‚Äôm a fragile Jewish white man...doesn‚Äôt make me wrong.
@shaynaEjames Oh, and that I‚Äôm some horrible person who doesn‚Äôt care about maternal death rates. So I guess I can throw ‚Äúmother killer‚Äù into the mix. None of this is relevant to my original statement which wasn‚Äôt even pro-life or pro-choice!
@shaynaEjames So let me get this...I said that a debate exists...because there are people who disagree. You‚Äôve called me ‚Äúyou men‚Äù, ‚Äúobtuse‚Äù, ‚Äúwhite guys‚Äù, ‚Äúfragile‚Äù, ‚Äútool‚Äù...and I haven‚Äôt been aggressive to you personally once, but I‚Äôm disrespectful? üòÇ
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand Classic Left-ist tactic there. Assume I don‚Äôt care, regardless of any evidence that supports your claim. You are making one other key assumption. You‚Äôre assuming I‚Äôm pro-life, when I‚Äôve said nothing of the sort. Acknowledging that a debate exists is not the same as disagreeing!
@autumnhopeklein So much neuroticism...
@shaynaEjames I also think that ‚Äúyou women‚Äù could be deemed offensive by some, given that ‚Äúyou X‚Äù is offensive in many scenarios; such as ‚ÄúYou Jews‚Äù. It‚Äôs making a sweeping statement about an entire group...which personally I think isn‚Äôt all that acceptable
@shaynaEjames Wait, so I‚Äôm Jewish. What intersectional box do I fit into? I‚Äôm not being fragile, I‚Äôm making pretty objective and respectful statements, and all you‚Äôre trying to do is distract and attack. My original statement was referring to Gillibrand‚Äôs statement.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand I‚Äôm trying to improve the narrative and speak respectfully with people about such a difficult and emotive topic. Being disrespectful, and quite frankly sexist, to me makes that quite difficult.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand 4) @autumnhopeklein saw this debate earlier. I, nor my sex, are legislating anything. Legislation based on abortion obviously applies to biological females because biological females CAN have abortions while biological men can‚Äôt.	5) all of these are facts without being pro-life.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand 1) you‚Äôre assuming my position on abortion, when all I did was question someone‚Äôs absolutist view. 2) yes I am aware, but that‚Äôs also an illogical argument - using the rare and specific to legislate the broad and general. 3) many women are pro-life...
‚ÄúYou men‚Äù should be as unacceptable as ‚Äúyou women‚Äù. They are both derogatory terms that I would never consider using. What‚Äôs even more ridiculous is that I wasn‚Äôt even stating a view about abortion! #EqualityforAll #Feminism https://t.co/cSAEQXdbZh
@JSmithpolitics1 @DailyCaller (I actually live in the US) üòÇ I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd agree they need a Donald Trump figure. I‚Äôm not a giant fan of fighting fire with fire, because all it leads to is each side rushing towards radicalism. It is hard to see an alternative in the current climate sometimes though.
@shaynaEjames @SenGillibrand Two problems. Firstly, I was responding to Gillibrand‚Äôs assertion that abortion is to protect their lives, yet you‚Äôre posing a different debate regarding control of their bodies, which I made no statement about. Secondly, ‚Äúyou men‚Äù?
@JSmithpolitics1 @DailyCaller I truly hope so. UK politics is becoming increasingly far-Left too. It‚Äôs deeply worrying
@DailyCaller @JSmithpolitics1 The problem is, are they embarrassing themselves? What worries me more is that while we on the Right are laughing, a lot of those on the far-Left are digging their heels in, becoming more radical, more outraged, more extreme.
@heyyitsbev_ Some pretty strong America-centric arrogance from the Left there...

@ChrisWrightActs @autumnhopeklein It‚Äôs important not to get off-topic. Technically, the cells forming are a combination of the father and mother‚Äôs cells...so it‚Äôs at least slightly more complicated than a single cell-ownership situation
@benshapiro Haha! Stupid men. üôÑ
@KamalaHarris This is why legislators should legislate and judges should judge. Your fear of losing Roe v Wade was caused by the abuse of the judicial system to force through legislation outside of the proper channels. The SC isn‚Äôt a weapon to wield to create law.
@SenGillibrand There is a debate. Being so absolutist and then demonizing those who are equally absolutist just furthers divisions on an already divisive topic. Acknowledge there is a debate and then discuss!
@austentatious24 @HeyItsSteveYo @DevinSenaUI No worries! Thanks for listening
@HeyItsSteveYo @austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI No problem. :) my comment should have been more clear. Glad we can be civil, go us!
@austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI I‚Äôm agreeing with @DevinSenaUI that the arguments people use are lazy and illogical!
@austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI No not at all, just the logical argument of ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like X, don‚Äôt do X‚Äù, because you can care about issues beyond your own actions. I‚Äôm agreeing with @DevinSenaUI!
@HeyItsSteveYo @austentatious24 @DevinSenaUI You‚Äôre trying to bait and deflect by implying I think the comparison of abortion and slavery is illogical. If you read what I said, it was pointing out that the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get one‚Äù is illogical. You can care about an issue BEYOND your own actions. Are those words small enough?
@KamalaHarris Stop telling everyone what to do...?
@autumnhopeklein Because he‚Äôs a sanctimonious hypocrite.
@dianeeldredge99 I don‚Äôt know, he just HIT his daughter on national TV! The guy has no shame!
@BernieSanders Pandering time!
@autumnhopeklein Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not childish, but more of a commonly used strategy to deflect and destroy debates. Bring an entire broad area down based on specific and rare scenarios.

@ChrisWrightActs @autumnhopeklein This kind of logic, regardless of what side of the abortion debate you fall, is irrelevant, and over simplified. The issue is clearly not the woman or the uterus. The issue is clearly what is in the uterus. This logic tries to dismiss specific and relevant debate
@ARmastrangelo Agree completely. Ideology needs to be consistent, otherwise we‚Äôre in the scenario of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok with a dictator as long as they do what I want‚Äù
@iwasid @ThisIsGaZa @AsaWinstanley I‚Äôm responding directly to the exact language, and you‚Äôre not responding to what I‚Äôm saying, just following the same old phrases. Unfortunately, this is not worth my time.
@DevinSenaUI It's a very lazy and illogical argument. I think this is one example of a political flip-issue - the Left want no government involvement based on impacting an individual's rights, and the Right want government involvement based on enforcing an individual's rights.
@iwasid @ThisIsGaZa @AsaWinstanley You‚Äôre deliberately misconstruing what I‚Äôm saying. There is a difference between racism existing in a country, and a country being based on racism. They‚Äôre clearly different, and you‚Äôre willingly ignoring that key difference
@jeremycorbyn This would be more exciting if it hadn‚Äôt previously been under public ownership, and with such disastrous results. The complete lack of investment or maintainence still affects us today

@Migraine_nay @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI Yes but I wasn‚Äôt disputing it‚Äôs validity, I was asking about the gospels specifically because the gospels were used to define whether you could believe in abortion.

@LaciWilliams10 No, luckily he‚Äôs just doing some major PR stunt work. It‚Äôs between Sanders, Harris, Booker and Warren.

@RealJamesWoods The ‚Äúchewing gum‚Äù words can be removed and this statement remains the same.
@BernieSanders The redefinition of undocumented/illegal immigrants as ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù is offensive to legal immigrants. It doesn‚Äôt harm your overall case of a compassionate position if you use the correct terminology. It may prevent the division you yourself are causing.
@sienknox Some things you just can‚Äôt say. üò≠
@RubYaWrong @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI This is a general problem with debating outside of the same religion or with those who don‚Äôt believe in a religion. Using your own religious texts as proof isn‚Äôt the best way of making others change their mind. It‚Äôs like me quoting the Talmud to you.
Hey gang. Remember @OMAROSA? Me neither. Cool. #Omarosa #newscycle
@jdawsey1 Nothing more heroic than assault on an innocent person...üôÑüôÑüôÑ

@josh_hammer He‚Äôs talking about the band, right?
@realDailyWire https://t.co/Y4Co9AIj0W
@mwest410 @BernieSanders Which means that legislation needs to be specific...the fact that everything gets punted to the judiciary is just laziness on the side of the legislators. That‚Äôs not how it‚Äôs designed to work.
@RubYaWrong @MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI Thank you, but I‚Äôm not looking for a new religion right now. I just love challah way too much
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI @MBlanchie Thank you for apologizing. I was honestly asking out of genuine interest. I understand that it‚Äôs such an emotive topic, and so much conversation surrounding it is aggressive to begin with. I‚Äôm trying my best to change that!
@MikePJD Are they mutually exclusive? üòÇ
@BernieSanders Based on what evidence? The amount of fear you constantly peddle is absurd. If you want laws you can uphold, push them through legislature, not the judiciary.
@MBlanchie @RubYaWrong @DevinSenaUI Very interesting, thank you.
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI Furthermore, it‚Äôll only alienate those who disagree with you, making it less likely for them to ever change their mind. If that‚Äôs what you truly desire, it will pay dividends if you engage respectfully when people are genuinely interested and ask real questions
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI My questions have focused on the gospel, and @MBlanchie took my interest seriously and we had a productive and respectful and relevant conversation. Just being aggressive and ignoring my genuine question doesn‚Äôt encourage open discussion
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI Thank you @MBlanchie :), that‚Äôs interesting. Thank you also for taking my genuine questions seriously, unfortunately it was not done elsewhere by others on this thread!
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI Why are you getting defensive? I‚Äôm genuinely interested in learning about abortion from the perspective of the gospel, as mentioned in the original tweet. You‚Äôre treating me as if I‚Äôm disrespecting your beliefs or disagreeing with you!
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI I know the word abortion isn‚Äôt in the Bible, but I was just genuinely curious if there were any specifically applicable parts in the gospels given the original claim that the gospel is incompatible with being pro-abortion.
@Slate https://t.co/Y4Co9AIj0W
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI But is there anything in the gospels that is applicable to abortion, or is it mostly referencing Old Testament statements?
@scrowder I think it was you! üôÑüòÇ
@MBlanchie @DevinSenaUI That‚Äôs the Old Testament too
@Wontconform11 @DevinSenaUI That‚Äôs Old Testament, no? I was just interested in hearing any specifics in the gospels.

@JCNSeverino @xan_desanctis Bullying is applauded when it‚Äôs used by the left.
@ShannonBream For someone who knows the history, she asks a lot of judicially irrelevant questions
@ShannonBream Everything she‚Äôs doing is based on getting his personal opinions in the form of ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù. This is the price that has to be paid when the judiciary are used as legislators.
@BernieSanders This doesn‚Äôt exactly settle the case that Roe v Wade is solid judicially does it? Maybe do what was meant and pursue legislation using legislators, rather than forcing it through the judiciary?
@KamalaHarris He refused to answer because all of your leading questions are not judicial and have clear political implications you‚Äôre trying to trick him with. Your continued updates are ridiculous, hardly any of them focus on judicial factors. They‚Äôre all attempted ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù
@iwasid @ThisIsGaZa @AsaWinstanley Are you talking about Israel, or all of its surrounding countries? If Israel, there are reasonable arguments regarding the so-called one nation law being racist. But to say the entire state is racist when Israel is made up of multiple faiths, races, and ethnicities is absurd.

@guypbenson She‚Äôs abusing a logical fallacy to try and make a cheap point. Rather than debating abortion objectively, she‚Äôs trying to imply that because there are no laws regarding ‚Äúmen‚Äù having abortions, there should be no laws for ‚Äúwomen‚Äù regarding abortions. One...small...flaw
Quite a few Bachelor quotes thrown in there. I do HATE it when people are here for the wrong reasons. https://t.co/yYj5EY6Ntf
@historBilia @KamalaHarris My later comment addresses this. I‚Äôm not arguing with your conclusion, I‚Äôm arguing against the logic of her argument to get to that conclusion. There is a difference. The abortion debate doesn‚Äôt need logical fallacies to be reasonable and effective.
@Silence17Dogood @KamalaHarris Please don‚Äôt assume I‚Äôm arguing for a pro-life position. I‚Äôm focusing on the logical fallacy Kamala Harris is using to drive a political narrative. Her question was illogical, I‚Äôm not making any statement about her conclusion.
@historBilia @KamalaHarris I‚Äôm not trying to make an abortion debate. It‚Äôs a comment on how her statement makes no logical sense. I‚Äôm saying that the two sexes (based on her definition) are different based on their ability to host a fetus, and therefore aren‚Äôt exactly the same in the way she‚Äôs implying.
@davidhogg111 https://t.co/Y4Co9AIj0W
And the asinine statement of the year goes to... #KamalaHarris! https://t.co/IN5pC8p2j9
@KamalaHarris This...is...ridiculous. If both sexes could give birth, this would be a valid statement. But since the only laws regard abortion, and only people with fetuses in their womb are ‚Äúfemale‚Äù (given @KamalaHarris uses ‚Äúmale body‚Äù), then of course they only apply to females.

@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins Read what I said. I made no assumption of which side. But clearly you have a side by your language implying stupidity at not understanding the ‚Äúobvious answer‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not on one side or the other, why label others as stupid?
@cbns007 @DevinSenaUI I am truly limited by the 140 characters lol!! That sounds like a crazy idea üòÇ the number of people who genuinely want to adopt is always so upsettingly high too.
@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins Your analogy doesn‚Äôt apply because abortion being right/wrong is an ethically-based opinion, not a matter of physics. Falling as a result of gravity is evidence that it exists. Calling someone stupid for not believing in gravity is not.
@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins Yes...but we‚Äôre not trying to convince people that gravity exists are we? If your goal is to change their opinion on abortion, which I assume it is, then what makes you think calling them stupid will help?
@cbns007 @DevinSenaUI Conversely, abortion is cheap because it‚Äôs pretty simple, especially in the early stages of pregnancy.
@cbns007 @DevinSenaUI I know adoption costs more, I wasn‚Äôt disputing that. But because adoption should be WORTH more doesn‚Äôt mean it shouldn‚Äôt cost more. Logistically, adoption is much more complex, we can‚Äôt just hand out kids for free without checking who is adopting them, for example.
@merisman2014 @LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins But the problem there is that your answer is divisive. It alienated both those who strongly disagree with whatever your view is, and makes it less likely that you‚Äôre going to convince the undecided. Calling people stupid is not a way to change minds
@LilaGraceRose @RichardDawkins A debate between two completely opposed sides with no room to budge sounds like a bit of a waste of time to me. I‚Äôd rather focus on conversations with people in the middle who have reasonable opinions in either direction...

@Emma4Change Luckily, well-mannered 4 year olds aren‚Äôt qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. Judges with solid histories of just judicial decisions are. And let‚Äôs not talk about manners when Kavanaugh and his children were heckled and bullied throughout the hearing.
@SenWarren Yeah! Mob rule! Bullying is great if you‚Äôre the bully
@LoConservative The purpose of the judiciary is that it‚Äôs apolitical. So even if all of the lies about Kavanaugh were true, and he was the devil himself, his solid judicial history is all that matters, not his personal views. But it only works in one direction when RGB is lauded as a Dem hero.
@SenTedCruz If Trump nominated Obama to the seat, and Obama said one good thing about Trump, they‚Äôd be calling Obama an enemy of the people. This is all so deeply absurd.
@DavidRutz @redsteeze 1) he didn‚Äôt refuse the handshake. 2) if he did, you‚Äôre assuming reason and intent. 3) if your assumptions were correct, that‚Äôs his right as a citizen. 4) his rights and views would have no impact on his judicial decisions with his demonstrated history of just decisions.

@wyndovelh @lauren_hoggs @davidhogg111 @fred_guttenberg There is no clear evidence that he ‚Äúrefused‚Äù the handshake.

@peaceuk2017 @jew_london @Carole5736 @adamlangleben @lucianaberger @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour You‚Äôre both so sure it‚Äôs an Israeli bot...and yet you are still spending seconds of your life interacting. Not sure what that means...
@peaceuk2017 @jew_london @Carole5736 @adamlangleben @lucianaberger @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour So everyone who disagrees with you is a troll or bot...? When have I even disagreed with you? It‚Äôs a matter of reading the thread, and trying to avoid absolutist statements like ‚Äúall Jews‚Äù...
@jew_london @Carole5736 @peaceuk2017 @adamlangleben @lucianaberger @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour This is all classic dilution/diversion tactics. @jew_london doesn‚Äôt claim that all Jews feel one way. It‚Äôs clear that mainstream Jews in the UK are unhappy with antisemitism within the Labour Party. You‚Äôre jumping to Israel, calling it #ApartheidIsrael, and calling him a troll
@jew_london @peaceuk2017 @Carole5736 @adamlangleben @lucianaberger @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour Wait...so you‚Äôre not happy by the arbitrary use of ‚Äúmajority‚Äù, yet you pin your arguments on one Jewish person whose views match your own...
@Bawanaris @Jacqui_Smith1 And #Corbyn is the anus between the two cheeks.

@mahwashajaz_ Men aren‚Äôt disgusting. This man is disgusting. To combat disgusting men, we can‚Äôt label all men as disgusting. It makes it meaningless.
@jeremycorbyn It‚Äôs also shameful how the money was used in some cases, their links with Hamas, and the continual false definition of many as refugees for political reasons. Throwing money at a problem doesn‚Äôt help if that money is mis-used.
I wrote an article about this. Call something violence so violence is justified in return. https://t.co/TpZgwFpI4b https://t.co/IYH4kH3sFv
While members of @UKLabour quitting over #LabourAntisemitism is respectable and honorable, if #Corbyn doesn‚Äôt resign, it‚Äôll just mean that the high-ranking positions will continue to be filled by his loyal followers (like @HackneyAbbott), making fighting #Antisemitism harder.
@EuanPhilipps @jeremycorbyn @DavePrentis @UKLabour It‚Äôs amazing how people judge the quality of a source by how much their view supports the narrative they want to push. Confirmation bias at its very worst.
#BillClinton is literally shameless. Also note that the priest on his left groped #ArianaGrande during the same event. But hey. R. E. S. P. I. C. T, as #AlSharpton always says. #ArethaFuneral #metoo #respect #RespectAriana #RespectArianaAndAllWomen https://t.co/YDRoBJDCfY

@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan You know, this entire conversation you haven‚Äôt answered a single question. You‚Äôve been either abusive ‚Äúpunk‚Äù or patronizing ‚Äúson‚Äù, and used screenshots instead of using your words. Calling people fascists doesn‚Äôt make this statement not AS. I gave you a chance. I‚Äôm done listening
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan And we got here from criticism of Corbyn how...?
@haaretzcom ‚Äúaccused‚Äù isn‚Äôt the correct word. #Corbyn HAS done all of those things.
@Strangeland_Elf @michaeljknowles @JussajustJustin @realDailyWire For so long I have wondered why @benshapiro hates @michaeljknowles so much. Tonight, that question was answered.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan @ComradeVeidt, I‚Äôm completely lost regarding the flow of your argument, but I have to commend your blitzkrieg-like screenshot ability.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan Oh good! More screenshots! So you‚Äôve found antisemitic quotes by Jews, therefore no-one else is antisemitic? So Corbyn isn‚Äôt antisemitic? I can‚Äôt work out if you‚Äôre a troll or serious, but the logic doesn‚Äôt make sense either way. How does this vindicate Corbyn...?
@IngrahamAngle @Rasmussen_Poll Really don‚Äôt think that ‚ÄúTrump Bump‚Äù is a good phrase to use.
@tebo_michael @dianeeldredge99 @realDonaldTrump By all means criticize, even hate him. But unmatched? Really though?
@annakatclarke @LaciWilliams10 While I‚Äôm a strong advocate for the #2a, and see the arguments in favor of campus carry (and agree with some of these arguments), I don‚Äôt think that phrasing rights arguments as ‚ÄúIf you agree with A, then you must agree with B‚Äù is the way to persuade those who disagree.
@Liz_Wheeler In the age of #MeToo, it‚Äôs disgusting that the accusations (and therefore, the chance of justice for the thousands of victims) is jeopardized in favor of pushing a political narrative. It‚Äôs absolutely revolting.
@JSmithpolitics1 @Cernovich You might enjoy an article I wrote on this topic, making sure that we separate the leaders from the people who follow Catholicism‚Äôs true values:	https://t.co/gFVK9pThxB
@RealJamesWoods Probably only makes sense if she‚Äôs an expert on handouts, and so can criticize you for your supposed lack of knowledge? What a delightful paradox
@JSmithpolitics1 @Cernovich What is most upsetting is that any other factors are even discussed. Crimes of child abuse by those who are deemed leaders of morality shouldn‚Äôt need additional political context. The fact that anything else the Pope believes is discussed in the same sentence is despicable
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan Got it. Israelis are fascists/Nazis. Classic. Doesn‚Äôt really address your post talking about Rabbi Sacks leading a march, I.e. Whataboutism. But call Israelis Nazis if that‚Äôs what you enjoy. Screenshot articles are all the proof we need of blatant Nazism, ‚Äúson‚Äù
@Cernovich @JSmithpolitics1 It‚Äôs the ultimate proof of narratives being more important than content. In the time of #MeToo, it seems it matters much more when it also fits a political narrative. The #Pope is more left-leaning, so criticism is diluted by linking it to conservative smears. It‚Äôs disgusting.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan What‚Äôs your point...?
@Heminator @bethanyshondark The attempt to in any way nullify credible accusations against the Vatican by labeling it as a conservative smear is spitting in the face of the #MeToo movement.
@ComradeVeidt @eddiemarsan Whataboutism is #corbyn fans‚Äô only weapon. It‚Äôs ridiculous. #whataboutism
@willcollier @emzanotti This is just so gross. In the days of #MeToo, accusations of misconduct should be taken as separate entities, not assumed to be part of a greater political goal, regardless of whether that‚Äôs the case. Justice for the victims is what matters.
@MattWalshBlog I‚Äôm just waiting for #Avenatti to release #StormyDaniels statement on her magical night with the Pope at this point...

@TianaTheFirst It‚Äôs a difficult line to tread if you try and be intellectually honest while commentating on politics. If you support, you‚Äôre a hack. If you criticize, you‚Äôre a traitor. It‚Äôs so so dumb, but very real and very frustrating
Can someone please define #ReproductiveJustice for me? Pro-life or pro-choice, sticking ‚Äújustice‚Äù after everything provides nothing but vague undefined concepts in a bid to win the moral debate without actually having to debate. It‚Äôs justice! Duh! Who doesn‚Äôt want justice?

@autumnhopeklein Trip hazard alert
‚ÄúWhataboutism‚Äù autocorrects on my phone to ‚ÄúWhat about Ian‚Äù. I knew Apple loved me.
RT @DLoesch: Nuance is dead and tribalists have zero interest in genuine conversation.
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan A 2 state solution is also impossible when Hamas calls for ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù and the annihilatiion of Israel and Jews. The silly thing is that I am saying that what matters is the safety of the civilians on both sides, and you‚Äôre justifying support of Hamas. Says a lot
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan You haven‚Äôt even read what I said! If corbyn was a pacifist, which he‚Äôs not, why does he condemn violence in one direction against civilians but condone it in another? Even if I thought both sides or neither sides were terrorists, that question is the important one.
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan If you cared to answer, I actually oppose the dropping of rockets on Palestinians. I like to advocate for the general value of life regardless of what side the civilians fall under. Corbyn vocally supports Hamas. How is that peaceful?
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan Pacifist who supports groups who, in their charter, call for the destruction of nations and the murder of Jews. What a peaceful chap. I have no problem with the fact he supports Palestinian groups. If he were truly a pacifist, he might mention rockets fired at civilians?
@Terrymc1939 @JewishChron Yes...I know...it was ironic...kind of supporting the joke so thanks!
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Also, to some extent; I agree with you that the arguments surrounding healthcare are diluted to overly simplex levels and miss the complexities of real systems, just to drive support or opposition. However, that works both ways, such as blind support for ‚Äúsingle payer‚Äù in the US.
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan Example: Corbyn is vocally critical of the so-called terrorism of Israeli policies; yet very silent when it comes to the terrorist actions of Hamas and Hezbollah; groups he openly supports.
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein So many generalizations in one Tweet. If they reference the NHS, feel free to discuss with them. You‚Äôre also not the ambassador for all non-US people who apparently despise the American healthcare system...
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Again. I‚Äôm not going to try and speak for Autumn, she‚Äôs her own person with her own views. However, you called me a moron, and not her, so if you were actually angry at her, it‚Äôs a strange way of showing it...
@BernieSanders In all fairness, the level of helpfulness of a tax cut is directly proportional to the amount of tax you pay. Generally, the richer you are, the more tax you pay. So of course it would ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the rich more...
@SteBartle @eddiemarsan Like Corbyn?
While I disagree with this comparison as people don‚Äôt hold the same moral value as weapons, it certainly highlights that both sides hold absolutist views when it comes to broad and complex issues, and these views might not be logical or consistent. https://t.co/t2AYaBpomC

@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein But when an #antifa member tells me I need socialized medicine, I know EXACTLY what he‚Äôs talking about, and it‚Äôs not your beloved NHS
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein But why are you so angry at me for using that phrase when, since Americans apparently feel this way and I am not an American, I might have a different or better understanding of the complexities of the issue? By all means be annoyed when people say it without understanding

@LittleHardman I feel like much better could be done. I don‚Äôt even know what Graniad means. Googling now...
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Also, very common Leftist tactic right there. I criticize something you like/use a phrase you don‚Äôt like, and you make that thing a basic moral principle: ‚Äúbasic human decency‚Äù and BAM I hate basic human decency. I reject that.
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein ‚ÄúSocialized medicine‚Äù? If you‚Äôre going to be annoyed at Americans as a whole for your presumed use of that phrase, maybe don‚Äôt call me a moron? Someone literally used that phrase when attacking me...
Probably not the most convincing defense...holding the economy hostage... https://t.co/0SE2XEhcmh
@autumnhopeklein I meant how did that come up? Just another lazy comparison?
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Thank God I wasn‚Äôt born on the 101, that would be most of my traffic-complaining time gone forever!
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Yes, I was successfully born in a NHS system. Therefore, socialized medicine is amazing. I‚Äôm not quite that arrogant...!
@LittleHardman @autumnhopeklein Before accusing me of being a moron, the conversation I was referencing was DIRECTLY discussing socialized medicine. I don‚Äôt know why this triggered such outrage...and it‚Äôs also illogical to assume that being born in an NHS hospital means I can‚Äôt criticize socialized healthcare

@Ocasio2018 Some are attacking you because your arguments are based on inaccurate or immoral logic. I support Medicare for all and free college. I DON‚ÄôT support the manner in which these things will be paid for. Asking people if they support healthcare for everyone, most people will say yes.
@EylonALevy What does he mean by more representative? I hate this short vague statements of ‚Äúthis should not be like this‚Äù without any thoughts on what it should be like or how that is to be achieved. ‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt rain today‚Äù ‚ÄòOMG he‚Äôs onto something!‚Äô etc etc

@king_of_bob @Partisangirl I‚Äôm being very clear. I‚Äôm not attempting to compare, but it seems illogical for those who condemn attacks on Palestinian (something I can both understand and also do not support) while justifying violence and sometimes celebrating violence against Israeli civilians.

@KeiraJaneReed1 @OmanReagan @benshapiro @Ocasio2018 How so?
@Partisangirl So just to be clear, you don‚Äôt see harm to Israeli children and harm to Palestinian children, regardless of subjective context or personal opinions, as both equally abhorrent? Don‚Äôt people see how that is a key problem? We can‚Äôt even agree on that?!

@TiteMinge @mrmonty28 @jolly_angelina @MsJulieLenarz @jeremycorbyn Are you OK? I don‚Äôt really understand what you‚Äôre even trying to say. We were talking about #corbyn

@TiteMinge @mrmonty28 @jolly_angelina @MsJulieLenarz @jeremycorbyn Rather than ignore my statement, you could engage and give reasons as to why #corbyn isn‚Äôt antisemitic, and then we could discuss that
@flashimodo @TopTSlo @Partisangirl That‚Äôs completely false. There were injuries, 20 was the most recent number, with at least one serious injury
@Partisangirl My primary issue is the direct targeting of civilians, and when it is condemned when involving Palestinian children by #corbyn, and not when it involves Israeli children
@Partisangirl At no point am I defending Israel or their actions, or saying that the Palestinians don‚Äôt have a right to fight for their beliefs
@Partisangirl Yes, I can read, but that article does not cover the rather important part of international law regarding the protection of civilians
@Partisangirl My point is, and I really hope we can agree, is that we should care about the innocent civilians equally, regardless of which side they ‚Äúbelong‚Äù to
@Partisangirl You say firing rockets at enemy held territory is OK? So what about the children who happen to be under the rockets? Do they not matter?
@Partisangirl If you live with a worldview that violence against one set of civilians is justifiable but you also criticize violence against another set of civilians, it‚Äôs quite clear that peace can‚Äôt be achieved.

@jolly_angelina @MsJulieLenarz I don‚Äôt think anyone is arguing that #Corbyn isn‚Äôt principled. It‚Äôs his principles that are the issue! He‚Äôs hypocritical and inconsistent with his selective support or criticism of nations. That‚Äôs impossible to deny.
@arif3000 @MsJulieLenarz Ironically, @arif3000 , your profile calls for a one state solution and from the river to the sea. Given that this inevitably ends with the mass murder of Jews, I‚Äôm not sure you have much room to accuse Israel of fascistic polices.
@arif3000 @MsJulieLenarz Remind me of the part during the Holocaust where the Jews launched thousands of rockets at the Nazis? You can discuss Israel/Palestine objectively without resorting to accusing Jews or Israelis of being like the Nazis.
@MsJulieLenarz The longer this goes on, the more clear both #Corybn ‚Äòs position is, and the level of acceptance for this within #Labour leadership. Truly worrying, and complete lack of context and objectivity doesn‚Äôt bode well for obtaining peace in Israel.
@tag_ash While it is awful that children suffer in conflict on both sides, the question should be asked as to why #Hamas spend money on weapons and ammunition and not shelters?

https://t.co/OOEU8Q56sv
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal But my point was that the assumption of responsibility is inherently a moral issue.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal Ok no problem. Let‚Äôs agree on what we are discussing. I thought we were talking about the view that those who disagree with abortion and want it outlawed are responsible for the lives that wouldn‚Äôt have existed if abortion had been allowed?
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal If you want a debate about abortion generally, then we can do that another time, this conversation was literally about the morality accusations
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal I want to bring us back to the original start of this conversation. I‚Äôm not interested in debating abortion. I AM interested in defending those who disagree with abortion from accusations of hypocrisy or immorality.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal But not for the people who think it‚Äôs murder. In the same way of serious animal rights activists who oppose animal slaughter for food, for example. In their eyes, it‚Äôs a crime.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal Please read what I said. I‚Äôm not saying abortion is murder. I‚Äôm saying IF someone thinks abortion is murder, then it‚Äôs reasonable to not want murder to occur and also not be responsible for the victim if the murder doesn‚Äôt occur
@glennmid10001 @kathykattenburg @m2mlegal This is again a common deflection. I‚Äôm not accusing anyone of murder. I‚Äôm saying that IF you believe abortion is murder, then it explains the viewpoint and responsibility opinions
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal I don‚Äôt understand. My earlier point, when I mentioned murder, was that you can disagree with what you view as a crime without any expectations of responsibility for the ‚Äúsaved‚Äù victim. I wasn‚Äôt arguing whether abortion is murder, just outlining a viewpoint based on that.
@kathykattenburg @glennmid10001 @m2mlegal So again, it comes to definitions of when life begins, and there are solid arguments for all sides
@glennmid10001 @kathykattenburg @m2mlegal So other countries making it legal doesn‚Äôt imply that it‚Äôs therefore correct. Some countries all over the world enforce inhumane laws. But that‚Äôs besides the point, this conversation is about accusing #ProLife people of being immoral
@politico Oh wow #Avenatti ! It‚Äôs almost like representing #StormyDaniels was a publicity stunt...! https://t.co/55gW5Jr2Qu
@kathykattenburg @m2mlegal Well, I‚Äôm glad to have educated? Lol!
@kathykattenburg @m2mlegal Derogatory and antisemitic slur for a Zionist
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn Tell me to fuck off all you want, you are still refusing to acknowlegde #corbyn‚Äôs hypocrisy
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn 200 rockets, 20+ injured, some severely, damage to property and homes.
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn You‚Äôre trying desperately to deflect. @jimmy_wales comment was regarding Corbyns silence. Putting the Israel/Palestine debate aside, his silence shows implicit support for terrorist acts against Israeli citizens, while speaks out against acts against Palestinian civilians.
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn So violence against squatters is acceptable? Your abject justification of violence is pretty troubling.
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn #corbyn has a perfect right to speak out when Palestinian civilians are killed, but he can‚Äôt claim to care about crimes against humanity and then ignore crimes against humanity when the victims are Israelis/Jews
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn So you require Israelis to die before you care about rocket attacks? I don‚Äôt understand your logic. Corbyn is apparently a humanitarian, but doesn‚Äôt speak out when Israeli civilians are directly targeted. But it‚Äôs OK because none died?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I think there is a pretty solid argument for abortion being murder, it all comes down to when you determine life to begin. I do think that most people who are #ProLife believe to some extent at least that it‚Äôs murder. Anyone out there who is #prolife and disagrees, please do!
@PeteTheRed6579 @CarlAntoine @TopTSlo @Partisangirl And I assume you hold the same outrage towards #Hamas for targeting Israeli children? I show care for Palestinian children and all you see is a hateful person. This is the problem. Read my words and see your inconsistencies. We should care about all innocents.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Thank you. I hope it works, the world would be a much better place if those who disagree talked more ofteb
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I understand! I haven‚Äôt even blocked people who‚Äôve accused me of being a ‚ÄúZio‚Äù, so you‚Äôre perfectly safe. Beggars can‚Äôt be choosers, I don‚Äôt have enough followers to block people üòÇ
@ralphtheblue @jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn How so? Corbyn was silent. If you can point me to a recent quote condoning these recent attacks by #Hamas I will happily recant and apologize.
@igybundy @Partisangirl The pregnant woman and baby dying is clearly awful. However, the ‚Äúyoung man‚Äù you mention was a member of the militant wing of #Hamas, so let‚Äôs not be blind to the truth that #Hamas are guilty of violence aimed at civilians too.
@jimmy_wales @jeremycorbyn Thank you @jimmy_wales for posting this. It was objective and concise. The fact that people frame this as #Zionist shows how far we‚Äôve come from a foundation of objective fact and contextual reasoning. This was about #Corbyn and his hypocrisy, nothing more.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal OK fair enough! I‚Äôm not going to block you, I‚Äôm genuinely interested in real discussions, and I‚Äôm not trying to win points or anything like that. As a conservative, I‚Äôm trying very hard to bridge the division between Left and Right, and try and bring respectful discourse back
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal But this falls apart if you approach abortion as murder, which is the general #ProLife position. You can think murder is wrong and make it illegal without being responsible for those who would be killed...
@CarlAntoine @TopTSlo @Partisangirl Instead of repeated memes, you could converse using words and address the issue of caring for both sides...
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal And I‚Äôm certainly not trying to change your mind. I‚Äôm just tired of #conservatives and #ProLife people being labeled as immoral or uncaring because of a reasonable viewpoint. It‚Äôs intellectually dishonest and divisive.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal That doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs what I think. I‚Äôm just trying to disprove your overall argument regarding your original tweet - regarding only caring about babies under one year old
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal That‚Äôs the point. I‚Äôm arguing the case of those with whom you so strongly disagree
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm saying at all; you‚Äôre merely trying to deflect. Before I can respond, what am I requiring of others that I am not requiring of myself? Why would other people‚Äôs charity absolve me of responsibility? Please clarify so I can understand your argument
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Please stop saying ‚ÄúI‚Äù when referring to my views, I‚Äôm discussing policy not feelings. Your argument it seems is that if the government makes abortion illegal, the government is responsible for supporting all of the children who would have been aborted, correct?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I‚Äôm just making logical statements, removing emotion and personal feelings. What principles are you assuming are valid, and which aren‚Äôt?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Again, please don‚Äôt assume what my viewpoints are
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Ok I‚Äôm glad we can agree on that. But to be fair, you were the one to bring morality by accusing people of not caring about babies older than one year old...
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal If it‚Äôs not enough, then there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from campaigning for more charitable support. But there is a very distinct difference between charity and forced government support
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal If they choose to donate to charities, which many people do, then that is a personal choice
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal So where do you draw the line on what counts as adequate support? You are refusing to see my main point - it is reasonable for people to hold pro-life views and not be FORCED to be responsible for those lives
@CarlAntoine @TopTSlo @Partisangirl ...yes I agree...it‚Äôs awful when children are harmed, as they are innocent in conflict. However, context is important, #Hamas fire rockets from civilian areas, endangering their own people, and I believe we should care about all civilians, not just one side or the other
@igybundy @Partisangirl I don‚Äôt really understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. I believe that civilian endangerment and hurt on both sides is awful, but you can‚Äôt justify violence against one set of civilians while condoning violence against another set.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal To make an over exaggerated similee, I can not want someone to be evicted from their home, while also not seeing it as everyone‚Äôs responsibility to pay their rent. I can make personal choices through charity, but that‚Äôs a choice, not government forced.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal You are living with the assumption that the government, and therefore taxpayers, are responsible for people. If you are conservative, you tend to believe that responsibility falls upon individuals, both for themselves and for the lives they are responsible for
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Stop assuming moral superiority and truly read what I‚Äôm writing.
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I agree it‚Äôs a question of logic, and you‚Äôre refusing to see my logical argument. Some would believe that a baby‚Äôs right to life means something regardless of what it has after birth, as a general principle. And again you‚Äôre accusing pro-lifers of not caring about babies
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal This is because Conservative beliefs are founded upon a principle of personal responsibility, and protection of rights to opportunity, not outcome. So pro-lifers believe in the baby‚Äôs right to opportunity, not outcome
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal My argument is to defend #Conservatives as a whole who are often accused of being immoral. It is possible to both want abortion to be illegal AND to be a moral person, AND not believe you should be responsible for the babies who are born as a result
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal People like @emzanotti hold reasonable pro-life views and also raise money to support the lives which exist as a result. Does that not count, in your eyes, as support?
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal Again you‚Äôre following the repeated and irrational assumption that anyone who disagrees with you is morally corrupt, and wants babies to be hungry, homeless, unloved, etc. My personal view of abortion has NO relevance on my point
@TopTSlo @Partisangirl Does that matter? Given there were dozens injured, some severely, and significant damage to homes and property, in guessing more than 0. What would be an acceptable number to land for you? How many people should be hurt for you to care? #Hamas #IsraelUnderAttack
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I‚Äôm commenting on the logical fallacy that‚Äôs used to attack pro-lifers by implying that if you are pro-life, you are a hypocrite if you don‚Äôt then want to support that life
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal I‚Äôm not saying I do or don‚Äôt support
@kathykattenburg @emzanotti @m2mlegal The original tweet was talking about pro-lifers only caring about babies until they‚Äôre born. My tweet suggested that you are allowed to care for the rights of an unborn life AND not be held responsible for that life...don‚Äôt really see how either of these tweets invoke govt.
@VanityByNatureX ‚ÄúNo amount of compromise‚Äù...sounds like it‚Äôs straight from #Hamas‚Äô playbook. Why is IHRA racist? How does it censor free speech? Literally no part of it stops you from criticizing Israel...
@Partisangirl Your version of #Zionism is pretty broad. Pointing out that #corybn, who is apparently a humanitarian, is silent when rockets are fired of civilians, isn‚Äôt a #Zionist statement...it‚Äôs pointing out his hypocrisy.

@AyaIsleemEn Who was a member of the military wing of Hamas, correct?
@AyaIsleemEn As a journalist, I assume you understand that context can make a story. Can you not understand that, while technically true, the first title provides no context regarding the onslaught of #Hamas-fired rockets? It‚Äôs possible to report objectively and still have an opinion.
@Mina_b89 @AlgerianPalest @Laizesfaire @ghalianno @WGazapal That photo is faked, it‚Äôs a copy from Instagram
@realDougBell @palbahaa @RDAhmad1 Calling for mass attack of Israel from surrounding nations...how reasonable. It worked so well in 1947, 1967, 1973, ...
@FreePali1948 You might want peace, but it‚Äôs quite obvious that #Hamas does not. While the government of Gaza has a charter that calls for the destruction of Israel, and the murder of Jews, it‚Äôs hard to argue that they want peace.
@georgegalloway If only the Palestinians who wish to stand up against Hamas and Hezbollah had the same freedom of speech and rights to protest. #FreeGazaFromHamas #Hamas #Hezbollah
@oneforsorrow87 @localshmo @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn You‚Äôre making assumptions about my viewpoint. My comment asks for context. Where‚Äôs your criticism against Hamas firing rockets at Israeli children, or how Hamas treat and abuse their own citizens? You can‚Äôt care for one set of civilians while justifying violence against another.

@oneforsorrow87 @localshmo @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn My original comment was regarding the complete lack of context when talking about "Gaza being under massive attack". You can avoid the conversation by accusing me of spinning lies, but all I'm trying to do is suggest that context explains action.
@oneforsorrow87 @localshmo @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn External control and withdrawal aren't mutually exclusive. Why do you think Israel blockades and controls who goes in and out? If that control went away, would the violence stop? I don't hear you criticizing Egypt for just as strong control along their border...?
@maryismail5 @tonyruther Shooting the messenger implies I'm trying to stop him from speaking. As almost a free-speech absolutist, I am not. However, he broke the law. You care about his rights, but we should also care about the rights of the victims and families, whose trials Robinson jeopardized.

Today, I was called a ‚ÄúZio‚Äù for asking why people don‚Äôt care about innocent civilians, regardless of whether they‚Äôre Israeli or Palestinian... #Israel #Palestine #IsraelUnderAttack #zio #answerthequestion
@AsgharBukhari @haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn Accusing me, both incorrectly and disrespectfully, as a ‚ÄúZio‚Äù doesn‚Äôt answer my question regarding inconsistencies of viewpoint. Do you care about civilians, or only if they‚Äôre not Israeli?
@oneforsorrow87 @haleez1234 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn @AbbyMartin Depending on the context, no. I think the IDF make quite a significant effort to save civilian lives. What I want is consistency. We should show care for the Palestinian civilians who are harmed. Therefore, we should also criticize #Hamas who launch rockets from civilian areas.
@haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn @AbbyMartin So, just to be clear, Hamas firing rockets at Israel civilians is OK because you see their government as the aggressors.
@haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn @AbbyMartin Again, do you define defending your home as firing rockets at civilians? You‚Äôre trying to cloud this very specific case with a larger debate. My issue is with citizens being directly targeted, and misrepresentation by mass media.
@ejectamenta_com @BBCWorld Israel withdrew completely from Gaza in 2005. Even if they were stealing land from Gaza, does that excuse random rocket fire on civilians in Israel?
@haleez1234 @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn 1) what happened before each of those dates? 2) even if you agree that they have a grievance, you‚Äôre saying that excuses random rocket fire into civilian areas? Seems inconsistent to me. You care about the civilians of one side, but not the other?
@ElishaKrauss I‚Äôm glad that news networks choose to follow the dating life of a dictator. Meanwhile nuclear disarmament hasn‚Äôt happened and his people continue to suffer. So let‚Äôs distract people from that! Really bad.
@philhirstgreen @oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn Does that matter? Should Israel wait for someone to be killed before trying to fire at the people launching rockets? How many should die to warrant a response? Just curious where you draw the line.
@WePlainSpoken @JerusalemRescue @benshapiro @BBCWorld The Iron Dome protects from a lot of rockets, and Israel also has warning systems with sirens, phone notifications, and bomb shelters. Surprisingly, they‚Äôre used to this, and so invest to protect against it.
@BBCWorld Perhaps, instead of peddling misleading media, you could suggest what #israel should do when rockets rain down on their citizens? Any suggestions welcome. Just put yourself in the shoes of someone under those rockets, and then decide if you‚Äôd feel the same. #IsraelUnderAttack
@MuhammadSmiry @oneforsorrow87 Your very real suffering is undeniably dreadful. But, perhaps also ask your government #Hamas to stop attacking too...?
@oneforsorrow87 @georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn From Gaza? Does that excuse random rocket fire into Israel? I‚Äôm asking seriously, not to incite anger, what would you want your government to do if rockets were raining down on your families at 4am?
@Americistani @ShadysGirl12 @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld Ah so you can‚Äôt answer my question so you jump to the general and lazy accusation of Israel murdering civilians. Yes, it‚Äôs awful that innocent people get hurt on both sides. What‚Äôs more awful is that #Hamas puts their own people in danger willingly. #IsraelUnderAttack
@Americistani @ShadysGirl12 @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld What...?! Please tell me you‚Äôre not a troll. 1) Iron Dome - google it. 2) because #Hamas fire from areas highly populated with civilians such as schools and hospitals. How would you suggest stopping them?
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld You‚Äôre a wonderful representation of the total ignorance that fuels this entire debate. Israel is condemned for every response. If they fired back after the first rocket you‚Äôd believe the rockets were real? This is beyond ridiculous.
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld Is Newsweek believable enough? Perhaps you can point me to a better source, I‚Äôm afraid I didn‚Äôt go to High School. https://t.co/IHYMEPCUHf
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld Why should that mean it doesn‚Äôt happen all the time? Do you think it was all sunshine and rainbows before the strict control? Or maybe it was unimaginably worse...? You haven‚Äôt answered the question. Why do you doubt that the rockets are being fired?
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld https://t.co/qKJIhqnbRk
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld ...yes...because strictly controlled does not equal perfectly controlled...don‚Äôt really understand what you‚Äôre confused about honestly.
@Americistani @JerusalemRescue @ReaganBattalion @BBCWorld ...yes...because it happens all the time...with weapons provided by Iran...that‚Äôs why the ports and borders are so strictly controlled. #Hamas also use fire-bomb balloons if that‚Äôs suitably low-tech for you? #IsraelUnderAttack
@JerusalemRescue @benshapiro @BBCWorld The news doesn‚Äôt start until #Israel responds. It‚Äôs ridiculous. #IsraelUnderAttack
@Ostrov_A People need to ask themselves what they would do if it was their houses under the rockets. #IsraelUnderAttack #Israel
@georgegalloway @jeremycorbyn And why, exactly, are they under attack?
@benghand I think the true problem is that #Hamas understand and expect a response. Conflict is their key to continued power.
I truly believe that the #Palestinian people want peace. However, it is quite clear that #Hamas do not. #IsraelUnderAttack #Israel
Before criticizing #Israel for firing on rocket-launching targets in #Gaza by #Hamas, try and think of what you would do if the Hamas rockets were raining down on your homes?#IsraelUnderAttack #ceasefire
@Belal_Yaghi Easier to believe that peace is wanted by Hamas when Hamas stops firing rockets indiscriminately into Israel...?
Another misleading title pushing the anti-Israel narrative of aggression. Israel responded against Hamas targets after dozens of rockets were fired at Israel. It‚Äôs possible to report on this objectively. #BBC chooses not to. #IsraelUnderFire #hamas #Israel https://t.co/p2LVG61wUV

@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders Government involvement in the provision of medicine often leads to a reduction in quality with an overall increase in government costs...and since the government doesn‚Äôt pay for anything themselves, this falls on ever-increasing tax incomes. 2/2
@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders This idea that every other nation does necessarily translate. Population size and level of homogeny, tax rates, level of R&amp;D spending, medical needs, and quality of care are examples of such differences. I‚Äôm personally in favor of a system similar to Switzerland. 1/2
@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders I guess this comes down to your definition of ‚Äúgive‚Äù. In my mind, vast taxation for forced wealth distribution to pay for a frankly unaffordable range of services is immoral.
@64BitRatchet @TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders And that‚Äôs the classic response. It‚Äôs not WHAT that is the question. It‚Äôs the often overlooked HOW that is immoral.
@TuomasTahva9en @AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders The new breed of more radical advocates like Bernie and Alexandria are pushing European socialism, which is, in my opinion, rooted in immorality.
@AbdulElSayed @BernieSanders I'm also #DoneWaiting for people to realize that socialism is inherently immoral, but who cares about a proven history of ideologic failure? Maybe THIS time it'll work...?

@jonesjillm @GhostPanther @SarahKSilverman GDP &amp; Employment statistics, for example. It may shock many people that, like ANY political party, there are positives and negatives, and people are more likely to listen if you focus on both. Absolutism doesn‚Äôt tend to bring viewpoints together...it pushes apart.
Absolutist arguments are often ridiculous, particularly when it comes to hugely complex issues. In this case, see how many holes you can spot in this weak argument for completely open borders. #immigration https://t.co/yj2Py8Fuub via @usatoday

Hilarious...maybe it‚Äôs casual comments like this which demonstrate a complete lack of concern or respect which make the Jewish community in the UK so concerned...isn‚Äôt it generally bad to ignore/blame victims...? #LabourAntisemitism #Antisemitism https://t.co/mkvbYBQeYf
@GhostPanther @SarahKSilverman Perhaps when people stop patronizing them, and when people stop ignoring the positives of the Trump Administration and turn down the dial on ridiculous rhetoric?

Pretty hard to make this argument (which on the face of it, is fair) when there is no guarantee of investment in roads, water quality, or schools from either party, or pre-2017 investment to reference.

@eddiemarsan This is the largest problem we face. Moral superiority is assumed by one side, and then they state that if you disagree on any issue, you disagree with all and therefore are a member of the extreme of the opposite ‚Äúside‚Äù. It‚Äôs intellectually lazy, and disgusting.
While rising rent house prices is obviously an issue, forcing the government into the loop will only make things worse. If people can afford a higher rent, prices will go up due to demand.

@Timewalkproject @alanmaddison20 But the issue here is Labour. I promise you that if Theresa May had similar accusations I would be just as vocal. Bringing up other areas such as sexism, while without a doubt important, are not what we are concerned about in this case. Ideally let‚Äôs fix everything!
Excellent article, focusing on the core of the issue that is still being ignored. #LabourAntisemitism #antisemitism #ihra https://t.co/SWwXySqOcv
@Timewalkproject @alanmaddison20 Disagree very strongly that the policies go further in terms of AS, given Corbyn‚Äôs personal affiliations. If you cut parts out, it can‚Äôt go further. However if those accused are dealt with faster, I will be more than supportive. I‚Äôm just not confident. I hope I‚Äôm proven wrong.

@Timewalkproject @alanmaddison20 This so-called test for antisemitic views doesn‚Äôt touch on the core issue: whether the leadership is anti-Semitic, and how we define antisemitism. Anti-semitism exists on both sides of the aisle, always has done. Leadership reaction to accusations of anti-sections is the issue.
@tommy_peto That‚Äôs why the examples listed are almost more important than the definition. You‚Äôre example is an excellent insight into casual racism. Most people who say racist things like that aren‚Äôt intentionally hateful or offensive. It‚Äôs an unintentional ignorance

@coincimental2 @jeremycorbyn Explain why ‚Äú...because the Communists were never anti-Semitic‚Äù means that I think all on the left are communists. The political left contains AS PART of it communists. Communism has a pretty brutal anti-Semitic history. So the left is not free of anti-semitism.
@coincimental2 @jeremycorbyn How is it backtracking to repeat my words? I‚Äôm excited for your history lesson!
@coincimental2 @jeremycorbyn Not at all. Simply providing a counter example to your assertion that no-one on the left is anti-Semitic. Perhaps you need a lesson in logic? Fail to see how you concluded that some communists are anti-Semitic = the left is communist...?
