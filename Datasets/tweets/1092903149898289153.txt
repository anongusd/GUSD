Bullshit
My phone number has changed so my twitter account is vulnerable as to old phone number. said company is exposing my password and personal information and will be in court over it soon. 	I don't like that somebody with my old phone number can possibly reset my password.
It's my property as well as twitters platform. 		My account!!!! 	My property!!!!
Twitter is not helping and has not responded to my numerous requests to help me access my twitter account. 	Both will come to court.
I'm literally not joking around. 	I will sue the company for access to my account. 		I will win
As it is: If the said company refuses to provide my device with access codes to my twitter account then the said company is preventing me from accessing my personal property as per my identity used to start the original account. 		Bottom line: It's still my account
I've requested support from twitter to be refused as evidence in my case. 	Also refused by the Authy application from accessing my twitter account. 		Two counts very public. 		Refusing me access to my own personal account due to refusal of support could get really ugly in court.
I may have to publicly take action against a company refusing to allow me access to my own twitter account. 	I'm going to file a lawsuit.
@TwitterSupport hey I need help and your help page doesn't work.
