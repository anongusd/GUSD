It‚Äôs a story the Democratic National Committee has, until recently, utterly failed to tell.
We‚Äôre on the verge of watching the American people repudiate a sitting president despite a nominally strong economy. That‚Äôs exceedingly rare.
If Democrats end up flipping state houses in places Trump won in 2016, they will have proved themselves capable of winning in the places coastal elites derisively refer to as ‚Äúflyover America.‚Äù You can‚Äôt overstate how big a deal that will be. Here's why:  https://t.co/xdd1X5YtRm

Rahm: "We will start investing in rehabilitating one of the nation‚Äôs most important transit hubs ‚Äì Union Station.‚Äù
"In the second term we will continue to make strategic investments that will stimulate economic growth and new jobs in our neighborhoods.‚Äù
Rahm: "We will build more than three-dozen parks and playgrounds in underserved neighborhoods and at CPS schools that lack them today.‚Äù
"We'll continue to expand @divvybikes ‚Ä¶ expanding access on South &amp; West sides to reach a total of 6,000 bikes by the end of my second term‚Äù
"We will also continue to modernize the CTA‚Äôs bus fleet by adding at least 300 new buses, and rehabbing more than 1,000 others."
‚ÄúWe'll continue modernizing the Red Line from Howard to 95th Street‚Ä¶ creating 5,000 jobs and helping economic growth in those neighborhoods‚Äù
Rahm: "In our fast-changing world, if you‚Äôre not constantly investing in the future, you surely will be stuck in the past."
Rahm: "We‚Äôve added 750 acres of new parkland in our city ‚Ä¶ the equivalent of adding more than two Grant Parks to the Park District‚Äôs system‚Äù
"We‚Äôre more than 90% of the way toward my goal of ensuring every child lives within a 10 minute walk to a park."
Rahm: "We have made building and technology upgrades to 400 schools and installed air conditioning in 140.‚Äù
"We completely rebuilt the Red Line South ‚Ä¶ investing $425 million to shave 20 minutes off the commute from 95th to downtown.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve secured roughly $700 mil from DC to support investments in construction projects‚Äîand Springfield contributed another $1.3 billion‚Äù
"In total, we have invested more than $7 billion over the last 3 years in upgrading our city infrastructure‚Äìcreating more than 30,000 jobs."
"A world class city can't have a 21st century economy without a 21st century foundation. That‚Äôs why we've invested in rail, runways &amp; roads"

Today Rahm announced a plan that will continue work on bringing safety and security to every neighborhood: http://t.co/LfVrIPKuCU
"In a second term, we'll continue to regulate gun sales in the city as well as closely review all applications for concealed carry permits."
Rahm: "We can‚Äôt address Chicago‚Äôs challenge of crime and violence without addressing the flood of illegal guns."
"Fourth, we will look to extend our existing partnerships in preventing youth violence ... expanding summer jobs program to 25,000 by 2018"
Rahm: "Third, we will employ cutting-edge technology to increase the trust between officers and the neighborhood residents they serve."
"Second, we will continue recruiting &amp; training the next generation of police officers, &amp; we‚Äôll start by graduating 350 recruits this year."
"First, we‚Äôll start by launching Operation Impact 2.0." A coordinated crime-reduction strategy.
Smarter community policing, enhanced prevention programs, engaged parents &amp; balanced penalties will guide our strategies over the next years
"While we talk about all of these solutions today, let‚Äôs make no mistake‚Äìthe best crime prevention strategy is a good education &amp; a degree."
Rahm: "We increased our after school programming by 30 percent, and the number of summer jobs by 60% ‚Äì from 14,000 to 22,500."
Rahm: "We took hundreds of police officers from behind the wheel of their squad cars and put them on foot and bike patrol."
"I ran for mayor pledging to revitalize community policing in Chicago. We have taken essential steps in that direction."
‚ÄúIn those areas, shootings are down 33%, murders are down 28%, and overall crime is down 21% since we started in 2013.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile we put more officers on the street, we made sure we were putting them where they were most needed in the areas with highest crime.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt rest until every parent in every part of the city enjoys the same sense of security that others experience &amp; have come to expect.‚Äù
"That‚Äôs certainly good news ... But I will not rest until every resident experiences the safety and security they deserve."
Rahm: "Crime in Chicago is down by 30% over the past four years, and we now have the lowest murder rate in nearly five decades."

"Our goal is for every resident of our city, no matter who they are or where they live, to share in the hope &amp; promise of a brighter future"
Rahm: "For the first time in decades, more people are moving into Chicago than moving out ‚Äì and more companies are calling Chicago home."
"When it comes to economic growth and job creation in Chicago, the picture is much better than it was just four years ago."
Rahm: "We must ensure that here in Chicago, economic growth, jobs, and affordable housing are within reach for every resident."
Rahm: "In 2013 alone, there were five new tech start-ups a week in Chicago. Over the next four years, we will double down on these gains."
"Protecting our environment is not just our responsibility to our children; it‚Äôs also a smart investment in our economic future."
Rahm: "We will continue to grow the clean energy industry in Chicago."
Rahm: "We must be fertile ground for technology start-ups, advanced manufacturing, scientific research and energy and water companies."
"By making these public investments in healthy and thriving neighborhoods, we will continue to attract and develop more anchor institutions"
Rahm: "My goal as Mayor is to ensure that every child lives within 10 minutes of a park. Today, we‚Äôre more than 90% of the way there."
"We will build on this success by bringing at least 5 more grocery stores to food deserts by 2016, bringing 1000 new jobs."
Rahm: "We have brought eight new grocery stores to food deserts, cutting the number of low-income residents who live in food deserts by 40%"
"In my first month, I brought together the CEOs of 6 large grocery store chains to enlist their help in eliminating food deserts in Chicago"
Rahm: "In the past four years, unemployment in the city has fallen by more than a third and 73,000 new jobs have been created in Chicago.
‚ÄúWe needed a plan for growth and new jobs.  That plan had to extend to all parts of the city, and it had to embrace all neighborhoods.‚Äù
Rahm: ‚ÄúFour years ago, Chicago was tottering on the heels of the Great Recession and unemployment was above 12 percent.‚Äù
"It‚Äôs a plan guided by the belief that Chicago‚Äôs success is measured by ... whether our communities are strong and getting stronger."
"Method is a symbol of what‚Äôs happening in neighborhoods across Chicago. It‚Äôs part of a plan that we developed shortly after taking office."
Method's manufacturing plant is the first new factory in Pullman in 30 years‚Äîeventually employing 100, many from the Pullman community.

This morning Rahm outlined his vision to build on the record-setting gains by CPS students over the past four years: http://t.co/uDGRe3ak23
Rahm: ‚ÄúOur children only get one shot at a good education. Our responsibility as adults is to make sure that it counts.‚Äù
‚ÄúNow is not the time to turn back the clock on this progress. Now is not the time to let politics back in and block the path to success.‚Äù
Changing a system that short-changed our students was difficult, but necessary. Every metric shows that we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for the state of Illinois to reorder its priorities and put education first.‚Äù ‚Äî Rahm
Rahm: ‚ÄúOnly Mississippi and Alabama provide a smaller share of education dollars for their students than the state of Illinois.‚Äù
‚ÄúIndependent Schools will have the freedom to innovate around curriculum and instruction [freed from requirements from central office]‚Äù
Rahm: ‚ÄúSchools that have achieved a top-quality designation for three years running will be granted Independent School status.‚Äù
‚ÄúBeginning next school year, we will launch a new designation for schools with strong leaders who consistently show educational excellence.‚Äù
Rahm: ‚ÄúWe are empowering principals with more authority to innovate and help their students achieve academic success.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur plan is to provide high school seniors with even more options to use their last year in high school to prepare for their next step.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve expand high-quality high school options through STEM, IB, selective enrollment schools, military academies and magnet schools.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe will triple the number of full-day pre-K programs‚Äìfrom 100 classrooms today to 300 classrooms by 2019.‚Äù Opportunity for 4,000 more kids.
Rahm: ‚ÄúOver the next four years, we will up the ante on our commitment to early education.‚Äù

Rahm: ‚ÄúWe are focused on helping more Chicago students get to college ‚Äì because, in today‚Äôs world, that‚Äôs the ticket to the middle-class.‚Äù
‚ÄúAn educated workforce is the key to Chicago‚Äôs future. And every challenge the city faces can be addressed in the neighborhood classroom.‚Äù
‚ÄúThese measures are the result of more than 20,000 teachers, 600 principals, &amp; parents who are working every day for our children.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn every metric posted on our civic refrigerator, the arrow is pointing in the right direction.‚Äù ‚Äî Rahm #ThriveChi
Rahm: ‚ÄúTest scores for CPS students have continued to climb to record highs ‚Äì especially in the critical areas of reading and math.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe quality of our schools is rising throughout the city. Nine of the top 25 elementary schools in the state are in Chicago.‚Äù
‚ÄúOn the other end of the spectrum, the number of children starting kindergarten ready to learn has nearly doubled ‚Äì from 25 to 47 percent.‚Äù
Rahm: ‚ÄúThe good news starts with more of our students today graduating from our high schools than ever before.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to post Chicago‚Äôs education report card on our civic refrigerator. It‚Äôs a report card to be proud of, but we have more work to do
Rahm: ‚ÄúMy parents used to post our report cards on the refrigerator, so everyone who came to our house could see how we were doing‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking you to join me in this campaign for Chicago‚Äôs future. With your help and support, we will keep Chicago moving forward together."
"The next 4yrs will determine where Chicago is in 40 yrs, and whether all Chicagoans can share in the bright future we‚Äôre building together‚Äù
"In the old Chicago, we had nearly one high-school dropout for every graduate. In the new Chicago, our graduation rate has set new records."
"There's a real choice: whether we go back to an old Chicago that only worked for some, or keep building a new Chicago that works for all."
‚ÄúWe are all one city ‚Äì from the South Side to the North Side and the West Side to the Lake. Our future depends on moving forward together.‚Äù
Rahm: "I‚Äôm running for another term as mayor because our job is not done." http://t.co/HfuxVt9MsT

Rahm: ‚ÄúWe are striving to make sure that everyone ‚Äì and every neighborhood ‚Äì in Chicago is part of The City That Works.‚Äù
Rahm: "We can‚Äôt afford to allow the cost of college to stand in the way of their dreams ... Their future is Chicago‚Äôs future."

Rahm: "Today, every child in Chicago receives a full-day of kindergarten."
Rahm: "Graduation rates, test scores, and attendance are at record highs and continue to rise.
‚ÄúEarlier this week, we raised the minimum wage to $13/hr. Washington wouldn‚Äôt do it. Springfield couldn‚Äôt do it. But in Chicago, we did it.‚Äù
‚ÄúDuring this campaign, I will spell out my ideas for continuing to move Chicago forward ‚Äì because that‚Äôs what this election is about.‚Äù
‚ÄúIf we are to be the city we want to be and can be, this must change. ‚Äú
