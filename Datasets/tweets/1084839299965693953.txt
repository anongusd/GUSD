@iamcardib Sometimes you have to make a mess to clean things up. 		Ever clean your garage		President Trump is cleaning out a swamp
@SenJeffMerkley How many fingers pointing back at you? Traitor! Anyone that covers for illegals is a traitor
@HeidiEly @Kokomothegreat @nypost How do you know? 	Oh yeah, they tell me they see you doing a group program
I find it interesting that Nasty Nancy and Slimey Schumer are more concerned with the jobs of 2.5% of our country, than the 100% of the population that are vulnerable by open borders. 		Leaving our borders open and unprotected is more important to the demwits. https://t.co/cOfrok8D5J
@coleyworld @liza_melcher I see.. so you support a female that is a proven sexist and obstructionist
@StormResist @lfkraus Not true
@jaketapper @yashar @CNN Good	Idiots like you try to demonize a young man and he remained calm. 		Someone as volatile as you cant do it. 		The boys were in the right. But of course you don't report the truth.
@liza_melcher @krassenstein @frederickhiller @realDonaldTrump Good point

@krassenstein BRIAN... 	There are banks lined up to cover the delayed wages for the federal employees. 		They can borrow 0% for 24 months. 	What better than that? 		Idiots like you keep posting things not true!
@MissNyetTrump I Would Remove Most of Washington DC. They obviously don't work for America or protect it. 		How do we have so many that continues to spend our children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren inheritance?
@Kokomothegreat @nypost Beautiful. Let's encourage smut, perversion, and abuse to fund the border wall. 		BRILLIANT!
@EdKrassen Joe Biden is such a good person to run. He can't keep a secret to save his soul. When He was a Senator, there was no one that divided Republicans and Democrats better than him. Maybe you don't remember. Joe Biden will be trounced. Or should I say Trumped.
@RepSwalwell @CitizenKayS @realDonaldTrump No there is no understandable	Use your brain	Don't be a duckling	Realize that if the democrats would vote for border security, America would be happy. 		WE ARE TIRED OF THIS DOUBLE STANDARD AND NOT KEEPING US SAFE. DO YOU GET IT?
@haleigh_hutch @Kokomothegreat Uh huh
@realTuckFrumper She sure seems dead
I read the tweets from the demwits that have followed Nasty Nancy and Slimey Schumer like ducklings. 		They have nothing but "no." 	They have "no" reasoning	They have "no" evidence	They have "No" conscience	They have "no" brain. 		Very Sad to give this country away. https://t.co/eShRRR5qNZ
If Nasty Nancy and Slimey Schumer ( who once was in favor of border security and now arent) would live up to oath, we would not have a problem with border security and keeping government open. 		And we would not have a problem with the rest of the democrats getting on board. https://t.co/Htx36Aa1fN

@DiegoATLaw Right	They don't	Don't pay for medical	Don't pay for schools	Don't pay housing	Don't pay taxes		Isn't life great!
@SchreiberMedia And my health insurance is 30% higher because of freeloaders. 		Undocumented immigrants do not pay taxes. They don't have a social security card.
@BUSSW My heath insurance is 30% higher because we carry free-loaded		Also, undocumented immigrants don't pay taxes. They don't have a social security number
@wydmindfeersart I'm soo glad we have undocumented immigrants. That way my taxes are higher and I get to pay 30% more for my heath insurance, because we get to carry freeloaders. And NO they don't pay taxes. Undocumented immigrants don't have Social Security number. 		Yippie
@nogmador1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton Not Well	If you think about it, Davey Crockett and his men, basically gave their lives for nothing! Because we do not enforce the laws governing illegal trespassing. I don't think the wall is the only thing we need. There is a lot more involved. But something needs to be done.
@nogmador1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton The numbers I quote have been in the news. Conservative estimates are around 15 million illegal aliens. But they're all so knowledgeable sources that say it's about 30 million.
@nogmador1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton What are we going to do to convince the president that it's okay to allow a free flow of illegal aliens drugs and human trafficking to happen over our borders let alone the fact that we leave it open for terrorists to come through? Only an idiot to think that it's going to work
@nogmador1 @EdKrassen @HillaryClinton You make a good point. However, it isn't working. Estimates now are that there are 30 million illegals in this country. And estimates are that it costs $70,000 per illegal. And we spend a hundred and fifty billion a year dealing with them.		President T is completely out of line
@Brooklynsweet2 @ProudResister This isn't about America anymore. This is about the world and being globally connected. If Trump gets his way America will remain independent and strong. We can't have that
