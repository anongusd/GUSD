No one can deny the gains in women‚Äôs liberation and equality, but in recent decades that can been concurrent in the black community with the rise of mass incarceration with overwhelming ensnared black men, marriage-age black men. https://t.co/2udwtnfNQt
I can‚Äôt be sure, but I know that in polls blk women are just as likely as any other women to want to marry.

I actually think that the black community has adapted in all sorts of ways to mass incarceration that we don‚Äôt think about: rise of girls trips and line dance etc. The community had to learn to travel, dance, etc without a partner. Think about that‚Ä¶
But homophobia was not a significant feature of the black community, above and beyond other communities, until recently. Gay people were always around, and everyone knew it. But when hundreds of thousands of black men where removed from the community, gay anxiety increased https://t.co/GwNlzBP5ZH
There are 1.5 million marriage age blk men missing from the black community, most due to mass incarceration. Black men are demonized to justify this new slavery. Whole communities are sucked dry of fathers/sons/brothers. The shortage heightens sensitivities. Gay becomes a target.
Re our discussion this morning: Not only do I believe that justice (criminal and social) is the biggest issue for many blk people, I believe that mass incarceration has actually supercharge homophobia as queerness became falsely connected to an actual war on blk men.

I‚Äôm saying that Dems/liberals have to stop being blind to the fact that the most solid part of its base doesn‚Äôt always agree with the party line. https://t.co/Tbo12fHFjL
Personal example, although admittedly only one: My mother is the staunchest black southern Democrat. Votes EVERY time, and takes others to vote. I can‚Äôt find a single liberal thing about her. Nebulous views in the fed. But, she simply can‚Äôt get over what she sees as Repub racism.
Paying attention since 1980 also shows that Dems would have been is for continual defeat without black voters, most of whom were more conservative on moral issues. https://t.co/oS9AVr0Ftc
Can you really hate someone and court them at the same time? People have to chose a course. https://t.co/yolfbKKGih

My thread makes clear that the cleavage is on ‚Äúmoral‚Äù issues. Only one of the issues in your series is categorized as a ‚Äúmoral issue‚Äù by Gallup, that on being abortion, and even in that issue blacks and white are roughly tied. https://t.co/H0lD8g7uXZ

Sure, the stats on religiosity are current data, and the only moral metrics with significant change since 2008 is gay marriage. Argue these data all you want, but the numbers are the numbers. https://t.co/6qockxzPFP
If it were, Dems wouldn‚Äôt have the black votes they need to win elections. And this is coming from someone who agrees with you on the sovereignty of the body. https://t.co/DQxisp0R75
Currently, accord to Gallup, 1/2 of blacks are very religious, another 1/3 or moderately religious and on 1/6 are nonreligious. This is compared to 1/3 of whites very religious, a little less that a 1/3 moderately religious and 1/3 nonreligious. https://t.co/JER0jHIhma
The only metric with significant change is gay marriage and gay ‚Äúrelations,‚Äù as Gallop put it, and even those didn‚Äôt change as much in the black community. https://t.co/OdjhIRzGPB
Progressive on some issues, like taxation and role of government. But don‚Äôt insInuate that black people have EVER been anything but conservative on moral issues. https://t.co/C9v2S2O2H4
My great frustration, and irritation, is that liberals don‚Äôt take these conservatives black voters seriously. They are more than happy to have thier votes, but they don‚Äôt respect them. They find their moral positioning backwards and aberrant.
Black people are incredibly religious, so they are just as conservative as Republicans on a number of moral issues.  https://t.co/yFzrP4DPkC
Election session thought: Most Black people ARE NOT liberal. But, they do believe in the power of the federal government, and they absolutely HATE the racism see in the Republican Party. Pols make a mistake when they expect ppl in the Carolinas to respond like those in Conn.

In much the same way that the confederate flag became a white supremacy signalling device, the MAGA hat now serves the same purpose. It is tangentially connected to Trump, but is transcends him also. It‚Äôs a way of cloaking racial hostility in the presentable form of politics.

It is easy to talk tough when the dogs are not at your legs, the fire hose is not spraying in your face and little girls are not being bombed at your church. When you‚Äôre in the battle, you find a path to victory, not just one that will satisfy your ego and thirst for vengeance.
Your ‚Äúright‚Äù is not the focus here. However, I will note that the most radical voices during the Civil Rights Movement were in liberal cities of the north and west and not in the cauldron, on the front lines of the most vicious and violent part of the battle at the time. https://t.co/LSTzU7D3tL
Struck by this MLK passage on facing Bull Connor: ‚ÄúAnd we went before the fire hoses; we had known water. If we were Baptist or some other denominations, we had been immersed. If we were Methodist, and some others, we had been sprinkled, but we knew water. That couldn't stop us.‚Äù https://t.co/XzXwshkmgL
Am always baffled when people portray MLK as weak because he was a pacifist. The nonviolent confrontation of violence takes tremendous courage because you submit yourself defenselessly, and your vulnerability places your life in danger. And yet, he did so without hesitation.
‚ÄúCredit to his race‚Äù is such a loaded term only valid when viewing the world through the ‚Äúwhite gaze,‚Äù as Toni Morrison dubbed it.

When rewriting state constitutions after Reconstruction, these white politicians were not shy about say, on the record, that they were doing so to establish and enshrine white supremacy. So, it seem only proper to call the fruit of their labor what they called the seeds.

Strategically, Corey Booker is doing a very smart and strategic thing - for his presidential campaign! - campaigning for these southern candidates: He gets to introduce himself to Southern primary voters before prez races gets going. https://t.co/0YfYWNYufv

A columnist for a major American newspapers is murdered and dismembered (we still don't know where his body is) at the command of a Saudi prince. The man occupying the American presidency sides with the prince who ordered the murder. Oh, but Benghazi... #WeUsedToHaveACountry https://t.co/UokbUvu4LK
I have long contended that all sexual interactions between the enslaved and their enslavers was rape. These women (and some men) may have even felt affection for their rapists, and vice versa, but consent requires refusal as an option without repercussions. https://t.co/rNtl01nAKE
Also a fun fact: William was living in Alabama when Booker T. Washington founded the Tuskegee Institute. Afterwards, William names one of his sons Booker T.
Other interesting little things William: He first married a woman named Clarissa, but she never appears in the Census records even though there is a house full of kids. Then, when he's about 40, he marries for the second time, to a 20-year-old woman named Bee.
I am strangely proud that my ancestor bought his own freedom, but also incense by the fact that a person should HAVE TO buy their freedom from another person.
The parish record in Louisiana offers two more sentences of info: 	"Paternal ancestor of William said to have saved money for many years to buy his freedom.  A Benjamin Blow, free man of color living in Southampton Co. VA in 1850 has been put forth as an ancestor."
BTW, the 1870 Census, the first one following the Civil War, is the first record many black people have of their families. And even then, there is no mother, father or other family listed. I only know his occupation: Farm laborer.
My great, great grandfather was a man named William Blow, born in 1850,  15 years before the end of the Civil War. He lived in Alabama. The 1870  Census lists him as Mulatto. How? Exactly! Having slave rape in your  lineage is something many black people must reconcile.

As I wrote in my book: ‚ÄúConcealment makes the soul a swamp; confession is how you drain it.‚Äù I thought about my abuse all the time until I disclosed it. Since then I almost never think out it. Testimony is liberty.
And then, the farther you get away from the event, you begin to negotiate with yourself: ‚ÄúThat was X number of years ago. I‚Äôm all grown up and doing well. Discussing it now would be more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.‚Äù And yet, the trauma won‚Äôt accept the terms of your surrender.
Very often with childhood sexual abuse you don‚Äôt tell because you just want it to go away, to burn off like a morning fog. You hope it will. It never does. Instead, it builds in you like a storm, and maybe, one day, come out.

Here is a fascinating @WSJ story about #Kavanaugh‚Äôs relationship to #AffirmativeAction and race. https://t.co/nPP8PZWYla
So, is #Kavanaugh confessing that he believes in affirmative action, at least for women?! Now, how many of his female clerks minorities? Someone on the committee, please ask! This is the very definition of affirmative action! And, Hatch is PRAISING him for it.

Protesting is good. It has a galvanizing, energizing, motivational component. But, the greatest expression of both personal &amp; collective civic power will always be the vote.

I disagree. I think they like him because they believe he hates the same people they hate. That allows them to forgive many things.

Let me be blunt: I don‚Äôt know how a single, never-married man wins the votes of older, soc conservative, deeply religious black women in the south during the Dem primaries or most people during the general. We‚Äôve never elect a single prez who wasn‚Äôt a widow. First time? Maybe‚Ä¶ https://t.co/amimyK7g8k

I could be completely wrong about this, it‚Äôs extremely early after all, but I don‚Äôt see it for Kamala or Corry at this point. This could clearly change. https://t.co/JAanzdIRSa
I hate the superdelegates. And, if they are going to have them, they should be able to signal their preference until AFTER their state‚Äôs primary. As it stands, the establishment signals its preference before a signal vote is cast. https://t.co/1LznZWpXaX
Another falsehood. For over a decade blacks have been leaving the urban north and west and moving BACK to the south. You really don‚Äôt understand black life in the south at all, do you? https://t.co/OV0m3TF1G0
People have been polled for decades. This is DATA. No group of human beings is monolithic, but there is clear proof of majority leanings. https://t.co/yGNlGHbOUc
May be, but try going to the south and telling those older black women who ALWATS vote that their religion is promblematic. Political suicide‚Ä¶ https://t.co/zUrqVNPxo1
Very powerful in winning the Dem nomination; not at all powerful for Dems to win the general. That‚Äôs the paradox. https://t.co/lctphGnGoW
I think that people will be surprised by the support Landrieu has if he throws his hat in the ring. A southern with tremendous name recognition in the region. Disclosure, I‚Äôm from Louisiana and Mitch is a friend. Would be complicated for me to write about. https://t.co/gq3oB77CB2
Southern blacks, almost all Dem, are as conservative as (and in some cases MORE conservative than) Republicans on social issues. Also, EXTREMELY religious. The cleaving point is racism. That mean the most liberal candidate for them may not be the most attractive. https://t.co/1W7YSlyidz
Let me add this to the discussion: Most of the talked-about Dem contenders for 2020 are coastal north and west. Many tilting more progressive than the past. But to win nom you have to win the frontloaded, largely black primaries in the South where Dems are relatively conservative

Following this logic, for white privilege to exist every white personal must be privileged over every nonehite one. And therefore, every example of nonwhite success and excellence disproves the rule. That‚Äôs just dumb.
It‚Äôs not about personal anecdote either. It‚Äôs about what the data say in the aggregate. I‚Äôve worn tired and bored by ppl using their personal story in a futile effort to disprove reams of data.
Let me correct folks abt white privilege: It‚Äôs not measured by the absence of struggle among white people. Some white people struggle too, obviously. But privilege is measured by whether people born into sim circumstances, with sim talents and sim work ethic have sim chances.

Stop getting caught up in arguments with people who resist all gun control measures. That‚Äôs a trap. We need fewer guns in circulation, period, particularly weapons of war. We need to elect politicians with that vision and let them hammer out the details.

Sure they could share, but not all federal crimes are state crimes. If state crimes were uncovered, they could be prosecuted and they would not be open to pardon. https://t.co/mSoBxQLuZh
Clinton‚Äôs articles of impeachment included perjury and obstruction of justice. If Trump were to be impeach I‚Äôd bet his articles would include similar charges. https://t.co/UiB7kkOL3N
Wrong. Those are still federal prosecutors who can only charge federal crimes, all of which are pardonable by the president. A state could file charges, but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening with the SDNY. https://t.co/rcnTkbiCVX
Now you are talking about impeachment as it is: As a political exercise. Impeachment itself could be likely, removal is not likely. As this carries political risk for the party that initiates the action. Clinton‚Äôs approval hit a record high DURING impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/FCVNzPnVcb

Impeachment doesn‚Äôt remove a president. He has to be removed by 2/3 of the Senate. Highly unlikely. But yes, if that happened he would be vulnerable to prosecution. https://t.co/4HxOibjbHj
Anything is possible after office (another reason to vote him out in 2020) but HIGHLY unlikely he would/could go to prison while in office. https://t.co/af7XUq9QhO
No one above the law is right, but the law itself exempts the president for certain jeopardies and grant him the ability to pardon others from same. Part of what protects Trump IS the law. Impeachment/removal are largely political exercises. https://t.co/rlrOnB1peU

No one knows what Mueller has or will have. It could be about Trump or those around him or both. Also, no one knows when the investigation will conclude. Don‚Äôt wait for that. You have no control over it. Do what you can control dealing with the situation at hand.
I see wishful thinking not as a motivator but as a distraction from the real possibilities of real and SUBSTANTIAL gains liberals could make in ‚Äò18 and ‚Äò20.
I‚Äôve been saddened this morning to realize that so many people have placed their hopes in unlikely - and in some cases outlandish scenarios that would remove Trump from office.
There is a basic math to removing Trump from office that is VERY hard to overcome. Removal would require a 2/3 vote in the Senate, and it‚Äôs hard for me to see that happening.

Impeachment by the House and conviction(and therefore removal) by the Senate are political decisions. They are based on law, but they are political. I simply can‚Äôt imagine 2/3 of the Senate voting for removal under anything but the most extreme circumstances. Lying won‚Äôt cut it.
