@scotte_allen @JimPressOffice Where IS he anyway? No parades, no door to door talking with D5, no festivals, nothing.  just sitting back and collecting $$$ from tons of out of state PACs.  I looked at the filings, and a shockingly few donations were from D5 individuals. @wispolitics
@scotte_allen @JimPressOffice He holds meetings, and I have been to several. They are not sit down chats with Jim.  Even at the ones without people yelling, he tells long-winded history lessons on just about every question, and doesn't really listen to what the people are asking.  Very disconnected from D5.

@lmm527 @Vipond4Congress @Elect_Correct @USTermLimits @tomforwi Lea - When the pro-life groups mail candidates questionnaires in order to label them "100% pro-life" one of the questions is about contraceptives.  If a candidate is ok with the use of condoms and birth control pills, they are bashed by the far right for not being "100% pro-life"
