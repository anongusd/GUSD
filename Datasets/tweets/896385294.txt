@FareedZakaria @madeleine 2/2 to See Mr Powell talk about people use to want to come the US.. People will always come to the US..but President TRUMP wants legal immigration.  Would Mr Powell allow a stranger to move into his home, bring all of their family and friends and demand he be supported

2/2  McCain tried to take down a sitting president not with direct evidence did not got to Congress with true evidence  but leaked false evidence paid for  opposition party and leaked it to the press.Yet McCain was an honorable man , Benedict Arnold considered himself a patriot
1/2 This just a paraphrase..Mark Anthony burial speech to Julius McCain.. I come not to bury McCain but to praise him..was he not an honorable man..did he not serve this nation with honor..or did he not treat his ex wife who was crippled and deformed before divorcing her

@klhunz2020 @dgaliger2 thank god
Sen John McCain in his final message to the nation did not take his own advise and put aside  differences and for sake of the nation heal the wounds between himself and TRUMP. Rather McCain took to his grave a final legacy of separation and personal pettyness.

@Ocasio2018 Socialiam doesnt work.. Because it isn’t a free market the prices that doctors charge don’t rise and you end up having very cheap or free medical service but only for those who can get it. In other words, preferential people get to the front of the line.
@SiddonsDan @dbongino The reason people are willing to spend 12 years in extra schooling or so to become doctors is because the reward is very high. When this reward is taken away you end up with a shortage of doctors because fewer people are willing to do it.
MarginalCost77		•		247d		As someone who studies economics, it comes down to an issue of incentives. Socialism doesn’t really allow for anyone to excel and so people don’t try as hard.

Bourdain needed an intervention and his employers @ Cnn did nothing.
"I was a heroin addict,.., and I was a cocaine addict, for sure," he told People. "I never stopped drinking, even after."He continued: ", I was definitely drinking too much .. alcohol was around me at all times and you were to give you alcohol for free
