@CBHessick @shipwreckedcrew @Popehat I‚Äôm just upset why all the uproar from the right and from all these congressmen when this happens every day to every day people. Ones that can‚Äôt afford million dollar attorneys. So sad how laws benefits certain groups of people over others. We are not all created equal.
@CBHessick @shipwreckedcrew @Popehat That maybe the intent. But there are so many overzealous prosecutors that try their will just to get any damaging statement against someone. I‚Äôve seen so many cases of it unfortunately. Where people have told them repeatedly they don‚Äôt know anything but they still force it. Sad
@CBHessick @shipwreckedcrew @Popehat The rich are getting he poor man‚Äôs treatment.  The treatment of the black and brown and all the sudden it‚Äôs unconstitutional. It‚Äôs unjust. There are millions of people incarcerated now and some pending charges based off these claims. The rich don‚Äôt like it when it happens to them
@CBHessick @shipwreckedcrew @Popehat The government does this all the time with drug related charges and get a bunch of lying ‚Äúsnitches‚Äù to testify false statements. Sometimes people lie Bc they‚Äôre scared and threatened so much by the government. I guess my point is we need prosecutorial reform.
@CBHessick @shipwreckedcrew @Popehat Carissa I agree with you! What I don‚Äôt get is why does the government get to witness tamper and threaten witnesses with more charges but the other party is not even able to talk to a witness? I‚Äôm not a stone fan at all but the laws are corrupt.

@JoshuaBHoe I‚Äôm curious If he‚Äôs going to push for more reform as president. I agree with you that I don‚Äôt trust prosecutors. He‚Äôs a lawyer but not a career prosecutor.
@JoshuaBHoe True. But I think where they held out they sorta forced the additions to be added on there for others at the house to approve.
@JoshuaBHoe You‚Äôre right. He didn‚Äôt jump on board until the sentencing reform aspect was added Bc he felt like it didn‚Äôt do enough. Once it was added he co sponsored it. Honestly I‚Äôm glad they held out and pushed for the sentencing reform Bc if not we wouldn‚Äôt have got it.
@ACLU U know why? Bc they packed the Supreme Court with with conservative judges. Now they can overturn roe vs wade

In other words they have an ego. They don‚Äôt like to admit when they‚Äôre wrong. Especially the BOP. They know what the intent was.

@JoshuaBHoe @esanchez031 @Vi3tRevenant @KevinARing @FAMMFoundation @cut_50 @PrisonFed @BackParole @shonhopwood @VanJones68 @JessyMichele Absolutely! And call them for this fix!

@JoshuaBHoe @esanchez031 @AmesCG @Vi3tRevenant @KevinARing @FAMMFoundation @cut_50 @PrisonFed @BackParole @shonhopwood @VanJones68 @JessyMichele But josh.

How can the bop get into the judges mind and know his intent?

@esanchez031 @Vi3tRevenant @KevinARing @FAMMFoundation @cut_50 @PrisonFed @BackParole @shonhopwood @VanJones68 @JessyMichele @JoshuaBHoe I certainly hope so! That was the intent. I would really encourage listening to that podcast 41. It discusses this in great detail. Both @KevinARing and @AmesCG discuss it. What‚Äôs sad is families are suffering Bc of an error. The bop knows the Intent but they‚Äôre choosing 2 ignore
@esanchez031 @Vi3tRevenant @KevinARing @FAMMFoundation @cut_50 @PrisonFed @BackParole @shonhopwood @VanJones68 @JessyMichele @JoshuaBHoe You‚Äôre right. But they fought like hell and did everything in their power to stop the bill from going thru. Don‚Äôt forget cotton was the one that convinced trump to not bring up the bill up before the elections. Cotton needs to get voted out of Arkansas. And Kennedy from Louisiana
@MeekMill And the system would have the cops back the entire way with an acquittal. Will say the cop ‚Äúfeared‚Äù for his life. Well if you‚Äôre so scared why even be a cop? Some are just trigger happy.
@esanchez031 @Vi3tRevenant @KevinARing @FAMMFoundation @cut_50 @PrisonFed @BackParole @shonhopwood @VanJones68 @JessyMichele It‚Äôs either an administrative fix or have congress fix it.

@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Republicans won‚Äôt let that happen Bc it helps them every time.
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Electoral college should be abolished
@CanadianDev @CaliFarmer2 @DrDenaGrayson Listen I hope you‚Äôre both right. All I‚Äôm saying is if they haven‚Äôt done anything yet with all those indictments. When will they? They convict suspected drug dealers on less based on he said she said. I‚Äôm just over this whole collusion conspiracy and want something done now!
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson The same polls that said trump was losing and Hillary was winning?
@CaliFarmer2 @CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson I just don‚Äôt have faith in republicans. And the Dems are not backboned enough to do something about it. Nancy said she wants no talks of impeachment until the mueller report. But what‚Äôs going to happen then if republicans aren‚Äôt on board? We need to get rid of that sen majority
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson I hope so! I still believe he can shoot someone in the face in the middle of 5th ave and nothing will happen to him. You‚Äôre giving his base too much credit. You know most republicans are dumb. Ok maybe that was mean but it‚Äôs true
@CaliFarmer2 @CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson If Barr is the confirmed AG nothing is going to happen to him. Any non dem AG would not indictment period. He nominates them. And a prerequisite is you can‚Äôt indict me or my kids. And you have to approve my pardon
@CaliFarmer2 @CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Lindsay Graham is a puppet. He‚Äôll do anything trump says. He wouldn‚Äôt want to lose his South Carolina seat. Racism is in full effect
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson If he resigns it will be on the last day of his office. If he wins 2020 then he‚Äôll resign on the last day Jan 19 2025
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Trump is truly their cult leader. And republicans see him doing no wrong. They let him separate babies from their mothers. And they‚Äôre ok with that. These are the same pro life evangelical people! I just don‚Äôt get it. Racism reigns
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Plus republicans like him Bc he gets to push their policies and he gets to take the blame for it not them. Like the tax cuts and all.
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs going to happen. A lot of the Republican elected officials would lose their seats. Trumps base is super hard and will vote their elected officials out if they support anyone but him.
@CanadianDev @CaliFarmer2 @DrDenaGrayson Exactly. And I really don‚Äôt have much hope in Congress. Our only hope maybe ny state charges. The only thing I‚Äôm scared of if Congress Intervenes to avoid a national embarrassment worldwide.
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson The only way i would see him doing that is on the last day of his presidency in an agreement with pence to pardon him and the entire family. But realize their legal team is telling them if you resign. Yes pence can pardon you. But you won‚Äôt escape ny state charges.
@CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Agreed. But trumps ego is on a whooollleed different level than Nixon‚Äôs! I‚Äôm sorry but Nixon as terrible as he was still wouldn‚Äôt do or say half the stuff trump says in public. At least Nixon would talk shit behind your back. Trump gives zero fucks
@CaliFarmer2 @CanadianDev @DrDenaGrayson Yes he does!

@Vandunk70 You got that right! I‚Äôm pleased of the first step act passage. But there needs to be sooooo much more! Death penalty is immoral. It‚Äôs murder. It should not be acceptable at all.

@Vandunk70 Especially in fed court. At least in va state court judges can suspend sentences etc. in federal NOPE! They even impose mandatory sentences that judges can‚Äôt deviate from! Or career offender guidelines. So what‚Äôs the point of having a judge if the prosecutor dictates everything
@Vandunk70 Amen to that! Preach sister preach! üôå that is a üíØ% fact! Prosecutors have allll the power. Power is even stripped from the judge and given to the prosecutor. They‚Äôre more powerful than the judges!
@DrDenaGrayson As much as I hate to say it. He‚Äôs right. McConnell won‚Äôt even bring a bill like that to the senate floor. So we‚Äôll be stuck with him until he‚Äôs voted out of office.
@Vandunk70 Then those same prosecutors then become judges! It‚Äôs like a vicious cycle! We can‚Äôt ever get anyone actually ‚Äúfor the people‚Äù. It‚Äôs all about their conviction rate and sticking a crime on somebody so the case can close.
@Vandunk70 We need to stop voting for them. They speak good and sound good Bc they‚Äôre political actors. Law school is an acting school. Some use it for good and some use it for bad. Unfortunately prosecutors use it to hurt others. And lose no sleep at night in doing so
@Vandunk70 But look who writes the laws. A bunch of prosecutors elected to political office. An office of power. So they write laws that would help them at their jobs when they retire congress. Or for their buddies still in the business.
@Vandunk70 Me too. But instead he ended up being Larry the cable guy ... üôÑ
@Vandunk70 Maybe if they get locked up and their rights get taken away from them. Then they‚Äôll stop. Not just getting disbarred. But locked up. Like they do to others. Problem is none of their friend want to prosecute them. There should be an independent panel that does that.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner Fights New Mumia Abu-Jamal Appeal | NBC 10 Philadelphia https://t.co/nCbwNt2r15
@Vandunk70 Tell me about it. Even Larry in Philly. Hard core fan of his too. He just appealed a judges order to over throw a conviction of 64-year-old activist serving life without parole after his death sentence was thrown out over flawed jury instructions
@Vandunk70 ü•öZackly! Can‚Äôt support that at all! Especially when you know people that‚Äôs been victim of prosecutorial misconduct and police misconduct. We can‚Äôt reward that. Bc they‚Äôll just keep doing it as long as they get away with it.
@Vandunk70 She‚Äôs a prosecutor. You know how they put up acts in court. Straight lies.
@Vandunk70 Yea I was a die hard fan of hers until I seen her prosecutorial record. Was a road kill for me. Can‚Äôt support that at all. Misconduct should not be awarded. Violating judges orders to let people out of jail should not be awarded the list goes on.

@JoshuaBHoe @RodneyDBarnes63 @PlattRobers @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq Public defenders in my eyes deserve the most credit in the judicial system. They work tirelessly for pennies on what they can make in private practice. Why? Because they love helping people. And not in it for the money. Not saying there‚Äôs anything wrong with wanting money.

@PlattRobers @JoshuaBHoe @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq Not rehabilitation of the incarcerated. Not to reduce recidivism. Not provide the right tools and education to better themselves and contribute to society. But one team one mission. I think they need another mission statement.
@JoshuaBHoe @PlattRobers @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq Very true. No checks and balances and no accountability for their actions. They will cover for each other at any extent. Once a blue moon you‚Äôll get a whistleblower. And they get banned from ever working there again.
@JoshuaBHoe @PlattRobers @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq Not at all josh. Not at all. They think all criminals are murderers instead of looking at the incarcerated individuals as people.
@JoshuaBHoe @PlattRobers @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq A lot of them were bullied or were bullies themselves. And they feel like they‚Äôre getting get back. And they put prisons in low income poverty places where the workers have no education and the only economy there is the prison system.
@PlattRobers @JoshuaBHoe @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq I agree with the both of you. But I guarantee you if someone was coming into the system with a sentence the BOP wouldn‚Äôt have any issues calculating that long sentence! And most of the time wrongly calculated and they won‚Äôt even change it. They read the orders wrong most of time
@JoshuaBHoe @PlattRobers @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq They really do! It‚Äôs like they think your subhuman. Like you don‚Äôt even deserve to live. And they think they have the God given right to treat you like trash. And that they‚Äôre commissioned to carry out those disgusting ways. I don‚Äôt see how they sleep at night.
@JoshuaBHoe @PlattRobers @Vi3tRevenant @SLandP @JessyMichele @DSafavianEsq Something so simple yet so hard to achieve ... people that have authority by nature make it harder for others.

@JoshuaBHoe @KamalaHarris üíØ% facts!
@JoshuaBHoe @KamalaHarris I also believe police and prosecutorial misconduct has to be addressed head on. Even If you believe a person is guilty no one should resort to such actions. That diminishes any trust in the system. Which already has no trust at all. At least I don‚Äôt trust the system.
@JoshuaBHoe @KamalaHarris True. And the covering up of prosecutorial and police misconduct really scares me. Terrifies me actually. Bc that‚Äôs basically saying I know you‚Äôre more than likely innocent but I still want this conviction. I wish Larry the new DA from philly runs.
@JoshuaBHoe @senate4cjreform @KamalaHarris Yea! That‚Äôs true too! Very good point! I just hope we don‚Äôt have so much internal fighting where trump ends up using that same ammo towards the dem nominee. Like 2016 2.0. Bernie and his Hillary email allegations.
@JoshuaBHoe @senate4cjreform @KamalaHarris I think a lot will drop out early on once they see momentum shifting to other candidates
@JoshuaBHoe @KamalaHarris Very much so... you know she was the first person I listened to speak of nail bond reform and how she wants to get rid of it altogether. I thought wow this lady is good!

@iamfayekinnit @JoshuaBHoe Me neither. That‚Äôs being devious. At least Gillibrand said I admit i was wrong in the past. Kamala is flat out taking up for her past. Covering up for it like it didn‚Äôt happen or she wasn‚Äôt aware of it. ü§î

@brianschatz If your own minority leader @SenSchumer is ok with it and even asked are you gonna do it. Then one would assume it‚Äôs senatorial.
@brianschatz Then retweet the cardi b video. How about this. You get all the Democrats in Congress (both chambers) to retweet it so not one of you solely gets in the hot seat. If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre fearing. Is backlash.

@JoshuaBHoe @CandiedSquid Damage and torture is an understatement.. and not just for the loved ones in there. But for the family and friends out here too. It takes a toll on everyone. Damage and torture for everyone.
@CandiedSquid @JoshuaBHoe You‚Äôre absolutely correct and I see your point. Unfortunately not all think that way. We live in a world where you‚Äôre guilty until proven innocent. That‚Äôs sad coming from the best country of all. We‚Äôre all humans. Sad when animals have more rights than humans
@CandiedSquid @JoshuaBHoe And respect. My point was to raise the issue that believe it or not some are truly innocent and don‚Äôt deserve to be in there. What kills me is the point of incarceration is rehabilitation. If people don‚Äôt get rehabilitated how can we expect them not 2 go back
@CandiedSquid @JoshuaBHoe Agree completely. Unfortunately others don‚Äôt feel the same. So you have to bring it to their attention not everyone is an ‚Äúanimal‚Äù as seen in their eyes. Although none of them are animals. All are humans who should be treated with dignity and care.

@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley at least state level they have more discretion. They have the authority to suspend sentences etc. Good luck in the federal system.
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley Exactly. Forcing people into plea deals and punishing them for exercising their right to a trial. The prosecutors are very much overzealous. Not after justice but a conviction rate. Especially in the federal system.
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley It‚Äôs sad to know we live in the land of the free. Where our forefathers escaped persecution. But yet we have more people incarcerated in this country than in China or India combined. All lead by prison industry greed. Making millions off low income people
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley I was blinded to our justice system about 10 years ago. Until I had close friends impacted by the criminal justice system. I started researching and investigating and the stories I‚Äôve seen and heard have been appalling.
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏ècoincidence maybe ... but I don‚Äôt believe in coincidences üòâ(sometimes)
@AmesCG @JoshuaBHoe @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley Ames I‚Äôm really glad people really rallied for sentencing reform. Don‚Äôt think we would have it without the resistance. We all really appreciate all the hard work and dedication. It is a fact. CJR starts with sentencing reform.
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley Exactly! We‚Äôre üëÅ to üëÅ
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley Hey we thought the first step act was a dream. And a dream come true! Especially with a Republican White House and Congress
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley Bring in 60/40 and parole back
@JoshuaBHoe @AmesCG @shonhopwood @JessyMichele @pye @ChuckGrassley Sooo true. This is a first step and God knows soooo much more needs to be added! Like eliminating mandatory mins and career offender altogether.

@JoshuaBHoe @EricHolder @KamalaHarris Perfectly said! ‚ù§Ô∏è
@JoshuaBHoe @EricHolder @KamalaHarris Yes we do! We need to fight together and not one another. We need prosecutorial reform big time. Should be on the top of the agenda
@JoshuaBHoe @EricHolder @KamalaHarris Like Hillary and bill clinton with the 94 crime bill. They tried to redeem themselves at the end but so much damage was already done. The war on drugs is and was a failing war
@JoshuaBHoe @EricHolder @KamalaHarris I noticed that too! Bc they both thought it wouldn‚Äôt do enough
@JoshuaBHoe @EricHolder @KamalaHarris I agree and see your point as well. They‚Äôre prosecutors so they know the lengths prosecutors go. And now they‚Äôre somewhat trying to redeem themselves.
@JoshuaBHoe @EricHolder Yes that‚Äôs why I really back @EricHolder and @KamalaHarris for 2020. Bc they‚Äôve been there. @KamalaHarris is fighting for bail/bond reform too! No reason people are still in jail simply Bc can‚Äôt afford to get out. While the rich get out Bc they can afford to
@JoshuaBHoe Very counterproductive but yet we have the feb 2017 Sessions memo instructing prosecutors to seek harshest sentences. Reversed everything @EricHolder implemented.. and now Sessions is gone they‚Äôre still following his memo! Everyone is getting 851 enhancements
@JoshuaBHoe A-freaking-men! That‚Äôs some of the biggest reform needed! These draconian laws and the ways prosecutors use and abuse them is the worst! Worst for humanity/society/economy and our standing in the world. No reason why we lock up so many people decades/life

@JoshuaBHoe Yes totally agree! We need to remove mandatory mins altogether. They‚Äôre just so unethical and they tear families apart. It‚Äôs why a lot of people have life sentences. The prosecutors use it as a tool to make people plea and punish those that want a fair trial
@JoshuaBHoe I wish the mandatory min was retroactive Bc a lot of people have those enhancements on there that prevents them from coming home. But something is better than nothing. First step. Once signed into law. Off to the second step!!

@ImranShahbazChi @shonhopwood The house version didn‚Äôt have any sentencing reform. And for it to be signed to law both senate and house versions have to be the same. Grassley rightly stated to the house if it didn‚Äôt have sentencing reform he wasn‚Äôt going to touch it.
