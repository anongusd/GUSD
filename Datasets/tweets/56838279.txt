This concludes our live coverage of select comments from DNI Clapper's remarks at the #Intelligence2015 AFCEA/INSA summit.
Spoiler alert: We're not comic book characters.¬†We're Americans working to protect our nation while living up to our nation's values.
DNI Clapper: ..Because we're in a challenging business at a difficult time.
DNI Clapper: Going forward we're going to have to be more transparent in talking about hard decisions, difficult choices.
DNI Clapper: Those are things the Intelligence Community has done that I'm very proud of. Easy decisons.  Easy commitments to make.
"We've also used imagery to help people in need" from Hurricane Katrina, to controlling Ebola to supporting Nepal's earthquake recovery.
In 2014 we helped make a public case against Russia for obfuscating what happened Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.
DNI Clapper: In 2013 we showed how Syria had used chemical weapons on its own people.
DNI Clapper: Of course, transparency can help us with our mission too - particularly when we're able to use imagery publicly.
"Bin Laden's Bookshelf" gave us about as much traffic in 2 days as our website received in 2013 and 2014 combined: http://t.co/HWzltsSK6W
Transparency is why this summer we published a huge tranche of documents collected during the 2012 Abbottabad raid.
Transparency is a big reason why this spring we sent out @ODNI_NIC to the #SXSW Festival to discuss the next Global Trends #GT2035.
Transparency is why we - as an IC - have published so many significant documents via our @icontherecord @tumblr site: http://t.co/lZTSciHcsB
We're also increasingly reaching out to the American public because we're trying to help them understand what we do in their name.
DNI Clapper: And if someone comes across something she thinks we're doing wrong we have lots of avenues to report that activity.
If a member of the IC comes across info he thinks should be made public we have a process in place to review it for declassification.
And we stood up an IC Transparency Working Group with senior representatives from all over the IC to transform those principles into action.
DNI Clapper: This past February we published the "Principles of Intelligence Transparency: http://t.co/0dHOoagneV
DNI Clapper:¬†We have to be more transparent. The American public expects us to talk about how we're using the power of US Intel responsibly.
DNI Clapper: Intelligence is a powerful and essential tool for national security and with great power comes great responsibility.

The @BrookingsInst event moves to Q&amp;A with @cam_kerry taking audience questions for #ODNI GC Robert Litt. http://t.co/1K0r2g54Cw
Litt: The new protections demonstrate our nation's  enduring commitment the personal privacy and human dignity of citizens of all countries
Litt: In short..we have instituted express and transparent (IC) requirements to take account of the privacy of people outside our nation..
Litt: These rules are incorporated into the agency procedures that we released yesterday, and into another publicly IC Directive 203..
PPD-28 limits retention and dissemination of personal info of non-US persons collected by signals intelligence comparable to US persons.
However the President recognized that we need to do more to treat ‚Äúall persons..with dignity and respect regardless of their nationality"
Litt: it is not true that " that the Intelligence Community had a sort of ‚Äúopen season‚Äù to spy on foreigners around the world"
Litt:  we often hear...our rules are focused on protecting Americans, and  we ignore legitimate privacy interests of others around the world
#ODNI General Counsel Robert Litt speaking live @BrookingsInst on intelligence surveillance reform. http://t.co/H7UdWjlTiP
Litt: The processes put in place by PPD-28, which are described in the report we issued yesterday, have further strengthened this oversight
Litt:  IC activities are focused on priorities set by policymakers, through a process that involves input from across the government..
Litt:  the Intelligence Community does not decide on its own which conversations to listen to, nor does it try to collect everything.
One persistent but mistaken charge.. has been that our signals intelligence activity.. is not adequately overseen and is subject to abuse
Litt: As we have been able to release more info, it has helped allay some of the mistaken impressions people have had about our activities.
Transparency: is something I care about deeply and.. our commitment to transparency.. enables me to explain the other changes we have made.
Litt: And yesterday the ODNI released a report detailing the concrete steps we have taken so far.. that implement some of those reforms
Litt: In particular, we have a robust ongoing dialogue with our European allies and partners about privacy and data protection.
Litt: The Intelligence Community has spent the year since the President‚Äôs speech implementing the reforms he set out..
Litt:  just over a year ago, President Obama gave a speech about surveillance reform, and issued Presidential Policy Directive 28.

The 6 ‚Äúenterprise objectives‚Äù are 1) mission mgmnt 2) enterprise mgmnt 3) info sharing and safeguarding; 4) innovation 5) people 6) partners
The 7 ‚Äúmission objectives‚Äù are: 1) strategic intel 2) anticipatory intel 3) current ops; 4) cyber intel 5) CT 6) Counterproliferation 7) CI
...what the IC intends to accomplish (mission objectives) and how the IC will accomplish them (enterprise objectives).
NIS: The National Intelligence Strategy identifies and explains the IC‚Äôs objectives...
Clapper: The result of that perfect storm is that we-as a nation-are taking more risk.
4) increasingly constrained budget resources.
3) the conscious decision to stop collecting on specific targets
2) the resulting damaged relationships with foreign and corporate stakeholders
Clapper: facing ‚Äúa perfect storm‚Äù of factors that.. degrade IC capabilities including 1) leaks resulting in loss of collection capabilities
NIS: The constant advancements and globalization of technology will bring both benefits and challenges
NIS: Competition for resources such as food, water, climate, energy is a growing intelligence issue as competition increases instability
NIS: New alignments and informal networks-outside of traditional power blocs / national governments will  have significant impact
NIS: Key nation states: China, Russia, N Korea and Iran will continue to challenge U.S. interests, global power becoming more diffuse.
Clapper: I‚Äôve often said publicly that the U.S. is facing the most diverse set of threats I‚Äôve seen in my 50 years in the intel business.
The National Intelligence Strategy lays out the strategic environment and identifies pervasive and emerging threats.
.. we can continue the crucial work ...while we also increase transparency and protect privacy and civil liberties.
Clapper: Each of these seven principles has been a part of the IC I‚Äôve known for 50 years. If we keep these in front of us...
The IC Principles of Professional Ethics: Mission, Truth, Lawfulness, Integrity, Stewardship, Excellence, Diversity: http://t.co/2CXKOKM9Jn
Clapper: First and foremost, the 2014 National Intelligence Strategy opens with our 7 Principles of Professional Ethics.
Our oversight committees, our partners, the public...even our adversaries are all seeing the same strategic direction I‚Äôm giving to the IC.
There‚Äôs no SECRET version of the NIS... If we are going to profess transparency we need to practice transparency whenever we can.
Clapper: Intelligence integration is a journey, not an end state and the NIS is another way to promote integration in the IC‚Ä¶
Following are highlights from DNI Clapper‚Äôs remarks this morning at the @AFCEA / @INSAlliance National Security &amp; Intelligence Summit.
The NIS sets forth the strategic environment, promotes integration, and focuses resources.
The NIS is the blueprint that will drive the priorities for the nation‚Äôs 17 Intelligence Community components over the next four years.

The preceding were comments by NCTC Deputy Director Rasmussen at the ongoing @SenateHSGAC hearing: ‚ÄúCybersecurity, Terrorism, and Beyond‚Äù
And we are especially mindful of privacy and civil liberties concerns, particularly with respect to U.S. persons.
We are relentless in our efforts to ensure the data in TIDE is accurately entered, and that our records are as comprehensive as possible.
TIDE‚Äîis our database of known and suspected international terrorists, and it helps us ensure that all relevant information.. is shared..
We continue to assess that AQAP remains the al-Qa‚Äòida affiliate most likely to attempt transnational attacks against the United States.
ISIL‚Äôs ability to carry out complex, significant attacks in the West is currently limited‚Ä¶ Nevertheless the United States is not immune.
Left unchecked, ISIL poses an increasing threat to all governments it considers apostate‚Äînot just to the U.S. or European nations..
The greatest threat to the US and its interests from ISIL is inside Iraq, which combined with Syria, constitutes the group‚Äôs power center.
"In short, we cannot connect the dots if we cannot collect the dots that matter the most."
[Terrorists] are changing the way they communicate‚Ä¶ which frustrates our counterterrorism efforts.
As a result of leaks and disclosures... terrorists now understand the scope and scale of western collection capabilities..
There is no longer an expectation that regional affiliates will discuss their..plans with al-Qa‚Äòida‚Äôs senior leadership prior to execution.
Of greatest concern are those terrorist groups, such as.. ISIL that have a foothold in areas where governments have been unable to govern...
NR:  The threat from terrorist groups is geographically diffuse... and it is proving to be both resilient and adaptive...

This approach: Integrated People / Integrated Data has been a key element of NCTC‚Äôs last decade of success: http://t.co/9TmPVD4Sxq
‚ÄúNCTC should be a center for joint operational planning and joint intelligence, staffed by personnel from the various agencies.‚Äù
In this integrated, cross-agency approach to counterterrorism, NCTC embodies a key 9/11 Commission recommendation, that:
Organizationally a part of ODNI, NCTC is staffed by personnel from multiple departments and agencies from the Intelligence Community.
NCTC also provides the CT community with 24/7 situational awareness, terrorism threat reporting, and incident information tracking.
(2) to the Director of National Intelligence as his principal advisor on intel operations and analysis relating to counterterrorism.
The Director of NCTC has a unique, dual line of reporting:  (1) to the President on Executive branch-wide counterterrorism planning, and...
Additionally, NCTC produces interagency-coordinated analytic assessments on terrorism issues and publishes warnings, alerts, and advisories.
NCTC serves as the primary organization in the U.S. government for integrating and analyzing counterterrorism-related intelligence.

Download -- the Worldwide Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community, full Statement for the Record: http://t.co/D9hNLFUCk6
‚Ä¶to help protect the lives of American citizens here and abroad, from the myriad threats I described at the beginning of this statement.
And we must continue to protect our crown jewel sources and methods ‚Äì so that we can accomplish what we‚Äôve always been chartered to do‚Ä¶
Through all of this we must ‚Äì and will ‚Äì sustain our professional tradecraft and integrity.
4 - To ensure more oversight of sensitive collection activities.
3 - To modify how we conduct bulk collection of telephone metadata under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, and
2 - To develop additional protections under Section 702 of the FISA Act,
1 - To conduct further declassification,
I have specific tasking ‚Äì in conjunction with the Attorney General:
The President set the tone and direction for us in his speech and in his landmark Presidential Policy Directive‚Ä¶
The major take-away for us from the past several months is that we must lean in the direction of transparency.
‚Ä¶then we in the Intelligence Community will work as hard as we can to meet the expectations before us.
But, if dealing with reduced capabilities is what is needed to ensure the faith and confidence of the American people‚Ä¶
We are thus faced with the inescapable imperative to accept more risk.
The stark consequences of this perfect storm are plainly evident: the Intel Community is going to have less capacity to protect our nation‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶the impact of the losses caused by the disclosures will be amplified by the substantial budget reductions we are incurring.
NSA DOES collect foreign intelligence - the whole reason that NSA has existed since 1952‚Ä¶
..as the President noted..the men and women.. at NSA.. have done their utmost to protect this country, and do so in a lawful manner.
It pains me greatly that the National Security Agency and its magnificent work force have been pilloried in public commentary.
If..so, I call on him.. to facilitate the return of.. stolen documents not yet.. exposed, to prevent even more damage to US security.
Snowden claims that he‚Äôs ‚Äúwon,‚Äù and his mission is accomplished.
This includes putting the lives of members of..the intelligence community at risk, as well as our Armed Forces, diplomats, and our citizens.
‚Ä¶and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much, much harder.
Terrorists and other adversaries of this country are going to school on US intelligence sources, methods, and tradecraft‚Ä¶
As a result, we have lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners.
What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs.
As a consequence the nation is less safe, and its people less secure.
...the most massive and most damaging theft of intelligence information in our history..has consumed extraordinary time and energy‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶suffice to say we live in a complex, dangerous world...  (Download the Annual Worldwide Threat Assessment: http://t.co/D9hNLFUCk6 )
My list is long. It includes the scourge and diversification of terrorism, loosely connected and globally dispersed‚Ä¶
Looking back over my more than 1/2 century in intelligence, I have not experienced a time when we have been beset by more crises and threats
I‚Äôve made this next assertion previously; but it is, if anything, even more evident and relevant today.

Prioletti: ...by more closely aligning investigative costs with associated risk.
Prioletti: Taking these steps will advance security clearance reform and reduce insider threats...
Prioletti: They do so by clarifying position designation requirements and providing additional detail over the previous regulations.
Prioletti: The new regs are intended to ensure positions are accurately designated in a manner that mitigates the risk to national security.
Prioletti: Careful analysis must avoid ‚Äúoverdesignation,‚Äù which has cost implications; or ‚Äúunderdesignation‚Äù which leads to security risks.
Prioletti: The designated sensitivity level of the position then drives the type of background investigation required.
Prioletti: This includes whether that position requires to access classified information or could potentially damage to national security.
Prioletti: Clearance requirements of a Federal civilian position includes assessing both the risk and sensitivity level of the role.
Prioletti: The Proposed Rule aligns with standardization recommendations of the July 2012 GAO report: http://t.co/mCIxUbrGZQ
Prioletti: The goal of the Proposed Rule: promote consistency in designating positions as nat. sec. sensitive via national policy guidance.
Prioletti: The Proposed Rule is not intended to increase the number of national security sensitive positions within the Federal government.
Prioletti: National security risks / monetary costs associated with the number of security clearances show need for a consistent process.
Prioletti: The DNI, as Security Executive Agent, and the Dir. of OPM, as Suitability Executive Agent each help ensure a uniform system.
Prioletti: Civilian positions in the Federal govt have been designated as sensitive based on duties and responsibilities for over 60 years.

DNI:  If we had an alarm bell that went off whenever one terrorist communicated with another terrorist, our jobs would be infinitely easier.
DNI: But what we do not do is spy unlawfully on Americans, or for that matter spy indiscriminately on the citizens of any country.
DNI: We only spy for valid foreign intelligence purposes, as authorized by law, with multiple layers of oversight....
DNI: We focus on uncovering the secret plans and intentions of our foreign adversaries as we've been charged to do.
DNI: ‚Ä¶most Americans realize the IC exists to collect the vital intelligence that helps protect our nation from foreign threats.

#ODNI Intelligence Official Defends Surveillance in Wake of Disclosure	http://t.co/xZmqgwrFlW via @Phil_Mattingly
Litt: The Senate found, never under 702 has their been a willful violation of the law.
Q&amp;A has just begun with #ODNI General Counsel Robert Litt @BrookingsInst.
.. to ensure that our intelligence activities comply with our laws and	reflect our values.
I ask only that those who would change the current system do so with an appreciation of the efforts that have been made..
.. and we are working to declassify more information about our activities to inform that discussion.
Even before the recent disclosures, the President said that we welcomed a discussion about privacy and national security..
It has been reviewed and approved by all three branches of Government as consistent with the law and the Constitution.
I believe that our approach to achieving both security and privacy is effective and appropriate.
And make no mistake, our intelligence collection has helped to protect our Nation from a variety of threats..
Much is collected, but access, analysis and dissemination are subject to stringent controls and oversight.
..the procedures [for] collection under FISA are a sensible means of accounting for the changing nature of privacy in the information age..
..when Congress reauthorized Section 215 in 2009 and 2011 and Section 702 in 2012, iinformation was made available to every member..
By law, we are required to keep the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees informed about these programs..
Finally, there is the Congress.
..but before it does so, its questions and comments ensure that the application complies with the law.
Yes, the Court approves the great majority of applications at the end of this process..
In fact the exact opposite is true. The judges and their professional staff review every application carefully..
And I want to correct the erroneous claim that the FISA Court is a rubber stamp.
In addition to this oversight by the Executive Branch, there is considerable oversight by both the FISA Court and the Congress.
Finally, independent Inspectors General also review the operation of these programs.
For Title I collection, the DOJ regularly conducts reviews to ensure.. accordance with the court-approved minimization procedures.
ODNI, ‚Äúhas a dedicated Civil Liberties Protection Officer who actively oversees these programs.‚Äù
Decisions about targeting under Section 702 are reviewed first w/in NSA, and then by the DOJ and by my agency, the ODNI..
There are substantial safeguards in place that help ensure that the rules are followed.
But we don‚Äôt simply set out a bunch of rules and trust people to follow them.
In each case, we protect privacy by a multi-layered system of controls on what we collect and how we use what we collect
I‚Äôve outlined three different collection programs, under different provisions of FISA, which all reflect the framework I described.
So under Section 702, we have .. judicial approval of procedures.. to narrow the focus of the surveillance and limit its impact on privacy.
‚Äú..we target specific accounts because we are looking for foreign intelligence information.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt randomly target email addresses or collect all foreign individuals‚Äô emails under Section 702..‚Äù
Congress recognized this reality and required us to establish procedures to minimize the impact of this incidental collection on privacy.‚Äù
But the incidental acquisition of non-pertinent information is not unique to Section 702. It is common whenever you lawfully collect info..
‚ÄúWe may incidentally acquire the communications of Americans even though we are not targeting them..‚Äù
‚Äú..the targeting procedures are a way of minimizing the privacy impact of this collection both as to Americans and as to non-Americans..‚Äù
‚ÄúThe procedures must be reviewed by the Court to ensure that they are consistent with the statute and the Fourth Amendment‚Äù
‚ÄúThe targeting procedures are designed to ensure that we target someone only if we have a	valid foreign intelligence purpose..‚Äù
‚Äú.. subject to Court-approved ‚Äútargeting‚Äù procedures and ‚Äòminimization‚Äô procedures.‚Äù
‚ÄúInstead, the FISA Court approves annual certifications submitted by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence..‚Äù
‚ÄúCollection under Section 702 does not require individual judicial orders authorizing collection against each target.‚Äù
Mr. Litt: ‚Äú..collection under Section 702 is one of the most valuable sources of foreign intelligence we have.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd the information involved is unquestionably of great importance for national security..‚Äù
‚ÄúRather, it extended the FISA Court‚Äôs oversight to a kind of surveillance that Congress had originally placed outside of that oversight..‚Äù
‚Äú..Section 702 was not, as some have called it, a ‚Äòdefanging‚Äô of the FISA Court‚Äôs traditional authority.‚Äù
Section 702 created a new, more streamlined procedure to accomplish this surveillance.
After 9/11, this burden began to degrade our ability to collect the communications of foreign terrorists.
At the same time there was a dramatic increase in the use of the Internet for communications purposes, including by terrorists.
Today "most international communications travel over fiber optic cables and thus are no longer ‚Äúradio communications‚Äù
Initially, "Congress excluded international radio communications from the definition of electronic surveillance covered by FISA"
Mr. Litt: ‚ÄúThe third program I want to talk about is Section 702, part of the FISA Amendments Act of 2008.‚Äù
".. in large part because of the substantial protections we provide for the privacy of every person whose telephone number is collected."
In short, all three branches of Government have determined that this collection is lawful and reasonable..
And Congress reauthorized Section 215 in 2011, after the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees of both Houses had been briefed..
Mr. Litt: ‚ÄúApplications to obtain this data have been repeatedly approved by numerous judges of the FISA Court..‚Äù
‚Äú.. the conclusion that the bulk metadata collection is authorized under Section 215 is not that of the Intelligence Community alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen it passed the business records provision, Congress made clear that it had in mind such broad concepts of relevance.‚Äù
‚Äú..if there is a factual basis to believe the organization is involved in terrorism.‚Äù
‚ÄúThose guidelines state that ‚Äúwe can investigate an organization, not merely an individual or a particular act..‚Äù
‚ÄúThe statute requires that an authorized investigation be conducted in accordance with guidelines approved by the Attorney General.."
First, remember that the ‚Äúauthorized investigation‚Äù is an intelligence investigation, not a criminal one.
‚Äú..could comply with the..requirement that business records obtained pursuant to Section 215 be ‚Äúrelevant to an authorized investigation.‚Äù
‚ÄúSome have questioned how collection of a large volume of telephone metadata..‚Äù
‚ÄúIn this way, we protect both privacy and national security.‚Äù
Mr. Litt: ‚ÄúOnly the narrowest, most important use of this data is permitted; other uses are prohibited.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe collection has to be broad to be operationally effective, but it is limited to non-content data that has a low privacy value..‚Äù
‚Äú.. and only for a carefully circumscribed purpose‚Äîto help us find links between foreign terrorists and people in the United States.‚Äù
Mr Litt: ‚ÄúThe net result is that although we collect large volumes of metadata under this program, we only look at a tiny fraction of it..‚Äù
‚ÄúWe deal with it by limiting what the Intelligence Community is allowed do with the information we get under this program..‚Äù
‚ÄúThe way we fill this intelligence gap while protecting privacy illustrates the analytical approach I outlined earlier.‚Äù
‚ÄúHowever, telephone companies have no legal obligation to keep this kind of info, and they generally destroy it after a period of time..‚Äù
‚ÄúIn order to do so, however, we need to be able to access the records of telephone calls, possibly going back many years.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis collection program is designed to help us find those connections.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt can help identify links between terrorists overseas and their potential confederates in the United States.‚Äù
‚ÄúOn the other hand, this information is clearly useful from an intelligence perspective..‚Äù
‚Äú.. people worry.. for example, the govt could apply data mining techniques to a bulk data set and learn new personal facts about them..‚Äù
‚ÄúNonetheless, I recognize that there is a difference between getting metadata about one telephone number and getting it in bulk.‚Äù
‚ÄúAll of the metadata we get under this program is information that the telecom companies obtain and keep for their own business purposes.‚Äù
‚Äú..we do not get the identity of any party to the conversation; and we do not get any cell site or GPS locational information.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to emphasize that under this program we do not get the content of any conversation..‚Äù
‚ÄúThe FISA Court has repeatedly approved orders directing several telecom companies to produce certain categories of telephone metadata..‚Äù
Mr. Litt: ‚ÄúNow, of course, the FISA business records provision has been in the news because of one particular use of that provision.‚Äù
‚Äú..records obtained pursuant to the FISA business records provision are subject to court-approved minimization procedures..‚Äù
‚Äúfor an order requiring production of documents..when they are relevant to an authorized national security investigation..‚Äù
This provision, which is generally referred to as ‚ÄúSection 215..allows us to apply to the FISA Court..‚Äù
"..a provision was added in 1998 to provide such authority, and was amended by Section 215 of the USA-PATRIOT Act passed shortly after 9/11"
