Clinton goads Trump on his wealth. Says he's not releasing his tax returns because "maybe he's not as rich as he says he is."
Half of my timeline apparently thinks Donald Trump's interruptions are going to be the new Al Gore sighs, circa 2000.
Trump hits (Bill) Clinton on #NAFTA: "He approved NAFTA, which is the single worst trade deal ever approved. "
Trump to Clinton: "In all fairness to Secretary Clinton..yes? Is that OK? I want you to be very happy." So no 'Crooked' tonight, it seems.
Clinton says Trump's economic plan would be "trickle down all over again."
Hillary: "We need to have smart, fair trade deals."
Trump references Ford's recent small car announcement: "Ford is leaving." Ford has disputed that claim, for what it's worth.
Trump's opening line: "Our jobs are fleeing our country."

ICYMI, in the Business &amp; Autos section of today's paper: Wall Street likes self-driving view https://t.co/h7wgvgPqoY via @detroitnews
@PUrbanDC No problem!
My dispatch from today's @NADAUpdate / @JDPower Automotive Forum: Wall St doesn‚Äôt see downside for self-driving cars https://t.co/h7wgvgPqoY
Murphy: "What you're seeing is a wake up to auto makers that you have to hang onto the consumer beyond the point of sale."
Murphy: "When you see capital that is sort of chasing returns, you see poor decisions when there is more capital available."
Murphy says cos like Uber &amp; Lyft "are allowed to burn capital" on research, while cos like Ford &amp; GM are hamstrung by shareholder pressure.
Murphy on full-on car sharing: "When you talk to anyone that's pushing that, just ask them for their car keys &amp; see what their reaction is?"
Murphy: "I think we're 15 years removed from the 1st shock in the auto industry, &amp; I think we're heading toward a new one."
@BankofAmerica / @MerrillLynch managing director John Murphy is up next.
Michaeli: "When you think about the global impact of driverless vehicles...it could bring some of the frontier markets" to the forefront.
More Michaeli: "...&amp; we put it through a model that says 'what if driverless were to begin in 4 major states in 2020.'
Michaeli: "We have a lot of data based on regional breakouts...
Michaeli: "Ultimately the question we're asking ourselves is what's going to happen to the ratio of cars per household in the U.S?"
Michaeli: "We think that the profit poor is very lucrative, double that of [seasonally adjusted annual rate] in the U.S."
More optimism from @Citi Auto &amp; Auto Parts analyst Itay Michaeli: "We think the era of fully autonomous cars begins gradually in 2020."
Langan on self-driving autos: "There's a lot of challenges in the technology and it's amazing that it's come so far."
Langan: "A fully autonomous car that does everything for you is very challenging."
Langan: "I really think fully autonomous vehicles are decades away."
Langan: "In a shared/autonomous world, we're actually driving more." Says shared cars will not last as long if they're driven more often.
Langan: "You see numbers like that &amp; people get blown away, but then you realize there's plenty of offsets."
Langan: "Every 1 shared vehicle translates to 11-17 vehicles removed from the road." Could take 100 basis points off global growth, he says.
Langan: "what's happened here is the industry went from thinking this is sort of nice to have to thinking this is a must" re: cybersecurity
Langan said "it was a sort of a game changer last year when Jeep was hacked."
@UBS Auto Analyst Colin Langan is starting the panel on Wall Street's view of the rapidly changing U.S. auto industry.
Anderson: "Real safety is achieved when we're finding &amp; fixing defects before somebody gets hurt."
Anderson says "there's enough recalls for 1 out of every 5 cars that are on the road."
@NHTSAgov Deputy Administrator Blair Anderson is up next.
Krafcik on Google's role: "Airlines don't build airplanes. Airbus &amp; Boeing do that. Who knows how this is going to work out in autos?"
Krafcik says auto companies that "are more focused on A to B transportation" need to be worried about self-driving cars.
Krafcik asked "what does this do for human cognitive development?" Answers "I think it's an amazing thing for cognitive development!"
Krafcik: "There's a perception that we are dependent on info coming from the Google Cloud. Truth is, our technology is truly autonomous."
Krafcik: "We've been at this for 7 years, &amp; we've been all in on the full [autonomous] solution for half of that time period."
Krafcik says "we have been so focuses on solving the problem, we haven't thought about the biz model."
Krafcik says Google has learned it is important for self-driving cars to give drivers "a sense" of the info they are processing.
Krafcik: "I think there's a lot for the tech industry to learn from auto, but I think the same is true on the other side as well."
Krafcik concludes "...but for society...we really think it's worth it to try to get it done."
Krafcik: "None of this stuff is easy &amp; it's going to take years to get it all done.." (1/2)
Krafcik says "it's only a matter of time before the 1st self-driving cars are ready for the road," so it's important for feds to set rules.
Krafcik: "Readiness isn't just going to be determined by lines of code. It's going to be determined by policy makers &amp; of course the public"
Krafcik: "As you can imagine, at Google, we're all about data &amp; we're all about measurement."
But he admits others may not agree with the readiness determination.
Krafcik: "Safety will be our guiding principle in determining when we will be ready to launch."
"My team hears from countless people who believe their lives will be transformed" by self-driving autos, he says.
"For a lot of folks, this isn't mere curiosity," Krafcik says about people who ask when self-driving cars will be ready for mass consumption
Krafcik says @Google's self-driving testing "is the equivalent of 110 years of driving."
Krafcik says "it's super important to have that testing on public roads." States like Calif. have moved to mandate drivers for autos.
Krafcik onself-driving cars: "Every 1/10th of a second, we're reassessing the world &amp; figuring out what our path through that should be."
Crowded city streets present a much different challenge, he says
On self-driving cars on open roadways, Krafcik says: "Most of the job entails staying in a lane and not bumping into cars on the side of you
Krafcik says "we know that humans don't pay attention 100% when they're behind the wheel, even without automated driving aids."
Krafcik said Google was concerned about early testers willingness to take their eyes off the road.
"Turns out they really loved it," Krafcik said of Google employees 1st reactions to its self-driving car prototypes.
Krafcik says Google felt "pretty confident" putting its own employees in self-driving cars after about 4 years of research.
Krafcik says the question @Google gets on self-driving cars most often now is not if, but "when we will these be ready?
Krafcik: "We recognize to build a fully self-driving car is an ambitious goal, which people assumed was pure science fiction."
Krafcik: "A fully self-driving represents a fundamental shift in how we can go &amp; attack that problem" of U.S. road safety.
Krafcik: "As it turns out, we have been working on autonomous vehicles at Google for over 7 years."
Krafcik starts off by asking "aren't you guys a little bit tired of hearing about autonomous vehicles yet?
@google Self-driving project CEO John Krafcik is coming up now to speak about his company's efforts to develop self-driving cars.

Welch: "Once the steering wheel disappears, liability will shift to manufacturers, fleet owners" etc.
Welch on self-driving: "The biggest impendiment to autonomous vehicles will come not from gov't regulations, but from consumer acceptance."
Welch continued "..but the availability of ride-share options may impact the popularity of dual ownership."
Welch: "We believe most people who own at least 1 vehicle will continue to do so.." (1/2)
Welch predicts the percentage of cars that are owned by a person will remain close to 70%. "May dip to 65-35," he says.
Welch: "The face of the owner is going to be fleet operator or private."
"Most people with rural to urban or suburban to exurban commute patterns will still favor private ownership, we believe," he says.
Welch says ride-sharing "makes the most sense" in urban markets like New York &amp; Washington, D.C.
@NADAUpdate President Peter Welch is up next
Odell, wrapping up on the Uber-fication of America: "We are challenged in a positive way by it."
Odell: "I think dealers have an incredible opportunity to play a role in the emerging [mobility] services area."
Odell: "Customer experience is essential to all of this. We are talking about people, after all."
Odell: "Our premise is the customer owns the data. And if you provide value, they will allow you to use it."
He says @Ford "has the largest fleet [of self-driving car prototypes] on the road."
Odell says "everybody has something to say about autonomous vehicles. Everybody is going to be 1st."
He says he thinks soon "we all stop staying 'connected,' because everything will be. It will be like breathing."
Odell says @Ford's "Smart Mobility" LLC has 5 key areas: connectivity, mobillity, autonomous vehicles, customer exp and data analytics.
Odell says @Ford is taking chances like parterning w/ @lyft "because we want to disrupt ourselves. Better to be the hunter than the hunted."
Odell defines cars, utilities, trucks, financing, parts &amp; service as @Ford's "core business." Smart mobility is an "emerging opportunity."
@Ford's Odell is bullish on millenials: "I actually believe that miles traveled will go up as people find different ways to go from A to B."
Odell continued: "We [at @Ford] actually believe it is better to disrupt yourself than to be disrupted."
More Odell: "For a long time we've been hearing that the disruption only moves one way..." (1/2)
Odell admits "it's a disruptive world we live in" for the auto industry now, however.
Odell: "We can talk about disruption, but at the end of the day, there are consumers whose problems we have to solve."
Back from lunch, @Ford EVP of Global Marketing, Sales &amp; Service Stephen Odell is now talking about "the evolving mobility landscape."
@Jaguar Pres Joe Eberhardbt starts out w/ an old saying: "You can't buy happiness, but you can buy cars, &amp; for some of us, that's the same"
"Millennials expect quick, transparent transactions. If they don't get it, they will walk out," he says.
@BMW President Ludwig Willisch is focusing on the challenges auto dealers face in reaching millennials.
"I think a lot of you would," he adds.
Schwartz asks "How many of you would pay an Uber type service to pick your car up &amp; take it to go get serviced?"
Schwartz says consumer svc is important: "While tech is very important, there is an element of humanity in our business that we cannot lose"
"There's not a lot I can do about the location of somebody's dealership," he said.
Schwartz says 70% of consumers will travel 40 miles to buy a car, but they will only go 10 miles to have it serviced.
Schwartz says 29% of drivers believe auto dealerships have unfair labor prices.
Schwartz says value, trust &amp; convenience are the most important factors when drivers are considering where to get their cars serviced.
"If your pizza is high-tech, we've got to get more high-tech when it comes to fixing our cars,"@CoxAutomotive Pres Sandy Schwartz says

Edwards on @MichiganDEQ's role in #FlintWaterCrisis: "As I sit here, I can't think fo a single thing they did right."
@jasoninthehouse to Hedman: "I wish you were at the @EPA, so I could call on you to be fired. Bc you should've never been in this position."

Updated #FlintHearing (which is still going) story - Oversight Chair: Bad decisions on Flint ‚Äòunbelievable‚Äô https://t.co/EpX6eIMeZo
.@RepBuddyCarter ups the #FlintWaterCrisis disgust ante: "There‚Äôs a special place in hell for actions like this," he says.
@RepLawrence to Earley: "In America, we don‚Äôt normally boil water. We turn on the facet &amp; we trust the government to ensure that it‚Äôs safe"
More Cummings: "There‚Äôs no reason in 2016 people should turn on the facet &amp; be getting poisoned."
.@RepCummings throws his hands up: "As I'm sitting here listening to all of this, it's sickening. All of it."
Rep. @jasoninthehouse responds "Wow."
Hedman responds: "I don't think anyone at the EPA did anything wrong, but I do believe we could have done more."
Rep. @jasoninthehouse asks Susan Hedman "Did anybody at the @EPA do anything wrong?"
@virginia_tech's Marc Edwards says it is "desirable" for Flint to replace all lead pipes.
More Connolly: "If government exists for any reason, it is to protect our citizens."
Connolly: "Irrespective of our politics or anything else, this is a catastrophic failure of our citizens." (1/2)
Connolly: "I for one, coming from local govt, am not going to let the local DEQ off the hook bc it sounds better for 1 political philosophy"
Rep. @GerryConnolly says "I don‚Äôt think this is the @EPA‚Äôs finest moment," but shifts quickly to blaming local officials at @MichiganDEQ.
Audience members applaud before Rep. @jasoninthehouse restores order in the #FlintHearing room.
Rep. @jasoninthehouse to Susan Hedman: "You still don't get it. You screwed up &amp; you messed up people's lives."
Clay: "The General Motors plant stopped using the water when it started to rust new parts. What would that tell the average person?"

Rep. John Mica says "I think this hearing is going to be known as the great finger pointing hearing." @PoliFact?
Earley, grilled by @EleanorNorton, says "we relied on the information we received from the @MichiganDEQ that this was a manageable issue."
RT @jonathanoosting: Rep. @justinamash of Michigan now asking Earley about his October 2015 op-ed on #FlintWaterCrisis
2/2 Edwards: "Apparently, being a government agency means never having to say you are sorry."
Earlier Edwars said the EPA &amp; CDC "have never apologized for their actions in D.C or in Flint, MI" (1/2)
Edwards: "Had Flint residents not fought for the truth...the harm to Flint‚Äôs children would never have been exposed"
(2/2) Edwards continued: "Why should Ms. Hedman, not face the same or worse fate, as a common landlord who engaged in similar behavior?"
Edwards on Hedman: "She allowed 	Flint children to be harmed...." 1/2
Edwards says Hedman "actively aided, abetted &amp; emboldened," unethical behavior at the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality
More Edwards: "I personally witnessed and exposed 	misconduct by EPA Regional Administrator Susan Hedman."
Edwards charges the @EPA with "creating the aforementioned climate in which 'a Flint' was inevitable"

RT @jonathanoosting: Walling: ‚ÄúThe governor discounted the complaints, even of concerned pastors and parents.‚Äù Cites executive staff emails
Walling: "We now know we were given bad information and worse water."
Walling says he reached out to the @EPA with concerns about the Flint River water quality, but he relied on state &amp; federal experience.
Walling adds, however, "#Flint never should have been in this situation.‚Äù
Former Flint mayor Dayne Walling says "Flint is a strong city. It will survive, &amp; with the right support, it will thrive."
Earley: "This is water treatment issue. This is not a leadership issue. This not 'who can we blame?'"
Earley: "I went back to Flint because I  believed I could make a difference....I too drank the water."
More Earley: "The fact that I was EM during the time the switch was made does not mean that it was my decision."
Fmr Flint Emergency Manager Darnell Earley says "I believe I have been unjustly persecuted, vilified and smeared" during #FlintWaterCrisis
But Hedman adds that she resigned from the @EPA because "this crisis happened on my watch."
Fmr @EPA official Susan Hedman notes "I did not make the decision to use Flint River water without corrosion control treatments."

Shuster responds: "This has not been done in the dark &amp; it has not been done at the last minute. There's been lots &amp; lots of discussion."
DeFazio argues for more time: "I feel we should slow down a little bit here; think about alternatives."
@RepPeterDeFazio is up now‚Ä¶
Shuster: "This isn‚Äôt a new idea.  The Clinton and Bush administrations tried to do it."
Shuster: " I know that notion goes against the establishment. We've already had some very senior Republicans come out in opposition."
Shuster: "The basic problem is that the FAA is a huge bureaucracy ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a high-tech service provider."
Shuster continued: "A little bit here, a little bit there...But it was just rearranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic."
Shuster: "The time for piecemeal reform is over. For 30 years, we've tried this‚Ä¶.
Re: Dem opposition, Shuster allows: "we do have an honest policy disagreement on the approach to reform ATC."
More Shuster: "W/o real improvement the sys is only going to get worse. Unfortunately the FAA has proven it can't modernize the ATC system."
@RepBillShuster makes the case: "I believe that the status quo is unacceptable, and that real change is necessary."

Story: Sen. @DavidVitter says gas tax hike must be offset http://t.co/NqgRf43iqs
Sen. Inhofe playing semantics: "I'd like to not have us talk about a 'gas tax increase.' It is a user fee. User fees are popular."
More Boxer: "They all say they want to do something, but they all said that the last time &amp; we got stuck with this little extension."
Boxer throws cold water on the Kumbaya talk: "The only action I see is from this committee. Where is everybody else?"
Vitter says of gas tax, repatriation &amp; drilling proposals: "I think that‚Äôs the sort list of real world, practical solutions."
Vitter also says he is "certainly open to" repatriation "if we do it right."
RT @mpoindc: Hmm... Boxer just endorsed a tax cut offset for raising the gas tax. Further than she's gone before on that measure.
@SenatorBoxer agrees "there ought to be an offset if we go with a gas tax increase for middle class famillies &amp; the working poor."
Vitter says gas tax offset will be important to win GOP support, "especially in the House."
Vitter: Offset for gas tax hike necessary "so everyone except the very wealth don‚Äôt pay more federal taxes."
Vitter says he's open to a gas tax hike, but only if it's accompanied by a middle class tax offset
Sen. Vitter says there are 3 realistic options to pay for transpo funding: Increase the gas tax, repatriation &amp; upping energy production
More Sen. @DavidVitter: "May isn‚Äôt that far away right? So I think it‚Äôs time to cut to the case."
Sen. @DavidVitter brings up the elephant in the room, money: "I want to encourage us to sort of cut to the case on the financing side."
.@SenWhitehouse joins in: "It doesn‚Äôt save money to save money on infrastructure. All it does is move costs to the private sector."

@SecretaryFoxx revives the phrase "over my skis."
We've ventured into trucker scheduling territory now...#HoursOfService
Foxx disputes @RepPeterDeFazio's political analysis: "I'm hearing differently about the possibility of business tax reform."
Foxx's responds: "We do have time constraints, [but] we think our proposal is practical."
DeFazio asks @SecretaryFoxx if he has a "back up" to avoid May 31 infrastructure shut down. Pushing on gas tax hike.
DeFazio: "We're not going to see repatriation out of this Congress. The Republicans don't support it."
DeFazio notes that Obama's $478B proposal "would put us at the point where if the gas tax had been indexed to inflation."
RT @PoliticoKevin: .@SenSanders' $1T bill is helping out @USDOT. @SecretaryFoxx notes "others are calling for far, far more than" $478B.
@RepBillShuster says recalls @SecretaryFoxx's time as Charlotte mayor: "You've dealt with every crappy federal program."
Foxx on Obama transpo proposal: "$478B sounds like enough to choke a horse as we say in NC, but against what we need, it's not a big number"
Foxx: "The system needs us to not budget to numbers, it needs us to budget to results. The HTF balance is a number. It is not an outcome."
Foxx on short-term partches: "Instead of saying 'build, build, build,' Congress has been saying stop."
Foxx "At a time when we should be building more, we're building less."
Foxx: "Our country is too great to allow our infrastructure to fall apart. We must do something."
Foxx says the 1st priority of a new transpo bill is "we need to take care of the system we have."
Foxx deadpans: "One thing about being designated survivor is I had lots of time to think about these [transportation funding] issues."
.@RepMarkMeadows notes @SecretaryFoxx was almost president when he was designated survivor during this year's State of the Union.
RT @AdamKSnider: Lesson from early in today's @Transport hearing - half the people I follow are transpo nerds
DeFazio says he was hoping @SecretaryFoxx would not come on transit "because that's breaking down &amp; sometimes causing accidents."
RT @mpoindc: @Keith_Laing @SecretaryFoxx I see what he did there.
.@RepPeterDeFazio lays out the stakes for not passing a #transpobill: "We're looking at grinding to a halt pretty soon."
Shuster says a highway bill is one of his top priorities, &amp; he believes it's one of Congress' overall top priorities.
Shuster says he was worried @SecretaryFoxx would get stuck in DC traffic. #StuckInTraffic
