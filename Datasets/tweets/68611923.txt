For instance, an exchange with Michael Bennet over arts in schools prompted by a question from a passionate Iowan: https://t.co/8dr4VDIuJN
Bennet, to @EmmaKinery, said he doesn't think about whether there's "room" for him and Hickenlooper; instead, he said he's looking at what different experiences he's had that he's able to add to the process. A decision on a run would come this spring.
To note from Bennet in a pre-announcement Iowa town hall last night: He's congenial. He's comfortable. He was unscripted. Several folks in attendance said they're looking for someone more in the middle. He felt at ease, but also had his points, on a range of issues, nailed down. https://t.co/usvG0lw5Cc
Bennet on D.C. in next two years: ‚ÄúI think the United States Senate over the next two years is going to hold this guy to account. That‚Äôs what I hope. And that‚Äôs what we need to do. The folks on the other side shouldn‚Äôt take legal advice from Fox News.‚Äù
Colorado's Bennet, in Iowa, on timeline of announcement: Decision will come soon, ‚Äúcertainly not months‚Äù from now. Why him? He noted his experiences as superintendent of schools in CO &amp; ten years on Ag committee. He said Hickenlooper's decision does not affect his own.
Bennet in Iowa: "We‚Äôre going to need to win in unusual places. And we‚Äôre going to have to build new coalitions...The old coalitions cannot support the enduring and imaginative change that we need to make as a democratic republic if we‚Äôre going to secure the future for our kids."
Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is on a three-day swing in Iowa. A look at Bennet on the stump last night in Johnston: "It‚Äôs not going to be easy with Koch brothers.

Important to note: @iowademocrats say if a candidate at a caucus site does not have 15% support of room, those caucusgoers may then acquire another paper &amp; write down another candidate's name (per usual). But both paper documents will be kept.
.@iowademocrats announce that Iowa caucusgoers will also now write down their chosen candidate on paper -- this will allow for a document trail from caucus sites to be preserved for recount purposes.
New changes to Iowa Caucus --&gt; @iowademocrats announcing a "virtual caucus" allowing folks to take part if unable to attend the Feb. 3 caucus in-person. If a congressional district has 250 state delegates, an *additional* 25 will assigned from "virtual caucus" results.

Now do I think Espy is going to pull off a win? I'm suspect. More on that (with more voter sound) in the coming days...
Jacob White, infrequent Republican voter who did not vote Nov. 6, says he'll vote Espy in Tuesday's runoff: "I don't think she's a proper public figure to have. Especially making comments about hanging. We don't need that in Mississippi. Like, we already get a bad rep as it is." https://t.co/UZkEHqxZ8F

Also: Issues around race are on voters' minds. Her past statements are on voters' minds. I'll be posting a litany of voter sound over the next two days. To deny that this is an issue would be misguided. (Trust me, I'd prefer to talk about healthcare &amp; trade issues from hay bales)
To note: NBC News has made it clear to the Hyde-Smith campaign the desire to engage in a forthright conversation with the senator about the matters at hand. With tomorrow the final day of normal campaigning (Monday=Two Trump rallies), I'm questioning whether voters will get that. https://t.co/0BiVPG9y4K

Hyde-Smith on Espy--&gt; "He would vote with Chuck Schumer 100% of the time‚Ä¶he‚Äôs trying to come across as a moderate. He is nothing of a moderate. When it comes to second amendment rights, I‚Äôm the senator to protect you. My opponent will not." #MSSEN

Hyde-Smith --&gt; "I want to repeal Obamacare‚Ä¶I have never voted for a bill that excluded pre-existing conditions‚Ä¶.everything that we will support I can assure you will include pre-existing conditions.‚Äù
Fast fact: Trump beat Clinton in 2016 here in Mississippi by 18%. On Nov. 6, it was Hyde-Smith 41%, Espy 40%, McDaniel 16%.
Espy, on White House's trade war, says President Trump tried to ‚Äúcurry favor‚Äù with folks in Ohio and Pennyslvania at cost of soybean farmers in Mississippi. Calls trade war ‚Äúa terrible decision.‚Äù
Cindy Hyde-Smith --&gt; "[Espy] is too liberal for Mississippi‚Ä¶.I‚Äôll stand up and protect our conservative values."

Pence: "We are aware of the concern that US-China competition will hurt the region economically &amp; that S.China Sea developments will increase military tension. So let me be clear: [US] seeks a better relationship w/ China based on fairness, reciprocity &amp; respect for sovereignty"
Pence, at APEC, ahead of Trump-Xi meeting later this month --&gt; "As President Trump prepares to meet with President Xi at the G-20 Summit in Argentina, we believe that progress could be made, but either way, the United States remains in a strong position."
Pence at APEC --&gt; "The United States is drawing closer to our allies everyday."
Pence at APEC --&gt;"Authoritarianism &amp; aggression have no place in the Indo-Pacific. In the days ahead, the [US] will continue to put America First...But America First does not mean America alone &amp; we know that our prosperity, our security &amp; our future are intertwined with yours."
Pence at APEC: "It‚Äôs also privilege to announce our new Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative. In conjunction with more than $400 million in American funding, this program will help empower the region‚Äôs citizens, combat corruption, and strengthen sovereignty."
Pence at APEC --&gt; "We will continue to support efforts within ASEAN to adopt a meaningful and binding code of conduct that respects the rights of all nations, including the freedom of navigation, in the South China Sea."
Pence follows--&gt;"The United States offers a better option. We don‚Äôt drown our partners in a sea of debt. We don‚Äôt coerce or compromise your independence...we don‚Äôt offer a constricting belt or a one-way road. When you partner with us, we partner with you, and we all prosper."
Pence with knock on China at APEC --&gt; "Some are offering infrastructure loans to governments across the Indo-Pacific...those loans are often opaque at best, the projects they support are often unsustainable &amp; poor quality. Too often...strings attached and lead to staggering debt"
Pence at APEC --&gt; ‚ÄúI can assure you we will continue to hold fast to our conviction that a free and open Indo-Pacific deserves a free and open internet.‚Äù
Pence at APEC --&gt; "As President Trump said just hours ago in the Oval Office, he has 'great respect for President Xi and great respect for China.' But in the president‚Äôs words, 'China has taken advantage of the United States for many, many years.' And those days are over."
Pence at APEC: "While we‚Äôve been forging new deals, we‚Äôve also stood up to countries that use unfair trade practices. Just look at the stand that President Trump has taken on our trading relationship with China."
Pence at APEC --&gt; "The United States also seeks an open Indo-Pacific, where commerce and culture flow freely ‚Äì where the seas and the skies are accessible to all with peaceful aims..."
Pence at APEC --&gt; "Last year, at this very forum, the president promised to 'always put America First' ‚Äì and our actions have led to growth in our country and across the Indo-Pacific as well."
Pence at APEC --&gt; "The United States‚Äô total investment in the Indo-Pacific is now more than $1.4 trillion ‚Äì more than China‚Äôs, Japan‚Äôs, and South Korea‚Äôs combined ‚Äì and American investment in the Indo-Pacific will only continue to rise."

Tonight's results would more closely reflect the mix of ballots from "bucket A" and "bucket B" -- https://t.co/rbtzWoPKCI https://t.co/uY2dCCRFGA
In short: McSally camp has maintained last 4 days that the uncounted 196k ballots that were hand delivered on E-Day would dramatically boost them back into this because they reflected day-of voters. But if those numbers actually reflect, that's...tough math. (Sinema won them..) https://t.co/etqvO2HyL3
Refer to last night's thread for more on that... https://t.co/niqIv2NXbj
#2) Per convo w/ Maricopa County Recorder Fontes last night, about 50k votes (presumably from the "bucket A" ballots heavily favoring Sinema) are delayed from being announced for several days for additional review. Meaning tonight's batch should include many "bucket B" ballots.
McSally's camp has said the 196k "bucket B" Maricopa County voters will reflect the R+10% turnout advantage seen among voters who filled out ballots at poll. Yet this is how THOSE in-person Maricopa voters voted, per @Garrett_Archer:	McSally: 118146 (47.8%)	Sinema: 124109 (50.2%)
*The McSally camp has maintained that the outstanding 196k ballots that were early ballots hand delivered on E-Day would greatly advantage McSally &amp; cut deficit. Cmpgn said these are high-propensity Rs &amp; would closely reflect outcome of those who filled out their ballots on E-Day
The next batch of Maricopa County ballots are about to drop. 	Two points to make:
RT @MarkSalter55: Stop doing this, NRSC. McSally is losing fair and square, and she‚Äôs underperforming in more than Maricopa. The race is al‚Ä¶
RT @senyorreporter: Just spoke with two Pima County GOP officials who have been observing the election process. One was going to bring up a‚Ä¶
4) The "cure" period that the settlement allowed for today gives Maricopa, Pima and the other 13 counties until next Wednesday to confer with individuals whose signatures on early ballots delivered on E-Day that did not match state records to verify authenticity.
However, Fontes said that it would be ‚Äúmostly true‚Äù to suggest that the ballot results from the last two days and heading forward are being released in chronological order. He was just not prepared to commit himself to certainty that the buckets have not been mixed together.
Fontes on Bucket A v. Bucket B: ‚ÄúNo rhyme or reason to distinguish the two,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúThere is no perfect line of demarcation between early ballots that come in before Election Day &amp; those that come in on Election Day.‚Äù ....
3) Maricopa County Recorder Fontes now tells us that it would not be completely accurate to say that the votes announced last 2 days consist of just ‚Äúbucket A‚Äù ballots: ‚ÄúSome early ballots in bucket A have spilled into bucket B and some from bucket B have spilled into bucket A.‚Äù
Soooo, on Saturday night, expect a potential mixture of "Bucket A" and "Bucket B" votes to come in for the next round of announced results. But that's where "potential mixture" needs some explaining....
2) So recall "Bucket A" is early ballots turned in prior to Election Day &amp; "Bucket B" are the early ballots turned in on E-Day. There are about 70k "Bucket A" ballots outstanding. Expect only a fraction of those to be released on Saturday, now, because many sent to "dupe board."
...These roughly 50k ballots have not yet appeared in the announced results and are expected to take several more days to review. Most thus far are early ballots returned prior to Election Day, which heavily favored Sinema. Don't expect these results this weekend.
....The ‚Äúdupe board‚Äù is the board that includes a Republican and a Democrat -- as appointed by their party chairs -- who manually review each ‚Äúoutstack ballot‚Äù with what appears to be two votes to determine the intent of the voter...
1) In Maricopa County, about 50k ballots (so far) have been sent to the "dupe board" -- ballots that appear to have 2 options for same race marked, often inadvertently by a pen drop or accidental slash or smudge or bleed through....

Here's 9 minutes worth of bites from a few AZ Republican &amp; Independent voters who told us they are voting for Kyrsten Sinema. In short, 4 of the first 5 tailgaters we talked to outside the Arizona St. football game on Saturday fit this description. https://t.co/xJwKQfxrOE
We've talked to plenty of AZ Republicans who voted McSally. We've talked to Dems who voted Sinema. But it is the crossover Republicans &amp; Independents who Sinema needs lots of. We've met....quite a share over the last 4 days. But how much stock should we put in these anecdotes?
And then Sinema has been up on airwaves since spring campaigning as the AZ independent voice. She's neglected the AZ DEM Party &amp; its GOV candidate in the process. She says she's "grown" since early 2000s but hasn't offered specifics, instead pointing to her 6 yrs in Congress.
Now here comes the reality of race: We know how the 2 candidates have run their campaigns. McSally has stood solidly with Pres. Trump, campaigning with likes of even Don Jr. last week &amp; often touted her "97%" voting record with POTUS. She's also campaigned with Romney &amp; GW Bush.
@NickRiccardi @MauraEBarrett Maura has the wheel!!
Maricopa County, as one example -- though a significant one cause ~60% of electorate is in it, will not begin announcing its initial results of early ballots-hand-delivered-on-Election Day until 7pmET on *Thursday*. The results will be incrementally released over 9-10 days.
The hurdle here with that remaining ~10% of the vote that could go uncounted tonight: Those early ballots hand delivered at AZ polling locations must be signature verified. This takes time! Counties verify signatures on ballot envelope to DMV/voter reg records. Must verify match.
Thennnn, this is where it'll get interesting if it's close in #AZSEN: The outstanding votes that will have to still be tabulated at the end of the night are the early ballots hand delivered to polling locations today. This could make up ~10% of the electorate.
Then, after those initial figures announced at 10pmET, we'll begin getting figures from in-person votes cast today across AZ. Those will come in, per usual, on a rolling basis as the votes are tabulated by counties. In-person voters expected to make up ~12% of total electorate.
As for tonight........(!!!)........if the margin is within ~1.5% toward Sinema or McSally tonight by midnight, hold on for what could be a few days of ballot counting. Why? A good 75-80% of the total vote (these are the mailed-in ballots) will be announced in the 10pmET hour.

Sinema on border: "I've been bucking my party on the border..." Says she supported funding for border wall but also said DACA needs to pass.
McSally on Dreamers/taking name off bill that would have given path to citizenship: "I‚Äôm wiling to do something on DACA, but we‚Äôve got to secure the border."
Sinema on McSally: "Well Martha has said those things‚Ä¶ has shown she‚Äôs willing to say and do anything to get elected."
Q: Do you want to privatize social security? 	McSally: ‚ÄúAbsolutely not! ... Democrats are [having us] throwing granny off the cliff! Voters are not going to believe this.‚Äù	Q: Medicare into private voucher system? 	McSally: "Absolutely not!"
McSally on Sinema saying she cut Medicare: ‚ÄúYou cannot make this up. These are just more lies."
Sinema on McSally/pre-existing conditions: "We took the vote and during the vote, Martha voted to repeal those protections. Those are the protections Arizonans count on everyday." McSally response: "Classic fear tactic" &amp; "outright lie." McSally voted for AHCA.

RT @yvonnewingett: McSally: "I‚Äôm a survivor of sexual abuse." She says "it was disgusting" the way Democrats handled Kavanaugh confirmation‚Ä¶
Sinema goes on about Kavanaugh: ‚ÄúHe appears to have lied under oath to some of the questions‚Ä¶‚ÄúUltimately I would have voted no on Justice Kavanaugh. I was disappointed that the Senate wouldn‚Äôt release the results of the FBI report. ‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt share that with the AZ public.."
Sinema on Kavanaugh focused on the process: "I was incredibly disappointed in way the Senate behaved. A circus....Candidate going to supreme court shouldn‚Äôt be evaluated based on conservative or liberal...Should be considered on integrity."
Sinema used example of tariffs -- calling out impact on four different local businesses (including cotton, dairy and a brewery) -- as where President Trump should be called out.
Sinema on McSally/Trump relationship: "We do have a difference of opinion. I think we deserve a senator who calls the balls and strikes‚Ä¶Martha has a 98 percent voting record with her party and her president‚Ä¶not blindly following what the party leaders tell us to do."
#AZSEN: 	Q to McSally (asked twice): Proud of way Trump has conducted himself in WH?	McSally: "Look, President trump ran for office one time and won. He‚Äôs a disruptor. We went to dc to shake things up and he‚Äôs doing that...he‚Äôs leading the country in the right direction."
There's too much to tweet while logging. Lots in the first 10 minutes of this debate in AZ.
First Q to McSally: Her distance from Trump in 2016 versus now (he's coming to town on Friday for rally). McSally: "Nothing changed...I‚Äôve never endorsed anyone for anything‚Ä¶But he‚Äôs now in office as President of the [US]....I built a good relationship with the president."

Few notes: 1) Arizona PBS reaches all household televisions statewide. 2) McSally campaign has not said why it would not engage in Oct. 16 debate. 3) AZ PBS with @tedatpbs has moderated last string of state's biggest races.
James Owens, comms director for Sinema campaign: "In the absence of a response from Congresswoman McSally, we coordinated with the local Arizona outlets on debates set for October 15 and 16, instead of CNN. We then confirmed those debates publicly last week."
Sinema's cmpgn says it sent letter to McSally camp in early Sept. to engage in conversation about debates &amp; McSally's camp rejected the letter and has not received a response since.
McSally spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair, in statement to NBC, presses Sinema campaign to agree to CNN (+local partner) debate over the PBS-AZ Republic debate: https://t.co/yVcAuDTeTz
The rundown: 	--Sept. 14: Sinema camp: It will debate Oct. 15 (Arizona PBS/AZ Republic) &amp; Oct. 16 (Arizona Public Media)	-Sept. 21: McSally camp: Will debate Oct. 15 (CNN &amp; encourages participation of local partner)	-Sept. 22: No budging by either camp in statements to NBC.
#AZSEN: No debate for AZ's next U.S. Senator? No negotiations taking place between Sinema-McSally camps &amp; no indication of budging on debate proposals. To note: McSally has not agreed to debate w/ AZ PBS -- the go-to debate of '16 &amp; '12 Senate races &amp; '14 &amp; '10 governor's races.

Kelli Ward on primary eve at press conference: "With thirty hours left in this critical primary campaign, I remain laser focused on defeating Martha McSally tomorrow..."
More Kelli Ward on McCain: "Senator McCain held different political views on many, many things on issues ranging from domestic policy, foreign policy and, of course, on President Trump. Our differences were always strictly political."
"The media sometimes might hope for a narrative that would hinder the momentum of our campaign &amp; that momentum is huge. From the time Sen McCain was diagnosed with his terrible terrible illness, I‚Äôve asked again and again and again for people out there to join with me in prayer."
‚ÄúThe media quickly ran with a false narrative that I was being insensitive to Senator McCain at a time when he found himself in dire straits. To be clear, my comments were in no way directed at senator McCain or his family or his team. My comments were in reference to the media." https://t.co/S2kTOX805c

But Arpaio added over the phone about McCain: "He‚Äôs been a fighter. He put up a tough fight. We‚Äôve had our fights here and there, but he served his country all these years -- can‚Äôt take that away from him. And he‚Äôs a hard worker. Always working."
When asked why he hadn't put out a statement since McCain's passing, he responded: "I just sent the condolences the day before he died when he was very, very seriously ill."
When asked about inflammatory tweets by two of his top cmpgn advisers, Dustin Stockton &amp; Jennifer Lawrence, he responded: "I heard that. I told them to call it down. That‚Äôs not the way of using the Facebook and so on. But they were responding to all of Ward‚Äôs vicious attacks."
Arpaio is on the ninth day of his bus tour, making stops to the border in Nogales and Yuma, and heading northbound on Monday to Prescott or Flagstaff, he said. He returns to his home in Fountain Hills each night. He plans to watch results tomorrow night at a nearby diner.
To which the 86-year-old Arpaio offered up a quick snap: "Dr. Ward will encourage me to retire cause I may die."
Arpaio is still defensive about age. He says he exited a Scottsdale restaurant last week &amp; got his blood pressure by a technician passing by. "Guess what: It came out 120 over 82. So screw all these people who say I'm too old."
Continued Arpaio on the #AZSEN primary tomorrow: "Everyone I talk to says they‚Äôre voting for me and voted for me early," he said. And without a pause, added: "I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre not lying."
Arpaio over phone: "I was at the buffet [Surprise's Golden Corral location] last night. The waitress and the manager -- she was a nice person -- said, 'Thanks for coming in.' I started feeding myself before not long I had a long line of patrons. They all wanted pictures."
Arpaio likes to say he's never lost a GOP primary. He truly believes tomorrow won't be different.
Arpaio never ran a television ad this race. Why not? "Everybody knows me. I sure don‚Äôt have to be like my two opponents who don‚Äôt even know who they are. They have to pay millions to educate the public. And Sinema is on the air every minute."
Caught up over phone with Joe Arpaio last night. Was on his way from Lake Havasu (Ward's town) to Bullhead City. His 9th day of late-play bus tour. "Did you go out on the lake?" I asked. "I only like the ocean. I don't like the lake. Well, I take that back...I like Lake Havasu."

After knocking Democrat Joe Donnelly, Pence touts GOP Sen. Todd Young &amp; then adds, without naming Braun by name (official VP event): "I just know Indiana is going to send another strong conservative to the United States Senate."
Pence tells crowd "Joe voted no" for tax cuts, to defund Planned Parenthood &amp; to repeal Obamacare. Emphasizes the GOP's tax law: "As you all know, these tax cuts are delivering a middle class miracle across Indiana, all across America."
Pence references Sept. 2017 event in Anderson, IN, that Joe Donnelly attended: "I told to him then, 'We‚Äôre going to get this tax cut done, and we‚Äôre going to get it done together.' But it didn‚Äôt turn out that way. And Hoosiers deserve to know why."
Pence knocks Joe Donnelly at home state event: "These liberals in Washington, D.C., are not your parents' liberals...they‚Äôve gone farther to the left than any before. You only have to look at Indiana's own Senator Joe Donnelly for proof of that."
VP Pence today at event in Indianapolis: https://t.co/YSLUW29pmN
Pence in Indy: "We cut taxes for job creators all across this country so they can compete and win with businesses anywhere in the world. In fact, when we cut taxes, we cut out the cornerstone of Obamacare: The individual mandate is gone. It‚Äôs off the books.‚Äù

So fwiw, for history sake, it was Mike Pence at a rally in Raleigh who shepherded the Trump campaign's position to "rip up" the Iran nuclear deal. Today, the administration followed through--at least on the U.S.'s end.
Ted Cruz knocked Trump at GOP debate in Miami: "Frankly, one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal."
Donald Trump on Meet the Press in August 2015: "It's very hard to say, 'We're ripping up.'" He continued in that interview: "I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract."
Pence added at that Raleigh rally: "We're going to marshal our allies, and we will not allow the leading state-sponsor of terrorism to ever obtain a usable nuclear weapon." https://t.co/r4rVPOiqxQ
Flashback: First time the Trump campaign took the stance it'd end the Iran Deal? It was by Mike Pence on 10/12/2016 in Raleigh: "Men &amp; women, the truth of the matter is, when Donald Trump becomes president of the United States of America, we're going to rip up the Iran deal."

In #AZ08, issue at forefront of minds: Thursday's teacher walkout/public education funding. I'll acknowledge my skepticism of THIS district's willingness to shift. But numerous GOP to Independent voters over the last week articulated frustration with AZ GOP. More than anecdotal.
Reflections from #AZ08: In 2018, the local issues are going to drive these House races. In PA18, you could make a contention that Conor Lamb's support, and Saccone's hedging, of legislation to fulfill coal miners' pension benefits changed the race. 627 votes. Labor folks engaged.

Folks, it's worth sticking around in #AZ08. 	Lesko: 52.9%	Tipirneni: 47.1%	Probably 75-80% of the vote is in. These results are based off early ballots mailed in. About half of this leftover sum will be day-of voters &amp; other half is early ballots turned in at poll today. https://t.co/J3JZGYzeUT
So let's do some math ‚Äì 150,000 early ballots were mailed back in &amp; have been counted.

To note #AZ08: About 20 minutes away from early ballot results coming in. Will this be the outcome? Roughly 80% of the voting result will be released at that time. The other 20% who voted today will roll into the evening. So if this is a few %, hold on folks.

Another stat: 80% of the ballots thus far are from folk 55+. Welcome to #AZ08.
Thus far, AZ Secretary of State Michele Reagan says early ballot returns are coming in at normal numbers--48% of those returned are from Republican voters; 28% from Democrats; 23% from Independents. Normal numbers for the district.
A good follow over the next week (and beyond): @garrett_Archer from the AZ Secretary of State's office. He's looking at the numbers from #AZ08 as they come in.
Some early ballot numbers to consider thus far: Early ballots in #AZ08 went out March 28. 140,000 have been returned. AZ Sec. of State's office is predicting turnout to finish at about 280,000. In 2016: 340,000. In 2014: 200,000. So meet me in the middle.

Pence, at the end of his stump, ends with suggestion to pray--&gt;"Not so much pray for a cause or for any particular candidate or party, but for America. Cause America matters. Far beyond our shores."
Pence in MN to about 350 folk: ‚ÄúSo go tell the story of what‚Äôs happening in America among your friends, your families and your loved ones. Go tell ‚Äòem what they‚Äôre not hearing on most of their cable television networks. Tell them about their great congressional leaders.‚Äù

Arpaio has not held any campaign events ahead of August primary. But he has universal name ID. And recall, he raised $12.8 million for his 2016 sheriff's bid. That's more than Mark Kirk, a then-vulnerable GOP incumbent for senator raised. And that was for his sheriff's race(!).
Arpaio last week: "You know I'm the only one that could beat [Sinema]--you know that right?"
Joe Arpaio on Jeff Flake's NH trip: "I have a better chance of being president than Flake does...why is he going up to NH? ... Trump wants to expand space travel. Maybe he ought to ask Flake if he would like to volunteer for the first flight to Mars."
Arpaio, running for sheriff in 1992, broke cmpgn pledge to turn sheriff into non-political, county-appointed position. ‚ÄúCome on, I would have survived if I was appointed? I‚Äôd been fired in 2 minutes! That was the mistake I made‚ÄîI had said I‚Äôd do one term. Well, it was different‚Äù
‚ÄúThe sheriff before [Agnos]‚ÄîI gave him a few bucks, and [Agnos] probably found out about it. So he got back at me by taking away my travel account," Arpaio said. Wife Ava added: ‚ÄúIt was a nice account." Joe followed: ‚ÄúOne of the biggest."
Arpaio, from 1982 to 1992, worked for his wife Ava's travel agency. He ran for office after incumbent GOP Sheriff Tom Agnos cancelled dept's contract with the Arpaio travel company. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a little quirk, and it‚Äôs true. I probably never would have run.‚Äù
Arpaio worked 25 years in top spots for DEA. To me other night on major drug kingpins: "When you have tough penalties for drugs, that is a deterrent, and for those amateurs who want to get hooked up with the big boys, you're going to have to face it &amp; deal w/ the death penalty."
DC streets used to know young Arpaio: After serving 4 yrs in Army, he came to DC as a police officer, patrolling around 14th &amp; U streets, which he called ‚Äúthe toughest beat in America. It was all black. Tough. And I walked the beat by myself with a nightstick and black jack.‚Äù
Arpaio emphatically states he "cannot mix" legal defense $$ w/ cmpgn $$. But in Sept, he sent email saying he owed $300k in bills. Now: Arpaio acknowledges still raising legal $$ amid cmpgn. ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm still raising money. It costs a lot of money to defend yourself.‚Äù
Get Ready: Joe Arpaio intends to release in the next few weeks--&gt; ‚ÄúI have stuff that pertains to what‚Äôs going on in Washington‚Äîright now‚Äîwith the dossier."
Arpaio on Dreamers: ‚ÄúLittle by little, when you come across [a DREAMer], ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre going back. But, but, we want you to go back because, you know what, we want you to know where you were born and the country you came from.‚Äô‚Äù
Arpaio's plan for the 1.8 million Dreamers in the U.S.: Send them back to their native countries to serve as "ambassadors" for America. State Dept. would oversee: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a lot of openings now anyway. I‚Äôm sure they can hire a few extra to take care of this problem.‚Äù https://t.co/NB0krKWqvy
Asked about NAFTA, a crucial trade agreement to the Arizona economy, Arpaio: "The president is always right. I'm going to support the president's agenda."
Asked which part of the tax reform measure signed into law by President Trump in January would most benefit Arizonans, Arpaio mentioned Arizonans ‚Äúgetting into the middle class.‚Äù He wouldn't name a specific aspect besides tax cuts being "great."
When asked about Arizona's expansion of Medicaid, Arpaio: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have the‚Äîthe jury is out on that. I haven‚Äôt studied that. Have the nuts and bolts. So that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll have to look at‚Äîhow it effects Arizona because I want to make sure that Arizona is taken care of."
When asked whether he supported efforts to repeal the individual mandate as part of Obamacare, Arpaio answered: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have all the facts on that yet. I didn‚Äôt study it.‚Äù
After asking Arpaio a series of policy questions, or "technical questions" as he called them, the Senate candidate told me: "When you're asking me now, don't forget: I just made a decision to run. Instead of looking at the sports page, I've got to start looking at the newspaper."
Here's a thread on Joe Arpaio, a legitimate candidate for the U.S. Senate in Arizona and the former 24-year sheriff of Maricopa County. The man who hailed himself as "America's Toughest Sheriff." https://t.co/En498onOJS

Pence on administration --&gt; The world is taking notice again as we lead on the world stage.
Pence has spent the last few minutes at NH tax policy event talking about efforts to combat opioid addiction. Says intend to cut opioid prescriptions by 1/3. Also says crackdown on drug dealers will include "death penalty" for worst kingpins.
Pence, while in NH, will be going to the other end of this downtown Manchester hotel for a fundraiser on behalf of GOP incumbent NH Gov. Chris Sununu. Tells this crowd "the leadership" of Sununu "has put New Hampshire first."
The VP, in NH, just rattled off a litany of pluses out this spending bill ($$ for school safety, opioids, troops): "Growth is back, confidence is back, and I stand before you today to say America is back. And we‚Äôre just getting started." https://t.co/5dyZZypVb2
Pence also touts "nearly $4 billion to combat the opioid crisis" in the spending bill. He says it's more money than has ever been spent to combat the drug problem.
Pence to NH crowd just now: Pres. Trump promised in the wake of Parkland, Florida, that we would take action, and thanks to the president‚Äôs leadership‚Ä¶[spending bill will include] $2 billion to improve school safety and will improve our criminal background check system.
Pence says the spending bill will give troops their biggest pay raise in the last ten years.

Flake in NH: "It is a measure of how far we have fallen that we have to fight for...the preservation of basic norms, such as the [AG] is not the president‚Äôs personal lawyer, and the FBI director does not owe the president personal loyalty but rather loyalty to the Constitution."
Flake: "a rejection of the optimistic vision of [Reagan], the extraordinary decency of [H.W.], the principled, constitutionalism of [Goldwater]. What does it say that we have instead succumbed to what can only be described as a propaganda-fueled, dystopian view of conservatism."
Flake on Trump's "destruction"---&gt; "Such is the power of the president to either build or destroy. And the irony should not escape us here that someone‚Äôs name who became known to us as a builder would have such a penchant for destruction."
Flake on Trump: "We will get through this, and when we do, perhaps what will be most remembered from this period will be the president‚Äôs war on objective reality and the reflexive impulse to speak falsely." https://t.co/pk7mMWWmOL
Jeff Flake in NH: "Say hypothetically in 2018, we have a libertine, budget-busting president who exudes chaos and dotes on authoritarians, who has replaced the State Department with Twitter, lives in the golden palace when he‚Äôs not in the White House, and he‚Äôs the conservative." https://t.co/e8J4adtkPU

Also new overnight: I‚Äôm told by Rick Saccone‚Äôs general consultant that Saccone WILL run for Congress, again, in 2018. On March 20, he will turn in qualifying petitions to run in the new PA-14, which is outside of where he currently lives. But it‚Äôs a more GOP-friendly district.
@ccorbisiero I was down south with Gina Ortiz Jones three weeks ago. We‚Äôve got a big primary season ahead. I named the actual candidate and the two  congressmen that came to PA-18 to campaign with him.
And again, these are the outstanding ballots that the Saccone campaign is waiting on. Last night, I was told by the campaign it could be all the way until March 20 until we hear a plan from them. Those uncounted ballots: https://t.co/bGgP5DX1w0
To be fair to PA-18 GOP candidate, the Saccone campaign is understandably awaiting those outstanding ballots to come in. When they departed HQ last night, Washington County absentee ballots were still out &amp; was not fully clear how many provisional/military ballots were out there.
Sooo...will Roy Moore or Rick Saccone concede first? https://t.co/1ZMimV14ZF

George P. Bush also has caught himself in a frenzy over his oversight of the renovation plans of the historic Alamo in San Antonio. Many voters named this as their reason for not backing Bush tomorrow. @claireallbright with a great breakdown on the uproar: https://t.co/vXa5VmSS9d

Corker: "I actually have nothing but respect for both her &amp; the DEM canddte in that both of them would not have chosen to run if I had continued on" https://t.co/74UPvRn28Y
That said, DEM Phil Bredesen, the former Nashville mayor &amp; two-term governor, has been running his campaign across the state for 2+ months now. In the last two weeks, he's been from Memphis to Chattanooga to Nashville to Murfreesboro. Bredesen won his GOV re-elect 68% to 30%.
It's now been two weeks since Bob Corker opened up the prospect of jumping back into the race. To note: Tennessee has a late primary--August 5. And Corker already has +$6M in campaign funds ready to go.
