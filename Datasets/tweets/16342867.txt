The handgun used by #MPHS shooter had been kept in the center console of his father's truck along with an extra magazine.
#MPHS teacher Megan Silberberger to police: She "did not see him shoot any students. I only saw him shoot himself when I came towards him."
#MPHS shooter had been missing school, was failing two classes. He was told Oct. 22 he had to get his grades up or no football.
First #MPHS report story up now: http://t.co/Cfn2ahIcNc
#MPHS shooter was suspended for 3 days in the week before the violence. He got in a fight on Oct. 14 at football practice.
Multiple witnesses said #MPHS shooter's face was blank. His hands shook as he reloaded.
#MPHS shooter asked several friends to skip class and meet in the cafeteria. He later sent a text saying he wanted their graves next to his.
#MPHS detectives found confusing scene strewn with backpacks and lunches. Witnesses gave conflicting details on sights, sounds.
While #MPHS shooter was reloading, a teacher went toward him to stop him. Before she reached him, he took his own life.
#MPHS detectives say motive for the shooting is uncertain, but it clearly was planned. Shooter wanted his friends to die with him.
