And 2) the Sproul tributes are important not because he should be exalted in any way, but because they draw attention back to the One he exalted through his life and ministry.

@joelcomiskey I've been memorizing Ps 40. (I'm up to verse 16; it's my first attempt at memorizing an entire chapter of the bible.) When you memorize &amp; repeat verses over &amp; over, their meaning becomes more intimate to you. It's special to me now to see Ps 40 quoted--it's like seeing a friend.
Oh my goodness, why am I only just now following @RobGMacfarlane?? Where have I been all this time?
@Puritan2000 I understood; I just don't think using that label directs people within. You're totally right that most people don't get the seriousness of the flesh, and that's a huge problem. But I think this comparison would cause them to see their actions as otherly rather than inherent.
@Puritan2000 Or they're acting like humans, which is awful enough. Calling it satanic adds an otherly-ness to it that points away from the inherent ugliness of the flesh man.
@Puritan2000 OK, but is it more important to arrest attention or to be biblically accurate? People need to be made aware of how truly depraved and despicable the human condition actually is. Calling sinful behavior "satanic" redirects focus from us to him.
@Puritan2000 I think there's a danger in seeing sin as supernatural rather than ingrained in our fallen humanity. Why would we need to act like Satan, when acting like a human is evil enough? James 4--it's our own desires that do us in. Satan, of course, is more than happy to assist.

There. You guys just got a play-by-play of a very boring person's afternoon. Now I'm going to go back to reading Duke tweets &amp; sipping tea.
The thing I love about walking is that it turns really lame, mundane stuff‚Äîlike walking to McD's on a snow day‚Äîinto little adventures.
I don't eat fast food too much anymore, but I probably should make the rule that I can only eat at these places if I walk there. üòã
It was quite a workout getting here, as the sidewalks have not been shoveled.
I decided to walk to McDonald's, where I'm tweeting all of this from. I don't really want anything from McD's. Except tea. I always want tea
So far I haven't gotten too stir crazy, but I did leave the house (on foot) to have a change of scenery.
I have claustrophobia, so I get panicky when I feel trapped (it's the main reason I hate flying). Being snowed in can trigger it.
And I'm well-prepared, too. Dog &amp; I are taken care of. I even managed to fill up the bird feeders for my neighborhood cardinals &amp; bluebirds.
From storm-prep crowds on Thursday to cabin fever today...I've been in an awesome mood.

I'm not an optimistic person by nature, but once I attach hope to something, I'll remain hopeful to the end. Past all reason.
