@rdelevan @cianflah Boards not responsible for editorial or day to day decisions. They set strategy and try to ensure financial stability. Day to day running is down to the executive and editors. Personally, I think we need a wider media debate about how/ when/ if to allow hate-mongers on air.

@FreelanceWebDev Happy to meet with you any time.
@FreelanceWebDev Clearly, you don‚Äôt know me or my work at all. Goodbye.
@FreelanceWebDev Didn‚Äôt say that at all. Happy to debate this with you but not through an anonymous Twitter account. In person any time that suits you. I share many of your concerns about way media covering extremists.
@FreelanceWebDev Er, number one I‚Äôm not a journalist. Two, I am not advocating or excusing anyone voting for racist candidates. I am trying to understand how to reach people who are voting to protect their privilege so I can show them the horrible damage it‚Äôs doing to society.
@FreelanceWebDev Journalists have an obligation to doggedly interrogate viewpoints. They also have an obligation to ensure that lies &amp; misinformation are robustly challenged with facts. Also, to not to become an instrument of spreading hate speech and/ or propaganda. Words have consequences.
@MariaWalshbiz @women4election Will two hours be enough?!
@philipoconnor @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand Agree completely.
@faduda @philipoconnor @UnaMullally @irishstand And let me emphasize again that I was - and am - horrified by the way they voted. Don‚Äôt talk to them anymore really but I am trying to understand how to get under their fear to dismantle it and help them find their humanity again. Fear divides. Understanding brings us together.
@FreelanceWebDev @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand Agree.
@moppety An excellent question. I think a great deal about this... still do t have a answer.
@faduda @philipoconnor @UnaMullally @irishstand And then that‚Äôs the end of the debate. What happens now that they - and we - have all said they‚Äôre racists?
@philipoconnor @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand Agree completely but if we force them to ‚Äúown it‚Äù by saying ‚ÄúI voted for a racist‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am a racist‚Äù what happens then? Still room for discussion/ debate?

@philipoconnor @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand I agree with you about the consequences of their vote and how it‚Äôs weaponised. Yet they frame it differently in their heads to justify it.
@philipoconnor @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand How many of those voters have either of you spoken to? I would strongly encourage those discussions. It was eye-opening for me. Still don‚Äôt agree w/ them but understand more now how the monster appeals to and feeds their fear. Human individual + human individual = understanding.
@philipoconnor @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand The way to turn things around - to become kinder again as a nation and world - is to listen to their fear. To introduce them to people who are not like them. To break down walls &amp; build connections. Anger + anger = war.
@philipoconnor @faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand Voting for white Republican candidates does not automatically make you a racist. They may be voting - as many I personally know are - to maintain economic and social privilege. Again, I don‚Äôt agree but shutting down conversation by calling them racist does not change minds.

@faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand They want to maintain their privilege over ‚Äúless educated‚Äù white people too. Or white people who are not in their profession, community, social circle...
@faduda @UnaMullally @irishstand No, they‚Äôre not. Some certainly but that‚Äôs really too narrow a definition. They‚Äôre voting to maintain their privilege. I grew up there and am still in touch with many people in those communities. I don‚Äôt agree with them but I still listen.

@KathOMeara Oh yeah. He‚Äôll be on fire now.
@AineMulloy @StartupWeekDub It‚Äôs hard as well but so worth it both professionally and personally.
@AineMulloy @StartupWeekDub Also, don‚Äôt stick with your nationality all the time. Go where Irish people go and say hello, participate in the culture, go to events, conferences, pubs, music venues, parks, museums, libraries, park, gym, beaches. Do not be invisible. Talk to people. They‚Äôre generally lovely.
@AineMulloy @StartupWeekDub Coming here from the states I had zero contacts. Everyone had a huge advantage over me. Despite being an introvert, I made a point of meeting loads of people every week. This was largely down to advice from my biz editor &amp; editor that it was a numbers game. Biz gold.
@UnaMullally Did I know that American employers often send employees a list of candidates that they approve of?
@UnaMullally One thing many commentators miss, but that I‚Äôve discussed on @irishstand podcast, is that they‚Äôre voting to maintain their economic security - which depends almost entirely on wealthy white men. Also voting to ensure their white kids maintain privilege. Not right but there it is.

@dermotcasey @sineadgibney @sundaybusiness The best indicator of a happy life = strong intimate (not necessarily sexual) relationships. Violent porn is breaking people‚Äôs ability to form that kind of relationship. Hugely damaging to our social, family &amp; community fabric.
@Mrodonoghue @dermotcasey @sineadgibney @sundaybusiness I think in the US it‚Äôs a pretty general audience - men and women - of all ages. It‚Äôs main message is fear. Women should be afraid, very afraid. The world is full of predators, etc.
@dermotcasey @sineadgibney @sundaybusiness This thinking/ messages also benefit sales in the gun industry (no one is safe - esp white women - anywhere) defense contractors &amp; white supremacist movements. No coincidence that #Charlottesville incidents involved some military &amp; defense contractor workers.
@dermotcasey @sineadgibney @sundaybusiness Fear and hatred. It‚Äôs been a white, Christian, heterosexual man‚Äôs world for centuries &amp; that‚Äôs changing so people find ways to exploit men‚Äôs fears for financial gain &amp; to promote their own world view &amp; maintain their power.

@dermotcasey @sineadgibney @sundaybusiness For at least a decade, the rape and/or torture of women has been a common theme on TV and in film.
