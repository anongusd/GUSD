@EricShapiro3 SHALL I GO ON ?
@EricShapiro3 Bernie: Claimed Hillary is an establishment politician, while he has been in elected office for a total of 35 years, Hillary only 12.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie: Claimed Hillary is dishonest, yet cannot provide a single example; Politifact rated Hillary Clinton most honest candidate among all presidential hopefuls in 2016, including Bernie Sanders.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie; Tad Devine also represented Monsanto, Phillip Morris, Pfizer, Verizon, Microsoft, as their attorney.	‚Ä¢ Paid his wife Jane Sanders YUGE for her work/role in the campaign, while refusing to release tax returns as everything is in Jane's name, not his.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie Railed against Superdelegates as "establishment corruption," in which his top advisor Tad Devine was the architect of the very Superdelegate system in the early 1980's; then claimed he would win by "persuading"/stealing said Superdelegates from Hillary.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie Claimed he was the "People's Choice" while Hillary was ahead in the popular vote by 3.5 MILLION votes.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie Claimed the Human Right's Campaign and Planned Parenthood, even Civil Rights hero's like Congressman John Lewis are the "establishment".	‚Ä¢ Claimed to poll better against GOP candidates than Hillary, Politifact rated claim as False.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie claimed to have a more progressive record advocating LGBT and Women's Rights, actual record and accomplishments prove otherwise, Hillary Clinton is more accomplished on both accounts.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie's campaign staff illegally posed as union workers in Nevada.	‚Ä¢ Inflated open caucuses.	‚Ä¢ Wrote a rape fantasy essay.	‚Ä¢ Claimed Donald Trump‚Äôs remarks on abortion and punishing women is a distraction from "real issues".

@EricShapiro3 Bernie: Received giant donations from unknown foreign contributors which the FEC order Bernie to repay.	‚Ä¢ Claimed endorsements that actually endorsed Hillary.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie; The fact he does take corporate contributions and he has received millions from all the entities/and employees he attacked Hillary for.	‚Ä¢ Was cited for campaign contribution violations six times by the FEC.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie: Constantly implied Hillary has control over the SuperPACs that were backing her campaign, which is factually false and illegal for a campaign to coordinate with a SuperPAC. Same with those supporting Bernie's campaign. A candidate has no control over SuperPACs,
@EricShapiro3 Bernie: ‚Ä¢ Voted against the closure of Guantanamo Bay.	‚Ä¢ Voted YES on continuing intelligence gathering without civil oversight (HR 5020).	‚Ä¢ Had 6 SuperPACs backing his campaign in 2016 [that we know of], of which 3 were GOP SuperPACs.

@EricShapiro3 Bernie: The fact that the NRA helped finance Bernie's re-election campaign in Vermont.	‚Ä¢ Voted to dump nuclear waste in Sierra Blanca, Texas and Barnwell, South Carolina.
@EricShapiro3 Bernie: Voted for the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.	‚Ä¢ Voted against Amber Alerts.	‚Ä¢ Voted against the Brady Bill five times.	‚Ä¢ Voted against CDC research on gun violence.
