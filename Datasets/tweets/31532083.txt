Stone also said he wasn‚Äôt sure which of his volunteers found the photo of Judge Jackson. He wasn‚Äôt even sure the names of all his volunteers.
Stone‚Äôs entire argument that a gag order would endanger his income from speaking and writing crumbled with a single question from the judge, who asked whether he‚Äôs paid to talk specifically about the Russia investigation. He said no.

This was a remarkable court hearing. Roger Stone took the stand to talk about the Instagram post, but struggled  under withering questions from the judge and prosecutors.

President Trump brushes off allegations that he's threatened Michael Cohen. 		"He's only been threatened by the truth."

It's clear that all of this has drawn scrutiny from Robert Mueller.		In a court filing, the special counsel said Michael Cohen "described the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries."
But did the president talk to Michael Cohen about his testimony?		"I don't know if the president had an individual conversation with him," Rudy Giuliani told me.

@lrozen Not sure
When did Paul Manafort meet with Konstantin Kilimnik in Madrid? It seems like it happened during the presidential campaign. Why? The lawyers write "that  these occurrences happened during a period when Mr. Manafort was managing a U.S.	presidential campaign."

We don't know what kind of polling data Paul Manafort provided Konstantin Kilimnik. But it could have given Russians valuable insight at a time when Moscow was undertaking a covert effort to sway the election to Donald Trump. https://t.co/rJ8uCmcZNS
Paul Manafort shared polling data with Russian during presidential campaign, filing asserts	 https://t.co/rJ8uCmcZNS
@zachsdorfman Right, simply forwarding a CNN poll wouldn't seem to be that interesting.
@zachsdorfman Can't wait to find out one way or another
@zachsdorfman Do we know that it's private polling data?
And on and on we go https://t.co/sOnuq0JRur
According to this court filing, Paul Manafort may have shared presidential polling data with Konstantin Kilimnik, his business partner in Ukraine who allegedly has ties to Russian intelligence
Today's court filing is a lesson in poor redacting. You can copy and paste the text underneath the black boxes in Paul Manafort's new court filing.
Paul Manafort is suffering from gout, depression and anxiety, according to his lawyers https://t.co/HaiUiJQztp
Manafort has met with prosecutors and investigators a dozen times, and he testified twice before the grand jury, according to defense attorneys
We finally have Paul Manafort's response to allegations he lied to prosecutors after agreeing to cooperate. His lawyers reject the allegations, saying he "provided complete and truthful information to the best of his ability."

RT @latimespolitics: Russian lawyer at Trump Tower meeting charged in separate case https://t.co/LengQY4hHC
One thing we don't know ‚Äî why was this indictment unsealed today? It was filed on Dec. 20.
Key issue in the indictment ‚Äî Natalia V. Veselnitskaya has close ties to Kremlin officials, specifically the prosecutor general. This bolsters our understanding of the Trump Tower meeting with Trump campaign officials
The case was brought by the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, not the special counsel. The case involves her alleged attempt to interfere with a federal money laundering investigation targeting a Russian company.
The Russian lawyer involved in the Trump Tower meeting, Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, has been indicted for obstruction of justice in a case unrelated to the collusion investigation. https://t.co/98RGZOvXKD

Here's the reason why Cohen's lies were so important, according to Mueller's office https://t.co/qUVVzEoiVN
"However, the defendant has taken significant steps to mitigate his criminal conduct" and "gone to significant lengths to assist the Special Counsel's investigation" by providing "credible" information.
Robert Mueller is taking a different approach, not recommending any particular sentence. Cohen's crime (lying to Congress about a potential Russian real estate deal) was "serious."
We're still waiting for special counsel Robert Mueller's recommendation, but this one is scathing. "Cohen managed to commit a panoply of	serious crimes, all while holding himself out as a licensed attorney and upstanding member of the	bar."
U.S. attorney in Manhattan says Michael Cohen should face a "substantial term of imprisonment" for his crimes ‚Äî tax evasion, bank fraud, campaign finance violations for arranging hush money payments

Here's the answer, from someone who would know https://t.co/R1ugTmKZxA
Well, this press conference has fully gone off the rails as Trump insults individual reporters and calls them "rude" and the "enemy of the people" when they spread "fake news."
The caravan comes up when asked by CNN about demonizing immigrants. "I consider it an invasion," Trump says.
Has it ever been confirmed that Trump's tax returns are actually under audit? Or are we just taking the president's word for it?
I'm sure @susannecraig, @DavidBarstow and @russbuettner would like the opportunity to put that to the test https://t.co/8pdMEm95Yr
Now that the election is over, I don't think there's been a single mention of the migrant caravan during this press conference
"I will blame them," Trump says when asked about what happens if he doesn't find bipartisan ground with Democrats. That seems like a safe bet.

RT @JaneMayerNYer: @NatashaBertrand It‚Äôs just a stupid hoax.
@commiegirl1 Yeah, their trajectory has been one of the interesting subplots of the Trump era.
@maxzimbert I guess, but I'm not sure what the misdirection is supposed to be. Was there really a woman offered money to accuse Mueller? Or were those emails to reporters part of the hoax?
Here's a tweet from Burkman last year ‚Äî "I can produce 3 women to say anything bout anybody." (h/t @OrneryLibrarian) https://t.co/fPwS1iEkEb
Now the Gateway Pundit has published a "Confidential Raw Intelligence Document" that includes allegations against Mueller.
@commiegirl1 @pattmlatimes @HillReporter I'm sharing because the screenshots here are interesting.
So what is actually happening here? I'm not sure, but it's bizarre stuff.
The website @HillReporter has been piecing together evidence that Burkman has teamed up with Jacob Wohl, a right-wing tweeter, to spread these allegations https://t.co/8AumXpOZX2
Someone also reached out to reporters nearly two weeks ago saying they were offered money to make false claims against Mueller. Here's an example. https://t.co/hOWlSP4b7c
More recently, Burkman has been targeting Mueller. Here's an example from earlier this year. https://t.co/XsioJa5qkX
The conspiracy theory gained traction on Fox News as well, and it's been very painful for Rich's family. Here's some background on that. https://t.co/RdAHlvGNNw
Burkman is best known for launching his own "investigation" of the Seth Rich murder. Some believe, without evidence, that Rich was killed because he was Wikileaks' source for leaked emails.
In addition, a lobbyist and conspiracy theorist named Jack Burkman is promising to announce allegations of sexual assault against Mueller on Thursday
There's some very strange stuff happening right now. For starters, the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to investigate allegations that women were offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller
This has been a long time coming. https://t.co/p3Jqj1NBT1
