@georg2005 @JunkScience I don’t use the term denier.
@JunkScience Steve:as you know,NCA is a peer-reviewed scientific report,authored by career government scientists and academic scientists,with overall conclusions-co2 traps heat,warms the planet,&amp;that warming causes harm-that line up with the findings of decades  of peer-reviewed studies.
@wattsupwiththat @JunkScience @ChicoER @m_mwolcott But he does deny established climate science.For example, the NCA,a comprehensive peer-reviewed study produced by 13 federal agencies -this is clearly established science -says that increased CO2 is harmful to humans.Dr.Happer denies this.He says increased CO2 is good for humans.
@wattsupwiththat @JunkScience @ChicoER @m_mwolcott Can you point to a problem in the article? What in the article appears to have been done without care?
@JunkScience Steve:I hate that word.Sometimes it’s slipped in by editors for expedience. “person x,who does not accept the established science of human-caused climate change,” is a mouthful,&amp; sometimes it gets replaced with this shorthand.I need to be more careful to ensure it doesn’t happen.
@wattsupwiththat @NYT @AP 1. the headline does not contain the word “denier.” “Denialist” might sound similar, but it’s a different word. 2. It’s hard to take criticism of an article seriously if the critic has not read the article. Read the article!
@wattsupwiththat @NYT @AP Also, I’d suggest critics focus on the reported content. It uses Happer’s own quotations to describe his https://t.co/JHG0aRgnYt quotes the WH doc on why he would be given a role on this panel, &amp; quotes the reports cited in that doc. I’d welcome criticism based on the reporting.
@wattsupwiththat @NYT @AP The headline does not use the word “denier.”
@wattsupwiththat @NYT @AP Totally agree that this word should not be used in this context! That’s why I don’t use it. I’m also unclear on where I’ve denigrated Dr. Halper? I quoted him directly, and accurately reported that his views are at odds with mainstream climate science-which he himself asserts!

Thanks for your great questions - if you have any others, I'll try to answer them later.
@finn_andrew Doubtful. Although they will have far, far more impact on lowering emissions than will any decision on the Keystone.
@Roskec3 If a state refuses to submit a compliance plan,EPA can step in &amp; force the state to follow a federally-authored reg.
@eliashinckley After failure of cap&amp;trade &amp; House GOP takeover in 2010,Obama lost hope of getting any  #climate bill through Congress.
@ericwanderson No.The rule measures state's reductions in their emissions rate.What counts is cutting what they burn.
@mchillydog CO2 capture tech. not yet commercially viable.And it captures new CO2 emitted from coal plants,not the stuff already out there.
@puja_sangar 2. The rules won't totally kill coal-EPA anticipates coal still 30 % of U.S. power mix in 2030.But demand declining, for sure.
@puja_sangar 1. The new rules will be a hit on coal producers.They will definitely erode U.S. demand for coal.
@mchillydog No realistic way to reduce CO2 currently in the atmosphere. EPA rule will slow the rate of future emissions.
@Victor77Te 3.Analysts also say India's new President unlikely to be enthusiastic about climate policy.
@Victor77Te 2. The hope was the reg. will give U.S. leverage to urge other countries to agree to carbon cuts.But still a long way to go.
@Victor77Te 1. Today,China announced it will cap carbon pollution.1 day after Obama announces carbon cut policy.Analysts say no coincidence.
@hacker_adi 2.Using EPA regs was always the last choice.But watch for carbon tax debate to revive in coming yrs,in context of tax reform
@hacker_adi 1. The #climate bill he tried to push thru Congress would have put a price on carbon.But 4 now, carbon tax/price DOA on CapHill
@Hermann725 2. But it took them this long to actually write the regulation. It's hard stuff. Many amazed they made Obama's June deadline.
@Hermann725 1) He tried to pass a #climate bill thru Congress in 1st term.After that failed,he planned, from start of 2nd term, to use EPA.
@pauldickenson They do.Analysts say the rule= about 17% cut from 2012 levels. #climate
@JennaMC_Laugh 2)In order to cut enough to do what scientists say is necessary, next Pres. will have to do more-like pass carbon price.
@JennaMC_Laugh 1)This plan calls for 30 % cut by 2030-prob. the most Obama can get w.out Congress.
@Jeter2retire 2) And the solutions to climate change require huge policy shifts -- disruptive changes to global energy systems &amp; economy.
@Jeter2retire 1) Great q! Climate change can affect US &amp; global economy,food and water supply,foreign policy, national security.
