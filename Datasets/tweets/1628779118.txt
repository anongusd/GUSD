Rezoning for solar would show the community is embracing a future they can help shape, rather than fueling their environments own destruction by refusing alternative energy but accepting dozens of cookie cutter homes.
It breaks my heart every time I go to my hometown now. Progress is good, but the sleepy, tight knit community I grew up in is changing and expanding at a rate that is altering a lot of the reason I loved it so much.
Do I want to see the farms in my hometown gone? NO! I want farmers to keep farming. I worked on one of those farms for 6 years, and wish all farmers success. But when farmers are having to sell, I'd rather they explore alternatives that are different than strict residential.
This is my hometown. The arguments against the array: "but the farm is what we want/solar will ruin the community" is ridiculous b/c a large # of farms in town have been converted to massive neighborhoods and changed the very fabric of the place I grew up  https://t.co/hy7uwCXxK5

All of this is to say, one class can change your life, provide definitive meaning to your daily actions, and alter the course of your professional aspirations. Dare to take the scary classes. You'll probably not regret it.
I dont think I'll ever give up eggs, but in this new year, I will work diligently to modify how much egg I eat, and source it from local farmers and friends who manage sustainable (in the truest sense of the word) operations 16/
8 years ago, I ate my last piece of meat. No pork, beef or chicken in my life. But eggs have been a part of my daily diet. I've known the egg industry has it's own issues, but I've been scared to adjust this last piece of my diet 15/
All this has since drilled in me a desire to know WHERE my food comes from, HOW it is produced and WHO is producing it. I'm not perfect by any means 14/
I started studying legal scholarship on the issue, and came to find out that large  animal feeding operations had successfully stymied efforts from local communities to mitigate the impacts of emissions from their operations all across the US 13/
What was most disheartening about my research was how I came to find out the George W. Bush adminstration established an advisory board to look at this very issue, but kept punting decisionmaking. In my opinion this is because the studies were stacked with industry interests 12/
It also exposed me to the environmental injustices that exist around these massive operations, and was one of the first times in my privileged life that I realized just how bad things could be for marginalized populations 11/
My research led me to understanding the atmospheric transport mechanisms of ammonia, the particulates it can form, and long range impacts to air quality, waterways and coastal estuaries 10/
Now, to actually do the science would take a LOT of funding and time, so I sat down to do a comprehensive literature review of the state of science on the impacts of ammonia emissions from concentrated animal feeding operations 9/
After the ethics course concluded, it was time for me to pick a senior thesis. I hemmed and hawed and was over a month late in deciding my topic. Late one night, it hit me - let's examine the impacts of industrial agriculture on the local environment. 8/
But the environmental scientist in me was also interested in what this meant for the surrounding environment. The water and air quality of the local community, and what, if any, regional impacts these CAFOS had 7/
In the ethics class, we learned early on what a concentrated animal feeding operation is. I was aghast. The emotional response to the conditions that animals were tightly confined in spaces and often subjected to torturous conditions struck a cord 6/
I thought I had familiarity with the system, because heck, the system I knew was helping finance my way through college, one shift of blueberry picking at a time 5/
At the time, I had no idea what the US food system really looked like. I grew up in a small farming community in MD, where kids show cows at the local fair. I myself worked on a farm for 6 years, picking berries, greens and flowers over multiple growing seasons 4/
That class, taught by Barrett Emerick, turned out to be the most profoundly influential course I ever took in my life. Our ethical focus that semester was (lossely) the ethics of animal husbandry, and we examined the issue from many perspectives 3/
8 years ago this month, I was a Junior at a small liberal arts college in Southern Maryland. I signed up for an Environmental Ethics class to compliment my science and policy academic foundation, and stretch the powers of my mind into uncharted academic areas 2/

While my new job starts Wednesday, I have a 30-day window where I won't have health insurance. Being the responsible adult that I pretend to be, I went to sign up for healthcare through the marketplace. Unfortunately, the 'effective' date of coverage is 32 days from now...

Today @MeetThePress is all about climate change. Glad to see the last show of the year highlighting such an important issue. Let's do more of this.

Anyways, I'm disgusted by Amazon and will leave it at that.
That, along with delivery robots plying the streets of DC and Whole Foods being bought out.
TBH my biggest breaking point was when I was out on an isolated lobstering community in Maine, whose mail is delivered by boat. They recently had to build a new mail shed WHOLLY BECAUSE the number of amazon boxes residents were ordering.
Over the past year, I have been actively going out of my way to not purchase items from Amazon. A futile, individual, likely meaningless protest of the gross capitalistic leach that is Amazon, but a protest nonetheless.
Student loans, a career in the enviro field &amp; already inflated prices mean I already cant afford to buy a house in my city. With Amazon coming, the likelihood of me ever investing in property is dwindling before my young, hopeful eyes. F*cking sucks.  https://t.co/LGsMXWdVNj

Additional answers: YES, competitive research program investment for tech development and lowering the cost of existing tools.
Senator Markey asks if we need more funding to HABS. Answer: yes. More models, more sensors to measure what is going in in the ocean. Once you have that infrastructure, you can do better predictions and early warning.
Following the Peter's line of questioning, witnesses respond to question on climate change saying the increased warmth and events in Alaska are a massive threat to indigenous communities
Senator Peters suggests there is some resistance in the House to the HABS reauthorization bill. Witnesses respond saying this program is critical and it would be a shame for authorization to lapse.
In Great Lakes, need to do more research into how P is flowing off of farm fields and how we can smartly address that.
Digging into questions now: research gaps listed include...what is fueling FL Red Tide and why isn't it ending.
Patrick Neu speaks about the impact of HABS to the outdoor recreation and angling community. Discusses how blooms dictate how and where people fish.
Bryan Stubbs says solutions to HABS lie in part to investment in innovation and technology.
Next, Ivory Engstrom speaks on new tools for detecting HABS in timely manner, including IFCB and ESP which have been deployed to detect aquaculture and drinking water impacts. NOAA funding has been critical to develop these tools.
Says HABS are serious and growing problem that requires comprehensive, consistent and sustained response at national level. Calls for increased funding and competitive research for HABS programs at NOAA and EPA.
First witness, Don Anderson, WHOI.
Nelson urges state(s) to take responsibility for addressing water quality.
Nelson urges House to move on the HAB reauthorization bill, which the Senate moved last year unanimously.
Nelson says: Our sugary white sand beaches should be lined with people this time of year. Instead, the beaches are lined with dead fish.
Senator Nelson speaks about the Blue Green algae and red tide events in southwest Florida. Florida is facing an environmental and economic crisis. It's making people sick.
On September 30th, the National Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act expires on September 30th.
Fishing is impacted by algae blooms. Senator Baldwin tells room that there are over 1 million anglers in Wisconsin, 3rd most in country. These anglers are impacted by blooms.

‚ÄúWe have an obligation to the American people to show value in the use of their taxpayer dollars. Just five months into our time here, we‚Äôve already been able to cut over half a billion dollars from the U.N. peacekeeping budget, and we‚Äôre only getting started.‚Äù
In 2017, Nikki Haley, President Trump‚Äôs ambassador to the U.N., pushed for and won major reductions in funding for peacekeeping troops, including MONUSCO. Haley hailed the cuts as a harbinger of what to expect from the new administration.
But MONUSCO was hampered by funding cuts in the months before violence broke out and the peacekeeping mission was forced to shutter bases in Ituri. The party most responsible for MONUSCO‚Äôs cost-cutting measures? The United States.
A recent study by researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, &amp; the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, found that MONUSCO bases in Congo dramatically lowered violence in nearby regions. Fewer civilians, were killed in areas protected by U.N. troops.
It‚Äôs hard to overstate just how important MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission, is to the region, especially given the weaknesses of the Congolese military and local police forces, and how frequently they‚Äôre implicated in abuses.
Marie Dz‚Äôdza, Dhewedza‚Äôs daughter and Irene Mave‚Äôs aunt. Two weeks ago, she had 5 children. Now, because of the men with machetes, she has 4. Two weeks ago, she was a farmer. She harvested manioc with her two calloused hands. The men with machetes took those, too.
Irene Mave is the youngest. She knows how old she is. Before the attack, she could have held up 6 fingers, one for each year of her life. She can‚Äôt do that anymore. Two weeks ago, the men with machetes took her right arm.
Jesinne Dhewedza, like many in the region from her generation, has no idea how old she actually is. She doesn‚Äôt say what the men with machetes who fell upon her village did to her, but her wizened hands tell part of the story. Two weeks ago, she had 10 fingers. Now she has six.

Senator Whitehouse puts a call out for anyone who might have data and information needs to reach out to his office so that it can be incorporated into an upcoming ocean data bill.
In closing, RADM Gallaudet reminds us of @NOAA top budget priorities: Powering the blue economy and regaining world leadership on weather models. #TheMoreYouNOAA
Autonomy and drones as well. NOAA is focusing on this, and we are part of OSTP select committee on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
RADM Gallaudet answers: environmental DNA is fascinating and important. To understand our living resources. NOAA Ocean exploration program is capturing information that could have anti cancer properties and applications to pharmaceutical industry.
Question: what type of new data are you most excited about?
Shell says: data underpins safety of people and environment of oil and gas and renewables sector. Data is foundation of ensuring safety and coexistence of uses.
Whale sighting success rate may have been impacted. Normal rates are 80-90% but last year it dropped to 30%. Tours have to go offshore and into Canadian waters to find whales. In 2007, 151 trips saw humpacks, 2017 just 5 trips saw whales
Environmental and climatic data overlayed with wildlife data allow us to look at trends. The trend in Gulf of Maine is it is warming, faster than much of the world. This has impacts on marine life, with economic implications.
Real time weather forecasting makes a huge difference.  People can get hurt on whale watch tours if weather turns.
Ecotourism in New England includes whale, shark, dolphin watching, nature and more. Hundreds of thousands of passengers each year, including school groups. $6 billion brought into the state of Maine for tourism like whale watching, more than fisheries and forestry combined.
Data is also critical for ecosystem based fisheries management. By understanding the entire system, we can improve management and improve gear technology.
Data is critical for fishing vessel safety. NOAA bouy data is critical for fishermen, relying on weather data for real time weather and wave information.
In 2015, the seafood industry supported over 1 million jobs, generating over $140 billion in sales across supply chain.
Port of Nome has seen a 257% increase in vessel traffic in recent years. Data is critical to ensure informed decisions can be made to prevent accidents and mitigate environmental incidents.
RADM Gallaudet says growth rate of maritime economy is 5.7%, double the amount of the rest of the economy. It's the role of NOAA must balance economic growth with sustainable management of our resources for future generations. #themoreyouNOAA

Answers: as unfortunate as deepwater horizon was, it has allowed us to do regional science. This disaster has given us the ability to do transformational research that could lend itself to other regions.
Another question: Since I dont live or work in the Gulf region, why should I care about gulf restoration and why should I want federal funds going to it? #Chow2018
At Hart Resesrch Institute, they have fellows that work on coastal and marine management issues. Start to build relationships with scientists in different countries of the Gulf so they can communicate together.
The Gulf Program has funded a series of policy follows in each Gulf state.
In Louisiana, they are developing curriculums for schools and working with universities.
How do we engage the next generation in restoration? #Chow2018
People in LA and Gulf Coast culture and economy is intricately tied to health of the coast. Some of the ways we are trying to address this in restoration is: work at the community level, work to incorporate preservation of spiritual or religious sites along the coast.
No! One of the imperatives is for us to enhance observational background in the Gulf. We are data poor within the Gulf. We need to up our game with a whole mix of technologies needed (floats, gliders, etc.)
Is our current observing network capable of tracking baselines? #Chow2018
Working with restoration dollars within RESTORE Act NRDA, etc. We should always be thinking that the restoration we do now should not be just repairing what happened with Deepwater, but how we enhance for the future.
Question: How do we use restoration dollars to ensure communities are more resilient?
Success is about a process. It's about adaptive management and including all biogeophysical sciences along with social behaviroal and economic sciences.
Also. What is our baseline starting point. What are our indicators. Measures of success are to what degree are they improving. And are there processes there for stakeholders to make decisions.
Answers include: there may never be an endpoint in terms of success from a physical standpoint. But robust decisionmaking processes to get us there are important.
.@hagfishfan asks: How should we measure success in Gulf restoration effort and how do we know when we get there?
After 2005, LA got its act together to plan for the future. Extreme weather events and BP disaster highlight the importance of healthy and robust gulf coast ecosystem. #Chow2018
The Louisiana coast of tomorrow will look drastically different than the coast of today. LA master plan is adaptation strategy for the future. #CHOW2018.
Ability to anticipate and predict how ocean is coupling with atmosphere is critical to understanding extreme weather events and communicating with stakeholders on the ground. #Chow2018
Environmental justice in restoration decison making is critical. Voices must be present in decision making process.
Panel says @GoMAlliance was critical to setting up framework for coordination of restoration post Deepwater Horizon.
After Deepwater Horizon, there were a lot of pots and buckets of money for restoration. Coordination of that money is critical.
