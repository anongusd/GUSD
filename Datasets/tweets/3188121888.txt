@jkarsh ‚Ä¶&amp; by huge margins. But RED states nonetheless.  &amp; the rest? Sanders has won also by reasonable margins in many cases. BLUE states.
@jkarsh Take the ‚Äúpaid for‚Äù delegates out of the equation and you‚Äôll see that HRC has effectively won the states we‚Äôll lose in the general.

@wwhitt21 I‚Äôm really bothered by elon and his followers because I respect his opinions and feel like he's smarter than this.
@wwhitt21 We‚Äôre going to get the president that they want for us though. So everything will be just fine...
See? Her handlers are on it! @wwhitt21 https://t.co/W8pVLeuSlm
@pammaysmcdonald Was planning on it.
@pammaysmcdonald Okay - the Civil Rights protesters have the market cornered on violent resistance. #uncle #thisiswhywecanthavenicethings
@pammaysmcdonald The FBI and CIA attend every protest. Anti-NATO, Occupy, Monsanto, they‚Äôre everywhere. Party was just an expression.
@pammaysmcdonald And in the end the class angle could help as well. Why fight a guy working for positive change?
@pammaysmcdonald So he chose to fight on in Vermont. And he‚Äôs working the class angle instead of racism. Doesn‚Äôt make him the enemy.
@pammaysmcdonald Then why question the motives of protesters? When I throw a party I don‚Äôt care why you‚Äôre there - just participate.
@wwhitt21 The litmus test on Civil Rights activism legitimacy is really a high bar these days.
@pammaysmcdonald might want to consider accepting allies wherever you can find them. But of course that‚Äôs just one opinion.
@pammaysmcdonald Seems pretty easy for you to generalize. I wouldn‚Äôt believe you cept Hendricks did headline march...
@wwhitt21 @elonjames I think Clinton is more likely to convey the right message. Just as soon as her handlers tell her what it is.
@wwhitt21 @elonjames Point taken. Twitter has changed. It‚Äôs become little more than tool for self promotion rather than forum for discussion
@wwhitt21 @elonjames You may find this unlikely, but I don‚Äôt care of Elon likes Bernie and I‚Äôm not trying to sway him. #justadiscussion
@pammaysmcdonald Would YOU compare King‚Äôs march on Washington to Woodstock? I wouldn‚Äôt.
@pammaysmcdonald Wasn‚Äôt Woodstock more for the entertainment value? Not sure seeing it as a Vietnam protest can fly.
@elonjames You‚Äôre right. He shoulda fixed that. But maybe he still will.
@jobelenus well yes, clearly. But still took guts for him to wear what with anti-red propaganda here in US.
@elonjames When you‚Äôre a relatively broke young person - attending a protest half way across the country should count for *something*, no?
@elonjames Just says ‚Äúhe was there‚Äù not that they were arm-in-arm. He‚Äôs one of only 2 current Senators who can make that claim.
Funny how ‚Äúclarifications‚Äù never get as much notice as the original slam. https://t.co/InJI6YYEcS

@Brinstar @abytw Criticism is often valid. I don‚Äôt agree with all of Sanders positions. But I do trust that his positions are his own.
@abytw @Brinstar I think we‚Äôre long overdue for female POTUS. Just wish we were discussing Elizabeth Warren because HRC is 2 corrupt.
@abytw @Brinstar I‚Äôm just bothered by lack of openness 2 engagement &amp; when people become instantly defensive any engagement seems aggressive
@chrislhayes Did Sanders promise to make prison population lowest in world? Or did he promise to make progress? Is progress impossible?
@elonjames Yeah - not doing any favors for the Bernie camp. Maybe a Clinton operative? #iHope
@griselbahena1 @elonjames @IamJadehawk ‚Ä¶so I guess I‚Äôm either lost, or you‚Äôre talking about something else now.
@jobelenus ‚Äúnot that Socialist‚Äù is likely still closer than any other national politician in the US today.
@Brinstar Hmmm. I‚Äôve never found the Kool-aide mascot to be frightening. I‚Äôll try to look deeper I guess.
@Brinstar Don‚Äôt believe your cartoon illustrates ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù now does it? It critiques normal engagement.
@Brinstar I‚Äôm not sure why a person making a case for their candidate should be a source of ridicule. Your cartoon makes fun of engagement.
@griselbahena1 @elonjames @IamJadehawk I just take issue with his definition. Racism is a way of acting and thinking about the world.
@griselbahena1 @elonjames @IamJadehawk So now that the ‚Äúlaws‚Äù have changed is racism gone? Of course not. Racism is attitudes too.
@politicalseason @elonjames @Maat_Justice I think that‚Äôs a very pragmatic way of looking at it.
@politicalseason @elonjames @Maat_Justice I‚Äôm not either - tho I‚Äôm willing to admit the shortcomings of this view.
@yungdrzizmor He may not be an actual red, but he sure as hell isn‚Äôt a typical center-right Democrat.
@yungdrzizmor explain?
@griselbahena1 @elonjames It would represent progress, but on a related, but ultimately separate matter.
@elonjames Perhaps just suffering from a limited vision. But I may be being generous.  :)
@elonjames Many remedies of the class problems will help with race problems - though clearly not the same thing.
@elonjames I think we need to understand that Sanders is coming at this from a Socialist perspective. To him, everything is ‚Äúclass‚Äù.

@circuitangel the money in politic issue must be addressed before ANY populist issues will be taken seriously by legislators.

@circuitangel @circuitangel anyone with $$$ can get good government. Do black folks have the $$$ to buy justice? No.
