Good to see a call for investment in infrastructure in tonight’s #SOTU. We must safeguard our #criticalinfrastructure from cyberattacks, develop nat'l standards to monitor vulnerabilities in CI, close the Cyber Exposure Gap and address fundamentals like basic cyber hygiene.

Congratulations to @joxman on being named CEO of @ITI_TechTweets! I look forward to working with you to advance bipartisan policies on cybersecurity that enable consumers, businesses, and government agencies to reduce cyber risk.

Tenable’s Director of Government Affairs, @JamiesonBrown was quoted in a piece by @CharlieReports on the government shutdown’s implications for the cyber ecosystem. “The momentum since the July 31 DHS cyber summit could be lost as the shutdown goes on.” https://t.co/5nwFDvrWjI
Thank you to all the federal workers and #cybersecurity professionals at @DHSgov, @CISAgov and throughout the federal gov’t who continue to protect our #criticalinfrastrucuture, networks and security through the government shutdown. Your essential work is greatly appreciated.
Maryland already has a flourishing #cybersecurity industry, and @GovLarryHogan's proposed Technology Infrastructure Fund will truly supercharge the state's #cyber and #tech industry. Read more from @MDDailyRecord (Paywalled). https://t.co/kdZwCzafc2
