Thank you to everyone across Montana who called in tonight to join our discussion! Let's do better for Montana! #MTpol #TTH
Montana has so much potential. There's no reason why we're 50th in the nation in wages for young people. #MTpol #TTH
We will prioritize roads, bridges, water, and sewer. #MTpol #TTH
You have my commitment, we will get infrastructure done in 2017. #MTpol #TTH
I will replace agency heads with people who have experience in the field of those they are trying to serve. #MTpol #TTH
The current administration in Helena has been in lockstep with Barack Obama. I will stand up for our 10 Amendment rights. #MTpol #TTH
When the legislature is not in session, I'll be traveling across the state as governor. Let's take state government on the road! #MTpol #TTH
We need to protect our farmers' property rights and push back against rules like Waters of the US. #MTpol #TTH
We should encourage legal immigration, but stop illegal immigration. #MTpol #TTH
If elected, I'm going to donate my salary to a scholarship fund for veterans and low-income Montanans. #MTpol #TTH
I feel a deep obligation to serve. That's why I'm running. #MTpol #TTH
Give us your ideas for cutting burdensome regulations at https://t.co/DxwN3M53Ze. #MTpol #TTH
It seems like there are two sets of rules, one for government insiders, one for everyone else. #MTpol #TTH
Milton Friedman said nothing is more permanent than a temporary government program. #MTpol #TTH
This current governor has increased state spending by 20% in his first term. And that's without infrastructure or tax relief. #MTpol #TTH
As Ronald Reagan said, the purpose of government is to serve the people, not the other way around. #MTpol #TTH
We need a culture of customer service in state government, not a culture of enforcement. #MTpol #TTH
I'm a business guy, not a career politician. I've started 5 businesses. #MTpol #TTH
When the governor had a large surplus, he refused to provide tax relief. Now we have plummeting revenues. #MTpol #TTH
Our 3rd #TTH poll finds that 51% of listeners tonight want new leadership specifically to push back against federal overreach. #MTpol
We have common cause with other states to push back against federal overreach. There is power in unity. #MTpol #TTH
Part of the solution is more local control so that more money gets to the classroom. #MTpol #TTH
We need strong public schools in Montana. #MTpol #TTH
I think the goal in education is to help every child reach their full potential. #MTpol #TTH
I support efforts, along with Congressman @RyanZinke, for more local say in the management of federal timber land. #MTpol #TTH
It's unfortunate that the governor needs an opponent to get him to do his job. #MTpol #TTH
The governor finally signed the Good Neighbor Authority after I pressured him for two months. #MTpol #TTH
This current administration has not used the tools available to help with the timber shortage. #MTpol #TTH
Because of the anti-business policies of this administration, revenues are falling off a cliff. #MTpol #TTH
The current governor just hasn't gotten the job done on infrastructure. He vetoed the bill in 2013 and failed to lead in 2015. #MTpol #TTH
I will stand up or our 2nd Amendment rights as governor. #MTpol #TTH
Our 2nd #TTH poll shows that 91% of listeners tonight are less likely to vote for the gov over his endorsement of Hillary Clinton. #MTpol
Oracle remains the largest commercial employer in Bozeman and it's still adding jobs. #MTpol #TTH
At Right Now Technologies we created more than 500 jobs in Montana at an average wage of more than $90,000 a year. #MTpol #TTH
We have good state workers. They're just not led well. #MTpol #TTH
Trapping is tool that we need. I oppose banning trapping on public lands. I will speak publicly on behalf of trappers. #MTpol #TTH
Our #TTH poll shows that 83 percent of listeners tonight oppose settling unvetted Syrian refugees in the state. #MTpol
We need a strong economy, so that we can build a tax base to begin lessening our dependence on the federal government. #MTpol #TTH
The general consensus is that the federal government is dictating too much to the states. #MTpol #TTH
We're going to give ag a seat at the table again in state government. #MTpol #TTH
I'm thrilled to be running with Phillips County Commissioner and rancher Lesley Robinson. #MTpol #TTH
We've got to make it easier for people to start and grow businesses in Montana. #MTpol #TTH
The first duty of the governor is to protect Montanans. #MTpol #TTH
I called for a full halt to Obama's Syrian refugee resettlement program from Day 1. #MTpol #TTH
Ultimately, what we need in our tribal communities and statewide is high wage jobs. #MTpol #TTH
We need to defend the Crow peoples' rights to develop their coal resources. #MTpol #TTH
We need an administration in Helena that will stand up for Montanans' rights against federal overreach. #MTpol #TTH
I believe that we can develop our natural resources AND protect the environment. #MTpol #TTH
We need to manage our forests. We'd have more wildlife, healthier forests, and more timber going to our mills. #MTpol #TTH
In FWP and many state agencies, we need new leadership. #MTpol #TTH
We're currently 49th in wages and dead last in income for our young people. #MTpol #TTH
As I travel the state, the biggest issue I hear about is jobs. #MTpol #TTH
We covered 44,000 miles over the last few months traveling the state. Coming to you tonight from the Bitterroot Valley. #MTpol #TTH

Thank you Montana for the great discussion tonight! #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
With Montana's work ethic, there is no reason why we're 49th in the country in wages. We need new leadership. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need to keep public lands in public hands. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
It's not so much a matter of doing a better job fighting fires as it is managing our forests. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Our land management policies are strangling our lumber mills. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I was pleased to receive the endorsement of the Montana Wood Products Association. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The 6 is lowering the income tax rate to 6%. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The 0 is 0 growth in state government after inflation and needed infrastructure. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The 4 is eliminating the Business Equipment Tax in 4 years. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We've laid out the 406 Tax Plan. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I am against a sales tax. We need to eliminate the Business Equipment Tax. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I will appoint agency heads who have walked in the shoes of those they are supposed to serve. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need new leadership in our state agencies. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall

The federal government's coal policies have been very harmful to the Crow Tribe. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I think we have a huge opportunity to do better for our reservation community. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall

We need to ensure that bison don't harm our agricultural producers. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need an admin that will stand with AG Tim Fox to push back against Washington DC. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall

We've found telecommuters in every community. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
One of the best economic opportunities for our rural communities is telecommuting. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I have called for a halt to Obama's Syrian refugee resettlement program. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I see this as another example of federal overreach. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I would encourage everyone to ask the governor what he thinks about the Obama bathroom mandate. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need to grow our economy and become less dependent on federal dollars. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I think we need to be real careful about taking additional federal subsidies. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The current gov has dropped the ball on infrastructure. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need to get the job done on infrastructure. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We've seen donations from all 56 counties. Thank you! #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need an admin in Helena that will stand up to federal overreach. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I'm a big proponent of our public schools. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall

I'd like to invite the gov down to Bozeman some time to do some fishing. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
If we don't have entrepreneurs, we won't have a private sector. You can't learn that in the classroom. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
My strategy is simple: We'll focus on the potential of Montana. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Montanans have a great work ethic. There is no reason for us to be 49th. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need a stronger economy 49th in the country in wages. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I think we ought to be pushing harder for good management of our forests. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I think American ingenuity can apply to cleanly burning coal. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I will defend our 2nd Amendment rights as governor. The current governor vetoed 3 gun rights bills last session. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I have been very clear. I will not take money from PAC's. The governor won't sign the pledge. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Not everyone needs a 4-year degree. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need stuff built. Welding, machining, plumbing, this is noble, good-paying work. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Enrollment in Compu Sci at MSU has gone up 54% since we launched Code Montana. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We don't have enough young people pursuing technical degrees in college. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall

As your governor, I pledge to make infrastructure funding a top priority next session. #MTpol #MTgov
The governor had 4 years to get this done. He failed. #MTpol #MTgov
One year ago Sunday he vetoed the plan he now claims will be his top priority. #MTpol #MTgov
Now, he proposes practically the same plan he vetoed one year ago. #MTpol #MTgov
He followed a "my way or no highway" approach in 2015. #MTpol #MTgov
He vetoed infrastructure in 2013. #MTpol #MTgov
We've had a gov who has failed to lead and take ownership of this challenge. #MTpol #MTgov
In 2014, Montana was given a C- on its infrastructure report card. #MTpol #MTgov
Roads, sewers, water systems. #mtpol #MTgov
We can point to infrastructure across the state that needs upgraded. #MTpol #MTgov
Because of the gov's failure to lead it's going up another 18% this year. #MTpol #MTgov
Did you know that, in Culbertson, the avg water bill is $1200 a year? #MTpol #MTgov
Unfortunately, we are reminded of our current gov's failure to fund infrastructure. #MTpol #MTgov

Any tax reduction would be broad and benefit all Montanans. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
Under this plan, filing taxes will be easier, state operating costs will go down. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
My opponent vetoed 3 tax reduction bills last year. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
Now is the time for real leadership. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
We can have tax relief and maintain enough surplus to keep our bond rating. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
6: Lower income tax rates. Max rate of 6%. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
No sales tax. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
0: No increase in state spending beyond inflation and needed infrastructure spending. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
4: Phase out the Business Equipment Tax over 4 years. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
We will lower tax rates and simplify the tax code. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
Jobs and opportunity are only created in the private sector. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
That's why I'm pleased to announce the 406 Tax Relief Plan. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
We know that lower taxes will leave more money in Montanans pockets. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
With falling commodities prices, there are storm clouds overhead. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief
Hiring less people, facing a lower bottom line, an unfortunate reality for many Montana businesses. #MTpol #MTgov #406TaxRelief

Thank you Montana for the great questions and discussion tonight!  #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I'd like to see very little growth in state government in 2017. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
"The purpose of government is to serve the people, not the other way around." -Ronald Reagan #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Water rights are basic property rights. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I don't use labels. We have too much fighting between parties and among parties. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
You have my commitment that I will always have an open-door policy. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
People who have worked with me know that I've always had an open door policy. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Helena needs to have a better understanding of what is going on across the state. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Last week we drove from Ekalaka to Eureka. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need a culture of customer service in state government, not enforcement. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We have good, dedicated employees in state government. They aren't led well. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We can change the way we do business in Montana and see more successes. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The current admin offers the status quo. We're 49th in wages. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownall
I am opposed to a sales tax. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We have to find a way to add more cylinders on the economic engine, so we stop exporting our kids. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I'm an electrical engineer by training. My wife is a mechanical engineer. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
There's power in unity. We ought to collaborate with other states to push back against federal overreach. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
As a state we need to stand up and push back against the EPA. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
This past year our current administration lost $1 billion off the balance sheet. No one was even reprimanded. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Go to https://t.co/TGXXbdQLZY to leave your specific regulation that you believe needs changed. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need more digital delivery of curriculum for rural communities. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Our obligation as a society is to help every child reach their full potential. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need more transparency and information about the job results of degree programs. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need carpenters, welders, and plumbers. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I think we're pushing too many young people into 4 year degree programs. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
If Colstrip shuts down, electric bills statewide increase by an average of 16%. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Regulations are making it more difficult to provide benefits to employees like healthcare. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
There are so many regulations that drive up costs for employers. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Montanans have an unmatched work ethic, incredible natural resources, we just need better leadership. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Our average wage was nearly $90K a year. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We started Right Now Technologies in our home with no outside capital. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I have a real concern about the cost of healthcare. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The business equipment tax is a wet blanket on business #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The current gov. vetoed tax reduction bills last session. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
My approach to tax policy is, to use a football analogy, 3-5 yard plays. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need to ways to help people get up on their feet. Trades education can do that. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need to train folks for high wage jobs in manufacturing and welding. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I'm a strong proponent of our 2 year ed programs. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I'm a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The state of Montana took $86 million from Arch Coal. Didn't get permit. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We've got to permits through the process faster than 11 years. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We're going to be in Libby on February 17th. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
This attack on coal, if it proceeds, places an undue burden on the Crow Tribe. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
What I'm proposing is that we find a balance. Right now we approach strangulation. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
There's no reason why we need such higher rates than our neighboring states. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Workman's comp is a topic that has come up over and over again. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
What I would do as governor is speed up the permitting process. Yes or no. Shouldn't take 11 years. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We need more high wage jobs, so we're not 49th in wages. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
What we found is that, when we combine good leadership with a Montana work ethic, anything is possible.
People told us that we couldn't start a global technology in Montana. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
Bad regulations are like "a thousand paper cuts." #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
The Regulation Roundup, we're doing 60 townhalls across Montana. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We're 49th in wages, and we're exporting too many of our kids. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
We've been incredibly blessed and we feel an obligation to serve. #MTpol #MTgov #Teletownhall
My wife and I raised our four kids in Bozeman, I fell in love with Montana 40 years ago. #MTpol #MTgov

Finally, I'll work to find ways to maintain quality healthcare in Montana. #MTpol #MTgov #Announcement

We need new leadership in Montana. #mtpol #mtgov #announcement
Unfortunately Bullock takes his cue from Washington. #MTpol #MTgov #Announcemen
You see, in Washington D.C., they think a prairie chicken is worth more than your job. #MTpol #MTgov #Announcement
Montana is facing some real challenges. #MTpol #MTgov
Unfortunately, Montana ranks 49th in wages. Too many of our kids are forced to leave. #MTpol #MTgov #Announcement
When you combine a Montana work ethic with good leadership, anything is possible. #MTpol #MTgov
I first fell in love with Montana when I hiked the backcountry 40 years ago. #MTgov #MTpol

Thank you Montana for a great discussion tonight! #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
I feel a strong obligation to serve this great state. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need to be less dependent on federal money in our state budget. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
It's time to eliminate the business equipment tax. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
The business equipment tax is a cold blanket on Montana's economy. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
New federal water rule (WOTUS) is a confiscation of property rights. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need to support Ag extension offices. #Mtpol #MTgov #Townhall
Any farmer is a business person. #MTpol #MTgov #Towwnhall
We need to engage business leaders with education. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need to prepare people with the skills to get jobs. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
I would have singed the constitutional carry bill. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need to have people in charge who have walked in the shoes of the people they are serving. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
How do we make it easier for entrepreneurs? We peel back regulations. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
My heart goes out to Syrian refugees, but we should not settle them in Montana right now. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We have this refugee issue in the first place because of a lack of leadership in DC. #MTpol #Mtgov #Townhall
Caller: "It's a somber mood in Colstrip." #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need to give water and sewer systems precedent over history museums. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
A core function of state government is to assist municipalities with basic infrastructure. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need new leadership to deal with the problems at Child Protective Services. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
I'm very concerned about the impact of free-roaming bison on our agriculture industry, our number 1 industry. #MTpol #Mtgov #Townhall
We have so much more potential and ability in Montana than we give ourselves credit for. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need more entrepreneurship in Montana to keep communities vibrant. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
Many rural communities want to know how to diversify. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need more economic cylinders, or many rural communities will get smaller and smaller. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
Montana is now #1 in the country for telecommuting. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
You can start a business here and you can prosper. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
I applaude @AGTimFox for standing against the Clean Power Plan. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
Obama is using his "pen and phone" to restrict guns. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We've got the tail wagging the dog here when it comes to federal bureaucrats. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We are going to "Round up" regulations and stop strangling our small businesses. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
Last year we had 125 accounting errors in state finances last year. A "billion dollar error." #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
Caller: "Unemployment in Lincoln County is way higher than the rest of the state. We need the Montanore mine." #MTpol #MTgove #Townhall
We need more price transparency in healthcare. "One size fits all does not work." #MTpol #MTgov #Transparency
We need to get permits approved a lot faster. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
I'm a lifetime member of the NRA. "Shall not be infringed" means what it says. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We need to work with experts to come up with "3-5 yard plays," rather than a hail mary." #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
The CPP threatens 7,000 jobs. 16% electricity price increases. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
We face challenges in our state. The Clean Power Plan is one of the major issues. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
I'm excited to share my announcement with the people of Montana tomorrow. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
The only thing more awesome than Montana is Montanans. The Montana work ethic is unmatched. #MTpol #MTgov #Townhall
