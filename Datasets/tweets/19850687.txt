@billcozzo @saletan Ya, I miss Obama. At least when he did things in the foreign policy arena, we knew he was selling out the United States. It was very comforting to know that whenever Obama made a deal, our enemies would be rewarded and America would get the short end of the stick. #TheGoodOleDays
@RandPaul Et tu? I see you're back to your Pro-Open Borders Koch Brothers Ways and trying to justify it with constitutional Illiterate claptrap. Your insulting dishonestly on this is a disgrace. Selling out for Koch cash while feigning like you're following the constitution.*You're a Fraud
@MrMattyChappy @Toddkron @my3monkees @JaniceKroesser @jguaido Great, you don't hate your country, you just support people who are hell bent on destroying it and transforming it into a Govt Centric statist utopia. What exactly do you like about this country? And how is that possible when you support Marxists like Bernie Sanders?
@DownTwist @calipette @my3monkees @StrangeFunnies Perhaps,it's beyond the understanding level of 10 year old: Yes Venezuela has huge Reserves- but it's heavy oil, which requires expertise and $ to process, in an industry that is extremely capital intensive. In 2003 Chavez fired over 19000 skilled people kicked out oil companies.
@DownTwist @calipette @my3monkees @StrangeFunnies Obviously,you're so arrogant in your ignorance and stupidity that any attempt to rationally discuss facts with you is a waste of time. You're an ideologue who has no idea what you're talking about. FYI: Grow up and educate yourself on the real world. Chavez Destroyed Oil Industry
@bighearted68 @michzoa He's one guy, yes I wish he vetoed the budget bills, buy it's tough when Democrats &amp;, Media are attacking him 24/7 and he still wants to get thing done; while his own Party is full of traitors-Democrats dressed up as Republicans. Each budget he's submitted had large spending cuts
@bighearted68 Please educate yourself-that's a complete scam created by Democrats as an issue to attack people who wanted to repeal destructive Obamacare (Which Today is responsible for 30 to 40% of everyone's healthcare costs) in 1996 HIPAA outlawed insurance denying pre-existing conditions
@DeimosMetus @my3monkees @Scottuechi9082 OMG! You're right! I don't know how I missed it. Human freedom i.e. Capitalism is the problem! Top Down, Iron-Fisted Government Socialism is the only system that leads to utopia! https://t.co/p44Y70qmHE
@MrMattyChappy @Toddkron @my3monkees @JaniceKroesser @jguaido Mathew. Why do you hate your country? What happened to you?
@MrMattyChappy @Toddkron @my3monkees @JaniceKroesser @jguaido Please stop parroting propaganda spewed by constitution illiterate leftists:Trump's absolutely abiding by the constitution,adhering to congressional statute H.R.3884-National Emergencies Act-which has been used 58 times. It's embarrassing. Educate yourself https://t.co/5Dm57utrcs
@bighearted68 Apparently you still don't get it. Do you read anything I write to you? It's not about Trump or any politician. It's about Liberty. The Problem is your ilk makes it about Trump, attacking him 24/7 because they have NOTHING To Offer but Failed Policies, Race-Hustling and hate.
@TrumpDay2 @BurcawJohn @my3monkees @Nchandra615 What's Amazing is how effectively you've been brainwashed - despite all facts, data and world history proving the exact opposite of what you seem to believe. https://t.co/p44Y70qmHE
@DownTwist @calipette @my3monkees @StrangeFunnies Ya that's it. Otherwise Marxism works wonderfully for all citizens. If Obama were still president (who didn't object to the Chavez/Maduro government jailing, beating and murdering political opponents) undoubtedly Venezuela's economy would be booming and no one would be starving
@calipette @my3monkees @StrangeFunnies Beatrice, please report to the nearest Bernie Sanders' platitudes and propaganda deprogramming station. The only socialist countries outside of South America are Cuba and North Korea.
@RistinRaccoon @my3monkees Ya, exactly! Freedom is highly overrated.We need fair multimillionaires like Bernie to run our economy, decide how much everyone gets paid and make decisions about what kind of healthcare my family gets. I agree the word socialism is the problem. Call it Marxism-we'll have utopia

@ilyseh @ulrika_da Says the vile leftist clown who has convinced herself that allowing born alive babies to die, because they happened to survive an abortion is no big deal. #NaziGermanyDemocrats #AsSickAsItGets

@SquidDespair @tfc92zx @DennisPrager Hilarious! The guy who acquires all his knowledge from CNN and MSNBC propaganda claims to be obsessed with facts and reality.
@ZoeZoeWarren @ogmateo @DavidAFrench Of course not. We need to empower a group of barbarians who not just support sucking the brains of babies in the birth canal to deliver them dead, but murdering babies that survive abortions, because we don't like how Trump speaks-despite his pro-constitution,pro-liberty policies
@PirateSpitter @LeeSouthwell96 @DavidAFrench Not the point. Hindsight is 20/20, perhaps we could/should have agreed with Patton and crushed him, but it wasn't in the cards. And never forget FDR who chose Truman as VP, was a Statist Progressive forefather of today's Americanism despising, constitution despising Democrats
@LeeSouthwell96 @PirateSpitter @DavidAFrench We're well past platitudes. The Marxist Despotism Democrats Seek to advance is no longer a theory. How many more human experiments must there be? How many more million must die before a sick ideology is discredited and evil is recognized?
@SquidDespair @tfc92zx @DennisPrager Worse than that: You’ve been so conned to detest Trump the man personally (based on 24/7 propaganda), that you to Demand for Government to seize your individual liberty and control every facet of your life. Worst of All -You’re too indoctrinated to know it!
@SquidDespair @tfc92zx @DennisPrager Again, I'm sorry you've been miseducated and have zero understanding of individual liberty, our founding and the constitution. The Fact Fascist propagandists get you so inflamed over Trump's personal characteristics-Which Have No Effect on your life-is indicative of brainwashing

Yet the American Hating Marxist Democrats Still Push it to twist low IQ voters
@SquidDespair @tfc92zx @DennisPrager No, but I do agree that you hate your country. What happened to you? Do you know exactly what it was that triggered your hatred for America and individual liberty?
@freedom_let True, some day in the future when Abortion is universally recognized as murder-the Democrats will demand that All Americans pay reparations to families of abortion victims -exactly like they demand we pay for their history of Slavery, Segregation, Jim Crow, Poll Taxes and the KKK

@CarrieIris @swin24 @mehdirhasan Yes I agree! Like multimillionaire Bernie, he was a great Communist. Just b/c he locked up and tortured anyone caught trying to escape his utopian paradise-didn't make him a bad guy, because he knew what was best for everyone. Bernie was right- America and Reagan were the problem
@John83712902 Read the post again Ms J, it wasn't about Kamala's dad :-)
@KamalaHarris @TrackStarGazing @MichelleObama Good News Kamala! It’s OK you got egg on your face from what you called a "Modern Day Lynching" of your close friend @JussieSmollett.  Just shake it off - Jussie's father is a white Russian Jew! Start blaming his Racist Lie filled Hoax on White Privilege, the Russians and Israel!
@Marley084 Is that what you learned in today's anti-critical thinking education system? You post me 13 times with Marxist propaganda, then when I respond with facts completely refuting the lies you've brainwashed to believe -you block me?
@swin24 @TiGGyZTweetZ Why are clueless leftists so arrogant in the ignorance and stupidity? How Many Americans go to Canada for healthcare? 0.  Yet, each year 1000's of Canadians come to America for healthcare. Why is that if Canada's is so much better?  https://t.co/0Xc9z3QZAa
@Marley084 Why are clueless leftists so arrogant in the ignorance and stupidity? How Many Americans go to Canada for healthcare? 0.  Yet, each year 1000's of Canadians come to America for healthcare. Why is that if Canada's is so much better?  https://t.co/0Xc9z3QZAa
@Marley084 @swin24 @TiGGyZTweetZ @jack Just so you know before I mute you: I posted you twice, challenging with facts specific points in the propaganda that you posted. Rather than defending the lies that you tweeted-You respond by posting me 9 times calling me names, a supporter of Nicaraguan death squads...#Crackpot
@Marley084 @swin24 @TiGGyZTweetZ Gee, that's persuasive. You win, I was wrong. Communist Cuba's healthcare system is far superior to the healthcare in the United States. I'm sure that once the word gets out, rich people and illegal aliens from around the world will start going to Cuba for all their medical needs
@dbmain @WeberStephane4 @IngrahamAngle @JobCreatorsUSA Note to Marxist Drone: when you have more than 300 followers and a fast feed with 1000's of notifications every few hours, there's a cut off where the system limits viewing past activity, 'Liking it' makes it accessible to see previous back &amp; forth posts from the trolls like you
@Marley084 @swin24 @TiGGyZTweetZ If you were honest and wanted to accurately compare Medical systems, rather than peddling BS propaganda for idiots you would compare real metrics Ex) Survival rates for various types of cancers https://t.co/fvCRrygjDk in: Stage 3, Stage 4,  Asthma , Diabetes, HIV, etc.
@Marley084 @swin24 @TiGGyZTweetZ Delusional Grant, that's the 3rd time in this feed that you praised Cuba's socialized medicine and touted infant mortality rates propaganda. 1st) US rates include Illegal aliens from all over the world 2) Communist Cuba provides figures with No outside verification.
@Holahappy1 @swin24 Yes it is. There's no way Lovable old Bernie would ever praise and idol worship genocidal communist dictators as these video clearly show him doing - it's obvious they are phony, Hoax Videos made by Trump and the Republicans to make him look bad. Well I don't buy it! #MCGA
@GmaG54499212 @swin24 @BeautyBind Yes they're almost identical. A super successful Billionaire international businessman with buildings around the globe, who has provided jobs for 10's of thousands of people vs. A life-long devout Communist who has never created a single job, or ever had a job outside of Govt
@Marley084 @swin24 @TiGGyZTweetZ Yes and after you're finished reading Grant's so-called history book, be sure to return it to the Havana Library, because as you know in Cuban people are provided with accurate history and current events. In fact, Raul Castro may soon even allow internet access in communist Cuba.
@NickBaumann @swin24 Yes it is. There's no way Lovable old Bernie would ever praise and idol worship genocidal communist dictators as these video clearly show him doing - it's obvious they are phony, Hoax Videos made by Trump and the Republicans to make him look bad. Well I don't buy it! #MCGA
@sarkthings @swin24 Yes, he was a genocidal dictator, who amassed a Billion Dollar personal fortune, imprisoned all political opposition and jailed entire families of anyone who was caught trying to escape his island paradise. But on the bright side, in his 49 year reign- Cuba had low obesity levels
@JohnBrosz @swin24 @DanRiffle Yes John I agree We Need Bernie 2020! It's time and long overdue! We Need a Multi-Millionaire who hates the rich as president! Join the #MCGA movement!  Only Bernie Can Make Communism Great Again!
@voxpopulx @swin24 @nycsouthpaw Yes he should have. It's criminal that he turned around Jimmy Carter's disastrous failures, had a booming economy that got more people off of welfare than all of his predecessors combined, raised the standard of living and defeated the Soviet Union to end the cold War. #Bastard!
@peteravanti @swin24 @WindyDane Yes! Peter do you know who else has free universal healthcare -with no fees, co-payments or monthly premiums just like Communist Paradise Cuba? - North Korea. #IndoctrinatedDrone
@fooblued @swin24 Yes, except for its political prisoners. I'm will you. Given it's such a utopia, I can't understand why so many people risk their lives trying to escape from it? I'm curious Foober, when's the last time you were there? Why haven't you moved to Cuba?

@Owencroberts17 @AOC Do even realize how stupid you sound? Do schools now teach courses in mathematical illiteracy? In fact, she the first person in world history to be publicly scolded over basic math and Free Market economics by a Communist mayor (de Blasio) and a sociopath Marxist Governor (Cuomo)

@PaulPeartSmith @jonathanmqzl Paul, you're getting played. It's obvious that you're unaware of the climate movement's origin. How it was driven by people who can care less about the climate. Do yourself a favor and research Europe's DeGrowth movement, 'Degrowthers'

@da_ray1 @JussieSmollett @BreitbartNews Of course family comes first, but focus:This lowlife belittled 65 million Americans as racist for exercising their right to vote,slandered a duly elected president as racist over an election,based on a sicko story he concocted and put into motion.He Deserves Disdain and Jail Time
@JamesTaylor891 @aminoff @jonathanmqzl No, not normal Muslims who respect individual liberty. I referring to practicing Islamo-Nazis: like members of HAMAS, Hezbollah, Muslim Brotherhood, etc., those who are driven to jam Sharia down the throats of infidels as well as Muslims they want to dominate or don't like. Why?
@JamesTaylor891 @aminoff @jonathanmqzl Yes; no more powerful than in the past. I'd argue less powerful given the rise of other pro-Israel groups. It's the Islamo-Nazi groups which have suddenly became powerful and with their newfound influence, they are lashing out at AIPAC because it's the largest Pro Israel group

@SquidDespair @aaroncmebyme Are you challenged? That was from the CDC. The issue was the best system for healthcare delivery for the individual free citizen. You touted socialized medicine in Europe. I disagree and believe under no circumstances is Top down Govt HC preferable. So I provided one example
@SquidDespair @aaroncmebyme Not everyone, but the vast majority of illegal aliens are not.This is fact. It's also a fact that the vast majority are illiterate in their own home country's language as well. I see it's hard for you focus. It's very sad, you're so insecure, you feel you must deflect every issue
@PaulPeartSmith @jonathanmqzl NONE, but early tonight I posted the latest comprehensive, highly detailed man made climate study from https://t.co/JZXtqOrPOA (based on models) which concludes we will destroy the earth by 2080...unless we all give a shit load more money to Al Gore and Govt to change the weather

@leftistbaboo @thehumangerm Note to Crackpot Bernie Supporter, who thinks communism works: Consensus applies to movie reviews, not science.

@SquidDespair You're correct. I believe that if all of us just give a little more of what we earn (let's say 50%) to government funded companies like Solyndra and people like Al Gore: we will change the weather, change the climate and save the planet from eminent destruction.#ClimateHoaxDrone

@thehumangerm So your argument is that some unnamed companies believed in man-made climate change 40 years ago when climate kooks were pushing global cooling and the coming Ice Age? It's obvious you have a problem with liberty and seek to be ruled by Govt, why don't you just move to Cuba?
@herhellfire @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN Note to Brainwashed Drone posting strangers: We normal, non-brainwashed people are who believe in science. Poorly educated, Indoctrinated,America-Hating Drones like you -reject science. Instead you believe in manmade computer models, eliminating liberty and killing newborn babies
@MichelleKHOU @WallisMarsh @PLOS Yes, and surely the current invasion of unvaccinated illegal alien has nothing to do with it.

@bielmike @djfetch @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN Very true, but let's not forget the standard fallback, when all else fails, or they simply can't think of anything to say ... then comes the race card "you're racist" or some variant like "you're wrong because of White Supremacy' #CrackpotLeftist #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder

@3rdViv No, what I said was for you -someone who supports a $72 Trillion Dollar New Green Deal and Commie Bernie's $42 Trillion Dollar Socialized Medicine for all plan to act like you're troubled that $5.7 Billion is a 'Waste of Money" is insulting. Just be honest -Admit you hate America
@lordlindquist @Chihuahuafatty @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN Science isn't a consensus. Science isn't 97%. Nor is it 99%, Science is or it isn’t. The answer to my question is 100% of people in the science community say water freezes at 32F/0C –because unlike Climate, it’s not a Hoax aimed to empower people to seize and redistribute wealth
@lordlindquist @Chihuahuafatty @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN No one disagrees with that. It does change. It's called the weather and the four seasons- None of which are Man-Made. Billy It's obvious why you refuse to answer my question because it exposes your BS for what it is, a Hoax.
@NatasiaYoung @PaulBois39 No one is arguing. You're a stranger who posted me. You don't have a clue what you are talking about. Did you even bother to look up EITC &amp; CTC?

@lordlindquist @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN Sorry Billy, you've been conned. There isn't a shred of evidence to support man-made climate change. I repeat, there is zero evidence that the activities of man have, or can change the climate. You're in Europe, where the hoax began. Research the Degrowth Movement, 'Degrowthers'
@nitagale @clayful2233 @RMConservative Other than America-Hating open-borders advocating leftists, who is manufacturing statistics?  I know that I'm not and the author D.H. gets his statistics from the source. Precisely which statistic do you feel is inaccurate?
@3rdViv @clayful2233 @RMConservative So, you believe that everyone on the planet has a right to live here and refer to strangers who disagree with you as 'ridiculous'. Seriously-there are numerous medications readily available that are covered by your healthcare plan. Please contact a mental health professional ASAP
@cuban_witch In that you seem normal, I'm curious, why you retweeted the crackpot leftist kid's response/pathetic defense of the Climate Hoax?
@lordlindquist @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN They happened to be grant funded because it serves them to find something that deems them worth of another grant. However it's a meaningless distinction, there's no evidence of manmade climate change anywhere-regardless of who funds the silly model. Falling for the Hoax is Dumb

@MonkeyShine70 @jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN Yes, in fact I posted an article a few weeks ago reporting on a conference they were having to discuss a new nomenclature for Climate Hoax, apparently Climate Change had run its course. I'm try and look for the article, so I can share it with you
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump That would be another ‘devoid of reality’ comment which confirms that you're delusional and not to be taken seriously.
@nitagale @clayful2233 @RMConservative Exactly what point are you attempting to make?
@jonathanmqzl @IlhanMN Owww that hurt. I'm sorry to hurt your feeling indoctrinated jonathan, but Global Cooling, I mean Global Warming, I mean manmade climate change is a HOAX. FYI-to this day other than grant funded computer models, there’s not a shred of evidence to support man made climate change
@clayful2233 @RMConservative Gee, that's persuasive. Thank you so much. I finally get it! We must have open borders because everyone on the planet has a right to be here and American citizens must be forced to pay for them. It all makes sense now.
@3rdViv @clayful2233 @RMConservative You're Wrong-Please Get New Sources. That said, I'm very impressed that a supporter of both the $72 Trillion dollar Green New Deal and Bernie Sanders' $42 Trillion Socialized Medicare for All plan is so concerned about 'wasting billions' to protect the lives of American citizens.
@RepMattGaetz @josoren06 Yes they despise ICE, however, this was driven by their #1 love - 'Power' - which their easiest constituency to manage imaginable - illegal aliens - provide to them in spades: illegal voting, future citizenship (voting) and getting counted in the census.

@NatasiaYoung @PaulBois39 Come on Natashia, you're deflecting. The fact you attack me for highlighting your propaganda is alarming. Facts: I simply pointed out (your words)"near 0"- costed Pennsylvania taxpayers $1.4 Billion. What about States where it’s not 0? How Much of My $ Belongs to Illegal Aliens?
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Endlessly babbling hyperbole and feel good platitudes,while never discussing specifics &amp; real world consequences of policy,is a common tactic of the leftist ideologue.The fact you've not once called out the unprecedented abhorrence of the now exposed attempted coup-speaks Volumes
@NatasiaYoung @PaulBois39 I also know that ancient Egypt, Greece and then Rome enslaved people of all races, but I don't single out individual Roman citizens and blame them for the societal evils of the time, in order to further the Progressive effort to discredit America's founding as evil and racist
@NatasiaYoung @PaulBois39 On top of that- Your claim that Washington has near 0 illegal aliens is an even more egregious. According to 'Liberal' Pew - Washington State has almost twice as many illegal alien residents as Pennsylvania! So please stop insulting my intelligence https://t.co/DqMmhwLoRh
@NatasiaYoung @PaulBois39 Furthermore,flat-out falsehoods to support your Anti-American citizen agenda is equally insulting.If Pennsylvania has near 0% illegal aliens as you claim,then why were PA taxpayers forced to pay $1.4 Billion for services render to them in 2010?- 9 yrs ago! https://t.co/IcARTqpLdv
@NatasiaYoung @PaulBois39 Posting me with insulting moral relevance stupidity to deflect from the issue, is analogous to saying:  'Yes, law defying illegal alien X,  who shouldn't even be here, robbed a bank, but it's not half as bad as citizen X who committed murder'

Right now we are spending more than 4.1 million dollars a day just to service the illegal aliens at the border. The estimated 5 year cost going forward adjusted for inflation, if we do nothing, but maintain the status quo is $156 billion - or we build a wall
Per @ICEgov : In 2017 we had 415,000 southern border appreciations. In 2018: 521,000 - a 106,000 increase or 26%. In the last 4 months- overall detentions total 242,000-which is 60% higher than 2018- If this isn't a National Emergency what is? *CA, CO, VA used to be Red States!

@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Normal People Recall Trump Immediately reversing weak Obama’s stupidity by sending defensive weapons to Ukraine,reinstating Poland and Czech Republic’s patriot missile defense systems, sending 3 forward brigades to the Baltics and expanding/strengthening NATO like No Prior POTUS
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Normal People Recall disgraceful Marxist Obama embarrassing America on the world stage in betraying our Allies Poland and the Czech Republic by reneging on our agreement to provide them a Patriot Missile Defense system – in order to coddle Murderous Dictator thug Putin
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Normal People Recall pathetic Obama drawing a Red Line in Syria &amp; Putin walking right over it. Putin invading and annexing Crimea; then invading East Ukraine while Obama golfed-Before He reneged on our agreement to provide Ukraine defensive weapons, sending them blankets instead
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump History Reality Lesson #2 For Brainwashed Drone: Trump has been and continues to be 25Xs Tougher than our four less Presidents combined. 100Xs tougher on Russia in 2 years than Obama was in eight years and 50 Xs tougher on Russia than Bush ever was. Facts Have No Feelings
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Seriously, anyone even resembling a non-drone would be embarrassed by your stupidity, the fact you willing spew such unequivocally bold face lies which are so easily exposed by 2 minutes of research: is worrisome and clearly indicative of a mental health disorder.
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump I’m curious Rod,are you as stupid &amp; poorly educated as you seem, or are you a paid activist? Today’s Lesson: Socialism is a Leftist ideology.

@GLR3TX @taxreformer Ha Ha   A statistic we’ll never know is how much would our lifespans be increased, if we never experienced the frustration and disappointment  incessantly forced upon us by the GOP
@GLR3TX @taxreformer One way to prove the point is 20/20 hindsight. I challenge you to find a single instance of Democrats, their supporters or the Democrat Fake News Media calling for, or even suggesting "bipartisanship" between 2008-2010. You're 100% correct- Everything they do is about control!

@GLR3TX @taxreformer Not understanding the enemy is why we lose (or just as common RINOS who lie-to- get-elected and actually agree with them). They Must Be Defeated/Crushed-Compromise must only a Last resort. I cringe when I hear suckers (ie McConnell) Begin policy discussions using 'bipartisan' BS
@GLR3TX @taxreformer No, I disagree.If you apply probabilities and think of it from their position-it's the smart the move 1) They seek to transform America, eviscerate the constitutional order 2) The only way things get changed back is a GOP majority-that isn't pathetic and actually makes the effort
@BeitlerRod @PibbleGal @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Says the America-Hating leftist who spent 8 years worshiping Obama- the most Marxist partisan POTUS in History - who got absolutely done through compromise and what he did get done, was through jamming things Down our throats via a party line vote,  which defied his promises down

@pmcall @KellyRek @IlhanMN @BreitbartNews Not sure exactly what you're referring to. Politics is what it is and what it's always been.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin The truth about who was on the right side of history and who was in the wrong lies in the voting records and those records lie in the National Archives and the Library of Congress. No amount of statue-toppling nor spin from the Leftist Tools like Boykin can ever erase it.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin It was Republican President Ronald Reagan who in 1984 signed into law the holiday now known as Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.		That's right,  Republicans were responsible for all advances in civil rights equality — not Democrats.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin It was Republican President Richard M. Nixon who introduced the "Philadelphia Plan" that serves as the blueprint for affirmative action today.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin It was also a Republican, Sen. Everett Dirksen from Illinois (the "Land of Lincoln"), who wrote numerous pieces of legislation including the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which banned discrimination in housing
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican, appointed Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren who penned the Brown v. Board of Education decision that ended school segregation forever.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin Even Democratic icons such as Kennedy voted against the 1957 Civil Rights Act while in the U.S. Senate. Sen. Al Gore, Sr., D-Tenn., also opposed it.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin The Democratic Party was not only responsible for passing Jim Crow laws, it also passed Black Civil Codes that forced Americans to utilize separate drinking fountains, swimming pools, and other facilities for the majority of the 20th century.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin PBS reported, "The Democratic Party identified itself as the 'white man's party' and demonized the Republican Party as being 'Negro dominated,' even though whites were in control."
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin But don't take my word for it.	Long after slavery was over, the Democrats continued down their path to deny African Americans their rights. Even Leftist Wikipedia refers to this as the era of "disenfranchisement" when "Democrats worked to exclude blacks" from civil liberties.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin In the 1960s, with the exception of Democrat LBJ, who was instrumental in the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the wake of the assassination of JFK the truth is that Democrats were the largest single blockade to civil rights.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin The Republican Party itself was founded as the "anti-slavery party" in 1854. The party subsequently gave us  Lincoln and ultimately, the Emancipation Proclamation which led to the liberation of slaves.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin Furthermore, Republicans passed all of the Civil Rights laws of the 1860s — including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the Reconstruction Act of 1867 following the Civil War.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin FACTS:	Republicans also passed the 14th Amendment which granted slaves U.S. citizenship; Democrats voted against it.	Republicans also passed the 15th Amendment which gave slaves the right to vote. Not a single one of the 56 Democrats in Congress voted for it.	Shame on them.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin Democrats voted against every piece of civil rights legislation in Congress from 1866 to 1966 – a whopping 100 years	Democrats voted to keep Africans Americans in slavery, opposing the 13th Amendment which officially freed the slaves. Only four Democrats voted for it.
@WisdomisNow @keithboykin Says the America-Hating, History rewriting Leftist Propagandist. Please save the leftist claptrap for indoctrinated drones. Just like every single politician in the 13 Confederate slave states was a Democrat - without exception; Democrats were 100% Responsible For Jim Crow laws

@GregshuntingCO @InboundZen @timruss2 @realDonaldTrump Says another desperate clown posting strangers who can't stand the fact that Trump is winning and America is booming - while the crackpot Democrats are advocating Communism, eliminating Cars, Planes and Cow Farts, as they champion their campaign to kill newborn babies
@NumbersMean @AdamOberhausen Not only is the average annual growth rate of just 1.48% during Obama's business cycle the weakest of any expansion since at least 1949, he has just become the only President to have not had even one year of 3% GDP growth. *A complete Failure to everyone but America's Enemies

@JMDrulez @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa I'm very concerned J. Science has made many advances in the area of mental health and there are numerous new medications and therapies now available. Please contact your nearest health professional. Such an inordinate obsession with 'race' is not normal and no way to live
@AdamOberhausen I really have no interest in debating someone who either hates his country,or is stupid enough to tout a deal that gave enemy Islamo-Nazi Iran, the world's #1 Funder of Terrorism, which chants "Death to America" at weekly national rallies -$152 Billion Dollars and a path to Nukes
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 Did you read Han's article I sent you, please do?
@JMDrulez @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa Please stop slobbering, If you have documented facts of Trump or another current Republican’s racism, let's have. Otherwise sit down and admit you worship the party of Slavery, Segregation, Jim Crow,  Blackface, and the Ku Klux Klan https://t.co/EEKxGdt2jr
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 We follow each other, I know you're not a leftist -Stop getting defensive. And No it is Not the Law of the Land. There is no exact on point case to this issue. It's only the Leftist's Law of the Land. In fact we have a better case than you think. https://t.co/HDa2euJA0T
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 And yes there will always be leftists out there who argue against my positions-but we must fight and I'm pointing out as many argument as I can- what we have Now is stolen sovereignty-American citizens are not getting proper representation b/c Reps are there Due to illegal aliens
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 Yes, because of our present post-constitution (in so many ways) predicament, there is no clear answer. As brilliant as the framers were they didn't include a paragraph saying-Oh if there comes a time when Govt screws over the citizenry and stops enforcing immigration laws.....

@vjose32 @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa You can post strangers with fact-free propaganda all you like-but to claim that EVERY organization says a wall is Not Necessary-depicts a level of stupidity not worthy of recognition-WHEN THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT MATTERS-Border Patrol-INCLUDING OBAMA'S CHIEF-say it's imperative
@vjose32 @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa Says the fact-free America hating leftist who's too stupid to assess the situation rationally, understand our stupid laws, appreciate that to circumvent enforcement, we're experiencing record numbers of non-Mexican groups turning themselves in as family units
@pvert1990 @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa A case that was thrown out is the best you got? So if I file charges against you, does it mean you're guilty of what I charge you with? I know it's tough for those w/a fascist mindset to understand, but in this country we still have laws, a constitution, presumption of innocence
@WheresMyArk_23 @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa That's but one of many reasons.
@AdamOberhausen Why would you humiliate yourself posting a stranger with a stupid chart that was drawn by a 12 year old? Great you loved ISIS's favorite president Obama, good for you. You're in good company: Iran, Communist China, North Korea, Russia and Cuba all share you sentiments.
@PfingstenRoy Now that's rich, coming from someone who supports a totalitarian Fascist Central Government, the elimination of our inalienable rights and the eviscerate our constitution
@WheresMyArk_23 @AshleyStorm13 @Joy_Villa Not so, applying analogical reasoning it’s on point. Setting aside the phony facts on which your argument is based: Your ridiculous argument against a physical border barrier is that most drugs come through ports of entry. Even if that's true, so what? It's irrelevant.
@BrahnsonV @bubbyskid @AuhsdBond Either you're a teenage kid or really too just stupid to engage. If you have evidence of these crimes, which Mueller and his $35 Million dollar investigation couldn't find, let's see it. Otherwise, please never post me again.
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 For example: The fact that the 14th Amend doesn't grant citizenship to Tourists - who are legally here, but owe allegiance to their home country. One would have to be insane to believe that the authors and ratifiers of the 14th Amend intended it to apply to those here unlawfully
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 Don't apply lawless birthright citizenship-a standard that has Zero legal backing (which no one even knows who in the bureaucracy 1st initiated ) to the 14th Amend. “subject to [American] jurisdiction” meant not owing allegiance to any other country.
@bigblueape @charliekirk11 Sit down, 14th Amend was passed for one specific reason. Just as no who passed would ever have dreamed it applied to Spacemen from other planets-NO ONE believed it'd apply to illegal aliens Because NONE of them even fathomed a time when we wouldn't enforce our Immigration laws!

@So_FancySag Art 1, all government funding originates in the house, the democrats are who refused to fund the Govt-the people elected the President; only 185k in SF elected Nancy.Furthermore, the fact you hate your own country and don't feel American citizens should be protected is not normal

@Ddking5556 Yes, right. Making up phony charges, placing spies in his orbit and spending millions to investigate him, looking for crimes without a shred of evidence in order to put him and members of his family in jail (like they do is Communist Police States) -is just disagreeing with him

@shopgirl479 @tfan_826 @MathesJohnathan @SteveScalise First of all you’re a lying leftist control freak posting strangers - definitely, 100% not a gun owner. So save your oblivious to human history, individual liberty despising, totalitarian Big-Government stupidity for fellow drones.
@Eddie_Rex1 @McCormickProf Wrong, they are synonymous. Both Murder Inc and the Democrats tout her legacy and former gives the latter awards in her name.
@BobCamp22938385 Bob, to be fair -she's an America-Hating, radical Marxist puke who publicly supports Illegal aliens voting in all US elections. She like all of today's Democrats, is an enemy to American citizens, the unborn and the just born.
@ProLifeDem @EMosburg Good for you. However, for clear thinking, you must stop parroting the Democrat's propaganda and language manipulation. Call it what it is: Infanticide, State Sanctioned Murder.
@sauloapadilla @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews @CBP @ICEgov @GOP @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats Good Grief! The America-Hating illegal alien is back spewing the same drivel he posted me with more than 3 months ago. It's embarrassing!Can't you at least try to get some new material? Next you'll post me: "If I like my plan and doctor, that I can keep them both,plus save $2500"
@tfan_826 @MathesJohnathan @SteveScalise Thanks. It's always good to enlighten people who've been blinded by the left's 24/7 propaganda, that they're getting played (i.e.) voting for people who are actually acting against their interests
@tfan_826 @MathesJohnathan @SteveScalise It’s nice to dream, unfortunately in the real world, those of us who revere our constitution and inalienable right to defend ourselves don’t support Democrats - all of whom belong to a Party driven by ideology and committed to eviscerating our 2nd Amendment #onstorm

@charley_ck14 @realDonaldTrump Yes, we prefer a president that didn't serve, who despises American, surrendered to our enemies, called ISIS a JV Team and paid taxpayer funded ransom to Islamo-Nazi Terrorists, as he actively eviscerated our military – Bring back Obama!
RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, “I believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.”…
@ConsoliFred @jbroskelley Typical bromide from fact and critical thinking-free, indoctrinated ideologues, who are incapable of defending their positions.
@jbroskelley @ConsoliFred Are you serious or a comedian? So Obama's one achievement is that he saved the environment? From Who? How So? What would have happened is he didn't do what you claim he did? Hilarious! Let me guess: One night, Obama descended from the clouds and ordered the weather to change?
@RachelCohen21 All Politicians are temporary-not your friends or members of your family. What matters is preserving and expanding individual liberty Via our constitution, which they all swore an oath to uphold- Period. This is the test that matters.
@RachelCohen21 Although I love him and thank God he’s fighting for us-much of the reason to defend him -rests in defending the Republic ie our system. This is why I so detest the 5th column NeverTrump RINOS, (backstabbers) who are worse than leftists. But as I say repeatedly:
@RachelCohen21 Trump is actually a fantastic example of ‘right reason’ –the fact he doesn’t view things through an Ideological/philosophy based prism, yet still has predominantly conservative beliefs and policies-confirms that conservatism is based on experience, justice and what works.
@RachelCohen21 Ok, agree to disagree. It seems to me that you're either poorly informed on his work (relying on 3rd person hearsay) and/or you have a less than comprehensive understanding of conservatism,our founding,our founding documents, natural law, etc.*I'd need Specific opinions on issues

@Teri_A_Adams Rather than parroting the drivel from the detestable quisling RINOS and America Hating leftists on your page. List exactly what Trump has done in violation of, or to defy our constitution. 2nd) List precisely which Trump Policies you oppose, and why? Let's hear it, make your case
@Teri_A_Adams Right about conservative, wrong about hijacking anything, I'm a constitutionalist first, and Republican because the only other choice is the Marxist Democrats. Make No Mistake-It's the RINO cabal of clowns you support who hijacked the GOP and it is they who are the reason we lose
@BillKristol @Teri_A_Adams What about the Liberation of we who have to vote for the GOP, from the likes of you Bill? How much humiliation do you plan to take?

@RachelCohen21 And Trump was a Democrat for most of his life, so what? Also, Levin is his own man, a conservative constitutionalist. He doesn't need or join cabals.Everything comes down to liberty. No matter how much he supports someone, he'll always oppose statism-regardless whose policy it is

@_Gabbers_ @RachelCohen21 @realDonaldTrump Well said Gabby. It's about digesting the information that was available then vs is now.

@ConsoliFred Good One Fred, but exactly what achievements of Obama's has Trump reversed? Achievements are good deeds, accomplishments, outcomes an effort was made to attain etc. Do you consider record low workplace participation an achievement? High unemployment? Destruction of Healthcare?
@RyanHillMI Good One Ryan. I'm curious what do you think were Obama's greatest Accomplishments? I realize the list is long, so please limit your response to his top 5. Thanks.
@tarrah_l Indeed! Please tell me Tarrah, what do you miss most, that you no longer have since Trump became president? Just the top 5 things, thanks. Do you miss: High Unemployment? Obamaphones? Cash-for-Clunkers? America's enemies humiliating us, then POTUS apologizing and paying them off?
@Cosmic_Surfer Wow, that's persuasive. Precisely what are claiming is racist and/or fascist? If you can't provide a single example, please be honest and tell me: Is there anything you personally disagree with, or just don’t like, that isn't racist and/or fascist?

@mellymauu @realDonaldTrump Yes Melly, this typo proves that the Climate Hoax isn't a hoax. Al Gore, now worth $200 Million from leading the charge and the goofball in the lab coat Nye were correct in 2006: that within the next 10 years, the world will reach a point of no return -oh wait, it's 2019?
@brittrobson @realDonaldTrump Stick to your day job Brit. Anyone clownish enough to claim that securing our border is equivalent to 'stoking fear' when a 1 million foreigners are crashing our border each year-and just the ones who've made it through are costing taxpayers $100's of Billions needs to be ignored
@retrocrush @realDonaldTrump Ya, like one written by Al Gore, or the goofball in the lab coat Bill Nye. Neither of them are scientists - but who cares? As long as you agree that government must grow and be empowered to control our lives, in order to protect us from the scary climate!

@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA Aside from the crime, over crowded public schools (less education for citizen children), 1000's of Hospital ER's closing around the country and Citizen murder victims, the pro-illegal alien open-borders policies you endorse have cost taxpayers $110-$200 Billion a year for decades
@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA ICYMI: Currently we’re $22Trillion in debt, adding close to a Trillion a year w/$250 Trillion in unfunded liabilities. And 100% due to immigration Solid Red States continue to turn Blue: CA, CO, VA. Once Texas Turns Blue it’s over –No GOP can win the White House.
@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA The real-world consequence of your venal, shortsighted position is a post-constitution, permanent statist progressive Democrat majority-effectively ending all the free-market liberty you claim to cherish. In the end, it’s why we lose and have screwed over future generations
@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA Although you and I agree on most issues, we disagree on principle. You’re not stupid, so the fact you willfully sign on to leftist lies, in order to destroy the character of someone you disagree with on a specific issue, is something I do not to do.

@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA The accusations are Race-Hustling BS. In accomplishing their goal of destroying King, once again the Stupidest Party on the planet GOP Leadership surrendered the narrative to the ‘Destroy-America as founded’ Democrat left accepting that phrase Western Civilization = Hate Speech
@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA King was trapped. He stupidly did an interview that’s purpose was to twist a statement to destroy him. His inarticulate words were portrayed as controversial to push a narrative. The phrase he meant was ‘Western Civilization’. He’s not a White Supremacist or a White Nationalist
@SemperLibertas @SteveKingIA Background: King is and has been a critic against Illegal Immigration. Amnesty-Pushing GOP Leadership &amp; Koch Bros have long despised him-unsuccessfully tried to replace him in primary with an Open-Borders RINO.

@KeiraJaneReed1 @CountryLivingG1 @YouTube The reason I asked you if you spoke Spanish was that I was going to send you a 1968-1970 Fidel Castro speech in which you will hear the identical message.

@KeiraJaneReed1 @CountryLivingG1 @YouTube Creating enemies to blame (in AOC’s case: rich people, billionaires), while ignoring the human condition, laws of economics and claiming they're doing it for 'the people' is what every Communist despot has done prior to taking over and decimating their economy.

@_classified_0 @Saints @NFL If they're limited to 2 challenges, what difference does it make what they use them on? If they waste their challenges on BS, it's their loss. Ergo, your argument that the game will go on forever, or things would be more uncertain doesn't hold water. Time for you to sit down
@_classified_0 @Saints @NFL You're sounding ridiculous. I agree and detest the ridiculous roughing calls and think it's hurt the game badly-Learn the Rules: Each coach is allowed only 2 opportunities per game to make a coach's challenge. A 3rd challenge if both of the original two challenges were successful
@rondallas3 @Saints @NFL My team lost, I had no skin in any of the games, but fair is fair. Not to take anything away from the stellar performance of the Rams' clutch Kicker - even Helen Keller could see that the Saints were robbed and should be in the Super Bowl https://t.co/MxFcfGsDr2
@_classified_0 @Saints @NFL Perhaps, but High Definition TV made it so they had no choice but to have them. Now that they do, and that teams lose a time out for unsuccessful challenges, it's simply ridiculous that challenges are limited. Helen Keller could see that they were robbed https://t.co/MxFcfGsDr2

@BuzzSawBuzalsky @TheRightMelissa Hello?Leo if I posted comments on Kinematics or Thermodynamics I'd be speaking about engineering(mechanical?)That said, when you post political opinions or comments on policy or the activities of politicians,by definition you’re advancing political theory-in your case an Ideology
@THuff7 @peteslew @Craftingqueen1 @kellimoors @RepJohnYarmuth Precisely what are you referring to? I believe in individual liberty and our constitution to secure it. You believe in a totalitarian Ideology based on abstractions. Ergo, I'm as moderate down the middle as possible, while you're a radical left-wing statist progressive. Problem?
@jayala_78 @MikesPencil @theintercept @ggreenwald Are you really a college student or an 11 year old on her Sister’s computer?
@BuzzSawBuzalsky @TheRightMelissa You need to stick to your day job because it's obvious you're indoctrinated and profoundly ignorant on political theory. You're brainwashed to accept a totalitarian ideology based on abstractions which requires you to reject incontestable truisms - the antithesis of rationality.

@TheJuanWilliams Juan, many of us remember (from years ago) your true feelings on immigration. I understand, and realize that for the millions you're paid each year, like you, most people would sell out their principles-to be portrayed as a leftist kook. Do you have any regrets?
@Truthseeker126 The first check that was held back for these Govt Workers on Paid Vacation Furlough was Friday-4 Business days ago. Anyone in this situation, who claims to now be in dire straits, is an irresponsible crackpot, unworthy of holding a government job. He or she should be fired.
@IngrahamAngle you really pulled your punches, not even mentioning how Thurgood Marshall disgracefully stayed on the court when he was in serious mental decline -having clerks write his opinions, watching soap operas. Cowering from the truth is a disservice to the uniformed.
@ItsAMeryLife @amconmag Next: I’m a constitutional conservative. For decades RINO Est Republicans have been the Primary problem on Immigration. Over a million illegal aliens flood our border each year, judicial tyranny is rampant, citizens are dying and you insult me citing an irrelevant 2006 report?
@ItsAMeryLife Now that it’s clear, you’re not a conservative, don’t waste my time parroting fact-free #NeverTrump hyperbole. Defend your positions and describe exact policies you disagree with –because they’re not conservative? Or for whatever reason.
@ItsAMeryLife HAHA you're conservative, always have been? Is that what fellow Democrats tell you? A cursory look at you page shows you retweeted Jennifer Rubin twice and CNN clown Raju and Obama Administration Marxist fake reporter Jim Sciutto. It’s ok, just be who you and save the BS.

@ColleenGaelic Why are you so hostile? Why are you attacking me for the beliefs you harbor? You voted for Hillary and Obama twice. You believe that Govt has the right to seize our money and the ability to institute policies that will change the Climate and give us the weather they deem is best.

@NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy French never mentioned or had a problem w/any of the 58 emergencies (under the 1976 Emerg. Act).But #59: that has cost US taxpayers $100’s of Billions a year for Decades, Overcrowded Schools/Hospitals,Closed ERs, Elevated crime, citizen murders,Turned Red States Blue=No Emergency
@NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy Trump has legitimate authority to secure the border-Yet Mr credibility French wants us to treat doing so as FDR’s E.O. 9066,or Obama’s DACA.This hostility to fighting anything, brought us to this point. Just like on Birthright Citizenship“Trump will lose in court, so don’t fight
@NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy Well done.Fortunately I needn't placate a co-worker: Obsessed Nevertrumper French's piece(s) are pathetic.

FYI: All health insurance plans today are bound my Obamacare's rules, regulations and anti-free market web of wealth redistribution. Like you, I've never been on an exchange, but we're both paying 4it
@Lauryn2000 @MarkSKrikorian Are you drinking?Govt's primary job is to protect the citizenry-PERIOD.Who they are is irrelevant.If they’re not here legally, they don’t belong here. It’s called the rule of law. And without the rule of law, you have anarchy. So save the America-hating claptrap for fellow drones
@Lauryn2000 @MarkSKrikorian To illustrate your ‘campaign rhetoric focus’ insanity  Has the Fact that you haven't saved $2500 a year in premiums and deductibles- that Obama AS PRESIDENT (not on campaign trail) promised 138 times that you would once Obamacare was passed, made you avoid seeking medical care?
@Lauryn2000 @MarkSKrikorian Sit down, so we should live in danger because a foreign country isn't paying for it? These same Democrats supported every single immigration policy Trump is now proposing a few years ago. THEY CAMPAIGNED ON IT! Your hatred of Trump has made you delusional. It's embarrassing
@luv2grndsns @gayletrotter @DonaldJTrumpJr @LindseyGrahamSC Ya, since most murders in America are committed by Americans, we should legalize all murders committed by foreign nationals, who have defied U.S. Immigration Law to be here. #CrackpotLeftistLogic #IncomprehensibleStupidity  #AmericaHatingDemocratDrone
@rdevansm @gayletrotter @DonaldJTrumpJr @LindseyGrahamSC Ya your right. Make sure you call your Senator and congressmen tomorrow morning to demand they fund border security! Enough is enough! Multi-Millionaire Pelosi returning from her Hawaii vacation, as she uses Govt workers and contractors as pawns is unacceptable!
@Lauryn2000 @MarkSKrikorian Anyone clownish enough to say that protecting our country, protecting our children, protecting our hospitals and protecting our families should be contingent on Mexico paying for it, needs to get her head examined
RT @MarkSKrikorian: The govt is shut down for one reason: because the Democrats will not fund border security.
@MarkSKrikorian Ya, too bad Republicans have never had a majority in the House. Surely if they ever control all 3 branches of government, with a president pleading for this law to be fixed, numerous bills would be put forth which include this needed fix.

Individual liberty inalienable rights, natural law are not fads, or something dreamed up by one of your cloistered professors in the faculty lounge. I know it's tough. What do you support?What your utopia?
@Tamara_juma Wow, that's persuasive. So because you don't approve of some people's lives, you believe they never had the right to be born. Have you always been a mastermind? Why won't you answer my question? Up to what age, should parents be allowed to terminate their children?
@pictureplane @Barnes_Law @willchamberlain Ya, you're not indoctrinated. Let's me guess, you believe there are more than 2 genders and that we can change the weather if we simply follow Al Gore and Bill Nye's instructions.
@Tamara_juma Adoption, look it up. There's a waiting list for newborns. I'm curious, do you believe that parents who change their mind, should be able to terminate the lives of their 1, 2 and/or 3 year old children? If not, why not?
@pictureplane @Barnes_Law @willchamberlain WOW, that's persuasive. Gee, to think I was speaking philosophy and treating you as an adult.

@pictureplane @Barnes_Law @willchamberlain If that's all you got, it's painfully obvious you've been brainwashed and lack an accurate perspective on the politics governing your life.1) Republican Party is not a conservative party. It has a minority of conservative members, but it's progressive vs today's Leftist Dem Party
@AlbertlMoleii @senatemajldr @GOP So, Obama lying 137 times on video claiming that if you like your plan and you like your doctor,you can keep them both and save $2500 dollars a yr in premiums/ deductibles was the GOP's fault?

@LoufromCT @toweroftruth @CZ4ever60 @joeinthejeep @Naninani51 @realDonaldTrump I agree on Jared &amp; Ivanka, it seems many forget they're lifelong registered Democrats-who couldn't vote for Trump in the NY GOP primary! Until this,POTUS had been great on campaign promises. Remember during the primary when he advocated the death penalty for drug dealer kingpins?
@LoufromCT @toweroftruth @CZ4ever60 @joeinthejeep @Naninani51 @realDonaldTrump Perhaps, however, he was fighting it for over 2 years and had he still been there adding DOJ law enforcement's weight behind @sentomcotton's common sense ‘based on irrefutable Sentencing Commission data’ Amendments (which were both Opposed by 100% of Democrats) would have passed
@LoufromCT @toweroftruth @CZ4ever60 @joeinthejeep @Naninani51 @realDonaldTrump Don't be ridiculous.

@ReplaceTheGOP Sorry Pal, you’re nothing of the sort. If you were you’d support the good and oppose the BAD -like:  Jailbreak prison reform , Family Leave BS, Funding Sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood, the socialist Farm Bill –without work requirement for food stamps etc.
@ReplaceTheGOP signed the Veterans Choice Act, cut taxes for all American -- All Conservative Things, You call him a traitor because you’re a real conservative? Are you a comedian? And you have the audacity to call me names?
@ReplaceTheGOP Got NATO countries to fork up $80 Million more for defense,confirmed more appellate court judges than any other new Administration in this period of time,Moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, created Space Force,6th Branch of our Military to deal with China and Russia
@ReplaceTheGOP But when Trump: Opened Anwar,Approved Keystone and Dakota Pipelines, eliminated 4,923 Obama edicts &amp; regulations, repealed Obamacare Mandate, nixed Paris Climate Hoax Accord, Shorten FDA drug approval times, Killed the Islamo-Nazi Iran deal ....

@ReplaceTheGOP Sit down, and save your fact free stupidity for drones. All politicians are temporary. What matters is protecting and expanding liberty. When I disagree with a policy I fight it. Unlike you, if it's a solid conservative policy/accomplishment I don't oppose it because Trump did it
@sauloapadilla @sue_meadows11 In that you're a race-obsessed, racist illegal alien who seeks to destroy America and turn it into a totalitarian leftist utopia like the country you fled; does it ever cross your mind that if you succeed -all of the current taxpayer funded welfare you receive will dry up?

@Crys0604 @andyburkholder @LindseyGrahamSC Apples and oranges. You really have no idea what you're talking about. Learn reality: the only Russian hacking was of crooked Hillary's illegal server. The only collusion was betw Hillary/DNC/Steele/Dossier/Russians/Obama telling Vlad I'll have more flexibility after the election
@CountryLivingG1 @1JohnEBravo Make No Mistake: Exactly Like Colorado, Like Arizona, and Like California - Virginia was a solid, dark Red State, turned Blue through legal and illegal immigration, against the will of its citizenry. There are only 2 possibilities: Stupid party GOP leadership is Venal or Suicidal
@JuneSaidF @Crys0604 @andyburkholder @LindseyGrahamSC Agree, the only server that was hacked was the one in crooked Hillary's barn -for which, right now, she should be wearing an orange jumpsuit for the rest of her miserable life.

@thebreezeffect @DailyCaller Have you considered moving to Cuba or North Korea?

@bjoycollins Comey has nothing to do with anything at issue. My comments are directed at your Statist Progressive belief system, which is in direct conflict with your alleged Christian belief system. In many ways, it's like a Klan member claiming to pre-pro interracial marriage
@bjoycollins @Comey Real Christians don't post strangers with nonsensical drivel to justify their support and allegiance to people who unequivocally seek to eviscerate their freedom to freely practice their faith
@bjoycollins @Comey Real Christians don't champion and support those who seek to eviscerate freedom of religion and replace it with the will of an all-powerful central government. Real Christians don't support politicians who force them to defy their beliefs(ie) Fund Abortion, redefine Marriage, etc
@Jmathews10 Yes, just like every mental midget stranger who posts me with fact free propaganda - which I take the time to refute. I've exposed you as a brainwashed drone, tool of the America-Hating Left. Rather than thanking me-Block me to confirm you're ashamed of your stupidity
@Jmathews10 Educate yourself on reality pal! From the 4 men in Boston framed under his watch, to the way he personally bungled the Anthrax case, to the traitorous way he oversaw crooked Hillary giving the Russians 20% of our nation’s uranium. Dirtbag Mueller is no shining knight
@Jmathews10 Save the group think ignorance for fellow drones. Until he's was tasked to get Trump-the Leftists you worship despised Mueller, whose checkered past includes a multitude of incompetent,disgraceful acts costing taxpayers $102 Million, then $5 Million in judgements
@Jmathews10 @thehill Reality is why fact-free indoctrinated drones like you, must be programed ‘to be driven by hate’. This allows facts and critical thinking to fall by the wayside.
@Jmathews10 @thehill Exactly What’s Trump Done to harm anyone or decrease liberty? NOTHING! In fact-he’s done just the opposite: Increased Liberty and improved people’s lives. While Everything Democrat Obama Did Deprived Liberty and Directly Harmed American Citizens. #RealityMatters
@Jmathews10 @thehill It’s analogous to the Democrat Party of Slavery, Segregation, Jim Crow and the KKK. The only Pro-Slavery Organization on Earth to survive into the 21st Century - Now claiming it stands for Blacks and Minorities- an epic scam!

@SonOfAlgos the fact that you're the 3rd leftist today: who posted me nonsense, got exposed, then blocked me - would be funny, if it weren't so sad and proof that our nation's educational system has been converted into a miseducation brainwashing service aimed to created drones
