@jbarro Might have been survivable if McG admin wasn't already under federal investigation (by Christie) before. He'd been caught on tape using a code word in shakedown scheme. Approval was plummeting, '05 primary challenge looming, then Cipel stuff hit and he found escape hatch.

@SpyTalker This poll is part of the official criteria for determining who does -- and doesn't -- get into the debates this year. I think it's worth a tweet.
In the 7 New Hampshire primaries (D + R) that have featured candidates from Massachusetts, the MA candidates have won five times and come in second twice. Warren is fourth in this poll, and Weld is third (although Kasich, in second place, isn't running right now).
Lots of talk about how Sanders running again complicates Warren's path, but this poll makes me think Kamala Harris is having a real impact on it too: https://t.co/jhhnqrUsLo

@nick_field90 I'd say it's plausible! I don't believe that any Dem would automatically have done as badly as Mondale, but am confident Reagan still would have won handily.

@redhotnerd I’ll go one more round. Clinton was accused of committing a felony to cover up a politically damaging affair. So is Trump. Clinton’s was perjury; Trump’s is campaign finance. I don’t see the bright moral or legal line that makes one obviously impeachable and the other frivolous.
@redhotnerd No, I'm pointing out that the same basic argument you are making now -- "It's not about sex, it's about a crime committed to cover it up!" -- was the exact case made against Clinton. Happy to engage, but we're going in circles here. Have a good one.
@BrandonDelvo Love hearing this -- thanks!
@redhotnerd If this is solid "because it's based on law," then so was the Clinton case. He was accused of committing perjury, which is a felony. Also, the Edwards case did *not* end in a conviction; he was acquitted on one count and the jury deadlocked on the others.
@redhotnerd So Democrats should do something "disingenuous" now because Republicans did it then? Or should they say they stood on principle then and will adhere to the same principle now -- and, as Swalwell says here, focus their attention elsewhere?
@redhotnerd "Sex is irrelevant, but deliberately committing a felony is a totally different animal" was the pro-impeachment argument in 1998.
This caught my ear too. It's basically consistent with the Dem line defending Clinton on perjury in '98, which would complicate any push to impeach Trump on the hush money/campaign finance issue now. https://t.co/Y6gJmDwc9n

@morningmika I’m going to get it down to a single dramatic syllable one of these nights...
@matthewjdowd @RichardLubin1 Yes, there’s a party split. This is not in dispute. There’s also surprise that there has been one to this degree given the story.
@matthewjdowd @RichardLubin1 My “mythic” point is that that can be both true *and* surprising at the same time.

@DukeStJournal Moyers is an interesting case because CBS designated him both a reporter and a commentator and insisted the opinions he expressed didn't reflect partisanship or ideology. Here's how Moyers answered a question about objectivity during a 1982 controversy: https://t.co/prOlQC9qkp

Sanders enters the Dem race running in second place in polls behind Biden, with support somewhere in the mid/high-teens. (RCP average has Biden at 27, Sanders 17, and Harris 11).

@ForecasterEnten Actually, I'd forgotten, the '68 GOP popular vote runner up was technically Nixon, since Reagan ran up the score with a favorite son CA slate. So what the heck...I vote for Nixon '72 as a runner-up who won the next time around!
@ForecasterEnten Right. I think the same question goes for '76 Dems: Mo Udall had more delegates than Brown, but Brown had the good fortune of winning CA. Actually...didn't Huckabee wind up with more delegates than Romney in '08?
@ForecasterEnten They get weird pre-'80 when there were fewer primaries and candidates skipped them, but is there a case for including Nelson Rockefeller '64/'68? Or I guess even Reagan '68/'76?

@JVLaB The reason for the nailbiter being directly related to the events of '06...
@Diaz_Topher @SeanTrende (And I as I hit send on that I realized the best place for him or anyone to make this kind of stand would of course be Utah)
@Diaz_Topher @SeanTrende Agree with that. I remember a similar dynamic in '00, with the indies all voting for McCain in the GOP primary and probably ruining Bradley's shot to knock off Gore. Still, of all the places for Weld to try to make a stand, NH seems...better than just about anywhere.
As @DKarol pointed out in the mentions here, Ford/Reagan isn't included. I probably should have; was looking at presidents who had been elected. Ford was at 60% with GOP voters when Reagan announced in 11/75.
@DKarol 60%
@SeanTrende Here's what I do wonder: Are there peculiarities in NH (old Yankee Republican legacy, MA folks who remember Weld, incredibly engaged indie electorate) that could in a way make it for Weld what WV was for Judd?
(Weld's announcement is not quite the same as these others; he said he's forming an exploratory committee as opposed to explicitly declaring that he's a candidate)
Gallup approval rating for presidents *within their own party* when primary challengers emerged:		Trump (Bill Weld, today): 89%	Bush 41 (Pat Buchanan, 12/91): 73%	Carter (Ted Kennedy, 11/79): 40%	Nixon (Pete McCloskey, 7/71): 82%	LBJ (Gene McCarthy, 11/67): 57%
@jasondhorowitz I had to look up “parlous”
Weld's electoral history:		1978 - lost race for MA AG	1990 - won race for MA Gov	1994 - won race for MA Gov	1996 - lost race for US Sen in MA	2006 - quit NY Gov race after losing GOP convention endorsement 	2016 - lost race for VP as Libertarian	2020 - seeking GOP WH nomination?

@Sharpe222 (And fwiw, my view on the coverage of '16 is that there were all sorts of powerful incentives, obvious and subtle, that too frequently kept these kinds of doubts from being expressed. That's one thing I didn't want repeated in '18 and don't want to see in '20 or ever again.)
@Sharpe222 Thanks. There's a danger to over-reacting to '16 that I try to be aware of, but also I think a possibility of under-reacting. '20 may be just as straightforward as you say, and I (think) I say that a lot. But I do have genuine doubts that I try to raise as questions/possibilities
@fratroberts37 @josephspira1 @vinsaff I'm very flattered - enjoy! (Also looks like a very scenic airport)
@Sharpe222 I also cautioned in '16 that he might win with numbers that have "virtually always" meant defeat. He won then, his party got clobbered in '18, and we'll see on '20. I'm not assuming he'll win, don't think he has "special powers," and I'm not "constantly" saying these things.
@Sharpe222 Why should they? Midterm results are significant and useful. They also have a not great track record of carrying over to the next presidential election.
Trump's average approval is up slightly post-shutdown and is now at 43.3% in RCP.  It's been between 37% and 46% his entire presidency.

One obvious difference is that Gore had run and lost in '00. Dems felt he was robbed, but also believed he'd run a bad campaign. Biden's implicit message to Dems, by contrast, would be: "Don't you wish I'd been the candidate last time?"
The situation with Biden now feels a bit to me like the one with Gore as he mulled 2004. Lots of similar doubts and "Don't do it" warnings from the Dem establishment even as polls showed him doing well with Dem voters. (Gore ultimately said no of course) https://t.co/gy8ADajr4I

From the time machine: Bill Weld, who has re-registered as a Republican and may oppose Trump in next year’s primaries, was nominated for ambassador to Mexico by Bill Clinton in 1997, only to be denied a confirmation hearing by Jesse Helms.

I started covering Cory Booker just after he lost the '02 Newark mayor's race to Sharpe James. This was from early '03, when Booker re-emerged and made his first moves for '06. The question then was whether he'd make inroads with Newark's black voters, who'd gone big for James: https://t.co/uoIWmBbhBw
@NiallStanage I know a few who had that reaction...
One of the (many) lines of attack Sharpe James used against Booker in 02 was that he was “a Republican masquerading as a Democrat”: https://t.co/RZt9TZGIYp
The George Will byline on this ‘02 column is notable too. Booker was once a favorite Dem of Republicans, breaking with teacher unions, cultivating close Wall Street ties, calling Obama’s private equity criticism in ‘12 “nauseating.” He’s shifted his emphasis a bit in recent years https://t.co/vURqngY7EO
@brian4NY I missed ‘99 but got there in ‘02. Think a lot about parallels between James and Trump
In the campaign that made him a rising star, Cory Booker challenged an older generation incumbent with rampant ethical baggage whose M.O. was to fan the cultural anxieties of his base and to make wildly over the top and fact-free assertions: https://t.co/zZNneOQjw9
So part of the assumption is Schultz would hurt Dems because Trump's base is "implacable." But his hardcore base isn't nearly the whole GOP. What about the reluctant Trump voters who didn't/don't like him? What if Schultz gives them a way to not vote for Trump *and* not vote Dem? https://t.co/vTiTxFF8NZ

@EBOlady Something that I think but that is also totally unprovable is that Clinton would not have been the nominee in '92 if Mario Cuomo had run. I;m not quite as confident of that one as I am of the Perot stuff, though.
@EBOlady No need to defer! It's a subjective discussion -- as I always say, no one can ever prove they're right. To me, though, the weight of all available information gives far more reason to think Bush was on his way to losing with or without Perot.
@EBOlady I mean, it was and it wasn't. Bush's approval had fallen 50 points and was still plummeting before Perot said a word. He was humiliated in the NH primary pre-Perot too. And Perot was out of the race from July to early October, but Clinton led handily in *every* poll taken then.
@EBOlady @GlennKesslerWP @rschles @NormOrnstein Right, but if the boom economy of the late '90s insulated him from character concerns, why doesn't it stand to reason that the brutal economy of '92 would have given him the benefit of the doubt as a challenger running against a poisonously unpopular incumbent?
@EBOlady @GlennKesslerWP @rschles @NormOrnstein Again, unprovable, but...I would argue that Clinton's enduring personal popularity throughout the scandals of his presidency suggests that the image repair he achieved after the '92 primaries would have taken place with or without Perot.
@greenfield64 An incumbent president seeking a 4th consecutive term for his party amid spiking unemployment, off the charts public pessimism about the economy, and an approval rating of 39% before Perot said one word...	It's unprovable, but it's hard to see Bush surviving with or without Perot
@GlennKesslerWP @rschles @NormOrnstein No one can ever prove or disprove the theory that Perot changed the dynamics in a way that cost Bush victory. But one of the many reasons I'm skeptical is that Clinton didn't "eke" out a win. His margin was six points. (And Bush's approval was already &lt;40% pre-Perot)
This makes me think of the transformation of the Democratic Party. It’s been happening for a while, but Trump’s presidency has dramatically accelerated it, and I wonder if it will eventually create a breaking point of its own for a certain type of voter:	https://t.co/jqk267wdJD
There had been a transformation taking place for a while within the Republican Party, but Trump’s rise has dramatized and accelerated it – and created a breaking point for a certain type of voter, which we saw in 2018...
In February 1992, President George H.W. Bush was caught off guard by a question about the cost of a loaf of bread. Versions of the question then became common on the campaign trail -- and when Bill Clinton was quizzed by a voter that October, he was ready: https://t.co/imFF0MNDz2
@ForecasterEnten David Remnick called Ross Perot the "first populist billionaire," and it's because he talked like this and it connected with everyday people: https://t.co/O7pv1ZxDQN
This could be a potent combination in a post-Trump environment: Respect from “mainstream” opinion leaders without the automatic alienating of the Trump base that would normally come with that
Watching Christie’s media tour, I’m noticing that in Trump-friendly venues - not surprisingly - he’s being well-received. But he’s also being treated warmly in places that would normally be far more hostile to pro-Trump guests. And he’s adept at winking at both audiences.

@henryolsenEPPC Congratulations - look forward to reading
@wildstein I still remember being surprised by his candor! Enjoyed crossing paths with him that day.
We don't see many parties win four straight WH elections, and that's what Bush was trying to pull off in '92. It's all unprovable, but I'm persuaded that a critical number of voters were ready to throw Bush out with or without Perot.
At that point, Bush had also already been embarrassed in NH by Pat Buchanan as well. The signs of unusually deep disaffection were already there, in other words, and In the coming months, unemployment would spike further and public views of the economy - and Bush - would worsen.
I look at it this way: Perot, pretty much out of nowhere, made himself available to run on Larry King Live on Feb. 20, 1992. Already at that point, polls showed voters were deeply pessimistic about the economy and that they blamed Bush, whose approval was already down to 39%: https://t.co/KLb3kLSyxz
I respect this view and can't disprove it. And it's very true that Perot nursed a sizable grudge against Bush; there's no doubt he delighted in causing him political headaches. But the sequence of events in '92 doesn't suggest to me that Bush was headed to reelection pre-Perot.
But the other claim about Perot is that his presence altered the nature of the campaign -- how the media covered it, how the candidates interacted, how the voters perceived all of it -- in ways that aren't quantifiable but that worked decidedly against Bush.
There are a few reasons. One is easy: The exit polls showed Perot voters were split evenly on their second choice between Bush and Clinton: https://t.co/PUCsFvHGv5
Every few years, I get an excuse to talk about Ross Perot and his effect on the ’92 race. I got to do it in my book, and thanks to Howard Schultz, I get to do it today. Basically, I don’t see a compelling reason to believe Perot measurably affected the Bush-Clinton outcome.
On the subject of Florida, Nader and 2000, this paper is very much worth reading. It does conclude that Nader's votes were decisive due to "highly idiosyncratic circumstances," but also shows how flawed assumptions about 3rd party voters' ideology can be: https://t.co/lbGkLOKbsM
I think this is a good point. Trump's margin was very narrow in '16 - 77,000 votes across three key states -- but Florida '00 was just on another level, a 537-vote margin for W with numerous factors - Nader, butterfly ballot, counted/uncounted chads - partisans could point to. https://t.co/dv6V94Ttb7
@ForecasterEnten Right, I think "Don't waste your vote" got through to more than just soft Dem voters
When he entered the race in the spring, Anderson was getting ~ 20% in national polls, but the attacks -- and Carter's refusal to appear on a debate stage with him -- did erode his support significantly. He finished with 6.6%, drawing only slightly more from Carter than Reagan . https://t.co/ymEjAKu43o
When John Anderson, a liberal Republican congressman, bolted the GOP to run as an independent in 1980, Jimmy Carter and Democrats were panicked that he'd pull voters from them and launched a concerted "Don't Waste Your Vote" campaign against him: https://t.co/K0r6N9TJHu
@arnonmishkin I really think the 10/28 debate explains what happened at the end of the ‘80 campaign better than anything. And in ‘92, it did tighten toward the end as I recall — and maybe would have a little more even without the Weinberger indictment?
@arnonmishkin Point taken. We just see it a little differently. I do think Clinton’s margin is similar with or without Perot.
@arnonmishkin I’m familiar with this argument and I respect it, but I also disagree with it. I believe Perot was a symptom of Bush’s weakness far more than a cause of it. Bush was already underwater before Perot ever emerged and never once led in the ten Perot-free weeks of the general.
@arnonmishkin Where did I say that? I’m citing the national exit poll.
The 1992 exit poll showed Ross Perot’s voters were evenly split between Bush and Clinton for their second choice. In 1980, John Anderson did draw more from Carter than Reagan, but not nearly to the degree predicted before the election: https://t.co/rz8JHytjtL
@nick_field90 Yeah he was at around 40%, with Lieberman — who publicly said he wouldn’t run if Gore did — usually second around 10%

South Bend’s population is about 100,000. The last mayor of a similarly sized city to run for president was Larry Agran of 110,000-resident (at the time) Irvine, CA in 1992. He was basically ignored though. Interesting to see what today’s media/online atmosphere enables. https://t.co/H3bouz7Zy6
I had a great conversation with @Polioptics, who dug up a whole bunch of vintage '90s clips for this podcast:  https://t.co/F53LbQkQ3j
One more: The Republican Wofford defeated in 1991 was Dick Thornburgh, a former PA Gov who stepped down as Bush 41's AG to run in the Senate race -- and who was then replaced as AG by...William Barr.
@LukeRussert @JamesCarville @PaulBegala Was getting there!
Running for a full term in 1994, Wofford was narrowly defeated by Rick Santorum, who benefited from a backlash against Bill Clinton, which was created in part by the Hillary Clinton-led push for universal healthcare in '93 and '94.
The Wofford upset also made stars of his campaign advisers -- James Carville and Paul Begala, who days after their PA win signed with the just-launched presidential campaign of Bill Clinton: https://t.co/UfbVDcLEaC
Wofford stressed universal healthcare in '91, with an that touched a populist nerve: ''If criminals have the right to a lawyer,'' he said. ''I think working Americans have the right to a doctor.'' 		Wofford's win helped make healthcare reform a top national issue for Dems in '92.
Former Sen. Harris Wofford (D-PA), who died at age 92 this week, played an unlikely but significant role in shaping the politics of the 1990s. 		Here’s NBC’s coverage the day after his upset ‘91 special election victory, which signaled George H.W. Bush’s vulnerability in 1992: https://t.co/tDvMNfNeN0
@CitizenDonna Let me be clear what I was saying: She like *any candidate* needs to prove viability in the early contests, or risk being written off. That's true for Kamala Harris, for Joe Biden, for Bernie Sanders, for Kirsten Gillibrand or for any of the other 6,734 Democrats who might run.
Seeing lots of responses arguing why this one is different and a longer-term political price will be paid. Very possible! I have no idea and won't pretend to know. I'm just offering a possible explanation for the posture Republicans are taking, and why it's so different from '13.
@CAAttorney1 But that would be the point, if they take this view (and I don't know if they do!): That there's always going to be some intervening event -- especially in the Trump era
One reason McConnell and most Senate R's don't seem to be panicking right now may be that they remember those dire '13 numbers and the fact they still gained 9 seats the next year -- in other words, there was zero indication that the '13 shutdown mattered for anything in '14.

Thought experiment: What are we saying today if Biden had run and Hillary had stayed out?
In fact, Hillary's post-'08 popularity burst is what gave rise to "Ready for Hillary" and the sense among Dem leaders that she was easily the most electable option for '16.
Also worth remembering that Hillary once enjoyed a similar phenomenon: Her popularity suddenly took off as soon as Obama beat her in '08 and the daily attacks and scrutiny stopped. https://t.co/Z2ye3B7yH9
He got none of the media scrutiny that comes with running, was spared being the constant focal point of attack from every voice on the right side of the spectrum, and as Hillary struggled in that role, his stature was enhanced. He became the "what might have been" guy.
Here’s his fav/unfav rating from Gallup over time. He starts to take off in '15 - outpouring of goodwill after family tragedy - but it's when he spends the '16 campaign on the sideline after agonizing over whether to run that he really rockets up: https://t.co/XU0ta0K8W7
I think my question about Biden is: To what degree is his supposed core political strength – the electability argument – mainly a product of *not* running in ’16?

Mainly what I remember from that fall is that this kind of talk came with some genuine uncertainty about how Americans might react if something like this actually happened, since it had been 112 years. Now it's happened twice in five elections.
@SaysSimonson 2000 I think was a little more stark because Bush had a pretty consistent polling lead even as the electoral map looked shakier. And since it hadn't happened in modern times, there was an open question of how the public would react.
@SaysSimonson Definitely lots of blue wall talk in 2012

@truthontrump1 Was not meant to be comprehensive. For example, Dole's "mean" disposition, lack of smile, and age (73) drove lots of the coverage of his campaign. Ironically, the comparative "likability" of his wife Elizabeth during her '96 GOP convention speech propelled her into the 2000 race.
@EsotericCD Thanks, Jeff!!
@Danny_Funaro We will see as more female candidates emerge going forward. There is a risk here of reading too much into the Hillary example because we haven't had any other female nominees. With time, we may see that Clinton shared public traits with Gore, Kerry etc that other women don't.
@MarisaKabas I don't know: Measuring Dem candidates against the ghost of past failures was a huge part of media coverage (and Dem politics in general) in the '80s and early '90s. Dukakis was "another Mondale," Clinton "the next Carter," R's called every Dem "another McGovern")... https://t.co/b34NlWHnGK
(And again, this is all about subjective perceptions and I'm not getting into whether it's right. But it's hard to look at television age politics and not see the degree to which "likability" has been a persistent theme in media coverage)
Anyway, to me “likability” is mainly a product of the rise of mass media, which put a new premium on public presentation and worked against candidates whose performances seemed lawyerly or overly intellectual – like Dukakis, Gore, John Kerry
It was a major theme in other campaigns too. The coverage of Michael Dukakis's lack of "likability" in 1988 even led an exasperated Russel Baker to write this column at the end of the campaign pleading for an "unlikable" president: https://t.co/bhR5snRmQe
There was polling that showed Bush significantly more “likable” than Gore, stories about how people would rather have a beer with Bush (anon-drinker, of course), and all sorts of efforts by the Gore campaign to combat the perception.
I am thinking in particular (but not exclusively) of the 2000 campaign, during which news coverage was frequently and heavily influenced by the supposed “likability” gap between Al Gore and George W. Bush. Here is a tiny taste that took me like 8 minutes to dig up: https://t.co/SSxOzcdZgX
I do think it’s worth remembering that perceptions of “likability,” as defined by the media/political world, have played a *major* role in the coverage of more than one modern presidential race, predating Hillary Clinton.
I’ve wanted to say something about the “likability” conversation I’ve been seeing on here and it comes from spending so much time the last few years reliving old presidential campaigns for research:
As Wallach notes, the Gingrich-led crusade over Wright's book deal is what's remembered, but Newt needed latitude from Rs to pursue it in the first place. No coincidence he made his move right after Wright held a key vote open in '87 and Bob Michel called him "autocratic."
This from @PhilipWallach is very strong on something I tried to get at in my book: That for all Newt Gingrich did by himself to remake the House on his way up the ladder, he needed the Democrats who ran the place to play to type -- and often they did https://t.co/TtqTPfR2PZ

@akbarb480 Yeah, fair, a little, although I guess what I'm saying is he was still getting significant -- if not decisive -- evangelical support early, and by the end (Indiana) he was beating Cruz with evangelicals and Kasich with moderates,
And if the idea is to be in position if Trump implodes and doesn’t run, then an aggressive posture toward Trump now will leave a huge chunk of the GOP looking for someone/anyone other than Mitt in ’20.
…and against the criticizer – Flake effect. Plus, Trump’s support even in the ’16 primaries was not factional – like, he scored with evangelicals and moderates. Harder to find a clear angle of attack.
If Romney is thinking '20, I could see him finding traction in a few places (NH even...) but also hitting a wall pretty fast. Trump's approval with R's demonstrates how criticism of him (and how that criticism is filtered through partisan media) ends up rallying R's behind him...
@nick_field90 Bob Packwood (!) flirted with it. William Armstrong got mentioned. Also there was lots of speculation after '82 that Reagan would decline to run.
Also there was much talk of a Reagan '84 primary challenge at the end of '82, as unemployment reached 10%, but his numbers rapidly improved with the economy and the talk was soon gone.
Two of these presidents received serious primary challenges. GHWB, whose approval with R's in late '90 was boosted by the run-up to the Gulf War, from Buchanan in '92; and Carter, who never really unified the Dem Party after '76, from Kennedy in '80,

For example, in a December '98 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 71% said they believed Clinton had committed perjury. And 63% said he had abused his power to “impair the administration of justice.” But 63% also said Congress should *not* impeach him for any of this.
20 years ago, Bill Clinton was accused of committing perjury, a felony, to cover-up a politically damaging affair. In DC, the dispute over whether this was impeachable largely broke along party lines, though polls consistently showed the broader public strongly believed it wasn’t

@ki676love @MAlvarezRivera @stephenfrank87 @kurtneeper The undercurrents of discontent that powered Perot in 92 were much broader than many remember. People tend to think Perot = Buchanan, but they forget about Jerry Brown and Paul Tsongas (who ran on the same issue as Perot, the debt, and got 4.5 million votes in the Dem primaries)
@bfs82466 @BobbyBigWheel I find the argument a tough sell because Bush was already under 40% approval before Perot even said anything. I think Perot was a symptom of Bush’s weakness much more than a cause of it.
@bfs82466 @BobbyBigWheel Perot was out of the race that summer. He dropped out during the Dem convention, was widely ridiculed for his bizarre claims, and stayed out for 10 weeks. During this time, Clinton still led every one-on-one poll vs. Bush, generally by margins well into double-digits.

@billpalatucci I just don't see how it's that automatic. Clinton turned around and won NJ by 18 in '96 and Gore by '16 in '00. With Bush's national approval under 40% in '92, seems plausible he'd lose NJ with or without Perot.
In '80, there was still 5 weeks between Iowa and NH, and in that time Reagan recovered his footing ("I paid for this microphone!") and won NH handily. Bush later scored wins in PA and MI - not enough to catch Reagan, but enough to make him more viable for the VP slot.

Simpson was floated as a Bush VP in 1988 but took himself out of the running on the eve of the New Orleans convention after anti-abortion forces, led by NH Sen. Gordon Humphrey, declared him unacceptable https://t.co/maP9YRABMg
One other thought on Bush and ‘92: It’s possible/likely the currents were just too much for him to overcome, but: To this day I wonder what Lee Atwater, had he lived, would have done to either attack Clinton in the general or (who knows) keep him from ever getting there.
The argument that Perot swung it to Clinton is not data-based and boils down to: He stoked and amplified an anti-Bush message that undercut the president. I get it, but I just don’t see evidence of it. Bush was already down to 39% before Perot even emerged.
About Perot: It is commonly said he was a spoiler in ‘92 and swung the election to Clinton. Bush himself — who had a history with Perot, to put it mildly — apparently believed this. But I really don’t think there’s a strong case to be made here. https://t.co/UqDL1RVkvX
@PaulWDrake @katherinemiller Clinton did not receive 37.6%. He won a plurality with 43%
And all of this was filtered through a media and popular culture that had come to be dominated by Boomers, that could recognize its own experiences in some of the Clinton controversies, and that tended to paint Bush as a fuddy-dud
Part of Bush’s fall in ‘92 had to do with a changing culture. He was the 7th straight WW2 generation president, but Clinton was the first Boomer nominee, and the campaign — Vietnam draft, “I didn’t inhale,” Hillary &amp; “two for the price of one” — touched many generational nerves..

With this toehold in House Dem leadership now -- and everyone above him much older -- I wonder if Jeffries loses any interest in a '21 NYC mayoral bid? cc: @Azi https://t.co/Ypd85ZGLCG
@shawdowlandjan It's primetime somewhere
(General election -- not the Cochran/McDaniel primary + runoff. I'm mostly being stupid here. It was an unexpectedly interesting start to the night, but then the laws of Mississippi political gravity basically asserted themselves.)
I vote for the half-hour or so when we had ~50% of the DeSoto vote in and not much else as the most suspenseful Election Night stretch for a Mississippi Senate race in a generation
NBC News projects that Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) wins the Mississippi Senate runoff over Mike Espy (D)
In the counties that have completely reported, Espy is running 2.4 points better than Obama did in the same counties in '12. That would extrapolate to about 46/46.5% of the statewide vote for him.
With almost all precincts in, Espy's share in DeSoto -- source of much chatter early in the night -- has edged down to 40.4%. Still very good for a Dem (Obama got 33%, Clinton got 31%) but a big difference from being in the mid-40s.
Not seeing much slippage for Hyde-Smith in more white rural areas that have come in so far. About even with Trump's '16 showing so far, better in some cases than Romney in '12. Moore had some slippage in Alabama.
Two more counties now 100% reported. Rural Tishomingo goes 84-16% Hyde-Smith. Obama in '12 got 21% there. And Amite goes 58-42% Hyde-Smith. Same as Obama-Romney in '12.
Lott's move to the Senate opened the #2 House GOP leadership slot, which then went to Dick Cheney, until three months later when John Tower's Pentagon nomination collapsed and a panicked Bush WH tapped Cheney. By two votes Cheney was then replaced as Minority Whip by....Newt. https://t.co/yfbi8eT5WU
@JMilesColeman guilty as charged - but i tried to temper it!
Almost nothing in in MS, but some precincts in DeSoto County did just report -- 51 to 49% for Hyde-Smith. Not sure where in county this is from, but these are the fast-growing, higher-income Memphis burbs -- where Espy needs to make serious inroads. Hillary got 31% here in '16.
@boymom_holly Ahk-tib'-eh-haw!
Polls close in 3 minutes. I should be on MSNBC with an update around 830... https://t.co/910DsoRmve
@wildstein Good one!
Also, Tulare County just added 46 more votes to its tally, bringing Cox's district-wide lead down from 438 to...436.
The NBC News Decision Desk just retracted its previous call of CA-21 for GOP Rep. David Valadao -- who has fallen behind Democratic challenger T.J. Cox by 438 votes in the latest tally.
@CarlPLeubsdorf Oh, not saying they were serious at all. Just curious who was even mentioned.
New votes tallied just now from Kern County have put Dem. TJ Cox ahead of Rep. David Valadao by 438 votes in CA-21. A win for Cox would give Dems a net gain of 40 seats in the House. https://t.co/8AQbDiC4Gg
@benrudin Yeah...I think I remember some very brief '08 chatter about him in '06
Trying to think of defeated midterm candidates in the modern era who've then had their names floated, even idly, as potential WH candidates. Cuomo was mentioned as a Clinton challenger in late '94, Feingold got mentioned in '10, Ollie North in '94, John Silber in '90, who else? https://t.co/kfvzIZNr6c
In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried 25 of the 26 counties in Mississippi with majority black populations, losing by 0.1% in the 26th. She won only two of MS's other 56 counties -- Marshall (which is 48% black) and Oktibbeha (37% black and home to Miss. State in Starkville).
@SenhorRaposa Well this is better than the thing from the newspaper I just found. Sorry I missed this earlier!
@ElectionMapsCo 65-35 stennis I think
Is this Moulton's Hail Mary pass -- somehow tempt Pelosi into reopening in her long-running war with Hoyer? There's a *lot* of history there (she tried to oust him as soon as Dems won the majority in '06) but caucus dynamics have changed with time and many alliances shifted. https://t.co/jgC5uofjmm
@BHIndepMO It's an incredible resource!
@MAlvarezRivera * extension of the VOTING Rights Act, that is
@MAlvarezRivera It had shifted, yes. During the '82 campaign, he voted for the extension of the Civil Rights Act -- and as you can see on the map, he ran well in majority black counties. Back in the Senate in '83, he also opposed the federal MLK holiday.
The last time an African-American was elected to the U.S. Senate from Mississippi was on February 3, 1874, when Blanche K. Bruce won 99 votes from the Reconstruction-era state legislature. Bruce held then held the seat from 1875 to 1881. https://t.co/mA7RmPfZjT
The last Democratic victory in a U.S. Senate election in Mississippi came on November 2, 1982, when 81-year-old incumbent John Stennis, who had vehemently opposed the civil rights movement, crushed GOP challenger Haley Barbour: https://t.co/2VNyYb2Bsf
@AlexParkerDC I think BC over ND in ‘93 is probably the greatest moment in modern MA college sports

A machine error was Nelson's only realistic chance to overtake Scott. It's also very possible a machine error still wouldn't have been enough or him. But as I wrote last week, this has got to feel like Butterfly Ballot Part II for a lot of Dems.   https://t.co/X2q1dmjPbX
The Nelson campaign has insisted these undervotes were somehow the product of a machine error, but the manual recount in Broward this morning took only two hours and reporters on the ground say it appears they really were just left blank:   https://t.co/o1y0U5hUb1
And, lo and behold, ~26,000 fewer votes were cast in Broward for the Senate race than for the more prominently displayed governor's race -- an undervote not seen in any of Florida's other 66 counties https://t.co/9eZm3ybirE
But these guidelines were not legally binding – states and counties could ignore them if they wanted to. And in 2018, Broward County in Florida did ignore them, placing the Senate race under a long column of instructions on its ballot:  https://t.co/iFqKFj0DEL
The EAC's studies then found was that contests placed on ballots under long columns of instruction were “often overlooked” by voters – causing them not to vote in that race. So the EAC urged states to *never* do this with their ballots: https://t.co/gpU10wqjP6
HAVA mandated the creation of the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which would conduct studies and advise states on what to do (and not to do) in administering elections. The idea was to come up with a standardized procedure for federal elections.
The Florida fiasco of 2000 led to a bipartisan push for election reform -- for another Florida to never happen again. This became the Help America Vote Act, which Congress passed overwhelmingly (357-48 in the House; 92-2 in the Senate) and George W. Bush signed in Oct. 2002: https://t.co/LJNoq7lNmX
@PrimeNewYork @mcimaps You can only assume that the undervote number would be in line with the 66 other counties in the state -- meaning at least another 20,000 votes cast. No, you can't assume Nelson wins with these, and I kind of doubt he does, but you sure as hell can argue it.
@mcimaps If you took, say, 20k of the undervote and gave 14k to Nelson and 6k to Scott, then Nelson would be 4k above Gillum in the county and Scott would be 4k behind DeSantis. There were disparities like this in other counties -- look at Orange...
@mcimaps Right, why would you expect a widely distributed batch of ballots in a county where Nelson is getting ~70% of the vote to break 50/50?
@harrisalexc Thank you! You have been a terrific resource on this!
@harrisalexc Do you know if they’ll announce a new/final tally for the Senate race today? Or wait until the ag race is done tomorrow?
The FL Senate recount has hinged on the 26,000 undervotes in Broward. Everything pointed to a ballot design issue, but Nelson’s lawyer claimed machine error. This was his only realistic chance of winning (and even then the numbers might not have worked). https://t.co/o1y0U5hUb1
This would be in line with the ballot design theory.... https://t.co/pgNvpg2vyC
@SopanDeb I find this plausible, except for the part where the board works...
After machine recount, giant gap - ~26k votes - between Gov and Senate race persists in Broward. It goes to a manual count now. If Nelson lawyers are right that this is a machine issue, they *might* make-up statewide deficit, but even that's a big if. But if it's ballot design... https://t.co/YlcYj4R396

@minnesotajo Yep. This is why I’ve said I *think* this is the issue - but I’m willing to be proven wrong, and the manual recount will answer it...
@theRealDonNorth There was an undervote in that race
@AlexCarlKeene @fguzmanon7 They weren't limited to one area, though. The undervote level across the county was significantly higher than what was seen statewide, and the concentration was higher still in the FL-24 sliver of Broward, where there was no House race...
@MagPieSC1972 It was, yes. See: https://t.co/9S5MUABUYl
@TaylorGravett Thanks! The left column on yours does stand out more to me due to the large Gov field taking up so much space and the shading in the boxes. But I am open to this *not* being a design issue. Manual recount will show -- and if so, the implications are potentially very big.
@jacksenspapa I've looked into that and written about it here -- yes, there were undervotes in the Broward House races too: https://t.co/9S5MUABUYl
@WPack911 Yes, there were undervotes for all of the House races in Broward too. The argument from those claiming machine error would be that the scanner missed that entire corner of the ballot on a small % of them -- and that the lack of a House race in FL-24 exacerbated the issue there.
@TaylorGravett Interesting. Any chance you have an image of the ballot?
Interesting to compare the Broward ballot to Miami-Dade's, where there's no undervote issue. Both did place contests under instructions, but with the Gov race taking up lots of space in the same column on Miami-Dade's, was it significantly more conspicuous? https://t.co/IOcmQ99Ifx

@andrewlong166 @jbarro Well, there's a separate issue with the House races mostly being noncompetitive -- like Hastings being on the ballot with only a write-in spot under his name. Not uncommon to see a drop-off in votes for a situation like that anywhere....
@jbarro Yep. There would have to have been some kind of reading/sensitivity issue in that corner of the ballot affecting about 3% of all ballots, with the lack of a House race in FL-24 exacerbating the machine failure there. If there's anything to this, manual recount will show it.
I'm focusing so much on the Broward issue because I think it's huge either way. If this is machine error, as the Nelson campaign argues, Dems are in line for a net windfall of ~10,000 votes. Potentially election-altering. If it's design, then they'll add nothing.
CD-20 = Alcee Hastings ran unopposed but was on the ballot because there was a certified write-in candidate.	CD-22 = Ted Deutch, with GOP foe	CD-23 = Debbie Wasserman Schultz, with GOP and IND foes	CD-24 = Frederica Wilson, unopposed with no certified write-in opponent.
Question has been asked if there was a similar undervote for House races in Broward - they were under the Senate race in the left column.		Answer is yes. Here are some precincts from the districts that make up Broward. Last one is FL-24, where there was no House race on ballot https://t.co/sFvZxQJpTr
@TheBobRyan @joshtpm I said I think it's likely the issue, but that I don't know -- and that a manual recount, which is now all but certain, will provide a conclusive answer. My reasons for why I *think* it's likely a design issue should be clear if you've read what I've written and posted here.
@joshtpm OK. For what it's worth, I think it's fair to discuss now, given what we already know about the ballot violating best practices and given that the answer to this question -- whether it was machine or design -- is the single biggest variable left in the vote-counting mix.
@cgw62 @joshtpm It's a critical issue and I think fair to discuss now. If it's a machine issue, Nelson will net upward of 10k new votes and maybe win. If it's ballot design, his path is basically blocked. And the Broward ballot design violates US Election Assistance Commission best practices...
@joshtpm I think I see your point, but is there a bigger issue here besides framing it as "slipping away" vs. "causing them to fall just short"?
@domaco01 You'd hear a lot less of me if you just hit the unfollow button!
Here are the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's guidelines urging election officials *never* to place races underneath vertical instruction columns. And per @NewsbySmiley, here's the Broward ballot, which did so anyway, and where there are now 25k+ undervotes. https://t.co/Tjqwn0tGq8
I don’t believe there would be one. In 2000, a suit was filed on behalf of voters in Palm Beach County who claimed they’d mistakenly voted for Pat Buchanan instead of Al Gore because of ballot design. It was quickly dismissed. https://t.co/YibZe5TTuR
Also, per the Sun-Sentinel, whatever the issue ends up being, in studies test voters “often overlooked races immediately beneath vertical instructions” — where Broward placed the Senate race. This violates best practices outlined by the US Election Assistance Commission: https://t.co/OyQeHq0xkA
If the Broward undervotes are *not* due to ballot design, this is probably what would have had to happen. Nelson’s lawyer is claiming it did; Broward’s SOE said it didn’t. A manual recount, now all but certain, will clarify things. https://t.co/LCHxcLKw2H

@timharrisesq @WShawnM @yorkiedad1984 @kellypai3 The bad faith here is really frustrating. I’ve tried to have a dialogue here and to answer your questions with the information I have. Your response is not to engage with that information but to attack me personally and to suggest devious motives. That’s enough. Blocked.
@timharrisesq @kellypai3 @yorkiedad1984 In Broward County, there are as of now 636,377 total votes cast in races for the House, 682,073 in the Senate race, 690,850 for agriculture commissioner, 695,987 for attorney general, and 707,021 in the governor's race.
@rudnicknoah Yeah true
@rudnicknoah Not on the list, but I think Lipinski
@timharrisesq @kellypai3 @yorkiedad1984 Florida state law mandates that an uncontested race with no registered write-in candidate *not* appear on the ballot at all
@timharrisesq @kellypai3 @yorkiedad1984 What are you talking about? There was *no* race listed under the Senate race where the undervotes were most pronounced.
@timharrisesq @kellypai3 @yorkiedad1984 There is an added issue with the House races in Broward: They are all safely Democratic seats and the races were lightly contested (or in the case of Wilson, not contested at all). It's typical to see more blanks in these types of races.
@xenocryptsite https://t.co/QAHkCFdyoy
@yorkiedad1984 @kellypai3 @timharrisesq There will be a manual recount no matter what I say and I'm as curious as anyone to see what happens with it. But the evidence that this is a design issue is compelling at this point.
@jimstinson Yes, people skip races. But the volume of undervotes in Broward is way, way, way out of whack with literally every other county in the state. And the concentration of undervotes is extra high in the one area of Broward (FL-24) where the Senate race was extra lonely on the ballot.
@timharrisesq @lizardsmouth22 @PollsterPatrick https://t.co/YBgkhDcHju
@lizardsmouth22 This is exactly what @PollsterPatrick found
I don't know for sure that ballot design led the the Senate race undervote in Broward, but I strongly suspect it did and this is not the first response like this I've gotten from a Broward voter https://t.co/Yz25JzeaI4
@SteveMBratman We’ll see, but as @PollsterPatrick showed, even where there *was* a representative race, the non-vote rate for the Senate race was *still* measurably higher than the statewide average
@mcimaps Yes it did — and I owe you a much bigger shoutout next time!
(Ironically, when Buchanan bolted the GOP to run as a Reform Party candidate -- against Donald Trump initially! -- the Bush campaign feared he would end up siphoning votes from them and helping Gore win the presidency.)
@jessesingal @T_Delphos I think it’s design. Senate race is buried under lengthy instructions with only the House race with it. And in the FL-24 portion of Broward, where the uncontested House race didn’t even appear on the ballot, the concentration of blank Senate ballots was particularly high
@jessesingal @T_Delphos https://t.co/2BhfpkaC4S
Even Buchanan said most of those votes were likely intended for Al Gore, who ended up losing Florida -- and the presidency -- by an official margin of 537 votes.
18 years ago, Pat Buchanan received 3,411 in heavily Democratic Palm Beach County - more than triple the number he got from any other Florida county - an anomaly related to the county's ballot design: https://t.co/hYvFNIEMcI
@ForecasterEnten That’s my sense of it too, basically, unless it somehow turns out there was more vote somewhere that is not currently accounted for by the Secretary of State.
@henryolsenEPPC Interesting. By comparison, in Miami-Dade, Nelson got around 6,000 more than Gillum.
...now that the margin is well under 0.25%, we are in manual recount territory -- so if there's anything to that claim of a machine error, it will be revealed.
And finally there's the question of the abnormally low number (by about 25,000) of votes cast in the Senate race in pro-Nelson Broward. I *think* they really were left blank and that it's a product of ballot design, but Nelson's lawyer has claimed a possible machine error...
Beyond all of this. there's the "It's Florida!" factor. Is it possible there are more uncounted votes somewhere that aren't yet reflected on the secretary of state's site? It doesn't seem to be the case, but who knows -- it's Florida!
And there will also be a small number of overseas/military ballots to come in as well from around the state, which should tilt Republican and offset some of the boost Democrats get from the provisionals.
Should also note that Dems have been pleading with voters who cast provisionals to follow up and make sure their ballots are accepted -- so maybe that number will end up higher than usual this time.
@harrisalexc reported earlier that there are less than 1,000 outstanding vote by mail ballots in Palm Beach. Beyond that, there are also provisional ballots from across the state. Note that in 2016 a *total* of 10,998 provisionals were accepted statewide: https://t.co/55Gk5j8Zer
The addition of these final Broward ballots brings Scott's statewide margin down to 15,093, or .18%. Per the secretary of state's website, there is now one county left with outstanding vote by mail ballots: Palm Beach, where Nelson leads 58-42% so far... https://t.co/MHWk5QZdnI
If you're interested in the suspenseful AZ Senate race -- and how could you not be?? -- here is a clever tool that shows you how many votes are outstanding and where they're from, and that lets you try out different scenarios for how they'll break. https://t.co/Y2UD4w1JV9
@AnnaNotaro22 The famous picture of the dimpled chad being examined through a magnifying glass was from Broward County: https://t.co/0vePiiuOA0
@ForecasterEnten Yep. Could be something else entirely too. It’s Florida...
This thread looks at the oddly low number of Senate votes in Broward County, FL. Bottom-line: I *think* it’s a ballot design issue, and if so - and if it’s not a machine issue as Nelson’s lawyer suggests - it will be much harder for Nelson to win. https://t.co/rzUV2AoTSa
@jpodhoretz @LPDonovan I’ve missed those too!
@jpodhoretz @LPDonovan I don’t think it does connect. The issue of the blank Senate ballots is separate, and I *think* explained by the design Broward chose.
@LPDonovan I think it’s unrelated. They reported some additional votes today.
@yeselson If there was the kind of machine error Nelson’s lawyer is suggesting, a manual recount should catch them. But from what I have learned, I believe ballot design is more likely to explain this and that they really were left blank.
@PollsterPatrick @DinoStraciatela Also a lot more going on in that left column to draw you there
I will update this with anything new I hear back on, but the design theory now seems plausible to me. 25,000 = 3.5% of all ballots cast in Broward. Given where it sat on the ballot, it's conceivable 3.5% of voters missed the Senate race, esp. w/ such a high concentration in FL-24
This from @PollsterPatrick bolsters the theory that ballot design accounts for the low number of Senate votes in Broward: The drop-off was evident in House districts throughout Broward and particularly pronounced in the FL-24 portion:  https://t.co/0T2XVtdNLY
Also, the statewide margin is now under the threshold that triggers a manual recount. So if that holds and there is one, then the kind of machine reading error that the Nelson campaign is suggesting would presumably be discovered as the ballots are examined.
Now go back to what @mcimaps  found - a high concentration of ballots without Senate votes in that FL-24 sliver of Broward. The ballot design theory is that there's a scattering of ballots like this in the other 95% of the county, plus this one small burst https://t.co/jPuEmqqRqX
To put some numbers on this: Broward County has a population of nearly 2 million. About 90,000 of them -- a little under 5% -- live in the FL-24 portion. Overall, there were at least 700,000 ballots cast in Broward, so probably around 30,000 of them are from the FL-24 portion.
So the ballot design theory for the drop-off in Broward would be that there were scattered blanks around the county with ~20,000 people not seeing it on their ballots, and a higher concentration in the FL-24 sliver, where w/out a House race the Senate race was less conspicuous.
There is also this: The official sample ballot on Broward County's site lists all of the House races that touch the county. It includes the Hastings race but *not* the Wilson one: https://t.co/vWu3uOhUTc
As noted by @oiler, Rep. Alcee Hastings, whose district is based in Broward, also had no opponent, but his race *was* on the ballot. However, a candidate *did* qualify to run write-in against him, and FL requires the ballot list the race in these cases:   https://t.co/76vluaRcfG https://t.co/AYMCyv4N0e
This suggests that ballots in the FL-24 section of Broward may have listed the Senate race *only* at the bottom of that left column, underneath those instructions, with no House race listed at all. Again, we have calls in to Broward and the relevant municipalities for more info.
Again, we are trying to track down a sample ballot from the FL-24 section or Broward, but per FL law an unopposed candidate is deemed to have votes for him/herself and doesn't appear on the ballot unless there is a write-in opponent: https://t.co/nagKnbU35h
We're trying to get a sample ballot from Broward for the FL-24 portion. Putting out a call here if anyone happens to have one to share. Question is whether the House race was listed at all, with Wilson unopposed, or if the Senate race was the only contest in that column.
Also, recall earlier in this thread @mcimaps's finding that the FL-24 portion of Broward had a particularly high concentration of ballots with no Senate votes recorded. In FL-24, Rep. Frederica Wilson ran unopposed -- that would have been the only other race in same ballot column
Nelson's campaign lawyer is suggesting a machine issue, but ballot design is another theory. Per @NewsbySmiley, here is the Broward ballot - note the Senate location in the lower left. Did voters who weren't searching for the Senate race miss it?   https://t.co/iFqKFj0DEL
From political cartographer @mcimaps, here is how much Broward stands out with the drop-off in Senate votes:   https://t.co/tl5XNAjkA3
@PollsterPatrick @TheAmishDude @NewsbySmiley Been wondering the same. @mcimaps found the most pronounced drop-off in the FL-24 portion of Broward -- where Frederica Wilson was running unopposed. That might have made that portion of the ballot less conspicuous to anyone not searching for it...
The drop-off in Broward isn't limited to one type of voting. There are significantly fewer votes in the Senate race than for Gov (and for Ag commissioner for that matter) whether the ballot was mailed in, cast in-person on election day, or cast early: https://t.co/bLPOdwpZp2
Nelson attorney @marceelias is suggesting there may be a machine error that prevented the Senate votes from being counted in parts of Broward: https://t.co/ZvfGScn039
. @mcimaps found the FL-24 portion of Broward had many ballots w/ no Senate vote. He suggests ballot design (Senate race in lower-left corner w/ unopposed House race) may play a role, but estimates a limited effect that wouldn't explain whole discrepancy:  https://t.co/UEojT6ZOf7
@MattGrossmann Yeah, but he also estimates it accounts for a difference of ~1,500 votes in the margin. That would only account for a fraction of this discrepancy.
And in just the last few minutes, the count has been updated, with more votes being counted from Broward. Statewide, Nelson now trails by 17,344 votes, or 0.22 %. But that Gov/Sen gap in Broward persists. It is now 25, 864.
There are several unresolved issues in Florida, where Bill Nelson currently trails by 21,888 votes (0.26%). One involves the large drop-off between total ballots cast in Broward County from the Gov to Senate race. It's out of whack with every other county in the state: https://t.co/RyeCEhZfa4

In '02, George W. Bush's GOP controlled the WH and House but had lost Senate control to Democrats a year earlier. In that midterm, Republicans gained seats.
This is the fourth midterm since the 1990s in which the White House party has gone into Election Day also controlling both chambers of Congress. Results:		1994: Dems lose House and Senate majorities	2006: GOP loses House and Senate majorities	2010: Dems lose House majority	2018:?
Tiny Cottle County, Texas has undergone one of the more dramatic modern political evolutions. Walter Mondale won it by 10 points in 1984 and in 1988 it went for Michael Dukakis 64-35%. It flipped with W in 2000, and by 2016 it was 83-15% Trump.
One thing I’m watching for in West Virginia tonight: Can Manchin match his old numbers in Coal Country counties that gave Trump 50+ point margins? https://t.co/QKMdzWTRds

Rural Smith County, Tenn. was still voting Dem in WH races through 2004, when it went for Kerry. In 1992, Bill Clinton (w/ Smith's own Al Gore on the ticket) carried it 72-21% and Gore himself won it by 34 in '00. But it flipped to the GOP in '08 and in '16 Trump won it 74-23%.
Same post Dick Cheney held from '87 to '89, when he became minority whip and was heir apparent to GOP Leader Bob Michel. But then Tower nomination collapsed and panicked Bush WH tapped Cheney for Defense Secy. Whip spot then won by 2 votes by...Newt. 5 years later, he's Speaker. https://t.co/Aunz0KHLUI
@gmasonFL Appreciate that - thanks!

A shift of only a few points across the board could be the difference between a razor-thin battle for House control and a sizable wave. From that standpoint, there's a lot for Dems to be optimistic about in the final individual race polls that are popping up now.
If Menendez were actually to win by 15, it would end up being the second most lopsided NJ Senate race in 34 years -- behind only Menendez's 19.5-point victory in 2012. https://t.co/qP051knGSw

I have no interest in this being any kind of a fight with Joel or Heidi Heitkamp or her campaign. I generally don't think candidates and their campaigns are under an obligation to publicly admit they're behind when polls suggest it &amp; there's no point in pressing them to do so.
1) ND is a lightly polled state.  We have 3 since mid-Sept.: Cramer +10, +12 &amp; +16. It may be closer. It may not be. I can only compare to other states, note Trump won ND by 36, and say Heitkamp clearly looks like the most endangered Dem.	2) I'm really not good at Trivial Pursuit https://t.co/XiKeJV9UXt
@EdAsante77 I think that's right. He requires a certain a level of tension to keep his base energized, but also needs reluctant R's to climb on board in the end -- and my guess is what they're seeing now is...not the kind of reassurance they want.
...it's worth contrasting the tone Trump seems to be closing ’18 on with how he played the home stretch in 2016 – when (by his standards!) he presented a markedly calmer, more disciplined and reassuring public posture than at any other point in the campaign, and was rewarded: https://t.co/erYajMH8up
The last week has been driven by Trump's response to the mail bombs and Pittsburgh, and now he's leaning into birthright citizenship. His Gallup approval has dropped 4 points and there are new discouraging polls for the GOP this AM. We'll see if this proves a bigger trend, but...
In Monmouth's "Democratic surge" model, Delgado leads 51-43%, and in the low turnout model, he's up 48-46%.		Trump's approval rating in the district is 46%.		https://t.co/RMonPL8Z5u

Yesterday, Trump hit his highest point in the RCP approval average since 3/12/17. It's big reason the GOP has been less pessimistic recently about November.

@BriCalHar @PoliticalStile @BobHugin @realDonaldTrump Sure, that’s what the polls show prevailing now and it’s obviously what Dems are banking on. Likely to happen too. But the level of antipathy they have for Menendez is not typical and I think it’s worth wondering how they’ll respond when they see his name on their ballot.
@chrislhayes I've been thinking about this too, but the other aspect of the comparison is that a national version of the VA '17 map would have Dem tidal waves in suburbs and a bunch of Dem pick-ups in districts that were carried by Clinton...but otherwise a map that looks a lot like '16.
@AlbaneseJoe The empirical evidence that voters are conflicted about Menendez? The fact that he's a two-term Dem senator in a blue state and has a 23% favorable rating.		The evidence this makes Dems uneasy? The fact that they dumped $3 million into NJ just last week https://t.co/7zY0pFrIqZ
Menendez has led every poll in NJ, but what makes Dems uneasy still is the thought of suburbanites flooding the polls on Election Day, checking off their local Dem House candidate's name, but hovering over the Senate race and deciding they just can't do it for Menendez after all

@DrJefferyHayden Why are you using October 2017? Most recent Gallup is last month - 26% ID as GOP, 27% as Dem. at same point in ‘14 it was 26% GOP and 30% Dem.
@VLVANCE Per Gallup, 26% now self-ID as R’s. At same point in ‘14 number was 26%.
Not quite the same measure, but % in NBC/WSJ poll saying they have great deal/quite a bit of interest in election:		Oct. 2002	Dems 52%	GOP 57%		Oct. 1998	Dems 52%	GOP 59%		(Recall that these are the two modern examples of the WH party *gaining* seats in a midterm)
@millejr4 There's data on party self-ID over time here https://t.co/hqmST9CvLo
("Very high" = those rating their interest level as a 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale)

In Oct. '06, a month before Dems won the House in a midterm wave, the NBC/WSJ poll found 69% of Dem voters had very high interest in the election, compared to 56% of R's. 		In the new NBC/WSJ poll, 72% of Dem voters have very high interest now, compared to 68% for R's.

Dems are still apprehensive about this race -- it's why they just poured $3 million in -- and in just about any other year, Menendez would likely be cooked. But the voters most at risk of abandoning him seem even more motivated to send an anti-Trump message.
Menendez, months after a hung jury in a federal corruption trial, has a personal favorable rating of just 28% but still leads solidly, bolstered by opposition to Trump from blue state NJ voters:		https://t.co/UbDorqzKn4

@robertdibernar3 I've been thinking about that comparison a lot. Bredesen probably a stronger candidate than Ford, but state even more polarized in GOP's favor now too
And now we have a Vanderbilt poll putting Bredesen up 1 in TN. So this month it's been	Blackburn+5 (Fox, 9/29-10/2)	Blackburn+8 (CBS/YouGov, 10/2-10/5)	Blackburn+3 (Reuters/UVA, 10/4-10/11)	Blackburn+14 (NYT/Siena, 10/8-10/11)	Bredesen+1 (Vandy, 10/8-10/13)https://t.co/3d5sd8qvaf

Congrats to @JMilesColeman and @DrewRusso781 who both got the answer.		Jerry Brown’s ‘92 vow to make Jackson his VP came amidst news that Bill Clinton had golfed at an all-white country club.

@MaggieAKoch @ElectLong I am watching it -- and the NYT is polling it now: https://t.co/TqYwwljexi
@DCclone Almost like that’s why I phrased it that way...
@Look4English I think it’s a pretty good description of a state where he lost by 55 points to Cruz (and also finished behind Kasich) and where he massively underperformed as the GOP nominee in November.
@NateSander1 The second one
(And on the flip side, the obvious potential missed opportunity for Dems is FL-27, which NYT/Siena is in the middle of polling right now...)
Politics is nationalized these days, but these are examples of district/candidate-specific factors creating potential surprises. And with Dems needing a net gain of 23, a couple surprises in their favor would go a long way.
3 new polls show Dems with unlikely pick-up opportunities:	*NY-27, a Trump+24 district where GOP Rep. Chris Collins is under indictment	*UT-4, the most Trump-wary red district in a Trump-wary red state	*WV-3, a Trump+50 district where the D nominee has strong local appeal
Almost everything in politics is a reaction to something else. The reaction to Trump is rapidly and dramatically transforming the Democratic Party. What will then be the reaction to that? https://t.co/HSJPTmq3pV
@decillis Wow - so great to see this. Thank you!!
Recall that Rs nominated Morrisey, who’s from the northern part of the state, over Evan Jenkins, who represented WV-3 in the House. This has become in a very short time a very GOP-friendly area, but it’s continued to back Manchin. With local ties, could Jenkins have fared better?
Also the new Monmouth WV-3 poll tells you about everything you need to know about the WV Senate race:		The district went for Trump 73-23% in ‘16, but Joe Manchin is leading GOP challenger Patrick Morrisey 56-36% in it.
New Monmouth WV-3 poll (likely voters)		Carol Miller (R) 48%	Richard Ojeda (D) 45%		***	District was Trump +50 (73-23%) in 2016 and current Trump approval is 63%. Last Monmouth poll here (June) had Ojeda up 6.
@cmolson63 Sorry, but I think NYT/Siena are doing excellent and innovative work. I’d encourage you to compare more closely what they are doing to what other major pollsters do; I think you’ll find they’re on very solid ground.
@michaelzelniker @MSNBC @11thHour They polled it in September and had the Dem up 1 then. Now they have the R up 15.

A big part of my book focuses on Newt and his role in nationalizing politics, but another hinge point is December 20, 1991, when Mario Cuomo chose not to run for president in 1992, clearing the way for Bill Clinton and 25+ years now of the Clintons hovering over American politics https://t.co/0Rrfcza9mM
@paolo_lim That's what I'm wondering
@paolo_lim The Dem candidate *was* narrowly ahead the last time they polled it. But they just polled it again and it's GOP +15 https://t.co/GOPH8b62UT
Maybe Kavanaugh would be the catalyst for this, or maybe it would be inevitable. But the new NYT/Siena polls in PA-1 (Dem now up 7 in Clinton/GOP district) and MN-8 (GOP now up 15 in Trump/Dem district) caught my attention in particular.
What I'm getting at here is the possibility of two things happening simultaneously -- suburban/Clinton '16 districts surging even more toward Dems even as GOP support shores up in less suburban/more Trump '16 districts Dems have been targeting. https://t.co/BTiZFtBxed

@NickRiccardi Right question of whether it trickles down to House races, especially with gop incumbents, in those states
Also remember the state legislative races in VA in ‘17 — overall big Dem gains but basically all in districts Clinton had carried. Nationally, there are now 25 GOP-held districts won by Clinton...
It’s interesting to hear Nate say this. My mind has kept going back to the ‘17 VA Gov race — map showed Dem tidal wave in DC burbs plus some extra strength in Northam’s backyard, but otherwise a repeat of ‘16. Will that have been a better ‘18 precursor than special elections? https://t.co/43ArkmJiob

We've generally taken the existence of a gender gap between the parties as a given since Reagan-Carter in 1980, but the numbers in the new CNN poll are off the charts. Trump's job approval with men is +8 and with women -31 -- a 39-point chasm. https://t.co/bZimou6Yi5

@SKORNACKI I'm told he came to the US through Ellis Island in 1904 from Lowicz, Poland, and married in CT in 1912 to a woman named Lottie Muraski. Not sure on brothers.
@SKORNACKI OK, after conferring with some family members who know this stuff much better than me, I think it might be more complicated: There is a *different* Walter apparently, who settled and worked in a factory in CT, that my dad's family is connected to.
@SKORNACKI I remember meeting him - real small world. I’m told my grabdfather’s father was Walter
If — like me — you took note of the NJ poll today showing Menendez up 2, you should also read and consider this from one of the top pollsters out there: https://t.co/8Bn2E5ZwIH
The two big differences are that Doug Forrester's unfavorable number was lower than Hugin's is now. And Trump is a *lot* less popular in NJ than W was at this point in '02, one year post-9/11.
The poll that spelled the end for Bob Torricelli came on 9/29/02 -- Rutgers/Star-Leder put him down 47-34% to Doug Forrester. Torch's fav/unfav was 24/43%.		In today's poll, Menendez's fav/unfav is 30/54%, but he leads Bob Hugin 45-43%.
It was this same week in 2002 that Dems gave up on scandal-plagued NJ Sen. Bob Torricelli, forced him out of the race and replaced him with Frank Lautenberg. But Torch's numbers had reached the critically bad level -- Menendez's aren't there in this: https://t.co/Prj07g3NEv
Notably, this poll has Menendez's fav/unfav at 30/54% and Hugin's at 34/21%. https://t.co/BclzDNNtpp
Then, in 1994 he briefly fell behind his GOP challenger, Mitt Romney, only to pull away and win comfortably even in the face of a strong national GOP tide. When the race was called, CNN’s Bruce Morton described Kennedy’s comeback in these...unusual terms: https://t.co/MRQqH0yp9j
All of this, plus his relentless caricaturing in pop culture (Mayor Quimby/Phil Hartman on SNL) threatened Kennedy's political standing in Massachusetts for the first time, leading him in late ’91 to make a speech admitting to “shortcomings” and "faults and frailties": https://t.co/uInbeBMHIi
Kennedy's political endurance after this (which of course itself came 20 years after Chappaquiddick) is part of my book. This story was followed in '91 with his involvement in the William Kennedy Smith rape case &amp; his role on the Judiciary Committee during the Anita Hill hearings https://t.co/WOSnU2iQGZ

@stevenpmillies @Morning_Joe The book, which I hope you'll read, makes a distinction between general political polarization and the more specific red/blue divide that took hold in the '90s. Also, there's a meaty section on the "culture war" speech.

I really want to get the word out about my book, and I’m told the internet likes cat pictures, so... https://t.co/9fg8wS7BY5
@EsotericCD Yeah not identical, and Specter’s embrace by the right proved temporary too as time passed and he went back to old habits. Just see in this moment a sudden burst of affection for Graham from previously hostile quarters that calls to mind ‘91 with Specter
(Yes, there was an Arlen Specter ‘96 campaign, although it came and went in 1995) https://t.co/9Jk07A2HlK
This is giving me flashbacks to the sudden conservative embrace of Arlen Specter when he was credited with saving the Thomas nomination in 91. Before, he’d been an apostate who’d voted against Bork; after, the praise helped inspire him to run for president (but he got nowhere) https://t.co/nx6srtAZNB
Here was his full comment: https://t.co/VKzlmkWGmx
Makes me think of Bill Clinton’s 98 grand jury testimony, when he launched into an aside about the Hill-Thomas hearings and said, “I believed that they both thought they were telling the truth.” https://t.co/SgfLSa2Gmr
“And surprisingly, I left the long day of testimony convinced that for all the years that have passed since the summer of 1982, the truth might actually be accessible.” https://t.co/I0hClv2ZtX
As a reference point, in ‘91, three days of testimony wrapped up at 2am on a Monday and the full Senate voted to confirm Thomas early evening on Tuesday. (They could move so fast in part because weeks earlier the committee had already voted on the nomination.)
@zschrieber Thank you!
(And the rest of you can order it here right now! https://t.co/yysTG15Em3
Thrilled that the very first signed copy of my book has made it to its recipient! https://t.co/GVcJ8jVTz8
Thomas was pushed by Arlen Specter on his decision not to watch Hill's testimony and this is how he explained it: https://t.co/YlPHMigq0Q
Kavanaugh says he didn't watch Ford's testimony but that he plans to. In '91, Thomas told the committee that he didn't watch Hill's testimony, which prompted frustration from even some of his defenders on the panel.
Well, here's the 5/24/90 box score for a Royals-Red Sox game at Fenway with Clemens pitching and George Brett in left field   https://t.co/lLamrGQZsi
@hughhewitt I like how you're spending your free moments!
@derekahunter I’m specifically referring to the explicitly partisan sections of his statement, not his declaration of innocence.
In '91, Thomas claimed a "high-tech lynching" and rallied support from black voters, which won over the crucial southern Dems who got him confirmed with 52 votes.		In the tribalized America of '18, Kavanaugh leaning on partisan language that may rally Rs &amp; their 51 Senate votes.
Question is if Collins/Murkowski/Flake are also seeing it like this... https://t.co/bXJQiZQfpA
Got a little taste there of what it would have looked like if Republicans had deputized Lindsey Graham to question Ford the way they deputized Arlen Specter to question Anita Hill in '91
@AlexParkerDC @NickRiccardi Listening to Graham now, it sounds like he wanted to be let loose...
@NickRiccardi @AlexParkerDC (Or, you know, Grassley actually giving it a thought and deciding this would work splendidly)
@NickRiccardi Yep.  Me and @AlexParkerDC have been trying to figure out if Dems strategically forced Grassley to break it up this way, or if this was just Grassley running a hearing like he always does and never giving it a thought.
It did seem she was caught off-guard at the beginning when Grassley interrupted and said she'd have to do it in 5-minute increments. Was this news to her? Did Grassley ask her ahead of time what her method is and what it would require format-wise? Was this planned out at all? https://t.co/UxADoTMhxh
In '05, Bush nominated Alito three days after Miers withdrew. In '87, Reagan nominated Ginsburg six days after Bork was defeated in the Senate, then nominated Kennedy four days after Ginsburg withdrew. But in none of those cases was the midterm clock ticking like it is now. https://t.co/F6OofVxQwx
This was the scene on October 11, 1991 when Clarence Thomas arrived at the Russell Senate Office Building to testify about Anita Hill’s charges: https://t.co/GrMwLbeHFb
The tone and scope of Mitchell's questioning is strikingly different than what was seen in '91, when the GOP's designated questioner -- Arlen Specter -- repeatedly framed Hill's testimony to the committee as being at odds with what she told the FBI and accused her of perjury: https://t.co/iePIb8UjQM
@AlexParkerDC Also a much smaller committee back then -- 13 vs. 21 today, in a time when there was more cross-party collegiality, conducive to Biden sitting down with Hatch and working something out.
@AlexParkerDC I'm wondering the same. I actually think the chair might have some discretion here -- starting to think he just didn't think this through and went with *his* normal procedure
@AlexParkerDC I didn’t see it, but pre-Hill Biden’s rep among Dems was that he’d handled Bork masterfully in 87
@AlexParkerDC *just didn’t occur to GRASSLEY
@AlexParkerDC Right, like you I’m assuming the Dems had no interest now in striking a deal like in 91, but also possible it just didn’t occur to them. I feel the criticism of Biden took hold after the fact in 91.
@AlexParkerDC Not sure but I’d guess there was mutual incentive: R’s saw Specter as ideal given prosecutorial background, D’s were happy to keep Ted Kennedy in the background (William Kennedy Smith trial had been months earlier)
@AlexParkerDC These were the ground rules for questioning Biden laid out when he opened the 91 hearing https://t.co/7dubU0HaKN

@EricColumbus @greenfield64 I think the “high-tech lynching” line was on the 11th, before Hill had been heard from
@greenfield64 The allegations. The more usual confirmation stuff had come two weeks earlier in his first round of hearings
@yashar @B_M_Finnigan It’s not just you- they’ve only given me one so far! And I gave it away
@B_M_Finnigan Enjoy!!
One thing that jumps out here is the sizable number with no opinion for most nominations — except Thomas, which of course featured the Hill/Thomas testimony that got wall to wall coverage. Still about 1/4 with no opinion on Kavanaugh, but more have an opinion on him than usual.
SCOTUS nominees (NBC/WSJ)		Kavanaugh (now) 34% favor/38% oppose	Gorsuch (2017) 32%/20%	Kagan (2010) 29%/23%	Sotomayor (2009) 44%/30%	Alito*(2005) 32%/20%	Miers (2005) 27%/21%	Roberts (2005) 38%/20%	Thomas (1991) 62%/28%		*poll from 11/05, confirmation in 1/06

The U.S. Senate even had to install a women's bathroom: https://t.co/1rmvuLM4kw
There actually *wasn't* a huge gender gap in the November election, but with so many women nominated, it still produced a big jump in the number of female office-holders: https://t.co/Y9eKRHJqTD
The big missed opportunity for females in the Year of the Woman was NY, where Bob Abrams squeaked past Geraldine Ferraro in the Sept. primary, but at a *huge* cost, w/ his attacks (and Liz Holtzman's) enraging Ferraro supporters. The fracture helped Al D'Amato edge out Abrams: https://t.co/krVYlPjxnq
When Patty Murray -- a state senator running as a "mom in tennis shoes" -- won the WA Dem primary in September, there were a record 11 female nominees for the Senate. (Murray was vying to succeed Dem Brock Adams, who was retiring after sexual misconduct allegations.) https://t.co/YCV6v283vv
IN CA, each Senate seat was up in '92, and in June Dems chose two women -- Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer -- to run for them. Each had leaned on the Hill/Thomas backlash. Exit polls showed that 2/3 of Dems who were against Thomas's confirmation went for Boxer in her race: https://t.co/cVgHWE4GQT
Then in April came PA, where GOP Sen. Arlen Specter, who had accused Hill of perjury, was up for reelection. In the Dem primary, Lynn Yeakel came from nowhere to win with an ad that showed Specter at the hearings and Yeakel asking: "Did this make you as mad as it made me?" https://t.co/QH4eoqUzUn
The first big shock was in March ’92 in Illinois, when Carol Moseley-Braun defeated two-term Sen. Alan Dixon – who had voted for the Thomas nomination – in the Democratic primary: https://t.co/yeTnj6rEvf
Here’s a quick trip down memory lane, back to the Year of the Woman – 1992, when female-driven activism unleashed by the 10/91 Thomas/Hill hearings triggered an explosion in women candidates, with the upheaval felt most acutely within the Democratic Party:

A day after Qpac puts Cruz up 9 in Texas, a Reuters/Ipsos/UVA Center for Politics poll has...O'Rourke leading 47-45%. Also:		AZ	Sinema (D) 47%	McSalley (R) 44%		FL	Scott (R) 46%	Nelson (D) 45%		CA	Feinstein (D) 44%	de Leon (D) 24%	Other 17%		NV	Heller (R) 46%	Rosen (D) 43%
Sorry, one more. Here's an interesting possibility:  Republicans could hang on to the 3 most pro-Clinton districts (FL-27, Curbelo in FL-26 and Valadao in CA-21) and still lose the House, easily.
Also reinforces the question of whether Dems will get the boost from Hispanic voters that they're hoping for...
This echoes the Monmouth poll from CA-39 yesterday - another Clinton/GOP district with an open seat race - where the R candidate is now ahead. Seems like a cautionary note that candidate quality and local dynamics can still loom large even w/ a strong national tide
FL-27 swung hard away from Trump in 2016, siding with Clinton 59-39% -- making it the most-pro-Clinton district currently represented by a Republican. With Ileana Ros-Lehtinen retiring, it was assumed to be gone for R's, but:  https://t.co/mFlo4NYTmQ

Yeakel ended up losing to Specter 49-47%, but her emergence was one of the signature moments of the "Year of the Woman" in 1992, which was fueled by a female-driven backlash to the Hill-Thomas hearings
“It was Specter’s interrogation of Anita Hill in the Clarence Thomas hearings that prompted Yeakel to run.”		April ‘92 NBC report on Lynn Yeakel, whose ad — “Did this make you as angry as it made me?” — vaulted her from nowhere to the Dem Senate nomination in PA https://t.co/7xULPjS2qN

@scothawkins Or perhaps you could keep reading the thread where I mentioned that *exact* thing
@irin I look at the '92 fallout as being a turning point w/in the Dem Party -- Moseley Braun knocking of pro-Thomas Dixon, Lynn Yeakel coming out of nowhere in PA etc, and general newfound energy to nominate female candidate. A (very mini-) version of '18 that was big in the moment.
...Collins and Murkowski are balancing some different incentives, and if they end up bolting, it also creates space for Dems to do the same
The broad coalition for Thomas in '91 was critical to his ability to win confirmation, swaying wavering senators, especially Democrats from the South. The polarization with Kavanaugh has been helping him somewhat (strong R support putting pressure on red state Dems), but...
Contrast that to today, when Kavanaugh's nomination -- even before the new developments -- has been much more polarizing. CNN/SSRS a few days ago had him at 37% favor/40% oppose. https://t.co/jSnIDFmXnR
From the same poll -- opinion on Clarence Thomas nomination *after* Hill hearings:		Men:	Confirm 54%	Reject 25%		Women:	Confirm 48%	Reject 25%		White:	Confirm 50%	Reject 26%		African American:	Confirm 61%	Reject 16%
Tens of millions watched the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991, but they didn't shift public opinion significantly:		Before	Confirm 54%	Reject 19%	No opinion 27%		After 	Confirm 51%	Reject 25%	Not sure 24%		(LA Times poll; 10/14/91)
Clarence Thomas confirmation timeline: https://t.co/PHH6rNH0ap
“Over the years, I’ve been a fairly good vote-counter. And I couldn’t put together 50 votes at six o’clock.”  — Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole on 10/8/91 relenting and accepting a delay and the reopening of the Clarence Thomas hearings after Anita Hill goes public https://t.co/PfsP5I0ft7
@CharlesPPierce I would guess that would come up in any Biden ‘20 campaign!
This may be the most forgotten aspect of the Thomas nomination politically: He still had *majority* support even after the hearings with Hill. R’s rallied around him, he had a plurality of independents, and Dems were split with many black voters supporting him.
The swing senators now, of course, are Collins and Murkowski, whose defections could give red State Dems cover to vote No and sink the nomination
Politically, what saved Clarence Thomas after the Anita Hill allegation was that the swing senators — white southern Dems — were persuaded by polls showing strong support for Thomas with black voters. He was confirmed 52-48. https://t.co/QUDYBLIn9F

Kathy Hochul is trailing by ~5,000 votes in the LG primary, but only 10% of her Erie County/Buffalo base is in. She's currently getting 81% there.
With 80% of the NYC vote in, I have Cuomo leading 66.2-33.8% citywide. In '14, he beat Teachout in NYC 68-29%.
About 40% of the vote in in Monroe County (Rochester) and Cuomo is getting 59% -- exact same number he got there in '14
Cuomo up 72-28% in Queens with about 2/3 in there. He won it 72-22% over Teachout in the 2014 Dem primary.		In Staten Island, with nearly 90% counted, he's up 74-26% after winning it 66-30% in '14.		In Brooklyn, he's up 60-40% with 60% in. Won it 65-27% in '14.
@jpodhoretz Well-played
@ForecasterEnten She wasn't alone apparently!
Almost 1/3 of the Bronx is in and Cuomo is getting....84%.
Cynthia Nixon -- sort of like Bernie Sanders in 2016 -- needed to make serious inroads with nonwhite voters to have a chance at victory. But in the final Siena poll she trailed Cuomo 74-17% w/ black voters (and had only a 33/34% fav/unfav rating!) and 69-23% with Latinos.

NBC News will make no official characterization of this race but the @SteveKornacki Twitter handle is calling the Delaware Democratic Senate primary for Tom Carper
Also I retract my snarky, dumb comment about the sluggish vote-counting in Delaware. Instead of a slow, steady drip, we got two giant bursts and less than an hour after poll closing more than 2/3 of precincts are now tallied and reported.
Update: 70% now in and it's Carper 64-36%.
Carper is getting 58% in the city of Wilmington, 62% in the rest of New Castle County, and 68% in Sussex County. Nothing in from Kent County yet.
42% of Delaware vote all just came in -- 63-37% Carper

My favorite MA stat tonight: By defeating challenger Josh Zakim, Secretary of State Bill Galvin has now won three Dem primaries after losing at the state party convention — 1994 for Sec of State and 1990 for Treasurer before this.
@daveweigel What I get for not threading tweets  https://t.co/mjusQhTm0k
In 1998, Somerville -- which he was mayor of at the time -- came through *huge* for Capuano:		Capuano 56%	Flynn 11%	Clapprood 10%	O'Connor 9%	Bachrach 8%	Gabrieli 3%		In 2018, not so much:		Capuano 50.3%	Pressley 49.6%
In the MA Gov Dem primary, Jay Gonzalez has defeated Bob Massie, who was the LG candidate on the '94 Dem ticket that got just 29% against mega-popular Bill Weld. The '18 climate is better for Dems, but Charlie Baker looks about as formidable as Weld back then.
Oh and James Michael Curley before JFK https://t.co/WL140pL1Ta
@CrassPolitical Yes! Inexcusable omission!
The district numbering/configuration has evolved through the years, but essentially the lineage of this MA-7 seat now looks like this:		- John F. Kennedy (1946-1952)	- Tip O'Neill (1952-1986)	- Joe Kennedy II (1986-1998)	- Michael Capuano (1998-2018)	- Ayanna Pressley (2018 -  )
When Capuano won this seat in 1998, he did it by edging out a pro-life Dem, former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, in the primary, 22-20%.
Ayanna Pressley now poised to become the first black female to represent Massachusetts in Congress. The state did have a black senator, Ed Brooke, from 1967 to 1979.
Mike Capuano won this seat in 1998 when he defeated 9 Democratic opponents with 22% of the vote. He was never seriously challenged after that until this year -- and now 80 minutes after polls closed he has conceded defeat to Ayanna Pressley.
10-term Democratic Rep. Mike Capuano https://t.co/Zgq9YR2lKC
About 18% of the Boston vote now counted -- Pressley leading there 57-43%		Meanwhile, city of Somerville (Capuano's base) has him leading 50.3%-49.6% there, but unclear how much of the vote is in.
Finally we have AP numbers for MA-7 starting to come in -- they have Pressley up 1,702 to 1,495. All from Boston precincts.

@NickRiccardi Do you mean in terms of Ward saying she should be next in line and trying to stir GOP backlash against the appointee? Backlash I'm wondering about is more with general election swing voters who might think the appointment of a candidate they just rejected is too cute
Basically I'm wondering if the appointment of a defeated McSally would rub voters the wrong way and linger through '20 with a small but potentially crucial number of them
Trying to think of a precedent for this and best I can come up with is Howard Metzenbaum: Loses OH Senate race in '70; then gets appointed to OH's other seat when it becomes vacant in '74, then loses Dem primary that same year to John Glenn (and finally wins a seat in '76). https://t.co/GGOKW7BulC

This goes hand in hand with the portion of this poll previously released that put Trump's approval at 36%. Right now, the RCP average still has him at 41.8% (down from 43.7% last week). 36% on Election Day would be dire for the GOP. https://t.co/LpncuYWQIy

@_Drew_McCoy_ I think after? Rudy backed W in '00 over McCain, although he did side with McCain when Pataki and the state GOP tried to keep him off the primary ballot (which I'm guessing had more to do with Rudy vs. Pataki politics...)
They ended up in such different places politically that it's easy to forget what allies they once were.

Context: The '98 poll was taken immediately after Clinton's admission of a relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Asked what should happen next, respondents said:	Stop whole investigation 52%	Continue whole investigation 26%	Stop Lewinsky aspect of investigation, continue rest 18%
Mueller investigation (Fox News poll, August 2018)	Approve 59%	Disapprove 37%		Starr investigation (Fox News poll, August 1998)	Approve 36%	Disapprove 44%
@yesmam47 Many examples in the House, but I’m talking about Senate appointments
@ShelleyDeFord @HardballChris Carnahan was appointed to fill the seat her husband Mel had been posthumously elected to - but he was a governor then and not a senator

Notably, the report features no video or photos of Muriel Humphrey's swearing-in, just a series of Supreme Court-style sketches. Television cameras weren't allowed in the Senate until 1986.
“In a soft, strong voice Mrs. Humphrey took her oath of office”: NBC Nightly News reports on the swearing-in of Hubert Humphrey’s widow to replace him in the Senate on January 25, 1978: https://t.co/cHseGeY5Lq
Before ‘92, you have to go back to 1978, when there were 2 spousal appointments:	*Maryon Allen of Alabama to replace Jim Allen; she ran in the special election but lost the Sept. Dem primary	*Muriel Humphrey to replace Hubert Humphrey; she declined to run in the special election
(In 2000, Jean Carnahan, the widow of Mel Carnahan, was appointed to fill the Missouri seat he’d been elected to posthumously, but he was never actually a senator)
The last time a spouse was appointed to fill a vacancy caused by a senator’s death was in September 1992, when North Dakota’s Jocelyn Burdick replaced the late Quentin Burdick. She declined to run in the special election and held the seat for four months: https://t.co/CgafJL1wqt

@AlexParkerDC Right, I mean, pundits expressed amazement at his recklessness and wondered what would have happened if it had come out during the '96 campaign, but it's not like the scandal broke and WH lawyers were like, "Phew, we're in the clear because this is a *post-election* crime."
@AlexParkerDC "There's no issue because it happened after the 1996 election" was at no point a pro-Clinton talking point in '98, or ever, until now.
Also, Edwards was ultimately acquitted on one count and the jury deadlocked on five others, and the government then dropped the case https://t.co/Ff4R9kCo4U

So, it was David Pecker's National Enquirer that almost single-handedly chased down the John Edwards paternity story, which led directly to Edwards being charged with...a conspiracy to illegally use campaign funds in order to conceal a politically damaging affair.
Trump has leaned on the National Enquirer throughout his political career -- this was how he answered questions about his electability when he was toying with a presidential run in 1999: https://t.co/taJvh2pBjP

@AlexParkerDC I also think, based on the comments I'm seeing on here, that it's getting muddied by all the other stuff around Trump -- like, "How can you say this is the same -- Clinton wasn't a tool of Putin!"
@AlexParkerDC I think that's the point -- he committed perjury to prevent the scandal from breaking, and thus to avoid the fallout that would come with its exposure. Just like candidate Trump allegedly committing a crime to prevent a scandal and to avoid the fallout that would come with it.
@AlexParkerDC Well thank you!
@AlexParkerDC I don't see the huge difference between a candidate committing a crime to conceal something that might cost him the election and a president committing a crime to conceal something that might lead to his removal from office.
@HashtagGriswold It was also the conclusion the majority of Americans reached -- Gallup, 12/98: https://t.co/FqoNhvJefd
@daveweigel Without that extra push, my hunch has always been that Torch stays in and loses narrowly — mainly because the 02 climate was so friendly for GOP. Conversely, my hunch is strongly anti-Trump ‘18 tide saves Menendez, absent a September/October twist
@daveweigel What caused the floor to fall out for Torch, who was tied 37-37% at this same point in 02, was the late Sept release of a prosecutor’s memo that vouched for the guy (David Chang) who claimed he bought favors from Menendez. (Plus an explosive WNBC interview with Chang)
@daveweigel I mostly agree with this and also their actions were shaped by 02 — which showed them they can line up behind a scandalized incumbent to start with and then later pull the plug if his poll numbers collapse
@minedyingbride Not misleading at all. I assumed most would understand the 9/11 context — and 61% is 61%.
Like now, 02 was a midterm year with a GOP president. But George W. Bush’s approval in NJ was 61% at this point that year; Trump is at 33% in this one
By contrast, at this same point in 02 — when another Dem incumbent tainted by corruption accusations faced a challenging reelection — Qpac had Bob Torricelli and Doug Forrester tied at 37%.

@CHueyBurns That’s a catchy title!
...if November '18 produces what November '98 didn't -- a wave against the president's party -- the politics might then look different than they did at any point in the 1998 saga.
By contrast, Trump right now is at 42% in Gallup. We will see what happens, obviously -- if there's any erosion with R voters now, if nervous R's look toward November and bolt, or if there's even some kind of rally-around effect like there was with Clinton. But...
That’s the difference I see – Clinton began the saga at 60% approval in Gallup and his support *increased* as it all played out, culminating in a shocking elections. At every point Dems had instincts to bolt, the message they got was: You don't need to.
That basically settled it. Gingrich was ousted as Speaker and the GOP went ahead with impeachment anyway, but only 5 Dems in the House and 0 in the Senate went along – and a larger number of Republicans ended up siding against it	https://t.co/SXv9MubkDD	https://t.co/88kjNmqCGY
The public sided with Democrats. By Election Day, Clinton’s approval rating hit nearly 70% and after predictions months earlier that they would face a Watergate-style bloodbath, Dems actually *gained* seats – almost unheard of for the WH party in a midterm https://t.co/Fnmp1hGFXC
But most Dems by then settled on a different message: They condemned Clinton’s behavior, called for a censure, and argued that impeachment was wild overreach – the opposition party using the findings of a prosecutor on a witch hunt to try to overturn the results of an election
Even then, there was Dem apprehension that they were missing something – a hidden disgust with Clinton that might cost their party in the November midterm. When the GOP-led House voted to open an impeachment inquiry in early 10/98, 31 Dems voted with them	https://t.co/PML8q9MogL
The story of ’98 was of the political world waiting for a public backlash against Clinton that never came – not in January when the Lewinsky story broke; August when Clinton admitted it; or September when Starr formally accused him of crimes: https://t.co/UEnXwHCm4u
So what saved Clinton in 1998? Yes, it was that his party stuck with him and Republicans couldn’t get a 2/3 Senate vote to convict. But why did Democrats stick with him in the first place? The answer there boils down to: public opinion.
Obviously, not all details align – Trump's would be a crime aimed at preventing him from losing an election; Clinton’s was a crime aimed at preventing the public from knowing something that might cause him to lose his presidency. Some see a big, bright distinction there; I don’t
The parallels are glaring. Trump has just been implicated in a crime to conceal a politically damaging affair. At almost this exact same moment in 1998, Bill Clinton was also accused of a crime, perjury, to conceal a politically damaging affair with Monica Lewinsky.
I spent a big chunk of the last few years reliving the Clinton impeachment drama in 1998 for my book and want to say something about the parallels between then and now, which are considerable -- with one potentially big difference
@AlexParkerDC Yep, exactly. I'm not sure Clinton could have survived '98 without the Flowers scandal happening in 92. (And not sure he could have survived that without Hart first getting torpedoed in '87.)
@AlexParkerDC Also thinking the interviews with supporters who stand by the president will be similar now to what they were then: https://t.co/ZRpupMJ5J6
@AlexParkerDC It does remind me some of reaction to Bill Clinton in '98 perjuring himself to cover up an affair. Gave opponents grounds to push for impeachment, which then gave supporters grounds to claim opponents were using a "technical" crime as a pretense for overturning an election
Muskingum (Zanesville area) is Balderson's base, where he ran up giant numbers on election day. Franklin (Columbus/immediate burbs) is where O'Connor ran up the score, and in fact is the only county he won.
OH-12 update: Provisionals from Delaware and Muskingum Counties now tabulated, increasing Balderson's overall to lead by 247 votes -- new margin is 1,811. Richland and Marion County numbers expected tomorrow; Licking and Franklin on Friday.
@MatHelman Well not really do with Torch, no. He was 15 points down in Dem polls when the party forced him off the ballot in his 02 re-elect. Only then did NJ prefer the Dem candidate, Lautenberg, to the R
@Cranmer3483 In this one race in this one state I do find it plausible that 5-10% might
And Sabrin is not totally anonymous in NJ. He’s run in several statewide GOP primaries in recent years and back in ‘97 got 5% as the Libertarian candidate when Whitman was barely re-elected over McGreevey
I do find it plausible that given a choice between a Dem who just got a hung jury in a corruption trial and someone from Trump’s party, NJ would still favor the Dem but with a larger than normal number opting for a 3rd party candidate as a protest
Take this with the appropriately large grain of salt, and I am anxious for serious independent polling in this race. But for now here’s a poll for the third party candidate in NJ that has Menendez with just 40% but still up 10 on the GOP nominee... https://t.co/EpkqV0aHqV

(I remain slightly curious if Ganim will get any benefit of the doubt in my family's home city of Waterbury, where four mayors since WWII have gone to jail and where a certain twice-imprisoned former governor is also from)
And now Lamont has even taken the lead in Bridgeport...
By my rough estimate, Ganim's going to need approximately 44,000% of the vote in Bridgeport to pull this out
With 94% of the vote in the Democratic primary so far, Bernie Sanders has beaten back a challenge from an opponent who argued he was insufficiently aligned with the party. His first act as the winner will be to renounce the nomination and run as an independent.

@davidgaffen Yes it’s a good point. Muskingum definitely exaggerated by hometown effect. I’m less sure how big a factor it was in Franklin. But Balderson was close to Trump levels in rural areas. I think I should have said the divide is hardening more than intensifying.
Two interesting takes on the bigger implications of the stark metro/rural divide seen in OH-12. @henryolsenEPPC on how R's can ramp up rural energy and @ThePlumLineGS arguing any such effort could just stir more suburban backlash: https://t.co/2stdsCRvbP   https://t.co/BIVHcS6U9g
Some voters use third party candidates as an expression of very specific ideological views. Others use them as a much more general form of protest against the two major parties. https://t.co/xe6BnCsu4z
@dznyc I would guess many stayed home -- the third party vote was much higher in OH-12 in 2016. But are there a few hundred voters like I'm describing? I could see that easily
For these disgruntled R's, the Green candidate would have been a way of saying "none of the above."
The Green candidate's total could end up larger than the Balderson/O'Connor margin when OH-12 provisionals are in. General assumption is these are lefty/otherwise Dem voters -- but don't forget the R's who can't stomach Trump but also can't bring themselves to vote Dem. https://t.co/83Aq4dozIW
@amyewalter This is what we have now (doesn't include provisionals and any uncounted absentees that are yet to be counted): 	Franklin 71,291 / 35.2%	Delaware 58,850 / 29.1%%	Licking 38,575 / 19%	Richland 12,931 / 6.4%	Muskingum 11,719 / 5.8%	Morrow 7,355 / 3.6%	Marion 1,800 / 0.9%

@pbump Yes - definitely a factor, esp. in Muskingum I'd say. But Balderson also at/close to Trump levels in the other rural areas
(These are the OH-12 portions of Franklin and Muskingum, not the entire counties)
To judge from OH-12, the metro/suburb vs. rural/exurban divide of the Trump-era is intensifying:		Franklin County (Columbus/immediate burbs)	'12: Obama +3	'16: Clinton +18	'18: O'Connor +31		Muskingum County (Zanesville/rural)	'12: Obama +0.15	'16: Trump +29	'18: Balderson +33
@Lisa_K_Cutler @tbonier To be clear, some number of them likely have been mailed by voters and have yet to be received. By state law, anything postmarked by 8/6 (Monday) will be counted. But many of those 5,048 likely just won't be returned. (Also, some of them are likely military...)
(That said, if you just extrapolate what's already been counted in Johnson, it would be enough for Colyer to catch Kobach statewide. But so far I'd say Kobach is stronger in Johnson than expected.)
Irony if Kobach, now up by 533 votes, holds on in KS GOP primary: With all of the outstanding precincts in giant, suburban Johnson County, he'd be winning by holding his own in exactly the county in which GOP leaders fear he'd stir a backlash in the fall
@jpodhoretz Also just a good illustration of how far the GOP's potential trouble extends beyond just the Clinton/GOP districts...
A shaky showing for the No. 4 House Republican, Cathy McMorris-Rodgers, in the WA-5 open primary last night has some echoes of 1994, when then-House Speaker Tom Foley's awful open primary showing in the same district portended November carnage for his party (and him): https://t.co/QPB2ToZhH3
@henryolsenEPPC Oh yes. I didn’t mean for this to suggest a Dem path to victory. I’d expect relatively few uncounted absentees to be returned (and some to be military). But I do think a recount is possible...not that I’d expect it to actually lift O’Connor into the lead.
@jbarro Trying to find out -- expectation seems to be not a ton many. A small share of these are also military ballots that could still be en route too.
@EricColumbus @OlmsteadTrinity Yes - Franklin is making up a bigger share of the vote than in '16, and O'Connor is running almost 10 points better than Clinton did there
OH-12:	*Balderson up by 1,754	*Recount if the margin is &lt;0.5%	*It's 0.9% now	*There are 3,435 provisionals, which should skew Dem	*And 5,048 uncounted absentees, which were mailed but not returned. Any sent by yesterday can still be counted	*Provisionals not counted for 11 days
I think if you told Dems before tonight they'd get 65% in Franklin with comparatively good turnout, they'd have been ready to celebrate.		But while energy was lower in the rural areas, Balderson racked up Trump-like levels in them. And he prevented further erosion in Delaware.
How Balderson's numbers compare to Trump's...		Franklin 	Trump 38%	Balderson 34.5%		Delaware	Trump 55%	Balderson 54%		Licking	Trump 62%	Balderson 61%		Muskingum 	Trump 62%	Balderson 66%		Richland	Trump 62%	Balderson 59%		Morrow	Trump 72%	Balderson 70%		Marion	Trump 72%	Trump 68%
“By state law, outstanding provisionals and absentees are not tabulated before the 10th day following the Election.” https://t.co/E2bEeToLN0
Balderson obviously in very good shape here, but NBC is not yet calling him the winner because with 3,435 provisionals to be counted it’s possible Balderson’s margin will dip under 0.5% and trigger a mandatory recount

New NBC/WSJ poll (conducted 7/15-18)		Trump job performance:	Approve 45%	Disapprove 52%		Generic ballot:	Dem 49%	GOP 43%
George Will’s latest column lays out why it’s possible Bob Menendez might prove vulnerable in NJ.  		But his column last month calling for voters to turn on the GOP to check Trump is probably the very argument that saves Menendez. https://t.co/UFp4kHaNGE
@rudnicknoah Well I don’t know if any of this helped, but I sure do enjoy the reminiscing
@rudnicknoah Ah I guess I’m just thinking in terms of the big picture atmosphere. ‘90 also had a 3rd party candidate win CT gov and the Conservative Party candidate get 20%+ in NY, maybe that contributed?
@rudnicknoah The congressional pay raise was huge deal at the time. S&amp;L bailout too. Just a mass of anger swelling up against the political system in general would be my guess for the cause.
@rudnicknoah It did presage Perot. The man who launched this quixotic campaign in ‘90 also launched a draft Perot effort in ‘91 and became a key player in Perot/Reform Party politics the rest of the decade 	https://t.co/AvlqCAymw4

@NickRiccardi And it doesn’t in this one, which has it at 45%. But I do wonder if the unusual level of criticism from the right, which has yet to abate, will erode this by next week. Already the CBS poll (taken a day after this one) has approval of his summit handling 11 points lower w/ R’s.
And now here’s a CBS poll conducted Tuesday and Wed (Axios/Survey Monkey was a Monday and Tuesday). Overall 32/55% approval of Trump handling of Putin summit:		Dem 8/83%	GOP 68/21%	IND 29/53%		https://t.co/MT9lyRXljs
I’ve watched a lot of coverage from the right this week, though, and there’s a *lot* more criticism of him than usual. This is one poll conducted immediately after the presser — I’m wondering if it might be picking up more reflexive siding with Trump than we’d see now.
Survey Monkey/Axios poll conducted Monday and Tuesday finds approve/disapprove of Trump’s handling of Putin press conf at 40/58%. Party breakdown: 		Dem: 7/91%	GOP: 79/18%	Ind: 33/62%		https://t.co/GZuZBk5b5h

@reesetheone1 You remember this segment very differently from me...
Let me put it this way: If you know the story of how Crowley got to Congress in the first place, you’d wonder if he’ll try a maneuver like this to stay in Congress. https://t.co/nkrGbsRdoJ
(And, jumping way, way ahead here, but if he were to run third party and win, have to figure he’d return to the House with his Democratic leadership path destroyed)
There’s still no indication Crowley is actually backing off his pledge to support Ocasio-Cortez. But I do wonder if he’s holding on to the WFP line as a contingency if circumstances change and he decides there’s an opening to run on it and win.
@rincon71 Thanks!!

@mrcnewcome very nice of you to say - thanks!

(Pathetic self-promotion of the day: This is also where my book, which comes out on October 2, begins.)
"I saw congressmen and their wives with tears in their eyes."		34 years ago tonight, Mario Cuomo's keynote address at the 1984 Democratic convention transformed him into a political giant who would hover over the next two presidential races -- but never run. https://t.co/xOi5BxRY67
@KeystoneObsrvr @jpodhoretz That's a good point, especially since the bottom really fell out with Torch -- down 15+ in his own polls by the end of September. Even if Menendez ends up in trouble, hard to see it getting that bad.
@SeanTrende Yes, the Torricelli-Lautenberg example can't be cited enough here
@jpodhoretz There's always the example of '02: When it was clear Torch was going down, natl Dems panicked and he was forced out 5 weeks before election day, w/ state Supreme Court then allowing Dems to sub in Lautenberg
@jpodhoretz I still suspect the climate is too hostile to R's in NJ, but the D primary results suggest more antipathy to Menendez than we thought at first. Open to the possibility if more polling shows this. That said...
Agreed. Gravis has Menendez up 43-41% in NJ. 		At roughly this same point in '02 -- when Dem Bob Torricelli was running under a very similar ethical cloud -- a Qpac poll had the race at 37-37%. Of course, natl environment was much more favorable to R's in 02. https://t.co/6gBpg1zcSg
Schumer just now labels Putin "the number one enemy we have probably on the globe." Calls to mind the language used by Romney in '12 ("number one geopolitical foe").
Yes, balance my previous tweet with the reality that we've supposedly experienced The Moment Trump Loses The GOP many times since '15-- and it's never panned out. So far, every eruption has quickly been eclipsed by something else and faded into memory. Will today linger at all? https://t.co/3QDgh9PNkv
Trump's approval rating has been extremely high within his own party, second only to post-9/11 W at this point of his presidency. Which makes the *harsh* criticisms (and lack of public defense) I'm seeing now from the right potentially significant.
That question from @JonLemire was perfectly phrased and asked
@jbview that too!
(and of course the opposite of the last one -- people who like Trump self-selecting out of Russia coverage)
@JonnyAkchin Yes - was running out of characters but hope that was implied there
Can be read a few ways obviously. People absorbing coverage and responding negatively to Trump as a result of what they hear about Russia, or people who already don't like Trump (because of Russia or anything else) seeking out coverage they expect to be negative.
In the latest NBC/WSJ poll, Trump's overall approval rating is 44%. But there's a split between those who say they...		Follow Russia probe closely: 40% approve/59% disapprove	Don't follow Russia probe closely: 52% approve/43% disapprove
(Iran-Contra surely had something to do with this — Oliver North hearings were that summer)
Different story in '91 when Bush nominated Clarence Thomas. Initial support that July per Gallup was 51-17%. Anita Hill allegations/hearings weren't till October. Even after that support for Thomas was steadily over 50% --  55-27% in USA Today/Gallup for instance
Most interesting to me is the environment of '87 -- Bork was a major lightning rod in American politics, but one month after his nomination, few voters even had an opinion. WaPo poll found 55% had read/heard *nothing* about his nomination.
Going back further, the earliest numbers for Robert Bork in '87 -- an LA Times poll six weeks after he was nominated -- had his support at 21-14%.
Fox poll has support for confirming Kavanaugh at 38-32% -- same ballpark as initial numbers for Harriet Miers in '05 (nomination ultimately withdrawn) and Elena Kagan in '10 (confirmed 63-37) https://t.co/xmur9ItlDg

@lybabash That’s the number from January. The new one is on top, with previous results listed below it for comparison.

5 Dem senators represent states where 50%+ say abortion should be mostly/all illegal: 	Manchin (WV)	McCaskill (MO)	Heitkamp (ND)	Donnelly (IN)	Jones (AL)		3 R's represent states where &lt;35% say the same:	Murkowski (AK)	Heller (NV)	Collins (ME) https://t.co/dKVMHNkugi
@hsmazin As I said on the air, Democratic defections -- since there already were three of them on Gorsuch
@hsmazin For the record, I also covered that extensively on the air yesterday and today -- not that you would know it from this post
An ideological motive is strongly suggested here, but there's a different reason I focused on the possibility of a GOP SCOTUS defection: I cover politics and that's the main political question. If there's no GOP defection, Dems have zero power to stop it. 	https://t.co/ypCx9Y9Ofn
GOP No votes on Republican Supreme Court nominations:  		Bork '87	Chafee (RI)	Specter (PA)	Stafford (VT)	Packwood (OR)	Warner (VA)	Weicker (CT)		Kennedy '88	NONE		Souter '90	NONE		Thomas '91	Packwood (OR)	Jeffords (VT)		Roberts '05	NONE		Alito '06	Chafee (RI)		Gorsuch '17	NONE

With more than 80% of the vote in, a 28-year-old member of the Democratic Socialists of America has a double-digit lead over a 10-term incumbent who was thought to be the next Democratic leader of the House.
What's happening with Crowley right now is probably making Mike Capuano uneasy....
A version of Crowley's district, NY-14, was the home to Archie Bunker and All in The Family and was once represented by Geraldine Ferraro. Today it is more than 70% nonwhite.
For years, the biggest obstacle to Joe Crowley was a poisonous relationship with Nancy Pelosi, which kept him from climbing the Dem leadership ranks. 		Now, he's finally worked that out and is poised as her successor -- but is in real danger right now in his own backyard
Crowley has held this seat since '98, but worth remembering how he got it: a post-deadline maneuver by his mentor, former Rep. Tom Manton, that headed off a competitive open race: https://t.co/uWW2RO8Iul

Last big city mayors to run for Dem WH nomination were John Lindsay and Sam Yorty in '72 -- no one since (or maybe you feel like counting Irvine's Larry Agran in '92...)
With the party coalition increasingly urban/metropolitan, seems like we're about to see a lot more ambitious Dems, especially in red states, use mayoralties as direct steppingstones to the national arena -- less imperative to win statewide office in between https://t.co/JzcYfa6mM8
And this particular anecdote is definitely featured... https://t.co/HqfusZzGa8
@CHRONICLESOF_E No, he came out and resigned more than 3 months later. In between, he was an openly gay person serving as governor.
@Hoosier47906 That is....completely beside the point. He was the first openly gay person to serve as a governor. He announced he was gay, then signed and vetoed bills, made appointments and issued executive orders (including a major one on campaign finance). That is called “serving” in office
@m_travin @hardball He was asked as part of a regular segment called “Tell Me Something I Don’t Know” to share a news item he found interesting. He chose a story about the study. In reaction, I asked another guest for her take on it. You are trying too hard to see something that wasn’t there.
@m_travin @hardball Great point! Except the part where I immediately asked a female guest for her reaction to it. But thanks for watching, really.
@Haunsie He publicly announced he is gay. Then he served as governor for 3+ months. I am saying nothing more and nothing less than that.
@Haunsie This has nothing to do with heroism. History isn’t written so everyone can feel good.
@Haunsie Not only is this unnecessarily personal, it’s also wrong. He *served* as an openly gay governor from August 12, 2004 until his resignation on November 15. So yes, he was the first to serve.
Also, McG becoming the first gay Gov in 04 got far more natl coverage than Polis being elected the first in 18 likely would, which says something about media East Coast bias, something about the tabloid nature of McG’s situation, and something about how much the world has changed
@anindiantravels That’s a difference, not a technicality
Anyway, I was there, I covered it, it was all very strange, and the answer to the question “Who is the first openly gay man to serve as a governor?” is Jim McGreevey.
It was a very bizarre situation with a corruption investigation already around him and an ex-lover (who’d been appointed by McGreevey to a top security post he had no business holding) threatening him with exposure.
@anindiantravels I don’t think it’s technical at all. It was a major national news event when he announced it and he then served as governor for several more months.
@aoneill He didn’t resign on the spot. In fact, he stood down Dem powerbrokers who wanted him out right away and continued the work of a governor through November. That’s serving.
Polis apparently would be the first elected, but McGreevey was the first to serve
@dankennedy_nu Yes see second tweet. But the article says “to serve,” not “to be elected”
McGreevey announced he was a “gay American” in 2004, three years after he was elected, amidst a swirl of scandal and served in office three more months before resigning

@OneJerseySchorr @geoffreyvs @MonmouthPoll @PollsterPatrick @Sen_JoeManchin @MorriseyWV @DonBlankenship 50-34% Manchin
Here's the full breakdown for the question: What policy do you prefer for handling families stopped crossing the border without documentation? https://t.co/AO4iKOJBLc
Also when given these choices for how to handle the situation:		Release all &amp; order adults to report back at later date: 19%	Detain families together while awaiting court date: 44%	Arrest adults/separate from kids: 12%	Arrest adults AND kids, send kids to juvenile detention: 8%
Interesting contrast in the Economist/YouGov poll. The family separation policy at the border is very unpopular: 29% approve/54% disapprove. 		But the broader "zero tolerance" policy of arrest/jail for all illegal crossings has plurality support: 46-37%		https://t.co/8pTawTMZc7
@databyler Great job on it -- it's good info and really easy to use/understand
Based on his simulations, @databyler puts the current likelihood of the GOP holding the Senate at 69%. Interestingly, his model was already very bullish on Manchin surviving in WV, and now a new poll has him up 9. https://t.co/duzo1QeBEO
Remember that Dems wanted Morrisey instead of Jenkins as Manchin's opponent. I wrote this at the time about why this was their calculation:    https://t.co/NdOKOTyDTq
Notably, Manchin leads by 16 -- 50 to 34% -- in the WV-3 portion of the state -- again an areas Trump won by 50.		R's could have nominated the congressman from WV-3, Evan Jenkins, but he narrowly lost to primary to Morrisey, a transplanted New Jerseyan who lives in the north. https://t.co/VF31BeTj4X
Monmouth also has Joe Manchin up 9 -- 48 to 39% -- over Patrick Morrisey in WV	https://t.co/uKtVoffpH6
But registered Dems still outnumber R's, still win local office, and a Dem (Nick Rahall) still represented WV-3 in the House through 2014. Now it's an open seat and the Dem nominee is a vet who voted for Trump in '16.
WV-3 is the quintessential "ancestral" Dem district that has swung to the GOP in national politics. In '96, Clinton won it by 26 points, and Gore even carried it four years later. Then it went W +7 in '04, McCain +14 in '08, Romney +32 in '12, and Trump +50 in '16
Monmouth has Dem up 2 points in WV -- which went for Trump by 50 points in 2016 https://t.co/wij4kQYgFC

The CA primary was two weeks ago today. Since then, more than 2 million additional ballots have been counted, with ~900,000 to come.		So far, the post-election counting has moved the margin:		GOV: D+1.1	CA-10: R+0.6	CA-21: R+1.4	CA-39: D+0.8	CA-45: D+2.6	CA-48: R+0.2	CA-49: D+0.9 https://t.co/hlYqPXhGxf
New update after the weekend (Monday 10am EST) https://t.co/YC4pbcgBQ2

To anyone asking some version of "Why won't Republicans stand up to Trump?" the answer is: Mark Sanford.  (Also accepted: Martha Roby)
10 years ago this week, the talk was whether Mark Sanford would wind up on the GOP ticket with John McCain
Mark Sanford potentially getting bounced for insufficient loyalty to Trump says a lot about GOP politics right now. So does the fact that the challenger leading the pro-Trump charge used to sing a very different tune about him: https://t.co/PUYjG7urFY

Earliest SC-1 returns have Sanford up 48.3%-48.1% over Arrington but with a fringe third candidate holding him under 50% -- the magic number to avoid a runoff

@Redistrict Also 48 is all in one county, Orange, and has so far moved +0.2 for the GOP and -0.2 for Dems so far, with about 20k ballots counted since the primary. Anyway, I said I'd follow it, and I'll wait to see where it lands now.
@Redistrict That would make sense! Seeing the same in 39 too -- GOP up 0.2, Dems down 0.1 --  which I guess could be due to the LA County slice? Although looks like there are still OC votes too
For instance, this is what I've tracked so far in CA-21: https://t.co/9J65RzGchD

To add to this -- the current results could change as more results come in. But keep in mind, from this same point (day after primary) forward in '16, the votes added to the count only moved the final margin toward Dems by 1.4 points in CA-48, 1.7 in CA-39 and 0.5 in CA-49. https://t.co/OdHTShDmbw
I'm going to try to do this in more districts but this is in line with my sense that in districts like the 7 CA battlegrounds, the post-primary vote tallying doesn't tend to move to overall number much.
Did this for a few more districts:	CA-39: Vote counted by the morning after the primary was 61.6-38.4% GOP. Vote counted after that was 56-44% GOP. It made up about 20% of all votes. 	CA-49: Was 51.4-45.2% GOP morning after primary. Vote counted after that was 49.4-46.2% GOP.
OK, I believe we were able to recreate CA-48 from '16:	* As of the morning after primary, it was 57-43% GOP	* 28,805 votes added to the tally after that -- 17% of all votes in the primary. 	* They went 53.3-46.7% for the GOP	* Final result was 56.6/43.4% GOP https://t.co/NmjbtPq7sT
@SeanTrende Had the same reaction. My instinct was that there'd be pretty big disparities in different directions.
Here's a comparison of the how total Dem/GOP vote in the 7 battleground CA districts changed from the primary to the general in 2016 and 2014: https://t.co/59ytPtg0Gv
@DLeonhardt @davidbinder @mattmfm I only have two mins and can add more  later, but for example, here's party primary/general share in '14:	CA-10 	Primary: 57-43 GOP	General: 56-44 GOP	CA-21	Prim: 64-36 GOP	General: 58-42 GOP	CA-45 	Primary: 69-29 GOP	General: 65-35 GOP	CA-49	Primary: 61-39 GOP	General: 50-40 GOP
@williamjordann @PatrickRuffini @NickRiccardi Well now we're getting into the old GA-6 debate. Dems noting tightening of House race compared to '14/'16. GOP (for now -- we will see if numbers change much) stressing GOP House candidates outperforming Trump and hitting 50.
@PatrickRuffini @williamjordann @NickRiccardi My sense - and again, I could be wrong and am trying to track down more info - is that it's driven by LA County and large Dem areas with huge populations, lots of provisionals, and very slow counting and that the movement in districts like CA-49 are not as dramatic post-election
@PatrickRuffini @williamjordann @NickRiccardi They will change and I'm curious to see how. I suspect - and may be wrong - it won't actually be that much. From what I can tell, the post-election tallies in these districts haven't been dramatically more D. Like in '16, the 1/3 that came in post-election in CA49 was only D+2
@TylerDinucci No need! I think we talked it out and figured out where we're both coming from -- good use of this generally miserable platform!
@TylerDinucci Yep, I am too. I tried to make clear this is provisional and subject to change. How much/little change there is, that’s the next piece of the story...
@TylerDinucci For one, I see value in setting a clear benchmark to see how much these things actually do tend to shift toward Dems as the post-election tallies take place. This is not something I'm posting here and dropping.
@TylerDinucci Stressing that these aren't final. But looking back at '16, the post-election day votes didn't swing as dramatically in a lot of these districts as the statewide number did -- I think because LA County is such a factor statewide
@ShaneGoldmacher Fwiw, it looks like final Dem/Rep shares in these open primaries have matched up pretty well with the general election outcomes since CA went to this system
These tallies are *not* final, but right now here's the cumulative Dem/GOP % for the 7 battleground CA districts (held by R's now/won by Clinton in '16): https://t.co/lHqxIUsif3

In light of today's news, adding another to this thread..		From the fall of '98: As Bill Clinton is sidelined by scandal, Democratic congressional candidate Jay Inslee campaigns with a cardboard cutout of the First Lady, who has become the most popular political figure in America https://t.co/EuHXzyMAb2
In the Nov. 2016 election in CA, about 1/3 of the votes were counted within three hours of polls closing, half within six hours, and two-thirds within 12 hours. In other words, it could take a while tomorrow, and with mail-in ballots accepted post-election, it could be days.
The last time Gallup measured Bill Clinton's popularity was the end of last year -- 45% fav and 52% unfav. 		Maybe there's been a lasting reassessment of him by the public or maybe not -- because he has bounced back from *many* low points before: https://t.co/HurBQkyK0p
I’m also remembering this Bill Clinton interview by Peter Jennings from 15 years ago — same hair trigger defiance at questions about his “moral authority” as president https://t.co/5veZczTtvF
(That clip is from a 9/98 Washington Post story by Robert Kaiser and John Harris)
Clinton also asks @craigmelvin “Do you think President Kennedy should have resigned?”		This was also one of his favorite cards to play in 98 — like in this infamous Cabinet meeting exchange with Donna Shalala: https://t.co/074NdthVxr
His tone here — combative, aggrieved — really hasn’t changed in 20 years. This is the same Clinton the nation saw in that 7/98 primetime address in which he admitted the affair but stressed that “presidents have private lives.” https://t.co/C888LWL93t

Romney poised to move to .500 lifetime against Kennedys https://t.co/VO9JQd48zb
I am pointing this out as a cautionary note. It's very possible the recent generic ballot/Trump approval shifts mean the "blue wave" actually is receding. Also possible this moment will look very different a few months from now.
In fact, it was at this same point in '10 that Dems won a special election in southwest PA that had them claiming the potential GOP wave was already receding: https://t.co/bIziEhJ4vE
No RCP graph for '06, but the Dem generic ballot lead was very consistent -- large, often double-digits -- throughout the year. Three most recent polls at this point would have been: D+12, D+6, D+17 https://t.co/L6yQFU32Gk
In Sept 98, after Clinton had admitted to lying about Lewinsky, his score was 18% very positive/29% very negative. Weeks later, the House GOP voted to launch an impeachment probe. Then Clinton's score moved to 25% very positive/26% very negative, and in November Dems gained seats
1998 isn't listed here, but it's interesting to look at what happened to the "intensity" numbers then in light of the present day Dem leadership's hostility to impeachment talk... https://t.co/xjZoYxrxRJ
@IJefTomI There's no graph available for '06, but in that year the generic was pretty consistently a very large Dem advantage, including at this point.
And again from RCP, here's 2014: https://t.co/26MnlZjmtk
From RCP, here's what 2010 looked like: https://t.co/xqOu8tirQI
On this day in both 2010 and 2014, Democrats actually *led* in the generic congressional ballot. In '10, it wasn't until July that Republicans took the lead for good and in '14 the separation point was just after Labor Day.

Obviously, this is just a Dem primary, but her rural strength and the turnout spikes we're seeing there make me suspect she has more potential than Gray to expand the normal Dem pie
DCCC recruited Gray in KY-6, but this map makes me think McGrath gives them a better shot in the fall. She's losing the one county even Hillary carried (Fayette) and cleaning up where Dems usually get buried.
*Huge* Dem turnout jump in rural KY-6 counties from Clinton/Sanders race in '16:		Nicholas County	Votes cast in '16: 835	Tonight: 1,622		Robertson	'16: 295	Tonight: 699		Bath	'16: 1,369	Tonight: 2,608
Meanwhile, in equally small Terrell County, which has the fifth highest concentration of black residents of Georgia's 159 counties, Abrams is crushing it in the early vote, 73-27%
In tiny, 99% white Towns County in far northern Georgia, Stacey Abrams looks like she's edged out Stacey Evans in the early vote -- 61 to 59

Holy cow the Celtics have a shot too...
Latest update from PA-7	Wild 8,263 31.9%	Morganelli 7,637 29.5%	Edwards 6,947 26.8%		The good news for Wild is that slightly more of the vote counted is from Northampton County, Morganelli's base, than Lehigh County. But there are more registered Dems in Lehigh.
Running tally from PA-7 Dem primary:		Wild 7,051 31.5%	Morganelli 6,598 29.8%	Edwards 6,008 26.1%
Looks like Reddick did well in the tiny Montgomery portion of PA-1, but Wallace leading across Bucks as the precincts come in. He's up 52-39% overall now
With more than 20,000 counted, Rick Saccone, last seen losing to Conor Lamb in the PA-18 special, now running 2,500 votes behind in the PA-14 GOP primary
It appears Northampton, Morganelli's base (he's in first with 37% there now), is making up a slightly disproportionate share of these returns...
Adding up the totals from the Northampton, Lehigh and Monroe County sites, the PA-7 Dem primary running totals now are:		Wild 5,416 30.4%	Morganelli 5,244 29.4%	Edwards 4,932 27.7%

@HotlineJosh Well said!
@HotlineJosh Not a great sign for Manchin, but also not convinced Morrisey is positioned to capitalize in coal country like Jenkins was
So basically: There are a lot of voters in WV-3 who have backed Manchin and Trump. I think Jenkins may have given R’s a better chance to tilt them away from Manchin this fall than Moriseey, who ran behind even Blankenship in WV-3.
WV-3 is an ancestrally Dem area where party registration hasn’t caught up w/ recent presidential voting trends and where local Dem candidates can still do well. But Jenkins has shown he can win over these voters – he ousted long-serving local Dem congressman, Nick Rahall, in 14
Jenkins meanwhile cleaned up in his congressional district, WV-3 – the southern 1/3 of the state. But this is *not* top-to-bottom GOP turf. Trump won here with 70+%, but…Manchin, running in a tough Senate race in the very GOP year of 2010, also dominated here. Take a look: https://t.co/5EDT4o9Na6
The reason has to do with this GOP primary map from @mcimaps last night: Morrisey won big in what are, top-to-bottom, the strongest Republican areas of the state – i.e. where probably any Republican will do quite well this fall	https://t.co/5rviQzL0vF
Dems wanted Blankenship in their ideal world, but I’m getting convinced their $$$ push to elevate Morrisey over Jenkins was smart...

NBC has called the WV GOP primary for Patrick Morrisey
Going to go live on here for a few mins if you feel like joining in... https://t.co/ilDTf8MHck
@FriendOfTheYeti UGH
If Morrisey wins, West Virginia's GOP ticket this fall will include a Senate nominee who previously ran for Congress in New Jersey and a congressman (Mooney) who previously ran for office in New Hampshire and served as a state legislator in Maryland.
Berkeley  County in the eastern Panhandle of WV has not reported any votes. It is the second largest county in the state and Morissey - who lives in Harper's Ferry nearby -- is cleaning up in the region so far.
NBC is characterizing the WV race as follows: Don Blankenship is running in 3rd place in both the raw vote and in our models and not leading in any region of the state.
Morrisey leading by about 3,000 votes in the statewide count right now. 1,800 of that is from Jefferson County, where he lives.
The wild card here is that what we have now is a mix of absentee and same-day votes, and it's unclear how much is from which pile
Blankenship also running in third in Marshall County, which is now WV's top coal county, with abut 20 percent in
In Raleigh County, WV, site of the Upper Big Branch tragedy, Blankenship running in third with 22% with about 11% of votes in
NBC now calls the WV Dem primary for Joe Manchin
NBC projects that Mike DeWine wins the Ohio GOP gubernatorial primary
NBC not yet calling the WV Dem primary. Joe Manchin leads activist Paula Jean Swearengin 67-33 with about 4% in. We are saying it's too early to call, with Manchin leading.

@databyler I was struck in the WV debate when they were asked to raise hands if they'd back McConnell as leader. Jenkins and Morrison hesitated and gave non-answers. Blankenship literally ducked behind his podium because "I don't want anyone to have any doubt about it." Place went wild.
@swatmeg thank you!
*IF* Blankenship wins tonight, one thing to look at is his performance in coal counties -- places that went huge for Trump in '16 but where Manchin was also able to win big in a competitive race in '10: https://t.co/tKo8VcRFFF

The Torch meets The Mooch https://t.co/dytJ9wdCNA
@nahmias Interesting, and obviously I defer to your grasp of those maneuverings. I'm just getting the sense that the broader Dem Party will not show the same deference to the legislature this time if it installs one of its own like with DiNapoli.
This is why I don't think this story ends with the legislature simply installing one of its own, a la DiNapoli in 07, and that being that. Too close to an election, too high-profile, too much Dem Party energy focused on this. https://t.co/D7927NNjTh
@jbarro @nickconfessore Worth noting the timing on this is very different too - final months of term with state convention weeks away vs. first months of term with time to become entrenched. 		More analogous than DiNapoli may be last legislature-appointed AG -Koppell in 94 - who then lost Dem primary
8 years ago, Eric Schneiderman led the push to expel a state senator who'd assaulted his girlfriend https://t.co/6kuSUupF85
The NY legislature picks a new AG if Schneiderman resigns, but my sense is that this would take some time -- while the NY Dem convention (where candidates can get on the September primary ballot) is just two weeks away
Koppell sought a full term in the 1994 election but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Karen Burstein
When NY Attorney General Robert Abrams resigned in 1993, the state legislature appointed a replacement, Assemblyman Oliver Koppell, who then served the final year of the term https://t.co/ve2kJcvSef

@nathanlgonzales I think the Trump era has shown how powerfully the right can be energized by angering the left. From that standpoint, I think a pick by McCain of the Joe Lieberman of 08 is underrated in terms of how the right would ultimately have viewed it.
@nickconfessore I think I'm making a different case. McCain was dissuaded by the threat of a conservative revolt, but my hunch is that the anger/betrayal cries from Democrats would have brought the right around. And maybe there's some (limited) boost for McCain by appearing bipartisan.
I don't think it would have changed the final result, but I always thought the political downside of McCain picking Lieberman was overstated and the upside understated https://t.co/sGvZtt0aMb

It's another way of saying that if McCaskill were at 45% vs. Hawley and Hillary Clinton were president (or if it was Obama in '14 or '10), she'd be toast. But in a Trump midterm, she's in the game.
The best thing that McCaskill and every other Trump state Dem up this year have going for them is that Trump is president.  		Since 94, senators up in states won by a president of the other party are 21-3 in midterms: https://t.co/kCfAz1Z84R

@JeffSmithMO I remember thinking this might work!
@kurtoonist I prefer it this way
@SeanTrende Yep. If it had been, say, 2010, Kean wins. (Unless Dems pull Menendez out at the last minute...)
One more thing to remember about Menendez: In the fall of '06 - his first Senate campaign - he was hit with a federal investigation. 		The story proved murky and with time didn't explode further, but it was a *major* PR problem.		But 06 was a Dem wave year, and he won by 9.
@jacobfhsmith He tried!
I'd be skeptical because of the climate. Trump's NJ approval was 32% in last Qpac measurement. When this same issue got Torricelli in 2002, there was also a GOP president, but W's NJ approval was *77%* at this same point. 		NJ Dems haven't lost a Senate race since 1972... https://t.co/LZlS1BCsDW
@PatrickRuffini Where are you getting +18 for '18? The state says 48.33% for GOP, 27.86 for Dem -- difference of 20.47.
If somehow the bottom does fall out for Menendez, the Torricelli precedent must be remembered: When he fell hopelessly behind in late 9/02, NJ Dems got a state Supreme Court ruling to switch him off the ballot for Frank Lautenberg, who then won easily. https://t.co/GoJ8tjJkcG
#tbt New Jersey senator, facing reelection campaign, "severely admonished" by Senate Ethics Committee https://t.co/KttEnclJTI
The transgressions are very similar and involve improper gifts. Torricelli was investigated by the feds, who declined to prosecute but kicked the matter to the ethics cmte. 		Menendez was tried for bribery w/ a hung jury. Prosecutors declined to retry and kicked it to the cmte.
...and here is the 2002 letter of admonition to Torricelli from the same committee: https://t.co/djcJqSW9Kf
Here is today's letter of admonition to Menendez from the ethics committee: https://t.co/FGlpIzZ5ms
The Senate Ethics Committee just "severely admonished" Bob Menendez. This is the exact same action it took against Bob Torricelli in 02.		Back then, it helped cost Torricelli his seat. In today's climate, Menendez remains a strong favorite to win reelection this year.
@PatrickRuffini *Other should be 0.45%, not 0.85%
@PatrickRuffini It was the same story in 14. I should have included: 	GOP 48.65%	Ind 25.67%	Dem 25.23%	Other 0.85%
The partisan whiplash on Comey has been something to watch. 		In early '17, when he was best known for the Clinton email saga, a Harris poll put his favorable/unfavorable score at 12/41% w/ Dems and 26/27% w/ Rs.		Today, a new Qpac poll has him at 49/20% w/ Dems and 8/67% w/ Rs.
AZ-8 is an example of why I tend to take early voting info with a big grain of salt. The party breakdown of the (very large) early voting universe was similar this year to 2016 -- slightly more GOP in fact. But the actual election results were a world apart: https://t.co/I6WTiIjMXc
@TruBluMajority Virginia is tricky with that - the Dems flipped a ton of seats, but they were in districts Clinton had already carried. Basically they synced up with the presidential race a year later.
@MattFriedmanNJ I mean, they did refuse to drop the matter *even after* she informed them they were in the presence of Ivy Leaguers...
@ForecasterEnten If he got a clear shot. I think one thing that scared Weicker off was the knowledge that there'd be a lot of resistance to him from Dems and then probably another candidate running, raising the possibility of an embarrassing 3rd place finish
@ForecasterEnten Maybe, but plenty of baggage from his governorship in between -- just like Chafee now
The dynamic here - vanquished ex-senator switches parties, seeks to avenge defeat with primary challenge - reminds me of when Lowell Weicker toyed with challenging Lieberman in the '06 Dem race, 18 years after their match-up. But Weicker might have had a real opening if he'd run. https://t.co/OVofiznDd7

@alanbail We have spotters on the ground
With ALL same-day vote is now in, here is the current tally in AZ-8:		Tiperneni (D): 82,318 47.4%	Lesko (R) 91,390 52.6%		All that is left to be counted now are early ballots that arrived by mail or were delivered in-person today. Based on past, there are about 16-17,000 of them.

@JMilesColeman I swear I was!!!!
@ForecasterEnten Nice of you to offer, but I just finished some curdled cheese myself
@JMilesColeman the lord's work
For the insomniacs among us...doing a quick update on AZ-8 on MS at 1:21 and a fuller breakdown at 1:50. Don't make me stay up alone!
@JoeTacopino not you!
Tiperneni needed about 62-63% of all same-day vote and early ballots returned today. More than half of early votes are counted now and she's only winning them 52-48%. It just won't be enough. 		But shaving 15+ points off Trump's margin here for Dems is very big.
NBC News is now calling AZ-8 for Debbie Lesko (R).
First batch of same day:	Tiperneni (D) 1,073 55%	Lesko (R) 878 45%		Remember Tiperneni needs 63% of what's left. We think there will be a total of 19,000 same-day votes, plus 16-17,000 early votes that were returned today.
RT @VaughnHillyard: Tipirneni is not conceding tonight, says she's waiting for results tomorrow. And with plans to run in November anyway,…
@JakeVandyne Yes. Plus early votes that either arrived by mail today or were dropped off in person. About 16-17,000 if past pattern holds
RT @JMilesColeman: In 2016, Clinton lost #AZ08 by 21%; tonight Hiral Tipirneni (D) is only losing by 6% to Debbie Lesko (R). Roughly 1/3 of…
@Sharpe222 Hopefully they're faster than Washington County
We want to see if there's any spike in Tiperneni's share when the early vote is counted. It's very unlikely, but let's see.		MSNBC is about to re-air Rachel Maddow's show from 9pm, BUT...I am staying here and if/when we are ready to make a call, I will be on-air.
Right now in AZ-8:		- Lesko leads 53-47% with 155k of about 190k votes counted	- Tiperneni will need about 63% of what's left -which are same-day votes and early ballots returned today	- Same-day returns start in about 20 mins	- NBC has *not* called the race
Coming back with an update on AZ-8 after this break
If the final turnout ends up closer to 190,000, which I'm starting to think it will be, Tiperneni would need 63% of remaining ballots. Again, extremely steep. But we will see what the same-day vote looks like.
This is absolutely consistent with the 15+ point swings we've seen in KS-4, MT, SC-5 and PA-18. But in this one, there was no glaring deficiency with the R nominee, no Dem nominee who strained for separation from DC, no recent Dem voting history, and no overriding local issue.
NBC News is not calling AZ-8 at this hour. Lesko is leading, but we are waiting to see some same-day ballot results. Tipperneni would probably need about 70% of them to win. *Extremely* steep challenge, but Dems have to love cutting Trump's '16 margin in district by 15+ points.
Question is how many more ballots are left. They have not counted any same-day or early ballots returned today.		If there are around 25,000 total left, Tiperneni would need to win 70% of them. This is about what the Sec of State's office has been predicting today.
The early vote is in:	Lesko (R) 82,294 53%	Tiperneni(D) 73,180 47%
Who doesn't love an election night? Tune in an follow along as the massive vote dump from AZ-8 hits in about 10 minutes! https://t.co/LJZukaAW6T
Also, the polls are closed but -- per state law -- they must wait an hour, till 11pmET, to release anything. So the official NBC declaration at this hour is that AZ-8 is...wait for it...too early to call.
@jpodhoretz Happy Election Night!
I'm wondering if there will be more of an energy-driven gap in tonight's same-day gap, but unless it's very close, I think the initial vote dump we get at 11:05pm should pretty much tell the story.
In the 2016 AZ '8 race, there was really no disparity between the early voting results and the results of same-day voting.		Early: 68.3-31.7% Franks (R)	Same-day: 68.9-31.1% Franks (R)	Total: 68.6%-31.4% Franks (R)

@Charlie4Change Nice meeting you!
@CHamiltoChem I don't think there's much disagreement here. The argument pretty much hinges on the 16 margin being all about Trump
@CHamiltoChem The argument I'm relaying - and again, not saying I agree with - is that the saturation coverage of GA6 created an environment that replicated the polarization of 16, and that if that happened in all districts, R's would get the better end of the deal.
@CHamiltoChem The argument is that R voters were motivated to turn out in GA-6 in ways they haven't been elsewhere, resulting in something that looks like a re-run of '16, instead of a big swing from the Trump/Clinton margin.
(And needless to say, I'll be at the board and ready to go for the first big burst of vote returns at 11pm EST...)
It's an election night (!), but a very unusual one.  For those who want to watch the action in AZ-8, here's what you can expect tonight: https://t.co/byNFYerTeG
@CHamiltoChem Sure. The argument though would be that if every district hewed to '16, R's would be OK.
Tomorrow AZ-8 will be the 8th House special election since Donald Trump became president. All but one have been in districts Trump carried in '16, and in four of them Dems have shaved 15+ points off his margin: https://t.co/eQHfGTVfYg

@xenocryptsite Yep. I've been trying to figure out why AZ 8 has been under the radar too. I think GOP nominee has something to do with it, but I also realize KS, MT (before assault incident) and SC all got limited coverage too.
@xenocryptsite I mean, couldn't just about all of the districts with House specials in the last year make some claim to the ancestral label? SC-5 obviously, MT has elected all sorts of Dems, KS-4 had Glickman for years, PA-18 of course, GA-6 in a state that was part of Dems' old solid south...
@JJBurns11 only 6??
@jbarro I mean, sure, but without looking I doubt we've seen a statewide R with a profile even remotely like this among Dem voters since Weld at his peak
Baker is up this year and if the national climate weren't working against R's (especially in MA), I'd be ready to bet that he breaks Bill Weld's 71% re-election number from 1994.
Crazy stat of the day: In MA-3, a solidly Democratic district in the Lowell area, Elizabeth Warren's approval rating among Dem primary voters is -- not surprisingly -- 81 percent. But Republican Gov. Charlie Baker's is...80 percent. With the same voters.		https://t.co/JxDW9IIBBx

The last time I can find a poll showing a TX Sen race this close at roughly this point was 02, when a May survey put Cornyn up 46-44 over Dem Ron Kirk		Cornyn went on to win by 12, but...the GOP president in 02 was a Texan w/ a mega-approval rating.

If it's the case that the divide has pretty much been locked in since '16, the enthusiasm difference becomes more significant: College+ whites now *more* interested in this year's midterms than non-college whites -- a reversal from this point in the last midterm cycle.
(@Nate_Cohn offers a compelling case here that this was the case with the '16 exits:  https://t.co/23Y37G5VVu)
And if you believe the exit polls missed when it came to college + whites, underestimating Clinton's support with them and overestimating their share of the electorate, then the stability of this divide extends back to the 2016 campaign....
The college/non-college divide among white voters varies from poll to poll, but overall it has been pretty stable throughout the Trump presidency: https://t.co/Vh3gexeIp9

Fwiw...the NBC/WSJ poll asks voters to rate 1-10 how interested they are in the Nov elections -- 10 is the most interested. 		Here's the % for each group that answered 9 or 10 vs. 1-8:		White/non-college: 52-36%	White/college+: 54-31% https://t.co/sIjnnxA82o

(Also, O'Neill was 74 when he retired, Carl Albert was 68 in '76, and John McCormack was 79 in '70. Ryan is 48.)
To put a finer point on this, Ryan would be first Speaker to announce retirement and serve through an election since Tip O'Neill in 1986. This is how it used be done. Key difference: House control was not in doubt in '86 (or previous Dem successions in '76 and '70). It is now.
Ryan says he's most proud of enacting the  "first major reform of our tax code in 36 years," skipping over the 1986 reform and going back to the '81 Reagan cuts.

In Michel's case, he could hear Newt Gingrich's footsteps and chose to get out of the way rather than face a potential challenge.
@pbump Boehner resigning in 15, but I'm guessing there's not much appetite for a pre-election leadership fight among R's right now given everything else they're dealing with
If Ryan serves through November, he'll be the first sitting party leader in the House not to seek reelection to his own seat since Bob Michel in 1994
@noahpransky If Clinton were president, I'd make him the favorite, but running with an R president with low approval is historically a high hurdle. But we'll see. Totally open to revisiting.
@CHeathWFTV At least 50-50 seems a little generous for me at this point, given the role incumbency and presidential approval almost always play in these. But as I said, I don't write Scott off at all and will watch closely.
@ShaneGoldmacher Yep - not many today who'd be insulated from from national polarization like Hollings, Conrad etc
I'll be watching FL closely and am open to possibilities, but my sense now is that Nelson may be the poster child for '18 Dems whose political fortunes turned on the Trump/Clinton result
Compare that 21-3 record to this scenario:	- incumbent senator	- running in a midterm	- in a state the other party's WH candidate won...	- ...BUT the actual president is from the senator's party		Incumbent senators in this position are only 10-7 since '94: https://t.co/c9LC6fXHlv
@jim79154 It is unusual for incumbents to lose under any conditions, but they are much more vulnerable when there is an unpopular president from their own party
@hashallthehash That was actually in 2000, when Mel Carnahan died just before the election. Carnahan was then appointed after he posthumously won the election over Ashcroft.
Rick Scott's own electoral history seems relevant here too: His two wins were squeakers where he got less than 50%, both in years ('10 and '14) when there was Dem president with a low approval.
Florida's Bill Nelson is:	* an incumbent 	* running in a midterm 	* in a state a president from the other party won 		Since '94, incumbents in this position are 21-3 -- and the only losses came when the president's approval was significantly higher than Trump's is now: https://t.co/ENp5QRZeLJ

@johnlk1980 @xenocryptsite Post-primary estimates had Jackson winning between 78 and 85 percent of the black vote nationally
@riceid This was his one moment of glory between about 1982 and 2006 -- had just won a shocking upset in CT setting up a 2-week NY campaign that became a referendum on whether Dems would seek a new, non-Clinton candidate.
@jpodhoretz I mean, given what Brown had been saying about Clinton until that point, it was a pretty stark shift!
Donahue had long been proposing moderator-less debates, but when he handed it over to Clinton and Brown, they spoke in platitudes and didn't challenge each other. "The whole great experiment crashed before viewers' eyes," Donahue told me years later.

@RB_0007 I did?
@ForecasterEnten @xenocryptsite (For whatever it's worth, I think the additional changes jackson got post-88 targeted a dozen states that had still used direct delegate election and a bonus system at the district level.)
@ForecasterEnten @xenocryptsite Oh I don't disagree with that. I was just saying it had been done before, albeit a generation ago.
@ForecasterEnten @xenocryptsite Yeah I don't think it's exactly the same as now either, but there were big changes after 84
@ForecasterEnten @xenocryptsite Jackson's overall primary vote share didn't even double between 84 and 88, but his delegate haul tripled
@ForecasterEnten @xenocryptsite That was changed for 88 though because of a the issue with Jackson in 84
@xenocryptsite The demographics of the party have changed obviously, but Mondale and Dukakis both won with scant black support by having an opponent (jackson) who monopolized the black vote without making sufficient inroads elsewhere
@MelW16628227 Thanks. It was not generally being received in that spirit though and I don't think there's any point in perpetuating that kind of disconnect.
I'm going to delete that poll tweet. Fwiw, I had many reactions to it, but my original choice to share was because (a) the fact of its existence says much about this moment, and (b) the results were one of the most extreme illustrations I've seen of polarization/tribalism.
@arnonmishkin @jpodhoretz for instance, Kennedy led in the final pre-siege NH poll 59-19%, lost primary 47-37%. Iran elevated Carter (temporarily) and allowed him to shun campaigning because of the crisis.
@jpodhoretz Absent Iran and rally-around-the-flag effect, the question to me is more if he beats Reagan in the general. Would have been a heck of a race.
@jpodhoretz Clearly impacted his WH chances. Although often forgotten that he was running well ahead of Carter until the late '79 embassy siege.

Precinct by precinct look at Dan Lipinski's somewhat surprising (to me anyway) win in the IL-3 Dem primary https://t.co/W3tLKT4mYh
@AlexClearfield @CrassPolitical @jmartNYT From what I can tell, his legislative record doesn't meet the standard of anti-abortion groups. His Nat'l Right to Life rating is 12%
Interesting to see if Lipinski reacts to this with some kind of course correction to head off a '20 primary challenge, or if it's just damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.
@POLITICO_Steve @Bencjacobs @pbump @ForecasterEnten Can I join this chain with Bob Dornan in 1996?
@JohnathanPowell She defines herself as a supporter of Row who favors some restrictions. Probably not what NARAL is looking for, but also not what Democrats for Life really wants either.
If Lipinski does indeed hang on, there will remain three anti-abortion Democrats in the House (out of 193). The other two are Henry Cuellar (TX) and Collin Peterson (MN).
I will admit that with a gun to my head I would have predicted a Newman win in IL-3. The Lipinski family's roots look like they were just deep enough and the machine vestiges just strong enough to carry him.
There are now more precincts left in Chicago than in the burbs and Lipinski is still leading by 1,288 votes (1.5%).
A few more Chicago precincts come in and Lipinski pushes it up to 1,552. He's probably feeling pretty good right now.
Lipinski's lead is 1,409 votes (1.8%). There are 31 Chicago precincts left and 37 in the Cook burbs.
8 more precincts just came in in suburban Cook -- they only brought Lipinski's lead down by 27 votes, to 1,328. Not what Newman needs.
The good news for Newman: She's got Lipinski's lead down to 1,355 (1.7 points)		The bad news: She did it by using up just about every precinct left in Will County. 		Still 34 left in Chicago and 45 in suburban Cook.
*leads by 2.5% not 3.5%
79% of IL-3 precincts in and Lipinski leads by 1,826 votes (3.5%). The rest of Chicago and Will/DuPage should cancel each other out. Newman would need more than she's been getting in the Cook burbs to overtake him then.
@CrassPolitical @jmartNYT Yes Lynch switched in 13 and is no longer considered pro-life by Dems for Life
Lipinski is up 2,637 votes (~4 points) with about twice as many suburban precincts than Chicago precincts left. But so far Newman is only leading in suburban Cook by a couple points.
IL-3 with 2/3 of Chicago and a little over half of the Cook suburbs:		Lipinski 27,108 (53%)	Newman 24,212 (47%)
IL-3, with nearly half of Chicago portion in and about 1/3 of suburban Cook:		Lipinski 18,674 (54%)	Newman 16,003 (46%)
Lipinski up 20 points with 15% of the Chicago portion of IL-3. This is where he'll do best - makes up about 1/3 of district
A couple of precincts from the suburban part of Cook County in (about 1,000 votes total) with Lipinski up 54-46% there
Results coming in from the Will County slice of IL-3:	Marie Newman 692 (59%)	Dan Lipinski 476 (41%)
The last Illinois governor to be defeated in a primary was Dan Walker, who lost to Michael Howlett in the 1976 Democratic primary
@richardmskinner Crowley even got his seat the same way Lipinski did -- post-primary resignation, anointed by mentor
@nedflinders yes
@JMilesColeman @mcimaps fantastic!
The print is small, but here's a glimpse into the world Lipinski comes from -- after the '84 Reagan landslide when nat'l Dems asked his father, Bill Lipinski, to lead outreach to "white ethnics": https://t.co/M0sIkOQflx
I'm totally fascinated by the IL-3 race. Lipinski represents a type of Dem -- urban/machine/Catholic/culturally conservative -- that was once dominant but now is nearing extinction.

On paper, Miss. (Trump +18 in '16) is more winnable for Dems than Alabama (Trump +28).  Demographically, MS is 37% black while AL is 26%. But both states are *extremely* polarized along racial lines: https://t.co/4bf0Os9A02
When Bob Dole resigned during the '96 campaign, both MS senators, Thad Cochran and Trent Lott, vied to replace him as Senate majority leader. Lott won 44-8: https://t.co/AG6dMdZmHT
Yes! Key omission - over Ronnie Musgrove https://t.co/lZhA69CpeI
The last Dem win there, '82, was John Stennis, who defeated Republican Haley Barbour. The '88 race was for Stennis's open and was won by Trent Lott.
Mississippi Senate elections since Cochran's 1978 victory:		’14 R+20	’12 R+17	’08 R+23	’06 R+29	’02 R+69*	’00 R+34	’96 R+44	’94 R+38	’90 R n/a	’88 R+8	’84 R+22	’82 D+28		(*No Democratic candidate; R opponent was from Reform Party)
Thad Cochran is resigning from a seat representing what is now one of the reddest states in the nation. But when he won it in 1978, it was the first victory for the Mississippi GOP in a statewide race in 97 years: https://t.co/y2HwoORSYF

The LIRR massacre in 12/93 added to the political pressure for Congress to enact laws. Today, of course, the overall crime rate is low and the political pressure comes from mass shootings.
The impetus for the gun control push back then was a high violent crime rate. In a spring '94 poll, Americans ranked crime the #1 issue facing the country, ahead of healthcare, unemployment, the economy and foreign policy

@benpershing Yep. And yet Torricelli spent the last two years telling Dems he'd be just the guy to save them from the Menendez mess...
@benpershing On the other hand, Menendez was actually charged with crimes, and despite the hung jury admitted to actions that look at least as bad as Torch's. What really sank Torch was the release of the prosecutor's memo in late September....
The problems for R's:	1) NJ is a blue state and politics even more polarized/tribalized now than in '02	2) If Menendez's numbers collapse like Torch's did, Dems can always pull another last-minute switch

Which is why I keep wondering: Who is the Dem that will stand out uniquely in the Trump-era, in a way he/she wouldn't otherwise? Is there one? Is there more than one?
And, obviously, it was the Watergate climate that powered Jimmy Carter's candidacy. Against a different backdrop, possible no one gives a second look to a peanut farmer promising "I will never tell a lie."
...and '76 is a good parallel to keep in mind: Watergate created an atmosphere that encouraged potential Dem candidates to say "Why not me?" More than a dozen ultimately ran. Rise of Trump having similar effect.
Feels like we're going to see more early activity from a wider array of potential candidates than for any Democratic race at least since 1976 https://t.co/7uj4hyGBMn

@NoahCRothman He was in the ballgame until the Chang sentencing memo came out at the end of September. Then his numbers crashed (down 20 in Dem poll) and the party pulled the plug.
Also, the memory of 2002 -- when they waited until one month before the election to swap Torricelli out and still won easily -- probably means Dem leaders will feel no urgency to move on Menendez now
That said, NJ is a blue state, '18 is shaping up as a very good year for Dems, GOP lacks a strong candidate so far, and Dems have not lost an NJ Senate race since 1972.

Of all red states, Utah has the largest anti-Trump base within the GOP. Romney is also uniquely popular in the state. It would put him in a unique position among Senate R's: Free to criticize Trump with no fear of alienating his own voters.
Utah was also Trump's worst state in the GOP primaries/caucuses. Finished 3rd with 14%, behind Cruz (69%) and Kasich (17%).

@HotlineJosh I guess there's also a question of whether the Moore saga itself changes image of the GOP outside AL....
@JMilesColeman Right. Kind of like Shelby County. My question is how much of that is just because of Moore, vs. how much is broader Trump/GOP-related and transferable to other races.
It's the new post-’16 slippage in AL that I’m wondering about. How much of it is Moore-specific, and how much will translate to other states in ’18?
In AL, the story is suburbanites who had been willing to vote for Trump in ’16 turning against the GOP in ’17.
In VA, the story was the energy of suburbanites who had already moved against Trump in the ’16 campaign. They turned out in big numbers, but the overall results in ’17 were similar to ’16.
College-educated suburbanites were key to the Dem wins in VA and AL, but with a notable difference: https://t.co/0QoRPuFCKy

@QCwordlady Thanks!
Turnout as a share of last year's presidential vote seems to be higher in the heavily black counties than in rural white areas
100% in, Jones wins Lee (Auburn). Was 59-36% for Trump in '16 and 53-47% for Moore in '12.
100% reporting:		Limestone: 59-39% Moore (was 62-38% Moore in '12)	Franklin: 59-40% Moore (was 64-36% Moore)	Escambia: 61-37% Moore (was 57-43% Moore)
75% of the vote is in in Limestone:		2012: Moore 62-38%	2016: Trump 72-24%	2017: Moore 61-38%
Black share of Alabama electorate:	2004: 25%	2008: 29%	2012: 28%	2016: No exit	2017: 30%
Overall, Moore is up with white college grads 59-37%. JONES wanted this gap closer
White voters (AL exit)	White men w/ college degree 64-32% Moore	White men no college degree: 81-16% Moore		White women w/ college degree: 54-43% Moore	White women no college degree: 74-24% Moore
Based on exits, black turnout better than Dems hoped. But Jones not getting as many white crossovers as hoped for.
Vote by gender (AL exit)		Men: 57-40% Moore	Women: 57-42% Jones
Composition of electorate by age (AL exit)	18-29 13% (18% in 2012)	30-44 21% (27% in '12)	45-64 42% (41%)	65+ 24% (15%)
For comparison, in 2012, Obama lost white voters in Alabama 84-15%
By comparison, when Barack Obama ran in 2012, 28% of Alabama's electorate was black. In tonight's exit, the number is 30.
Vote by race (Alabama exit):		White	Moore 70%	Jones 27%		Black	Jones 95%	Moore 5%
Composition of electorate (Alabama exit)		White 65%	Black 30%	Latino/other 5%

Here's the story of each Senate appointee that *didn't* end up running since '92 https://t.co/DPtF5pKBp9
@JohnBerman @tkdylan Well now I'm blushing
@JohnBerman @tkdylan It's actually pretty simple: a governor choosing a wide open, competitive primary. It's a rare thing, and none of these exceptions are that, especially Barkley.
@WesMcBoston Please read the thread. Patrick's appointments came under an MA law designed for a three-month caretaker senator.
@BrianPJencunas No he was quote explicit he wanted a temporary gig: "It’s only a three-month period, I wouldn’t want to do anything more, but to be honest, it’s a little arrogant.”"
The MA law was passed in '09 at Kennedy's urging in his final days to make sure there was a 60th vote for OCare while the special played out: https://t.co/dOzm9NSD1h
@JoshuaMZeitz @TheToddSchulte as it was with LeMieux and Crist in FL
Lots of "What about MA?" comments. I don't count Cowan and Kirk as "pure" caretaker picks because they were appointed under a law that puts heavy political pressure on a Gov to make a caretaker pickk
@BrianPJencunas He lobbied for a temporary appointment
@JoshuaMZeitz @TheToddSchulte My definition here is governors who wanted open, competitive primaries. Teh Goodwin pick was made by a Gov who wanted a clear primary for himself.
@EsotericCD My definition is subjective, but Patrick was adhering to the spirit of the law. I don't think that's the same as opting for a placeholder
@BrianPJencunas Again, my definition is subjective, but the intent of the law in MA was clear
@PoliticoKevin Both under an MA law passed in '09 by Dems specifically designed for a caretaker appointment
@EsotericCD MA Dems changed law in 9'09 to specifically allow for a caretaker appointment -- i.e. a 60th vote for ObamaCare while the special played out
@nmwass Expectation when Kaufman was picked was that it would give Beau Biden a chance to run for the seat in '10
@BrianPJencunas Paul Kirk. And the law was created that year with the specific intent of the governor making a a caretaker pick.
@tkdylan That was for the final weeks of Wellstone's term. Vacancy was too late for Barkley to run
(Technically, Chris Christie's choice of Jeff Chiesa in '13 was a caretaker pick, but his goal was for his party *not* to seriously contest the Senate race and complicate his own reelection bid)

@matthewjdowd Sorry, but when a politician leaves potential wiggle room, I'll point it out. If you think that's a "game," then maybe it says something about you.
In Craig's case, his term was up the next year and he just served out his term and didn't run. Franken's seat isn't up till 2020.
It wouldn't be entirely without precedent: Larry Craig reneged on a resignation announcement in 2007: https://t.co/ocfQrs5lXu
I doubt it for many reasons, but the cynical read would be that "in the coming weeks" is Franken buying time to see if circumstances somehow change
Franken is not saying that his conduct should warrant resignation, only that that the investigation would distract him from his job.
In November 2003, Al Franken expressed interest for the first time in running for the Senate from MN in 2008: https://t.co/m3fOSy1koG
@CMassPolitics Different situation. MA law required interim appointment as special election played out.
The "caretaker" move comes with some risk. When I covered NJ, R's were *still* complaining that Gov. Tom Kean cost them a Senate seat in 1982 with this: https://t.co/saLfHtCnLU

If Bredesen wins in Tennessee next year, he'd become a 75-year-old freshman senator
...and if there are more cases and Dems continue enforcing this standard, the difference could be magnified
It seems possible that if Dems push out Franken while Rs look the other way on Moore voters may discern a meaningful difference between them
The key here is McConnell's claim that Franken has lost support "of his constituents." Sets him up to declare a distinction between Moore and Franken if Moore wins next week. https://t.co/6v4XhCu94r

Looking at these past MN results, one thing that strikes me is that for all of the talk (before now) about Franken as a WH prospect, Klobuchar has demonstrated far broader appeal
Recent MN Senate results: 		2014 D+10	2012 D+34	2008 D+0.01	2006 D+20	2002 R+2	2000 D+5	1996 D+9	1994 R+5	1990 D+3

@SunnyDfan4eva That's not the regular season people talk about being devalued. It creates a reward for winning those conferences, and all conferences.
@TedTaylorSPHR @CCrook16 Seems to work just fine in FCS...
@DannyHairstonJr @CCrook16 This is not hard to do. Works well for FCS, which has an even larger tourney.  Can also get rid of that stupid 12th regular season game.
@SunnyDfan4eva That would not happen if it's conference champs only.
@DannyHairstonJr 12 allows the top 4 to be rewarded with a bye
@SunnyDfan4eva Not if 10 of the 12 spots were for conference champs. It would *add* to the regular season's importance and create a clear standard.
The fairest standard: Win your conference and you're in the playoff. That's 10 teams. Then two more at-large spots. Best 4 teams get byes.
@_Drew_McCoy_ Sure, but the 13th team won't be a conference champ.
Hopefully this will hasten the expansion of the college playoff to 12 teams!
@EdAsante77 We will know in 20 seconds!
@EdAsante77 That's totally subjective. Blind resume test goes to Ohio state. Who's bama's best win? 4-loss Mississippi state?
@EdAsante77 Both are flawed. OSU has more quality wins and a conference title.
@MrMedved @jbarro He pleaded in 12/94 and was sentenced 6/95. Starr later indicted him two more times on different charges.
@CCrook16 *FCS!!
@CCrook16 Seems to work fine in FBS.
@ShellyPass That's not the comparison I'm making.
@CCrook16 It's really not many more, especially if you eliminate the 12th regular season game they added a few years ago
Ohio State should get in over Alabama. Also, it should be a 12-team playoff. All 10 conference champs (even the small ones!) + two at-large.
@JeremyStahl The parallel is that in each case the news set off *speculation* about what it would lead to. Your snark aside, we don't know the answer yet
Maybe a cautionary note worth keeping in mind. Flynn plea/cooperation *could* lead to more, but that's not how these things always go.

Clinton pushed supposed limits that hadn't been tested before. If Gary Hart had tried the same in '87/'88, he might have won the whole thing.

@jljacobson Well you made a very specific statement here that 20-week bans had failed in MS, SD and NM. That appears to be very inaccurate. Again, a ban did fail in NM, but it was only municipal.
@jljacobson So, again, sticking o the facts, I don't believe your statement is accurate about SD. Referendum 6 was a ban on any abortion except to save a woman's life. Initiative 11 would have also included a rape exception. Neither was a 20-week ban.
@jljacobson The conversation on-air was about 20-week bans and the politics of Alabama. Am I correct that the ballot measures you're citing were about "personhood" in MS and a near-total ban in SD.? And that NM was a municipal measure in Albuquerque?

Meaning: I watched her face a near-mutiny for moving against Bill Jefferson when the FBI found 90 grand in cash in his freezer
Covering Pelosi &amp; House Dems a decade ago taught me that tending to the politics within the caucus is often at odds w/ the broader politics

@DKElections Good cautionary note, although I remember some primary polls also had Strange worse than Moore. Bentley ties/appointment very  unpopular
@EdAsante77 This is a very interesting aspect, although I wonder how much is residual negativity toward Strange for Bentley ties/deeply unpopular nature of his appointment
In NJ in '02, Torricelli suddenly dropped out a month before the election when his numbers collapsed. Went from competitive to down 20 in own polls.
@matthewjdowd The one I just posted and am referring to here?
(*Shelby won as a Dem in '92 and switched to GOP in '94. Last Dem to win an AL Senate race and stay a Dem was Howell Heflin in 1990.)
I was deeply suspicious of the NRSC poll, but it looks like Moore's slippage is real and significant. Could be first Dem win in AL SEN since 1992*

@John_Holl @TODAYshow @SamuelAdamsBeer @DylanDreyerNBC @kwelkernbc Good info - thanks!
@JGGoodie @TODAYshow 15 minutes before air!
@EricSlusher Maybe that's why I wrote "something of a precedent" instead of "perfect parallel."
@theJoshBanks It involved changing the law
@theJoshBanks "Something of a precedent"
...but the move also stirred a backlash, with grassroots R's accusing the party leadership of rigging the game. This propelled Bret Schundler to an upset win over Franks in the primary. Then Schundler lost by 14 to Jim McGreevey in November.
...this achieved two things: (1) DiFrancesco was persuaded to leave the race; (2) the deadline for switching candidates -- which had passed -- was extended three weeks, allowing R's to sub in a new candidate (Bob Franks)
There is something of a precedent for this: When NJ Republicans wanted to push Don DiFrancesco out of the '01 Gov race when he was hit with scandal, they changed the law during the campaign to delay the primary 3 weeks: https://t.co/wq2Bjndwzl

@jpodhoretz And also I think on how intense coverage of this for the near-term future shapes public opinion. I could imagine more erosion even absent a new accusation.
Yep -- this might end up being the low point for Moore, but I wouldn't assume it is. https://t.co/DGTfRiUnKi
The last time an Alabama Senate race had a single-digit margin was 1996. Last time it was within 20 was 2002.
From the polls: 82% said they were aware of the new accusations against Moore; 35% said he should drop out. 54% said he shouldn't.
Overnight Opinion Savvy/DDHQ Alabama poll:		Jones (D) 46%	Moore (R) 46%		https://t.co/zIs74Ni9XU

@jrlentini This is where it gets into interpretation and becomes....controversial.
@jrlentini Yes, it is the same in that the deadline has passed and some ballots have already been mailed. The law as written in 2002: https://t.co/pdGT1JTWxC
@jrlentini I said the wording of the NJ statute (51 days to drop out, 48 to name replacement) was clear, as it is in Alabama. The interpretation of the court was and still is controversial. My only point was that a court might choose to interpret the AL statute similarly.
@marceelias @privadore My last one, too: Your belligerent tone doesn't change the fact that the decision by that court was -- and remains -- a matter of dispute among the political and legal class in NJ. It is still talked about and debated today.
Very excited for this next Friday 11/17. If you're in the Lowell area, come on over! https://t.co/jjDqZJtjIU
@privadore @marceelias for instance: https://t.co/G1tthENxd4
@privadore @marceelias They declined to hear the case
@marceelias Right, that means it wasn't controversial and there weren't legal scholars who vehemently disagreed.
One question if if any Dems sense weakness/opportunity and go after him in primary (and if that would then entice others). Believe it or not, the most active potential candidate has been....Bob Torricelli.
NJ's blue/anti-Trump tilt, plus weak GOP bench, could well be enough for Menendez in the general.
IN NJ exit poll this week, Menendez's fav/unfav was 35-53%. Booker, by comparison, was 59-33%. When Torch dropped out in '02, his job approval was 31-47%.
Time to start considering NJ landscape if Menendez is acquitted and runs again in '18... https://t.co/KdeX16LQAH
@MassageMedium IN NJ, state Dem party was ordered to pay for new ballots (about $800,000) and state was ordered to prioritize re-mailing to military personnel.
@davesund Actually, the laws are very similar. The question is whether the AL court would offer the same interpretation as NJ's -- that voter choice is paramount
10/02 poll: Majority of NJ voters call Torricelli-Lautenberg post-deadline ballot switch unfair. Lautenberg still open up 9-point lead.  https://t.co/Ao78rbylOV
Interesting! Also: Are excused jurors supposed to talk publicly like this while deliberations are still going on? https://t.co/v1s7lg5ple
Again, the wild card is if R's could get Moore to drop out and get a court ruling allowing a ballot switch despite the statute. This is *exactly* what NJ Dems did in 2002 and it worked for them. https://t.co/d12rroxbCt
@hughhewitt I think this only applies to his name appearing on the ballot -- not write-in votes?
Call it the Access Hollywood precedent... https://t.co/FLDvYWeaHV
@joshuasomething If he refuses to withdraw, he'd have plenty of leverage. If he said he'd drop out for Mo Brooks and not Strange, could see GOP taking the deal, as much as McConnell hates Brooks
@NJpoliticsprof @PollsterPatrick I've been riveted by every move he's made. What a character.
I'm wondering if Moore might play ball with them if R's promise not to run Strange? Is there a substitute candidate he could live with?
@fenwaysteve Maybe. But does he wait 11 years in Newark?
(Also, think how it plays out if Frank Pallone doesn't say no when Dems offer him Torch's spot. He'd still be there - no opening for Booker)
The question is what leverage do R's have to get Moore out? Torch in '02 was 51 and an establishment figure -- had to think of his future. Moore is 70 and a political loner. https://t.co/9a4svf4m1K
@jmaxmann Again, Alabama could make the same decision.
@jmaxmann NJ law was very clear. The statute said a party has until 51 days pre-election to swap candidates. State Supreme Court interpreted differently. Why couldn't the same happen in Bama?
@PollsterPatrick Right -- it was the prosecutor's memo ("credible in most material ways") and epic WNBC Chang interview, both at the end of September, that triggered the freefall and exit.
This is the ad NJ R's ran in '02 after the post-deadline Lautenberg/Torricelli switch:  https://t.co/X7ARJfWNoB
@PollsterPatrick Let's see if the polling shifts in Bama and how Moore and R's react. Torch also faced the prospect of being shunned if he came back to NJ and tried to make a living after taking the party down in an election. An incentive that won't apply to Moore.
@marceelias I covered the story. It was not at all clear-cut that Dems should be allowed to switch after the statutory deadline.
@POLITICO_Steve Right -- SCOTUS refused to intervene
@marceelias What do you mean? NJ law was *clear* that it was too late to switch. Dems then got the state Supreme Court to rule for a switch anyway, and the US Supreme Court refused to block it.
Remember: The statutory deadline for replacing a Senate candidate had passed in 2002 and Dems *still* managed to get Lautenberg on the ballot for Torricelli: https://t.co/t4oJjo2lvQ
This was true in NJ in 2002 as well, but Dems went to court and got Lautenberg on the ballot in place of Torricelli anyway. https://t.co/62eEBREie7
So can Alabama Republicans do what NJ Dems did a month before the '02 election? Will they want to? https://t.co/GWtuvu0obu
...and worth remembering that Dems weren't able to flip GA-6 this spring -- a suburban district that Trump carried by just a point.
This is why I said VA should terrify any R running in a Clinton district in '18. But R's are only defending 23 of them. Dems need a net-gain of 24 to get the House -- meaning they'll need to flip at least some Trump districts. https://t.co/3o8my5aYH6

Virginia should terrify any R running next year in a Clinton district. But Dems will need more than that.

@JoanieGentian @lilithinzion @NoctilucentClou I guess you haven't heard of Bruce Wetherbee!
With more than 80% in, Dem Justin Fairfax leads LG race in VA by 54k (3%). Best news for him: Still significant vote out in Fairfax Co, Norfolk, Newport News and Richmond.
Whether Gillespie's campaign caused it or lingering anti-Trump sentiment was enough by itself...Gillespie is not rolling back any of the big Dem margins in NoVa from last November.
Manassas in NoVa was a two-point loss for Gillespie in '14. Jumped to a 16-point Trump loss last year.  Tonight Gillespie losing by 14.
Again, Gillespie not getting what he wanted here
Chesterfield outside Richmond is almost all in. Was R+8 in '13, R+9 in '14, R+2 last year. Tonight: R+0.9
Gillespie's goal was not to get blown out in NoVa as badly as Trump and to try to run closer to his own '14 level. In Loudoun, he's failed completely.
99% of Loudoun in NoVa is in. Gillespie won it by a hair in 2014. Clinton won it by 17 last year. Tonight, Northam is winning it by 18.
@NotTiff_Tiffany The reason so much attention is paid to this split is because there's a giant difference between the two groups, and it's exploded even more in the Trump era. The college/non-college split with nonwhite voters is negligible.
Tiny Norton in SW Virginia gives Gillespie 65%. Trump got 70% there last year and Gillespie got 70% in '14.

I was being too flip here. Just feels there's been a lot of buzz about a Gillespie win relative to what the polls are showing.
@matthewjdowd Subjective but I feel like I've heard a lot of it in the last 2-3 days
Polls mostly showing small Northam lead. Pundits mostly talking of Gillespie win. We'll see which one gives.

The reason margin matters is for downballot contests. Dems hoping for a Murphy win that exceeds their best recent Gov margin (14 in '01)
...but there's some concern the "sanctuary state" attack on Murphy may have gotten some traction and margin may be lower than they'd hoped.
A note on NJ: I've been hearing late apprehension from Dems about the margin. Murphy is still ahead and they're not afraid he'll lose...

Reminds me a little of CT in '10. Dodd's retirement was initially treated as a blow to Dems but in reality it ended up saving the seat.

@justneanie Thanks!
Flake had the worst general election standing of any Republican up in '18 https://t.co/MHipNclihb
The problem for him was that the things he'd need to do to win a GOP primary would probably have worsened his general election plight
Flake was in a seemingly impossible political bind. Deep trouble in GOP primary but also underwater w/ *all* voters  https://t.co/e4QambdUBR
...if she does run, it could *hurt* Republicans' ability to hold the House, since it would put her swing district seat at risk.
Jeff Flake's decision not to run could *help* R's hold the seat if Martha McSally now runs and can win nomination. But...

Besides her strong numbers w/ Dems now, big challenge for liberals who want to oust Feinstein is CA's jungle primary system

@Taniel Yes although their final pre-primary poll was dead on.
...but that was for state office. Key question is whether nationalization of this race brings back some of the R's who bolted on him in '12.
Moore did struggle in his last general election race, for Chief Justice in '12. He won by just 4 points --  even as Romney won AL by 23.
This poll was taken immediately after the runoff. An Emerson poll just before the runoff put Moore up 52-30% on Jones.

@EricColumbus As I wrote earlier, I suspect that dynamic cuts differently here. But I'm open to be being wrong.
@EricColumbus I think turnout can vary considerably in these things. The MA '10 special Senate election had 2x the turnout as the MA '13 special.
But do revved up nat'l Dems making AL a priority just prevent Jones from sneaking up in the general -- like the D did in SC-5? https://t.co/EoUncfbJzK
@jpodhoretz Right. #resist probably doesn't sell in Huntsville..
There are *a lot* of reasons to think MA '10 isn't a great parallel for AL '17, but it did teach me never to say never in these things.

Nationally, we're focused on Trump's role and Moore as a lightning rod, but the circumstances of Strange's appointment are a big deal in AL
Obviously, they both look like they'd beat Doug Jones, but I think this speaks to Strange's problems within Alabama, related to Bentley
With Trump arguing Roy Moore risks losing AL Sen seat to Dems, new Emerson poll suggests he may be *more* electable than Luther Strange https://t.co/H6L8NLDXyz
@_Drew_McCoy_ It's such an unusual dynamic, I don't have a good guess. If Trump was backing Moore, this would be the thing that makes it a 30-point race

@xenocryptsite Biden was pretty much at Hillary's announcement day level just before he announced he wouldn't run. Then it went up.
@xenocryptsite I bet that graph looks very similar with a Kerry '16 campaign. Precisely how similar, who knows.
@xenocryptsite I don't claim to know. But 15 months of Trump talking about "Joe the plagiarist" or reviving Kerry swift boat stuff...
@xenocryptsite Would that drop happen to any Dem running vs Trump in the reality show environment of 16?
@xenocryptsite Yes. This is largely unrelated to my thread here but gets to what I think is the real question of 16.

@SonnyBunch @vjmfilms Not saying it's all equal, but they were not spared like she suggests. She's also been centerstage for 25 years. That's unique from them.
And if Hillary doesn't run, her numbers return to Sec of State levels and Dems lament that they let a winner sit on the sidelines.
If Biden/Kerry run in '16, their numbers fall. If they lose, everyone talks about how polarizing they were and what bad candidates they were
...and how they plummeted when she returned to day to day political combat. But those artificially high numbers powered Ready for Hillary.
Hillary knows how this goes. Look at how her numbers suddenly rocketed up when she lost to Obama in '08 and became Sec of State https://t.co/9dWQOlPPOW
Biden is similar. His numbers as VP weren’t good -- something that helped Ready for Hillary --  *until* he decided not to run in ‘16 https://t.co/adZCdKkLXi
Kerry only attained the standing Clinton describes when he was no longer a threat to run and when he became Sec of State.
Kerry emerged from 04 badly damaged. When he wanted to run in '08, worried Dems used a "botched joke" to send him the message to get lost https://t.co/8HVfQTDqMr
The Iraq voted wrecked Kerry '04. Gave rise to Dean, who nearly took him out, then "He was for it before he was against it!" was W's theme
It may be how they’re treated now, but life was very different for them when they were in the arena day to day
I think it's hard to argue Biden and (especially) Kerry escaped the kind of blowback Clinton is talking about here... https://t.co/LUv0ZplKqq

@CHueyBurns That's a better way of putting it
It’s been tested in a way we haven’t seen before. He’s the anti-them and something about that appeals deeply to GOP voters
…then he won in November w/ ~90% GOP support even after Ryan told members he was poison they could walk away from.
Trump won the GOP nomination with basically none of them supporting him, and many of them pushing vehemently against him…

@jbarro @TedNesi Interesting question
Between the mid-70s and mid-90s, the % of religiously unaffiliated Americans barely moved - from 7% to 9%. Since then it's exploded to 24%: https://t.co/gO4eisKjei
The most Democratic religious group is black Protestants (68% ID as Dem). The least Democratic is Mormons (12%).
The most Republican religious group is white evangelical Protestants (49% ID as R's). The least Republican is Unitarians (3%).
All sorts of fascinating/surprising/mind-blowing numbers in this new PRRI report on religious identity in America  https://t.co/Xi21BSTnaP
In that same time, the share of religiously unaffiliated Dems has jumped from 9% to 26%. Among Dems under 30, 40% are now unaffiliated.
In 2006, nearly half (49%) of Dems were white evangelicals/Mainline Protestants/Catholics. Just a decade later, it’s down to 29% https://t.co/QiYBX7WcKe

And one more: Among those angling to replace Menendez: Bob Torricelli, who was driven out of the Senate 15 years ago after an ethics rebuke.
Also ironic that Menendez launched his political career after serving as a key prosecution witness in his mentor's federal corruption trial: https://t.co/U78n1E7LY4
Bob Menendez today becomes the first senator in 36 years to face a bribery trial. The last one, Harrison Williams, held the same Senate seat https://t.co/jjZxupWOyT

@jpodhoretz @nytimes No question that's a big part of this story too...
@jpodhoretz @nytimes But there's indirect too: By the early '90s it's grist for Buchanan et al, who use it for years to come to push their broader crusade
@jpodhoretz @nytimes I think it's hard to measure. There's the direct impact: Senators like Grassley who were still there 20 years later and felt haunted...
...and from the '07 uprising to the rebellion against the post-'12 GOP autopsy, which provided fuel for Trump's rise.
You can draw a straight line from the '86 Reagan law to the GOP revolt that sunk George W. Bush's effort in 2007  https://t.co/VKA9P9RDgW
…which, as it became apparent in the ‘90s and ‘00s, helped push the already skeptical GOP into the “never again!” posture we see today.
Anyway, the law did bring many out of the shadows, but was largely considered a failure on the enforcement side…	https://t.co/4ZNyv908xz
There was Dem opposition too. 161 House Ds voted Yes. 80 were No. (Worth noting Dem caucus had more southerners and more conservatives then)
But important to remember that even w/ Reagan pushing it, there was strong GOP opposition. 77 House R’s voted yes. 93 were Nos. https://t.co/byj1Rx1sL3

@varadmehta @daveweigel @sethdmichaels ...does that make it inevitable that 6-8% of the electorate will seek out a NOTA option?
@varadmehta @daveweigel @sethdmichaels Ha. I've been thinking about it for a while. He drags opponent/opponent's media/culture allies into a 24/7 reality show insult-fest...
@varadmehta @daveweigel @sethdmichaels Also, are "spoiler" third party candidates  natural byproduct of the Trump-era environment?
@xenocryptsite @sethdmichaels @varadmehta Possible! As I wrote, *lots* to point to to argue this will go the way you'd expect w/ a president in the 30s in approval.
@sethdmichaels @xenocryptsite @varadmehta My question though is what happens if/when a race like that gets "nationalized" like GA-6
@sethdmichaels @varadmehta ...because I don't know. And I think that's a good place for everyone to be now. We don't really know, but we're going to learn more.
@sethdmichaels @varadmehta Yep. My point here honestly is to raise a possibility I don't feel is considered enough, not to argue it will actually happen.
@sethdmichaels @varadmehta That's why I say open to interpretation. But maybe in Trump era 16 result is more relevant than past form.
@sethdmichaels @varadmehta Very open to interpretation, but every other special saw significant movement from the 11/16 result. GA-6 didn't.
@varadmehta Yep, this exactly what I'm asking. And emphasis on asking. I don't know the answer.
In for Hardball starting...now

@POLITICO_Steve Yep, I think it was the best 30 for 30
@POLITICO_Steve Still love that they had him behind the bench for the title game last year
@chrislhayes Right, but that's always a variable. I think this is something newer, and the question is how much weight does it carry,
Yep. This was the basis for "Ready for Hillary." Dems knew her numbers were artificially high, but no one believed they'd fall so low. https://t.co/FmYlBQ4alc
@_Drew_McCoy_ well said
@Sharpe222 But is he? We are trained to say that's what's happening, but I'm not sure if the relationships we're used to assuming necessarily apply.
…and he gets the effects of negative partisanship. I’m not sure Biden-Trump doesn’t end with Dems saying: If only we’d nominated Hillary!
But as a candidate, he gets every blemish put back under the microscope, he gets Trump calling him “Lying Joe” (or whatever) everyday..
Remember, his numbers before he declined to run weren’t that good. He gained a lot of affection being the guy who *didn’t* run. https://t.co/K29ver6nBJ
But do we really know what the Biden who gets in the race looks like after a year as a candidate in this reality show environment?
After all, his numbers were great by the end of ’16: Favorables around 60% . Plus the whole Scranton/Rust Belt thing -70k votes in 3 states!
A fun thought exercise is to imagine Biden as the Dem nominee instead of Hillary. Everyone’s instinct is to say: Of course he’d have won!
@chrislhayes Same. I think it's *the* question for understanding '16 and now, and I don't think we have the answer.
That her high negatives are a reflection of new realities of polarization/negative partisanship and what running vs. Trump will do to anyone
...it also seems possible to me that those two things are more interrelated than we appreciate…
This is why while it’s very possible that Trump won with such high negatives only because Hillary herself was so unpopular...

@HotlineJosh But like I'm saying: I have more questions than answers. But I'm convinced this is an area that needs a lot more focus
@HotlineJosh I also wonder if there's some who aren't that explicit - the pushback vs. Trump motivates them but they cite some generic factor if asked
@bac4077 Yes, I think this president is the central character in our culture in a way we haven't seen

@SmikeCarl @MSNBC This was the exit poll of people who just voted
@richardmskinner But I think Trump's culture war politics may be more seductive, especially w/ like 25 Dems candidates simultaneously jockeyting to oust him
@richardmskinner A version of Carter's anti-Wallace message in '76 -- "This time, don't send them a message. Send them a president"...
@richardmskinner Yeah, like '16 again -- looks tantalizingly vulnerable to other R's but the combination is more elusive than they thought
@richardmskinner Soft intraparty support could just be a near-permanent condition with him. Different appeal/goals/relationship w/ party than Bush et al
It may just be that the chunk of his own party that's faithful to Trump is smaller than w/ past presidents but also much more devoted.
The nature of his appeal and his relationship to his party is just too different to make meaningful comparisons to Obama/Bush/Clinton etc.
It looks bad compared to other modern presidents but it's also probably about where Trump should be.

@JohnnyFlynn75 Just curious: What was I doing yesterday when I tweeted his lowest-ever Gallup approval number?
Dem vote share in AL Senate races		1986: 50%	1990 61%	1992 64%	1996 46%	1998 37%	2002 40%	2004 32%	2008 37%	2010 35%	2014  --	2016 36%
The final Dem win in an AL Senate race comes with an asterisk -- Richard Shelby in 1992. Two years later, he switched to the GOP.
The one GOP victory pre-'96 was a squeaker -- Jeremiah Denton, who won in 1980 but was defeated for reelection in 1986. https://t.co/qwWXVzgraG
From the end of Reconstruction until 1996, one Republican won a Senate election in Alabama. Since '96, no Republican has lost one.
And Gallup's daily average has him at 36% after hitting a new low of 34% yesterday   https://t.co/RPRKkMlk4S

@virgiltexas Not in Gallup, but yes she was getting close. That's what I'm getting at -- as they become candidates, scrutiny/perceptions shift
It can be tough to tell which candidates will hold up well and which won't, and why. I remember when Kerry was supposed to be a great bet.
Now it's taken as an article of faith that he would have beaten Trump. Who knows what a campaign vs. Trump would have done to his image?
Biden's a good example of the flip side. By *not* running, he didn't face the same scrutiny/attacks/ridicule and his numbers improved.
She was coming down from artificially high levels as Sec of State, but Dems expected that. They didn't expect it would fall like it did.
Remember that she didn't start out with such toxic numbers. In '14 she looked stronger than Biden, who was actually underwater: https://t.co/pcO0pL2gKj

This poll alone won't do it. But I think it's the kind that can if there are more like it.
…they need to feel that attitudes in their own party are changing in a way they haven’t seen before, that it’s not just more of the same.
…which has the effect of paralyzing them when it comes to dealing with him. That’s been the dynamic so far. To change it...
Basically: Because of ’16, they assume: (a) Trump poll numbers are going to be awful; and (b) their own base is actually still with him...
I think this is the type of poll that could resonate with GOP leaders/elected in a way the parade of low approval rating polls don’t...

@RetroNewsNow Pretty sure the Six Million Dollar Man is leading this poll only because it's the episode that Mr. Pitt from Seinfeld was in
@NickFalacci Isn't there some famous line about critics being our friends for showing our faults? Anyway, happy to engage. More importantly: Where in MA?
We may actually agree. I'm not sure we have the right numbers to understand the effect Trump has on the electorate. I won't claim I do. https://t.co/E9IFKSUjYt
@aedwardslevy I think about this a lot. My guess is 44.
This is the point of reference for GOP electeds: They saw these numbers all campaign, then he won and got 88% of Republican votes.
Along these lines, bunch of new polls out showing Trump approval &lt;40%, other dire numbers. But...here's what it looked like 1 year ago today https://t.co/i5wxsfC6LS
Crimes and Misdemeanors is one of those movies I've thought back to a lot over the years, and his performance is a big reason why. RIP https://t.co/pO5P6Et5x1
@jacobsoboroff Sharks in the water. Mountain lions in the hills. Heat in the air. I'm a simple New Englander. Too much for me!
@jacobsoboroff No offense to your fine city, but I don't handle the heat well. It will be a miracle if I even make it through that weekend..
@DavidKempski I don't know, that pretty close!
@MarcBodnick Thank you for reading it!
@POLITICO_Steve I feel self-conscious doing it and try to make up for it by rarely tweeting otherwise...
@cesinnyc @AdamNoboa @MargaretMenefee The plans I had!
@WarEagle9775 Yep, I do feel that way a lot. But I've learned a *ton* reading @Chris_arnade, who I think has figured out how to do it.
Anyway, have a good weekend!
@AdamNoboa @MargaretMenefee MY DREAM IS SHATTERED
…with Nixon or anyone else. It wasn’t a non-factor, but this is uniquely powerful because of Trump’s style and how he won in the first place
….when it counted most last year is having a *huge* impact on our politics now. I just don’t think this same dynamic was at work….
…the lady with the MAGA tattoo, the guy who paints “Lock her up!” on his barn. But the willingness of all types of Rs to rally around Trump…
That’s why I think the focus on Trump voters is relevant. Yes, it can miss the mark, and it often settles on easy, obvious subjects…
...and so they hold back, terrified that maybe he has a bond with their own voters that they don’t even understand.
….“How many times have I seen this before? The scandal he can’t survive?  How many times was I wrong before?”
…the panic and defections would be massive. But with Trump, when it comes to R’s in Congress, their point of reference is...the campaign.
…and it paralyzes them in moments like now. An email that blows up all denials of contact with Russians?!? With any other president, well….
…then he wins both and they think: Holy cow – this guy gets my own base better than I do. I had *no* idea they’d go for this kind of thing…
Think about the psychology of GOP members of Congress: Don’t like him, didn’t endorse him, assumed he’d lose the primary, then the general.
To me, that’s the crucial part. It’s created a dynamic now that we haven’t had before, that insulates him in ways his predecessors weren't.
…and yet, of course, he won. By the slimmest possible margin, but still. And there ended up being no slack in his support from R’s.
…that only 35% of voters had a favorable view of him? It looked like the worst campaign ever, poised to lose a high number of GOP voters…
…or at least it looked that way. The fall polls that showed he was getting a low % of the GOP vote? How he could barely break 40% overall?
…things that led everyone – fellow R's, even (privately) his own campaign – to declare him dead. And there were numbers to back it up, too…
Think of it this way. He endured, what, a dozen meltdown-level scandals during the campaign? I mean, stuff that we’ve never seen before…
First, I get it. They can be ham-handed and not that useful. But there's reason to think about this all differently when it comes to Trump…
I see a lot of exasperation with “Trump voters don’t care” stories like this and want to say something about it..		https://t.co/Gq2fqbMz7V

@JJBurns11 Costing me a very important business lunch at TGI Friday's in Framingham!
@stuhetson I'd probably forget!

@ethanfletcher Yes, although Republican Cahill '69 to Democrat Byrne '73 wasn't far off -- 57 points
Suggestion to Dems getting excited about this: Start reading up on George Norcross. https://t.co/M2ZWIMG2RX
On top of everything else, gravity favors Murphy: Last time NJ voted for the gubernatorial candidate of the White House Party: Kean in 1985

@HashtagGriswold I can understand that. To a lot of people, it's not as simple as "Is education a good thing?"
