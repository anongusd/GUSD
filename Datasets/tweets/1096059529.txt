My full statement supporting @POTUS' announcement on the #IranDeal: https://t.co/kH8R9eWGfD
(5) Withdrawing from this deal creates an opportunity to move forward and pursue a solution to provide true security to the United States, our allies, the Middle East and the world. Iran knows what must be done. Until then, they will have to deal with the reality of sanctions.
(4) reducing American security, threatening the survival of Israel, and allowing state-sponsored terror to flourish in the region.
(3) The Iran Deal violated every red line that was drawn, from complete access to Iran's facilities and scientists to a robust inspection and verification regime. It also provided Iran with billions of dollars it has used to fuel terrorism and instability...
(2) I believe that action will result in a safer world and a safer America. From the start, President Obama and Secretary Kerry told Congress there would be clear red lines for any deal with Iran.
(1) Instead of stopping Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, the #IranDeal simply gave the regime a direct path to obtaining a nuclear weapon but at a slower pace. That was not acceptable. I support @POTUS' decision to withdraw from the #IranDeal.

On #Senatefloor: "Director Pompeo is more than qualified to serve as #SecretaryofState, in fact, at this point because of his service at the CIA, Director Pompeo is uniquely positioned to be a very successful Secretary of State."
...Having worked with several CIA directors over the years on the Intelligence Committee, I can personally attest that Director Pompeo is at the top of the class for being open and straightforward."
On #Senate floor: "As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I have worked with Director Pompeo regularly and can personally vouch for his accessibility and candor....
He not only defended core U.S. interests, but also moved the U.S. and North Korea closer to negotiations.  A maximum pressure campaign combined with a willingness to talk is working right now.
Director Pompeo‚Äôs recent trip to North Korea, I believe, highlights how effective and committed he is to pursuing diplomatic opportunities.
On #Senate floor: "By now we have all heard about Director Pompeo‚Äôs accomplishments. ... It is rare that a nominee to this position has had so many diverse accomplishments."
