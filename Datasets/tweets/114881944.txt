Democrats will never completely zero out third party votes. One percent is actually an astonishing accomplishment. If you don't want that 1 percent to decide the next election, focus on changing.... literally anything else.

@SamSacks @chrislhayes yes, then we disagree! I don't think decisions by cable bookers nor people who write fundraising emails fundamentally represent the sum total of "the democrats." candidates aren't running on it, the 2020 contenders aren't talking about it, and I disagree w/ the generalizations.
@SamSacks @chrislhayes ok, but "the DCCC emails about this too much" is a much different and limited argument; and the rest sounds like media criticism.
@SamSacks @chrislhayes and with respect, this is exactly the phenomenon I'm describing. "Here's a Democrat/the DCCC/ talking about Russia" immediately becomes "it's too much."
@SamSacks @chrislhayes Adam Schiff is ranking member on the intel committee investigating Russia + the 2016 election, so yeah, I would expect he would talk about this more than any other issue.
@SamSacks @chrislhayes i think it's easy to differentiate from a fundraising tactic and what candidates are talking to voters about.
Right, and @ThePlumLineGS has marshaled some evidence on that. 		Also, you can't hold this position but add "Mueller should be allowed to work; let's just wait for what he says." Without heat and light, Trump would absolutely shut Mueller down. (he may anyway.) https://t.co/z5Wn9Nwo2A
I wish "Democrats are talking too much about Russia" pieces would at least attempt to describe the "too much" threshold, and show that Democrats are above it. Every piece I've seen just takes it as a given and excoriates them from there.

But! There's a bizarre unwillingness on their behalf to admit that's what happened. Instead there's been feints towards strategic necessity, which is nonsense: there's no real danger the Democratic nominee will lose in a 2-to-1 Dem state *in the middle of a blue wave.*
I won't even get into the merits Nixon/Cuomo for now, let's keep this value-neutral and just state the obvious: Cuomo and Nixon represent *starkly* different paths forward for Democrats. And party leaders made their preference clear here.
The Perez-Clinton-Biden endorsement of Cuomo was a major signpost in post-Trump Democratic politics, and here's the thing I find curious about it: the party establishment folks really really want to pretend it isn't.

@okwilliam it was. but i don't think Democrats have made clear whether they're ultimately willing to embark on that fight, CHIP talking point or no
(obviously a vote on DREAMERs before govt. funding expires could bail Senate Democrats out of this decision, but that seems pretty unlikely).
My strong guess is the answer is ultimately no - Democrats aren't willing to do that. And at some point they're going to have to make that decision clear and own it. (It won't be pretty.)
The basic question facing Democrats: do you want to own a shutdown? Do you want to withhold any long-term government funding unless/until DREAMers are protected?
It's a non-sensical statement - did Trump shut the government down or did Democrats? You can't assert both at once, though Democrats have been trying from the start.
Just want to flag a line from Chuck Schumer's interview with @maddow that is pretty revealing: "When Trump shut the government down, and we wouldn't go along, it's the first time Democrats did it and we did it for DREAMers because we care."	https://t.co/rY8LRtHvz1

Graham-Cassidy will pave the way for massive tax cuts. People who will lose insurance are just collateral damage. https://t.co/8q4lmYuDha
*Plus it drastically cuts Medicaid through the per-capita cap. So 32 million is a CBO-established floor, and "more than 32m" a safe fact.
CBO has already scored repeal-without-replacement as something that would leave 32m more uninsured, and G-C effectively is that after 2026.
There's no CBO score, but reporters can safely describe Graham-Cassidy as a bill that would leave "more than 32 million" uninsured.

@DanaHoule it's not their top role, but they absolutely do pick some Dem legislation/proposals to back, and I'm noting they didn't here. that's all.
@DanaHoule anyway I don't think they have to endorse it; just noting that they kinda sorta made a pass at backing it without going all-in.
@DanaHoule this is a major bill representing a possible shift in party direction, which I think everyone involved (except perhaps you) seems to get.
@DanaHoule in any case, not saying it's their "responsibility," whatever that means, just noting an oddly (or not) cautious statement.

So not sure Twitter is the great go-around he thinks it is. (And it's definitely hurting him in court.) In closing, #nevertweet
But I think media outlets are now being much more discerning about passing along Trump tweets without qualification, or even at all.
"Trump tweeted this crazy thing!" was all over cable news in 2016; huge amplification. He was manipulating media, not going around it.
His core base - white people over 60 - surely are not active users. His tweeting is most effective *when amplified by the media.*
Twitter is an echo chamber, even if you're president. Take fake accounts and non-US citizens out of 100m, how significant is his following?
