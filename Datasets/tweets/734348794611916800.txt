10. No, at this point they are all-in. It’s not because they don’t “expect better”. It’s plain old pride and self-righteousness tumbling around in a bias confirming echo-chamber fueled be desperate GOP leadership and conservative media. Don’t add to this nonsense.
9. It’s not just GOP leadership, but also conservative media. They’re smart enough to see the writing on the wall, but are they going to kill their ratings by being the one to tell his base they were duped by the Emperor with No Clothes? I don’t think so.
8. GOP leaders would have to admit the unsavory behavior they’ve engaged in to protect Trump to a base that is not ready to accept they fell for a con man. Leadership isn’t stepping off that ledge of their own accord - that doesn’t mean their eyes aren’t open.
7. The reality is that GOP leaders continue to protect Trump because they don’t know how to get out of the box they’ve trapped themselves in. They, along with Trump’s base would rather watch the country be destroyed than admit they made a grave mistake.
6. This is like saying you lied about eating the last donut, so I’m justified in robbing a donut store and shaking down the owner for a monthly grift. Give me a break.
5. To imply that because Democrats defended Clinton over lying about a personal sexual relationship gives a pass for the GOP to defend Trump for pathological lying, hush money payments, financial crimes and countless ethics violations is also ridiculous.
4. To imply that somehow Clinton, Bush, and Obama somehow numbed the electorate so much to corruption that Trump doesn’t make a ripple is utter nonsense.
3. The normalization of Trump has come through the sheer onslaught of his scandals and the Groundhog Day manner the media has afforded him. The same shocking revelations and behavior discussed each time like it’s new - an endless norm-shattering Ferris Wheel.
2. This isn’t to say partisanship, poor behavior, even corruption isn’t a both-sides problem. It is. But, a zero-sum interpretation is ridiculous. We have never had a POTUS that was as corrupt, unethical, untruthful and unhinged as Trump.

@GayTrumpFan @mcculley @farrellbruce2 @ChuckH300ACCBLK @ChrisMurphyCT I’m aware of the breakdown of gun deaths. Extracting for homicide makes sense, but gang crime would be included in that.
@ChuckH300ACCBLK @GayTrumpFan @mcculley @farrellbruce2 @ChrisMurphyCT I didn’t say they didn’t occur. I said that it’s not happening like mass shootings in USA. It’s not somehow their equivalent.
@GayTrumpFan @mcculley @farrellbruce2 @ChuckH300ACCBLK @ChrisMurphyCT But stabbings aren’t higher than incidents of gun violence. If you’re going to take out suicide, you would do it for both data sets. Same with gang-related, though I don’t see why that would be discluded. It’s still crime.
@GayTrumpFan @mcculley @farrellbruce2 @ChuckH300ACCBLK @ChrisMurphyCT The stabbings in UK aren’t “mass stabbings” the way you seem to be referring to them. It’s not one person running around stabbing as many as they can.

@mcculley @GayTrumpFan @ChuckH300ACCBLK @farrellbruce2 @ChrisMurphyCT Give away #MAGA hats and National Enquirer’s with the guns and you’ll have your down payment in no time.
@GayTrumpFan @mcculley @ChuckH300ACCBLK @farrellbruce2 @ChrisMurphyCT Remember, Kit, that was how this conversation started. Private gun sellers are not required to be licensed and not required to run background checks.
@GayTrumpFan @mcculley @ChuckH300ACCBLK @farrellbruce2 @ChrisMurphyCT States that have universal background checks and mandatory waiting periods have a lower suicide rate - It’s not really accurate to claim regulatory laws don’t make a difference. https://t.co/ys9hmTnFDy
@mcculley @GayTrumpFan @ChuckH300ACCBLK @farrellbruce2 @ChrisMurphyCT You may be surprised how many people are influenced by memes. If it confirms their assumptions, they believe it.
@ChuckH300ACCBLK @farrellbruce2 @GayTrumpFan @ChrisMurphyCT I understand your point, but there is a difference in the products. The purpose of a car isn’t to wound, though it certainly can. The purpose of a gun is to wound. And there are plenty of things we do regulate the sale of for public safety.

@MarcusMigura Well, no. Even if you take a seriously conservative Dem like Manchin, he still caucuses with us in the really big issues and would add to our majority. If you primary him, you lose to a Republican and the reverse is true.
@Tweet_tracker1 Well, this is why you have a big tent party. And I’m not opposed to running more progressive Dems, but doing so on a safe seat or in a heavily Red district isn’t a good strategy right now. Also note this article isn’t about AOC, it’s about Justice Dems.
No, @LindseyGrahamSC, it’s not “about him”. It’s about our country, our democracy, and the people you’ve been elected to serve. Your sycophantic allegiance is disturbing and wrong. It’s time for you to go, Wormtail. https://t.co/v0Mp1KF7fw

@SkyLightPattern @Deemoney521 @leahmcelrath @ryangrim @DemsWork4USA Perhaps. Our goal is to flip and retain seats and take power away from the GOP. I can tell you as someone entrenched in primary numbers, JD candidates didn’t do that well overall. The ones we thought could win we gave our support to.
@SkyLightPattern @Deemoney521 @leahmcelrath @ryangrim @DemsWork4USA JD can’t give money to candidates. Neither can we. FEC rules. We raise $ directly for candidates- doesn’t pass through us. We are also completely small donor.
@SkyLightPattern You’re right about that. We take great care to bring along supporters of the primary loser. It takes time and dialogue.
@SkyLightPattern @Deemoney521 @leahmcelrath @ryangrim @DemsWork4USA I think you can see from the chart we went after more seats than the DCCC
@SkyLightPattern @Deemoney521 @leahmcelrath @ryangrim @DemsWork4USA We assess candidates by district. We  draw on data from the district and input from local grassroots activists to determine the candidate that has the best chance of winning the general. So, it’s a diverse range.
@SkyLightPattern @Deemoney521 @leahmcelrath @ryangrim You asked how other 1st year orgs did. I’m showing you.
@SkyLightPattern @Deemoney521 @leahmcelrath @ryangrim I’m the Director of @DemsWork4USA. We’ve been around less time than JD, started in June 2017. JD brought in 10x the $$ we did. And we specifically targeted competitive races. https://t.co/0jmdOs0EkJ

@sexygirl798 @PsycheSojourn @Selena_Adera @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Yes, if she doesn't pay attention to her constituents she won't last long.
@AmericanCMR @PsycheSojourn @Selena_Adera @sexygirl798 @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Her base is the far Left. Judging on numbers I've seen, I wouldn't say she's pandering to her actual voters. Having a lot of Twitter/IG support isn't the same as having support in your district. She needs to focus on local issues.
@PsycheSojourn @Selena_Adera @sexygirl798 @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC I think it's possible, not likely, that her self-preservation will kick in and she'll try to reach a broader part of the political Left. And, to be clear, I don't think she is a novelty, but I think the current obsession with her is a bit novel. Our voices need to be louder.
@PsycheSojourn @Selena_Adera @sexygirl798 @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC My position is that JD and similar groups are trying to create a Tea Party scenario at an incredibly vulnerable time. I think it's dangerous and could result in losing seats or worse. JD is advising AOC and she is definitely pandering to her base.
@NaphiSoc Nothing is stopping voices from being heard, Naphi, just saying that risking safe seats is foolish right now.
@uniquesrw @Arriadna Exactly
@Deoliver47 @Selena_Adera @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Yes, this is why we vet candidates based on winnability in their district.
@Selena_Adera @sexygirl798 @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC I see the red flags, Selena. I think you’ve misinterpreted my position.
@AmericanCMR @Deoliver47 @Selena_Adera @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Yes, she gives the GOP perfect fodder. Just like Bernie.
@Selena_Adera @Deoliver47 @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Yes, and he was also the owner of BNC. His hands are all over the whole thing.
@Selena_Adera @Hillduh7 @Deoliver47 @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Well, 31% actually only amounted to 22 primary wins out of 37 endorsements. Pretty paltry. But, they absolutely need to be pushed back on. That was kinda my whole point. BNC, too - which has really just been a revenue stream for JD.
@Hillduh7 @Deoliver47 @Selena_Adera @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC The numbers show that everyday people do prevail. That’s why JD has such a poor win-rate.
@ZoomsZoomz @Deoliver47 @Selena_Adera @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC I think it’s just easier for them to attack their own side than engage in battle with the GOP.
@sexygirl798 @Selena_Adera @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC The novelty will wear off. Her voting record will stand. We don’t need protest votes, we need action.
@Selena_Adera @Deoliver47 @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC Saikat has been making himself clear for a long time. The goal is to take over the party or destroy it. The narcissism is staggering.
@Selena_Adera @AmericanCMR @PSYCH_HYPE @AOC I’m not dismissing the risk she poses and am well aware of her connection to JD. My point is that she has a chance to move away from them and I sincerely hope she does. She’ll have a short tenure if she doesn’t.

3. A 31% win rate exemplifies the risk. Every seat matters. Every seat. We can't afford self-inflicted wounds or divisive tactics. This is not the time. Be clear-eyed about the enemy and focused on what it takes to beat them back -- or we all lose.
2. There will be no progressive policies passed without seats. Every lost seat at the state and federal level weakens our ability to fight the GOP agenda and pass progressive bills.

3. General election candidates who we didn't endorse in the primary had a win/loss ratio of 1:1. This means that our model of identifying and supporting the best candidate to win in the general as our primary pick doubles the chance of winning the seat.
2. We won 237 of 286 primary races - an 83% win rate. This is comparatively high for the amount of races we supported. 147 of the primary winners we supported went on to win the general. This is a win/loss ratio of 2:1. https://t.co/kLomPgJF7d
1. Why support @DemsWork4USA? Because our model gets results. We won 254 seats in the 2017-2018 cycle up and down the ballot. A look at our performance in the primaries demonstrates the power of early, strategic, grassroots support. https://t.co/IcLxpAyi67

7. If you want to reform your party, then run him as a Republican. Better yet, start a reform party and run candidates for lower offices and build something. At least be honest about it. This wolf in sheep's clothing routine is a bad look and an untenable risk to our country.
6. The formerly Republican politicos supporting Schultz know all these things. They also know the risk it poses to potentially split the vote and end up with Trump again. Are you not the same pundits who have aligned yourselves against DT for the past 2 years?
5. Nobody knows what he's talking about with "free jobs". Affordable and accessible healthcare is a Dem position, but what that looks like varies within the party. Same with education. Did you sleep through the 2016 cycle?
4. The Democrats are a "big-tent" party. Howard's claim that he doesn't support what the Democrats stand for is, frankly, a straw-man statement. When pushed on this he repeatedly says, "free healthcare, free education and free jobs".
3. And, yes, it may be that your party is forever ruined and a new one must rise, but there is no quick fix. Running Howard as an independent allows you to bypass the primary process. Claiming he is an "independent-centrist" is disingenuous. Independent of what?
2. The #GOP didn't get here overnight. The Southern Strategy, the alliance with Evangelicals, the anti-intellectualism, the systemic voter suppression - this has been a set trajectory for decades. One you were all a part of, even though you may not like where you landed.
1. Look, @SteveSchmidtSES, I get it. You want your party back from Trumpism - you want space for the ideologies on which you've staked your careers. Same for other Never Trumpers like @MaxBoot, @DavidJollyFL or @davidfrum. Running @HowardSchultz as an IND in 2020 isn't the way.

18. It's up to us to put a stop to the dangerous path unfolding before us. It's up to us to keep authoritarian regimes from gaining strength and committing atrocities. Activism and civic engagement are key, but, so is clarity and a nuanced approach. There's much work to be done.
17. We do this to achieve the necessary majority to fight back against the dangerous ideas now being espoused from the White House and GOP Senate and with the expectation that elected leaders will caucus together productively and pragmatically.
16. This has been the approach @SuMoh7 and I have used with @DemsWork4USA and it's been quite successful. We're not a ‘centrist’ organization. We support candidates across the spectrum that are the best fit for their district - whether that be Joe Manchin or Ilhan Omar.
15. That is not to say there isn't room for a range of ideas in our representation - so long as those ideas are in accordance with the majority of the population represented and coupled with the understanding that consensus is paramount in Congress.
14. The center is not an ideology in and of itself. It is an acknowledgment of our Constitution and the civic process. It is needed for stability — the space that constitutes ‘center” is also malleable. That is where political activism comes in.
13. Politics is not a zero-sum game, but it becomes one when "purity" becomes the guiding force of a tribalistic society. The far reaches of both parties lament "centrist" or moderate approaches - demonizing bipartisan efforts and compromise - failure and backlash are imminent.
12. We must be willing to hear each other, share ideas and how they are workable. We must start with a shared truth. Tribalism has made us so vulnerable to the very propaganda that has always been employed by authoritarian regimes. It is up to us to step out of our bubbles.
11. Party over country is disgraceful and dangerous. A Congress that cannot pass substantive legislation without nuclear options or emboldening the powers of the Executive is disgraceful and dangerous. As is ignoring the will of majorities to pander to the fringes.
10. The path out of this hinges on pragmatic, sober problem-solving -on citizens and leaders coming together in good faith. I expect calls of unity to fall on deaf ears, but I am encouraging a loosening of the choke-hold of tribalism - both intra-party and between parties.
9. Despite what we are witnessing, I am not without hope. Taking the House in the 2018 midterms is a light in the darkness, as are the many prominent Republicans who have stood up against the far-Right to put country over party.
8. The center takes the biggest hit. In America and Europe, the far-Right nationalism is what has emerged with the most strength. Center-right has shifted to the fringe out of fear of their base. Social democracy is weakened as is the administrative state. https://t.co/O1awn3x2cF
7. Putin knows that populism rises out of the fringes of politics - the parallel arms of the horseshoe. Armies of Russian trolls and bots have infiltrated far-Left and far-Right groups. It’s not stopping, and it won’t.
6. His influence is ever present over Trump’s agenda and the way Trumpism has been perceived and echoed throughout Europe. It is a weakening of global alliances and a weakening of the post-WWII multi-national institutions that protect western democracy. https://t.co/eLKPgYCdo6
5. The problem of wealth inequality is very real. Putin didn’t create the rise of populism, but he is absolutely inflaming it. It is not just his handiwork in the election of Trump and the passing of Brexit.
4. Populist leaders weave these threads into their platform, presenting themselves as champions of those left behind and the only ones who can ‘fix’ the problem. This should ring familiar to those in the US and Europe regardless of your end of the political spectrum.
3. National populism revolves around the following: a) political distrust b) perceived destruction of national cultures c) anxiety about deprivation of jobs and income d) dealignment of political parties with voters. https://t.co/OZ8bNlOO8X
2. We are failing to see the bigger picture, blinded by the myopic lens of tribalism. Putin, however, is clear-eyed. This is his vision and has been all along. Populism isn’t a solution to a problem. It is a reaction to a problem -largely the problem of wealth inequality.
1. In 2016 I feared for our country. On this #HolocaustMemorialDay that fear now encompasses the western liberal democracy that has kept order and peace post WWII.  National populism has spread across the hemisphere on a dark trajectory - one already outlined in history.

8. One would think Pence would have been interviewed by Mueller about what he knew about Flynn, the Comey firing, etc. To my knowledge, he has not been. I actually don't think that bodes well for him as it may be because he is a target of the investigation.
7. And then there's Flynn who is also a cooperating witness. Pence claims to have been perfectly ignorant of Flynn's relationship with Russia, but Flynn may have told a different story to Mueller.
6. While Pence may have been able to keep the public guessing about his connections to the shadier characters of the team Trump, it's likely Mueller has a much fuller picture. After all, Manafort was under a FISA warrant during the time he and Pence were communicating.
5. So, Manafort hand picks Pence and they are speaking on the regular - this makes Pence's performance on Fox pretty strange when he appears to barely know Manafort. https://t.co/izgZACBRBb
4. We know from Manafort filings that he was in communication with the campaign and transition team despite having been removed as campaign chair. According to Daily Beast, he was regularly in communication with Pence and advising on Cabinet picks. https://t.co/WGp7U4ZXZD
3. Some have argued that Mike Pence's brother would benefit financially from a lift of RU sanctions, but that appears like a tenuous link at best. https://t.co/LVCzEi8AeB
2. Remember, Pence was handpicked by Manafort for VP. Why Pence? Why did Manafort go so far as to lie about a plane malfunction to manufacture a meeting between Pence and DT when Chris Christie was already decided upon?
1. Pence has remained largely peripheral to the public #TrumpRussia investigation. Certainly he is a liar of the most sycophantic variety. Some believe he is just biding his time to become #POTUS. My guess is he fits in to a part of the puzzle that will be revealed by Mueller.

@occamsrazor45 Good question
7. Let's face it. Publicly wearing a MAGA hat sends a message. It is a silent slur, no different than the spoken slurs those boys experienced from the Black Israelites. This is what the Trump era has wrought. And it will not be easily diffused.
6. Take the Black Israelites out of it. They are a strange fringe group. But those MAGA boys immediately saw the indigenous people as a threat. Clearly, some of that group saw the MAGA kids as a threat. Political tribalism is heavily steeped in racial tribalism in these times.
5. A swastika on the neck conveys a whole lot of information about your political and social beliefs. Unfortunately, we are in such a strange era that a political campaign hat telegraphs the same type of information - at least a lot of feel that it does.
4. I once had a neighbor who had a shaved head and a swastika tattooed on his neck. One morning he asked me why I didn't like him - did I have a problem with him. I explained that I did and why. It was amazing to me that he felt unfairly judged.
3. The boys didn't know what Nathan was doing - and they interpreted it as confrontational. They were already on edge from the Black Israelites. They behaved aggressively in response. On social media we saw the MAGA hats and a white kid sneering maliciously at a native elder.
2. What is clear is that Black Israelites harassed the boys. If you're familiar with Black Israelites, you know this rings true. When the boys responded and the situation escalated, Nathan Phillips situated himself in between the groups to engage in a chant to calm the situation.
1. The Rashomon effect is when the same event is experienced differently by the people involved. The #CovingtonCatholic incident exemplifies this. That's not to say that Nick Sandmann is being 100% honest in his version of events - the look on his face is recognizable enough. https://t.co/3GoV4IvZjo

4. Make no mistake, these women leaders are here to fight and save our democracy. They are here to win. And that's exactly what we need. Don't hamstring them with condescending gender-based double-standards. It's long past time to move past it.
3. I don't imagine you voted for this female leadership because you wanted to continue on the destructive path of Trump and the #GOP. Yet, right away, we're placing patriarchal constructs on these women and judging them on likability, niceness, and decorum.
2. No one plays harder ball or behaves more brazenly than @senatemajldr, and he is backed by a #GOP that will not be dissuaded by concerns of ethics, compassion or decorum. This is what we're up against. We voted in a blue wave, but, specifically, a wave of women leaders.

5. Despite the fact that my gut instinct is that this is all a big red herring, it speaks to the underlying reality that manipulating us through social media is the weapon of choice for the Russians and we're all potential targets. No matter your politics or intellect.
4. Where things do get interesting is his vk profile. Which is a Russian social media site. And this is where I say it gets elaborate. There are pictures on here going back to 2009 and quite a few pictures with Putin - looks like some kind of youth event. https://t.co/Shv8nFhhIG
3. One of these sites presents itself as a Press Release: https://t.co/pYb5CLKrPy. 		Quite juicy upon translation - describing the extraordinary (and feared) hacker known as Klyushin and his relationship to Trump. https://t.co/jkjPXGdouC
2. Start with the name Klyushin - it's a play on "collusion". Further, Klyushin is not an actual Russian surname as far as I can tell. Searches of the name will lead you to Artem Klyushin's online presence - Twitter, Facebook and some scattered Russian sites.
1. The Artem Klyushin account has regained interest after tweeting about RBG. This character has actually been around lurking in the #TrumpRussia world for awhile. It's pretty safe to assume this is a hoax -an elaborate one, well fleshed out on social media and the internet. https://t.co/x8LOZIgebU
@kireau @jennycohn1 Once translated it seems pretty bogus, but who knows...	I'll translate it on a thread shortly.
@kireau @jennycohn1 He's definitely pushing the idea that he's a hacker. There's a press release about him on a Russian site, but he could've put it up himself. This is the site: https://t.co/pYb5CLKrPy

7. And there it will stand - an expensive, ineffectual symbol of racism and a reminder of the failure of democracy, while our children and grandchildren suffer to pay off the deficit you treated without care and avert their eyes in embarrassment at the legacy of you and the #GOP.
6. In the end, you know it is a symbol. The antithesis of America's monument to immigration. We'll have the Statue of Liberty welcoming immigrants from the sea and a Wall facing our Southern neighbors - because they're not the right kind of immigrants.
5. Most of all you know what Trump's Wall really is. You've read the reports. You know the terrain. You know it will cost upwards of $25billion, and that eminent domain lawsuits will tie it up for years. You know every analysis has said it won't effectively solve our problems.
4. You've failed us. So stop with your games and whataboutism. You know damn well @SpeakerPelosi wants border security. You know we've offered to give you the very same package YOUR Senate voted unanimously on. You know we've agreed to give the funds for real border security.
3. In your quest for power and judicial control, you have offered up our democracy, reputation and values. You have recklessly risked our economic security and foreign relationships on your 'legacy'. And a legacy it will be. A legacy of weakness, corruption and greed.
2. One might wonder if it's your mind or character that has given way, but I'm fairly sure your mind is still firing away. Still, if this is your best argument out of the trap you've set for yourself, I could be wrong. You have thrown it all away to aid a foreign adversary.
1. What's particularly grotesque about you, @senatemajldr, is that you're smart enough to understand the differences between those bills and DT's proposal. You're just pretending to be obtuse for your own political purposes. You're being obsequious. https://t.co/V8fN7Z8EHL

2. We have been harassed and ridiculed. This faux presidency has ripped this country apart. And they knew from the beginning. Had the FBI made their investigations known as they did with #HRC, or the papers reported what they knew this would all be a bad dream.
1. Vindication is bittersweet. It's tainted by frustration, anger and confusion over the realization that the truth was withheld from us. We stood strong and persisted in crowd-sourcing the relationship of DT to Russia in exhausting detail. We connected the dots. https://t.co/nPjvG7RAqc

@ProgressiveFor @DemsWork4USA I'd like the opportunity to discuss some of this with your group in a more in-depth manner. My dm's are open.
@ProgressiveFor @DemsWork4USA But, we've watched the "bros" go after him on his voting record - and they will continue painting him as centrist. When you're looking at it geographically, these terms simply don't hold their meaning - which makes a lot of the social media wars less impactful on actual voters.
@ProgressiveFor @DemsWork4USA We've been quite successful with this strategy. Our primary win-rate was well over 80% and we're quite proud of the impact we had in bringing in the very diverse 116th Congress. Keep one thing in mind - "progressive" is a relative term. Beto was a progressive to Texans 4/
@ProgressiveFor @DemsWork4USA These candidates can look quite different depending on the district. Note that it's not centrism we support, but we recognize the Dem party is a big tent party. And while one may dislike the amount of time a Red State Dem votes with R's - they matter with votes like healthcare.3/
@ProgressiveFor Our approach @DemsWork4USA is rooted in qualitative analysis at the district level. We analyze the district and the candidates -current issues and trends. We engage local activists, gather input. Our goal is to give early strategic support to the candidate most likely to win. 2/
@ProgressiveFor I look forward to seeing your report. Yes, much of the electorate is ready to move further left. Some of this is the natural pendulum reaction to DT (which was a reaction to BO), but it can be sustained through the civic action of a much more socially progressive youth. 1/
