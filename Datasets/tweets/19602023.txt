With this attitude you only hurt people. To work for what you want makes good people out if lazy people. To take from a working person and give to a lazy one is wrong. https://t.co/ZveuVVowXg
@dcexaminer @SenSanders We will only be free if we vote the demicrats out period. They are a bunch of brainwashed idiots.
The people are with you President Trump. Build the wall and stand tall. https://t.co/WH8B3Pt5z1
RT @realDonaldTrump: Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!
It will never work. https://t.co/iYKxfnDtfe
It will never work. When you tax people for what they have instead of what they earn it is not fair. Capitalism is the best system around. When you give to the poor you encourage laziness. When you over tax you make people lazy. https://t.co/gp8dOLr9xA
@CNNPolitics She is a liar and she is unfut for speaker.

@realDonaldTrump President. Have you read the constitution secion two article three. If i read it right you not pelosi have the right to convene bith houses for the purpose of state if union Speech.
@GIJoeMcD @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump It is am embarrassment to the American people that our representatuves will not do what the people want. They are forcing va convention of the states.
@TamiMil72470021 @WeAreOne_Q @realDonaldTrump Not so President Trump has been busy. He is not getting the support due a president from the media, the democrats or somrbrepublicans. We the American people voted for him on the promise hebwill complete the wall. The wall should have been built by President Reagan
@TalbertSwan @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich My for a bishop you have a vocabulary of a gutter rat.
@TalbertSwan @krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Just because president Trump is the son of one does not make him racist. If younreally are a bishop it might help you to read your bible more and treat president Trump like younwould like to be treated.
@krassenstein @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich You should be thanking President Trump nit mocking him.
@EdKrassen @krassenstein @realDonaldTrump @newtgingrich Mr Lincoln was a refined gentleman who appreciated education. He loved people and i find it hard to visualize him saying that word. I think we need show respect to our president.

@JosephNSanberg Well to me poverty is something people bring on themselves when they put gambling,illegal drugs,and laziness ahead of working and taking pride in what job they do. We need the trash pickup people just as much as we need the ceo of big companies. In America poverty is a choice.

@RepMaxineWaters Build the wall. 92 percent of people want the wall
@RepMaxineWaters Maxine you are the one who has overstayed your welcome. You are why we need term limits.
RT @RepMaxineWaters: Trump, you didn't get $5 billion to carry out your ill advised election promise &amp; now you want to declare an emergency…
@realDonaldTrump I think all the disrespect to our president is uncalled for. He has a tough job. I doubt any one if you criticising him could do better. Every man will do what he did and none if them want to get caught. Kennedy ,Clinton, Isenhower, and god knows how many others.
Surely the workers that are not getting paid because of the shutdown have a reserve fund of at least six months bills. It is only good to do that. I thought most of them would be prepared fot a shutdown as many times as it has happened.
@realDonaldTrump I just can not believe the disrespect being showed the office of the president.
@DonnaCarline1 are you singing somewhere now?
I love it.  Her arrorney in jail. Is that karma or what goes round comes back around.

@DaveVescio @DineshDSouza It sure would make me vote Republican. They are Nasty. Nasty. Look at them who would ever grab their twat or their ballot.
@realDonaldTrump You are wrong. God put President Trump in office. We need to respect his position. He is good fornAmerica. Jesus is coming back soon.
@KamalaHarris Shit like this is not a message for our kids. Promoting sin.
@SenFeinstein You are wrong. He will pick someone who is honest and will keep the laws of the USA

@KamalaHarris Kampala it is a question of right or wrong that should be taught at home. Look at Chicago.  Rooks always get guns so to take guns from honest people just gives crooks more leverage to do wrong.
RT @KamalaHarris: It is long past due for Congress to have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws. This is not a question of right…

@CBSNews Dirty coke cans where the rats pee on the cans is a good way to get this virus.  That is why you should never drink from a can and need to rinse the cans off too.
@ReneTorrez7 @The_Trump_Train I agree with you.
@VP @RepKevinCramer @SenJohnHoeven @POTUS If GOP would edit their mail outs to same address they could save a lot on postage. They would be just as affective.
If GOP would check their mailing list and correct the mailimgs going to the same address it would save a lot of postage.
@realDonaldTrump President Trump. You can not send boys to fight for our freedom and not allow them to vote. It is un American. I voted for you and believe in what you are doing except for the age to vote. It needs to stay at 18. Keep up the good work.
@realDonaldTrump We could pay for it with the savings to medic aid and welfare. Send all illegals home. Let them work to make their country good.
@realDonaldTrump Presidt Trumpplease d something to stop people with diabetes haing to go thru so much trouble to get testing supplies.
@realDonaldTrump Good question.
@Crobinfly @SenWarren While we are at it why dont we stop companys from calling people to advertise their products. Why dont we have a penaty for the people calling lying.
@Profoundiculous @SenWarren This needs to say ever instead of while in office. We also need one for two term limits.
@SenSanders If more people had guns that shooter would not have killed as many. When you take guns from honest people crime rises
@CBSNews I think they were right on target
@SenSanders We do not need your continued crap. Prove your statement or shut up. When I worked all women were paid accordingly.
@SenSchumer Only if you are not a democrat
@CBSNews What kind of monster does this to a helpless baby when you can take it to a hospital or police or fire safe place if you do not want.
@CBSNews I like our president.
@realDonaldTrump  I am proud you and Melania are in the White House. God bless you and your family.
