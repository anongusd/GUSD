@pgkstj It was driving me nuts. It just seemed to excited that he was going to get another pay check instead of happy for the people
I was watching the shut down prevention speech yesterday from Boehner, Reid, Obama, etc. & couldn't figure out Reid's hand gestures #tcot
@WebsZachAndrews Much, much better. Seems as if every time something begins to work in my favor, I find myself back in the hospital.
Hey, finally back from my 2 day hospital visit & I wanted to appologize for missing #ff. I am back now & will return to my liberal bashing
I want to thank all of my followers, the new, & the ones that stayed during my absense, for helping me surpass 2000. You are all awesome

@desicomedy What Americans have is what they earned for through their job. To take from Americans is the Liberal way - Raise Taxes
@desicomedy As long as the next President performs a massive cut in spending, he'll get the majority of the votes
@activated132 Uhh... Let's see, so many options, could it be... no, well maybe, Barrack Obama?
@desicomedy My vote for 2012 is not a pro-GOP, its more of an Anti-Obama
@desicomedy Bringing down the Housing Rates by increasing the Nations deficit by $3.7 trillion is kind of a Mute point.
@desicomedy I am not sure if you are being facetious or not. I am a conservative, something the GOP forgot long ago
@TpaforSarah That's because the politicians don't pay for gas, we the tax payers do.
@desicomedy Bush like Obama was an Idiot, between him, Reid, Pelosi, and Cheney I was surprise the gas dropped to $1.80
@TpaforSarah but in Dec 2008, gas was $1.80 a gallon. At least were I am from.
@desicomedy Well thanks to a conservative congress and senate, it was below $2
Vote for me, because I am a Liberal and I only like to spend money that's not mine #Obama2012Slogans #tcot #tlot #patriots
When Bush left the White House gas was under $2 a gallon, we will be lucky if gas is under $8 when Obama leaves #tcot #tlot #patriots
