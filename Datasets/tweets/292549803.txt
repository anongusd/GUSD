@lrozen Yes! Thank you for noting--we mentioned these allusions, that Stone spoke about WikiLeaks to senior campaign officials "by in or around June and July 2016." But it's also important to note Stone's indictment does not specifically mention this call with Trump and wonder why.
@RoigFranzia Does @StevieVanZandt make an appearance in this story? He does! He and Cohen ran into each other in Rome, Cohen told the Post in '17. “Congratulations on all your success,” Van Zandt texted Cohen, per exchange Cohen provided. https://t.co/Jek9qvJvdW
@RoigFranzia Cohen returned from an eight trip to Italy on July 17, his Alitalia jet landing at 1:25 p.m. Trump arrived in Cleveland at 2 p.m. on July 20. Between those two days, there was time for the Stone call Cohen described to occur. Did it? https://t.co/Jek9qvJvdW

And to clarify, what I mean is that SCO seems quite dedicated to the proposition that they should not be revealing information about uncharged people. If that continues, it may make for skimpier final public report than many are hoping for.
In context, a number of the redactions in the Manafort sentencing memo appear likely designed to obscure the identities of uncharged individuals, as opposed to necessarily relating to ongoing investigations. The implications there are worth mulling as we await any Mueller report.
