If Christians embrace &amp; emulate Jesus Christ's example we would have a GREAT REVIVAL AS NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN! Christianity isn't political it's indwelling of the Word of God! Judgement is coming! Where will you be on that day! I'm RAPTURE READY! Are you?
Being bigoted,  hypocritical,  racist,  or homophobic are not representations of Jesus Christ.  Jesus is love!!! No man can judge the heart of another.  God is the judge not us. We can hate sin without hating  or judging the person.  We don't hold the keys to heaven nor hell!
‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the¬†Law¬†and the Prophets.‚Äù
Jesus Christ said...He didn't come to change God's commandments.  He came to fulfill them. Through Christ we are made whole. He is our example! Two commandments given by Him. Most important.  Love God and your neighbor!
Being attracted to something or someone isn't the sin. It is acting upon an attraction that against God's guidelines that's sin. No man can judge the heart of another.   Hypocrites, bigots,  racist,  homophobes, and all other form of discrimination aren't example of God's love!
I'm a Christian. I'm anti-sin.  I don't judge a person for their sins as God has forgiven me He we forgive them should they ask. He will judge!  People need to stop throwing the tub out w/the bath water! Everyone is worth sharing God's love. Hate the sin not the person!
