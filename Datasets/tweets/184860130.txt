Also, definitely up Roe's ass by detailing how vulnerable and underwhelming his candidate was.

@matthewjdowd @JavsPena @neeratanden Policy points...like border security, Harvey relief and health care pay-fors? C'mon Matt.
Stylistically, Beto was sharp on several occasions (Lyin' Ted, partisan circus, etc.) But on substance he looked out of his depth -- the answers/rebuttals on health care and border security were tepid at best, and his exchange w/ moderator about rejecting Harvey $$$ was brutal.
Cruz was weak on climate change and debt/deficit, and sort of tone-deaf on the question of civility. But he was pretty much flawless on every other topic, surgically citing policy contrasts to paint Beto as out-of-touch with Texas -- and more often than not, Beto had no rebuttal.
Beto O'Rourke needed a blockbuster performance tonight.		He landed a few punches. But Ted Cruz landed more -- many more.		3 weeks from Election Day, debate does nothing to change the trajectory of #TXSEN -- Cruz comfortably ahead, Beto running out of time.
Vintage Ted Cruz, lack of self-awareness -- in answering question about restoring civility to politics, he snaps at the moderator:" "Don't interrupt me, Jason."
... How on earth, 3 weeks from Election Day, does Beto not have specifics on how he'd secure the border?
Beto allies have been waiting...and waiting...and waiting... for him to launch sustained attacks on Cruz. He's come out swinging in every answer tonight. https://t.co/p01SE5UYSg

For the record, I had MSU losing to Bucknell in some of my brackets, and to Duke in others. No honest person who watched this team all year could have expected anything more.
Whatever. Waste of time even caring. Izzo won‚Äôt change. The national pundits will still slurp MSU. And fans will keep blindly worshipping him, just like UM fans blindly worship Harbaugh, refusing to acknowledge what is painfully obvious to anyone outside of the cult.
I look forward to Izzo blaming missed shots.		You lost to the last team in, and you did it by doing exactly what they wanted you to do: launching out-of-rhythm 3s.		Maybe, after missing the first 20, you realize beating a zone requires dribble penetration and getting to the line?
Jaren Jackson will be a top-3 pick in the draft. He scored 2 points today and sat on the bench most of the second half. But hey, by all means, keep talking up Izzo as Mr. March. Guy just pissed away the most talented roster he‚Äôll ever have.
Tom Izzo exposed.		Great recruiter, runs a clean program. But the hard truth, as real fans know, is that his archaic offense, bizarre sub patterns and stubborn refusal to make in-game adjustments has cost us 2 chances at national titles in the last 3 years. Today was an atrocity.

@DemFromCT spending bill
"At my breaking point," one House GOP chief texts me. "Our party is worthless."
7) Getting colorful texts/emails. Will leave it here. I have no opinion of this budget deal. But consistency matters in politics. And there is a remarkable disconnect between GOP rhetoric and GOP policies, especially as it pertains to fiscal responsibility, circa 2001-2018.
6) Remember, 2010 felt like a watershed because that GOP class ran against Bush 43 as much as Obama: reckless spending, exploding debt and deficit, etc. Foundational to that wave election was the promise of fiscal restraint and the pledge to check the excesses of both parties.
5) This really isn‚Äôt about Ryan, who came to DC a dozen years before the tea party and was always establshment friendly.... It‚Äôs about the 87 House Rs who arrived in 2010 pledging fiscal restraint, and how few of them have proven intellectually/ideologically consistent.
4) clarify/nuance re #2... Ryan is and has been plenty conservative. But a fiscal hawk? Someone holding the line, defying party leaders? Nope. (And neither was Kemp, fwiw.) His budgets were the hallmark of a govt reformer, not a fiscal hardliner.
3) Finally, as it pertains to Ryan -- and as my colleagues wrote in @playbookplus -- this is not the spending bill you put on the House floor if you're planning a long-term stint as speaker.
2) "Paul Ryan the fiscal hawk" is a myth for the ages. This is someone who voted for NCLB, Medicare Part D and the bank bailouts; who hiked spending in Ryan-Murray (to be fair, dealt a terrible hand); and who's now championing a $300 BILLION spending increase w/ a unified R govt.
related thoughts:	1) I asked Speaker Ryan, day after Trump won, how GOP could avoid Bush-era mistakes that led to tea party. "I think the mistakes of the Republican government [were] that we didn‚Äôt do the right thing at the right time," he said. https://t.co/lGSmzD4J1t But...huh?
Think of all the Republicans who ran for Congress in 2010, railing against big-spending policies of Obama &amp; D-controlled Washington -- and who, less than a decade later, will vote for $300B spending increase under Trump &amp; R-controlled Washington. What a period of history this is.

@JeffMossDSR I'll concede that; and you should concede that there wouldn't be protests tonight if this concert were at DTE. See what I'm saying?
@JeffMossDSR Jeff. I know nuance isn't your strong suit, but read what I wrote. "Less" about Kid Rock. Please don't misrepresent my point to make yours.
Lots of people have disliked Kid Rock (and his music) for lots of different reasons; racial divisiveness never appeared to be one of them.
He's known for being civic minded &amp; deeply involved with charities in the city. Hence his NAACP award. Which is why this all feels strange.
Yeah he slammed Kaepernick and used to perform in front of a confederate flag. But KR was never viewed as racially divisive until recently.
Scene in Detroit less about Kid Rock than decades of resentment; 85% black city publicly finances arena &amp; opening act is a white suburbanite
Yes, Kid Rock has said/done offensive things. He also got a NAACP award and gives big to charity. A complicated guy: https://t.co/TOejZQaMZ6

@JayCostTWS yup, he's non-confrontational and felt it wasn't his job to rock boat, but I'm not sure that makes him responsible for Trumpism
@JayCostTWS the notion he should've gone rogue and opened it up - ignoring millions of voters, the 168 and majority of delegates - is silly
@JayCostTWS yes and delegates are represented on Rules Cmte, which even w/out Priebus "twisting arms" was vastly opposed to contesting Trump
@JayCostTWS Perhaps, but among the 168 it was not -- and they are the chair's constituency. He works for them, and he did what they wanted.
@JayCostTWS it's the chair's job, once someone hits 50% +1, to protect their nomination at the convention. Even Cruz acknowledged as much.
@JayCostTWS this is the only of your suggestions that is realistic and within the chairman's purview, but it's with the benefit of hindsight
@JayCostTWS what, specifically, could he have done?

@TopherSpiro @byrdinator Leadership was ready to do it; many in the rank-and-file were not. Hence the argument shared above.
Fair point. But the fundamental difference remains: Ryan had way more margin for error (22 GOP votes) than McConnell does (2 GOP votes). https://t.co/mPBplU7kJQ

Trump is right: the crowd here in Cedar Rapids is big and very loud -- he seems to be feeding off their energy, happily riffing off-script
