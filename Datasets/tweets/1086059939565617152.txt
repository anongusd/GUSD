@AOC Disgusting.Lobbyist are foul.
@AOC Our lives and future generations are at stake. How can people ignore the inevitable . What you would eat burgers and ice cream, rather than save the planet. DAMN STUPID.
@ChrisMurphyCT He lies by way of omission. Or one could say he uses executive privilege as a form of the fifth. At any rate he is a disgusting liar.
@BristolDexter1 @RepJerryNadler @NatashaBertrand He'll sweat a lot.ðŸ˜Ž
@kylegriffin1 Keep on clarifying with your statements. You are the trustees of the Constitution and our country. Come forth. You stand proud with your fellow Americans beside you. Blessings to you and all government workers for being here at all costs.
@RepDebHaaland @NRDems You will do a grand job. Glad you ate here.

@abbydphillip @Acosta He will try money from other government department budgets. He will battle that in federal courts
@axios The king's personal court jester .
@kylegriffin1 But to be worth 700 million. How do you even begin to spend it? I understand greed and the power issues,  it boggles my mind. Do you realize the portfolios and foundations that he could start to help people.

@_waleedshahid He has gone beyond the pale. Next thing, he'll try to quote Benjamin Franklin, when he  called for an inclusion statement of principle for emancipation of slaves. Or maybe he'll just break into gospels. Lord have mercy. ðŸ˜Ž
@thehill Not the likes, since he arrived in the oval office. There have been issues, but his influences are debacles that attack future generations.
@RepDebHaaland @MSNBC @AymanM Please we need to do more than tune in. Face the truths in our history. Learn from them. Snd keep them "a live" for upcoming generations .
@carolannleif @tedlieu He cannot go beyond lessons  to be learned from the Old Testament.
@thehill Just another aspect of Trump idiocy land.
@CNBC @RepSusieLee Take that, Trump and deviants! You can stuff yourselves with Mickey D's.
@thehill What about their parents?
@efonekpo @cmclymer @ElizabethKing @AOC @Ilhan You are not alone. Granted it is a small percentage to those having children. But don't discount yourself. It is creditable to not have children, considering our times. 		As far as gravitas is concerned  let it go. Build yourselves. Your unique.
@laurenarankin Their  egregious actions prove how hatred is taught. Hate crimes have a price to pay
@thehill Further more with Guiliani, he seems to have a  possible drinking issue. Or as Joe Scarborough states, he has had a large potatoe with dinner. If you believe that, I have MORE than the Brooklyn Bridge to sell.
@thehill Will the networks please stop giving him air time. He us  an embarrassment.
@BBCRadio4 NOOO. Bats are wonderful and, as all of us are an integral part of environmental chain.
@intelligencer @AOC Of it is radical. It takes away the wealthy's control in all aspects of our lives. Stand for the survival of the middle class.
@thehill Yes! Make stand for teaching and foremost for education. We cannot allow government to dumb our children down. Then they become nothing, but fodder for government manipulation by autocrats.
@coldantlerfarm And all is right right in your "corner" of the world.  ðŸ˜Ž
@barklandcroft It has been way too long since I have been to the Orkney and Shtland Islands.  You all are wonderful(and that includes sheep and dogs.) Best to you all.
@ChrisMurphyCT I am surprised he could find/get the words through his brain, let alone through his mouth.
@tictoc @lsarsour If there are concerns, they will be discussed and managed properly.
@Gillette Women shave. Take me home Gillette. ðŸ˜Ž
@thehill If it looks and talks like a puppet, must be that is his choice in what he calls life.
@thehill Vitriol is too polite a term to describe her.
@thehill @VP @SecondLady He is missing the point of Pro Choice..choice of making your decision. They never talk about horror women go through to just make abortion decisions.
@thehill So give them community service for entering illegally. DO NOT FAULT them for being compassionate.
@thehill What about all the other degenerates standing in support of his hatred? How about the school investigating how all this hatred is coming from?
@jnoisecat When will we stop teaching our children hatred?
@KamalaHarris YES. He merely did a "dance" regarding the subject. This provides him with leeway to gravel at his master's feet.
@MSNBC For all her daily spewing, how does one believe her, when it comes to a caring statement?
@BuzzFeedNews Hatred is taught. These students learned to degrade this gentleman for no other reason than he is different. These disgusting actions make them superior. Superior to what?
@axios The key words "several PREVIOUSLY rejected initiatives." He offered NOTHING new. Nothing  indicative of valid meaning for the long term.
@BBCBreaking It is not a deal on immigration. He AGAIN spews lies about the reality of border to fit his own con game at the expense of innocent children.
@MSNBC @Lawrence Willfully causing pain and suffering. He has no concern for the care of others.
@MSNBC Disgusting. Lies upon lies. But, I didn't expect anything less from racketeer.
@SReadBooks @almabooks @WordsworthTrust WOW!I haven't seen that book in ages.
@barklandcroft He is gorgeous. What a great personality. He has to remind you, he is in charge,  Baby or not.ðŸ˜Ž
@SenWhitehouse @SenateGOP @senatemajldr He is a dismal failure. He has no respect for the Constitution, let alone his fellow Americans. He has blackened the name of the Republican party. And for what?  A racketeer seated in the oval office.
@OrkneyLibrary Sorry about your balls. Grab some pints or take on some fine whiskey.ðŸ˜Ž
@KamalaHarris And we are thankful for John Lewis to guide us along the way.
@kmandei3 Superb classic look.ðŸ˜Ž
