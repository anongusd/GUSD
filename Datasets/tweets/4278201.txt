Google had to focus on not only ensuring their VR content was great, the hardware design needed to be great enough to do the content justice. One can't work optimally without the other		#DigiPublishNY
For example, if your friend asks in a text if you saw that avocado toast recipe in BuzzFeed's Tasty app, you could launch that exact recipe within the app without having to go to the app store, download the app and search for the recipe		#DigiPublishNY
Ephemeral apps are native android apps that don't require an install...they reduce the friction...they're there when you need them and gone when you don't		#DigiPublishNY
Lisa Martinez Gilpin, Google's Global Head of News &amp; Publishing is closing out the amazing #DigiPublishNY with Designing for Emerging Technologies
Programmatic advertising has hastened the decline in ad revenue bc it gave all the power to the marketers &amp; moved away from content-based advertising to people-based advertising.		It has also allowed sales teams to do less cold calling which is still valuable		#DigiPublishNY
An interesting area of opportunity, especially for health/fitness publishers is the world of wearables		#DigiPublishNY
Adding value for users, beyond just access to content, is important for subscription products. Especially if the value you're adding has more perceived market value &amp; doesn't add extra cost to the business		Membership vs. Subscription		#DigiPublishNY
When you have a subscription print product, where there's a ton of quality journalism, it makes it difficult to have a totally free digital product		#DigiPublishNY
Subscriptions work very well for NYT, but they're not right for every brand or audience		#DigiPublishNY
"People are stretched very thin"		#stateofdigitalmedia		#DigiPublishNY
National Review content managers wear many hats. When a small team is doing so much, it's easier to spot the inefficiencies &amp; identify the activities that bring the most value		#DigiPublishNY
Editors are more artists than business people, they want to create &amp; do new things. But you can't chase every new initiative the editors want to do		#DigiPublishNY
Enterprise goals help organizations stay focused on the new strategies that make the most sense for the brand, including from a resource perspective		#DigiPublishNY
The NY Times takes a very long term strategic approach, thinking about what's going to sustain growth in the future, it's more than a 5 year view		#DigiPublishNY
In an environment that changes almost every week, and the pressure that you need to keep up, it's a challenge to decide whether or not you need to change &amp; how quickly		#DigiPublishNY
@sheerling says the challenge for People is that celebrity coverage is everywhere now so they need to expand their coverage to more evergreen lifestyle content		#DigiPublishNY
For @BrianKroski, spending all this time and energy to diversify revenue streams and defend against Facebook &amp; Google leaves little room for creating great content		#DigiPublishNY
@EGBewkes says that the state of everything being so reactionary, and facing people's gut feelings of what is safe or not is especially difficult for a smaller publisher		#DigiPublishNY
NYT is challenged with increasing consumer awareness of the breadth of their offering beyond news		In other words, expanding the understanding of the brand to continue to grow subscriptions		#DigiPublishNY
Excited to hear about the Current State of Digital Publishing &amp; Its Challenges In Business. We're chatting with @Sheerling of @people, @briankroski of American Media Inc., @EGBewkes of @NRO &amp; @multilinda of @nytimes 		#DigiPublishNY
The tools are there to enable curators and make better use of their time, not to eventually replace them		#DigiPublishNY
BuzzFeed's core audience is younger and very female...teams that are interested in driving engagement with males can use the tools to find the content that performed abnormally well with that demographic		#DigiPublishNY
It's very easy to identify the fake followers on these networks		#DigiPublishNY https://t.co/UvWNfd89P4
BuzzFeed knows more about the manipulation happening on social platforms than the platforms know themselves		They were on top of the fake news issue from the beginning		#DigiPublishNY
BuzzFeed believes that their audience inhabits a complex, polluted information environment &amp; their role is to help them navigate it, not pretend it doesn't exist 		#DigiPublishNY
A bidirectional LSTM network helps them solve the problem of Chili Dog posts going to BuzzFeed Animals, for example		#DigiPublishNY
They use neural networks to make publishing decisions...they have a tool that helps curators find the best opportunities for sharing and promotion of content		With100s of Facebook pages they need to figure out which page is the best to publish a piece of content		#DigiPublishNY
Recipe2Vec is an internal system that surfaces similar recipes by learning vectorized representations for words in a recipe, but based around preparation method not ingredients or flavor profiles 		#DigiPublishNY
Feeds across BuzzFeed products are controlled by FeedRanker, an internal service which uses machine learning to rank &amp; feature the most engaging content...but humans can intervene to give lower-performing content another chance 		#DigiPublishNY
They use Slack to notify staff about A/B test winners and there's a dedicated Slack channel where every A/B test result is reported		#DigiPublishNY
They're obsessed with a lot, but especially with giving every piece of content a fair opportunity to reach the right audience		Content creators have tools &amp; dashboards to interpret data around what content is driving engagement		#DigiPublishNY
Data feedback loops are at the heart of the culture at BuzzFeed		They build a ton of tools in-house		#DigiPublishNY
@gilgul, Head of Data Science @BuzzFeed is going to talk about how they use data science &amp; machine learning 		#DigiPublishNY
Use the five whys, just keep asking stakeholders why they want the changes they're requesting &amp; you'll eventually get to the right solution
Positive communication is KEY		@Forbes brings a couples therapist into the office once a month to work with the teams		#DigiPublishNY
People are resistant to change, so you need to take baby steps		Transformation like this has to happen very slowly		#DigiPublishNY
you have to make everybody feel good about being product-driven		#DigiPublishNY
4. set product objectives	5. aligning developers and stakeholders around new process		#DigiPublishNY
5 steps to transform from project-driven to product-driven		1. create a head of product role	2. define "products", maybe your site is too big to be considered one product &amp; each page type is actually a product	3. hire for the specific needs of each product		#DigiPublishNY
The iterative approach leads to better products		Better Products = Better Users = Better Profits		#DigiPublishNY
Project management focused worlds are project driven...who hasn't been in the cycle of rebuild ➡️neglect ➡️rebuild neglect?		Processes need to change to a product management approach		#DigiPublishNY
@Salafel, Head of Product Tech @Forbes about to tell us how to become product-driven		#DigiPublishNY
There are actually 31 hrs in the day thanks to multi-tasking. 12 hrs is media/tech consumption. Over the next 5 years, our daily media &amp; tech consumption will grow by only 18 minutes		#DigiPublishNY
There are partnership opportunities to be had with Facebook 		When you tell good stories, people want to work with you...Facebook needs you for content		#DigiPublishNY
@danoshinsky Thanks! Great job. Awesome panel!

Cross-promotion on newsletters (for other newsletters you're producing) is very successful		#DigiPublishNY
Finding a conversational tone that is right for your audience is crucial		#DigiPublishNY
KPIs? 		open rate, CTR, active subscribers, unsubscribe rate, new subscribers		#DigiPublishNY
You can build an extraordinarily engaged community with newsletters, now matter how large or small		#DigiPublishNY
Newsletters provide a great opportunity to interact with your readers. Providing an opportunity for them to reply to the newsletter &amp; actually responding to their feedback is POWERFUL (both for the editors &amp; the readers)		#DigiPublishNY
Want to get started writing newsletters? Mediabistro just launched a brand new course in Copywriting for Newsletters		Check it out!	https://t.co/gd4uCN677x
Pop-up newsletters provide a great opportunity to test &amp; optimize opt-in/list growth tactics		#DigiPublishNY
Pop-up newsletters have been very successful for these publishers		#DigiPublishNY
How do you identify the content opportunity for email products?		First step is to figure out what your audience cares about the most and provide the most value to them		#DigiPublishNY
Emails are also very easy for people to share, on a very personal level, forwarding to friends...it's very different than sharing a post to all your social followers		#DigiPublishNY
Email is an intimate experience, so content needs to be carefully selected		#DigiPublishNY
Newsletters drive engagement &amp; habituation with the brand		They can be used to reinforce/remind users of content they may have interacted with on other channels		#DigiPublishNY
Newsletters are instrumental to subscription growth for The New Yorker &amp; The New York Times		#DigiPublishNY
Next up: Deepening Reach &amp; Engagement Through Email Products with @nypost, @travelinganna of @Racked, @elisgoodridge of @nytimes &amp; @danoshinsky of @NewYorker 		That's right, we're talking NEWSLETTERS!		#DigiPublishNY
ENGAGEMENT IS EVERYTHING		Don't grow too fast, high engagement with a small audience &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a large audience with low engagement		#DigiPublishNY
Publishers haven't found the right strategy around paid promotion on Instagram...if engagement rates are high you don't really need to invest in promoted posts		#DigiPublishNY
For the future of food on social, going beyond engagement and using Instagram to drive traffic will be a huge focus...figuring out how to use Stories to drive traffic		#DigiPublishNY
Turning the publications' editors into influencers as individuals has also helped to drive audience &amp; engagement with the brand		#DigiPublishNY
Building community is ESSENTIAL		Partnering with influencers, like having them takeover the account, drove @healthy_ish growth		#DigiPublishNY
Likeshop, originally created for ecommerce, is helping food pubs create a book-like experience within Instagram...super high CTRs		#DigiPublishNY
The success of posts on Instagram actually informs and influences the content that is produced for the magazines		#DigiPublishNY
@Basically How do we measure if content on Instagram is successful?		Engagement: Which posts are driving the most engagement across all followers?		Effectiveness: Which posts are most effective at driving engagement once they're actually seen?		Both more important than Reach		#DigiPublishNY
With @Basically, there's more overlap with the BA audience, but they're differentiating from all the other food accounts by using simple, slideshow steps vs the sped up video made popular by Tasty		#DigiPublishNY
The goal was to create a new audience, not poach (puns unintended) @bonappetit audience		A lot of care was taken to develop its own visual identity, voice, etc		#DigiPublishNY
Best Practice #1: Cater to your audience		@healthy_ish was launched in January to cater to the sizable but niche audience of healthy food lovers on Instagram		#DigiPublishNY
Food verticals have a lot of competition on social, but the real challenge with Instagram is the difficultly of driving traffic from the platform		#DigiPublishNY
We're back at #DigiPublishNY today! Super excited for this next presentation from @DashHudson &amp; @CondeNast, Biting Into Best Practices for Food Publications
RT @Lindzerella88: Making strategic decisions using insights and data is an emerging theme of today’s presentations. 	 #DigiPublishNY
this is amazing https://t.co/iTRtunHsbA
btw, national reporters writing a piece or two about that Trump voter in Wisconsin is not what he's talking about...in this case the reporting is still supporting a national narrative		Stop putting people on planes to report! 		#DigiPublishNY
Go forth &amp; bring back the trust in media by focusing on local voices, stories that connect us, and the how policies affect us		#DigiPublishNY
National stories can be told with local elements. How are the tax cuts, healthcare, steel tariffs affecting these local communities as reported in those communities		#DigiPublishNY
Stories about communities tap into emotions, those that make audiences feel like they're a part of something vs. national media which also aims to tap into emotions, but more often our negative emotions (likely bc Facebook engagement has trained them to)		#DigiPublishNY
Obviously important for politics (see 2016 election), but equally important for breaking news coverage...amplifying the work of local journalists, who are on the scene WAY before national media, would improve the coverage		#DigiPublishNY
National news media should be amplifying the voices of local journalists		#DigiPublishNY
Local journalists have 3 qualities that make them more trusted		1. they live &amp; work in their communities	2. they tell stories about what make us a community	3. they report on the effects of policy, not the politics		#DigiPublishNY
What can national news media learn from local news re: trust in media?		#DigiPublishNY
And for the last keynote of the day, The Best Stories Aren't in NY with  @magicandrew, the Chief Digital Content Officer of Hearst TV 		#DigiPublishNY
You need to be using data from every possible corner. Your data, your advertisers' data, your ad tech's data, your marketing team's data, your product team's data &amp; try to find the insights that you can't get by looking at just one of those sets of data		#DigiPublishNY
Sponsored content is definitely more difficult to execute on but it's what the direct sales teams love to sell		#DigiPublishNY
At this point, the lines are blurred &amp; editorial teams are starting to get more collaborative...but there have to be clear ground rules around what business side can do		#DigiPublishNY
BUT WHAT ABOUT CHURCH &amp; STATE?!		#DigiPublishNY
Ecommerce cannot be completely separate from the rest of your products...you need to get the whole team aligned around why readers are coming to you &amp; sell the right products for that purpose		#DigiPublishNY
@taboola @tribunemedia But she's super excited about the possibilities around Paywall + Blockchain		(First mention of Blockchain today)		#DigiPublishNY
@taboola Nicole Goksel from @tribunemedia says even as a millenial who is anti-paywall, she actually did just sign up for a publisher's Plus product		#DigiPublishNY
Chris Muller from @Taboola says paywall can't be a strategy by itself...if you want to put up a paywall, you need to do it slowly and also think about other streams		#DigiPublishNY
Audiences will pay for valuable content...THEY WILL		#DigiPublishNY
Successful advertising is advertising that delivers value for the users		We need a shift to value-driven communications		#DigiPublishNY
Beyond the technical challenges of diversifying revenue streams &amp; inventory, one challenge that doesn't get talked about enough is the challenge of educating sales teams on all the available ad products		#DigiPublishNY
We're talking The Future of Your Revenue with some fine folks from @TheEconomist, @tribunemedia &amp; @taboola		#DigiPublishNY
Is Content king? @freejaffe, Turner's Director of Digital Ventures says Distribution is king. The content creators who have figured out distribution will win		#DigiPublishNY
@kimbetech banner ads have their place, but the point is that content is better for connecting your audience to your brand
Brands should tell meaningful stories...stories that deserve to be told with or without the brand		#DigiPublishNY
Native ads need to be relevant, distinct &amp; on-brand...not surprising, but it was ocnfirmed when they asked the consumers		#DigiPublishNY
Stories are shared. Who has ever shared a screenshot of a banner ad? 		#DigiPublishNY
Our brains are prone to meandering, but a captivating story has the ability to quell this natural loss of attention		#DigiPublishNY
Good storytelling actually inspires a human reaction..."good stories engage ALL THE FEELS" 		#DigiPublishNY
Will Roth, VP of Content &amp; Strategy at The Foundry says brands need to think like a consumer and not like a marketer...consumers love stories		#DigiPublishNY
5th Pillar: Don't just create content, create culture		The content you create needs to be what people want to talk about...but not just reacting to the zeitgeist, creating the zeitgeist		#DigiPublishNY
4th Pillar: Create new content models &amp; experiences		#DigiPublishNY
☝️Whoops, that wasn't the third pillar	This is 👇		Make sure your content is WHEREVER your audience is...basically YOU NEED TO BE EVERYWHERE		(Linear, VOD, Snapchat Discover, Social Video, Live, IRL experiences, Paid apps, consuer products, SVOD, FVOD) 		#DigiPublishNY
3rd Pillar: Keep it real (balanced with keeping it light)...think Catfish &amp; Siesta Key		#DigiPublishNY
2nd Pillar: Keep it fresh...Viacom invests $4Billion annually on new content
First Pillar: Never stop knowing your audience 		#DigiPublishNY
@katesawall tells us how @Viacom keeps a focus on delivering for its audience #DigiPublishNY
How do you move to owned &amp; operated?	1. Impress your social audiences	2. Create a plan to distribute EVERYWHERE	3. Continually monetize your core audience		#DigiPublishNY
Forget about the millions of views you're getting on social &amp; focus on your core audience...move them down the funnel to higher revenue opportunities like subscriptions &amp; events		#DigiPublishNY
We need to move into an age of Audience Reconciliation...TAKE BACK YOUR AUDIENCES		#DigiPublishNY
4. YOUR BUSINESS NOW DEPENDS ON KYLIE JENNER 	#DigiPublishNY
4 Consequences of giving up your audience: 	1. You gave up leverage to grow traffic	2. You lost control of how your brand is presented to your audience (commoditized content)	https://t.co/cYcOSNR6ZX gave up monetization &amp; the rise of ad blockers	#DigiPublishNY
😂@mazdigital's Chief Revenue Officer just gave the most perfect analogy for Facebook's relationship with publishers #DigiPublishNY https://t.co/mOK8Fc2VuC
"Go find our audience where they are, not where we are" #digipublishny
Readers see themselves in the coverage they pay attention to, whether you like it or not #digipublishny
Translation infrastructure is a key efficiency point for a model like this #digipublishny
Vice found that as soon as they started to build up a franchise of their local travel content, bundled together and translated, a new/larger global audience was reading this local content...all without a ton of extra work on Vice's part #digipublishny
"THE INTERNET IS GRAVITY" As things get bigger online, they pull in more attention...the more you bundle and double down on one topic/area, the more attention it will bring #digipublishny
@VICE really has teams decentralized around the globe #digipublishny
What do loyal readers want? Offer something unique &amp; uniquely useful, make things for each set of readers &amp; go to where the readers are
@derektmead of @VICE is telling us how to make a global operation feel local #digipublishny
On dual-screen experiences: It’s really hard as a publisher to create an environment and get people to converse there. You need to accept that people want to have conversations on channels you don’t own #digipublishny
Always a challenge to customize content for each platform (and the audiences that are watching on those platforms) Changing size/format/talent/etc is really just surface-level customization strategy #digipublishny
Predictions? There will be a race to own the OS for Smart TVs, providing unbelievable power over content discovery #digipublishny #OTT
Need to use editorial expertise. Decisions to personalize or go deeper on a specific topic can’t be automated #digipublishny
There’s always a risk of overpersonalization, esp from a news org. Need to find the right mix of standardized vs personalized content #digipublishny
Personalizing experiences for users without telling them &gt;&gt;&gt; letting users opt for personalization #digipublishny
On personalization: If you’re going to offer up “local” content then you need to have content for EVERY SINGLE DMA #digipublishny
Being able to see the exact moment when stream traffic drops (like when they “go back to the folks in the studio”) provides impt insight that can help traditional broadcast too #digipublishny
OTT lets audiences control their live streaming experience...instead of the director dictating which stream viewers see, viewers get to choose and can even watch multiple streams #digipublishny
OTT is their fastest growing channel, faster than social and mobile #digipublishny
We’re talking with the VP of @abcnews digital about attracting new audiences through OTT platforms #digipublishny
"It’s not just the end product of your journalism that has to be coated in Teflon, but every stage of your reporting. Process, as much as content, has to be beyond repute."		https://t.co/BbxFxEpxWK
