@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff here are my sources		what are yours? https://t.co/g5wfhkMeNx
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff Pakistan also controlled which  rebels received assistance: Of the  seven Mujahideen groups supported by Zia's government, four espoused Islamic fundamentalist beliefs and these fundamentalists received most of the funding. Despite this, Carter has  expressed no regrets [9-11-01]
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff the decision to route U.S. aid through Pakistan led to massive fraud, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently sold on the local market rather than delivered to the Afghan rebels; Karachi soon "became one of  the most violent cities in the world."
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff The Soviets were unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, precipitating the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself.
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff U.S. support for the Mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion.
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff The thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war was determined by Carter in early 1980: Carter initiated a program to arm the Mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose.
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff In the mid-1970s, Pakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S. and its allies to send material assistance to the Islamist insurgents.
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos @AdamSchiff The program leaned heavily towards supporting militant Islamic groups that were favored by the regime of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in neighboring Pakistan rather than other less ideological Afghan resistance groups that had also been fighting the Marxist-oriented Dem Republic of Afghan
@ABCPolitics @GStephanopoulos wow you are that damn dumb and so is Dicks daughter	Operation Cyclone this was a CIA @AdamSchiff program to arm and finance the Mujahideen in Afghanistan [79to89] prior to &amp; during the military intervention by the USSR in support of its client the Democratic Republic of Afghan

@pahubb43 now my final one and take heed and remember!  		1 Peter 5:8  Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil  prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
@pahubb43 Revelation 2:10   Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is  about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for  ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will  give you the crown of life.
@pahubb43 be manifested in our bodies.  For we who live are  always being  given over to death for Jesus' sake,  so that the life of  Jesus also  may be manifested in our mortal flesh.  So death is at work in  us, but  life in you.
@pahubb43 2 Corinthians 4:8-12       	      We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not  driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not  destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus,  so that the  life of Jesus may also
@pahubb43 John 15:19                  	      If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but  because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world,  therefore the world hates you.
@pahubb43 1 Peter 4:16     Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
@pahubb43 John 16:33     I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In  the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the  world.‚Äù
@pahubb43 Romans 8:35       	      Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,  or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or  sword?
@pahubb43 John 15:20  	      Remember the word that I said to you: ‚ÄòA servant is not greater  than his master.‚Äô If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you.  If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
@pahubb43 1 Peter 3:16  	      Having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those  who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
@pahubb43 1 John 3:13         	      Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you.
@pahubb43 1 Peter 3:14  	      But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,
@pahubb43 1 Peter 3:17   	      For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
@pahubb43 Luke 6:22 	      ‚ÄúBlessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and  revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man!
@pahubb43 2 Corinthians 12:10    	      For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses,  insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak,  then I am strong.
@pahubb43 Matthew 5:10 ‚ÄúBlessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
@pahubb43 Matthew 5:44  But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,
@pahubb43 that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of  God rests upon you
@pahubb43 1 Peter 4:12-14 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon  you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you But  rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings,
@pahubb43 John 15:18    	      ‚ÄúIf the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you.

@mang0ld respectfully yours
@mang0ld as directer because you enjoy the movies as well. i can only hope you know your star wars.
@mang0ld it is not my intent to be mean spirited, or dissuade you from approaching the making of a Star Wars movie the way you see fit, but this is a saga that my parents enjoy, i enjoy my children, adult children enjoy and for many many years. which is why i am sure you took on the role
@mang0ld because you are basically playing a game it will take a lot of pressure off 2it allows for team building 3it allows for the maturation of a character so you don‚Äôt get the mary sue effect 4these games take time to unfold this spaces out the starwars movies so they are not back2bck
@mang0ld and plot   twists in the  story line hangs in the balance of the  dice.  The   Dragonlance series was  just a record of a D&amp;D game.  This  will   achieve many, many different  things for not just you but  those  who are   directly involved in the  production, 1 stress relief
@mang0ld Yes I get it you can‚Äôt  please all the people all the time when  writing  a  chapter in a saga so  approach it like a D&amp;D game. Yes  you have  the  start point, the  waypoints, and an end point however the  life and   death of these  characters, success and fail of the missions
@mang0ld I  saw in TFA &amp;  TLJ was: once upon a time there was ray, solo  died,  fought a bad guy,  found a map, found luke and bested the master  in 3  days, luke dies the  end. This is a short rendition of what  happened and  watching the movies  it made just about as much sense.
@mang0ld tell a  story that needed to be longer then a 2 hour space. The  writer may have  had a different vision in his mind however we are not  mind readers. From  my point of view, as someone who has watched these  movies since I was  able to walk, when a new hope first came out. What
@mang0ld . Let alone funding for all of it. The best advice I can give you is  look at the feedback from all the fans the good, the bad, and the ugly  with an honest and cold eye. Super fans know this Saga.  It was written  the way it was as someone‚Äôs vision but it was also an attempt to
@mang0ld I am choosing this post to give some constructive feedback about the Star Wars Saga. Now just so you know I get it, the pressure that has been applied on the outward appearance, I cant even imagine what a closed-door board room meeting looks like on the topic of fandom backlash

@DerfelBarada 024	1:50:40 speaking of activating a lightsaber from a distance ray could have done that here instead she gets into a game of tug of war with her lightsaber.
@DerfelBarada 023	Also note Qui Gon, Vader, Kenobi and many other Jedi‚Äôs used their lightsabers  as a  arc welder yet these red guards are able to block it with there arms  1:47:04 and grab it with there hands?	 ‚Äúit‚Äôs the armor‚Äù bs because they seem to be run through with lightsabers just fine
@DerfelBarada 022	Also note he wasn‚Äôt given the Darth Maul treatment 1:44:47 he was  sliced from mid to front not clean in half again script editor mistake!  And then 1:45:10 seriously fight choreographer in this sucks!
@DerfelBarada 021	1:37:19-1:39:12	1:42:08-	 the encounter with the senior psychopath, if he saw ray reaching out with the force to grab her lightsaber and was quick enough to grab it in the air and slap her in the head with it what makes me believe that Ren was able to deceive him?
@DerfelBarada and no i would not use her as a get away driver
@DerfelBarada 020	1:26:56 fly boy had a valid point, there was always a fall back position from your FOB  Leia would also tell the troops the plan, she had no plan! 1:39:12 full speed ahead! Note still no plan... what ever happened to auto pilot? why the slow speed chase back to there hide out
@DerfelBarada 1:17:54 someone who has trained for 3 days beats a master? Bull ! She can‚Äôt even figure out where her elbow is supposed to be placed and again the removal of the suspension of reality.
@DerfelBarada 018	1:0051-1:19:48 the explanation of killing Ren, note how did Duku die? Wasn't killing against the Jedi Code? Hence in Revenge of the Sith Mace Windu wanting to kill the Emperor Vader again said ‚Äúit is not the Jedi way‚Äù
@DerfelBarada 017	57:38 ray training with a staff any one who has trained with a staff will note the position of rays right elbow in 57:38 yet without moving at all in the span of 2 seconds to 57:40 her elbow is where? now on the Lightsaber skills training. No wait that has been canceled too.
@DerfelBarada 016 with that whole chase at 1:07:00 if you start the song from aladdin one jump ahead https://t.co/94j2cTnWh1 	it pretty much fits that whole chase... no joke
@DerfelBarada 015	51:45 where did hey get the ship?  From 44:00 What was the plan? How did they get off the main ship? Again breaking the suspension of reality.	Now finding the code breaker they were told to find‚Ä¶. Nope never mind disney spent money on SJW BS
@DerfelBarada 014	44:00 get to the casino on cantobite got it.  Now  how do we get off this ship? The hanger is jacked up as we all saw laya  was flying in space because of.. So what is that plan? 45:10 an intergalactic phone call 46:37 I was cleaning my blaster and it went off
@DerfelBarada 013 	this is a criticism on the script editor	40:20 shutting down the tracker plan, 	43:06 still planning with goldenrod and the defrocked X wing pilot 	43:23 code braking issue still planning  ‚Äúa little tied down right now with a union dispute‚Äù
@DerfelBarada 012	34:35 the cropping of the message that R2D2was carrying around this is a saga and the company wants to pack it neatly into 2hours of movie however when you are already 7movies into it with hours of cartoons and uber fans who know these movies line by line what is 2more lines
@DerfelBarada 011 r2did this every movie except the force awakens, he was sleeping that whole movie, what was that movie for? the script luke left a map just in case they needed him. Something tells me disney can not tell me why R2D2 is still around hint Starwars theCloneWars season1Episode6
@DerfelBarada 010	20:16-20:41 Why do you think i came out here‚Äù so the whole song and dance in the Force awakens was bull You remember R2D2 that intergalactic droid wh*re who stuck his probe in every computer he came across 3po pointed it out saying you know better then to trust a strange comp
@DerfelBarada 009	20:00-20:16 talking about ‚Äúneeding the Jedi order back‚Äù to fight the first order note Attack of the clones Mace Wndu the Jedi are keepers of the peace not soldiers‚Äù this   suspension of reality only works within the confines of the reality of what was already made.
@DerfelBarada Circling back to Vader, his suit was made to withstand the vacuum of space however any force wielder  KNEW who and what Vader is and  was. and he needs a suit to me in space, Leia was half Vader,  kylo Ren  was only ¬º Vader, never  forget that.
@DerfelBarada 007	 if we suspend reality that every one who is in the vacuum of space has all the Oxygen sucked out of them However suspension of reality only works within the  confines of the  reality of what was already made.
@DerfelBarada 006	However that was only 1 part to this. In the cartoon series star  wars the clone wars season3 episode15,16&amp;17 explains some things that you might be able to cover your bum with in regards to Laia flying in space,
@DerfelBarada 005 17:20-17:56 "Vader"	who was Vader? we will start there. "prophecy to bring balance to the force" ok what is balance 500 Jedi to the right and 2sith to the left? nope so vader went on a rampage and destroyed all the Jedi except Yoda and Ben. 2Jedi 2Sith, master and apprentice
@DerfelBarada 004	2] we are not getting into the books, we can debate the books another time but seeing this movie it is clear the Ms Kennedy did not read any of them regardless of her past achievements.	3]The actors are just playing the part they were hired to. This is not a criticism on them
@DerfelBarada 003	my rant.	1] this is a 2:31:57 movie on Netflix so i will be referencing the time index according to that because i am not buying this garbage.
@DerfelBarada 002	visually this was an nice movie to see to a point. so you get points for that.	The musical score to this movie was as i would expect from John Williams perfection.	however	The term suspension of reality does not apply to these morons who gave birth to the last jedi.
@DerfelBarada 001 	i watched TLJ a few nights ago for the first time i have been a star wars fan since i was in diapers during the 70's my 18 year old grew up watching I II III, athe second generation. the 3d generation is a foster child i am adopting we all agree this one sucked

@Education4Libs so you are DAMN right we need to take these kids from these irresponsible parents. they came from Honduras, if they don't like there elected leaders THEN THEY VOTE THEM OUT!
@Education4Libs Despite these developmental delays and emotional difficulties, homeless preschoolers receive fewer services than other children their age.
@Education4Libs Young children who are homeless are often separated from their parents, which can cause long-term negative effects. Homeless pre-school age children also are more likely to experience major developmental delays and to suffer from emotional problems.
@Education4Libs and now for the grand taco
@Education4Libs Homeless children begin to demonstrate significant developmental delays after 18 months of age, which are believed to influence later behavioral and emotional problems.
@Education4Libs The overwhelming majority of homeless parents are single women, many of whom were homeless themselves as children. Homeless women face many obstacles to healthy pregnancies, such as chemical abuse, chronic and acute health problems, and lack of prenatal care.
@Education4Libs Homelessness influences every facet of a child‚Äôs life ‚Äî from conception to young adulthood. The experience of homelessness inhibits the physical, emotional, cognitive, social, and behavioral development of children.
@Education4Libs coupling the illegal boarder crossing with the endangerment you have created a powder keg. 		what most of the people who are booing the removal of the children don't realize is these familes would be homeless upon arrival. this creates a different problem all together.
@Education4Libs removing the illegal alien aspect for a moment, these people trekked through a desert with no provisions with there children. that is the essence of child endangerment.
@Education4Libs this argument dangerously creates a moral vacuum. if a parent who lives in the united states brakes laws that cause the endangerment of a child, these children are removed...
@SenSanders Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates  on a  departmental basis in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.
@SenSanders Legislative power is vested in the National Congress of Honduras. The judiciary is independent of both the executive branch and the legislature.	The National Congress of Honduras (Congreso Nacional) has 128 members elected for a four-year term by proportional  representation.
@SenSanders Honduras is governed within a framework of a presidential representative democratic republic. The President of Honduras is both head of state and head of government. Executive power is exercised by the Honduran government.
@SenSanders so are you saying that Mexico and all of that region is just 1 big human rights violation? are you saying that the governments down there don't know how to behave and should have sanctions on them?

@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks Suspected of a crime he did not commit Franklins home was entered at night by the officers without a warrant he was punched Tasered during the encounter ultimately not arrested Buttigieg's administration offered the teen's family $15k in settlement The  family rejected this offer
@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks In 2016, Buttigieg drew national attention for the city's handling of an  excessive force and civil rights case involving three South Bend police  officers and an innocent African American teen, DeShawn Franklin.
@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks https://t.co/1fHqJaY4sE
@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks Cottrell and the officer Chief Teachman allegedly failed to assist, Lt.  David Newton, requested that the report be released, which Mayor  Buttigieg declined to do.
@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks After a report by the Indiana State Police on the incident,   Buttigieg concluded there was no discipline required of Chief Teachman,  a  decision that caused the head of the Board of Public Safety, Pat   Cottrell, to resign in protest.[
@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks In 2013, Buttigieg's replacement for Boykins as police chief, Teachman, was subject to investigation for allegedly not supporting a fellow police officer during an nearby fight. officer Teachman allegedly failed to assist was African American.
@ABCPolitics @ABC @rickklein @maryaliceparks In 2012, demoted the first African American police chief of  S Bend, Boykins, and fired police comm dir DePaepe, following the revelation of taped telephone conversations  between four white South Bend police officers and the spouse of an officer.
