@herworld5 Thank you
@herworld5 I will post update after

No child support order was issued. Under Federal Law SSI and SSDI can not be garnished for child support. My Attorney showed up presented federal law my order is 0 at this time.
Magistrate Huntley in Stark County Juvinile Court likes to give parents unreasonable child support orders. I'm spending thousands on an Attorney to regain custody now this.
So CPS forcibly take my children almost a year ago, now almost a year later the state of Ohio is demanding I pay child support. What kind of f up system is this

Missing my children!! It's so hard sometimes being at home. My fiancee works hard all week and he's not home till around 7 at night. People think being a stay at home mom is easy but often times it's lonely.
I love and miss my children. Everyday my mental health is impacted by being away from my children. Suffering with bipolar disorder is hard enough but to rip my children away from me the pain is unbearable at times. Every night I cry before bed. No mother should feel the pain.
Today I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Everyday in America families are torn apart by CPS. An agency that claims reunification and helping families yet they do the opposite. Parents are left at the mercy of hiring attorneys they can't afford because they love their children just want them back.

@DonaldTrump Thank you for your service. Please cut the funding and reform CPS. As a loving mother CPS has torn my life and children's life apart.
CPS drains parents financially. We have a house payment, utilities, two car payments and other bills yet since my court appointed Attorney has done nothing on my case we are firing her today and hiring an Attorney at 2500 putting it on a credit card.
I have prepared all the documents and my complaint to file in federal court.
Than CPS told the Judge that I failed to make substantial progress on the case plan. That is not true because the case worker failed to set up the services. More lies in court.
CPS never provided the recommended services from the parenting assessment I completed. It was recommended that my children and I have family counseling and joint counseling with my 16 yr old. Yet the agency failed to set the services up.
So today an Attorney GAL is coming to my house for a home visit. Because the children's Attorney GAL refuses to do a home visit. I am also firing my court appointed Attorney today and hiring my own Attorney at this point.

@ddlovato Please support the return of my children. As you suffer from bipolar disorder and have tried to raise awareness and fight stigma. I am trying to get my children back that were taken from me because of my diagnosis.
@lynnrose789 I have it posted on Twitter. I'm new to Twitter so learning.
@lynnrose789 We can't afford to hire legal counsel and that is why I started the gofundme page please share
@Sweetie4Liberty I continue to fight back legally and will until my children come home one day.
@Sweetie4Liberty Yes it is however I now will have to fight my parents for my children. It has destroyed relationships and my family.
@lynnrose789 I am engaged and my fiancee and I purchased a 3 bedroom home the end of March. So yes we are financially stable and able to provide for my children financially and emotionally.
@Sweetie4Liberty In 10 months I have been subjected to supervised visits, 4 court hearings, home visits and an assessment. My visits suspended in April. I continue to fight. Court is in July trial by the Judge because CPS filed to give my parents legal custody of my children.

@PKupfner @terrybaas1 @soniarivera858 I'm not here to argue I'm here to get my story out!!
@Sweetie4Liberty It is a living nightmare
@PKupfner @terrybaas1 @soniarivera858 My children have never been neglected or abused!! They are 16 and 11 I've had them their entire life! Mine were taken for me simply being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Corruption does happen and my children wrongfully taken!
@lynnrose789 @Ga_freeman @cynleann @NoLongerIgnored @realDonaldTrump No Attorney's that I've talked to will take the case pro bono. I just started attending church as I bought a house a few months ago in a new area.
@IncrediblyCuri1 The Attorney GAL on my children's case has been awful. She refuses to do a home visit at my house and she also has been negative towards me. I was appointed an Attorney GAL to me as an adult as well due to my bipolar disorder diagnosis.
@IncrediblyCuri1 The past 10 months I've been living a nightmare and it continues. My children have been safe living with my parents during this but my family and relationships destroyed

@principaldjr Thank you
Anyone from Ohio? Stark County?
@principaldjr It is very sad I'm trying to find a way to fight back.
@principaldjr My case with CPS is being closed as they filed a motion with the court to give legal custody to my parents. However I am fighting back going to trial before the Judge. If needed will appeal my case. I will never give up.
@principaldjr I would of never thought in a million years that I would be in this kind of situation.

Foster Care is being glorified by CPS  and all that money!! This must stop!! #endcps #stopfunding
#stopcps #stopfunding #shutdowncps @DonaldTrump
@terrybaas1 @soniarivera858 You never know if it is true or not because CPS IS corrupt
Please donate to my gofund me page and help bring my children home!! God bless
The funding at CPS  should be used to keep families together and provide services. Not fund foster care and adoption. #fostercare #stopcps #stopfunding
My entire case was built of of my diagnosis, bipolar disorder and my mental health records. No abuse and No neglect. I have faced discrimination and legal abuse by CPS, Attorneys, GAL and a Judge.
GAL on my case refuses to do a home visit. Yet she goes visits at my parents residence. How can you make a reccomendation to the court without seeing my 3 bedroom house for my children.
@AliWonderHell @StopKidnap This is awful
@justTrishNicole @Mutterseellein @silvesteranita In my case my children were placed at my parents so they are safe. Yet it has destroyed relationships and caused more chaos in my family.
I have talked to city council members, county commissioners, mayor office in Canton, Ohio yet none of them want to listen to me as a parent regarding my case with CPS.

Everyone please consider calling into Stark County CPS in Canton, Ohio urging administration to return my children. Please consider calling Stark County Juvinile Court in Canton, Ohio urging Judge James to return my children.
Everyone please help support the return of my children. At this time I'm represented by a court appointed Attorney because I can not afford to retain counsel. I have shared a gofund me page I set up please consider donating to it to help me raise funds to retain private counsel.
I will not be silenced by Attorney's, CPS or the Judge!! What is happening is a form of discrimination, corruption and abuse of power.
@cynleann @NoLongerIgnored I have a gofund me page set up trying to raise funds to hire an Attorney. At this time I have a court appointed Attorney because I can't afford to hire my own.
Abolish CPS
@Mutterseellein @justTrishNicole @silvesteranita It is very devastating
@Mutterseellein @justTrishNicole @silvesteranita That is the truth
@justTrishNicole @silvesteranita I am working on trying to find parents in my community
@Elaya_Jae_Doll That's so sad! I'm so sorry
@cynleann @NoLongerIgnored I can't afford an Attorney
Everyone have a good night!! Goodnight
My story https://t.co/5QpMjXtAxU
What CPS  does not want people to know is they destroy families they do it through all the federal funding they have. No mother or her children should be torn apart the way I have. I love my children very much and it breaks my heart every day that I'm not with them
@Colleen27318196 Yes I'll have to take my parents to court. They were placed with them in August.
@Colleen27318196 Thanks
Love the song "Queens Don't". Never let anyone take your power away!!
Everyone call Stark County CPS in Canton, Ohio demand they return my children! Call Stark County Juvinile Court Judge James demand he return my children! Ohio

@OneYFilms I struggle with bipolar disorder and CPS  took my children because of it
@OneYFilms Yes I have facebook
@OneYFilms Very sad!! Good parent's being targeted and society is unaware of the problem. Politicians don't care in my community.
I have been my children's only parent for 16 and 11 yrs. Their father has not seen them in 11 yrs and their is no contact. So for CPS to come in and take my children is simply wrong. I have a strong bond and that bond will never be broken!! I will always be their mom.
@OneYFilms It is the definition of insanity. This government agency comes in and ruins your life and your children's lives.
How can I fight back as a parent when I don't have the financial resources? CPS has all the government funding! Please everyone donate to my gofund me so I can hire an Attorney and fight back to get my children home to me!
Mental Illness has been used against me by CPS. No abuse and No neglect of my children. I have been in treatment for 3 yrs to manage my bipolar disorder. I have had custody of my children their entire lives until CPS destroyed my life as a mom. I am a loving mother.
Everyday American's are facing the corruption within CPS. As a mom my legal rights to my children are slowly being taken by Juvinile Court. My supervised visits suspended. I have not seen my children since Mother's Day. I have done nothing wrong as their mom.
