As @LarryOConnor said @oliverdarcy did his best to ignore the policy discussions at @CPAC - the only reason I attended for the @TheLCPR was to discuss and listen to national security and defense issues - it was his choice to not find policy https://t.co/fxq38SBuMP

@BuckSexton Tell me about it! I was just on @CNN and it was anything but a "fair discussion" of the Russian narrative and the collusion canard
This is important in light of the upcoming hearings on this issue - from @SidneyPowell1 https://t.co/SSEeDreu35
@BishopJEA @CNN @VictorBlackwell Pastor - apparently you did not watch the interview. The questions were answered by me accurately - there was nothing "unethical" and I was polite to the others on the panel - you as a holy man should seek to reflect on the truth and refrain from your own version of hypocrisy

@Patto1227 @WMALDC @CPAC @MollyJongFast @batchelorshow You are @aoc level smart
As I said this morning on @WMALDC in my segment on The Weekend Update - the left media attending @CPAC is on another planet - @MollyJongFast and her comments on @batchelorshow are typical - attack appearance or mock disabilities and not discuss ideas or concepts - is truly sad https://t.co/nPNXyqtCby

@DrillDarkSide @smithjoel86 @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter And - wow - you are showing us how clueless about combat you are... you really don't know how Intel officers come and go in combat - again - it's clear that you are not an NCO and have never been anywhere near combat
@DrillDarkSide @smithjoel86 @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter Yeah - 5 months for that tour - what kind of idiot are you?  And you - faceless moron wannabe - who has zero combat experience and hasn't deployed to anything more than a PX - you are one dim dude

@BenjaminGhazii @smithjoel86 @DrillDarkSide @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter Like I said - I don't know you - you were not invited - but here you are again - I'm in your head - like I told you before - you can't resist - I am in your head - you confirm it by stalking me... sad
@BenjaminGhazii @DrillDarkSide @smithjoel86 @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter OMG - it's the obsessed beta male stalker - still stalking me - really - I'm still owning you - you simply cannot resist
@DrillDarkSide @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter I'm observing you - I've outlined the facts faceless "NCO" - you are not a real NCO - you are a wannabe
@DrillDarkSide @smithjoel86 @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter Wow - and you lack basic research skills too... dude - I have a NYTs bestseller about my time in combat - again - faceless "NCO" - how stupid are you?
@E_H_Carpenter @JimMKMMA You are the biggest wus Marine I've ever met - I know real Marines - two of my best friends are real Marines - you clearly are a supply officer because you can't cut it as a rifleman
@JimMKMMA @E_H_Carpenter Huge difference  - apparently the loser USMC supply officer doesn't know about USMC aviation
@E_H_Carpenter @JimMKMMA LOL - so you can't carry a weapon - I'm sure they gave you a very nice pellet gun - you are too up tight for a real gun &amp; clearly as a supply officer (eyeroll) I'm sure you did a marvelous job filling out forms &amp; you are clearly a coward - a Marine with out combat experience
@DrillDarkSide @smithjoel86 @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter See - this is where idiots like you show you stupidity - you don't use your real name, you don't have real profile picture - you are a wannabe - I'll bet you have never been in combat - and are actually a Chaplin's assistant
@DrillDarkSide @smithjoel86 @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter And you, snowflake, are not one of them - how stupid are you?
@DrillDarkSide @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter Again - you are the kind of NCO who acts on emotion not fact - if you were competent you would have sought the entire story before you made a comment - you are just another triggered liberal, and you should never have served in uniform
@smithjoel86 @DrillDarkSide @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter You are an air force guy? Girl scouts are more military than you are
@JimMKMMA @E_H_Carpenter Air is good :-)
@DrillDarkSide @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter I'm not wrong - I've worked with idiot NCOs like you - men like you who lack attention to detail and accept half stories and act on emotion not fact - you are the kind of NCO that gets troops killed
@burgh1fan @E_H_Carpenter Yep
@JimMKMMA @E_H_Carpenter Yeah - thank you...I'm being attacked by a USMC supply officer (eyeroll) @E_H_Carpenter - who apparently can't be trusted with a weapon - and has zero combat experience - and who is a proud beta half a Marine...
@ericowensdc @again_censored @RadioFreeTom @DNC Dude - really - why are you fixated on penises?
@MichaelStahlke Dude - you are truly clueless... and yeah - apparently you are another coward who will never have the courage to make a difference or do what is necessary to protect the country no matter the personal sacrifice- you will amount to absolutely nothing...
@JayRealPants1 @MichaelStahlke Your career is dead ..still
@DrillDarkSide @XOofXOs @E_H_Carpenter I called out one idiot - you are equally an idiot
@E_H_Carpenter @FPWellman Yeah - from the ( eyeroll) USMC supply officer who has never been in combat...how much does it suck to be a junior Marine? Do they make you ride in the back of short buses since you apparently can't be trusted with a weapon - a true beta male
@P_Kwaz @E_H_Carpenter You stole it all snowflake
@ericowensdc @again_censored @RadioFreeTom @DNC Nope - wrong again beta boy - why don't you try actually reading the entire thread before you act like the ignorant ass that you are
@SweetieWalker @RobertMosesIII @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC So is my book - except mine is based on faith in God - yours is typical liberal faux God new age nonsense

@wthompson4368 @RepAdamSchiff Oh, yeah
@FPWellman @E_H_Carpenter And you still came out this stupid - goes to show you can't throw money at education and expect miracles
@E_H_Carpenter Only YOU and your idiot friends have been demeaning enlisted - I called out one idiot enlisted member for attacking me - apparently you USMC supply officers aren't not bright
@FPWellman @E_H_Carpenter So you did!
@FPWellman @E_H_Carpenter Yeah - go away - vacuous idiot who attacks veterans without knowing facts or background... just jumps in and makes an ass of himself

@BenjaminGhazii @KamalaHarris Why is it you butthurt snowflakes are so easy to draw in? It's like you are Pavlov's bitch - you cannot resist being stupid
@_Honestly_Abe_ @KamalaHarris And another butthurt snowflake liberal idiot jumps in - why is it so easy to get under your skin!?

@TheRickWilson OMG Rick - really - stop the beta male gaslighting...it was a direct response to one of your beta male friends posts... really, how stupid are you?

@JarBomb @RadioFreeTom Another beta male comments (eyeroll)
@markyzaguirre @RadioFreeTom OMG - from your picture you are the poster boy of beta males...did you pay someone to take that picture!? You got ripped off... you make George Costanza look masculine
@IanScott1982 @RobertMosesIII @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC Dude - is it cleaning day and your mom told you to get out and hang out at Panera for free Wi-Fi so she can change your sheets and clean out the empty bags of Doritos? You are clearly a basement dweller
@ColtSTaylor @RobertMosesIII @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC Yes - and apparently you are one
@RadioFreeTom Tom - I know - you being a beta male - the concept of going back at idiots who are you beta male Fanboys confuses you...it's hard for you to be so much a soy boy that you probably do hang out with them and do what they talk about in the post I responded to...
@Marcy_Powell @realdavehvs @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC And that is why you are insecure, not married and can't keep a boyfriend
@realdavehvs @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC Apparently you do... that is not what I said...do you have a reading comprehension problem or are you rock stupid?
@EthanMillardKSL @TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom @DNC @NatGeo LOL - butthurt snowflake - really...why is it so easy to get under your thin socialist skin!? You are triggered so easily

@RadioFreeTom Rest my case
@stephenrodrick @BarackObama Butthurt snowflake - your posting like a dumbass on my feed tells us all you know who I am... please tell us - how stupid are you?
Impressive and appropriate reaction by a member of law enforcement... lightening reaction and restraint when a second subject appeared... https://t.co/94IUP9XKg9
@TheRickWilson LOL, you are a clueless beta male - I've retired from 2 careers - the Army after 30 &amp; 1/3 years &amp; as an Intel operative (my Bond Moment in the Spy Museum) &amp; added careers of being bestseller author &amp; TV producer plus run a think tank - you are that which you appear: a failed hack
The left is only good at abuse and hoaxes https://t.co/gbvnUfpy3m
@TheRickWilson @RadioFreeTom Beta male brothers... good to know that the future of the @dnc is going to be lead by men who prefer bubble baths to basketball; days at the day spa instead of days on the range... brilliant

Speaking of @paulkrugman's predictive prowess...this matches with @RepAOC's "New Green Dream" perfectly... https://t.co/22IC0FswVS
@krassencrook @paulkrugman @RepAOC Yep
When you quote the genius who helped create the Enron debacle, and you are already committed to the destruction of all economic opportunities for your constituents, you embrace the absolute ignorance of "economist" @paulkrugman  - @RepAOC is beyond vacuous... https://t.co/wHm5KDj7j4

I'll be joining Rick Fowler on @WMALDC at approximately 7:30 AM ET to discuss the national security week in review

In other words @CNN and @CillizzaCNN won't get the outcome they want from the Mueller report so they are going to keep the "Russian Narrative" alive by questioning the report - got it!	https://t.co/BVbZNSlvIi

@RadioFreeTom Tom - no - no one bests you at whining - anyone can review your feed and know you cry more than a colicky 6 month old - and I'm thinking you probably have similar diaper change frequency as well
Excellent roadmap to McCabe's treason &amp; contradictions outlined by @WillKrumholz  - the bottom-line: @Comey's FBI was completely committed to a @HillaryClinton victory. When she lost they had to cover their tracks &amp; double down going after @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/mZM5un0MZF

@RadioFreeTom No, treason is treason - putting together the "insurance policy" with Strozk and Page in 2016 was the first act of treason for McCabe - the second was the illegal attempt to invoke the 25th amendment when there was no "medical necessity" - you really do work to be less than smart

@EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump @thehill Not a single element of the Steel dossier has been corroborate - to believe otherwise is tin foil hat stuff - for you to make this statement indicates your level of insanity

@BillKristol You are an old school Trotskyite - you are that "useful idiot" that people speak of - your political DNA is communist, and you incessant longing for the preposition of use of US military force to resolve foreign policy challenges is indicative of your Nazi-like zeal for blood
Well - when you are a racist, it's important to double down on pretending to "care" - Governor "Coonman" @GovernorVA is doing everything he can to draw attention to the fact that he has not changed since he got his nickname of "Coonman" https://t.co/ZWMWGeZzae
@psycho_ward @BillKristol You are both drunk and stupid

@DOGLOVER1718 @BillKristol Well - by your very comment you have removed all doubt for the world to see that you ARE stupid and yourself a dupe.
@GwynFuxa @BillKristol You probably wear the same aluminum foil hats as Bill Kristol - as to your bad breath I cannot speak to since I have been in line with Billy - but I suspect you have similar issues there too
@GwynFuxa @BillKristol He is lying
@BillKristol If medical science developed a drug that cured stupidity &amp; could prevent halitosis you would be all set - but since no such drug exists you remain a bad breathed Trotskyite dup who peddles complete hyperbole fiction to try to appear to have half a brain - nice try @BillKristol

@DiplomaticTo @BillKristol @Google LOL - you are clearly indicating that you are a beta male by saying this exact thing
This is not science fiction...this is real and a necessity national security focus area:	https://t.co/zQ2U03SD1r
It's clear that @Jim_Jordan is correct here - there was no "intimidation" - @LannyDavis went off script with the powers that be that now control Michael Cohen based on his plea deal - and he (Davis) had to say something dramatic to walk back the offer to have Cohen testify https://t.co/M3JsWgqJ4x

@BillKristol Dude - it never died - you are now and always have been a Trotskyite...anyone with a basic capacity to use @Google will see that you &amp; your Neocon ilk are nothing more than beta male progressives who because of your own insecurities constantly push for an imperial foreign policy
@maggieNYT You are a "reporter"? (rolls eyes)
@RadioFreeTom So you are calling into the show?
@WAlberts3 Well said!
@politicalkarin1 @nytimes @SpeakerPelosi No it's actually not - and you are a clueless snowflake idiot
What!?  @maggieNYT is a reporter? When did that happen? https://t.co/sTvD6DJWp0
Here's specification of @nytimes "fake news" - 1st this is not "breaking news" worthy, it's a rehash of a failed political narrative; 2nd @SpeakerPelosi is no security expert &amp; is not qualified to issue "security warnings" - it's only Pelosi's political opinion - experts disagree https://t.co/tFHbX2199I
@Manishka78 @realDonaldTrump Yeah - you are absolutely not attractive
@MissWrite @realDonaldTrump Yep - more stupid "qualification" due to sexual disposition - you are as bad as any male who says that having a penis makes him more qualified to lead - you are your own bad example. Experience, education and character are the key - not gender - you a liberal gender Nazi

@RepJohnYarmuth Well said, Comrade! Mao is looking up from hell with admiration and love
@albertocairo @BillKristol For someone who pretends to be smart you are clearly an educated idiot - you mock your own ignorance; the Neocon movement came from the @DNC and it's extreme Trotskyite philosophy... @BillKristol is a follower of this totalitarianism -how much do they pay you to be this stupid?
@tanyaceree @albertocairo @BillKristol What happened to your teeth? Are those real?

@kylegriffin1 @rolandscahill It's a shame that is an actual description of @AdamSchiff
@WerIstDeinPa @RepSwalwell No - the Soviets threatened the American people into the 90s - there were Soviet nuclear weapons aimed and ready - you really should read a history book or two on this
Well if the Scitt stinks...it probably is...	https://t.co/PHoA562uC8
@RepSwalwell @DLoesch @ScottPelley @60Minutes You are completely insane lacking both an understanding of ballistics and weapons - you should be ashamed of yourself for being so purposefully ignorant and spouting propaganda.  You parents should be ashamed of what an asshat you turned out to be...
@ssaywhatnow @realDonaldTrump LOL - not at all - I just got doe with pull-ups and a core workout - while you clearly are waiting by your computer to see if I would respond and call your stupid ass out - which you being the idiot you are replied to...I'm off to smoke a nice cigar after I block your stupid ass
@MaxBoot @RepSwalwell BTW Maxie,  research &amp; facts seem to serve you poorly as you lack research capability - any American can own "automatic weapons" aka "assault weapons" with a background check - you simply want to see Americans disarmed - you are truly a Stalinist idiot  https://t.co/HmXkGYKrHs
@PrahladFriedman @Chris_Clukey I stick with my original assessment - castrate yourself and cut off your penis in your own personal vow to protect women from men - clearly they need to be protected from you...
Excellent point - illustrating in bright terms if not for double standards the @DNC  and the left (but I repeat myself) would have no standards at all... https://t.co/v3EzcGjyfY
@DavidCornDC LOL - no.
@ssaywhatnow @realDonaldTrump so  - it's clear that you were and are "rock stupid" - we'd all like to know exactly what kind of rock stupid you are  - please tell us...
@Kennestark @ssaywhatnow @realDonaldTrump And you are simply another dancing liberal monkey...as I said...no charges - no indictments...

@katherinelafav2 @RepSwalwell No - clearly that is you - Bye, Felicia!
@RobertMaguire_ It's all doctored and modified by "scientists" to create a perception that presupposes a specific outcome that supports a political agenda... you are simply another non-scientist "useful idiot" - way to go!
@PrahladFriedman @Chris_Clukey Yes, they can - apparently you are not a student of history - the Japanese sack of China and the Russian sack of Germany - disarmed people were easy prey - you are an amazingly dense and oblivious member of the left

@MaxBoot @RepSwalwell The Second Amendment was designed to protect us from Stalinists like you  - you are the reason for citizens to be well armed - with a full spectrum of weapons...there is nothing principled about denying citizens their 2nd amendment rights - you are a "useful idiot" of the left
@ehschoenberger @iac249 @RepSwalwell Liberal values: intolerance, bigotry, denial of facts and science- you are all just like Stalin
@CooperRaeForest @zimzam1109 @XAces_WildX @Silky1776 @502Cub @RepSwalwell You are an idiot- there are "mass shootings" because of "gun free zones" you idiots create which are magnets for armed criminals- and in leftist paradise Chicago mass shootings happen every weekend
@PrahladFriedman @Chris_Clukey So - justice  for women and to make sure they are not afraid of men the change should start with you - so when will you be castrated and have your penis removed?
@DirtyWhiteShirt @RepSwalwell LOL- thanks for taking the time to chime in during your break from down stocking at Home Depot...it's really good they let you hourly workers practice your best writing skills... heck some day you may even have a job that pays you enough so you can move out of your mom's basement

@TobyasStorm @SpyTalker @SamanthaJPower @McFaul First - you and your progressive idiot snowflakes hate the 1st amendment - you demonstrate that here.	Second - you degrade the Republic by your Orwellian denial of "fact", you show that here too.	Third - you all were the ones insulting the President - you are one dim snowflake.
As @realDonaldTrump has said - and what I know to be true from my environment studies degree - the fires are man-caused but not remotely related to 'global warming' - it's due to bad progressive policy:  https://t.co/fpW0IMekq6

@NorthernPoint @MarkPaleo You are not calm - you are clearly emotional - you are on MY feed - you are triggered .. you are amazingly stupid
@YesItzMeDammit @MarkPaleo Wow - then you are even more dense that we thought - I own you and you are so insecure and trigger that a complete stranger gets you to have emotional reactions... amazing
@YesItzMeDammit @tljbykay @MarkPaleo Keep going - you all can't stop showing us how desperate and stupid ya all are...

Sometimes it's necessary to point out the obvious to the dim snowflakes on the left...if you show up on my feed &amp; act all hateful and insulting at something I post it simply indicates that 1) I am under YOUR skin and 2) YOU lack self-control...we actually enjoy making fun of you

Once in a while we get a "special" dancing liberal monkey snowflake who shows up on my feed and tell us how much smarter he is than we are - so let's all recognize the utter brilliance of @ass_flounder (apparently "ass" is the operative word) for his whining perfection! https://t.co/bUYx2ZNOkN

@MmabathoSisJ @KimberSoCo @SwimKathy @TheRida5 That is the point - she has zero power - period...she is a reminder of how bankrupt and bitter she is and you are - you are, like her, a parody that entertains us... you are just not bright
@BZZY93 @F1del_Cashfl0w @RobMarksMixes @umfufu13 LOL - this is what we look forward to from you lil' whining snowflakes - you are that which we know as the @dnc - no intellect - it's amazing that your mom still lets you live in the basement and spend your time posting on the internet instead of looking for a minimum wage job
@Marsides @DrBeKnows @HeyHoov @JANAMiziK They are very poor at it aren't they...

@SkylarJordan Propaganda from the left
@Ficshun @SkylarJordan @raisestrongboys @staceyabrams @HillaryClinton Really - how stupid are you? You really should read the history of the founding - it's pretty people like you who are the cartoons we make fun of for being a useful idiot to the left
@SkylarJordan It is true - that is a bogus study and you are a propagandist
@basic_random @ass_flounder LOL- both of you are on my feed showing the world how desperate, petty, juvenile, pedantic, rude and stupid you are... I'm in your little head - and you can't resist...
@ass_flounder It's stunning you stupidity - the video wasn't doctored - just more fake news that you are continuing to propagate...and - really- you need to get off of what ever mind altering drug you are on
@F1del_Cashfl0w @RobMarksMixes @umfufu13 Ah - another "left wing" intellectual shows up... you do understand people see this sort of desperation and it reminds everyone how stupid you progressives really are... you lack of self awareness is truly stunning
@Hoosyourdaddy99 @Havemercy_2 Snowflake idiot... again - you are on my feed showing thousands of people what a desperate whining idiot you are... your lack of self awareness is stunning
@RobMarksMixes @umfufu13 In your head... as you show us again - wow - what a moron you are...does your momma know how stupid you turned out?
@Hoosyourdaddy99 @Havemercy_2 As for you - you are the very evil that is in the Democratic party - vile and like the other idiot snowflakes too stupid to know you entertain us with your desperation and whining... you are on my feed showing us what an insecure liberal you are
@RobMarksMixes @Havemercy_2 No one was "stomped" - you are either living in an alternate reality or on drugs - either way you are too stupid to be commenting on my feed
@ass_flounder Again - you are the only fascist in the conversation - and a stupid one at that
@HeyHoov @JANAMiziK "apparently" you are too stupid to know what an idiot you are by coming on a stranger's feed to demonstrate what a pitiful desperate whining snowflake you are
@SwimKathy @TheRida5 Let me know when you become a New York Times bestseller - I'm comfortable in my forecast that you never will be one and I am certain that you are a terrible disappointment to your parents
@RobMarksMixes @umfufu13 And another flaming liberal snowflake idiot - dude really - the moment you have to comment on the feed of a stranger to show how desperate you are you lose - I own you - you can't resist - I'm in your pitiful lil' head
@Ficshun @umfufu13 LOL - idiot - you are on my feed showing the world what a desperate whining snowflake liberal idiot you are... you are entertainment for us and too stupid to know
@Havemercy_2 LOL- no - most Americans are living their lives to make things better for their family and country - not trying to put it down and whine like you and her.... really put down the crack pipe
@LuvLaTiere You apparently have a reading comprehension problem - the article outlines how the whole book is about her bitterness - really - you should try remedial high school reading classes
@ass_flounder You are the only fascist in this conversation
@JANAMiziK No narrative - fact as reflected at her constant whining - the book apparently is one long whine
@Scorebo18348944 @JANAMiziK Not remotely...she is a constant source of humor and leaves herself open to ridicule with her constant anger and bitterness
@TheRida5 Begone - stupid butthurt snowflake whining idiot
@umfufu13 Butthurt snowflake - really - what kind of idiot are you? Please let us know
@raisestrongboys @SkylarJordan @staceyabrams @HillaryClinton Awww - another butthurt snowflake idiot...do you all go to the same school of communication?
@SkylarJordan @raisestrongboys @staceyabrams @HillaryClinton Dude - you and your ilk with ANTIFA and political correctness are not American and again your stupidity is showing - we don't live in a "democracy" we live in a republic - yes - when you are that unaware of the type of government you live under you really should leave
Lil' @Acosta and his defense is not the beach the media wants to die on... legitimate questions to the White House and the @realDonaldTrump are important - what Jimmy was doing was not reporting - he was constantly trying to editorialize and debate...	https://t.co/LBpJetUZwg
Apparently the book reinforces the  "perception" that she was "disgruntled and vaguely hostile" by showing that she is still "disgruntled and vaguely hostile."	https://t.co/eczn4ccvnM
@SkylarJordan Gun violence is on the decline - you are more likely to die from a drug overdose, a prescription drug error or an auto accident - really - if you don't like it here move to Cuba
@SkylarJordan @raisestrongboys @staceyabrams @HillaryClinton And she lost because as I said she was terrible- she has the personality of sandpaper
@SkylarJordan @raisestrongboys @staceyabrams @HillaryClinton No - it should not. The very fact you say this tells me you are either ignorant of the founding fathers design for the college or you are a communist dup - either way - if you don't like it defect to Cuba

This is looking more and more like an faux terror - which makes me question the true origin of the "bombs" and the fact that none went off - this is a clue:	CONFIRMED: Powder Sent to CNN Was Harmless -  It Was Not Ricin - Bombs Likely Fakes https://t.co/hHEQFRle2a
The anger needs to be directed at @CNN - Jeff Zucker and his phony outrage matches his networks record of getting things wrong and in some cases, yes, putting out "fake news" - this statement only compounds CNN's culpability for the tension and violence: https://t.co/nemGD7Jmtj
@funder Yeah, it would be stupid to vote for democrats: who want to raise taxes - open the borders to all threats - turn their back on the American worker and destroy jobs - destroy the American healthcare system even more by making it too expensive for people to use. There is no up side

This guy is Batsxxt insane... @BernieSanders speaks of science fiction &amp; communism all in the same insane rant...his words are platitudes used by every communist leader since Marx and Hagel....this idea that the government can "judge fairness and equality" has killed billions https://t.co/afqpQByftB
I live in Northern VA - If you vote for @JenniferWexton you are voting for ANTFA more &amp; higher taxes &amp; the insanity of the progressive left -  @BarbaraComstock - the incumbent - has done real work to help the people of her district - don't be "Wextoned": https://t.co/HPvKsqeGsY
@QtConservative @DNC I have.
We Can't Win &amp; Don't Have To in Afghanistan-This has always been the case. This was my point in Operation DARK HEART. The path to victory is reframing our objectives &amp; letting the Afghan people remain tribal &amp; self-governed; our mistake was nation-building	https://t.co/W5NsIb0xgC

@ThomasD53685264 @torrymeade @Dudeteronomy @DNC I just checked this - source is NOT Ford motor - it's (eyeroll) @NBCNews - aka fake news
@torrymeade @ThomasD53685264 @Dudeteronomy @DNC Then post it
@torrymeade @Dudeteronomy @DNC Please post a real link to this - it's fake news otherwise.  And you apparently are just part of the propaganda machine as the growth is real as are the new NAFTA replacement agreements
It's clear that the mainstream media has become a propaganda arm of the @DNC and nothing more...	https://t.co/n92yDGfqnV
The ANTIFA thugs would have been locked up immediately had they tried something like this in Virginia - plus their menacing may have resulted in citizens correctly using force back against them in defense of property and body...	https://t.co/vDXUxFRtFY
@Pop_VoteWinner @cdutton69 OMG- a desperate buthurt snowflake - takes time from his duties making tasty latte beverages at his barista job at Starbucks - just to show what an ignorant ass he is. Nothing I've said is "debunked" - it's all fact - and like a cat and a laser you are too stupid to resist...
@RadioFreeTom Tom  - I know big words tend to confuse you but I trust you'll work through them - here is the full laydown of why you and @JRubinBlogger are very much Trotskyites - not conservatives:  https://t.co/HIKIwhcjh8
@BradMossEsq @mschlapp That is right - if someone is Jewish and commits a crime they cannot be touched...got it...all drug dealers and terrorists should be Jewish so they have this immunity from legal process (eyeroll)

@StillLawnBoy @TheOnion @Ocasio2018 And that is unfortunate because she and her vacuous nature will continue to weaken the Democratic party
@RadioFreeTom You are a smart guy according to your own resume - I'm sure you'll be able to noodle this through
From direct experience of my book Operation DARK HEART to now - redactions are 95 % of political nature to hide embarrassing facts, not national security &amp; here again FBI’s smoking gun: Redactions protected political embarrassment, not ‘national security’ https://t.co/bsT774s8GY
@DavidJSmith10 No - again - look at the science not the propaganda.  We do not make a dent in what already naturally occurs from Earth's oceans, soil, plants, animals and volcanoes - we don't come close to any notable influence over those pre-existing sources.
@DavidJSmith10 It's fiction - it's political science that is free of science... sorry - I actually have a degree in this - there's nothing that supports this contention - you can find "models" that show the opposite...it's all nonsense
These people would not know "life or death" even if the Grim Reaper was standing in front of them...man-made global warming is a fiction - we were causing "global cooling" in the 80s that was driving us to an ice age...this is a political stunt not science	https://t.co/lE1vdpSOgp
@Jb1905J @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Snowflake idiot - the Neocons are Trotskyites - and its notable that you, comrade, would show up here defending the Neocons....you do realize you are desperately stupid that makes you  - showing your ass on my feed - like a cat and a laser...
@SimonSaysBooHoo @RoySchuhmacher @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Yes - you all are losing...and you are VERY evil...so what you say is correct - - you will lose the war...like you lost the Civil War - and the KKK was defeated and you all were forced to release the Japanese-Americans you put in concentration camps...it was all your evil
@Shazamseventy6 Yes - It's amazing how much you buy on @ebay - and how desperate you are to show my followers what an ass and supporter of the KKK, Slavery, bigotry and all the other evils that is part of the @dnc - you are like a cat and a laser...
@Shazamseventy6 @Cling2Reality @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege wow...again - you are TRYING SOOOOO HARD...wow...tell us more about how "rich" and "successful" you are - we are all waiting with bated breath...please dazzle us with your brilliance - show us what a great intellect comes from living 30 years in your mom's basement - please!
@pupquilt @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - you don't deny it - which means you are pure evil and your modern @dnc additions of @MichaelAvenatti @BillClinton @BillCosby @HarveyWeinstein  - there is no argument - there is evidence of what an ass and idiot you are...wow.
@pupquilt @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege And you are evil - as your side is the party of slavery, of the KKK, of Jim Crow, of internment of Japanese-American citizens during WW II  - THIS is your history - and you are part of it and that makes you both stupid and a danger to your fellow citizens
@_Bayleigh_ @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege No you are not just an snowflake - you are evil - you are like a Nazi party member - as your side is the party of slavery, of the KKK, of Jim Crow, of internment of Japanese-American citizens during WW II  - THIS is your history - and you are part of it which makes you evil
@Shazamseventy6 @Cling2Reality @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL  yeah - I figured that is what you are doing in your mom's basement this evening...you do know you are again showing us what a desperate moron you are trying to show you are "smart" and "successful"  - on a total stranger's feed....I mean really, how did you get this stupid?
@Damiano__p @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - yes - I can see you are an ass expert - you are showing us all what a desperate ass you are - we love you idiot liberal snowflakes showing up here and entertaining us...you do know you are on MY feed - right?
@TilterWindmill @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege My tens thousands of followers show you are  both wrong and an idiot...and frankly on his point you have proven you are too stupid (really stupid) to be on my feed - bye felicia!
@Shazamseventy6 @Cling2Reality @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Yeah - you are just like the "millionaire" who showed up on my page- desperate to show us how important and rich he is...same mentality here - idiot - the moment you have to prove how important you are you are a complete moron...and I own you...really were you born this stupid?!
@Damiano__p @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Nah - I can see your ass in the picture - it is the same ass you are showing to all of us here as you do your desperate dance to get attention...what a maroon.

@Damiano__p @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege That is an amazing picture of you up the elephant's ass...I'm proud of you being so brave to post it.
@dvdrbrt @TilterWindmill @NavyJay @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege @DNC Yeah - I enjoy pointing out how idiots like you sign up and support the whole history of the @DNC resisting things like stopping slavery - you are that party - you are that mentality - and you are too stupid to even know how stupid you are
@bleakfacts @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Wow  - another desperate snowflake idiot who is of the party of the Confederacy, slavery, Jim Crow, anti-woman vote, anti-minority vote - you all have been the #resistance to all positive change in American history - double idiot
@LesFortunate @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Bye Felicia!
@_Bayleigh_ @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege I have proven he is a Trotskyite - yes - and you have proven you are a desperate snowflake idiot who is of the party of the Confederacy, slavery, Jim Crow, anti-woman vote, anti-minority vote - you all have been the #resistance to all positive change in American history - idiot
@joceemox7 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Ah - yes another snowflake idiot - who supported the last big Democrat #resistance of the Civil War - who is of the party of the Confederacy - slavery - Jim Crow - anti-women vote - supports abusers of women like @BillCosby  @BillClinton - you are not just an idiot you are evil
@SimonSaysBooHoo @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Says the desperate snowflake idiot dancing monkey who is whining on my page (you really are pretty stupid huh!)
@LesFortunate @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege You are a snowflake - snowflake  and a rather desperate and needy one...you are here on my feed showing us what a desperate idiot you are...do you drool when you eat your happy meals?
@Asehpe @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Awww - buthurt snowflake...we need more followers of Trotsky and who are loyal to the party of the Confederacy, KKK, Jim Crow and @BillClinton &amp; @BillCosby &amp; @HarveyWeinstein abusers of women?? Really? You are one very sick &amp; dangerous individual - I hope you don't own weapons
@TilterWindmill @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege It's clear that you are on some sort of mind altering drug there snowflake and way too stupid to be on my feed...you should really get around to moving out of your mom's basement, get a job lose 40 pounds (I'm suspecting you are like fat) and try try try to live in the real world
@mbow30 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege @charliesheen Awww...buthurt little dancing monkey - who is too ugly to even show your own face...and - how is it tonight in your momma's basement?  Watching the new season of Man in the High Castle and wishing you were actually an American Nazi?  What an idiot.
@dvdrbrt @TilterWindmill @NavyJay @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - yeah...you are here - on my feed - little dancing liberal monkey - trying sooooooo desperately to be part of the #resistance - from the same mentality of the KKK, ANTIFA and the intellectual center of the @DNC Spartacus...what a tool you are...
@Shazamseventy6 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege How much did you spend on Ebay buying all that stuff...I mean - like you must be up there with a ton of feedback stars...and those do look very snazzy on the wall of your mom's basement...looks like she doesn't let you eat down there and probably changes your sheets once a week
@TilterWindmill @Carpedonktum @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - again - did you have your momma help you spell the big words between sniffing glue?  You actually do live in an alternate universe...perhaps it's time for you to move out of your mom's basement and try living in the real world.
@TilterWindmill @Carpedonktum @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege There was no "perjury" - what an idiot you are...do you also sniff glue like the other baristas chiming in here?
@Navylife84 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Exactly!
@nalapuck @Carpedonktum @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Not hardly...apparently you are no bright...you really should do some research and stop being a tool for the progressive left.
@LarrisonAndrew @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - you are commenting on my feed in desperation - snowflake...the only reason you are on my feed is you are a desperate loser who is probably a massive disappointment to your mother and telling us you follow Tom shows us what a double loser you are
@iam_dr_cha0s @JeffMar54309503 @GStyleAtx02 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege No  - for you it's apparently an addiction...besides being so rock stupid - I'm pretty sure you couldn't muster anything more complex than janitorial work - so glue sniffing would work for you.
@iam_dr_cha0s @JeffMar54309503 @sean_spoonts @KurtSchlichter @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - I own you - I am in your head...you are too stupid to even understand  - you are on MY feed - you are showing YOU ass...sad
@BanjoPat1 @michaelkoppmk @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege And - another snowflake appears who supports the Party of Jeff Davis and the Confederacy - the KKK - who opposed women voting  - who was behind Jim Crow - who was against the Voter Rights Act - all Democrat acts of #resistance - what a great history!
@probbmd @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege I think he did that - plus he was big on instruction on how to delay sending help when an embassy is being attacked by terrorist and pretend that it was a video's fault
@TilterWindmill @NavyJay @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - another Trotskyite snowflake - really hit a nerve to make you all show up here and show us your dancing communist monkey ass...
@Shazamseventy6 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Oh, my  - such strong words from another Starbucks barista - who probably pondered all of his 30 minute lunch break to come up with something pithy...and failed again - as he has in life - miserably...
@Damiano__p @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Apparently the joke is on you, comrade - everyone who follows me knows what Trotskyites are - and yeah -- that thinking did permeate people like you and the Neocons - who do need to leave the Republican party- it is sad you are so desperate you have to show your ass on my feed
@MichelleHunnic4 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL - you are just another snowflake liberal cat chasing his laser - as evidenced by you being so stupid to show up and make an idiotic and desperate comment on my feed (eyeroll)
@PithyMcTweet @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege LOL  - he is just blind and stupid...like you.
@dima7b_ @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Well - apparently I did use it correctly - and you like @MichaelAvenatti trolling for prostitutes with a story to tell, show up.  NEOCONs are derived from the Trotsky communist line of thinking...clearly you are a fan of that thinking, comrade...
@michaelkoppmk @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege It amazing how ignorant people like you sell your soul to the cause of "progressivism" - you ARE the wrong side of history. You are the same as the southern Democrats that attempted to split the union - or suppress black vote in the 60s or stop women from voting - total ignorance
@JeffMar54309503 @GStyleAtx02 @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege Really - dude - you need to stop the glue sniffing while on shift  - you will get fired for not putting enough whipped cream on the Caramel Macchiato...
@JeffMar54309503 @sean_spoonts @KurtSchlichter @RadioFreeTom @USNavy @NavalWarCollege OMG  - another liberal snowflake - taking time away from making tasty latte beverages for his customers...did you ask your manager to help you spell the big words there Mr. Barista?
Wow...after a week of winning I was really hoping this would announce @RadioFreeTom defecting to Cuba - but no dice (sigh) - just more whining...remember - this Trotskyite is shaping the minds of Senior @USNavy officers at the @NavalWarCollege - badly... https://t.co/wF5clp0JiX

@MsPinkFink See, this is why you snowflakes really need to be prevented from owning firearms...you are clearly both mentally ill &amp; you have utter contempt and disregard for our Constitution - Cavanaugh was never a "sexual offender" - and rational people (you not being one) know he was set up

@GrampaHarold @gatewaypundit Bye Felicia!
I personally know the attorney who represents Ms Keyser - and he is a straight shooter.  This is very damaging to Ms Ford's account - her own best friend of that early 80s period doesn't know Kavanaugh and has no knowledge of any "party" as Ford claimed:	https://t.co/s76HONroLH
And - new information - shockingly Brett Kavanaugh was influenced by a Kool-aid commercial at 12 years old and bought Cherry flavored Kool-aid at the store...so freakin' what!? Man injured in bar fight with Brett Kavanaugh seen for first time  https://t.co/YadA2X8ePD @MailOnline

@omakyl @BillKristol :-)
@LennyKeller @tedlieu That's definitely true!

@BillKristol Or the brain spurs that now affect you...
@jaketapper Jake - the last stop in an investigation like this (before they brief the WH is going to be Ms Ford...she has provided all the leads she can (as obtuse and vague as they are) - this is grandstanding...
The media is getting it all wrong again - what happened at Yale really was Brett Kavanaugh heard Ice Ice Baby while drinking beer and it made him throw up... just sayin'...	Ice Ice Baby https://t.co/YNGbJ3wzQk

Back to Obamagate...it's clear Stefan Halper &amp; Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment under the "leadership" of James Baker was used as a hub of domestic spying - here's more proof: Halper Russia-China "study" lists consultants who say they didn’t contribute https://t.co/bWnx2ffwZS

Tom is correct - this is more evidence of the @dnc set up... they never intended a "advise and consent" process of Judge Kavanaugh - @SenFeinstein is as corrupt as the Chinese spy that worked for her for 20 years - she must be expelled from the US Senate: https://t.co/ZIHLlo7iuK
.@JeffFlake either has an IQ of a half can of sardines or he is complicit in the @dnc plan to destroy Judge Kavanaugh - tearing down the the country is key to the plan &amp; he again participates in the effort: Kavanaugh's nom is 'tearing the country apart' https://t.co/WpPLP190Y4

@islandlady712 @senjudiciary You are a snowflake liberal idiot.
But the most important take-away is that you @JohnBrennan remain unindicted for your role in the attempted coup against a sitting &amp; duly elected President - but as McCabe's documents &amp; more FISA warrant info is made public, don't worry, the Grand Jury will get around to you soon https://t.co/ezxqAa4zN3
@MercedesFleisc2 LOL - she is five years younger than me...and she looks ten years older than me...

@w_morr @LucasHagel @cjbj731 @BetoORourke @w_morr - what kind of snowflake idiot are you? Everything he has said, expansion of Obamacare, removal of 2nd amendment, open border extremist a - all liberal/socialist causes - and he is a socialist - our military, police and fire services are services - idiot
@w_morr @BetoORourke No - I did not.  He has no interest in the second amendment - and he spoke against the Kavanaugh nomination  -- Kavanaugh's record is strict  support of the Constitution....he specifically said we need judges who are "sympathetic" - who make decision by emotion - that is disdain
Sigh... yeah according to @keithellison the women in his life are not to be believed - as THEY all make up stuff... even though the women have documentation... eyeroll https://t.co/5EOsnYWCma
@cvpayne Charles - absolutely correct.  And as you know in my book, Operation DARK HEART - we discuss this - we had won in Afghanistan against the Taliban and were on the verge of eliminating Al Qaeda in 2003 - and we chose to stop and engage instead in "nation building" - big mistake
And more amazing evidence of brilliant intellectual prowess in the upcoming democrats... https://t.co/RNuS8c8sRl
Uh-huh https://t.co/CG0vVnrEvM
Keep in mind this is what @BetoORourke thinks is his best moments...if you vote for this man you are a fool...he hides his complete disdain for the Constitution and rule of law by saying nice platitudes...and - oh - yeah  - lying about DUI and accident he attempted to flee...wow https://t.co/HXRCttjACT
@KurtSchlichter Beta males... eyeroll
@JPelusio zero
Hope you will join me for this interview later today! https://t.co/lXwQBnRYZ9
This is how insane the left and left news outlets have become...the left is now AGAINST transparency. The "weaponization" of the use of classification is well known and well used by officials in the government to hide wrongdoing...the left wants to co-conspire and keep it secret https://t.co/LlFHGuXUnW
Yeah - important to watch - @BarackObama LYING about his recovery...remember @HillaryClinton ran against the Obama economy...eyeroll https://t.co/lUzJO6gffX
We need a different course and realistic policy in Afghanistan... @realDonaldTrump had the correct instincts on this and HR McMaster talked him out of his common-sense approach... https://t.co/QrM5E7sgOZ
Yeaaaahhhhh....hmmmm... that was the polling last time too... https://t.co/IIl9FqrCvh
I'll be joining Rick Fowler on @WMALDC tomorrow morning at approximately 7:30 AM ET to discuss the national security week in review

@JRubinBlogger @burgessev @politico OMG - you are a tool. Amtrak is available and a fun way to travel - she could be in DC easily.
RT @Jim_Jordan: Rosenstein denies the NYT story.		Mr. Rosenstein, give Congress the McCabe memos that we asked for in July and all the othe…
Note - Rod Rosenstein disputes details of allegations - but issues a "non-denial denial"...his potential involvement in a plot to use (as a political tool) the 25th amendment to upend the results of an election must be carefully examined:	https://t.co/ly3EyLMXEj
Well - color me skeptical...as much as Rod Rosenstein is not a sympathetic character in the current situation, the use of anonymous and unnamed sources as the basis for the allegations is questionable: 	https://t.co/84WHYlCJqV
@SenFeinstein No, @SenFeinstein - you do not respect women or victims- you use them as a commodity to score political points... you are what evil looks like in motion
This is is insane: Mother arrested for taking phone away from teenage daughter https://t.co/miJwrqjWmE via @abc7

He is a proud Democrat who is proud to use assault victims and the party that used girls and women to obtain power - who ignore real victims like the @keithellison victim Karen Monahan and support predators like @BillClinton - what a moron... https://t.co/Nap2jmYqyD
@CillizzaCNN What makes it different!? What an idiot you are! It's different because it's a real event and admission by @SenBooker - why don't you just admit you hate women and everything you do is motivated by your political support for the @dnc?
@IsaacDovere Wow... super fake news...he said it never happened... that is it...and when did you and @politico officially join the @dnc ?
@BradMossEsq @foxandfriends @EdWhelanEPPC Yeah - I'd like to see you take on this "libelous" case... eyeroll
Like the flawed justification for the Iraq invasion it's clear @JohnBrennan did the same thing: worked to create the "insurance policy" foundation by pushing @CIA to come up with non-existent Intel on Russia. This book appears to document his treason	https://t.co/WdtYvY3wUK

@EmilyLindin I don't have to do "research" to know what you are saying is Nazi-like and counter to the laws and principles that are the foundation of our republic
Federal employees and members of the military are charged to follow lawful orders - orders they disagree with because of political leanings is sedition - @JohnBrennan is preaching sedition and in my view should be under investigation for same: https://t.co/lWv5T2AFk5
Now...why on Earth would they refuse to cooperate...hmmmmm https://t.co/VF3emHogOR
@RonaldJMoeller Well - it could be... doesn't much matter - it's clear that the accusor is wrong, period
Good and fair assessment of the Kavanaugh accusor issue: https://t.co/sef2nR6TsH
As many of us have known from the moment of the @realDonaldTrump Presidential victory - there would be an effort to hide information from the President: FBI memos detail ‘partisan axes,’ secret conflicts behind the Russia election meddling assessment https://t.co/bKJvEiW52q
I don't think @MMFlint meets the weight and consumption requirements to be allowed into Canada - they have a much smaller population than the US and one quarter of their availability food supply being diverted for Moore's sustainment probably won't work https://t.co/ZVo4DlhsPa
Wow...a sane response in Maryland to use of a firearm! https://t.co/CreME1FTcU
@98833i @BetoORourke People who are paid a fair wage - it's illegal aliens that drive down the wages - the become slaves - and the left uses their misery to stay in power
@BaughanPatrick @jetrotter @BetoORourke I love @LouDobbs - we get along well - complain to @FoxBusiness
@EmilyLindin Here's something not popular but true - you would have fit in well with Goebbels and the Nazis - they had similar views of bringing harm to anyone they disagree with.  Good job!
Missouri - it's time for you all to replace this woman with someone who will represent your State, it's interests and it's people, not the left and it's desire to end the Constitution and our republic https://t.co/ruifm2BHGV
And yes - @BetoORourke reflects the left's true attitude - they want and need a "permanent underclass" to work for slave wages and vote for the progressive politicians who pretend to be their saviors...it's truly evil	https://t.co/yMTS5FRA8r

@MarkDice Yep!
@SenGillibrand Just wow... having testified myself I know your comments are pure propaganda - hearings are fact-finding and the results could be used to recommend an investigation - you are such a tool - and you haven't said a word about @keithellison
@paulkrugman Yeah @paulkrugman - not everyone is a vile and rancidity stupid human being as you - you need to stop projecting
@Melchizekek @FBI Yes

Yeah.  The only thing @realDonaldTrump will pull is @MMFlint 's unlimited access to all you can eat buffets all across the USA https://t.co/C23mrcYp0r
This is not a surprise - this is unfortunately not uncommon in the @fbi at this point  - it's a surprise it took this long for it to come out. Think about this: if the FBI is willing to do focus on political enemies who is left to do the real foreign counterintelligence work? https://t.co/YrawiAi4wB
