Iran want to be THE regional power. They want to establish a Shia'at front line from Iran to Syria Lebanon and all. Iran believe that terrorism is a natural use to expand says General James Conway
Speaking now General James Conway: my 1st point is to identify the problem &amp; since 1979 Iran has been the problem. for instance Iran infiltrate Iraq and killed about 200 of our soldiers. Now they are in #Syria #Yeman and they are trying to destabilize #Qatar &amp; #Saudies #FreeIran https://t.co/zeceQqR8Ef

Iran is not going to change of its own. at the head of organized opposition (@Maryam_Rajavi) there is a opposition to lead after regime change in Iran. the dictator regimes will never reform and we know that. says @JoeLieberman
the Iran Deal should be fixed and changed paying attention to Nuclear development and we need to do it. says @JoeLieberman I hope President and congress go one step further and pay attention to the regime itself and People of Iran who wants to though out the dictators #FreeIran
unlike 2009 the US admin turned away from the Iran uprising. but this time the administration are paying attention to people of Iran. and this time from both parties in US they are paying attention to Iran. #FreeAllPoliticalPrisoners #Nowruz
the rule of corruption is  hight and people are suffering from it and they are angry. money spends in #Syria #Yemen &amp; else where. just a few days again a prominent professor was sentenced to 18 months. B/c he said the rallies was not caused by foreign powers but by people
the Iranian uprising this year is different than 2009. they spread around Iran. this time is people against government. chanting against them and holding signs. shouting death to Rouhani &amp; death to Khamenei. says @JoeLieberman
