Kathy Kraninger will continue the Mulvaney agenda which has  "eliminated the deeply flawed aim of the Richard Cordray-era CFPB that involved years-long, open-ended investigations that have held hostage both businesses and consumers" https://t.co/tL5kI7jIt7
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Very pleased the Senate Banking Committee voted to move Kathy Kraninger’s nomination to Director to full Senate. I urge Senator McConnell to move quickly to bring Ms. Kraninger’s nomination to a full Senate vote.  https://t.co/5vkC7W4V2a
Rampant cronyism and influence peddling found at the CFPB under Director Richard Cordray https://t.co/zMbcgm2agi
It’s always nice when someone you respect agrees with you! In this case Sen. Mike Lee is making the same point that I made in several op-eds &amp; radio appearances: the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint is not anti-competitive—it will actually improve competition https://t.co/dqbaNgZuES
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is unelected and unaccountable. Colin Hanna on the Steve Gruber show: https://t.co/InVlLfvOL4 @wjimam
Support Kathy Kraninger for Director of the CFPB. It’s a partisan fiefdom, and needs to be cleaned up and reformed by someone loyal to Mick Mulvaney, not Elizabeth Warren. Read my piece on Fox News today: https://t.co/lU6J6x2Bky
Our friends at American Limited Government agree with me:  The T-Mobile/Sprint merger will create more competition not less https://t.co/0TE9s3s3Mj  @LimitGov
Judge Kavanaugh re @CFPB’s single-director structure: It “lacks that critical check and structural constitutional protection.” And this structure “threatens the individual liberty protected by the Constitution’s separation of powers.” YES!
