Kavanaugh chokes up before the committee: "Liza, all of 10 years old, said to Ashley, 'we should pray for the woman.' That‚Äôs a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old."
Kavanaugh calls the allegations a ‚Äúcalculated and orchestrated political hit‚Äù perhaps based on "revenge on behalf of the Clintons."	‚ÄúThis has destroyed my family and my good name. A good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service.‚Äù
Kavanaugh: "This confirmation process has become a national disgrace. ...you have replaced advise and consent with search and destroy."
Dr. Ford wraps up her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She said she is 100 percent confident Brett Kavanaugh attacked her at a party in the early 1980s. A GOP special prosecutor didn't appear to poke any significant holes in her story.
Rachel Mitchell, special counsel for the GOP, says in her closing moments that interviewing a witness in 5 minute increments is not the best way to get to the truth.
A key exchange in the Ford hearing:	Feinstein asked Ford why is so confident that it was Kavanaugh.	‚ÄúThe same way that I am sure that I am talking to you right now. Basic memory functions,‚Äù Ford said	When asked if she could be wrong, Ford said, "absolutely not."
Trump said he may delay his meeting with Rod Rosenstein on Thursday so that he can watch the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing
Putting additional pressure on tomorrow's hearing, Trump opens the door to being "convinced" to replace Kavanaugh.	"If I thought he was guilty of something like this, sure," Trump said.

All of this will vary across the country, depending on the insurance plan offerings in that area and the person‚Äôs income level
The price of BRONZE plans didn‚Äôt go up by as much. If a low-income person gets a big premium subsidy &amp; buys a bronze plan, they COULD pay $0
Premium subsidies are tied to the cost of SILVER plans. Insurance cos jacked those prices up to make up for losing the cost-sharing payments
This might sound wacky, but bc Trump cut the cost-sharing payments, some low-income Americans  might find Obamacare plans that cost them ~$0
Today marks the start of the first Obamacare enrollment period of the Trump era. Sign up runs through Dec. 15.
