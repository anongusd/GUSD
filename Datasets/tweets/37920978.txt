Tune in this morning to @NewDay at 8:30am, and @AmericaNewsroom at 9:10am. I‚Äôll be discussing our investigation and the subpoena sent to Mr. Comey.
It appears Mr. Comey believes he deserves special treatment, as he is the only witness refusing to either appear voluntarily or comply with a subpoena. He needs to appear before the Committees, as all other witnesses have done. Let the facts come to light.
The truth IS best served with transparency.¬†What is Director Comey trying to hide from the American people with his baseless motion to quash?
It saddens me to recognize Capt. Andrew Ross, one of our U.S. Army casualties who grew up in Lexington, Virginia. My heartfelt condolences go out to his friends and family, may they be comforted knowing we hold fast to the example of Drew‚Äôs noble service. https://t.co/5U2mhy4w6j
Mr. Comey should agree to these terms and see that we have the same purpose, which is to find the truth and seek transparency. In order to do so, he must appear before the Committees and answer our questions.
I have just offered to Director Comey that the Committees will publicly release the transcript of his testimony following the interview for our investigation. This ensures both transparency and access for the American people to all the facts.
