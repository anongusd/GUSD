@RepCohen I am certain Jesus never sexually assaulted anyone nor was accused of it. Special place in hell for people making these comparisons.		GOD IS LISTENING.
@LadyBleach @thehill YAASSSSS!! Maybe along the lines of Kill Bill or Death Proof.
@LadyBleach @thehill If they continue to receive support, perhaps it will.
@thehill This is the attitude that scares victims into SILENCE.		PLEASE KEEP SPEAKING UP!	#RoyMooreChildMolester
@GAD58 Be a toss up between a job offer or a proposition. Just guessing, unless you live in Alabama. If so, keep ACLU # handy.
@DrDenaGrayson @lauferlaw WELL, WELL, WELL.
@mrthagens @Trump_Regrets @realDonaldTrump Glad I didn't go down that rabbit hole! Come back to the light friend!
@GAD58 I'll buy that for a dollar!
@GAD58 Ugh! You are gonna need a LOT of therapy. Ask for more $$$.
Hey ohhhhh! https://t.co/SI540JSmz9
@LouiseMensch Right? Boggles the mind that a 3000 yr old belief has now been thrown under the bus to justify pedophilia by crusty, old, creepy, white racists. #SAD
@ericgarland @lauferlaw I missed the 'spiritual' aspect. No one is against the Bible. Now the PEDOPHILIA is another issue entirely.
@AnaHdzTx Ana! You bad girl!
@marcorubio You have the power to improve this situation. Will you ACT or just TWEET on this catastrophe of government negligence?		WE ARE WATCHING.
@waltshaub Just when you think you have heard the worst, yesterday happened. WTF??!
@MuslimMarine Thank you!
@20committee Could they also be prosecuted by some type of international judiciary for engaging in conspiracy to kidnap/extradite a foreign national?
@RepKevinYoder @SpeakerRyan Gentlemen, you are both M.O.R.O.N.S.  Please RESIGN immediately if not sooner.
@LawyerRogelio @HuffPostPol They actively foster the climate which will destroy them. I don't know how any woman employed there can continue to support such a company.
@KEBrightbill @IlhanMN @HomeschoolAnon @lovejoyfeminism The younger they are makes them easier to control. That is part of the appeal. Still about power &amp; control. Disgusting.
@CillizzaCNN We now know what a panel of pedophile supporters look like. Thx Chris!
@078Irish @beebecathy @ABC YAASSSSSS! AWESOME!
@Sams1stDaughter These statistics are seriously disturbing.
@JuddLegum @lauferlaw Yeah, I wonder if trump knows that pence is already trying to take his job?
@thehill FINALLY! THANK YOU @SpeakerRyan
@GOP WTF!?? You guys were decent at one point. https://t.co/lhitO70iwY
@thehill Ohhhh yeeeessssss!
@AmyMcGrathKY Can't wait!
@codykeenan @kalpenn What's happening? Sounds like the AMERICAN PEOPLE are making their voices heard!!!!
@ABC She must have a GREAT healthcare plan.
@CNNPolitics Soooo bombing their country would make it less hellish?? Must be something he learned at Wharton.
@GAD58 I met a republican last night who agreed gun reform is possible without destroying 2nd amendment. I was amazed.
@teemcee @NaijaMane @BarackObama I would be so tongue tied! Also probably melt into a puddle from sheer happiness &amp; awe. The BEST!
@NaijaMane @teemcee For just one day being called to jury duty was totally worth it. Would love to meet @BarackObama in person. He is the BEST!
@BoringEnormous @GAD58 Great way to start the day! Thanks!
@BrandonBesserer Yikes! Niiiice!
@teemcee At least he is no longer in a position of power where he can hurt others. A blessing considering all that's happening around us.
@teemcee I got nothing. I just don't get some people.
@teemcee I laughed
@teemcee @MatthewACherry At least look like you aren't enjoying it! He is such a creep!
@MatthewACherry @teemcee Dumb &amp; Dumber, you choose which is which.
@epmurphymn YAASSSSS! AMEN!
@ALT_uscis @BarackObama Absolutely still THE MAN! Love it!
@Pennny_Logan Awesome, thanks!
@RepJayapal @SenWhitehouse Did she attend Wharton with trump? Do they specialize in MORON degrees?
@lauferlaw They are not innocent or ignorant of what trump really is. Whatever you sow, in the end you will reap.
@AmyMcGrathKY Stunning pile of CRAP! It must be stopped.
@NBCNews You mean criminals like the 10 yr old girl with cerebral palsy detained 11 days after operation by ICE?
@traciemac_Bmore Karma is a beautiful thing!
@BettyBowers They are woefully out of touch, as is trump &amp; @GOP
@NBCNightlyNews No worries there. trump doesn't care about human rights there or anywhere else.
@Newsweek Obstruction much?
@thehill New treason response:	MY MEMORY HAS BEEN REFRESHED.
@MollyJongFast @ALT_uscis Maybe @LindseyGrahamSC can eat his while golfing with trump.
@tedlieu @SarahPalinUSA Sarah who?
@traciemac_Bmore He meant to say #Winning
@GAD58 Another one bites the dust.
@MuslimMarine I am happily BLUE, BLUE, BLUE today! Hopeful for our future!
@MSNBC Wave, hell! More like a tsunami!
@JamesMartinSJ A good reminder, thanks.
@alexandraerin @beebecathy What else would we expect from such a 'great businessman, the best negotiator'??
@PreetBharara @lauferlaw YAASSSSSSS! Should apply to ALL levels of govt.
@AP_Politics Hey @GOP what about all those Russian orphans donnie jr was so concerned about? No tax credit for adoptions? Whaaaaat?!
@ABC One less chance for him to embarrass the U.S.
@waltshaub @RWPUSA Godspeed, sir!
@teemcee @KristenClarkeJD I agree. I am feeling more hopeful than I have in a LONG time.
@KristenClarkeJD @teemcee Might be a light at the end of this tunnel after all!
@DouxDux @lauferlaw @CORLEBRA777 @counterchekist meth addiction most likely
@sunchips10 If only!!
@WilDonnelly @tamarabrock ACLU- bet they would love to sink their teeth into that one.
@SenDeanHeller Sponsored by you &amp; the NRA. Blood is on @GOP
All victims &amp; their families should forward all medical &amp; funeral expenses to the NRA. They seem to be in control of gun laws (or lack of), they should pay the price. https://t.co/8VBYvQUdkd
@roblee4 Amen sir! Just quoted 1 of my favorite verses!
@lauferlaw me 2
@LouiseMensch @dcherring @DrDenaGrayson @kelly2277 @lulu_lemew @GiddyHeyde @KiernanKathleen @PluckyQ416 @fairchild01 @MsMariaT @SaysDana @cindycrum @t_pletch @karolcummins @taxvictim @ninaandtito @dcpoll @mopeng @emzorbit @alexandraerin @Holly_not_Dolly @MelissaJPeltier @MrsSmh1 @WendySiegelman @LonepineRjr @Klickedy @jonigeographer @ShannonBrooke01 @traciemac_Bmore @Blue_State_Kate @Jodi______ @SecretaryAcosta @AlanDersh @realDonaldTrump You give hope for an eventual return to civility of some sort.
@RepCohen Go natural! Quit coloring my gray a year ago. I find it incredibly liberating! #baldisbeautiful
@BettyBowers I didn't know it even existed. Did he shoot it himself of himself on his phone?
@FoxNews @GovMikeHuckabee @TheDemocrats Republicans HAVEN'T moved past Clintons yet.
@45MUSTGO @peter_w_smith @LiberalLecter @YanksFan70 @HillaryClinton Poor Zinger!
@45MUSTGO @peter_w_smith @LiberalLecter @YanksFan70 @HillaryClinton Just wrong to insult food in this way. However, it does bear a striking resemblance.
@ABCPolitics @beebecathy Let's go ahead &amp; apply this concept to our ENTIRE GOVERNMENT NATIONWIDE, immediately if not sooner!
@teemcee coo coo ka choo
@teemcee WTF?! I mean, really?
@lauferlaw Does that include judicial nominees? Hope so.
@GinaForAustin Can it be stopped?
@JacksonLeeTX18 They should have to provide significant wage increases for non management employees &amp; GOOD health insurance if cuts are given.
@lauferlaw @pacelattin @RepMattGaetz Cmon, Lurch was waaay better looking!
@counterchekist Odd, very.
@PolitiFact She continues to prove her ignorance daily. She is consistent.
@chefjoseandres @USCG @WCKitchen @ChefJenHerrera @ChefVentura Thank you for doing what OUR GOVERNMENT should be doing! GOD sees all, many blessings!
@TheGoodGodAbove @ALT_uscis KARMAAAAAAA!
@Slate Scary
@Newsweek Nice shade! Thank you Japan!
@Pinche_Pi hahahahahahahahahahahahah SO STUPID hahahahahahahahahahaha
@talkaboutit84 @Slate Seriously? Wouldn't he be 110 or so IF still alive? Ignorance really is bliss, I guess.
@TheRickWilson Interesting timing on all of it.
@CBSNews Before his assets are frozen?
@Alt_Spicerlies @lauferlaw @realDonaldTrump LORDY!!!
@talkaboutit84 @funder Pairs nicely with treason.
@funder @talkaboutit84 I like the word convicted, has a nice ring to it.
@lauferlaw @Pinche_Pi Or anything else.
@kelly2277 @realDonaldTrump @garyplayer @POTUS Certainly seems to be a handicap.
@GAD58 He is suffering from Twitter Finger - sprains from frantic typing.
@MuslimIQ Beautiful!
@CNNPolitics of course he does
@lauferlaw Which includes death in some cases, correct? Asking for a friend.
@KeithOlbermann Carnival huckster more like it.
@ALT_uscis Suspicious, no?
@JonathanPieNews @beebecathy OUCH!
@RexHuppke @chicagotribune Too bad 'fake' climate change doesn't curb our need to eat like we are hibernating for the winter.
@MuslimIQ Does Charlotesville, VA count?? Asking for a friend.
@LawyerRogelio Can I get a hallelujah &amp; an AMEN?!!
@Liberal_Dream @realDonaldTrump GREAT IDEA!
@knowledgevendor It's the coke.
@nypost Sooo:	1. Sex with 18 yr old	2. Sex in police van	3. Sex in cuffs	NOPE NOTHING WRONG HERE!
@CharlesMBlow She's fired!
@CharlesMBlow @talkaboutit84 She absolutely lacks ANY basic moral character.
@gettinnoticedmo @talkaboutit84 OH YEAH, BABY!! WOOOOOOHOOOOOOO!!!
@20committee Lochness monster be my bet.
@ALT_uscis Does that amount get them fries &amp; a shake with that Nothingburger???
@roblee4 Better the scar than the open, festering wound.
@wtfdoicare33 @talkaboutit84 @AshaRangappa_ YAASSSSSSS!
@Rschooley Can't wait for the fries &amp; a shake!
@jayrosen_nyu O-BLIT-ER-ATE!!! YOWSA!
@aliasvaughn @lauferlaw Scary, right? I thought I read it wrong the first time I saw it.
@LouiseMensch @RepSwalwell @democrats @GOP I can barely freakin breath! I may not live til tomorrow.
@counterchekist Nice.
@BrandonBesserer They will eventually be outnumbered.
@waltshaub Isn't it too late to strip his authority if not only indictments, but actual charges are being pursued? Not sure how that works.
@_ElizabethRB @IndivisibleTeam liar liar	pants on fire!
@RevChuckCurrie @realDonaldTrump Not it!
@realDonaldTrump Good morning! https://t.co/IKMo0B8UqN
@thehill Who dug her back up?
@PolitikMasFina Amen sister!
@BBCWorld What an EFFING idiot! It isn't about looks, it is about power over someone.
@waltshaub HILARIOUS! I wonder if their lips pulled back from their teeth? AWESOME!!
@CBSEveningNews @WhitefishEnergy FFS, this is CORRUPTION! CALL IT WHAT IT IS!!
@LawyerRogelio YAASSSSSS!!
@amvetsupport OOOH, that's a good one!
@BlondeinKevlar @ABC AAAAAAMEN!
@GAD58 @MSNBC Most definitely lying.
@MattStout07 First flattering photo of her to date, my opinion.
@GAD58 @realDonaldTrump Agonizingly accurate analogy.
@BrianKarem I am trying NOT to get a visual. Gross.
@CillizzaCNN Love fest? Super gross!
Anybody willing to LIE for trump can be @PressSec https://t.co/M62vqp0GGY
@Aetius3 @talkaboutit84 Whatever it is, won't be good. Disconnect b4 it's 2 late.
@kelly2277 Still trying to take the oil some in America feel entitled to.
@BettyBowers That's less than $100 a week. Ludacris!
@tedlieu @beebecathy @realDonaldTrump Why lie about anything.
@Perry_OB YAASSSSS! NICE ONE!
@JamesMartinSJ @RevChuckCurrie I can't wait to hear what Catholics think about this.
@_cbackus @realDonaldTrump This idea I like.
@CNN He has his phone.
@waltshaub Smells bad.
@DanRather It's like you can't really breathe.
@LawyerRogelio Fucked you, would be more appropriate term.
@nowthisnews From the mouths of babes...
@signalfire6 @TrueFactsStated True that, in their eyes that would be 3 strikes.
@bradheath @ACLU Did you record it? They have a tendency to back pedal, you know, LIE.
@TrueFactsStated Do you think that's why he acted the way he did on her initial visit? He wouldn't look at her or shake her hand &amp; the look on his face! Maybe she called him out privately?
@Goss30Goss Thx for being true patriot, one who serves ALL.
@MichaelGaree Already boycotting, just in case.
@MichaelGaree 80% beef, at least. They might hire him.
@MichaelGaree Ugh
@CNN Possible incarceration isn't really a job benefit.
@IvankaTrump You do realize that is less than $100 a week? Do you pay someone to do your math for you?
@ALT_uscis He sounds ignorant.
@dumptrump33 I am ready for my closeup Mr. Demille
@ALT_uscis He sounds like a stammering idiot
@teemcee Sadly, we can expect nothing more.
