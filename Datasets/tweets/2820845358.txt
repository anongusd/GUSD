@NewCriticalMess @MsAvaArmstrong I'd like to say I have the answer, @NewCriticalMess!   I've now become aware of the the details of our nation's immigrant population problem generated by Obama.
@MsAvaArmstrong How were muslim enclaves allowed to spread in the USA?  I'm not talking LEGAL IMMIGRATION.  I'm talking muslim neighborhoods that REFUSE TO ASSIMILATE, speak English/socialize with Americans.  Supplants our culture/constitution. It's an invasion in my opinion.
@MsAvaArmstrong does that protect each state against Islamic Invasion, like in Dearborn, MI?  I'm serious.
