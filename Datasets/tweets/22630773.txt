@SecPompeo An unmistakable and extremely strong response is obligatory.  We are not Crimea.  Russia's was an aggressive act of war. Make no mistake about it.  It is time to have the @USNavy become involved in Crimea, Ukrania, and Georgia until Russia has abandoned it's aggressive takeovers.
@DanRather Great point!  Here is the underlying problem:  When the US determined to spread Democracy around the world, they did not use our "original", "literal" Constitution as the template.  Rather, they used the modern, adulterated version, thereby, creating Global Socialism (Marxism).

@LouDobbs @Mediaite Trump is obviously challenging the Patriots to stop him from abusing his power or submit to his brand of Nationalism.  It is nothing short of disgusting that Trump would drag the whole nation through his vitriolic and vulgar attacks against officials and citizens alike.
@jimsciutto How would Trump know if he had never heard the tape?  I heard that it was horrific and real, also, from a reliable source (...not Trump).
Donald Trump is daring anyone to challenge his abuse of power or submit to his brand of Nationalism.  His latest example is his obviously-intentional mis-spelling of Mr. Schiff's name. It is disgustingly unprofessional. Moreover, it is technically an un-Constitutional act of war.

@ChrisCuomo Kudos to CNN and the supporting media outlets for their swift and sure response to that injustice.  As a former news professional, I knew that Jim Acosta was simply doing the job which the people needed for him to do.  Trump behaved like a Nationalist, true to form.
@realDonaldTrump Personal vineyard profits are not the jurisdiction of the Presidency.  Not enough people drink wine to make it mandatory.  Please, drop this obvious play at making a small fortune for yourself.  It would not have a significant impact on the economy.
@chucktodd I like your show.  However, temporary, contract, and part-time jobs do not create a strong economy.  What percentage, therefore, of "permanent full-time jobs" have, actually, been created under Trump?  They, alone, indicate a genuinely strong economy.
@JeffreyToobin  2-Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a self-proclaimed "Socialist".  Karl Marx outlined the destruction of Democracy in four stages:  Socialism, Communism, Fascism, and Nationalism, the ultimate objective being Global Nationalism (the German acronym is "NAZI"-ism).
@JeffreyToobin With all due respect for your professionalism, no two words have an identical meaning and "Patriot" does not = "Nationalist".  According to Karl Marx, who defined Nationalism, a Nationalist adheres to a centralized global government. Hitler declared the HQ Germany.

Frankly, had the bombing not been an undercover government ruse, the purported bomber would not have been sauntering out of the building with the government following him.  He would have been chained, wrists and ankles, as he walked with them by his side, in front, and behind.

PART NINE:  The answer is floating among the liberal interpretations, loopholes, statutes of limitations, and other technical ( = ) unconstitutionalities which have creeped into our system throughout the past twenty-four decades ...(CONTINUED)
PART EIGHT:  How have we deviated so far from our Constitution that, had such been in effect during WWII, Hitler could have won his war against America simply by obeying our laws and a modern, well-educated Supreme Court Justice does not even know who “The People” are?  (CONT'D)

@realDonaldTrump If that which Secretary Mattis has stated is true, then, Woodward was deliberately "set-up for a loss" with inaccurate information as soon as they saw him coming.  As a professional newswoman investigating the government, I have seen such before.  Trump's group is behind it.
That is putting it mildly.  "Treasonous" is closer to the truth of it. https://t.co/TNY5P1RR3L

@realDonaldTrump Donald, I have a question for you...  What is in those documents?  What are you attempting to hide, now??  If it is nothing, then, release the documents, immediately.  Otherwise, you appear to be as guilty (of something) as sin, itself.  THAT is the reason for their objections.
@realDonaldTrump Fascinating!  Why is it that John Kelly's statement sounds, in effect, "identical" to everyone else's statement emanating from within the Trump Administration?  Arm-twisting??  In longer than six decades, I had neither seen nor heard such identically-scripted WH messaging.
@The_Trump_Train Quite the opposite, actually.  It is the first time I have respected Nike since they were found to be underpaying their employees in China ..and only because Nike "purportedly" corrected that problem.
@LouDobbs I do not believe that it is an either/or matter.  There is money to be made on both sides of the issue.  Maybe, just maybe, they were finally standing up for the right to protest.
@MiaFarrow Speak out!  Call CNN and ask to be interviewed on air.  You have that sort of power.  Now, is the time to use it ...if you can withstand Donald Trump's reaction.  Good luck, Mia!  We will support your efforts to correct the world's wrongs.  Do it for the little guy with no voice.

PART THIRTY-ONE:  The problem was exacerbated in January of 1990, when Congress passed, G.W.H.Bush signed, and SCOTUS, later, approved a United Nations Resolution which "...grants authority to any person or group, (CONTINUED)
PART THIRTY:  The problem began with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which grants foreign authority over American Law, even in America.  		 (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-NINE:  4. Condoleeza Rice, while Secretary of State, referred to the United States of America as a "Member State" of the United Nations, rather than as a "Sovereign Nation", "Independent Nation", or even as a "Nation".  (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-EIGHT:  Again... unfortunately, "The International Order" ineffectuates our Constitutionally-mandated Sovereignty, rendering us merely as a Member State of an "International Order", rather than an "Independent" Nation in it's own right. (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-SEVEN:  ...wherein, Barack Obama "hands off the baton" of "The International Order" to Donald Trump so that he could complete the institutionalization of "The International Order" throughout America and the World; a project which Mr. Trump takes extremely seriously!
PART TWENTY-SIX:  Reference, if you will, please, his welcome letter to Donald Trump when Donald Trump first entered The White House ...the letter which Mr. Trump neglected to read to us until months later, (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-FIVE:  3. When Barack Obama entered the White House, he gave a speech in India (Text of Speech in India, Barack Obama, February 2010) during which he first called "International Government", the "International Order". (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-FOUR:  2. In 2002, Nicholas Sarkozy, President of France, gave a speech in the United Nations wherein he promoted "The New World Order" (C-Span 2002, United Nations Speech, Nicholas Sarkozy, "The New World Order"). (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-THREE:  Within one month of Mr. Bush's United Nations speech, he and the Congress began calling The New World Order, "International Government", then, several years later, "Global Economy".	(CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-TWO:  in January 1990, just prior to Margaret Thatcher's unprecedented speech before the American Congress (until that day, no foreign dignitary had ever given a speech in the House of Representatives or the Senate. (CONTINUED)
PART TWENTY-ONE:  1. With regard to the reference which I made to The New World Order, George Herbert Walker Bush, during his speech before the United Nations in January 1990 (C-Span Archives, GHWBush United Nations Speech, January 1990) was promoting the "New World Order" (CT'D)
PART TWENTY:  Recall: It took Hitler a mere three (3) years to completely adulterate the good Christian community of Germany into a massive Nazi-istic killing machine.  (CONTINUED)
PART NINETEEN:  in decades past; rather, The International Order is GLOBAL MARXISM, the culmination of which, therefore, is GLOBAL NAZI-ISM (Karl Marx) ...as in "That is not a request. Rather, that is an "Order!""  (CONTINUED)
PART EIGHTEEN:  (without so much as properly informing the good People of the United States of America by way of the news media).		Congress MUST NOT continue on it's current track. The International Order is not "American Democracy On Wheels", as has been regularly implied CT'D)
PART SEVENTEEN:  As such, please, ask Anderson Cooper, Chris Cuomo, et caetera, to more carefully examine "The Rule of Law" and to take our Congress to task for sneaking this hideous British system into our own governing system (CONTINUED)
PART SIXTEEN: Third, given that most laws under The Rule of Law tend to be of a more extreme nature in an attempt to resolve terroristic activity, et alii, such laws are generally unnecessarily deadly (overkill), killing large numbers of innocent victims, id est: children. (CT'D)
PART FIFTEEN:  As such, corruption is rampant in Washington. Moreover, since it's inception, no such "Rule of Law" (temporary unconstitutional law) has ever been challenged within any American Court of Law, increasing the number of permanently unconstitutional laws on our books.
PART FOURTEEN:  yet the International Order (New World Order/Hitler's "The New Order"/Mein Kampf [Time/Life Books: The New Order]) allows violations of our Constitution by way of foreign authority, including their extreme lobbying efforts in Washington. (CONTINUED)
PART THIRTEEN:  Second, it is important to note that the International Order is literally unconstitutional, given that the Sovereignty of the United States of America is mandated by the Constitution ("...Independence of the United States..."),  (CONTINUED)
PART TWELVE:  (including The Golden Rule by way of "...the Year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty seven...").	(CONTINUED)
PART ELEVEN:  already, and does not need any such "Rule of Law" in case(s) of emergency, given that it's simple, basic construct is thorough, addressing any and all possible emergencies without needing to violate it's blessed parameters (CONTINUED)
PART TEN:  however, nothing could be further from the truth and the consequences are seriously problematic unto deadly.		First, it is important to note that the original, literal United States Constitution, unlike the British Constitution, is literally flawless as signed,(CONT'D)
PART NINE:  would immediately adopt this British system for themselves ...following which, Congress did precisely that. Three decades have passed, since, and the people have come to accept that "the rule of law" means the same as the Constitution; (CONTINUED)
PART EIGHT:  did not sufficiently address every potential emergency. Her hope was that our American Congress, and every nation of the world, in keeping with the encroaching "New Word Order" (now, being called the "International Order"), (CONTINUED)
PART SEVEN:  it is to, then, be removed; otherwise, it is to become permanent law.		The reason for which Prime Minister Thatcher was promoting The Rule of Law to our Congress was that the British Constitution, being relatively new,  (CONTINUED)
PART SIX:  in order to determine whether or not the law was constitutional or unconstitutional, the while. If the law is, then, deemed unconstitutional, with no guarantee that such a law will ever be brought up for review before the Court, (CONTINUED)
PART FIVE:  As Margaret Thatcher described "The Rule of Law" (paraphrasing): "The Rule of Law" is a British Law which permits the British Parliament to pass ANY law in an emergency with that law subject to consideration by the Courts, only after the emergency has passed,(CONT'D)
PART FOUR:  wherein, she describes "The Rule of Law" and recommends that the United States of America adopt the concept into it's own legal system.  (CONTINUED)
PART THREE: Rather, "The Rule of Law" was introduced to our Congress, during an unprecedented speech to Congress by a foreign (British) dignitary, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in January 1990 (C-Span  Archives, January 1990, Margaret Thatcher/Congress/Rule of Law), (CT'D)
PART TWO:  The fact remains that The Rule of Law is not a benign statement meaning that 'the law (Constitutional Law) is the rule,' as myriad politicians and news journalists have been implying, since it's inception.  (CONTINUED)
Good morning, everyone!		I just sent the following letter to CNN:		Anderson Cooper, among others, was referencing "The Rule of Law" within his report, recently. Given that "The Rule of Law" is extremely specific, clarification of it's meaning and intent is essential:  (continued)

#WhereisMelania  Melania, it is not idle curiosity which leads us to ask where you are.  Rather, it is that we do not even know that you are conscious ...and we care and are concerned.  Donald's refusal to show a close-up of you in real time with real witnesses is disturbing.

That which is "unessential" is unnecessary. As such, in this respect as well, the Rule of Law is un-Const & must be expurgated, immediately.
Our Congresses have had 233 years to plan for all possible emergencies & to pass all necessary Amendments;  the Rule of Law is unessential.
However, the word "supreme" = "insurmountable; can not be over-ridden". The Constitution is "Supreme Law", thus, the Rule of Law is un-Const
As I have mentioned in prior posts, the Rule of Law was adopted from the British. Margaret Thatcher sang it's praises to Congress (C-Span).
the Rule of Law is a specific law which grants the President the "right", albeit un-Constitutionally, to pass "emergency" laws ("measures").

Your sincere, positive, and pure system of communication is wonderful.  I have not had enough time to read everything. Bear with me, please.
The sponsorships are a blessing;as it turns out, they are all which certain Gov officials have respected, although I know not why. Thank you
We can "get there from here" IF we do not give up or give in.It is our greatest strength to be correct & devoted to a Constitutional America
Many improvements are obvious, many not so obvious to most.  Nevertheless, I am noticing them ...all around.  Thank you!  Awesome!!!
We can always tend to those later, if they remain an issue.
Other than those tasks which I stated, this morning, if you need to drop something in order to handle the larger issues, feel free.
One of our most vital national security issues is researching to learn who the persons in control ($) of The New World Order actually are.
When C is finally able to hear the information which they so desperately need, most of A's workload will be eased to it's normal state.
When I ask A to handle a task, I expect A to delegate as much as feasible, freeing him for the complex task of strategy and supervision.
Know that each of you is a hero in the highest tradition ...of that you have a right to be proud, given that such pride is not arrogance.
In so doing, at the end of the day, no one can correctly fault you.
Given that not everyone has access, currently, to the document and, in some cases, to one another, trust your own instincts and do your best
The Declaration of Authority presents the program most appropriately, expounding upon the literal parameters of the Constitution.
Therefore, re-taking the "literally Constitutional" oath takes priority, followed by  expurgating all quasi-Constitutional laws, immediately
I issued no low priority tasks. Safety first. Lives second. National Security third. National Economic Security fourth. Economy/jobs fifth.
All of the Holy Angels are helping us, as well, to make America a glorious nation,  as designed, and the world a safer place for everyone.
Nevertheless, my gratitude is sincere.  Our Forefathers would be so very proud of you if they were here with us, now ...and helping!  Peace.
I am listening to you. And I understand. I do not know of an appropriate way to thank each specifically without endangering anyone, just now
Peace.

A: The Military must push for the win in Afghanistan. We are not to "give up", as Nixon did to South Viet Nam.  Again, "Golden Rule" it.
A/State: Teach Afghani's how to build their own nation.  They do not need our Military for such an operation.
A: Please, keep all nation-building efforts entirely separate from the responsibilities of the Military. Their true job is solely to fight.
Taking the men from Gitmo and placing them within the hands of the American "justice" system, frees the Military to "fight" to win.
Our Military is to handle the fighting, our courts to try those who violate US law(s), & our prisons to contain American prisoners.

A: The Government's system of Catch 22's is nearly complete.  1984 Room 101. If I were you, I would correct that, right now.
A:  And good luck!
A: Define the perfect human being. Make certain that he is literally "impossible" for DHS to ensnare with it's system & psycho-babble. Test.
So YOU can relax, now.
"liberal interpretation" does not mathematically equal (=) "literal definition".Upon issuance of the Const, it was "literal" (legal).
Rather, I depend upon the original, literal definitions of the words within our Forefathers' common lexicon [Library of Congress], because
I do not subscribe to the "liberal interpretations" plied as a tool to circumvent the Constitution as all US Attorneys are required to do.
I trust my team to do their best, as well.  If you care about America (the true United States of America), you are welcome to join us.
continuing to violate the literal parameters of our precious Constitution, more now than ever. I am doing my utmost to correct that problem.
Nevertheless, I am concerned about a number of serious issues, one of which is the fact that SCOTUS and the Congress are...
That which we can do to correct any given problem, we ought to do. More than that, one can not do ...so why worry?
I do my best to resolve the problems from wherever I am, with the limited resources which I have. I do not worry. Worry is wasteful.
I live in a relaxed state. When I see such horrors which must be addressed as I have witnessed in America (Ft Hood, Waco, etc)...
Maybe none of you has ever lived in prayer. Please, allow me to describe it. All prayer is pure and peaceful...otherwise it is not "prayer'.
My mood is just fine, thank you. I observe, I "speak freely". If you are not upset about some of these issues, you are not paying attention.
A: Does the Congress have access to the facts (=) which I have posted which pertain to them?  If not, please, see to it that they do, now.
It is time for some great music: http://bit.ly/3FKOrQ
A: And make certain that you are not cow-towing to Obama's fear of pointing any fingers at "Muslim". The Major was a Muslim. Fact (=).
A: Tell your military psychiatrists to keep their diagnoses and prognoses strictly by the book and mathematically accurate (=), for everyone
A: And how DARE the Major complain about the American system?!!  Oh, that is right... complaining is our Constitutional right, as well. ;)
I would rather invest my 100+ years in the flesh with God than with DHS, any day; not that I do love all of you. The system is UGLY, though.
That would not happen in a zillion years. Neither is it "legally" (literally Constitutionally) required of me.
It sounded as though you were recommending that I give up my devotion to God and Jesus in order to please DHS/OTeam. Are you joking?!!
@ginidietrich No doubt, Barack would LOVE that!
RT @andreajoycohen "Wishing you an amazing day of love, joy, inspiration, focus, connection, power, health and prosperity!"
A: If you need more "verbal ammunition" in this regard, you need only ask. Save AMERICA, Admiral!  Thank you.
A: In "God" We Trust ...Christian, Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, Hindu, et alii.  "our Lord", "God" and "Nature's God" (Constitution).
A: This applies to Israel as well as to America.
A/C: When secularism is used as a tool to rid a nation of the religious in power, it is time to expurgate all secularism from the system.
A: I have been in this "fight" for religious freedom within America for longer than 20 years. I know that of which I speak.
A: Instead, you might want to tell your psychiatrists to open The Holy Bible on occasion ...for knowledge.
A:And Barack attempting to convince anyone that the Major was not a home-grown terrorist is as destructive to truth-gathering as I have seen
A: They are supposed to be scientists (=), after all, if they are legitimate doctors.
A: Those military psychiatrists are out of their league when it comes to God. Show them my tape and have them mathematically (=) disprove it
A:  ...rather than part of the problem.
A: America has some extreme problems, right now, obviously. Please, make certain that you are part of the solution, ...
A: However, they, also, stated that the Major placed God above Country.  Well, who in his or her right mind would not?! Ask any Christian.
A: Now, if their objection is only that the Major was spouting his religious views at work, unasked, their objection is valid.
A: Rather, religious matters are, Constitutionally ("our Lord"), a matter of Freedom of Religion and, thus, between God and each individual.
A:So, please, tell your Miltary psychiatrists, as well as all others, that "religious" matters are not within their Const jurisdiction.
A:...and left-wing political pandering, whoa to every priest, nun, Conservative, and Christian Moderate who has ever dared to be religious.
A: And if the Government of the United States of America so categorizes every religious American, in the name of secular psychiatry...
We Americans who are religious, and there are millions of us yet, are ALL devoted to God before Country. It does not reflect mental illness.
According to the military psychiatrists, Hasan openly claimed to be a "Muslim first and American second." Hold on, right there....

A: You are aware that I am aware of the "official", yet, literally un-Const (thus, un-Const) visits to LegionsofAngels on i/vu, are you not?
@glennbeck Now, we have even made the soap operas.  DHS really does get around ...n'est ce pas? A
Thank you.  I miss you, also.  I am with you, constantly, meanwhile ...in prayer. God Bless America!  Keep the faith.

Wake up, America.  You are being taken for a long and disastrous "ride".  National/Socialism is that which it is ...Hitler or not.
Obama employs the same techniques in order to advance his own post-America global agenda, shifting the US Treasy to corp's/lands far away.
Of course, FDR said that it was a "necessary" emergency measure which was to last for 5 years, merely to hedge against a worse crisis.
We are, all, familiar with the fact that America is a Socialist nation, despite Obama's protestations that it is not; FDR even said so.

What happens to the people who fall through the cracks w/in our national/socialist nation? ie:"pre-virtual vicarious" terrorist want-to-be's
Those persons who fell through the cracks within Hitler's Nationa/Socialist Gov were sytematically utlized until useless, then, destroyed.
Hitler, also, provided excellent schooling for Germany's children ...at least those of pure Arian strain.
The gold teeth were melted down for currency. Nothing was wasted. Nothing.
The book, also, spoke of Hitler's government seizure of possessions. Piles of clothing, suitcases, jewelry, teeth...
It was that self-proclaimed Socialist, FDR, God bless his heart (closer to being a dictator than any man in American history, until now).
...so adopted the method themselves; which is the reason no judge in America has any idea what the Constitution really says, anymore.
in order to manipulate the understanding of the people of Germany, and that the United States Congr decided that it was a wonderful idea...

It was called "human resources".  We used to call our employing departments "Personnel". It was more personal. Now, Human Resources.
...to Auschwitz with the ashes of their loved ones and washing their quarters and clothing with soap made of the fats of their loved ones.

One Jew wrote of escaping through sewers.  Another wrote of medical experimentation under Hitler's "health care program" (regime).

Ave Maria http://bit.ly/Z8jjw Peace. Words work, if we simply speak up and out.  The truth shall overcome the lies.
Barack, do not bother to have your minions admonish me for invoking the memories of the victims of 9111. I have that right. You do not.
GOD bless the USA!  http://bit.ly/KVBeR
Time for some music....
A/C:  It is time to conjure up memories of our Forefathers, including our Founding Fathers.  Make them public. Not Federalism (un-Const).
A: I have said it. I expect you to act, properly (literally (=) Constitutionally), accordingly. Semper Fidelis, Ladies & Gentlemen. America!
...as is my right!
Your ability to live within the White House is hanging on a spider's thread, and you know it. Your actions are obvious, and I speak freely
Do not ask expect me to trust you, again, until you have earned my trust.
Barack, you asked me to calm The People down, by way of Ms. Pelosi, so I did. Then, you took advantage of my generosity by manipulating them
Happy Sabbath.  Say your prayers, Gentlemen, if prayer you value.  You will need God's blessings upon America, this day.
A:  I am a daughter of Charlemagne.  We do not lose!  This time, it is America which we are to rescue ...from the New World Order/Intnl Gov.
A/D/F/C/B/etc: If your issue with me is that I am effective, you can take it to the bank! The very heart and soul of America is at stake.
A/D/F/C/B/etc:  Please, re-read my earliest posts pertaining to the Constitution of the United States of America. Note the emphases w/ CAPS.
A/D/F/C/B/etc:  They provided no other legal method by which the Constitution can be altered.
A/D/F/C/B/etc: ...with the opportunity to amend the Constitution IF it is flawed ("amend" originally meant (=) "to mend a flaw").
A/D/F/C/B/etc: Socialism is, literally (=), the antithesis of The American Way established by our Forefathers, who provided us...

A/C:  Because, if we can not depend upon the Congress and the Navy to protect the "freedoms" of the American People, The People will.
A/C: If the Navy does not effectively protect the American people from this completely socialistic health care bill, expect massive boycott.
We, The People, do not want our health care choices to be controlled by the Government of the United States of America, now or ever. #tea
@GOP Did you hear the rousing cheer when Pelosi announced that the health care bill was passed? It was a PR "trick". Completely contrived.
(continued...A): literally means (=) ", this statement is complete, subject and predicate included."  &lt;== Period. It does not mean ", etc."
(continued...A): Such is illegal. Once again: The period ( . ) at the end of each sentence, throughout the history of the English language,
A: In case it has escaped your attention, the Congress is, daily, seeking ways to circumvent, over-ride, and under-mine our literal Const.

(continued...A):  Please, make certain that the Senate is not able to vote on the health care bill prior to completion...

A: How is it that you were not capable of preventing a vote on that health care bill in the House, yesterday, given that...

(continued...A):  ...and whose case is mathematically flawless (=). Until you are so prepared, the case is rigged by those who violate ...
A: Technically, the Navy ought to be providing an appropriate Navy Attorney who has re-taken his/her "literally Constitutional" oath...
We are not finished, yet. This time, please, give EACH Senator the facts. That they are not subjecting themselves to the bill is "hypocrisy"
America, I am sorry. We did our best, to date, to prevent passage of that ugly "health care" bill in your House of "Representatives". #tea
@GOP Valiant effort! Now is a wonderful time to thank GOD that you will not be subject to that horrendous un-Constitutional "health system".
Happy Sabbath, everyone!
A: Thank you, General Casey.  We are with you, Sir.  If you need anything, please, do not be afraid to ask for it.
Some important truths were handed down through the generations in our family. I did not learn them in school. Our family knows them.
So... we educate.
It makes it easier to be forgiving.
Therefore, they are not to be blamed.  No one taught them, before.  We do not all possess an identical knowledge set.
On that note, imagine swimming speedily across a warm, peaceful, clean Pacific Ocean, with each stroke remembering "They do not know better"
And, as soon as I discovered that the news sites were on Twitter, I followed a number of them.  It saves time.

RT @GndCB @libertyideals @Maddow: "There is no preamble to the Constitution http://bit.ly/uBKpM" A lesson which I trust she will remember.
A: The Health Care Bill is littered with un-Constitutional words/statements.  As such, the Congress ought not to even be voting on it.
Once I became familiar with Twitter, a world of possibilities, then, became evident, including the power to communicate, learn, and educate
Discretion is the better part of valor. History is on the side of our American Forefathers.
And telling Congress that they must obey the literal Const (inclusive, naturally) appears to fall upon deaf ears without Naval "support".
For instance, telling Ms. Waters to vote against the health care fiasco is a waste of time before teaching her why she does not want it.
Until each Congressman/woman understands the "basics", protestations are relatively useless unless the protestors teach truths the while.
No, I joined to learn how Congressmen/women truly feel.Nevertheless, such protests are a great use of Twitter.Thank you for your dedication!
Another day in Paradise.
A/D: Clean it up, now. The literal Constitution is The Law. Anything outside of it's boundaries, punctuation included, is un-Constitutional.
A: I have been witnessing some of D's prompts.It is good that I am conservative, rather than an unwitting participant in D's military "game"
A: Please, look into D's activities leading up to the tragedy at Fort Hood. At least some of their policies need to be eliminated/corrected.
I am wondering: Had DHS not "prompted" the Major, would our soldiers not, still, be healthy, happy, and celebrating their graduation.
...you do not know the half of it.  Thank you for caring.
At any given moment, entering into wholesome communication (Holy communion) with God (prayer) is a blessing.
Thank you, George.  We appreciate that you travelled to Fort Hood.

It is a lesson which is to never be forgotten: The literal Constitution of the United States of America (inclusive) is the Supreme Law.

@stevebruskCNN We do not want him to add more to the Bill, we want him to scale it back so that it is affordable and does not deny freedoms.
@Killerwhale52 You are correct. Please, inform DHS.
Brilliant. Please, trust that our prayers are with you. Even so, God needs for us, each, to do our part to bring his dream to fruition.

A: Until Congress begins the process of expurgating all such UN Resolutions, Congress is violating the literal Constitution, inclusive.
A: Even so, we need, yet, to expurgate the United Nations Resolutions which ineffectuated American Sovereignty.
A: I legally rescued America's Sovereignty in 1990, within 2 weeks of Bush Sr. having signed it away, by way of the Declaration of Authority
A: Without sovereignty, "America" does not exist.
A: We have always lived within a global community.  America was designed to be a Sovereign nation ("Independence").
A: As I have stated on more than one occasion, the majority may rule solely w/in the literal parameters of the original Const, inclusive.
A: It is a new day. Nevertheless, the literal parameters of the original Constitution, inclusive, are the LAW; Congr. may amend any flaw(s).
A: Barack's bottom-line argument appears to be that this is a new day, majority rules by tradition, and we live within a global community.
A: The most obvious indication is that Congr is attempting to pass a 2,000+ page un-Const Bill, at which our Forefathers would have scoffed.
A:Our first indication that the Congr has not ceased violating the literal parameters of the Constitution is that they took an un-Const oath
A: My "work" is convincing Congress to cease violating the literal parameters of the Constitution. They have not done so, to date.

A: It is clear that DHS/OTeam are afraid that I will incite Christians to physically harm American Muslims. Never unnecessarily.

A: For the record... Via Dolorosa ("our Lord" ...Constitution of the United States of America) http://bit.ly/CYKao
A: Thus, according to the original, literal Constitution as signed by our Forefathers, the Declaration of Independence is Supreme Law.
A: The Declaration of Independence, a legal Amer. document, was signed by our Founding Fathers, thereby, becoming an "Engagement" (Const.).
A: The Declaration of Independence states, "the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them".
A: By the way, please, tell the imvu gang that i love their wings, however, if they are not sincere, they are disrespecting the Holy Angels.
A: Within the true United States of America, the Declaration of Independence will never be illegal ...not one word, not one statement, etc.
A: So, if necessary, I shall begin again. Please, accept my heart-felt apology for repetitions which ought not to be necessary.
A: I did not want to be forced into such a position as to pull rank, however,"God" (DoI) outranks all of us, all atheists notwithstanding.

A: all of which was literally Constitutional on the day our Forefathers signed our precious Constitution, despite Obama's unfounded fears.
A: Again, it is political and ego-driven ...absolutely nothing else. I am a Benjamin Franklin small-r republican ultra-conservative...
A: Consider how impossibly long the list is with regard to any one human being.  The fact (=) is they do not KNOW. Thus, they try & discard.
A: List each & every charge and/or hypothesis which was expressed about me, to date, by DHS, FBI, NSA, et caetera, whether true or untrue.
A:Please, distribute the statement, to each involved department, of the number of times "Angel", etc, is stated w/in The Holy Bible (Const.)
4. My, my. Not to disrespect your integrity, however, which of you has ever seen a mathematical proof of a theory, or studied the lit Const?

RT @lizarddawg "...Obama can do anything he wants to our nation and the Pentagon will sit on its hind end and allow it." I am concerned.
A: Christian soldiers, if one listens closely & objectively to the song, are "standing firm" for Jesus, despite opposition; The Golden Rule.
A:  You can Constitutionally ignore the rest ...and have no legal alternative.  Do not allow D's fears of "Christian Soldiers" frighten you.
A:  Make certain that they provide you with mathematical proof which you can read and understand, for each and every step and statement.
A: I find that interesting... not a single one of my posts was literally un-Constitutional.  Why the preparedness against me? America!
C/A: It is time to root out the enemy within... national/socialism, and every other law/resolution which is not 100% literally Const. #tea

Strictly, the literal Ten Commandments (God is "worthy"), to be superceded, solely, by The Golden Rule. The Torah contradicts itself.

Although, granted, mankind has tampered with the Holy Scriptures to such an extent that The Holy Bible contains a number of untruths.
That does not mean that He does not exist.
Even God is subject to the Law of Cause and Effect, or He could not have "seen" that which He purportedly created.
...given that all neutralities are, technically (=), positivities (+) because, in and of themselves, they do not create any friction.
Atheists: Consider the inviolable Law of Cause and Effect, which functions solely in relation to positivities (+) and negativities (-), ...
Moreover, God is not un-Constitutional ...which you will come to know by reading the Declaration of Independence & the original Constitution
"I never leave God behind. He is with me wherever I am."
For those among you who believe that I need to "leave God out of the equation" when speaking about law and politics, I say...
"Permanent Wholesomeness" IS "Holiness".
Please, keep agents G-rated, anyway ...for as long as their agencies are active. The Constitution is wholesome.
Re: avatar. If i can create a family-friendly space for cyber-convers. & other wholesome activities, I will. Please, keep agents g-rated.
Now, I have nothing against business moguls, either. I am a devoted capitalist.  However, the Govt is to be run by The People, not business.
The 2 greatest problems w/ this appear to be that the Govt is, now, employing a mass of people & the bureaucracy is lucrative to moguls.
...for a GOOD reason.
Nevertheless, despite any/every one's believed desires, the literal parameters of the Constitution of the United States of America are LAW.
Today, as a direct consequence of that "tiny little" violation of the Constitution ("the term", singular), 98.5+% of our laws are un-Const.
For instance, George Washington was wildly popular, not unlike Barack Obama, in his day. He was to serve for 2 years, only. They WANTED him.
Once the literal parameters of the Constitution are violated, even by the tiniest usurpation, all Constitutional fail-safes cease to exist.
When I say "genuine American", I refer to those who cherish our Forefathers and the principles for which they fought and died.
And we do not hand them "the keys to the store" outside of the literal parameters of the Constitution ...if we care about "America". #tea
It is nothing personal, as far as I am concerned. People who are not fully educated can err, so we forgive. Yet, forgiving is not condoning.
So, you see, by his own choices, it is, either, impossible or nearly impossible for "Kevin" to legally serve as a President of America.
Of course, he would need to take the literally Constitutional oath and abide by the literal Constitution if he were to win such a campaign.
...he could run for office AFTER American Sovereignty is fully restored & all quasi-Constitutional laws are expurgated as un-Constitutional.
As such, if O had legally been born in Hawaii, as reported, and proved it to the satisfaction of ALL of the people, ...
...such time as American Sovereignty is legally restored and all quasi-Constitutional laws are expurgated.
Two, the Declaration of Authority of 1990 determined, for legal purposes, the President and Commander in Chief, until...
If so, how? One, where is his original Birth Certificate? A "genuine American" would not hide such original legal documents from the public.
Do you want me to help to save America while allowing O to remain in office?  That is how it sounds.
Some expressed concern that I was leaving "kevin" out of the equation. ANYone who knowingly violates the literal Constitution is "unlawful".
Happy Sabbath, everyone! "In my Father's house are many mansions." 	(John 14:2)
or meditate, as the case may be. :)
good night, everyone.  say your prayers...
one would think that with the hundreds of people on my case, that more than a handful would know me by now.  i pray ...all of the time.
@KatyinIndy it is none of their business.
@glennbeck from: #DavidReich "White House: Obama's Daughters will NOT be getting the H1N1 vaccination."   The effrontery!
A: Close dhs, please, and incorporate the fbi into a simple investigative unit of the State Department. No guns and no arrests. Militia can.
@TheLibertyTree I question it.  With whom are they speaking?  Themselves?
@RichardDParker the correct doctrine comes from God through fellowship with Him.
@judithbailey constantly. peace.
@FreedomRing sometimes, timing is everything.
The difference between "fact" & "opinion" is that fact invariably equates (=) whereas  opinions may or may not equate ("opine").
..WE are the Kings and Queens of America! Stand up. You are, at last, a FREE people. Do not cower before marxists and dictators! Speak out.
The United States of America was designed to be a sovereign nation; no less sovereign than Britain was to the King of England...
Once we permit any foreign person/group/entity to have authority over any American citizen(s) within America, we have lost "America".
For the remainder of us, it is the life-blood of America!
I know, thanks to the leftist win this campaign season, that most leftists do not care about anything so "trivial" as American Sovereignty.
...neither was it sovereign under the Bush or Clinton Administrations.
As such, technically (=), America is not sovereign ("independent") under the Obama Administration, ...
...enter your home and confiscate your weapons ...right now... without recourse in any court of law, including the World Court.
The United Nations Resolution (signed January 1990), which I had mentioned, grants any un-uniformed, armed foreigner the right to...
The Constitution, also, states the word "independence". Thus, American independence (sovereignty) is, at least twice, declared Supreme Law.
@Killerwhale52 They were loath to fight the British, however, the British began hanging/beating/burning & would not listen, so they fought!
get it in writing...
@svrgn_nation that is a fact.
Re: American Sovereignty, as I had previously stated, the Declaration of "Independence" was written solely to secure American Sovereignty.
I understand and appreciate your concern. However, until Congress and the SC take the "literally Constitutional" oath, they are "unlawful".
A: Please, remind our men and women that we will not be losing this fight.  Have faith.  God is with us.
It is a vital absolute truth that each approximation is based upon a min. of 1 inaccuracy, rendering each approximation technically untrue.
It is a vital absolute truth (=) that only that which equates (=) is true, whether or not anyone had ever lived long enough to symbolize it.
Good night, everyone!  If you are open-minded, say your prayers...
It has naught to do with Catholicism nor Presbyterianism, per se. God is God of all faiths, the Lord's Prayer more ancient than Judaism.
And at the top, it is Heavenly.
...Jacobs Ladder, with wide, low steps for ease, and graced with white roses, lilies, and Holy Angels to delight and comfort you.
The Constitution is grand.  It is akin to The Lord's Prayer.  From the outside, it speaks of evil and transgression. From within, it is...
You are Americans!  You do not need to be compartmentalized by lobbyists who are paid many dollars to convince you otherwise.
Just as d and it's operatives attempt to categorize their targets into tiny understandable boxes, so legislation has "boxed us in". Be free!
Thank you.
While you are reading & studying the original wording of the Constitution (sans "explanations"), as written, make no assumptions about it.
DC and members of ancillary organizations, please, read & study the original wording of the Constitution (sans "explanations"), as written.
@P0TUS All prayer functions completely within the parameters of The Golden Rule.  Otherwise, it is not actually "prayer".
@FreedomRing Our offl language is, in fact, English, per the wording, as intended.  Yet, arresting one for not speaking English is unethical
Second: The Constitution does not state that the government can not give gold and silver to The People of the United States of America.
...", this statement is COMPLETE, subject and predicate included." &lt;== Period.  In other words, ", that is ALL." &lt;== Period.  "Period."
First, it is critical to note that the period (.) at the end of any sentence, as I have stated before, literally (=) means...
A/F: For the protection of America, will you, please, make certain that everyone on this case is on the same page? Misinformation abounds.
...or the Law of Cause and Effect will kill us in it's effort to heal the world (that is for the pessimists among us).
@turntotheright Only optimists are realists; the inviolable Law of Cause and Effect will heal the world...as soon as we stop fighting it.
...yet, "live in the light", as Benjamin Franklin taught us.  People are inherently good (pure), rather than "inherently good and evil".
My Grand Mother had a nice way of lifting people... "When you expect the best of everyone, you bring out the best in everyone."
C/A: Bribing the Afghan government is not permissible.  Bribery is un-American.  Thank you. Congress' job is to legislate, not administrate.

C/(A): Do not fear scouring the internet, airwaves, hollywood, et alii.  The greatest profits were made with G-rated fare.

so many misconceptions.  no wonder dc is in such a state. begin with the truth, please.
(A) the previous.  Thank you.
Only that which equates (=) is true.  All of that which equates (=) is true.  Nothing which does not equate (=) is true.
...thus, "liberal interpretations". Each "liberal interpretation" is not a "literal definition". Only the "literal definition" equates (=).
None dare call it conspiracy ...except me!  They did not want to be frustrated awaiting Amendments which would never be...

F/D/(A): If you locate any scrupulously HONEST liberals (moderates =&gt; leftists), simply ask them to confirm or deny the previous statement.
A: All liberals (moderates =&gt; leftists) intentionally circumvent the literal parameters of the Constitution of the United States of America.
Finally, some Congr m/w are beginning to hear The People. They have, yet, to understand that ANY compromise of the lit.Const. is unConst.
A:Your "2-year program" is not designed to "begin in 2 years", is it? Such would be unacceptable. It must begin, now. You are 2nd in command

D/F/A/(C): Nice job in Texas and LA!  Very nice job.  Thank you!
f/(A): Please, make certain that the Congress receives all posts which are addressed specifically to them, past and present. It is important
C: You owe the Secularists nothing which they did not already have under a Christian nation, given that Jesus was not prejudiced.
C: Congress was legislating Jesus and God out of our schools, government buildings, public squares, et caetera. It is time to choose, now.
C: (Matth.10:32) "Whosoever, therefore, shall confess me before men, him will I confess, also, before my Father who is in Heaven." #tea #chr
C: For the Christians among you, now is the time to remember the quote w/in the Holy Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Chapter 10, Verse 32
C/(A/N): Keep the Govt out of the public media, please. It is unseemly for oplants to be infiltrating "Freedom of the Press/Speech" sites.
@Kennedy_School are you certain that you are a harvard graduate?  this does not sound like anything which harvard would condone.
@Bconsdr8 That is a constant with me. Thank you for your words of wisdom. Peace.
Good night, everyone! Pleasant dreams. (Remember to say your prayers ...if you pray.)
Simply be observant. If the person intends to make a move, you will see it coming on time...
You do understand, I trust by now, that we are supposed to be making our Forefathers PROUD of us ...n'est ce pas? Sacred Honor.
So, you watched a man for 10 years, baiting, baiting, baiting, until, finally, one day, he uttered 5 fatal "words"; NO actions. Lame excuse.
A: Please, inform O/CIA that aiding/abetting Bin Laden is treason, unless the Gov formally/publicly retracts it's initial charge against him
@CeceSurfCityUsa I do not understand how they became so socialized either ...they must be younger than they appear!
It appears that most of our laws, now, match Britain's laws and are devolving to become increasingly like China's laws. We ought to know.

RT @PRMurphy147 "Under NO circustance, NO circumstances, DO NOT accept an alternative currency for ANY reason."
@Palinspired ...and it is that which matters!
@CeceSurfCityUsa they must be joking!

I will be no less active in the fight to rescue American Sovereignty from the New World Order than I have been for the past 20 years...
o has a political interest in knowing who is helping whom to end socialism (as literally un-Constitutional) in America. Meanwhile...
if i do not post your name, or thank you right away, it is solely in an effort to protect you and/or others from abuses by d or o.
to thank all of you, in advance, for your help in rescuing America from the increasing encroachm...ents of the International Government.
because, to this point, j has not ordered d to drop all of it's charges (although they have no "valid" case), i am taking this opportunity
A: Our Forefathers were familiar with Barristers/Lawyers and, intentionally, excluded them from the Constitution.
A: If his response is in support of the Rule of Law, take names, please. It equates (=).
AG: I am attempting to give you an opportunity to help us to rescue American Sovereignty. Please, accept my generous offer. No Rule of Law.
A: The position of AG does not Constitutionally exist (never "essential", therefore, un-Constitutional). Congress needs to READ the Bills!
A: Literally (=) Constitutional chain of command during war-time: President, Chief Admiral, etc. Cabinet/VP/SC/Congr have no command power.
@HouseFloor Can you, please, post which Bill, also? Thank you.
@svrgn_nation Thankfully, most liberals are not leftists. It had to become evident sooner or later ...preferably, before it is too late.
@denyreligion repentence and conversion do. otherwise, not entirely.
Did AG respond appropriately?
Amazing Grace ....in Cherokee. Beautiful! http://bit.ly/3v0Rf5
@CallMeExtreme I do wonder, at times :)
Immediately! Thank you.
@svrgn_nation There is one thing which the FCC can do which is proper... scour the airwaves, removing adult-themes and gratuitous violence.

@ConservativeGal What happened to Oprah's stance to not use her show as a political arena?
Always.
@loudobbsnews A mere 2 min. into the video is another statement that Obama plans to forward the N.American Union http://tinyurl.com/bzeovg
I was considering the possibility of the avatar's for educational purposes. What do you think?
When it is on the record, "lighter" is not always preferable to "accurate". My apologies for making anyone feel "criticized". :)
O: "So who do you hand it off to?" said one senior administration official." Therefore, we must trust the men/women who are "in the field".
O: 'Currently 11/1,000 residents in Afgh...If 40,000 sent, density ratio is only 12.5/1,000.' That would be nationwide. He asked for 1 area!
A: If you discover Obama conspiring w/ Al Qaeda and/or the Taliban, either directly or indirectly, to stall support, the charge is "treason"
