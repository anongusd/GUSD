@HannahAlOthman We all live with. It definitely sounds like as soon as he had a target identified in his head that Liam went looking for someone to hurt. What we don't know is what other questions he asked besides the one about race. I do think his point was about the anger. And the stupidity
@HannahAlOthman I'm a former 911 operator. No matter how much we don't want to see race is as obvious as the color of someone's shirt when we are envisioning a picture of someone. I don't think it's safe to assume that the question was consciously racist. Maybe part of that unconscious bias
