@PredictIt Sad!
Head on down to https://t.co/sp4aMlcKGQ and place your wager on third-way centrist Democrat Joe Biden!		Are Dems are eager to nominate another "Clinton" with 36 years of baggage in the Senate voting as a centrist. Iraq War, DOMA, NAFTA, "PATRIOT" Act, Wall St dereg?		@PredictIt https://t.co/Yy8neiRvib
Read more about the process here: https://t.co/hY7EqvKUUP		If you concur that it is almost impossible for a final indictment before 6/30 (or disagree and think it will happen for some reason) place wagers here on @PredictIt . YES is at 25% for some reason		https://t.co/3hURH8KDvk
With elections in April, Netanyahu's lawyers want to push a final decision off as long as possible. Additionally, if he is eventually convicted he is likely to be forced out as Prime Minister (if he still holds the post at that point). Delay, delay. @PredictIt
There is a market on @PredictIt for whether Netanyahu will be indicted by 6/30/19. The timeline makes it incredibly unlikely. It is theoretically possible for Netanyahu to waive the hearing and have a quicker decision but extremely unlikely. @PredictIt
The timeline is as follows: sometime in the next three to six months the hearing will be held. Another three to six months later the AG makes the final decision. That means May to August for the hearing and August to Feb 2020 for final decision barring major surprises @PredictIt
Netanyahu has the opportunity to have a hearing where he disputes the allegations and tries to convince the AG to cease pursuing the charges. After the hearing a final decision will be made on whether or not to formally indict Netanyahu @PredictIt
Meant to post this yesterday but..		Yesterday the Israeli AG announced his intent to indict PM @netanyahu on multiple charges. This is just an announcement of intent, not a final indictment or formal criminal charges. @PredictIt
@jipkin @PredictIt At least the people who have actually declared yeah
.@PredictIt I think it's time to add Jay Inslee, Tulsi, and Pete Buttigieg to the Democratic nomination market https://t.co/DkLMjmJloZ
@oscarjonesslc1 @Scavino45 @Andrews_JBA @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Sorry b3
What is the point of this Nate. What a hack. Yes, Cory Booker has the support from the entire Democratic establishment in New Jersey, and literally nowhere else. Go away! @PredictIt https://t.co/X8EMSmfLMj
@VoteOjeda2020 @ddiamond @RepCarolMiller PLEASE CHALLENGE SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO FOR SENATE IN 2020!
@DrRobertCollins Yeah I get initial confusion as it's not how it goes here. However, it's important to be correct. He has NOT been indicted. He gets a hearing to convince the AG NOT to indict him. It's not just a formality.		(A formality is if the AG has signed the papers but not filed them yet)
@iSavage_PI @PredictIt Sinema performed about the same as Beto. Yes, she beat HRC and flipped the state (good) but it was already a close state in 2016 (and is rapidly becoming blue). Most house candidates did better relative to HRC than "Taliban" Sinema.
@jipkin @PredictIt The list isn't intended to be perfect - the two statewide races in PA featured incumbents (Tom Wolf and Bob Casey) as did Virginia (Tim Kaine). The point however is that Beto was average compared to how much Democrats nationwide improved over Clinton
@jipkin @PredictIt These are listed in order from best overperformance to worst. PA was plus 15, Florida only plus one.
You guys should post an administrative comment that you're aware that AG has announced an intent to indict and if the indictment is made final before 6/30 the market resolves yes @PredictIt @WillJenningsDC https://t.co/BXnuv2gUsO
@PredictIt @rickhasen Alright, glad that you guys know that the indictment is pending a hearing. The odds of the hearing completing AND a decision to indict being made before June 30th are slim.
@DawgsOnTop44 @kkondik and they won by an average of 15points.. come on now
Why does the MSM seem to think Beto was a great candidate in TX?		His improvement over HRC in TX was exactly in line with the nat'l house vote swing despite facing Lyin' Ted Cruz (6.4% v 6.5%)		Also average next to PA, VA, MN, MI, AK, WI, IA, AZ, CO, ME, OH, GA, NV, FL	@PredictIt
@kkondik In what world is Pennsylvania a toss up while Michigan is a lean D? Wolf and Casey in PA won by 17 and 13 points respectively while Whitmer and Stabenow in MI won by 9.5 and 6.5? Pop growth is negative in PA outside of Philly metro and MI is negative everywhere (esp Detroit city)

@AG123321GA @PredictIt @WillJenningsDC on the desktop you can only see the Retweet, so it would only count once. if the retweet was after the start of the market it's the same issue as here.

Finally, a "total votes" market is always great. Traders disagree whether or not the timing and Hyde-Smith's statement will increase or depress turnout. Reasonable would be starting at "500k or fewer" and going up by 100k to "1M plus". As always, other ideas welcomed @PredictIt
Another idea for MS would be "number of counties that Hyde-Smith wins". Best to begin at "44 or fewer" and increase by fives to "70 or more." Doubtless this would be a fun market to predict who will have regional strength and can flip which counties. @PredictIt
This means, no way to predict whether her "public hanging" comments will have an impact on the results (good or bad) outside of predicting the unlikely Espy upset. And of course, there is no reason to think volumes will be anywhere near high enough to halt the engine @PredictIt
Some people think that Cindy Hyde-Smith will still win, but by a smaller margin than Roger Wicker or a typical Republican in Mississippi. Some think the margin will be even larger. There is currently no way to predict this. @PredictIt
Please remember that this is the last major election for the entire 2018 midterm season. There are a lot of traders on the site who still have money leftover from the midterms and are dying to put it on another election, especially as this one gains national attention @PredictIt
.@PredictIt reminder to please (asap) create a margin market for the Mississippi senate special election runoff. I would recommend beginning at 0-3% and going all the way up to 18+%. The election is on Tuesday so please create tomorrow or Monday.

@PoliticalKiwi A bad map could make it 14-12 or 15-11.	There's no equivalent huge red state but Missouri and Tennessee are close, being 6-2 and 7-2 respectively.	And then you have North Carolina being a purple state but the GOP controls the house 10-3.	#rigged
@PoliticalKiwi New York is very important. They lose a seat, but every seat outside of NYC/Westchester/Albany/Buffalo/Rochester is very slightly R. Includes Staten Island and the two outer LI seats. Small change there gains or loses many seats. And this is a huge D+20 state

How did Bernie Sanders win Vermont by 40% yet the GOP governor also won by double digits? Massachusetts? Maryland? Something fishy here. 		@mitchellvii
This is pure delusion. Anyone who doesn't see the strong blue trend in Texas, Georgia, and Arizona has their head in the sand. Colorado and Virginia are already lost causes for GOP.		The flip side is that Ohio and Iowa are slipping away from the Dems. https://t.co/uw3KtKhsqh

@Politihack00 @PredictIt GOP was only a ten point overperformance from having that happen. sounds like a smart trade, you just got unlucky
@PoliticalKiwi And yet the lesson that the Democratic party will learn is to run boring centrists
Markets needed from @PredictIt  now I that you have volume calmed down.		Arizona MOV (you need very tight brackets between 0-0.3% up to 2% or more or something)		Arizona total senate vote		National house popular vote		National house popular vote margin		Florida sen MOV (0-0.1%+)
@jipkin @PredictIt @538 All things equal if you had told me Van Drew only won by six points in NJ-2 I would have told you NJ-3, NJ-7, and NJ-11 were lost causes. But they weren't.
@jipkin @PredictIt @538 It shouldn't have. At the same time we had Amy McGrath running as expected in suburban KY-6		Overall though, Republicans outperformed in rural areas and underperformed in suburbs and cities. The single most certain Dem pickup (rural South Jersey NJ-2) was only six points
@jipkin @PredictIt @538 A large part I think was Donnelly's big loss early on. It really set the stage for "maybe it is a red wave (it wasn't)"

@AngieBaby1212 @PredictIt @Edsall @jipkin @ndstraut i'm not a democrat. i don't care. you are completely delusional.
@AngieBaby1212 @PredictIt @Edsall @jipkin @ndstraut bro what are you talking about the GOP got wiped out in the house and so far are at 52 seats with florida and arizona still up in the air.
Intelligent pundit: "Wow, looks like the GOP outperformed in more rural, more conservative, more pro-Trump areas. Every Trump state democrat underperformed. Democrats overperformed in blue and wealthy/moderate GOP areas"	Basic pundit: "MANCHIN VOTED FOR KAVANAUGH AND SURVIVED"
@dansenor not sure if serious or what. GOP clearly outperformed in rural pro-trump areas regardless. Manchin vastly underperformed also and only won by three points. Tester hung on despite his YES. Bredesen was a "yes" and got walloped. plz stop
It doesn't matter that Trump only overperformed nationally in a few states but not in the country as a whole. It's a sacred tenet, part of the Trump mythology. It's not going away no matter what happens in the midterms today
Seriously though if you want to know why Trump fans often grossly overestimate their chances in elections, despite polls, this is why. It doesn't matter that polls since Trump have been generally very good. It doesn't matter that Trump in the 2016 primary performed at his polls
Every other election other than a five point overperformance in a few key states but not nationally in the 2016 Trump/Clinton election be damned!! #PresidentLePen #SenatorMoore #CongressmanSaccone #GovernorGillespie 		@PredictIt https://t.co/qQWoXPpqkc

@MarisaKabas @PredictIt Democrats win Tennessee and Texas, flip the Senate. Later, Gary Johnson wins New Mexico, but can't choose whether he wants to be the deciding vote as a Democrat or a Republican. Chaos.
@ScottElliotG @JHWeissmann @marcorubio @JohnJamesMI @TheStalwart @morganrscarboro In all seriousness you don't need very much capital at all to trade in every possible market. You can make incredible % returns but $ returns are low (for a hedge fund) because you're still stuck with the same $850 cap for every market.
Which of you fellow @PredictIt folks is behind @ChangePolls ?
@deadmoney_pi @PredictIt House: R+18	Senate: R+10 (ND, MO, FL, IN, WI, MI, MT, WV, NJ, MN-S)	Upset of the night: Joe Crowley over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
@Nimby_PI Those EA (opp. turnout) numbers !!
@Nimby_PI I'm talking about places were you can make easy trades on PI vs places where you either have negative or little edge
@Nimby_PI I don't think you understand. Tina Smith is trading for 88 cents on PredictIt and is about a 90% favorite to win
(I feel obligated to mention that I'm not personally saying the GOP keeping the house is only 1 in 6. This is just the @FiveThirtyEight model and hopefully helps people like @DineshDSouza who seem to think that if both things are possible it's always 50/50)
How to visualize probability 101:		Pick a number btwn 1 and 6. Roll a die. If it lands on your number, GOP keeps the House. If not, Dems take over.		Are you shocked if you rolled your number? No. But are both cases equally likely? No.		@PredictIt @FiveThirtyEight @NateSilver538
@RichardHanania @PredictIt Reasons include: John James is a black Republican. Michigan is a red state that Trump won. Early voting favors the GOP (despite there being no early voting in Michigan). Polls commissioned by right wing groups show James within 10pts
@j_kalla Fairly simple answer to this: @PredictIt has a strong right wing bias. 	Additionally, @FiveThirtyEight has a major issue which is that they say "if our model is right the chances are X%." However there is uncertainty in their model inputs, such as polls, fundraising etc
Great read for any @PredictIt users. She explains this far better than I could. https://t.co/SUldFFWtY0
Where is the (house) voter turnout market? Senate popular vote margin of victory? 		These markets are: extremely high interest, of significant value, general to the whole country, and trivial to settle		Again: official source here https://t.co/uuib1BX1Y4

.@PredictIt thanks for adding TX MOV. 	Will you be adding some other high interest sen and gov races soon? (rough order of importance)		Sen: FL, AZ, NV, MO, IN, TN, ND, MI, MT, NJ, WV, WI, MN-S, OH, PA, VA, MS-S	Gov: FL, GA, OH, WI, NV, KS, AK, MD, IA, OR, CT, SD, OK, IL, MN, CO
.@PredictIt market for @JacobAWohl federal charges please?		https://t.co/GeATtdrRQV
@paulythegun @PredictIt WV-01 could definitely compete with NJ-02.
I'm not even sure if any district in Tennessee or North Dakota, where the Dem senate candidates will wildly outperform the house candidates, can top this. WV-3 would win but both democrats (Manchin and Ojeda) are going to run much stronger than the typical partisan lean
The D (Jeff Van Drew)  has near-universal name recognition as a state sen and is widely liked by aleml. on the senate side you have the single worst senate candidate in the country (Menendez) facing off against a pro-business "moderate" Republican (Hugin)
I haven't looked at every district so I don't know if there are any expected to have a larger split, but this one is pretty crazy. It's a swing district but the Republican house candidate (Seth Grossman) so racist that even the GOP abandoned him.
.@PredictIt potential market idea: which congressional district sees the biggest split vote between the house and senate. (excluding places without both parties on the ballot, like CA)		My guess? NJ-02 sees a 30 points split between Van Drew (D) and Hugin (R)
@jipkin @Nimby_PI @keendawgSSG @Domahhhh Stabenow &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Smith .
This is actually a lot dumber than @PredictIt traders giving John James a 20% chance of winning the Senate seat in Michigan https://t.co/bZ1v2a8eWv
(additionally I see no reason to only roll out a few at a time when there are only three more weekdays until midterm day. Just dump them all tomorrow or Friday)
Oftentimes we will know the winner relatively early on election night, but why not allow us to predict margin of victory? they are useful markets NOW, but also stay useful and volatile on election night. Please add as many as you can @WillJenningsDC
FL gov/sen, WI gov/sen, TN sen, NV gov/sen, AZ sen, CT gov, OR gov, IN sen, ND sen, GA gov, MI gov/sen, WV sen, NJ sen, MO sen, KS gov, OK gov, TX sen, OH gov/sen, SD gov, PA sen, VA sen, MN/MN-2 sen, MS-2 sen, IA gov, MT sen, IL gov, CO gov, AK gov, CA sen, PA gov/sen
.@PredictIt any reason for the grand total of zero MOV markets for the midterms? why haven't you guys just dumped a bunch of markets for the extremely high interest races? volume and interest will be through the roof on Tuesday, and I see no reason not to have all of these:
@jipkin @PredictIt This one and Michigan take the cake
Most underrated Senate race, by far? New Jersey. Menendez at serious risk of drowning in the endless corruption and child sex allegations.. margin market needed DESPERATELY		@PredictIt
@houseof218 @ForecasterEnten @PredictIt I feel so sorry that Republicans in states where Trump is not popular cannot figure out how to both win a primary and a general election.
@houseof218 @ForecasterEnten @PredictIt He's a sharp, charismatic politician for sure. If he would stop binding himself to Donald Trump and hardcore conservatism, he could make a legitimate run as an independent voice in Michigan. Because of this, he has no place in statewide politics for the foreseeable future
@ForecasterEnten well @PredictIt "forecasters" have had the Republican, John James at 15-20% to win for a while, regardless of his deficit. Reasons include "Michigan is a red state", "everybody hates Debbie Stabenow", and "James [being black] will take away black votes"
@marywitha4 @PredictIt Given the official government source that I found for elections, I will assume that if @PredictIt creates the markets they will use that rather than any third party

@jeff_basinger @PredictIt It's not really fair to compare incumbent Rodney Frelinghuysen winning reelection over and over, but in general yes Democrats can't win the district.

@jipkin that's the correct take, yes
Poll out of Georgia showing Brian Kemp with a huge lead over Casey Cagle. Poll taken before Trump's endorsement		More evidence that Trump only endorses candidates who become favorites and that Trump's endorsement itself is not that meaningful

@jipkin @TPreziosi @DatJustinGuyTho @WillJenningsDC @Pete_Monahan_JD @PredictIt @deadmoney_pi @DmpFromPI tbh bring "will trump tweet X today" back. I know autos, but still
If Kemp wins in a landslide, that is evidence that Trump's endorsement is larger than previously thought. If it is close, or Kemp loses, this suggests the above principles are accurate.		One final note: many voters in GA have voted early, dampening any effect of an endorsement
Kemp in Georgia is a good test of this.	The race is already high profile, with most voters knowing some about the candidates. Kemp was only a slight favorite, and Trump's endorsement was simply a tweet.
6. Trump has never pushed an underdog ahead (He endorsed Katie Arrington a few hours before the polls closed, having no impact)
4. A campaign appearance for Trump supporting that candidate drives turnout up in favor of the endorsed candidate. Tweets or statements of support are far less impactful	5. Trump only endorses candidates who are already the favorite (reluctant Luther Strange endorsement aside)
1. Trump's endorsement in Republican primaries does in fact help some	2. It helps much more in low profile races with low expected turnout and most voters not knowing about any candidate	3. It helps a lot less in high profile races where voters have largely made up their mind
... if and how much Trump's endorsement matters in a Republican primary.		After sifting through the endorsements, I've come up with a few general principles to help guide traders..
After Trump's endorsement of Brian Kemp in the Georgia Governor Runoff, otherwise a close race with Lt Gov Casey Cagle, many pundits are claiming that Kemp has the race locked up and @PredictIt traders took Kemp to a 90% favorite.		Intelligent traders are asking themselves...
@TPreziosi @DatJustinGuyTho @WillJenningsDC @Pete_Monahan_JD @PredictIt @deadmoney_pi @DmpFromPI I'm asking that when the Senate's big priority for the week is passing the farm bill, we get a market for whether or not it will pass. 		Too many of these major legislative priorities are overlooked.
@TPreziosi @DatJustinGuyTho @WillJenningsDC @Pete_Monahan_JD @PredictIt @deadmoney_pi @DmpFromPI shs mention markets..		but really there is a lot that goes on in washington on a daily or weekly basis. many important bills and priorities have been overlooked
@AndrewBond3 @WillJenningsDC @DatJustinGuyTho @Pete_Monahan_JD @PredictIt @deadmoney_pi @TPreziosi @DmpFromPI 0.5 is better yes. we were right on the nose last night and got about 5k volume today in a 50/50 market. that's overall pretty bad but given that there were no surprises today it seems okay
@DatJustinGuyTho @WillJenningsDC @Pete_Monahan_JD @PredictIt @deadmoney_pi @TPreziosi @DmpFromPI my strong opinion here is you will not get anywhere near decent volume to play on a daily basis
@WillJenningsDC @DatJustinGuyTho @Pete_Monahan_JD @PredictIt @deadmoney_pi @TPreziosi @DmpFromPI my opinion is you need to figure out how to drum up good weekly volume first.. the bracket ranges are okay but they must be tighter.

This race isn't clear one way or the other but taking McBath to 75% favorite is patently ridiculous with no polling and lots of reasons to like the moderate white male Kevin Abel in a moderate largely white district. @PredictIt @KevinAbel2018 @LucyWins2018 https://t.co/ZeVHMyFJ4s
... but it will be a very different electorate for the runoff (likely much smaller). It's hard to see McBath as a favorite when the other candidates were also pro-business moderates, and their voters are likely to go Abel...
She's getting a lot of national support from outside groups, but locally in the district the support is going to her opponent, Kevin Abel. This is a fairly moderate district and Abel is a wealthy white male moderate. McBath did defeat Abel by a few percent in the first round...
Lucy McBath is a pretty bad runoff candidate in GA-6 Democratic Primary. She's a single issue (guns) candidate, a black woman in a district that's not very black for Georgia. Unlike the first round, there won't be a black woman on the governor's ticket (no runoff for gov)

Paging polling whistleblowers @Nate_Cohn @NateSilver538
Have heard a rumor that SurveyMonkey fabricates their poll results. They poll a number of races and give "reasonable" results, but then on the last race push the narrative they want. The Senate poll shows "reasonable" results but Tennessee is wildly out of line with other polls..

@MichaelJosem @jimgeraghty @NateSilver538 I don't think you understand how this site works. there is no bookmaker, just individual bettors. the fact that bettors net bid 110 or higher for the field is because they are unaware that they can bet against individual choices. there is risk-free money in the market net of fees
@MichaelJosem @jimgeraghty @NateSilver538 Normal betmakers do not allow you to lay the field for better than 100% probability.

In South Carolina, Trump-endorsee Henry McMaster fought off John Warren for the republican Governor nomination. Warren was grossly undervalued for 10% and once early returns showed Warren surging the market corrected to 50/50		@PredictIt
On the Republican side, far right Lee Bright was defeated by businessman William Timmons. Timmons was always the favorite despite being priced at 25% on @PredictIt (easy $)		Trump-endorsed Dan Donovan was way underpriced at 40% in NY.
The Ocasio Cortez victory was a massive upset, certainly less than the 25% chance @PredictIt was giving her before the results.		Jealous was an underdog but not a heavy one.		Polis was a lock the whole way through.
Best night for progressives in some time. 		Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeats 10 term incumbent and Party Boss Joe Crowley in NY-14.		Ben Jealous seals the Democratic nomination for Governor in MD over top county executive.		And Jared Polis wins the Dem governor nomination in CO.

@PredictIt Interesting way of doing this. Totally disincentivizes buying "sure things" over 80c for anyone trying to win. More scraps are left on the table than the size of the prize (by a 10+ fold margin). Fine by me, but if you want to have people seriously compete it should be absolute $

@PredictIt There's no point, for example to buying "sure things" for 85 cents. It would increase overall profit but decrease ROI. The winner in your case is going to be someone who buys a longshot for a very cheap price and wins.
@PredictIt If ROI is measured in dollar form, I'm game. Otherwise, pass.

The reason is MSM portraying the battle for second as between Cox and Villaraigosa, who was in second place in polls many moons ago but has recently dropped into third. Really dishonest reporting!

Trump-endorsed John Cox is currently in second place, but Tea Party Republican Travis Allen is in third place, is within striking distance of second, and is 4 cents.

@AndrewBond3 @Pete_Monahan_JD The primaries are not closed. "No Party" can vote in either D or R primary
@AndrewBond3 @ToastieOs The @PredictIt market has Manchin at only 55% to win.. that's cray
@burgermanofoz Sherrod Brown, Tammy Baldwin, Bob Casey, Debbie Stabenow are not really vulnerable at all unless there's a major shift in national public opinion (and even then..)
@marywitha4 Greitens is not running for Senate in Missouri
Manchin's electoral history in  WV is pristine: 2004 Governor by 29 points, 2008 governor by 45 points, 2010 senator by 10 points, 2012 senator by 24 points
Just to be clear Manchin is not a lock but he's not really in trouble either. It matters that Patrick Morrisey is a New Yorker and DC lobbyist, moved to WV in 2012.		And I haven't mentioned Tester of MT who is similarly unlikely to lose and Donnelly (IN) who is around Heitkamp
If you want to bet on a Democrat losing reelection in a deep red state, bet on Claire McCaskill of MO first, who isn't that well liked, Heidi Heitkamp, who barely won in 2012 and is facing ND's representative, and Joe Manchin of WV last, who won by 24pts in 2012 and is well liked

@lookner The @PredictIt markets now have Lesko at 99% to win the election, but likely to win by less than 5%		https://t.co/GyKs8ugHCe
Come on down to @PredictIt and bet on the margin of victory in the Arizona Special Election!		https://t.co/GyKs8ugHCe
Come down to @PredictIt and bet on the margin of Debbie Lesko's win in Arizona! She's currently leading by 5.8% but none of the election day vote has been counted.		https://t.co/GyKs8ugHCe
Looks like Debbie Lesko wins in the Arizona Special election tonight. This could have flipped IF there were high election day turnout (which there wasn't). This is why before seeing turnout reports, having Lesko at 90 cents was too high!		@PredictIt
@lookner		About 85% of the vote is already counted. Tipirneni would need to win by about 30% for today's vote to overtake Lesko's lead. It's over
@lookner	Outright winner: 		https://t.co/xBiGRCJGqa
@lookner Prediction Markets currently think LESKO will win by 5-10 points. US users can wager real money on this		https://t.co/GyKs8ugHCe		@PredictIt
@Videsmarais @lookner Feel free to put money down behind your prediction here.		https://t.co/GyKs8ugHCe
Be cautious paying 90 for anything.. but yeah
Bottom line in Arizona-8: Tipirneni needed a high election day turnout to overcome Lesko's advantage in early voting.		That did... not even come close to happening.		https://t.co/xBiGRCJGqa
Look, I get it. You're jealous. I feel that way too every time I miss a good trade. But I promise if you start following my trades on twitter, you can up your profitability. https://t.co/XqZzNoTbY2

For the record I don't think Kucinich will win, but he has a motivated base. Fair pricing is about 70/30 Cordray.
Nothing like a race where one poll is tied , one with Cordray ahead and the market is 85/15 Cordray/Kucinich. 🤷‍♂️	@PredictIt		https://t.co/cayu58KCvs
Not necessarily smart to just buy NO on the current ask. Wait for better prices. You want to buy NO on all for 35-40c
One easy way of knowing is that the last prices add up to about 120 in all brackets
I'm leaning a lower number of tweets in @realDonaldTrump than the past few days.		@PredictIt 		B60, b70, B80 are pretty inflated right now if you can buy NO on all for 35c.

I'm taking the most Conservative approach here which is what I think I should do. I set the buy target "under 25" but I'll assume people paid 25. I set sell target 35 and we hit 33, but I'll assume nobody sold up there since we didn't actually hit the target.

Not making a call, but McSally for the AZ Senate GOP primary is very overpriced for 67c. She's barely ahead in the polls, and none since Jan. Still 4 months away. Also a decent chance Arpaio or Ward drop out IF McCain resigns due to health.	@PredictIt 	https://t.co/QQaUPqFpA2

@orrkevina @PredictIt Yeah they're going to wait for either	1) Cohn to show up to work Monday	2) If not, ask NEC if he resigned over the weekend	3) If no clear response, default to YES most likely
Shout-out to @PredictIt for paying out most of the 3/31 markets on Easter Sunday!
@orrkevina @VP @PredictIt Hard to know for sure. The market won't heavily correct until he remains quiet on Monday. Sundays are usually slow so the market is waiting for him to be quiet on days where he's usually tweeting (say Monday) before it really corrects.		Other factors will keep B1 cheap all week.
Update on the @VP tweet trade. Up about $550 including 944 shares I mistakenly sold at 99. Congrats to those who followed the call. If you want to buy in perhaps wait for a Happy Easter tweet (or two) tomorrow. @PredictIt		https://t.co/cfGsnntnCP https://t.co/rxWnGcfw5y
The @PredictIt market is here: https://t.co/LcTEf8ICww		I own shares of YES because given everything I've shared, it seems extremely likely that his last day will be Monday when Kudlow takes over. However, caution is advised.
This all seems very unlikely, but is possible. The @PredictIt market closes at midnight but take some time to pay as the website tries to be sure about his last day, and absent any official evidence should resolve YES. There is no website for NEC employees. No @PressSec update.
So it's possible that Cohn's "vacation" was misreported and he left silently last week with no exit ceremony and no indication he wouldn't be coming back. It's also possible he makes the transition Saturday, again without telling anyone.
Nobody has reported about Cohn's last date. For other similar high profile departure we have known their last date, including Hope Hicks on Friday and Sean Spicer in August.	https://t.co/IHFtemx2AM	https://t.co/ygrq8RijjP		Nothing for Cohn.
he could start, including an ethics review and probably a security clearance. This takes time. Kudlow on his weekly radio show today said that he would be ending the program and heading to Washington on Monday, presumably to start as NEC Director.
Throughout March we continued to hear about Gary Cohn at White House events as "outgoing NEC Director". However, he left for vacation last week, so we haven't heard from him since.		We know Kudlow is planning to take Cohn's job at NEC. Kudlow needed to go through process before
So here's the deal with the Gary Cohn market on @PredictIt that snaps shut at midnight tonight.		We know Gary Cohn resigned a few weeks ago but did not set an exit date. @PressSec said he was not leaving right away but we would get an update on his departure date.
@PredictIt don't screw this one up - Cohn is still there until Kudlow starts (now seems like Monday) https://t.co/QHROw185Ml
There's only one market on @PredictIt that closes on 3/31 that you can still trade. Gary Cohn, as far as we know is still the NEC Director (pending Kudlow starting).		Market closes tomorrow night and YES shares will (should) be paid out on Sunday/Monday.		https://t.co/hxqw4sw3ma

@John_B_Dawson @Redistrict it's his hometown. not a surprise
@Redistrict Casten only needs to net about 3 votes per precinct left when most of what's left are in the good parts of the county for him (Downing Grove, Milton, Lisle). Averaging about 9 votes ahead of Mazeski there. Seems pretty over barring a surprise of some kind.

@MEPFuller @j_strong Love these tweets!
@kylegriffin1 Kelly was first to leave though
@AndrewBond3 @PredictIt @MEPFuller This won't be the bill though
@AndrewBond3 @MEPFuller @PredictIt Thanks for your opinion there, I agree, but just to be clear this has nothing to do with whether or not you can get 120 Rs on board the spending bill
@WillJenningsDC @PredictIt I trade about 25,000 shares a day, Will
@DmpFromPI @real_j_mark @WillJenningsDC @PredictIt same
@AndrewBond3 @MEPFuller @PredictIt Those two seem pretty unrelated..
@AndrewBond3 @MEPFuller @PredictIt It is a delicate balance because you still need 60 Senators to vote for the bill. And a lot of Democrats. A grand deal with wall funding, maybe? Hard to say. Market is at least 50/50 when you consider it's still only 1 month in. If the market were just for this bill I'd say 35/65
@AndrewBond3 @MEPFuller @PredictIt either way, DACA needs to be addressed at some point. That should make getting a majority of majority very hard.
@MEPFuller @AndrewBond3 @PredictIt Even with a DACA fix? That would surprise me. Either way, it's going to be very close and 25 cent buys were a steal.
@AndrewBond3 @PredictIt @MEPFuller It's unclear whether or not a DACA fix is added. They are certainly talking about it. IF the DACA fix is added in the Senate bill, it has a tough time getting 120 House Rs on board. If not, you may get 120 Rs but not enough Ds (if any) to pass it through the House.
@AndrewBond3 @PredictIt @MEPFuller You only need a simple majority. But for this market to resolve YES, you need under half of REPUBLICANS to vote YES. You can get any number of Democrats on board and hit the 216 votes for a majority.
@PredictIt @asreese Great market! But I would suggest also using suggestions for markets that are shorter term IE expiring within a week or month.		Not saying you haven't done so, but the more the better.
@MEPFuller Sounds like a majority of Republicans will not support this then
@AndrewBond3 @PredictIt @MEPFuller https://t.co/rXTC1WD1mk		Add in a DACA fix and it's not getting 120 Rs.
@AndrewBond3 @PredictIt Raises the debt ceiling. Raises spending caps in other areas. (Possibly) fixes DACA. Read @MEPFuller tweets . He's estimating over 100 Dems will be needed to pass this, which implies under 116 Rs will vote for it.
@PredictIt I own most of the yes shares. Market realizing that the spending bill very possibly will pass without a majority of Rs

@CoinShadow Just be careful - you want to catch a panic dump, not a longer term drift down, which the coin has been doing for the last few days. See Jan 6th around 5:30 eastern where it dropped 30% and then popped back up
@crypto_rand That mooned quickly!
Sorry, 142949*
Well that happened faster than I expected. Sold STRAT for 14249!
@CoinShadow Nah just looking for a short term scalp 230 -&gt; 250. Trade probably won't happen unless there's a power dump of someone who bought on the way up to 290 sats
Classic dumpage in $XMY. Let's see if we can get down to 230 sats?
$STRAT looking juicy for 126500 on Bittrex. Buying some hoping to hit 135000 or 140000 soon
@kaylatausche I'm one of the few who does this full time professionally. I'll also fire you off an email
@geekz I don't care because I'm selling it for bitcoin
@jean__mueller Cool dude! btw, what exchange are you on? They don't have TRON listed on Bittrex
Would not surprise me to see $LSK hit 0.0019 - 0.002 BTC soon..
Had to sell some $ENG for below my target price as numerous large sellers have come into the market. However, still a profitable trade. Sold for 32,503 sats.		Was a very, very small loser at 0.26% after fees
I always make sure to have about half of my account in $BTC and the other half in alts I'm trading against $BTC.		That way, I'm hedged against bitcoin price moves..
@geekz Sorry?
look at $BTC go! back to 16k on Bittrex!
$ENG / $BTC about to rally back.. 5 minute RSI is a freaking 10! Super oversold
$ENG added even more at 32111 and 31006 sats.. going to rally back soon to at least 34500 sats
bought some $ENG on that dip. Selling at 36349 sats
$ENG buyer at 34571 on bittrex*
Bought a few million $EMB for 1 sat on https://t.co/EcnTgelwcJ		Selling for 2 sats then closing my YoBit account. Lol thanks for the free bitcon

Long term I'm pretty bearish on $XVG but that's just my opinion I don't trade on it. I trade short term only, and $XVG is a buy for 1165 sats for sure!
$ZEN looking like a solid buy for 430,000 sats.. buyer between here and 400,000. Versus $BTC on Bittrex.		Let's go $ZEN $BTC!
@leelord337 sign up for https://t.co/E1BxEspmtt @PredictIt immediately.
$PAY oof rejected from the 29500 level. Coming in slightly, will probably retest that level and break through next time. I believe in you $PAY!
@leelord337 not an investment because I'm only interested in day/swing trading for now.
@leelord337 never put your eggs in one basket..
$PAY all signals bullish. Let's rock and roll. targeting 5-10% gains in the next few hours
$PAY nice little dump there. I'm in for 29030 sats
@leelord337 @Altcoinbuzzio Coin is complete crap. They'd have to burn most of the coin every year and then, what's its selling point?		Only reason to buy is if you can buy for 1 SAT and sell for 2 SATs vs BTC or something
@Altcoinbuzzio Come on this coin is complete garbage and its selling point is outrageously high inflation..
come on $NEO break $70! Or just rally back to $74.11 and give me profits. Either way is fine.
In case anyone is wondering yes my trades right now are tiny (between 50 and 500$ per trade). I am being extremely confident with size until I become more confident.		Next week I will probably double size and trade between $100 and $1,000. Then up to 1BTC/trade in next month
I don't complain about the many, many, many 1-10% winning trades as account builders.. but I need to learn how to pick underpriced coins and sell for 5 and 10x gains..
sold those for 1329 sats.. thanks for the quick money
lol $NEO what are you doing dropping 5% in a few minutes on Bittrex. Versus $USDT. I'm a buyer for $73
Wow $XVG dropping way too fast. RSI under 30 now. Buyer at 1261.. vs $BTC on Bittrex

Sold the $NLG for 0.00001929 $BTC on Bittrex after buying for 0.00001850. not getting a good feeling about the price over the next few hours.		Gulden Bitcoin.
Boy do I feel stupid. I shouldn't be trading $BCH $BCC or $BTC or $DASH any other large coin vs $USDT. Should be trading $XRP during this crazy volatility!
Got some $DASH for $927.5 on Bittrex. Selling $960. Should a be a quick profit, or else I will buy more for $900.		Either drop or rise quickly!		$BTC $USDT
$STRAT dropping fast on Bittrex! Fantastic buy for 96000 sat. Don't miss out!

In this case, alt-right Breitbart types are buying Roy Moore up to ridiculous, and completely unjustified levels.
