RT @bscanlanCSPAN: Rep. @LorettaSanchez on House floor calling for NBC to dis-invite #DonaldTrump from hosting #SaturdayNightLive LIVE now ‚Ä¶
SNL has achieved that in the past, and I am hopeful that they can achieve that again. @nbcsnl #DumpTrumpOnSNL
Comedy has the power to highlight hypocrisy in society &amp; reveal important social truths &amp; political commentary. @nbcsnl
Having Mr. Trump host degrades the quality of SNL‚Äôs humor. Racism isn‚Äôt funny. It is lazy and cheap. @nbcsnl
I hope the producers, writers and cast members will consider how Donald Trump hosting @nbcsnl will compromise the integrity of their show.
Currently there isn‚Äôt a single Latino cast member on SNL and there have only been two Latino cast members on SNL EVER! @nbcsnl
Some think Mr. Trump is causing controversy for media attention, but his divisive &amp; racist rhetoric has troubling real world consequences.
I encourage @nbcsnl to dis-invite Donald Trump from hosting their show this weekend.
The best thing we can do for our returning #veterans is to open opportunities for them in the civilian world &amp; that starts with #education
We need to fix the #VA backlog, expedite disability claims &amp; ensure all #veterans receive timely &amp; quality medical assistance.
#FemaleVets will require different care &amp; we have a responsibility to provide for these brave women who've served as trailblazers. #veterans
20% of new recruits will be women, 15% of the 1.4M active duty forces are currently women &amp; 280,000 women have served in Iraq &amp; Afghanistan
As the military begins to open up more positions to women, we must identify how we can better serve our female #veterans. #femalevets #VA
We must be ready &amp; prepared to provide for our future influx of #veterans. These vets served their country &amp; it's time for us to serve them.
California anticipates receiving 30,000 additional discharged members of the Armed Services each year for the next several years. #veterans
Just in California, there are 1.8 million #veterans making up 8% of the total US veteran population.
We must be held responsible for providing all the necessary resources to help our #veterans succeed outside of the military.
We must commit to figuring out how we are failing to meet the unique needs of these young men and women when they return home. #veterans
Our #veterans are brave, skillful, loyal &amp; dedicated critical thinkers who love their country, yet 49,933 vets were homeless in 2014.
In 2014, both male and female #veterans were more likely to be homeless than their non-veteran counterparts.
In Orange County, nearly 1/4 of #veterans with jobs are earning at or below the poverty level. These numbers are unacceptable.
From a recent study conducted by @USC: nearly 8 in 10 service members leave the military without a job. #veterans
From a recent study conducted by @USC: over 2/3 of today‚Äôs #veterans report difficulties adjusting to civilian life.
I'm about to speak on the House Floor about the challenges our #veterans face when they return home.

This Congress must ACT on climate change before the damages to the earth are irreversible. #LWCF
#LWCF comes at no cost to the taxpayer, but its benefits are enormous. And yet, this House allowed the fund to expire on September 30th.
#LWCF is another example of a common sense, bipartisan program on which this House has neglected to act.
Since I was elected to congress almost 20 years ago, I have worked tirelessly to bring green projects back to Orange County and California.
The #Latino community is family oriented. We strive to provide a better life for future generations, which includes how we leave our planet.
I'm speaking on the House Floor about the importance of preserving our planet and what we can do to address the impacts of climate change.

Our families, our roads, and our economy deserve a highway funding bill that will invest in America‚Äôs future.
We need to stop slashing and start providing. We need to get away from this sequestration &amp; patchwork funding mentality.
Which is why my fellow House Democrats have come together to provide a six-year highway funding bill known as the GROW AMERICA Act.
By failing to provide Americans with a long-term Highway bill-- not only are we putting jobs at risk, we are putting lives at risk!
How will we fix a broken bridge or broken highway? Two months of highway funding just isn‚Äôt enough for our states &amp; localities to depend on.

Let‚Äôs remember what one of the first voices for educational equity, LBJ said ‚ÄúEducation is not a problem. Education is an opportunity‚Äù #ESEA
Let‚Äôs invest in preventive solutions to ensure our most vulnerable children truly have every opportunity to achieve. #ESEA
Action is needed to overcome the school-to-prison pipeline. Let‚Äôs start paying less for our prisons and spend more on our schools. #ESEA
w/o clear expectations for reporting and action, we are doing a disservice for those children who fall through  the cracks. #ESEA
It requires timely state action to address inequities where they persist to provide fed resources &amp; support to lowest performing schools.
Republicans have pushed through their own version of an ESEA reauthorization that limits opportunity for our neediest students.
We can no longer ignore the social and economic issues are our great nation is currently facing. And it all starts in our classrooms.
ESEA meant to serve our poor and minority students, disabled students &amp; English learners. This landmark legislation is a civil rights law.
ESEA reaffirmed the 1947 Mendez vs. Westminster decision that every child has the right to an equal opportunity for a quality education.
In 1965 the Declaration of Policy stated that ESEA was ‚Äúin recognition of the special education needs of children of low-income families.‚Äù

The mistreatment/sentences of political prisoners in #Vietnam are outrageous for practicing peaceful expression and political advocacy.
I strongly urge the entire Administration to talk about the prisoners of conscience with the leaders of Vietnam. #Vietnam @viettan
#Vietnam citizens are continuously being harassed detained and imprisoned for standing up for values which we as Americans hold dearly.

We should work w the int'l community within legal frameworks we have agreed to in order to address the illegal use of chem weapons 2/4

@BarackObama's direct address to the American people tonight was a welcome one.
However, this cannot be used as a delay tactic by the Syrian regime. Hard deadlines should be made and met. (2 of 2)
If true, I am pleased to hear that a diplomatic solution to removing chemical weapons from Syria is within sight. (1 of 2)

I urge Speaker #Boehner &amp; House #GOP Leadership to not play politics w/ immigration reform &amp; bring bill to the floor for an up or down vote.
Today the possibility of implementing meaningful comprehensive immigration reform took a monumental step forward
#SCOTUS ruling means #Prop8 is null and void, upholding what majority of Californians have long believed to be right. #equality
SCOTUS strikes down #DOMA - great day for equality in America!
Re SCOTUS VRA decision: ‚ÄúTime is of the essence; Congress must act fast to ensure every American has equal access to the ballot box
#SCOTUS ruling on VRA is huge setback for minority voters who have been and will now be at greater risk of disenfranchisement.
