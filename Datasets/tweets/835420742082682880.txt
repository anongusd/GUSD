@juliaioffe Merry Christmas to everyone who will accept it as the generic season’s greeting it has come to be and not an offense to their religion or lack of one. And Happy Hanukkah to all, same deal. We’re in this together, even if our ancestors didn’t believe the same bullshit. Don’t @ me
@juliaioffe A non-Jewish friend wished me a happy Hanukkah the other day and I wished them the same. Smiles all around. Imagining if they responded “please do not wish me a happy Hanukkah.” 🙄
