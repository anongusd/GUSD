@margwarett Towards forgiveness for people in who believe they’re enrolled in PSLF (you need 120 payments to count)
The successful strategies to get payments to count = treating calling FedLoan like it’s a part-time job; contacting AG’s office to perform audit. But again: if you’re not on that countdown clock, they’re not counting
Someone asked me if his early payments were counting. Another asked if paying extra each month made payments not count. FedLoan didn’t respond to inquiries, but both of those things disqualified payments for multiple respondents to my debt survey, and experts say they’re common
Not in FedLoan? They’re not counting. I hate how many emails and messages are from people who didn’t realize this. 		(Here’s the original piece: https://t.co/vbZFrY7kPF)
Quick note about my student loan piece - I’m getting some emails concerned about whether payments are counting. I’m in no way an expert, but if your “payments til forgiveness” count is going down in FedLoan, that seems to be the ONLY way to know for sure they’re counting
@EDAnalyst We’re correcting this now. Meant to suggest that it happened with private loans but you’re right, I missed it in the final draft.

@libbyanelson Absolutely agree that people who don't finish college are a far more significant part of the story here — and voices aren't often shared, in part because of the retributive view re: debt. "You should've worked harder to finish"
@KarenLeick Still waiting for the ultimate takedown of that immoral program
@libbyanelson Maybe I'm misreading your point here — there's a ton in there about how this affects undergraduates? Half the testimonials in there are from people with exclusively undergraduate loans. It's just that the people with graduate loans were specific about their programs

@thatdarnedbob There we go, I had forgotten I had to go private DMs b/c of trolls a few weeks ago
@thatdarnedbob Oh weird! Let me make sure my DMs are open again
@Lee__Drake @Navient Unfortunately, this often doesn't work either.
There seems to be some question of whether or not people with student debt are shamed in our society — after all, education is never framed as shameful. The shame is there, but it's never straightforward. It's questions like this: https://t.co/NZd3Z4P1AT
But a huge amount of gratitude goes to the borrowers who were willing to speak frankly re: the affects of debt on their lives. 		One person featured in this story was so nervous, even though it's just her first name &amp; she's effectively anonymized. "I just feel so much shame."
Plus Hilary Herbold on "Never a Level Playing Field: Blacks and the GI Bill," which isn't available online but you can DM me with your email address for a copy
And @johnthorntonjr, whose writing on student debt was revelatory for me: 		https://t.co/vT8aNAf4Ht
@BobbyBigWheel That's definitely how I've been thinking of it. It also helps think through why some Gen-Xers "feel" more like millennials (because their debt is structured like ours)
As with every piece, this one owes a lot to other thinkers, especially the incredible @tressiemcphd, whose LOWER ED is just indispensable. 		https://t.co/BoaKYZpDRq
You might not have student loans. 		You might not be in a student loan forgiveness program — and, as such, might think that the problems plaguing the thousands who are struggling with their debt have nothing to do with you. 		You’re wrong. https://t.co/Tj8AWd2JpX
For this piece, I talked to hundreds of people who have been screwed by the promise of student loan forgiveness. I've written about a lot of broken parts of the government but this is really, really, broken. https://t.co/ORVe0FLZrS
This piece is also about feeling like you did what everyone around you told you to do in order to succeed — and then get shamed for doing it. 		“Growing up a poor black kid, all I heard was college, college, college. Now we’re fools for taking out loans to make it happen?”

@summeranne All I know for sure is that whatever you do next is going to be fascinating to watch.
But learning how to make a list — and the larger principles of virality, the how and why of 'sharing' — was just important to my growth as a reporter as, well, learning how to report, or what a "dek" is. That was what Summer gave me. That and a big fucking chance.
That first 6 months, I alternated between longform and personal essays, but my team also taught me how to write a classic BuzzFeed list. A good list is much, much harder than most people understand.
In Old School BuzzFeed, before BuzzFeed News was even a thing, we had "teams" — and Summer was the head of mine, w/people from across Buzz. Everyone else on that team has quit or been laid off.
That piece essentially wrote my job description. But it never would've happened if Summer hadn't taken a "risk" on me, a media studies professor in Walla Walla, Washington, just like BuzzFeed took a "risk" on hiring her.
Summer helped me think through (and edit) the essay that would become Jennifer Lawrence and the History of Cool Girls — one of the first pieces of longform on BuzzFeed to go viral. 		https://t.co/U1kWkwUZ50
People ask me how I possibly ended up at BuzzFeed. The answer is that Summer saw something in me &amp; my esoteric celebrity knowledge that she thought could &amp; should have a larger audience. She understood that it didn't matter what was on your resume if you could speak to readers. https://t.co/L9m1hBhRvw

@princesssmolly This is a good dad tweet
All of this also makes me realize how cyclical labor history is: unions force us to value labor; labor is valued so unions are perceived as unnecessary; therefore rendering unions essential once again. There's a solution to this, friends.
@typingduck Sure! Also when unions had more sway on Dems
@typingduck Didn't used to be this way!
@MenaceSocietyUT Currently, sure. But not historically!
And, even more importantly: that valuing your labor means other people will be forced to value it more — and that you're not greedy, or un-American, to do so. Instead: the opposite is true. Living in proximity to Butte, Montana — &amp; its storied labor history — also taught me this.
To me, this is one of the many benefits of unions: a mass of people telling you to value your fucking labor
@nota_bennett Truly this is how it has to be to make change
It takes SO MUCH to change our thinking about labor, especially as millennials, from "I should be grateful this company gave me a job" to "I scooped out my soul for this company for seven years; yes, I am right and in no way greedy to ask for severance *and* PTO paid out
Severance should be separate from paying out PTO. This phrasing is trying to guilt people into not asking for their PTO and encouraging them to be grateful for their severance. https://t.co/4QfMR8yjA2
@Melody_Lane If there's one type of job we do have it's in science
@eachapm THIS EXACTLY (aka, if you do, it'll make more work for your coworkers, and everyone will suffer!)
@rereadpages A friend of mine did this as well.
But I wasn't weepy, or shaken in the way I "recognized" grief or burnout. I'm 100% positive that if I'd asked, I'd have been given the time off. It's not about that.
@DLind YEP.
I was *on vacation* in Austin when Sutherland Springs happened. I cut my vacation short and drove directly there. I didn't take a single day off afterwards. And wow I should have.
One of the things I've heard media unions discuss = MANDATORY time off after coverage of a traumatic event. Because if it's not mandatory, most of us millennials won't take it — because not taking it is a way to prove we're better workers.
There's also the fact that PTO at a place like BuzzFeed includes "comp days" for working nonstop during/after a national news event. A school shooting. A trial. Without weekends for months leading up to an election.
To be fair, I've had managers at BuzzFeed tell me the same. That doesn't mean that I didn't internalize that actually taking it would make me a less valuable employee. https://t.co/g3Ov6xm1RT

Thank you for @SusanElizabeth for clarifying that *earned* (as in "banked") PTO has to be paid in Montana, as it's considered wages, which leaves a shitty loophole if it's just a bulk sum of sick/leave/time-off days
@nczeitgeist No
I'm sorry that it all leads back to burnout culture but few things are more burnout culture than not taking PTO so you can work all the time only to be laid off by your company and denied that PTO
The most insidious thing about this = most of the laid off BuzzFeed employees have weeks &amp; weeks of PTO, largely because reporters in general (and younger, digital ones in particular) internalize that to take vacation is to abscond on your duty https://t.co/kaWHkZBqVz
Other states where you have to pay out PTO: Montana. Every state deserves a labor history/advocates as strong as Montana's, but until that's a reality, please encourage BuzzFeed to pay out PTO to my colleagues who were laid off last week. https://t.co/kaWHkZBqVz

And I don't think that being white or a man means you behave in a certain way. But it does allow you to behave in a certain way, if you chose, generally without consequences. In public, in the classroom, throughout your life. That's privilege.
I have watched all of the videos. You can understand that the situation was more complex than the first video and still recognize why the sight of that face caused a visceral reaction in so many.

For those convinced this kid did nothing wrong, here's a long and thorough breakdown, with extensive video, of what happened in the lead-up to the confrontation: 		https://t.co/OQowE3QIly
Natives who were there and Natives who have made addressing that systemic equality their live's work want to decenter these kids and talk about how indicative this interaction is of power relations that are centuries old and so often ignored or made invisible
This kid and his behavior is a symptom of something much larger. I don't think focuses on him, specifically, does much — and also leads to the current narrative of his victimhood.
@1WMCSC Keep reading and you'll see I was judging him on much more!
@ericdemamp https://t.co/OQowE3QIly
@LDoren I would very much not call it "debunked": https://t.co/YgIefsV6ru
I encountered this guy at big state schools and small elite private colleges. His accent and major might change but the fundamentals of his identity did not: he was white, he was male, and — at least as far as he performed it — he was straight
Of course, that guy was also the guy with the gumption to ask for extensions. To miss class and email asking "what'd I miss?" To plagiarize. To get a C and come to office hours and try to flirt his way to a better grade. The gall of his mediocrity never ceased to surprise me.
There was always one of them in every class. The guy who whispered to his friends when I lectured. The guy who snickered when his classmates answered questions. The guy who tried to turn serious class discussions into jokes.
I will never know what it's like to be around that face and its power as a Native person. But I know how many times I've seen that face in the classroom.
One theme of the conversations over the past 24 hours = how deeply familiar this look is. It's the look of white patriarchy, of course, but that familiarity — that banality — is part of what prompts the visceral reaction. This isn't spectacular. It's life in America. https://t.co/TmziDwAjYA

Some Sunday @tressiemcphd and @saragoldrickrab https://t.co/H1j39INZXN
@farmersdontjog At least that's what it means to me!
@farmersdontjog It means that it's not talking about white identity in a way that excuses/flattens racist views associated with it — or links it, overtly or implicitly, to "economic anxiety"
@tressiemcphd I broke my toe two weeks ago ON MY OWN DUMB STAIRS. It is so deeply annoying.
This is a very interesting and non-Hillbilly Elegy interview on the link between white identity and racism - including discussion of why women identify more strongly as “white” than men. Can’t wait to read this book: https://t.co/P9opuHdQkC
This, too: https://t.co/n45WWnv194
And this is true of people on the left and the right, of readers and of journalists and pundits reacting to other journalists’ stories
Somehow everyone in the universe or at least on this website has listened to Slow Burn and yet internalized none of its core messages
People often call journalism the “first draft of history” for a reason: it’s a developing story. That doesn’t mean not striving for accuracy. But I think the next expectation that single stories hold to potential to “end” anyone/anything is part of the problem here.

The irony!!! https://t.co/RydhvZ4aYy
@katherinemiller For sure! I think it’s generally bad to treat politics this way.
When I was a teen I went on a class trip to Orlando, Florida and did a bunch of flirting and running around. But the backdrop was Busch Gardens, not advocating against women’s reproductive rights
@katherinemiller https://t.co/kTApztSlbi
And yes, every event attended by teens has some of this. But the March for Our Lives events from last year - which, crucially, were planned by teens - had a marketedly different tone
@howtojapanese Agree 100%
The videos are what happens when that attitude collides with real people for whom “politics” means life &amp; death, survival &amp; lifetimes of suffering. They have no idea what they’ve done. No explanation will shift what they’ve internalized their entire life. That’s the deep sadness.
But it fosters a mindset in which “politics” is wholly deracinated from the people they affect. It’s a social event, a game in which MAGA hats are the uniform and Make America Great Again is a rally chant like a basketball game.
But that scenario creates an environment in which “politics” is the backdrop for play, for posturing and showing off. This is possible - at least at that point in their lives - because they are not directly affected by the politics they’re advocating for.
When I covered the March for Life two years ago, I was struck by how much of it is composed of kids treating it as a field trip: the school goes every year; you come along to flirt and have fun with your friends and other teens. Marching for Life is an afterthought.

@alexcho47 wow!
@c_smrstik My Minnesotan grandpa did three years of college on the GI Bill. My Nebraskan granddad went to four years of private college in his small town.
@staceyNYCDC The stuff about Princeton in this article, whooooeeeee
@anitasvv What did you do to work through grad school?
@c_smrstik The GI Bill really shifted that, and many people responding to the question have grandparents who benefitted from it.
"Most universities discouraged blacks from matriculating, and official or unofficial quotas existed at those places that did admit blacks. As a result, during the 1940s the number of blacks who sought admission to predominantly white colleges remained small."
@tjmahr question includes "grandparents didn't go." it's meant to trace progression if it exists.
"Although in the abstract the government would pay tuition, that was of little help to blacks who could not enter college, either because of overcrowding at black colleges or inadequate preparation for college-level work."
"The GI Bill afforded a generation of working-class Americans an unprecedented opportunity to earn a college degree, and served for many as a lever into economic security. At the same time, the university came to define and ensure the ongoing production of a white middle class"
"A recent study...estimates that military personnel who used their benefits to complete a college degree or vocational training program earned an average of $10,000 to $15,000 more annually than those who had not." Now think about those who were allowed to use their benefits.
Lots to learn here: "Never a Level Playing Field: Blacks and the GI Bill"		https://t.co/U19c9H5LfV		(DM me for a PDF!)
An important point from my research of the history of student debt: the GI bill allowed hundreds of thousands of returned vets to be the first in their family's to attend college. But 79% of black vets lived in the South — where very few colleges were open to black students

@aurabogado Definitely not intending to derail. I’m trying to listen and acknowledge where the piece failed.
@e_alexjung @aurabogado @TianaClarkPoet No reason other than space, which is a bad one. Certainly could’ve cut some of my blathering to expand the aperature more. There’s so much more to write and I hope a lot of us get to do it.
@aurabogado @TianaClarkPoet I do think that we're all(ish) experiencing burnout as an umbrella term. The contours of that experience vary and absolutely matter
@aurabogado @TianaClarkPoet If this were an academic essay, I'd have included the graf where I'd say "much more scholarship is needed on the particulars of burnout amongst people who are not white and middle-class" and I should've included that, in non-academic language, in my piece
@aurabogado It's a totally valid criticism. I responded/retweeted @TianaClarkPoet's points earlier re: this very thing. Hopefully there will be more and more decentering of the white middle-class experience of burnout   https://t.co/qgweThmM3j

@literary_lottie How is the character of Hannah framed in the books?
@LJmysticowl The stakes re: fight with Ellen were so unclear/so poorly fleshed out
@literary_lottie I don't think they wrote it FOR a Christian audience; I think it was written in a way that it could become a film that Christians and Mormons could consume
@LJmysticowl My friend and I just wanted a bit of clarification — what would make all the drag queens train/make clothes for these girls? Mentorship usually requires a bit more of a push
@literary_lottie @MlleKitty Everything about Hannah as a character is left open to interpretation, which is something that movies often do when they don't want an "explicitly" queer character
@literary_lottie As someone who has consumed a fair amount of content targeted towards Christian demos, there's a certain way they hold back on and/or don't make certain issues explicit (the F-bomb ruins this theory, though)

Using this language is not just about attempting not to alienate your conservative base; it's about contributing to a long history that has sanitized and normalized white supremacy. You can't read this piece and not acknowledge as much.
This entire piece strikes me as such a productive application of literary theory and historical methods
"Such phrases turn oppression into a neutral condition. “Gender-tinged,” for example, suggests the infusion of gender into an issue but ignores the question of power—in Trumpian terms, of who grabs whom."
"Imagine if, after Donald Trump’s Access Hollywood tape became public, the press had referred to Trump’s “gender-tinged” comments or claimed that he had “escalated” gender or that he was a “gender provocateur”?"
"During the civil rights movement, most politicians abandoned explicitly racist appeals, insisting on ‘states’ rights’ when they meant ‘white rights’ and decrying ‘federal intervention’ when they meant ‘integration.’"
"Given this historical context, what on the left has been so often treated as Trump’s radical departure from political norms comes into focus as the terminal outcome of mainstreaming the color-blind language of post–civil rights white supremacy."
"The language of “tinged” and “charged” suggests that race can be overemphasized and exaggerated, but elides the fact that any biological notion of race is a fiction, while racism is a very real language of power."
"Something similar is at work in the use of euphemisms which suggest that race is a fact—something that can be highlighted in a neutral way—rather than an ideology, a tool of oppression."
"The scientifically incoherent concept of “race” becomes real through such speech acts, which serve to stabilize “race” as a reality rather than denaturalize it as a social construction."

@AdamSerwer I'm glad you're picking up what I'm putting down here Adam
The weirdest thing about having a Ph.D./having read literally hundreds of books in your field is realizing that there are other equally important fields in which you have read no books
@dparkermontana It is in the massive pile RIGHT NOW!
Anyway reading books is great, I highly recommend it
White voters w/high levels of racial resentment = voted overwhelmingly for Trump regardless of education.		White voters with low levels of racial resentment = voted overwhelmingly for Clinton regardless of education
@feministlib I would love to read it!
This zinger! 		"There is no evidence here, after we control for other predictors, that voters who were struggling economically were more likely to support Trump. Much of the apparent relationship b/t social class &amp; Trump support seems to have been mediated by racial resentment.”
All part of a strategy to keep luring white voters away from the Democratic Party. By 2016, racial resentment was "pervasive" amongst GOP voters. Enter: a candidate whose message focused on white racial resentment
But didn't start with Obama. Over 30 yrs, proportion of white voters scoring on high end of racial resentment scale rose 42% -&gt; 51%. Obama was part of it, but so was ongoing GOP framing of Dems as soft on crime, pro policies that benefited minorities at expense of whites.
Abramowitz is also very clear-eyed no-bullshit about what motivated Trump voters: racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment racial resentment
It is so hard for me to imagine a time when abortion wasn't a deeply partisan issue and yet!!!!!
Also revelatory that anti-abortion stance didn't become part of GOP plank until 1980 — it wasn't until then, and the years that followed, that those who were against abortion began to shift, en masse, to identifying as conservative and GOP
I realize a lot of this is old hat to people who studied political history but all new to me! Explains so much re: network fetishization of the swing voter: 1960s-'80s, nearly every state could swing one way or another. Red state/blue state logic just didn't work.
-In the 93rd Congress (1973-1975), 24 states had split party senate delegations. In 2017-2019, only 12 states had split-party delegations. 		-In 2012, only *47* out of 435 House districts were won by a margin of less than 5 points. The rest were considered "safe."
- In 1968, 20% of Democrats voted for Richard Nixon. The next 20 years were the heyday of ticket splitting — 26% would split their ticket between the president and congress.
- Back in the 1950s, Dems and GOP were not divided by gender, marital status or religiosity. 		Among voters who reported going to church regularly, Democrats outnumbered Republicans, 54% to 39%
-In 2012, there was a 90% rate of straight-ticket voting between president and senate candidates		Which explains the fact that only ~12% of Americans now fall into the "pure independent" category (would love to see % of that 12% that lives in Montana)

@DaveMazella And yes, the "winning" strategy for Dems in Texas is definitely to battle gerrymandering and voter suppression and activate voters who aren't white Evangelicals. But this piece groups rural NYT-interview Trump voters w/the Dallas Beto voters; very different ideological stances

@charlsiekate Were they conservatives or Evangelical conservatives?
@charlsiekate Men are much more interested than women, I find
And I don't think it's going away, even if Trump is voted out of office. So I do think there's a difference between reporting on those women &amp; reporting on a Trump voter in a diner who takes great pleasure in telling a national outlet that he doesn't regret his vote, not one bit.
But again: these women have been told their whole lives that ending abortion should supersede all else, even treating others like God's children. So yes, it's a difficult to persuade them. But Trump has widened a wedge between those who are certain and those who are seeking.
White Christian women are largely insulated from the effects of Trump/GOP policies, but they're also more likely to do charity/relief/outreach work with people who ARE affected, whether refugees or families from their children's schools.
(Unless they're the type of Christian who believes that Jesus taught his followers to care about others, not just you and yours.....but that's increasingly thought of as "liberal")
White Christian men are more likely to be fine with that certainly because 1) they can't see any reason abortion shouldn't be banned; 2) none of the other Trump/GOP policies affect them personally.
That ideology is so strong, so immersive. It takes so much to even *contemplate* pulling away from. So you have those who choose to reside in that certainty, no matter what a candidate does (see: Trump), and you have others who are torn apart by it (see: Trump).
It's hard for anyone who didn't grow up Evangelical to understand, but imagine being told your whole life, by every person who you've trusted, that the most important fight is ending abortion. It supersedes all else. And if you allow it, you're damned too.
And yes there are more of the former than the latter. But grouping them together in this way erases a meaningful distinction.
Agree with a lot of the argument here re: difficulty of "converting" Trump voters, but anyone who's spent time with Evangelical/Christian Trump voters know there's two types: the ideologically certain and the ideologically seeking.		https://t.co/i1hw0jrYWp

There are, uh, some echoes here. The KKK created a committee that discovered that 85% of Butte teachers were Catholic. Suggested legislation that would mandate "native-born" teachers.
It wasn't necessarily because Butte was anti-racism; the KKK was deeply anti-Catholic and immigrant and Butte was deeply both. Leaders of the Butte KKK: all middle/upper class. Vice-principals. Auto-dealers. Lawyers. Doctors.

@wr_reaction I'm not! I'm saying it's part of a larger ecosystem. I taught hundreds of students who went on to careers in television and film. You want those programs, you need people to teach them.
@wr_reaction So we'll be a society of scientists, no art whatsoever?
@SelbJim What if the government decided, after he put in his six years, that he needed to put in another six years? What if they radically changed the terms of the agreement set forth half way through? Then you get a feeling for how people feel about loan forgiveness.
@wr_reaction Hey buddy, not asking you to feel bad for me. What PhD could I go into debt for that you wouldn't think is stupid?
@E_Davis_Romance Or one third!
@jessicapancakes I knew so little and I had parents with graduate degrees. Who should mentor and advise us? Well, our professors. But they were dealing with a different calculus when they went to school. I didn't realize I shouldn't trust their advise.
The real problem is that hundreds of programs like mine are sold as "fully funded." https://t.co/jsFw9KH9JD

@tweetingmouse I'd had a GREAT union at University of Oregon and was just flabbergasted by what UT got away with because of right-to-work
@AlexParkerDC How else to frame it? "Well, the government will go back on its promise...."
@tweetingmouse it all depends on the department. RTF at UT was just super cheap.
Don't go to an unfunded MA program in the humanities unless you have family money. That's my bottom line. https://t.co/3Lg2MWxIGk
@E_Davis_Romance I'm sure we were charged that as well
Last year, 30,000 people applied for loan forgiveness. They'd followed the parameters put in place in 2007: work in public service, pay a percentage of your income every month towards the loan. Only *96* people were approved.		https://t.co/EU7KYBOU0X

@prettyrickyroo I have many complicated feelings too. How’d you feel about EVERY ACADEMIC doing it?

@sarahlovescali Thinking about this piece this morning and wondering: could a woman be a Badger? I think I know a She-Badger.
@mariabustillos Oh that's interesting! I did not read it that way, but reading it again, I can see it.
@mariabustillos To me, the piece isn't about the position of speaker of the house at all but more broadly about the gap between how we theoretically think about women in power and how we actually speak/think about them
@mariabustillos I hear what you're saying. I do think that animus towards Pelosi is sometimes similar to that towards Cruz, in so much of some people who feel it really don't know why they loathe that person, just that they do. And somehow those people seem to be powerful women more than men.
If you think this is going after people on the left with substantive articulated criticisms of Pelosi you're reading it wrong

@MelLenhardt @theshapeofform Read the article above!!!!!!
Which extends to 4) We've been taught to optimize every part of our lives, making each activity more efficient. There's nothing efficient about romance or (good) sex. 		Don't @ me with your own contrary arguments unless you've read the article, weirdos
It meant less drinking, but also less time for relationships, and as the piece notes, the most sex happens within actual relationships, not within short-term hook-ups.
Okay and 3) When I came back to teach at the liberal arts school that I attended, we always joked that the students were FAR more serious than we ever were. Part of that is streamlined, helicopter parent-assisted, young millenial SUCCESS AT ALL COSTS tunnel-vision.
2) Desire is often a product of absence. When you're never "away" (always texting, always accessible), it's more difficult to cultivate. Which is why writing/receiving letters, waiting for someone to call...it's agonizing, but also created different calculus of desire
@theshapeofform I dunno, bad and painful sex has been around for a long time before either of those things. I think that's part of it, for sure! But women going along with bad sex is not a new phenomenon
That sentiment was not unique to the '90s in Idaho. I often think of how different my life would've been if I could've felt less lonely by finding people like me on the internet, but I also would've spent less time just hanging out, riding in cars, killing that boredom
Julian covers this in some ways, but two things immediately stuck out to me: 		1) When I was a teen in a small town, we had so little to do that sneaking out, hooking up, whatever, was really a way to relieve the boredom. It had less to do with desire than having something to do.
The sex recession piece is very good and complicated! Resists any easy conclusion! Only complaint is connotation of "recession" is generally negative even though less sex is not that bad, because less sex right now also means less bad/painful/unwanted sex		https://t.co/NTYqBvulA4

@JasonLeavitt No, it's a district — Ben McAdams meat Mia Love. This is a congressional map.
@k1ug3 I mean (relatively) newly blue. Idaho used to have a Democrat as governor, up until 1994!
@Bouje99 Montana v. different than Utah or Idaho

@LaurieBaucum I remember watching the turnout numbers there and thinking SOMETHING IS HAPPENING
Anyway I spent 2 am to 3 am thinking about this and how it's going to complicate / add to arguments about urban/rural divide; would love your thoughts as well
Colorado, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Eastern Washington....New Mexico, Arizona, Texas. The blue (urban) dots get bigger, a la Colorado, with population influx from young liberals priced out of cities....as the red areas (more rural) get brighter red, largely with conservative retirees
Montana, also poised to gain a congressional seat, this census or next. If they divide it West/East, which seems probable, v. strong chance the Western Rep would reliably be Dem (even with the bright red of the Flathead Valley figured into the mix)
Idaho is "bright red," but home to Boise, the fastest growing city in the US. This census or next, there'll be another congressional district. GOP legislature can try to bisect Boise, but there will be uproar. And Boise narrowly voted for Paulette Jordan (D) over Brad Little.
I've been thinking a lot about that newly blue section in the middle of Utah on the congressional map, and what it suggests about the future of the bright red states around it https://t.co/QjqBpmr5Vy

I say this in my piece, but one of the things that allowed the Beto campaign to really expand its operation over the last 3 months was all that national $$, which they used to pay organizers, many of them young, who couldn’t afford to do the work without pay
And there’s small stuff. Like the fact that the Beto Ambassador shirts were white (hard for many moms to keep clean!) and nearly see-through. 		It’s small stuff but it’s also something campaigns should be thinking about: how do you make volunteering possible?
One of the biggest issues: the shifts at a lot of the official HQs were in three hour blocks that overlapped directly with school pickup/dropoff. Much harder for moms who stayed at home to commit to a shift.
A little string from my reporter’s notebook: most of the official Beto campaign people running the show were under 30. You get a lot of energy and fresh ideas that way, but not a ton of insight into the way the lives of the bulk of your (older women) volunteers work.

There's a way to say all these things in a way that's infantilizing and deeply frustrating and then there's the way that he does it. Hard to describe it any other way than that he never presumes that I don't know what I'm talking about.
He also encourages me to keep writing, tells me I'm working hard, and that he appreciates me. Sometimes his email subject lines are just "It's a beautiful day in Elmo, Montana." He is like peak email dad.
There's a older guy in Montana who reads my stuff. Emails me every few wks. But unlike truly EVERY OTHER DUDE READER WHO EMAILS ME, never tries to tell me what I got wrong, or mansplains what I got right. He just tells me what's going on in his corner of MT. It's truly wonderful.

I've lived in Mountain West states with a lot of tribes, and while there are still A WHOLE LOT OF MONTANANS who are racist as shit against Natives, Montana is the 1st state where it feels like Natives actually have a seat at the table (as they fucking should, are you kidding me)
And one of the reasons the Native Vote remains powerful in Montana: reservations have not been gerrymandered in a way that prevents representation. There's a robust Native caucus in the state legislature.
I was on Fort Belknap reservation earlier this year, and the tribe had decided to make voter registration and turnout one of its main priorities. When you don't have a state legislature intent on disenfranchising you, the Native Vote is incredibly powerful.
And part of how this all happened: Native Vote. Look at those Native Vote County Turnouts: 		Lake County: 70.17%	Big Horn County: 57.15%	Glacier County: 57.79%	Blaine County: 71.42%	Hill County: 68.8%	Roosevelt County: 52%

Beto, to huge cheers: “I wanna thank this amazing campaign. In every single part of Texas, showing the rest of the country how we do this. I’m so fucking proud of you guys!”
Beto: “We’re not going to define ourselves by what we’re scared of.”
Beto takes the stage here in El Paso. “I’m as inspired, as hopeful, as I’ve ever been. And tonight’s loss does nothing to diminish my hopes for Texas, or this country.”
Band here in El Paso, to big cheers: “You doing alright? There’s a bigger picture, right? Who knows where we’re going. But I will say that my friend Beto works harder than anyone I’ve ever seen in my life. And he’s an inspiration to me, and I know he’s an inspiration to you.”
