@AndrewPollackFL @RonDeSantis This is a nice gesture, but What will the governor do for the other religions represented by the people in Florida?

@AndrewPollackFL @browardsheriff @AWRHawkins @BreitbartNews Whenever the sheriff Israel stated on CNN that the department had many accomplishments (in response to the dept.'s handling of  the Parkland massacre), I was too through...
@AndrewPollackFL @ScottforFlorida Congratulations Mr. Pollack! I hope your advocacy will be nonpartisan.
@AndrewPollackFL @realDonaldTrump @BetsyDeVosED I disagree with the rescinded policies...

@SteveSchmidtSES Yes, we are all in this together. I have a wary sense of dread...
@AndrewPollackFL As a former school principal, I started creating an exit strategy after the Sandy Hook Massacre because the municipalities don't want to pay for the necessary resources to fortify schools, and provide school resource officers for all schools. I'm sorry for the loss of your baby.

@AndrewPollackFL I agree the murderer of your beautiful daughter should not be allowed to vote. However, Corruption flows on both sides and unfortunately, it’s not a liberal or conservative thing, it’s a human thing...

@blackvoices @RealDLHughley Painful but necessary 😢 My Son is nearly 29, and I never stop interceding for him 💜
@RealCandaceO Yes this country is racist, and it’s being used as a tool for continued class warfare.
@SebGorka He’s not that well trained, he voted for Kavanaugh...

@NicoleCNN @CNN 😢
I never really enjoyed the presidency of Barack Obama because first, I thought he would be assassinated, and because I knew there would be hell to pay for having a president of color. The consequences of his presidency are worse than I ever imagined...😢
@SebGorka 😂😂
@ScottAdamsSays Just like our leader, correct?
@SebGorka 😳
@yashar 😂
@SebGorka 👎🏾
@SebGorka 😂
@FDRLST 😂
@costareports Then why is he voting yes for Kavanaugh? I don’t want to hear it...

@JamilSmith Yep I have a headache 😢
@perlmutations It is happening here in real time...😢
@ChuckGrassley 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
As a woman of color I am disappointed, but not surprised by Collin’s decision. It’s frustrating that all women do not stick together. I guess the majority of the women of color will continue  to suffer in silence...😢

@charliekirk11 You misrepresent history: The Democrats during this time frame are today’s Republicans.	Have you forgotten what happened in 1964?

@prisonculture The Silent Strength who often suffers in silence...
As a woman of color, often times my gender is secondary to my race, in terms of dealing with sexism and racism. It’s exhausting and frustrating. 	But I try to stay hopeful and generate positive thoughts continuously for me and mine.
Moral leadership is the key to sustainability, vibrancy, mutual respect &amp; hope.
@DiamondandSilk @SebGorka Your tweet doesn’t make sense: Aren’t you ladies aware that the Democrats during slavery are today’s Republican Party? Read History much???
@ABCPolitics 👍🏾

My husband and I are of color, recently while driving from Tampa Area to KY via route 75 (Appalachia), we stopped for gas and the following occurred: I was stared at with disdain for being there to use the restroom, and my 6-2 husband was thrown shade by a midget...Racism 2017

@peterdaou I respectfully disagree. The DNC establishment and the ignoring of Sander's voters put Trump in the White House. I am a dem who voted for HC
@Mikel_Jollett @joncoopertweets Lol
@JoyAnnReid @GiannoCaldwell @AmandiOnAir Gianno  started to make a good point about some Democrats and their institutional racism. He  should have been given time to finish!
