@BrandonBG_ if this is where your heart lies, i feel bad for you: being spox of the dnc is putting lipstick on a pig‚Äîand i'm a registered democrat.
@BrandonBG_ i don't see your name anywhere on this document, but i'll take your word for it that you were involved, in 2017.  i'm familiar with the agenda of the congressional black caucus‚Äîtoo bad it doesn't have much of a say in the agenda of the democratic party.
@BrandonBG_ what have you done, in all your time with the dnc, about the fact that it has not done anything significant to directly address poverty, in decades?  it took bernie sanders and others on the left to push a $15 min. wage, which is barely even adequate, adjusting for inflation.
@BrandonBG_ the statement says nothing; it's the most anodyne, nondescript piece of bureaucratese imaginable‚Äîdesigned to dull the mind and suspend further thought.  tell me: what did you, personally, as a human being who'd lived in poverty, do about the dnc's quashing of the poverty council?
@BrandonBG_ but i'm so glad you could still spare the time and energy to get righteously indignant about this‚Äîat *me*.
@BrandonBG_ jfc, if i had to do this kind of thing, for a living, i'd be dead inside, too.

@BMStudebaker if we can't get a sanders presidency, we have to take a new dem presidency and keep applying pressure.  another round of trump is just not an option (even if mueller et al. weren't a factor).  the republic might not survive it.	8/
@BMStudebaker but, as i've gotten older, &amp; suffered many defeats, as well as victories, i've come to understand that sometimes, when you can't get the dramatically transformative change you want, you have to settle for incremental change‚Äîas long as it's in the same direction.	7/
@BMStudebaker i hate to say this, because it might sound condescending‚Äîwhich is not at all my intention‚Äîbut you think and speak with the passion of the young‚Äîwhich is admirable, in its own way: you want to fix it right, NOW.  there's much to be said for that approach.  it fires up the soul.	6/
@BMStudebaker educational systems have been gutted, so that a good chunk of kids don't really know what the civil war was fought for.  this isn't a public that will be long able to protect the benefits that a left-wing government can bring, against the assaults of the reactionary machine.	5/
@BMStudebaker i'm not optimistic about what a president sanders could do, in the absence of a willing congress, to bring about the re-alignment you seek. &amp; there's so much work to do, it feels overwhelming. the koch bros are in our schools, our news&amp;entertainment media‚Äîthey're everywhere.	4/
@BMStudebaker one side is playing full court press‚Äîand it ain't our side.  survey after survey shows the public to be, on the whole, largely ignorant of policy issues/positions &amp; outcomes, &amp; apathetic about just about everything that doesn't immediately/dramatically impact them.	3/
@BMStudebaker you must also have the electorate for the re-alignment you propose.  it's not enough for a (small or large) majority of the american people to wishy-washy support leftist policy X‚Äîwhen their tepid support is up against strong corporate opposition.	2/
@BMStudebaker you haven't made that case, persuasively.  you seem committed to the idea that change must be dramatic and fundamental‚Äîthat it can't, sometimes, be gradual.  but the lessons of history teach us that it moves from the bottom up, as much as from the top, down.	1/
@djquantum78 @realDonaldTrump he doesn't read.
@BMStudebaker &amp; at any rate, what matter as much, or more, is how congressional races are decided, both at the state &amp; fed level.  if AOC is a sign of things to come, a beto presidency isn't going to look like an obama presidency, no matter what new dems might want.
@BMStudebaker the political landscape, vis a vis, the left, is not the same as it was, when obama was elected.  the left wouldn't dissolve if beto were to get elected; he'd face pressure from this constituency.  note how all the "centrists" have been forced to move left ($15 min wage), etc.
@BMStudebaker i'm as pro-bernie as they come &amp; totally agree w/your assessment of the crop of "young" dems, in your other article, but this false equivalence of centrist dems w/ the most reactionary republicans (or, in your case, a decided preference for trump) is ridiculous &amp; has got to stop.
@BMStudebaker are you nuts? they're putting kids in cages, ffs.  his judicial appointments will dog us into the grandkids' generation.  he's unraveling our international alliances, disemboweling the federal workforce, &amp; destroying the environment.  he's running the country into the ground. https://t.co/1gCrvIJwCa

@capell_william @Libericks LOL, this isn't a competition.  as for not attacking liberals, you accused them (unjustly, i think) of hypocrisy, which is a kind of attack.	https://t.co/NBYYtHPECi
@capell_william @Libericks basically human decency does not prevent others from attacking your worldview, if the occasion seems to call for it (which, from my perspective, it did).  &amp; if you think twitter is a medium for basic human decency, you haven't been paying attention.
@capell_william @Libericks no, not at all.  i simply said i never made a claim to compassion, as you have done, in your bio.  which, i would add, seems to be in direct contradiction with your avowed views on "liberals".
@capell_william @Libericks and why would you expect that, on twitter?
@capell_william @Libericks william, all you have to do is not tweet back.  i never made any claims to great compassion.  read my "bio".
@capell_william @Libericks i'd also strongly urge you to rethink your political allegiances.  republicans/ conservatives aren't going to do diddly squat to help you get better.
@capell_william @Libericks i applaud you for your choice to live a life of service to others and i'm sorry if you're experiencing undue anxiety from our conversation. but, if you expected to find no pushback from me, i think your expectations were unrealistic.
@capell_william @Libericks https://t.co/uIyuGem6Th
@capell_william @Libericks just to remind you: you're not the only person on this thread.  if you wish to leave the discussion, you are free to do so.
@capell_william @Libericks no, but it's implied in your criticism of democrats and liberals in not caving in to trump's demands for funding for his wall.  the only way to avoid the shutdown would be to give trump $5b for his wall.  (btw, don't you think that $$$ would be better spent on me/cfs research?)
@capell_william @Libericks and how did you, yourself, an arab, come to the US?  how could you not have deep sympathy for the others who are hoping for the same things?
@capell_william @Libericks and your doctors are all american born&amp;bred, trained, in turn, by american doctors?  not likely.  our medical system would collapse without immigrant infusion.  even the european americans came from somewhere else.
@capell_william @Libericks it makes no sense to blame democrats for a government shut-down, unless you believe trump's desire for a wall is justified.  i'm not "contacting" you, i'm responding to your tweets, to me, on a thread, established by others.
@capell_william @Libericks i said nothing about the legal status of your care providers.  but i know the composition of the field well enough to know that it is made up mostly by immigrants.  this isn't rocket science.
@capell_william @Libericks why do you want a wall, especially, as trump's xenophobic rhetoric has been specifically targeted at arabs &amp; he has sold the wall as a way of keeping middle-easterners out?  btw, "some of my best friends are X" doesn't cut it.
@capell_william @Libericks why do you want a wall?
@capell_william @Libericks if u r really sick, u r massively dependent on others 2 care 4 u. if you have paid care workers, chances r they're immigrants. u literally depend on ppl who've escaped their home 4 ur moment-2-moment care. how u could avoid having deep sympathy 4 them is a head-scratcher 2 me.
@capell_william @Libericks i get that you support trump's wall, for whatever reason.  only people who have a sense of superiority over the desperate refugees, seeking asylum, would.
@capell_william @Libericks i'm sorry to have to say this, but this is a cop-out, all around.  you don't have to discuss the gory details of your wealth (i'm not really interested in that, anyway)‚Äîwhat i'm trying to understand is how you can square the circle in your worldview.
@capell_william @Libericks i don't understand how you can hang to your sense of superiority &amp; xenophobia when mother nature has taught you what should have been a very humbling lesson about where you belong in the natural order of things.  maybe you can help me understand.
@capell_william @Libericks b4 i got sick, i took care of others, ppl with no other options, at the hospital of last resort.  if ur holding out for a trtmnt or cure for me/cfs, it's going to come from ppl like me.
@capell_william @Libericks i'm not speaking strictly on welfare, either: the whole biomedico-research infrastructure in our country is largely run &amp; maintained on essentially "liberal" principles.  it is staffed disproportionately by immigrants &amp; 1st gen americans.  i am one of them.
@capell_william @Libericks sorry to hear that. are you well off enough, financially, to embrace such reactionary politics as this?  i have a hard time squaring your status as a disabled person with the political posture you've articulated. most pwme are dependent on the gov't &amp; others to help them get by.

@So_Much_ToLearn that's grit.
https://t.co/c86UNm7m94
@So_Much_ToLearn i don't know precisely what you mean by ptsd (my training is in psych, so i understand ptsd as a very specific clinical entity), but i know there's nothing like feeling better to make you feel better‚Äîand nothing like having energy to enable you to deal with life's problems.
@So_Much_ToLearn there is now concrete evidence of cytokine and other blood abnormalities, more solid (irrefutable) evidence of brain inflammation, and serious progress toward identifying a biomarker‚Äîto name just a few advances.
@So_Much_ToLearn i don't know the spec's of ur history &amp; don't know where you've gone online for info about what's new in research, but i've been a clinician &amp; researcher for some years &amp;, based on my training/experience, i'd say the speed of the progress being made in the last year is fantastic.
@So_Much_ToLearn and, thereafter, throughout their careers, receive updates in best practices &amp; standards of care, based on information generated, compiled and analyzed in academic institutions.  modern medicine, for all its failings, is a arm‚Äîhowever long‚Äîof academia.	2/
@So_Much_ToLearn you're mischaracterizing my position.  i never described things in such stark, all-or-nothing terms.  i would never describe physicians as "bottom feeders".  for one, i'm a physician, myself.  but doctors are made in academia: they get their training in academic institutions	1/
@So_Much_ToLearn now, the fact that serious scientists in major institutions are actively researching this illness puts a whole new perspective on its legitimacy.   this is what it takes to turn the tide and change the conversation away from actively destructive ideas like PACE/GET.
@So_Much_ToLearn exactly.  all hail jen!  but, even with her tireless effort, one documentary, alone, wouldn't have done it.  it's taken the internet to make the film go "viral" &amp; start to change the conversation.  but, even there, it wouldn't have had the same traction w/o support from academia.
@So_Much_ToLearn here's a link to the symposium website:	https://t.co/17AL81d5b7	make sure to watch ron phair's presentation and ron davis', afterwards:	https://t.co/3zBYr8UOae
@So_Much_ToLearn sure you do.  disability advocates are using online social networks to spread the word, connect with others, and advance their agenda.  @jenbrea and @MEActNet, for example.
@So_Much_ToLearn you also have to remember, apropos of an earlier comment you made, that not everyone is in as functional a place as you are, able to get by on one's own wits.  so, for many pwme, every little bit of news, however small, is a glimmer of hope and a reason to keep living.
@So_Much_ToLearn i get that.  but it's the nature of research to move our knowledge forward, however slowly, even in fits &amp; starts.  budgets have been shoestring, but the omf has raised something like $17M (if i remember correctly) &amp; ron davis just got a ~$4M nih grant.	https://t.co/oCrGWZb4VI
@So_Much_ToLearn did you watch the omf symposium, this year, esp. ron davis and his collaborators, esp. their kynurenine metabolic trap theory?  davis thinks that, if they're right, they should be on to a treatment within a couple of years.  i think that's cause for hope.

@So_Much_ToLearn oh, yes, i do!  most pwme don't have much of a choice but to "sit around" and wait for someone else to fix this problem‚Äîbut, fortunately, research has yielded stunning new results, which means treatment/cure is within a few years' reach.  you must follow @OpenMedF, asap.
@So_Much_ToLearn i agree.  it sucks to interact with people and system that does not take our disease seriously.  but it does not follow that, just because you were able to figure things out, others will be, too.  some are much too disabled.
@So_Much_ToLearn the fact that more people are taking this disease seriously has almost everything to do with the fact that academia has given me/cfs research its imprimatur.	2/
@So_Much_ToLearn to the contrary: what academia does has tremendous impact on you.  academia is the source of most of the information that practitioners, like doctors, get about their field.  academia sets the standard for intellectual inquiry and scientific research.	1/

@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS @microbeminded2 research into the trtmnt of AIDS is taking a similarly multi-pronged approach: we have antimicrobials that, in combination, work against HIV replication; there's research on a vaccine; &amp; others are looking at allo-transplants, gene editing &amp; other host modification techniques.	8/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS @microbeminded2 in a way, this is a good thing.  because, while it might have stymied researchers &amp; complicated efforts to find the cause of me/cfs, it means there are multiple possible paths to effective treatment: one is by controlling the triggering agent; 2, by controlling host responses.	7/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS @microbeminded2 it will turn out that host characteristics play a major role in disease expression‚Äîafter all, many people exposed in each of the documented "outbreaks" did NOT come down w/disease.  so, again, this issue of host traits, which you think is a waste of time, will turn out 2b key.	6/

@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS @microbeminded2 to the best of my knowledge, it's not a settled fact, among researchers (like ron or mike davis, both at stanford) that me or me/cfs is "caused" by a novel virus. (not that they're not looking.)  but the epidemiology isn't as clear-cut, as you think, that the trigger is:	4/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS @microbeminded2 the reason we're not all breaking out with MRSA infxn is b/c our immune systems &amp; microbiome keep these organisms in check.  it's too bad you find the discussion tedious, because this whole area is really a major forefront in current microbiology/ infectious disease research.	3/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS &amp;, as @microbeminded2 &amp; others have pointed out, even the activity of an identified pathogen is subject 2 modulation by the relevant host environment, especially the microbiome.  many of us are, by now, colonized w/ MRSA &amp; other *potentially* highly pathogenic strains of germ.	2/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS a few points: it's more complicated than the host needs to be "infected" w/the causative agent.  "infection", in this context, is a loaded word, &amp; can encompass a wide range of host responses &amp; presentations, from asymptomatic to mild, self-limited illness, to florid disease.	1/

@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS both conditions must be met, before AIDS manifests itself.  me/cfs is almost certainly similar: there's a trigger, but host conditions must be right for the illness to manifest.  7/
@TerriDNW @lkwhite @SpeakerVos the fact that a man from the other party got elected.  now he has to scramble for explanations/justifications for the power grab.  but, as we can see, he's not good at either.  and he's the speaker!
@microbeminded2 @oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS i hope it's better, now, though, i can't say.  i'm not in that area, anymore.
@microbeminded2 @oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS i'd say, even the initial presentation of illness will vary from person 2 person.  which is why, back in the day, before rapid PCR, (i know i'm dating myself) it was so hard for doctors to recognize acute HIV infection.  there also was a higher threshold for ordering the test.

@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS so, if you want to think more broadly about the "causes" of AIDS, the answer is: yes, AIDS has multiple causes.  one of them is exposure to the HIV virus‚Äîand the other is the proper host milieu (eg, HLA type, receptors, etc.) for the virus to propagate.  6/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS even hiv isn't 100% contagious.  there's a small group of people, called elite controllers, who don't come down with hiv diz after they're exposed.  they're a fascinating group &amp; have much to teach us about infection propagation, in general, &amp; hiv transmission, in particular.  5/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS but semi-coherent way, is the constellation of symptoms, the symptom profile.  that leads researchers to conclude that the most proximate cause, the common denominator, lies with the host.  which is true for almost every disease we've ever studied, including infectious dizs.  4/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS yet even more complex, situation: we have a constellation of symptoms (analogous to a flu-like presentation) with multiple different types of identified triggers: some infectious, some, not.  there are epidemic cases and isolated cases.  what ties them together, in a complex 3/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS of flu-like illnesses, the situation gets even more complex.  in the absence of positive serology/titers, tons and tons of episodes get called "flu" that really aren't, in the sense that the causative agent is not a flu virus.  with me/cfs, we have an analogous, 2/
@oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS "flu" has an epidemic nature, but yet, with multiple causes: different strains of flu virus, each of which is not serocompatible with the others (which is why we need to keep ahead of each flu epidemic with our vaccine development).  if you think more broadly,
@HHV6_University @oslersweb @MBVanElzakker @julierehmeyer @minadjenkins @moniquedhooghe @MTackCVS u don't do yourself any favors, nor attract a scientifically literate following, by calling it the "fauci &amp; gallo crime syndicate".  anyone who's engaged in significant biomedical work, who understands what's involved w/ scientific research, will look at that &amp; run the other way.

@exceedhergrasp1 @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @Rivkatweets @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ well, there you go.  so your response to the mucuna dopa might not be about the dopa.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @Rivkatweets @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ serotonin also has powerful "autonomic" effects, especially in sensitive folks, like pwme.  it can cause lightheadedness, dizziness, sweating, jitteriness/tremor, temperature rise‚Äîall kinds of goodies.
@exceedhergrasp1 @Rivkatweets @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ no, you're right.  you have to know what you're looking for to realize you're parkinsonian.  i'm a doc and it took me long enough.  this is part of why i have great disdain for the endless squabbling over definitional criteria: it's a great big waste of time and resources.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @Rivkatweets @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ quick check on wikipedia reveals the seeds contain trace amounts of other stuff, including serotonin.  this is 1 of the drawbacks w/natural meds: it's hard to get active stuff, pure.  i wouldn't bet on it, but there's still the outside chance you're responding to the other stuff.
@exceedhergrasp1 @Rivkatweets @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ lol thanks!  it helps to have studied the thing for years... ;-)
@exceedhergrasp1 @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @Rivkatweets @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ i'm not familiar with mucuna dopa.  will have to look it up.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @Rivkatweets @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ ok, this part makes more sense:	https://t.co/Zqr2v3UGCj
@Rivkatweets @MBVanElzakker @exceedhergrasp1 @GemzME @jenbrea @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ damage to the circuits that supply the BG with DA cause the movement disorder we call parkinson's disease (PD).  the 1st line treatment for PD is DA.  lots of other diseases, like me/cfs, have parkinsonian features.
@Rivkatweets @MBVanElzakker @exceedhergrasp1 @GemzME @jenbrea @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ long story short: dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter associated with part of the brain called the basal ganglia.  the BG do a lot of things, among them initiate and control volitional behavior; ie, movement.  DA is the neurotransmitter that makes the whole thing go.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MBVanElzakker @GemzME @jenbrea @Rivkatweets @BettineM @PhoenixMe_ interesting.  i'm not sure how basal ganglia dopaminergic circuits could account for those specific, circumscribed effects.  they might be due to some other pathways.  i wonder what more direct dopamine supplementation would do for you.

@davidmichaels @kimgoodwin then, clearly, you are misreading the situation: the lady isn't "complaining", she's sharing her predicament.  and she's not asking for help, because she doesn't want you to solve her problem for her; she just wants an attentive and sympathetic listener, aka a sounding board.

@GeekTalk51 https://t.co/sR2sffpXn5
@MECFSNews so i am very much, both personally and professionally, looking forward to getting the brain circuitry of this phenomenon down.
@MECFSNews which we would not.  interestingly, your cochrane review also found room for significant placebo effects in pain / nausea, conditions highly dependent on the subject's state of expectancy. &amp; we know placebo is highly related to expectancy.
@MECFSNews i haven't looked at this paper, but you can't treat all dizs the same way /use "disease severity" across the board.  there are conditions in which we would expect the placebo effect to be greater (eg, "subjective" mental experiences, like pain &amp; nausea) &amp; others (eg, cancer)
@MECFSNews this is especially true in my own field, psychiatry, where a recent spate of re-evaluations of data on antidepressant efficacy/effect vs. placebo roiled the field, a few years ago.
@MECFSNews i don't know whether i was specifically aware of this review, but i am aware that there are contradictory study conclusions about the degree and significance of the placebo effect.  which, ironically, supports the times article's idea that we need to do more rigorous research.
https://t.co/W1UI86Z2fQ
@MECFSNews btw, as the article points out, the (2x-blind) placebo-controlled trial is the very foundation of modern medical investigation. we'd have no way of knowing which therapeutic interventions work ("better than placebo") &amp; which don't, if we didn't take the placebo effct into account
@MECFSNews and if they do not, then it will open up new questions &amp; venues for research &amp; new hypotheses &amp; new studies, which will, themselves, have to be replicated to be accepted‚Äîalways, advancing our understanding of brain function.
@MECFSNews your handwaving "in some way" also betrays a lack of understanding of brain imaging studies and their interpretation.  hint: it's not tea-leaf reading.  the "way" will have to tie in very well with what we know about the function of the circuits implicated in the studies.
@MECFSNews again, you're wrong about the clinical significance ("meaningful") of the effect.  &amp; where else would you expect to see it, other than the brain?  &amp; why wouldn't it mean anything?  where do you think "thinking" &amp; "feeling" occurs‚Äîout in the ether?	https://t.co/xudZ3efl30
@MECFSNews it's clear you haven't read the article. the placebo effect is real &amp; measurable &amp; has nothing to do with "magical" mind-body effects.  brain function is highly subject to "top-down control" (in information theory &amp; neuroscience parlance), so there's nothing hokey about the idea.

@richardvallee @exceedhergrasp1 @MECFSNews true.  but, fortunately, gov't policy can be changed.  it takes overwhelming science, in the face of overwhelming defeat, but, it does happen.  south africa is an example.  the soviet union, after lysenko, is another.  the cost, though, is always a lot of life and treasure.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MECFSNews you might see it, like in the wakefield/vaccine scandal, when there's official investigations that show outright fraud.  people distance themselves when their licenses and livelihoods are at stake.  so far, that hasn't happened yet.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MECFSNews yes, true.  but medicine also rewards people who don't have that much empathy, to begin with.  i know; i trained with them.  sharpe is way past caring about individual me/cfs patients, if he ever did (which, i doubt).  he has a "legacy" to worry about.
@exceedhergrasp1 @MECFSNews well, some of us have more foibles than others... ;-)	i think your best bet, in trying to change minds, is to go after low-hanging fruit.  you'll never convince someone who has so much at stake, that he's totally wrong.  i bet peter duesberg is still flogging his AIDS theories...
@exceedhergrasp1 @MECFSNews there's no doubt about it, though: he's a bad apple.  don't blame yourself for trying to do something about him.  in the end, it will be the science that stops‚Äîand thoroughly discredits‚Äîthese people.  and it's coming, soon.

@AnneSpaceCoast @MarilynGavrano5 @Wee_Bawbee @GabbyKlein1 @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior no, you are not blocked.  if you could really read, you'd see that i'm also a pwme‚Äî&amp; i'm angry @ the state of things‚Äîboth the med community &amp; the pnt com'ty, 4 piling on advocates like jen.  the rest of your other tweet doesn't make too much sense, so i'll just leave it at that.

@GemzME @erikmoldwarrior @GabbyKlein1 @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea but is that due to the cdc?  i feel like we're moving goalposts.  the original issue was with the cdc as the villain in the me/cfs story.
@GemzME @John_CFS @jenbrea @AnnabelSchleut2 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @erikmoldwarrior yes.  altho i didn't know about the tick-borne problem.  what's that?
@GemzME @erikmoldwarrior @GabbyKlein1 @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea here it is, from the horse's mouth‚Äîthe cdc itself on afm.  i didn't read a single word about "not serious" (it say "serious").  also mentions enteroviruses as a potential cause.  nothing about its not being contagious.	https://t.co/zJpthFPGSb
@GabbyKlein1 @AnneSpaceCoast @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @cdc and having said all that, it's still a long way from showing that "CDC has been controlling the narrative" on ME/CFS for decades.  but i'm glad it's doing some research.  once those results are published, they will be subject to public review, just like PACE.	5/
@GemzME @John_CFS @jenbrea @AnnabelSchleut2 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @erikmoldwarrior interesting!  do you follow amy proal @ microbeminded2?  she's a microbiologist and pwme.  she's very interested in microbiomes and is convinced that autoimmune disease is really unresolved infection.  check out her posts.
@GemzME @erikmoldwarrior @GabbyKlein1 @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea can you provide those samples and cite your sources, here?  i haven't had that experience reading the press, so, it's hard to go just by your say-so.  i'm willing to be convinced by good evidence, though.
@GabbyKlein1 @AnneSpaceCoast @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @cdc but if you can show me, in a clear, rational way, why SEID can't be right, i'm willing to be convinced otherwise.	4/
@GabbyKlein1 @AnneSpaceCoast @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @cdc my sense is that SEID will capture the dysfunction underlying me/cfs.  b/c the research i've seen indicates mitchondrial dysfunction/energy production deficits in ME.  so it makes sense.  so the CDC might redeem itself, after all.	3/
@GabbyKlein1 @AnneSpaceCoast @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @cdc tbh, i'm thrilled that the cdc is taking the disease seriously enough to launch a multi-site study.  if the criticism of the cdc now is that it's using the wrong critieria, i'm still not convinced that SEID is the wrong set of criteria to use.	2/
@GabbyKlein1 @AnneSpaceCoast @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @cdc no, i didn't‚Äîthank you for being the only one so far to make the effort to provide evidence that the CDC is currently involved in the me/cfs business.  i will look into it.	1/

@GabbyKlein1 @AnneSpaceCoast @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @cdc this isn't so much about politics and history as much as it is about how roles &amp; responsibilities are delegated in our health care system.  i practiced within it.	but you can go on yelling "CDC!", if that's what floats your boat.  30+ yrs later, where has it gotten people?	3/

@GabbyKlein1 @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior you can refer to my longer response here, for more on why the CDC is not a player in the current ME landscape:	https://t.co/xlqWhJcLh3	2/
@GabbyKlein1 @KCSteckel @carpat21 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior this is ignorant, conspiratorial thinking.  the CDC does not control the narrative on ANY disease, except, briefly, an emerging disease.  (after that, it's a free-for-all.)  the CDC is not responsible for educating doctors, except, again, in the case of an emerging disease.	1/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior fortunately, for all of us, there IS good science being done.  at the OMF and elsewhere, really good science, getting to the fundamental problems in this disease‚Äîbut the trolls aren't interested in educating themselves about it or publicizing it.  they'd rather troll.	14/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior venting rage at the CDC, at this point in the game, is like howling at the moon.  there's much to be done, and none of it, as far as i can see, lies in the direction of the CDC‚ÄîALL of it lies in the direction of better science‚Äîwhich is exactly what jen brea has been saying.	13/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior so, this is not to say the CDC toolkit has no effect, but it's not a direct effect.  and i AM almost certain that the toolkit was not generated de novo at the CDC, that it uses info and recommendations generated by other bodies.	12/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the guidelines are issued, by committees constituted 4 that purpose, after consultation w/ relevant experts &amp; thorough review of the literature.	when docs want to know where to look for help w/ diagnosis/ treatment, they typically consult an online service like "up-to-date".	11/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior i don't know how much effect the CDC toolkit has on how ordinary docs practice medicine.  i've never seen one use it.  practice guidelines, which constitute "standard of care", are typically issued by professional orgs that each represent their respective branch of medicine.	10/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior but i doubt "pressure" will work very much, as it hasn't, historically.  PACE was dismantled by scientific analysis. if the ppl who are busy venting at the various agencies &amp; diagnostic criteria spent half their energy on good science, PACE would have been dismantled earlier.	9/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior doctors rarely interact with the NCHS‚Äîmuch less, the CDC‚Äîin their practice, even if they make use of the NCHS's questionnaires.	8/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior if there's any pressure to be applied, it should be applied to CMS.  it is the agency most present in the practicing lives of most physicians.  it has an astronomical budget.  and it is an advocacy agency: its policies affect how health care is done in this country.	7/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior if you want to blame the CDC for what ails the ICD, you might as well go to the top, to DHHS.  it sits on top of the NIH, too, so you get a two-for-one.	6/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior but the people managing the ICD codes are distinct from the group that, to erik's everlasting wrath, failed so catastrophically to adequately respond to the outbreak in nevada (the NCHS hadn't even been moved under CDC yet).	5/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the NCHS's primary job is generating and publishing national health statistics.  it was originally an autonomous entity under the DHHS. but you're right: since 1987, has been housed within the CDC.  i was not aware of that.	4/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the CMS is the agency most directly responsible, by its control of provider reimbursements and funding for physician training (residency &amp; fellowship), for the ICD's effects on patient care.	3/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the agencies tasked with maintaining ICD codes within the US are the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).	2/
@KCSteckel @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior there's a lot to unpack in your tweet.  the ICD is an international disease classification system developed and maintained by the world health organization (WHO).  it is the agency ultimately responsible for its contents.	1/
@erikmoldwarrior @Wee_Bawbee @velogubbed @AnnabelSchleut2 @jenbrea @MEwarrior_au @MEActNet you're projecting.  if jen's made anything clear, it's that she is not "the boss"of anything.  she's merely sharing her own experience and agitating for better science.
@erikmoldwarrior @Wee_Bawbee @velogubbed @AnnabelSchleut2 @jenbrea @MEwarrior_au @MEActNet and, as far as i can tell, she's never claimed to "represent CFS"‚Äîor anything else, other than herself.  people like you are making that claim, on her behalf.
@LittlestEngine @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior oh, well, thank you!
@richardvallee @TheOldLostRoad @jenbrea @docsimsim @velogubbed i'm happy to note that the PACE trial is unraveling because the fundamental science of it was bad and is being exposed as bad science, by fellow scientists‚Äîand it rightly should go down, on that basis.	6/
@richardvallee @TheOldLostRoad @jenbrea @docsimsim @velogubbed so, on the basis of the fact that psychiatrists have no verifiably good treatments for any functional disorders, they should not be allowed to take possession of patients.  it's that simple.	5/
@richardvallee @TheOldLostRoad @jenbrea @docsimsim @velogubbed and what about other "conversion" disorders?  what's their treatment success rate, there?  there are not good data, and this fact, alone, suggests that there isn't much to brag about.  that's a scandal, in and of itself.	4/
@richardvallee @TheOldLostRoad @jenbrea @docsimsim @velogubbed what do they have to show for their treatment of me/cfs patients?  my guess is, a mixed bag, at best.  PACE has been in practice, for years, and yet we still have large cohorts of completely, desperately, sick people.	3/
@richardvallee @TheOldLostRoad @jenbrea @docsimsim @velogubbed it seems to me "psychosomatic" is being used as a garbage bin for unknowable, unfixable issues. people get thrown in there, and never see the light of day.  psychosomatic medicine has been around for a long time; it's practitioners have been around for a long time:	2/
@richardvallee @TheOldLostRoad @jenbrea @docsimsim @velogubbed spot on.  we've all experience ignorance.  i'd say the battle lines have been drawn in the wrong place.  instead of policing people like jen, advocates should be holding the medical community to task for having such low expectations for psychiatry &amp; other related fields.	1/
@John_CFS @jenbrea @PeonyLeaves55 @Wee_Bawbee @AnnabelSchleut2 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @erikmoldwarrior good point.  but there's already quite a bit of evidence that there IS neuroinflammation involved with ME.
@John_CFS @jenbrea @AnnabelSchleut2 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @erikmoldwarrior we know the ECM has a powerful regulatory effect on the immune system.  it stands to reason connective tissue disorders and immune disorders would be linked.
@John_CFS @jenbrea @AnnabelSchleut2 @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @erikmoldwarrior john, can you describe more the collagen loss associated w/ME? anyplace i can look this up?  i think that's been operating with me, at least.  but i haven't been able to get any of my docs to look into it.

@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea thank you! and it is also, probably, close to the truth. or, at least, part of it.

@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea with an illness as poorly understood as ME, refining subsets isn't as critical as telling the difference between what makes sick vs. not sick.  pooling everyone sick w/same diz doesn't dilute the signal, b/c the signal is what differentiates ppl w/disease from those without.	2/
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea doctors don't think or behave like researchers.  they just don't.  that's just how it is.  but there are physician-scientists, a rather rarer breed.	i think you misunderstand how sets and subsets work, in medicine.	1/

@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @HHV6_University i'm eager to find out what davis finds out, because i'm pretty sure it will help me get better‚Äî&amp; i strongly suspect it will do the same thing for people suffering from the other definitions, too.  i'll be looking forward to having a glass of bubbly with you when it's all over.	5/
@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @HHV6_University 3)  as you know from the symposium, ron davis looked for dna viruses in his sick vs. control groups and didn't find any.  now, you can say, his patient cohort doesn't have what the tahoe people did, but, i'd say, the burden of proof is on you.	4/
@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @HHV6_University 2)  the antiviral -cyclovir drugs are fairly clinically effective agains hhv6.  dr. motoya's group at stanford has been treating patients w/ -cyclovir drugs, with very limited efficacy (about 30%).  also, montoya tests for hhv6.  he hasn't yet declared it a culprit.	3/
@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @HHV6_University 1)  even (from what i read) at the tahoe outbreak, not everyone who was exposed got sick.  what made the difference?  there has to be some genetic predisposition.	2/
@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @HHV6_University ok, erik, i think i have a better sense of where you're coming from.  you want the researchers to look specifically for hhv6a.  i'm going to look more into hhv6a &amp; get back to you.  but even before that, i know some compelling reasons hhv6a can't be the whole picture.	1/
@Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea that's a misrepresentation of IOM criteria; i'm wondering why you're doing this?  IOM criteria do not "deny" (i.e., exclude) neuroinflammation, cardiac and immune issues. you're being disingenuous.
@erikmoldwarrior @Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea please stop conflating the cdc with the nih.  you will further confuse people who are already impaired, confused, and looking for answers.	https://t.co/K1T5QZOEL2
@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea please watch the video or catch up on the research in some other way.
@jenbrea @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet it looks like a relatively small group, thank goodness.
@erikmoldwarrior @Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea the cdc doesn't have to adopt the icc.  and the nih is an entirely separate entity.  it's deliberately confusing to lay people for you to continue to conflate them.	https://t.co/K1T5QZOEL2
@Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea i don't fail to understand that, because it's not true.	https://t.co/3SvYVJxpFS
@Wee_Bawbee @jenbrea @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet it *is* the way you're doing it.
@erikmoldwarrior @Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea but that doesn't mean perseverating on that is going to get us a solution.  with all due respect, you don't seem to understand what's going on with current research.  please, please, educate yourself.	2/
@erikmoldwarrior @Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea this isn't *her* personal illness‚Äîand neither is it yours.  millions &amp; millions of people are suffering from it‚Äîmillions of people not restricted to disease outbreaks and clusters.  it was a crime of negligence to have ignored the outbreaks when they happened,	1/
@Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea https://t.co/3TI3NYvkn1
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea everyone is a self-appointed advocate.  *you're* a self-appointed advocate.  *you're* conflating jen with The King of Medical Treatment &amp; Research Funding.  if you're so convinced HER conflation kills, PROVIDE EVIDENCE!
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea i can't tell you anything, other than to point to the research that's going on.  you're hung up on terms and criteria‚Äîand researchers are elucidating fundamental mechanisms that can explain the full spectrum of symptoms.  watch the stanford symposia.
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea how absurdly dismissive.  and petty.
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea and there's nothing whacky about the theory she's explaining there.  there's plenty of evidence of metabolic derangement/mitochondrial dysfunction in me/cfs.  are you aware of any of that?  tell me: what do YOU think is going on with ME?	3/
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea same thing i'd have expected YOU would have done when YOU learned the biochemistry of cellular metabolism.  those "equations" should not have been unintelligible to you.	2/
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea again, did you watch the same film that i did?  can you back up your assertions about grandiose claims w/ actual material from the film?  her scribbling over board was her learning the biochemistry of cellular metabolism‚Äîexactly the same thing i did when i learned the biochem.	1
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea maybe that's what this is about?‚Äîyou've been working without getting results 4 decades &amp; she's just come in &amp; made a big splash?  &amp; yet you're accusing her of being ineffectual?  but her film IS having an impact, &amp; you know it.  &amp; the rest of us know nothing happens overnight.
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea i can point my own doctors to it and have some confidence they will be more educated about what it's like to live with this disease.  if unrest had been around 10 years ago, i wouldn't be in the shape i'm in today.  THAT'S been its impact.	3/
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea i can tell you about its impact in MY life: i've been able to point family, friends, and colleagues (that's fellow physicians) to it &amp; have them understand what i've been experiencing, in a way they didn't before.	2/
@docsimsim @velogubbed @jenbrea did you watch the same film that i did?  i don't see any way in this universe how it could be used to push a psychosomatic cause of me/cfs.  do you have any evidence, any instances that it has been used by psychs, as you say?	1/
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea well, as a doctor, i'm trying to clue you in on how "doctors" think (and, btw, most doctors don't do most of the research that gets done in the world), but i don't get that you're listening.
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea as i mentioned, the cdc is currently irrelevant.	https://t.co/K1T5QZOEL2
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea people haven't been chasing their tails lately‚Äîthey've been making progress.  you obviously having been keeping track of the latest research.  you should do so.	https://t.co/HbllO0iqfv
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea the medical profession, as a general rule, doesn't behave like researchers.  it's not just cfs/me, it's the system as a whole.  you can consider it a failure, but it's not something specific to me/cfs.
@erikmoldwarrior @velogubbed @docsimsim @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea please can you just watch the stanford symposium?  watch ALL OF IT.	then tweet.	https://t.co/HbllO0iqfv
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea forget about the cdc.  it's a non-player in the stage, right now.  focus on the NIH, where pressure can actually produce results.  the cdc can do nothing for you right now.  being stuck in the past will get you nowhere.
@docsimsim @velogubbed @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior i'd think that, as a phd biochemist, you'd be thrilled that the cause is being located in your territory.  look up the neuropsychopharmacology of kynurenine pathway.	2/
@docsimsim @velogubbed @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior what a strange response.  deranged, by my own admission?  is this brain fog?  have you been paying attention to the latest research coming out of the states, esp. by the OMF group?  did you watch the presentation at the stanford symposium?	1/
@Wee_Bawbee @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior you can "mute" the conversation.
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea i haven't read all of osler's web (i read enough to get really angry), but that's neither here, nor there. i'm a physician with over twenty years' training in science and medicine, so i know something about the nih and the cdc. i've explain the rest in my thread.
@erikmoldwarrior @MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea the people in the thread.
@velogubbed @MEwarrior_au @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior what, exactly, have you produced, by way of evidence for your assertions, it this thread?
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior if and when the mechanism of this disease is elucidated and a treatment or (dare i hope!) cure is developed, it will be in spite of, not because of, your vocal activism and your naysaying.  so, i say, again: cut it out.	43/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior to sum up: your preoccupation with definitional criteria, the cdc and whether or not jen is playing it just right are counterproductive.  your contemptuous dismissiveness of what biomedical researchers are doing NOW is counterproductive‚Äîand harmful to us all.	42/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior if you want to look at who matters, look there, at the various groups and agencies that constitute our healthcare policy infrastructure, like the NIH and its parent agency, the DHHS, and exert pressure from below.	41/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior @erikmoldwarrior conflates them ("cdc/nih"), betraying another degree of basic ignorance.  these entities are completely separate (though both operate under the DHHS.)  the NIH is where the money's at.  &amp; private foundations.  they're stepping in to help fill the funding gap.	40/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the only governmental institution that really really matters, in this fight, is the NIH, which, in addition to doing its own, intramural research, directs (or withholds) funds from outside research groups and institutions.	39/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior and yet, here you are, bleating about the cdc and whether or not it will ever properly declare "mea culpa" for sins from the 1980s and beyond‚Äîas if any of that makes any difference.	38/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior he has the scientific training, clinical acumen and intellectual firepower of a hundred of you and he hasn't come to the conclusion that me/cfs is infectious.  there is virtually nothing the cdc could do, at this point, to make the lives of pwme any better.	37/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior it's still an open question.  ron davis's group has been looking very thoroughly for an infectious cause‚Äîand still hasn't found anything.  but he's still looking.  his son's life is on the line, so he has quite a bit at stake.	36/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior as far as me/cfs is concerned now, the cdc is entirely peripheral, almost irrelevant.  cdc is about identifying &amp; containing new/EMERGING (mostly infectious) diz clusters.  but despite "outbreaks" in nevada etc, the epidemiology of me/cfs isn't very clear as one of infection.	35/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the cdc has FUCK-ALL to do with the day-to-day practice of medicine, or the way most medical research gets done. it's responsible neither for defining illnesses, nor funding their research, nor directing other funding toward or recognizing established groups.	34/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior i've noticed people are also hung up on the cdc. i have to wonder why.  again, it betrays a profound ignorance about the way science &amp; medicine work, in this country, &amp; around the world.	33/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior it's just swapping one mysterious label for another.  if per fink were really qualified to recognize/diagnose psychosomatic disorders, karina hansen would have stayed a free woman in her parents' home.  three years later, he has nothing to show for his "treatment" of her.	32/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior the whole psychosomatic issue is a separate, but, related issue: we're getting side-railed by insisting that me/cfs is not psychosomatic, when the problem is that psychosomatic illnesses are not any better understood and treated than me/cfs is.	31/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior does it get more ridiculous than that?  the most we can hope for is that our doctors listen to us and don't dismiss us, out of hand.  because, outside of that, there isn't too much that they can do.	30/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior sorry, but that's just not how medicine &amp; science work.  it's way more complicated than that, bt the upshot is: ppl aren't getting proper treatment/care, mostly because there really ISN'T proper treatment/care.	I'M A DOCTOR &amp; I'M NOT GETTING PROPER TESTING, TREATMENT, &amp; CARE.	29/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior all they have are insistent assertions, repeated over&amp;over.  alison @Wee_Bawbee, who seems to have a special antipathy for anyone who doesn't hate iom with a passion, insists that, if only the icc criteria were used, people would be getting proper treatment and care.	28/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior no one has ever produced any evidence that a patient was denied a diagnosis because s/he didn't meet a particular set of criteria.  no one has even proposed a viable mechanism for how jen's personal opinions could possibly be shaping healthcare policy or practice.	27/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior i'm also seeing a profound preoccupation‚Äîi'd say, obsession‚Äîwith definitional criteria, as if they're the equivalent of cure.  and all the institutional acronyms, duking it out.  iom is out, but icc is in?‚Äînever mind that at least one person (bateman) was involved in both.	26/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior at the same time, i'm seeing many people tar the clinicians and researchers who ARE making real progress (like lucinda bateman) with the same brush as the per finks and the PACE GET pushers of the world.  what a way to reward the people who are on your side.	25/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior &amp; fwiw i don't always agree w/ her.  but i also don't confuse her w/ francis collins.  she's a single pwme, albeit 1 who's had the opportunity &amp; wherewithal to make a compelling film &amp; start an advocacy group.  i'm not seeing anyone else here do anything of similar magnitude.	24/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior i called her a woman of singular courage deliberately.  she's shared the most intimate parts of her story in the most immediate medium‚Äîthe visual‚Äî&amp; opened herself up 2 exactly the kind of criticism one sees on the threads here.  it takes a singular courage 2b able 2 do that.	23/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior what do you think she has "access" to?  the secret sprinkle fairy dust that can cure us all?  &amp; she's withholding it from all of you?  give me a fucking break.  your naked envy is on display here. it is unseemly.	22/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior your attacks on her amount to a concerted attempt to shut down the voice of a single patient‚Äîeffectively, the twitter thought police‚Äîand smack of nothing more than envy‚Äîof her profile, "connections" &amp; perceived "access".	21/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior by something she's said or done, to properly treat a patient, then we can talk.  and if you can provide evidence that her activism has had a significant negative impact on me/cfs treatment, then you might have a case.  but, for now, 	20/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior speaking of conflation, you're conflating jen's voice with that of the nih or nhs director‚Äîsomeone of great authority to shape the course of research/treatment.  if you can point to a single instance where a researcher or clinician has been dissuaded or misled,	19/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior &amp; @velogubbed, i'm not suggesting jen's beyond criticism‚Äîbut, if you're going to criticize, you must bring something useful to the table.  so far, as far as i can see, you have not.  none of you have.  passions and accusations are abundant, but, evidence is in short supply.	18/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior so you would EXPECT to see, from the same fundamental derangement, a wide variety of clinical presentations.  WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SEE.  jen is more right than wrong, here.	17/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea @erikmoldwarrior what do all these patients have in common? the answer seems to be: a profound metabolic derangement, one that interferes with all aspects of bodily function, energy production, immune system function, nervous system function, etc. etc.	16/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea which explains a lot of what we observe about this disease: a breakdown of function across tissues/systems.  the insight comes, ironically, not by casting the net as precisely as possible (considering subsets, as @erikmoldwarrior insists), but casting the net WIDE‚Äîand asking:	15/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea i highly recommend you view the video (i've posted the link).  the omf grp is making rapid progress, despite the controversy &amp; the politics.  we're maybe a couple of years away from elucidating the mechanism of disease &amp; the leading candidate is a primary metabolic disorder.	14/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea (i've had the pleasure of being blocked by one of the researchers in the group for daring to question his science.)  my deepest condolences.  but, ultimately, mother nature/reality doesn't care about politics.  maybe you're not aware of the situation in the states‚Äîesp. @ OMF?	13/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea nasim @velogubbed, i'm aware of the politics of ME in the UK‚Äîyou've had the misfortune to give birth to the PACE group and they have a terrible, suffocating grip on your medico-scientific establishment.	12/
@MEwarrior_au @velogubbed @Wee_Bawbee @MEActNet @jenbrea but, first, full disclosure: i speak here as a patient and a physician-scientist (one whose career has been derailed by this illness and the medical establishment's willful ignorance about it‚Äîso it's doubly personal, for me).	11/

@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell so you should know about how to make citations. you've been making assertions all along w/o a single citation. you've asserted i've pinched wikipedia.  put your much-vaunted degrees to the test &amp; show me where in wikipedia.  or we'll have to see about those diplomas...
@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell i have an MD and a PhD, which i received after the usual MS &amp; BS degrees (so i know all about BS. if you look on my profile, you'll see you should have thought twice about starting this particular fight).	‚Äîbut, never mind.  let's pretend that biz man. &amp; app ling. are scholarly.
@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell just out of curiosity: are any of the degrees you have (or a working towards) scholarly?  i.e., do they require citations for any assertions you make?  or can you just bs your way through?
@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell LOL i'm sure the men folk are so grateful for your pity.  maybe they'll pet you on the head for your years of loyal service...

@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell that's not how this whole "freedom" thing works.  not in a functioning democracy, anyway.

@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell last time any of us checked, a person is not obligated, for reasons of non-hypocrisy, 2 refrain from criticizing her/his employer on all counts &amp; across all categories, about any&amp;all things, for the rest of her/his life, during &amp; after her/his term of employment.
@emzkistan @kestrel78 @isaacbarrett @IMKristenBell LOL i'm pretty sure the feminists don't feel the need.  perhaps you're projecting?	speaking of needs, though, if i may suggest, it appears you need to look up the word "hypocrite".  to quote the eternal inigo montoya, "i do not think it means what you think it means."  üòÜüòÜüòÇüòÇüòÇ

@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @KristianGunder @Columbia no; but you're moving the goalposts.  your original statement was "#LGBTQ community had a history of fighting 4 equality" (vis a vis HIV)‚Äîwhich wasn't true.
@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @Columbia it's not about the meds; it's about the natural incubation period of the virus.  it takes HIV years, even decades, to erode its host's immune system.  i know; i'm a doc.  please read up about HIV's natural history.

@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @KristianGunder @Columbia you're right about the difference that visibility ("taking to the streets") makes.  &amp; you're also right about the difference that a perceived threat to heterosexuals makes.  if only ME/CFS were a sexually transmitted disease!...	5/
@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @KristianGunder @Columbia but you must get your history right.	&amp; ME/CFS does not necessarily have a short span.  the classic picture is of a person who is felled overnight, but many people functionally deteriorate over a long span of time.	4/
@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @KristianGunder @Columbia &amp; the LGBTQIA community did NOT have a history of political activity prior to the HIV epidemic‚Äîhomosexuality was highly taboo‚Äîand we didn't even talk about other forms of sexuality &amp; sexual identity.  it was AIDS that mobilized people. perhaps you're too young to remember,	3/
@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @KristianGunder @Columbia reproduce by infecting sexually active people, you don't want to take them down, right away.  HIV wouldn't have survived if it quickly killed ppl it infected.	2/
@CatEye0611 @KatarinaBrandt @carolbinks @johnamuir @MEMilitant1 @HenrikVogt @KristianGunder @Columbia completely incorrect: people do not die shortly after infection w/HIV.  HIV has a long incubation period, on the order of decades, before it wears down the host's immune system.  &amp; if you think about it, logically, it wouldn't make sense any other way: if your m.o. is to	1/
