@MerleMom19 You hold 100% responsibility for where you get information and what you trust.
@MerleMom19 Just like news media outlets and friends, polls need to be examined for bias, thoroughness, methodology, etc.
Polls are necessary. Even with them, media treats old rural white Trump voters like a majority that they aren‚Äôt. That would get worse without polls. 		But polls are most useful when they're about urgent issues that folks know a lot about ‚Äî e.g., definitely not Dems in 2020 race. https://t.co/VyGiPhCnp9

Perhaps most interesting, in a filing today, Trump administration indicates it may be holding back on issuing new rule until SCOTUS decides whether it will hear and rule on the definition of ‚Äúsex‚Äù in 1 of 3 cases (2 on sexual orientation and 1 on gender identity). https://t.co/QJsIoFmMCp

The case began in 2016 after HHS issued a nondiscrimination rule under the ACA. Judge Reed O‚ÄôConnor (NDTX) blocked parts about abortion and trans rights. Trump admin said it'd rewrite the rule, and O'Connor put litigation on hold.
Texas and other plaintiffs had asked judge for a status hearing to advance the case (the administration didn‚Äôt oppose the motion), saying a forthcoming HHS regulation could take years. Here‚Äôs their motion: https://t.co/7zX22mBkK8
The case may have broad implications for LGBT rights in schools and workplaces. There‚Äôs been speculation Trump admin may seek to redefine "sex" in civil rights law based on birth characteristics, ignoring trans people. That could happen as part of this case and/or related rule.

Hello I‚Äôm on a plane the size of a Twizzler heading to Tallahassee for a federal court hearing on the Florida election count. God help me.
But Uzoma Nkwonta, lawyer for VetVotes &amp; Dems, said FL law already allows ballots counted 10 days later when sent from overseas. If counting those doesn‚Äôt require starting over, there‚Äôs no reason ballots sent domestically and arriving in same timeframe should go uncounted.
This is the first time I've heard Republican lawyers elucidate that position clearly, and I've been asking them for four days.
This is because Sat‚Äôs unofficial returns were the basis to start recount ‚Äî so, he argues, changing underlying numbers by counting more ballots may require or negate the need for recount in certain races.
The parties also foreshadowed the legal arguments. Mohammed Jazil, representing Sec. of State (the defendant), said that since Nov. 10 was deadline for unofficial ballot returns, adding more now would require recounting from scratch.
Frank Zacherl, lawyer for FL GOP, says they will appeal to 11th Circuit if Walker rules those ballots can be counted.
If there aren't factual disputes, he may not hold hearing. If he does, hearing will be Fri or Sat. He wants to move fast so case can be resolved by 9am Nov 20 (when election is certified), including a possible appeal. 		‚ÄúIf it means we don‚Äôt sleep, that‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he told lawyers.

@marx_attacks_ Per complaint, they‚Äôd only be impounded when not in use.
The lawyers are returning from recess, so presumably they‚Äôve reached an agreement.
we should all say damn gay when we hear something righteous instead of damn straight thanks for coming to my ted talk
RT @ZoeTillman: Here's @dominicholden on today's court hearing on litigation filed by Florida Gov. (and Republican senatorial candidate) Ri‚Ä¶
Judge Tutor before the recess ‚Äî ‚ÄúI am not casting and dispersions on any officials right now. I am going to leave it to you and see if you can reach an agreement.‚Äù
Judge Tuter seems sympathetic to that argument, while saying more public confidence would help, and he urged Snipes to be more transparent, with updates every few hours. So he sent all the lawyers to hash out a security agreement that is NOT an impound and come back around 1pm.
Moreover, Pettis contends that a court order impounding the ballots would lend credence to idea that there's malfeasance by Snipes, without evidence, and Republicans would manipulate a decision to argue Snipes was breaking the law.
‚ÄúYou know what undermines voter confidence is claiming some sort of behavior without any evidence,‚Äô Pettis said.
Although Republicans say Snipes broke law when she only handed over records after a judge‚Äôs order on Friday, she only had 24 hours, Pettis added. He said she was busy counting the election ‚Äî and ultimately complied, disclosing even more info than required, pretty quickly.
Ballots are already under lock and key, with check-in, check-out systems, and everything is guarded by sheriff‚Äôs deputies and private security, Pettis said. He said no one has alleged fraud to canvassing board.
But Eugene Pettis, lawyer for Snipes (an elected official in the Dem county with a history of big flubs), said confidence is shaken because Scott has misled the public ‚Äî Scott claimed liberals are trying to steal the election, commiting fraud, etc.
‚ÄúWe have a trust issue in this county. We need something so we can have trust in this process,‚Äù he said, adding people can't trust election head Brenda Snipes because she didn‚Äôt hand over records till judge ordered her to Friday. ‚ÄúA public wrong is preventable by an injunction.‚Äù
The main argument of Rick Scott‚Äôs campaign lawyer, Jason Zimmerman, isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs evidence ballots aren't secure or there's fraud (as Scott claimed). It‚Äôs that the public has lost confidence.
Despite the legal wrangling, this is looks nakedly political.
Tuter proposed 1 deputy in ballot-counting room, 1 at door, &amp; 1 supervisor ‚Äî none of whom would report into the current deputies are already at elections office monitoring the site.
But Tuter indicated he can‚Äôt issue an injunction to impound ballots yet, since there‚Äôs no evidence presented, nor does he seem to this it's necessary. He proposed they could agree to let 3 sheriff‚Äôs deputies monitor election headquarters for ‚Äúan additional layer of confidence.‚Äù
Impounding ballots isn't that unusual, but winning this case would give Republicans, Trump, and Rick Scott more fuel for their claims there's malfeasance, corruption in the counting. They'd likely say a judge had to stop Democrats from stealing the election.
Florida debacle update thread ‚Äî State court Judge Jack Tuter just ordered 1-hour recess in the Broward County case over impounding ballots and voting equipment, telling 17 lawyers representing the many parties to come back with a mutually agreeable deal. https://t.co/RSNfl81rg8

This is a lie ‚Äî it‚Äôs taken a long time to count the ballots. Many are still arriving from overseas and military voters. I‚Äôve seen no evidence of forgery down here.

@EricColumbus Sessions announced the task force with a high-profile religious liberty summit ‚Äî¬†with the goal of changing law. While consultation with private-sector advocates is certainly reason for more disclosure, the nature or their work justifies that even if it were confined within DOJ.
@EricColumbus Quite fundamentally, if this is about the rights of religious people, and how their rights conflict with other protected classes, it‚Äôs critical to know who is involved, what religions they represent, and what concern they raise about rights of other protected classes.
@EricColumbus One co-chair said the task force would field legal complaints directly, raising questions about whether it will  adjudicate disputes or override civil rights offices. Not all of its work will necessarily be public, but cloaking it like this is stunning.
@EricColumbus For an entity that‚Äôs tasked with shaping public policy, statutory law, and federal litigation, that secrecy is remarkable. 		The presidential voting commission, by comparison, vowed a bipartisan membership, named the participants, and held public meetings.
@EricColumbus He‚Äôs named himself and two co-chairs. But he hasn‚Äôt said who‚Äôs representing the other components, who is joining the listening sessions (from private sector), or what actions they‚Äôve been taking. The meetings are all secret.

@musgrove_david It‚Äôs the legal issues that link them here. Courts have found sexual-orientation discrimination and gender-identity discrimination are both types of sex discrimination ‚Äî whether gay and/or trans ppl wouldn't face discrimitnion *but for* their sex or failure to meet sex stereotypes
Trump admin has been bullishly anti-transgender, advancing limited view of sex discrimination, including under Title IX, and possibly in regulations. But DOJ seems to question whether it can actually win in court yet.
Yet this raises an important question ‚Äî If DOJ is so confident that sex discrimintion laws don‚Äôt cover gender identity, then why not encourage SCOTUS to hear this trans case now?
To be clear: DOJ still holds anti-trans views ‚Äî a DOJ memo from last fall said Title VII doesn‚Äôt cover gender identity, a view reinforced today. 		But DOJ seems to believe it has a better shot at helping defeat the gay rights cases.
In other words, DOJ is essentially saying SCOTUS should punt here and let a trans victory under Title VII stand if they don't take up Zarda and Bostock.
The trans woman won at CA6. But DOJ says that if SCOTUS does want to consider her appeal, it should wait until after ruling in Bostock and Zarda. 		Here's the DOJ brief: https://t.co/gH87hiACS5 https://t.co/T2oT1dNuV1
Gay cases are Zarda (CA2) and Bostock (CA11). Both argue Title VII bans discrimination on basis of sexual orientation.
JUST IN ‚Äî Justice Dept. just told Supreme Court that transgender workers aren‚Äôt protected by Title VII, which bans sex discrimination.		But in a twist, DOJ says court *shouldn‚Äôt* hear a major trans case till after it rules in 2 gay rights cases. 1/ https://t.co/YjEovAHOFa

The Times report has led to some rather extreme conclusions from readers. Here‚Äôs context on the policies that could help: https://t.co/PGS2T5av5c
The Dec. 2016 ruling cited by HHS is about healthcare (Here‚Äôs @chrisgeidner ‚Äôs report at the time: https://t.co/GrVgmwEgHi). That case was not about Title IX and education, which is what the memo was reportedly was about.
@pmwnyc Try reading the HHS statement, my tweet, and the story I linked to.
What‚Äôs really dishonest about HHS and the Trump administration in this statement is citing one forum shopped judge, O‚ÄôConnor, in Texas, when there are copious district and circuit court decisions recognizing trans people *are* protected by federal bans on sex discrimination.
HHS is attempting to conflate two different rulings over trans friendly policies ‚Äî on Title IX and Section 1557 of ACA ‚Äî to pin blame on Obama. 		Obama appealed former ruling, but the latter only happened 3 weeks before he left office. Trump didn‚Äôt appeal it either.
Trump admin is trying to slam the NYT transgender memo story as "misleading."		But the HHS statement is misleading, too. The Dec. 2016 ruling they cite wasn‚Äôt about Title IX.

@JoannaG 1. A tweet from a magazine is not the industry. 		2. Cheap attacks from Trump and the GOP don‚Äôt set standard for a free press ‚Äî news outlets don‚Äôt need to meet an impossible standard just because someone trying to avoid journalistic scrutiny says so.

@JoannaG This is the most normal conversation I‚Äôve ever had on Twitter. Thank you. But I think that‚Äôs up to you. My standard to delete a tweet is if I accidentally said something false, and your tweet is a sort of analysis/jab/joke, not really a statement of fact.

@JoannaG There‚Äôs a temptation to say that all of media must be perfect in order for any of it to be credible. But that is simplistic frame that Trump has advanced ‚Äî an impossible standard ‚Äî and people in media, above all, should be able to see through it.

The task force's existence, on its own, doesn't seem like an illegal fusion of church and state (as some have said). 		But its rollout, at a summit of the Christian right, raises flags that the task force may enshrine a specific brand of religious exercise.
Certainly the Religious Liberty Task Force could make other agencies feel like they're being watched. 		Sessions has politicized the Justice Dept to protect many conservative/Christian causes in civil cases. 		The task force could pressure other agencies to do the same.
I'm not clear the task force can do anything Sessions' isn't empowered to do already ‚Äî he runs the DOJ, and has long arms to influence other agencies on legal matters on his own.
Jeff Sessions' new Religious Liberty Task Force hasn't announced agenda or schedule, so it's unclear what it will do. 		Is it a bone to the Christian right before midterms? Or an actual vehicle to change behavior of federal agencies?

@chrisFnicholson @nowthised The florist argues that there is, in fact, religious hostility. He lwers contend that the state AG, by seeking damages in Stutzman‚Äôs personal capacity and bypassing the state civil rights commission, shows hostility.

The Philly case just applies to Philly, but this appears to be the judge's final ruling on the big issues on that case (not a preliminary injunction), so the question becomes: Will DOJ actually hand over the money? What will Sessions do now?
This is a little different than a case out of Chicago, where a judge issued a preliminary injunction on two of Sessions' grant conditions on the Byrne JAG funds *nationwide.* Sessions is currently appealing at the 7th Circuit. See my tweet from Mon: https://t.co/GuU8Mr2LPC

In short: It seems ADF is willing to fight this fight ‚Äî they're the ones bringing it up ‚Äî and AG Ferguson sure seems to take it seriously.
There are other active cases with records that *could* possibly show officials exhibited "hostility" to a person's religious views ‚Äî  such as Brush &amp; Nib Studio, 303 Creative, and others that ADF and other groups are currently handling.
And the florist's case is quite relevant. Although she lost at the WA state supreme court, ADF is currently asking SCOTUS to review the case. SCOTUS hasn't said what it will do yet. SCOTUS could send the case back to state court to reconsider it in light of Monday's decision.
So, although the Masterpiece ruling was narrow ‚Äî it didn't answer the 1st Amendment question ‚Äî clearly religious conservatives see an opening to argue officials (prosecutors, commissioners, maybe judges) have shown "hostility" during past proceedings and there's an opening.
Stutzman cited this letter she sent the AG in 2015: https://t.co/awevMso0ZW https://t.co/Zl8k2uEi5D
The florist, then, said she asked the AG to "‚Äòto drop‚Äô the personal claims that risk stripping away ‚Äòmy home, business, and other assets.‚Äô He didn‚Äôt do that. For him, this case has been about making an example of me‚Äîcrushing me."		Florist statement: https://t.co/A8px1bEjyu
ADF added that SCOTUS had ruled on Monday "it was 'inappropriate' for the government to draw parallels between those religious beliefs and ‚Äòdefenses of slavery‚Äô" ‚Äî arguing this was relevant now in the florist lawsuit.
Now, lawyers at ADF are elaborating on this same point, saying AG Ferguson "demeaned her faith. He has compared her religious beliefs about marriage‚Äîwhich the Supreme Court said are ‚Äòdecent and honorable‚Äô‚Äîto racial discrimination." There's more here: https://t.co/FJJytKRB3R
It escalated last night ‚Äî AG Ferguson fired back with this lengthy statement saying he only sought $1 in fees and "a modest $1,000 penalty." He added, "We are confident Washington courts showed no such hostility" like that cited by SCOTUS in Masterpiece. https://t.co/trqsuH2wOn
The florist's lawyers at @AllianceDefends (who also represented the baker) started a feud yesterday when they claimed the WA AG's actions reflected same type of anti-religious "hostility" that was key in the baker's ruling. 		As I noted yesterday:  https://t.co/RUWyXRCNmh https://t.co/6B5Y3XGGmc
In that case ‚Äî WA v. Arlene's Flowers ‚Äî WA State AG @BobFergusonAG had sued the florist, Barronelle Stutzman, in her personal and professional capacity, seeking financial penalty and damages. https://t.co/IfpGATmw1f
