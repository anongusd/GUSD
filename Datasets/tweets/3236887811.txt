@suezeecue @kalilahe @dennisbroox Rebellion against the very rules of society that YOU  fight to uphold everyday
@suezeecue the teaching profession is in a section of careers all by itself. It's the vehicle of learning , morals, and attitudes
@suezeecue on that I can agree with you
@suezeecue @kalilahe @dennisbroox Tattoes is one of the first signs of rebillion
@suezeecue @kalilahe @dennisbroox Susan we want to shape our kids on a bit OF pride and dignity.  The respect of self and morality
