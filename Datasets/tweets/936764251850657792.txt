Let's go @Yankees!!!
@RedSox redsox are forever cursed and I am happy to announce that
@RedSox the redsox suck
Who cares right
U smell
@YESNetwork LET'S GO YANKEES!!!
@michaelkay g2 do a better job promoting Yankees pride...idc if it's not your job...ur either a fan or not...get the other fans rooting again
@Yankees ok team...it's time to start being the team we was all looking forward to the whole offseason...sweep the sox
@RealMichaelKay @RealMichaelKay do you actually read your tweets or does a secretary do that for u...is she tweeting just for show or is this the real kay and if it is ...no offense
@RealMichaelKay If u are so much for rushing through the game then u are not enjoying the game, u don't like the game so y be part of the game.....leave baseball alone...quit with the rule changes
@RealMichaelKay The best part about baseball is there is no clock so u have unlimited time for the impossible to happen....how can the owners be so much for speeding up the game
@RealMichaelKay Tell everyone to leave baseball alone
Does anybody use the "house phone" anymore
90s early 2000s was the best
Twitter sucks
Panties on a bear
There is a crazy epidemic going on where all women are transforming into cats and dogs and stuff...be careful
I keep getting updates ...."in case I missed bla bla bla's tweet"....u know how many tweets I missed...I don't care
Stop following me....what is the point
You just never know
Nobody comments on my tweets or nothing....wat if I'm one of those bad guys (I'm not) and these tweets are the early warning signs....all of u are to blame for not saying nothing.
Twitter sucks
Just going blablahbla
When u bored u do wat
One 2 three
Redsox suck
@RedSox Who cares who got a hit...the sox lost if they didn't win and that's all that matters
@MLB Yankees winning it all this year!
Damn the Redsox really suck!!!!
Why
Where
@winstonmeiiis Whose a pssy?
What
When
Who
Trump is my president and so he's my friend...Trump is going to make America Great Again for the next 4 years
How many tweets before your famous???
Oooo look, I like a fundraiser but I won't help...but I like it smiley face hashtag someshit
In 5 months I had 1 person help the Homeless....people have a lot to say about other people and how people are intolerant and rude toward certain people...then those same people don't donate a penny to help
I love @tacobell
Oooo look people are "following " me
Now I can just talk nonsense
After following 5000 people, now suddenly my limit has been reached...what sense does that make???

@PatKeenan4 @RealMichaelKay @diannaESPN @AaronBoone_ESPN Wat does she know about baseball
@ogonzilla @RealMichaelKay @AaronBoone_ESPN Everybody wanted the manager to be like hank arron or Willie mays or randy Johnson or Nolan ryan....the best managers were if even average players...I don't think "fans" realize the manager don't play and his past talent isn't contagious
@RealMichaelKay @29alltime @AaronBoone_ESPN I shouldn't have to come to a Yankee page to hear the truth ....if your a fan of baseball you should know Boone been around baseball all his life and is ready for the job.
@Ken_Rosenthal Boone has a spine and most of all luck....In the end it's going to come down to how the players play...but I'm not disappointed in the Yankees pick
