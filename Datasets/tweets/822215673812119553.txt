Much to our critics' dismay, it turns out pro-growth policies... drive growth.	 	@WhiteHouseCEA: "The 1.1 percentage point performance above trend is almost exactly in line with peer-reviewed estimates of an exogenous tax shock of the same magnitude as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act."
"The [GDP] report shows how Republican-backed tax cuts may have continued to aid growth and help bring the full-year figure to 3.1 percent, just above President Donald Trump’s 3 percent goal." — Bloomberg
For two years in a row, growth has matched or exceeded the Trump Administration’s own forecast.	 	This growth is an acceleration, not a continuation, of the Obama economy: Output in 2018 was $280 billion MORE than if the pre-2017 trend line had held, @WhiteHouseCEA explains.
For the first time in 13 years, the economy reached 3% growth in 2018.	 	GDP grew by 3.1% from the 4th quarter of 2017 to the 4th quarter of 2018. (This time period is “a better measure of how the economy actually performed in 2018,” says former President Obama's top economist.)

"Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end."	 	— President Donald J. Trump
.@DHSgov and @CBP work hard to alert potential border-crossers to the risk of human trafficking before they become victims. Sadly, many will still attempt the trip—or even send children alone—in order to take advantage of porous U.S. borders and loopholes in our system.
The trek to the southern border exposes vulnerable women and children to a high risk of violence, exploitation, &amp; sex trafficking. Up to 80 percent of women are assaulted, according to some reports.		Open borders empower the traffickers. Border security puts them out of business.

Reality check: 		The President offered to work with Democrats in good faith to reopen the Government and secure our border. 		The President put forward a common-sense solution developed by law enforcement professionals at @DHSgov.		The Democrats have offered nothing.
