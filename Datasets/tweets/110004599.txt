@zachdd @jharrell @SenDeanHeller @LCVoters My beef w/ LCV's scorecards (and with probably others) is that they are being painted on their face as objective and absolute. They are in fact deeply subjective. And in some cases can be highly misleading. Good debate (fin)
@zachdd @jharrell @SenDeanHeller @LCVoters Scorecards by nature are flawed partly because 1 message vote brought up just to score a point doesn't outweigh real dealmaking that may be happening off the floor, leg time logjam or a multi-Congress effort to resolve a really complicated problem. LCV compounds this problem
@zachdd @jharrell @SenDeanHeller @LCVoters And Gene will probably be rewarded w/ another solid speaking slot at the next Democratic National Convention. Which is perfectly fine. But just be more honest about the scorecards, which votes they use and which they leave out, and the resulting use as a Democratic electoral tool
@zachdd @jharrell @SenDeanHeller @LCVoters What part of "conservative clean energy" lacks transparency? Yes, ClearPath has always openly focused on working with Republicans in order to positively move the clean energy agenda. LCV misleadingly paints its scorecards as accurate barometers of someone's overall contributions
@zachdd @SenDeanHeller What's most important? An empty messaging vote to be used in a campaign ad or a bonafide deal that becomes law and make a positive change toward decarbonization? I'm clearly not going to win this hashtag/twitter handle game going on here
@zachdd @SenDeanHeller Sorry, didn't realize there was a statute of limitations on leadership. And that's a lot of conjecture there re: Sandoval. But I digress. Messaging resolutions are one thing. Helping put into law meaningful changes in clean energy policy is another.
@zachdd @SenDeanHeller Highlighting Obamacare debate is as tangential as some of the votes (campaign finance reform) included in LCV scorecards. Heller helped lead enactment of the 2015 tax package extending clean energy credits for five years and has been a lead GOP backer of energy storage actually
@zachdd @SenDeanHeller Battery storage &amp; solar have similar obstacles regarding cost and scale. I for one hope that they all succeed. Storage helps intermittent solar become reliable. SMRs can also be sent everywhere (and be used more effectively during peak times with energy storage). Everyone can win
@zachdd @SenDeanHeller Partisan scorecards are as ubiquitous as lobbyists. LCV's is 1 of them. I won't defend anyone's total voting record (just as you won't defend LCV's nuclear position). Fact is we need dealmakers in both parties spurred by parochial or other reasons. Heller has made important deals
@zachdd yes, I know low natural gas prices and other reasons traditional nuclear expansion hasn't happened (Lots of exciting things happening on the small modular/advanced front) But LCV's scorecard remains undermined by often times stacking the decks with meaningless message votes.
@zachdd LCV labels nuclear "dirty energy" despite 0 carbon. Yes, I get waste storage of traditional reactors but color me highly skeptical they will reward lawmakers for voting for advanced nuclear, carbon capture and other pragmatic climate solutions. Scorecard is a Dem election tool
