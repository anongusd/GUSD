@LPDonovan @SadiqShami Yeah fair, broader perception was it wasn‚Äôt close. But there were plenty of people in the trenches who disagreed and saw it as a legit target well before it came around
@LPDonovan @SadiqShami September, not August* https://t.co/HEILIlICnP
@LPDonovan @SadiqShami Eh, I think a lot of people expected it to be this close. NRSC was putting out polls in August showing it tight to push for more outside money. Tester/Dems were always prepared for a tight race. That's what makes me think Rosendale's unique negatives are a significant factor
Senate thought: Tester and Manchin were the two moderate D incumbents to survive. Carpetbagging attacks decisive? Rosendale got tagged early as "Maryland Matt" bc of origin/accent. Morrisey got hit endlessly during R primary and by Manchin for being from New Jersey.

ARGH. Math is tough. This should be 54 if Nelson result holds and McSally wins, and 52 if Nelson flips it and Sinema wins. https://t.co/uv6RGVAaIp
@HotlineJosh yes. Math is very hard on zero sleep.
Fwiw, there was a real concern from Rs that if Cramer took a pass (which he did, briefly, for a few days), the race would be really tough. Everyone felt pretty solid about it once Cramer was in https://t.co/F9WpIS5o02
With Tester's win, R Senate range is now between 55 seats (if Nelson loss holds and McSally wins AZ) and 52 (If Nelson flips it and Sinema wins).
Tester wins in Montana
In the end, this story from Oct 22 looks pretty good. Dem hopes for Senate majority faded into a margin game down the stretch. With MT/AZ still out and FL a recount, that margin is still unknown  https://t.co/nHxL0sRmmR
McConnell says he traded calls with Rick Scott and Martha McSally but hasn‚Äôt spoken to either of them.
If Nelson result holds and Tester/Sinema lose, Rs have 55 seats. 		If Tester comes back, Nelson flips it and Sinema pulls it out, Rs have 52. 		That‚Äôs a massive difference when you look at a 2020 map that flips and puts Rs on defense. https://t.co/Ejs8mTXZfq
Florida Senate recount despite Scott declaring victory. McSally up in AZ, but a lot of votes uncounted. Rosendale narrowly ahead of Tester in MT but a lot of votes still out in areas Tester will do well. Big implications for the Senate margin w/ those three
Nelson not conceding Florida with margin close enough to trigger a recount. 		‚ÄúWe are proceeding to a recount," Nelson said in statement sent out by his campaign this morning.
Me coming into the office today: Good morning. 	It was 3pm. 	Me to my Uber driver dropping me off: have a good night. 	It‚Äôs 5am.

RT @burgessev: McConnell and Trump just spoke, McConnell thanked Trump for his help in picking up seats, per source familiar
Trump campaigned relentlessly for Senate down the stretch. Two rallies in FL, MO, IN in final 5 days. All three look likely to be GOP flips. 		House looks gone. But Trump had been saying he was more focused on protecting Senate, and appears ready to take credit for R majority https://t.co/s0jVsMr5Zb
Kevin Cramer beats Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. Republicans projected to keep the Senate, flipping ND/IN and protecting TN/TX. Big question outstanding: how big will the margin be?
Ted Cruz prevails in Texas
"What West Virginia said loud and clear tonight: Mr. President, we want our senator, not your senator." https://t.co/tK5g6jvnAE
Manchin: "I never expected this race to be the national race it turned out to be. I never expected President Trump to come to this state as much as he did, sending Vice President Pence, sending his family time after time after time. And you stood tall."
Mike Braun wins Indiana. First big loss for Senate Dems.
More than 7 million votes counted and Scott is currently leading Nelson by about 15,000. Extremely tight in FL
Two early calls for Dems: Sherrod Brown in OH and Bob Casey in PA both reelected. Two states Trump won, two Senate races Rs barely contested in the end.
Mike Braun has banked himself a huge lead in the rural parts of Indiana. Most of Donnelly's best areas in Indy/NW are still uncounted though. Question is whether there are enough votes still out there for him to cut the margin down. Still a ways to go
Tim Kaine projected to win VA Senate race right as polls close.		@AlxThomp had a great rundown a few days ago on how Kaine campaigned for redemption, and for a blowout.		https://t.co/EElIyZxtuB

@databyler Hello David my old friend. I‚Äôve come to tweet with you again.
Some Republicans didn‚Äôt buy Lamb‚Äôs disavowal of Pelosi, though. Paul Berginc, who was at the Trump rally Saturday:	‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what he says. I would say anything too, if I were in his shoes, to get elected and that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs doing. I don‚Äôt believe it one bit.‚Äù	#PA18
Al Smith, a reliable Democratic voter, pushed back on the Republicans attempts to link Lamb with Pelosi. 	‚ÄúI doubt he even knows Nancy Pelosi. I don‚Äôt think he even knows her. He‚Äôs never been in office before, how the hell would he know her?‚Äù	#PA18
Janet Dellanna, 64, a registered Republican, voted for Lamb. She said the party catered too much to the far right, starting with McCain picking Palin in 2008. 		Said her vote was about how "absolutely disappointed I am with the Republican Party I signed on years ago.‚Äù	#PA18
Bill Chorgo, 71, from the same area, said he voted for Saccone and is a big supporter of President Trump. 		‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the first president that‚Äôs actually honest with the people. He didn‚Äôt put up with no bullshit and I‚Äôll give him credit for that. Enough is enough.‚Äù	#PA18
Eileen Sudzina, a registered Democrat from Elizabeth Township, voted for Conor Lamb. I asked why. 		"Because I hate Trump is why. That‚Äôs why. That‚Äôs the only reason why. I would have never come here in a million years but Trump is a frickin‚Äô crazy person.‚Äù 	#PA18

@shripal734 Gonna be so happy when an average, 9-2 OSU team beats UM in AA.
@shripal734 I'm not wrong, am I?
Our QB is average, our WRs are bad and our secondary is soft. This team isn't good
Urban getting out coached. JT can't complete a basic pass. Offense can't call plays. OSU is lucky to be in this game at all. Terrible
@DanielStrauss4 Totally agree. And that's why I'm in an okay place right now. But I wouldn't mind a good first half either
@DanielStrauss4 I think you're right. But if they keep playing games like this all their fans will start collapsing from stress
Ohio State might win this game but every single problem from 2016 is still there. Frustrating to watch
OSU up 3-0 after being gifted two turnovers is... not great. Gotta figure this offense out quick

Overwhelming sense from members leaving House GOP meeting is they're not done w/ healthcare. No details on how anything changes from Friday

@rebeccagberg should they ‚Äúrepeal and replace‚Äù their slogans, perhaps?
"Repeal and replace" alternatives I‚Äôve heard from House Dems so far today: Repeal and run, Repeal and displace, Repeal and repent.
Thursday: Rick Perry Energy and Steve Mnuchin Treasury https://t.co/dQ1Acassi3
Next week big for confirmation hearings 	Tuesday: Zinke Interior, DeVos Education	Wed: Price HHS, Pruitt EPA, Ross Commerce, Haley UN
‚ÄúObamacare has the efficiency of the post office, the compassion of the IRS‚Äù ‚Äî @JudgeTedPoe
@ArmenChangelian Honestly your twitter has been crushing it lately. So sassy with the replies
A congressman just used the repeal before replace plan w/ analogy to wanting to renovate your house, but needing to get a goat out first
Tim Kaine announces he will support Gen. Mattis for defense secretary and oppose Rex Tillerson for state
Mattis confirmation appears to be going smoothly, but he broke from Trump in a few big ways this morning https://t.co/yJyzTR8RFR
Mattis Waiver passes the Armed Services committee 24-3, with Gillibrand, Blumenthal and Warren opposing.
Elizabeth Warren, new to the Armed Services Committee, now questioning General Mattis
Really interesting thought bubble from Sen. Chris Coons. If Tillerson isn‚Äôt confirmed, who would Trump nominate next? https://t.co/QbLbHdg1Iu
Blumenthal has serious concerns abt Mattis waiver. But ‚ÄúIf there were ever a case for a waiver ‚Ä¶ it is you in this moment in our history."
Mattis: "I have a very, very high degree of confidence in our intelligence community."
General Mattis quickly gets more aggressive in his assessment of Russia and Putin than Trump https://t.co/dZpxR0bVGi

RT @nielslesniewski: Trump says Price will outline Obamacare replacement once confirmed.		Sen. Alexander says that might be mid-February	ht‚Ä¶
@MEPFuller @elisefoley @recordedvoice Think it'd be better if it were one name together though, like Rep. Markwayne Mullin
He was at the Jeff Sessions hearing yesterday as well https://t.co/EMeCNNJSfs
Tillerson suggests he would support a new AUMF from Congress to fight ISIS. This is a key issue for Flake and Tim Kaine https://t.co/0eNhmTinIA
Jeff Flake using his questioning of Tillerson to ask about AUMF on ISIS.
@B_Delos really wish I were there to do this https://t.co/apACIU0N9b
‚ÄúI find it discouraging, your inability to cite that,‚Äù Rubio says after pressing Tillerson on Putin as a war criminal
Marco Rubio: Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?	Rex Tillerson: I would not use that term. 	Rubio now detailing Putin‚Äôs role in Syria
Asked about civil rights, Sessions just cited Cory Booker and John Lewis, two Af Am lawmakers who will testify on his nomination tomorrow
That fun feeling when word quits 9 hours into a confirmation hearing and half your copy disappears.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get enough awards‚Äù Lindsey Graham. This hearing might be getting a little off topic. https://t.co/549DbsQx1x
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even have a place to hang them‚Äù Chuck Grassley on all his awards. https://t.co/549DbsQx1x

Sessions pushing back: ‚ÄúThis caricature of me, in 1986, was not correct.‚Äù
Grassley questions trying to get out ahead of Dems on issues they have w/ Sessions re: closeness to Trump and Clinton investigations
Sessions says he would recuse himself from any matters involving investigations of Clinton because of statements made on the campaign trail
Sessions says he‚Äôs committed to making DoJ ‚Äúa unifying force‚Äù in fixing relations between law enforcement and community.
More protestors again. Sessions keeping his composure while opening statement being interrupted https://t.co/mavGs4kGTp
More protestors.
‚ÄúJeff Sessions is a person of integrity, a principled leader and a dedicated public servant‚Äù Sen. Susan Collins says
‚ÄúHis voting record is evil‚Äù the protestor shouted as she was removed. https://t.co/VBAr4e0fTT
A Code Pink protestor is being removed after loudly laughing when Sen. Shelby praised Sessions record of equal treatment of citizens
Al Sharpton is here at the Sessions hearing
‚ÄúIf he‚Äôs confirmed and I expect that he will be‚Ä¶ he‚Äôll take on the task of enforcing laws Congress has written‚Äù Grassley says re Sessions

@Marshall_Cohen Went to bed after 3rd quarter. I blew it‚Ä¶.

Pretty annoyed this isn't a blowout. I want to go to bed.
