I would like to see @BernieSanders tap @ninaturner for #VP! 🇺🇸 In 2016, she was offered the role of vice presidential running mate by Green Party presidential nominee @DrJillStein , but declined, saying "I believe that the Democratic Party is worth fighting for." ☀️🗽😭
14) Restricting #appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds through the use of arbitrary #budget caps or #sequestration undermines #economic recovery &amp; #job creation efforts ... and leaves critical #infrastructure needs unmet. -@RepMaxineWaters
13) Appropriating $7.5 #billion in fiscal year 2019 for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds &amp; allowing the funds to remain available for 6 years, will enable States to begin immediately to expand #investments in drinking water infrastructure in communities throughout the #US
12) Past appropriations for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds are #not sufficient to address the tremendous #need for #investments in drinking #water #infrastructure in #communities throughout the #USA - @RepMaxineWaters
11) In fiscal year 2018, #Congress appropriated $1.163 billion for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to enable States to provide #grants &amp; #financing assistance to eligible #public water systems ... to improve drinking #water infrastructure in communities throughout the US
10) In March of 2018, the @EPA issued the 2015 Drinking Water Needs Survey and Assessment ... estimated that $472.6 #billion in #improvements are needed for the Nation’s drinking water #infrastructure over 20 years in order to ensure the #safety of drinking #water.
9) The @EPA is #required periodically to conduct a #survey of the capital #improvement #needs of eligible #public water systems &amp; distribute #funding appropriated for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds among the #States based on the results of the most recent survey.
8) #Congress created the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds in 1996 to help eligible #public water systems #finance infrastructure projects in order to comply with #Federal drinking #water #regulations and meet the #health objectives of the #Safe Drinking Water Act.
7) In 2016, the @EPA reported that although exposure to #lead can cause serious #health problems, including damage to the #brain &amp; nervous system in children &amp; #kidney problems ... an estimated 6.5 to 10 million homes nationwide receive drinking water through lead service lines.
6) According to the #American Society of Civil #Engineers -@ASCETweets - there are an estimated 240,000 #water main breaks per year in the United States, #wasting over two #trillion gallons of treated drinking water.
5) @ASCETweets assigned a D grade to the Nation’s #drinking #water infrastructure and a D+ grade to the Nation’s #wastewater infrastructure &amp; estimated that the #USA will need to #invest $150 billion by 2025 to bring them to a state of good repair.
(4)The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the #infrastructure of the #USA an overall grade of D+ in 2017 &amp; estimated that the US will need to invest $4.59 TRILLION by 2025 in order to improve the condition of the Nation’s infrastructure &amp; bring it to a state of good repair.
3) According to data from the @BrookingsInst , #infrastructure occupations often provide more competitive and equitable #wages in comparison to all jobs nationally, consistently paying up to 30 percent more to low-income #workers.
(1) Investments in #infrastructure create #jobs while fulfilling critical needs in communities throughout the United States.	(2)According to the @BrookingsInst, nearly 14.5 million workers - 11 % of the U.S. workforce - were employed in infrastructure jobs in 2013.

@HillaryResister Please don’t patronize me.
@Whoohaa123 @HillaryResister @laurenbaer I appreciate your advice but frankly it is unsolicited. I’m choosing not to get over it because it is a quintessential example of what is wrong with the democratic Patric party &amp; the DNC &amp; DCCC. How this election went down needs to be remembered.

@HillaryResister In fact in places we canvassed, all across the board, Pam won those areas. This was some of the only exposure ppl had to her, other than a Young Turks interview &amp; a handful of TV appearances. Your white candidate won the dirty &amp; easy way &amp; now we will lose against a sad boi Vet!
@HillaryResister Lol, nope!
@ImThatFriend We need campaign finance reform, fair redistricting laws, and Election Day needs to be a holiday so working people aren’t suppressed from voting!
@ImThatFriend People who didn’t see Pam didn’t have the chance to resonate with her. She had no name recognition, no $ for signs, &amp; no expensive TV ads. But the people who DID meet her, see her, &amp; the people we canvassed, expressed OVERWHELMING support for Pam! Because she resonated with them.
“Here’s some amazing news about Pam's campaign! Pearl Davis-Liverpool, fearless leader-in-chief of the Ft. Pierce office, &amp; awesome volunteer corps for only six weeks, produced overwhelming "PAM WINS" in every single precinct they canvassed! Now that is an incredible feat!”
In every precinct in Ft. Pierce that was canvassed by our office, Pam won! Precinct 24;78%, Precinct 6; 72%, Precinct 17; 71%, Precinct 14; 69%, Precinct 19; 63%, Precinct 7; 55%, Precinct 13; 52%. If there had been anything close to a level playing field, we would have won!
@ImThatFriend People knew about Guilum because it was a statewide race and people care about big races like gubernatorial ones. Unfortunately, people don’t always pay attention to primaries for “smaller” seats.

FYI Pam is being gracious about this whole thing, but that doesn’t mean I have to be! We in fact NEED to highlight what went wrong and what the reoccurring problems are in order to incite change! I’m SO fed up with party politics.
“I spent 6 hrs yesterday in polling places on behalf of Pam Keith &amp; many people had only heard of Baer cause of her TV ads. Despite the efforts of a great volunteer army &amp; boots on the ground Pam lost. The party lost a good candidate &amp; a seat in Congress is how I feel right now.”
“My sentiments exactly! This was my post on my thread last night "Very disappointed in the DNCC at supporting Baer instead of Keith for D18. Pam had the power and force to beat Mast; unfortunately no $ for TV ads.”
“I sincerely think that Lauren will lose against Mast. I’m sorry but I do not have the same energy level that I had for Pam driving up from Boynton. My energy will be for Andrew &amp; when he wins maybe Pam will have a seat in his cabinet where she can make a bigger difference.”
“Lauren cannot win. She is a losing candidate. I’ll vote for her but volunteering is futile. 		I’ll be spending my time on helping Andrew &amp; Nelson.”
“I agree with Katharine. We'll never get our party back, or ever get the candidates we want, until the grossly obscene amounts of money are taken out of the political process. Until then, both parties are just corporations sucking up money to pass around among themselves.”
