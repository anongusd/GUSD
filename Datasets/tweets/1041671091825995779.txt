@wer1rrm @TeresaTeredo @SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump It does because they are not whites they are blacks. Not just family but a lot of people that know.

@michaelborger @DonaldJTrumpJr Don't be stupid, don't you know it costs more to have a border patrol (they can get killed or injured) then building a wall? Wall works 24/7 a border patrol may fall asleep, not showing up to work, killed, or just don't care to work. A WALL never says no it always protects 24/7
@DonaldJTrumpJr Start showing live videos or pictures of what is happening every day at the border.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump Lying again, Mr @SenSchumer that's because more people are working. Now they can afford their own insurance. Stop lying to the American people go fund the WALL.
@KamalaHarris You are the problem black people are not getting ahead, You want open border so illegals can take blacks jobs and force them out of there own neighborhood. Wake up Black Americans that's how black Africans sold their own brothers to slave.
@JoyAnnReid It's no pain we will pay for the wall if we have to. "BUILD THE WALL" it may save you from becoming a slave / 3trh class citizen in the future. Illegals are taking blacks jobs and you don't give a F*** for black people. That's how black Africans sold their own people.

My advice to you help your family first (if you have one) then worry about the rest of the world.  Check TRUMP Job numbers... WOW	312,000 New Jobs, 3.9% Unemployment Rate, 3.2% Wage Growth
@myrouhani @SpeakerPelosi Americans long time ago we did not worry much, we didn't talk much about meds-insurance, We had good paying jobs we paid for our own insurance. Today Democrats want to fool the voters with FREE meds because they can not create JOBS. All they know is WELFARE
@SirGoldenrod @gatewaypundit It worked for Obama, did it? It hasn't worked for those that don't understand the Electoral College. The funded fathers they were much smarter than this Idiots today. That what makes America different from the rest of the world. Change it and it becomes 3third world country
@LibAmerican @El_Daverino @ananavarro You must be watching too much CNN. Mexico will pay for the wall.

@DKnight10000 @RepAdamSchiff He may be a terrible president for you because you don't see the good that he is doing for the Black Americans. If you don't wake up soon you will be a 3third class citizen under whites and Latinos. Look at the positive instead of just listing to CNN. America is doing Great Now
@DKnight10000 @RepAdamSchiff He thinks America first, that's the way it should be 4 all countries. We r not slaves of the world taking our tax money and give to the rest of the world.  I agree we can help others, that want to help us too. Trump is looking up to you to be Rich than to help the poor. Wakeup
@myrouhani @SpeakerPelosi Is that all you think about buying meds? Do you ever think about eating healthy food (organic)? What's do good of having FREE healthy Insurence if you are sick all the time? We need great paying jobs to buy good food and buy our own insurance, not depending on FREE med.
@bevjoy @gatewaypundit Because they want the United State to become a Dictatorship country so they can buy votes that's why they want an open border. WAKEUP America Electoral College has worked all these years why now? it's all about power.

You can feed the hungry without telling then to break the LAW.
@RockGun90 @mynockJenn @tedlieu .@RockGun90 Illegal immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in ways that violate the immigration laws of that country, or the remaining in a country of people who no longer have the legal right to remain.
@RockGun90 @mynockJenn @tedlieu I see that you are either an IDIOT or STUPID (choose one) Immigrants are people that come here Legally, pay the fees, follow the law they are part of America society. Illegals migrants don't belong here because they broke the law.

@theodoricofyork @funder Whether it’s by crossing the U.S. border with a "coyote" or buying a fake U.S. passport, a foreign national who enters the U.S. illegally can be both convicted of a crime and held responsible for a civil violation under the U.S. immigration laws.
@theodoricofyork @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP It is illegal to help people cross into the US.

@RobinByrd3 @JenniferJJacobs You are a typical liberal that doesn't care about what blacks think or who they vote for. The left use him to start a division in the black community. If the left had said it's OK for him to say what he was saying nothing like this would happen. He goes another 1000 will show up.
@ABC Jesus did not say to break the law. Wow, so sad even religious people not respecting.
@The_Trump_Train They have no RESPECT for people that voted for Trump. I'm so sick of the main st media they are sick and discussing
@marklutchman I agree, when one dies 100/1000 more is born. He did accomplish something good because of him thousands now can think for themselves and leave the plantation. Bravo
@questlove He has helped a lot of the black Americans get out of the Democrat Plantation and start leaving #walkway the racist Democrat party. Sometimes we need to take a break from the BS that is going on in America. VOTE Republican.
@cathyphi @JenniferJJacobs @ViviVacca He helped the black Americans get out of the Democrat Plantation and start leaving #walkway the racist Democrat party.
@JenniferJJacobs He is been used by the media to make money, so people can watch their channels. I'm not speaking for Kanye but it seems like he is tired of the BS that is going on in America. Blacks on the left using him for their agenda. Take a break from idiots and stupid people.

Democrats do not believe in justice (law) they believe in feelings. Democrat song should be "Feelings, nothing more than feelings, Trying to forget my feelings of love." https://t.co/HPeRnyoUr6
I'm no longer a Democrat, But Republicans have no balls to fight. They always caving into the Democrats, that's why people are becoming independent. Maybe Trump should run as Independent in 20/20 and leave these two lovebirds the Repu and the Demo alone.
