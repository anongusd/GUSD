Becky Ranes, mother of the young boy who was killed last August will now speak in support of #SB318NH also known as #joshuaslaw
Amanda Grady-Sexton: #SB318NH will provide the tools for the community to better address and prevent #domestic #violence
#SB318NH is a tool we need to separate crimes against partners from those against non-intimate partners. This will inform community response
Amanda Grady-Sexton of #NHCADSV says #NH has fallen behind by not having #domestic #violence a crime #SB318NH
"#SB318NH allows for protection of victims by charging perpetrators with #domestic #violence before the violence escalates" Patty LaFrance
Attny Betsy Payne: #SB318NH allows judge to identify relationship between defendant and victim and be reported for federal statistics
Chief Goldstein: "it has taken us decades" to learn how to respond to #domestic #violence and #SB318NH is next step
Chief Goldstein of #NH Chiefs of Police says #SB318NH allows perpetrators to be charged is appropriate, concise, and relevant way
Sen. Lasky asks: "Will this afford victims more protection?" #SB318NH
On a sentencing form, #SB318NH requires the relationship btwn defendant and victim to be defined to label the act as #domestic #violence
Dep. AG Ann Rice says #SB318NH allows for misdemeanor &amp; felony crimes commonly involved in #domestic #violence to be labeled as such
The dept of safety speaks to the evolution of the understanding of #domestic #violence in #NH and argues that #SB318NH is the next step
The suggestion has been made to align the bill with the federal definition of domestic violence #SB318NH
The opening speaker asks "where do you go when an attack happens in your own home? #SB318NH
The hearing is underway! #SB318NH
Room just opened up and we are headed in to begin the hearing #SB318NH
The last speaker of the bill before #SB318NH just went up so we should be in shortly!
Word is the hearing will begin shortly #SB318NH
