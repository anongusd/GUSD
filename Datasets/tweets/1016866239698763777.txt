@iamdogluke @Uber @dkhos True, I gave a ride to the airport and she said it cost her $80,my take $35 plus toll $5... I couldn't believe it. Airport fees and fees and fees I guess, that's life.

Why is it Lyft and Uber drivers r tipped by only 20-30% of riders? Seriously, what's wrong with you people? U tip haircuts, taxis, waitresses...we're in the service industry too! ...hotel baggage handlers... The list goes on! TIP YOUR DRIVERS! #tip #Lyft #Uber #please
@bonniebomez Do you tip? You tip your pizza delivery person, your hair stylist, your waiter or waitress, ur bartender and even ur Taxi driver- so why not ur Lyft or Uber driver? A buck is appreciated! I give to homeless people &amp; tip &amp; I'm broke. What is ur excuse?
You got a problem with your Lyft #lyft #uber driver- take it up with them on the spot. Don't claim crazy driving after they got you to your spot SAFE &amp; SOUND. You could get your driver fired and for what? One sharp turn or one hard use of the breaks? We're human. Good Luck.
@Migzlifestory @lyft @AskLyft The second one at $.07 doesn't help your cause.
If your #Uber or #Lyft driver got you home safe and sound, rate them 5 stars. A 4 star rating is considered a bad ride. I didn't let you smoke in my car? 5 stars still... You don't own this car- smoke smells it up! #saferide #weallmakemistakes #drivesafe

@luisclemar Well today didn't pan out like the other day. If not for one $20 cash tip, it would have been back to 20% and $1's. I blame it on ground in dirt that shows when I drive in the day plus this time I waas promoting my new driver codEand solar... I can't decide. Tips or 1 big sale?

@Uber So Uber, last year I signed up using my buddies code. He said if I gave X amount of rides in 1st 30 days I would get an EXTRA $1500 but after I got approve I was told that the "guarantee" was that if I gave X rides I was going 2 earn at least $1500... Not a bonus. #34x
I've decided to keep my QUADROUPLE THE TIPS SECRET A SECRET. It could spread like wildfire and lose it's power. As of now only 5 drivers know about it and they all have TRIPLED OR QUADRUPLED their tip income. I still bet within the year it will be everywhere. #spark #toolate

@lyft I got my best tip ever after 880 rides- $49, 3 cool dudes who work at the restaurant Mrs. Doubtfire was filmed in Danville, CA... They were so impressed I knew the name "Bridges" they all emptied their pockets for me! I love it! Best tip before that was a few $10 spots! $49

@kingfrook @TheOnion Sorry dude, the taxi industry is dead. Join the dark side (Uber) or if you're in a good mood try Lyft. I read about a guy who found a 2007 ford with 157k miles on it and it past inspection for only $1000 cash. You can do it.
@TheOnion You can tell when they don't want to talk. Most people love it though! Meeting people is the best part of the job! #lyft #uber

@LynnJurich Good for SunRun. Now why don't women Uber drivers make as much as men Uber drivers? Also, I can beat SunRun's $3 a watt by $.40... That adds up to be THOUSANDS in savings for a large system. https://t.co/mjaKJc9Yuw

@asklyft I'm not seeing the airport que for OAK and SFO... Everything okay? Temporary setback? Did the required cards expire? Thanks!
@AskLyft Cool thanks! I think it would help a lot pf people and from what I understand you can just copy and paste the code to make the app movable to an SD card.
@asklyft @lyft Just a suggestion... Can you please put the code into the next update that allows the apps to be moved to an SD Card (Android)? I'm running low on space and that would help a lot! It should be easy. Thanks!

@dslfkhad It was such a long article I cried twice.
@AskLyft No connectivity issue. I was bummed out the call center rep didn't "have the power" on his end to bump me at least in the top 10. Or is 79/107 something normal?
@AskLyft Well to be fair when I first checked the que on the way back it read "107" and when I arrived I was in position 79. Is that your idea of a better position? In OAK it happened and I was bumped back to #2. Another 2-4 hour wait from #79. I made like $4/hr today, worse day ever.
@asklyft so for the first time I tried the SFO que- started at #39... Waited 4 hours for my ride. 2.93 miles-$6 fair. Tjey said ai could go back so i did- position 79 and no help from support. Today was a brutal all nighter. Can you do anything to take away the STING!?

@AskLyft When I'm the only car out there at 3am I'm going to get 25min away calls which I WONT ACCEPT- but aren't u glad I take the 10min or less (still risking NO PAY)? Yet u continually scold me 4 missing calls- APPRECIATE ME OR I'm going back to 2pm-10pm. Then what? No 3ams?

@AskLyft @lyft When I get a short ride from the airport, it's AWESOME you give me time to get back and be at the top of the q But why send me pings while I'm driving back then scold me for not accepting those rides- It's an easy coding job- "Head back Y/N?
