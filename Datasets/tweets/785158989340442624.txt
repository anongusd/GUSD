@MaggieDog01 @johncusack Bernie has his faults--unlike you, I don't worship any politicians. I weigh the positives and negatives and judge accordingly. Hillary is a corporate Democrat--bought and paid for. Even most of her supporters see that. That you don't is disturbing.
@MaggieDog01 @johncusack I didn't fall for any smears. She has said, on the record, on videotape, that she thinks Medicare for all is unworkable, that she is not for abolishing capital punishment and that if leftists don't like her they should leave the party. It's on youtube, in her own voice. Watch it.

@MaggieDog01 @johncusack I voted for her against Trump--don't get me wrong. But her values don't really align with mine.
@MaggieDog01 @johncusack AOC is too young, by law. I was just using her as an example. But her policies are the same as Bernie's. Clinton is in the bag for corporations--including Big Pharma--and she's against Medicare for all, is pro death penalty and has told leftists to get out of the Dem Party.

In Congress, any slight criticism of the Israeli government is instantly derided as anti-Semitism. But that same body is rife with virulent Islamophobia. Do we hear a goddamn peep about that? Of course not.		I'm not religious in any way. But the hypocrisy is vomit-inducing.

@Yasu_Al_Masih @DavMicRot @realDonaldTrump I got news for you, pal. The Republican party didn't even exist when Jackson was president. It was formed in 1850 as a "liberal" counterpoint to a "conservative" Democratic party. You're trying to adapt a modern paradigm to over 150 years ago, and it's a waste of time.
The reductive thinking of Trump supporters is amazing. "But Andrew Jackson was a Democrat!" The stupidity just never stops coming.
@Yasu_Al_Masih @DavMicRot @realDonaldTrump This is just nonsense. The extermination of Native Americans was a collective undertaking by whites. Reducing everything to "Democrats" and "Republicans" shows you are completely ignorant of history. Stop doing that and read a book.

@GenPattons @KurtSchlichter @FarRightGOP He admired the execution of it, and used it as a model in his extermination of the Jews.
@GenPattons @KurtSchlichter @FarRightGOP Your conception of American history is that of a child. Adolf Hitler himself thought the American government's forced migrations of the Indians over great distances to barren reservation land was a deliberate policy of extermination.
@KurtSchlichter When you Trumpistas aren't defending Hitler, you're defending the Native American genocide. Pathetic, moral midgets.

@Patbagley Unless Trump just hit the thesaurus, that's a staffer.
@thehill Who is Tobi Lahren?
If you're socially liberal but "fiscally conservative," then you're not a progressive. Don't describe yourself that way.
@Elizabeth_Calo They're describing Sinema as a progressive. Eh, not so much. She herself rejected the name. Still, she's better than McSally.
@HeidiPitlor I'n glad she won, but she's not a progressive. Close enough these days, though.
@jerry_saviano @emrazz I know, Jerry. I was kidding. But I also know that it's now a cliche that irony doesn't play well on Twitter.

@emrazz Non-racists always joke about public hangings. It's just political correctness run amok.
@rex_rexchapman Not really. Twitter is still up.

@dermotryanirl @HillaryClinton Don't want Biden, either.
@TitusNation You sound a lot like a Trump-humper, Titus. Maybe you should change teams.
@HumanistReport I certainly admit that I could be wrong, but my instinct tells me an out-of-left-field candidate has the best chance to beat Trump. That's why a run by Ojeda intrigues me.
@ericarhodes I do that with Scotch.
@rezaaslan Republicans can spin the midterms anyway they like, but the fact they are nearly extinct in the nation's most populous state matters.
@thomastrout21 @HuffPost Fortunately, your opinion doesn't count for anything anywhere, you homicidal crackpot.
@AoDespair It seems clear that Carlson exaggerated the entire incident, so I don't see a point to this.
@therulingglass I often agree with Simon, but he was showing his class bias there. You were right to call him out on it.
@MoverS1996 @Genealogy123 @clarionledger @cindyhydesmith @espyforsenate @JustinMitchell_ See, what you call political correctness, I call basic human decency. You'll fail, in the long run, because the demographics are against you and so is history. Have a good night.
@Genealogy123 @MoverS1996 @clarionledger @cindyhydesmith @espyforsenate @JustinMitchell_ A guy who thinks the CSA still exists is lecturing me about facts. Best laugh I've had all day. Thanks.

And here you sit, proclaiming that you're a proud citizen of the CSA. Have you ever heard of Alexander Stephens' Cornerstone speech? If you haven't, I recommend that you read it.
@MoverS1996 @Genealogy123 @clarionledger @cindyhydesmith @espyforsenate @JustinMitchell_ It was a bad Senate map in 2018. You know, kind of like the one Republicans will be facing in '20. And, by the way, if I have to appeal to and flatter racists to win, I'd rather lose. At least, I'd still have my self-respect.
@Genealogy123 @MoverS1996 @clarionledger @cindyhydesmith @espyforsenate @JustinMitchell_ Love how people who glorify slave owners and traitors still think they matter. You and every neo-Confederate in the country can go to hell, for all I care. Just stop trying to take everyone else with you.

@thehill Calling for a "centrist" message. If you look at Hillary Clinton's actual policies, there wasn't much that was leftist about them. And she lost. So how does another centrist beat Trump? Won't happen.
@thehill The last government-sanctioned public hanging occurred in the US eighty-two years ago. So what kind of public hanging was she referring to?
@Genealogy123 @clarionledger @cindyhydesmith @espyforsenate @JustinMitchell_ I'm afraid a lot of people care. You may enjoy little jokes about lynching, but many don't. And you can't be a citizen of the CSA because it doesn't exist, was defeated and dissolved 153 years ago.
@_RL_W @UnifyforPeace @theintercept They could be, but they're not. I'm not saying Democrats aren't capable of corruption--they certainly have been in the past--but, right now, the Dems aren't even in the same league as the Republicans when it comes to systemic corruption and illegality.
@confunctionist Trump's idea of bipartisanship is "Shut up, and do what I tell you to do."
@UnifyforPeace @theintercept As usual, a Trumpster seems incapable of listening. I'm done here.
@UnifyforPeace @theintercept They might be either one, but that doesn't absolve Republicans of their sins, I'm afraid.
@UnifyforPeace @theintercept The opposite is true. Republicans are the kings of gerrymandering, voter suppression and voter intimidation.

@Slate I can't believe anyone wasted time writing this. The writer even admits that isn't all that important compared to what else is happening in this country. But here it is, anyway.
@thehill On the contrary, I would say that it's an appeal to democracy.
@realDonaldTrump Too little, too late. You made your opinion on this subject clear yesterday.

@prestoawake123 A governorship in Kansas, a house seat in Georgia, some less publicized silver linings.
@emrazz Beto was out of fucks to give.
@benwikler @Tony4WI Baldwin won easily. It shouldn't be this close.
@FewingsDan @thedailybeast That's me, dude.
Steve Schmidt put it well tonight: It's not Democrat v. Republican, it's urban v. rural. And the odds, in the long run, don't look good for the country mice.
@MKGenest It wasn't a bad night. Beto lost by three points--in Texas.
@Wolfrum Yeah, elections are fun. Kind of like the DT's are fun.
@jess_mc Doesn't take the sting out of the loss of Andrew Gillum, but it's good.
@LeahVukmir Tammy Baldwin beat your ass. How nice.
@thedailybeast There's nothing I can say about Sarah Sanders that isn't negative, so I'll pass.
Congratulations, Kendra Horn. Oklahoma!
Iowa's 4th district is reelecting a Nazi. Congratulations, douchebags.
@Limeylizzie Florida will regret this.
@GottaLaff An impressive man. We haven't heard the last from him.
Your loss, Florida.
Gillum, class to the end.
@rtraister Take heart. Tammy Baldwin got reelected here in Wisconsin.
@Clint_Black I agree. One of the best debut albums of all time. In any genre. I'm with you, Clint. Musically, at least.
Everybody thought the Montana senate race would be close. Uh, not so much.
@Limeylizzie @RyanZinke And Kansas' governor flipped. Kansas, for Christ's sake.
@Limeylizzie @RyanZinke A good night overall. Not what we hoped for, but I'll take it.
@msextonNY @MarkHarrisNYC I'm on your side. I won't argue. Good night for my home state Wisconsin, too.
@kumailn We haven't heard the last from Beto. He'll be back.
@kenolin1 @SenatorHeitkamp @BetoORourke @JennyWilsonUT Also, the great state of Wisconsin seems to have come to its senses. The governor's race isn't over, but it looks it good.
@MarkHarrisNYC Wasn't a blue wave. But a blue ripple. I'll take it.
Dems take the house. Yes!
@cdashiell Especially Georgia. Hopelessly corrupt.
@kenolin1 @BetoORourke Pete Sessions lost, though, Ken. Not bad.
@NiallStanage I didn't think he'd win. But he came very close. Give him a little credit.
@kenolin1 @SenatorHeitkamp Same thing in Texas. Beto O' Rourke gave it all he had. Here's to him.
@thehill That's where its at.
@kenolin1 Both my wives were suburban women. You gotta dig 'em.
@Elizabeth_Calo Hold on, the Coffeyville vote ain't in yet. üòÇ
@ddale8 Extremely narrow. If not for voter ID disenfranchisement, he would have lost.
@MAGA_DAVIDSON That is not true.
@TheRickWilson Please Jesus, no recounts.
Why is it always Florida?
@Limeylizzie When I worked for the Kerry campaign in '04, I met Brown. Good guy, good senator.
@MSNBC @NBCNews Easy win.
Sherrod Brown, one of our better senators, wins easily.
@emrazz Wow.
@thehill And the least surprising result of the night is...
@jess_mc Listening to "Ripple" by the Dead. A good song for tonight.
@Stop_Trump20 I can live with that.

@cogita_semper @ndrew_lawrence I gave him the benefit of the doubt concerning his knowledge of the definition of the word nationalism. His intentions are only too clear.
@FleutyMae @ndrew_lawrence You didn't look at the second definition: "a great or too great love of your own country."
@cogita_semper @ndrew_lawrence Only if you don't understand English, comrade.
@SpasticusA @HighElfCummies @ndrew_lawrence I'm glad you two idiots are enjoying your meaningless conversation. You might try to shut up and crack a book once in a while. But that appears to be beyond your meager powers.
@HighElfCummies @ndrew_lawrence No, that's not what it means. It means that you believe your nation is superior to all others and because of that you have a right to conquer other nations. Nationalism always comes with a belief in racial superiority, and it is always militaristic. Read some goddamn history.

@Gina71757 @thehill @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @KellyannePolls @PressSec That's a few. Trump lies fifty times a day, at least. I'd be here all week trying to count them all.

With over 300 million firearms in America, anywhere is a potential killing ground, but some people persist in believing reality will never touch them.
@jasonagastrich My point is I don't think we are exceptional. Never were. This is the only nation that continually has to proclaim that it's the "greatest country in the world." Only a people that doubts its greatness would do that.

@RNickGorton @RolleiCamera @politico You apparently didn't read the part that said government and healthcare providers are unwilling to address the larger problems.
@RNickGorton @RolleiCamera @politico He didn't condone violence. He said people might act unreasonably if they're in pain. That's just the truth. This is a large, many-faceted problem. And the patients aren't the only ones to blame.
@politico A main reason--not the only one--this is happening is that the only thing many people in power care about is cutting taxes and slashing services. A lot of folks have no recourse and here is the result.

@hawkins_troy @thehill I realize that your questions are rhetorical, but Barrett says her religion is Catholic. Speaking as a former Catholic who has examined this woman's beliefs, they don't really resemble the type of Roman Catholicism I grew up in.

@KaraCalavera I'm a liberal, Kara, an FDR liberal. I'm a New Dealer, basically. Tell me where I went wrong. I voted for Hillary. I can't criticize my own side?
@coldwomaninmn @KaraCalavera I'll give you the Hillary definition: pro-war, pro-death penalty, pro-corporate power; anti-single payer healthcare, anti-universal education, anti-prison reform. What really is the difference between centrist Dems and the Republicans? I can't see it.
@MacinEwa @KaraCalavera @WendyOboy Because the corporate Democrats hate the real left more than they hate Trump. They're as bad as he is.
@KaraCalavera No, what you're trying to do is push the centrist Democrat agenda, and I won't capitulate to it. So, now, block me.
@KaraCalavera @WendyOboy I won't play this game. I can admire Tammy Duckworth--a war hero--and still think she's totally wrong about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is totally genuine in her beliefs--which I share.

@robeson_isabel @MyLiberty2020 @SenKamalaHarris You're wrong, of course. But when did that ever stop a conservative? King was moving even farther to the left politically when he was killed. He was a Christian, of course, but not your kind of Christian, so you have to lie about it.
