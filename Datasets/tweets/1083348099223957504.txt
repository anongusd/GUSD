@mzjacobson @renew_economy Good news. Renewables and natural saved them the other day when blackouts happened due to 2 coal plant's going off line from high power demand.
@MikeBloomberg Can we still considered eliminating all coal globally within 1-3 yrs? It is do-able.
@GovernorTomWolf @CeaseFirePA That's a good one to ensure someone is doing something about global background checks.  Is that system developed yet to check for global backgrounds checks? I would assume it is done.
Besides using money as a reason to relax on environmental standards, 	"The Environmental Protection Agency proposed yet another weakening of an Obama-era regulation in Jan, this time targeting toxic chemicals from oil and coal-fired power plants." https://t.co/ZJC025NaVr
@ProfStrachan @ClimateGroup Yes! We all need some acceleration.  Strong support to end coal within 1-3 yrs. Leaving more time on back end to achieve more objectives. 		What would really help is the increase of solar on houses buildings etc. Good backup and can take strain off current grid reducing blackouts

@Ilhan some areas because two coal plants failed to go on.  However their renewables helped get it back on line in order to cover the demand from high temp's up to 120 degrees in Australia. Another win would be individuals home solar. In the case in MN anyone with solar for their home..
