Congress has restored funding of appropriated activities and the National Archives has begun to resume normal operations. Staff will be recalled in a phased manner and should wait to hear from a supervisor before reporting to work.
We‚Äôre sorry, but we will not be posting updates to our social media channels during the government shutdown. Also, all National Archives facilities are closed and activities are canceled until further notice. We‚Äôll be back as soon as possible!

Their mission was a crucial step in the effort to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.

@MrsSlaviero @bpbroncos Alex: Lots of history classes in high school &amp; college, then went on to  study Archives Management. Getting the in-class knowledge gives you an idea of what it's like to be an Archivist, but it‚Äôs even better to get hands on experience working in an Archives. #AskAnArchivist
@MrsSlaviero @bpbroncos Matt: Lately it varies a lot, which I really love. I help people find records in the research room, answer questions from people all over the world, and I get to work with historical documents from the Civil War up to just last year. #AskAnArchivist

@brianjnc @PamelaSW Hi @brianjnc, you can contact Archives2reference@nara.gov for more information about muster rolls from this period.
@MrsSlaviero @bpbroncos Lauren: The Great Molasses Flood- https://t.co/chPN01bRjz Sadly, much more tragic than the name would suggest. #AskAnArchivst
@MrsSlaviero @bpbroncos Other materials need special boxes to make sure they‚Äôre supported. Conservators can remove mold, repair torn paper, and flatten documents that are too crumpled to read. #AskAnArchivist
@MrsSlaviero @bpbroncos Lauren: It depends on what an item is made out of, and what condition it‚Äôs in. We make sure documents and artifacts are in non-acidic containers, and they‚Äôre shielded from light damage. Some materials need to be put in cold storage. #AskAnArchivist
@FDRLibrary If you could go back in time and travel somewhere with FDR or Eleanor, where would you go? #AskAnArchivist
@BSLW Alex: A-D Strips - They are strips that measure the extent of film degradation or vinegar syndrome. They help us determine if preservation action is needed for a particular film. #AskAnArchivist

@MrsSlaviero @bpbroncos Alex: The oldest audio recording that we know of is a Berliner disc that was recorded on November 7, 1896. The disc is in Record Group 94 (Records of the Adjutant General‚Äôs Office) and captures the ‚ÄúU.S. Army and Navy Bugle Calls for Cavalry and Artillery.‚Äù #AskAnArchivist

@BSLW Lauren: Novelty bandaids, for when you get vicious cardboard box papercuts. #AskAnArchivist
@BSLW Matt: A pencil! I usually have 3 or 4 in my pockets by the end of each day. Since I work with photographs, gloves are also the tool I can‚Äôt work without. #AskAnArchivist
@CrochetCats Lauren: Some of the oldest records in the National Archives are from the 1600s, in the Danish Virgin Islands record group! #AskAnArchivist
Label is in Danish, so not sure what the crime was. Here‚Äôs a photo of the amazing box conservators made for it- https://t.co/WRkDc8iKV6  #AskAnArchivist
Lauren: The coolest thing I‚Äôve found while processing paper records is a knife used as evidence in a trial. It dates to 1904 and was in a folder of court cases from the Danish Virgin Islands.  #AskAnArchivist
@laurierobey Alex: I have an MA in History and an MLIS in Library Science/Archives Management. Before starting at the National Archives, I interned at several locations in Boston area working with both textual and motion picture records. #AskAnArchivist
@laurierobey Lauren: I have an MA in Public History, and have about 5 yrs exp in archaeological museum and archival collections management #AskAnArchivist
@laurierobey Matt: My MA is in Museum &amp; Exhibition Studies and a lot of my experience came from working with an art gallery that specialized in prints. I interned at different museums in the Chicago area and wrote my thesis about archival theory applied to community archives. #AskAnArchivist
@JMUSpeColl We don‚Äôt usually promote that in our finding aids or catalog descriptions, but we‚Äôd never alter the record to remove the insensitivities. #AskAnArchivist
@JMUSpeColl We tend to keep the records as they are in most cases, particularly with respect to how agencies mention cultural groups, because it is a part of the nation‚Äôs history.  #AskAnArchivist
@JMUSpeColl Matt: The sensitivity depends on what exactly the records contain. FOIA governs a lot of our sensitive materials and the most commonly used redaction tends to cover Personally Identifiable Information. #AskAnArchivist
@Gisseppii You can also read more about the film‚Äôs creation in an Unwritten Record Blog Post: https://t.co/R9zezVTKFu. #AskAnArchivist
@Gisseppii Alex: One of my favorite items in our holdings is the film, 200, created by a student filmmaker for the United States‚Äô Bicentennial celebration. The film speaks for itself. It can be viewed on the National Archives Youtube channel: https://t.co/mhf4bKaMyO.
@kittyBBQ @laurenbgood @TheWittliff @txstmfa @PersonaLitMag Lauren: That we get to read all of the records!		Alex: That the Motion Picture Branch staff just watches movies all day!		Matt: Everything is digital and we use one giant database to access it all!	#AskAnArchivist https://t.co/WDRhFFqULv
Hi, we‚Äôre Matthew, Alex, and Lauren, and we process photographic, audiovisual, and textual records in College Park! We'll be answering questions from 10 am to 11 am. Ask away! #AskAnArchivist https://t.co/CSzEogRrNy
This was a blast! The future is digital, and all of us as archvists need to ensure that history is relevant.	Let's keep the conversation going! You can find me at @PamelaSW #AskAnArchivist https://t.co/x5PY9Jncw6
We have about 53 million digital objects in https://t.co/UxHBP7pek8. Our strategic goal is to get to 500 million by FY 2024. After that, it is on to our first billion. Then only 14 billion to go to have all of our records online. Easy! üí™ #AskAnArchivist
@EllenGleashon That the past is prologue, that history is relavent to today's events, and that public knowledge of history is vital to a democracy. #AskAnArchivist
@psyckology @gvsulib We have 15 billion pages @USNatArchives, but only 52 million are available online in https://t.co/UxHBP7pek8, so there's lots that people aren't aware of here. Part of our mission is to get as much online as possible so people can discover our treasures! #AskAnArchivist

Shout out to some great Innovation staff who work on the exciting collaborative project @SNACcooperative! @dinaherbert and @JerryCSimmons do amazing work! #AskAnArchivist
@kittyBBQ @laurenbgood @TheWittliff @txstmfa @PersonaLitMag One of the most common misconceptions is about archives, and how people have to come in to "discover dusty records" when archivists dedicate their lives to making records available to the public! #AskAnArchivist

Article VII describes the ratification process for the #Constitution. It called for special state ratifying conventions. Nine states were required to enact the Constitution. Rhode Island became the 13th state to ratify the Constitution in 1790. #ConstitutionDay
Article VI states that Federal law is supreme, or higher than, state and local laws. This means that if a state law conflicts with a Federal law, Federal law takes precedence. #ConstitutionDay #Constitution
Or, two-thirds of state legislatures can submit an application to Congress, and then Congress calls a national convention at which states propose amendments. Three-fourths of state legislatures or state conventions must vote in favor of an amendment to ratify it. #ConstitutionDay
Article V explains the amendment process, which is different and more difficult than the process for making laws. When two-thirds of the Senate and two-thirds of the House of Representatives vote to change the #Constitution, an amendment goes to the state legislatures for a vote.
Congress may pass Federal laws regarding how states honor other states‚Äô laws and records. #ConstitutionDay #Constitution
Article IV outlines states‚Äô powers in relationship to each other. States have the authority to create and enforce their own laws but must respect and help enforce the laws of other states. #ConstitutionDay
The Federal Convention left much of the work of planning the court system to the First Congress. The 1789 Judiciary Act created the three-tiered court system in place today. #ConstitutionDay #Constitution
Article III establishes the Judicial Branch with the U.S. Supreme Court as the federal court system‚Äôs highest court. It specifies that Federal judges be appointed for life unless they commit a serious crime. #ConstitutionDay
The 12th and 25th Amendments modified some of these rules. #ConstitutionDay #Constitution
Article II details the Executive Branch and the offices of the President and Vice President. It lays down rules for electing the President (through the Electoral College), eligibility (must be a natural-born citizen at least 35 years old), and term length. #ConstitutionDay
This bicameral Congress was a compromise between the large states, which wanted representation based on population, and the small ones, which wanted the states to have equal representation. #ConstitutionDay #Constitution
Article I assigns the responsibility for making laws to the Legislative Branch (Congress). Congress is divided into two parts, or ‚ÄúHouses,‚Äù the House of Representatives and the Senate. #ConstitutionDay #Constitution
Articles four through seven describe the relationship of the states to the Federal Government, establish the #Constitution as the supreme law of the land, and define the amendment and ratification processes. #ConstitutionDay
The first three articles establish 3 branches of government and their powers: Legislative (Congress), Executive (office of the President), and Judicial (Federal court system) Checks and balances prevent any one of these separate powers from becoming dominant. #ConstitutionDay
The #Constitution of the United States contains a preamble (‚ÄúWe The People‚Äù) and seven articles that describe the way the government is structured and how it operates. #ConstitutionDay
Happy #ConstitutionDay! But what does this Founding Document say? Let‚Äôs take a look at the parts of the Constitution as they were signed on Sept 17, 1787. https://t.co/6N267CgMPi

One of the most rewarding moments of this experience happened when we opened the exhibition to the public. We invited a group of Vietnam veterans to be the first to see the exhibit. I wasn't sure how they would respond. #AskACurator
I wanted to do it justice so I sought guidance from historians and people who experienced different aspects of the war, some of them Vietnamese civilians and veterans. Meeting people in the Vietnamese-American community has opened up a new world for me. #AskACurator https://t.co/aLd7K7oIxL
#RememberingVietnam is the most challenging project I've taken on. It's a complicated history that had a powerful impact on millions of people around the world. #AskACurator
Hi, I'm Alice, curator at the National Archives Museum. I've had the honor of working here for the last nine years. My first exhibition was "What's Cooking, Uncle Sam?" My most recent is #RememberingVietnam. #AskACurator
