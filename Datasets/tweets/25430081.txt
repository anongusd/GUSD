@IVMFSyracuseU College is about more than just the class work and credits. The experience, the network, the re-integration into civilian society, internships, and more, will set you up for the most success. Connections to your peers matters. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A6: 2/2. Always assess your needed credits, those you have that may transfer, and your goals with a college admission counselor from the college your interested in, don't just go to the college that takes the most credits or gets you "through" college fastest. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A6: 1/2. Often yes, but not always, and it may not be to your benefit to do so if your education and career goals don't require those areas in your degree program. Sometimes they will substitute for classes that would be more helpful to you. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU And check out the full research report we did on Post-9/11 Student Veterans, the National Veteran Education Success Tracker at https://t.co/Y3CDumkfcD. #IVMFTwitterChat
Great advice for every college applicant or potential applicant - check with the admissions team and hear it from them first-hand. Don't be afraid to make that first connection. @IVMFTwitterChat https://t.co/JQThTLGA0L
Ditto! Your support has been terrific, thank you. #IVMFTwitterChat https://t.co/vzDKOy4PEZ
@HireHeroesUSA @IVMFSyracuseU Public colleges (including many flagship schools) often admit non-traditional (25 or over) students without any reference to grades, as do most state community colleges. They can be great places to start or to complete degrees! #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A5: 2/2 And you will do well - the average GPA for student veterans is about 3.35 compared to about 2.95 for those who never served. Student veterans are great students, and colleges are recognizing this, and recruiting more student veterans, including transfers. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU YES! You may need to start at a community college or college that won't evaluate your grades, or tests like the ACT or SAT, which are called open admission or "non-selective" (meaning you don't need high grades or test scores) to show you're capacity. #IVMFTwitterChat

@IVMFSyracuseU A4: 4/4. Don't go to a school that pulls on your heart strings with television ads until you assess if that is the best school for you. MANY of the best colleges and universities offer degrees online now. Use your benefits in the best place! #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A4: 3/?. Use your benefits at the best college you can attend. Don't be satisfied with a poor school because you think you can't get in to a good school. Start with a list of the colleges in your area and compare them to each other and to national options. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A4: 2/?. also, apply for health benefits because if you go to college you have to have health insurance or pay a health insurance fee through your school. You're eligible for 5 years of health care after transition, so use that benefit and save some money. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A4: 1/?. Start with the VA and their GI Bill site, https://t.co/Bs49bXkoxW and their application for benefits page specifically, https://t.co/Bs49bXkoxW. #IVMFTwitterChat

@IVMFSyracuseU @GaryProfit And that those around you can often be ahead of you in the transition and help with yours. Many @studentvets are married to others who have already transitioned and obtained degrees or started their civilian careers. #IVMFTwitterChat
@Ebron_Official @IVMFSyracuseU And remember mentors can be former service members now in college or now in careers that you're interested in. You can ask questions of anyone in your network. #IVMFTwitterChat
@dsavage_83 @IVMFSyracuseU Talk to as many people as you can about what they are doing and how they got there - ask what they wish they had known earlier. #IVMFTwitterChat
@IVMFSyracuseU A1: Think about what you want to do in broadly and get the education credentials that will get you there. Start with thinking about higher education - do you need a bachelor's degree or higher? Can you start with an associate's degree or a certificate? #IVMFTwitterChat

@megan_e_howard Correct, and to alleviate confusion, they are supposed to receive timely payments, but using the Post-9/11 GI Bill uncapped DoD rates in the interim, so payments will be made, but using incorrect rates until the IT updates are complete. Better than delays, but still incorrect.

Our most important priority, the reason SVA exists, is to make sure student veterans can pursue their degrees with the resources necessary, including timely and accurate #ForeverGIBill payments. We remain concerned about the details, and committed to sharing them as they evolve.

We'll update further as soon as we understand what the implications are of VA's plan for implementation of the new system, now set for December 1, 2019, and reports that VA does not currently plan to correct 2019 underpayments from pre-Forever GI Bill rates to new rates.
Essentially, VA is choosing to move the implementation date of sections dealing with housing rate adjustments, 107 and 501, to December 1, 2019.
VA is currently planning to correct Fall 2018 underpayments based on pre-Forever GI Bill housing rates early in 2019. These rates use the administrative address of a school and not necessarily where a student takes their classes to calculate housing payments. Questions remain.
SVA is encouraged by positive aspects of change VA is making in their new plan, and will work with Veterans Affairs Committees, VA, and the Forever GI Bill tiger team towards equitable solutions implementing the law and that best serves student veterans.
VA will not require schools to resubmit enrollments for terms that started prior to the IT solution.
What should schools do now?	School Certifying Officials can submit enrollment documents as early as 6-months in advance, and we are encouraging certifying officials to submit enrollment documents as soon as they are available.
The anticipated workload for the spring is normal, and VA is positioned to complete the work within its timeliness standards.
Students can expect payments to be in line with normal processing times and VA will continue to pay students based on the location of the institution’s main campus.
What should beneficiaries do now?	Students can benefit from planning ahead of time, enrolling early, staying in contact with their School Certifying Officials, and avoiding changes in their schedules once enrolled.
VA has provided guidance for schools and student veterans, including a FAQ, at https://t.co/65zcez1VD7 - important questions and answers are in replies to this post, too.
We'll provide updates on an ongoing basis - student veterans and their ability to attain their education, including receiving their benefits is our first and most important goal.
SVA is closely tracking confusing reports on VA calculations of Forever GI Bill underpayments under their plan. We are meeting with VA this morning with questions and concerns and working with VA and Congress to resolve underpayment calculations that best serve student veterans.

While the changes will  delay the implementation of sections 107 and 501 of the Forever GI Bill until the Spring 2020, this time is intended to allow the Veterans Benefit Administration the necessary means to reset their implementation efforts.
SVA encourages all schools to promptly begin enrollment submissions for Spring 2019. We believe the VA's changes are to the benefit of student veterans, as it will reduce the administrative burdens of colleges and universities and facilitate a smoother process.
Student Veterans of America applauds the VA for acknowledging its changes to GI Bill payments were made in a way that was unfair and frustrating to student veterans, and SVA welcomes the VA's efforts to make it right and especially their commitment to remain in communication.

I asked myself many times, “Who was asleep in admissions the day they accepted me? Am I good enough to be in this college?" The answer is simple. Yes, we are! And now we have the data to put that myth to bed. @JaredSLyon #NatCon2018 https://t.co/ejfElITu5y

In the US prior to 1944, unless you were a white male with college-	educated parents, there was a pretty slim chance that you'd earn a post-	secondary degree. The GI Bill changed all of that and democratized higher	education for ALL Americans. @JaredSLyon #NatCon2018 https://t.co/cJjXQHA8pw
