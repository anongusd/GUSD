@Pinkomomma open state borders, so U cn buy HC outside yr state. Many states mandate expensive care that drives up prices, ie invitro fertil
@Pinkomomma There's nothing wrong with profit. Profit is what incentivizes progress.  We don't need gov't intrusion for good universal HC

@Karoli Ive been following u for like a week. You continually deride cons and accuse them of the exact same thing dems do
@Pinkomomma nobody on either side wants the status quo. Cons just want a free market solution instead of gov't intrusion

@Cody_K the dems are gonna have 2 nominees for president running against each other?
@quigbrew either way, even if ALL of it doesn't go to romney, that and the rasmussen poll show it's close..wtf are you talking about?
@Cody_K what you get is 45/43...essentially the same thing the rasmussen got
@Cody_K your may poll  http://bit.ly/y4oI2 showed a bho/romney match up at 53/35...extrapolate that data using the gallup difference
@Cody_K Okay, try to pay attention..your gallup link showed obama's high in may at 69, and his current at 61..that's 8 points...
@Cody_K I'd say you'd get a very close race
@Cody_K no shit, but if he made it through the primary, how the hell would sarah bleed votes from him against bho?
@Cody_K your poll from may had bho/romney at 53/35%...take 8 from bho and add 8 to romney...what do you get?
@quigbrew I'd say you'd get a very close race
@quigbrew your poll from may had bho/romney at 53/35%...take 8 from bho and add 8 to romney...what do you get?
@Cody_K eh? sarah and romney wouldn't be running against each other
@quigbrew I'm done
@Cody_K anyway, this is boring rasmussen has them tied at 45%, yes it's slanted a bit, but is typically only a couple points from averages
@Cody_K even based on your dem poll. if bho lost 8 points and romney gained some of those 8 points since may, it's a close race
@Cody_K okay, he dropped 8 points in that quarter according to your gallup..if he dropped 8, wonder how much of that romney gained
@Cody_K  http://bit.ly/F3Izu

@Cody_K where are the stats you're referring to? Considering probably less than 1% carry, is it surprising there aren't a lot of stats?
@Cody_K just FYI I don't believe they should be ably to carry while drinking. In fact that proposed law said the same thing, didn't it?
@Cody_K murderers are obviously law breakers, they don't care about laws. Conceal carriers follow the law

@Cody_K and clearly these nuts do more to damage conservatives than any Lib ever could
@Cody_K I'm not arguing that.im pointing how absurd the argument is that somehow orielly is to blame yet he was a potential target
@Cody_K so according to your rationale he targeted conservatives and oreilly because of olbermans daily hate speech about the right
@Cody_K he also potentially targeted the conservative weekly standard and according to oreilly, he threatened him.and he despised "neocons"
@Cody_K ask krugman.he says rushs rants haven't changed but goes on to make a big deal about 10% without any perspective
@Cody_K and he says 10% view rush as the leader of GOP but doesn't say how many viewed him as the leader in the 90's
@Cody_K nowhere does he mention that the DHS report specifically of returning vets. I don't think an 89 yo man qualifies as a returning vet
