So, once again, no tubing fees to float the river in New Braunfels. @News4SA @KABBFOX29
Council rejects motion to reconsider tubing fees. Only Councilman Steven Digges voted to reconsider. Other 6 vote against.
Council votes 6-1 to instruct city staff to draft temp sign ordinance
Under committee recommendations, if event or fundraiser is called "Keep Christ in Christmas" that would be ok.
This temp sign controversy stems from "Keep Christ in Christmas" sign that was removed in Dec '12.
Council currently discussing temporary sign ordinance. Committee recommends limiting signs to non-profit or gov. entity fundraisers/events
But now, Councilman Steven Digges is asking council to reconsider. Council majority would have to take vote to reconsider before any action
Back in New Braunfels where city council could reconsider ordinance charging tubing fees. Council unanimously rejected this 2 weeks ago...

No one spoke in favor of the fees tonight.
So you can still float the rivers for free in New Braunfels.  Council members rejected the fees bc of negative response.
Motion fails. No park entrance fees to get into the River in New Braunfels.
No one wanted to speak in favor of the proposed fees during the meeting. However, several residents we spoke to didn't seem to mind a $2 fee
Each side is now getting a half hour to talk. First up, people opposed to the ordinance.
This fee would be in effect summer weekends/holidays, a total of $33 days a year. People are discussing now.
New Braunfels City Council has motion to approve $5 park entrance fee for non-residents but motion could eliminate $2 fee for residents

@RoyalEventParty we had to go east of Houston before we even noticed anything, but I'm no so I'm not entirely sure!

Still heading east on IH10. Some clouds E of Houston. Traffic doesn't seem out of the ordinary.
Transguide signs along IH 10 E warning of storm forming in Gulf and to be prepared!
