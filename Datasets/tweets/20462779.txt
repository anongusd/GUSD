Did I miss something? Dr. Ford contacted @washingtonpost early on. Media was aware she had a story before “the letter” surfaced. Who “leaked it” if at all is not an issue. What is at issue is why, taking into account her trauma, is the committee not willing to subpoena witnesses?
Can’t believe Judge Kavanaugh had no attorney beside him today. He acted as his own advocate, proving that an attorney who represents himself has a fool for a client. Judges are not advocates. When they are they do not demonstrate objectivity. His hedging made it worse.
Arguments of no corroborating witnesses before the Senate Judiciary Committee today are of no avail with the process essentially pitting the two witnesses against each other. This is not good for the country. Where is transparency and basic recognition of the effects of trauma?
If Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination is confirmed, how will he decide separation of powers questions involving the Congress after he made clear his animosity for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s work? Will he need to recuse now? Was this behavior befitting of a Justice?
The trap from today’s Senate Judiciary hearing is thinking that the committee has to decide whom to believe. The real issue is whether Judge Kavanaugh displayed traits of a worthy Supreme Court Justice in the face of credible testimony of Dr. Ford. @donlemon
Sex crimes are by their nature crimes of violence. Judge Kavanaugh’s performance today was that of a bully, especially the way he responded to Sen. @amyklobuchar.  His attitude and comments were not what is expected of a jurist of the highest court in the nation.
Not sure I saw desirable judicial demeanor today from Judge Kavanaugh today. With as many attorneys on Senate Judiciary Committee, that should be a confirmation issue. His testimony and some committee responses caused a devolution that was way too partisan for the judiciary.
From @thehill 27 years after Clarence Thomas was confirmed, all 11 Republicans on the committee that confirms judges remain men. (Four of the 10 Democrats are women.) The Democratic senators plan to ask the questions themselves of both Ford and Kavanaugh, only get 5 minutes each.

@BernieSanders My favorite phrase he uses, and it has been for years, is "in my view," rather than "I think"--allows room to disagree.
@BernieSanders approach is @BarackObama hasn't gone far enough; @HillaryClinton defends Obama, saying he doesn't get the credit he deserves.
@BernieSanders Exhorts don't give up on the political process and talks about leadership and ability to rally people, citing Churchill.
