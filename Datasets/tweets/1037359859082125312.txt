@JaclynCorin I would be interested in where you found your 5% stat. Nobody seems to reliably track suicide attempts (that I can find). The best we have seems to be "self harm", which is clearly not the same thing.
@JaclynCorin Obstructing access to guns may reduce the effectiveness of suicide attempts. That's all. The cost is giving up some rights. People will vary as to whether the cost is worth it.		In terms of suicide prevention, it seems like reducing the number of suicide ATTEMPTS may be better.

@JohnFugelsang But pro-choice people have no issue with forced abortions and forced sterilizations? Or are only conservatives are held to the standard of not buying products from a country that does things that they find to be morally reprehensible?

@SenatorCardin Given that he was Trump's pick, was there ever a chance that you would have voted yes?
Don't assume malice. If you HAVE to make an assumption about someone's intent, and it's possible to assume that there was no malicious intent, then you should assume no malicious intent. It's Hanlon's Razor (more or less).

Do you know why Kavanaugh turned away from Guttenberg? No, you don't.		You can guess, but your guess will definitely be influenced by your existing opinions.		#ConfirmKavanaugh	#NoKavanaugh #KavanaughHearings
Opposition to abortion isn't (generally) driven by a desire to deny a woman her right to bodily autonomy. It's driven by a desire to preserve the right to live of another human whose survival is, through no fault of its own, in conflict with a woman's bodily autonomy.
@TrumpsTaxes So is your point that both sides are guilty of the same bad behavior and then hypocritically point fingers at the other side for it? Because if so, I agree.
@politvidchannel Maybe, maybe not. You can't reasonably infer intent.
Assume that every voice you hear stands to gain if you buy what they're selling. From politicians to news commentators to random Twitter accounts. Influence is currency and when influencers speak, they cash in. It might be true, it might be false, but it's never unbiased.
I may not agree with your viewpoint, but I won't oppose your viewpoint until I understand your viewpoint.		#WednesdayWisdom #BeReasonable
Reasonable people can disagree, even on important things. If you don't understand how somebody could possible tink a certain way, then your first job is to get to understand it. Only then can you have a reasonable conversation.		#WednesdayWisdom
