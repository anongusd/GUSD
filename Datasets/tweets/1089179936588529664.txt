@Alyssa_Milano @HillaryClinton I know, they all look the same.	Super predators, colored people time, margaret sanger, robert byrd.		@SenWarren  Fake Indian and blackface ceramic "art piece "eating watermelon. 		@tedlieu Ed Buck		@AdamSchiff Ed Buck		@billmaher Popeye's Chicken.
@mitchellvii 🎶  HEEE - HEEEEEE 🎶      IS LYING.
@smalltownandrew @annieka77 Q says,		PATRIOTS  17	RAMS.         0		The more you know......
@SaraCarterDC Northam's yearbook photo represents everything that supposedly happened to @JussieSmollett but yet msm tries to downplay it?
@BreitbartNews Jimmy's got nothing to worry about then, because he is NOT a journalist.
@Alyssa_Milano So, all of these families are coming to the United States with ID and birth certificates?	The humane thing to do is, keep them separated until we know for sure that they are in fact family.	Too much child sex slave trafficking happening.
@MarkYoungTruth @chuckwoolery @founder @funder or @founder?
@DavidWohl Heee heeee! Is lying. Ralph needs to look at the man in the mirror. https://t.co/vCJs5Wod9D
@RealJamesWoods Avid small game hunter (other than babies)	Favorite hunt: raccoons?
@JohnnyB371 @TeaBoots @GovernorVA @vademocrats @Lady_Vi_2U @Airbornex82nd @RNRKentucky @Maggieb1B @jojoh888 @ShawnG927 @PDeplorablegirl @Bmw0916Heart @Boyd_2650 @baalter @PPFA, are you asking Ralph to give back the 2 million dollars that you stole from the U.S. taxpayers?
@BuckSexton @SaraCarterDC I'm thinking he called @JoyAnnReid for advice.
@RealSaavedra What are the odds that ralphie was/is an avid small game hunter (other than babies) and his favorite kill was the raccoon?
@ryanobles Sounds a lot like something @JoyAnnReid  would come up with.
@KatrinaPierson Red hat = white hood is pure projection. 		The red hat represents an African American unemployment rate at an all time low. 		The red hat represents a Latino unemployment rate at an all time low. 		The white hood represents keeping the African Americans and Latinos repressed.
@Alyssa_Milano The red hat represents an African American unemployment rate at an ALL TIME LOW.		The red hat represents a Latino unemployment rate at an ALL TIME LOW. 		The red hat represents the refusal of letting the Government control our own destinies.
@JackPosobiec Here's a racist in a photo with Donald Trump. Does this count? https://t.co/z7ldsUG4jg

@johncardillo Is Northam related to Margaret Sanger?
@johncardillo He needed a foot long....... Sub?
@JackPosobiec Whatever happened to The Red Hen restaurant?
@RealJamesWoods @KamalaHarris You're a better man than me.	The human matress has no redeeming qualities imo.

@charliekirk11 @POTUS needs to work this into the SOTU address somehow.
@Fourliquin @Cernovich Si, bueno.
@Cernovich Ginger or Mary Ann?
@realDonaldTrump Declassify everything PLEASE.
@licantropo_max @ugolora @ScottPollak @dmcken22 @SamuelBJonathan @yashar @benshapiro If there was anything negative in Trump's taxes, it would have been leaked loooong ago.	Probably around the time Obama weaponized the IRS with Lerner.	Also, people seem to forget that Trump promised his tax returns only if Hillary coughed up her 33,000 emails.
@RealSaavedra What a moronic statement by @jacobsoboroff 	Is he really trying to say, that the only place these drug runners are trying to get the drugs in the U.S. is at points of entry?	Just because we can't quantify how much gets in via the desert ( no one there to catch them)?

@SenSanders How about we give teachers the ability to give themselves raises?
@kimusastrong @Lady_Vi_2U @USSupremeCourt @Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows @LindseyGrahamSC @DonaldJTrumpJr @mattgaetz @SteveScalise @GOPLeader @SusanWBrooks @DevinNunes @SenTedCruz When do dems announce her passing?	I'm thinking late Friday night or Saturday morning.
@KamalaHarris The continuation of Obama's policy? That ban?
@RealJamesWoods @MrWyattEarpLA KaMullah
@ChuckCallesto Abilio, a book.
@MrWyattEarpLA Please ask presidential candidate @KamalaHarris her thoughts on this,  considering it's her home state. 	Would love to hear her non-answer.
