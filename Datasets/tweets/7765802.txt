Declares national emergency, goes on a weekend golf vacay. Sounds about right.
Get ready, NRA, for the day a Democratic POTUS declares a national emergency and bans sales of military-grade weapons and bullets to civilians — standing alongside 1000s of families who have lost loved ones in school, concert, office, movie theater, church and campus massacres.

@brianschatz This would definitely take the stigma away for those who qualify for Medicaid on state exchanges (for those who expanded it). We had a private ACA coverage with the same name as the state’s Medicaid provider (Healthkeepers). So many office staff assumed we had Medicaid 1/2

@redsox1234 He can’t function as governor. The entire party has abandoned him. It may take another 24 hours and some gentle conversations with Kaine, Warner, Wilder, Herring and Fairfax, but he will resign.

@mkraju @AthenaCNN This is the same candidate who called on Frankenstein to resign ASAP so I’m confused. Is she waiting to see how the wind is blowing here in VA? Because I can tell her: Northam is the only Democrat who doesn’t think he should resign.
@shaunking What other choice would I have? Then, again, I held my nose and voted for Northam when he defeated Perriello in the primary and here we are now.
@haaspolicy @LarrySabato Isn’t this something Northam shouldn’t have done?
@LarrySabato General election meaning presidential election, or next VA LG -Gov election — which would be 2021?

@HWDConservative @ryanobles @RalphNortham You answered my Tweet with a what-about question.
@HWDConservative @ryanobles @RalphNortham So you draw the line at blackface? It’s not racism until someone wears blackface? You supported Stewart?
@tkkeller22 @maggieNYT Which is why I am not a Republican.
@maggieNYT @daveweigel The only Democrat in Virginia who doesn’t know Northam will resign is Northam. Give it 24 hours.
@HWDConservative @ryanobles @RalphNortham You must have missed Republican nominee Corey Stewart’s campaign for Tim Kaine’s seat last year.
@tommyrulznyc @ryanobles @Acosta @RalphNortham Absolutely.
@ryanobles @RalphNortham I’m assuming he has that yearbook on a bookshelf somewhere. Maybe he’s looked at that photo over the years. Surely he’s been to reunions, and knows the other person he posed with. Point being, Northam knew that photo was out there. This is not where Virginia Democrats are in 2019
@lcmoser @mozumder @shaunking @tomperriello I had no idea. I can see medical schools putting out a professional directory as each class graduates, but stupid yearbooks like this? This is high school yearbook stuff. My college yearbook was more professional than this.
@SleepySteve95 a “more racist campaign?” So much wrong with that. First, Gillespie’s campaign was flat-out racist (because he was dog whistling to Corey Stewart’s base), and, second,  there was nothing racist about Perriello’s campaign.
@mozumder @shaunking @lcmoser @tomperriello Nobody found it. Not even when Northam ran for — and won — previous races for LG or State Senate.
@WillWeaverRVA Not worried. Justin Fairfax is more than qualified. And he gets to run outright in 2021.
Okay, Virginia, let’s fix this.
@WillWeaverRVA I can’t think of a good explanation.
I’ll say it. I voted for Tom Perriello.

@chrislhayes Right? 🤦‍♀️ Justin Fairfax will be an outstanding governor, but I was #TeamPerriello.
@samstein Who is defending him? Not this Virginian. Justin Fairfax will be an excellent governor.
@ChrisinQueens He uis. He likely would have won the governorship outright in three years, as Virginia’s Constitution limits governors to a single four-year term. Fairfax could fill the rest of Northam’s term and run again in 2021.
There is no reason Democrats need Ralph Northam to fight to hold the Virginia governorship, not with Justin Fairfax ready to take the seat. I voted for Northam, but that photo is damning. Governor Fairfax, it is.
@Yair_Rosenberg Northam knows if it’s true.
Perfectly fine (actually, better than fine) with Justin Fairfax becoming governor of Virginia. Black face and KKK costumes,  in medical school — in 1984!! — was a really really bad idea, Mr. Northam. Just for the record, I supported Tom Perriello in the VA gov Dem primary.

@markhlyon @darcyspencer @NatlParkService The National Park Service has nothing to do with the Capitol Christmas tree. It is largely funded via corporate and private donations, and maintained by the Architect of the Capitol — which is still operating despite the Christmas shutdown.
@pwcdanica Yes, federal contractors get doubly punished. No back pay for them. 😡
@markhlyon @darcyspencer Yes, but that was before the shutdown. Now the lights are off because Congress won’t give #Individual1 another $5 billion to build 200 miles (200 miles!) of steel-slat fence along our border with Mexico. He still hasn’t spent the $1.6 billion they gave him last year.
#Individual1 has declared war on Christmas. For all his talk about bringing back Merry Christmas, you’d think he’d see the hypocrisy. He doesn’t have a merry bone in his body. The joy of the Christmas story means nothing to him. Why do Evangelicals support him? https://t.co/BBwoKl5xRc

@Motorcitydead77 @MyChickenDinner @thefakegemini @jhneuman @tedcruz You my point. That’s what insurance does. That’s how it works.

@Motorcitydead77 @MyChickenDinner @thefakegemini @jhneuman @tedcruz LOL. You’re lying or stupid. It was virtually impossible buy private, comprehensive coverage before the ACA — when simply being human was a pre-existing condition. We tried. They wouldn’t give a policy to my kid because he had too many ear infections.
@Motorcitydead77 @MyChickenDinner @thefakegemini @jhneuman @tedcruz And I didn’t need my Rx benefits to cover your Viagara or vasectomy, but I didn’t bitch about it.
@Motorcitydead77 @MyChickenDinner @thefakegemini @jhneuman @tedcruz It astounds me that ppl hate Obama for the simple fact that he signed into law the first universal coverage health plan in the history of our country. The problems it has now are due to Trump and Republican sabotage. Trumpcare replaced Obamacare. Trumpcare sucks.
@Motorcitydead77 @MyChickenDinner @thefakegemini @jhneuman @tedcruz If your coverage got cancelled it’s because it sucked and didn’t offer the 10 Essential Benefits. And my point is that, before the ACA, people lost their doctors ALL THE TIME when their employers changed insurance providers. Or how about the ppl who couldn’t even get covered?

@shannonrwatts @NRA Always follow the money.
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had an armed guard. And armed guards, police and spectators couldn’t prevent the shooting massacre by a gunmen who positioned himself in a hotel room high above the crowd in Las Vegas.
@maggieNYT Using his logic, the only way to prevent gun violence is to have guards in every public and private space and building and, of course, hope they are nearby when a shooter enters. No doubt the NRA and weapons dealers love this idea. Follow the money.
So Trump says the only solution to America’s problem with guns is armed guards in every school, house of worship, mall, park, entertainment venue, etc. Got it.
