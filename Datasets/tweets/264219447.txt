Thank you, @POTUS, for your continued efforts to protect our country.
The American people and their representatives in Congress require a full assessment of Hezbollah‚Äôs criminal enterprises. With @realDonaldTrump in charge, they may finally get the answers they deserve.
The #Iran-backed #Hezbollah uses its criminal network to fund ongoing efforts that undermine U.S. interests. Obama officials blocked efforts to take the terrorist group down.
In a desperate attempt to secure the #IranDeal, President Obama‚Äôs senior officials rejected repeated requests to investigate, prosecute, arrest, sanction, and seek extradition of #Hezbollah operatives. @politico has the full story here: https://t.co/zXykVh2DAQ
.@realDonaldTrump and @TheJusticeDept‚Äôs tough approach to #Hezbollah stands in direct contrast to the Obama administration‚Äôs soft treatment of the billion-dollar global criminal enterprise.
In December, I sent a letter to @realDonaldTrump asking him to instruct @TheJusticeDept to crack down on #Hezbollah as part of his important work to counter the dangerous influence of #Iran. My letter: https://t.co/HUlCKk0IPj https://t.co/ZDYdexdiUx
