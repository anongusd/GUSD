Blumenthal on the terms of the delay/FBI investigation: "The White House can define the FBI investigation, they can control the investigation, the way it‚Äôs done, how it‚Äôs done." #Kavanaugh
Klobuchar: "I don‚Äôt think the White House is going to have a choice about the timing of a floor vote if in fact you have one senator and perhaps one or two others on the Republican side ‚Äìthat is yet to be seen‚Äì that are saying the same thing. They need the votes to get it done."
Summary: Flake and Dems are basically saying WH has to tell Senate to delay #Kavanaugh vote for a week because if they don't, they won't have the votes.
Flake: "I think it would be proper to delay the floor for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation limited in time and scope." #Kavanaugh, says will advance to floor only with that agreement.
