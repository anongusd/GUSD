@drjjdyck @bshor @DEANintheYAY @ForecasterEnten @christiangrose Since different people want different things, and think about risk in different ways, it is hard to imagine that those questions have only one reasonable answer.

@poliARB @sarasadhwani If only @Hall_Thad had also written on the subject...
@sarasadhwani Ha!  I've not used first initials, but maybe I (and we) should.  It gets confusing!  I'm also periodically surprised to discover how many people don't know @BetsySinclair1 is my older (and wiser!) sister.  In that case, we'd be Sinclair B and Sinclair A, I suppose.
This looks interesting -&gt; https://t.co/YloM0KLMl9

@slifkasteve There is, after all, no such thing as a perfect system (https://t.co/HaZhesj1mZ), so it's all about tradeoffs and your own values.
@slifkasteve You should look up what the people at @OpenPrimaryUSA are doing.  I'm not sure I want to endorse or oppose any particular system.  For people interested in open primary formats, there are also interesting features of a nonpartisan top-two or a southern-style two-round primary.
Interesting: https://t.co/KKh3L8HfRa.
@MarcStarvaggi It will be fun to play around with the PPIC Data when it gets published - you can too: https://t.co/aF3XSswCvO.  They hold it for a few months, though (very reasonable... it is their data, and this is a great source for researchers in CA).
@MarcStarvaggi @CA_120 I'm not sure there is a way to say anything useful about this in under about two hours.  If you're really interested in survey weights, this is a pretty good book: https://t.co/3iFq5Qz0Cn.
@slifkasteve IRV is an interesting way to conduct elections, although maybe not as simple to understand as some other systems.  Read the Alameda County FAQ for a sense of what this looks like in practice: https://t.co/iyaWP0BWk8.
