@ggreenwald No society is safe from becoming subjects of a small group of those who intend to rule over them. After all, you only need to give up on your freedom to become a prisoner and it only takes a single moment in each person's mind. The moment you decide if you will fight or submit.
@ggreenwald If only people knew what it's like that morning. There is no right/wrong. There is no you. You are a subject &amp; what you think about anything is completely irrelevant. Every person's life is in the hands of an arbitrary person with a gun in a uniform, deciding if you live or die.

@ggreenwald So it makes sense that the same propaganda tool would also be used to wage a war against free press and the only medium that free press has left available for its use: the internet.
@ggreenwald If CNN is spending a majoity of it's day painting a horrible picture of a leader and showing case after case of people unhappy with a regime, there is no doubt in my mind US military is simultaneously prepping for regime change and/or arming rebels in the area.
@ggreenwald A highly successful tool for sure. I started noticing a theme, used over and over, against Iraq, Afganistan, Egypt, Syria, Iran and now Venezuela.
@ggreenwald I don't like the acronym "LOL" because generally speaking, people use it when there was no audible laughter. In the case of this particular tweet, the "LOL" is definitely appropriate.	CNN, as some other stations,have been a tool for propaganda. I started noticing it after 9/11.

We're coming for you Mr. Trump. You and your friends better get ready.
A lot of time was wasted and lots more harm done during your presidency. No matter. We'll just have to work harder. First, we're going to undo every shitty decision you've made and then we're going to put this nation back on track, head for progress where it should have been.
Even worse, people who trusted you are now faced with a choice of acknowledging that they were conned by you or keep fighting for you. You have no respect for this nation and its people and you do not deserve the position that was entrusted in you.
You lied to hard working citizens of this nation, took advantage of their exhaustion w/ politics that never seem to deliver on promises, manipulated their desperate desire for a better future for themselves &amp; their children, used their frustration to turn them against each other.

So to prove we aren't anti-semite, we must turn a blind eye to the horrible atrocities being committed by Israel against Palestinians, on their own land.
@AlexMLeo Rigging is real and only done for centrists, so, no i wasn't morphing. If the party repeats rigging, I will not support the chosen candidate. Let me ask you a question. Yes or no. Was there rigging in the last DNC presidential primary?
@AlexMLeo If you keep assuming the regular folk have no compassion for kids in cages, you'll continue to lose alliance rather than gain one. Do you think if our preferred candidate won, there would continue to be kids in cages?	I don't doubt for a second that it would if a centrist won.
@AlexMLeo Why don't you go an dig deeper as to why we have so many people at the border fleeing their homelands. If you're on the right path, you'll find the reasons why electing centrist dems is not a solution for their problems. Stop trying to tame the left, focus on fixing DNC.
@AlexMLeo Not theories - DNC historically has no respect for democracy when it comes to primaries. That's not my opinion, it's a fact. Fear mongering with "kids in cages" (policy began by Bush/Obama) is not a good way to debate. It's a Trump tactic.	Urge DNC instead to do better.
@FinancialTimes Well. It'll be tough.  First he has to get the American regime out. Then he has to get the foreign fighters paid by the American regime out. Then he has to clean up all the mess created by the American regime. You know, rebuild all the hospitals, schools, roads, etc. Lotta work.
