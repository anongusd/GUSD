Unfortunately… it has nothing to do with what I said about giving people a choice to serve in the military.	Your argument has nothing to do with my comment at all… nothing.
@exfkaty @sterlingC69 @Michgriff6619 @thenewjimcrow There is a choice… rot in prison for years or learn a vocation &amp; life skills that could turn your life around.	It was implemented 1000’s of times by judges in the 40s &amp; 50s with great results… not just my uncle.	If you choose to rot in prison… fine.	Am I making too much sense?

@exfkaty @sterlingC69 @Michgriff6619 @thenewjimcrow You keep saying racist &amp; strong arm. I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m talking about letting white &amp; black kids get a new lease on life by serving in the military… not rotting in prison cells.	This is about GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON and turning their lives around.
@exfkaty @thenewjimcrow Not every time someone is convicted of a crime... is it unjust.	Of those justly convicted.... I’d love to give them the opportunity to choose between serving their sentence in prison or the military.	No one is forcing them to do anything nor is the military forced to accept them.
@exfkaty @thenewjimcrow What does fighting unjust mass incarceration have to do with giving somebody the option of serving in the military if they were justly convicted? Why not allow them the choice of serving in the military instead of going to prison?
@Michgriff6619 @exfkaty @thenewjimcrow Precisely
@exfkaty @thenewjimcrow I know that... what does that have to do with giving a potential inmate the option of learning a trade or vocation or life skills by serving in the military instead of going to prison?
@exfkaty You don’t know the definition of blackmail.	It’s called giving them a choice to serve time in prison or the military. No one is forcing them to do anything. If they broke the law and the court gives them a choice to go into the military and they choose prison… that’s fine.
@exfkaty I have not but... I do know that many potential inmates would rather turn their life around in the military than stagnate in prison for years.		Judges gave many nonviolent offenders this option decades ago.	“Son... would you rather spend 5 years in prison or 5 years in the Army?”
@exfkaty Nobody should be forced.	They should be giving a choice like my uncle... serve your sentence in prison or serve your country in the military.		Obviously… serving time in prison will not have as positive outcome on life skills and life preparedness as serving in the military.

@tazbuckfaster Many are unprepared for everyday life. Military experience often instills life tools that can help prepare people to become positive members of their communities.	My Dad was a Marine… changed his life forever in a positive way.	Went on to become a teacher &amp; coach for 35 years.
@exfkaty Many uneducated and unprepared for everyday life.	Military experience can often instill amazing life tools that can help prepare young men &amp; women become active and positive members of their communities.
Prisons don’t rehabilitate.	The US could take 1/3 of its nonviolent inmates and put them in the military tomorrow.	If selected properly… it could turn their lives around.		Judges used to do this all the time.	Happened to my uncle in the 1940s… straightened his ass right out!!
@amysuds Some of these contracts in the industrial military complex are for weapon and systems that are obsolete and unnecessary... resulting in what amounts to be a form of white-collar welfare.
@amysuds I believe the military could be more effective &amp; efficient with considerably less funding if you eliminate fraud, corruption &amp; waste from government, the military &amp; defense contractors.	Take some of that savings and give our soldiers a pay raise.
In California… we spend SEVEN TIMES MORE on a prison inmate annually than we do on a public school student.		Why does America continue to spend trillions every year on the military and prisons while our educational system and students continue to fall further and further behind?

@CheriJacobus @MeghanMcCain Of course... she just happened to break down emotionally in a very powerful way and I was touched by that.		I lost my father when I was 19 years old... and don’t think I ever fully recovered from it.
@Muunrakur @MeghanMcCain That’s not cool but, on measure, I admired his ability to reach across the aisle to work with people on welfare reform, Obamacare &amp; campaign-finance reform... among other things.		At times the dude gave the Republican leadership absolute fits!!	Respect for that...
@WassUpEH Billy Baldwin tells me you’re a chode...
Seeing @MeghanMcCain at her fathers casket was beautiful &amp; powerful.		America is with you Meghan.	Our nation mourns the passing of this great man.

@fritzklenners @realDonaldTrump I have no problem with that. You want to give a Michael Bloomberg or a younger Warren Buffett or Jack Welsh a shot at governing? I understand the sentiment. Perhaps it would’ve been a worthwhile experiment. But they been on the wrong horse... Donald Trump is a slob.
@fritzklenners @realDonaldTrump The system is broken. Corporate &amp; special interest dollars have corrupted &amp; corroded our democracy for decades.	Some wanted to elect somebody who is not and “establishment“ candidate… not a beltway insider.	They wanted to give running the government like a corporation a shot.
@fritzklenners @realDonaldTrump I’ve known Trump for over 30 years.

I see Trump took his daily dose of 	Lie-Agra this morning.	Going off the rails again with his favorite fluffers... Fox &amp; Friends.		Warning: If you are able maintain an erection of four straight hours of lying to the American People…	please consult your attorney. 👇👇👇 https://t.co/fisPLH1rDb
I love the way Trump tweets about Mark Levin… considered a right wing extremist just a few short years ago and Fox &amp; Friends... the Entertainment Tonight of current affairs &amp; politics... as if they are the modern day Edward R.

This is the greatest thing I’ve seen on Twitter in weeks.	Trump Made Kim a Movie Trailer.	We Made It Better.	https://t.co/OCG6HL9if6
When were we about to go to war with North Korea?		Why are Putin &amp; Kim your side piece while the MSM is the enemy of the American people?		Close the deal with Kim	Denuclearize	Verify	Lift sanctions	Provide aid	Help the long suffering people of North Korea	STFU	#ProtectMueller https://t.co/B2sX8hhybi
@NWR_pic That’s me... just started.	Attempting to validate...
@WeRArtemis1 Neo liberal policy... not exactly.
@eileen_posner I praise any person that wants to end the suffering of the North Korean people.	Remove the nukes.	End the sanctions.	Improve their economy and quality of life.	Make them more free.	Improve human rights.
Good morning to #TheResistance https://t.co/OE1V3ZZ8yy
@thegarygraham Thx!!
@thegarygraham Sick... you da’ man!!
@RollerGirl54 Not about Kim... about the long suffering of the North Korean people.
@IsThisThingOn31 That’s the whole point... that all I care about.	Lifting sanctions.	Helping the people of North Korea.	Ending their suffering.	Improving their economy and quality of life.	Making them more free.	Improving human rights.
@FeysPerson I’m not saying anything that remotely supports Kim Jong Un or the North Korean regime at all.		If Trump, Rodman &amp; Gary Busey can get NK to denuclearize so we can lift the sanctions and stop the suffering of the North Korean people... that would be beautiful.
@IsThisThingOn31 No... but whatever we can do to get Kim Jong Un to denuclearize so we can lift the sanctions and help the people of NK… I’m for that.		Don’t like that we are opposed to the regimes of Iran, Cuba, North Korea etc. and we make all of the innocent people of those countries suffer.
@dtuccijr Thx Tooch!!
Pretty amazing… pretty powerful.		Many poke fun at Dennis Rodman… including me.	He’s set himself up to be an easy target.	But anyone that knows him (including my brothers) will tell you that he’s as crazy as you think… and he also has a heart of gold.	https://t.co/jGGjZY7Ceh

@crazydiamond_pf @WarlickLeslie I completely agree with you... I’m simply stating that it’s a shame that it may lead to violence with people injured and potentially killed because he has undermined and compromised the credibility of the Mueller investigation.
Scary part is… if Mueller buries Trump… order could breakdown.		Ignorant, alt facts, Cult 45 supporters may very well “take to the streets” if their boy is removed… regardless of the evidence.		People could get killed cuz of his tweets trying to undermine Mueller’s legitimacy. https://t.co/bgByJZ2Nkh

@ducphoc He will be destroyed in the midterm elections and if the Mueller investigation doesn’t indict him and remove him from office... the Democrats will after the midterms when they take control of both the House and Senate.
@billytrump234 Yes... that too.

@MarcosG65 @scott28929670 You said... “Nothing stated would’ve stopped a single shooting.“		You said… “Gun show and Internet sales are not the problem.”		... wrong on both.
@MarcosG65 @scott28929670 Wrong... the shooter from Parkland was mentally ill. It was well documented by teachers, friends, parents, neighbors, law-enforcement. That kid never should’ve been within 100 miles of a gun.
@rowdycain The vast majority of NRA card carrying members want #GunReformNow		They don’t represent the interests of the rank &amp; file NRA members. They represent the interests of the gun manufacturers... and you know that.
