@ICEgov @JohnCornyn So this guy had been deported multiple times before... where were ICE and CBP when he came back?  How did he come in?  Would a wall have helped, or did he take a plane, or drive through a port of entry? What's the whole story?

@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed If your wife was about to die because someone was going to kill her, would you shoot that person dead to stop it from happening?  I'm guessing you would, that's probably your argument for having the gun.  So if your wife was going to die due to complications during pregnancy...
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Says the guy with a rifle designed to terminate human life as rapidly as possible.
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Also false.  https://t.co/KUR7V3bdYD
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed How is that not rational?  Your argument is that if some entity gets SOME Federal money from taxpayers and then does something you don't like, even if it wasn't "with" that money, they should get nothing.  States are allocated Fed money just like PP.  It's the logical end.
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed It's not an AR-15 unless it was produced by Colt/Armalite.  If the receiver is true Armalite, I might give you that point, but I'm betting it's not.  It's a Frankengun with a pistol grip modeled after the H&amp;K PSG-1.  And FYI, I've actually in the healthcare, oncology, hickshit.
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Let's treat the states like Planned Parenthood, too, since they get federal funding.  If the state has lax gun laws -- no taxpayer dollars.  If they don't provide clean water to their people -- no $$$. State voter ID laws?  None of my tax dollars...  Period.
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed I looked at your page too...  The American banner, and the profile pic proudly displaying -- Is that a H&amp;K PSG-1 sniper rifle?  Can't even bother to buy your guns from American companies?  Figures you're a fascist.
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed I'm someone who believes all Americans should have ready access to healthcare, no matter how broke they are, and it shouldn't put them out on the streets if they "can't afford it".  I don't know if that makes me a socialist, but it definitely makes me a decent human being.
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed And Planned Parenthood has not used federal funds for abortions, except as provided for by law (see Hyde Amendment -- https://t.co/wfQFLPxtfs)
@Talus712 @prbybern @gramaredhen @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed I guess we'll be closing down all your hospitals, then, and slapping you with a giant medical bill the next time you get a checkup, because most hospitals take federal funding, too, not just Planned Parenthood.  See also the "Hyde Amendment".  This is only about hurting the poor.
@gramaredhen @prbybern @SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Look at how much funding ACTUALLY went towards abortions at PP... almost none.  Defunding it is just telling women they don't matter unless they have money.
@SWS_EDU @RepMarkMeadows @trumps_feed Yes, time to start taxing churches. Defunding PP for religious reasons is hypocritical - why am I paying the churches' share of taxes, then?
@TerriLynch78 @RepMarkMeadows In fact,  PP rarely does abortions at all.  99% (or close to it) is for birth control, pap smears, and general health care for the poor.  All the @GOP has done is kill innocent women in their misguided attempt to save a few fetuses.

@mjmissy @BlueApache55 @HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump I'm evidence-based.  Socially liberal, fiscally conservative.  Trump is neither.  Show me data that trickle-down economics has EVER worked and try to change my mind, but individual snapshots in time that ignore the history and actual mechanics of effect are not proof.
@mjmissy @BlueApache55 @HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump It's all data.  TBH, I gave Bush Sr. credit for turning around the dip in the late 80's -- unfortunately, it wasn't recognized when he was up for re-election for his second term, and Clinton pounced on it.  The '08 recession happened when Bush was already lame duck.

@mjmissy @BlueApache55 @HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Trump's policies are too new to do anything.  The tax cut didn't do shit.  There's a ton of research that shows all those big companies took their tax cut and applied it to stock buybacks -- NOT employment, not higher wages.  The tax cuts didn't "trickle down" to average people.
@mjmissy @MasonScrivner @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump It's called "trending" and there was no "magic wand" that Trump waved and made things better.  Here's the history behind those numbers.  You can see, even the BLS notes 2007-2009 as "recession", and it's all up-and-up from there.  Trump's riding coattails. https://t.co/g73f0RsAst

@MasonScrivner @mjmissy @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Still doesn't make sense...  Are you saying/complaining that Obama allowed other countries to impose tariffs on products imported from the US, but we didn't impose tariffs on their products imported here?

@realzealchamp @mommamia1217 He's not a billionaire (show me the returns!), and he wouldn't have paid for it himself.  It was most definitely taxpayer funded, just like the millions of taxpayer money spent going golfing "for realsies" at Mar-a-lago.
@mjmissy @MasonScrivner @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump You're confusing correlation with causation. Obama didn't cause the economic meltdown in 2008; he didn't take office until Jan 2009.

@mjmissy @BlueApache55 @HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump No, it really isn't.  The poster said the GDP just hit 4.1% -- but that's a quarterly number, and Obama's economy beat that three times.  I can't find any quote that that Obama said "2.5% is no longer attainable", and Obama's economy DID beat 2.5% (annually) a few times.
@Zomabroc @VP I'm presuming you mean you're in the US Armed Forces.  FWIW, the average cost to train a soldier through basic training is $250,000 per person.  And you'd be expected to follow orders, so when the case is made that Iran is a threat, you'd be sent over.

@BlueApache55 @HIZONBERNIE @mjmissy @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump Too bad the poster's factually incorrect.
@HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump And your 4.1% number is only for *the quarter*.  If you look at the annual GDP changes, 2017 (the last year on the chart https://t.co/bvdfjIFgNM ) was only 2.3% -- which Obama's economy beat 3 times: 2.5, 2.6 and 2.9.
@HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump And if you look at the actual quarterly statistics, Obama's economy beat Trump's (and is still beating Trump's) in three quarters (4.7, 5.1, 4.9%):  https://t.co/kOifYewrZ7 .
@HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump As far as what Obama may have "said", the same article notes, "the 2013 Obama budget declared, ‚ÄúIn the 21st Century, real GDP growth in the United States is likely to be permanently slower than it was in earlier eras ...‚Äù"  -- but that's not a quote, either.
@HIZONBERNIE @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump False.  There is no quote "2.5% GDP is no longer attainable".  Never said.

@marcorubio It means you shouldn't have passed that @GOP tax bill.
@JMessyCar @DianaBentele @robertadams7007 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump So what would you like to point at, because I'm sure I can find data that undermines your premise.
Oh, so THAT'S what "executive time" is...  https://t.co/vtoVePPxqP
@DianaBentele @robertadams7007 @ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump "precision" should have been "President" (autocorrect fail).  Trump people are taking credit for the economic situation, and seem to be ignoring all the work the Obama administration did to pull us out of a recession and kickstart the economy Trump is now enjoying.
@DonaldJTrumpJr So why not post the actual WaPo article instead of a right-wing hack "news" site?  The site didn't even cite the article in WaPo they're referring to.  Oh, right, because it's not actually a "lie", it's "misleading".  Here's the actual story:  https://t.co/KyYP7dAxYX

@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump This was literally the tweet above yours, one that's factually accurate.		https://t.co/9PnM7zX1Xf
@gp38super @PeterDawsonUSA @RepMattGaetz Depends on what you define as "the scene".  The way the right wing media has portrayed it, ALL 26 FBI agents were heavily armed and were all pointing their guns in Stone's face.  That's not the case at all.  It was FBI SOP, which covers all bases.
@dokinser @Smariebridget @samilyn05 @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff It wasn't "debt", and government money doesn't belong to a regime, it belongs to the sovereign nation and its people. It was frozen in 1980 after the '79 uprising.  The deal simply unfroze those assets.
@CathyLuE827 @PeterDawsonUSA @RepMattGaetz It doesn't matter. The agents follow the Standard Operating Procedure regardless who they're taking in. Because it's the SOP. So while it might have been overkill for Stone, since he wasn't likely to run (and was apparently waiting for this to happen), it's just how it's done.
@dokinser @WorlowDennis @samilyn05 @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff No argument at all on those points - Only saying Obama did take the reins JUST as that all came to a head with the investment banks collapsing, taking the economy with it. Not even necessarily attributing the increase in oil exports to him, just saying it wasn't Trump, either.
@CathyLuE827 @PeterDawsonUSA @RepMattGaetz FBI SOP for taking people into custody.  Most go peacefully, but if they run, they need to make sure they have all exits covered, and the chopper is there to track them if they get past the perimeter.  https://t.co/A7kpYU3w5G
@PeterDawsonUSA @RepMattGaetz I've seen the footage from Stone's own porch camera.  There is no way "29 FBI agents" were used at the scene.  There were two armed agents at the door, and a third to cuff him.  Watch the footage, it's really benign.
@WorlowDennis @samilyn05 @dokinser @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff He did inherit a mess.  The subprime mortgage crisis occurred right before he took office.  Would it make you feel better if I said the trend actually started in 2006, during Bush's tenure?  The President (no matter who) doesn't have THAT much power to actually "do things".

@King4389193492 @johncardillo From the article:  "If we write a report based upon the facts that we have, then we don't have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia," said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee
@King4389193492 @johncardillo The intel committees have been hamstrung by GOP leadership for the last two years.  People implicated were never called to testify, threads were never tugged.  That's not to say that would have changed the report, but you can't find something you don't look for.
@King4389193492 @johncardillo We'll see.  Mueller's been digging up a lot more dirt than the "we don't really want to do this" Senate Intel cmte.  Also note, the FBI hasn't been investigating this since Comey was fired by Trump.
@King4389193492 @johncardillo Senate committee is controlled by the GOP.
@WorlowDennis @samilyn05 @dokinser @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff I didn't say the point wasn't crossed in 2018.  I said "the TREND started in 2008."  Read my tweet, read the article.  This is more Trump coasting on the coattails of his predecessors.
@WorlowDennis @samilyn05 @dokinser @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff Also, too bad the trend started in 2008.  https://t.co/YKb4K7vjRO

@King4389193492 @johncardillo Of course 0 for collusion, collusion isn't a crime.  However, "Criminal Conspiracy to Defraud the United States" is a crime.

@DonaldJTrumpJr @realDonaldTrump You judge.  https://t.co/MDcJd11KkV

@nealcra @dokinser @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff Dems had no power to subpoena his finances until last month. CIA doesn't have jurisdiction. FBI is run by the DoJ, and Trump fired Comey for "that Russia thing". Mueller's special counsel could have looked into it, but we won't know until that's done.  GOP refused to look.

@dokinser @ggreenwald @RepAdamSchiff Significant debt to a foreign power is one of the primary reasons why someone would fail to get a security clearance.

@ljdrhuff94 @GOPChairwoman FWIW, I did, the earlier reporting didn't include any information on documentation status.
@LisaSing75 @Jim_Jordan Please read this very carefully: Solyndra went bankrupt.  The program that funded it, did not.  $500M went into Solyndra (red). $2.8B in interest payments have come back to the fund from the other investments (black).  The loss was recovered.  Tax payers did not lose anything.
@jwscotterz @OneNJeni @GreenInkBrigade @Jim_Jordan Because big oil makes $51B in profit PER QUARTER, 2% of just their profit is $1B.  The money they're getting from the government is pure profit.  The wind farms are getting subsidized so they can pay off the costs of construction because they're not immediately profitable.
@jwscotterz @OneNJeni @GreenInkBrigade @Jim_Jordan Wind turbine subsidies are the least of our problems; it helps them be viable.  Subsidies for super profitable oil companies is more egregious...

@LisaSing75 @Jim_Jordan It really isn't.

@LisaSing75 @Jim_Jordan Solyndra failed, that's $500M gone.  All told, losses of the four failures are around $800M.  The loan program, as of 2018, has received $2.8 BILLION in interest payments.  That's a net positive of $2 BILLION back into the government on interest alone.
@LisaSing75 @Jim_Jordan I've worked for startups for 22 years, this is how investments work, both private (venture capital) and government:  You make investments in things you think will work.

@saharasnow1 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS There's so much wrong in what you just said, I "can't even".
@THOUGHTPROVOING @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS That reminds me, we really need guaranteed mental healthcare for our veterans, too.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Microsingular @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Yep.  We're on the same side, I just figured I'd provide a source that reputed the comment you commented on.  Realizing now that was confusing.  ü§ì
@THOUGHTPROVOING @ShaunPBrown @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS I did.  I also looked up the actual text of the law:  https://t.co/GG3HwCeAU3 . "THE PATIENT IS WITHIN TWENTY-FOUR  WEEKS  FROM  THE  COMMENCEMENT OF PREGNANCY, OR THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF FETAL VIABILITY, OR THE ABORTION IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT  THE PATIENT'S LIFE OR HEALTH."
@THOUGHTPROVOING @Mike44030212 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Keep your religion out of my laws.
@saharasnow1 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS If euthanizing humans is illegal, and abortion is legal "right now", then you're saying that fetuses are not human.  Thank you for making my point.
@THOUGHTPROVOING @Mike44030212 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS A baby is considered "premature" before 37 weeks; that's the point at which it's "full term".  That leaves 13 weeks between the start of the third trimester and "full term".
@THOUGHTPROVOING @Mike44030212 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Wrong.  https://t.co/ppOmQGgB0Z

@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP Read up on how the "positive asylum process" works in the US. The asylum hearing process IS the screening process. They aren't claiming asylum because they "want to disappear", they want to be able to legally work and rebuild their lives; that's why 96% of them show up for trial.
@THOUGHTPROVOING @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Northam is the Governor (for now) of Virginia, not NY, and he blew his radio interview.  What he said does not at all reflect the law he was talking about -- and earlier in the interview, he noted he didn't actually know what the original conversation was about.  Get informed!
@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP I've never said Hondurans "qualify over Mexicans".  However, that kinda proves the point as to why the US shouldn't be forcing asylum seekers to have to camp out in Mexico, since, as you just noted, it's "just as dangerous".  We should be taking all asylum seekers in.
@eye_wuv_errbody @Microsingular @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS https://t.co/ppOmQFZ09r
@ShaunPBrown @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Only in two situations:  threat to the life of the mother, or non-viability of the fetus.  https://t.co/ppOmQGgB0Z
@saharasnow1 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Call it euthanasia, which is what it is.  And it seems like that's better than the torture resulting from a short life of pain, destroying the lives of the parents due to crippling medical debt and ongoing emotional distress...
@christalroper67 @Mike44030212 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS The change they're trying to make is to ADD the "non-viable fetus" scenario.  Currently the law is that abortions after 24 weeks is only for threat to the mother's life.  That's the only change they're trying to make.
@Mike44030212 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Despite what Northam said, the ACTUAL fact is that the laws in New York and Virginia only extend the legality to the case where the fetus is non-viable, so as to allow mothers to choose to avoid finishing out a pregnancy where the child cannot survive outside the mother.
@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP https://t.co/nz73rwDxy6
@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP I would love to see Mexico step up and help the asylum seekers stuck on their side of our border, but the fact of the matter is, they are just deporting them on site.  Since the vast majority of these people really are escaping life-or-death situations, deportation is deadly.
@jacktsnack @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Northam screwed the pooch in his radio interview. No argument -- but he's not "dems", he's Northam. He even admitted earlier in the radio show that he hadn't actually seen/read the issue he was discussing.  The actual law discussed is risk of mom's life or nonviability of fetus.
@saharasnow1 @RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Chances of a child surviving at that time are super slim and if they lived, their quality of life would be near zero.  The vast majority would end up dying in their teens and cost the parents a fortune in medical care during that slow death.  https://t.co/J2XuOEDIhe

@RepMarkMeadows @POTUS Third trimester abortions are illegal unless there's imminent threat to the life of the mother, so this isn't an issue AT ALL.
@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP That's the crux of the manufactured crisis:  Border agents aren't permitting asylum seekers to cross the border (limited # per day, way less than are showing up).  So they're forced to camp out on the Mexico side, without proper shelter, food, water. https://t.co/TqQC3z827B

@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP There is no difference between a Mexican seeking asylum and a Honduran seeking asylum.
@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP 98% show up for their asylum hearing, with most of the other 2% properly rescheduling.
@AdaJackson5 @scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP Not all white people shoot up schools weekly, either.
@JailJasion @rebeccabw @scharlie8408 @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP And there's the problem. To claim asylum you have to make it OVER the border.  Trump's admin limits the # of people they let through the gates, forcing the rest to camp outside on the Mexico side... or cross elsewhere (where they surrender peacefully); that's the crisis!
@scharlie8408 @rebeccabw @SenTedCruz @realDonaldTrump @SenSasse @SenateGOP He's a senator, his job is to write laws for how the country handles immigrants. And they're not crossing illegally, they're surrendering at ports of entry for asylum.

@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump There're no walls on the Canadian border, either, so you're saying there's a ton of drugs coming in from Canada, too?
@CalibreObscura That's not an M249.  Stock is way too short.  Looks more like a carbine (M4?).  Your website has real pictures of M249s, but this isn't one of them.  I don't see any scopes on the M249s on the website.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/8hp9uP0xs7
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump I'd love to solve the problem.  A wall won't do anything to help, and not paying border patrol and customs agents is definitely not helping.  Sounds like you don't want to hear alternatives to "the wall".
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/8hp9uOIW3x
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump It's not the intent. The wall is all about "the border crisis" which is "the caravan", it's refugees, asylum seekers, and "illegal immigrants".  These people are not importing drugs. Any argument for the wall based on "drug trafficking" is a retro-active excuse for the shutdown.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump That's not the intent.  Majority of drugs come in through ports of entry, which isn't addressed by a wall.  The intent is to placate the xenophobic base, which is a minority of the American population.  Preventing drug importation can be done in better ways than a wall.
@Drew2467511599 @dbroncos78087 @RobWittman @SpeakerPelosi False. The GOP is asking for $5.7B AND putting major limits on asylum claims (specifically excluding *children* from 3 South American countries) while only offering "temporary" DACA protections -- which are already going to be extended because the SC isn't taking it up this term.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Hey, remember when Mitch McConnell refused to hold a hearing for Merrick Garland until Obama was out of office?  Yeah, it would be like that.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Because it's a waste of money on a racist premise.  There has never been a wall that wasn't breached or overcome, in the history of the world.  Even the Great Wall of China failed in its original purpose.  And there are no cliffs in the world that haven't been circumvented.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump For another...  https://t.co/MMX2D3YjXY
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump You did.  A federal prison is entirely surrounded by walls.  That's why it works.  So unless you're planning on surrounding the entire border, it's an invalid comparison.
Trump:  4 people were killed by an illegal immigrant!	White Guy in Florida w/ a Gun:  Hold my beer.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump You would also need to have permanently manned guard positions every 100 yards across the entire border, like prisons do (that's 352k towers).  You also have the problem that prisoners don't have access to ladders, ropes, welding tools, saws, etc.  They're really not comparable.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Apples and oranges.  Unless you're planning to wall off the ENTIRE country, and not just the southern border, you're basically just making a racist statement that all people trying to enter the country via the southern border are dangerous criminals.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump For one, she doesn't have a wall.  https://t.co/ZgZqeWImRP  And even if she did, given that a protester somehow managed to get onto her property recently shows walls don't work.
@J_Shane_Kelley @SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Given the House has passed several bills to reopen the government and McConnell hasn't bothered to hold a single vote on reopening the government yet...  No, she isn't.  People seem to forget, Trump's veto can be overridden by 2/3rds majority votes in both House and Senate.
@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump She invited him when it was unthinkable the government would still be shut down.  Given Trump is the one refusing to sign passed CRs that would reopen the government, Pelosi is not the obstructionist in this story.

@Its_Just_Ric @Surabees @Amy_Siskind @SenMajLdr Actually, no. Presidents do not write legislation.  Legislation has to originate in the House or Senate. No legislation is ever authored by the President. It might be written at the behest of the President, but they do not write it. You might want to re-take that civics class.

@SteveScalise @realDonaldTrump Trump is not serious.  He's offering nothing already rejected; temporary protections for a permanent wall, a proposal not even discussed with any Democrats prior to announcement.  "Take it or leave it" is not negotiation.
@Its_Just_Ric @Surabees @Amy_Siskind @SenMajLdr (checks current state of affairs...  GOP holds minority of seats in the House, and Trump lost the popular vote by over 2 million).  Sure, no comparison.

@jackivinson @RightGlockMom @MatthewRJackson @SteveScalise Children put up for adoption dropped from 9% before 1973 to 1%.  So go do the math if we went back to 9% and how many additional orphans that would be.  I'll give you a hint, 8% of 2.5M children a year is... 200,000.

@RightGlockMom @jackivinson @MatthewRJackson @SteveScalise Well, let's do some math here.  73% of the 1,160 people in that poll said they couldn't afford it. Let's say they were all going to have a single baby (no twins, triplets, etc). That's 847 children born to families that could not support the child.  JUST based on those polled...
@SenatorBraun @March_for_Life I mean, f#$% the born...  They had their chance.  Should've stayed in the womb if they wanted rights. Right?
@RaychelTania @batman1793 @JumpsuitWedgie @CarolinaGirl585 @PolitiBunny She wouldn't be the first, and he won't be the last. (see what I did there with the pronouns? :D )
@jackivinson @MatthewRJackson @RightGlockMom @SteveScalise Uh...  That chart indicates 73% of the women indicated their reason was "Can't afford a baby now."  12% said "Physical problem with my health" . I don't see how those are matters of "convenience".  So not sure where you get your "97% were matters of convenience" from.
@jackivinson @RightGlockMom @SteveScalise Read the actual report.  Your Christian website has skewed the results to sound good for Christians.
@RightGlockMom Ideally, it would be a crime to deny women the right to choose what to do with their bodies, their lives.		OH WAIT -- THAT IS A CRIME.
@Rhythmus89 @ElJefe322 @JumpsuitWedgie @telepastor @PolitiBunny @batman1793 @CarolinaGirl585 Yeah, getting tens of millions of Americans on healthcare, reining in massive budget deficits, and overseeing a huge economic recovery after the mortgage crisis of 2008 has completely ruined America.
@RightGlockMom Why do you keep projecting some sense of "guilt" on me?  And you're not "trying to tell us what NOT to do" -- you're trying to legislate that if your advice isn't accepted, it's a crime. https://t.co/zA5SrKOqPc
@Not_Fake_Paul_S @batman1793 @JumpsuitWedgie @CarolinaGirl585 @PolitiBunny I know the meaning of impeachment. House introduces articles of impeachment; needs majority vote to go to Senate. Senate holds hearings, needs 2/3 vote to impeach, at which point the person is removed from office.  Nixon was never impeached -- he resigned before the Senate trial.
@ElJefe322 @JumpsuitWedgie @telepastor @PolitiBunny @batman1793 @CarolinaGirl585 Pence isn't as obstinate as Trump; if it came to it, Pence might name someone fairly reasonable.  I don't think the House would vote down a *reasonable* appointment.  But yeah, chances of Prez Pelosi are pretty slim... (one can dream, though.  üòú )
@jackivinson @RightGlockMom @SteveScalise 1.  It's not "pro-abortion" it's "pro-choice" because we believe it should be YOUR choice as to how to handle your pregnancy.  We're not telling you what to do -- but you're trying to tell US what to do.  2.  I don't think the slave master comment even dignifies a response.
@RightGlockMom I'm talking about the fact that the pro-life Christians are also the same ones that want to deny same-sex marriage, deny gay couples the right to adopt, deny refugees asylum at the border, etc, etc. The "human rights" of the unborn seem to be the only human rights you care about.
@SenatorBurr @SenThomTillis So you're going to back socialized medicine, because you're committed to the "protection and sanctity of every human life"?
@jackivinson @RightGlockMom @SteveScalise When pro-life Christians stop backing policies of denying human rights to "everyone else" I'll take up your challenge.  The only wall we should have is between church and state.  Also, would love to see your evidence for your claim about adoption and donation rates.
@RightGlockMom Not conflating anything. Lack of access to birth control, including abortion, leads to additional children being born into poverty, fams that can't afford healthcare, or healthy food, or housing. And without that, there is now almost no chance to get out of poverty.
@ThomasDierson @JumpsuitWedgie @batman1793 @CarolinaGirl585 @PolitiBunny Maybe.  But if it's really egregious, I think the GOP will suffer big losses in 2020.  Trump's approval rating is dismal, and the GOP is getting the blame for the shutdown as it is.  If it comes out that Trump is neck-deep in illegal activity and the GOP doesn't call him on it...
@RightGlockMom @SteveScalise Kudos for adopting a child.  Let me know when you've adopted all of them, or at least plan on providing healthcare to all of them, or providing food, education and housing to all of them.  Otherwise you're just saying you'd prefer a child be born to suffer.
@SteveDaines @March_for_Life "Every life must be valued.  Every life must be protected." So you're going to support healthcare-for-all?  Start taking in refugees at the border again?
@RightGlockMom @SteveScalise I would support that.  But that's not what the #MarchForLife is about.  It's about banning *all* abortions.  And that's just a way to oppress women.  Unless socialized medicine is part of the equation, and a commitment to assisting with the costs of raising those children...
@SteveScalise Here's the problem with your statement:  There are 59 countries that allow "elective abortions" -- just not after a point in time (20 weeks seems to be the general cut-off).  You're using the 1-in-7 argument to argue against *all abortions*.  https://t.co/l0sQLaSShO
@AJ_FranklinGirl @JumpsuitWedgie @PolitiBunny @batman1793 @CarolinaGirl585 Watergate took 2 years to unravel, and that was just "he bugged the DNC, used a party slush fund to do it and then had people lie about it."  We'll see what happens when the Mueller report comes out, this could all change in an instant.
@ThomasDierson @JumpsuitWedgie @batman1793 @CarolinaGirl585 @PolitiBunny Oh, we know. We know all too well. It's why the House isn't moving forward with articles of impeach. until after the Mueller report comes out (though with the latest news of possibly suborning of perjury, maybe sooner). But if it's as bad as it seems, GOP Sen. will have to agree.
@Ranba_Ral @batman1793 @JumpsuitWedgie @CarolinaGirl585 @PolitiBunny Oooo...  good point!  I wonder who Pence would appoint VP...  Honestly, I don't really have TOO much of a problem with Pence running out the term as President.  He wouldn't be an embarrassment within the international community.

@HeathBelden @NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The problem is that you're conflating "border security" and "the wall".  Trump's demanding $5.7B to build *a wall*.  Not "border security".  The wall as "border security" is just "security theater".

@NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The EPA put $100M towards fixing Flint's water in March of 2017, it's already a federal project. Gun control is a national emergency because the GOP has continued to yell "states' rights" over any commonsense fed laws.  Gravity is also a theory, doesn't make it wrong.
@MakeCaliRed @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The DHS director who lied about family separation, and wasn't prepared to answer "how many people have died in detention under your watch?" when she was hauled in front of congress?  I suggest you find better "experts" to listen to.
@MakeCaliRed @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr Oh, I know how the voting in works. We don't know what votes we have because @SenMajLdr won't even bother to bring the latest CRs to the floor of the Senate for a vote. He could've done that weeks ago, and put it on Trump's desk to sign or veto.  But no...
@NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr As for "protecting Americans", you've got to be joking.  Flint still has leaded water, and Trump's admin has rolled back eco protection after protection. ZERO effort on gun control. ZERO effort towards combatting climate change. Failure to rebuild/help Puerto Rico...
@NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr He might have been, but the GOP hasn't been giving it to him. 1st year was wasted trying to repeal the ACA, 2nd year on a bad tax bill. He requested $1.6B for border security this year, and it was passed by the Senate with near unanimous vote.  Wall funds were an afterthought.
@NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr And then he asked for $1.6B this year, which was given to him without complaint by the Senate -- only THEN did he ask for an additional $5.7B, at the last minute, with no real spending plan, an ever-changing narrative about what that would buy...
@MakeCaliRed @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The wall doesn't resolve our border issues, or foreign threats.  Immigrants and refugees are not a current threat to national security; the humanitarian crisis is due to Trump policies.  53% of Americans don't want the wall, so "we voted for this" is minority party BS.
@MakeCaliRed @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The GOP controlled everything for the last two years, up to and including the end of last year, when the shutdown started.  So why wasn't this an urgent issue earlier?  Also, the $5.7B request doesn't "change our immigration policies".
@NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The Gov't shutdown started when the GOP controlled House, Senate and Presidency, because Trump changed his mind after watching "Fox &amp; Friends" one day.  The "border security" argument is GOP spin for "slush fund for wall" and "we won't challenge Trump"
@NeverWasABot @SteveScalise @POTUS @SenMajLdr The border funding wasn't important to the President until mid-December. He submitted a request for $1.6B in the original CR which was passed near unanimously by the Senate.  THEN he demanded $5.7B more for "wall" which GOP House passed -- but not the GOP Senate.

@blakeromak @dickius @RepDanCrenshaw FYI, Trump was already given $1.6B just last year for border security.  He still has $700M (just under half) left to use -- but is still holding America hostage over a demand for another $5.7B for "a wall" (not "border security" like the GOP keeps trying to reframe it -- a WALL)
@blakeromak @dickius @RepDanCrenshaw The shutdown means CBP isn't getting paid, if not outright furloughed.  Customs &amp; immigration at airports is understaffed due to furloughs.  Most human trafficking goes through ports of entry (along with drugs, et al).  You want border security, you keep the government open.

@FedexRobin Got a great answer from online customer service.  I didn't realize Home Delivery didn't happen on Mondays!
I am the walking dead this morning...  Bleah.
Fedex didn't deliver today. Still no update on their website as to the new expected date. Grr... Shouldn't bother me so much, but it does.
Bah, now Fedex package tracker doesn't even SHOW an expected delivery date.  That does not bode well.  :P
FedEx package tracking says estimated delivery is "today", but it's 4pm on a Saturday now...  Should I continue holding my breath?

@Grideris There are still a lot of things players don't manufacture (example: BPOs) but that hasn't gotten the #tweetfleet up in arms...
@GeorgeColren Think of a PLEX as a $1 bill. AUR is a fiver. That xchg rate is fixed, too-but the value in Brit Pounds is still market driven
@GeorgeColren CCP controls PLEX -&gt; AUR rate, players control ISK -&gt; PLEX rate.  So?  ISK still turns to AUR.  It's just #stickershock
@kosmikza Everything is already non-vanity, and purchasable with cash (PLEX -&gt; ISK, ISK -&gt; item).  #tweetfleet
@GeorgeColren The only reason a Hurricane BPO costs $30 is because that's what players have made PLEX cost.  It's exactly the same.
@Hostility00 If it's in the NeX, it's ultimately purchasable with ISK, so where's the problem? It's just #tweetfleet "sticker shock".
Hey #tweetfleet -- If CCP did away with AUR, and just said, "The monocle costs 1.2 bil ISK", would we still have this negative reaction?

Sleepy.  That is all.
@lynn_cyr Wow, I wanna attend your parties.  :)
@lynn_cyr People who don't RSVP don't get cake.
Aw man, I smell bacon.  Anyone else smell bacon?  I want bacon.
@aots Watchin' now, congrats!  #aots1000
@stega I probably average that; I'll obsess if I have reason, but make up for it by going simple for daily wear.  ;)
has leftover tri-tip sliced on toast with horseradish.  Woot.
@alyankovic Tell Mark S I said hello.  :)
Saw dolphins (or were they porpoises?) out my window today.  Score.

@alyankovic Did you tell him your rims were quite stationary?  :)
Smashed fingertip still owwie.
Big decisions made, several bug tickets closed, makes all the difference in a day.
@oliviamunn That's why Apple stopped referring to it as a "laptop".  Honest, the word lap doesn't show up in their docs anymore!
The more I think about it, the more I take offense at the "ethnic stereotype" characters in Transformers.
The problem with tea, a lot, is that you have to wee, a lot.
@stega Nope.
@pvponline Supah-congrats, d00d.  :)
Sigh.  Fucked.
feels a lot better, back at work, but tired from napping the cold away yesterday.  :P
@basmatiheather I need to get back to doing that, too.
haz a bit of a cold, feeling totally bleah.
@stega Are you currently surrounded by water?  That might make the choice easier.  :)
@casret I heard FF 3.5 beta is really much better on the bloat issue now.
So focus-lost at this point.  :P
Urge to kill, rising...
@oliviamunn Why's it only other women who get to see such a thing?  :P
Dammit.  I hate it when my Schwarz gets twisted.
Is in the office and gettin' productive.
I haz a hate on git.  :P
Fixed a big bug.  Gettin' real close to finishing this feature .  Feeling pretty good, but getting hungry.
@basmatiheather I love the smell of Best Buy in the morning...  Smells like...  credit card debt.
Adrenaline rush being replaced by adrenaline withdrawal.  :P
Ganondorf!  Ganondorf!  Ganondorf!
@BrentSpiner "no hun" means Attila's not around.
wonders how many days he wasn't connected to Yahoo Messenger because Adium was out of date.  :P
Sleepy + caffeine = headache.  :P
@wingedpig Take it to a vet and see if it's microchipped.
OMG, get me a box of Kleenex:  http://tinyurl.com/n8g56w
Ugh.  Left house at 7am for lab test and at work at 9:45.  Just want to sleeeeep...

@lynn_cyr I assembled a dresser last night and have five more Ikea things to put together this weekend!  :)
Found a bug in Facebook's API that was causing me grief.  Whew.  Only took a week.
@oliviamunn Drop the neckline, he won't notice.  ;)
What if the election results in Iran *were* accurate?  Don't support the losing party, just support the idea of a recount and fair election.
@stega Woot, he deserves it.  :)
is so ready to chuck this Windows Mobile phone, but is trying to hold out for an AT&T Android phone...
The only problem with developing Facebook applications is that you have to deal with Facebook.  :P
Is finally back from a doctor's appointment that involved a lot of waiting and not a lot of information.
Weird Al channels Jim Morrison into "Craigslist":  http://bit.ly/3GrE8
has a throbbing headache.  Probably induced by milkshake and exercise.  Not helping it's warm in the office.  :P
Six flights of stairs after a banana milkshake...  Not a good idea.
is so not ready to deal with a Monday just yet.
I can haz weekend yet?
OMFG fcktards on 1N this morning!
I'm not a slave to a god that doesn't exist.
@stega Favoring bikinis lately...
@BrentSpiner I think you need to say, "Help me, Obi-Wil Wheatnobi, you're my only hope."
Ugh, don't know why I'm so sleepy this afternoon, can't keep my eyes open...  :P
Actually, I'm wrong.  I thought today was Flag Day.  I started at ONElist 10 years ago this Sunday.  :)
Wow, 10 years ago today, I started at ONElist, one of my best work experiences ever.
Question of the Day:  How hard is it, I mean really, to park a BART train at a platform?  Sheesh!
@stega 1 + 1 = 3 for sufficiently large values of 1.
Math isn't necessarily hard, but it can be hella confusing.
Nothing like a virtual fire to start the work week.  :P
@stega If I had that money, I'd build that kind of a house.  I wouldn't put it in Arizona, but still...  :)
It's "jersey day" at work, but it's too warm to wear my Jersey Devils jersey...  :P
Interesting to find fairly intelligent people who've never heard the word "dollop" (or at least, don't recognize it in print).
memcache is the bane of my existence.  Too bad I can't really exist without it.  :P
@wingedpig Bummer dude.  Do you think you got it from the flight back?
Salt and vinegar chips...  it burnses me!
is unable to be productive because our internet connection sucks.
Walked the stairs again, my "wall" has advanced to somewhere between the 4th and 5th floor now...
has a headache.  :P
is back at work, and now totally uncertain of what the status of things are!
Vacation in 60 minutes.  Is there anything I can realistically accomplish at work before then...
@charlanebrady So *that's* what I'm missing.  :)
Yeah... I want it.  Yeah... I need it.  Yeah... I love it...  Electric head all in your head all in your head all in your yowwww....
New rule:  No changing db schemas right before you go on vacation for a week.
The world is consipiring against me this morning.
That sandwich wasn't really a satisfying dinner.  :P
Word up.  It's the code word.  No matter where you say it, you know that you'll be heard.
wishes there were more healthy-ish fast lunch options than Subway sammiches and Specialty's salads.
Might've been too late, but I snipped the flower stalk off my Venus fly trap; apparently flowering is hard on the plant.
I suck as Smash Bros.
Mike Doughty's extended Busking CD, sold at his concerts, is awesome.
@pvponline After T3 and the TV show, I'd agree... Except Salvation looks like a decent grim-future action flick.  :)
Got javascript wrangled in record time this morning, once I realized I kept using the wrong ID.  Twice.  :P
Facebook, you're killing me.
loves when he thinks of an edge case for his code, and then realizes he actually already wrote code to handle it.
I got tagged for #FollowFriday by someone who isn't actually following me.  :P  I smell spam.
Extra meat, extra veg on this Vietnamese sammich was so totally worth the extra 75 cents.
@jessicabenner Two-for-one:  http://bit.ly/gLSgj
Finally getting down to some work at the office...  *yawn*
Just saw Star Trek...  WTF?  I'm so conflicted.  Good movie, but it pisses me off.  And why, for the love of god, more time travel crap?
@majornelson Windows Media Player does a pretty good job with XM -- not sure if it does Sirius though.
looking forward to seeing Star Trek tonight.
@jessicabenner Not with the peds.  :)
@grantimahara Myth Byron.  And just hope she doesn't have a lisp.
took the stairs again.  The fourth floor is definitely "the wall".
just realized how much work is left to do for Friday after re-reading the spec and realizing he missed a LOT of details.
is paraplegic after having walked up the stairs to the 6th floor office.
@stega Might be worth checking out Photobucket, too, although I haven't used it much at all.
is fighting the demon CSS.
is apparently missing many tweets today.
is still trying to get his brain sorted and on track after a busy weekend and non-standard morning.
I finally beat this javascript into submission.
hates all languages that contain the word "Java" in them, and they hate him right back.
Sweet and plain, unsingable name, that rings in my mind now, that strums me like a string... Chime unsingable name, over everything.
cranks up the @mikedoughtyeah tracks to prep for tomorrow's concert...  Leeeeet the sun shine in...  the suuuuuunnnn shine in...
T(IFDH)IF.
Okay, JQuery is pretty nifty.  For Javascript.
@EveOnline Hope you realize you probably just gave away your Twitter username and password to a third party.
I wanna move to Denmark and get a hug.  http://bit.ly/cexHH
Trying really hard to keep awake, as it was a terrible effort to get that way in the first place.
I have an HD TiVo and it is wonderful.  No more of that Motorola POS!  This thing actually fast forwards *when you tell it to*!
I think my little Venus Fly Trap on my desk is sending up a flowering stalk.

My Cyclone is bigger than your battle-axe.  http://www.eveonline.com/
Comcast has apparently forgotten what channels I'm supposed to receive with my CableCARD.  :P
Comcast was very fast to let me return my crap PVR and get a CableCARD for my new TiVo...
is utterly disgusted that GM would shutter Pontiac instead of Buick.
Leftover mini burrito from Friday's company party...  Breakfast of champions.
@NathanFillion It's the GM "Lean Machine"  from 1983...  http://tinyurl.com/c38ees
is missing a free lunch waiting for UPS.  :P
@cyantist I don't trust a service that runs its website on port 8080.  :)
Heard in the office:  "He still has the nerf of stupidity."
@NathanFillion You look good in a suit!  Saw it happen on Castle once.  :)
@MikeDoughtyYeah Damn you, now I'm extra stoked and there are still 9 more days to wait for ya...

My head is spinning trying to make sure this transaction logic is bulletproof.

Stupid cat wouldn't pee on demand.  Sigh.
is feeling not quite right.  But not quite wrong, either.  :P
@wilw Mike Doughty?  Love him!
Overslept, woke up with raging headache...    Ugh, trash truck outside NOT helping right now.

The problem with this jacket thing is the inability to raise my arms comforably to typing level.  :P

@grantimahara I fart mime assassins.  :P
Sleepy me cannot haz a sleepy.  :(
dreading spending the whole night at a stupid HOA meeting that nobody shows up to, to talk about how we don't have any money to do things.
Man, it's freakin' hot here on the 6th floor in SF.  Global warming is a serious problem, people!
Naturally, all the spicy in my Vietnamese sammiches were in the last two bites.  Now my mouth is en fuego.
http://tinyurl.com/c9t4pe
Waking up to realize the cat peed in the bed sometime during the night is not a really good way to start the day.
@pvponline I'd feel sorry for them if they weren't acting so stuck-up and aloof about themselves.
hopes the work day goes by quickly and uneventfully, so he can get on with his weekend.
Aw, denied beta testing time, next session isn't until tomorrow night.  :P
Wishes Ruby and Python had gotten together to determine what ".." does in a range.
Squeee!

Bah.  Humbug.
Yay for figuring things out just before the weekend.
has put together some important code, but doesn't want to release it until Monday.  :P
@margaretcho Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, dead.

I'm bulemic, but have poor follow-through.
is finally caught up on House.  Big doh!
Sigh.  Apparently I can't get away from House spoilers.  I definitely need to catch up tonight.  :P
@majornelson InsiderPages (now owned by CitySearch)

didn't feel the earthquake, even though others in the office did.  :P
@cyantist How do you know which conversations I won't forget?  :)
is still a bit knoted up in his shoulders/neck.  Sigh.  These things always take so long to go away.
OMG, there was a jalapeno from Subway that has lit my tongue on fire...
@pvponline Love Clue.  Try "Murder by Death".  :)
@LlamaEyes No hwip?  I thought you like hwip.  Especially Cool Hwip.  :)
The problem with a stiff neck is that it's hard to pound back soda cans.
@cyantist Sheesh, I've only moved five times in the last 10 years, but I've worked for 15 different companies in that time.  :)
@eddieizzard It's about lunch time here in SF, but I'm otherwise too busy to notice the outside world.
@casret Wasn't bad.  Meat was a little overcooked...
went to the Manhattan Hub for a Philly cheesesteak for the first time in years.
@charlanebrady Welcome back.  :)

left Lady Gaga on his USB drive at home, but found her playing on Gaydar Radio streaming...  Yay!!!
is happy with his bank and is heading into work now.
Okay, bank, I left another message for you to call me back. Any time now would be nice.
Bank never called me back today.  Software fought me tooth and nail.  But Punisher War Zone was terrific fun this evening!
thinks git is the biggest piece of shit tool in the world, and doesn't understand why anyone would use it willingly.
@rikkcarey Lookin' good.
wonders why the bank told him to call them if he was just going to get voicemail saying they'd call him back...  Grr...

@wingedpig Frosted blueberry Pop Tarts disappear around me like ships in the Bermuda Triangle.
