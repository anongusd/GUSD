They all talk about the risks in development of drugs that might fail. Patients that can't afford medicines are also facing a big risk. 		Many agree that these are the three things that need to be done and will have significant, meaningful results. Want benefits to patients.
@SenatorCarper talks about personal stories, this personal, political, economic. We are looking for consensus - effective &amp; affordable. 	Eliminating rebates to PBMs	Value based arrangements	increasing transparency industry wide on how prices are set
Did anyone use tax breaks to lower cost of prescription drugs?	Gonzalez - no	Soriot - "roundabout way" yes	Caforio - no	Taubert - invest in R&amp;D, so no	Frazier - says tax rate went up	Bourla - yes reduced prices at Pfizer	Brandicourt - global company not much of a tax break
@SenatorMenendez Pepople in NJ, costs too high. Bipartisan issue. Trump talking about executive action with regard to drug prices. "Friendly warning" it is time to be proactive to to reduce costs before policy makers do it for you.
Cornyn tries to get at how patents infer exclusivity. Calls out how Abbvie initially sued AmGen. Wyden backs up Cornyn. Cornyn hints at judiciary committee dealing with patents.
Cornyn - hundreds of patents for one drug, Humira, which is a single molecule. https://t.co/X5BHBi9je5
$6.3 billion tax break in last tax bill per @SenatorCantwell but won't comment on market pressures.
Only VA has ability to negotiate drug prices in the United States. Frazier claims the prices are imposed by other countries. So why can't the United States? Because AGAIN, we are funding the R&amp;D of medicines for the world.
@SenatorCantwell Market mechanisms driving down costs - states negotiating on behalf of a population. Does it drive down costs? Frazier - "no single market for drugs" eyeroll
Abbvie thinks they are striking a balance. Stabenow: You charge more here because you can. (TRUTH)
Pharmaceutical company profits are 15-20% and other industries are 4-9% profit. People won't die if they can't buy furniture though)		Humira - has drug gotten better with new patents? Humira treated for many diff diseases, new patents for each disease state
@SenStabenow contributed $200 billion in grants to developing these drugs through NIH. Says high drug costs keep Michiganers up at night. 		American taxpayers subsidize drug companies on the front end &amp; pay high costs of medicines.
Gonzalez - working on difficult diseases (take on risk), when Alzheimers solved, nursing home costs go down, medicine prices won't
Taubert - wants to go after more challenging disease	Caforio - cancer, invest in R&amp;D (bristol meyers squib)	Soriot - best science to stimulate innovation, how do we demonstrate value of meds
What is what keeps you up at night? (most mention investors)	Brandicourt - pipeline of new products innovative "enough"	Bourla - wants meds that save lives	Frazier - won't have viable predictable market, wants to talk about systemic issues	Taubert - easy diseases solved
@Ronwyden asks about other western industrialized countries - does Abbvie turn a profit in those other countries, wants answer in writing. Mr. Gonzalez, Claims $5.2 billion dollars in R&amp;D and $5.6 billion in profits.
Mr Gonzalez, of Abbvie, threatens to not be able to invest in R&amp;D. So please be clear - Americans are funding the world's R&amp;D costs. How about we get rid of DTC advertising?
@RonWyden "Do you make profit on drugs sold in Germany and France? "Yes" and yet Americans pay much more for the same drugs.
@RonWyden - number 1 reason consumers are getting hammered are because list prices are unaffordable, and set by pharmaceutical companies. Rebates are window dressing. 		Senator Wyden asks for companies to lower list prices.
Dr. Olivier Brandicourt of Sanofi made quite a few waves in France when he took on a hefty compensation package. https://t.co/NRjdI5E3ua
Dr. Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer is worth $16.8 million, but to be fair, he just got started a couple of years ago.
While we listen to Kenneth Frazier of Merck, please know that he has 600,000 shares of Merck worth $37,000,000 on top of his salary. 		And that talk of lowering prices sounds good, but isn't backed up by recent reports. https://t.co/GlUJN3AARu
