@Catalunyalad @FIFAWorldCup @Argentina @NGSuperEagles @afa @CONMEBOL Madrid and Barca cannot be compared because Madrid is all about buying the best players,whereas, Barca is about producing the best players.
@Catalunyalad @FIFAWorldCup @Argentina @NGSuperEagles @afa @CONMEBOL Madrid won the last championship because of Ronaldo, now that he's gone is the reason that Barca is winning... he's just not as impressive as the past, his peak has descended.

@kr10000009 @DrShalomim @alllibertynews @dcal4570 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos The point is, do you know WHY or what do you THINK is the reason? Think of what they're doing to the Muslims in Palestine.
@DrShalomim @kr10000009 @alllibertynews @dcal4570 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos They are Jews, but Persian that's why. Their conflict, first, is ethnic identification and THEN religion.
@ElPatriotaA1776 Do they give EVERY ethnic group a thought though? When it comes to policy or even their own opinions? No, many are biased.
@kr10000009 @alllibertynews @dcal4570 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Now, will YOU show me some courtesy?
@ElPatriotaA1776 Those are all opinions and are irrelevant in science. They're showing FACTS. Look at how technologically advanced those nations are, without religion.
@DrShalomim @kr10000009 @alllibertynews @dcal4570 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Interesting. I didn't know that and I appreciate that, but you can say that about ALL nationalities or ethnic groups. We've all split from the same roots and diversified after our ancestors resettled.

@ElPatriotaA1776 In the past, NOW we need to follow truth and logic, which science provides. Look at the SAME conflicts, over religion, that are still happening.
@DrShalomim @kr10000009 @alllibertynews @dcal4570 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos No, they are not. Semites are Arabs and Persians are known as Aryan. Get YOUR facts right.

@kr10000009 @alllibertynews @dcal4570 @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Religion is such an ancient ideology and we need to rid ourselves of all religions. We are in a new age of information and logic, and it seems that people are still, not using them the right way.

@dcal4570 @alllibertynews @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos You're right, he did. I admit, I need more information, but international relations calls for diplomacy and neutrality. One thing is certain, that Iran is completely misunderstood in its current conditions.
@dcal4570 @alllibertynews @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos That's incorrect. Shiite Muslims are not terrorists. Those are the Sunnis, which includes Saudi Arabia... If you actually look into it, the religious leaders didn't take over the country, they helped liberate the country from tyranny and they have a president whom they vote for.

@ScottieCoops @alllibertynews @GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos That should be irrelevant though, Iran is simply trying to join the rest of the world. They're ready and they're not dangerous. All these nation's, even North Korea and Russia are only interested in protecting their land, not invading other nations.
@GovJVentura @Brigida__Santos Saudi Arabia and Israel, as allies of the U.S.,  SHOULD be replaced by Iran. They are not out to destroy the U.S. they are Shiite Muslims and the terrorists we are fighting are ALL Sunni Muslim. Also, why would we still be supporting a monarchy anyways?
