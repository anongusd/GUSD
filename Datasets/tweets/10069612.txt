He is one of more than 700 IAM members at Kennedy Space Center who are affected by the shutdown.
Barring unprecedented action from Congress, federal contractors like Ching wont receive back pay when the shutdown ends. Ching has had to dip into savings ‚Äújust to tread water,‚Äù and has two coworkers with special needs children who his IAM Brothers and Sisters are trying to help.
Ching, 15-year @MachinistsUnion Local 2061 member &amp; current VP of his local, monitors &amp; maintains the Space Center‚Äôs power grid. During the shutdown, only 2 electricians are doing the work of 10, putting NASA‚Äôs mission, including the International Space Station, at risk.
