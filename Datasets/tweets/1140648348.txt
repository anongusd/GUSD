Another radical right-wing vote should not be elevated to the nation‚Äôs highest court and this nomination deserves rigorous scrutiny from the Senate. The freedoms and rights of women and minorities, as well as the health of all American families, hang in the balance.
Donald Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court pick is a brazen attack on a woman‚Äôs right to control her own body and every American‚Äôs right to health care, as Judge Brett Kavanaugh‚Äôs record suggests an eagerness to erode or overturn Roe v. Wade, and an open hostility to the Affordable Care Act.
Any Supreme Court nominee who threatens health care protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions is simply unacceptable. Americans have already spoken out against Trump's attempts to restrict health care access - and we can't let him do it with his announcement tonight.
