@CriticalRiposte You aren‚Äôt making sense because a slave was a slave. Anyone with ‚Äúslave‚Äù status was... a slave.
@CriticalRiposte He OWNED her. As a slave. Same as any other slave. He could beat her, torture her, get away with murdering her if he wanted to. I don‚Äôt see what is difficult about this.
@CriticalRiposte There is no situation where a slave can give consent, wtf?

@ParisaMichelle @Bl3nder_LDG @babylonscared @amazingatheist Yes, lol	Many atheists know about religions‚Äîpart of the reason many of us r atheists (learning more about different religions &amp; through that learning to think critically about ones we may have had) ;P		I abhor the Baha‚Äôi Faith 4 homophobia, frankly, though less than I abhor Islam
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist ‚ÄúVery similar‚Äù	Ok, please explain how it is very similar to Islam specifically (not just to other Abrahamic religions)
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist Not in substance, only in the circumstances of its origins.		The monotheistic core is just as much derived from Islam as it is derived from Judaism and is therefore not specifically derived from Islam.
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist Allah is the same as the Jewish god, silly goose.		And they believe in other people as prophets as well, are you simply being disingenuous?
@Bl3nder_LDG @ParisaMichelle @babylonscared @amazingatheist ‚Äúalso Allah‚Äù	By that ‚Äúlogic‚Äù, Jews are basically Muslims.		The Baha‚Äôi Faith is totally different from Islam, ffs just look at the tenets.
@ParisaMichelle @Bl3nder_LDG @babylonscared @amazingatheist Surely not all monotheistic religions believe in the same god, but Judaism/Christianity/Islam/the Baha‚Äôi Faith do share one, yes.
@Bl3nder_LDG @babylonscared @amazingatheist ...no.	It‚Äôs an Abrahamic religion that stemmed from Islam. It is not Islam lite.

@TheOratoracle @amazingatheist Says anyone who knows anything about the Baha‚Äôi Faith.

The Baha‚Äôi F is very close to being 1
@cabbopearimo @Sam_Ehrenstein @amazingatheist It is except for some things (like being anti-gay, which can cause people harm and therefore isn‚Äôt exactly peaceful).	So, yeah, weird since she labeled herself a Baha‚Äôi activist at least at some point. I doubt religion played a role in this one.
@TheOratoracle @amazingatheist And while the god is the same as the god of Islam, the Baha‚Äôi Faith, while still nasty in many ways (like being anti-gay), promotes peace and unity and blah blah blah		I beg you to find Baha‚Äôi terrorists, lol, you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find any.
@TheOratoracle @amazingatheist No, it‚Äôs more like saying ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt an Orthodox Jew, it was a Methodist Christian‚Äù
@NSakalidis @amazingatheist Depends on one‚Äôs use of the word ‚Äúoffshoot.‚Äù It essentially branched off from Islam and has the same monotheistic Abrahamic god but the beliefs developed in their own hippyish way to the point that it‚Äôs very, very different from Islam.
@amazingatheist And the Baha‚Äôi faith is far more pro-gender equality than Islam, so the instagram pics aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhypocritical‚Äù or anything.	Not that it matters, it‚Äôll be pretty strange if she turns out to not have done it primarily because she hates Youtube https://t.co/VljNdC0kTl

@SirCaspington @sapinker Maybe for calls for ‚Äúassault weapons bans,‚Äù which is extremely complicated, but they‚Äôre not the ones writing legislation. They want legislators to figure that stuff out.

Would u deny that lower ammo capacity cud save lives from a mass shooter?		2 simple things, don‚Äôt need 2 b an expert

@SirCaspington @sapinker ‚ÄúThey have no real knowledge‚Äù	What makes you say that? Have you listened to one word?
@SirCaspington @sapinker False. I support ppl in addressing school safety/gun violence in ways other than gun reform tho I‚Äôm focused on gun reform.

@SirCaspington @sapinker Ok then lol, ty for clarifying
@SirCaspington @sapinker Well, on the ‚Äúconstructive and sensible‚Äù point, changes have already begun to occur and sensible policy points have been advocated for. Not agreeing with everything every one of them says doesn‚Äôt mean you should think they‚Äôre not sensible.
@SirCaspington @sapinker Strange use of the word ‚Äúuse,‚Äù then. Under your definition, if I am retweeted then I am being ‚Äúused?‚Äù
@SirCaspington @sapinker No, I vehemently disagree with other parts of what you said, I merely addressed what I found most egregious. Having the opinion that‚Äôs they‚Äôre not sensible is one thing, suggesting they‚Äôre merely pawns is on a whole other level.

@reagancolbert97 Also, punishing someone for FOREVER is pretty fucking petty (in addition to being cruel beyond words).
@reagancolbert97 I dare you: choose to believe that 2 + 2 = 5. Try it. You can say 2 + 2 = 5 all you like but you can‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to believe it is true.
@reagancolbert97 You didn‚Äôt read what I said.	I don‚Äôt have any choice. I can‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to believe in something. Neither can you. You believe. You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to believe.		You‚Äôre sick if you think torture is ok, let alone ETERNAL TORTURE
@reagancolbert97 Also, men can‚Äôt ‚Äúcome to repentance‚Äù in Hell, so I don‚Äôt see the point in sharing that verse.
@reagancolbert97 Also, you‚Äôre forgetting that I have no ability to choose to believe in and love your god, contradicting everything you say about choice.		I can‚Äôt choose to believe in him, just as I can‚Äôt choose to believe in Zeus.
@reagancolbert97 *for a few days
@reagancolbert97 Oy vey, he died on Earth for a few dies as a sacrifice to mitigate his own rules, what a mensch. /s		And doesn‚Äôt matter if he HAS the power to do it, I have spoken under the assumption that if your god were real then he would.		How he CHOOSES 2 use his power is the disgusting bit
@itatiVCS Congrats!
@reagancolbert97 The Bible does supply any reason from your god for for eternally torturing people.
@reagancolbert97 (Referring to it in another tweet that I thought this was a reply to)
@reagancolbert97 https://t.co/ea8JUegtcZ		I was referring to Luke 12:5
@reagancolbert97 But terrible people don‚Äôt matter, tbh. You sing praise of a being you think would TORTURE me FOREVER simply because I do not believe in him, if for no other reason.		If you don‚Äôt understand how effed up that would be, then you have no humanity and idk what else to say.
@reagancolbert97 Honestly, give me one good reason to torture someone infinitely. I disagree with all torture, but even if you think someone terrible should be, surely, eventually, they should be obliterated? Eternal punishment without the chance for redemption is disgusting beyond belief.
@reagancolbert97 And the Gospels don‚Äôt give reasoning for eternal punishment.		They say to fear your god, is that what you mean?		That‚Äôs a reason to follow his instructions, I guess, but doesn‚Äôt matter for me, as I said, as I‚Äôd hate him, and doesn‚Äôt give reasoning for eternal punishment.
@reagancolbert97 A) your god would not need to separate people from society. He could give everyone an individual afterlife or the shared one, couldn‚Äôt he?		B) your god could simply obliterate people instead of torturing them
@reagancolbert97 If you were in a relationship with a partner you hate and your partner said ‚ÄúLOVE ME OR I BURN YOU,‚Äù you would find yourself unable to do so. You could pretend, of course, but you couldn‚Äôt hide that from your god, could you? ü§î
@reagancolbert97 Lol I have no choice then, b/c if I believed in him then I‚Äôd hate him &amp; I couldn‚Äôt change that. I can‚Äôt choose to feel murder is ok, just as I can‚Äôt choose to feel eternal punishment is ok.		It‚Äôs the most f‚Äôed up thing imaginable. Nobody deserves it, let alone for lack of belief.
@reagancolbert97 Maybe you‚Äôre some hippy dippy Christian who doesn‚Äôt believe in Hell, but I didn‚Äôt exactly get that vibe.
@reagancolbert97 What I said didn‚Äôt concern ‚Äúmaking sense‚Äù except in why you would worship such a deity.		If I believed your god were real, I could not worship him. I can‚Äôt worship a monster, couldn‚Äôt even pretend‚Äîhe‚Äôd know how I feel in my heart.		The basic concept of eternal punishment is evil.
@federalistmemes @KyleKashuv Hilarious.	You‚Äôre an ass.

No, we can‚Äôt stop every shooting. But we sure as hell can make them more difficult and less common.		The shooter has a long history of red flags and owned a damn ‚Äúarsenal‚Äù in his own words.		Why was he never investigated after making threats, as some reports say?
I had a terrifying moment where I thought I may have lost my brother.		While I of course feel relieved he was not physically harmed, the brothers and sisters and daughters and sons of others have been, including someone I know.		Thousands of people may be traumatized as well.

@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Oh wait, I guess I was initially. Sorry, that was unnecessary :P
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Hey, look, some agreement. I'm glad I wasn't too rude to you. Cheers mate. üòâ
@SouljaTroy1996 "Very low" is quite the exaggeration	Meanwhile, in the states, I'm thanking the FSM I'm still on the health insurance of my parents.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker I'm socially libertarian and I generally think markets should be as free as possible while accounting 4 negative externalities, tragedies of the commons, welfare, fraud, etc.		I'm libertarian in the sense of that political compass, but I'm not quite sure how 2 label myself fully.
@SouljaTroy1996 Plus, I think the government should cover healthcare (equality of opportunity) and increasing access to healthy food that counters the loss of happiness from less meat could balance things out somewhat by decreasing healthcare costs.
@SouljaTroy1996 I mean, or just increase access without decreasing subsidies, I just meant that as a realisitic source of funding.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker I don't label myself as one. You assumed that.		I should hope that anyone who wants a free market cares about negative externalities affecting nonhumans, however.
@SouljaTroy1996 Not necessarily
@SouljaTroy1996 ......	-subsidize animal agriculture MORE if major welfare reform was enacted to help price change be more gradual	-etc.
@SouljaTroy1996 I think there are solutions to that.	-increase accessibility of hunting/fishing (yes, ik, not everyone has the time or ability)	-take government money out of subsidizing animal agriculture and put it into increasing access to healthy, enjoyable food for the poor	......
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker (2/2) also "force poor people to have even worse stuff" through government action.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker You do realize I'm economically left, right?	I do think markets should be as free as possible. I think there are many things governments need to make sure are accounted for (welfare, negative externalities, etc.)		I was just pointing out that safety regulations in factories (1/2)
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker I care more about animal suffering than the enjoyment of animal products by people.
@SouljaTroy1996 It would only lower poorer human living standards in that something that provides enjoyment would be less accessible.
@SouljaTroy1996 I think there should be revolutionary change in animal welfare standards (or gradual, though larger changes sooner are preferable). I think it'd be rather unfair to tax meat when I want this.
@SouljaTroy1996 No. I think animal welfare standards should be raised regardless of the economic impact.		It just so happens it'd make animal products more expensive. I don't see a need to tax meat when we can raise welfare standards‚Äîwhich I want anyway.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Wait, so you DO disagree with worker safety protection? ü§î
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Idgaf. Animal welfare shouldn't be sacrificed for cheap animal products just like cheaper factory products shouldn't come at the cost of worker safety.
@SouljaTroy1996 Boo hoo, they don't need it. Do you you think caviar should be affordable for all?
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Poor become poorer? What? You don't need animal products, sillybuns. Rich people often have huge TVs and expensive cars too, deal with it.
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker Good thing you don't need animal products, eh?
@GSpellchecker And/or pay for environmental damage (waste runoff, methane emissions, etc.) (though taxing methane emission could be unfair without addressing other GHGs/methane sources)
@SouljaTroy1996 @GSpellchecker You think animal welfare should be sacrificed for money? You're a terrible person.
@GSpellchecker I think a better thing to do would be to implement stronger and stronger animal welfare standards that make the cost of production go higher and higher :)

@EqualRightsAdvo But yes, for most Americans, it's a matter of personal choice because they do have the means to follow a vegan diet with proper nutrition.
@EqualRightsAdvo Yeah, but then there's the people in the middle of cities without access to fresh vegetables eating cheap meat.	Though, of course, if meat production had to account for negative externalities and avoid all abuse then the anti-capitalist argument would likely weaken.

@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen Were they not forced to cover when not competing? All I saw was they were allowed to compete like that.
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen Sorry for not being clear, I was including marital rape as "beating" (looking back, that was silly of me). I should have said make "all domestic violence illegal," not "make beating of spouses illegal."		Have a good day, best wishes improving the KSA (I assume u live there)
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen I hope it will improve as well. First steps include making the beating of spouses illegal &amp; ending guardianship. I would love 4 the KSA to be a great country. Heck, if it allowed freedom of speech and thought etc., secularized, &amp; became egalitarian by law, it'd be way &gt; USA
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen And besides death, there are the more more prevalent punishments of imprisonment and torture (beating). And yes, I'd call corporal punishment torture anywhere, whether it takes place in the USA or the KSA.		And I haven't even mentioned legal wife-beating and marital rape.
@Sa7awi @SaqibZafarKhan1 @MagnusCarlsen Ahmad Al-Shamri is likely going to be murdered by the KSA. I say "murder" because he did nothing wrong.

@pretendods2 You apparently don't know what "objective" means. If there were an objective definition of "white," then you could tell me if I'm white or not. If I'm supposed to decide for myself, THAT'S SUBJECTIVE
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead *perceived physical characteristics or behavior
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Someone who treats people differently based on perceived "race" or perceived physical characteristics that the person associates with a certain group of people is a racist. People can be racist in different ways because of different definitions.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead You are seriously claiming objectivity when you can't even tell me whether or not I'm "white."
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead YES IT IS	If you cannot say whether or not I am white, IT'S SUBJECTIVE	Also, does preventing "the white race from disappearing" involve "whites" only making babies with other "whites?" Wanting people to do that is racist as fuck.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead I don't see why anyone should give a flying fuck about a social construct "disappearing"
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead It's completely subjective whether or not I'M "white." Some people say I am, some people say I'm not. There's no biological definition.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Ok, fine, I'll potentially strawman you.		Why is it that I'm not "white" as an Ashkenazi Jew if my skin is light?	Why does "black" work in collectively referring to people of Sub-Saharan African groups that have far more genetic diversity than is in Europe?
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead My point relies upon you answering questions so I can point out where you use subjectivity.

@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead https://t.co/GKMHQSW1aG		*sigh* I'll be more accurate:	What is YOUR definition of a race and what is YOUR definition of "white?"
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Are Ashkenazi Jews white? Ethnic Finns? Serbs?
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead Everyone has a different answer, so...
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead If you don't like that question, then what is "the white race?"
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead I'm asking because it's a subjective term.
@pretendods2 @skin_munchkin @shoe0nhead What is a "race?"

@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain (So the covering has everything to do with sex)
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Exactly, but that's the reason in any culture/religion that young children are made to cover up.
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain But it does... the hiding of adornment is not necessary in front of "their women" but males with same treatment are specifically labeled
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain This is the 21st century CE, not the 1st
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain *is rooted in being about sex
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain It's about sex. Not every person's choice to cover up is about sex, but the practice, in any religion or culture, is about sex

@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain The fact that you miss my point is telling. Skin isn't necessarily sexual. Ask any naturist.
@MuslimInterista @theycallmeNunya @affhussain Bikinis aren't necessarily sexual while covering up because of males finding one sexually attractive IS
@theycallmeNunya @MuslimInterista @affhussain Not necessarily the second one. Depends on context.	First one is specifically shielding men from their bodies

@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman So you're saying that Christians and Jews are Muslims?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Are you saying that prior to Mohammed, every Jew was a Muslim?
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman You're free to claim Mohammed is the last prophet, but he founded Islam.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman Islam came after Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, etc.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman I'd love to be convinced of Allah's existence if he exists. Arguments for theism don't cut it though, I'm looking for arguments for Allah.

@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman 2/2 	Then you shouldn't have a problem with his image being known.
@aassmmaa2018 @ashilbran @cjwerleman It's in ahadith, but I see plenty of Islamic scholars explaining it away. Let's roll with that--as it doesn't matter. If Brahma is real, 1/2

@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug ---when praising people who owned slaves/supported slavery instead of praising specific deeds.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug I hate it :P	And don't want anyone to ever forget how terrible it is and that it still exists today.	And to remember how others may feel---
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug On that: no idea :P
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Oh boy. Uh. He was a big-time adulterer. Sorry :P
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug - was to protest civil rights and to intimidate the oppressed in the late 19th/20th century
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug ...having things added to elevate those they oppressed above them. I don't mind removal too much though, as the whole point of most of them-
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug For WM, I think something should be added, like memorial to his slaves.	For confed stuff, I don't want destruction but moved to museums/...
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Plenty of people were abolitionists at the time (besides slaves) https://t.co/UArx7c95pV
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw Concerning the statues/memorials and removing them. Context of Washington Monument and such differ immensely
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw --a real democracy (as you said, it developed over time)
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw For such things, I much prefer to focus on what people did rather than praise people. I get what you mean, but it's not like US started as--
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug ...see it as kinda weak. If someone raided Mt. Vernon and tried to free his slaves, would Washington have defended his property? I think yes
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Yeah, so my point is your first difference doesn't really make sense since he wasn't trying to end slavery :P	The second is better, tho I...
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw Btw, I do think there r diffs, but it's most clear in the context of creation of confed statues/etc: to protest civil rights &amp; 2 intimidate
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw That sounds ruder than I meant it to (tongue-in-cheek), my apologies
@LomahMore @leeshutterbug @tribelaw Yeah I should have been more clear in what I was addressing, originally.

@catspecter I think it best to not leave Native Americans out of the picture.
@catspecter Your analogy is just terrible. I disagree with the point too though. On slavery, they are equatable. And on founding the country...
@catspecter (Washington freeing some after death does not count, btw)
@catspecter Did Washington or Jefferson release their slaves? Y/N	Did Schindler spend his entire fortune on saving Jews? Y/N
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr The "he freed his slaves in his will" thing sounds a lot like you're trying to make his slave-owning sound better...
@catspecter How? What did Schindler do that he disn't counteract? He gave fricken everything. Washington/Jefferson did not.
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr *wouldn't excuse him
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr ...read the website, silly. It says he personally owned 123 slaves. He did not free them before he died. He wrote that into his will
@catspecter Wait a second... LMFAO https://t.co/YHw01KBsJe
@catspecter Wow, nice lack of nuance there. He risked his own ass bribing and lying to Nazis and he spent all his damn money on the people he saved.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw No, you aren't following what I was referring to.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw is a different topic.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw "GW couldn't resolve slavery &amp; also form a country"	I was responding to that. Whether or not the foundation of USA is worthy of celebration‚Äî
@ofctimallen We ARE apes.
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw And slave-owning is a bit of a big fucking deal
@leeshutterbug @LomahMore @tribelaw Unrealistic for what purpose?
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug *might have
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug If he would have, then why didn't he free his slaves?
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug I know, but I wasn't talking about diff b/t W and Lee
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Saying "couldn't resolve slavery" made it sound like you were suggesting that Washington would have ended slavery had he the chance.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug I was pointing out something that had nothing to do with the founding of the country and whether or not it allowed slavery.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug That has nothing to do with Washington.
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug Not an excuse. At all.
@MargaretBenett @tribelaw He was a SLAVE not a 'slave'
@catspecter @tribelaw The context of the confed memorials/statues being erected is diff tho. Was to protest civil rights and intimidate, &amp; Trump misses that.
@catspecter @tribelaw Did Schindler murder Jews, Romani, etc.?		Washington and Jefferson owned slaves. Jefferson was a rapist. Neither deserve honor.
@slidewinding @AltGenWash @tribelaw How sweet /s
@AltGenWash @tribelaw You were a greedy, evil, hypocritical piece of garbage. You were an important historical figure. You were not someone to be venerated.
@Semperfelix @tribelaw None of that excuses him.
@FrankMankiewicz @tribelaw Plenty of people were abolitionist in Washington's time /facepalm
@KateMaguire13 @tribelaw Martha Washington outlived George /facepalm. Many of George's slaves were a part of a dowry 4 marriage to Martha tho
@scottwalkerwtch @tribelaw @MjaneMarshall @realDonaldTrump They would have found it far less racist than themselves.
@AdamT_Brown @tribelaw Great excuse /s
@julianawriter @tribelaw @fleurdeliselle That doesn't excuse Washington. At all.
@mcnitwit @tribelaw Did Arnold own slaves?
@Judith_Hunter @tribelaw Yeah, such a wonderful man, freed slaves when he couldn't gain anything more from them. Praise Washington! /s
@edelman_barbara @tribelaw And then they lived happily ever after /s
@LomahMore @tribelaw @leeshutterbug GW personally owned slaves.
@SusanDeSanti @tribelaw Cuz that totally made everything alright /s
@DiaHuq @tribelaw @drfreedomfightr Bullshit. He personally owned &gt;100 slaves when he died.	Also, even if he had freed all a bit before dying, that doesn't excuse him.
@SheilaABaker @tribelaw He's right for the wrong reasons.
@firstlastsecond @tribelaw Did Arnold own slaves?
@MolecularVision @tribelaw Except that didn't change their private ownership of slaves. Jefferson even raped his.
@GChernack @tribelaw Why should we venerate either?
@SisterChromatid @Nuclear_jelly47 @colin_douglas @Jayareadk44 @gilbertjasono There are many Trump supporters who were swayed by Trump's bs about helping them economically. You were correct in saying "at min complicit"
@MisterGilmore @tribelaw One important diff is a lot of confed statues/memorials/etc. were put up in late 19th/20th century to protest civil rights &amp; intimidate ppl
@MisterGilmore @tribelaw Not to mention that giving patriotism points for founding of USA ignores genocide against Native Americans
@tribelaw @Reid_CO ...add stuff to make the evil clear, like, maybe stick a memorial to Washington's slaves in front of Washington Monument
@tribelaw @Reid_CO something to celebrate. But yes, there is a diff between the two. I don't think we shud honor either tho. Don't need to remove stuff, but...
@tribelaw @Reid_CO Getting down to it though, the colonization of America and founding of USA was built on genocide of Native Americans, not necessarily (1/2)
@SisterChromatid @Nuclear_jelly47 @colin_douglas @Jayareadk44 @gilbertjasono Someone can be a Trump supporter and not racist. Call them complicit as much as you like, but calling them all racist simply isn't true.
@gilbertjasono @deimachy That doesn't make sense if you don't directly quote him	Also, screw Lincoln, he was a racist pos
@sajidjavid Antifa: terrible and disgusting	Neo-Nazis: terrible and disgusting^10

@NAACP I.e. we shouldn't be hero-worshipping Jefferson, a man who owned slaves and raped them. We shouldn't praise w/out remembering the evil
@NAACP Washington and Jefferson were terrible men. They are a part of American history, and people should be well aware of ALL the history
@NAACP Add more to show bad stuff, like, idk, memorial to washington's slaves in front of washington monument
@NAACP There are differences oc but I don't think we should honor them either. Don't need to tear stuff down, but 1/2
