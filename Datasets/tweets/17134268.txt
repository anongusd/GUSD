Jayme Closs was missing for nearly three months after her parents were killed and she was taken from her Wisconsin home in October. The people close to her say they never gave up hope, even if they feared the worst. 		@GayleKing spoke to family friends of Closs: https://t.co/UYlZSl49Ba
"I would be happy to meet with Jayme in person but that being said, if she wants space and doesn't want to to talk to me, that is completely fine. I will never presume to push myself upon anyone." -- Elizabeth Smart https://t.co/27Y1v5EAUY
Smart says small choices is important for Jayme's recovery. 		"When I came home, having the ability to make choices again, even small choices like what cereal I ate for breakfast or what shoes I'm going to wear that day, that was a big deal for me because I was so controlled." https://t.co/0CHHrtM3UB
Few will ever be able to understand what Jayme Closs is going through after her return home from captivity, but someone who can is Elizabeth Smart. 		In 2002 Smart was kidnapped from her home in Utah. She was held captive by a married couple in their home for 9 months. https://t.co/8LPVIS1JUR

Because if we ran into the car, I wanted to have some other plan in my head." -- Nutter https://t.co/PIFo6vD8CG
When Jayme Closs escaped, she had no idea where she was or what was waiting for her outside the home where she was being held in Gordon, Wisconsin. Luckily, she saw former social worker Jeanne Nutter walking her dog.	@GayleKing spoke to Nutter about the moment she found Jayme: https://t.co/SgNJNLUtgq
