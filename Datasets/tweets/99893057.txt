@AbbaSheger I always wonder about you. God knows exactly what you want to see happening in Ethiopia.	May God help you learn to understand  what the meaning of peace is.	As a Naval Officer fought for peace for 24 years and I very well understand what life is without peace.
@sitinanu National reconciliation is the best remedy for the current Ethiopia's predicament.	God bless Ethiopia and her ppl.
@abiyetk Dear A to A bit,	My greetings from Ethiopia.	Thank you for your support of young  interviewers. 	Tesfaye Tadesse	Commander Navy Retired
