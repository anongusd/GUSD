I support the mission of @TIMESUPNOW. I want @TIMESUPNOW to succeed. As a woman, who like so many women has been sexually harassed, I think it‚Äôs critical. I just want people to be thoughtful, held to account, to admit when they messed up and to commit to being better.
So to recap: @TIMESUPNOW/@TIMESUPLDF sent @hilaryr to call me a liar on twitter, deleted or demanded the deletion of tweets that proved my points and still refuses to concede that what happened was wrong. That‚Äôs textbook gaslighting of a woman from a group designed to combat it.
As I‚Äôve said‚Äîboth here and to your comms rep‚ÄîI know #TimesUp as an entity did not endorse. The question is whether its leaders‚Äîeven on their own time‚Äîshould be endorsing candidates who don‚Äôt uphold #TimesUp‚Äôs values, particularly because TU affiliation can and now has been used. https://t.co/CyiOpTRyhY

Revealing that #TimesUp's only response to a woman who shares its goals is personal attacks and technicalities.

IDK why people are not confronting this story. Maybe it's because Michelle Obama is insanely popular. But I'm going to keep tweeting into the wind, largely to my own detriment, because right is right.
This isn't about Toni. This is about a buzzy national group saying it's for empowering women against The Man and whose name is being used to do the exact opposite.

It's disgraceful that this is happening and it's shameful no one cares to ask questions about why. #TimesUp
The message this sends is not a message of hope for women. It's a message that women and their careers are not stronger than the pull of the establishment. And that no one is held accountable in the way @TIMESUPNOW says they should be.
as a woman in Chicago, I dispute this characterization and question why a leader at @TIMESUPNOW is endorsing political candidates at all, let alone a politician who was told her chief of staff sexually assaulted a woman, did nothing for six months and then lied about it. https://t.co/20VM4JkUfh

trust me, I am not afraid to call out media sexism, but not every negative story against a woman is rooted in gender. And I've struggled with the AK stuff, because I was like, if she were a man, would people say this? And I think the answer is yes.
For a non-leadership Senate office, to have high-salaried staff turn over at high rates (even with staffing caveats) is a serious tell because those coveted jobs don't just grow on trees.
For the people attacking @HuffPostPol's reporting on Amy Klobuchar as sexist, consider this: Between 2001 and 2017, she has a LegiStorm staff turnover index of .35, meaning that 35% of her office weighted by salary turns over annually on average.
In the daily morass of D.C., it‚Äòs easy to forget the privilege of being connected to history. Knowing @JohnDingell‚Äîeven tangentially‚Äîwas a privilege of being there. Thanks to @_christopher for the baseball, the photos &amp; helping give Mr. Dingell his distinctive voice on this site.

@DanLamothe I've been a WaPo subscriber for a long time--when I first moved to DC, I got the print edition delivered daily! Which was admittedly too much, given my schedule.
I admit that I am overcoming the idea of letting principle (i.e. what I deem as "good" or "bad" news) get in the way of subscribing. I have a lot of issues with the CST and Trib and how they cover news/allocate resources, but they need $ to make better decisions.
I am now a subscriber to the New York Times, Washington Post and Chicago Sun-Times, and am awaiting the day when the WSJ allows me to subscribe to its sports section.
today (I admit I'm long overdue), I subscribed to the Sun-Times. I want to support local journalism but I *especially* want to support non-chain publications because I worry about VC buying a consolidated chain, raiding its assets (newsrooms) and leaving nothing for communities.

The media covered the brink breathlessly, but once the benefits lapsed and there was no brink, the spotlight, which never focused on policy in the first place, went away. The new world order adjusted to no UI. I worry this is a micro version of what's happening now to government.
So I think about federally enacted longterm unemployment benefits a lot. Congress used to approve as regular course. Between 2009-2014, the fight to extend them became marked by brinkmanship‚Äîuntil benefits lapsed for so long there was no longer pressure for Congress to act.
honestly, indefinitely shuttering a large portion of the government is a natural extension of just never filling agency jobs in the first place.
pro-tip: Congress could take its recess if the House and Senate both passed bills to reopen the government and overrode a potential veto from a president who doesn't appear to know or care what the government does. https://t.co/MKx0FpBe6n

That this anniversary falls during what is proving to be an indefinite government shutdown makes me think about the language we use to describe government, what the media allows to reach Americans and how we should all strive to do better. (4/4)

In that way, Tucson is not unlike any other U.S. community ravaged by this man-made crisis. But I think about that time often, of Gabby Giffords and the promise of her life and career, of her slain staffers and constituents, how this shooting was an assault on our republic (2/4)

which, of course, is not to take away from the excellent reporting by @christinawilkie, but it's good for government accountability when there are reporters whose jobs are to view Congress through the lens of a delegation (see great reporters for SC, GA, NV, CA, NY, NJ, PA, MA)

I am very confused that in all the tweets about the rules package no one is talking about what a HUGE DEAL approving automatic debt limit extensions would be, especially as we are in the middle of an indefinite, irresponsible shutdown.

@_Michaelinho I think players are likely more open-minded than fans and old-white-dude media, especially when it comes to local sports media. My real fear is if she were ever to get the call, it'd be a "glass cliff" situation with a garbage team and then used against all women forever.
this felt like a very superficial look at a deep figure, and I hate the framing that Reid changed Senate rules. McConnell forced his hand and ultimately would have blown them up. Alternative is Trump filling all those vacancies Obama was entitled to fill. https://t.co/kd6AaTNNxS
lol #congrats to RB for getting into that sweet, sweet shutdown coverage and of course to @DSPollock for being sort-of married! https://t.co/IOJUnqdais
@_Michaelinho I say this as a person who believes Becky Hammon only gets a head coaching job (which she deserves a chance at) if Pop retires and basically wills his job to her.
@_Michaelinho lastly, if the NBA really believes it's "committed to providing robust career development opportunities to both current and former players," then maybe they avoid the issue by creating a league-wide professional development fund so the league pays the salary v. the co-owned teams
@_Michaelinho I think it's more than girls loving basketball, it's also men accepting they can watch women's basketball and enjoy it. Like, the women's Final 4 last year was *so* much better than the men's, but I don't think you'll find a lot of men who will say that (diff than pros, I know)
@_Michaelinho this is basically just an improvement on the idea of how we currently compensate men's college basketball players so maybe let's let the "market" "work"

Anyway lots of bad for government things are happening but your regular reminder that this isn‚Äôt some cute game. The gamification of appropriations post-Gingrich and especially since 2011 has been extremely damaging.
I always think of all the real people (beyond the lawmakers they do this to themselves)‚Äîstaff, Cap police, maintenance, food service workers‚Äîwho have to go through this repeatedly because of some misguided notion all members will do the right thing because they want to get home.
Because keeping the lights on is the bare minimum! And Congress loves to do this thing where holidays are ‚Äúpressure points‚Äù for action. Holiday travel is expensive and also holidays are nice things to celebrate with family but here we are repeatedly. It sucks for everyone.
So I have a few canned lines for when I‚Äôm asked why I left my old life in DC. One of them is: ‚ÄúI got sick of old, incompetent white men dictating my holiday schedule because they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to fund the government or lift the debt ceiling.‚Äù

The entire game is being played and won by republicans at the state-level because they recognized reshaping the field and changing the rules entrenches power. It became an even stronger play when local media began dying and political media consolidated in DC/NY.
Peaceful, fair transition of power was once the hallmark of American democracy. Wisconsin isn‚Äôt the first state to try this in lame duck, won‚Äôt be the last, and honestly the coverage is not commensurate to the gravity of the situation. GOP has transformed politics at state-level. https://t.co/BWM7ptCmuY
I don‚Äôt trust that the right things will be said or done, but it should be easy to do the absolute bare minimum to protect the basic tenants of democracy, that when citizens cast votes and choose their new government, the outgoing government recognizes and accepts their choices.
Three years ago, national reporters were quick to paint a narrative of a ‚ÄúWisconsin takeover‚Äù of the GOP, with Walker running for POTUS, Priebus running the RNC and Ryan becoming speaker. So they shouldn‚Äôt pretend like Ryan as speaker should not address what‚Äôs happening in WI.
Every question Speaker Paul Ryan gets before he leaves Congress should be whether he supports the GOP‚Äôs bad faith undermining of democracy in his home state. https://t.co/0qCuJVmKw2

I sat in the same row of chairs we‚Äôve sat in our entire lives, where my aunt‚Äôs father and uncle, both Holocaust survivors, would come to represent the relatives they lost. The past is not so distant and we should all have to sit with the very real present we are allowing.
Martyrology is a Yom Kippur service where we vow to always remember those murdered because they were Jews. Today at our Chicago suburban temple, our rabbi had a congregant read aloud an anti-Semitic, Holocaust-denying screed by current GOP congressional candidate Art Jones.

It‚Äôs the most memorable and perhaps important floor speech that was given in my time in DC that possibly no one remembers. It‚Äôs also sad to think about all the lows the Senate has seen since Harkin called it a 30-year low in his Senate career.
When the Senate blocked in 2014 Debo Adegbile‚Äôs nomination to lead the Civil Rights Division at DOJ, Tom Harkin laid out a passionate, convincing case that there‚Äôs a clear benefit of doubt given to white male judicial nominees that doesn‚Äôt exist for others https://t.co/6dNYdGr0dm

@carronJphillips I get the Grantland comparison, but I also feel like ESPNW might be the more instructive analog, in that ESPN never gave ESPNW commentary prominent play, it was siloed on its own hub. This was always my fear for The Undefeated and I think it's mostly proven true.

I guess it‚Äôs also worth remembering that the thing said on the Senate floor that was ‚Äúnot intended to be a factual statement‚Äù was Kyl‚Äôs claim that 90% of Planned Parenthood services are abortions. So that‚Äôs your update on Roe v. Wade‚Äôs future post-Kavanaugh‚Äôs confirmation.
‚ÄúNot intended to be a factual statement‚Äù was the o.g. ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù so in that sense Jon Kyl was really a tastemaker.

also Durbin‚Äôs articulation that Kavanaugh needs to demonstrate the characteristics of the retiring justice he is replacing is a hazardous line to draw, given that it was the exact reasoning of GOP not wanting to give Garland a hearing to fill the seat vacated by Scalia

Additionally CNN seems to be completely unaware that Dan Inouye had the honor of lying in state in the Capitol rotunda in 2012.
Still trying to get over the fact that CNN said Bill Clinton‚Äôs character concerns prevent him from speaking at a funeral where Henry Kissinger will deliver remarks.
@nc879 I can‚Äôt tell you that
Also side note on McCain-Feingold, which would have been his most significant legacy: everything Mitch McConnell ever did was designed to destroy it because McConnell‚Äôs view was diametrically opposed to McCain in that he believes in unlimited opaque political money.
But in a world now where so many policymakers are not good faith actors, where more is being torn down than is being built up, what might anyone‚Äôs tangible legacy be? McCain‚Äôs story and character can endure but what does that mean in the context of history?
The trajectory of the GOP and where McCain ends up relative to where the party lands could factor into ‚Äúlegacy.‚Äù His worldview on foreign policy was hawkish but at least he had a worldview, which is more than what current Congressional Republicans can say for themselves.
The ‚Äúno‚Äù vote on repeal and replace for health care could potentially be a piece, but there‚Äôs no telling what Republicans‚Äîwhose motives throughout repeal debate have been purely political‚Äîwill do in the years ahead (probably continue to weaken the ACA).
CNN asks ‚Äúwhat is John McCain‚Äôs legacy?‚Äù and it‚Äôs a complicated question. America today would no doubt be different if SCOTUS had not invalidated the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. Same if House had taken up the Senate-passed 2013 immigration bill. But those are not real.

Politics as service is something I think about a lot because over the past decade we took for granted that people would run for office because they held fundamental beliefs about the country and what our government can do (even if we disagree). That time feels lost esp for GOP.
John McCain was not perfect, but he was fierce, authentic, infamously cantankerous when you asked him a question he didn‚Äôt like, and above all, a person who genuinely believed in politics as service. It‚Äôs hard to imagine the Senate without him.

In other words, the White House is using the animosity they've created about CNN to justify cutting off all TV reporters' access to an event with the president. That is bad.
"Pool" is jargon. We should explain what it means so people can understand the seriousness of this. Because not every reporter can travel with POTUS, all the outlets pool together and take turns daily covering POTUS. To ban the pool is to leave all those outlets in the dark.
honestly what everyone needs to know here is that it is *much more* significant that the reporter banned was pool for the day--meaning the eyes and ears for every credentialed TV reporter--than that the reporter is from CNN. Barring the pool reporter is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/8lvuyQDfQk

I know you can get shot doing pretty much anything in this country, but I think the reason this Annapolis news is so distressing is because I got to a point in political journalism where I didn‚Äôt love it enough to die for it and I thought that was within the realm of possibility.
I don't understand how people, especially Republicans in Congress, some who have survived a mass shooting, can see the news of shooting after shooting and not feel the profound empathy and fear of "that could be my child, parent, partner, friend, neighbor, colleague, teacher..."
the most depressing thing about this time is the complete lack of recognition of the value of so many diverse lives. what are we doing?
none of this shit is actually a game. real people with real lives and real families and real friends continue to die needlessly. for doing their jobs. for going to school. for going to movies. for going to church. for going to concerts. but keep up your media is the enemy tweets.

This is a fair take for sure but let‚Äôs also not forget that in 2015 Boehner had to beg Ryan to run for speaker because McCarthy saw what the HFC was demanding in terms of changes to steering and said j/k I don‚Äôt want to steer this titanic https://t.co/kPSvi0jQK6

I guess the point I wish I had made last night is also that it's a pretty big sign of the Democratic party's lack of leadership at a critical time that open letters about the party's tone in an election season published in the NYT are being addressed to Sam Bee and Robert De Niro
@maggieNYT Your og tweet was of a column and I disagreed with the cited take? I‚Äôm not arguing that journalists should be of an opposition party. I just think the long-term ramifications in re: policy and governing are greater for current immigration and judicial changes than ‚Äúname-calling.‚Äù

@DSPollock @jzembik I'm torn on this ruling. Caps and Rangers are in the same division but I also believe that you should be able to choose one team and one team only when you live in a place for a long time as long as that team is in a sport you really love. #mistrial

Sending children to school or to the movies or to church and having them return home to you, as a parent in this country, shouldn't be a privilege. It should be a right. No matter where you live or what you look like. I believe this more than anything and am always disappointed.

Lastly, the community on campus that reads college paper columns or can recognize a columnist is about proportionally the same as people nationally being able to recognize/name a WH staffer‚Äîminuscule. The only campus celebrity walking around like JJ Redick was JJ Redick.
It doesn‚Äôt take months or 3000 words or deep analysis to understand why a person would deliberately want no friends. Having friends in college or in life would have completely disproved a faulty thesis that being a conservative alone makes one a pariah.
Which is all to say, being a conservative college newspaper columnist isn‚Äôt revolutionary or radical. It‚Äôs pretty standard. No one was ‚Äútormented.‚Äù This guy just benefited from the luck of a once-in-a-lifetime media maelstrom and a shift in the GOP.
Since then, the university very publicly caved to Franklin Graham, acquiescing to his demand Duke not hold a call to prayer at its chapel. Just a few weeks ago, a coffee shop moved off campus because an employee was playing rap to the chagrin of an administrator.
Because it‚Äôs being discussed, a note on Duke as liberal utopia. In my time there from 05-09, Duke hosted Karl Rove &amp; Colin Powell. Kappa Alpha hung a giant ‚ÄúKA ‚ù§Ô∏ès McCain‚Äù banner in the quad (despite Kay Hagan‚Äôs son being a member/08 grad), gay students often lived closeted.

@Traugatron True story‚ÄîI used to have a blue checkmark here. Because of that people felt liberty to tell me I should die or be killed. Wikileaks threatened to publish addresses of check-marked people. I unchecked because that scared me. Doxxing is designed to make targets fear for safety.
@Traugatron I was not particularly enlightened by either story. It was probably gratuitous to name him, as the point was made that he is easily googleable anyway but I also am 100% not OK with PFT saying he was ‚Äúdoxxed.‚Äù
But I cannot remember another instance (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong), where a high-profile publication like the Post granted blanket anonymity to a featured subject just because it was his preference not to be named.
Because also one day a drunk girl in a Barstool video might die or some drunk dude who tries to recreate one of those horrible fail videos might die, and then the market value of the leading talent in a risk-averse corporate world might drop precipitously.
Because one day the PMT guys will try to improve their lot, whether by striking out on their own or latching onto a bigger media company and the more they fight now to say they are ‚Äúnot that Barstool,‚Äù the more they can hope it won‚Äôt affect their future value (/sponsorship).
The Barstool piece is easy to answer. Barstool built its brand on misogyny. The PMT guys try to divorce themselves from that brand because they believe it‚Äôs in their financial interest but they can‚Äôt divorce themselves from the brand because they are the face of the brand.
Honestly from a Barstool perspective, Barstool is Barstool. My biggest question would be for a Washington Post public editor, if there were one: what is the possible justification to granting the subject of that profile anonymity? Access is not a good enough answer.
I would like to go on a podcast to share my #takes on Barstool because every time there‚Äôs a Barstool newscycle I have a lot of them.

@badler I don't disagree that society sucks for women, I just think the people curating the lists could be more intentional about trying to make them more diverse because it becomes an unbreakable cycle, as the people on those lists then use their placement to get a leg up for next thing
@badler @Beyerstein @rollcall (like, I think we should be more honest about those lists serving as beat-sweeteners. they shouldn't have to, but they do, and our editors at the time made their decisions accordingly)
@badler @Beyerstein üëã from someone who worked at @RollCall and always was frustrated during ‚ÄúFabulous 50‚Äù staffers selection and expressed desire for more women‚ÄîI found it wasn‚Äôt that there weren‚Äôt women to pick but that pickers‚Äô knowledge skewed press-friendly/out there and those people are men.

Also also sorry I numbered that first tweet it turns out I had more thoughts than what could fit in that space.
But also was there a single woman at SI who read that story before it published because the ‚Äúmaybe @brendatracy24 should stop trying‚Äù line was breathtakingly bad.
If you read that story and believe the juvenile felony offense for a white star baseball player prospect should be sealed as an adult, you can‚Äôt oppose a seal for a young person of color who shoplifts a candy bar, who won‚Äôt get an SI cover story to redeem him in his college app.
We have a myth of a sealed juvenile record, as young people of color even just charged with minor offenses as juveniles have juvenile records used against them in college &amp; job applications. Which is why automatic expungement laws‚Äîlike the one just passed in IL‚Äîare imperative.
So I finally read the Heimlich SI piece and it‚Äôs problematic for all the reasons people have said, but it also authoritatively presents a totally naive view of the reality of juvenile justice in America. (1/2) https://t.co/YsMrDy5kpV

Anyway, point being , if you want to eliminate a public editor because you don't want to pay for it or hold up a mirror to yourself, fine. But don't claim that randoms on Twitter do the same job. Because as you can see, the ombudsman SYNTHESIZED those concerns into a point.
"Several incidents over the past few weeks suggest that ESPN is exposing itself to an unnecessary amount of public embarrassment and internal dissension by its lack of an official guidebook to ESPN's values, standards and practices." https://t.co/gA7vo9R605
"At ESPN, conflict of interest is business as usual." https://t.co/09pukHZuED
Like it‚Äôs amazing that ESPN could have republished this 2008 Schreiber column in 2018 and it still would have been the smartest @jemelehill take. https://t.co/g2Ln2McUxa https://t.co/u1a1NKIdpp
From that 2008 column:  "I read message after message from angry readers demanding that https://t.co/ClwVnuqh4l Page 2 columnist Jemele Hill be fired for her March column suggesting NBA superstar LeBron 'King' James should be more careful with his image."
or "ESPN is right to engage, not avoid, racial matters in sports" https://t.co/g2Ln2McUxa
"My concern...is... for viewers and readers who grow fat on the fast food of opinion while starving for reported fact." https://t.co/mBQUOL7Ow1
Le Anne Schreiber was so good and so smart about media that most of her writing on ESPN from a decade ago ended up presaging what we see from political media now.
The blurry line between ESPN as a business enterprise and ESPN as a news organization makes the ombudsman/public editor role vital. Trashing it because "twitterers are critics, too" is just another step in undermining the value of professional journalists &amp; media criticism.
I missed this yesterday, but let me say: even though the trend is to eliminate public editors THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. It's sad to see ESPN do this because Le Ann Schreiber was the gold standard and the smartest person on journalism I ever read. https://t.co/BJtOnLSRZB

(also this particular anecdote is a tame one from the library but I think rather illustrative about how young women can be treated dismissively and attacked personally because of perceived lady-like insecurities instead of treated professionally)
I think more women should talk about the subtle ways in which sexism has affected their careers and lives so other women know it's OK to be upset about things that fall short of physical harm and that they are not alone.
which he did, of course, so he could give the story he wouldn't confirm to me to a male reporter he thought would frame it more favorably. Anyway, being a young lady in DC is not easy, and we should recognize that!
for example, it's fun to see a Dem aide "stand" with the women of CAP knowing he once belittled and humiliated me in a room full of people, repeatedly telling me I didn't understand my job and would ruin my reputation if I reported a story he knew the whole time was 100% true.
re: the CAP story it's well past time that Democratic male staffers grapple with the fact that "I can't be a misogynist because I support Planned Parenthood" isn't real, and that those who are guilty of that thinking should consider how they use it as cover to treat women worse.
