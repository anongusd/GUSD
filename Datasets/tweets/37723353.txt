@dylanmatt @MattZeitlin ya, my thing about the castle meme, compared to the (perfect) chopper meme, is the former visualizes the complicated personal feeling of retrenching in the face of rhetorical attack while the latter is just a great way of _popularizing_ the terms of an interesting debate

@ibidibid @TheStalwart i'm happy to accept an alternate explanation, but i think mine is right! https://t.co/maWN32GcaO
@GabrielRossman @TheStalwart i actually didnt know that!
@VegaVandal @TheStalwart it's definitely too complex to catch on widely		but having spent the last 24 hours in the actual position of defending a trolly provocation, it was the right time to use the bad meme
@TheStalwart but my understand of it is: "provocation vs. position you retreat to after the provocation is questioned"		e.g.: Eat bacon and steak and fatty yogurt every day! -&gt; Fat, having been demonized by the sugar lobby, is delicious and healthy and we should all eat more of it guilt-free
@TheStalwart tbqh i dont know that i get it either

@ritholtz havent had pb&amp;j in years		i basically eat the same omelette or salad every workday for lunch. and my breakfasts are similarly routinized. then i go out to dinner all the time and try to eat a bunch of new weird things		weekday lunch heterogeneity just isnt that important to me
@AliceFromQueens hahaha. impeccable rewrite. unfortunately I truly have no idea!
@AliceFromQueens Serious q: what does neoliberalism have to do w this
@mediadissector @kurtsoller Bc I like the salad! I’m just not craving much in the way of novelty for weekday lunches
@kurtsoller @jbarro Started when I was writing my book, so 4 years ago. 		I cycle thru similar breakfasts for months, and then switch for another few months. A lot of responses indicated that was a common interpretation of the tweet (as opposed to eating the same oatmeal for 10,000 consecutive days)
@kurtsoller Oatmeal — and yeah the veggies are pretty similar day to day
@kurtsoller When I’m working from home, it’s a similar veggie omelet. At work, 90% of the time I get the same small salad
@MarkHarrisNYC That is a fair and generous response. 		In this case, our differences, however fundamental and deep on a philosophical basis, concern the taste-diversity of just five meals a week.

@MarkHarrisNYC haha. maybe you can persuade me about the joys of mixing it up for weekday breakfasts?		Culinary variety is great. I just concentrate it in dinners (and weekends).
@LucasPattan @faris I do. It’s just the same good food.
@faris i do believe that some ppl get more or less joy from food		but to be clear i get IMMENSE joy from great food.		i just dont crave diversity in my weekday breakfasts and lunches. i want to focus on food that's really great, and i do that w/ dinners

@jasongay a fair hit! 		otoh, "when you spend a lot of time inside, the outside is more exciting" isn't really a diss. it's more like a description of approximately every white collar worker in the world
@steventurous if you enjoy maximizing for novelty in all 1,095 meals per year, then i tip my hat to you sir!		i'm not arguing for culinary monotony. i'm saying "it's ok to make special meals more special by just not thinking about ~60% of your meals"
@annehelen amen. cliff bars, the official meal of reporting trips
@mpolikoff gotcha (wasnt trying to snippy just typing quickly)		another factor here is i live in a manhattan apt so my pantry space is fit for thumbelina
@erniebufflo bingo
@mpolikoff assuming 3 square meals a day, there are 1,000+ meals per year. i get more pleasure out of food when i can enjoy it fully and freshly, without guilt or diminishment. routinizing 2 simple/cheap meals a day and making dinner the place for culinary extravagance is one way to do it
@DanyEatsWorld i have a lot of variety in my diet, it's just all funneled into the dinner slot
@annehelen yep. 		i cycle through routines — the egg and cheese thing; the yogurt and nuts thing; the banana and peanut butter stint — but each cycle lasts for weeks and sometimes longer		and what *exactly* is the alternative? i live in an apartment, not a diner
This is brilliant.		I don't understand people who DON'T eat the same meal every day, esp breakfast and lunch. 		a) it makes it easier to scale grocery shopping	b) it's psychologically &amp; economically efficient	c) it makes special meals even more special		https://t.co/D7U8diPeBL

@lymanstoneky many thanks, 6th seed!		(from now on i've decided that identity flows, not thru work, but thru @ne0liberal bracket positioning)
@sivavaid @JonMalesic Yep, the piece was getting long but i would have loved to include more about how the prosperity gospel morphed into/still feeds the american dream
@sivavaid @JonMalesic If you're arguing that americans are less likely to be involved in traditional religions, but that they remain spiritually connected to ersatz/non-traditional/secular "faiths" that's an argument firmly in keeping with the thesis of the piece!
@sivavaid @JonMalesic "This overall drop in religiosity has been driven by the rapid growth of the religiously unaffiliated population (from 16% of all U.S. adults in 2007 to 23% in 2014) – along with the fact that these religious “nones” are becoming even more secular over time."
@sivavaid @JonMalesic Good q. But it's a complicated issue. I think you might be overlooking the fact that the American middle class works fewer hours than it used to.
@sivavaid @JonMalesic the following things seem possible	1. callings are rooted in a very americany protestantism 	2. but it's today's secular elite who are particularly focused on careers/work	3. religious immigrants work hard for a variety of non-"workist" reasons	4. but their kids are more secular

7/ Let's make work less terrible. But also, perhaps, let's make work less CENTRAL. 		Here’s the piece, again. Thanks to those who have wrestled with many of these ideas in the last few weeks, including @annehelen @BigMeanInternet @oren_cass @eringriffith 		https://t.co/VAfrmFWpJx
6/ According to the site 80000 Hours, #followyourpassion is the "defining piece of career advice" today.		But 87% of ppl say they aren’t engaged at their jobs. 		What if imbuing work with religious power is actually a blueprint for misery, anxiety, and burnout?
5/ Some fair Qs: Isn’t work necessary? (Yes.) Doesn’t research show idleness/unemployment are socially corrosive? (Yes.) Isn’t loving your job great? (If you do, it is.)		My Q in response is: Is it wise to make the centrality of work the defining feature of secular modern life?
4/ But it’s not just rich men. 		The U.S. is becoming a holy workist empire. Today’s teens value a “job with meaning” over having a family or being helpful.		Work has also become more central to policy: In the last 30 years, welfare has become ever-more tied to the labor force. https://t.co/tzgJf2kLAZ
3/ Workism is a modern cult.		For most of history, ppl worked less as they got richer.		But starting in the 1980s, rich Americans (esp men) started working more than any other group. These rich guys could have bought anything with their wealth. They chose to buy…more work. https://t.co/ExTbZImBJj
2/ Happiness is, the cliche goes, expectations minus reality.		Expectations of jobs and careers—raised by self-help books, graduation speeches, parents, and even media—have soared for many to a level of unreality.		So, when did this start?
1/ Seeking meaning from what you do all day is natural, even reasonable. 		But there’s a problem: Our desks are not designed to be our altars. The jobs provided by a modern capitalist economy are not fit to shoulder the burdens of quasi-spiritual expectations of work.
I wrote a long essay about what I call the American religion of work.		In short: In a period of declining religiosity, more Americans turn to work for the things they once sought from traditional religions—community, meaning, and transcendence.		https://t.co/VAfrmFWpJx

@JHWeissmann @hblodget thats more or less where i am		my "calling the shot while the ball's in the air" position that this is a risk worth taking, for its potential to even shift a national conversation about big rich cities heavily subsidizing corporate expansion
@hblodget That's fair! 		My feeling is, they got 5k employees here, their ad business is growing rapidly, and Crystal City can only absorb so many new FTEs. I think Amazon's growth will *still* be a big net positive for the city, and the jobs they create here will "cost" NYC less.
@hblodget I'm distinguishing between the motivations and the outcome.		Local opposition to HQ2 was driven by anti-gentrification/quasi-socialist motivations, about which I'm dubious.		But the outcome is fine. NYC really shouldn't be in the business of massive corporate subsidies.

@HuftJonathan @ne0liberal not to alert the horsemen of the apocalypse, but i think two ppl on twitter just resolved a political-media misunderstanding and came to an agreement
@ne0liberal @HuftJonathan I hear ya.		Not that ur doing this, but the "crazy like a fox" interpretation of PETA's memetic gamesmanship treats it like an ad-supported media company. but it's a social movement. its success is determined, not just by attn, but by conversation of attn -&gt; behavior change
@HuftJonathan @ne0liberal I think I need to see more evidence that PETA’s savvy and cynical media strategy is actually paying off in some observable way. Absurdity is a great attention stimulant, yes, but a moral movement can’t live on ratio’d self owns forever
@ne0liberal that said, i think it's interesting—even gurri-esque, if i may—to ask how social movements/policy entrepreneurs should weigh media impressions vs. "real world" behavior changes in quantifying their total influence
@ne0liberal "our social structures amplify questionable tactics and outrage" hard agree!		but americans eat more meat today than they did 40 years ago (or 10). to the extent that PETA is interested in physical-world results above media-world notoriety, it's been a failure on this count
@UncleDiaz strong disagree. they're not nihilists, they just bad at their job
1. Animals are adorable and lovable. 		2. The popularity of eating them without hesitation is a compelling moral quandary. 		3. Twitter is a fertile landscape for progressive campaigns of moral outrage.		And yet PETA finds a way to misplay this hand every damn month. https://t.co/GjNPusZLIf
The big, unanswered, and for now unanswerable question in Gurri's work is: 		Is the social-media inflamed rebellion against the political establishment/global capitalism mere turbulence or a revolution?		In other words: Is it 1848, or 1789?

@SamLeverenz @antoniogm Ironically textbooks have had MASSIVE inflation (for reasons that are only partially explained by the cost disease)
@antoniogm @benfritz I think of it this way; multinationals have gotten really good at automating and offshoring anything that can be “traded” along a global supply chain, leaving a lot of discretionary spending chasing nontradable services—ed/med/beds (hospitality)—where prices rise
@antoniogm @benfritz Labor is downstream from policy and consumer choices (as AGM suggested above) but it’s a huge factor: “97.7 percent of incremental employment between 1990 and 2008 stems from the nontradable sector” ie health, education, govt, and elderly care https://t.co/UvUSpHj73d
@antoniogm The strongest “it’s not as bad as it seems” arg I heard is if you have rising overall growth plus marked deflation in some categories, then some sectors simply have to inflate 		But that’s not a defense of US health policy which suffers all the problems you identified

3. States can't print money like DC, so they are rewarding these companies with billions of scarce dollars—via abatements, loans, and even grants—that aren't going to other municipal projects.		Corporate subsidies are the financial illiteracy epidemic that matters.
2. Cities and states are collectively spending $90 billion a year, either to drag jobs and factories from one zip code to another, or to pay companies to make business decisions that were nearly inevitable. 		That sucks. It's really dumb.		https://t.co/iOKJnfwBVm

@katjabego @Noahpinion i think that's exactly right
5) Beyond the global design firms/retailers, there are shared aesthetic "assumptions" about how certain places should look, which might be social-media inflected.		Like nowhere is it written that every coffee shop should have exposed brick and Edison light bulbs, but here we are.
3) More (business-)travel! The "SoHo House aesthetic" is everywhere, as cities compete for/cater to a global cosmopolitan class whose zipcode is the Delta Sky Lounge		4) Per @mattyglesias, industrial mix in major global cities is more similar than it used to be.
To start a brief list: 		1) Globalization, particularly the global reach of retailer and architecture firms, means you have streets in BA, Stockholm, NYC literally designed by the same firms, populated by the same franchises.		2) Internet -&gt; trends travels further/faster
I think this is right, and I would love to know why. 		It’s not just US cities that look the same. Lots of non-American cities—especially their commercial districts—look like they imported their retail-level aesthetic from the same factory. https://t.co/P8f5UX6Qos
@mattyglesias @conorsen sure but subway was founded back when CT campuses *were* a status symbol! 		A lot of the new bougie brands whose aesthetic has come to dominate urban street level retail like sweetgreen and soul cycle tend to be hq’d in cal/nyc (sweetgreen founded in dc but moved)
@conorsen @mattyglesias Indeed. one thing that could  explain both centralization of status and decentralizational of aesthetic is the growth of national chains, which tend to HQ’d in a handful of cities while their franchises are everywhere, making so many city blocks interchangeable

@paulg @adam_tooze @NickSzabo4 @tylercowen @ATabarrok The former. 		Automation is further along in manufacturing than professional services or hospitality		manufacturing employment has nosedived in the last few recessions, for both demand reasons (fewer cars bought) and supply (employers shifting production toward labor saving tech)
@deep_beige okay! I agree with everything you said up to the first comma, and am undecided or unconvinced about everything you said after it
@paulg @adam_tooze @NickSzabo4 @tylercowen @ATabarrok Ah that part of the graph. 		My guess is manufacturers employing labor saving technology and other measures during the recession to maintain margins.
@deep_beige I happen to think companies can innovate productively and extend the scientific breakthroughs of govt for commercial use. Maybe we disagree about that!		But if the question is where do those breakthroughs come from, I say: govt funded research, almost always.
@deep_beige I’ve never made that argument, and I don’t believe it. 		The article in question is about how a leftist intervention in American politics is the only appropriate response to the stagnation and anguish unleashed by Davosesque global capitalism.
@paulg @adam_tooze @NickSzabo4 @tylercowen @ATabarrok I believe Michael Spence had a paper around 2008 showing that 90% of job creation since 1990 was in non-tradables bc of global supply chains/tech 		Makes sense then that services would continue to dominate job growth
@deep_beige “... with the products of federally funded research”!!		And the link leads to an article on how federal research planted the seeds of the communication tech revolution		A good clean hit on my ostensible age, I guess, but you’ve dunked on my argument by reiterating its premise.
@F_duction @max_read @dennismeaney91 @LPDonovan The idea that ARPAnet was 95% of the modern Internet is laughable
@max_read @dennismeaney91 @LPDonovan ha well the actual hot take from my google x profile is that the history of US tech production and Bell Labs suggests that govt sanctioned monopolies have a positive externality: we can dragoon them into massive R&amp;D spending
@max_read @dennismeaney91 @LPDonovan Now part of this is by design. Bell Labs was barred from commercializing some of its innovations so TI was the first to turn the transistor into a product (radio)

3/ Nike and Gillette aren't leaning into woke capitalism because corporate America grew a conscience. 		They're recognizing that corporate activism can both signal virtues to consumers/employees and create debates that amplify that advertising. 		Controversy is a currency. https://t.co/jlGWRKEmgV

"If women, minorities, and children from low-income families were to invent at the same rate as white men from high-income families, the rate of innovation in America would quadruple." 		https://t.co/pQg12ACmW2 https://t.co/5BbY3UYbG6
@MrRBourne @Brian_Riedl it's possible that our lower marginal tax rates play a role in the latter. but i find this unlikely given that post-tax discretionary income for high earners in the bay area really isnt THAT much lower than some european countries
@MrRBourne @Brian_Riedl it's a good point. 		i think it is simultaneously possible to argue that other countries have a broader startup base but the US—bc of variety of econ policies/cultural diffs/historical elements—is better at scaling up firms from small to medium to intl corps
@Brian_Riedl i was a little purposefully slippery on exactly how i'd like to raise revenue, or finance these programs, since i'd like a variety of sources incl carbon		i agree with the point you've made that the 70% rate at 10m would raise little income

@KevinMKruse or like breaking into a CMS to edit your horoscope
@AleResnik but pls note that this is totally different from saying that inherent founder *ability* is concentrated among the affluent native-born—that is a sentiment which i am rather horrified to be attached to!!
@AleResnik i know a lot of entrepreneurs and for me, it's obviously (b)		perhaps you disagree, altho i'd be surprised, 		particularly since the data shows the POOL of ppl who go into self-employment is skewed toward the rich, who, in seeking funding, benefit from parents/rich prof networks
@AleResnik let's discount immigrants, who obviously account for a lot of entrepreneurial activity (and i strongly support higher imm levels)		is it your belief that native-born, high-growth founders represent a cross-section of the US pop, or do you think that they are richer than avg?
@AleResnik Ale, I do not want to fight on this thing, but if you read my article and believe that it argues that rich people are smarter and more capable founders than poor people,  you are insulting your own intelligence
@AleResnik @KyleTibbitts @paulg ok, for the last time, before i mute this damn thread:		i never said that rich ppl were better founders. i don't think it. and i never said it.		read the article. i said entrepreneurial opportunities are disproportionately concentrated among the high income, which is OBVIOUS.
@davidlsims @alexwagner what about the neftlix one?
@paulg point taken! 		i haven't changed my mind abt macro forces shaping supply of founders, but it's possible that the data i'm looking at about the demographics of entrepreneurship supply isnt as relevant to the factors that determine high-growth founder success.		thx for the feedback
@paulg i dont think private school attendance is the best proxy		i would guess conservatively that of native-born founders of the top 50 most valuable startups, the proportion whose families were on medicaid is below the national average and the % in the top earnings quintile is above
@paulg what the data clearly shows me, which i want to emphasize, is that entrepreneurship remains a disproportionately affluent game, even if there are aspects of high-end founder performance that are decoupled from family wealth
@paulg if your argument is "conditional on their acceptance to YC, or passing a similar threshold of access to VC counsel/attn, i don't think family wealth produces any observable founder advantage" i cannot argue with you! you are a world expert on that specific topic.		but ...
@paulg i think you're separating the total supply of new firms from the results of high-returning firms as if there unrelated. but that's like saying at-bats are irrelevant to home run totals
@esoltas @hamandcheese interesting, say more about what counts here as "pro-growth/efficiency" that doesn't fall under spending

@hamandcheese i think that's a great summary
Can't emphasize this enough: 		1. High-growth entrepreneurship today is concentrated among the rich.		2. Democratizing opportunity requires more universal services and redistributed income security.		3. This will almost certainly require higher taxes.   https://t.co/PvOzcazCHQ https://t.co/s4UlofnP1S

@Sam_Dumitriu thanks for clarifying. I don't disagree with your first sentence (altho I think one of the few drawbacks of rising social net spending is that it puts pressure on discretionary science funding).		To the 2nd, why look at non-defense? Defense was a key channel of funding
In the last 48 hours:		Trump's chief economic adviser said the president's orchestrated shutdown could lead to an economic downturn.		And his lawyer said he can no longer guarantee that Trump's presidential campaign did not collude with Russia.

5/ If AOC wanted to kill innovation, she wouldnt propose a barely applicable tax rate.		She'd slash research, protect employer-sponsored insurance to keep tomorrow’s founders locked in today’s cubicles, and increase student debt to make entrepreneurship more precarious. 		... Oh.

3/ The digital revolution is built on a group of government-sponsored breakthroughs in military and computer technology from the 1950s and 1960s.

@MattBruenig sure, i’ll grant that explicitness is a spectacle and the media is yanked around by spectacle
The scandal became a scandal when the GOP decided to finally uphold the standard that out-in-the-open racists don’t deserve to lead their party.		I’ll close by simply saying: This is a decision that can be made more than once.
For years, King’s racism has been loud, blatant, constant. His most recent comments were more explicit, yes, but they revealed no new info about his opinion of non-white ppl.		So what was really  new this time around? Not an outbreak of racism. An outbreak of enforcement.
One of the lessons of Ari Adut’s On Scandal is that many famous scandals aren’t an outbreak of transgression—since ppl are sinning constantly—but an *outbreak of enforcement.*		That’s a good framework to see the GOP’s treatment of King—and by extension, Trump.
Rejecting Rep. Steve King while embracing Donald Trump might be politically convenient, but it isn't philosophically or morally defensible. https://t.co/7UNgfr9xXl https://t.co/OZ1DGsh907

@khurramnaik c'mon man
The Twitter-troll complex is like a progressive tax structure.		Tweeting about Trump or AOC typically earns more interactions, but it moves you into a higher and higher troll-response bracket. The strongest opinions about either can trigger nearly punitive rates of trollery.
What clearest to me from the tape and transcript is:		a) Trump seems more emasculated by the suggestion that he's Russia's minion than upset by the charge that he's acted treasonously		b) Pirro is giggling by the end of the question, so Trump's off the hook by the time he talks
The absence of a straight "no" in this answer is obviously shocking, and potentially telling.		But—as always—hard to know whether Trump is strategically dissembling, or whether he's deaf to the gravity of the topic, just the hears &lt;INSULT&gt; and goes on his typical defensive rant. https://t.co/WII7mdvY8p

I would hope that even the most JG-loving liberal analysts would admit that "running out the clock on unified govt and waiting until the opposition party controls the legislative branch" is a really weird way to go about passing the most controversial parts of your platform
For analogy, imagine:		- Dems win all 3 branches in 2020	- make little attempt to even debate Jobs Guarantee legislation	- lose huge in the 2022 mid-terms and, even as unemployment falls to new lows, shut down the govt indefinitely unless GOP Congress votes to start funding JG
I see more conservatives are finding ways to argue that the Democrats "own" the shutdown, even tho:		a) It started under Republicans	b) Trump said from the beginning he wanted to own it	c) It's over a far-right policy that unified GOP govt never came close to passing

Discrimination has several forms. Not hiring women/minorities is an extreme example. 		But here is another form of discrimination:		Minority/female execs are too often hired to be stewards in "worse" (objectively insecure) leadership roles, w/ greater likelihood of failure.

Researchers found a similar effect in the corporate world, with women. 		Women are significantly more likely to be hired by companies in a crisis—which means they're more likely to be seen as failing, which means they have shorter tenures.		https://t.co/UbKXmqWYks https://t.co/BY9Dain70f

I think a lot of what we call window-shifting is really more like window-making. On many, many issues, the public is vaguely ambivalent. It’s a wall, not a window. 		The policy entrepreneur’s job is—through articulation, charisma, and repetition—to make the window.
My sense is that many ppl equate (3) with classic window-shifting, but it kind of implies that most ppl have strongish priors about public policy, which is … obviously wrong!		Most ppl don’t have strong, settled opinions about optimal tax policy!
1. “AOC persuaded me millionaire taxes are good”		2. “I never cared about top rates until AOC talked about them—now I care! Raise!”		3. “I liked millionaire taxes but thought they were a crazy idea. Now they don't seem so crazy, so I’ll tell pollsters I like it!”		3 diff things.

7. The 1800s, which may also be our future, were a period of rampant bias and chaos in media. But it will also a period of historic political engagement.		So perhaps that's the economics-driven future of news: hyper-partisan, but hyper-participatory.		https://t.co/IMdlWtAPlr https://t.co/iOJJECC6k8
6. Pessimistically, this will lead to hyperpartisan news outlets (who won't need to be "safe" for advertisers) trying to activate unsavory ideological cult followings. 		But optimistically, it will lead to exciting experimentation and reader engagement from more moral news orgs.
5. Mid-century news was as broad/milquetoast as its revenue source (dept stores); media of the future will be as messy, diverse, and riotously disputatious as their audiences, because directly monetizing them may be the next central challenge https://t.co/IMdlWtAPlr
4. To survive in an environment with less advertising, news organizations will have to turn to patronage and reader support, the twin pillars of the early 19th century news business.		I think we're going to see this economic shift reflected in coverage. Here's how:
3. Today, obviously, FB + G are taking a lot of that money. But it's not just them. Many more tech co's are getting into ads. Which means ad-funded media's competition may soon include:		- Amazon	- Microsoft	- Uber	- AT&amp;T	- Oracle	- Roku	- and, soon enough probably, Netflix https://t.co/42gbD6kz9Z
2. The rise of advertising had many benefits (more financial independence, more money for reporting) but also some subtle drawbacks, like a neutered, detached style of reporting—the “view from nowhere”—to avoid offending the biggest advertisers, like dept stores.
1. In the early 1800s, before the penny press introduced ads as the dominant business model of newspapers, news orgs were more partisan, since they were funded by partisan patrons and ideological readers.

And when you think about how many would-be actors are realizing that it's easier to make money on-line than on-stage, it's not too cheeky to suggest that "fake sponcon" is practically the new off-off-Broadway—the wise, necessary stepping stone to merchandizing a telegenic smile

@Hesiod2k11 oh that's interesting! what could i read on that?
If anybody has any leads here, I'm dying to see them. 		This is a topic where I'm all framing questions and no conclusions.
In a multicultural, digitally-connected society, the marketplace for new totalizing belief systems is abundant. And I hope academics and journalists help us understand what KIND of belief entrepreneurship is more likely to thrive in these conditions, for good or ill.
This is bigger than politics. 		Identity formation used to be a familial inheritance. Now it's a capitalist enterprise. Ppl feel responsible for defining themselves, and there is evidence that, in the marketplace of identity formation, extreme/high-arousal choices win.
Iannaccone ("strict churches are stronger") has shown that more cult-like religions are growing faster than mainstream faiths.		And you see this in secular culture. Goop is so culty. It's a set of untested (or outright wrong) theories about wellness that ask for a leap of faith.
There is, however, an interesting essay lurking inside that Sullivan piece.		The decline of religiosity has coincided with the rise of non-traditional belief systems ("cults" if you must) and the growth of secular movements that do the metaphysical "work" of religion.
This is very good.		Believing that one's weltanschauung is uniquely devoid of an identity-based politics is the single most boring and cliched kind of identity politics you can practice. https://t.co/t8L7wiiS08

The squandering of America's elite colleges:		1. Research finds that our top schools do nothing to raise incomes among male students from rich families. 		2. Yet they enroll more students from the top 1% than the entire "bottom" 60%. https://t.co/3uMOnhSvoP https://t.co/Kjem3KK62d
You know that trendy "opting out" narrative that women from elite schools are less likely to work?		It's wrong, says new research. In fact, one of the most obvious effects of going to an elite school is married female grads are MUCH more likely to work.		https://t.co/3uMOnhSvoP

@lymanstoneky Fine summary, but I think that's exactly what I said.		I quote the author saying college selectivity raises LFP among married women and summarize by emphasizing the elite school-&gt;careerism channel of influence "for the vast majority of women," since most women get married
In the big picture, elite colleges don’t seem to do much extra for rich white guys. 		But if you’re not rich, not white, or not a guy, the elite-college effect can be huge. https://t.co/3uMOnhSvoP

@ranreichman in the us. meat consumption per capita is way over over the last half century, mostly bc we eat way more chicken
In short: More than moral arguments against meat, the movement needs a technological revolution in better, cleaner, delicious food. https://t.co/ETaVzcLfGf
@ScottLucas86 there are a lot of us
This is how it will go, I think:		1. Scientists/companies develop tastier, affordable non-meat options	2. Per-capita meat consumption finally starts to go down	3. "Peak meat??" media narrative builds (like peak soda)	4. Momentum accelerates as moral args piggy-bag off the trend.
It's been interesting to watch the most recent PETA mockery as somebody who thinks 		a) its shame strategy has been a total failure for decades (meat consumption per capita has only increased in last 40 years)		b) PETA is probably on the right side of history and moral progress

@robinsloan @conorsen yeah. i think its legitimately harder to think for yourself when you're constantly aware of other ppl's tastes. the internet is kind of a public bath of social influence; which is great for, eg, exposing you to out-of-network ideas, but also leads to a lot of in-group uniformity
@conorsen the countervailing trend is that (as we're already seeing) there are only two stories in horserace media: up and down. so when candidates peak, there's a sometimes-explicit/sometimes-implicit interest to drag them down, and a coinciding interest to lift somebody else up
@conorsen music: today's top 40 stations w/ better data on audiences have more similar playlists, so popular songs are more (over-)played today		politics: publishers/TV producers w/ better audience data know what crushes, leads to more clustering around a handful of stars and stories
