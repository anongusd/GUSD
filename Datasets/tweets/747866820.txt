@TheLoveBel0w A report showing how certain corporate taxes, laws effect us - consumers/businesses - all,  may be helpful to voters if they are wavering between supporting democrats or republicans. People need to know that the Democratic Process is in danger and we must demand secure voting.
@TheLoveBel0w The US can well afford health care and education for all - if the method of taxing is corrected. Corporations would be nothing without consumers.They must contribute accordingly. The cost of prescription drugs and all necessary services MUST be regulated across the country.
@TheLoveBel0w Other Nations are successfully incorporating methods to reduce pollution/Green Technology with economic growth and we can do this in the United States, saving money and the earth. Education is key to the success of a nation.We are a young country and must learn from our elders.
@TheLoveBel0w America needs to understand about the importance of voting straight ticket and why. The news must present factual research to back up conclusions regarding politics, healthcare-and I include the environment as part of that...
