@GovernorVA I had a toe on your side with this blackface thing until you came back and denied it was you after owning your mistake just a few hours prior. You had the opportunity to do right. You failed. #ResignRalph
@RoseMLafreniere @itsJeffTiedrich @realDonaldTrump @MeanwhileinCana OMG I laughed harder than I should have at this. Thank you for the laugh!
@realDonaldTrump Do you remember this? The shutdown is due to your inability to be anything but a toddler in diapers throwing a fit. Grow the fuck up and try, JUST TRY, to lead this country with just a little bit of maturity for fucks sake. https://t.co/twpmCc9rUS
@boggywood @peterjhasson @redsteeze I agree it took too long to come to this decision. I regret not doing it sooner the moment they dug their heels in and refused to change or step down. We've been working on them internally. I personally did give them too much time. I do regret that deeply. :(
@realDonaldTrump Still getting spanked by the Obamas. You will never measure up. https://t.co/S2W9tkrvI1
@realDonaldTrump Cool, thank you for acknowledging that Democrats have more power over the country than you do. Thanks for telling the world that us Dems ARE the economy. Dems, more powerful than trump!!!!
@RealDonad_Trump What about Puerto Rico? You are are too fucking stupid to realize you are their president too. Unfortunately. You are weak and worthless. Pathetic. Everyone you bullied are turning against you and you are going down in the flaming pile of shit that you are. https://t.co/4oPQwIauAM
@cathymcmorris If I want to be lied to, I just need to look at @realDonaldTrump 's tweets. You're going to be gone come November. https://t.co/70lfVP2qaA
@realDonaldTrump once again you are showing just how ignorant you are. Campaign finance violations are in fact a felony. He will be spending time in jail for his CRIMES. He's going to throw you under the bus for a lighter sentence. For Gods sake, STOP LYING. Gain some self respect! https://t.co/6MT42G9dz3
@Alanis don't you think we need another "Isn't it Ironic" song for everything blowing up and piling up on our felonious administration in the white house?
@theRollDdice @RealDonad_Trump You just won twitter for the day!
@RealDonad_Trump "what you gonna do when they come for you" https://t.co/JnuzswfY5t
@RealDonad_Trump MAGA by convicting all the felons in YOUR administration!  You are going to an impeachment hearing come November...if not sooner once the GOP finally realizes their loyalty means nothing to you. You will throw them under the bus just like you did your son. Ask Manafort and Cohen
@RealDonad_Trump You are going down! Time to face the consequences of being a lying crook! You will have a jumpsuit that matches your skin color. @MichaelCohen212 and Manafort are going to bury you. I can't wait!! https://t.co/pxqedWR4t0
@realDonaldTrump Just pay for it out of the tiny penis compensation fund.

@realDonaldTrump Learned that one from your mistake with @StormyDaniels  did you? I highly doubt you were smart enough to create an agreement that would silence her. Signed or not signed.
@StormyDaniels Thank you for your bravery!

@BuzzFeed If we ask men to not sexualize/objectify women, then we can't sexualize/objectify men. That is true feminism.

@realDonaldTrump if you think 10 people equals "tremendous" support. What do you think the 100s of thousands at women's march were?
@katiecouric @realDonaldTrump is too weak to be able to withstand even the smallest of insults and jokes. Of course he couldn‚Äôt go he'd cry.
@JasenKaplan @margaretcho I totally agree.
@JasenKaplan @margaretcho Lambchop is a beloved icon from many a childhood memories. He just successfully compared you to a legend!

@SpeakerRyan Please release a statement condemning Steve Bannon, the white supremacist who @realDonaldTrump has appointed as chief strategis
@realDonaldTrump please address the hate, violence, and segregation occurring in your name. It would go far with both sides. Start unity plz
@margaretcho @rosemcgowan Yes, I was so impressed with what she wrote. I wish she could walk next to me and tell haters where they can go!
@margaretcho Love this! Thank you for sharing.
@Pink oh I am so sorry for your loss. Its tough seeing the senseless death of someone you care about.
@Pink  abso-fucking-lutly!!
@Pink people are going to hate. Don't let them get to you. You r a beautiful person. Stay you!
@Pink Happy Birthday!!!
@Pink you look so tired.  Have you taken time for you lately?
@Pink nothing wrong with relaxing and enjoying life between concert tours. Stop hating folks its just a few pounds.  She will rip it soon.
@Pink I think its great your trying new things. Lyrics are beautiful. This type of music doesn't showcase your powerful voice and strength
@Pink Happy Anniversary!
