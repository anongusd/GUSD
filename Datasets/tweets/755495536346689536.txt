@seungminkim Repeat after me, everyone: "There is no other industrially-developed nation that has an illegal alien population of between 11 and 20 million when its overall national population is 325 million."

@16campaignbites @tedlieu @realDonaldTrump There is a very great difference between applying for naturalization and permanent residency and acting as one's own immigration service, Internal Revenue Service, and Department of Labor.

@RMConservative Explain how being a sanctuary city or sanctuary state in violation of federal law is any different from 1960s state and local refusals to desegregate? Sanctuary cities and states have endorse democrat governor of Alabama George Wallace posthumously.

@RepKihuen So does violating American law, acting as one's own immigration service, one's own department of labor, and one's own Internal Revenue \Service. WRONG ANSWERS!
@krassenstein @IndivisibleSDNo Ahem, we are NOT short of illiterate, innumerate, and unskilled labor in the United states. The President is never going to get awards as a wordsmith but he IS correct on trade, immigration, China, North Korea, Burma, Venezuela, Iran, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Syria.
@AlexandravonNah @POTUS Would you like to welcome more illiterate, innumerate, and unskilled labor to YOUR country? I think NOT.
@ananavarro It might make sense to you that the US has the largest number of illegal aliens living within its borders of any industrialized nation. that does NOT make sense to the majority. We are NOT short of unskilled, illiterate, and innumerate labor in the United States.
@CNN It is the kind of country that has been far too nice for far too many years so that it has largest population of illegal aliens living within its borders of any industrialized nation anywhere. Not only doesn't that make any sense, it is madness.
@RepTimRyan You might look at far larger nationalized industries in China including steel, coal, cement, and oil to make real differences.
@Amy_Siskind Those who have illlegally crossed the southern border do have the option of choosing the "far superior conditions" on the southern side of the border, dearest. Misrepresentation by any other name smells as foul.
@Bakari_Sellers Yeah, right, you just appear on CNN every chance you can get your face on the camera as an ex-state representative right. Diverting attention from your misrepresentational reality does not change the unconscionable nature of your behavior.
@tedlieu @SecNielsen Remember how the Obama maladminstration inflated the numbers of people that it "deported" by simply releasing people who dragged dependent children with them when they illegally crossed the southern border?
@nancypelosi I am so "impressed" by the manner that this Representative has "couched his language" so as "not to impugn the integrity of Secretary Nielsen. https://t.co/qEf5Y3eSLz
@AmirTaheri4 The Islamic Republic of Iran has to do something with the $150 billion made available to it by the JCPOA. Accordingly, it finances the Hezbollah terrorists, the Hamas terrorsts, the terrorists in Yemen, and the terrorists in Syria. France and Germany want freetrade with Iran.?
@JRubinBlogger I am incensed to tears that misrepresentationists like you are listened to. I commend every illegal alien to the conditions in Latin America, conditions you make sound better than those at our southern border.
@Bakari_Sellers Yeah, our existing border controls have worked so "well" over the years. |The result has been that we have 11-20 million illegal aliens living in our country, a number that exceeds any other nation that is industrially developed.
@SenatorDurbin Neither are you, Senator.
@greta We're supposed to believe that conditions in Latin America are so much "better"? COME OFF IT!
@NancyPelosi The United States does not have a charter to operate as the world's social welfare agency. We have enough illiterate and innumerate people in our country, the world's third mos populous. Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia are all open Spanish-speaking  nations.
@seungminkim Hopeless, because msnbc and CNN are twenty-four-hours-a-day misrepresenationists who select facts to confirm their preconceived notions and views.
@Bakari_Sellers @IvankaTrump Why is it necessary for you, allegedly a journalist and commentator, to denigate anyone who ascribes to views that don't happen to match those of yourself? WHERE is objective presentation of facts?
@Atencio1Ron @CuomoPrimeTime @ChrisCuomo @maddow "Sticking with" Rachel Maddow and msnbc is the problem! You will never get a balance of news there, only misrepresentations exluding all information that doesn't not confirm the preconcieved notions of Rachel maddow and msnbc. Those broadcasts are blatant propaganda.
@greta Congressional hearings have become VERY disappointing because Representatives and Senators make their allotted time a platform to expound their views rather than to ask pointed questions of the party being examined. Little is achieved.
@JaclynCorin It's naïve to believe or claim that every minor child in company with an adult crossing the border is a blood relative of that adult.

@Kristol_Love It is inconceivable that China can be the world's second largest economy concurrent with being a "developing" economy. India claims the same on a smaller scale.

The head of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Bill Priestap apparently said corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its “infancy” at the time of the FISA application.
In September 2016, Steele spoke with Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president.” Ohr’s wife worked for the research firm that hired Steele.

To force Southern states 2 extend state citizenship rights 2 former slaves, GOPs in the US House passed 14th Amendment, 5/10/1866, as did Senate, 6/8/1866. 100% of democrats voted against it. The 14th Amendment was adopted by the states on 7/28/1868. #BlackHistoryMonth
On 2/5/1866, GOP Rep. Thaddeus Stevens intro'd legislatn 2 give formr slaves “40 acres &amp; a mule,” but dems opposd it, led by Pres Andrew Johnson. On 4/9/1866, Congr GOPs overrode Pres Johnson’s veto &amp; passd Civil Rights Act 1866, conferring rights of citizenship on freed slaves.
It wasn’t until Republicans pushed thru 13th Amendment in 1865 that slavery was abolished in America. democrats in the South tried to scuttle the new law with Jim Crow laws and other rules designed to keep blacks enslaved, but eventually that went down as well	#BlackHistoryMonth

@JoyAnnReid The personification of moral repugnance is 11-20 Million illegal aliens living in the US as immigration law/reg, tax law/reg, &amp; labor law/reg VIOLATORS. It is "morally repugnant" that 80 Million of 325 million Americans have withdrawn from the economy in hopelessness. #AMJoy

@indivisibledgo @SenBennetCO I believe that CHIP covers 8 million children. The national population is 325 million. Presumably, there r more than 8 million children in the USA. You make America sick Again by insulting America as though America were not able 2 understand demographics, mathematics, or sanity.
@indivisibledgo @SenBennetCO If CHIP were so valuable, it would've been subsumd in ACA. CHIP &amp; DACA are ancillary relative 2 CR &amp; were clearly tackd on 2 blackmail thinking ppl into voting 4 DACA, a subset of chain migratn &amp; amnesty promoting endless repetitn of breakg immigration, labor, and tax law.

The intolerable obsession with supremacist groups ever since Obama's candidacy announcement and the unconscionable misrepresentation of their influence on the electorate is beyond criminal. It is outright lying.
If supremacist groups posed any threat whatsoever, they'd demonstrate in major cities, not in Pikeville, KY and Charlottesville, VA. Any group of any threat action would be urban, not hiding out on the UP of MI, the panhandle of ID, or the outback of MT.

YET, that's what MSM calls "Russian interference in 2016 election". Russian interference DID OCCUR thru hacking ~20 states' voting databases. Media thrust OUGHT TO FOCUS on anti-hacking &amp; not allegations of requests 4 interference. That failure defines "shameful and repulsive"
Where is the logic in these statistics? How is it feasible that $100K on social media advertising caused Hillary Clinton to lose the election? How can $100K outdo both the $11B in general advertising and the US $1B spent on digital media advertising?
