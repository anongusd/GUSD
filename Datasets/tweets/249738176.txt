@RepMikeCoffman @senbennetco: #citizenship2013 should include enforcement. Not good for #Colorado, not good for families
#citizenship2013 is about our families, our values, and our communities.
We are people of faith who have spoken from our values #citizenship2013
.@RepMikeCoffman on #citizenship2013: does not support pathways to citizenship w/o enforcement.
.@jaredpolis #citizenship2013 answer: should not be contingent on a enforcement
Again, the question we're asking: will you support a pathway to #citizenship2013 not contingent on "secure borders" or "enforcement"
.@SenBennetCo: the legislation will be contingent on secure borders. That's a no. #citizenship2013
