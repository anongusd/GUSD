@CindyBP @MarineReconDad a side
@CindyBP @MarineReconDad no I am aware of so much that I know neither answer is true. It takes more courage to admit that then just picking
@smats88 just me at the moment
@CindyBP @MarineReconDad aren't yes or no
@CindyBP @MarineReconDad civil rights movement all law breakers, jesus Christ a law breaker it takes more backbone to admit some things
@smats88 awesome I am a convert so I plan on doing a mission after I retire and I will follow you too
@smats88 @MarineReconDad yes
@CindyBP @MarineReconDad also again a leading question you want yes or no but the answer is depends
@CindyBP @MarineReconDad just because you view something simply doesn't make it so. There are complexities in the workings
@MarineReconDad sure I am LDS btw
@MarineReconDad so if I disappear thanks for the convo I have enjoyed it and learning about how you view things
@MarineReconDad I was there but you think in a different fashion. I am trying to accommodate it. But it is almost time for church activities
@MarineReconDad chooses. I like helping people plan and simple.  Some people want it to go back to elsewhere that doesn't help others
@MarineReconDad there was a war that our money didn't need to go to either but we are in a democracy...so it can go wherever the government
@MarineReconDad it does sometimes and I rather give my money to people who need help than those who don't
@CRL071978 @MarineReconDad actually depending what you did with money and when you got caught that might happen. But it shouldn't
@MarineReconDad cool you're a business man...biochemistry, non profit &amp; volunteer  like mediations for court
@MarineReconDad wait times, breaking up families,  eligibility for certain benefits
@MarineReconDad I wrote a list of broken parts but I will rewrite them.  In a more twitter friendly fashion. Facebook is so much easier
@MarineReconDad we are and I am focused I do comparisons
@MarineReconDad it's a complicated matter because there are so many factors at play. So it's a yes and no situation
@MarineReconDad and civil rights.
@MarineReconDad that's a leading question because it depends on if it's a good law or bad law and things like prohibition are examples
@MarineReconDad it is wrong only because we say it is. We can just as "easily" change that with a bill
@MarineReconDad most of the time these people do it because it causes no harm. I will condemn their actions for trying to do to better
@MarineReconDad how often do speed, most people do it, they are breaking the law too? And people do it because in most Cases cause no harm
@MarineReconDad what is broke is to see families torn apart creating resentment
@MarineReconDad into this country to be with her American husband
@MarineReconDad wait longer than people from another because of skin tone. What is broken is my friend's french wife being hassled to get
@MarineReconDad is turning away people who want to contribute to our greatness as a whole. What is broken is making people from one country
@MarineReconDad so that's where I stand and what is broken to me is a country is turning away people who are doing the same. What is broken
@MarineReconDad 4/4 requires work and our country worked for better treatment of people.
@MarineReconDad 3/4 can do spirit that makes us great.  Anyone that mirrors that spirit is American to me if they choose.  Because greatness
@MarineReconDad is not b the where you are born but the who you are. American to me is about working for a better life. It's the can do 2/3
@MarineReconDad if being born here makes you an American then I would guess the system is not broken for you. However, my stance is not 1/2
@MarineReconDad 2/2 respond with what is given.
@MarineReconDad that kinda answers the question but I don't think as it is stated it fully represents your thoughts on it. But I will 1/2
@MarineReconDad 2/2 knowing where each other stand in relation to each other If you can answer: what makes you an American in your opinion?
@MarineReconDad well it's combinations of things and it spreads into different areas. However, it's hard to discuss the topic without 1/2
@MarineReconDad so why let people suffer, when it's in our power to stop it?
@MarineReconDad and we can end so much of it just by addressing the situation.
@MarineReconDad sudden rush...it's been over  year since something was sent. But ignoring that: people before politics.  I dislike suffering

Simply put be the change for the better.  The change that creates heroes not villains #BeTheChange
Be the person that sees both the good &amp; bad and calls it all by its name. Accept it then work towards changing it w/o malicious #BeTheChange
Forgiveness is strength. But do not forgive and forget. Let the world know all that happens and be stronger than negative #BeTheChange
And even though some will scolded or work against this change never give in to the negative forces and harm for revenge #BeTheChange
There is greatness in all of us. Don't fear others' &amp; they won't fear yours. Learn to coexist &amp; change all of us for the better #BeTheChange
When we value other people as much as we value our self we can do greater and greater things #BeTheChange
Return to people saying a phrases like #LiveUnited and doing not just in the public domain but in the back rooms of an office #BeTheChange
This world can and will be great again. Greater than it was before when we return to our standards.  #BeTheChange
When people can once again be allowed 2 be human &amp; make mistakes w/out risk of losing everything &amp; never have chance to correct #BeTheChange
When people don't just look out for themselves but the team of people who work with them. #BeTheChange
How much of our greatness would our world be restored to if we could once again become a people who stand truly United again #BeTheChange
We seem to have lost our ability to value the intangible greatness inside of all of us for materialistic gains #BeTheChange
Many times people will not speak up because our job, our livelihood is at risk. But what about our souls &amp; consciousness? #BeTheChange
Though the organization does so much good,  it never feels as if it can be trusted #BeTheChange
What's worse is this is what becomes normal in our society.  Say one thing and do another #BeTheChange
To have one department say a person needs X amount of money to survive on their own and pay people 0.66X amount is not United #BeTheChange
To treat the work and efforts of the people around you as unimportant &amp; look down on them is the exact opposite of that phrase #BeTheChange
I used to work for a place whose motto was #LiveUnited be sometimes their actions towards people weren't very United #BeTheChange
Why do we allow people to treat other people's lives as less than human? #BeTheChange
