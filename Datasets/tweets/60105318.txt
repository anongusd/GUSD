Sorry, Mr President, Washington D.C. dealing with the problem just punished the law followed with an object ‚Äúthe weapon‚Äù NEVER dealing with the real problem ‚Äùsystem is broken‚Äù, and as a consequence creates this alert, the problem is not the weapon.

I'm tired of all these movies that try to make you feel guilty for a story that can not be changed. I am not inherit from your mistakes or sin. We are all inherently the victories that we live. Force me to allow some to be created superiol or above the law, order, and equality.
#ThePost another film w/the desperation of the multimedia show how necessary they are in society w/o exposing his abandonment to report the facts with evidence. Influenced by corrupt elite to attack any gov think independently. The press sell as super hero, one again.
USA does not educate its citizens with a critical mind, they are only a zombie repeating a single source of information. The problem is: Which source is the correct information? consequence, Turned against the gov, this mind is captured by the media who attacks the gov.
USA is like Greece asking itself: why? in the limits of the nation arrives roma army. Yes, the conclusion is history be kind, dialogue and all this trash of the media. it only makes us weak and vulnerable. Are we repeating the same conclusion?
My country believes itself a super hero saving the world and ignoring the American needs. Our country has not solved its problems, technology and illegal immigration continues to replace American citizens. Said that, I'm worried that tomorrow will be with our economy and future
If you think Florida is awesome! Think twice. FL is the next L.A with horrible traffic with many car on street. Big corporations blocking better public transport like a train across of central Florida. Project unfinished in the streets.

I sending like 75% of my check in tax, before to pay for my job, after shopping service bills gas and more is equal to more, totally unfair
I spent $ 45 in energy with equations dual charges before "oil" and then "energy" over other fee and taxes, paid $ 251.98. Not right to live
North America bills are over 100, no matter how simple like internet. that we keep printing 1 20 50 there is nothing that can pay that digit
the government's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing a good American citizen, you have 3 jobs, your children grow alone, not family or a social live, no power $
lie to me and tell me that my federal government is not above my state, the feds continue in the line of his creation's foreign relations.
Every day own government is far away of his own people, forget is from the start people to the people.
a government of abuse the only option is putting more distance between people means the military. their decisions left alone in fear.
People are tired of their government, tyranny and abuse and $ falling. government staring feeling his own people white house canada Palace
Why U.S still print out $1,.$10 and $50 and this no match with the reality bills. U.S no telling you real crisis is not power of acquisition
We need telling to federal government you need stop stealing money for the state and people and give away to the terrorist and enemies.
Fck federal election! My state election is more important, if my state is stronger keeping federal out of my life.
water and energy bill over $100, food market over $100, other more $100, why US still printing out $1,$5 or $50? to blind us?
Dear US Government stop printing $1, $5, $10 and $50... I can't buy anything with that amount. We lost the acquisition.
Pay for living, we show you live with energy water fancies food, now you busy living for it, now, you not watch me I own you salve my people
Make work all you want, keep me busy pay all you higher bills, kill all you want. I'm never died, I'm a idea, you fear.
Why we needed a government who wanna fix the world, but forgetting his own people's.
United States need to be a Republic again for the people to the people. Before this economic kill the last family Union
@Microsoft tnx you for still fight, in the market, keep the competition and not the monopoly of the other. Still on! Don't back off any step

Democratic used the control in the congress make true they hire agenda "Obama Care" and supreme court too, just the president speak alone?
Terrorist everyone who show no agree with federal government.
Don't be aloud and say what wrong with this federal government or you new name is terrorist.
Supreme court poppet of the federal government and they not are stronger to stop what they created.... Federal Dictator.
Obama care supreme court never apology for fail to the people.
Obama care just one of the million proof the dictator of the federal government.
I want back the republic consent in USA, means the people have the power.
USA talk of reform, which is nothing else to deliver this nation to undocumented immigrants who can not govern their ancient lands.
Rome was a great empire and callus vs USA is a great empire will fall. Is a history event... Again..Born a new one everything start again.
Definition of terrorism in the American Nation is all used speech or use force to scream his frustration in our government system.
The true trouble is this country United States of the american is "Politics Party" All together take down the constitution with full agree.
Military protected for external attack and Supreme Court can't stop the government. How defend the people?
Congressman have autism live in their own world, sponsored by corporations anymore are accountable to their peoples.
when the federal government was toppled my state and I now ruled by a central government and away from people.
I want my State governor back to the power working for me.
I want a government system close for the people by the people, not federal government too far of the people.
State need push to take back the autonomy and  make a broad line between and federal govt and i hope Crow in supreme Court see it...
This issue "Obama Care" just proof the party democratic and republican is bad idea for this country, government, nation with hire agendas.
Obama say he "fix Obama care"... Fix the federal government back to the international community and leave the state work for the people.
Obama's care law just show how incorrectly is federal government pass over the constitution and over the state autonomy.
Federal Congress chokes me a tsunami of laws and never eliminates useless. Whit have a whole liberty is still growing. I'm confused.
The federal gov have to understand is no terrorism in our nation, only citizens weary: war, economic and deliver the USA to undocumented.
Is time come on and reboot this federal government is a complicatedly a bad joke. dirty the name of the father of the nation.
Supreme Court stop make the federal government one central government, void the State, is not what the Constitution say...
Federal government no have power over state.. Fit it..federal government go back to you job international community.
Waiting Microsoft call me to be the CEO of the company. LOL I have great idea to make this company Successful over apple and Google.
The Politico in my country, have a family. The citizens of my country, has 3 o more jobs and his children's grow alone.
Do not demonstrate the stress of the federal government in you, or just be called a terrorism case isolated.
