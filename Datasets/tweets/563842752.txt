@WingateHotels Never had an issue before with Wingate and was shocked at this event. Anyway, won‚Äôt ever make this mistake again. Definitely don‚Äôt want my tax dollars to go to a hotel that won‚Äôt let me stay there. Hotel front desk was really rude about it too.
@WingateHotels And they won‚Äôt refund my money. I‚Äôve already heard that this practice is illegal here and two city council members are going to alert the city lawyer that your hotel is in violation of the city discrimination ordinance. I‚Äôm visiting an attorney tomorrow.
@WingateHotels Basically I paid 800 dollars for two rooms through Expedia and got here and they told me they don‚Äôt allow locals to reserve rooms (I need two rooms for my family for four days as my house sewer needs repair).
@WingateHotels Not sure how to do it. When I try to DM you it doesn‚Äôt allow me to do it. Never had that issue before.
