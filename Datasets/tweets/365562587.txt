‚ÄúThis is going to change the entire dynamics of gas markets, gas security, gas pricing, among others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere are huge expectations around the world for U.S. LNG.‚Äù
He also said that about two-thirds of the LNG export market growth over the next six years is slated to come from the U.S., which will compete with Qatar and Australia.
‚ÄúThe first phase finished by mainly using shale oil and gas for the United States domestically. Now, the export phase comes and this will have major, long-lasting implications for global oil and gas markets.‚Äù

Naatz: IPAA commends @NatResources for deferring to state &amp; tribal regulations, permitting &amp; guidance for activities related to fracking.
Naatz: States &amp; tribes understand the geology and hydrology of their regions far better than officials in Washington, D.C.
Naatz: States &amp; tribes have a proven track record of safely, effectively regulating fracking operations on federal lands.
Naatz: Congress must ensure the agency is fully cooperating with state, local communities when making land use planning decisions.
Naatz: Over last few years, BLM‚Äôs relationship with states, local governments &amp; stakeholders has been severely tested.
Naatz: This is critical funding for Western states who rely on oil and gas revenues to fulfill budget priorities for local communities.
Naatz: Significant gov't delays only deter companies from wanting to operate on federal lands, meaning lost fed. revenue from the royalties.
Naatz: #Oilandgas projects on federal lands face months of delay due to regulatory obstacles, countless challenges due to gov't bureaucracy.
Naatz: US #oilandgas production has increased dramatically over last several years, largely on state &amp; private lands.
