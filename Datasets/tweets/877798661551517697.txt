@AkinwunmiAmbode What Nigerians have to with crowd? Does crowd change the economy of Nigeria? Wake up. Nigerians need good economy, stable energy supply, security and good road, job opportunities, stipend increase and lot more.
The two parties system provides firm support for the elite to implement their agenda from top down, whilst the ordinary people at the grassroots level squabble between themselves over which political party is the best. In reality, it doesn't matter which parties you vote 4.
