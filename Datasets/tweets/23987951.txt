@MedvedSHOW There is now a cottage industry of CA gun dealers who temporarily store the firearms for lawful non-prohibited owners who get mixed up with these overly enthusiastic implementation of these so called "gun safety" laws. The Dems just HATE guns in my state.
@MedvedSHOW You mentioned CA and its firearms STOP laws. It's being abused as government tends to do. The CA DOJ has confiscated some citizens collections when a disgruntled ex-wife or non family member initiates. The CA gun rights groups are very concerned.
@MedvedSHOW This "pastor" is hilarious! Only a few thousand verses come to mind listening to the "mission statement" of the Brewery Church. I guess he didn't study the Bible very much, especially the ending. Plenty of Old Testament comes to mind too. It's the End Times indeed ;)
@MedvedSHOW I agree with your last caller. This whole investigation has one mission. To get Trump. It's not a witch hunt. It is a coup. The Left is determined to undo the 2016 election. We are not going to quietly go along with that.
@MarkDavis Mark Your caller Pam calls Michael a lot and she loves Jesus but hates Trump with the fire of a thousand suns. She always lets it flow every time she calls. She's hopeless.

@chase_derlla If our efforts help put the Dems in the White House &amp; in control of Congress in January, then open borders &amp; bad trade deals
