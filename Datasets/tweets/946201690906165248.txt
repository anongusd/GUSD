@joeblow745 F looks the most rural and or open spaces , so I go with that one
@SenhorRaposa Well this isn't the first time she has threatened to push for and support primary's against incumbent Dems , then walk it back after party pushback
@ActorAaronBooth This is something that should get reformed to some extent , seems to come up with with both sides https://t.co/aTrS3UAjHE
@rudnicknoah @joncprevo Well it's interesting to see that 52% of the polled respondents say they voted for trump in 16 and he's getting a 54% average in the poll ? Basically this poll tells me he hasn't lost any support in a state he won https://t.co/CwfRxyGfLX
#ia01 rematch alert  rod Blum filed a statement of organization today https://t.co/BSvqdTXPxZ
@heather_edelson @RuthForHouse @davepinto But the 90% isn't for your bill , your using a number that has absolutely nothing to do with your bill , if you can't get public support without lying about your bill you should just stop
@BenJKest Collin Peterson secretary of agriculture, I would also consider Richard Neal for treasury and manchin for secretary of state possibly
#mn05 she's at it again , how many times will the @MinnesotaDFL hope and pray that she learns and changes ? This lady is what she is and she ain't gonna change her anti sematic ways https://t.co/ymmENefw5C
@SenhorRaposa One bit of good news for the MS Dem party today
@SenBlumenthal Hate to break it to you but your 97% number is a complete lie , your making shit up again ,
@nathanlgonzales @UntraceableMC @rollcall Accuracy and being unbiased  in reporting does matter
@SenhorRaposa I don't think it will really matter , she's kinda in line with alot of the people in  mn05 , unfortunately
@DavidOAtkins Yeah umm we aren't the ones repeatedly sending people like Maxine waters  to congress
@xan_desanctis Go twins
@IWantToBeAGMO @IlhanMN Change banks , it's pretty simple
@Carneasadaaa @khaliqrodriquez And let's not forget that west Virginia and Mississippi we're Dem controlled states not that long ago , takes awhile to pull out of that damage
@Carneasadaaa @khaliqrodriquez they are not losing as many , keep up with the facts sally , wake me up when those states hit a negative 45k population lose number or over  100k in net domestic migration lose
@SenFeinstein So turtles , sheep and trees get better protection than little  defenseless babies  , the Dem way of thinking  I guess
@Carneasadaaa @khaliqrodriquez Might want to research something instead of looking like the fool , us cencus data new York and illinois lost the most population last year and California has the biggest net negative domestic migration lose , all facts all true
@alexnazaryan @GOPChairwoman It's not an incendiary charge , they are promoting infanticide , she's not wrong
@SarahLerner @AOC Cool now do anti semites and infanticide
@brianschatz @BenJKest Are you talking about the Chicago Dem politicans? Or the new Jersey Dem politicans or maybe new York ? Maybe the Dem gov canidete from Florida ? It's hard to keep up with how many get charged with criminal activity
@NorasNewBrain @JakeSherman It's about referring illegal immigrants to ice for breaking gun laws
@jchaltiwanger @TomiLahren She's not wrong , headlines from the definitely not right leaning Minneapolis star and tribune, Minnesota leads the nation in would be terrorists , a decent reporter would of did a teeny tinny amount of research and known this  to be accurate https://t.co/hVrM1lXsCA
@sistercrow @sfpathe @collinpeterson He votes based on what the majority of his district wants ,  not what his party wants  , that's a good thing , that's how every politican should be doing it
@BenJKest Hockey
@amyklobuchar You need to represent MN and do what Collin Peterson did in the house and vote no , and bipartisan? Really , only a couple Rs voted for it in the house , it's not bipartisan
@SenhorRaposa Peterson has already publicly supported it thru legislation https://t.co/fJKgnBWNP3
@decunningham2 What about maybe a national service type volunteer program where you earn college scholarships based on how long you stay in the program?
@mistermeekins @ScottPresler The house flip was a trump won district but the Senate seat that flipped tonight gave Hillary 60%
@SenhorRaposa https://t.co/9dVk6JR9J4

@electionwatchus I have no numbers but it appears the Rs flipped a seat https://t.co/Fw0UYiOpbB
@IlhanMN What's the US code for marriage fraud ?
@MelissaTweets Your not the only one at that drum
@DougJones @BenJKest I will give credit where credit is due , solid vote by you  yesterday on the born alive bill , I tip my hat and say job well done
@SterlingEricson @BadAstronomer @AOC But what your not putting together is that she's spending on her staff instead of having a congressional district office , the spending for both comes from the same fund , she put  priority in staff pay instead of constituents service
@SterlingEricson @BadAstronomer @AOC And other expenses as you call them include office rent and staffing  of an office and office furniture and equipment  in your home district . How many does AOC currently have open by the way ? I hear it's zero
@SterlingEricson @BadAstronomer @AOC So you do support taxpayers money being spent on Washington staff salary instead of constituents service , good to know
@SterlingEricson @BadAstronomer @AOC So from the taxpayers right , do you think the taxpayers money should be spent  more on constituents service or on staff salary ? How about multiple congressional district offices , more staff to answer phones and compile emails , instead of givaways to her close associates?
@SterlingEricson @BadAstronomer @AOC Where does the money come from ?
@amyklobuchar How about you talk to your constituents about your support of infanticide ? Still waiting for your email response
@johnAHansonI @JustOGG @RepKinzinger @GovEvers You don't get to decide which commander in chief are legit or not , you can't call for insubordination against the governor and then say well I don't like trump so it's ok to be insubordinate to him , that's not how it works
@Leftist_Patriot @Tony85058128 @SenatorBenson Then why vote against it , unless these new Dem senators actually support infanticide?
@iheartmindy @maziehirono Emily's list gave 53k to her reelection bid last cycle , number one on her contributions list , per open secrets data base
@Bergertron5000 @Matthew73310992 @BadAstronomer @AOC Multiple Congressional offices within the district for one , two more people to answer the phones and emails , but ya know friends and party before the people
@BadAstronomer @AOC What part of it's not her money do you not understand

@jacobfhsmith Booker , he ran those push cart drills in college football , that tram should be easy pushing for him and less work for me
@timkaine You just voted in support of infanticide , you have no moral standing
@xan_desanctis Thanks for the info
@xan_desanctis I get Cramer , weather has been atrocious , what Happened to Lisa and Tim ?
@amyklobuchar You just voted in favor of infanticide, really ? How screwed up do your morals have to be to support that ?
@crankyuncle2 @SenKevinCramer @danieltobin Take a civics class , learn the difference between house and Senate

@democracync It's not a victory for a partisan judge to strike down two statewide votes , you can't gerrymander a statewide vote , you are cheering something that passed with majority vote , do you understand how undemocratic that is ?
@NYGovCuomo And the high state taxes is a financial assault on the taxpayers of new York
@BetteMidler I didn't know Obama wanted another Nobel , he didn't deserve the first one

@Newsweek Allegedly ? Did you watch the video , that's a heck of an "alleged" punch being thrown
@MahsaKaerra @GosalaTheBeggar @VA_GOP I'm saying he associates as a Democrat just as much or more , as he does a republican
@GosalaTheBeggar @MahsaKaerra @VA_GOP Did you notice it's a Democrat he endorsed
@GosalaTheBeggar @MahsaKaerra @VA_GOP Yep I guess that's why he's endorsing a Democrat in 2020 https://t.co/KF5AjngFtX
@GosalaTheBeggar @MahsaKaerra @VA_GOP Nope just facts
@MahsaKaerra @GosalaTheBeggar @VA_GOP Ohh don't worry he will switch back to you very soon , anti semitism is now accepted behavior in the D party , Omar and tlaib and the guy just elected in Virginia are proof positive , plus the CBC still loves Farrakhan
@MahsaKaerra @GosalaTheBeggar @VA_GOP Don't have to , facts are facts , David duke ran for president as a Democrat
@GosalaTheBeggar @MahsaKaerra @VA_GOP Those amends do they include voting against the civil Rights act and both African American supreme Court nominees ?
@kwilli1046 Looks like a hard hiring linebacker in training , that tackle form is A+
@joeblow745 I agree 💯
@GosalaTheBeggar @MahsaKaerra @VA_GOP Not as successful as Robert Byrd's political career , same background tho
@samzhang428 In Minnesota the Dems went from 52.7 to 46.4 from 2012 to 16 while republicans went from 45 to 44.9 , the biggest question in Minnesota will be who do those third party voters drift to,almost all of the bleed off was from 2012 Obama voters who couldn't /wouldn't vote for Clinton
@SethAMandel He was willing to send an innocent person to jail , faking a crime and hoping someone gets blamed , that is worth a jail sentence by itself ,
@SenhorRaposa Need to keep an eye on Connecticut , also been trending to the right on the prez level , tho maybe Lamont can swing it back some , we will have to wait and see

@MahsaKaerra @GosalaTheBeggar @VA_GOP David duke ran for president of the United States as a Democrat
@NRafter @CautiousLefty Sanders will lose Florida badly miami Dade will swing hard to the  right if it's Sanders
@CheriBustos Two million of that came from pacs , you already spent over 6 million of that , 2 million to pay debt ( which you still have 16million of )  0$ of that went to any canidete or election  and your bragging about all this ? https://t.co/6Lta2rXLN0
@neontaster @HikerDogDuo The casting was just better in the original , it just was , bill murry and Dan aykroyd are brilliant comedian actors , mcarthy and wig are good but not on that level where they can carry a film lacking a great storyline
@CautiousLefty I think Sanders loses Michigan with depressed minority turnout , Wisconsin is 50/50
@SenhorRaposa I've only donated to the republican in the MN special election this year so far , and I actually get that money back under a new mn law , up to 50$ in donations to state candidate can get a refund back
@btpanko @paolo_lim @SenhorRaposa Actually it's the anti sematic dog whistles that rep Omar rep tlaib and this guy in Virginia have said and with kieth Ellison it's his buddy buddy relationship with know racist  Farrakhan,
@JenniferWexton @DKElections Well you have a governor and attorney general who wore blackface and a LT gov who possibly raped two women and a racist anti sematic just got elected to the state house tonight , if that's the team your offering to lead the state you deserve to lose
@AndrewBond3 @joncprevo All four special elections ( any others I'm missing? ) In 2019 have Dems below the margins , MN ,GA TX and now Virgina ,and MN was a flip to the Rs
@megruels @ThatDonne @GovPritzker Or mcD could install more kiosks and robotics and lower payroll permanently adding billions to the profit margins , and high school and college kids will wonder what happened to all the part time jobs
@Bexoxo86 @GovPritzker More taxes
@GovPritzker @joncprevo If they haven't gotten a raise in 10 years they probably aren't that good of a worker , I mean seriously 10 years ?
Well that #OneMinnesota  sure didn't last long , more like #OneExpensiveMN  #dfl #mngop https://t.co/ZMVwXC2FXP
@mcimaps What the hell happened to Minnesota
@SenhorRaposa The smart move would be to vote sink 07 as much as possible , shore up 05 and make 01 a lean R district as that area is trending red anyway
@DKElections Quamba MN is an Ottawa word for mudhole , in MN we also have towns named nimrod, climax , embarrass, and quite a few that are hard to pronounce https://t.co/w3P7nldSUy
@ThePoerDemocrat @samzhang428 Not according to the couple special elections we have had in 2019 Dem enthusiasm seems to be way down , but small sample size so far
@TinaSmithMN Then you should probably be against daca also as that came from  the use of executive powers
@decunningham2 That's my national emergency lol
@decunningham2 No BBQ sauce in the house
@BettyMcCollum04 @ActorAaronBooth Is that why Obama sent national guards to the border and had a policy of deterrent because trump created a crisis ?
@SenhorRaposa I agree , I think it needs to be a full time job , but we would need to pay them more and that is a very unpopular thing , otherwise we end up with just wealthy and or retired running our state legs

@Guster_sean @HotlineJosh @JoeNBC because it deserves to be ignored, because nobody paid 90%, it's another made up fantasy of the left , the tax codes then we're entirely different than now , loopholes and basic deduction dropped everyone from the top brakets , the top 1% are only paying 5.6% less now verse 1950 https://t.co/1xawmlwBNY

@SenhorRaposa District jumping usually doesn't play well
@Guster_sean @HotlineJosh @JoeNBC Actually world war two was what finally pulled us out of the depression, the belief that FDR's socalist policy's saved us is pure fantasy
@Guster_sean @HotlineJosh @JoeNBC 30s was a depression and terrible economy , 40s was a war economy, and the 70s wasn't so great either , the 50s and 60s was good in part because we were the only industrialised country that wasn't destroyed by the war and the rest of the  world needed to be rebuilt
@TheFluff2 @thinkprogress Anti semitism is now a hero quality?
@Center4Politics Well they definitely don't want it to be about northam, Fairfax and herring I suppose
@Guster_sean @HotlineJosh @JoeNBC Until you add a price tag to the poll questions then support drops to the high 20% low 30% area
@ActorAaronBooth If you want apples to apples comparison , Christie was 53-36 in job approval after one year https://t.co/GrDfhr04mo
@bj_erngren @TinaSmithMN Ah yes an infanticide supporter
@TinaSmithMN Is this how planned Parenthood  told you to vote ?
@NYGovCuomo No , your high taxes are an attack on your economy, removing salt deduction just shed the light
@SenateDFL @KariDziedzic There is no such thing as "free"
@GOPLeader @RepDanCrenshaw Good job , keep it going
@RepRonKind Right ideas , now do it for everyone and all business
@RepWalorski @rep_stevewomack Keep at it , keep bringing it up for a vote
@StarTribune It's not free , it's taxpayers money
@dccc @realDonaldTrump Should we talk about the Dems partying it up in Puerto Rico while the shutdown was going on ?
@SenhorRaposa Seth Moulton
@PoliticalKiwi @SenhorRaposa None of them
@TinaSmithMN You work for planned Parenthood still to this day , they own you
@thecliffbar @SenRickScott @SenatorBraun If the people living in DC want representation they can merge back into Maryland , otherwise leave it as a federal zone

@mtracey Or she could not say anti sematic trope , this isn't hard to understand
@DFMresearch @SenhorRaposa Phillips makes all those brands I mentioned
@McF_Nbctoday @SenhorRaposa Alot of that blue along the border is lightly populated with clay being the exception, to put this district in perspective I believe ottertail county is the most populated at around 58k
@SenhorRaposa Awesome map , thank you
@DFMresearch @SenhorRaposa The actual Phillips brand isn't very good outside of the schnapps, but the UV vodka, prairie gin and trader Vic rum are all really good
@KamalaHarris Democrats are really really bad at economics
@bidonkules @mkraju If that's what she meant she has an awfully anti sematic way of saying it
@TinaSmithMN No statement on the racism of rep Omar ? Did planned Parenthood tell you no ?
@AngieCraigMN I noticed you don't have any tweets or statement about the anti sematic tweet from rep Omar ? Care to explain why you are silent on racism in your party ?
@CheriBustos @dccc @dankildee You think someone who just today refused to denounce an anti sematic trope is good for heartland engagement??
@Smithers_Rob @DanielBShapiro @IlhanMN Very much not alone ,
@decunningham2 Well at least he's honest about it instead of doing the political two step response, that's something I guess

@brycetache Not lie like when she promised she would serve all 6 years of her Senate seat , you mean not lie like that ? Oh and she was completely ok with Obama's detention and detour policy's , white supremacists probably not , anti semites , she already has befriended them
@bud_cann @JudyRademacher4 It's called people over party , it's rare nowadays when a politicans will put the will of the people he / she represents over the party when the two disagree
@CMAHMN @JTerrell41 @renamoran @keithellison @HallieQBrownCtr I see he's staying well within St Paul and Minneapolis, wonder when he will "listen " to outstate
@PIX11News Or you can just not stab people ?
@jetrotter @LGJustinFairfax I think it's less about his race and way more about keeping political power above all else , you see Fairfax has to go first so they can get a squeaky clean lt gov , then northam can go , but the AG will have to stay or a R will replace him , it's all about keeping Dems in power
@joncprevo To me, yang is the one that looks the best  at first glance ,
@ActorAaronBooth She didn't light the fire but the matches were hers
@xan_desanctis Kirby Puckett, Rodger Clemons
@decunningham2 That trump approval rating is interesting , they have him at 42% with Hispanics and 42% with whites , seems like a huge Hispanic number
@SenhorRaposa Likely D for Warner and president until we see how this huge ugly mess shakes out
@joncprevo El Paso is getting alot of political attention this month
@joncprevo Her or will Hurd
@SenhorRaposa Pretty good map for this stage of the election , I'm a little surprised your so pessimistic about mn01 and 08 this early tho
@NickMastro13 @SenhorRaposa Peterson is safer this cycle than the last one , being chair of the agriculture committee actually means something in this district
@zcpolitics John Lewis and Ted Cruz

@_TerriEllen @RepByrne If as you say , laws are already in place and it's not happening , then why deny a vote ? By the way you should tell the Dem gov of Virgina that it is illegal , he doesn't know
@RepByrne Keep trying , let's get Dems on record with their votes
@Ms_Liz2 @RepByrne @Guttmacher @DrJenGunter Then why deny a vote if as you say it's not happening ?

@decunningham2 Wondering just how deep this rabbit hole goes in Virginia
@jackcurran49 The northern counties there have been solid blue for awhile but the are sliding right just like mn08 has as a whole , St Louis county ( Duluth) went from 63% D in 12 prez to 52% in 16  klobachar lost about 10% from last election also

@thehill If you wonder why people don't trust the media just look at your headline , it's a born alive bill not an anti abortion bill , good god how can you screw that one up ?
@schrifty @burgessev Then why object to a bill denouncing infanticide? Votes matter more than lip service
@SenhorRaposa New Jersey would be a good bet
@xan_desanctis And the sooner the better , I wanna see who will actually vote for infanticide
@decunningham2 Agreed
@PattyMurray @BetsyDeVosED Well after today it's perfectly clear that you are ok with killing abortion survivors , you support #Infanticide , you have no moral compass
@J__Velasquez Maybe new York should not be dependent on a federal tax deduction ( subsidy) to be competitive , maybe just maybe new York should pass laws and budgets that make them competitive without federal assistance
@OHPredictive Massachusetts looks so weird colored in red

@MoreThanTango @GlennThrush @leezeldin You mean anti semitism , or is some racism fine with you ?
@SenhorRaposa Just MN 07
@amyklobuchar Honestly he should be resigning for endorsing infanticide
@SenhorRaposa Maybe 10%
@GeorgiaLogCabin Just a friendly heads up , MN is Minnesota , Bullock is Montana , MT
@clairecmc @JMilesColeman So doing blackface 30 some years ago gets the entire D world to call for him to resign ( and I'm not disagreeing with that) but the growing number of  anti semites in the party gets crickets ?
@RepJerryNadler @Stella_Basham1 Now work on your growing anti Semite problem  in your party
@PPFA @GovernorVA Let's not forget that  PP gave northam over 2 million dollars
@samzhang428 Absolutely yes , always
@ChazNuttycombe @JMilesColeman Agree that the person who would replace the governor if he resigned should stay mostly in the background and not be leading the resign charge , even if it's  obvious he should resign

@RyanAFournier @myizonorion If you want to kick her out do it because she is a raving  anti semite
@RyanAFournier @myizonorion House of Representatives is a federal election and federal law only says you must live in the state , the state law you reference is for state level elections
@TurkanaDK @stevesingiser Then ask every Dem who thinks Smith should resign if anti semites tlaid and Omar should resign
@Politics1com Maybe Dems should be pushing for tlaib and Omar to resign as hard as they are about king ,
@AlexMLeo @RLewisReports @PrisonPlanet Are you also calling for tlaib and Omar  to resign ? If not then you are the hypocrite
@AlexMLeo @PrisonPlanet Do tlaib and Omar
@tbutkevich @amyklobuchar Umm yeah they are not baseless , tlaib is an anti sematic
@Road_trippn @EvanMcMullin Then tlaib and Omar also need to resign
@MsMeowMix @EvanMcMullin Sure king should resign the exact same time as anti semites tlaib and Omar resign , if you think northam is the only racist in the Dem party your living in a bubble

@AveryPereira @ReaganBattalion @NMalliotakis Do you have a site up and running yet ?
@FuzzyMarth @DouthatNYT Abortion is popular in the first trimester that's why people want it legal but poll after poll shows a majority want abortion to be with restrictions at the same time , and Virgina already has abortion to save mom's life as legal , that's not what the new bill was about
@FuzzyMarth @DouthatNYT It's not my chart it's gallups , and no it's not odd , third term abortions have never been popular , ever, this is just  a PP pipe dream being pushed by politicans who love there PP money come campaign time ,
@AveryPereira @ReaganBattalion @NMalliotakis Thank you for running in such a tough district Avery,
@SenhorRaposa I would say Dawn Adams is now very vulnerable, only won by less than 1% and is now backtracking her co sponsor of that bill
@FuzzyMarth @DouthatNYT He's not wrong , only 13% of Americans support third term abortions only 28% support second term abortions https://t.co/0oi53tZhae
@johncardillo @DanWantsFreedom She won her last election by less than 1% she will be back peddling all year on this one
@DrCilona @DLoesch @NRA @GOP Last I checked it's the Democrat party that supports killing defenseless children
@owillis @SenSasse Or , sasse is on the side of public majority , 81% of Americans oppose third term abortions , yes 81% after the first trimester support for abortions drops radically https://t.co/69JWqrGKDq
@kk_nguyen @mnhousegop Public opinion is completely against third term abortions , Dems are on the wrong side of the majority here in gallups last poll 13% support it 81% oppose it https://t.co/S0WUpHmfGI
@great_northland @Politics1com @rudnicknoah He would fit right in with the chicago Democrats, ending up in jail seems to be a common thing there
#DFL #CORRUPTION https://t.co/6ytPJmjN1i
@LarrySabato I do know of a few Virginia Dems that gods definitely not talking to after what came out today
@GovernorVA Your complete lack of a moral compass is shameful and disgusting
@Aseemru Longer than it took the dude from West Virginia
@RepOHalleran @HouseBlueDogs It's pretty easy actually, pass a bipartisan border and budget bill and you have no shutdown , stop putting party over people
@ActorAaronBooth Well the corridors of commerce program is supposed to be split evenly but the Dayton administration found ways around the formula on that one too so I'll wait and see https://t.co/npkcwU0PeA
@LowerShoreProg @RepAndyHarrisMD But your cool with killing a born baby , got it,  your what about ism doesn't change the fact that you have no moral compass
@ActorAaronBooth I'll reserve judgement here until I see how much $$$ leaves the metro area , should be a fifty / fifty split but I'm betting it won't be
@decunningham2 Not  to mention that their are 2.66 million people with jobs in the insurance sector that she wants to put out of work https://t.co/JimIxrA65E
@DCclone @SenhorRaposa Her known association with anti semites like Abbas hamideh and Linda sarsour easily point to Rashida being at the very least a anti Semite supporter , if not a full blown anti Semite , which most of us believe she actually is
@amyklobuchar The wall looks cheap now too bad you are to busy putting politics above people , this 11billion loss could of been and should of been avoidable
@StuPolitics Hmm did I miss when trump claimed to be a in a war zone ? I remember Blumenthal lying about it tho
@SenhorRaposa He's my top choice for it
@SenhorRaposa Limestone and Madison are two of the fastest growing counties in Alabama , limestone is 6th  in raw numbers and 2nd in %, Madison is 2nd in raw numbers and 5th in %
@IlhanMN Looks like Omar is on the side of Putin , China and north Korea , I'm not entirely suprised as those three government styles are exactly what she wants here
@twincities30 @AngieCraigMN @tomemmer @RepTomEmmer No this makes it much worse , of the dfl would stop tax and spend policy's we would be in much better shape and would not need to depend on salt deduction , if republican lose control of the state senate we will be in just as worse shape as illinois , new Jersey and Conn https://t.co/9hOAohW6dQ
@RepSpanberger @HouseBlueDogs Need to get border security done or we will probably  have another shutdown soon
@joncprevo I'll trade https://t.co/0ATusUyEuy
@prosophobic @twincities30 @RepChrisSmith Your assuming that people are dumb enough to not know that Minnesota Democrats raised taxes so high that they need to get a federal bailout with a salt deduction, if you are angry about your high taxes the blame is with  the DFL policy's
@AngieCraigMN 20% saying they redirected hiring and investments to America from abroad , I call that a success,
@twincities30 @AngieCraigMN @tomemmer @RepTomEmmer Their is absolutely no reason the federal government should bail out high tax states,
@low_tex @SenBlumenthal A lie is a lie Blumenthal lied to all the people who he is supposed to represent , then he act like a hypocrite
@decunningham2 McCaskill would be first on my list
@SenBlumenthal You want to tell us your Vietnam story again ? Maybe the true version over the one you fabricated, i mean lied about
@LarrySabato @HowardSchultz Someone's political bias is showing again
@LarrySabato @HowardSchultz Kinda like when the Democrats went to court to kick the green party of the Montana ballot ? anything to win right
@SenhorRaposa I always thought walz backing Clinton early and strongly was risky in that district , then when Bernie won the caucus I figured walz would be in for a fight
@JMilesColeman NFL history , well unless your a Vikings fan still unhappy about the drew Pearson push off non call
@mrspc48 @JMilesColeman I can guarantee a bipartisan majority in his state care deeply about it
@HouseBlueDogs Ok now keep your word and fund border security
@EsotericCD @SkinsFanPG I'm a life long west Central Minnesotan, cap fan is right you got to do the burrito bundle thing if you take you little one outside, very dangerous conditions for those too young to communicate when they are cold
@joncprevo Looks like I'm in the grey , -60 to negative 70 , should be fun
@StuPolitics https://t.co/q6yJEpff0e
@seungminkim @Politics1com So after the Dems go back on their promise to faithfully negotiate on border security ( and they will) we shutdown on the 15th again and nothing is gained
@LarrySabato If government workers didn't have a god complex and a mile high list of regulations for you  at their workplace and would be held accountable for their work and  actions maybe the opinions about government workers would be better

#DFL #mn05 #mnleg https://t.co/29YcI4fsG7
@BrennaSpencer Still need 60 in the Senate
@shahmology @DanRosenheck @HotlineJosh That's Minneapolis , the rest of the state is mostly sane
@markdewes @DanRosenheck @guypbenson Yep I know the district a little , she will beat back any primary challenge, that area of the state has gone off the deep end politiclly
@mcimaps It won't work , she represents what the 5th district of Minnesota has become , and it's sad and disturbing at the same time
@SenhorRaposa You do know there is a hunting season for coyotes ,
@SenhorRaposa Coyotes are human smugglers
@EmeraldRobinson @jpodhoretz Polls were pretty good actually , the problem people have is taking national polls and expecting that to be the same state to state , on a prez race only state polls matter  national polls are meaningless
@seb4466 @SenBillCassidy https://t.co/R36RFvIqEN
@SenhorRaposa It's the same here I think , most people outside of Minnesota  don't know mark Dayton is in really tough shape  health wise
@joncprevo Definitely a good look for her
@SenhorRaposa If gallego runs and wins the primary she is definitely the favorite , would be similar to Garcia's run for gov
@joncprevo What the heck , no Minnesota numbers
@SenhorRaposa But they won't , Dan lipinski is prime example , they don't even accept life long Democrats who are kinda  centrist
@ClarkGab_le @chiproytx @RepThomasMassie 20 weeks actually and I should of said elective, their are many countries with limited exceptions like the mother being in danger of dying in childbirth type things https://t.co/hq0wbVkXmh
@HotlineJosh @joncprevo All of them
@EsotericCD At least the hashtag doesn't give his true motives away
@ClarkGab_le @chiproytx @RepThomasMassie The map is actually misleading as only six other countries allow late term abortions with China , North Korea and Vietnam being three of them , so yes I could very easily point to many countries who are morally superior to us right now
@BettyMcCollum04 You and all but 10 other Dems voted against paying them
@ThatEricAlper I was actually doing it around that age and I've never stopped
@ErickJ33 @Vlyman2013 @BettyMcCollum04 How many of those multiple bills had a snowballs chance of being signed into law ? Absolutely zero , why bring a bill to vote when you already know it won't be signed into law , all the house Dems are doing is wasting everyones time on bills that have zero chance of being signed
@MamaLuigiMN @BettyMcCollum04 Proof?
@BettyMcCollum04 You are the one who voted against paying the workers , twice , you are in the party that decides to stop working and " go home " every weekend , care to explain how your actions affect everything you just said ?
@Lee06705926 @DanCrenshawTX Un peace keepers means our military will be involved
@Brmisw @Dankness585 @DanCrenshawTX No they are not
@franco91hou @DanCrenshawTX Meanwhile the Democrats just voted for the second time against paying them
@BakerusMaximus @DanCrenshawTX The United Nations and others strongly disagree with your " democratically elected " wording , I mean unless Russia is your new bff now you should be opposed to that election result https://t.co/zjQo3jKvUg
@Cougar_9000 @EpicSuperNoobYT @DanCrenshawTX Bold ? Almost every south and Central America county along with the EU and Canada have made the same statement , there is nothing "bold " about it , we are in line with everybody else
@algaraca @politico_chris @CheriBustos @dccc Then why should any D  elected to the house pay dues to the dccc or transfer excess campaign funds to them if they won't protect them , and we are talking about the multiple millions that house Ds send to the dccc
@KeaonDousti @keithellison @renamoran Let's see if he does any Town Halls/ listening sessions  outside of the  deep blue areas of  Minneapolis/ St paul

@politicsluo I'd keep Elanie Chao  as transportation over Dayton , R and D senators seem to like her and she does a decent job and stays out of headlines
@jjeffrey_wagner @PattyMurray @senatemajldr Yes because Fox news has the magical powers to tell a Democrat what to say , about time you take your blinders off and come out of your elitist bubble
#dnc #dfl https://t.co/NsvNeDcmwL
@SenhorRaposa Jones is retiring , and price (78) Butterfield (71) Foxx(75) and Adams ( 72) are all on my retirement watch list
@jjeffrey_wagner @PattyMurray @senatemajldr I think Democrats are starting to hear from the people , https://t.co/nmVQv4oePJ
@RepOHalleran And how many of those 8 votes to re open the government actually had a snowballs chance of getting signed into law ? Doing something you know is going nowhere isn't something to brag about
@decunningham2 O'halleran just might retire also , he will be roughly  two months shy of 75 on election day
@IngrahamAngle Don't blame all of us ,she's in Minneapolis, not outstate
@SenatorMenendez @realDonaldTrump How was your Puerto Rico vacation while people you serve weren't getting paid ?
@cmclymer Actually it is about defending a defenseless life , full stop
@jjeffrey_wagner @PattyMurray @senatemajldr I'm asking you why Democrats have been willing to fund walls and barriers with a Democrat president but not a republican president , again resist is not a policy position
@jjeffrey_wagner @PattyMurray @senatemajldr So your saying the Democrats we're just fools when they voted for walls and barriers in the past , resist is not a policy position
@AmusedCynic1982 @PoliticsWolf Your bias is showing, it's pretty clear that wolf gerrymandered it , it's not as bad as the republican map( passed with Democrat support) was but a gerrymander is a gerrymander no matter how you do it

@benbaca2015 @ElizabethHeng Pennsylvania redrew thier congressional districts in 2017 so it's hard to track weather it swung right or left ? It's a mostly rural district with no major population centers
@benbaca2015 @ElizabethHeng Safe R Wagner beat wolf by a decent margin here while losing statewide
@galincal @leahaskarinam Ballot havesting , who has control of those ballots from point a to point b? Who physically oversees the person in possession of those ballots ?
@benbaca2015 @ElizabethHeng Every state has their own laws and process
@PoliticsWolf Ballot havesting needs to be illegal and Pennsylvania is a Dem gerrymander
@CoryBooker Let's put the shutdown aside for one moment , maybe you ( and this really goes to all politicans R and D )need to stop playing tribal politics and figure out why half of Americans have less than 400$ in saved up cash funds ?
@KandiRider Affordable was only 33% of what they considered , and Minnesota ranked 43 in that one ,
@PattyMurray @senatemajldr And what compromise have you made to end the shutdown , resist is not a policy position
@LBOcean111 @ElizabethHeng I think you answered your own question
@benbaca2015 @ElizabethHeng The state parties ( both republican and Democrat ) will pick the candidates to run in the special , no primary's for this one
@ClaytheSchwartz @kkondik @ActorAaronBooth So is a bipartisan voting record , and the ag chair doesn't hurt
@ryangrim @rudnicknoah "dude" you can't go to the house floor to call out another house member , it's against the ethics rules

@ignatzz @ciancagl1 @lesleyclark @AOC @senatemajldr No ,most people are just laughing at her , not with her
@runyan50 @RepPeteStauber @TransportGOP Democrats need to bring up a bipartisan compromise bill first before any meaningful votes can happen
@HARRISFAULKNER Party lines?
@SenhorRaposa @amyklobuchar @collinpeterson Yep it has , the district line is only a quarter mile away from me
@SenhorRaposa @amyklobuchar @collinpeterson Wow on those SD- 09 numbers , I thought my district would be higher tho
@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SecretService What exotic vacation spot do you already have booked for that day?
@RepCheri Put the shutdown aside for a moment , maybe you should be working on why people are going into their savings after missing one paycheck ? Maybe it's time to let people keep more of the money they earn, so people like her don't have to live paycheck to paycheck?
@diannaeanderson What work did the government do to earn that money ? The Rock actually did work for that money so why do you think the government should get the majority of what someone earned , and if you think this won't negatively affect everyone your wrong
@joncprevo First debate is in June https://t.co/WdKUJYQrlV
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You can actually do something about that , quit partying in Puerto Rico on the weekends and get to work on a compromise bill instead of playing politics with the budget , or would you rather just nuke everyone you disagree with ?
#DFL claims to be for the people yet they don't want the people to know what they are voting on ? Just more hypocrisy from the left  https://t.co/jRIC0LSN6v
@AaronMSanchez Party lines , and I'm talking telphone party lines
@RepCheri If you really put people over party you would be working weekends trying to get a compromise bill done that actually had a chance of getting passed or veto override numbers , but instead you close up on weekends and your party goes to Puerto Rico for fun in the sun ?
@tweetsforlunch @CoryBooker That would actually end minority majority congressional districts
@AOC Well you can sleep in your office like others do , or is that beneath you?
@SunnyWintrovert @jacobkschneider Why? He spoke the truth , the district he is  representing supports a wall , should he not represent his constituents?

@PPVotesIA Is it "safe " for the baby ?
@ActorAaronBooth So you "harden" the points of entry ,then what ? The drug cartels aren't going to simply give up after that , and according to pelosi only half the drugs come thru points of entry meaning the other half is already flowing acrossed the open border

@politico_chris I'm more than happy to sit back and watch the Dems throw money away fighting amongst themselves
@rudnicknoah R Senate seat gain if he wins it, and I think he could
@jamestherabe @TinaLiebling Actually yes , that tax sunsets at the end of this year , so starting in 2020 there is no tax , if you pass a bill to return the tax you are actually raising taxes  , if you fund it with a different tax you are again raising taxes ,

@TinaLiebling Typical B.S from the DFL , every time you lose a penny of taxation it's a crisis

R hold https://t.co/qSWsp2iEBV
@ActorAaronBooth Hogan also has better approval ratings than either Dem senator
@DoresSportsFan @Soaphead @StuPolitics So a three percent difference is OVERWHELMING to you ? Politico/ morning consult poll has it at 47/44 and only 12% believe everything is all fine and dandy at the border ?

@amyklobuchar That's odd I always thought the state of Minnesota controlled the airport , funny I never knew the kloubuchar family owned it
@PoliticalKathy @AOC AOC is actually going to hurt them in the long run , she's out of her depth , plus promising to help primary other Dems she doesn't like is a great way to split a party apart at the seams , I get your overall point and it's true but she is a bad example
@stephenleeham @PardesSeleh Well umm , She's not the one out of touch with reality

@SenhorRaposa I mean if you ignore his racist Obama comment , his pushing thru a bridge that increased his property values , his knowingly lying about Romney's taxes , and  his involvement with Harvey whittmore and coyote springs
@SenhorRaposa I'm actually a fan of representing less people , California Senate should be doubled at the least , a state senator should not represent more than 100k and a state house seat should be under 40k in every state

@chelseahandler When you beat fox for 17 years straight let me know , until then, yawn
@kpconservative Hiring freeze, offer early retirement,  deregulate , start having private business take over for the government  a little at a time as retirements roll in , cut taxes ( both personal and corporate) cut spending
@Alyssa_Milano Wow lmao you really missed on that one
@JakeSherman @rudnicknoah Don young makes congress interesting
@Politics1com @NashvillePost He is only 64 not really a watch list candidate considering there is 100 or so representatives older than him
@dwbeard @DKElections Montana, Arizona and Oregon will probably have to create a competitive ish type district would be my guess and the rest I'm not sure probably one new safe D district in Texas ?
@dwbeard @DKElections Illinois will drop a rural district probably an R lose but definitely could affect the bustos and Underwood seats as well ?
@dwbeard @DKElections Minnesota if it loses one will split the 7th into the 1and 8 seats making both more R friendly so actually a D seat lost
@dwbeard @DKElections The easy ones RI loses a D seat wv and Alabama lose an R seat but the  Sewell seat gets more R and more white as the black belt is the biggest population loser in that state
@TheMidPod @SpeakerRyan Sounds like a state / private business issue , not a federal issue , amtrack already receives about 1.5 billion a year in assistance from the federal government
@StuPolitics Believe it or not , most people are not as politiclly tuned in as you and others here on Twitter and the weather over the holidays is way more important to them
@aamersnow @Fo_Qalif Completely false , if you bothered to educate yourself on this subject you would know that the estimate body count for America of we invaded Japan pushed one million casualties , meanwhile we we're already in Germany when the bomb became available, use knowledge it's helpful
@ActorAaronBooth Or California losing a seat , or Montana not gaining a seat , the California numbers really helped today , Montana not so much , new York and IL are really in trouble
@SenhorRaposa Durbin
@SenhorRaposa Why does Farrakhan still have one , why does the NY State senator who told a staffer to kill herself still have one , Twitter has different rules for different people it seems
@BettyMcCollum04 Ok so your against the wall , what is your plan to stop the illegal flow across the border? Do you even have one or do you support total open borders? Your district deserves to know

@peterdaou Imagine being a political party that has to flat out lie to the public about their healthcare bill in order to get public support to pass it , and then tell all other politicans to pass the bill then you can read the bill ?

@ClaraSorrenti Nice , if you completely ingnore all the ethnic cleansing and political purging that Stalin did , which by the way killed more people than Hitler's government
@realHudsonMD @GayRepublicSwag Can you charge a hate crime on a parent against their children ? Maybe in this case but child neglect, child endangerment and manslaughter  is more realistic, how do you know the parents are openly white nationalist?
@LAMB444 Has anyone seen that 2500$ a year in savings the Dems promised us ?
@KandiRider @HouseJudiciary Would not put it past a new York Democrat to do that
@amyklobuchar Might wanna talk to the Democrat governor of north Carolina also the if your going to point fingers , as he vetoed a bill for the ballot amendment that the voters overwhelmingly appoved

@SenhorRaposa Coleman has already filed with the fec  to run again in 2020
@RalstonReports Well the Democrats  and Obama seemed pretty happy to put coal companies out of business
@schoondoggy1979 @AngieCraigMN The reason for that is Minnesota kicked 550 million dollars over to the insurance companies to cover the rising costs , and the reinsurance program is currently only funded for two years ,
@AngieCraigMN Meanwhile we are still waiting to save 2500$ a year , like we were promised , we are still waiting to be able to keep our old plans , like we were promised , the ACA is severly flawed and sold on a pack of lies  and only a gullible partisan hack would disagree ,
Another Dem governor suppressing the will of the people , ballot amendment voted on by the people passed Dem governor vetoes it #nc #ncgov #ncsen #voterID https://t.co/mp5mwqgOdX

@deanbphillips The moral test of a parent is to never put your child in  a life threatening situation , from the npr article this child died at a hospital ,was only briefly at a detention facility , but you know narrative and political shots and all that
@BogeyGuyC @RepJerryNadler @StockScout1 @DHSgov @HouseJudiciary Why drag the parents all the way to hauge , we can convict them here
@ralph_starling @RepJerryNadler @tracy_rabon @DHSgov @HouseJudiciary How about her parents ? It's all on them
@RepJerryNadler @DHSgov @HouseJudiciary So find the child's parents and arrest them for child neglect , child endangered and manslaughter , , then set up deterrent policy's so other parents don't put the lives of their children in danger ,
@thecjpearson Good thing I grow my own supply of sweet corn

@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Typical liberal afraid of free opinions
@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence But you have shown your low moral character ,
@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence You haven't proven anything but a lack of understanding
@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Ahh typical liberal , name calling when you cant prove a point lol
@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Not even remotely
@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence I would say the workers know more about what is best for them and they should be listened to
@HandleOfRy @PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Based on what exactly?
@c_deleo @BarbaraGalecki @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence If that theory works for one it will work for the other , the theory is the same , so should the outrage unless your a political hypocrite
@DemocraticLuntz @DrewSutton20 @SenhorRaposa Do they still comply with VRA?
@BarbaraGalecki @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence So when the Democrats in Washington DC voted to repeal the minimum wage increase there after it passed on the ballot , we should vote out all Democrats?
@PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Actually it does make them smart , more likely to do their own independent research ,
@PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Also the highest educated parts of DC ,
@PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence I suppose the seven other council members who also voted for repeal and the mayor are all full of shit also ?
@PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence So your just going to believe what fits your personal narrative and to hell with facts , got it ,
@PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Would you rather believe a Democrat Washington DC council member ? https://t.co/aKJ1axfnO2
@G_Therk @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence A majority of the city forced something on to people who didn't want it , and your proud of that ?
@PhilPerspective @JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Yep I'm a shrill for doing actual research into the group of people it will most affect https://t.co/0JDTAhhsNS
@WullimanDebbie @Bencjacobs Politics ebbs and flows , your going to be very dissappointed when Dems lose the house majority again at some point, and they will
@JonEHecht @muhmentions @ndrew_lawrence Unfamiliar with the Michigan bill/ initiative, but if it's anything like the  Washington DC one , we should remember that a majority of tipped workers were against that minimum wage increase
@WullimanDebbie Really? And your proof to your claim  is what exactly ? You have none, now  grow up and live in the real world
@Bencjacobs @rudnicknoah Gotta love all the Dems complaining that a politican is actually keeping his word, and actually representing his district
@WullimanDebbie @Bencjacobs Please do , I'd love to have a republican back in that seat
@Tommy8668 @Bencjacobs Yes please do primary him with a far left zealot , I'd love for a republican to have that seat
@ginammack @Bencjacobs You do know he repeatedly said he wouldn't vote for her ,
@Politics1com And that's the problem with a lot of Democrats right now, if they lose ( even to another Dem ) it's because of an ism, racism, sexism, ageism etc etc ... The interparty fight among house Dems is going to be fun
@amyklobuchar As long as it has national voter ID as well
@hipodrome @marymichelgreen @HouseBlueDogs @RepOHalleran @RepStephMurphy @RepLouCorrea @repjimcooper @RepSchneider @RepSchrader @RepCuellar @RepJoshG @RepJimCosta @RepLipinski Actually it should it's already money earned , and only selfish Democrats would enjoy taxing a family who just buried a loved one , take a farm away from sons and daughters , a business away from a family , but you get your "tax the rich " propaganda, so it's all good
@PamelaGrow @STEPHMHAMILL For context , what were those numbers in 2010 when Democrats had controlled Mississippi for decades ?
@marymichelgreen @HouseBlueDogs @RepOHalleran @RepStephMurphy @RepLouCorrea @repjimcooper @RepSchneider @RepSchrader @RepCuellar @RepJoshG @RepJimCosta @RepLipinski Actually repeal the estate tax totally , it's a double taxation and should be illeagal
@ehnottooxabi @bossbose @ColeDaubney @GHopkinsUSA @ruckus2 @Call_Me_Dutch It's against the law for an illinois resident to buy a gun in Indiana and bring it into illinois, funny how criminals don't follow the law
@mcimaps As a Minnesotan and non liberal , I like her , she can win moderates, especially suburban moderate voters, only question I  have , does she have the mean streak/ fiery attitude needed at times to stand out in prez primary's/ general election?
@RecoveringPolAd @JahanaHayesCT Not triggered , just won't put it with your race baiting bullshit
@Redistrict Minnesota is historically a high turnout state , so no real surprise  with three top ten districts
@RecoveringPolAd @JahanaHayesCT https://t.co/pqfEW1Hfxn
@RecoveringPolAd @JahanaHayesCT Yep that 100$ donation to John James , 25$ each to Eddie Edwards , Mia love , will Hurd and Willie billups , and 10$ to Liz matoy must really mean I don't want African Americans in politics but by your logic that must mean a whole lot of Dems don't want African Americans elected
@andrew_striedl My top donation spot was mn-08 and he won , my second was mn01 and he won, my third was ca16 and she lost
@RecoveringPolAd @JahanaHayesCT https://t.co/b2GDSaNHHX
@RecoveringPolAd @JahanaHayesCT https://t.co/M3NM3lEZ4C
@JahanaHayesCT So your very first vote will be a broken promise vote , nice way to start ,
@rudnicknoah I'd still go Chicago exurbs , the economic policy's of state Dems is running the state broke , one of two things will eventually happen , either people leave the state en mass or they will start to change their voting habits in the hopes of economic growth
@politicsluo Interesting how 01 has went from a less than 1% win in 2012 to the third most republican district in 18
@JenniferJJacobs @RRHElections @JohnJamesMI Need James to run for office in Michigan in 2020 house or Senate
@IlhanMN Seeking aslylum is legal , but it doesn't mean we have to give  it to them , plus throwing rocks and bricks at border agents is illegal, so is bull rushing the border en mass in an attempt to violate are immigration laws
@redsteeze @CyndeVita A sitting US senator should know that border patrol agents have the right to defend themselves from harm , you can't be that stupid or uninformed
@KB805 @BetoORourke I didn't say anything about asylum, go to the us embassy and apply for a Visa
@BetoORourke Well she should of went to the US embassy in her home country and applied LEAGALLY
@deanbphillips Yep so horrifying that mexico  is now deporting them for "violent" and "illegal" actions , wake up people , Dean Phillips and the Dems are using illegal immigrants as a political stunt https://t.co/bC0Jq0soFZ

@mcimaps Well someone named Christina Alexandria Olivia filed a statement of organization with the fec today to run in fl23 as a Democrat, so it looks like DWS will get a primary again

@jmatta27 @maggiekb1 Old timers love their head cheese , it's very  common in central MN

@RepJoeKennedy So no due process and kangaroo courts is what your advocating for
@andrew_striedl Whole partially true that Rs need more Latino votes nationwide , Florida is a little different with right leaning Cuban voters , whose numbers you won't find in any other  state
@epmurphymn So an area run by the Democrat party for many many years and this is where we are at ?
@TinaSmithMN Bye bye small business, and hello automated fast food

@kylegriffin1 @ActorAaronBooth Voter ID should be mandatory nation wide , it's more popular than progressives want to believe , Arkansas just put it on the ballot for the voters to decide , 79% voted for it

@nathanlgonzales I'd go to 500 seats for 2020 census,
@NateSilver538 Now do a map of the last governor races, yes it's actually meaningless but so is this map as far as relationship to a presidential election
@AMErikaNGIRL07 @cs00582scs He needs to learn how to craddle the football , bad bad fundamentals
@JessicaHuseman Too late I'm afraid, I don't believe their has been any fraud,severe incompetents in Broward county yes,but starting with Dems claiming a rigged election in16 and now Rs claiming fraud in18 we will need better election process transparency in the future , plus count votes faster
In today's #election2020 fec filling news , we have a statement of organization from Kathryn Allen D in  #ut03
@ActorAaronBooth It's true in the political world that no one is ever officially retired but he did just put that statement out this week
@ActorAaronBooth Davis already came out and said he's not running for anything 2020, hickenlooper is probably looking at a presidential run
@AndrewSolender @SenhorRaposa Voted for horn but I think with a trifecta government in Illinois again this will push IL14 back to the right and Underwood will go down
#Election2020 https://t.co/1CnRyKFq2Q
@mcimaps I think every one can agree from both politican sides ,  that Snipes needs to go ,  yes incompetent and criminal are completely different things , but incompetent is a valid reason to get fired from your job

@donnabmn @Chrissygreen12 The DFL isn't interested in helping or representing rural MN , we've know this for awhile now
@EsotericCD As a lifelong twins fan I know my yes vote is a biased view but still what he did as a catcher is pretty amazing
@ABCPolitics He's the only Dem I've seen so far say anything about being transparent
@GwenGraham How many times has Broward county and miss Snipes violated election law ? Maybe you should be focused on election integrity instead of party line rhetoric https://t.co/ebO3jHQY7R
@ThisBurnsForYou @Zeon45 @GwenGraham Miami Dade and all other counties can manage to do it , why can't Broward?
FEC fillings today 	Statement of organization by Dana balter in #ny24 possible setting up a rematch with katko	Statement of candidacy for Colorado senate , Lorena Garcia D	And a republican , Alex toulume with a statement of candidacy for #fl14 Kathy castor's district

@Daniel_Sweeney @mcimaps Is this normal? https://t.co/z60EIMKH8c
@SenhorRaposa Yeah wexton is definitely safe
@ActorAaronBooth More than a handful will vote against her ( she will still be speaker) quite a few freshman Dems openly said they won't vote for her , they won't go back on their promise on the very first official vote
@noahpransky Openly breaking election law is illegal and fraudulent https://t.co/6PSQlaS17R
@amyklobuchar Counting every vote is one thing counting them correctly and legally is what is worrisome, Broward county has been hot with election violations numerous times , funny how you failed to mention that fact https://t.co/06cMJCcc41
@thedailybeast @BernieSanders @AndrewGillum @staceyabrams So then it must also be true that racist Democrats voted to keep John James out of the Senate ?
@rivercityleo @Nate_Cohn @JMilesColeman @SenhorRaposa Duluth is holding steady for team blue yet , the iron range and the rural areas are swinging to the right hard and fast , Itasca county is one example , voted for trump in 2016 , last time they voted for an R prez was 1928, Itasca on Tuesday voted for stauber by 5%
@andrewdamitio And have a history of breaking election laws , let's not leave that out
@awalkerinLA @rudnicknoah @GavinNewsom Is he going to relax regulations and red tape for building permits ? If not highly unlikely he ever gets close to those numbers
@KamVTV @jpodhoretz And somehow she still has that job ? And she's still corrupt
Wonder if this will be one of those things the new Dem house will investigate? Nah probably not  https://t.co/RkK828UpFX
@SenhorRaposa Honest question, how can you actually trust Brenda Snipes to do things by the book ? She got busted in 2016 for illegally destroying ballots , and today got busted breaking Florida election law again https://t.co/iPpF9Ve18B
@decunningham2 How is Brenda Snipes still in charge after getting busted for illegally destroying ballots in 2016?and now a judge rules against her again this year https://t.co/17vU3uX2xl

@kyledackerman @devin199722 @GeorgeTakei Because the house is for population representation, the Senate is for state representation,
@GeorgeTakei It's funny you didn't mention small population blue states like Vermont , Delaware , Rhode island  new Hampshire, Hawaii, new mexico??? Biased much
@grifter1910 @taniasanchez @pescami @candyperfumeb0y States rights , it's really simple the same logic back then holds true today ,
@DanCrenshawTX Parents love to get that reaction from their kids
@madisongesiotto I hope you reported all of those classless people
So day one of #2020election  and we all ready have  statement of organization for Ds in #MN01  and for Rs in #OK05 also have statement of candidacy from Greg sagen D running again for  #tx13  and a unaffiliated in tn06 and a libertarian in ga13

@AubreyGilleran @decunningham2 @jaynordlinger I'm guessing king either retires ( he's around 70 years old ) or gets beat in a primary
@Kittyseesstars @morganisawizard @_Kambinii @Kesterdaughter Since when is a miscarriage an abortion?
@womensmarch Your organization is run by blatant anti Semite racists, , the biggest accountability needed is within your own organization

@evanchill Well Democrats won more seats than republicans , but narrative and what not
@YourCanadianGF @shellmh @jaketapper Yes it does , it's equal state representation
@shariv53 @YourCanadianGF @jaketapper Rigged system?? How is equal state representation rigged ?
@JHazlette @kkondik The Republican only raised 83k and there was only 25k in outside spending, the Republican party and major republican donor's/ pacs didn't put any money in here

@SUMinnesota @pipergoodgirl @EllisonCampaign @MinnesotaDFL We believe in the metoo movement unless it's a Democrat being accused , good to know , and if you believe that investigation paid for by Dems and investigated by a law firm that donates big $$$$ to Dems , I got ocean front property in Minnesota I'd like to sell you

@ErinMayeQuade And Keith Ellison won't answer for his Louis Farrakhan man crush
@JohnBrennan Considering you actually voted for a member of the communist party before , voting Dem now isn't that big of a stretch for you , the platforms get closer together every year
@epmurphymn @repjohnlewis Not bad moves for a guy a couple months short of 79 years old

@ActorAaronBooth @MNSteveSimon Brandon Evansville is about what I expected , but Johnson winning a school in West St Paul?
@SenhorRaposa @CrassPolitical Stanek definitely would do better in the metro area than stauber ,
@SenhorRaposa @CrassPolitical Housley would run again probably , she is finishing really strong , otherwise Richard stanek could be a solid opponent , maybe stauber pulls a Rosen ?

@ActorAaronBooth I do find it difficult to think that in05 is closer than in09 but who knows ?

@tvkatesnow @NimaCNN Real journalists don't bury a story on a supreme Court nominee during the nomination
@tvkatesnow What you actually mean by "newsworthy" is oh crap grassleys referral is going to out us on our burying the story to help stop kavanaugh ,
@tvkatesnow If this is what you call " being fully transparent" it's no wonder people don't trust the media anymore
@usminority Real friends care about you the person not your political leanings , if they defriend you based on politics , they were never a true friend

@KayaJones @realDonaldTrump Bolsonaro is a strong supporter of gun rights for individuals ,
@SenhorRaposa It does always suprise me that no ambitious Dem  runs a serious primary against this guy , he never has any coh, he's sitting at 50k right now in a totally  uncompetitive general

@DiscordianStooj @jkenley1 @keithellison And "vouched " voting should be replaced with provisional voting , way to easy to illegally vote with vouched voting , and it still takes someone who used an id to register https://t.co/582Phw1rXr
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison I changed voting location when I early voted this year , had to show my I'd , check your own facts
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison https://t.co/q4Yt0W2Azv
@PhilMurphyNJ @BobMenendezNJ You really should sit this one out , unless your endorsing  blatent unethical behavior , bordering on criminal , but I guess that's normal in new Jersey Democrat politicans
@SenhorRaposa My state rep
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison Again , you need an ID to register to vote , you need an ID to same day register, you need an ID if you move and change your polling location, showing an ID when actually voting , is not disenfranchising anyone
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison You need an I'd to register to vote , you need an I'd to same day register, you need an I'd to change your voting location if you move , all are already Minnesota law, why would an I'd to vote disenfranchise anyone when you can't register to vote without one ?
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison We don't need to disenfranchise voters in order to have a system where you prove you are who you say you are , like voter ID , no fake hypothetical needed
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison It's a simple answer , you disenfranchise zero voters with an I'd law , zero
@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison Oh stop with the false excuses , you need an I'd to get into Medicaid , social security benefits , college  and disability benefits , the elderly, disabled and college have zero problems proving they are who they say they are when they need to for benefits
@collinpeterson You did mess up with your straight party line vote against tax cuts tho , we remember that one
@MinnesotaDFL Seriously , sit this one out , unless your admitting you support an accused women abuser,  anti Semite  anti LGBT  Louis Farrakhan supporter , former member of a known hate group , is this what the dfl has become ?

@jkenley1 @DiscordianStooj @keithellison Pay for an I'd? Something you actually need in day to day life ?
@DiscordianStooj @keithellison Need an I'd to buy a gun , second amendment is a constitutional right
@keithellison Nothing anti democratic about voter ID laws , if you can't prove you are who you say you are , you got bigger issues than voting
@hserecording @FiveThirtyEight Simple answer , yes , yes it would of ,
@joeblow745 sounds like your fun to drink with
@jenblueline Touch your nose with your elbow
@PercyChuggs @MaddieWAnderson @joeradinovich 329 million surplus and Dems still crying for a gas tax hike?
@PercyChuggs @MaddieWAnderson @joeradinovich That's because we have a republican controlled state house and Senate , keeping the budget sane
@PercyChuggs @MaddieWAnderson @joeradinovich Ahhh yes let's become the next  Connecticut, Illinois, new Jersey, they are doing awesome right ? Wrong , they are losing population ( tax base) budgets are a mess , low bond ratings , and huge unfunded liabilitys , high taxes does not equal high quality of life
@MaddieWAnderson @deanbphillips Cool ,another 1%er pretending to understand the economics of life the rest of us deal with , must be nice to be able to afford to buy a seat into congress

@juliekiel @bringmethenews Yes in Ellisons own words , Farrakhan has some good things to offer , by the way Farrakhan is a known anti Semite and anti LGBT racist
@KaseyMayer_ I voted in Minnesota yesterday
@kyle_good @MPRnews This is awesome news
@EsotericCD Definitely not a 109, looks iffy on the 190, canopy looks wrong for both models
@SenhorRaposa Also interesting is that Lee muscogee and tiny schley are the only counties with a growth in population since 2010, Lee and schley are strong R muscogee is strong D
@TinaSmithMN @marcorubio Let's talk about those Emily list donations 170k ? https://t.co/A5zoF1tVCD

@CallaghanPeter @ActorAaronBooth Party over people

@ActorAaronBooth Wondering how you can accurately model a state with no party registration?
@ActorAaronBooth My guess , the path to a wardlow win is in moderate Dems probably just skipping that box on the ballot ,

@ChrisNagel_SP @TinaSmithMN Without Obamacare I'd still have my old policy (promise broken) which was a much better policy, without Obamacare I'd be paying less in premium and deductable,( another promise broken),so why should I believe Democrats on health care when they couldn't keep their word last time
@ChrisNagel_SP @TinaSmithMN Housley has always supported not allowing pre existing conditions to kick you out , Smith is lying and spreading a false scare tactic , this quote is from the Duluth news Q and A https://t.co/h81Yekp3FE
@TinaSmithMN False scare tactics , is that what your down to now ? Are you really that scared of housley that you have to dodge a debate and then like about positions?
@TinaSmithMN This is something that would be discussed IF you could be bothered to actually debate housley, pretty easy to talk when there is no counter point
@amyklobuchar @HeidiHeitkamp So Amy , are you now supporting someone who outed sexual assault survivers without their permission ? How very metoo of you , guess your a party over people politican also
@amyklobuchar @HeidiHeitkamp She's down by 16, because she voted party over people
@jenblueline Looking very in shape
@TinaSmithMN @wccoradio @MPRnews To bad you were to scared to do it on TV
@BlairStClair You may need professional help , or just start acting like a reasonable adult
@politicobsessed 1. South Dakota	2. Indiana	3. mn-01	4. MN attorney general
@TinaSmithMN Feeling hopefully would be having karin housley elected as Minnesotas senator
@_alex_joshua Free is a stretch for me but states giving scholarships and or incentives to kids to go to community college / trade schools  something I would be supportive of
@erinhaust Stay at the airport and wait for my flight outta there
@ActorAaronBooth Looking pretty good for Pete stauber if Jeff Johnson and housley both have 10 point leads in northern MN and klobachar has a very small lead there
@WilliamKonkol @TinaSmithMN She should of been debating last night , instead of hiding
@KarinHousley @KarinHousley  put this picture in a TV ad pronto and air it as much as you can , it's a powerful statement
@TinaSmithMN Why bother if your too afraid to debate your positions ? You would have to actually tell the people of Minnesota where you stand , and you can't have that can you
@MinnesotaDFL @Tim_Walz What you really mean is tax the middle class more and more
@TinaSmithMN Maybe just maybe you should of actually showed up for the debate , I guess you were either chicken or scared because you know your ideas won't hold up to debate or post debate scrutiny and fact checking

@amyklobuchar @ericgarcetti @MinnesotaDFL Did you tell garcetti to go fix his city first , Los Angeles has a domestic population net loss of 458k  since 2011 a huge homeless population huge taxes and unaffordable housing / cost of living , are those the ideals you are pushing for Amy ?
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman It is for us to try to understand , if you want your state to prosper and grow you look to things Texas,Arizona, Florida ,Utah and Idaho are doing , if you want stagnation you look to Illinois, Connecticut,New Jersey and California, Minnesota doesn't need to be the next illinois
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman California is at alittle over negititive one million people loss in domestic migration , you don't flee places you love https://t.co/hijE6IuhEy
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman %paid isn't an accurate way of looking at the cost to taxpayes https://t.co/6q2lLQiNiF
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman One trillion in unfunded liability is not thiving,
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman That same governor is also saying that state deficits are coming back
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman I don't have to live there to  know how bad it's being run https://t.co/HEMcQ0nkvq
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman You have to spread that out over 53seats instead of 8 also that's a big difference
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman Bad things happen when your taxes get to high , Connecticut, illinois ,new Jersey and Cali are strong warning signs against what your advocating for
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman California currently sits at seat # 431 MN sits at 437, under this projection we get the last seat and California is one seat out , we also keep the seat if Montana stubbles in growth https://t.co/WH4Cg2x5Qb
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman https://t.co/sMEw87ivcu
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman We have had internals from 01 with no response from the other side , I'm guessing we keep our 8 districts ( just barely) and California loses a seat instead , we are holding steady on pop growth while California is in a decline of growth ( largest domestic migration loss )
@melvincarter3 @ActorAaronBooth @MayorOfLA @ericgarcetti Maybe he should start with the growing homeless epedemic in Los Angeles since he is in charge there
@rivercityleo @kenner116 @politicsluo @JMilesColeman That will change this year 01 and 08 probably flip to red and 07 flips when Peterson retires
@1776Stonewall I disagree , I think it was a few very pissed off Cuban Americans, the Dems don't understand why Barbra Lee would be unwelcome in a Cuban area and tried to bring her in , completely out of touch with the common people
@anniegetyourgui Delaware Senate
@Cincychacha @senorrinhatch @senatemajldr This is someone who doesn't understand context , you don't try to bring Barbra Lee into a Cuban community ,, this was a political rally , not a family dinner out ,
@ActorAaronBooth @MichaelAvenatti Look on the bright side tho , maybe she will stay in it long enough to not be able to drop back down and run for her house seat ?
@AndrewSolender @amyklobuchar @KarinHousley I probably know over  20 of them  just in my circle of family/friends
@mcimaps @UpshotNYT Well I mean , attempting to bring in Barbra Lee in that district ,  someone was not thinking , either pelosi or shalala
@mcimaps Would like to see 07 polled also along with 25
@SenhorRaposa @geoffreyvs @FiveThirtyEight People like the liberal policy's but not the taxes ,so they try to minimize it with split government ,  would be my guess
@reason @miltimore79 A better and more accurate headline would be city politicans pass laws to shut down young entrepreneurs
@leeleeb50 He gives his president salary away , you can hate his policies but that is a good thing , I hope it starts a trend with the next presidents that come after him
@cas4498 @TinaSmithMN It's way higher than that , nice try tho
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Lie
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Desperate attempt ? Disprove one thing , was he a member of the nation of Islam? Did he mislead on his relationship with Farrakhan ( remember now Farrakhan admits he has met privately with Ellison ) two women have accused him of abuse , where exactly did I like?
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow And you already proved you absolutely would mock your constituents , I gave all proven facts and you flat out called me a liar , I gave all facts and you claimed it as a smear ,
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Same with infastucture , people support upgrades but not a massive tax hole to accomplish it
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow People support the idea of those things, not the funding , if people actually supported Dems medicade for all and the price tag , it would already be law in Vermont, California and Colorado, but once the price tag came out the political will all died
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Here's Ellisons buddy at it again https://t.co/sHRYP9yewX
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow The hypocrisy is thinking you can represent a district that over 60% doesn't agree with your political positions , how do you think you would represent a heavily republican district with left wing ideas  ? You don't have a middle of the road platform like a Collin Peterson
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow https://t.co/snaz2Rh3Ax
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Really , so I'll assume you have spoken out against Kieth Ellison , Tony Cardenes , bill Clinton , Al franken , Archie Parnell , and many other Dems ? Oh wait you haven't , so your just using this for partisan reasons , that's how it works according to you
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow She represents the vast majority, it's a heavily republican district , you should know that by now
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow So your not going to deny any of those things then , but yet you call me a liar ?
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Facts are not conspiracy theories,
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow It's funny I haven't lied about one single thing , but you have , is this how you would of represented this area in the state Senate , with extreme  partisan bias ?
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Funny kavanaugh was accused with much much much less evidence and you and the left are ready to convict him , but when it's Ellison, Tony Cardenes , Archie Parnell, Gil ciseros, it's all a conspiracy and untrue ,
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Instead of trying to change the subject do you deny that Ellison was a member of the nation of Islam?Do you deny that the nation of Islam has been deemed a hate group?Do you deny that Ellison has mislead on his relationship with Farrakhan?Do you deny that Farrakhan is a racist ?
@TinaSmithMN That's funny , I'm not a billionaire , I'm not a millionaire either and I got a nice tax cut that increased my take home pay ,
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow Fact, two women have accused Ellison of abuse , fact the nation of Islam is deemed a hate group by the southern poverty law center, fact Ellison was/ is a member , fact Ellison repeatedly mislead on his relationship with racist Louis Farrakhan, are those are your values? https://t.co/0VlUfp2H3n
@OOOlson @doug_wardlow So you want a women abuser,  "former "member of a hate group , and supporter of the very  racist Louis Farrakhan as the attorney general of Minnesota ,  that's what you get with if you support Ellison , are you saying those are Alexandria values ? Are those your values?

@TinaSmithMN And they want the bailout without making cuts or changing how the pension is run , so basically we the taxpayers will have to give them another multi billion dollar bailout before 2030,
@TinaSmithMN So you want to do something before the GAO has finished it's investigations into the unions handling of the fund ? Also the union says it needs 11billion, yes billion dollars from congress( what they mean to say is steal from non union taxpayers) to make it solvent
@politicsluo His fav/ unfav numbers are terrible
@Cernovich @jetrotter It's a metoo movement only when it's politiclly advantageous
@rynofied @KashChicago @MaryAnnAhernNBC @JulianaforLG So, Illinois is on the worst financial shape in America , an honor it held before rauner , your  losing population faster than any other state , already high taxes , high crime rate , maybe just maybe you might want to not make the same mistakes over and over again  when voting
@mcimaps That's alot of money to be throwing at what should of been a safe seat when you are on defense in most of the rest of the Senate map and fighting to be majority instead of minority, they wouldn't spend it if they didn't see an actual danger to that seat ,

@JustinPerpich @MaddieWAnderson @NRCC @PeteStauber I'd say your candidate getting triaged is worse news , and Ellison's divorce records being released tomorrow will possibly ( could be a nothing  also) drown out all other political news for the rest of the week , also cook moved #mn08  to lean R today ,
@SenhorRaposa I think the state party might try to push wexton thru instead

@sylvie41239272 @MinnesotaDFL I said it was hypocritical of the dfl to post that  when they endoresed Ellison

@PunkRockPoddle @jaketapper You must be talking about Ruth bader Ginsburg
@sylvie41239272 @MinnesotaDFL What is easy to prove is Keith Ellisons association with racist Louis Farrakhan and the nation of Islam , deemed a hate group by the southern poverty law center,  for it's anti Jewish and anti LGBT rhetoric, https://t.co/AN1Cue1Fff
@AngieCraigMN Not a single actual reform was mentioned in that ad , typical, lots of rah rah and no actual plan or ideas
@keithellison We need nationwide voter ID legislation passed
@MinnesotaDFL Pretty hypocritical coming from the party that endoresed Keith Ellison
@PardesSeleh Nah , Warren is the one who claimed native American heritage to get a high paying Harvard job , that's on her

#MnAg https://t.co/pISwBxb7bW

@AngieCraigMN @pipergoodgirl @RepJasonLewis If we let Democrats control the government , most of us won't be able to afford healthcare no matter how many hours or years we work, did we already forget about the massive premium increases that came with Obamacare,anyone seen that 2500$ in savings yet? Can I have my plan back
@EsotericCD Brian Dozier is the only dodger I want to succeed
@AsmMarcBerman @asmMelendez Wonder if Mark has any thoughts on the sexual harassment accusations against Tony Cardenes ? Or the dangerous rhetoric of Maxine Waters?
@stillhere_AZ @ActorAaronBooth I'd wait till Monday, when Ellison's currently sealed divorce records become unsealed and  go public before making  that claim ,

@SenhorRaposa Just curious on this one , how would it work if Mitch McConnell became president, would his wife have to resign or is she ok because someone else appointed her ?
@JMilesColeman Kinda amazing what Collin Peterson has been able to pull the  last couple cycle's , gotta know your district really well
@ChazNuttycombe Jeff Johnson 61%	Klobachar 52%	Housley 56%	Dave Hughes 52%

@govtrack Unless the state is screwing up so bad that they are thinking about suspending the program , as many as 1500 non citizens may have been registered to vote in the federal June primary's , 23000 voter registration errors ?  Whatever that means https://t.co/WGNQ5kbz9l
@BBaillie17 @NaomiLevinNY @TheLastRefuge2 Everything has a cost , you are charged one way or another , nothing is free

@ChrisNagel_SP @BetteMidler It's private info , if people are pushing for it to be released, they should release theirs in advance
And we have our first contender in #lagov https://t.co/FqZ5AJz2lc
@ChrisNagel_SP @BetteMidler You do know it's not mandatory , you can choose not to .
@BetteMidler I've never released mine to the public either , what's your point here ? Have you released your tax returns to the public ?
@ErinMayeQuade At what cost ?? Nothing is free
@SenSanders That's funny , I'm definitely not donor class and I'm benefiting from the tax cuts
@KaitMarieox I hope your reporting these weirdo's
@pipergoodgirl @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump This doesn't even make sense

@PhoenixWomanMN @GingerLovelyMUA @williamjordann @ForQ2 Right , vote for the party that abandoned farmers and the rural area along time ago now ,  because trump is doing something that farmers have wanted a president to do for jalong time now , don't forget agriculture just got a big boost with redoing trade with Canada

@ActorAaronBooth How the heck did he become speaker , I know Rhode island has a bit of a moderate twist at the state level but wow
@ActorAaronBooth Any idea why the speaker of the house is so unpopular , only 22% approval by Dems , he actually does a little better with Indy's and RS.?
@Shabbosgoy As an outstate Minnesotan,  I don't
@EsotericCD @B_M_Finnigan The most interesting part of that poll was that most voters would still vote for Hogan even if he had a R majority in state legislation, and he's killing jealous with who do you trust  on economy and taxes

@pipergoodgirl @Brasilmagic And I can put up 100 different #walkaway stories , answer the question is Keith Ellison , Angie craig  and Tina Smith against women ? They both support accused women abuser Keith Ellison?
@pipergoodgirl @Brasilmagic Keith Ellison is accused of the same things as kavanaugh , does Ellison not  support women's rights ? Tina Smith endoresed Ellison , does Tina Smith not support women's rights ?
@GeorgiaLogCabin There really isn't a tax Democrats don't like and approve of

@sfpathe Mn08??
@TinaSmithMN @pipergoodgirl I would venture to say planned Parenthood is a special interest group and you seem pretty tied to the hip with that one , would you vote against pp if the majority of Minnesota wanted you too ? I'm highly doubtful
#ky02 Guthrie for congress in Q3 sent 1000$ to 33 different republicans in house races
Davidson for congress spent 23k for a poll this quarter on Aug 3 later that moth he sent 6k to Ohio republican party and started sending out political contributions, I think he liked his poll numbers #oh08
#az08 a couple confusing things in hiral for congress Q3 report , she paid for three polls and paid much less each time 20k for 8-9 poll, 7600 on 9-6 and 4600 on 9-20, also she sent 116k in transfers to state party committee?

@WardDPatrick @Stella_Basham1 @SteveDaines Looks like a very proud dad and happy daughter, congrats to both of them
@Alyssa_Milano Let me know when you start protesting Keith Ellison?
@Alyssa_Milano You should be terrified, the five justices that you hate believe in the rules of law , following the Constitution and common sense , what they don't do is legislate from the bench , that's what liberals do
@mcimaps I think it would help manchin ,tho he's probably going to be ok now after his vote
@politicsluo Minnesotas captain Jack sparrow is still my favorite politicans name , runner up is Elvis pressly
@SenBlumenthal The only thing dangerous and deeply flawed was how you and your party handled this confirmation process,
@carla_spalding Nothing brings conservatives together more than an open scotus seat

@704heather @PhilScott4VT @JohnKasich @DougJones @timkaine @SpeakerBoehner @JoeBiden Don young , he must have some great, crazy stories, 	Bush jr, I think he'd be pretty funny in a personal setting 	Amy klobachar because she's a huge Vikings fan 	And Jackie speier , I really want to hear a first hand account of the jonestown incident
@TinaSmithMN That's funny as my local paper just endorsed your opponent
@susmurphy @Redistrict @Susan_Hennessey Then you missed the entire point of his tweet , NY Senate race is a given Dem win , north Dakota , Missouri, Montana , west Virginia , those states are not like your city and their veiws differ from what you see and hear , and those are the important toss up Senate races
@gelliottmorris Disagree with number one , it's a state issue , federal government needs to stay out of it , # 2 disagree , cede D.C back to Maryland where it came from , # 3 I agree , we are approaching one million people per district , way to high a number for local representation
@jtempkin @ahalavais @gelliottmorris @george_gone And invites potentially massive backlash
@SenhorRaposa @il_american Virgina already retrocessioned their land back in 1846

@nathanlgonzales I do think that you might be missing a possible surprise district also in mn-07 ,
@JRAWEsq @DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom 36% conservative 25% liberal , I actually do study politics  and trends and elections  and it is by no means completely accepted fact https://t.co/q2WiFt28b0
@JRAWEsq @DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom Gallup polls 2017 , I'm wondering where you get your "facts" https://t.co/WnZiqitDxn
@JRAWEsq @DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom It's far from accepted fact , maybe in your bubble of friends it is
@JRAWEsq @mellomelsko @DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom Using your very words " nice comeback, devoid of any factual content " but whatever gets you thru the day , right?
@JimSimonson @mgroff @kevincramer @trumps_feed Is that your best argument to back up your previous statement?
@JRAWEsq @mellomelsko @DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom Still haven't answered my question?
@JRAWEsq @DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom , you can't gerrymander a governor election or any statewide election ,and republicans hold more of those seats , second if as you say the "vast majority" are liberal I'd love to hear you explain why there are very popular republican governors in MA, vt, Maryland and nh?
@mgroff @JimSimonson @kevincramer @trumps_feed Is that all ya got lol
@mgroff @JimSimonson @kevincramer @trumps_feed I can do this all day , and the only reason new York just barely has it's head above water financially , unlike other blue states like illinois, Connecticut and new Jersey is because the IDC has kept progressive policy's at Bay , but it sounds that that is coming to an end https://t.co/uZ1B9QRGyp
@DavidPerlman @RadioFreeTom Will of the American people ? Last I checked republicans have the white house , Senate, house of reps , have been elected to more governor seats , control more state legislators, I think the "will" of the people have been speaking at the ballot box .
@JessicaValenti Liberal women have already forgotten about bill Clinton , Al franken, Keith Ellison, Tony Cardenes, Archie Parnell, Tom carper , sherrod brown , harvy wienstien and many more
@SenDougJones If you really wanted to bridge that " divide"  you could start by voting to represent your state and vote for the majority which would be a yes on kavanaugh , but instead you choose party over people and voted no , why ?
@ActorAaronBooth I actually think the winner of the Houston / Cleveland series beats Boston and or new York,

@mgroff @kevincramer @trumps_feed Frame it however your bias wants to , but poll after poll show support for kavanaugh in the majority in North Dakota , your new York bubble ,group think, is not the same way the people of north Dakota look at things
@morristmurray @kevincramer She voted against the majority of her state , she was elected to represent that state , we actually need less partisan politicans and more who are reprensetive of the people they are supposed to serve
@kathygriffin @TomiLahren @KayaJones Just admit your scared and not up to their intelligence level
@KirstenPowers @TheMidPod @HeidiHeitkamp Leadership would be being a representative of the state that elected you , that's not what she is doing
@Jinxy_Minxy @politicoalex @NRSC Yes I read it , her personal feeling doesn't change the fact that she is not representing the majority of her constituents, I.E she's not doing her job
@Jinxy_Minxy @politicoalex @NRSC Because she was elected to represent north Dakota, how can you say your representative of your state when you vote against what the majority of the state wants
@Jinxy_Minxy @politicoalex @NRSC She's not elected to vote her conscience, she's elected to vote the will of the people of north Dakota , and a majority of them want kavanaugh confirmed
@saieedkhalil @politicoalex She just announced that she's voting against what the majority of people in her state want

@TinaSmithMN @realDonaldTrump As a us senator , it would do you well to remember that 46% of the state voted for him , your job is to represent ALL of Minnesota , and your job should be to be for unity , not promoting more divisions among those you represent , otherwise you and trump are one in the same

@stemcell2000 @HotlineJosh @SykesCharlie Yeah it actually has a .6 Democrat bias in it's poll history, and an A rating , but you do you https://t.co/J8k0141KyO
@ElectionBabe Model your same day registration after the Minnesota system , it works very well , the only thing I'd do different in Minnesota is have voter ID
@happyfestivus @HotlineJosh Seriously go look at their rating on 538 , go ask someone who follows polls , fox is a solid polling firm , you don't see ant election experts disregard fox polls , they take them seriously
@ActorAaronBooth @billpostmus True to a point , 100k spending in North Dakota would equal what in Texas ? One million, two million, on airtime and coverage?? You don't really need to spend 10 million in North Dakota to get your message out and be heard
@happyfestivus @HotlineJosh Yeah check fox poll ratings at 538 , or ask any political experts , fox polls are well regarded
@stemcell2000 @HotlineJosh @SykesCharlie Fox polls really is  highly regarded by the political experts ,check around for yourself , look up their poll rating at 538, just because it has fox in the name doesn't make it a junk poll
Wow https://t.co/wr0QgUcDTH
@SenhorRaposa They absolutely do
@saieedkhalil @SenhorRaposa Some people don't want the government in control of anything , especially health care , some people believe you go out and earn a good wage , not a government mandated one ,

@NateSilver538 Yep got burned on that once last cycle , it's a humble pie experience
@FrancoIKU @dfriedman33 @alittlebitroyal If he votes no conservative and independent voters will vote against him and he will definitely  lose , manchin can't win on just the Dem base on West Virginia

@ChiProgGo @soledadobrien Your female bartender is full of bullshit
@SenatorHeitkamp Support for kavanaugh is 56-26 in your state and women support kavanaugh 50-29 according to the Reuters article today , why are you still uncommitted on your vote ? Do you represent north Dakota or are you a Schumer and durbin puppet ?
@Stowydad @meeksgop Well at least they admit that they don't think they can be fully impartial in their investigation, I'll give them credit there
@SenSanders Does that include Keith Ellison's accusser ? Tony Cardenes accusser? Archie parrnell?
@seungminkim Latest polls has support for kavanaugh at 56-26 in North Dakota , women support kavanaugh by 50-29 in North Dakota , heitkamp either says goodbye to getting reelected by voting against her state or votes yes on kavanaugh and supports  the people of her state

@Alyssa_Milano Do you support men sexually abusing women ?
@joeradinovich @BarackObama Obama tried to economicly destroy that entire region , openly celebrating that endorsement shows how  you will be just another party line vote ,

@ChrisNagel_SP @mngopchairwoman If any of them had any real proof I guarantee the left would have  investigated them nine different ways , consentual sex with a porn star is not an allegation of anything and not even close to on the same level as physical and mental abuse
@rudnicknoah Close to 56% voted against him in utah in 2016 so it's not much different now than two years ago
@ChrisNagel_SP @kenmartin73 @mngopchairwoman Again , when is the independent investigation going to start ? Because it hasn't yet , why do you think every house member accused of something is very willing to have a house ethics investigation , the same committee that paid out millions in settlements and won't release why
@ChrisNagel_SP @kenmartin73 @mngopchairwoman Let me know when that independent investigation actually starts ? A house ethics investigation led by Democrat lawyers is where investigations go to be buried
@BruneElections Hungary
@kenmartin73 @mngopchairwoman Do you still support Keith Ellison, why are all your candidates afraid to release a statement on Keith Ellisons alleged abusive actions against multiple women ??
@epmurphymn @TheRealDratch @SenAmyKlobuchar And where is her powerful voice against Keith Ellisons actions ??.
@kathygriffin @AriFleischer Typical response from the "tolerant" "all inclusive" left , when you don't have an intelligent, fact based response , name call and use vulgar language, playbook 101 of the left
@Oydeedoydeedoy @molratty @Phillipburton Voters also decided on scotus , we voted for president and Senate , this is a bad take in many ways , senator is not local , it's statewide and the funding for Beto is Nationwide , the same people calling kavanaugh a college drunk , are donating big$$$ to drunk driving beto
@CarolLeonnig So first the left tries to discredit the process, didn't work , then tries to discredit the nominee, didn't work, now your trying to discredit the institution, that won't work either ,
@PoliticsWolf @rudnicknoah So what you really want to do is drown out the rural vote as much as possible in three of the district to make them more D friendly and vote sink the fourth ? Yep sounds "nonpartisan"

@ActorAaronBooth Donnelly votes with manchin and heitkamp quite a bit also, and if sinema wins in Arizona does she keep her moderate track and join that group?
@SenhorRaposa Capito, fischer and Hyde Smith won't face any significant backlash in their home states for voting yes , I'd argue they would face a stronger backlash by voting no
@MplsMe @deanbphillips Might wanna clean up your side before throwing stones in a glass house
@MplsMe @deanbphillips If the Dems actually cared about it ,bill Clinton wouldn't of been president , and Hillary , who said completely awful things about Bills accuser's would of never won a presidential primary ,
@JediSlasher @deanbphillips It's not one or the other , both are happening at the same time , Ellison is running for attorney general, the allegations are the same , Dems call kavanaugh unfit yet ,Tina Smith ,mark Dayton, ken martin and the dfl endorsed Ellison , that is being a hypocrite
@MplsMe @deanbphillips Your response and the entire lefts response is also completely politcally motivated , the left doesn't care about the allegations, they only want to stop the confirmation any way the can , if they actually cared about abuse , Keith Ellison, Tony Cardenes, wouldn't be running
@SenhorRaposa There are alot of good choices on the Dem side , she is not one of them , but i would love to see her out of the Senate also
@JediSlasher @deanbphillips Don't be a hypocrite and make alot of noise about one person and be silent on another when they are accused of the same thing , that's the Clinton playbook.... Keith Ellison , Tony Cardenes , bill Clinton, Archie Parnell

#akgov https://t.co/Yb9hAESruz
@TinaSmithMN Yet you endorsed and support Keith Ellison? You have zero moral standing and zero credibility when you support one and oppose the other
@amyklobuchar Any comments on Keith Ellison yet ???
@ActorAaronBooth Tina Smith is openly supporting and endorsing Kieth Ellison while condemning judge kavanaugh , hypocrisy is on both sides of the race here
@MplsMe @loganlife14 @deanbphillips House ethics committee and the FBI are completely different , let's talk if Ellison asks the FBI to investigate him
@loganlife14 @deanbphillips You actually think requesting a house ethics investigation is egual to asking for an FBI investigation , the house ethics committee is where investigations go to die , it's also the same place that has paid out millions in secret settlements without disclosure
@deanbphillips And your statement on Keith Ellison is where?
@SenKamalaHarris Lucky you , most of us working class chumps would get fired immediately if we walked out of a work meeting, yet your still getting paid for not being at work
@DougJones @Zachary_Cohen You don't like your job very much do you , you really only have one job , to represent the people of Alabama , your not representing the majority by voting no
@TinaSmithMN And yet you endorsed Keith Ellison , kinda makes you a hypocrite
@StarTribune Now question Keith Ellison
@GailKulp_MN And your statement saying Keith Ellison is unfit to serve is where?
@RepMarkTakano @SenateGOP If you were a teacher , you should know the part about innocent until proven guilty , unless you were more about indoctrination than actually teaching?
@mariashriver Considering your family member left a women trapped in a car to drown , you might want to skip this
@elainaplott Corker came out as a yes tonight
#mnsen #MNAG https://t.co/Wdd54OwV6F
#az04 those family attack ads are helping Paul gosar, bit of a mistake by team blue https://t.co/S9vbj4vlRK
@SenhorRaposa Plus the difference between Colorado and Virgina is that Colorado has some strong red areas that are not moving left at all , most of Virgina except for the very rural areas are moving left , some faster than others but a majority of the state seems to be moving left
@SenhorRaposa This is Colorado prez voting , while it's true R numbers dropped a good bit in 16 , D numbers didn't pick up the lost R votes , Clinton only did 1.2% better than Dems did in 2004 , I'd like to see a better upward trend to say it's off the board , https://t.co/LH872Pwexj
@SenhorRaposa I agree with Virgina , it's moving to the left like west Virginia and Arkansas moved right , I'm not sold on Colorado being off the table for the foreseeable future tho
@NotEricWagner Bring back the half penny
@allakecla Get the pic blown up so you can make out the license plate number and turn them in
@naxalite I'm sure Keith Ellison beating up his girlfriends is ok to you ?
@DunbarConstance @ElizabethHeng Maybe fund it so the working class , middle class and low income people are not getting a huge regrssive tax levied on them,a proper way would have it come out of the general fund , supplemented by drivers license and car licence renewal funds , plus the current existing gas tax
Wow, Bernie Thompson's #ms02  congressional district has lost 33 thousand people since 2010, while the state of #Mississippi  has gained population as a whole
@AinsleyBBrown Now do Keith Ellison, Tony Cardenes, Archie parnell
@LauraHennesse11 @senorrinhatch @charlescwcooke @GOP Ok now let's talk about how the Dems have handled Keith Ellison, Tony Cardenes, Archie Parnell ,Tom carper and sherrod brown ??
@TinaSmithMN We need voter ID , get it done
@SenhorRaposa Why? At this point her story is going backwards , I'd actually be surprised if she shows up to testify, there is more evidence against Keith Ellison and he's not stepping aside https://t.co/v8el63cRzb
@ActorAaronBooth Pureval is getting hit with ethics violations and he's not responding to them well ,
@bigwormser @ElectBergmann If everyone who liked this could donate 5 bucks to her , that would go a long way to help get her message out

@EsotericCD I used to be a Bud light / Busch light drinker , then I was introduced to micro/ craft/ specialty brews and I haven't looked back , but I'm also a cheap ass and won't pass up anything free
@politicsluo Depends on how you actually define red district , mn07
@RepJoeKennedy Now let's talk about Keith Ellison?? Why so silent on that one
@Celticlassy10 @1776CC Hmm , senator Tina Smith , gov mark Dayton , Dem state party chair and Dem state party , all endoresed Keith Ellison after the allegations , move on. Org also just this week endorsed him , wanna come again about what and who your party believes??
@StopTrump2020 @GOP Now do Keith Ellison, Tony Cardenes , Archie Parnell , Tom carper
@CheriBustos @JBPritzker It's pretty hard to create jobs in high tax states that are bleeding population, plus don't forget about that 130 billion in unfunded pension liability that has to be paid eventually
@CheriBustos @BruceRauner You mean the things state Dems blocked at the house and Senate levels ? Meanwhile your state is  continuing to head towards bankruptcy, you don't have the funds to pay for your state pension , people are leaving the state in droves because of high taxes and crime
@ValerieJarrett And your statement supporting Keith Ellison's accuser is where exactly???
@Celticlassy10 @1776CC Keith Ellison , Tony Cardenes , Archie Parnell, Tom carper., Sherod brown , bill clinton
#FL27 https://t.co/TA4RwaMJoo
@PiperPerabo I'm sure your supporting Keith Ellison's accuser also , right?
@SenSchumer And you will be asking Keith Ellison to drop out of his race when exactly??
@IronStache @BryanSteilforWI @realDonaldTrump How many sheriff's endorsed you Mr Bryce? How many sheriff's endorsed Mr steil? The answer would be zero for you and all of them for Mr steil , I'd say it's a bit more than some sort of claim
@SenDougJones @Politics1com Ok, now your opinion on Keith Ellison is????
@johnastoehr Walker is a Democrat running as an independent, because it's Alaska
@amyklobuchar @KamalaHarris And your stand on Keith Ellison? Shouldn't we be having an investigation on the accusations against him before we allow a vote on the position he seeks ?? Fair is fair yes?
@SenhorRaposa Everyone should care about that , it's one of the best leading indicators of how are economy is doing
@kkondik Half a million to a million is benefit of a doubt 5 million is we are playing for keeps
@MoveOn @EllisonCampaign Nice that you now admit to supporting an alleged women abuser
@SenGillibrand She's silencing herself by refusing to testify,
@MinnBern2020 Now apply that to scotus and judge kavanaugh
@MinnBern2020 The "case " is far from closed
@MinnBern2020 Funny , I didn't see any actual investigation happen , yet,.  The Minnesota press favors liberals
@AngieCraigMN @StarTribune Will you fight for abused women ? Do you still support Keith Ellison?
@MinnBern2020 So no proof , just an opinion , we all have those
@SenGillibrand Now do Keith Ellison
@MinnBern2020 And what proof does she have to back up her claim, if she knows the accuser she probably knows the accused also , and I'm guessing she's pretty partisan in her political stands , yes?
@TinaSmithMN Do you still support Keith Ellison?
@dino4dino @GOP That's my whole point , voting based on current issue polls like scotus nominee isn't something to always go by
@dino4dino And a majority of Americans didn't want Obamacare to pass when they held that vote , voters do have a say in scotus appointments , we vote for senators and presidents
@DebraMessing @SenFeinstein @lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins And your statement on Keith Ellison is where???? How about Tony Cardenes? Senator carper ? Senator brown?
@dino4dino Tina Smith supports and endorsemed Ellison so has  mark Dayton and ken martin and the entire Dem party when they endorsed him at the party meeting , now show me a single statement from a Dem saying Ellison should be investigated and shouldn't be voted on until fully investigated
#MnAg #mnsen #MNGOV #MN02 #MN03 #MN08 #SCOTUS  it's funny how Dems are all about the kavanaugh accusations and completely silent on Keith Ellison , a bunch of partisan hypocrites https://t.co/3f955NKEHo
@SenGillibrand Ok , now do Keith Ellison
@il_american @SenhorRaposa I think stauber has the best chance of winning but Heng is a very interesting candidate and a great family backstory
@ChrisCuomo @freedom_moates Now do Keith Ellison
@EsotericCD Looney tunes is always solid , it was the real people that wrecked space jam
@KrisinAlexander @LloydEisler @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump What's not funny is someone believing certain races need to think alike , believe that there can't be any independent thought
@Alyssa_Milano Do you support Keith Ellison or do you support his accuser's?
@SenhorRaposa Probably tilt R at this point
@SLThomas Are you extending the same to Keith Ellison's accuser or is this purly partisan?
@TinaSmithMN Apperantly you don't apply the same standards to the office of attorney general , how can you be against kavanaugh and for Keith Ellison? You basically can't unless you admit your a partisan hypocrite
@same0lg3 @conservmillen Keith Ellison is still running , Tony Cardenes is still running , and there is a growing campaign to get franken to run again, , your out of your mind if you can't see Dems are being partisan and hypocritical
@allymutnick @NRCC @RepComstock Tells me the internals have this seat as tossup not lean D , follow the money ,
@madisongesiotto Where you live would determine if you should run and what you should run for
@fawfulfan @gelliottmorris Again anyone can move to wherever they want  no one is forcing politically like minded people to live in the same place , they choose to live there , millions of people move every year , to say they are not able to move is wrong ,
@fawfulfan @gelliottmorris It's really funny you call Pennsylvania's new map "nonpartisan" when it's a Dem gerrymander
@fawfulfan @gelliottmorris No one is forcing anyone to live where they live , the fact that so many Dems want to live in the same places is self packing ,
@amyklobuchar And when are you going to ask for an investigation into Keith Ellison? When will you ask Keith Ellison to withdraw from his election until the allegations against him are investigated?
#CA39 https://t.co/55lJtSfgd8
@BettyMcCollum04 Are you having a meeting with Keith Ellison's accuser? Are you going to have a hearing and investigation on Keith Ellison? Or are you just a partisan hypocrite ?
@nytimes You could start with your own reporters and editorial staff
@QuockerWodging @gelliottmorris Since Pennsylvania turned into a Dem gerrymander now , the worst gerrymandering states are now Maryland and illinois which both benefit the Dems https://t.co/0WvV5fQ56c
@QuockerWodging @gelliottmorris And that's how you can win the popular vote and lose the election, Hillary probably won these two districts by half a million votes , self packing
@QuockerWodging @gelliottmorris Ny congressional district 13 is only 10 square miles total,  it votes 90%plus for Democrats the second most Dem district in the nation , ny 15 is right next to it and not much bigger , it also votes 90%plus for Dems and it's the most Dem plus district , that's self packing
@QuockerWodging @gelliottmorris That's how Pennsylvania got their old map Bob Brady got the district he wanted ( more D friendly and more white) so he push enough state Dems to vote for the map so it would pass
@QuockerWodging @gelliottmorris The problem Ds have with spitting metro areas is most are minority majority districts so you legally can't split it,the rest usually have a well entrenched incumbent who isn't afraid to let it be known that he will make state level D politicans pay if they mess with his district
@RJohnson69 @EastCoast_Dude1 @gelliottmorris Gerrymandering is real but it's definitely not one sided , a good number of maps got passed needing some Dem votes Pennsylvania being a prime example , party boss Bob Brady rounded up enough Dem votes for the map to pass , plus Dems draw gerrymanders also, what vote suppression? https://t.co/sTwfGLWZla
#orgov https://t.co/aKjC27QqhP
#DFL #DNC #mnag #mnsen #mngov #SCOTUS https://t.co/mTbfclzobq
@EastCoast_Dude1 @gelliottmorris Each congressional district is based on the same population numbers , the only way your getting "penalized" is by self packing of like minded voters  , and your condescending attitude is why a majority of the country is red  and you get the nickname of coastal elites
@mitchellreports So , being more transparent, and releasing more actual , documented info  is now "unprecedented" I honestly don't care if the president is  an R or D , being more transparent is a good thing ( having less classified info is good for America)
@EastCoast_Dude1 @gelliottmorris That's called self packing ,
@gelliottmorris When one party self packs into a bunch of districts those numbers actually make sense , how many metro only districts usually go 70 or 80 or even 90 % for Dems ?
@JohnMifflin2 @SenhorRaposa A Hung jury isn't exactly a ringing endorsement of innocence either
@ZerlinaMaxwell Last I checked , bill Clinton is a Democrat, Keith Ellison is a Democrat , Harvey Weinstein is a Democrat ???

@BrennaSpencer A gf/wife  that would want to go gun shopping , target shooting , hunting with me would be the best thing ever
@EricMGarcia And yet they fully support Keith Ellison
@ActorAaronBooth 274 is the first number that should raise question marks , second would be that huge undecided number  , not a poll I'm going to take very seriously at this point
@PeterBeinart Does that include the entire Minnesota Democrat party supporting Keith Ellison's current campaign ? Your really going to pretend they aren't partisan hypocrites
@BradMossEsq @ActorAaronBooth @IvankaTrump Probably learned it from the Clinton playbook ,
@nosdalp51 @RachelSB @davethul Yes there are , https://t.co/Yz1b6252kN
@RachelSB @davethul Accuser needs to be plural for Ellison there are two separate accusations,
@SenatorMenendez And yet you yourself has no problem continuing to be a US senator? Double standards or just plain blind hypocrisy?
@amyklobuchar And yet you are completely silent on Keith Ellison, why the double standards?
@PJR0311 @AngieCraigMN You need an all of the above option
RT @GovMikeHuckabee: Manafort's pro-Ukraine lobbying campaign met with...drum roll please...Obama, Biden https://t.co/lXVCMyj2oE https://t.…

@JamesDerk @Alyssa_Milano @fema Is Democrat former house member Anthony Weiner going to be running it then?
#AZSen https://t.co/2eTM1fJ8HD
@cinyc9 @gelliottmorris The thing about NJ is that every dollar Dem supporting outside groups feel they need to spend here is money being spent on a race that should of been completely safe and it's money that should of went to races that we're always going to be highly competitive ,
@ChrisNagel_SP @V_Williamson As long as they are getting set much lower , then I'm in agreement, but if your advocating for more taxes , then like I said back up your beliefs with your money
@ChrisNagel_SP @V_Williamson I feel like we are being g overtaxed already , if you disagree feel free to donate another 20% of your paycheck to the government , back your beliefs up with your money
@rudnicknoah Canidete quality does matter , Paul Davis is a better known and just better candidate than sharice davids and Paul is running for an open seat
@ChrisNagel_SP @V_Williamson So you just want other people to have the burden of your higher tax "utopia" but not you , you don't believe in putting your money where your beliefs are .....i got it
@ChrisNagel_SP @V_Williamson Strongest? You mean those who work hard for their money
@ChrisNagel_SP @V_Williamson Not really , the government makes it easy to donate to with a web page on the bureau of fiscal service / treasury dept . https://t.co/ztPywVsK7K
@ChrisNagel_SP @V_Williamson And they pay taxes on money earned just like everyone else , if you support higher taxes start putting your money where your beliefs are and start paying more than is legally required of you
@gelliottmorris +2 for team red
@V_Williamson So I'm assuming you pay your required taxes and then donate more of your money to the IRS , because your such a big tax advocate I'm sure you go above and beyond what's legally required of you, right?
@AngieCraigMN Tax cuts are always a good thing ... Every single time taxes are cut it benefits the people of America
@SenhorRaposa There is zero evidence that I've seen to say she is in trouble or doing good , but I do believe she is a weakish candidate going against a very solid  Republican

@AngieCraigMN I'm enjoying my bigger pay check , liberals didn't give a dang about the deficit for eight years of Obama administration , don't come with your fake outrage now , want to lower the deficit , let's talk about what we can cut instead of raising taxes
@SenhorRaposa No one is having their rights restricted, they can freely vote for who ever they want , straight party option is really kinda stupid , only nine states now have it and Texas is getting rid of it after 2018 , down to  only eight for 2020
@PlebeIanMac @SenhorRaposa Actually the fox poll asked about it , definitely worse for her to vote against , according to the poll https://t.co/qb1biMCZ0n

@50Hippie @dino4dino @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Cite me specifically where he went outside of the written laws or constitution in his rulings ?
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN I asked you this already and got crickets, cite me specifically were he made decisions that didn't follow  written laws or the Constitution?
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Wrong , judges apply the law I.E they rule according to the laws not make stuff up as they see fit https://t.co/QHlEOhU4sZ
@alexjgoldstein @AyannaPressley Easy to do in a small sized congressional district , not so easy or effective in big districts or statewide
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Their job is to follow the laws in their rulings not interpret the laws  , the problem with the left is they want judges to legislate from the bench but that's the job of congress to make laws the judges rule based on those laws
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Having the opinion that congress and the Senate have the sole power to determine executive privilege is not "extremist " good Lord is that the best you got? Your grasping at straws and looking desperate
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Which rulings specifically haven't been based on the rules of law and the Constitution?
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Why are Smith and klobachar a solid no without due diligence ?
@EsotericCD There is still a scotus committee going on , give the day some time lol
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Trying to change the subject now I see , I'll take the American bar association evaluation of a  judge  over a special interest magazine article any day , Minnesotans value the Constitution , rule of law and people being qualified to do the job , kavanaugh checks all the boxes
#SCOTUS https://t.co/7qUxRILUbW
@kimanne123 @InPursuit4All I believe general mattis
@SenhorRaposa Cuellar is also pretty well liked  in his district I 	think
@dino4dino @50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN Again Smith and klobachar have said  they are a no vote , against someone extremely qualified, what good is more docs , they are still going to be a no vote , and of course there is this endorsement , what's that say , well qualified, https://t.co/111n275wBe
@SenhorRaposa It would be very counter productive to vote out the ranking member of the ways and means committee, but ya know someone didn't like that one vote that's completely meaningless to the economic viability of the district
@CoryBooker Time and Time again kavanaugh has ruled based on the law and the Constitution, how dare he
@madisongesiotto @Nike Definitely a better idea , but I haven't had any nike stuff in over twenty years ( had some for high school sports) Nike's quality and lack of durability isn't worth the higher price
@50Hippie @KarinHousley @TinaSmithMN So Tina Smith and Amy klobachar have said for along time now that they are a no vote , so what good does more documents do  but waste time ? Smith and klobachar are still going to be a no vote, they were always going to be a no vote if it was one document release or a million
@TheMarkPantano Elizabeth Warren and Tina Smith give her a run for the title

@ActorAaronBooth Moderate Dem and independent voters in the 8th are mostly pro mining and pro 2A while the progressive Dems are not , problem for the D party here is progressive Dems are a large minority
@jswainhart @AngieCraigMN From the same article you tagged , pork barrel spending from when Democrats controlled the southren states is a big contributions to it , so we could also call the southren states outliers https://t.co/IC7v1ESgdU

@jswainhart @AngieCraigMN Well considering blue new mexico is number one and Virgina , Hawaii and Maryland are near the top in getting more federal than they give while north Dakota and Wyoming get less back than Minnesota ,I think you should research before spouting left wing talking points https://t.co/3q9tLkO08P
@SenhorRaposa I don't think the batmobile has a VIN # so their are  many no nos from the start and who would actually give car insurance for that lol
@AngieCraigMN About time Minnesota lowers the tax rates then huh? We should never be dependent on the federal government to cover our high tax rates
@ActorAaronBooth Maybe the fundraising numbers have been falling for him idk?trying to rally the $
@mngopchairwoman Are any running for office ?
@SenhorRaposa Actually they are legally required to be protected, unless they personally request to not be , Barron will be protected until he's 16, Clinton and bush jr asked for and received extension  for their kids thru college and I believe Obama also got extensions thru college for kids https://t.co/aOKBOhCDZX

@deanbphillips @RepErikPaulsen Maybe Minnesota should lower it's taxes instead of hidding the higher taxes with a federal exemption
@RealRonHoward Well Obama and Clinton left office richer than they went in , look we get it you don't like trump and I'm fine with that , he's not everyone's cup of tea , but don't be a hypocrite about it
@LutchiGayot And you have my support,
@politicsluo @JMilesColeman Utah and  new Mexico have third party based swings and Hawaii is probably just returning to  a normal level after Obama, Georgia,Texas and Arizona swings  get talked about alot but Oregon, and the entire northeast except Massachusetts is really kinda suprising

@dino4dino @MN_poppy @Jacob_Frey @miasberman @Erik_Paulsen @deanbphillips I'm sure these groups don't want anything in return for their investment https://t.co/TGyVo4OC70
@MN_poppy Using pac money while claiming your against pac money is being hypocritical
@MN_poppy @Jacob_Frey @miasberman @Erik_Paulsen @deanbphillips Again,  he's saying donate to a pac because of a  different pac , all the while the canidete doesn't want pacs , yes that hypocritical
@MN_poppy @Jacob_Frey @miasberman @Erik_Paulsen @deanbphillips You do realize that act blue is a pac , and 5 different pacs are spending money in support of Phillips ? That's why it's hypocritical
@politicsluo Cedric Richmond would make alot of sense for the Dems , young , poc, safe seat , leadership experience as CBC chair, and someone I think could balance the progressive and moderate wings of the house
@mcimaps Those numbers fit the primary vote totals ( I know, primary vote doesn't equal general vote) , but Murphy has been a mistake free freshman rep , I would of expected slightly better numbers ,
@Jacob_Frey @miasberman @Erik_Paulsen @deanbphillips So your arguing against one pac while promoting a different super pac ? You don't see the hypocrisy in that ?
@CynthiaNixon "undocumented " would be a big reason why
@jeffsgo17 @deanbphillips @RepErikPaulsen @actblue Open secrets ,FEC, politico and Wikipedia disagree with you along with many others , act blue is a pac , it files as a pac, it's listed as a pac , https://t.co/RgD18CDvME
@jeffsgo17 @deanbphillips @RepErikPaulsen @actblue https://t.co/e3hkoaWOC8
@RWXPolitic @deanbphillips @RepErikPaulsen Or the house majority pac , which is spending for Phillips
@StarTribune @kat_douglass Well that pretty much proves that just throwing money at a problem solves nothing
@RWXPolitic @deanbphillips @RepErikPaulsen It is a pac and they file as a pac with the fec and open secrets classified them as a pac https://t.co/G3OolXa0o1

@TinaSmithMN @tammybaldwin Instead of fighting to protect a bad health care policy ( yes the Republican bill also sucked ) why aren't you pushing legislation to fix it , improve it , make it more affordable , you know save 2500$ a year like we were promised and bring back the good plans
@TCVFarmer @MPRnews @SenTinaSmith Independent advocate for MN ? Name me one policy issue Smith differs on from the Dem party ?
@deanbphillips @RepErikPaulsen Well you do have 5 pacs that have reported spending on your behalf , including two super pacs , and you accept donations from act blue which is another super pac , maybe alittle bit hypocritical?
@EricBauman Why in the hell would any business or corporation donate to the Dems , it's not in their best interest, republicans are pro business,  pro growth, Dems are anti business globalists , anti jobs and pro government programs as a substitute for jobs
@HuffPost Absolutely not

@IronStache @SpeakerRyan What poll?
@ActorAaronBooth I actually think thats a really good poll for Tenney , she squeaked by in 16 because a  third party candidate got 12.5 % , Richard Hanna was a good fit for this district , Tenney is not close to being a Richard Hanna
@jwphotographyaz @jetrotter @christianllamar @AllisonluvsDW2 @AZRed65 Yes , no split ticket  voting allowed in the primary

@browntailedhawk @CookPolitical You haven't laid out any case , all you say is trump has this disapprove number so all elections are already settled ? I've laid out several different reasons why it will be competitive and debunked your one reason
@browntailedhawk @CookPolitical And his disapprove numbers were 60% by gravis and 58% by PPP in 2016 , i don't see how lower disapprove numbers from  are going to make it harder?

@browntailedhawk @CookPolitical Tossup by election day
@browntailedhawk @CookPolitical July Marist poll had housley down 14, August Suffolk poll had her down 7 , that's cutting the margin in half, Emerson had it at 4 in August
@browntailedhawk @CookPolitical MN is no stranger to ticket spitting, trump won districts 1,7,8 while Dems won the house seats, Hillary won the 3rd district while the Republican won the house seat ,  Amy klobachar is popular and we'll know, Tina Smith isn't
@SenhorRaposa She's closing the gap in polling and on the ground as voters start to get to know her , this race will be pretty competitive, housley will win the 6, 7,and 8 congressional districts by alot ,50/50 in the first and second , lose the third by a little and lose alot in 4and 5
@browntailedhawk @CookPolitical Housley is closing the gap in the polls and on the ground as voters are becoming aware of her

@PeterWedlake Yes she is , the only reason you don't/ won't see it is you don't want to
@PeterWedlake Again running for congress doesn't equal fighting and dying in ww2 , she can join the military if she wants to make that comparison
@PeterWedlake Bad take , that's not what she said , she compared running for congress as being the same as fighting and dying in world war two
@PeterWedlake She actually did say that very thing , that is what she was comparing herself to

@TossupReport @SenhorRaposa If the next three census estimates look closer to the 16/17 numbers than the first five years MN won't lose a seat , my guess is MN holds onto 8 and California goes to 52
@PeterWedlake Context is key , she's running to be one of 435 house members , she's not a combat soldier who puts their life on the line
@PeterWedlake It's pretty clear she is comparing herself to those who risked death fighting the Germans and Japanese

@DrKimSchrier Have you apologized to the veterans in your district yet?
@RandallFrench14 That's a really bad take , it's the same as saying someone deserved to get sexually assaulted because of the clothes the wore
@BettyMcCollum04 @realDonaldTrump Still waiting for your statement on Keith Ellison? Why so silent?
@UnitersCentrist I'm not twisting anything , if you implement term limits , your kicking a candidate off the ballot , a candidate that a majority of the district/state/area likes and votes for , your taking away choice and someone that a majority feel represents them well
@UnitersCentrist Again your advocating for less choice for the voter , forcing the voters to not be able to vote for the person they may believe best represents them and their area  ,
@UnitersCentrist How exactly does forcing someone off the ballot give voters  more options ? No one is stopping people from running in primary's , go out and win the people over ,
@UnitersCentrist Actually not does , what your advocating for is taking choice away from the voters , forcing the possible preferred candidate out of the election

@liveoakgrove @JohnCornyn Yes Texas is ranked 6th in property tax by the tax foundation but you have to remember , you have no state income tax , and your median house cost  is around 217k the same house in California would cost you around 448k

@dino4dino @Virgen_Dilullo @AngieCraigMN Why should we let states fall back on the federal government for overtaxing us  at the salt ( state and local) levels , if a state raises taxes too high they should own up to it and not rely on the federal government to bail them out and smooth over their higher  taxation rates

@ScottforFlorida Sanibel and captiva islands are an amazing paridise, nice getaway vacation spot  from a Minnesota winter
@geoffreyvs In the only poll I've seen the rebulican was getting the exact same % that trump got , the current libertarian was behind what Johnson got and heinrich was ahead of what Clinton got so the Pres election would tell us that some lean D voters moved to libertarian not R voters
@SenhorRaposa It's also a state that trump finished third in with  the pres. caucus system, rubio carried the state
@rudnicknoah He won't lose i don't think , but he will probably burn thru his 4 mil coh just to make sure , which he probably wouldn't do without Johnson on the ballot
@rudnicknoah Mark rich is right at Trump's 40% but Dunn is about 4% under Johnson's numbers
@GeorgiaLogCabin That's because states legally have to balance their budgets and alot of  dems , not all, have a hard time implenting their agendas without adding taxes, new Jersey almost shut down because Dems we're fighting with themselves over which taxes to raise , not whether they should

@kk_nguyen @AngieCraigMN We won't get the higher Brazilian prices because we have a lower protein % , meaning someone like China can pay more for Brazil beans and still come out ahead dollar wose because they need less bushels to get the protein levels for their animal feed https://t.co/jEBgK7xPz2

@kk_nguyen @AngieCraigMN Maybe but  we have had depressed commodity prices since before trump was president , and miss Craig is implying that those pre trump 10$ beans was "thriving" for farmers , it's a dishonest or uneducated statement
@SenhorRaposa I think it's kinda a two for one thing , Barletta 2018 trump 2020
@AngieCraigMN If you consider 10$ a bushel soybeans as "thriving " then you really don't know modern agriculture , you can argue about the weather the tariffs will work or not ( it's a debatable issue) but to give the assumption that commodity prices were thriving is decitful and dishonest

And that says all you really need to know about the hypocritical Dem party https://t.co/5gTfooKg6K
@jrupprecht_mn @AndrewHodny @epmurphymn California buried it after they got the numbers from their CBO, Colorado voters declined to enact a single payer ballot measure with a funding device by 70% to 30%, once you actually have to put a price tag and taxes on your socalized dream support goes away rapidly ,
@jrupprecht_mn @AndrewHodny @epmurphymn Well Vermont actually put the work in to craft a  workable single payer system , consulting with Harvard economists, and the governor finally scaped it after three years of trying , the top Dem on the health care committee said , it is completely unsustainable at this point
@dtrj_ @Politics_Polls @USCDornsife @latimes The point I was trying to make is newsom isn't an unknown, he already has statewide name rec, if this poll is accurate, he has alot of soft support, but I agree he will be around 60 when it's all said and done
@Politics_Polls @USCDornsife @latimes What's suprising is 27% undecided in a state where the Dem should get 60% with ease
@AndrewJTobias @kkondik Someone paid attention to how succesful Portman ran against Strickland
@AndrewHodny @jrupprecht_mn @epmurphymn Like I said earlier,Ca single payer plan would cost over 300 billion that's according to the California CBO,premiums and employers copay is only around 100 billion, so that's 200 + billion above and beyond premiums, there are very valid reasons they and vt haven't funded it
@AndrewHodny @jrupprecht_mn @epmurphymn Good idea , then every rich person will put their wealth into a trust and move it to north or south Dakota, just like mark Daytons family already did, and our tax revenue drops even lower
@AndrewHodny @jrupprecht_mn @epmurphymn You will be paying much more than your current premium already is
@jrupprecht_mn @AndrewHodny @epmurphymn So paying more in taxes than we are currently paying in premiums is your solution to the problem?
@Chrissygreen12 Already donated to him
@jrupprecht_mn @AndrewHodny @epmurphymn So again , how exactly are you going to pay for it?
@jrupprecht_mn @AndrewHodny @epmurphymn The California single payer plan is estimated ( by the ca legislators) to cost over 300 billion , ca total state budget is 137b , your now tripling a state budget , current premiums and employers copay only covers 100b , their isn't even close to enough rich people to cover it ?

@ActorAaronBooth Also Johnson will be the only canidete on either side that's able to  get  party help if no DFL endorsement

@DMoerlins @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Still didn't answer either question , if they have 30 million dollars to spend on elections , why do they need any taxpayers money , and why should my money go to a place that kills innocent babies?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump Two questions for ya , 1, if planned Parenthood has an extra 30 million dollars lying around to throw away on 2018 election ads/donations why do they need a single penny in taxpayers money? 2 why should a single $ of mine go to a place  killing innocent babies ?
@accordingtoame @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump And taxpayers money is going to that how exactly?

@SenhorRaposa D primary's could possibly be interesting tho , Blumenthal will  be 76 , wyden will be 73, schumer 72 , Leahy 82, and Patty murray 72 , not all will retire obviously but I'd expect one or two will, more likely Leahy and Blumenthal

@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Did you say housing the homeless lol have you seen your tent cities , dicarded needles and human feces in the streets?
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert I'm not the wrongly complaining about where my high taxes come from , I know where,  from Dem tax and spend policy's
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Like I said I'm perfectly ok with the salt exemption going away
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Been under liberal control too long , things are getting better tho with a republican state house and Senate , we will get on the right track , Cali I don't know ?
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert And yet I support the tax cuts and deduction on salt exemption because state taxes should not hide behind a federal exemption
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert So does Minnesota , you don't see me using it as an excuse to raise even more taxes
@LionMyth @AP He's not saying the law itself is unconstitutional , he's saying it was enacted illegally
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert And like I said it's not necessary, you can build new infastucture without it ,
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Because I don't believe in salt exemption, if your state wants to raise taxes go ahead and do it but don't hide behind the federal government and try to cover up the taxes
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Sure we could start a health care debate but your just deflecting again away from the gas tax and California state high taxes
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Again , salt is STATE and LOCAL taxes , you shouldn't get a federal exemption because your state can't control it's tax and spend policy's
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert There are ways to pay for infastucture without raising new taxes , we have fought off a gas tax here for eight years and we are still getting new roads and infastucture, it's not hard
@MNJeffJohnson First, I haven't decided who I'll vote for yet (  it definitely won't be a Dem) but the convention thing is dumb let the voters decide, not party delegates, a primary is the fair way to decide and it will get policy stands out front which is what voters want ,
@Mrs_Bonds2015 @KenCalvert Because the gas tax negatively affects the people he represents and he didn't raise your taxes , your state legislators did , salt is state and local tax, federal government should not have salt exemption just because Cali can't stop raising taxes
@MinnPatriot Going to a primary and letting the voters decide is neither stealing or classless , conventions are how elections are stolen, taking the voice away from the voters , having a primary is the fairest way of getting a candidate, support whoever but it should be decided by votes
@ActorAaronBooth @MarkWarner It's also hard for Dems to explain supporting haspel's boss but not her
@_Drew_McCoy_ Depends , if you consider corruption as dysfunctional then Missouri isn't even close to the most , if you consider corruption a separate issue then yeah it's close
@KenCalvert What I see on  the comments in here is a lot of liberals trying their very best to deflect away from bad liberal policy that is hurting their state ,
@chelseahandler 1.They had weapons ,2.Why would any responsibile parent bring a child to something that every one knew was going to become violent? 3 How should isreal respond , let them flood over the border and wait for them to start killing Israeli citizens, because that's what they would do

@amyklobuchar Most people won't read it and don't care , just more unnecessary cost passed on to business
@march_todd @AngieCraigMN 2.5 million in outside spending in support of Angie plus 4 million she raised thru her campaign including over 800k in pac money, so 6.5 million total give or take a couple$$
@AngieCraigMN Only 13% of your campaign cash has come from within your district, 40% of your donations come from out of state and last election cycle 2.5 million was spent from outside spending in support of you , your really not one to talk about campaign cash ,
@AngieCraigMN That's a little hypocritical considering you have accepted 225k in pac money this election cycle and over 800k in pac money last election cycle, according to open secrets only 14% of your campaign cash has come from small donors, 21% from pacs,

@rudnicknoah @EricMGarcia If the allegations are true ( I'm not saying they are or are not )this is more  similar to Roy Moore  than Conyers or Ruben and the media had no problem running his story

@thenationalgood @TinaSmithMN I'm assuming your talking about Dem rep Tony cardenes ?
@BurnsieMN @AngieCraigMN The policy's of the DNC has put the Democratic party at the least amount of Nationwide power since world war two , and if you look at were people are moving to , they are moving out of blue states and into red States
@BurnsieMN @AngieCraigMN They do that by raising taxes and increased spending,they don't actually"fix" the problem they just throw money at it ,you can do that when you don't have to actually balance a budget, but it's still not right, every poll out there has a majority wanting gop in charge of economy
@BurnsieMN @AngieCraigMN Again that's government funding to prop up a program that was meant to be self sufficient , adding more taxpayers money to lower premiums for some  is not actual lower premiums ,
@BurnsieMN @AngieCraigMN I'm guessing you don't understand how the corridor of commerce is supposed to legally work and health care was supposed to be self funding , remember how we were going to save 2500$ a year and keep our plan ? And I'm enjoying my extra money from the tax cuts , no complats here

@anthonyaalongi @epmurphymn Second, what corporate welfare? According to the tax foundation we had the third highest Corp. tax rate in the world, Canada is at 13%, China 25%  we are now more in line and competitive with the rest of the world , you can try to argue it went to low but it needed to come down
@anthonyaalongi @epmurphymn Ok legit questions for you, how do you plan to pay for single payer? California and Vermont have passed it in theory but failed to fund it , in Cali it would cost 400 billion, most analysis estimate they would need 50 to 110 billion in new revenue, ie taxes, to fully fund it ?

@em_div @TinaSmithMN More likely its pure partisan politics, name me one Republican she or the majority of Dems would vote to confirm?
@TinaSmithMN Outstate Minnesota has had enough of the DFL we are solid red now and we are not moving back , you try to destroy rural economy with over the top regulations on small business and small lending companies , your extreme environment regs add $$ burdens to rural citzens and farmers
