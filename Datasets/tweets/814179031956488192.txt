To answer the President's attack on immigrant Members of Congress - "How did they do in their country?...Not too good" - I'm told that during my 3 months as an infant in India, I did just fine. I'd also add that the United States of America is my country just as much as it's his. https://t.co/TAflqnvNsk
My family came to the United States to continue my father's education and because my parents knew what was possible here, even if they never dreamed their son would serve in Congress. That is the promise of our country: hope and possibility. Our mission should be expanding both.
I am a Member of Congress, I am an immigrant, and I am an American who loves his country deeply. My colleagues with similar backgrounds have their own stories, whether they came to our country as children, adults, or even as a refugee, but we share a devotion to our country. https://t.co/TAflqnvNsk

Douglass said of Lincoln, "He was ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the rights of humanity in the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people of this country." 4/6 https://t.co/MYV7t129Y8
Douglass' "Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln" which he delivered on April 14, 1876 in Washington similarly touches on this balance of Lincoln's personal and public views on race and the complicated blending of the two 3/6	https://t.co/IpfWa3FT6q
For example, Douglass' interactions with Lincoln over the role and treatment of black troops in the Civil War were revealing in his warm treatment of Douglass and sincere support for the regiments of black troops, but the limitations of that support 2/6 https://t.co/rC57zcl39T
Frederick Douglass' writings on Lincoln are particularly fascinating in this regard because he addresses both aspects in Lincoln, a man he came to respect and love, who never went as far or as fast as Douglass wished but whose efforts he didn't diminish despite disappointment 1/6 https://t.co/PWxFlKsulX

The efforts of one state's anti-gun crime policies can be wholly sabotaged by the failed enforcement programs or lax laws of another, and national reforms, including universal background checks, are the only real answer to this national problem.
I've introduced and cosponsored a range of gun reforms that can make a real difference because of their federal scale: gun violence is a national epidemic that must be addressed at the federal level.
While the details of this attack are still emerging, it follows the pattern of so many other tragedies we've witnessed at the intersection of gun violence, domestic violence, and laws often inadequate to stop preventable loss of life driven by either.
The attack on the Mercy Hospital was a profound and disturbing tragedy for the victims, their loved ones, and all others in our region and country who were touched by yesterday's shocking events. https://t.co/1yc8cS2bTG

@mattyglesias I'm also reminded of Professor Shklar's thought that "it seems to me that liberal and humane people, of whom there are many among us, would, if they were asked to rank the vices, put cruelty first. Intuitively they would choose cruelty as the worst thing we do."

@waltshaub Some of us are fighting but they're organized: the Oversight Committee &amp; Judiciary Committee's GOP leaders have called in both FBI Deputy Director McCabe and Chief of Staff Rybicki. It's clear this is part of an effort to discredit them.
@jonfavs @SpeakerRyan As an Oversight Committee member who's participated in confidential interviews with Deputy FBI Director McCabe and FBI Chief of Staff Rybicki, I'm convinced this is the very reason they're being called in: so the GOP can smear them before they can testify against President Trump.
I serve on the House Oversight Committee and this article explains why the GOP called Deputy FBI Director McCabe and FBI Chief Of Staff Rybicki in for interviews: as part of an effort to protect President Trump from Special Counsel Mueller and the consequences of his own actions. https://t.co/sccuQWN3SU

@brianbeutler Sorry to solicit political theory via tweet but thanks for the compelling outline. I‚Äôll look forward to any future pieces in which you have more room to elaborate, especially on the enlightenment liberal divergence point. Hope you‚Äôll have the chance to Locke it down. (Forgive me)

@brianbeutler Well said, then &amp; now. So that leaves us trying to analyze radically disparate understandings of reality that aren‚Äôt even comparable enough for an asymmetrical analysis? Is there a new model you‚Äôd point to or has it not emerged yet? (forgive me if the answer is in your archive)

The President himself would benefit from these provisions, as he still retains holdings in various LLCs despite claiming to put his business interests in a blind trust. Given that we still have not seen his tax returns, we don‚Äôt even know the extent he would benefit. (8/)
For example, Senior Advisor Kushner, who built his fortune through real estate, would benefit from this tax plan while still serving in the White House. (7/)
Even more insidious is how this tax bill could benefit family members of the President‚Äôs family and President Trump himself (6/)
In the past, leadership would try to whip votes by including provisions that benefit constituents. Now they‚Äôre just enriching the Senators themselves. (5/)
Rather than working with Democrats to help reform the tax code to benefit working families and the middle class while remaining deficit neutral, Congressional Republicans are buying off votes with deals like the #CorkerKickBack. (4/)
The Senate majority whip HIMSELF admitted over the weekend that the #CorkerKickback was included specifically to cobble together enough votes for the bill to pass! (3/)
Simply put, the new version of the #GOPTaxScam contains a provision that allows owners of large real estate holdings, including Sen. Corker, through a ‚Äúpass through‚Äù corporation (or LLC) to deduct a portion of their income from their taxes (2/)

If the Vice President didn't know that Don Jr. was in touch with WikiLeaks, he was one of the only people in a senior role on the campaign, as @juliaioffe revealed: https://t.co/MwiyWdSREU https://t.co/68Hd6jFuYQ

With all due respect to the gang in the Mystery Machine, I never knew "Ghost Hunter" was a job. Then again, I never knew "federal judge who's never tried a case and has been practicing law for three years" was one either.	https://t.co/A0a3WxAofV
When it‚Äôs really a branch of a hostile intelligence service https://t.co/aWbw4Z0oF3
Between the President's taking Putin's word for it on Russian interference and the revelations about Don Jr.'s correspondence with Wikileaks I think we really need the KREMLIN Act to dig deeper into Putin's underlying goals.	https://t.co/BYnJ8bFkun
President Trump's own CIA Director, Mike Pompeo, has called Wikileaks a Russia-aided "non-state hostile intelligence service" and @DonaldJTrumpJr was pen pals with them while informing the entire senior campaign staff. Surreal. https://t.co/MwiyWdSREU
As I read @juliaioffe's incredible piece on @DonaldJTrumpJr's correspondence with Wikileaks, this line from the President's son on @HillaryClinton seems to have aged with particular irony. https://t.co/MwiyWdSREU https://t.co/kAKSiiZ3cE
And here's @DonaldJTrumpJr taking the advice of Wikileaks and then asking them for more information on an upcoming leak. https://t.co/MwiyWdSREU https://t.co/Lu1cxD71Mo
Another layer to @DonaldJTrumpJr's correspondence with Wikileaks: Virtually the entire senior staff of the Trump team was aware of it.	https://t.co/MwiyWdSREU https://t.co/5Bq2rIkkN6
This is outrageous: @DonaldJTrumpJr was in contact with Wikileaks during the campaign and may have even actively sought information at their request on critics of his father. #TrumpRussia https://t.co/MwiyWdSREU

After the war, his father refused to have Col. Shaw reburied, writing, "We can imagine no holier place than that in which he lies."
When the Regiment's white commander, Col. Robert Gould Shaw, was killed, Confederate forces buried him with his men as an act of dishonor.
This led the regiment, while covering a Union retreat, to charge forward to the cry "Massachusetts and Seven Dollars a Month!"
Promised equal pay to white soldiers, they were instead paid only $7 per month, instead of $13. The regiment boycotted paytables in response

@TwoSeventyThree I'm going to do this as a representative &amp; as the Ranking Member of the House Oversight Committee's healthcare subcommittee
@TwoSeventyThree and trying to convince my colleagues. And if we can't convince them, maybe we can convince enough of their constituents
@TwoSeventyThree this is a bad bill that will hurt millions of people no matter who controls the House. I'm going to keep spreading the word
@TwoSeventyThree with the GOP majority there are only so many structural ways to resist, they have the levers of power. But we can persuade
