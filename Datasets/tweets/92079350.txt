@karaaley @NBCFirstRead Huge. But it's why IA is so important, IMO.		Harris going into SC/South/CA after finishing 1st or 2nd in IA is a lot different than her finishing worse than that in the Hawkeye State -- even with early voting in CA.
@NBCFirstRead Oh, and anyone who tells you that Iowa isn’t going to be important in deciding who the 2 or 3 Democratic finalists are going to be is kidding themselves. 		Iowa’s always important -- and maybe more so than ever with this potential field
@NBCFirstRead And we think there’s one more path for a Democrat to win the nomination – by winning over pragmatic Democrats in the early contests, and later overperforming among African Americans, millennials or both. 		(Is that Biden, Beto, Sherrod, someone else?)
@NBCFirstRead Both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders (if he gets in) have a similar path, too – win (or overperform) in Iowa with progressive voters, and use that to win New Hampshire, which borders Warren’s Massachusetts and Sanders’ Vermont. 		This was Sanders’ route in 2016, btw.
@NBCFirstRead Both Booker and Kamala Harris are trying to take the same path to the nomination – win (or overperform) in Iowa; win South Carolina; and clean up delegates in the early southern primaries.

One more perception-vs-reality component of the scream: Dean didn't lose the Dem nomination because of the scream. 		“We took third that day,” Joe Trippi told me. 		Dean added for this story: “What did in our candidacy was ourselves."
But there was another story behind Dean's scream: It played much differently to those in attendance -- including yours truly -- versus those who saw it on TV. 		Reason: The mic for the TV cameras drowned out the rowdy crowd.		And I remember Tom Harkin more fired up than Dean!

Weakness No. 2: After her DNA video -- which produced backlash from the Cherokee Nation -- the "Pocahontas" attacks from Trump didn't go away; in fact, they might have gotten worse https://t.co/Yb4nJutAJU

Strength No. 3: She's a prolific fundraiser, raking in a whopping $42M in her 2012 race against Scott Brown (though that was half of Beto's $80M in 2018). 		And she gets to transfer $12M from her 2018 account
Strength No. 2: She's a progressive -- inside the Dem Party.		Unlike Bernie, she's a card-carrying Democrat. Also unlike Bernie, she immediately endorsed HRC after the '16 primaries ended.		That gives her the ability to get what eluded Sanders in '16: support from party actors
Strength No. 1: She lives next door to New Hampshire, which also was a benefit to these other Dems who made headway in past Dem presidential contests: Dukakis, Kerry, Dean and Sanders.		(But note: None of those 4 New Englanders ever made it to the White House)

@pkcapitol Can't wait to read, since you've been in front of it all over the last 8 years
Of course, we'll find out what happens when Pelosi/Dems take control of the House on Jan. 3. But the track record over last 8 years has been clear for everyone to see.
But the central culprit here over the last 8 years has been the House GOP -- whether led by John Boehner or Paul Ryan. (Ask yourself: Are there enough votes *right now* in the House to pass the Senate CR? Think the answer is clearly yes.)
Sure, Republicans can point the finger at Obama over the debt-ceiling standoff. Blame the 60-vote standard in Senate. And, yes, President Trump has his fingerprints all over the current chaos.
There was the debt-ceiling standoff of 2011. The fiscal-cliff fight in 2012. The government shutdown of 2013. The sequester. Now this looming shutdown before Christmas.
If there's been one constant over the last 8 years -- in the Obama or Trump presidencies -- it's been the dysfunction from House Republicans in control of that chamber.

@scarylawyerguy @nbcthegoodplace And thanks for reading and following
@scarylawyerguy Thought this line, in the Nov 6 section, made it pretty clear where I stood:		"In other words, the FBI’s investigation into those additional emails didn’t uncover anything new. Nearly all of them were duplicates of emails the agency had already seen."
@scarylawyerguy It's right here, under the Oct. 31 section https://t.co/zNbtaQvOmP https://t.co/847LZgeJTW
@craasch @realDonaldTrump Agree that context is important. 		But given Trump's "This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate!" rhetoric in '16, it's more than fair to remember that rhetoric when looking at the Russia/Mueller investigation.
@scarylawyerguy Here's my retrospective -- from Aug 2017 -- on the last 12 days of that race, including an accounting of how we, collectively, covered the Comey letter and the WikiLeaks releases. It's all here: https://t.co/zNbtaQvOmP
For those of us who covered the 2016 race, it's instructive to think about *how* Trump campaigned in those final two weeks vs. what's happened in his first two years as POTUS https://t.co/QdZnL2Mtwl https://t.co/ZC2f3C72Vh

And these are *only* the allegations and evidence we learned on Friday. 		There’s nothing about that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting; nothing about the WikiLeaks disclosures of hacked campaign emails; nothing about why Trump fired Comey https://t.co/QdZnL2Mtwl
And just before the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests, Team Trump was offered “synergy” with the Russian government https://t.co/wQlBZotmrc
Well, for starters, we learned from US attorneys in NY that Trump directed an illegal campaign-finance scheme to make payments covering up two affairs in the last days of the '16 campaign https://t.co/auT7nPBs3Q

And that the laws of political gravity applied to Trump in 2018 provides this important lesson for 2020: Political fundamentals still matter. 		Can Trump broaden his popularity? Raise his job rating? And will the U.S. economy still be firing on all cylinders 2 years from now?

Oh, and Joe Manchin got nearly 50% in his WV-SEN win -- down from his 61% in 2012. 		Bottom line: Across the country in 2018, Dems were hitting their ceilings in the Trump Era. But those ceilings weren't enough to win in the reddest of states.
RT @toreyvanoot: "So good candidates matter. So do bad opponents." https://t.co/P3kRLafhF8

@krakowianin91 But I'm not talking about margin. Am talking about same percentage of the vote (46%)
Worth noting: The 46% McCaskill got is exactly the same as the 46% that Jason Kander got in 2016 (while Hillary Clinton got 38% in MO in '16, and Obama took 44% in '12).

Agreed. In totality, the GOP TV ad blitz against Pelosi failed.

@NBCFirstRead There are 2 ways Dems can get around this math:		1 Pelosi opponents vote against her in closed-door conference elections on Nov 28 -- requiring simple Dem majority - and vote for her on Jan 3		2 On Jan 3, Pelosi opponents could vote "present" - reducing magic number for majority
@NBCFirstRead 12 incoming Dem freshmen have said they won't support Pelosi as speaker. That could grow to 16 if Dems win CA-39, ME-2, NJ-3 and UT-4. 		And this doesn't include *current* members. 		If Dems end up at +38 for 2018, they can only afford 15 defections to maintain their majority.

Trump's job rating in the new NBC/WSJ poll		Among likely voters	Approve: 45%	Disapprove: 52%		Among registered voters	Approve: 47%	Disapprove: 49%		Trump's 47% approval among reg voters is the highest yet of his presidency in our poll
Why are Dems faring better in the NBC/WSJ poll's likely-voter model? 		The poll found increased enthusiasm from women, Latinos and young voters
Congressional preference among all registered voters	Dem-controlled Congress: 48%	GOP-controlled Congress: 41%		(Was D+12 last month among registered voters)

Collins ended her speech at 3:51 pm ET. 		The one thing she didn't address in her speech -- to the best of my knowledge -- was Kavanaugh's testimony last Thursday: the "revenge" and "what goes around comes around" comments
Collins says it's her hope that Brett Kavanaugh "will work to lessen the divisions within the Supreme Court"
Collins: The liberals who used Christine Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh cared very little for her or her privacy
Susan Collins: "The #MeToo movement is real... and it's long overdue... We must listen to survivors."
Collins on Christine Blasey Ford: "I believe she is a survivor of sexual assault." 		Nevertheless, Collins says, Ford couldn't bring witnesses forward who could corroborate her allegations
There it is: She mentioned the Ford allegations beginning at 3:31 pm ET.		She cited "due process" and the presumption of innocence -- in responding to the allegations

At any point over the last 12 days, especially before he went on Fox News (of all places) to defend himself, Kavanaugh could have said this entire spectacle wasn’t worth it — for his wife, for his family, and for institution of the Supreme Court itself.
Mitch McConnell — who called on Al Franken to resign — could have pulled the plug and told Trump &amp; fellow GOP senators that time would be better served trying to confirm a different nominee before November’s elections, when Dems have about a 40% chance of winning the SEN
At any moment, especially after the second accusation by Deborah Ramirez, President Trump could have thrown in the towel on Kavanaugh and nominated one of his other finalists (Kethledge, Hardiman)

Florida's GOV race (DeSantis vs. Gillum) will be a play to the base -- and six takeaways from last night's primaries  https://t.co/DDBxkFusdB
4. With Gillum's primary win, the stakes for progressives couldn't be higher.		If he wins in FL, it's quite a statement for progressives. 		But if he loses -- against DeSantis -- it will prove that Dem base politics/Sanderism/etc doesn't play in FL.
3. Gillum benefited from the primary field going after Gwen Graham, leaving him virtually untouched (including over FBI investigation!).		When DeSantis/GOP go after him, it will be the first real punch he'll receive.
2. Tom Steyer got behind Gillum much earlier than Bernie Sanders did. 		And Steyer put his money where is mouth is.
Some points about Gillum that are getting lost after his primary victory: 		1. He's much more than a Bernie-backed candidate; he's an African-American backed by Bernie. 		And progressive people of color (Gillum, Jealous, AOS) have had a better track record in '18 than white progs

So when we talk about Trump's surprise win in 2016, it was aided -- in addition to Comey and Russia intervention -- by a candidate promising his opponent was engaged in the "biggest political scandal since Watergate."		Video montage: https://t.co/1J6OxL0l9P
Trump in Wilmington, NC on Nov 5, 2016: "If she were to win, it would create an unprecedented constitutional crisis. If she ever got into the Oval Office, Hilary and her special interests would rob this country blind, you've seen what's happened."
Trump in Wilmington, OH on Nov 4, 2016: "Hillary has engaged in a criminal massive enterprise and cover-ups like probably nobody ever before."
Trump in Orlando, FL on Nov 2, 2016: "Hillary is likely to be under investigation for many years, probably concluding in a criminal trial."
Trump in Miami, FL on Nov 2, 2016: "If Hillary Clinton were to be elected, it would create an unprecedented and protracted constitutional crisis. Haven't we just been through a lot with the Clintons, right?"
Trump in Golden, CO on Oct 29, 2016: "Hillary has nobody to blame but herself for her mounting legal troubles. Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful."
Trump in Cedar Rapids, IA on Oct 28, 2016: "The investigation is the biggest political scandal since Watergate and it's everybody's hope that justice at last can be delivered."
Given the Cohen and Manafort news from yesterday -- as well as the earlier guilty pleas from Flynn, Gates and Papa -- it's worth remembering *how* Trump campaigned vs. Hillary Clinton in the last two weeks of the 2016 election.		Especially after the Oct. 28 Comey letter.
The party that cried "Lock her up!" faces this choice: Defend Trump or investigate.		And if it doesn't investigate Cohen implicating Trump in a crime, then it will only play into Dem hands that the GOP can't hold Trump accountable https://t.co/DtyH0lRLNw

Now *maybe* Trump was talking about the fact that GDP growth in Q1 of 2017 (when he took office) was less than GDP growth in Q4 of 2016. 		But that is not a "very tough hand" https://t.co/YG8Gn2hN7u
By contrast, the month Obama took office (Jan 2009), the unemployment rate was 7.8%, and it would rise to 10.0% by Oct. 2009. 		What's more, in the single month of Jan 2009, the economy lost 787,000 jobs.
That comment, which Trump said at today's Cabinet meeting, is flat-out wrong by any objective measure. 		The month he took office (Jan 2017), the unemployment rate was 4.8% (it is now 3.8%), and there had been 76-straight months of positive job growth.
Yes, there's so much news right now. And yes, there are so many other facts to check.		But more scrutiny is needed on this Trump line from today: 		"Look, I’ve been given a very tough hand. Because I came up here, we had an economy that was going down."
