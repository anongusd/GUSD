@JeremyKappell you can delete my tweets all you want, but YOU knew what you did when you said COON. For a split second, you thought it was cute. You know damn well that mixing ‚ÄúCoon‚Äù with ‚ÄúKing‚Äù was a Freudian slip. 		Your career is over! Enjoy the unemployment line #cnn #Racist
@waita2nd @JeremyKappell It‚Äôs lose, not loose. It‚Äôs KING, not COON. Your buddy @jeremykappell and yourself need English lessons.
@waita2nd @JeremyKappell Your response is baseless and without merit.
@waita2nd @JeremyKappell You‚Äôre a foolish patsy
