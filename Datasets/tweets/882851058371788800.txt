@legitngnews @MBuhari Buhari is a scam if only you people will understand, the @APCNigeria national chairman has already said it that every corrupt Nigerians should come to @APCNigeria and their sins shall be forgiven, so Buhari is not fighting corruption, but a corrupt President ever in NG history
@ogundamisi @cnni @CNN @BBCAfrica @SkyNews @foxandfriends @FoxNews @cnnbrk @XHNews @Reuters @ReutersAfrica If the CJN is corrupt, what about the  so called president himself, you guys are dondy
Suspending the CJN at this point in time is a total failure and a set back to Nigeria, @MBuhari you will never succeed coming back to power, if you like deploy Army to every voting center, you must not come back to power and for you @Laurestar you're a total disgrace to mothers

@Laurestar The fear of Atiku is the beginning of panic hihihi
@Laurestar @ProfOsinbajo Eya its too late, because Nigeria is about to be restructured, and have peace, love, and security  whatever he is saying is just a waste of time and energy, because it will not add any value to Nigeria anymore. I have  already been Atikulated kikikiki @atiku
@Laurestar Don't panic because you're about loosing your lifeless position as aid to Buhari, insulting people that are better than you and your master.  Get ready i know you are about to run to London where you will go and hide, to avoid arresting you because I know you will go to jail soon
@Laurestar How can 7000 delegates produce 14 million votes for @MBuhari	even the wife of the president @aishambuhari have asked Nigerians to vote wisely against  APC, that's to let you know that @MBuhari led administration has failed Nigerias, and we will not repeat the same mistake again
@aishambuhari You have spoken very well, but your husband and his entire cartel  should resign so that Nigeria will be at peace, because there's no peace in the nation
