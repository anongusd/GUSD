Could she really not know that that President Trump was simply enforcing the law which has been on the books for some twenty years, as did his predecessors before him (Obama and Bush), or is she just a liar with a forked tongue? https://t.co/jurgmrEa1Z

My son, a student at Harvard &amp; now Yale, has chosen to #WalkAway after personally experiencing the vehement intolerance of white males in the academic world.  He's now taking a temporary break from his education to help a conservative in her run for U.S. Senate.

@davidhogg111 @Texit_Now Thank God that you are not seeking to take away our semi automatic weapons, our hand guns, our AR15's, our "high powered" rifles, our "high capacity" magazines or the ammo to put into them. It is our God given to defend ourselves and our Constitutional right to be armed to do so.
@davidhogg111 @davidhogg111 Saving lives is what it is all about, and we advocate that the best way to do this is to allow individuals the right to be armed to protect themselves, their loved ones &amp; those for whom they are responsible from criminals who will get guns regardless of any laws.
