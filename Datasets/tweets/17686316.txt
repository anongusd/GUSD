@debbiebere the turbulent world around us is likened to the Mabul, we protect ourselves by building an 'ark' a sanctuary of family, Torah.
@debbiebere then from a scientific point of view we will only prove it's impossible and not learn the life lessons.
@debbiebere my point is, if it's not explored from a allegorical point of view with real life lessons to be learnt about good vs evil
@debbiebere if the world is 5774 years old...
@debbiebere the measurements based on whos interpretation? In what language was the story written in and who decides how much an AMO is?
@debbiebere The detailed measurements of Noahs Ark are allegorical to teach us how important precision and order matter.
