The FBI defines a mass shooting as 4 people killed (not including the shooter). Mass shootings occur in churches, in schools, at concerts, in waffle houses - just about anywhere. Except in other countries. https://t.co/gf8k8UAy1k
(4/4) Removing the assault and semi-automatic weapons from our Civilian society, instituting thorough background checks and mandatory waiting periods (and raising the buying age and banning the production of high-capacity magazines) are the ways to stop shootings in America.
(3/4) The local police say a man at the scene wrestled his gun away - looks like you don‚Äôt need to arm a teacher (or a resource officer) to stop a shooting. There goes the sales pitch for @SmithWessonCorp ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
