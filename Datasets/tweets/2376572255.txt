@JhawkChalk89 @Gcarmi21 I hope it works out. He has the talent, he just needs to give as much effort to the off the field responsibilities of being a teammate too. I'm not going to judge anyone I don't know, but his first 2 years leave a lot of room for doubt. Hopefully he grows into the man he can be.
@Gcarmi21 To me, the team should have traded Kirk when they still could have recouped more than just a 3rd,and never should've given up so much to get Smith, nor guaranteed a 35 yr old so much 💰. They totally misplayed the whole scenario, it's amazing Allen still has a job; He shouldn't.
@Gcarmi21 I can't agree with this. They dropped the ball on resigning KC on the cheap, then OVERPAID him for several seasons. They made an embarrassing trade for Smith that blew up in our face. Foster wasn't very good for the 49ers. Comp picks are not awards, they're compensation

@HttrPage @SportsCenter @wojespn Kyrie is great, but even without him they made it to the conference finals last year.

@wojespn Like how do they question Boston's loyalty to IT?, when they're trying to leave the team that drafted and has groomed him to go play for the Lakers? That's 100% percent choosing winning over loyalty just like Boston did with IT. If he wants to win, Boston is a great fit.
@wojespn Why in the world would he not want to play in Boston? The IT thing doesn't hold water, I get loyalty that was a brilliant trade. He hasn't done anything since they trade him.. for Kyrie. I wouldn't want to play for a team that gets fleeced on trades if winning is his goal.

@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC Oh well, tough break. Let's let everyone get back to work. Should've signed the deal last year when he had a chance. Decisions like that and you can see why he's had so many businesses fail. No wonder Ann Coulter makes fun of him. Shes right, he's just not any good at this.
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC Not quite, it's been moved into a holding company under a French company headed up by a guy that lead a coalition for Russia's rights in Crimea. That was already popped
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC So you're going to tell me 90% of news is fake, but 10% is real? Sounds a little nutty when you say it out loud huh?
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC I guess Trump is as bad a negotiator as Ann Coulter says he is then huh? He couldn't even get a wall out of Paul and Mitch last year when they tricked him into enacting the Sanctions against Russia by labeling the fence repainting as "border wall" then clearly writing NO NEW WALL
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC Define what liberal news is please
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC That's why it went to the house today. Why would we overturn sanctions ? Just because a bunch of senators got suckered into taking Russian money through the NRA? Nah, we have checks and balances
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC No one has a problem spending money securing the border, just not wanting money on a wall. Ryan and McConnell said no, why would things be different just because Ann Coulter used mean words this year?

@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC It was actually 362-53 they voted today to stop Trump from lifting the sanctions against that Russian Oligarch Deripaska,  I think I had said 352. My bad, just wanted to correct myself.
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC That's funny, I haven't too many ppl blame her. He said on TV he was going to OWN THE SHUTDOWN. Funny thing to say if he wanted her to take the blame. She's sent several bills and CRs through, McConnell won't take a vote. Seems weird to blame her, but whatever makes you feel good
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC Nope, Calling it like I see it. He agreed to the proceed with the existing budget and the Senate passed it, then Ann mocked him and suddenly he reneged on what he said. He couldn't get the money last year when it was all GOP, he's not getting it now. He's embarrassing himself.
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC Lol.. it's because Ann Coulter made fun of what a terrible negotiator he's been. This must be his way of looking more capable.  Oops.
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC When he finally gives in on his shutdown,  but that's not helping people now. Why does a Russian gangster take priority over the people securing our borders?
@Johnathin79 @PressSec @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerPelosi @CNN @MSNBC Really sad that there's more of an effort out of him to give billions of dollars to a Russian mobster that helped interfere against our election than to get paychecks into 800,000 working Americans

@HttrPage We have a nice nucleus to build on, but depth is continually an issue. We're always trading away trading draft picks &amp; plugging holes with FAs. The consistent winners build through the draft to create competition at every position. Trade away ppl b4 free agency to stockpile picks
