Because we all love a little competition. Who do you think did better at the @WaitWait smart speaker news quiz @arishapiro or @samsanders? We think it’s tough to call.
We think @NPRItsBeenAMin host @SamSanders knocked it out of the park with the @WaitWait smart speaker news quiz. How did YOU do? https://t.co/RzMF0jy9Tv
We put @npratc co-host @arishapiro to the test. He played the new @WaitWait quiz for smart speakers. Play along with him and see how many you can get. Any Patriots fans out there? https://t.co/o8Nt1MH1LI
Wait for it... @NPR’s favorite game show @WaitWait Don’t Tell me is now available as as a fully interactive game for your smart speaker. It's just like the podcast or radio show, but @PeterSagal and @BillKurtis1 can hear and respond when you shout at them.	https://t.co/bjaFLVLW4n

@NPR @iab @MichiganRadio In a cold case podcast coming in early 2019, two journalists from the South investigate a Civil Rights-era murder and must reckon with their white community's role in upholding systems of oppression and violence.
@NPR @iab @MichiganRadio 'Primer' provides the history we sometimes forget — or didn't know in the first place — of the events in the news and ideas dominating our national discourse.
@NPR @iab 'Believed,' from @MichiganRadio, is both an intimate look at how a team of female survivors, detectives, and prosecutors won justice and found their power, and an unnerving exploration of how well-meaning adults can fail to believe.
