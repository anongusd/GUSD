A spokesperson for Kraft said he didn't engage in illegal activity.
Police said they were not expecting such a high-profile suspect like Kraft. “We’re as equally stunned as everybody else.”
“It appears,” said police, that customers at the spa Kraft visited paid $59 for a half-hour and $79 for an hour.
This allegedly took place at a day spa in Jupiter, Fla. and police say they have video of "the act that took place."
This is part of a sting involving an international human trafficking ring, and at least 100 could be charged in connection. https://t.co/bzcmcwsDlz
