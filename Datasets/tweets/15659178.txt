And racially and ethnically motivated hate crimes reported to the FBI fell 48% between 1994 and 2015.
Americans appear far less racist than in the past. Only 4% of Americans supported inter-racial marriage in 1958. By 1997 that was 50%; today it is 87%. Inter-racial marriages climbed from 7 to 15 percent of all marriages between 1980 and 2010.
On this MLK Day, I did research on racism in the US. I'd be sad if the good Doctor's messages of love &amp; brotherhood had fallen on deaf ears. I found an interesting article in the Economist, a very liberal/Left-leaning publication, but the data in the article is enlightening.
