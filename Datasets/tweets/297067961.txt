That above trend growth rate last year? It's Keynes, not Laffer. And thus, it's fading as the fiscal impulse flattens. https://t.co/sq5PxfWwNt https://t.co/PYK180ZgAY
@GrampaMorris1 Good ?. See @DeanBaker13 on these points, and excerpt below. https://t.co/AqPd2mtf1a https://t.co/j8BOwIb1SS
How about a tax that raises significant revs, is highly progressive, and potentially quiets unproductive noise in financial markets? Well, here's a forthcoming proposal you'll want to learn about. I say we give it a Schat(z)!	https://t.co/HKjIWL9SdS
@ernietedeschi @JimPethokoukis @aaronsojourner It's just based on changes in fiscal impulse, ie, impact of changes in outlays on the deficit and thus G. The big, embedded assumption here is that Congress avoids the spending cliff later this year so no neg fisc impulse. I'd guess that's right but it's yet another risk.
Q4 GDP highlights: 2.6% annual rate over last quarter; 3.1% yr/yr (Q4/Q4). Beat expectations but down from earlier highs and signal of fading fiscal stimulus. Slowing from consumers (but still solid), net exports, housing (both worrisome). Prices still very "well anchored," Fed.
@aaronsojourner @ernietedeschi @JimPethokoukis From GS econ team, who track this carefully. https://t.co/uNRseMU7MI
So, whatever the Q4 data show, the admin can legitimately say the tax cut was in the mix in above trend growth last year. But all signs thus far suggest that's Keynes, not Laffer. Which means they're wrong about 3% forever and we're headed back down to trend growth of ~2%. [end]
The biz investment data have not been friendly to that scenario, but then again, the correlation between tax cuts, inv, productivity, growth has always been weak. And forecasts for both 18Q4 and later years also suggest 18 was a Keynesian story. https://t.co/LFmMBVzDYr
The theory of the case for team Trump is *NOT* that the deficit-financed cuts temporarily boosted GDP growth as Keynesian stimulus. It’s that it permanently boosted the supply-side growth factors: labor force and productivity growth.
But the underlying economic policy question (one that can’t be answered by a single GDP report) is not 3% vs &lt; 3%. It’s Keynes vs. Laffer.
Re Q4 GDP, out in a few minutes: The Trump admin is of course looking for 3% real growth in 2018. Most of us consider that measured as Q4(18)/Q4(17), though see @bencasselman for all the variants. [Thread] https://t.co/7hTb3Hpuy3

Rerunning this thread from yesterday. C'mon u*/y*/r* Twitter! Represent!	@sam_a_bell @hshierholz @DavidBeckworth @eliselgould @ernietedeschi @LHSummers @DeanBaker13 @joshbivens_DC 	https://t.co/gDY7hOvZSJ
@JHWeissmann @DanRiffle @paulkrugman My experience--full disclosure: policy work in DC--is that most want to get to universal coverage but some believe path dependency militates an incremental path while others think you can leapfrog existing stakeholders (and their powerful lobbies).
Who’s right?! What am I missing? Asking for a friend (really, about 75 million friends who depend on persistent full employment to get ahead). [end]
Many of us believe a flat PC improves the tradeoff from the perspective of the working class, but this rap suggests otherwise. Its logic essentially says: steep PC, costly tradeoff. Flat PC, also costly tradeoff!
Thus, if what’s pushing up inflation is not on the demand side (again, if it were, the PC wouldn’t be flat) then it must be on the supply side. And the Fed must—and often does—see through supply shocks.
But its logic eludes me. If the PC is truly flat (as much—not all—evidence suggests), then capacity constraints are not what’s juicing price growth. Conversely, if such constraints are responsible, then the PC is not flat.
The passage suggests that because the Phillips Curve (PC) is flat, reversing an “unwelcome” acceleration in inflation would be costly. The Fed would have to jam the unemp rate up many percentage points to stabilize prices.
The excerpt below is from a compelling, important, and highly readable speech by Fed Vice-chair Clarida. But I want to raise some questions about this part of the argument. [thread]	https://t.co/Ll5eGQq1NF https://t.co/e3d6YM3ljT
Opponents of the tax cut argued it wouldn't do much for biz inv. Instead, buybacks would rise, we said. Proponents disagreed. Then, when buybacks rose, they said "First buybacks, then inv." Still not seeing it, which was, as noted, predictable: https://t.co/ExCoPWJnGS https://t.co/Dwnjdlv2VX

Great point, Senator. If critics think this isn't the best way to push back on levels of inequality we haven't seen since the late 1920s (which, you'll recall, ended badly), they must either offer better ideas or stand down. Doing nothing is not an option. https://t.co/8VVCQIsPEK

@David_desJ @SenWarren @CitizenCohn Standard econ says just give em $: consumer sovereignty. Politics complicates things immensely. However, for low-inc HHs, certain in-kind benefits (eg, SNAP) are very fungible. I get into some of this here: https://t.co/IEx2yhSAcs
Highly enlightening thread on new @SenWarren universal child care plan. https://t.co/XwWicP8SyC
@DKinMN Yep. The key here is whether D group A feels that D group B is selling them out, and thus must be rigorously opposed, versus heading in the same direction, but at a slower, maybe more realistic pace.
EG, I think you have to go through Mcare for More to get to Mcare for All. Less path-dependent colleagues think otherwise (note: I'm old). No one knows who’s right, so let’s have it out! But the idea that having this argument tanks the D’s seems overwrought/wrong [end]
The key question this raises for the Ds is how path dependent is the base/broader electorate? IE, I believe the candidates are all headed in the same direction, but they disagree how quickly we can get there.
Sue me if I’m being too Kumbaya-ish, but I see little problem with a large, D primary that runs from moderate to very progressive, given their common thread: banish Trump, reinstate functional gov’t to meet the challenges we face. [thread]

This is there for all to see re their tax cut strategy. Cut taxes on the rich and when the deficit rises, argue we must cut benefits for the poor/middle class. In other words: *Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor!!*
All this “socialism” name calling must be seen for what it is: substance-free fear-mongering by Republicans who want to redistribute as much or more of our resources than Democrats. They just want to redistribute it upwards. [thread]

Because corps can just pay out more dividends if buybacks are blocked, taxing dividends (and other income from wealth) at normal/higher rates must be part of such plans, as they mention in their piece.
I view this as a response to 3 things: rising inequality (stock markets holdings highly skewed), weak corp investment, and fact that Trump tax cuts boosted buybacks, not worker pay or corp investment.

@MarcGoldwein @mettlinger @WilliamGale2 4. Of course, as @mettlinger implied, those in my camp *don’t want to cut* spending on soc ins, anti-pov, public goods. Also, R’s happy to aggressively/recklessly cut non-def discr. But the Y to N in R box is real and dispositive of the revs case, IMHO.
@MarcGoldwein @mettlinger @WilliamGale2 3. But the *revealed preferences* are as below. For all their complaining, R’s (and D’s) happy to put spending on deficit—and they’ll continue to do so later this year, ftr. Thus, the only reliable path to paying for our revealed priorities, as I argued, in the one Y: more revs. https://t.co/nkjMUiCGUv
@MarcGoldwein @mettlinger @WilliamGale2 2. But here’s the other distinction I’m trying to draw, though I grant you it's pretty abstract. The conventional wisdom is as in the box below.

If there's a quantitative counter-argument, I haven’t seen it.
@NovelloAmanda Both household and corp “financial balance” (basically pvt income - pvt spending) better than you’d think given recent stories, meaning some cushion if bad ‘credit event’ should ensue. I’ll post some figures on this soon.

Behind the Fed's "don't just do something, stand there!" stance are other forces doing their tightening work for them.	--tighter financial conditions	--slower global growth	--Trumpian chaos (shutdown, trade war)	Tightening under those conditions would be "unnecessary roughness."
Powell/FOMC a bit more dovish than expected on both rates and runoff. Now he gets to go out there and say a) "everything's solid...not much to see...move along folks" and b) "Ok, ok...there's a headwind or two...but, hey, we got this!"

@M_SullivanTax You seriously need to reread my piece a lot more carefully. I didn't 'endorse' anything. To the contrary, I raised many cautions/concerns: "my support for the idea is conditional on such [tracking] data and what they show." Pls respect the nuance; it's in there on purpose.
So, at this moment, the only way I see to bring this craziness to a quick end is to make a lot more people feel its pain, also undermining the Trump admin's strategy of cherry picking gov't services to turn back on. 	Gov't workers, if you strike, WE WILL SUPPORT YOU. [end]
No question, it’s easy to tell others to engage in an illegal strike, though being forced to work without pay is a strongly mitigating factor. And this is civil disobedience, which has a storied history in this country, one particularly worth considering on MLK day.
But then I saw his key point: the one thing that could end this idiocy tomorrow would be a nationwide strike by federal workers, especially the TSA. Shutdown air travel and you un-shutdown the gov’t. Progressives, as he says, could join the strikers on the picket lines.
I’ve had it w/ the shutdown, but feel helpless as to what to do about it. When I first glanced at the @DLeonhardt piece about how a stronger progressive movement could make a difference, I was skeptical. Trump/McC won't be moved on this by a march. [thrd] 	https://t.co/8M4FnDZMZO

As the end of the Kochan quote suggests, a big factor behind the trends in the figure has been organized business/capital/gov’t prevailing against organized labor. New House D’s, take note: That’s a policy choice, not a preordained outcome. [end]
That sort of demand doesn’t exist today, right? WRONG! See work by Freeman and Kochan (below, my bold) showing millions of workers want a voice at work, which is kind of a ‘duh,’ actually.	https://t.co/TT24XubzBc	https://t.co/bdRze9NQP8 https://t.co/JqXCDQUTwv
So, how can we turn around this trend? Look back at the pop in the pub sector in the 70s. That’s widely believed to be result of political pressure that led to fed and state labor laws expanding pub sect collective bargaining rights along w/ pent-up demand for such rights.
Disturbing, but unsurprising, to see some lost ground at end of series for public sector. @hshierholz suggests this isn’t yet revealing the negative impact of the Janus decision, but it does reflect the ramped-up attack on public sector unions.	https://t.co/ARrCXOMJKK
Here’s a reason—I think a big one—why we have so much inequality and such inadequate pushback on the econ/political distortions driven by concentrated wealth/power: Data out this AM show historic lows in ‘all’ and ‘private sector’ unionization rates. [thread] https://t.co/19nAxxRKsb

Critical points here about the (totally predictable) impact of the tax cut on revenues. https://t.co/usOBLvLxIT
Just catching up on my @theindicator to hear brilliant Francine Blau holding forth on how raising US women's labor force participation is about supporting working moms (not work requirements!).	https://t.co/u4vJpfjPdZ	(Also: line at women's bthrm at AEAs: small sign of progress) https://t.co/7UrBiRzwws
The wiles of @CardiffGarcia and @svaneksmith get me to break my personal rule against timing recessions. With many a caveat, I think the near-term (6-9 mos) macro (wages, jobs, HHs &amp; corps financial balance) looks maybe, kinda, sorta OK:	https://t.co/gWFujmmWvg
OK, maybe a hedge or 2 or 3 or 10. But I make the case that the strong labor market, solid HH balance sheets, and US's relative low exposure to foreign growth means a NEAR-TERM recession doesn't seem too likely. Still, we should be ready for it wherever it is (which we're not). https://t.co/2MsQsPAtBr
Best thing you'll read today. I tried to make similar point in recent testimony in terms of "revealed preferences." But a) we do need new tax revs, and b) it's not "don't think it's important." It's "might help my opponent."	https://t.co/1VEWr3THN3	https://t.co/X78R86zzvk https://t.co/2rWYUOimEY
Nothing--I mean zip/nada/rien!--shd surprise from Trump admin. But I'll admit this latest abt how the shutdown is killing the economy was head-spinning. He explicitly owns it! Both chambers signed off on approps! This is the mugger blaming you if you force him to shoot you.
Building on the important tax revenue discussion started by @AOC: a set of ideas to progressively raise the revs we need to meet the challenges we face (including the...wait for it...FTT!).	https://t.co/C4kXbODQ67
@RonWyden You go, @RonWyden! A smart, new jobs policy to lastingly help those facing steep labor market barriers, even at low unemployment.
Clearly, shutdown serves R’s goal and thwarts D’s. It amps R’s message: “gov’t is broken!" (Ignore that we’re the ones doing the breaking…)	Eventually, shutdown will end, but its damage to gov't is lasting and asymmetric. [end]
Suppose party R wants to shrink and discredit gov’t, so as to deregulate industry, return tax revenues to R’s donor base, and discourage the electorate from supporting pro-gov’t Ds.
Suppose party D believes that a functional, amply-funded gov't is essential to meet the challenges we face--inequality, climate, rent-seeking, infrastructure, retirement security, hth care. Party D's success depends on the electorate sharing its views. On the other hand--[thread]

RT @rodrikdani: A new paper (with Rafael diTella): https://t.co/FpUfZajTyP. We gave respondents different vignettes about a factory closure…
But it doesn’t square with furloughed workers living paycheck to paycheck and the fact that 40% of HHs say they couldn’t come up with &gt;$400 in an emergency. Clearly, when we say ‘it’s a great economy!’ we need to say whose economy we’re talking about!

@JimPethokoukis What top tax rate do you want? You can tell me know or make me pull it out of you next time we mix it up at @CNBC!
First, people criticized AOC and other new D's for opposing PAYGO rules. Then, when she suggests a robust payfor (one I view as reasonable), they jump all over her again. She et al should thus be guided by the old Arab proverb: "the dogs bark, but the caravan moves on (.org)."
This funky little picture suggests the damage from economists' confident belief that the "natural rate" was 5-6 percent, or even north of 4. That misguided idea was the mortal enemy of working families for decades. 2/2
It's a non-linear world out there, peeps, one in which it takes sustained, low unemp to drive wage growth. Fig shows mid-level nominal wg growth and unemp, 2014-18, using non-linear fit line. No action on wages until unemp hits 4% on down. 1/2 https://t.co/MJfp2vYj3B

Much of my working life has been dedicated to demonstrating and elevating the benefits of full employment and the costs of slack, especially to those left behind. Thus, trends like this--showing mid-level wages finally catching a buzz at very low unemp--are great to see. https://t.co/7jA4hf5cnL
Q: Who's right about the US economy: the job market or the stock market? 	A1: Job market right about current economy; strong US consumer will sustain near-term growth.	A2: Stock market forward looking, reflecting lower 2019 corp earnings, Trump chaos, and who knows what else.
Looks like the job market didn't get the recession memo. Jobs up 312K(!); unemp up but mostly for good reason (more people in workforce), wkly hrs up, nom wages up 3.2%, 70% of pvt inds create net jobs. Strong report; very inconsistent with equity market's swoons.
@karlbykarlsmith Good point and important reminder not to try to predict recessions. What we can predict is if we're ready for one in terms of fiscal &amp; monetary policy, and state rainy day funds. I've argued we're not. https://t.co/5if23f99RP
@imillhiser She’s great. But Ian’s cold and aloof.
@DougHenwood Good point--wouldn't overweight this evidence and won't be surprised in BLS comes in well below ADP tomorrow. But broader point re strength of American consumer (in 70% consumption econ) still stands.
@cenkuygur @NancyPelosi @GOP Trust me, I'm sympathetic to anti-PAYGO arguments &amp; yield to no one in my disdain for austere fiscal policy. BUT, given Pelosi's acumen, she may be pursuing this because she's got a lot of members in her caucus who won't support progressive legislation without it.
ADP not eq to BLS,, but the former shows 271K jobs added in Dec., almost 100K&gt;expectations. Also, ADP surprises correlated with same in BLS payrolls. Underscores my point: US job market/consumer *NOT* signalling near-term recession. https://t.co/FtcCPl0p2i https://t.co/r0PLD2WxZP

@Noahpinion Have we really suppressed industrialism? So many policies favor finance (PE would crumble w/out interest deduction), pharma (@DeanBaker13 re patents), tech (IP protections), and more. When I was in gov't, every week saw visit from industry wanting some goodie or other.
@DerekSmalls13 Agree. One (probably unrealistic) hope for 2019 is that the media--more specifically, their readership, as you say--will finally contract a fatal case of Trump fatigue.
Of course, we must end the shutdown. But waking up to this headline in 2019 reminded me of how progressives must figure out how to get past mud-wrestling with Trump on his turf and get to crafting/promoting policies on our turf. https://t.co/vrVXj6R9qq https://t.co/b5ohOU7bsn
@measofnow Excellent question. There's not enough revenue up there, even at very high rates, to finance the jobs, safety net, and health care provisions progressives seek. Still, it's absolutely the right place to start, eg, by rolling back high-end windfalls from Trump/Rs tax cuts.

@Mike_Barnett Agree w/ you.
This ain’t our first trickle-down rodeo, and the outcomes thus far are just what those of us steeped in the folly of “supply-side” tax cuts have been arguing since Reagan. Let’s not be surprised by what we should have known was coming! [end]
So, what’s missing from these careful, fact-based analyses? HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE!
Moreover, Slate cites figure I’ve long emphasized: later next year, as deficit-financed tax cut and spending stimulus fade, growth will likely decelerate. This is the “end-of-sugar-high” scenario. https://t.co/m9PU0T9jaL
To be clear, some of these firms added jobs and raised pay, perhaps more than they would have otherwise (Apple, Walmart). But others have cut jobs and not done much on pay/bonuses. On net, these reports find nothing like the benefits to workers claimed by the cuts’ proponents.
NYT notes these tax windfalls to big corps, compared to what they would have owed under old tax regime (2018, q1-q3):	Walmart: $1.6 bn	Bank of America: $2.4 bn 	AT&amp;T: $2.2 bn	Verizon: $1.75 bn 	Apple: $4.5 billion
And WSJ shows that future investment plans, proxied by new orders, have “decelerated rapidly.” https://t.co/IzY8JgcKux
For the cuts to have more than near-term growth impacts, they’d have to boost biz investment a lot more than we’ve seen so far, though these are early days. Both WSJ and Slate show “muted” investment results, especially controlling for energy prices, which are set globally. https://t.co/qUXqBwpkIb
All 3 pieces document 3 clear impacts of the cuts so far (Slate summary below):	--big revenue loss	--surge in after-tax corp profits &amp; stock buybacks	--short-term economic stimulus https://t.co/HxhvkC0Gpz
As a late holiday gift, I’ll summarize 3 excellent articles evaluating the tax cut after 1 yr. (The quality of tax journalism is moving inversely to tax policy.) Still, all 3 miss 1 key point IMHO. [thread]	https://t.co/495RyDcwC0	https://t.co/YSeUcloozY	https://t.co/w53G5gzygj

@BiscuitRogers @JHWeissmann I agree re Trumpian populism, but the riots raise an important caveat. US progressive elites argue--w. good reason--the need for more tax revs, and not just from the top 1% (though that's the right place to start). Can't assume the base is with us on that.
@MinneapolisFed Sorry, but I find the committee's analysis to range from dogmatic to boneheaded.
My deeper dive into the jobs numbers. One conclusion: the "cause for a pause" just got another supportive data point. https://t.co/Ptp4JSHj7A https://t.co/DEoMNAbYpX
A reminder for those who see this jobs report as a downer: the 3-month pace (170K) of payroll gains, if sustained, is clearly strong enough to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate and thus, upward pressure on wage growth. Plus, it chills Fed hawks a bit.
Yet another in a string of solid job reports, though:	--the pace of job gains downshifted 	--average weekly hours ticked down slightly	--job and wage numbers below market expectations. 		Still: the underlying trend remains that of a labor market closing in on full employment.
@yuvalrosenberg I'm kvelling over here!!
@MESandbu @adam_tooze @nytimes @jzettelmeyer @ojblanchard1 @SMerler @M_C_Klein @Brad_Setser @heimbergecon @JWMason1 I definitely hear you--no one's saying every country with their own currency gets everything right! I think some of us wonder if coming out from under the structural burden of the currency union provides degrees-of-freedom/fiscal/regulatory space that could help.
@adam_tooze @nytimes @jzettelmeyer @ojblanchard1 @SMerler @MESandbu @M_C_Klein @Brad_Setser @heimbergecon @JWMason1 Great take, as usual. But I wonder, as I did with Greece back in the day: should leaving the zone be a more serious option in the solution set? Not at all trivializing the potentially massive impact of that choice, but there's something structurally wrong with this picture.
The stock market's a mess, the yield curve's flattening, oil's tanking, Trumpian chaos abounds, the Fed's tightening...is there any coherent signal in all this noise?! https://t.co/T7WkXOU3da
Markets: there is ZERO INFORMATION in anything Trump says or tweets! I know, if enough people think otherwise, then everyone has to play along. But wouldn't it be a better, saner, less volatile world in we all embraced this simple truth!?
@NYCitykid Maybe something to that, but recent recessions--including those predicted by inverting yc--certainly haven't a function of tight credit. To the contrary, they've been caused by imploding credit bubbles!
So, I conclude that while the yield curve may once again be signaling a recession out there somewhere, we don’t know when. We only know if we’re ready for it, which we’re not, especially re perceived fiscal space. [end] https://t.co/BC6pakQkWM
That said, one certainly doesn’t see overheating in the inflation data, and the cause for a pause at the Fed is only getting stronger (low wg/price passthrough, oil, global growth, trade chaos, housing).
I like the way economist Jan Hatzius recently put it (see below). https://t.co/nm012WOMXt
The yield curve is flat—10yr, 2yr just 10bps apart just now—and the market is tanking. So, I’m reupping this commentary on why the flattening yield curve is…hmmm…it’s not that it’s not worrisome. It’s more that its message is ambiguous. [thread] https://t.co/llcl0FFdWs
@_cingraham @JStein_WaPo Great way to frame this debate. Also: see kids, you do use geometry later in life!! 	One quibble: "That proposal has a large price tag: $1.4 trillion over 10 years." What's "large?" That's less than R's tax cut. Give context; consider long-term benefits!	https://t.co/4YHJ0CU4XJ
@jcft4 Mostly because the fiscal impulse fades post-2019, ie, the CHANGE in cuts, yr/yr, stops being positive. Also, they're not permanent--personal cuts largely expire post 2025, unless Congress blocks sunset. https://t.co/lbAFfsjiIY
@S_Rabinovitch Maybe, but that's giving him a lot of credit. I'd say it's more like I feel better if I stop hitting myself on the head with a hammer.
2/2 ...if the US economy slows, which it very likely will as fiscal stimulus fades next year (tax cuts were/are sugar high; not growth game-changer), look for him to back off a bit on tariffs, trade-war, etc.
1/2 I'm sure you'll think I'm attributing way too much foresight to Trump--and I'm sure you may be right--but I think the aggression of his trade war is + correlated to the US economy's strength. He creates headwinds when he's got tailwinds. So...

@ernietedeschi @DeanBaker13 @jasonfurman @StephanieKelton @aaronsojourner @hshierholz @isawhill @Brad_Setser @paulkrugman 2/2 Mine: 	The benefits of full employment redound to those who need them most.		The fiscal deficit is neither good nor bad: it's all about the context.		If it's got a * next to it, we don't know what it is within a policy-relevant interval. Ergo, we must be data driven.
@ernietedeschi 1/2 Let's start an econ thread: what are your "broken record" points? (@DeanBaker13 @jasonfurman @StephanieKelton @aaronsojourner @hshierholz @isawhill @Brad_Setser @paulkrugman etc.)
@Shauntice8 Neither economists nor anyone else can tell you when the next recession's coming (though absent further fiscal stimulus, growth very likely to slow late next year). What we can tell you is if we're reading for the next downturn....which we're not: https://t.co/NmnprWwrvJ
Some thoughts on the cause for a pause at the Fed. I'm for it, but I also think "anchored inflation" is an essential complement to very low unemployment (more precisely, I think they think that): https://t.co/VNIxITsT2R

Is there cause for a pause? @jasonfurman thinks so, and makes solid points here based on lack of price pressures, low labor share, strong $, weaker global growth. My guess is that Dec hike is live but after that, a data-driven Fed may take a powder on quarterly hikes. https://t.co/E6fOboGuxZ
@maytennis Nope--nothing I can see eg in Powell's speech.
@MattBruenig Don’t worry about me. I’m all in on cryptos!		Jk...
Jeez...Dow up 500+ points cuz Powell said funds rate is just below the Fed's "broad range" of estimates of neutral. Given that the effective policy rate is 2.2% &amp; the low end of range is 2.5%, this is factually equivalent to his saying today is Wednesday. Which it is (I checked).
@tnabielec According to this smart @joshbivens_DC paper, it goes the other way. Impact of Fed-induced lower unemp on inequality dominates asset price effects.	https://t.co/M8qWb4DeHm
@ylanmui Hey @ylanmui, Crack open that spreadsheet and tell us the average height of Fed chairs. Meanwhile, I’ll work on h* (Fed chair’s height at full@employment).
But Trump, a long-time debtor w/ a penchant for default, is whining about the impact of rates on higher debt service (which was 1.8% as share of GDP last yr; still below avg but rising). Well, then don’t add $2 trillion to the damn 10-yr debt with a wasteful, regressive tax cut!
I don’t have a problem with presidents jawboning the Fed. And there are good reasons to call for a pause in their rate hike campaign. But if he had to replace Yellen, the one unequivocally good thing Trump’s done for the economy is appointing Powell.	https://t.co/osQ5pgdupZ
Obviously, the Fed funds rate was at 0 under Obama because of the worst downturn since the Depression. As the economy closes in on full emp, of course they’re raising. This is totally standard stuff. If Trump wants to go back to 0, he also wants a big downturn.
Just a few slightly more serious points on this Trump WaPo excerpt below that everyone, myself included, is cracking wise at. [thread]	https://t.co/L72QvPHbDT https://t.co/iGzkEGrtOn
@Brynjo @ktumulty I hear you--we've all been garbled. But this still makes no sense. The Fed was at 0 under O because of the deepest downturn since Depression. They're raising now as we're closing in on full capacity. Plus, Trump's fingerprints all over the higher debt service he's whining about.
@ktumulty Thanks a lot, Karen. I just read that and it broke my brain. This stuff is like looking at an eclipse. You can't read it directly. You have to have someone between you and the text to be safe.
@MichaelSLinden Given the predicted 2020 slowdown (see link for #'s), whereas Trump's first campaign mischaracterized the strong economy as weak, his second campaign may well try to do the opposite! https://t.co/yaBedWtxIV
“Humility!” To my ears, as someone who’s been engaged in economic policy for three decades, that’s the most important word in the sentence. It implies learning from mistakes, a target-rich environment for economic policy. [end]
“Model of the economy” All economic models are wrong, but some are useful. The Fed has made real progress (props to Powell) in recognizing the Fault in Their Stars (u*, r*, y*). But here again, the choice of model determines who’s in, who's out.
“Incoming data” Ah, but which data? It is essential for policy makers to go beyond averages and look at distributions of wages, income, wealth, and even power. And racial/gender differences too! (Props to Yellen, ftr, on this, esp re inequality.)
“A monetary policy strategy” The Fed’s mandate is simple: full employment at stable prices. But using their tools to achieve it in a way that provides optimal welfare implies (to me and my friends) a strategy that upweights the well-being of the least advantaged.
I really like this sentence from R. Clarida’s speech today (new vice-chair of the Fed board). But it’s important to recognize (as he does) that this framework raises huge questions and each answer has inevitable distributional consequences. [thread] https://t.co/xDufqnkTzm https://t.co/J0saHtQN8q

@MESandbu @FT @fteconomics Smart piece on need for coordinated fiscal policy if global downturn deepens.

Critical fiscal caveat: it’s not that we won’t have fiscal space, it’s that we might not have PERCEIVED fiscal space. There’s nothing about debt levels themselves, whether they’re 40% or 80%, that undermines the functioning of countercyclical policy. https://t.co/jbyRQpJ5BZ [end] https://t.co/sLWg5uCgyV
It depends on when it hits/how deep it is, but “23 [states] are prepared for a moderate recession and another 10 are within striking distance...17 states are "significantly unprepared for even a small downturn." This is a moving target, but it's also an underappreciated problem.
No, we’re not. As the WSJ's figures suggest, both monetary and fiscal responses may well be inadequate. Though I’ve an important caveat re fiscal, these concerns are well known. But what about state preparedness?
I start my work day with coffee and a Shott, i.e., Jeff Sparshott’s excellent Real Time Econ newsletter. https://t.co/A3NKs0LlWR Today’s version dug into a question with which I’m a bit obsessed: are we ready for the next recession? [thread]

@JHWeissmann @ylanmui A Keynesian is a Republican looking at fading fiscal stimulus in a year that’s a multiple of 4.
@ylanmui Ironically, their tax cut is providing temporary stimulus. Infrastructure would be direct investment in our deteriorating stock of public goods.
Punchline: I’m less worried about overheating or global exposure than incompetent political leadership should a downturn occur. We’ve squandered our fiscal policy; the Fed, who may again be jammed by the zero bound on its policy rate, can only do so much.
EG, as fiscal stimulus fades in late 2019, growth will slow by around 1 point. Higher interest rates already slowing housing sector. Trump’s trade war is putting upward pressure on the trade deficit, which shaved 1.8 ppts off GDP last quarter. https://t.co/5PPQsUk5KW
With exports of just 12% of GDP (compared to eurozone’s 28%), we’re somewhat insulated from global slowing. More important is our 70% consumer spending economy, supported by tight job market. But, risks exist here too.
Global growth jitters abound: Germany, Japan just posted negative GDP quarters, eurozone up 0.7% last quarter, oil price tanking, China slowing. But what does in mean for the US? [thread] https://t.co/0yxzS1dd0p
@OriginalBonddad @CardiffGarcia How's this, or do you mean even longer? https://t.co/lwqwJPJIal
This puts pressure on all our fiscal challenges, from infrastructure, to disaster response, to safety net/social insurance, to recession readiness. Thus, a critical job for new House is to start planning for the day when the politics will allow us to restore lost revenues.
It’s not the old “crowd-out” (public borrowing crowds out private), though high levels of federal borrowing are now contributing to slightly higher interest rates. It’s a much more nefarious play, and it’s a twofer: give unto the donor base, while starving the Treasury.
With growth north of 3% and unemployment south of 4%, the deficit should be falling. Why does that matter? @CardiffGarcia and I get into the details here: https://t.co/spFF5l7VnC
You don’t want to make much out of jumpy, monthly deficit numbers. But the increased deficit in Oct. is a reminder that the tax cut broke an important connection between economic growth and gov’t revenues. [thread] https://t.co/Y7jvXO2f59
Fun, useful fact: if you’re really nice to the flight attendant, you will often get an extra snack, like another bag of jetzels.
The price of oil is down about 20% over the past 6 wks. That's a consumer boon at the pump and helps boost real wages. But oil's market cost&lt;social cost, and post-midterms, we need to start a real conversation about this: https://t.co/nCYa4iAKGZ
@AbsterYinYang Yep! That's also in Arrow, '63!! One very important implication is that these "skin-in-the-game" notions--high cost-sharing to force consumer choice--don't map effectively onto this policy space.
@steve_bannister Yep. We spend about 18%; they spend closer to 10%; difference of 8% is my point in the thread.
That calls for capitalizing on our remarkable win by protecting and shoring up Obamacare while building on Arrow’s insights by moving more coverage to the public sector, through state Mcaid expansions and Medicare for More...and more...and more! [end]
Finally, while we’ve won on the logic, the uniquely hybrid US system requires more guardrails. EG, Strong incentives exist along the health-care delivery chain to inflate prices, which is why we spend about 8% of GDP (~$1.6 trillion/yr) more than others w/ no-better outcomes.
All lies, of course, but it shows that the rational left has won the health care argument. The ACA isn’t going anywhere for now, but there's still ongoing sabotage by those who've never stopped dreaming of killing the program and claiming its resources. https://t.co/xWdqhB6QOg
And remember, even as they are trying in the courts to nullify the ACA, R’s pretended to support it during the campaign. In one rally, Trump warned a crowd to vote for Rs because “the Democrats would obliterate Obamacare!” https://t.co/h59eGkYoeJ
Medicaid is supposed to be hated by the conservative right, yet @sarahkliff points out (link above) that half-a-million people, mostly in red states, may soon be newly covered by it. And its benefits are becoming ever more widely known. https://t.co/XcbXkbP3Ke
People in states both blue and red get this on some level, even if, like in Idaho, only 35% of voters liked the ACA while 75% wanted the Medicaid expansion (which won with a strong 61%). https://t.co/IWOrCFsLOt
...which will require subsidies for those who must be in the pool but can’t afford it. For the poor and elderly, broad coverage requires publicly-provided Mcare and Mcaid.
First, in order to have affordable coverage for all, the well must subsidize the sick (which is how all insurance works, ftr). In our public/pvt system, this calls for risk pooling...
Boom—that’s it—HEALTH CARE IS NOT A NORMAL MARKET GOOD. Sorry for screaming, but Ken Arrow revealed this truth back in the 1960s. What are the implications of that insight? https://t.co/FUACPfjuZU
It starts with this simple realization: if you show up to the supermarket hungry, they don’t have to feed you. If you show up to the emergency room sick, they have to treat you.
One of the remarkable, uplifting lessons of the midterms is that the logic of publicly-provided health care Trumps the most heated partisanship of our time. What is that logic? [thread]

@AnnieLowrey Re "economy starting to soften," here's a figure I just made of standard-issue forecasts. If they're right, as deficit-induced-sugar-high fades late 2019, so does growth. https://t.co/MuZ6rf1907
RT @PatcohenNYT: Here's how the Democratic House will affect the economy. https://t.co/aWiQtSRdrL
@KennethBaer The benefits of ARRA live on!	Payfors from closing tax loopholes is a target rich environment, but Twitter not a good place to get into deets. I'll have tons on this forthcoming. Also, should note: min wg increase usually scores as about 0 budget costs.
@KennethBaer One good idea is to raise fed gas tax, unchanged in nominal terms (!) since 1993. Trump and Chamber have supported this, btw, so it’s got bi-partisan legs! Whaddya say??
Excellent advice from someone who knows of what he speaks. 	Tiny amendment: on infrastructure, repairing existing public schools as important as building new ones. https://t.co/FP2Xdy3Sqc https://t.co/1pHdNv1ouN
Two important lessons I take from last night, one +, one -.	+: There's a lot more purple out there than I dared to hope.	-: The Senate and the electoral college are highly unrepresentative and hugely powerful. (eg, There were millions more D votes than R's for Senate last night)
Medicaid expansions in Idaho, NE, Utah! Significant min wg increases in AZ, MO! TX looking way more purple than formerly imaginable. Oh yeah..the House. Yes, we're a divided country; we knew that. What we know today is that democracy still has the potential to get back on track.
If you need a wonky distraction before the polls close, may I suggest my analysis of whether faster wage growth will pashtrough to prices? The data say: not so much.	https://t.co/h5pd7hL2jr https://t.co/Ej0eN79d5g
All these subnational increases have given researchers the change to run quasi-experimental designs on the impact of the wg hike. The findings show the policy largely has its intended effect, raising the pay of low-wage workers with little (not nothing) displacement. [end]
Today, Arkansas and Missouri have min wg increases on ballot and they’re polling well. That tells me a few things:	--as the Fed min wg remains stuck at $7.25 since 2009, state/city min wg hikes are popular in unlikely places;	--today isn’t just about Trump;	--and…
Here's a cool fact I didn't know: "Since 1996, no state has voted down a minimum wage increase that has appeared on a statewide ballot, a signal of the appeal for raises across the political spectrum." [Thread] https://t.co/lxjOUU6Fnv
@TimBartik No question: there's a lot of interest in the cost/benefits of these deals, and bringing muscular, Bartik-type analysis strikes me, at least, as important. Obviously, many in this debate are uninterested in the facts, but we're not gonna let that stop us!
Are you:	--more trusting of others?	--more "we're in this together" vs. "you're on your own?"	--better represented in national politics?	--hopeful about the future?	--confident that we can meet the existential challenges we face, most notably climate change?
But given how divided we’ve become, and the rise of blatant and even murderous hate, should we not also ask another set of questions?
As an economist, I get the “Are you better off than you were X years ago?” question. In that context, here’s @DeanBaker13 and I on the extent to which presidents influence near-term outcomes. (Hint: not much). (Thread)	https://t.co/GGixxKcImf
@TimBartik Important finding! You gotta paper/blog post? Something to amplify this.
Here's @DeanBaker13 and I on a timely issue: at this point in the expansion, how much do presidents actually have to do with near-term economic outcomes? (Answer: not so much...)	https://t.co/MouaHhi8kD
Trump's closing argument--"Barbed wire, used properly, can be a beautiful sight”--aptly captures the stakes. 		If you read nothing else today, pls read this: https://t.co/itqz9OllBA
@MichaelSLinden @JenniferWexton I know this isn’t about you but I’m still gonna say it: you go, @MichaelSLinden!!!!
@HalSinger The question I ponder, as an offender in this space, is if it's possible to both celebrate the standard metrics--it actually is a very good thing for disadvantaged groups when unemp stays very low--and challenge them, by also focusing on dist, climate, limits to GDP, race, etc.
When *do* presidents matter most to the economy? In recessions, when counter-cyclical fiscal policy needs to quickly offset the negative shock. I have zero faith that this president and congressional majority will get that right. [end]
Also, Trump trade war, as predicted (@Brad_Setser ), is contributing to larger, not smaller, trade deficit (which, ftr, took 1.8 ppts off of GDP growth last quarter). https://t.co/SYdXIcVo5M https://t.co/wIGe4ItfAj
Plus, most of that stimulus is worsening after-tax inequality. Real hourly wages for mid-wg workers up 1% since Trump took office. Real after-tax corporate profits, up 15%.
Yes, tax cuts and all that deficit spending are juicing growth, but it’s sugar-high, not lasting growth, as figure below predicts (h/t Alec Phillips). Other evidence for this claim: investment spending, associated with more lasting growth, nothing special since tax cuts. https://t.co/UsbT8jS6xA
Instead, the macroeconomy runs on a virtuous cycle, wherein consumer demand—70% of US GDP—creates jobs which pay wages which create more demand. Note how yr/yr change in aggregate real pay tracks real consumer spending. https://t.co/afAKIe7AZ0
Fun fact that’s kinda germane right now: At this point in the business cycle, presidents have *WAY* less impact on the economy than they take credit for. [thread]
My longer take on jobs report https://t.co/DKojheN3mF
Let me try to put this whole "Trump's great labor market" nonsense in context. First, he inherited it. Second, and this is much more important, I guarantee you it’s possible to achieve full employment without all the hate.
Pretty much everything you could want in a monthly jobs report. Payroll gains way better than expected, nice pop in labor force participation, wage growth continues to strengthen, finally beating inflation (real gains!). Score 1 for "room-to-run" crowd!
@DeanBaker13 Yep--always a possibility in hi frequency analysis. But I've got solid evidence which I'll trot out shortly--won't surprise you at all--of wage growth clearly responding to diminished slack.	Key point: this isn't creating price pressures: https://t.co/Dm52NS1Z6f
It's a big mistake to conflate wage gains with price pressures. Exhibit A is this AMs productivity report (look only at yr/yr changes, pls). Growth of pay per unit of output (unit labor costs) ticked DOWN slightly last quarter, an indicator of non-inflationary wage growth! https://t.co/Fefaid5hcl
@Brad_Setser @jasonfurman @MESandbu Yep--@MESandbu's column highly stimulating (ha!). I'd have added extra fiscal to avoid pushing on a string (very low credit, but still not enough demand to get people to take advantage of it; @jasonfurman will correctly note that there was a lot more fisc stim than the ARRA.)
@GagnonMacro Or, given non-linearities you’ve pointed out, if the price PC develops a slope, then it shouldn’t necessarily take that much higher unemp to reel in faster inflation. 	But again, to be clear, even with these confusions, I found their case to be somewhat convincing.	(end)
@GagnonMacro What is the right tool? Depends on the inflation shock. But if it’s, eg, Trump’s dumb trade war, then it would sure suck if a bunch of people had to lose their jobs to offset tariff-induced price pressures.
@GagnonMacro In that context, using high unemp to fix high inflation with a flat PC is like using a hammer to put in a screw. You can do it, but it’s the wrong tool and you’re likely to break something.
@GagnonMacro As I understood it, the paper argued that because the price Phillips Curve (PC) is so flat, if inflation took off, it would take very high unemp to get it back down. But if the PC is so flat, then what is it that shocked inflation? Not unemployment, right?
@GagnonMacro (Thread) Hey, Joe! While I'm sympathetic to the case that tapping the brakes now could avoid slamming them later, I found Erceg et al 40% convincing and 60% confusing.
The court calls Ms. Dove and Mr. Hawk in the case of Pause v. Hike, Judge JB, supreme decider of all things economic, presiding: https://t.co/YZNBzplLv7
Phillips Wage Curve awakens; price curve still snoozing: 	New data show tight labor market generating solid, gradual gains. Pvt sector wages up 3.1% yr/yr, 10-yr high, while Fed's favored inflation gauge is locked-in at 2% target. https://t.co/zABerua7SF

@BeatConfusion Figure below--various trend indicators of price growth--shows maybe a slight drift up if you squint hard enough, but for now, little question that price expectations remain anchored around the Fed's target. https://t.co/DoCYU7lf2l
@thomascbowen Do you mean: even if pausing makes sense, they can't do it because it looks like they're doing Trump's bidding? That's a real risk, but ignoring Trump--their stated policy--means precisely that: doing what they judge to be right regardless of political noise.
Central econ debate: Should Fed target unemp gap (and thus raise rates) or inflation (and perhaps pause). New data show core inflation locked in at Fed target of 2% for 5th month in a row, even as unemp falls to 50-yr lows. Score one for pause?? https://t.co/vMVfxAxMCm
The politics of fear is a powerful, effective strategy that's in play not just here, but across the globe. The problem is it elects non-representative leaders with no clue how to govern: https://t.co/aX91fWQWGm
n/n After considerable deliberation, the jury is back with its verdict: ”we support the motion for a pause as, for now, the upsides dominate the downsides. (Though that Trump one wasn’t easy…!)"
7/n The biggest fear of all: deanchoring inflation expectations. The symmetry point assumes hitting the target on average. Deanchored inflation means an overshoot and this is the nightmare of contemporary Feds, who treasure anchored inflationary expectations.
6/n Pausing could suggest they’re listening to Trump and compromising their independence, a point that about a million media analyses would press. 	Objection: Not listening to Trump means just that. It doesn’t preclude a pause if that’s what the economy needs.
5/n Arguing against the motion: The Fed has been clear in forward guidance that, barring a shock, they'll stick to their rate-hike schedule. A surprise pause could signal markets their more negative on the economy than most of them, especially Powell, have been saying.
4/n There’s room-to-run in the job market, as per the prime-age employment ratio. As @CardiffGarcia and I argue here, testing the capacity waters can possibly create more capacity. https://t.co/spFF5l7VnC
3/n As @neelkashkari argues, wage/price pressures remain low/moderate, and most importantly, Fed should be symmetric around the inflation target. See below: https://t.co/VI1EvAG2PR
2/n @jasonfurman makes a good case for a pause based on the fact that the rise in Treasury yields since the FOMCs last meeting have done the Fed's brake-tapping for them. Same dynamic is in play with rising dollar, which dampens price pressures.	https://t.co/Ez7DxXX3VB
1/n Let’s look at both sides of @neelkashkari’s argument that the Fed should strongly consider a pause in rate hikes.	https://t.co/H4gT27czba	Arguing for the motion:
@RonaldKlain Truth! Using less volatile yr/yr real growth rates, GDP up last quarter by 3%; under Obama, in 2015Q1, up 3.8%. Oh, and deficit to GDP FY2015 was -2.4%, compared to -4% today.
@MeierJay Your key point is that journalists are...people!! And often very good ones, at that.
@MeierJay Hmmm--definitely a lot softer under the hood. But hard to get to "horrible" with PCE (70% of GDP) still strong and supported by near full-emp labor market. But the inflation # (1.6% core) could really give the Fed some "pause" if you catch my drift...
@MeierJay Important point I meant to add! Biz inv flat and residential, a negative last quarter. Again, noisy, but breakout biz inv story re tax cuts still not in the data. Fed rate hikes surely in the housing inv result.
GDP up 3.5% last quarter and underlying, recent trend now a solid 3%. But there are soft spots in the report: Jumpy inventories a big contributor (+2 ppts) and trade deficit subtracted 1.8 ppts. Note also that core infl slowed (!): 1.6% annualized.
Today's reading: a muscular argument from @neelkashkari for Fed rate-hike pause. https://t.co/H4gT27czba	Today's listening: He gets some of the same issues we do in @theindicator podcast, including the possibility of discovering new economic capacity. https://t.co/spFF5l7VnC

@ernietedeschi @UpshotNYT Agree! #3 very important to me. Those who cite the productivity constraint on wg growth must recognize that there's room for non-inflationary wage growth through re-balancing labor share. https://t.co/Garcxx8upN
I wish Trump would stop jawboning the Fed--his critiques are wrong, especially: they're "too independent!" BUT, given the importance of Fed policy to people's economic lives, they're not off limits. https://t.co/qjzXqr2R2b
@ernietedeschi @UpshotNYT 2/2 It's largely the smoothed productivity growth that "solves the mystery." Yet, this series is so smoothed that it slowly drifts up and then down. Does that mean slow prod growth explains the slowdown or is just working like a flexible trend variable?
@ernietedeschi @UpshotNYT 1/2 Excellent, thorough analysis! One weedy, but germane, point: If you run the Yellen NABE model, say through 2010, and forecast forward, it predicts quite accurately. So, less of a mystery if you accept that specification (which is complicated/constrained). But...
@vrajshroff @theindicator @CardiffGarcia @svaneksmith Alert the authorities!!! The Bernstein rule--if you voted for the tax cut, you can't complain about the deficit--is being fragrantly violated by R's targeting Soc Sec and Medicare!!
RE the headline: no, no, NO! On covering pre-ex, R's are lip-syncing, not singing.

@greenhousenyt D'oh!! See "GOP Hypocrisy on Obamacare" here: https://t.co/Ex9KlDIMvc
5/n Look, I get it. Especially in the age of Trump, “politicians lie!” is not breaking news. But they’re not even trying. It’s not just dishonesty, it’s slothful dishonesty which must be called out, esp as coverage of pre-ex is a huge advance that must be protected.
4/n Ron gives an essential history of the R’s efforts to kill pre-ex, and I try to add a bit of nuance on phony plans that pretend to cover pre-ex, but actually gut it. Read this from the excellent @sarahL202 for some background: https://t.co/Uu0dcatX7R
3/n He’s got that Packer’s jacket on and he gives this folksy rap about how as long as he’s gov, he will “always cover pre-ex conditions.” Because “it’s just the right thing to do.” Meanwhile, HIS AG, WITH HIS SUPPORT, IS PART OF THE SUIT TO REPEAL THE ACA.
2/n Note the part of about how the Trump Justice Dept. has joined the Attorneys General’s lawsuit that’s trying to get the ACA declared unconstitutional (thus, of course, dropping pre-ex coverage requirements). Pay particular attention to the Scott Walker segment (~3:15).
1/n Check out this segment from the @TheLastWord last night, where @Lawrence, @RonaldKlain (one of my heroes, ftr), and I talk about the intense, ongoing, lying campaign about preserving pre-existing conditions in the ACA. https://t.co/7rGFNZBOWW

The recent deficit stories confirm that we're into some weird macro: upside-down Keynesianism, or stimulating an economy already closing in on full employment. Here's a longish essay on what I make of this experiment: https://t.co/9phuuc9kbZ https://t.co/ErIfOvhNAU
@Neil_Irwin Who'd a thunk it?
@nowherenorthere That '68 gap is due to spending on the Vietnam War (there's an earlier gap for Korea too). I should have labeled it in the figure, but it's obviously different than the structural split caused by the tax cuts.
Trump and the Republicans have severed a critical fiscal connection: the one between strong economies and lower budget deficits. https://t.co/LaMeVwKOsY https://t.co/e0NFBZdW13
True! And when you see "entitlement reform," read those weasel words as "I plan to cut Social Security and Medicare to help offset the cost of our tax cuts!" @hiltzikm has long been onto this scam: https://t.co/WgAko2Iwp4 https://t.co/OH8NdqTSPy
(n+1)/n As progressives, woe betide us if we cannot block and reverse this transparent fiscal BS. If you're defending in bball, and your opponent in effect tells you, "I'm going to pump fake, then drive right" and you can't stop them, you belong on the bench.
n/n This shouldn’t be “breaking news." Of course tax cuts whack revenues. In fact, that’s the R's strategy: enrich the donor base while starving gov’t of the revs it needs, then plead fiscal poverty as a rationale for cutting social insurance.
5/n In fact, the average deficit/GDP over every year since the late 1940s that the unemp rate was &lt;=4.5% is -0.4%. If I take FY2017/18 out of that average, it’s a small surplus (0.1%). This is my key point: federal revenues have been and should be pro-cyclical.
4/n But CBO also thought—remember, this is pre-tax-cut—we’d collect 17.7% of GDP in revs when the actual was 16.5%. So, there’s the difference between what we expected and what occurred.
3/n R’s will point to the spending bars, but here’s where the “baseline"--what we expected to be spending pre-tax-cut--comes into play. CBO expected, before the cuts, that we’d spend 20.5% of GDP this year, almost exactly right.
2/n Here are the #’s: In FY2018, the unemp rate was 4%, the same rate as in FY2000, but as you see in the figure, revs/GDP in 2000 were 20% and only 16.5% this year. https://t.co/R2WiC3WPC6
1/n I want to bring the economy into this deficit discussion, specifically this point: at or near full employment, revenues should be above average. But because of the tax cut, they’re not this year. That is, Trump and the R’s broke the critical pro-cyclical fiscal stabilizer.

@tnabielec Good ?. Much lower statutory rates on wealth, virtually all the loopholes the Trumps used still in place (eg, GRATs), and--very big here--the IRS is significantly less well-funded given the # of filers and heightened extent of wealth concentration/tax havens.

@heilmanbytes Shakespeare, I ain't.
My pretty deep dive into the jobs report. I found a lot to like in this hot-but-not-too-hot job market. Only one indicator is giving me pause, but you have to slog through it to see which one! https://t.co/uGaYc8YHBZ
The black unemp rate, at 6%, only slightly higher than its all-time low of 5.9%  in May. In recession, black unemp hit almost 17%; it's now down ~11 ppts, close to 2x the ~6 ppt decline of overall rate. A critical reminder of the benefits of full emp to less-advantaged workers.
Shake off the 134K on jobs (Florence could be in there a bit); 3-mos avg is ~190K, ie, strong. And 3.7% on unemp is real, ie, not due to labor force exits. 2.8% on wages pretty good too...in other words, yet another solid report. More to come!
Just throwing one pre-jobs forecast out there, as I "sit on shpilkes," waiting for the report. Even after this AMs release, we won't know this until later in the month (when Sept inflation is released), but I suspect real wages grew, yr/yr, in Sept.

@rkgwork Strongly agree. Very poorly put on my part. My thinking was policy makers never focus of this obvious, simple, critical policy. But you're of course right about this moment.
I know the news isn't focused on minimum wages this morning, but it should be. New research shows that the combination of low unemployment and higher min wgs is a one-two knockout punch for wage stagnation among low-wage earners: https://t.co/sp8kBT18iO https://t.co/o6QJSCouvd
@DavidBeckworth Nice! I'm for any target with a memory. Rigid inflation target lacks memory. Flexible target remembers, as does NGPDLT, price-level, etc. As the risk of invoking Twitter rage, I suspect that at the end of the day, it's memory that matters more than which variant you choose.
Enjoying Powell's clarity/humility re what we don't know (ie, any variable with a star: u*, y*, r*). But re Fed's inflation projections, I'd love to see forecast go north of target for awhile. 2% not ceiling! Thus, never going above 2% (or 2.1%, as in SEP) creates deflation bias.
n/n --Dollar would tank.	--All the Fed reporters would have to rewrite their articles, including all sorts of speculation re Trump getting into the FOMCs heads.
2/n --Equity markets would tank because Fed thinks economy isn’t as strong as traders thought; bond yields fall in flight to safety.	--Equity markets soar because they love the unexpected accommodation; bond yields rise in risk-on rally.
1/n We’re all sure that Fed’s going to raise their target rate to 2-2.25% today, but just for fun…what if they didn’t? What do you think would happen (other than Fed twitter would explode and forward guidance would be hugely discredited)?
@Econ_Marshall 3/3 Second, by elevating consumers above workers (and not recognizing people are both!), anything that lowered prices was good. As per trade with low-wg countries, this meant ignoring other economic theories (Stolper/Samuelson) and evidence showing that prices mapped onto wages.
@Econ_Marshall 2/3 ...to this day (though this is getting better), economic models rarely implicate financial markets in rent seeking, as the sector is assumed—against obvious evidence—to just be efficiently allocating capital to its most productive uses.
@Econ_Marshall 1/3 Getting at bit into the plumbing of this, first, economics inveighs against “rents”—roughly being paid more than you’re worth in terms of marginal product. Rents bad, thus unions (and minimum wages) bad. But…

@DeanBaker13 Interesting! If you're right, we'll surely significant real wage gains soon, and not just at the top, especially if unemployment falls (which I expect to be the case).
@DeanBaker13 Another way of saying same thing: look at median line in Fig 1. I see 1 really good year out of nine. You?
@DeanBaker13 My point is base-year choice matters when you have a big outlier like that. More relevant going forward is with inflation now in 2.5-3 range, we'll need nom median comp growth of ~4% to hit 1.4 real. That's possible in these data; 2018 nominal growth, median comp: 3.9%
@DeanBaker13 True, but almost 3/4's of that came from one change--2014-15--when inflation was about zero. Real median comp up 4.2% that year, compared to avg 0.5%, 2015-18 (when inflation was in more normal range). Still, good to see the growth!
Nerd Alert! This is not a test!!	New BLS data show real compensation data by percentile--comp, wages, and benefits! Here's my initial analysis (median stagnation, huge benefits disparity, some nice gains at low end...) 	https://t.co/5iFLN1bI75 https://t.co/lNxOjVFs3b
@DanRDimicco I hear you, and agree that we need to play defense (tariffs ain't it, however). Problem is, we've forgotten how to play offense.

@NoomanHaque You could say it's the gov't's estimate of the cost of the DW loss to farmers from the tax (tariff).
This AM, note from @GoldmanSachs econ predicts that 10% tariff raises yrly inflation rate by just 3 basis points (3 one-hundredths of a ppt; just 22% of the $200 bn in Chinese imports are consumer goods). Still bad policy, but price impact may be less than people expect. https://t.co/5Cd2qGMtEg
@AlanReynoldsEcn I hear you! But what evidence have u got? It doesn’t help our case to raise alarms that we can’t substantiate.
More than my economist peers, I've long argued that trade has downsides. But I don't think tariffs solve any of them. That said, $200bn&lt;10% of goods imports; *10% (tariff rate)*these goods % of cons spending*price pass-through...maybe adds 0.1ppt to inflation.
@tnabielec Agree with @LHSummers that biz conf is "cheap stimulus" (though not when it cost $2t in tax cuts!) but don't find this pic that convincing. Capex flat pre-recess, then tanks, then wiggles around "20". Also, your capex doesn't quite follow BEA (realized) biz inv.
@tnabielec Lemme see a plot of biz confidence against capex. Not snark, btw...genuinely interested.
@tnabielec Agree that recent data are persuasive re tax cut/100% depreciation (not deregulation! what evidence do you have for that?) in the mix re 2018 capex pop.  But ftr, biz inv as share of GDP just back to pre-recession peak. https://t.co/papmWVnyok

2/4 Next, this new ITEP analysis shows who wins and who doesn't from two different tax plans, only one of which has been passed and you know which one. The other is a Sen Brown/Rep Khanna idea to significantly increase the Earned Inc Tax Credit. https://t.co/7Mbraa3mxm https://t.co/Jy1mHdzHGv
1/4 Let’s look at 3 figures. First, this Census slide from yesterday’s release (tweaked for survey redesign) shows how real median household income has wiggled around since 2000 but basically remains at the same level, ~$60K. It hasn’t grown in real terms in almost two decades. https://t.co/tWyImwrC8D
It's true! And it makes the point that adding work requirements to anti-poverty programs just creates one more needless, bureaucratic barrier for the poor to leap over, as if they don't have enough problems. https://t.co/OBCozJsm6Q https://t.co/AZaFpf6147
@jasonfurman Thanks! I'd like to thank my parents, who always believed in me, and inflation, which did the heavy lifting in this model.
Longer take on inc, HI, pov data. Welcome gains, for sure. Tight labor markets help! But context important: Mid/low inc HHs roughly back to 2007 and 2000 levels; GDPs up 40% since 2000; corp profs more than doubled. Reconnection agenda remains essential!	https://t.co/Gb5DCQHyDi
2/2 Why soft? 	--Gains in official poverty and median HH inc notably less than prior 2 years.	--More accurate poverty measure ("SPM") statistically unchanged from 2016.	--Stalled uninsured rate, stuck at same 8.8% as in 2016; first time that's happened since ACA went live.
1/2 Glad to see middle-incomes up, of course, but this headline could have run in 14 previous reports by my rough count (ie, median HH inc was "highest ever!" in ~14 previous years). Actually, this report is kinda soft... https://t.co/lERzh7aEGs
Poverty down (0.4 ppt) and real middle-class income up last year (1.8%), according to new Census data. But progress considerably slower than in previous two years. More to come…
According to new Census data, after years of progress, share without hth coverage was UNCHANGED last year at 8.8%. This surely relates to Trump administration’s efforts to depress enrollment by cancelling most ACA outreach efforts and sowing fear among legal, eligible immigrants.
Wed AM, at 10, the @uscensusbureau will release poverty, income (including medians), and health insurance coverage for 2017. I and @CenterOnBudget peeps will have commentary shortly thereafter.	(FWIW, some forecasts: https://t.co/LSugA10zYd)
@Dan_Carrigg @jeffspross It does! But saying Mcare for Some (eg, eligibility at 60) is different from Mcare for All. Though in either case, those with a stake in the 8% or so of GDP we waste on health care (we spend 18%; others spend ~10%) will aggressively fight to protect the status quo.

3/n As I discuss here, normalizing the wage share of national income is a source of non-inflationary wage growth, even at low productivity growth: https://t.co/Rgu5aZwlAY
2/n ...one assumes no rebalancing of out-of-whack profit and wage shares of income. Wage share 4 ppts below where it was last time unemp was this low, and that's before the big corp tax cut.
1/n One increasingly hears the claim that nominal wage growth maxes out at 3% because that’s the Fed’s inflation target of 2% + 1% productivity growth. But that’s only true if...
@adam_tooze Hey, speaking of wages, I've been solidly engrossed in your "Wages of Destruction" on the economics of Hitler's Germany. Brilliant, deep scholarship! I picked it up to look for any parallels to our current predicament. I don't see much, but I see some. You?

@TimDuy Looks like a turtle. 	What are you getting at here? Since people need gas, food, and housing, this isn't about paycheck buying power. Is it saying tight labor markets are boosting real wage growth?

@arindube That's certainly possible--too early to tell for sure. But see 6-mos mov avg in yr/yr wage figures in my report. And riddle me this, Mr. Econometric big-shot: Now that using HP filters is a crime against nature, what's the best trend extractor??
Hey fellow nerds! Here's my jobs take. Too soon to tell, but there's just maybe a long-awaited upturn in trend wage growth. And I see no signs of overheating (see figure). #Goldilocks! https://t.co/U3dgM47EPt https://t.co/Wz6XLuI6Si
Listen up markets: when you open in an hour, do not--I REPEAT, DO NOT--overreact to the 2.9% pop in wage growth. It's been a long-time coming, inflation's still anchored, and unit labor costs are stable at ~2%. It's a GOOD thing if workers finally catch a break!!!
1/2 Another strong jobs report! Job creation solid and a nice pop on wages--up 2.9%, probably ahead of Aug inflation. Don't love the decline in LFPR and EPOP but they're noisy.

@LarryMishel @brentnyitray @realDonaldTrump Key difference is chaining. IE, differences between chained CPI and PCE are small compared to their differences to non-chained CPI. Our key figures show impact of chained CPI.
2/2 That could change as falling unemp delivers more bargaining power to mid-wage workers and if topline inflation comes down. But for now, once we readjust things we argue CEA got wrong, real compensation was growing through 2016, but not since.
1/2 Trump's CEA claims real wages are growing faster than you thought. In fact, as @LarryMishel and I show, the opposite is the case. Real compensation growth, including benefits, has been flat since 2017. https://t.co/2TcLjs1I1r https://t.co/wen9DyDswQ
@MESandbu @jasonfurman No. With PCE you’d get a more positive result. You’d still get a strong deceleration post-70s.
@jasonfurman @MESandbu Yep--but a) CPI and CPI-RS the same since the early 2000s (or thereabouts; before that, only RS is historically consistent) b) CEA is talking about the past year or two so the issue there is chain-weighting; that's the only thing in their study that makes a (small +) difference.
@jasonfurman You kids with your social media!!
@jasonfurman Well said, Furmanator. I've got something coming soon with many same points, though I conclude that over past year (their main focus), only the deflator change makes a positive difference, and it takes real wg growth from 0 to 0.4%.
@angeloyoung_ Coming later today or tomorrow. They're wrong, even by their own metrics.
I yield to NO ONE when it comes to policies to raise the pay of low-wage workers. But I fear this idea a) vilifies benefit receipt and b) creates an incentive for 'statistical discrimination' (not hiring someone you think might draw benefits).	https://t.co/xcVvMeEDrz

@AndyHarless 2/2 I've heard Powell make that case (2% an avg, not a ceiling); I strongly agree. 	Also, take on Fed 5 paper shouldn't be taken as a critique over current policy. I get the rationale for slow hikes back to neutral as we close in on full capacity.
@AndyHarless 1/2 Good point, Andy. But this implies acceptance of my premise--target inflation--and says: given recent price acceleration, Fed should tighten. That then invokes the question of the symmetry of 2% target--we've been below it for so long; it's OK to be above it for awhile...
There's an influential new Fed paper suggesting the central bank should raise rates when unemployment is below their target, even if their target's too high. To which I say...not so fast!:	https://t.co/UFLnmZDmod https://t.co/HW47wQYUCd
2 things to start your week. First, I somehow missed Aretha and Ray (!) absolutely crushing "Two to Tango" (don't miss a little Count Basie from AF at the end) https://t.co/NurBO7cEZO	Now, eat your spinach! My take on important recent Fed paper: https://t.co/mXELwWgM1v
@GlobeHorowitz @DeanBaker13 @joshbivens_DC n/n ...meaning that going from 4% to 3 % unemployment could generate more price/wage pressure than going from 6% to 5%. There's some evidence for this which I'll write up soon.
@GlobeHorowitz @DeanBaker13 @joshbivens_DC 3/n So, if you're thinking some monetary economists fight very old wars, that's true. However, tighter capacity, even today, can generate faster inflation, and I'm a semi-believer in non-linearities in this space...
@GlobeHorowitz @DeanBaker13 @joshbivens_DC 2/n Re question 2, once the 70s inflation monster was vanquished, the Fed’s favored inflation gauge settled into a 2’ish % groove where it’s been ever since, so the answer to your question is “no." (from about a yr ago: https://t.co/sCoEvcvFkT) https://t.co/mOPEwrvoQX
@GlobeHorowitz @DeanBaker13 @joshbivens_DC 1/n The conventional view is that Fed policy takes some time to work its way through the economy, maybe ~12 mos on avg, though often mortgage, auto, and other consumer rates react more quickly (savings rates are annoyingly sticky...)
@DeanBaker13 and I: The decline of unions has been extremely costly to working Americans, and there's nothing inevitable about it. "It was deliberate policy" that must be reversed. https://t.co/XuQNiZKf8W https://t.co/J8lf7TEM9O
@RussGotAttitude It's an endogenous problem.
I should have added: the paper's important because it challenges the view of many full-employment progressives that the Fed should target the inflation gap rather than the (poorly measured) unemployment gap.	https://t.co/mXELwWgM1v

@kdziczek @ChadBown @petersgoodman I thought that was a scan of my brain.
@petersgoodman @ChadBown @kdziczek That's a question that has surprisingly little to do with any of what's being discussed on this thread. It's much more a function of the relative strength of the dollar, the US trade balance in autos, and global demand. Don't conflate trade deals with trade flows!
@petersgoodman Certainly possible if ROOs are too high, but w/MX autos you've got to consider sunk costs and proximity. Not much empirical evidence for it, so I'd discount hyperbole I've seen.	Ask K. Dziczek (@kdziczek) from CAR who thinks deeply about such things.

@BeatConfusion @JohnPetralia No question, it's too soon to declare much about the chain this time around. But this is far from our first trickle-down rodeo! That sequence has never come to fruition at anything like the claimed magnitudes, if at all!!
@JohnPetralia It's certainly an obvious outcome of the cuts and the first link in the alleged trickle-down chain: corp tax cuts==&gt;profits==&gt;*investment==&gt;productivity==&gt;wage gains. My concern has long been that this is the only link that holds!		*There's a new link here: share buybacks.
n/n As I point out in this post, even at low productivity growth, rebalancing these "factor shares" (more growth going to paychecks v. profits) should, at low unemp, be a source of non-inflationary wage growth.	https://t.co/0CTKNlyzsf
2/n Note the increase in the after-tax profit share this year, as per the big corporate tax cut. https://t.co/GwLdU0nXJl

As promised, why I think the prelim NAFTA renegotiation with Mexico is a real improvement over past agreements, but with many caveats, including enforcement and Trumpian fecklessness that could blow the deal. @Austan_Goolsbee https://t.co/gxVIYhhXp8
That's a good, fair, albeit rhetorical, if not snarky, question (as in you know the answer, which is No). But I had to write a blog post to respond to you, with queries for you along the way: https://t.co/KWp55dhXUq https://t.co/bD64u3YuQI
@Austan_Goolsbee From what I've seen, that's not correct re ISDS (though I've seen it reported that way). Let me write down what I know (not in Twitter!) and show it to you soon. True re autos, but still an advance in what trade agreements should do: raise labor standards in poorer countries!
@rodrikdani You're right--we don't know if enforcement will be ramped up and that's dispositive. Or if this is going anywhere! But the $16 for 40% of Mex auto labor and getting rid of NAFTA Chap 11, section b (ISDS) are big, potential advances that go well beyond anything in TPP.
@Austan_Goolsbee I disagree, though not re tariffs, but re worker protections! US/Mex gets rid of ISDS (this is huge!), much stronger labor standards/rules of origin, has a sunset. I'm writing a piece about this today. Will share later.
@halldjh @cafreeland Agree re @cafreeland, who seems to me a strong, smart negotiator with a sharp eye for the big picture.
@bryant865 Good ?. I'm just talking about his threat to leave Canada out of the process and just go bilateral with MX. I see that negotiation tactic is as separate from the substance of the agreement.

@jasonfurman Try calling it “pitchforking the banksters!!”
@Smartypants60 Good, tough question. One answer is gov't failure/corruption becomes too costly/egregious to ignore (see Watergate). But more so, lack of trust for gov't is not static. It can be, and has been, moved, as the Pew #'s show.
n/n How do we fight such apathy and divisiveness? A bottom-up movement for justice meets top-down leadership who thoroughly and passionately understands everything articulated in Sen. Warren’s speech.
3/n Once lack of trust of a corrupt gov’t becomes the entrenched norm, every new atrocity, from presidential racism/lies to inequality-exacerbating tax cuts elicit a shrug and a “what’d you expect?” That seems a pretty good description of our current political reality.
2/n I have but one thing to add to her powerful case. Disdain for gov’t is a feature, not a bug, of the conservative movement.

@ernietedeschi All reasonable. But:	--on inflation, I'm w/ @LarryMishel/@joshbivens_DC re CPI over PCE, though chained is preferable. FTR, chained CPI up 2.7%, July/July.	--Re composition, you need to unpack that; @hshierholz/@eliselgould disagree with WH on this point: https://t.co/c7BeX8xx07
@RobertFrickNFCU Great question. I'll write something more fulsome about that ASAP but at higher productivity, firms can provide pay hikes and still maintain their profit margins. At low prod, it's a fight between capital/labor, profits/wages which invokes the bargaining power deficit.
@peterbachmd It adjusts for inflation which includes those costs.
n/n Amidst these "mechanical" constraints on wgs, there's an underlying, structural deficit in bargaining power that continues to channel growth away from paychecks. Prices/productivity do not explain 2 yrs of flat wages at 3.9% unemp, solid GDP growth, and strong corp profits.
3/n --Slow productivity growth also in the mix, though that's not the whole story either (in fact, productivity growth was likely stronger last quarter).		I know--that's a lot of one-the-one-hand-on-the-other, so here's my punchline:
2/n: --High energy costs are goosing topline inflation, up 2.9% over past year; core (leaves out energy) up 2.4%;	--But it's not just prices. Nominal wage growth has failed to speed up much, especially given tight labor market.

2/n One thing about the piece, though. It made the critical point that it’s not that we consume that much more health care than other countries as much as we spend a lot more doing so. But it argues the key reason for this is price non-transparency...

I should have added: that's topline consumer price growth, driven in part by rising energy costs. The Fed's preferred measure--core PCE price growth--is also out this AM: up 1.9% yr/yr, just below their target rate. IE: no signs of overheating on prices or wages.
2/2 How the Trump admin gets from flat real wage growth (and this is the average--median is worse) to their latest idea--cut capital gains taxes for the wealthiest--is merely the latest example of who they're really working for.

Q&amp;A on today's GDP report. What's hot/sustainable, what's not. Also, I try to put GDP in context: it's important, of course, but it leaves a lot out:  https://t.co/E3N7Nf4Y41 https://t.co/6DdTweVdPg
Any administration would tout a strong GDP report like today's, but if it's not reaching workers' paychecks, which it isn't, then cease the applause and get to work on policy to reconnect growth to much more broadly-share prosperity.
@Bjornapoor Not in this report, but it's been bupkes...
But is 4% sustainable? Nope. Future growth rates will come down back down to trend of around 2.5%, but I don't see anything in the report to suggest expansion can't roll on.
Pretty Goldilocks GDP report: up 4.1%, juiced by strong cons spending, net exports (exporters getting ahead of tariffs, ie, one-time). More reliable yr/yr real growth up 2.8%, still above trend. Core prices up ~2%, so Fed should stay chill. 	More to come...

6/6 ...even if it’s just an opportunistic act, as long as it's convincing, they will stick with him no matter what he does to them.
5/6 The punchline: if your model is “politicians who hurt you will lose your support,” you may well be wrong. If people feel like a politician gets them, gets their struggles, shares their concerns, confirms their prejudices, stands up to their enemies…
4/6 Meanwhile, Trump was roundly supported by the Congressional R’s and the R’s witnesses. The former were afraid of him; the latter, as in that headline, seemed to believe he ultimately had their best interests at heart.
3/6 In fact, the Constitution places the responsibility with Congress to regulate trade/tariffs. That’s been ceded to the president over the decades, but they could take it back. But the House R’s explicitly said “no” to that idea.
2/6 The farmers all plainly told the committee that the tariffs (ie, retaliatory tariffs) were seriously hurting their businesses. The R’s had absolutely nothing to say to them beyond “we feel your pain” and “we must stick with Trump.”

@hamiltonproj Wow--you can adjust for regional price differences. That's some really sharp work, @hamiltonproj peeps!
@NeumarkDN Sure--4.1 unemp in 99q4 meant tighter labor market compared to 4.1 now (that's surely a factor in this outcome). But key point here is to rebut notion of wage growth squeezing profits. Not in the aggregate data.
@JEG_Booth96 The labor share measure includes non-wage benefits (which should make you happy!).
4/4 Final point for Fed heads: this channel of wage growth—redistribution within national income juiced by tight labor markets—is non-inflationary; Fed doesn’t need to speed up rate hikes to offset it!
3/4 So, a) we should see some shift from profits to paychecks right now, and b) but, at least in the national data (vs. some individual firms), it’s not there, at great cost to workers.
2/4 Check out the table below. Unemployment was the same in 1999Q1 as it was in most recent quarter for which we have these data (2018Q1). But labor’s share of income was 3 percentage points higher. That's $530bn or $3,400 PER WORKER! https://t.co/aQCzWKzxtb
1/4 According to WSJ, labor costs are squeezing profits. In fact, I’d say there’s a lot less of that than I’d expect at such low unemployment. You’ve got to go back to the 1960s to see the same split as we have now at low unemp. (see figure). https://t.co/xVqPdk7k5z https://t.co/YscCGt3IW5

@GoldyHA 2/2 And yeah, as @Econ_Marshall will tell you all day, neoclassical models don't explain much re labor market dynamics, precisely because they leave out the relative power dynamics I just noted.
@GoldyHA 1/2 It's a combination of too much employer power relative to worker power--monopsony up, unions down--and slow productivity growth. Together, these factors make it possible for firms to protect their profit share against higher labor costs.

@rooseveltinst A8 2/3 …prevent a workers’ party from forming by a) convincing working-class people that their differences outweigh their commonalities &amp; generating infighting among those whose econ interests should otherwise draw them together, &amp; b) buy up politicians in both major parties.
@rooseveltinst A8 1/3 We really need some sort of workers’ party that unites people who depend on their paychecks as opposed to their stock portfolios. Conservative elites may be horrible at governing, but they’ve perfected a heretofore effective electoral scheme, which is:
@rooseveltinst A7 2/2 Also, upward redistribution through government policies (trickle-down tax cuts, patents, occupational protections) and macro policies—fiscal and monetary—that have led to too much slack in labor markets.
@rooseveltinst A7 1/2 This is really asking: what are the factors behind the growth of wage inequality? The decline of unions, erosion of labor standards (min wg, workers protections), rise of finance, employer concentration, absence of full emp, persistent trade deficits in manufactured goods.

@rooseveltinst A4 3/3 I recognize that I’m dealing with an old problem—how to raise workers’ bargaining clout—one for which there’s no sexy new app. But it’s real and pressing nevertheless.
@rooseveltinst A4 2/3 Once you accept that context, it leads you to issues of job quality, wage policies (min wg, OT), classification (making sure workers are covered by labor laws), collective bargaining, macro policies to keep us at full employment, and more.
@rooseveltinst A4 1/3 Not sure I'd put it this way. It’s a bit like asking “how can this desk, or this new drill press, be used to improve the future of work.” That is, the key here is to focus not just on the tech but on the context in which it is implemented.
@rooseveltinst A3 2/2: Today's SCOTUS decision on the Janus case, which strikes a potentially severe blow to public sector unions, pushes in exactly the wrong direction: https://t.co/WEDtaw8F0k
@rooseveltinst A3 1/2: The list is long, but it largely reduces to employers’ bargaining clout has long surpassed that of workers. Relative to other economies, workers in the US are highly exposed to this fight between labor and capital. This problem is exacerbated by our pay-to-play politics.
@rooseveltinst A2: I view tech change as a pretty constant force, so not sure I see much “rise” against the baseline (ie, I don’t see acceleration). In this piece, I conclude that the future of work will be what we, not technology, make of it.	https://t.co/dQ0tUN2tVo
@rooseveltinst A1 4/4: Thus, we should spend less time arguing about the unknowable, and implement policies to deal with the job market problems we clearly have: wage stagnation, discrimination, distribution of opportunity (people/places left behind even at full emp).
@rooseveltinst A1: 3/4 After all, thanks to tech advances, the American job market went from 90% agriculture to under 5% agriculture. There was, of course, much displacement and pain involved for many in this shift, but tech has always destroyed old opportunities and created new ones.
@rooseveltinst 2/4: Right now, we have more of a job quality problem than a job quantity problem. Of course, many of the tech arguments are about the future, but I think we must be very humble about our ability to see around such corners.
@rooseveltinst A1 (1/4) As we’re closing in on full employment, it’s hard to the make the case that the pace at which technology in the workplace is replacing workers is accelerating. That would imply slower job creation and faster productivity, neither of which we see.

It is increasingly clear that "family values, fiscal rectitude, and free trade" have served as a highly effective Republican front for upward redistribution.
I don't believe the "natural" rate of unemployment can be reliably pinned down at 4.5%. But so what? The fact that the Fed, or at least Chair Powell, doesn't believe it--now, that's important: https://t.co/LXf8WuuMAw
@BenRossTransit Stronger dollar and big fiscal stimulus at low unemployment very likely to raise trade deficit. Tariffs, including retaliation, unlikely to change net trade balance.
2) What would help? As per @DeanBaker13 and I: Use benefits of trade to directly help those hurt by it; stop protecting professionals/patents; pushback on currency managers:  https://t.co/QQh8hqcv3k
1) Context important when throwing around billions in trade talk. Trump's $50 billion tariffs on China &lt;2% of imports ($3.1 trillion). Big picture, I still don't see how any of this helps working-class Americans. https://t.co/XG7FSOcCHC
Fellow Fed watchers: Since the FOMC prefers to alter rates in meetings followed by news conferences, there's a view that the new policy of news conferences after each meeting raises the potential for more rate changes.
@mattyglesias Fiscal stimulus fades, rate hikes, and supply constraints. 		But IMHO, a better question is: unless 3.5% is obviously problematic, why go up to 4.5%?
@LukeGromen Nice reference! More recent version: https://t.co/LY7MEWIBfG
6/6) What’s the solution? More collective bargaining, for sure; better labor standards, strongly enforced; pushback on firm concentration; the maintenance of chock-full employment for sustained periods. 	(More to come on this next week...)
5) One bit of evidence for this hypothesis (and I’ve got more, forthcoming) is the flat trend in unit labor costs in recent recoveries, meaning that as unemployment fell, even in the wage-rich 1990s, labor’s share of income didn’t go up that much. https://t.co/zm9sO9Xt0F
4) But how can they win that fight at such low unemployment? First, wages are picking up a bit, so it’s not a total wipeout. But the answer points to the fundamental fault line in the US economy: even at low unemp worker bargaining clout is much too low.
3) But at lower productivity, firms—increasingly empowered by concentration/monopsony (employer power), diminished unions, etc.—will fight especially hard to maintain their profit margins by restraining labor costs.
2) With higher productivity growth, firms facing tight labor markets are more willing to raise pay because they can do so and still maintain profit margins.
1) I think the slow-wage-growth puzzle (to use Chair Powell's framing) is a function of weak worker bargaining power at low productivity growth. Here’s the story.
@maxbsawicky @jimtankersley Now ya see that just makes me want to fly off the handle!
5) In other words, the Fed believes, and I think they're right, that the tax cuts will have temporary Keynes effects, not long-term Laffer effects. I'd urge Chair Powell to underscore this difference in future discussions of the macro impacts of the cuts.
4) Reflecting all of these empirical and theoretical caveats, the Fed Committee itself appears to wholly discount the supply-side story: their trend growth rate for real GDP is 1.8%, the current underlying trend.
3) Much more important, the evidence shows no historical correlations between tax cuts and productivity growth. Many, many moving parts get in the way of the simple story.
2b) Theory also suggests deficit-financed tax cuts are much less likely to generate supply-side impacts, and this tax cut was financed by $2 trillion over 10 years.
2) On theory, he cited only substitution effects (lower tax cuts, more labor supply, capex). Income effects push the other way (though may be smaller).
1) When @jimtankersley asked Fed Chair Powell about the impact of the tax cut on growth, I thought Powell leaned further into tax-cut productivity effects than is warranted by theory, evidence, and the Fed's own projections.
@_N0TCH_ Also, rates that are very low for very long hurt those who depend on fixed incomes.
@_N0TCH_ Great question. See my paragraph re the Fed's rationales: worries about overheating and "normalization." Granted, these are abstractions relative to costs of higher rates, and many econo-doves, like myself, often argue for caution in raising for the reasons you raise.
2) Here's an interesting factoid from my Fed piece: Historically, when the unemp rate has been between 3.5-4%, the Fed funds rate has averaged 5%, 3 points higher than the top end of the new 2% target they’re expected to set today. See below for why that makes sense. https://t.co/FFmExVHl0V
1) The Fed is highly likely to raise its benchmark interest rate this afternoon. But should they? I explain their rationale, emphasizing the key goal of not disrupting the unemp rate's downward momentum: https://t.co/JKfh61ywZ9 https://t.co/iRBfSCVZE4

Trump’s rhetoric on trade has been bloviation without action. Given my well-honed skepticism about his willingness to help those workers hurt by trade, this shift from bloviation to actionable policy is more troubling than reassuring. https://t.co/t6wpXulWph
2) Barring price shock (unlikely), I don't foresee a Fed mistake. Given relatively low US exposure (imports 15% of GDP), I doubt trade war kills the trend. That leaves supply constraints, which I think is a risk, though there's still room-to-run. https://t.co/qPnWlAI8qZ

Another strong jobs report! Unemp down to 3.8% (and, at 3.75, just missed 3.7); black unemp to all time low of 5.9% (full emp helps minorities!). Upside surprise on jobs. Even a small wage pop for non-supervisory workers, but that's still a weak point.

Here's why I think that Seattle "head tax" is a) reasonable, and b) a microcosm of bigger stuff going on in this space: https://t.co/SekGKLfkm7
Strongly agree w @JimPethokoukis re zoning reform for Seattle. But that’s a very long term solution to current homelessness crisis and therefore not a workable alternative to business tax. (As per our @cnbc debate just now.)
@ATobert I did not but I will now correct that oversight!
7) In conclusion: Work requirements (really, paper-work requirements) should thus be seen for what they are: an attempt to offset the costs of tax cuts for the rich with benefit cuts for the poor.
6) Then there’s this inherent contradiction: low-wage minorities, immigrants, the working poor depend on a persistently VERY tight labor market. But as we speak, the Federal Reserve is pushing the other way, raising rates to slow growth and reduce perceived price pressures.
5) Also, even at low national unemployment, there are places in America with too few employment opportunities, and I’m not just talking about rural areas. Urban job deserts persist as well. In other words, barriers to work exist on both supply and demand sides.
4) Next, the working poor face a spate of labor-market barriers: criminal records, health/skill deficits, discrimination, inadequate work supports (child care), and the instability of jobs in the low-wage sector relative to higher paying jobs.
3) You can see this latter point in the figure below from important new paper by Hoynes and Schanzenbach:  in 1990, 60% of spending on low-inc kids went to kids whose parents had no earnings;  now, it’s 20%. https://t.co/LwAa3O906Y https://t.co/U9ZPZs6mpc
2) First, the poor who are able to do so already work. They must, because a) you can’t get buy on health coverage and $1.40 per meal, and b) US anti-poverty policy in increasingly conditional on work, and low-income families have responded to these incentives.
1) How wrong is the Trump/Ryan/Congressional R’s push for work requirements in anti-poverty programs? Let me count the ways.
@tamcfall A) I don't understand this. 	B) given A, I still think this may be a timely eg of confirmation bias.

@jasonfurman @ernietedeschi @ModeledBehavior @nick_bunker @marthagimbel @Noahpinion @greg_ip @JayCShambaugh 4) This theory implies a sharp (maybe implausibly so) non-linearity. Here's the test. Unemp may well fall to 3.5%. Around that point, workers' bargaining clout is strong enough to wrestle back factor share and AHE growth notably accelerates.
@jasonfurman @ernietedeschi @ModeledBehavior @nick_bunker @marthagimbel @Noahpinion @greg_ip @JayCShambaugh 3) My theory of wages right now is more Marx than Marshall. Rather than marginal movements along a PC, it's a wrestling match over factor shares. Labor's losing due to combination of weak bargaining clout and low productivity. https://t.co/nX3v2cIkOl
@jasonfurman @ernietedeschi @ModeledBehavior @nick_bunker @marthagimbel @Noahpinion @greg_ip @JayCShambaugh 2) What's so important about PA EPOP right now is a) shows we may not be at full emp, and b) it's strong cyclical component suggests 'reverse hysteresis' as per famous Yagan paper. We shouldn't write these folks off, though many may need help overcoming labor market barriers.
@jasonfurman @ernietedeschi @ModeledBehavior @nick_bunker @marthagimbel @Noahpinion @greg_ip @JayCShambaugh 1) So, summarizing, you're saying: PA EPOP doesn't solve the mystery of slow wg growth at/near full emp. It's non-stationary and its delta doesn't correlate with AHE wg growth. Right? I agree.

Which part of that do you disagree with?
@CliffordAsness 2nd, there’s no empirical correlation between share buybacks and investment (the topic of the segment). Again, what’s the mystery?
@CliffordAsness First, share buybacks increase the value of outstanding shares. 80% of the value of the stock market is held by the top 10%. 40% by top 1%. Zero by bottom 50%. What’s the mystery?

Left out the link! D'oh!!	https://t.co/5yB6CDAQ2e https://t.co/3FzE1TXB50
My extended take on the jobs report. Job market remains strong, of course, but lack of wage acceleration important sign that some slack still exists (wage growth just barely beating inflation) as is potential slack in 25-54 employment rate. https://t.co/5yB6CDAQ2e https://t.co/roftXOkrck
Jobs report looks more moderate than strong. Unemp rate at 3.9% but this mostly due to tick down in labor force. Emp gains, at 164,000, slightly below expectations; Wg growth grew 2.6% for 3rd month in row; lack of acceleration one indicator that some labor market slack remains.
@eliselgould That's the question! To your battle stations!

@GagnonMacro Yep. But I'm increasingly wondering what bang-for-buck will be from tax cut. For various reasons--Fed, other higher rates, underwhelming real wage gains, tax cuts skewed to the top where peeps have low MPC--sign will be + for sure, but magnitude could surprise to the downside.

First impression on jobs: huge pop in payrolls supported by bump in labor force participation; wage growth moderates. Preliminary take: there's still room to run in this job market!
@Calloy811 The counter-argument is that traders are not reacting the (weak) signal in the jobs data. They're reacting to how they think other traders will react to the jobs data.
@Calloy811 My bad. On jobs day, markets often react to changes in labor market data that are statistically indistinguishable from no change at all, thereby over-reacting to noisy data.
Jobs day tomorrow! Last month, I thought markets overreacted to wage pop. But given conf int around these high freq data, almost any reaction is an overreaction.

@dianabhenriques That is THE question, in a very efficient nutshell. One, among many, answers: the D's have yet to offer a policy agenda that seriously and convincingly challenges this model.
For years, the dominant biz model has been to boost profit margins by suppressing labor costs. As the figs below show (labor share; profit margins), it's been working. More in tomorrow's WaPo, but point is we're due for some wage growth. https://t.co/NygPubpK45
@LoganMohtashami @IanShepherdson I attached the wrong graph earlier--sorry. Here's the right one. As I said, no correlation--slightly negative--between wg/price growth, but it's just the last five years (earlier tweet mis-stated time frame). Longer term correlation positive, of course. Unusual times! https://t.co/A61fhARKre
Hey Trump and Manooch! Like I told you, stocks go up; stocks go down. If they're your report card, as you've suggested, you just failed a midterm. https://t.co/OThD6TFWqM https://t.co/sepw8DvrDw
@DeanBaker13 Yep. From my WaPo piece: "Today’s report also includes wage data for the lower-paid 80 percent of the workforce who have blue-collar or nonmanagerial jobs. It was up only 2.4 percent, implying that faster wage growth mostly benefited higher-paid workers." https://t.co/aFlBderdMX
More on why we must love and embrace wage growth...welcome it into your home...offer it a beer. Do not fear it! https://t.co/dfzyXXewpV https://t.co/IJxB2Vc779
@IanShepherdson @LoganMohtashami Important point--I agree. That said, I think ULCs look pretty tame in your figure--not at all inflationary (I get you're looking forward). BUT: we need faster ULC's for a while to re-balance factor shares toward paychecks, not profits! Which is NON-inflationary.
My take on jobs report. Faster wage is to be welcomed, not feared! Here's why: 	https://t.co/CFyTHlRLPt https://t.co/zPikwkCFC7
Many reasons to embrace--not fear--that nice, long-awaited 2.9% yr/yr pop in wage growth:	--It's non-inflationary, given inflation+productivity	--It's been disappointing on the low side	--One month does not a new trend make	--Labor share in national inc needs to re-balance

@mckonomy I hear you and agree. But my point is that they DO talk about the $, and when they do, they say it should be strong, which they do not mean* or believe.	*Do we think UST sec'y's, e.g., oppose falling $ in downturn as a corrective? Of course not.

As @hannahkatch and I show, Medicaid is an efficient, effective, highly-valued program. Which is why R's attempts to cut it have moved from highly visible legislation to behind-the-scenes waivers.	   https://t.co/TjjAarzHFh https://t.co/u8GIkjqLly

@MikeFellman @LarryMishel @AdyBarkan @DeanBaker13 @WSpriggs @StephanieKelton @SandyDarity @AFLCIO @SEIU You make an important point @MikeFellman.

(BTW, fisc policy now shifting into higher gear: https://t.co/httquW2Ljk)

My take on Dec and 2017 jobs market. Solid gains continue on pace, but more room-to-run on wages and jobs. Positive, important, macro elasticities are in play (see blk-wht unemp gap) which must be nurtured! https://t.co/nNjF3PLpa4
@AlexBrill_DC @SquawkCNBC @BeckQuick @JoeSquawk @andrewrsorkin I was least wrong. Here's my expanded take: https://t.co/nNjF3PLpa4
You know how I say the tight labor market disproportionately helps minorities? Blk unemp rate in Dec fell to lowest on record, 6.8%. Blk minus wht rate, 3.1 ppts, also lowest on record. Punch bowl to Fed: leave me be!!
Just listening to Barney Frank on @cnbc who made tons of sense. Great point re strong equity markets amidst Dodd/Frank. I'll be talking jobs when the report comes out at 8:30 with @AlexBrill_DC.
@LorenAdler Certainly hope so, but note post-90s reversion to prior gap in 2000s. Do you think the reasons for smaller gap now are more structural vs. 90s one time shift to PPOs, etc.?
@markknoller Nope. But debt held by the public (net of what gov't owes to itself)--which reflects gov't demand on credit markets-- is more relevant variable for the things I talking about in the piece. https://t.co/en1TipGqPH
@markknoller Again, situational. However, though this is substantively wrong, I fear lawmakers feel we have too little fiscal space and would be more reluctant to offset the next downturn (it's out there somewhere!) w/ debt/gdp at 75% vs. say, 40%.
The debate over the budget deficit is invariably confusing, misleading, and frustrating. That's because the answer to the question 'are deficits good or bad' is...it depends.  https://t.co/YbiCJNe5pV https://t.co/JN2CtC24Gl

@ErikTheSimpson True. JCT analysis leaves out the estate tax--final bill doubles the already high exemption so that less than 0.1% will face this tax (ie, &gt;99.9% of estate wealth will be passed on to heirs tax free).

@LarryGlickman @JStein_Wonkblog @damianpaletta @ericawerner @mikedebonis No kidding. What on earth were they thinking?

@karlbykarlsmith Love you back, @karlbykarlsmith but you're making my case! "We can't afford it" has always and everywhere been a political, not an economic argument, one R's obviously used strategically and too many D's caved under. No more!
This is important:		Media and everyone else: From here on in, the GOP can NEVER credibly say "we can't afford X because it will raise the deficit!"		Their support for their deficit-financed tax plan once-and-for-all, permanently takes that (always BS) argument off the table.
If you're wondering why it makes sense to whack the middle-class to pay for corporate tax cuts while adding $1 trillion to the debt, you're a) not alone b) not a DC Republican. I get the donor angle but how does this make political sense for them?   https://t.co/udoCySTggH https://t.co/IAtJFDv7QY

OK, Sens. Corker and Flake. The JCT dynamic score is out and it shows revenue losses of $1 trillion over 10 years. You've said you can't support that (and no conceivable trigger will offset it). So, let's see what you're made of. https://t.co/enXjbnFIb5 https://t.co/44FYEAlHr9
@RichardRubinDC Actually, tax policy involves figuring out the most efficient and equitable way to raise the necessary revenues to pay for the public goods that the public wants/needs. 		So, no--not "like making a cocktail." Though given their process, I can see why he'd think that.
From this AMs GDP report: Corp profits near historic high; corp tax share historically low. I challenge anyone to explain why this sector needs a debt-busting $2 trillion in tax cuts at the expense of mid-class (w/out invoking "our donors insist"). https://t.co/29iz8gxNyu
Of the many ways the GOPs tax plan screws workers, this one--its incentive to move jobs and investment overseas--has been least elevated. It is, of course, yet another eg of Trump's phony populism and GOPs allegiance to multinationals over US workers:	https://t.co/8BxUaJJbm5 https://t.co/k5tJMoYuJa

It's a 3-fer, not a 2-fer: The R tax plan doesn't just exacerbate after-tax inequality and add trillions to the debt. It poses a serious threat to health care. I'm writing on this for Monday, but 'til then, chk out this NYT editorial: https://t.co/DMlJ2sFIkA
@davidckamin So, there's a trigger (for the rich) if the deficit is less negative, but as per WaPo, there's: "no trigger in the bill to raise additional revenue if [I'd say 'when'] government tax receipts fall substantially short of JCT projections." #WorseTaxPlanEver https://t.co/XjEJKilPz6

See the bold line below from @RichardRubinDC . Sorry to yell, but THAT FACT ALONE SHOULD STOP THIS PLAN IN ITS TRACKS. You want to do tax reform, fine, but this ain’t even close. Let’s all take a breath and start again. https://t.co/8jGB5AX8Vr https://t.co/ca32fICjZI
@DustinGiebel "Oh, honey, look at all those adorable one-dollar bills! The peasants must love them!"
Back from Asia, Trump says he wants to a) lower the trade deficit, and b) pass the "GREAT Tax Bill." Here's why those two goals are incompatible: https://t.co/N8XTDFFNBv
As @SenSherrodBrown shows here and I underscored on NPR this AM, the tax plan a) incentivizes the offshoring of more US jobs, and b) will lead to higher trade deficits. https://t.co/ZGDcYvN8OC 		See also @paulkrugman on the latter point: https://t.co/ikZj7P0q8n
Min wage hikes, pro-enviro regs, health coverage, safety nets; job killers, right? Wrong! https://t.co/KVOEZD6epO
@Neil_Irwin Yeah, but Hayek probably unfollowed you.
The R's tax plan won't do squat for growth or workers' wages. Here's why and what you'd do if you actually gave a damn about those left behind: https://t.co/8fxDWPpMzx
@MarcGoldwein That wasn't his claim. It was (as per CQ this AM) "a revenue surge that could both pay for the tax cuts and help reduce future deficits by $1 trillion over a decade." Surely you agree that's not anywhere close to plausible.
@rhondabannard @SRuhle @MSNBC Good point. Like this, right? https://t.co/DU4awsnWzr https://t.co/CfOH0qSl9q
Econ lit says a well-designed, debt-free tax cut could pay for 15-30% of itself. FTR, that's way too optimistic. But Treas Sec Mnuchin: "In our models, we believe it will be $2.5 trillion of growth." That's 166% or more plainly, total BS.
@MichaelSLinden It's pure politics. The R's learned from health care that the more the public learns what they're up to--transferring wealth to their donors at the expense of everyone else--the tougher for them to legislate. Time is their enemy and thus, our friend.
More to come on this on Mon, but if you really wanted faster, more equitable wage or GDP growth, this tax cut is so not how you'd go about it. See quote below from tax prof @vicfleischer https://t.co/VK9DdPaRhN https://t.co/jJoo7Ar3HQ
@BruceBartlett I've long and publicly fretted that this is the play here. First, channel revenues from Treas to top 1%; Second, insist that higher deficit requires spending cuts.	https://t.co/ruqyYa7v94 https://t.co/ztl5OWr5ZT

6) Biggest losers: mod/low inc fams w/kids in states with st/loc taxes. see @lilybatch + deficit financing==&gt;future cuts to low inc programs
5) Biggest winners: heirs to the richest estates (hmm...); phase out est tax; keep "step up basis" (heirs pay no tax on inherited K gains).
4) R's tax priorities: $300 dollar family credit phases out as estate tax elimination phases in!
3) Proposed inc tax thresholds look more regressive than what TPC scored; cuts may be even more skewed to top:	https://t.co/rRLsctkVFQ
2) Adds tremendous complexity re 25% pass-through rate. Complexity + favored rate = tax avoidance.
Initial impressions of House tax cut plan:	1) It's what we thought: big breaks at top, corps, offshorers, highend businesses, rich estates.
@THAToneil Miniscule to none, due to deficit financing. See https://t.co/cdZTv1RoLA. CBO-like model 2nd decade, dyn score loses more revs than static!

@morningmoneyben @SpeakerRyan Also, can't say CBO's wrong on coverage #'s but spot on re deficit reduction #'s. Well, you can, but...
CBO: Compared to ACA, 24 million would lose coverage under R's hth plan by 2026. Meanwhile, (mostly) high end taxes cut $883bn. Shameful. https://t.co/mEGymAXsbm
CBO score of R's hth plan shows net premium paid by 64 yr old w/ inc of $26,500 would go up by $12,900. https://t.co/pGdhllqdiI
The R's health care plan solves 2 problems:	1) the rich don't have enough after-tax income;	2) poor/middle class have too much hth coverage.
Trump officials and Rep. Ryan are in super-hyped spin mode re their regressive, coverage-whacking hth care plan:	https://t.co/M89BcluuTu https://t.co/c04r41UzkR
Tax changes in R's hth care plan:	Mid class, avg inc $77K; Tax cut: $300	Top 0.1%, avg inc $12mil; Tax cut: $207,000	https://t.co/5SvPXutlP1 https://t.co/NxDocwNGGb

6/6 All points I plan to highlight as I comment on his hearing tomorrow, 10-11am on MSNBC.
5/6 BUT: GOP House/Trump tax plans, and ACA repeal ALL FAIL Mnuchin Test!
4/6 So, Mnuchin Test: any new tax cut for high-inc HHs must be met with an offsetting cut in their tax benefits somewhere else in the code.
3/6 Mnuchin: “There will be a big tax cut for mid class, but any tax cuts we have for the upper class will be offset by less deductions...”
2/6 Mnuchin: “Any reductions...in upper-inc taxes will be offset by less deductions, so there will be no absolute tax cut for upper class."

@RichardRubinDC Good point--I mean in the forthcoming reform round, which is surely this year.
OK, #DBCFT fans and opponents. Pony up your prediction: 		What's the likelihood that the Border Adj Cash Flow tax becomes law?:
6/6 So, you either recreate ACA under another name, or u shift costs onto people who can’t afford them. Result: millions more w/out coverage
5/6 Boom! That’s it.
4/6 If you have a mandate, you must have subsidies, so lower income people can meet the mandate.
3/6 If you have a risk pool, you must have a mandate. Otherwise, healthy people will avoid pool &amp; costs will spiral due to adverse selection
2/6 If u want to cover everyone (as R's have said they do), u need a risk pool, so healthy can subsidize others. That’s how insurance works.
1/6 The fundamentals of health care reform explain why it’s easy to repeal, hard to replace. But what are those fundamentals?
Listening to @POTUS talk as thoughtfully as ever about the policy agenda we need going forward. Struck by how that is so not what's coming.

4/4 …While raising taxes on mid/low inc families, as they lose their hth ins coverage. To state obvious, opposite of what Trump ran on. https://t.co/LMfCDObExn
3/4 But “R plans to repeal the ACA would provide large...tax cuts to households with annual incomes over $1 million” https://t.co/mnluAx10Og https://t.co/t7HRGLM0kK
2/4 Mnuchin on CNBC: “Any reductions we have in upper-inc taxes will be offset by less deductions..no absolute tax cut for the upper class.”

@nathansnewman @sbattjer In fact, ~ 2.5 mil paying full price for off-exch individ coverage are likely eligible for tax credits #savings
3) Thus, precluding the "death spiral" that ACA opponents prattle on about. Yes, recalibration in indiv market needed #growing_pains
2) Must look at price changes net of premium subsidies. Most (85%!) in exchanges get the credits which adjust to changes in premium costs...

The unemployment rate says "raise!" The payroll number says "hold!" What's a central bank to do?! (A: hold.)
