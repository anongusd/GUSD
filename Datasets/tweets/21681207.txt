@UrbanFoodLink @DWTLaw Glad you could make it. We had a great time!
RT @foodiefankate: @ForterraNW Thanks for great 'food for thought' at #GGRegion tonight!
RT @DWTLaw: What interesting tidbits did you glean from tonight's discussion on making density palatable? #GGRegion
Panelists are now breaking out into small groups with audience to discuss these issues. Thanks all for following along! #GGRegion
Matt: But I feel better when I think about what these panelists are saying. When we educate people about food, it gives me hope. #GGRegion
Matt: Having a farm and supporting farms and supporting the restaurant, there are days when I think we're doomed. #GGRegion
Scott: We should try to the extent possible to focus on quality over quantity. #GGRegion
Scott: Agree that education is key, for both next generation and current generation. Need to teach interconnectedness of system. #GGRegion
Branden: have an opportunity to help young people understand food system &amp; shift notion of price to value as most important factor #GGRegion
Branden: It's going to take these small, important changes to slowly make the positive impacts we need. #GGregion
Branden: Our opportunity lies in education. It takes education to help change 50 years of problematic food system and inequity.
Linda: Look at where your food comes from. that's how you save farmland. #GGRegion
Linda: Everytime you buy local, you strengthen farm to table system. Ask where your food came from. Make sure it's local. #GGRegion
Scott: We need food to live, of course. for nutrition &amp; our soul. Must ensure that every1 can  access that within their community. #GGRegion
Linda: each part needs each other to succeed. #GGRegion
Linda: Food system is critical interconnected. As people we're connected from farm to restaurant to dinner plate. #GGRegion
Gene: 2nd, what opportunities do we have as a region to capitalize on farm to table movement to create a more sustainable region? #GGRegion
Gene: Asks panelists to answer 2 qs: How do you see social equity, community building, &amp; agg intersecting around food?  #GGRegion
Gene: A great chef is deeply involved in the food from seed to plate to social experience of food. #GGRegion
Matt: Excited to participate in that community in Pioneer Sq. Hopefully make a difference in the neighborhood. #GGRegion
Matt: Opening in Pioneer Sq. was scary. Somedays noone there. Somedays, tons. Excited to be part of redeveloping neighborhood. #GGRegion
Matt: Melrose Market was great move for us. Really fit who we were. Able to expand. Hire more ppl. #GGRegion
Matt: other part of this is location. Orig. Sitka &amp; Spruce was in a strip mall. But we ended up doing fine dining. #GGRegion
Matt: had to adjust our financial model a little to find balance btwn buying best product and not alienating customers w/ price. #GGRegion
Matt: Important to buy from farmers producing food in thoughtful, responsible way. Ppl thinking about their positive legacy. #GGRegion
Matt: I realized early on, my best way to influence outside of food I make, is the way I vote with my dollars. #GGRegion
Matt "For me, sharing food is one of the most human experiences." #GGRegion
Matt: "It's a funny position. My food goes to basically one demographic. relatively expensive &amp; a certain (fair) price bracket." #GGRegion
Matt: not only own restaurants, also own 20 acre farm on Vashon. Grow food for his restaurants &amp; his family. #GGRegion
Finally, Matt Dillion, Chef &amp; Restauranteur speaking about his participation in food systems. #GGRegion
Gene: We're lucky to have developers like Scott enhancing our communities helping us make our cities sustainable. #GGRegion
Gene: Number of years ago, Forterra realized it's not just what happens outside of city, sustainability comes w/in city too. #GGRegion
Scott: not just what we want, customers want sustainable, local food. More we can support these places, more we support system. #GGRegion
Scott: When I do projects, like Melrose Market, look at how to support local business owners who support local systems w/ biz. #GGRegion
Scott: People are choosing to live in urban areas more and more. Part of my role is to create small spaces where people connect. #GGRegion
Scott: for many of us, that community building takes place over meals still. #GGRegion
Scott: We have social, online communities, but people still want and need a physical space to create community. #GGRegion
Next is Scott Shapiro talking about the way physical space plays a role in community building. #GGRegion
Gene: equity is a fundamental part of sustainability and people are starting to recognize that. #GGRegion
Branden: cities have a tremendous capacity for assisting agg. regions around them. TDR one way. Need to keep farmers farming. #GGRegion
Branden: eating seasonally can actually be cheaper. Studies found in-season produce at farmers markets often cheaper than grocery. #GGRegion
Branden: For access, need to change what corner stores sell, in part. Get bodega to sell produce, increase access. #GGRegion
Branden: issue is being addressed across the system. Starting to see young, immigrant farm training programs on production side. #GGRegion
Branden: But food equity is getting elevated now as an issue. Notion of equity and systemic exclusion are shaping our communities. #GGRegion
Branden: Took planners a long time to understand that food access was even a problem at all. #GGregion
Branden: "We sometimes use term food justice. It's about giving people the ability to make decisions about their food." #GGRegion
Branden: "When we talk about equity in food systems, we're usually talking access to grocery stores and affordability." #GGRegion
Branden: "System is less a chain and more of a web." #GGRegion
Branden: Food system is production, processing, marketing, storage, access, consumption, reclaimation, disposal. #GGRegion
Brandon Born is up next to talk food systems. #GGRegion
Gene: On the production end it's back to the future. fewer petrochemicals, old sustainable techniques = better final product. #GGRegion
Linda: local food keeps local farms in production. buying local is the #1 thing you can do as individual to save farms. #GGRegion
Linda: consumer end is very important piece. "Know your farmer, know your food." #GGRegion
Linda: Raise 2,000 sheep per year. Go to some of the best restaurants in the area. #GGRegion
Linda: being sustainable is considerably less dollar per dollar than using external fertilizers, etc. #GGRegion
Linda: to achieve this we compost EVERYTHING, save winter roof water, don't use any outside inputs = low carbon footprint. #GGRegion
Linda: Our #1 crop is grass. Need good grass, to have good grass-fed meat. #GGRegion
Linda, owner of Ninety Farms, raises grass-fed, all natural hair sheep. "We work sustainably, it's the right way to do things." #GGRegion
@foodiefankate Glad to have you here, Kate! Tag your tweets w/ #GGRegion if you're tweeting throughout!
Gene: Food is at the center of social equity, community building, and farmland conservation. #GGRegion
Gene: WA has a special culture. We come together to get unprecedented projects done. 50,272 acre Teanaway conservation is example. #GGRegion
Forterra President Gene Duvernoy is moderating tonight's panel. #GGRegion
Jim is discussing how land conservation affects our food systems. References recent LCLIP work from Forterra, King Co, Seattle #GGRegion
Jim: "There is also a big question of equity we will discuss. Literally who gets the biggest piece of the pie." #GGRegion
Today's topic is the food production, policy, use, consumption, systems and how they shape our communities. #GGRegion
Jim Greenfield, @DWTLaw partner &amp; Forterra Board Chair is introducing tonight's event. #GGRegion
and Scott Shapiro, Developer of Capitol Hill's Melrose Market and Managing Director of Eagle Rock Ventures #GGRegion
Linda Neunzig, Owner of Ninety Farms, a family-owned and run farm located in Arlington #GGRegion
Matthew Dillon, Chef and Owner of Sitka &amp; Spruce, the Corson Building, and Bar Sajor.  #GGRegion
We have a great line up of panel speakers: Branden Born, Associate Prof, Urban Design &amp; Planning, at UW, &amp; food systems expert. #GGRegion
The topic is "Food and the City: Making Density Palatable" focused on the intersection of food systems and urban policy. #GGRegion
We'll be tweeting tonight's panel discussion at @DWTLaw on making Puget Sound a great global region for 21st century. Follow at #GGRegion.
