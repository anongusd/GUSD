@UOsojc friends, GO APPLY! I never would have landed @MadrasPioneer w/o a piece I wrote as a @UO_Snowden  intern. My current boss saw it, and wanted to talk with me about coming to work for them.  You can learn so much during the program and it can lead to great things later on! https://t.co/TybCFax6Yg
