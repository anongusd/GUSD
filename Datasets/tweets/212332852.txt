@HotFoot_ @KFink61 @CLEsportsTalk @cavsdan @cavs I agree with getting rid of those contracts. But this team is certainly good enough for a 6 seed.
@KFink61 @CLEsportsTalk @cavsdan @cavs The way I see the @cavs is this. We need to score a Kawhi type player in the middle of the draft and Sexton has to turn into a HOFer. Otherwise, we‚Äôre basically stuck in the 4-8 seed purgatory.
@KFink61 @CLEsportsTalk @cavsdan It‚Äôs not your money. Why do you care? We have a terrible cap situation. We had 2 bad choices: 1) Resign the only player we could and compete. 2) Tear it all down and pray to god for good luck. Either way, @cavs aren‚Äôt winning a championship in the next 20 years.

@MurphyFerguson The only way to be good is draft in the top 10 and hit on multiple picks in multiple years. I have no interest in watching the Cavs get the 7 seed every year. Which is the route you seem to be suggesting. I‚Äôm sure many Cavs fans agree with you, though.
@MurphyFerguson I‚Äôd rather have our draft pick than a playoff run where we get bounced in the first round. Unless we plan on doing that forever. In that case, I still want our draft pick.

But if they didn‚Äôt deny the Russians election interference, if they lied less, and if Trump acted more like a leader and less like kindergartener, I could at least chalk my opposition up to policy rather than their existence.
@The_K_Cichon @AlexRaffalli @FBI And honestly, I don‚Äôt think the Trump campaign is smart (or stupid) enough to knowingly collide with Russians.

@The_K_Cichon @benshapiro And while I think voter ID laws were only created to make it harder to vote when only half Americans vote anyway, I think it should have been paired with broader voting access (early voting with longer hours, online access, etc).
@The_K_Cichon @benshapiro Every gun should be required to have an insurance policy. Those caught with a gun without a policy should be shot in the face and the gun should be destroyed. Penalties need to be serious.
@The_K_Cichon @benshapiro If I walk into a precinct in Ohio, I can vote but my vote doesn‚Äôt count unless I go to BOE with an ID within 48 hours. That applies to 25 other states. Those same states do not require a background check at a gun show. So sure, ID required. But it can be fake. Voting - harder
@The_K_Cichon @benshapiro That‚Äôs literally not true. At all. https://t.co/9m5CBJSFtC
@The_K_Cichon @benshapiro Typically, it‚Äôs bad to argue policy through memes. I‚Äôll say this, no state should exist where it‚Äôs easier to buy a gun than to vote. Whether you support rolling back voter suppression or think it should be easier to purchase firearms speaks to what you value.
@The_K_Cichon @benshapiro In states where it‚Äôs hard to vote, it‚Äôs easier to buy a gun. In states where it‚Äôs easy to vote, it‚Äôs harder to get a gun (legally). So it‚Äôs more nuanced than this general statement. https://t.co/fUnj8pCAge
