Next move, if the #TaxReform plan passes, will be proposals to cut Medicare, Medicaid and other important domestic programs for low and moderate income families. In the meantime, cities will be left holding the bag of this trickle down strategy.
Instead, this bill will saddle our children with even more debt to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy and large corporations.
The JCT report released today provides stark analysis that the Senate #TaxReform bill will add $1 trillion to the national debt, despite claims that it would raise enough revenue to offset the measure’s $1.5 trillion in debt.
