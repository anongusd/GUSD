@suzanne184 I agree - that's why I don't consider myself to be part of either one of them. That's crony capitalism, which goes against free market capitalist principles.
@Mnorinsberg Thank you!
I am a libertarian/conservative mix, but I find myself getting extremely frustrated with Trump because of his ignorance of the bubbles that I'm warning about AND the fact that he's actually contributing to their inflation - see my recent take:		https://t.co/8KfmiPn3Zr
It's frustrating because I'm caught in the middle between the radical left and Trump supporters who think today's asset bubble is really "America being made great again!"		Trust me, the mainstream Trump people don't like me either for my message!		https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO
I feel like I'm being shunned in the media because I'm advocating for free markets, sound money, and limited government. The mainstream media (including the financial media) is absolutely dominated by left wing personalities who hate capitalism. It's a total shame.
It's amazing how AOC just comes out of left field, gets a Netflix deal, gets all this media coverage, and yet I'm toiling for years, backing my claims with real data, and getting virtually zero help to get my message out (aside from grassroots social media followers - thank you!)
I'm being 100% honest here: I really believe that the radical left is getting A LOT of help from behind the scenes. They're getting help from the corporate media. 		I can contrast that to my own experience where I feel 100% alone in getting my message out. I am really frustrated.
It's amazing how left-wing calls to "soak the rich!" and "we need socialism NOW!" get thousands of retweets, yet the TRUTH behind America's inequality (see below), gets a "meh" response. Come on! Help me get the word out!		https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO
The answer to growing inequality is to strike at the root by working to defuse the dangerous asset bubbles, by reining in or shutting down the Fed, and by shoring up the integrity of the U.S. dollar again.	https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO
Instituting socialism, much higher marginal tax rates, and wealth redistribution are not the answer because they ignore the actual cause of the problem.	https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO
The most recent household wealth bubble has benefited the rich over the middle class and the poor because the rich own a disproportionate amount of assets such as stocks and bonds, which have been inflated by the Fed since the Great Recession.	https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO
U.S. household wealth recently hit a record of 535% of the GDP, while the historic average since 1952 is 384%. When U.S. household wealth reaches an extreme relative to the GDP (as it did in the prior two bubbles), a correction is in the cards. https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO
"To summarize, America's growing wealth inequality is not the fault of capitalism, but of central bank market intervention, which goes against the very principles of capitalism."		https://t.co/3tg0qEEPOO

The debt binge of the past several decades caused global debt as a % of GDP to reach an all-time high of 225% in recent years. Unfortunately, the global economy is heading toward a point of total debt saturation and, ultimately, collapse: https://t.co/AfV7dFHVXk https://t.co/KhwoKLFkBI
Global debt has surged by nearly $150 trillion since 2003 and $70 trillion since 2008. As bad as the 2008 crisis was, the next crisis will hit the global economy even harder simply due to the fact that an additional $70+ trillion in debt has been added. https://t.co/AfV7dFHVXk https://t.co/p6Chyq9FBv
The point I want to add to this debate is that there is a very real risk that soaring global debt will cause another severe economic crisis (likely a full-blown depression), which will reverse a portion of the gains made in poverty reduction.		https://t.co/8IHj4SetfW

@lunatictrader1 I'm still going to continue warning about unsustainability. I will never be able to be at ease knowing that we have such high and rising levels of global debt. I can never "just believe"!
@lunatictrader1 It really doesn't matter to me anymore. Trading is done and over with in this fake market, as far as I'm concerned.
@lunatictrader1 I am no longer discussing tactical markets/trading publicly. There is no sense in a market that is controlled by the Fed. I only want to focus on the big picture and warning about unsustainability and advocating for free markets.
@lunatictrader1 No, I'm referring to trading with the trend and not against it in general terms. Plus, there are multiple time frames, so you can be short-term bullish, intermediate-term bearish, and longer-term bullish, for example.
@DrSvenRingbinde True
@stickycactusink It does because the Fed saw enough risk that THEY panicked. They wouldn't have done that if they weren't genuinely worried.
@lunatictrader1 But I'm not telling people "ok, now it's time to short!" There's a lot of liability with that and I don't want to deal with it.

@BeRichLife Complete chaos, war, crime waves, hunger, rioting, etc.
@barrybonds78 Well, there's a lot of truth there. I will continue to warn as an activist, but I am also building my own pile of hard assets.
Either you believe in sound money or you don't. Either you understand that a debt-driven boom (like we have today) is unsustainable or you don't.		If you think a debt-driven economy is sustainable, there's not much I can do to change your mind. You're going to have to feel pain.
"Central banks are just going to keep flooding the world with liquidity until paper currencies are destroyed. That's the endgame."		How long until that happens? It's literally unknowable by anyone. Humanity has never been here before. That's why it's so maddening.
I'm focusing more on my own survival. I can warn millions of people, but can't make people believe in this message deep down inside. People have to feel the pain.		All it takes is a spurious Fed-driven rally to erase so much of my efforts to warn people. 		https://t.co/mtQpbGfgkp

The left actually LOVES our growing inequality. Why? Because it's a tremendous opportunity for them to push socialism, which is all about control. 		No, we're not going to let them. I'm going to expose this truth until I'm blue in the face. We WILL win.		https://t.co/2oPFZO5cS9

What is lost on left-wing wealth inequality alarmists is the fact that America’s wealth inequality is not a permanent situation, but a temporary one because the asset bubbles behind the wealth bubble are going to burst and cause a severe economic crisis. https://t.co/2oPFZO5cS9
As I’ve explained countless times (but nobody seems to listen), growing U.S. wealth inequality is the byproduct of an unsustainable bubble in asset prices such as stocks and bonds: https://t.co/2oPFZO5cS9

@dr_crouton Yes, I agree - and that goes for QE as well.

@KiperHolly Well, there's an easy solution, thankfully: https://t.co/dHxnbPn6RY
The bottom line is that you need to hold a variety of hard assets in these times. This is non-negotiable. If you must hold stocks and bonds for income, at least the hard assets will hedge the paper side of the portfolio to some extent.
@StrikeEagleII Thank you!
Being a market strategist, a stock picker, economist, etc. is a complete joke and waste of time nowadays with these fake, manipulated "markets." What's there to analyze? Nothing. You may as well throw those fancy degrees in the garbage. Those days are long gone...
I'm not a bull or bear in a traditional sense. I'm a skeptic of our debt-based economy, the recovery, etc.		As we head into the endgame, the "markets" will go completely haywire in an unpredictable manner. They may even make new highs, but it will be very unhealthy.
As we head into the endgame, this market is going to become untradeable (even more than it is now). It's going to chop &amp; slop and slice &amp; dice all over the place. Basically, you will lose if you're trading the *paper* markets - it doesn't matter if you're a bull or bear.
Because these "markets" have become such a joke, I am no longer dealing with the tactical side of them. They're going to shake themselves to pieces - that's all I know. I have zero passion for trying to analyze the day-to-day noise. I just care about the big picture &amp; endgame.

I don't care if I lose 99% of my followers in my battle against @AOC's communist movement. That's a calculated risk that is well worth taking. I will sleep like a baby.		Anyone who is for that movement is a despicable human being that I want nothing to do with.

What a luxury that you can complain about so-called "inequality" on your iPhone and on social media that was created by capitalists.		Talk about the caviar of problems...
The left is creating irrational hysteria about the wealth/income gap so that they can institute socialism and, eventually, communism. 		They claim that it is an inherent flaw of capitalism. 		WRONG. It's an inherent flaw of *central banking*: 		https://t.co/kly6r7rudu
The left wants you to believe that our wealth/income gap is a grave, imminent crisis. Meanwhile, much of it is driven by an asset bubble that has inflated the wealth of the rich. Our poor live like royalty relative to how most humans have lived for thousands of years.
There is a growing hatred and desire to "soak the rich."		This stems from jealousy and a belief that capitalism is a zero-sum game and that the wealthy have gained their wealth by stealing. That is not true - capitalism is a positive-sum game in which wealth is actually created.

@redmondlonghorn Yes, I believe that.
@lizNNP Absoluty. I'm not anti-technology, by any means! I'm just referring to the tech startup frenzy that I believe is a byproduct of the Fed's loose monetary policy (creating thousands of speculative, dubious companies that produce very little of value, etc.).

@lizNNP Literally everything you're saying right now could be said in the late-1990s during the dotcom bubble. I'm not saying that technology is going away or is a bubble...I'm referring to this startup/VC frenzy, the valuations, etc.
@redmondlonghorn I know, right? But common sense is not so common. Most people are True Believers in this bogus boom and are lapping it up. It drives me berserk.
Unfortunately, this tech bubble is going to end just like the late-1990s dotcom bubble did – in another disastrous bust.	https://t.co/XCqEfX0oNi
Though most people look at record VC spending as a sign of a strong, healthy economy, my research has found that the current VC boom is the result of another tech bubble that inflated due to the Fed's ultra-stimulative monetary policies of the past decade.	https://t.co/XCqEfX0oNi

@DogfatherMike Yes, I honestly believe it is rigged. But I believe we're approaching a breaking point.
@Advantage_Data Nice to meet you :)
I widened the upper bound of this resistance zone to 2,650 from 2,600. Why? Because *everyone* is watching 2,600, so there's likely to be a lot of algo-driven monkey business there = headfakes. 		https://t.co/PGk2gEqY70

@Ricksalin Why the "shortage"? It's because of speculators/investors taking advantage of ultra-low mortgage rates. They pushed housing prices up. We don't have to call it a bubble - "unsustainable boom" works just as well.

@Saul_alg True, but oftentimes, finance professionals are barely any better at spotting bubbles than lay people.

There is no major support in this market until the S&amp;P 500 gets to 2,100 to 2,200 (the 2015 and 2016 highs): https://t.co/tIBGRXmo6P https://t.co/2Ls7IDHsu2

There are been two major technical breakdowns in the S&amp;P 500 in recent months. The bounce of the past few days does absolutely nothing to negate those breakdowns, therefore nobody should be getting excited. We're still in a confirmed downtrend: https://t.co/tIBGRXmo6P https://t.co/2kK4iWIZMn
For now, this market bounce is simply a test of the 2,550 to 2,600 zone, which is now an overhead resistance. It's nothing to get excited about because it could easily end in another powerful sell-off if the market bumps its head at that level.		https://t.co/7bg6JyB8II

@KimmoMatikainen @LawrenceLepard @realDonaldTrump WRONG. You don't understand technical analysis, which is not my fault.

@everytimeicash I wouldn't be surprised to see that at some point - maybe it will even re-retest the former support at ~2,550.
I will not get excited about stocks until Warren Buffett's favorite indicator is at 1970s levels. Yes, that means that this market needs to go much lower. 		Stocks are dead for at least a generation - do not expect another V-shaped recovery like in 2009. That was a one-shot deal. https://t.co/UFNxlMUfb6
I hate when people tell me "but the bull market was driven by earnings!"		Stop. Not only did the market completely outpace its earnings, but those earnings are B.S. - they're dramatically inflated by cheap credit, debt-driven gov't spending, financial engineering, bubbles, etc.
This bear market is completely rational and justified. What is irrational and unjustified is the 300% bull market since 2009.		Watch my presentation to learn more: https://t.co/tq7SsfQRza
The S&amp;P 500 is down another 1% today. Don't be surprised by that.

What happens when the bubble "growth engines" of our so-called global economic recovery burst? The global economy experiences another financial crisis and depression. It's common sense. We inflated more bubbles to replace the bubbles that burst in '08.		https://t.co/UkFHxzqDGn

Post-2009 bubbles are starting to burst across the globe. This is extremely concerning because these bubbles are the "growth engines" of our spurious economic recovery after the global financial crisis. 		We only have growth due to debt and new bubbles.		https://t.co/UkFHxzqDGn
