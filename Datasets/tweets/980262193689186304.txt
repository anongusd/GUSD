@GwenGraham What a load of BS Gwen. The only way arming licensed and strictly trained teachers gets more guns and bullets is the initial purchase. beyond that, if the guns are not being fired to protect children, you don't need to buy more bullets. Except for training purposes.
@markfight @AndrewGillum It addresses the issue by not having it be an issue in the first place. Photo Voter ID's eliminate the need for a verified signature. A 2012 Washington Post poll found that 74% of respondents felt voters should present photo ID. (66% of independents, 60% of Dems.)

@RepTedDeutch "The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed."	- Thomas Jefferson, letter to to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824
@topatmac @RepTedDeutch First off, you do not have a right to be healthy. Second, why should law abiding citizens have to be responsible for the acts of criminals? Ever heard of self responsibility? That's where a person pays the consequences for their own actions.

@BShulkes @Oversquirrel @MomsDemand @GovMurphy there are roughly 265 million civilian guns &amp; only 14k deaths/year (36k total but 22k suicides). in the same yr, there were 57k deaths by poisoning, 36k motor vehicle, and 33k by falling.
@BShulkes @Oversquirrel @MomsDemand @GovMurphy Show me the statistic that says "owning guns makes you more likely to die by a gun". The article poses a hypothetical annalists while admitting it can't be proven; take longer to get = less deaths. Which is total BS. (1 of 2)

@RepTedDeutch It is not a crisis. There are more deaths due to poisoning, general accidents, and auto accidents than gun deaths. The actual facts do not support your agenda. Remember the summer of the shark? The media blew that one out of proportion as well.

@ryans028399 @TB_Times Source for what? It is no secret that the  Times is struggling financially. The Times got a $12 million loan from local investors in 2017, along with a $20 million secured credit facility, including a line of credit and two loans.
@Mshap89 @Kriseman the effect of the tax cuts &amp; new trade deals will take time to kick in. The increase in spending was to rebuild our military. The dems tacked on social spending. Cutting social spending &amp; giving tax cuts &amp; trade deals will reverse the rise in debt. Dems need to b on board.
@Mshap89 @Kriseman So what gun are you referring to? Two federal laws have essentially banned full autos in the US. One in 1935 &amp; the other in 1986. What more do you want?
@Mshap89 @Kriseman Actually, for someone making $40k it is a 3% savings and an increase in the standard deduction. Again, the debt is congress spending problem, not just Trump. Don't forget, Obama added $9 trillion to the debt.
@Mshap89 @Kriseman No one can buy or own automatic rifles. If you are referring to an AR-15, they are semi-automatic just like every other rifle on the market.
@Mshap89 @Kriseman The tax cuts help drive the econ. and lower unemployment numbers. You &amp; everyone else making more than $10k/yr are personally paying 1%-3% less in taxes in 2018...more $ in everyone's pockets.
@RonDeSantisFL Congratulations on your win. Next time you need to run a much better campaign.
@Mshap89 @Kriseman For one, the left pushes for more gun laws. Even Sewer Rick. The right to bear arms is a natural right. Gillum was pushing for over $1bil in tax increases. Trump has given us the lowest unemployment in history for blacks, women, Hispanics; Almost 3.9 mil taken off food stamps
@Mshap89 @Kriseman The problem with the debt is congress has not allowed for proper cuts in spending. That is on both parties.
@Mshap89 @Kriseman Open my eyes to what? The socialist agenda the left is pushing? The childish actions of the left as they attack conservatives in public? The calls of liberals to restrict and/or eliminate freedoms? The destructive taxing policies of the left?

@mattdude255 @AndrewGillum Taxes are not really hard to understand. Everyone that makes X in income pays the same amount in taxes.

@mattdude255 @AndrewGillum What documentary?
@mattdude255 @AndrewGillum No. the only people paying taxes are the ones getting paid income wages. Our current system is completely unfair to everyone. If you want everyone to actually pay their "fair share" (Gillum) you eliminate income tax &amp; make it  a user fee tax. We collect tax rev. from everyone.
@mattdude255 @AndrewGillum stop listening to media BS. Everyone pays the same rate for the same amount of income, especially after the new reforms. Income is income. Even, if you have deductions or get paid by non-income sources, you pay the same rate on actual income.
@SenJeffMerkley NO ONE gave away $1.5 tril. to the richest Americans. Taxes are the legalized theft of a private citizens or corporations $ by the Govt. Any reduction in the amount of $ collected in taxes is simply allowing the $ earner to keep what is rightly theirs.

@AndrewGillum What is a "Fair share"? We already pay the highest corporate tax rate in the world. People and companies come to FL for our favorable tax rates and you want to change that. That is BAD POLICY!

@Sol_Invictvs @AndrewGillum Socialized medicine shares a common trait with all socialist concepts in that, on paper it looks great, but in practice it is costly of both money and lives.
@Sol_Invictvs @topatmac @AndrewGillum typical socialist liberal, "someone else needs to pay for my stuff."
@Sol_Invictvs @topatmac @AndrewGillum You need 2 address &amp; correct the underlining reasons behind the increasing $. That starts by reforming medical malpractice litigation, Medicaid, Medicare, &amp; ins. Socialized medicine does't do that, it just makes taxes go up to cover the expense &amp; the quality of care decrease.
@Sol_Invictvs @AndrewGillum https://t.co/plfQdo1XyM

@RepCharlieCrist @FTA_DOT @RidePSTA States like CA with stringent mandates to use more renewable energy for their power grid, also have the highest electric rates in the continental US, 50% higher than the US average, &amp; widespread adoption of electric vehicles nationwide will likely increase air pollution
@Richard4Justice @AndrewGillum It now takes as many as 9 different people in a doctors office to do billing which obviously adds to the cost. Medicaid &amp; Medicare also pay months in arrears making DRs float the cost. A true Health care fix will start with litigation reform then address actual cost of care.
@davidhogg111 Obama did research and the results were not what he wanted. https://t.co/n2MgGMeEYO
@AndrewGillum No one in this country is denied access to health care. But Healthcare is not a RIGHT to be protected, or taken away, by the Government. You may not like the current $, but high $ is what happens with Gov. involvement, Medicaid, Medicare, insurance, &amp; unrestricted law suits.

@hannahlaylah @AndrewGillum @ChrisKingFL The Govt job is to protect its people &amp; econ. Many of the programs listed do just that, CIA, FBI, etc.,. Also, many of the other programs are disasters that are a drag on the country &amp; destroy people &amp; families, WIC, Welfare, student loans, Food stamps, etc.
@hannahlaylah @AndrewGillum @ChrisKingFL social democratic parties have been swept from power in the Czech Republic, Austria, France and the Netherlands, adding to a long string of losses since 2010. the same can be said of France, Greece &amp; England. Venezuela &amp; Cuba are shining examples of Socialism.
@AndrewGillum @ChrisKingFL If you want a Socialist govt with high taxes, massive restrictions, massive regulations, high unemployment, &amp; a nonexistent economy, this is your ticket.
@MomsDemand 13,000 people, that is all ages, were killed by guns in 2015. The majority of those death occur in Democrat run cities including Chicago, St. Louis,, Detroit, Los Angeles, etc. Looks like if we get rid of Dems, we cut gun crime.

@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump You have been making false statements the whole time. While you may not agree with my statement, it is a fact that Medicaid &amp; Medicare have increased the cost of health care. Drs. need on avg. 7 people to do billing, not to mention the billions in fraud in the system.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump No, it doesn't include making health care affordable. Again, health care was affordable before govt. intervention. The more intervention, the less affordable it becomes. Covering illegal immigrants through Medicaid helped to compound the problem.
Single payer insurance is a lie. Insurance supposed to be protection from unexpected financial loss. A form of risk management, which should primarily be used to hedge against the risk of uncertain events. Not as a means to pay for services. #TruthMatters #insurance
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Insurance is a means to protect oneself from financial loss. It is a form of risk management, which should primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss, not as a means to pay for care.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump The FDA, CDC, &amp; FAA are safety organizations. They help &amp; are needed to a degree but they also get in the way, cause problems, delays &amp; increase cost of products.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump ummmm, I said the roll of the Govt. is to protect its people. Go back &amp; reread my tweet. Health care is not the roll of the govt. Medicare &amp; Medicaid need to be completely revamped along with the ponsi scheme called SS.
#NIKETakesAKnee &amp; the stock takes a hit. The stock is down 2.70%. If they had put a member of the #MarineCorps or any other branches of the military, their stock would be going up. When will corporations learn that being anti-USA is not a winning game plan?
RT @charliekirk11: How can Democrats oppose Kavanaugh with such conviction when they didn‚Äôt even take the time or courtesy to meet with him‚Ä¶
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump No, Govt has a limited roll, protection of its people is its roll. Not to mention that you do individually pay for services that you "use". Ever get a tick or a bill for ambulance services? Before govt involvement via Medicaid/Medicare the medical system was much more affordable.
#Fact @TheDemocrats &amp; #Liberals cannot win an argument based in facts so they have to disrupt, shout down, or otherwise silence the opposition. They have no intention of compromising on any subject.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump As to Schools, I think we should attached the $ to the kid. E.G. if it cost $10k to educate a kid for 1 yr. &amp; he/she chooses to attend a public school, they get the $. If he/she go private, they get the $. if it cost $20k the family pays the difference.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Sorry Eric, I was enjoying the holiday. As to the police &amp; fire that is the roll of govt. You can add infrastructure to that as well. It is not the govt roll, or my responsibility to pay for your health care. that is your responsibility.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump Sorry, but you are flat out wrong. Even CNN has a piece from '17 on why it is a terrible idea; massive waiting lists, dangerous/life-threating delays in care, We need more DRs, more options for care, more competition, &amp; realistic prices. Removing govt &amp; ins will help do that.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump No, I believe in a hand up, not a hand out. It is not the government's responsibility to take care of you, me or anyone else. Their responsible for our general safety, power to print or coin money, to regulate its value &amp; represent our interests abroad

@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump My wife got a test, ins. didn't cover it. it was $1500. We said we would self pay that day in full.....final price $150. Ins, Medicaid &amp; Medicare make things worse, not better. ins reform, billing reform, med law suit reform, not socialized medicine.
@dblcup @elizabethforma @realDonaldTrump other countries also put limits on medical law suits....we don't. part of the reason cost are so high is because of insurance. Oh, I don't have to pay, insurance will. Run this test, insurance will pay for it....everything was cheaper before insurance. (1 of 2)

@TalkinToU @SenFeinstein "I think a lot of questions on parents' minds are, why a teacher would be pointing a loaded firearm at the ceiling in front of students," Superintendent PK Diffenbaugh told CNN affiliate KSBW. "Clearly, in this incident, protocols were not followed." the @NRA would agree
@RossShkurinskiy @RandPaul Funding of the cost of "education" can easily be separated. The best way to fund education is to affix $ to the student &amp; allow the student to select the school. This would help improve k-12 education by making all schools improve their educational caliber &amp; compete 4 students
@RossShkurinskiy @RandPaul the same can be said of public schools.
@SenFeinstein Spewing lies is a dangerous policy that should never see the light of day. Your statements are disproved by actual facts. Your, &amp; the rest of the socialist party's, constant lying is sicking.
@RossShkurinskiy @RandPaul Private mainly because it can't receive public funding. I partially disagree with your statement that "Many faith based schools do not match the academic standards of public schools" because they, in many cases exceed public school standards, as do most other private schools
@RossShkurinskiy @RandPaul just like schools that are "faith" supported don't receive govt. funds. They teach all of the same classes as "public" school, but they some various "faith" aspect, something that is not supported by all of the "public".
@RossShkurinskiy @RandPaul First, you did not answer my original question in the tweet you replied to.

@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr I wasn't referring to road or courts, I was referring to things you buy. The user fee/sales tax is just that, buy a car, pay the tax, go out to eat, pay the tax, stay in a hotel, pay the tax, etc. That is the only true "fair" tax. BTW, people that use the courts pay a filing fee.
@topatmac @BuckSexton @seanhannity The headline was derogatory towards both candidates and both are republican. I didn't' see them use derogatory terms for any of the democrat candidates.  Again, that's just one example.
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr So your idea of "fair share" is you &amp; going out to dinner, you make more than me so you have to pay a larger % of the bill. My idea of "fair share" is you &amp; pay the same % of tax on our meals but you pay for what you order &amp; I do the same.
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr I agree that peoples success is partially due to environment, However, the more you make the more you pay...punishment for doing well. Not fair share, more than fair share. Paying your fair share is everyone paying the same.....that is the definition of fair.
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr With a flat tax % e.g. you could set the min @ $20k, everything above is tax at 5%. everyone is taxed the same. With essentials &amp; medical not taxed everyone buying stuff, e.g. 300k car would pay 3%.
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr Your confusing 2 different types of taxes. With a flat tax, based on income, everyone would pay the same %. A user/sales tax, people are taxed based on spending &amp; people who do not pay taxes, would, e.g. drug dealers, non US citizens (legal &amp; illegal) 1 of 2

@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr A flat tax/user fee tax/sales tax, taxes everyone equally. You actually bring in more money because your tax base increases. You can still refund everyone below a "poverty line" &amp; essentials &amp; medical are not taxed, but that $1000 dinner is. #flattax
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr You apparently don't want a fair tax, you are pushing a progressive tax that punishes success. A fair tax taxes everyone equally. Currently, we do not tax people that don't take an income, meaning, the "wealthy" that don't get paid income don't pay taxes. 1 of 2

@HillaryClinton It's been several months since you committed voter fraud, yet your still here. https://t.co/d74TPlr4Kb
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr We have a progressive tax system, the more you make, the more you pay. Accordingly, there is more room to cut taxes on people in higher tax brackets. If you want a truly "fair" system, you switch to a flat &amp;/or user tax/national sales tax system.
@RubesVoteGOP @repmarkpocan True refugees can seek asylum at numerous legal border crossings locations.
@grandsand @SenSanders @CFBurdeen @shaunking Many times people are released on their own recognizance if they have little or no past criminal record, or bail is set low. Unless you can prove otherwise, it is reasonable to assume most with high bail are multiple offenders or high risk.
@topatmac @BuckSexton @seanhannity That list would take way to long to produce, so here is just one very recent example https://t.co/zaRf45Kxyh
@RubesVoteGOP @AntonioSabatoJr I'll debate you on any topic you would like, but it appears you are the rube that has bought into the lies and misconceptions of the formerly liberal, now socialist left. You are right, out tax system is unfair, but it's not in favor of the rich.
@RubesVoteGOP @repmarkpocan People that cross our border illegally commit a crime.  '97 Flores settlement doesn't allow us 2 detain parents &amp; children, it requires the government must put the child in the ‚Äúleast restrictive‚Äù accommodations that r appropriate 4 their needs. Don't come here illegally.
@SenSanders @CFBurdeen @shaunking People do not go to jail unless they commit a crime; you cannot be convicted of nothing. You are lying to say that people are "convicted of nothing". Please give me an example of anyone in the US being "convicted of nothing".

@SenSchumer Obama care is a failure. The article states "health insurers like BlueCross that nearly tripled their initial Obamacare premium rates over the past five years of Obamacare". The new 2019 reduced premiums are still more than double initial rates.
@SenStabenow "The sky is falling" claim is the same BS claim liberals have been making for the last 40 yrs. Congress has the power to make a law that could forever cement the RvW ruling into actual law, if they wanted to. Kavanaugh's record show he follows the rule of law.  #TruthMatters
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump This is the same chicken little "the sky is falling" argument that liberals have been claiming for the last 40 yrs.....it is utter BS. Don't fall for it.

@jsayler NO, that is not what obama care was. First off it is not remotely close to the health care congress gave itself. Second, it was a lie in itself, premiums were skyrocketing every yr (116% in 2016), millions lost their Dr &amp; their original plans, &amp; it was collapsing.

@joe_nca @MayorLevine @SenBillNelson @Kriseman @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @TheView No one praised him. Conservatives tried 2 make it an issue but main street liberal media wasn't having it. Obama placed kids with human traffickers https://t.co/PJk4L96X44  &amp; actual cages https://t.co/9ZAAKudMH7  Liberals didn't displaying any of this made-up outrage either.
#Liberals always use the same talking points against #Conservatives, regardless of the issue, facts, or decade (only for the rich, against women, hurts elderly, hurts children). From Court nominees, taxes, new laws, old laws, health care, it is the same damn nonsense every time.
@joe_nca @MayorLevine @SenBillNelson @Kriseman @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @TheView Any time we send parents 2 jail, they r separated from their kids...at least until they r processed &amp; released on bond or otherwise. In this case, there r so many illegally crossing our border, processing is taking a long time. The same thing happened during the Obama admin.
@joe_nca @MayorLevine @SenBillNelson @Kriseman @NancyPelosi @SenSchumer @TheView You are exactly correct, we do not "throw babies in jail". That's why kids are being separated from their "parents". The parents broke the law and are going to jail. The same thing happens to citizen's kids when their parents go to jail.

@Kristoph_errr @SenSanders Yes, you have a right to seek care. You do not have a right to have someone else pay for it.
@SenSanders But we will not remain the richest if socialist programs like universal health care are put in place &amp; other existing government subsidized welfare programs continue.

@TrefaultPaulina @GovernorVA @BarackObama Many people get sticker shock. The New York Times, long a cheerleader for Obamacare, reported that many people couldn't afford to use the health insurance that they have purchased because of the deductibles.
@TrefaultPaulina @GovernorVA @BarackObama Many states have lost more than 80 percent of their insurers: Alabama went from 23 to 3, Arkansas went from 24 to 4, and Wyoming from 21 to 1, just to name a few. Only New York did not lose over half of its insurers, going from 28 to 15 insurers, a 46 percent decline.
@TrefaultPaulina @GovernorVA @BarackObama Under Obamacare, the number of uninsured was supposed to decline from 50 million to 22 million in 2016 and remain at that level. Instead, there are still 31 million uninsured, and the number is never projected to go below 29 million, according to CBO.
