Opinion: Michelle Wolf was the big winner of the WHCD, not Trump	https://t.co/Zm18chiiM5
@rmayemsinger Michelle Wolf joke brilliant!
@mitchellreports @PressSec @margarettalev Where is the apology from trump for calling the NFL players that kneeled ‚ÄúSons of Bitches‚Äù.  Trump got a crooked lawyer, porn star &amp; mistresses payoffs, campaign officials pleading guilty and meetings with Russians. Now you want an apology from a comedian. Girl bye!
@howardfineman I‚Äôm truly a fan of Michell Wolf now. She said what must people in that room think.

@mschlapp @mercedesschlapp How can you pretend to be offend by jokes when you defend a WH that is under criminal investigation and trump who lies every day and makes you all look like fools!
