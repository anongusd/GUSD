Let other countries walk all over us and harm our country.  	Left: *says nothing 		Trump: we need to fix this and stop it. Let’s force immigrants to come legally and let’s stand up for ourselves to the nations. 		Left: OMG you are sooooo RACIST. we must resist.

@susanrichardso4 @SenatorCollins Notice that these things happened at the last minute. Even some “vital evidence” was brought out the day of the vote.
@susanrichardso4 @SenatorCollins Well I believe that this case got turned into a political case then a case for Dr. Ford. Some Democrats only wanted an investigation to delay the vote. There was enough evidence to come to a conclusion.
@solitaire360 @IWV @SenatorCollins Again never sent anyone to target Dr. Ford to harass her.
@solitaire360 @IWV @SenatorCollins Don’t know her Twitter
@solitaire360 @IWV @SenatorCollins Never have I attacked nor sent people to attack Dr. Ford. I have expressed my opinion about the case but never harassed her. I only have about 48 followers btw.

Ok the first 9 I can let slide. But the 10th that’s a blow of fallacy. The generalization fallacy of all men rape. When I take a woman on a date all I want is to get to know her. Pretty sure that 90-99% of men. Also you contradict tip 2 with 3-9. https://t.co/zOYhNiprWF
“-story does not make sense	-no evidence for claim	-witnesses deny claim	-witnesses cannot confirm or deny claim	-story keeps changing 	-other ridiculous accusations (ice thrown)		In other words just watch Christine Ford’s hearing.” Fixed it. Man these people don’t get it. https://t.co/61V4m9oCoe

@nayroftownsvill Good for you man
@abitofbrittUS Lol 😂 she's probably thinking "dang it my hubby has found my weakness" lol
@meatymcsorley Well atleast you aren't like some vegans I've talked to
@meatymcsorley Stuff like b12 vitamin d3, and most plants contain incomplete proteins. However with the right combinations you can get complete proteins
@meatymcsorley Also meat does give you other nutrients that is important that plants don't
@meatymcsorley Ok well obviously it's doable if you know what you are eating but, with plants you just heavily restrict your proteins.
@meatymcsorley Is she allergic to soy?
@veganvexation Well then she's probably eating a lot of soy
@Shan_Sweeney_ Yeah ik. Ik that you can be healthy on a vegan diet. I'm just saying it's harder when you are lifting big weights and don't supplement
Well then she's probably eating a lot of quinoa which is the only plant that holds complete proteins. https://t.co/0Z3O54K5q7
He's probably taking protein supplements. Which again I don't trust. https://t.co/t0SSfpG5f2
@zelda85044 Also I don't trust protein supplements. I also workout, so I wouldn't get the protein I would need
🤔🤔🤔mmmm let me think. Um yeah no.  For a guy like me who doesn't trust protein supplements and works out. I would need animals for protein https://t.co/MGvvtHYjA0

@syasicul @freedomisvegan @VeganRevoIution To deny the historical accuracy of the Bible is a completely idiotic move. The Bible is known as one of the best historical textbooks
@syasicul @freedomisvegan @VeganRevoIution Then why do most of them agree with the historical elements of the Bible
@syasicul @freedomisvegan @VeganRevoIution ??? It has been proven to be historically accurate man. Fuck off
@syasicul @freedomisvegan @VeganRevoIution A book that has been proven right
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution I don't believe in morality due to nature but what God says
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution Well technically due to the first pic. Christianity isn't a religion cause it's beliefs have been challenged over and over again
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution That argument is actually the wackiest I've seen. Since we have biblical manuscripts dating back before Constantine
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution Can you provide a cite for the original
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution If Jesus was vegan then why did he eat fish. Luke 24:42-43
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution https://t.co/T1jxccH7Kf this document looks in accurate compared to the Bible
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution Can you give me a reference. All that I am finding is background info
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution We have found manuscripts that date years before Constantine and prove the Bible's accuracy through the ages
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution What documents or articles do you have to back up your claims
@freedomisvegan @syasicul @VeganRevoIution Proof?
@chase_bonifay What I'm saying is that you can be healthy both ways
@Ceeckylol @VeganRevoIution It's nice to laugh every once in awhile
@Ceeckylol @VeganRevoIution Lol
@RoamingMil Good lol, my mind is dead right now from being bombarded by vegans
@RoamingMil I can see why you don't really like vegans lol.
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution https://t.co/pYsGFpxJEt
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution Bart Ehrman even agrees that the Bible is reliable.
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution No Christian and NONCHRISTIAN scholars all see that the Bible was not altered
@Alecram_mpa That's why you eat things in moderation
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution Then why do we have manuscripts dating back to about 25 years after Christ. There would still be eyewitnesses around during the writings
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution The Midevil ages are over bro. We have proof that the Bible has not been altered
@SherryKFree I'm being bombarded by vegans lol
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution It's true. Maybe you should do a little more research
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution We also have manuscripts dating back to before the "church" and the Bible stands to be UNALTERED
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution Fine replace one man with one group
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution God never endorsed rape. Rape never turned out well. The slave system back then was more like a job setting for people who didn't have money
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution So your telling me that one man tracked down all the millions of thousands of manuscripts just to change one area of the Bible
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution ???  Considering Genisis is in the Old Testament shows how well you know the Bible
To ALL vegans out there, I am not against veganism. You can be healthy. But you can also be healthy by eating meat.
@Ceeckylol @VeganRevoIution lol nice one. Even though I disagree
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution READ GENISIS 9:3 GOD SAID THAT IT IS OK TO EAT ANIMALS. clearly you don't know the Bible
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution How am I "pretending to be God" when God says that it is ok to eat animals
@Barbara4u2 sorry for the outbreak of vegans coming after me on one of your posts.
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Read Genisis 1:27 and tell me we weren't put over the animals
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Read Genisis 1:27
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 The point that I'm trying to drive is that God made is above animals and allows us to use animals as a source of food
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 How?
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 How is hunting for my meat rape? I also don't consider killing something that God says ok to as murder
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Because lions don't think that way. They are not as intelligent as humans
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Nope God allows us to use animals as food. You need to read how God set up the sacrifices for Israel
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Then why is there so much killing, even killing baby lambs
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 No I'm a Christian and will always be a Christian
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Elijah sacrificed an ok to God
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 He also helped The disciples fish
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 God gave the Israelites birds to eat and he sent ravens with bread and MEAT to Elijah
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Look at how the sacrifices went down
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Read all of chapter 9
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution Whatever
@Alecram_mpa You don't have b12
@Alecram_mpa Most of your studies are made by vegans who are very bias towards plants. Your point
@18_Miles_outx @Barbara4u2 Read Genisis 9:3
@FreePressKek @Barbara4u2 Yeah best be prepared but God can do more then just one thing
@Barbara4u2 @Barbara4u2 I'm not worried. Ik that God has my back.
@Alecram_mpa https://t.co/3Oy84FMLZV
@Alecram_mpa And omega 3
@Alecram_mpa Plants give you incomplete proteins. You don't get b12 and there are few significant sources of Omega 3. Meat provides b12, complete protein
@Alecram_mpa Yes you can be healthy being vegan. But you have to pay close attention to how many nutrients you are eating and what nutrients you eat
@Alecram_mpa But they do provide you with nutrients that plants don't provide or atleast the plants we eat
We don't kill them for pleasure. We kill them for food https://t.co/zzj0o48vRR
@f4wsupersonic Fine by me. I will still defend that fishing that I have done
@f4wsupersonic Sorry I can't do that. Meat is a great source of minerals that are not found in plants
@f4wsupersonic Commercial fishing is regulated by the government so that the fish does not die out.
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution You need to read your Bible before arguing with it
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution Second God commanded them to do so and there were requirements to how to sacrifice and what to sacrifice. God set it up not man
@syasicul @VeganRevoIution First stop putting words in my mouth. I never said that I sacrificed animals and especially not to myself. The Israelites did but to God
@f4wsupersonic Look I agree that there are some companies that take things too far. But there are others that do a good job with their animals
@f4wsupersonic Again read Genisis 9:3
@f4wsupersonic Well I get most of my meat from deer, moose, turkey, salmon and halibut that I catch or shoot
@f4wsupersonic Do you hear yourself right now? We don't steal fish. If we didn't catch them they'd overrun our water. It is highly regulated
@f4wsupersonic I don't agree with that. I never caught farmed salmon I caught salmon that was released into the wild and they returned to spawn
@f4wsupersonic Everyone messes up eventually we are all humans. We aren't perfect.
@f4wsupersonic I have been apart of the commercial fishing industry on both catching and processing and atleast in America your articles don't apply
@f4wsupersonic But you are using the Bible for help. So, so am I
@f4wsupersonic Well the disciples would actually sell their fish. That is what peter was complaining to Jesus when he told him to go back out
@f4wsupersonic @vegan_extremist @VeganRevoIution Well when the Israelites would sacrifice a BABY lamb the priests would cook the meat and offer it to the family for a meal
@f4wsupersonic Then why did he aid his disciples as they fished and made a basket of 3 loaves of bread and 5 fish into more to feed 5,000
@RikkuCruel69 @VeganRevoIution Me to
@f4wsupersonic ??? What? Human right abuses? How?
@vegan_extremist @f4wsupersonic @VeganRevoIution Well processing plants is a big factor of deforestation too
@f4wsupersonic Nothing is the same as in Bc times. It's modern day
@f4wsupersonic What if I processes my own meat
@f4wsupersonic If it is weak then how come it has survived so many years
@vegan_extremist @f4wsupersonic @VeganRevoIution Never said anything about humans
@f4wsupersonic Read Genisis 9:3
@ZairaMalpica @f4wsupersonic @VeganRevoIution ??? How's does not giving a fuck being a coward?

Double standard? https://t.co/qWgyr6gUdc

Yet most of the liberals decided not to vote as well https://t.co/Ch0fhVvhan

@SeanThomas99 You got this bro. I believe in you lol.

Looks like @peta has joined the feminist movement. Animals are not the same as humans. The differences are psychological and some physical. https://t.co/ncOOz1ljoE
@JoeSchnitzel2 @peta 😂😂😂😂😂😂great on bro 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
@peta I don't believe he did that for social media. I think he just wanted that deer.
@Sugar_Tits_Bear 😱😱😱😱😱 @Sugar_Tits_Bear is showing her face. What?! Now it's bearing's turn lol
@peta Ok ok yes it is bad to force animals to drink beer. But that happened ages ago.
@RoamingMil lol obviously they don't know the importance of family lol. I think you would make a great stay at home mom if you chose that path.
@poppy My gender is a male and you can't teach that. You also can't take it cause it ain't yours.
@Andywarski If Andy was king atleast we wouldn't have to put up with the bs that's been going around lol

@Frostedkekling @abitofbrittUS 🤔🤔🤔🤔well Jeremy I guess that we are just stupid for not liking feminism jk lol
@abitofbrittUS Let me get this straight. They don't like us using our knowledge and "smarts" to question them then complain that no man is smart?

@eurasianlion @UrashimaOtaru @RoamingMil No. All he said that people like the look of things and choose to look like that. No one is talking about "white victim hood"

@JessiciaVVV @Barbara4u2 So people who try to keep their bodies healthy, are actually fat shaming and harassing? Yeah makes a lot of sense that way. 🙄
@VeganGains @RoamingMil Come on dude cut her a break. You had a debate that you dominated. What more do you need?
@RoamingMil Who cares about you eating messy things like that lol. I'm probably messier then you lol.
@Ranting_Monkey Good luck bro. Is this about veganism again?
@Andywarski Blaire was soo funny in that video. But that chick knew she had been caught
@RoamingMil Awe man. I'm at an area with no wifi. Guess I'll have to catch the next one.
@Ranting_Monkey @JeffHollandaise You have one to. What is it a regular or does it have a cool feature to it? I have one that glows in the dark.

@emelyechaucer Thanks you to. God bless.
@emelyechaucer Well I beg to differ. Again I don't support him 100%. But he is still our president. He fails, we fail.

@SCOTNESS Yeah, that is why I don't pay much attention to replies.

@natnie @kat_blaque But "cis" people don't try to completely change genitals
@ChosenOfAshurha @kat_blaque Never said that kat did or didn't have surgery. Never tried to pry into her personal life
@peta I know plenty of farms that raise pigs in a more sustainable way and then butcher them and sell them.
@peta Not all pigs
But there are still those transgenders that get surgeries like Blaire White https://t.co/bgqeFQ5dhf
@kat_blaque If that is true then why do a lot of trans people go through surgery to get the body they want
Yeah cause obviously being male and female is strictly to assignment. It have nothing to to with the actual body. Hmmm seems logical? https://t.co/pWuguhhgnT
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis If I couldn't have kids, I would have to deal with it. But who cares I'm transphobic anyway
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis Every woman I fall in love with
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis Not necessarily, I just through that scenario out there
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis I wasn't trying to spark a debate I just asked a question
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis Never said that
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis But what if I want to raise some kids of my own flesh and blood
@Lumidingo @MarlerCharlie @RileyJayDennis No no you are right, there are. But I ask you why is it transphobic for a guy to want a natural woman.
@Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis But I'd still be transphobic right?
How bout I respect your beliefs and you respect mine. I think we can get along just fine. https://t.co/YSu1NJra8s
@Andywarski It would be logical
@Andywarski bro I love your videos. You inspired me to create response videos. It would be awesome if you checked out my channel
@RileyJayDennis Mine aren't a show or performance. It's just me sharing my views on the same topics
@MarlerCharlie @Lumidingo @RileyJayDennis I'm not on there side on this bro. Lol. I think a sexual preference is just that, a preference. Not transphobia. Lol
@RileyJayDennis They are when I do them
@RileyJayDennis That I agree with. There is righteous anger and unrighteousness anger
@RileyJayDennis So you are telling me that I'm transphobic even though I don't try to be? How does that work?
Can't beat this view. https://t.co/MbmZmHXpY6
@peta All I see is ham, pulled pork, and bacon.
@unpleasantbabe lol never heard a vegan say that before
@RoamingMil I would love you see your thoughts on this subject because I'm big into these
@RantingF No please tell me the real issue
@Frostedkekling @Blondes_tweets Totally agree with you bro.
@unpleasantbabe @kat_blaque Who said that they didn't
@VidiotGame @transscribe @RileyJayDennis @ESTBLSHMNT It's hindsight biasism. They don't want any contradictory views to their own. Personally being open is a better way of going at it.
@gogreen18 well a lotta people don't like your new path you have started down. But I support you in that I hope you see where the right is.
@transscribe @RileyJayDennis @ESTBLSHMNT She never said that she was going back on her views. Just that she was more open to talk to the "anti feminist" side
@RileyJayDennis The same an be said about the SJW vids. I have seen some pretty nasty comments from both communities it is not just the "anti feminists"
@StefanMolyneux @Frostedkekling I woulda say he was elected for both
@Ursidae19 @RileyJayDennis Same lol
@Ursidae19 @RileyJayDennis I'm on the right side and not everyone celebrates the harassers. I don't, I would rather people get along even though they have differences.
@Ursidae19 @RileyJayDennis All I'm saying is that there are going to be harassers on both sides. We already have proof of this. No one is perfect.
@RoamingMil I think you'd be a great Wonder Woman
Then what do you do when you get cold and there aren't heaters around. https://t.co/P4B9ZR4MDq
@RoamingMil Guess your a cop hater now jk lol
@RileyJayDennis "Anti feminists" are not the only people harassing and intimidating people tho.
@abitofbrittUS 👌🏻
@Toxic_Fem Hasn't made me gay

@RoamingMil I'm not much of a fan of Disney songs
@abitofbrittUS I can't wait to see what you have to say about fat acceptance this time lol
@abitofbrittUS 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
@neonfiona @toastmaster4321 I never said or implied that Riley doesn't take hormones. Don't just jump to conclusions I was just trying to give reasons of what they say
@neonfiona Yeah I was just saying that that is one reason why people have claimed that.
@RileyJayDennis So sorry again that I misunderstood you but one thing that tend to throw off people would be your Adam's apple or lump on your throat
@RileyJayDennis Oh wait you are talking about you. Sorry I misunderstood you.
@RileyJayDennis My brain
@RoamingMil I wish I could buy one but A) I don't have a credit card and B) I'm fishing all summer lol
@abitofbrittUS That's my argument for why abortion is also a man's issue lol
@RoamingMil I know plenty of men who put a bad name on men. I go by if you work hard you will be successful. I guess just some want to be lazy lol.
@JoyAnnReid @SeanThomas99 Still doesn't mean that he was in on it
@craigfhayes @abitofbrittUS @SRAugust114 I totally agree with you bro.
@craigfhayes @abitofbrittUS @SRAugust114 Kids need a father in their life. The father is just as important then the mother is.
Well gender is based off of sex which is based off of genitalia. There are only 2 sex which means there can only be 2 genders https://t.co/NAPOABaZOc
@abitofbrittUS It might be easier but not for the kid. Just saying children without a dad are more likely to be in gangs or go to jail then other kids
@abitofbrittUS Especially for men like me who want to raise a family with a mother.
@abitofbrittUS Some people just let fame get to their heads.
@RoamingMil just saw your new vid. I think I'm a little biracial but grew up in USA but never felt out of place. I'm Russian with some other

@Ranting_Monkey Keep it up bro
@FightFatAcptnce Makes tons of sense doesn't it lol.
@MaxineWaters @kat_blaque Trump is not going to be impeached.
@RoamingMil Maybe you were too much of a racist and transphobe lol
@RoamingMil I'm blocked by two different people lol
@cameronnahas @CopperCab  hey congrats on your journey. If you ever want any exercises to try. Dm me I'll show you some of what I do.
@RoamingMil @mrbuntykingalt Lol REEJEECCCTTIONNNNN!!! Savage Roaming! Lol
@RoamingMil @Ranting_Monkey @abitofbrittUS keep making vids guys. You guys are great and have inspired me to make similar vids on my channel
@RoamingMil You? Hate speech? Since when lol? I guess hate speech isn't actually hating anyone but just disagreeing with others lol.
Yeah rape culture is as real as seeing flying pigs. When women cry rape, the odds are against the men. https://t.co/DGS6DdlLt9
@gogreen18 So I guess it doesn't exist.
@gogreen18 Well it was a thing in biblical times. But these aren't biblical times anymore. Women have the same rights  as man.
@RoamingMil @wolfwithhat @gogreen18 I have been supporting her open mindedness
@abitofbrittUS I'd say the the same thing just vise versa lol
@Barbara4u2 I'm still subscribed
Yeah and women have consistently falsely accused men of rape. What's your point? https://t.co/e0EBE3GStW
RT @PortugueseGeese: If you're not your own #1 fan how can you expect someone else to be?

@gogreen18 That's one issue i have with SJW's
@Ranting_Monkey I got blocked by another account bacause I called the persons logic in to question lol
@gogreen18 Just thought that I'd let you know. I made a response vid to you red pill part 2. We don't have similar views but I support your open mind.
But "everyone" on this side is a "harasser" right? https://t.co/vkq0g2f92r
Yeah she is very arrogant and as proof talks to the other side and listens to them. Very logical Kat. https://t.co/qWOzh1Z7Hk
@gogreen18 👌🏻that's what a lot of us "anti-feminists" have referred to it as.
Yeah cause "every" husband thinks he owns her. But wait doesn't that ownership go both ways. The wife owns the husband and vise versa? https://t.co/TWpetLXuBl
@CopperCab Man, whatcha talken bout. Your gf left you? Why don't you cheat on her and show that she don't own you?
@abitofbrittUS Lol they think that you will finally cave if they hit you with that article enough times lol
@kat_blaque Then what is your point? So far all Laci has said is that she wants more convos with the other side.
@kat_blaque So saying that you want to talk to the other side is all of a sudden turning on people?
@marwilliamson Well as of right now there is more evidence of Mexicans crossing the border then the Russians altering the elections
@brianklaas Not to unpopular because everyone seems to talk about him lol
@Barbara4u2 I hangout with black dudes all the time. I guess some people just have their own way of thinking
@kelthecelt Use logic, you find it in your brain
@kelthecelt I wasn't denying that claim. I was just stating that if we were to just let isis walk into America then they would cause the most terrorism
@CopperCab I made a vid response to one of your vids bro
@DME123456789 @thetrudz @kat_blaque Yo it's ok if I save the meme right. I just think that it is hilarious.
@RoamingMil Me and you have very similar views about climate change.
@DavidAFrench Well you can't also stand up for the leftist in the play who decided to make Julius Ceasar at Trump and kill him in the end.
@MsBlaireWhite They do lol
@abitofbrittUS Cause they can't think of anything else cause us "anti-Liberals" keep debunking their other points. Lol
@cameronnahas @CopperCab I made a response vid to one of CopperCab's lol. It was his vid where he called out all of those tubers who use avatars in there vids
@cameronnahas I agree Cameron. Loosing weight is not a bad thing in my book. Maybe more people will take him more serious if he lost a few pounds. Lol
@DME123456789 @thetrudz @kat_blaque Lol good meme
@aparnapkin Ask men why they don't report theirs.
Yeah cause "clearly" white men are the only cause of gun violence. Even though there is more gun violence in gangs. https://t.co/giI6I0wCwh
@thetrudz @kat_blaque Ya know you are absolutely right. There is no sane white person who isn't rascist. Guess I need to check my "white privilege" lol.

@lib_proud Charges don't stand without proof. Just saying
@billmaher Name one evidence that proves Trumps ties with Russia. Oh wait there is none.
@billmaher But how do we produce the elements to create the products at kohls. Right by mining, something you guys don't get.
@RileyJayDennis Yes but that is rare. If you data a transgender you are pretty much guaranteed for your partner to be infertile.
@RileyJayDennis You've offended some people because the wording makes it sound like that if you don't date transgenders then you hate them.
@RileyJayDennis Actually they are interested in woman's natural genitals not artificial ones.
@RileyJayDennis Then why do you still bring it up. If you really don't care then you wouldn't keep bringing this up.
@RileyJayDennis Actually it's just a sexual preference. It's not transphobia. Maybe the person wants a kid made by there own genes.
Very patriotic! Actually these people want the very soldiers that provide them with freedom to be gone. #thelogicofwestboro https://t.co/UIeQLmQcLO

I agree. The Bible even says love and pray for your enemies. https://t.co/gcu1Z3nhs8
@RoamingMil The fact that people try to ban Christianity from schools yet create Muslim prayer rooms at school.
@adamtkearney I voted before I left for Alaska
@RoamingMil I guess that's all we are. Just some thinkers that don't care for anyone lol.
@TheDemocrats If it's "so unpopular" then why is everyone talking about it.
@GhostPanther Actually a lot of republicans are for gun safety. Just not gun banning
@CopperCab It's just wrong dude. I don't put it up with pedophelia but it is still disgusting. It is also not the best idea.
test success: https://t.co/WlUpEhS3Bj via @YouTube
@Ranting_Monkey I use an app called pocket video for my vids
@abitofbrittUS Lol they use transphobic like it is a word of oppression. But actually it means the fear of transgenders. Phobic is from phobia = fear
@kirbyisaboss I would but I'm way up north in Alaska lol
@abitofbrittUS I agree
@RoamingMil @Andywarski Nope you guys just have different views.  You would only be transphobic if you are afraid of transgenders. Phobic comes from phobia = fear
@rolandscahill He hasn't broken any impeachment laws so far
@RoamingMil Some people just don't get it. You work hard you will usually get paid hard
@RoamingMil She does not like complements on the film apparently lol.
@RoamingMil Well any criticism to the SJW community is considered sexist and racist.
That's brutal lol. https://t.co/YBphASwW9I

@RoamingMil You inspired my channel.
@RoamingMil The autocorrect must not like what you have to say lol
@RoamingMil So tell me if everybody is a white supremacist then why are there people against it? Guess he never thought of that lol.
@kelthecelt Just cause you are white does not mean that you are not a jihadist. But imagine how many more jihadist would enter if we just open borders.
@SteveRattner @realDonaldTrump Well think of it this way. Imagine if we let those refugees in and did another survey. I'm pretty sure isis would be that 82%
@RoamingMil Lol they are SJWs what do you expect. They love to complain about everything.
