@Pandasquare1 Have a nice day
@Pandasquare1 Well, it‚Äôs a shame you feel that way, but you are entitled to your own opinions.
@McmurdyD You are correct, we haven‚Äôt seen very much of Good Trump thus far, only on occasion. But consider this, Trump simply being neither Good, nor Bad can be a good thing for the nation at times too. Does that sound like the response of one of his voters? Nope.
@Pandasquare1 I don‚Äôt need to even try to humiliate you, the Left wing does a fine job of humiliating themselves without any aid whatsoever!
@Pandasquare1 We can simply agree to disagree and be done with this attempt at political discourse as well - again, just decide.
@Pandasquare1 Not at all, I stand by my speech. I said nothing at all incorrect, nor anything that could be in poor taste. You‚Äôre clearly dwelling on this to avoid actually answering direct questions - this is nonsense. Either we‚Äôll have a political discussion or we won‚Äôt, but decide already.
@Pandasquare1 That couldn‚Äôt be the farthest thing from the truth - go read exactly what I wrote...nothing about it was about you directly or at all degrading to anyone. I simply mentioned AA in attempts to help any readers better connect with what the discussion was about. That‚Äôs the truth.
@Pandasquare1 ‚ÄúDID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDER?!‚Äù
@JamieMathis1975 @DeX42XeD @cowardfish @AP ...that ‚Äòhate speech‚Äô isn‚Äôt free (I‚Äôll save you the trouble, legally it is free #TheConstitution), using ‚Äòmicroagressions‚Äô to attempt to justify disgusting acts of physical violence and destruction of property because feelings are hurt. Pure idiocy, and SJW‚Äôs are the extremists.
@JamieMathis1975 @DeX42XeD @cowardfish @AP 1) You said, ‚ÄúRepublicans of the future are extremists‚Äù - explain your own flawed thought process. The GOP has its flaws, but the Left is the side that has been going on a speech witch hunt the last 3 years and perpetuating idiocies like ‚ÄòSafe Spaces‚Äô and creating the illusion..

@DeX42XeD @cowardfish @AP So if you publicly condemn Moore for being an alleged creep and horrible person, I expect you to publicly condemn every left wing politician for being alleged creeps and horrible people. 		See, that is ACTUAL equality, and it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòconcept in fiction‚Äô when applied correctly.
@FoxNews So is turning off CNN and putting on Fox News - that‚Äôs actually good for everyone!
@cowardfish @AP ...and the views of my party are completely different from the false, irrational views you have accused us of having. You should really know your audience before spewing lies, and all sorts of idiocies to them.
@cowardfish @AP 4) Who the hell died and made you God? Who decided that you would be the one who acts as the ultimate grand master of morality and truth? Get off of your high horse and look into what I have been saying - if you had actually seen what I‚Äôve said, you would know that my views
@cowardfish @AP 2) I don‚Äôt hate Mexicans, not at all. 	3) I‚Äôm against abortion, but so what? The beauty of living in a free, westernized, civilized nation is that I can do, think and say what I want, and you can do the same and we each don‚Äôt have to care what the other party does.
@cowardfish @AP ...that don‚Äôt allow same sex marriage ceremonies to be conducted within the walls of their places of worship.
@cowardfish @AP 1) I‚Äôm a Libertarian, we believe in individual freedom and take the stance of removal of the government from marriage decisions completely. This allows everyone to live as they want, and makes it so the government cannot force acceptance of marriages on religious institutions...
@JamieMathis1975 @DeX42XeD @cowardfish @AP Also, allegations are only allegations. It‚Äôs hard to condemn anyone without physical evidence, a guilty verdict, or the accused party admitting it directly. 		Point being that we either condemn everyone, or no one BUT there has to be equal protocol in dealing with this.
@JamieMathis1975 @DeX42XeD @cowardfish @AP Also, I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump, so there‚Äôs that. 		I don‚Äôt think you should go into Moore, there are more people on the Left that have been both accused and proven to have taken part in sexual misconduct of all kinds. All parties involved are terrible, sides don‚Äôt matter here.
@JamieMathis1975 @DeX42XeD @cowardfish @AP ‚ÄúThe alt-right has taken over ur party...‚Äù 		Every single available piece of research states that the Alt-Right is only 10%-15% of the GOP so right off the bat, you are incorrect. That isn‚Äôt a takeover, and I‚Äôm a Libertarian so I don‚Äôt see the connection you were trying to make
@Pandasquare1 When Trump does good things as POTUS we all should be happy about it and cheer regardless of party affiliation - when he does bad things as POTUS we should all be upset about it and boo regardless of party affiliation. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.
@Pandasquare1 Actually I just said ‚ÄúAA‚Äù and you went into freak out mode. Seems rational. Still waiting on all 7 of my questions to be answered by the way - care to start on those?
@Pandasquare1 I never once said he was a perfect, or even decent human being to begin with but if he isn‚Äôt breaking the law (with proof) or doing things that are hurting the country, his personal moral makeup isn‚Äôt a concern of mine. He just needs to be a good POTUS for the nation.
@Pandasquare1 1) Can you prove this intent? I think only I can say what the intentions of my own speech are/were. Perhaps I should have offered a trigger warning before using free speech to take part in political discourse...perhaps next time. 	2) Do you intend on answering my questions?
@Pandasquare1 Do you intend on actually answering any of my questions or just ignoring, and deflecting to your own feelings based hypotheticals?
@Pandasquare1 It‚Äôs indecent to even bring up AA in conversation all because you claim to be an alcoholic? I didn‚Äôt realize calling you out on a quote you lied about and referencing a support group is considered an ‚Äúattack‚Äù.
@Pandasquare1 I didn‚Äôt realize that talking about a support group would be considered an ‚Äòattack‚Äô - wow, I guess our standards for attacks have really changed recently...
@Pandasquare1 Care to explain how being a non Trump voter that remains unbiased and impartial about Trump has proven you right about anything? I‚Äôm actually really curious here
@Pandasquare1 Proven right about what? You haven‚Äôt said one factual thing this entire time...		You‚Äôre actively confusing being a supporter with being unbiased, and there‚Äôs nothing similar at all between the two.
@Pandasquare1 @landonbroper @thehill If/when Trump breaks an actual law I will be the first to condemn him for it - if he acts immorally (WITH PHYSICAL PROOF OF THE SAID ACTION) I will condemn him, but I will not bad mouth the man if he hasn‚Äôt done anything worthy of it.
@Pandasquare1 I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump, I just don‚Äôt go out of my way to hate on him everyday because that‚Äôs nonsensical. I‚Äôm a Catholic actually, and I didn‚Äôt lie. Remember, you are the one making up quotes in between AA meetings.
@Pandasquare1 I‚Äôm not backpeddling at all - I spoke very clearly in black and white language and I stand by it. I said that we should be impartial, and we should. Meanwhile you are making up false quotes because it makes you feel better about your own obvious problems #Logic
@Pandasquare1 @landonbroper @thehill 1) ‚ÄúWe support Trump (when he is Good Trump)...‚Äù was the actual beginning to my tweet. 	2) There‚Äôs nothing wrong with applauding Trump when he does something good for the country.
@Pandasquare1 Care to show me where I said that I hated Democrats or Liberals? That quote is completely fabricated...
@Pandasquare1 @landonbroper @thehill He didn‚Äôt get my vote. I‚Äôm not a supporter of his...I am saying that I will applaud him in his positive actions and boo him in his negative actions. That is how we all should be with politicians...IMPARTIAL &amp; UNBIASED

Are you saying that whether or not someone supports the protest is predetermined by the color of each individuals skin? That sounds a lot like racism to me.
@NotSara_Sarah @FoxNews @BurgessOwens @NFL No, I want people to know the difference between an actual racist act, and hearing/seeing people that they disagree with (mainly politically) and just blaming it on bigotry. Never once did I say anything you just said above. This protest is a blatant failure - it‚Äôs comical almost
@NotSara_Sarah @FoxNews @BurgessOwens @NFL Ohhh, so implications are now concrete, factual information? Good to know! 		This isn‚Äôt even about ‚Äòinstitutional racism‚Äô anymore, it‚Äôs about whether or not you respect the flag, our country, western civilization or not...like it or not, the conversation has been changed 100%
@NotSara_Sarah @FoxNews @BurgessOwens @NFL Everyone on the Left that is so quick to blame racism for any and all misfortune are currently doing nothing to solve the issue.

@NotSara_Sarah @FoxNews @BurgessOwens @NFL 1) Who was quoted saying it ‚Äúproves‚Äù anything?

@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews I support the constitution and ending actual racism, not protesting when it doesn‚Äôt work. I enjoy actually succeeding and achieving my goals.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews I was simply verifying if you were giving me an actual quote or not. Throwing the idiocies of Trump in my face does nothing because I haven‚Äôt supported him this whole time and he didn‚Äôt get my vote in the first place.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews Protesting is a right we have, but that doesn‚Äôt make it any less ineffective or stupid - however, it‚Äôs fun to laugh at the repetitive idiocies of these people.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews You said that Trump and Fox News both said ‚ÄúYou hate our country! Fuck you!‚Äù and that wasn‚Äôt said once in what I read just now. You gave a false quote
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews No, they CAN protest whatever way they want, but if they protest in a way that has this kind of end result, they deserve to fall flat on their faces and be mocked.
@SixCelled @BleacherReport 4) Children? We‚Äôre talking about college aged adults here, they need to be exposed to the good and bad of both sides and form their own political opinions on their own. That is the very nature of living in a free society and these professors are poisoning the well.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews 3) Taking a knee, raising a fist etc. hasn‚Äôt done anything for anyone - it‚Äôs just plain idiotic. I‚Äôm a person of color and I openly laugh at these people making fools of themselves on national television. Its no way to bring about civilized conversation.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews 1) We can agree the conversation has been morphed	2) I‚Äôm not a Trump voter, and where he surely has his share of flaws and vocal idiocies I don‚Äôt believe he, nor Fox News ever said that. If I‚Äôm wrong, please show me a quote.
@SixCelled @BleacherReport 3) The Left has its horrible people and crowds too...do we really need to open that entire can of intolerant worms?
@SixCelled @BleacherReport 2) The Alt-Right is maybe 10% of GOP voters - these idiots don‚Äôt have nearly as big a voice or following as the news outlets want you to think. Trust me, they aren‚Äôt going to be able to do anything, but they have the right to be racist idiots with their speech - Like it or not.
@SixCelled @BleacherReport 1) Because the adults that run the heavy majority of universities/colleges are 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs flower children that listened to Steely Dan and smoked pot to ‚Äòstick it to the man...MAN!‚Äô - these people are liberals, and that‚Äôs fine, but they need to be unbiased in classrooms.
@SixCelled @BleacherReport They can be diagonal, upside down or any direction they want like the Wonka-vator (if you don‚Äôt get this reference, look it up) but they need to be objective and unbiased in how and what they teach. That isn‚Äôt a grandiose request.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews ...room for personal political interpretation
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews ...made damn near everyone choose a side and stick to it. That isn‚Äôt how you stop racism. Protests just don‚Äôt work like people think they do - this has become a TOTALLY different conversation and that could have been avoided if it was protested in a better fashion with less..
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews I would tell them that while they have the right to make fools of themselves publicly, the form of protest they chose hasn‚Äôt done anything for the original cause. We should be rallying together to combat actual racist acts and confirmed racist people, not using a platform that...
@ryants1999 @BleacherReport We ought to switch schools then - it‚Äôs absolute lunacy up here.
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews Libertarians don‚Äôt want to shut down speech that we don‚Äôt agree with and attempt to make that speech forbidden and not free when it is...that would be a modern Left character flaw
@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews We are all allowed to think however we want, but there is nothing wrong with taking part in political discourse &amp; attempting to sway someone else‚Äôs thinking by giving them factual, non feelings based information that allows them to view things differently and decide on their own

It has everything to with the fact that the heavily majority of college campuses in this country are operated and inhabited by Left wingers that intentionally, and unintentionally preach their own political agendas to college students.

@ManInBlack815 @FoxNews Actually, it would only be impinging on the freedom of others of legislation was passed that forbids them to think, say, do and preach how they want.

We need to do more things to separate ourselves from the Alt-Right...		Because we will never gain the support of moderate leftists in future elections as long as these stooges are parading around on the TV. They think they speak for all of us, we need to show them that they don‚Äôt
@FoxNews @FoxNews WE KNOW THIS ALREADY, tell the left wingers this. You know, the idiot protesting type without a shred of decency on their bodies? Yeah, them. They need to hear this.
I‚Äôll never understand the people that on Sunday claim to want civilized political discourse with people of all political persuasions the when the alarm goes off on Monday they want to silence everyone that thinks differently then they do...		Idiocy, pure idiocy

@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian It exists to ensure that the people protect themselves from other people &amp; step in only when they must - not to provide anything for anyone. Small government &amp; equality of opportunity, not big government &amp; equality of outcome. The responsibility to provide is on the individual.
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP No, I just think that people who work hard should be rewarded and that no ones hard earned money should ever fund social programs or go directly to other people they didn‚Äôt earn it themselves. Capitalism and liberty.
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP If/when the day comes that he is tried and if it can be proven that those things actually happened I would be completely against his presidency rather than on the fence about it. Everyone deserves due process of the law and a fair trial by jury
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian How will anyone police this absurd hypothetical law you are suggesting gets put into place? It‚Äôll never happen. Everyone should obey the law and pay their taxes, but sensible, hard working Americans should speak up about the injustices of taxation in civilized, respectful fashion
@Benj_oman @RickDover2 @AP Also our economy has been on the uprise in the past year, and the last 6 months especially. He‚Äôs created jobs. He‚Äôs not using divisive identity politics to push his political agenda. He isn‚Äôt bowing down to other leaders. So far he has been Good Trump.
@Benj_oman @RickDover2 @AP Well there are 24 hours in a day, I‚Äôm sure he does a lot of things. Could you be more specific as to what kind of thing I should bring to your attention? I‚Äôm assuming you mean a good thing - well, Trump has put sanctions on North Korea and it was much needed.
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP Saying that Americans have the right to their own opinions makes me an anarchist? Not even close, it‚Äôs simply called tolerance and respecting the fact that freedom of thought, and word are protected in our great nation. You should try to be a bit more tolerant and factual
@Benj_oman @RickDover2 @AP People are allowed to support Trump as the things he has done so far have not all been bad, and he has kept his word about what he wanted to accomplish during his presidency. He is being treated like a criminal when he isn‚Äôt even close to one - he just tweets far too much
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP EXACTLY, so if there is no current outcome from legal action being taken, he has my support. He has not done anything worthy of the kind of ridicule he receives
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian Is someone going to be checking public restrooms for people using the sinks that didn‚Äôt pay their taxes? That seems a like a complete misallocation of resources and taxpayers money, since that is how the ‚Äòtax evading water supply police‚Äô will be funded presumably. Total nonsense
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian Libertarians will always pay out taxes as long as we are legally bound to, but we aren‚Äôt going to just be okay with it. We are outspoken about opposing it and we have the right to be. I do believe that anyone that is here and wants to use those things can whether they pay or not
@Benj_oman @RickDover2 @AP I am not a Republican so I‚Äôm not sure exactly what you expect from me. Trump is the current face of the GOP, he isn‚Äôt the party himself - that is pure idiocy to think that. Greed is a bad thing, but competition and capitalism are both great things, don‚Äôt confuse them.
@Benj_oman @pepeisacat @AP That couldn‚Äôt be more incorrect - someone can be for a cause, against a cause or remain undecided or indifferent so long as they choose to. See, we live in a free country and have this wonderful thing called the Constitution that allows US citizens to make their own choices

@pepeisacat @Benj_oman @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian Every of age American citizen that enters a consensual agreement (a contract) with a party that is willing to pay for a good or service being done deserves every cent of their own hard earned money. Nothing about taxation is fair. Nothing.
@pepeisacat @PlsNoStepOnMeh @Benj_oman @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian ...to be run by other people that tell you how your own hard earned money will be spent. Those are facts. Values, culture and all around upbringing are the things that shape people in a civilized, free society as ours greatly is

@pepeisacat @PlsNoStepOnMeh @Benj_oman @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian I‚Äôm glad you said that because it only helps me further illustrate why what you are preaching (and leeching) is wrong.

@pepeisacat @Benj_oman @AP @RandPaul @beinlibertarian It‚Äôs too bad that you are so uneducated. Nothing selfish about individual liberty, small government and equality of opportunity - equal, fair competition is a great thing. 		It‚Äôs SO selfish to expect the government to play mommy and daddy with taxpayers money. That is theft.
@benshapiro Left wing hypocrisy? Nooooo, when has that ever happened? üòíüòí

@emmankom @piersmorgan At least TRY to stay on topic, and apply basic reading comprehension. We can have a political discussion, and I‚Äôm glad to do so, but we will not get anywhere if you are unable to understand what I am saying exactly
@emmankom @piersmorgan No, I never said anything about ‚Äòreducing guns‚Äô. The constitution is the constitution, and gun owners that are law abiding citizens with no detectable traces of mental illness have the right to own legal firearms
@emmankom @piersmorgan The Left has been losing on this issue, and they will continue to lose on this issue. Guns aren‚Äôt going anywhere in this nation. I am not a gun owner, BUT I‚Äôm a believer in protecting the rights of all Americans and protecting the constitution as it currently stands. End of story
@emmankom @piersmorgan Feelings don‚Äôt matter, emotions mean nothing.
@emmankom @piersmorgan No, I have not and that is EXACTLY why people like me should be openly chiming in on the issue - logic, facts and concrete evidence/statistics are what leads to better policy and resolution in this case...people with emotional connection to guns need to stay out of it.
@emmankom @piersmorgan I think the solution is to upgrade the level of background checks, and to more importantly screen for mental health issues initially, and every 6 months after the citizen in question takes ownership of the firearm.
@emmankom @piersmorgan ...to deliberately violate the guaranteed, constitutional rights of law abiding American citizens. He is completely out of line, and what he wants won‚Äôt ever happen. The right won‚Äôt have it - the Left wants to ban all firearms in this country, even if they only whisper about it
@emmankom @piersmorgan Really? Wow, I didn‚Äôt realize that American Gun laws and policies were a global issue. Piers Morgan wants to ban semi-automatic rifles from all American citizens, but keep them in the hands of government and law enforcement. It isn‚Äôt his, nor anyone‚Äôs place

@OfficeOfMike @Cernovich @CBS @cnnbrk @abcnews @CBSNews @FoxNews God forbid an elected official gets thirsty and quenches his thirst with water... CLEARLY this is a prime example of the many evils of #ThePatriarchy and #WhitePrivilege üòÇüòÇüòÇ

RT @AP4Liberty: Leave Taylor alone! Taylor Swift Refused to Give Her Political Opinion and Now the Media is Attacking Her for it https://t.‚Ä¶
@AP4Liberty Because those sharks didn't want her political opinion...		All they wanted was for her to either agree with Leftist policies and agenda so she can be praised, or to disagree so they can label her a conservative Nazi and attempt erase her from history like a Confederate Statue

@chuckwoolery But let me guess...this isn't considered a blatant act of racism by the left?
Allow me to speak Frankenly...taxation is theft 		Too soon? @beinlibertarian
I'm just waiting for @piersmorgan to debate with me on American politics and policy. By debate I mean me verbally ripping his agenda apart, and completely breaking him down mentally. I'm 22 years old Piers, why are you afraid?
This seems mildly inappropriate and in poor taste... https://t.co/q7pqeGAYsx
@QueenCityLib @BernieSanders The Democrats are doing to Bernie what the Lakers did to Kobe...treating him highly in the present for past endeavors. A shameful standard to say the least. Bernie isn't a has been political figure, he's an underachieving loon that never was.
@QueenCityLib @BernieSanders The idea that Bernie Sanders is somehow the ultimate grand master, and high priest of morality because he was arrested in the presence of Black protestors in the 60's is absolute nonsense.
@QueenCityLib @BernieSanders Show me one piece of meaningful legislation that Senator Sanders has passed that didn't involve the theft of private property of hard working Americans only to re-distribute through government means and I'll recant my statement
@BernieSanders has never passed a serious piece of legislation in his life. Frankly, for the amount of time he has been in public office, that is a (fortunate) disgrace. It's an incredible disservice to the American people that he is an elected official in our wonderful nation
Add water to the Left Wing list of 'Things More Important Then Policy' https://t.co/vg1NcKnMMp
God forbid some men and women in politics care about policy rather than feelings - how dare they?! 		#SafeSpacesFilled
At this point in time, I think a lot of moderate democrats can identify with the GOP more than moderate republicans can identify with the Democrats.		The GOP has its share of idiots, but the lunacy on the left, and their fascist agenda is far more damaging.
RT @charliekirk11: Democrats from North Dakota, West Virginia, Missouri, Montana, and Indiana and total fools for not supporting the tax bi‚Ä¶
I'll never understand for the life of me why anyone supports lethal injection - it's costly to say the least. 		We would be MUCH better off if we reverted back to the practice of using firing squads. It's easier on the tax(theft)payers, &amp; is just as humane as lethal injection
Aaaah, left wing 'tolerance'
The Christmas season will be in full swing within a week - be prepared for the Left to further demonize Christianity and accept all religions other than ours #Tolerance #Acceptance

THIS üòÇ https://t.co/jNPjwmRwex
The left disregards the sins of both Clintons for the sake of victory (well, attempted victory üòâ) and that is INCREDIBLY dangerous, morally horrific territory. Neither party should EVER replace decency for victory - everything about that is despicable.
It's a disgrace how the left doesn't want to talk about how Bill Clinton ruined the structure of black families for generations by pulling thousands of dads from their homes and dooming their children by doing so. Nope, just because he's a Clinton we must act like he is a Saint..
People that believe in 'Safe spaces' and the banning language that they disagree with are FASCISTS, period. 		Yes Leftists, our Gender Studies professors that identify as end tables and gender fluid movie popcorn are 'literally Hitler'.
I hope the few sensible members of the left and the sensible people on the right can remind everyone else that the actions and sins of others are not the fault of Trump. Like him or not, respect the title and grow up. #Republican #Democrat #Libertarian #BenShapiro
@piersmorgan you and @jimmykimmel should host a television show together - you guys would love running around spewing your own verbal idiocies all over the place. Think about how many sensible people could sit back and laugh at your policy prescriptions üòä
@piersmorgan I cannot understand for the life of me why so many Americans like you and want to claim you as ours...you're a left wing hypocrite that belongs in a room with padded walls, not on TV. Your political agenda is outrageous, and the way you go about it is shameful
Left wing idiocy used to come in form of Clintons and social programs...now left wing idiocy comes from hurt feelings, and the Clintons because they have nothing better to do #GOP #LeftWingIdiocy #Democrats #BenShapiro #Libertarian #Republican

Hey @TheDemocrats when are the #NotMySenator tweets going to start in reference to that old pervert from your side of the isle?

The current state of the Left is shameful. #Democrats of all shapes and sizes (and of course gender preferred pronouns, HA) have no right at all to be upset that #Trump is in the White House - it was their showings of idiocy that got him elected!
So @Drake does a VERY good thing to promote safety and decency and is all but crowned King, but a law abiding citizen &amp; legal gun owner prevents further mass slaughter by taking action and is demonized for it?
