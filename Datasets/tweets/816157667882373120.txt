I just voted YES on HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to expand universal background checks and ensure all gun sales &amp; transfers - with a few sensible restrictions - undergoes a background check. No more loopholes. #EndGunViolence
Background checks work. That's why 97% of Americans (including gun owners) support them.		It's crucial to close loopholes that allow prohibited persons, whether convicted felons or domestic abusers, from purchasing a firearm online or at a gun show w/o a background check. https://t.co/ZdCiIBaRfQ
Oil spills don't just damage our environment, they also handicap the fishing industry &amp; tourism economy. We need greater transparency in granting these waivers so the public can be sure that workers and coastlines are adequately protected.

In 2017, transportation emissions accounted for about 28.7% U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Any major infrastructure investment must incentivize local communities and industry to reduce their carbon emissions by creating programs to support innovation &amp; experimentation.
Today's @TransportDems hearing focused on just that: strategies to improve our infrastructure to withstand the effects of climate change and efforts to reduce the transportation sector's carbon emissions.
I served as Chair in today's @TransportDems hearing on how #climatechange impacts transportation...because @RepPeterDefazio's flight was grounded due to heavy snow.

Happy #PresidentsDay! Thankful for visionary leaders who have led our country through the years. https://t.co/7Jdye6dVoI
Climate change is a national emergency.		Gun violence is a national emergency.		There are REAL national emergencies in our country. Immigrants seeking  asylum in our country – when immigration at our southern border has fallen 80%  since 2000 – is not one of them.
I look forward to providing further oversight of this ill-considered decision that impacts our military readiness as a member of @HASCDemocrats.
Fabricating a national emergency to divert $ from critical military construction projects, meant to improve dilapidated housing &amp; crumbling roads on bases, does not befit a Commander in Chief.		@POTUS is neglecting our servicemembers and their families to build his wall.
Presidents have invoked the National Emergencies Act twice, during Operation Desert Shield &amp; after 9/11. They built airfields, runways, medical facilities &amp; barracks – projects necessary to support our armed forces.		A border wall does NOTHING to further our military objectives.
After failing to get Mexico and Congress to pay for his wall, the President is now attempting to exploit our military resources in order to fulfill a campaign promise to his base. This is irresponsible policy that sets a dangerous precedent.

Simply put, these unimaginable tragedies could have been prevented. After the 2014 shooting in Isla Vista, California took swift &amp; bold action to ensure it would never happen again. When it comes to gun safety, every state should have the means to follow CA's lead.
Oftentimes, perpetrators display imminent warning signs before carrying out an attack.		In #Parkland, the shooter's friend contacted law enforcement to warn them of a potential school shooting. Unfortunately, police had no legal means of temporarily removing his firearms.
Sadly, I know the pain gun violence inflicts first-hand. When I was 12, my sister took her own life using a firearm. Then, in 2014 a disturbed gunman in Isla Vista killed 6 people &amp; injured 14 others.		We cannot allow these preventable tragedies to become the new normal.
While many of us celebrate Valentine’s Day with loved ones today, #Parkland survivors are mourning friends and family members that they lost a year ago today, when a disturbed gunman shot and killed 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. https://t.co/SCqdqWuJ6D

Retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on US agriculture and fruit hit close to home on the #CentralCoast. At a time when CA ranchers and farmers are facing a labor shortage &amp; historic drought, @POTUS used American growers as pawns in a trade war.  https://t.co/NxbGvDMSVI
.@POTUS expressed a desire tonight to break through partisan gridlock that all Americans share. Unfortunately, in the same speech, he continued to divide us further. His actions after this TV appearance will speak louder than his words. #SOTU2019
The Central Coast's thriving agricultural industry relies on a steady, legal immigrant workforce. Many local farmers and growers have told me that one of their top concerns is the costly ongoing labor shortage, which is exacerbated by the President’s immigration policies. #SOTU

We cannot govern under continuous threat of a government shutdown. Instead of using fear-mongering &amp; falsehoods to achieve his political goals, I encourage @POTUS to work with @HouseDemocrats toward smart, bipartisan solutions that meet our border security needs. #SOTU2019
The President should not be attempting to undermine the Special Counsel's investigation during the #SOTU. Mueller's investigation must be allowed to continue without obstruction.
When he talks about rolling back “burdensome” regulations, @POTUS is really talking about undermining the environmental protections that ensure we have clean air to breath and clean water to drink. #SOTU2019
The Trump Administration has undermined Americans’ access to affordable health care at every turn. 		Instead of defending the Affordable Care Act, he’s urging federal courts to strike down it’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions as unconstitutional. #SOTU2019
.@POTUS tells us "we have launched an unprecedented economic boom"		Meanwhile, he ignores the fact that he shut down the government over a senseless campaign promise. That temper tantrum cost our economy $3 billion in permanent losses. #SOTU2019
.@POTUS took credit for declining unemployment rates, but what he failed to address was the fact that more and more Americans are taking two or three jobs to pay the bills. 		It’s time we focus on policies that help the middle class, not tax benefits for the wealthiest 1%. #SOTU
To really help America's workers @POTUS can		✔️ Support the Raise the Wage Act so every American has a living wage.	✔️ Reform our tax code to benefit the middle-class, not the wealthiest 1%.	✔️ Not hold federal employees’ paychecks hostage to secure a campaign promise.		#SOTU2019

I urge the President to reopen the government immediately so we can continue negotiating border security funding, without denying hard-working federal employees their paychecks.
The latest proposal includes changes to the legal asylum system that would only exacerbate the chaos at the border, keeps his senseless demand for a $5.7 billion border wall &amp; provides only temporary protection for only a fraction of our nation’s #Dreamers.

Nearly 420,000 federal employees – including law enforcement, TSA screeners, Forest Service firefighters &amp; others – are forced to go without pay during the holidays as a result of the #TrumpShutdown. Furloughed federal employees may never receive back-pay after the shutdown ends.
I voted against wasteful spending for the wall and remain hopeful that Congress and the President can work together on a bipartisan basis to bring forward a clean spending bill to fund the government responsibly before tonight’s shutdown.
The President’s senseless border wall is nothing more than an archaic solution to a 21st century problem and fails to meet our security needs at the border.
The Senate passed a bipartisan spending bill, following an agreement w/ @POTUS, which funded the government through Feb. Instead of bringing that clean bill to a vote, House GOP conspired w/ Trump to add funding for a border wall, leading us toward a partial government shutdown.

I’m a cosponsor of the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, a *bipartisan* fix that would effectively tackle the national retirement crisis without driving up our national deficit.
Studies have shown that plans like their ill-conceived “Universal Savings Account” don’t work, and can even put retirees in debt. USAs alone would balloon our deficit by $8.6 billion. https://t.co/VyTo1Q5YvK
Yesterday, the House passed the so-called “Family Savings Act,” an ill-conceived tax cut that does nothing to improve our retirement savings crisis, drains federal revenues, and increases our debt by $21 billion. The GOP is literally passing the buck onto the next generation.
The House GOP just passed another corporate tax cut that balloons our deficit at the expense of working-class Americans. https://t.co/5K1a9iHryR
The Senate should not hold a vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh until we have all the facts. I have written to my colleagues on the Senate urging them to delay the vote until an FBI investigation can be conducted.

We need to be investing in the next generation of #CentralCoast farmers, not putting their livelihoods at risk with tariffs &amp; an escalating trade war.		Proud to cosponsor the bipartisan VET-2-FARM Act, which creates new job opportunities in the Agriculture industry for veterans.
The Trump Administration's attempt to transition from family separation to family detention is not a solution. 	 	I joined @HispanicCaucus this week to question @SecNielsen about any plans the Administration has to use military bases to house detained children and families. https://t.co/ZqHD201t9o

With understaffed VA clinics &amp; a growing need for firefighters, the #CentralCoast knows the importance of recruiting new federal employees.		A proposal to bring San Luis Obispo into the LA-Long Beach pay area does just that &amp; impacts nearly 100 federal employees in our community.
I voted to defeat the anti-public land amendments to HR 6147, which would have decreased funding for land and water conservation &amp; opened national monuments to mining and drilling.

A corporation’s goal is to make a profit, not to improve the quality of life for all Americans. I’m fighting to make sure multinational corporations don’t have a say in our elections without their shareholders &amp; the public knowing about it.

Just voted present on #Resolution990, because instead of working to immediately reunite children separated from families, or pass legislation to ensure this shameful policy is never repeated, Republicans are wasting our time by playing political games w/ a non-binding resolution.

I joined high school students from Parkland and elsewhere who shared personal stories of gun violence with my colleagues &amp; I on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Too many lives have been affected by the uniquely American gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/b3YmwkW2aR
Today is the four-year anniversary of the shooting in #IslaVista, when a young man with a gun took the lives of six UCSB students &amp; injured 14 others.		We know that moments of silence are not enough. We must honor the victims with action. #NotOneMore. https://t.co/HjhiqzkS1W
I’m celebrating National Foster Youth Month by making sure #FosterYouthVoices from across the nation are heard. Thank you, Sarah, for shadowing me today and sharing your experiences and insights into our child welfare system. #FosterYouthShadowDay https://t.co/xPhcfstmpC
The #MeToo movement proves that the ability to band together in the face of discrimination is crucial. Yesterday's ruling is disappointing, but the fight for workers’ rights is far from over. Now, Congress must pass legislation protecting workers' ability to challenge misconduct. https://t.co/mcqXvqLt7q
I stood up today to honor the victims of the #IslaVista shooting at UCSB in 2014.	 	Since Sandy Hook, we've had 46 moments of silence, but still no votes on gun violence prevention measures.	 	It's time to honor these victims with action, not more silence. #EnoughIsEnough https://t.co/jSbQb5hT3Y
Last week, we celebrated the 6th annual #InfrastructureWeek, a time to come together to recognize infrastructure as a critical issue facing our economy and security.  Read about the steps I’ve taken to help bring our infrastructure into the 21st century: https://t.co/TSSdAl1s3E
Send a picture that highlights local servicemembers, or a short video giving your thanks to our troops &amp; veterans, to ThankTheTroops.Carbajal@mail.house.gov and I’ll feature your messages on my social media. Let’s give our service members the thank you they deserve!
Today is #ArmedForcesDay, when we give our thanks to the brave men and women who have stepped up to protect our nation. This month, I’m inviting residents of the Central Coast to join me in showing our appreciation. https://t.co/iIqlkau238
I urge my Republican colleagues to come back to the table, so that we can craft a truly bipartisan #FarmBill that gives our local farmers greater certainty while maintaining important safety net programs for working families. 	https://t.co/tNvhw3GrQH
The traditionally bipartisan #FarmBill has always balanced the priorities of our farmers w/ support for essential food &amp; nutrition programs. Sadly, this year’s bill shirked bipartisanship by drastically cutting the SNAP program, which serves thousands of Central Coast families.
After the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the Well Control Rule was enacted as a critical safety measure meant to save lives and protect our coasts. 		Make your voice heard! Submit a comment to @Interior and help protect offshore drilling safety rules. → https://t.co/n0hunkJRfm https://t.co/J0bHcecFOc
The #TitleX program has helped countless women on the Central Coast gain access to quality reproductive healthcare. 		The Administration’s domestic gag rule undermines women’s ability to make their own healthcare decisions &amp; cuts off critical preventative healthcare for millions. https://t.co/rFE7SiK2eQ
The Administration’s drug pricing plan falls far short of its promise to Central Coast families struggling to afford the costs of living-saving medications.		I visited pharmacists in Santa Barbara to hear about how we can better help them care for Central Coast residents. https://t.co/lNPpl4ct4K
Heartbroken for #SantaFe High School students &amp; families after this morning's tragic shooting.		This sadly feels all too familiar. Congress has failed our children by refusing to address this epidemic. They shouldn't live in fear of being shot in their classrooms. #EnoughIsEnough
When I visited a Head Start class in San Luis Obispo, I saw firsthand the pivotal role this program plays in making sure our children have a comprehensive childhood education. Today marks 53 years since the program began. Happy birthday, #HeadStart! https://t.co/EHM0oisQqe
I met with local and regional farmers yesterday to discuss their priorities in Congress, including this year’s #FarmBill. Always great to hear from California’s growers about how we can better support our nation’s agricultural sector. https://t.co/CmYbGgjJ4B

Our country is diverse, full of people from different ages, races, nationalities, abilities, sexual orientations &amp; gender identities. There are too many powerful voices to be hindered and lost to discrimination #IDAHOTB https://t.co/6HJQOFn8ug
Over 23,000 households in #CA24 benefit from the SNAP program. The #FarmBill has become unnecessarily partisan and I will continue working to protect SNAP so our families have access to good nutrition. #HandsOffSNAP https://t.co/xQOZIbP2tY
Clean air standards in CA have reduced carbon emissions &amp; saved endangered blue whales in the Santa Barbara Channel. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of the Blue Whales and Blue Skies Act, to continue this progress that protects our coast &amp; our marine wildlife. https://t.co/fCTtxi4LOV

After a gunman took the life of a police officer, Indiana passed legislation that gives law enforcement a tool to get firearms out of the hands of individuals in crisis. 		The #GVROAct that I introduced last year will help states like Michigan follow California &amp; Indiana's lead.
Since #CitizensUnited, corporations have taken advantage of current reporting requirements as loopholes to obscure their influence on political campaigns. 		The Corporate Political Disclosure Act would require these contributions be publicly available. 👇	https://t.co/5v6ZQvgHT3

I lost my older sister to suicide w/ a firearm at a young age. What I’ve learned since, is that temporarily preventing people from having a gun while in a state of crisis saves lives. #GunReformNow
While the troubling details of the shooting in Florida are still emerging, it is clear this horrific act of violence was perpetrated by an individual in crisis. That’s why @RepEsty, @RepBeyer, and I are working hard to pass a #GVRO bill in Congress. #GunReformNow
I agree, it's heartbreaking that signs this individual meant to inflict harm on his community were not addressed.

Cuts to infrastructure funding hits CA especially hard but @POTUS's budget eliminates TIGER grant funding. Releasing an infrastructure plan to fix our “crumbling infrastructure” with a budget that makes funding development more difficult fails to meet the needs of Californians. https://t.co/zvPt2PQ8wO
This past October, I wrote to @USDOT to support Santa Barbara &amp; San Luis Obispo’s bids for TIGER grants to improve our transportation infrastructure, including improvements to Highways 101 &amp; 46, which facilitates both the tourism and agriculture sectors on the Central Coast.

Over 40 million Californians face food insecurity and the disasters in our district make this problem even more difficult to overcome. Instead of funding programs that help put fresh and healthy food on the table, the #TrumpBudget moves us backwards by targeting the SNAP program.
The food box delivery program @POTUS proposes is far from a “Blue Apron type program” – it is a gigantic leap backwards &amp; robs Americans of being able to make choices for their own families. https://t.co/6AKdow605x
Instead of putting working families first, the #TrumpBudget guts Medicaid &amp; Social Security. @POTUS's plan slashes funding for SNAP, but provides $18bil in funding for a border wall, reflecting this Administration’s misguided priorities. https://t.co/M0o3i7cbbh
Five yrs ago, we saw how dangerous silencers can be when four people, including police officers, lost their lives in a 10-day shooting spree. The #SHAREAct, which allows individuals w/ history of violent crime to buy silencers, is a large step backward in preventing gun violence.
$200bil to rebuild our infrastructure falls dramatically short of the $1.5 trillion he promised and places the burden on already cash-strapped local governments while gutting the environmental protections that keeps the Central Coast’s environment healthy and safe in the process.
The President’s #infrastructure plan calls for “streamlining” the permit review process despite a @USTreasury report finding that the main factor that slowed down 39 out of 40 projects was a lack of federal funding, not environmental reviews and the permitting process.

My thoughts on #SOTU2018: https://t.co/nxj5ybncnY
#SOTU is the time to address our nation w/ a vision but @POTUS gave only rhetoric &amp; failed to outline any substantive policy proposals. Our nation is stronger when we work together &amp; at the end of the day, I still firmly believe that there is more that unites us than divides us.
The #SOTU had no mention of…	✖️Sexual assault or the #MeToo movement.	✖️The urgent need for action on climate change.	✖️Combating the gun violence epidemic that takes 96 lives/day on average.
Tonight, @POTUS failed to offer a clear path forward for #Dreamers. I proudly joined DACA recipients ahead of tonight’s speech to thank them for standing up for the Dreamers across the country fighting to continue living, working, &amp; learning in the only country they know. #SOTU https://t.co/JmPkvyYtzJ
The White Houses’ plan funds an ineffective border wall &amp; cuts legal immigration by 50%. Democrats and Republicans alike want fair, effective immigration laws. Congress needs to act now to pass bipartisan legislation like the #DreamAct and #USAAct. #SOTU
Like so many of the #Dreamers in the audience today, immigrants embody the values that make the American dream a reality. We owe it to all of them to find lasting reform that does them justice. #SOTU
Truly supporting our veterans means funding the programs they rely on. Action is legislation that ensures veterans can receive the benefits they need: https://t.co/wq50ggbpWi #SOTU
When talking about eliminating regulations, @POTUS is talking about undermining environmental protections. Central Coast families know how important those regulations are - we need to ensures clean air and water, not polluted skies. #SOTU

We need to work together to find true compromise to keep these hardworking young people in the only country they've ever known, while also reasonably stepping up immigration enforcement at our border. Not waste billions of dollars on an ineffective border.
The White House's immigration framework is once again not a serious attempt to reach an agreement on #DACA. After ending the DACA program for 800,00 young Dreamers, this plan uses them as a bargaining chip to drastically cut legal, family-based immigration.

Recovery crews have rescued over 50 people, I am especially grateful for our first-responders still at the scene and their remarkable cooperation to protect and save lives. Residents are advised to stay off the roads to maintain accessibility for recovery personnel.
My heart breaks for our neighbors in Montecito. I will be returning home to be with our community as #CAStorm recovery continues. Rebuilding after two unprecedented tragedies will not be easy, but I have absolute faith that our community’s spirit of service will carry us through.
More severe weather, possible flash flooding, &amp; debris flows for the #ThomasFire burn areas around Montecito, Summerland and Carpinteria is predicted over the next several hours. If you are in affected areas, leave now and go to high ground. Get alerts at https://t.co/K6JmSIQY2S https://t.co/ZezClfNi4n

Bottom line: Trump's new HHS rule on birth control is a dangerous attack on women's access to affordable healthcare.
Now, many will have to pay full cost for contraception if employer, health plan, or school decides they don’t want to cover. #HandsOffMyBC

This decision reinforces the critical role of the judiciary in maintaining checks and balances of power. https://t.co/sveZYwaFss
9th Circuit ruling, denying the reinstatement of @POTUS' unconstitutional ban, is a victory for American values &amp; for our national security.

The reprehensible #MuslimBan, targeting immigrants &amp; refugees b/c of religion isn't just immoral, but also undermines our national security.
