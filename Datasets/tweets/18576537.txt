Tell us again how these are only "civilian protests" with a "political aim" and aren‚Äôt "military action". We're sure that when you interview these "rioters", they'll also claim to only be "teachers" or "sport players",  or "socializing", as alleged in your "report". https://t.co/6O4o72kCcL
Terror orgs in Gaza take pride in their terrorist activity. This ‚Äúpromo‚Äù video released last week by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad highlights rockets, tunnels, mortars, &amp; attacks on IDF soldiers defending the border. They link border violence with terror. So should you. https://t.co/hgKIY2UWYe
.@UNGeneva, turn up your sound for a bit and listen. This is what Israelis heard on Friday night as Gazan rioters blew holes in the fence with the aim of breaching the border and reaching the homes of the families living in the communities nearby. https://t.co/IVt5mLbqJn
This is a video of Gazan rioters throwing an explosive at an IDF jeep. @UNGeneva, is this what you meant when you said that these riots posed no threat? https://t.co/HXfHcc6gkx
Good afternoon @UNGeneva, @UN_HRC, @SantiagoACanton. We hope you had a nice weekend. If you had spent it here in Israel, it would have looked like this: https://t.co/wx6knfXYXw
The IDF is grateful for this exercise and stands ready to protect Israel‚Äôs airspace and civilians against a variety of threats from near and far. This is a defensive deployment that is not related to any specific current event. https://t.co/Tv5biMVZXj

The @UN says these ‚Äúdemonstrations‚Äù aim to make a political point. How often does political activity involve breaking through a border with knives while shouting death threats?		https://t.co/T9Uwp9Z2Bf https://t.co/S9pDRNQtVY
While orchestrating the riots on Israel's border, Hamas was also responsible for firing over 1,300 rockets and mortars from Gaza into Israel during 2018. The number of times that this was mentioned in the @UN_HRC report? Zero.	https://t.co/T9Uwp9Z2Bf https://t.co/laszv8ys7l
The only @UN_HRC recommendation for Hamas was to stop "the use of incendiary kites and balloons." How about also recommending that Hamas stops inciting Gazans to breach Israel‚Äôs border to kill Jews?		Just a ‚Äúrecommendation.‚Äù https://t.co/SNdvirudm2
In the Commission's view, the ‚Äúdemonstrations‚Äù were ‚Äúcivilian in nature.‚Äù Yet Hamas leaders themselves contradicted them...while speaking AT the riots:		https://t.co/T9Uwp9Z2Bf https://t.co/93pdv9cuzz

"The IDF is a professional fighting force,	led by its commanders,	ready for every mission,	which operates according to the law,	the decisions of the Israeli Government	and in the spirit of the values of the Jewish people."
"The IDF is the military of the people, 	for the protection of the people, 	which respects its soldiers from all [its nation‚Äôs] people,	draws its strength from the people,	and embodies the best of the people."
"We must focus on enhancing our ability to strike the enemy, and positioning a powerful, efficient, and innovative military which preserves its purpose and uniqueness."
"Now, in my turn, since I have accepted the responsibility to lead the military, I vow to devote all my efforts, in a critical and demanding way, to strengthen our defensive shield, and to suit it to the challenges of the present and the future."
"Each and every soldier is a precious asset that we have received to safeguard, and the care for those who serve is a decree. So too is the memory of our fallen, the strengthening of the bereaved families and the wounded, and our commitment to bringing home the missing."
"I shoulder the responsibilities with awe, and see my role as a privilege granted to me with the help of many that are deserving of thanks. To my parents who established within me my first compass, the moral compass."
"The national home that was founded here is an unmatched marvel in the history of the nations....In order to protect this home, a clear vision is needed, an able military force, the willingness to use it, judgment and determination; in this spirit we shall act."

Through exceptional cooperation with the IDF Intelligence Directorate, we prevented the establishment of Iranian military capabilities in Syria.
Over the past year, which is coming to a close, the Israeli Air Force operated in a number of theatres, on a large scale. Our planes have defended and attacked, and Israeli pilots have demonstrated great courage.

We have worked together day by day to reach our strategic goals, and have achieved accomplishments of high importance. These accomplishments have thwarted the attempts of Iranian armament and entrenchment [in Syria], &amp; prevented Hezbollah‚Äôs attack tunnel capability [in Lebanon].
In the past years, the IDF has been operating outside of public view. The campaign between wars continues. It starts with the collection of thorough intelligence and fruitful cooperation, and ends with fulfilling its mission with precision and success.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the IDF‚Äôs prime obligation to return the bodies of the soldiers held [by Hamas] in the Gaza Strip and to return the two civilians who crossed on their own accord."
"Every year over 3,000 potential terrorists are arrested and hundreds of terror attacks are thwarted. This is viewed as an intelligence success that saves Israeli lives.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe also acted successfully against the precision capabilities that the organization [Hezbollah] tried to achieve and against their attempts to establish themselves on the Golan Heights front."
"It‚Äôs not hard to imagine what would have happened if hundreds of Hezbollah operatives had entered [Israel from Lebanon] through underground attack tunnels. We detected and prepared for this threat in secret.‚Äù
"The Russian presence in Syria created a new situation and was an influential factor in the way we operated. The way we prepared allowed us to operate for the sake of Israel's security interests."
On the withdrawal of American forces from Syria: ‚ÄúThis is a significant event, but it should not be overstated. For decades we dealt with [Syria] alone. The IDF operated independently throughout this period, including over the last few years with US and Russian forces present.‚Äù

For months, Gazans have been launching arson balloons at Israel, burning more than 8K acres of Israeli land, killing 100s of animals, &amp; endangering 1000s of people. Moments ago, terrorists launched arson balloons from Gaza into Israel. The Israeli Air Force fired towards them.
The IDF will continue to operate in accordance with the directives of the Israeli Government against Iran‚Äôs incessant attempts to establish itself in Syria and to arm the terrorist organization Hezbollah with lethal and accurate weapons.
The IDF will continue to take all necessary measures, as it has been doing until this very day, to achieve this goal.
The safety and well-being of the Russian troops who operate in Syria are a focal component in every approval of any activity by senior officials in the IDF and in Israel.
In addition, as we saw during this incident, the use of advanced weapons by irresponsible entities significantly endangers the area and can severely harm forces operating in the region.
The continuation of the coordination is a shared interest in light of the various regional challenges.
The result of the downing of the Russian plane by Syrian fire is severe and tragic and we convey our condolences to the bereaved families and the Russian People. The coordination between the IDF and the Russian military has proven its value numerous times over the last years.
The deconfliction mechanism operated in the relevant timeframe (as it has been operating over the last two and a half years); the IAF did not hide behind any aircraft and that the Israeli aircraft were in Israeli airspace at the time of the downing of the Russian plane.
The AAR was conducted and presented in a thorough, detailed and professional manner. The comprehensive, accurate and factual details are known to the relevant professionals in the Russian military, and they clearly state that:
An IDF delegation, led by the Commander of the Israeli Air Force, Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, presented the complete IDF After Action Review (AAR) of the downing of the Russian plane by Syrian anti-air fire to senior Russian military officers.

The Israeli delegation continues its meetings and will return to Israel tomorrow morning, as planned.
The meetings were held in good spirits and the representatives shared a professional, open and transparent discussion on various issues. Both sides emphasized the importance of the states' interests and the continued implementation of the deconfliction system.
In addition, the IDF presented the ongoing Iranian attempts to establish its military presence in Syria and to transfer strategic weapons to the Hezbollah terror organization.
The Israeli officers presented the situation report regarding the downing of the Russian plane by Syrian anti-aircraft fire on Monday night, as well as the pre-mission information and the findings of the IDF's inquiry of the event.
The meetings were conducted following the agreement between the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu and the Russian President, Mr. Vladimir Putin.
The IDF delegation to Moscow, led by the Commander of the IAF, Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, has held several meetings with the Commander of the Russian Air Force, senior commanders of the Russian army and other officials of the Russian Air Force. https://t.co/z9V9RVK7Bd
The Commander of the IAF will be joined by the Head of the International Cooperation Unit, Brig. Gen. Erez Maisel, as well as additional officers of the Intelligence Directorate, the IAF and the Operations Directorate.
In addition, they will present the continuous Iranian attempts to transfer strategic weapons to the Hezbollah terror organization and to establish an Iranian military presence in Syria.
The Commander of the IAF and the delegation will present the situation report of the event regarding all aspects, including the pre-mission information and the findings of the IDF inquiry regarding the event.
Tomorrow morning, an IDF delegation led by the Commander of the IAF, Maj. Gen. Amikam Norkin, will depart to Moscow following the downing of the Russian plane by Syrian anti-aircraft fire on Monday night.
Israel will share all the relevant information with the Russian Government to review the incident and to confirm the facts in this inquiry.
4. The Syrian anti-air batteries fired indiscriminately and from what we understand, did not bother to ensure that no Russian planes were in the air.
2. When the Syrian Army launched the missiles that hit the Russian plane, IAF jets were already within Israeli airspace.	3. During the strike against the target in Latakia, the Russian plane that was then hit was not within the area of the operation.
An initial inquiry of the incident suggests:	1. Extensive and inaccurate Syrian anti-aircraft (Surface to Air missile) fire caused the Russian plane to be hit and downed.
The IDF and the Russian army have a deconfliction system, which was agreed upon by the states' leaders, and has proven itself many times over recent years. This system was in use tonight as well.
These weapons were meant to attack Israel, and posed an intolerable threat against it.
Overnight, IDF fighter jets targeted a facility of the Syrian Armed Forces from which systems to manufacture accurate and lethal weapons were about to be transferred on behalf of Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Israel also holds Iran and the Hezbollah terror organization accountable for this unfortunate incident.
Israel expresses sorrow for the death of the aircrew members of the Russian plane that was downed tonight due to Syrian anti-aircraft fire.	Israel holds the Assad regime, whose military shot down the Russian plane, fully responsible for this incident.

We would like to reiterate that the area of the Israel-Gaza security fence is an unsafe area. Those who riot in this area, are throwing bombs, grenades or trying to invade Israel; or are standing beside those who are doing so, and are putting their lives at risk.
Reports regarding the death of two Palestinians who participated in the riots yesterday have been brought to our attention. The incidents in question may also be reviewed by the General Staff Fact-Finding Assessment Mechanism.
During the riots along the security fence in the Gaza Strip yesterday, IDF soldiers faced a large, violent crowd of Gazans who went on the attack for hours on end, hurling bombs and grenades. We responded with riot dispersal means and standard operating procedures.
Moments ago, four Palestinians, armed with a knife and an ax, attempted to break through the security fence from Gaza into Israel, less than a mile away from Israeli families. We stopped them. https://t.co/Dfq8la6jv1

Many regional and international occurrences allow Israel to significantly influence the current situation. Today, a precise and determined operation, based on knowledge and insight, can create a strategic environment, better than it has been for Israel in years."
In an era of changing threats, the explosion of information and the increasing difficulty of distinguishing between facts &amp; fiction, it‚Äôs impossible to imagine a day in the life of the State of Israel without the information &amp; insight that military intelligence provides.
The equation is simple - human excellence and advanced technology ensure superiority of information and knowledge. These capabilities are already life-saving, and will add a crucial layer to the State of Israel's national security strategy in the future.
We provide high-level intelligence and operational capabilities, allowing the IDF to carry out precise missions, eliminating enemy capabilities, deterring them, and eliminating their desire for future confrontations.
The Head of the Intelligence Directorate, Maj. Gen. Tamir Hyman, on the 70th anniversary of the Intelligence Directorate: "Even now, behind the apparent quiet, the IDF is carrying out ‚Äòthe campaign between wars‚Äô with force and precision.

‚ÄúSoldiers &amp; commanders; the many challenges that the Southern Command faced recently- starting with terror under the guise of civilian protests, to rocket launch attempts towards the communities next to the Gaza Strip, have shown us time after time that we have a responsibility"
‚ÄúThe building of the structural barrier around the Gaza Strip will provide better security, in addition to strengthening security and relations along the peaceful border with our Egyptian counterparts‚Äù
‚ÄúEyal, today, three years of your command comes to an end. The Southern Command‚Äôs handling of the terror tunnels into Israeli territory is an example of precise, extensive planning and creative and determined execution that brings unprecedented achievements‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile Hamas chooses to invest resources in attempts to infiltrate Israel and encourages terror attacks under the guise of riots, the commanders of the IDF and their soldiers stand as a defensive shield‚Äù
"In response, it's worked hard to protect the southern population-acting vigorously to thwart terror attempts &amp; provide a sense of security for the southern residents of Israel‚Äù
Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot: ‚ÄúOver the last 2 weeks, the Southern Command has been confronted with a wide range of terrorist attacks"
"In response, it's worked hard to protect the southern population-acting vigorously to thwart terror attempts &amp; provide a sense of security for the southern residents of Israel‚Äù
"We‚Äôve stopped the terror attempts and put up a defensive shield in order to thwart infiltration into Israel. We will continue with our readiness as much as necessary‚Äù
‚ÄúIn the last few weeks, we‚Äôve experienced terrorism under the guise of mass riots along the Gaza Strip led by the terror organization, Hamas. The IDF, along with the security forces, have prepared for this"
‚ÄúWe must come to conclusions &amp; provide an optimal response against any threat- small &amp; big. This is our mission &amp; duty &amp; when a response doesn‚Äôt exist, we‚Äôre followed by a sense of failure and a will to improve. It‚Äôs our responsibility to solve the arson kite problem‚Äù
"The threat and challenge still exist and we have to continue working to improve our efforts‚Äù
‚ÄúThis was an operation where we located, neutralized, and severely harmed Hamas‚Äôs terror tunnel project. Technology and special sensors were developed to identify empty spaces underground and integrated cooperation between technology, engineering, intelligence"
‚ÄúWith great effort, directed by the General Staff, and with cooperation of the General Staff and between all the units of the IDF, we embarked on a mission that many doubted our capabilities of executing‚Äù
"The work doesn‚Äôt stop and requires constant and steady readiness‚Äù
‚ÄúAbout 3 years ago, I began my position as GOC of the Southern Command with a great sense of responsibility and honor. The aim is very simple: protecting the southern borders and the citizens but the mission is complicated.
Eyal Zamir: ‚ÄúThe days prefacing and following the 6 Day War were tense and traumatic, full of preparation and ended with a great victory. This, thanks to the great capability, faith, and combat spirit of the IDF, is the essence of the story of the Southern Command‚Äù
Today Maj. Gen. Eyal Zamir completes his term as GOC of the Southern Command and passes the torch to Maj. Gen. Herzi Halevi. A ceremony will begin soon where Chief of the General Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot and both the former and new GOC of the Southern Command will all speak
Just as harvesting season began, Hamas torched Israeli land with arson kites https://t.co/WvqZfHu4YP
In response, the soldier who was hit by the rock fired towards the suspect, who was injured &amp; given medical treatment at the scene. Despite this, the suspect died. No IDF troops were injured. The incident is being examined
One of the Palestinians flanked the troops and hurled the rock, striking a soldier's head
The rock was hurled during a riot, which more than 10 Palestinians instigated. IDF troops responded with riot dispersal means
About an hour ago, a Palestinian hurled a large rock at IDF troops during an arrest in Nabi Saleh, northwest of Ramallah
Iran is behind every move Hamas makes https://t.co/jIRxZsseW0
The examination is ongoing. In addition, the incident will be examined by the General Staff Fact Finding Assessment Mechanism, and the findings passed to the Military Advocate General
During an initial examination of the incident that took place on June 1st, 2018, in which a 22-year-old Palestinian woman was killed, it was found that a small number of bullets were fired during the incident, and that no shots were deliberately or directly aimed towards her
The true face of Iran. The true face of Hamas. The true face of the ‚ÄúGreat March of Return." https://t.co/QTzoMPvH73

Hamas is solely responsible for all events that transpire in the Gaza Strip and emanate from it. If Hamas continues relying on terror instead of solving the issues that plague Gazan civilians, it'll continue paying a heavy price that'll increase as necessary
The IDF views these ongoing attempts with great severity and is determined to fulfill its mission to protect and ensure the safety of Israeli civilians as needed
The weekend's events are a continuation of Hamas's repeated attempts to turn the area next to the security fence into a violent zone both above &amp; below ground, conduct terror attacks, damage security infrastructure, and endanger lives of Israeli civilians &amp; IDF soldiers
These terror activities included planting a grenade, hurling explosive devices, attempts to cross the security fence, damaging security infrastructure, and igniting fires in Israeli territory with the use of arson kites and balloons
The strikes were conducted in response to the rockets that were fired and to the various terror activities orchestrated by the Hamas terror organization over the weekend
Moments ago, IAF fighter jets targeted 10 terror sites in three military compounds belonging to the Hamas terror organization in the Gaza Strip. Among the targets were two Hamas munition manufacturing and storage sites &amp; a military compound

Iran and Hamas abuse Gazans by funding terror instead of investing in their quality of life https://t.co/3Pr5ILCtfO
However, these sacks were not originally cement sacks. With that being said, the cement found in these terror tunnels could have been used for improving the lives of Gazan civilians.
In the message released earlier today, a mistake was made- the sacks with ‚ÄúUNRWA‚Äù written on them that were found in the terror tunnel were used to reinforce the tunnel's infrastructure.
The Hamas terror organization exploits the humanitarian aid designated for Gaza in order to build terror infrastructure.
The strike affected the naval forces‚Äô ability to operate in the Gaza Strip and makes it difficult for the terror organization to conduct maritime operations as well
These compounds were used by Hamas &amp; Palestinian Islamic Jihad naval forces for advanced weaponry training and also offered those terrorist forces staging grounds from which they could carry out terror attacks against Israel
Hamas' naval forces were also significantly degraded &amp; a large part of its posts &amp; special weapons production facilities were destroyed. In addition, the vast majority of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's (PIJ) naval compounds were destroyed
The IDF strike damaged the terror organization‚Äôs stockpile of weapons and affected the financial investment required to develop weapons in the future. Striking these terror sites was a significant blow to Hamas' military buildup capabilities
These are some of the terror targets that the IDF struck on Tuesday, including weapons manufacturing sites used by the Hamas terror organization for self-production https://t.co/i3bTp3kQu0

The IDF will continue to enforce the naval blockade and defend the maritime borders of Israel and its civilians
The naval blockade is a necessary and legal security measure that's been repeatedly recognized by the world and the UN as important to the security of the State of Israel and its maritime borders that protect Israeli civilians in the face of terror
This will only harm the residents of the Gaza Strip and the aid that is being transferred into the Gaza Strip by Israel and other countries

Two things are certain: The stability of Israel and the instability of the region. #HC17
Israel has the solutions to many of the problems in the Middle East; in agriculture, water, energy, medicine, high tech, and security. #HC17
In case of confrontation, I recommend that anyone that lives near Hezbollah‚Äôs or Hamas‚Äôs operational facilities evacuate immediately. #HC17
Hamas needs to choose between getting stronger or improving the situation in Gaza. The population needs to tell them what they want. #HC17
I propose that the UN conduct an evaluation of resolution 1701. Don‚Äôt worry, Hezbollah won‚Äôt allow any evaluation.
If Hezbollah and Hamas knew how much we know about their activities they would do everything possible to avoid confrontation.
Lebanon can prosper but Hezbollah can drag them down again. Lebanon needs to make a choice and the world needs to help them do it. #HC17
The Middle East makes up 5% of world‚Äôs population but 30% of the world‚Äôs victims of terror. #HC17
Iran is the primary sponsor of terror in the region. ~50% of Hamas budget, ~75% of Hezbollah‚Äôs, and ~73% of Islamic Jihad‚Äôs. #HC17
Israel transferred 7 million + tons of building material to Gaza since 2014. That‚Äôs enough to have built the Burj Khalifa 14 times. https://t.co/yqOaubgyFI
