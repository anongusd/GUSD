“I’m proud that the Fifth District has already clawed back $290 per household from the federal government, a 16 percent improvement over recent years.”
"We know that every dollar for Head Start returns $7 to $9....By clawing back more of the tax dollars that we have already sent to Washington, we can save locally to boost affordability and the quality of life for New Jersey families and businesses.
Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-5) announced the grant, calling it a win for our children, our families and for our community’s return on investment from the federal government. "		“Head Start invests in our children early to set them up for success."		https://t.co/Qk8vfe2J8s
“For months now, I've been proud to work with local Mayors across the region to demand better and faster service from Service Electric. I’m confident that SE heard our concerns loudly and clearly...and will come away committed to working with us to address them.”
"From small businesses to our schools, making sure that North Jersey has access to affordable high-speed broadband Internet is critical to competing in today’s global economy”
“Residents throughout Sussex and Warren counties know how critical fast and reliable internet is for our families, our businesses, and our communities."	https://t.co/4jy6UeKDqP

I'm proud to be the most bipartisan freshman Democrat in the House and I'll always stand up for lower taxes and our Jersey Values.
We've seen how extreme partisanship leads to gridlock and dysfunction. Instead, we need more people in Congress who share our commitment to working together to find common ground ground, so that we can actually solve problems and overcome our toughest challenges.
I've long believed that governing from the sensible center is the best way to get things done that are good for the Fifth District and New Jersey. 		https://t.co/Eeu9bHBPUD
"Without any congressional authorization whatsoever, the US Treasury Department just jacked up taxes today on millions of Americans," said Gottheimer (NJ-5th)."We will fight these shameless rules and will continue to fight for lower taxes for NJ families."	https://t.co/reh7u9e6QT
Additionally, no one should be making a woman’s healthcare decision except her and her doctor. In Congress, I will keep driving us towards equal rights and economic parity for women in our country. Thank you. (5/5)
Women deserve equal pay for equal work. Period. Last year, I proudly co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure that women receive equal pay for equal work. Congress must continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that women are getting the pay they deserve. (4/5)
But we know that American women still face enormous obstacles to true equality. (3/5)
We live in a time where three women currently sit on the Supreme Court, women hold twenty percent of all congressional seats, and scores sit in America’s boardrooms. The sky should be the limit for all of our daughters.  (2/5)
Today we celebrate #WomensEqualityDay, commemorating the 98th anniversary of the adoption of the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote. I’d like to take this moment to recognize how far we’ve come as a nation and where we still need to go. (1/5)
"What we don't spend enough time doing, in my opinion, is thanking seniors and acknowledging all they do in the community," Gottheimer said. "So many seniors are involved, making our community such a great place."	https://t.co/KCJF0wIVi1

As your Congressman, I'm going to keep fighting for lower taxes, fighting back against the Moocher States and clawing back more federal resources to make our state more affordable and to deliver a better return on investment for our residents. (3/3)
That's also why I helped design a bipartisan plan to restore SALT, utilizing the charitable tax deduction to give families a much-needed tax break. (2/3)
You sent me to Washington to fight for lower taxes and that's exactly what I'm doing. That's why I fought against the Tax Hike Bill that slammed our state and gutted the State and Local Tax Deduction. (1/3)	https://t.co/vxUUVEFALo

"A federal law more than two decades old is leading to a doctor shortage in NJ's hospitals. Now, Jersey's lawmakers in Washington are looking to overturn it...Six NJ House members, led by Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-5th Dist., have introduced legislation." https://t.co/TtaykF4BJF

I have heard from many residents in Bergen, Passaic, Sussex and Warren Counties who shared with me their frustration about the response from the utilities, not just about the lack of power, but the utilities’ lackluster communication. 	https://t.co/qhm35BQwfq
NJ can fight back against the Tax Hike Bill by passing this common sense legislation. (2/2)
New Jersey families and businesses need tax relief, especially after the Tax Hike Bill took a two-by-four to our state. My Tax Cut Plan would restore the value of the State and Local Tax Deduction. (1/2) https://t.co/g19iOI9zZt
But with many residents now without power for a whole week, the utility companies have to do much better. Not only getting people back on line as soon as possible, but there must be a real plan in place to prevent this from happening again when the next storm hits our area.
I can't commend enough the incredible work of the mayors, emergency responders and local officials who are on the ground in our communities.	https://t.co/hJp4Clp3bF
However, the response from the utility companies has been unacceptable and I will continue pressing to make sure service is restored as soon as possible. No one should be without power, heat or running water for this long.
Thank you to the emergency crews, first responders, mayors and local officials who are doing everything within their power to keep residents safe and help our towns recover from these hard-hitting storms.  https://t.co/00UvcMIvhV
I stand will all women who are making their voices heard, in our communities and in the workplace, and fighting to make equality a reality. (2/2)

Now is the time for more voices, more gun safety training, and more awareness about the danger signs. Last night, I joined Moms Demand Action in Ridgewood for an important meeting; they and others in our communities are helping to lead the way — and I am grateful.
There's bipartisan support for background checks, closing the gun show loophole, stopping concealed carry reciprocity, bump stock limits, and for ways to catch the troubling warning signs sooner. But, we also have to work together and speak out.
One victim of the senseless violence, Alyssa, moved with her family from Woodcliff Lake to Florida. I agree with Alyssa’s mom that it is time for common sense measures to keep our kids safe.

We need a vote on the bipartisan compromise for Dreamers that I co-sponsored and I promise to fight day and night to ensure we protect the American Dream for the Dreamers.
I reject the false choices created by the hyper-partisan gridlock in DC. I voted for CHIP, to cut health care premiums, to cut taxes for Jersey families and businesses and to keep the government open.
I am 100 percent behind the Dreamers and I promise to continue to fight day and night to ensure we protect the American Dream for them.
Ensuring our children, veterans, first responders, and seniors have access to essential programs like children’s healthcare (CHIP) does not mean I am any less committed to protecting Dreamers.
That shutdown had an enormous impact on the economy costing our country billions in lost economic activity and the loss of essential services.

This Tax Hike Bill will break NJ's back with another $137 million in federal income taxes. I could not support another tax increase for our communities &amp; joined the @NJChamber in opposing it. https://t.co/km2hKJ4DQf
Both Democrats and Republicans from our communities raised the alarm about this Tax Hike Bill. It would raise taxes across NJ – that is why groups like the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce opposed it, and it's why I voted against it. https://t.co/MPwaSd3s3i
"Every New Jersey taxpayer should be furious that this bill passed" – I opposed this Tax Hike Bill because it hurts all taxpayers in New Jersey, including our seniors, homeowners, and small business owners. https://t.co/vEgLn10QFL
Our mortgages? Up 50%. Our property values? Down 10%. Our state and local tax deductions? Gone. This Tax Hike Bill will drive people out of New Jersey, and that's why I opposed it. New Jersey cannot accept another tax increase. https://t.co/ZOPIjTnHIq

3/ they are the most recent and vicious example of an all-to-common thread in our politics: politicians that objectify women.
2/ As a father of a young daughter, I am especially appalled. His words are disgusting, beyond reproach, and -- unfortunately...
