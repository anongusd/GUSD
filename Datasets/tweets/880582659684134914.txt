This was a year riddled in adversity and anxiety on the lives of 800,000 #Dreamers like myself. We have a rare opportunity to pass the #USAACT these comings week. After, we must strategically ensure we take back the House in 2018 with reps that put values above partisanship
I will be working on my Coalition Values Above Politics (VAP), working to in the upcoming midterm elections; supporting those who put their values above partisan gain. We will be targeting 30-50 Districts many in #CA This is all student led and data driven to mobilize #students
I‚Äôll also be working for @Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism under the leadership of an amazing mentor and ally @JonahPesner where I will be focusing on mobilizing the #Jewish community around #DACA and other unspoken bipartisan issues both federally and statewide.
Excited to be spending the summer interning on hispanic and #DACA mobilization with the campaign for @GavinNewsom to become the next Governor of #California

the chaos of revoking the program has already been created. We thank the legal team deeply, but let‚Äôs continue our push in Congress and not act like it‚Äôs all solved. It‚Äôs still developing and as we‚Äôve learned in 2016 what breaks news first isn‚Äôt always the reality of the future.
it‚Äôll be interesting to see how tomorrow‚Äôs meetings play out. 		Please please don‚Äôt think this issue is now solved. It will destroy the urgency we have been building. While it‚Äôs positive, we need a legislative solution, the time is now and the support is there for a #DREAMActNOW
We‚Äôll see how this plays out, while I‚Äôm optimistic on this it is too early to see how it evolves and changes the state of play. 		Today was an already huge achievement for Dreamers, and we have huge huge momentum in Congress (ranging from Dems to freedom caucus members)
The news tonight is a hard fought victory but let‚Äôs NOT forget where we are at or what this means. Our goal hasn‚Äôt changed. We need a permanent solution in Congress, or we will be hostage to any future WH partisan demands. The urgency is still there and we need a #DreamActNow

Congress let down Dreamers last night. But I am still confident we will pass a #DreamActNow in January. Remember how you feel this holiday season, knowing 800,000 others are wondering if this will be there last Christmas or Hanukkah in their only home, the US. Time is running out
@NHDems why did @SenatorHassan and @SenatorShaheen vote against Dreamers last night? They failed to protect those like myself, who gave up every weekend in 2016 to go to Manchester to get them both elected. I did my part, when will you do yours? We demand accountability.
@SenatorHassan @SenatorShaheen Why did you vote against Dreamers in your state yesterday? You let down thousands like myself who gave every single weekend in 2016 to get you elected in NH. We got you elected and then you fail to keep your promises to pass a #DreamActNow sad.

@DimitriNosarev I don't know American history well? Have never been told that. Got a 5 in AP US History and am a history major in college....
@DimitriNosarev @loondale She is 2 years older. No, we raised ourseleves it's called grit.
@DimitriNosarev Wrong. Immigrants have built this nation from the start. Just like I'm sure you are contributing to this nation!
@DimitriNosarev @loondale So sorry to hear about that. I lost her when I was 6. I raised myself with my sister independently at that point.
@DimitriNosarev @loondale Great response.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev Which you should know after 5 years can be converted to a greencard and then naturalization... my mother died before that.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev What part of I and my parents have payed taxes have you not understood?
@DimitriNosarev @loondale Except when I am one of those people it has to be taken personal.
@DimitriNosarev @loondale So who does America need?
@loondale @DimitriNosarev Except your argument is wrong: no one pays for my education AND I also pay taxes....
@loondale @DimitriNosarev What? That is not true. The L1 visa process is designed for eventual Greencard and naturalization. You need to do your research.
@DimitriNosarev @loondale What?!?! Taken care of what? She died!!! If she was alive I would be a citizen by now!
@DimitriNosarev That's a bit bizarre...
@loondale Actually no, the polls were right (calculate national vote which she won) but if you look at battleground polls they were spot on.
@DimitriNosarev Thank you for understanding this. It's a crucial aspect of the debate.
@DimitriNosarev That wasn't my question. What makes you think Dreamers worsen this country?
@loondale @DimitriNosarev Understand how I am suppose to prevent my mothers cancer?
@loondale @DimitriNosarev Except you are not listening, you are just speaking. I came here LEGALLY and because of her death became undocumented. Can you help me
@DimitriNosarev @loondale Can I ask what a Dreamer takes away from you? What is your fear of them? I'm asking to bride my empathy wall.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev Not true. Passed multiple times in the House and Senate.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev Your twisting our words. I have never disrespected you. You don't believe in laws being changed? You need to look up our nation's history.
@DimitriNosarev I haven't begrudged you! I salute your dedication to American democracy. Where I disgraree is your black and white outlook on Dreamers.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev The law is written and changed by congress. My whole life I have contributed to this nation.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev To cancer. I have also not disrespected any of you so I would ask the same respect.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev I don't think you have heard or know my story. I came here legally under an L1 visa and only fell out of status because of my mothers death
@DimitriNosarev Work.
@DimitriNosarev Do you care for your people? Of course I do. I just don't identify with Venezuela as my home. Your attempts to box me in arguments won't
@loondale Look up the most recent fox poll sir.
@DimitriNosarev That's great. You don't see me telling you not to exercise your American democracy? Just like you, we will fight. But we will win.
@loondale @DimitriNosarev How have I mooched? I have not taken advantage of any service whatsoever.
@DimitriNosarev America does need us, because we are nurses, students, teachers, lawyers, and soldiers. We make up the American fabric like our peers.
@DimitriNosarev Excuse me? That is what I am doing. Going to congress and fighting for our future.
@DimitriNosarev And for the sake of the betterment of America, I am confident we will win.
@DimitriNosarev Yes and the fact that a majority of Americans consider this issue more urgent than healthcare and tax reform is a good sign.
@DimitriNosarev Yes I am not a child as people grow. I came here when I was 6, that is a child. Your argument makes no sense.
@DimitriNosarev There is no plan B. America is my only home and the only nation I have contributed to.
@DimitriNosarev Actually losing yet.
@DimitriNosarev National immigration law is made by congress, just like they have the power to change it. It seems you are calling our defeat without
@DimitriNosarev Leaders fight injustices, they don't sit idley while others experience parallel adversity.
@DimitriNosarev What does this mean?
@DimitriNosarev But that isn't true. I myself know 10 Dreamers who came here legally and unfairly fell out of status. Why should  they be punished??
@DimitriNosarev Uphold.
@DimitriNosarev The American identity, evident by history, is NOT tied to immigration status. It's bounded by American ideals that I believe all Dreamers
@DimitriNosarev Dream Act is VERY possible, I really really urge you to reconsider your stance on this issue.
@DimitriNosarev How is there no gain for US? Keeping 800,000 hardworking people who only seek to contribute?
@DimitriNosarev To go back to the home country to then petition.
@DimitriNosarev Option 1 violates law as you can't get married for immigration purposes. Option 2 is inaccesible as a visa requirement often time mean you
@DimitriNosarev Exactly! And I haven't been there since I was 6 (now 20) should I really be sent back to a country I don't call home? Makes no sense.
@DimitriNosarev Responsible for the actions of their parents.
@DimitriNosarev Actually I have to disagree. I've met thousands of Dreamers who came here legally and the immigration system failed them. Children are not
@DimitriNosarev Thank you! Caracas, Venezuela and yourself?
@DimitriNosarev Also, since you love the law you would know option 1 violates the law and option 2 is inaccesible as it is not how it works.
@DimitriNosarev Not true. We can pass a Dream Act deal. It is not so black and white.
@DimitriNosarev Except Americanism is not tied to immigration status, it's bounded by specific core beliefs that Dreamers also have.
@DimitriNosarev Ok, so how can you not empathize that I came here under an L1 Visa and just because of her death I lost my status. How can I prevent this?
@DimitriNosarev Thank you. Considering 86% of American support Dreamers with sensible border enforcement is a good solution you should support.
@DimitriNosarev Understand that the status-quo is NOT a fair immigration system.
@DimitriNosarev If you really wanted Americans first, you would see the moral and economic loss of deporting Dreamers. Being an immigrant, you should
@DimitriNosarev What does looking like 15 have to do with anything?
@DimitriNosarev Since coming, I have only sought to contribute. Your comments are not only insensitive, but counterproductive to forming sensible policy.
@DimitriNosarev This does have an impact, that is how policy is made????? I am not leaving the only country I call home for the mere reason my mother died

@DimitriNosarev Have you read American history? Popular opinion has driven crucial segments of history... also I came here legally, how am I suppose to
