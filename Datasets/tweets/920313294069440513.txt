Check out @Kigguben’s Tweet: https://t.co/t4Oxf3D31G such inhuman actions are widely happening around the world more so in uganda
@HillaryClinton Some tags in Uganda have really gone to ....the elite tag that is worn around the collars of some "Educated " people is but now rendered hopeless by the likes of Andrew Mwenda.		These "elites" at times make me question how they obtained their degrees..
Oohh Mr. Pence you need to focus https://t.co/m3lAoIHIoP
@krassenstein @realDonaldTrump Why the release come after the disappearance of @Jamal
@realDonaldTrump I'm totally  wondering why the release of pastor came after the disappearance of @jamal
RT @krassenstein: @realDonaldTrump You only make deals for your own financial gain apparently... Like the deals you made with Saudi Arabia…
@BarackObama Yes we can
@AnishaUwase @AndrewMwenda With time people change  and get to see the right path to take. And it's a bit better to trust someone whom u know that is cluel than someone who works for his or her stomach and family+relatives. Better not  to hold debates upon majority or minority decisions
@realDonaldTrump I'm wondering why everything that goes bad in the Trump administration is pussed back onto the Democrats who are ain't the leaders. Obama did his job well so u too Mr President do yours too. Let the FBI do their job @americaForeverAtHeart
@DonaldJTrumpJr I think America needs you more than Twitter
@DonaldJTrumpJr I think it's the president who hates transparency
@AndrewMwenda He has the right to carry that bag because he worked for it. That's not tax payers money. It's bobis money
@AndrewMwenda Andy  a talent is far better than politics. Bobi didn't come to politics to make money or be famous because he archieved all that stuff using his talent. He came to politics to fight for the poor,the hustlers who work hard and gain nothing in the end due to the govt policies
@realDonaldTrump Remember America should be a super power country forever. So think about your tariffs Mr.president
@OfwonoOpondo @WhiteheadComm @UgandaMediaCent @nbstv @ubctvuganda @MauriceMugisha Mmmmh... Uganda zaabi
Democracy is not a one day archivement.its built time to time. Blood is shed,but in the end the young generation meets abetter country @freeupuganda
