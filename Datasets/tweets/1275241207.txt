@Walker_Coleman1 My feelings aren't hurt about this, because I'm straight, so you are 100% correct. However, many members of the LGBT community are hurt by your comments because of the hate they've had to suffer in their lives because of their orientation.

@Walker_Coleman1 @somevelvets @macelynvictoria @robbstterrr @Grammarly Kiss me
Just as you have the right to express your opinion, people have the right to respond. LGBT people chose to express this right by sharing their experience of being in that community. Many people were hurt by the insensitive comments you made and they felt the need to respond. https://t.co/2S8DDlIt57
