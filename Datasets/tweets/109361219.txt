. @mennapd - One of the UKs youngest writers. Also, someone who has a grasp of what should and shouldn't be accepted in society that many 3x her age still fail to understand. 		Menna is one of those people that the Welsh will never let the English claim as British.
Future U.S. President, @femshmem - Of Irish decent and thinks Trump's an arse. Enough said.
Also, @nicoftiime - As above but without the Labrador impressions. 		Unapologetically who she wants to be, and (I strongly hope) future candidate in some (I hope presidential) election race.
Firstly, @historicalember - A completely insane person from the Midwest who does an impression of a Labrador. Also, the most underrated person I know. 		Entirely decent, understanding, and unafraid of not overlooking what's wrong, Erin is just... Erin - and that's a good thing

@newgirllbianca Also, weird thing to say this, but I've just realized where I got it from - I used your first name writing something this week. If I do my job properly, one day you might brag about that
@newgirllbianca I might have to get some of the wine too. That looks quite excellent too.

If you don't even know what the difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker is, you haven't earned the right for an opinion on the subject
Incorrect. 		By law, an asylum seeker is entitled to enter the US (or any other country) by any means and must not be detained for doing so, punished for how they enter or have it count against them.		In the US, there is then a year to decide whether to grant refugee status. https://t.co/YI8OIA1wEv

Can we please get rid of the idea that it's for white people to decide what is and isn't racist and for men to decide what is and isn't sexist? 		Can we also please get rid of the idea that facts can be debated and it's possible to have different opinions on them?
@bombaybillythe @IngrahamAngle Well take a look at all of the counties that have gun control of any kind and how few shootings they have. That's the answer.
@RachelLeishman Just do it anyway. Who decided what being an adult means you can't buy?
@yourfeminstboss I've nearly been a victim and I've known the feeling of sitting waiting to hear from someone who's caught up in a mass shooting. I've never experienced anything worse than those two feelings
@IngrahamAngle 5 people were killed in a mass shooting today. Where's your tweet about gun control to stop that happening again?

@SassyEconomist I'm waiting for Huckabee Sanders to try spin it as funds diverted from the annual Mexico budget
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell As there's now an open skies agreement which allows unrestricted traffic rights between the two. The pre clearance in Shannon is now only used for the small number of direct US departures from there, and 1 BA all business class from City which stops to refuel on the way
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell In short, nearly all Irish transatlantic flights used to have to stop in Shannon before crossing the Atlantic, and so eventually the stopover was used as a way to clear customs in Ireland and then land as a domestic flight in the US. But, all of this has changed
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell Okay, so, Dublin and Shannon are the only two airport in Europe that have pre clearance. While it makes sense for Dublin, Shannon has it because of the way flying used to be restricted.
"And have any of you got allergies or are you all healthy or normal?" 		Really, @frankienbennys? That's the line your servers are going to go with?
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell I know the reason but I'll look like a complete geek if I give it
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell And a US border. For a small airport it's surprising they keep that
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell They have a pub in the airport that sells the world's best bacon sandwiches served with Guinness in the morning
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell I like Shannon. I got invited to the wedding receptions of complete strangers twice the first time I was over there
@AllisonRFloyd @artkincell City is good, but they only fly to NY in America
@artkincell @AllisonRFloyd No. Just no.	I hate Gatwick. I may have spent far too much time waiting to take off from heathrow, but always heathrow over Gatwick

@dana_locks @yourfeminstboss @emrazz @BradenInsley @MCharlesPerry @PrairieThoreau @Kelly2katherine @hugobecker @nytimes Ah, but the point you were making is that everyone hates her. It doesn't matter who I am or what I look like because if I, even just as one person, like her, then that makes it impossible for everyone to hate her and you must be wrong
@dana_locks @yourfeminstboss @emrazz @BradenInsley @MCharlesPerry @PrairieThoreau @Kelly2katherine @hugobecker @nytimes I don't hate her. And for good reason.

RT @BenSFletcher: Looks like Pecker is heading for a long stretch https://t.co/WG18zPLBQE
(p.s. for those on here who go out their way to miss the point - this is clearly not serious)
There also be this talkin' baboon but I don't remember tho' details too well because I woke up and be like "Wait, I'm no lion" so I assume it be a dream, but guess what... BEST DREAM EVAAAAAAA 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
And I turn to that hornbill and say, I told yo' so. And also, how yo' still alive after all this time.
NEXT THING I be back home and while the meerkat and warthog distract Woppi in drag I go and kills my uncle. It be like BADDDDD. But it be good because he be bad. It revenge, you get it? and NEXT THING I be like the king again and have cubs of my own.
this other lion. But I save them and I am there for them. And then I discover that this lion, she be the BEEETTTCHHH from the HOMELAND and we get on like there serious tension there. And warthog be like "yo, guys, get yo' selfs' a room" and she be like "no, we got to fight"
And they be like "We'll be there for you when the rain starts to pour" and I say back "I'll be there for you like I've been there before" and then they say "I'll be there for you 'cause you're there for me too" and NEXT THING I am there for them when they nearly get eaten by
And it be like real strange because while we singin' I grow up real fast and become this big lion. And I be like "No one never told me puberty was gonna' be this way, my life's a joke, I'm broke, and my right paw always be stuck in second gear"
I was reluctant at first mind, because they said "Hakuna Matata!" and I be like "Oh, I never been hearing of this Hakuna Matata before. Yo' mad bro?" and they be like "na, it mean no worries" and so I go "okay" and they go "let's sing" NEXT THING we be singing
Anyways, NEXT THING I meet this talkin' meerkat who be taking some time of selling insurance in the UK to be hangin' with his top bro, a talkin' warthog, and I be like "Guys this be HUGE coincidence, I be like a talkin' lion." SO NEXT THING we become the BEST of friends and sing
NEXT THING I run away and leave this sweet little lion cub who I be in love with and I end up in jungle. NEXT THING I be singing "A-weema-weh, a-weema-weh, a-weema-weh, a-weema-weh" because this be my story and I can sing what I want.
So anyways I also have this EVIL uncle who be in league with Whoopi Goldberg and I be like "I did NOT see that coming" because you know, she used to be a singing nun? And then the uncle kills ma' dad and makes me think that I was the one whose fault it was.
But I was like "yeah I am because my dad is king, right? So you better listen to this song about how I just can't wait until I'm king" - Remember this, it be important later on. NEXT THING I do some singing and he end up stuck under hippo so I go "yeah, well suck on that bird"
So ANYWAY. I was this lion right and there were other lions. We were in AFRICA and it was so cool. Well no, actually it was hot. This was Africa and there was the sun. Anyway, there was this hornbill called Zazu right and he was like "oh you are never gonna' be king"
@AllisonRFloyd @BeckyBunzy What's up, motha fuakkkkaaaaas? Yo' son's of bitches would not BELIEVE the night I had last night. Yeah, that right, I called yo' both sons. Why? Because you have BEARDDDDSS. YAHHH, SMOOOTHHHHHH

@redgirlva @AllisonRFloyd Given how much she requests I call others out in her mentions because I can do it in an amusing way there was clearly never a problem here to be angry about in the first place
@redgirlva @AllisonRFloyd I'm not being snippy. You just jumped in on a conversation which you can see clearly by looking at the tweets after is nothing more than an inside joke and then start accusing when it's pointed out to you.
@BeckyBunzy @AllisonRFloyd @bspencer471 NEXT THING we murdered Simba and Disney were like "wait, we need him to make a sequel. Yo' all think people will notice if we use a different lion?"
@BeckyBunzy @AllisonRFloyd @bspencer471 Yup. I mean, if I was Prime Minister that's exactly how I would be. As it turned out my political history involves being handed back my own election leaflet by a voter with the typos circled https://t.co/evSW2QaIA2

@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd the end.
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd And then the NEXT DAY I wake up thinking "wait, why is there Christmas in August?"
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd NEXT THING curtain goes up and we be caught kissing but it be good because it christmas. NEXT THING I arrive back in airport and she jump on me and it be well cute.
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd And we find her house and she introduce me to parents. NEXT THING we be in car together with giant squid and end up at school christmas performance. It be shit. The kids can't act. But it be good because me and this GURLLLLLL do the kissing behind a curtain
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd But then I be like "OMG! Here's a Christmas card she send me and it be well cute". SO NEXT THING me and my Welsh body guard go carol singing in part of London where you get stabbed for lookin' at fellow bros funny
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd NEXT THING I be dancing to some bangin' tune through the house and get spotted by the secretary but it be good because I be the Prime Minister, in it? SO NEXT THING I realized this girl be no good for me and be a distraction, right? So I have her moved away
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd So he be a dick right? So NEXT THING we're having this news conference with loads of cameras around and news like people. I think they be called journalists. NEXT THING I decide to be a dick to this President like he be a dick to woman who work for me and so I be a dick to him
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd ANYWAY back to running the country. So there be this woman who starts and she's the girl who gets the tea. NEXT THING the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES says something bad to her and I be like "bro, that not called for now is it?"
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd And he be REAL bad to her and cheat on her with this woman from his office that he bought a necklace for. And GUESS WHAT? He bought the necklance from MR BEAN!

@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd I only started as the paperboy but then I was asked if I could run the country and I said "HOW HARD CAN THAT BE?" and NEXT THING I'm a world leader right? But more than that, I have a sister who be married to Professor Snape right
@BeckyBunzy @bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd SO, imagine my surprise a few years after losing an election to find myself the PRIME MINISTER of this bunch of rocks called the United Kingdom. And this is a BIG job we talking about here

@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd Anyway, I decide this girl isn't one for me after all as I remember I'm actually a toddler in ENGLAND and I have some growin' up to do so I can be here to tell yo' to stop being creepy and leave Allison alone.
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd And that is the story of how IIIIIII, Sir Playin' it SMOOOTTHHHH got myself a sweet little girl from that state of Massachussetts. Only she wasn't from Massachussets. She was from New York and livin' in Illinois. But yo' get the point.
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd NEXT THING everythin' be good and banging again and I propose to the girl and she says yeah!
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd What I don't know is that back at my chick's parents her father be all "OH THIS MAN IS BADDDDDD" and she be like "NOOOO" but he be like "YEAHHHH" anyway LONG STORY and NEXT THING he be rushin' to the airport to have me freed
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd ANYWAY NEXT THING they say I should be leavin' the place. And so NEXT THING I'm at this airport and I get stopped for not wanting to check my bag, and I be like "I am NEVER flyin' this airline again!" but they be like "good, we're arresting yo'"
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd I THINK I also did something with a baby that meant it cried, or maybe not. I get mixed up. That may be a SEQUELLL BABY. YEAH! Sequel.
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd NEXT THING I make it worse when I try take TURDDD and end up ruining their garden when the man's shitter explodessss everywhere and I be like "oops" and also, I lost your cat but don't worry because here's another who I painted to look like the first
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd So I do okay but NEXT THING I feel like complete outsider. This her family not mine. And it made worse when NEXT THING I break her sista's nose with ball from sand based net ball thing. I think they call it vollyball in those posh places
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd NEXT THING we be sat fo' dinnaaaaa' and I be gettin' bad vibes from her father. I be sure this dude not be fan of mine. He go after my job and doesn't trust me. NEXT THING he be hookin' me up to machine he has hid away and asking me questions to find out if I be truthful
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd And so anyway. We get there and she introduce me for time NUMBA 1 to her parents. Her father be like some former gangster mafia guy and her mother be her mother. They also have a cat.
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd But my plan be disrupted when we both invited to her sistasssss weddin' - her name be Debbie. You with me still? SO NEXT THING we be journeyin' to this place called Long Island. It's like an island but it's also long.
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd NEXT THING I decide I really like this girl. She be my one. A true beauty, yo' know what I mean? SO I decide I should propose to her. And I plan it all out. Real cute and romantic like Hugh Grant in one of those pony English film you' just pretend to like so she sleep with u!
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd So I went out and I found myself some sweet little girl called Pam. NEXT THING we be together and totally chill and in love with each other. I suggest we do some Netflix and chillin' and she be like, "what Netflix?" SO NEXT THING we skip the flix and get staight to the bongoing
@bspencer471 @AllisonRFloyd So like back when I was a nurse right, I had some friends that said hey, Greg — I was called Greg back then — you gotta be gettin’ yo’self some chick because yo’ a real asshole when yo’ single.

Go after them, I'll call you out
@StephenHotHands @BriJoyceBennett @GOP They are all truly beautiful humans. Not one of them is racist or has any hate in them at all. But they have all been through more shit than anyone deserves, but they're still all decent people.

@StephenHotHands @BriJoyceBennett @GOP What you did was miss the point and accuse her of not paying attention. Which is complete bollocks. She knows so much about what's going on in the world she could bore a political editor
@StephenHotHands @BriJoyceBennett @GOP But as someone who has stood for office, while I certainly didn't agree with everything my opponents stood for, there was a shared respect that we were standing for the right reasons. It was the lack of those right reasons that Brianna was referring to in general -on a wide scale
@StephenHotHands @BriJoyceBennett @GOP Where at any point did she make any relation to a specific politician or party? She was making a general statement on the state of politics. And it's one that applies much further than America. There are politicians in all countries and parties that are there for self interest.
@MOWaterhouse Someone beat you to it this week
If you DM or email some project you're working on (especially if it's creative) I'll usually be happy to find time to look, help and share it - the same with charity efforts and similar. 		What I will not do is endorse your independent election campaign or buy drugs from you.
@StephenHotHands @BriJoyceBennett @GOP It's the suggesting someone doesn't pay attention because you didn't see the angle they're coming from that's the problem here. 		Don't be one of those idiots that doubles down. You're better than that.
@StephenHotHands @BriJoyceBennett No. 		You're off the mark there. I get you're trying to be funny, but Brianna is making a serious point and it's one that's a major issue in politics anywhere. She more than pays attention, she's just pointing out something many choose to ignore.
@maxsparber Life's so much more fun when you ignore safety concerns. What's a broken leg in return for a nice view from 30ft in the air?

@ron_pettersson @AllisonRFloyd You don't need to. The fact that you even thought it was okay to tweet that is wrong. And the fact that you're trying to defend yourself makes it worse.

@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett Don't be a dick to her, because I promise you that if you fell on hard times or were in the situation of any of these migrants, even now after what you've said, she'd be one of the first trying to help you. 		Goodnight to you, sir.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett But what she is not is 'condescending' and what she is not is a 'thing'. What she is, is someone who goes out of her way to use opportunities to help others and who knows a lot, lot more than most people. 		She cares and shows compassion for everyone without any judgment
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett Finally, never tell Brianna to 'listen' or call her a 'condescending privileged thing'. 		She's admits she's privileged and it's true. She's been lucky enough not to have half the issues some of had and be born into a good family with high intelligence and ability.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett What matters in the end isn't national identity, a border or a flag. What matters is compassion, decency, care, love, friendship, communication, and respect. That's what makes us human. And if we can't be human then what are we?
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett The fact is, the reason migrants are every trying to get to Europe is because of the state their home is in, and most of that is because of European countries and the United States playing god with the world and messing it all up. 		We have a moral and humanitarian duty to help.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett Happened in the UK which, I can say from experience having spent a lot of time moaning about it, has a very solid border at airports for all intl. flights except those from Ireland, and also the sea.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett There's also no evidence that they make it more dangerous - firstly there is no correlation between recent terrorist attacks and where migrants are concentrated, secondly most attacks are carried out by national citizens, and finally, 3 of the major attacks in recent years
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett There is absolutely no evidence that refugees displaced by wars and conflicts in Africa and the Middle East coming to Europe cause problems or ruin counties - just look at where all the most prosperous and best rated ones to live are
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett What Europe does have is something called the Schengen area - in short, it removes internal borders from EU counties (excluding UK, RoI), plus EFTA nations - Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. 		The external EU border is managed but it's irrelevant to this
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett There's also not unlimited immigration - not sure where you got than one from? Unless you're talking about EU free movement but that's a different thing and is beneficial to all involved.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett Like for example, there are very, very few riots against helping migrants. The 'Refugees Welcome' marches on the other hand have been huge and polling shows the majority are in favour of doing what we can to help them. 		Additionally, they don't ruin the continent at all.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett Working on a project that while not successful in the end, meant I spent a lot of time communicating with those working to help refugees across Europe (hey I even made the front page of a national with the Green Party leader) - so I do know a thing or two.
@ElliotStone17 @BriJoyceBennett Hello. European here. Nice to meet you. Would now be a good time to mention that I've had to look into this issue deeply for work? You see, being in politics for a while mean my researching this stuff. Also, managing to raise thousands for pro refuges causes, and spending months

RT @BurgerKing: due to a large order placed yesterday, we're all out of hamberders. 	just serving hamburgers today.
Johnson will use his new found TV platform to call in reinforcements from America - Trump will agree to the request but rather than send the US army to Britain, he'll send them to Brittany and confuse the shit out of a lot of French tourists.
ITV's Robert Peston will take up a new post having secured the role of the channel's Syria correspondent feeling it would be safer and more secure.
The battle will end in a stalemate and seeking an easier path to the airwaves, Boris Johnson will become a contestant on all of ITV's reality shows which are somehow still being produced for the benefit of all those who have no idea what's happening in the world
and claim victories in Berwick, Newcastle and Carlisle before meeting the Yorkshire Liberation Army around Darlington and agreeing to a truce.		Elsewhere there will be heavy loses in the 'Battle of Broadcasting House' when the BBC, lead by General Fiona Bruce will fight Boris
Back in London, Nigel Farage will ram raid the Bank of England but soon discover it was pointless as the country moves to a system of barter based upon the trade of child slaves and sacrifices.		As fighting continues the Scottish, led by Nicola Sturgeon, will make their way south
By now the fight will have spread across the country and there will be reports of battles in shopping centres. Yorkshire will declare independence soon after and invade Lancashire, while Essex will put its finest minds to sawing itself off the rest of the county and sailing off
The SNP will be the first to crack after taking refuge in the Foreign Office but being unable to find a Scottish flag anywhere. As they walk out with white flags mercy will be shown and they will be allowed to return to Scotland where they will later be punished for desertion
Although the streets of London may be quiet there will still be heavy losses in the forthcoming 'Battle for Whitehall' after protesters clash while providing perfect cover for rival factions to barricade themselves in different government departments.
Half the Labour Party, and the Green Party who survived by charming the rats to fight for them.		As February comes around the battle will be taken to the streets.
The leavers and the anything but Boris Brigade. Matt Hancock will also survive on his own after dressing in white and claiming that as health secretary he's technically a battle ground medic.		Also still standing will the the SNP, Lib Dems (because everyone forgot about them)
Corbyn will be fall during 'The Battle of Westminster Hall' after Theresa May rides Boris Johnson into battle with Rees-Mogg proving heavy artillery cannon fire in support. 		It is at this point that Johnson will stab May in the back leaving only 2 conservative factions;
In the coming weeks there will be limited violence at first as factions agree to truces in order to work together to finish off others.
The fight will start small but Michael Gove will be the first casualty after he atttempts to save some postage stamps in the Commons lobby but everyone will swear it was just a coverup for friendly fire.
Meanwhile, in Parliament there will be a complete breakdown of all order and factions will quickly develop before arming themselves with police officers and antique weaponry, and then barricading themselves in different parts of the building.
My prediction for today		#MPs will vote down the #BrexitDeal after which John Bercow will rise from his seat and declare 'The Games Have Begun' before leaving in a helicopter. The helicopter will be found crashed on Friday but on Saturday someone will swear they saw him in France

What I've just put online is pretty much my entire life - both the good bits and the bad. I've not done this to show off or to try to get sympathy. I don't expect sympathy and I don't want it. I've done this because it's the first time I've ever looked back at...
In 2018 I attempted to take my own life twice - very few people know about it -  and even now I don't understand or know how I ever got to that place, but it came not long after what had been the best year of my life and when things were starting to look as though they'd go well
As someone who friends regularly get annoyed with for not being open about anything, this is a very unusual thing for me to do, but if there's one thing I've realized in recent weeks it's that open is something I should try, even if just to clear my head		https://t.co/0CdN7UgJxQ

@AllisonRFloyd Finally, to secure the election I believe that they kidnapped voters in Florida and threatened to let them live the rest of their life in Flordia if they didn't vote for him.
@AllisonRFloyd with someone like Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz, and so they ended up with Trump. 		To get him elected I think they pushed out a lot of fake news on social media while also undertaking a systematic attack on the cows that count the votes in Wisconsin.
@AllisonRFloyd I think tRump got elected because Russia decided they wanted more power in the world so decided to rig an election. At first they went to Hillary but she deleted their email. Next they looked at the Republican field and decided that not even they could stand to be associated

@martinevestby It was one of the few things I can actually remember from that place. That and there was the teacher who just used to scream about everything
@martinevestby I was at an award ceremony last year where they did a 10 minute tribute to dance just before the host came out and pointed out that they'd just broadcast it live on the radio
Now feels like a good time to also offer credit to @martinevestby for the single best thing anyone has ever said to me when she walked out a room declaring "I don't need to do well in this, I'm Norwegian I'll do great no matter what"
I'm not saying Norway is perfect, but it is a country where literally everything seems to just work https://t.co/ZTjK9nOSTJ
