@andersoncooper Raddatz
As good as Biden did, I don't think it took an ounce of pressure off of the president in his next debate with Romney.
Ryan:"This is not what real recovery looks like; you deserve better. Romney's biz experience makes him qualified to get it done." #inclosing
Biden brings up his visible frustrations but sends a message: "My record stands for itself... has been about leveling the playing field."
Never mind. That wasn't the last question. This is more like it. Generic, but better.
@DanCitizen Up until this last question, Raddatz has been amazing as moderator. Hard questions, follow-ups, holding candidates to task.

@LauraWitkowski That's a fair question.
