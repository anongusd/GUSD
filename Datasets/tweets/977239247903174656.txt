Breaking News one time in house lawyer from @realDonaldTrump is now a bad lawyer says Donald Trump.  I bet there is a lot more Russian money on @realDonaldTrump taxes returns than Cohen's father in-laws.
How about you open the Government and stop all funding for Mexico until they give you 5.7 billion.
Funding for only a small portion of wall is not worth shutting down the Government.  Lets go for the full amount.  Seriously you want us to believe funding for only a tenth of the wall will keep us safe. No Deal.
um 5.7 billion will build only a fraction of the total amount to complete the wall.  So I am very confused how 5.7 billion is the end all of end to save us from crime and drugs. @realDonaldTrump if we need the wall for security I do not feel safe with only a small wall. full wall
