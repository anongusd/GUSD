@AP YouTube  so now you have to sign up to youtube to get your free stuff, but what about my videos? Are they blocking or going to block users from seeing my content unless they pay up! Black mail. And hey that's my stuff!  if I want to give it away free like a video tutorial

@WhipClyburn Criminals can get a gun faster than the regular public! Ilegal weapons are every where! And these laws you pass just protects the criminal not protect the innocent!
@WhipClyburn That's fine we need to get rid of background checks altogether. It gives the Government to much power over our arms ! And milita. You made a vow to protect and defend the United States  Constitution but so far you have tried to distory  it. Your nothing more than a commie!
@OregonGovBrown so what other communist laws have you passed that violates our United States Constitution which you swear an otherwise to keep and up hold! Obviously your a liar and a thief stealing rights away from we the people!
@OregonGovBrown so Governor  Kate Brown how can you belive in the United States Constitution when you pass communist rent control laws. One thing under the United States Constitution is right to own  private property. With a stroke of a pen you took away rights to charge rents
@WhipClyburn I have been in the Security field for years and protected many churches, why didn't they have some kind of security? You point blame at the gun laws but maybe you need to look back at what that church could have done? Most criminals can get a gun faster than a law abiding citizen
@WhipClyburn We need to get rid of background check all together period, get rid of but stock BS concealed and Carry Permits and all and all the other nonsense violates our constitution we have the right to bear arms have ammo period and shall not be infringed!
@WhipClyburn If you don't like or freedoms of buying guns move! Move out of the United States of America that's what my ancestors did few hundred years ago. It's time for people like you to leave our country, if you don't like it here! Gun rights are apart of our constitution!
@WhipClyburn That's dosen't mean he wouldn't be approved for a gun on his background check. Second he could have used something else like a pressure cooker bomb! Quit trying to take our Constitutional rights away! We have had those right what 500 years now. Or more. That's why we move here !

@JordanSekulow Kim will make two hundred nukes then lie and give up five nukes to Trump , Trump will sucker for it and give Kim money etc then Kim will have more power to murder his people etc all from the USA you can't do deals with thugs like these
@JordanSekulow You can't make deals with Satan ! Kim murders people for just having a Bible or praying to Jesus , you can't work with pure evil like that, that's like working with Hitler asking him to be nice. Kim will never honor any of his agreements he will just lead Trump nose down the road

@_Shua_007 @SeattlePD ends up happening is the police look the other way, or just don't show up, until it's over. Etc sounds familiar? And crime goes up up up Nancy Chuck in my opinion really cared about Americans who have been living here in the United States for hundreds years would build that wall.
@_Shua_007 @SeattlePD By making up fake prosecutable crimes against police Military law enforcement you make it harder for them to do Thier jobs because of a real fear of making a mistake.
@_Shua_007 @SeattlePD Since Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi  will not secure our borders ignorance is bliss, they both wanted to closed down ICE and other things like Bush administration open border PS I used to work side by side with ilegal immigrants on farms. When I was a kid.
@_Shua_007 @SeattlePD Some of those Police or law enforcement were border agents !
@_Shua_007 @SeattlePD I guess I must explain, someone had just mentioned that people were selling crack and police just kept driving by. Recently many police have been indicted some I agree some I don't,  and making it so The Police officers are now faced with being charged with crimes

Audit all
Nope I wouldn't,  and just keep on going and use the military  to replace TSA or others who need to get temp jobs , US United States  Military  like in the IRS.

@NewsGuardRating How would you prove it's fake News or not?
@NewsGuardRating What happens if a site thinks abortions are evil but your Journalist think it's okay to chop up babies. So you incorrectly target that site with a bad warning. Isn't that breaking our Constitutional rights to express our views of religious expression?
@NewsGuardRating By rating sites don't you feel like your breaking the Constitution, and the freedom of speech that people have to express themselfs. Putting your opinion into the browser gives you a clear advantage and no rebuttals for the accused.
@NewsGuardRating I heard your financed by the United States Government is that true. By US advertising .... or Cash and how much?
@NewsGuardRating so in the past CIA has put Fake News Articles in the News papers how will your Journalist discover these fake stories. Same for Russians and other Media stories for other countries  that are published?

@JackPosobiec The United States of America has every right to defend itself from terrorist no matter where they hide that's why we have the right to go into other countries that hide them like Syria like Iraq Iran Syria other places we hunt them down and have every right to do so
@JackPosobiec response to countries have sovereignty until the attack other countries with terrorists as soon as another country breeds terrorists and protects them and lets them attack other countries they no longer have sovereignty from being attacked by other countries that's the law
@JackPosobiec You may say we are Target's there for the terrorists and then a way that's true because we're there and their home the hunt them down so we show up at their doorstep and say here we are. That's better than having them come to America and say here they are like a 911
@JackPosobiec Syria has lots of Terrorist that Russains sponsor like Hezbollah and many unknowns ones as well. I get so sick and tired of hearing how the United States sponsors terrorists spend so does China and Russia and India and many other countries so we have to have our own to!
@JackPosobiec It's sad to see our young men die period. Personally I would have Nuked Syria after everybody left. Instead of seeing our young men die, same with Afghanistan. But I don't think it's in vain beating up the enemies some let's them know we can hunt them down too.
@JackPosobiec Second I don't think assud runs things anyway and we maybe trying to flush out who is really in charge there. Asud has said he stays mostly in his castle. And dosen't seem to know much.
@JackPosobiec The SAS had done many raids into Iraq and Syria for years and wouldn't surprise me if the CIA has to.
@JackPosobiec For forgot a few things where is the French they are there to, so are British forces to. Maybe some other countries forces we don't know about also. The reason the United States is in Syria is because it's been a hot for terrorist around the world including Russia.

Like you said earlier I had a case I knew about medicine 1 billion dollars what do you do and you save one person's life who pays for it and that was the cost of the medicine not retail. So where do you draw the line? https://t.co/edlykchBrn
I believe that most diseases are probably curable. If we knew the right Physicians and money and lots of it. We can here in the great United States save ourselves. https://t.co/DphVdidDuH
So you see medicine can get to extremely costly where do we draw the line? Per person? That's why we let money decide and NOT Government! If you have enough money you saved your life, if not your done. And keep Government out of it. Unless the Government pays for it. https://t.co/DphVdidDuH
I know of a particular case that it cost 1 billion dollars for dose of medication just save a life so do we then make the drug manufacturer lower the price which that's the actual cost? or do we Ding the government that money? It's a true story. What do we do? Or let the boy die? https://t.co/DphVdidDuH
It's just heartbreaking that people cannot afford life-saving medication but it's how it is money buys you life and that's the way it is sometimes the government can supplement that. But if the government can't that's how it is. https://t.co/DphVdidDuH

There is no such thing is free everything costs you can manipulate the numbers all you want but it has to be paid for somehow whether you are communist or a capitalist it has to be paid for one way or another https://t.co/c3p0iAbT4B
The rich if they have to will build their own hospitals and go there leaving the rest of us without any medical help so we have to help pay for what we have or we will not get the best medical treatment that's available because the rich can do just that. https://t.co/c3p0iAbT4B
You get a system that is free and it's first come first serve so when I need help there may be no help there when I needed it so having a free System can mean a lower graded system as everybody feeds off of it it degrades like the Canadian system there is no free lunch. https://t.co/c3p0iAbT4B

How come you haven't voted for the wall so the government can't be reopened so you are starving people and making it so they can't eat and pay the rent because you won't from the wall stop illegal drugs from coming into the United States so you're responsible https://t.co/kcglwoDwyi

@TulsiPress She will have a strangle hold on your economy. On it goes. Women should never be allowed to be in power ever. It's pure evil. And now she wants to ruin the United States of America by running for the Presidency? God Help us all!
@TulsiPress She will lead you into poverty send your wealth instead of saving and investing. She will make harsh laws so Corporations can't make any money and they will all or mostly leave. Unemployment high. 	She will blame corporate for China's waste upon your shores and lie
@TulsiPress The people where Tulsi Gabbard Rules beware! Your being ruled away from nature and away from what God intended. She will leave you heart broken and lost. She her self cannot receive God's inspiration and guidance like men can. That leaves her open for the wrong kind
@TulsiPress So they the people in the past wrote down the most important things. After seeing endless results. And women not being rulers is one of them! This should be a warning to all Citizens of the United States of America. Does God rule with a mother in heaven? NO!
@TulsiPress Whole Civilizations in the past ruled by women have been utterly distroyed! I don't recall ever in history any women rulers ever did any good at all. The Bible has been around for a long long time who knows maybe millions of years and wisdoms passed down to us.
@TulsiPress Another female who wants to Govern the people. Unreal! God save us all from this evil! The Bible teach us that Eve was supposed to be an help mate for Adam. Not a ruler over him nor over people. If you look at Nature it's that way also.

This is caused by over spending and not paying your bills and then having sanctions placed on your country , not because of Socalism https://t.co/s3IBnT646h
No, and the why no is because Congress is the one who the Constitution has made Chief maker of all laws and all power comes and is invested in Congress even over the president the Judges everything. Congress however loves to pretend they are not in control of anything which is BS https://t.co/KVcSyrnil7

@realDonaldTrump My question is after Ukraine is Taken over, will you help Georgia? Or the other border now NATO States? Or let Russia have them too? What about Poland? Will you stop him there? If not there what about Germany? What about Africa ? Will you let Putin take Norway?
@realDonaldTrump Putin has big plans if the US gets in the way WW3 so you see Putin plans to expand far beyond the old Soviet Union I think his next play is Ukraine since he kicked you out of Syria. Any day now. Of course I expect you'll do nothing because you like Putin
@realDonaldTrump WHY does Putin want Ukraine, because of their declining birth rates, they have more dead than born. Putin wants a larger Military needs more men Ukraine has millions he can use. So he can invade Poland, Georgia, Moldova, and others near by then Germany all of it.
@realDonaldTrump said but remember Putin said World War three if Hidabeast got in. So now her friends are back in power. In the house. Who know what could happen in the Senate they could all be cowards and jump ship join the Dems then pass crap veto proof.heads will roll
@realDonaldTrump You put a women at the U.N shows weakness. You didn't stand up for Ukraine shows weakness. You stopped Military pressure on North Korea and got no Nukes Weakness. Left Syria Shows Weakness. ISIS still in Iraq Weakness! Let Taliban retake parts Afghanistan weaknes
@realDonaldTrump Sir, My worry is that your love to work things out with Putin has influenced your judgement to do nothing while trying to be Putin's friend. While Putin betray that trust and puts his final Nukes in place. While the U.S. does nothing. Then Putin Attacks US.
@realDonaldTrump I just heard that Putin fired off an ICBM test! Is that true! Not in the Fake News! Putin said Get Ready for something Big to happen! Could that be NUKE THE USA OR INVADE UKRAINE? HOPEFULLY YOUR ON YOUR TOES AND WILL NOT GET BLINDSIDED BY NUKE HITS BY PUTIN!

@DeplorableChoir I bet will know more when the new Congress gets in office. Shit will hit the fan. Trump's days may be numbered not looking good from what I can gather.
@DeplorableChoir Congress throws Trump out. FBI has a great story to tell and recordings etc to back it up I bet. Because it was a sting operation against Trump. I don't think Trump has a clue what's really going on. But slowly he is figuring it out. Soon the Public will know.
@DeplorableChoir They will all get out of jail cards or reduce sentences and may even get paid to testify against Trump. Corsi and Stone were not apart of the sting. But do add some icing to the cake. PS I am not a LIB but a Classical Republican. They can only throw Trump out of office if
@DeplorableChoir Haha rumor has it that Flynn and some others were all working for the CIA and FBI in a sting to set up Trump. Before and during the election. So was Trump's Lawyer. Some of the staffers were in on it. To set up collusion between Trump and Russains. And of course Trump was willing

@realDonaldTrump So the whole Trump Tower in Moscow was a CIA and FBI Sting from the beginning trying to entrap Trump and others. Since Trump didn't know the laws it was a slam dunk. Even if collision never happened it will appear like it did.
@realDonaldTrump Some theorized that the Trump Tower in Russia was to try to entrap Trump before the election in a deal where Putin gets a 50 Million suite in exchange for election meddling to help Trump win. And Hilldabeast loose. CIA and FBI set up the sting for the Tower etc..
Manaford is more powerful than Mueller the FBI Noticed the Military has not Court Marshalled Manaford. Probably still getting his retirement. So why the Pony show? My guess is Manaford was a mole for the CIA and FBI to spy on Trump and they want to make it look like he is not. https://t.co/DsEr52pI2i
So far scams what scams, this is a retired General he is watched by the Military and CIA everything he does he is watched! Even in retirement. And they never saw or caught his scams? Right! I don't believe it! This guy is loaded with Military secrets they would never want out! https://t.co/DsEr52pI2i
I have heard of not paying your taxes or lying on your taxes or not reporting your income , but never heard of tax avoidance. So I put my funds in an tax free IRA and now that's tax avoidance? Huh? https://t.co/DsEr52pI2i
I have seen no proof of those scams or Tax avoidance. So far far as I know the IRS has not changed him with any charges. 42 Million could be late fees and charges not just the amount he didn't pay taxes on. Or it could be all charges. I never have heard of tax avoidance ? https://t.co/DsEr52pI2i
@realDonaldTrump don't quote me I believe George Washington even rented out his second house to people who were from other countries, while he was President. And was not approved by Congress. He even took home some gifts from 	foreign Governments too. Endowments we're not gifts.
@realDonaldTrump Title of Nobility Clause Washington sold Goods and Services to foreign countries. Like England. He sold Flour, Wheat, Whiskey, Chocolate, Fish, Iron Works, Tin Works, before and after the Revolutionary War. I am sure while President without Congress approval.

@realDonaldTrump Shut down the Investigation and then release all documents. That will get them running for cover. Other wise they will make a hypothetical case against you, and the Congress might believe it next year who knows!
@realDonaldTrump You need to defend yourself, use everything to your disposal, they are doing so against you! 	Shut down the Mueller Investigation now ! Fire Mueller other wise he may find another case against you later. They are not going to stop until your gone! I hope you understand that!
@realDonaldTrump I think but not sure but your new female CIA chief I think is an old bush supporter and you know Bush hates you.
@realDonaldTrump And the bad thing is after you fire them which you should do, the next ones you hire could be a Bush or Hillary mole and work for them. Need to get these organizations working for them self's again and for the American people.
@realDonaldTrump Well known that Hilldabeast has part of the FBI in her pocket, the Bushes have the CIA in there Pocket! So so firing some of them will help but you have to find out how deep it goes. 	Democrats send there FBI moles into there, Republicans are to stupid to do that.

@TheJusticeDept I could see this Department getting way out of hand for either party! I don't think this is a good idea, we have enough laws on the books to take care of people breaking our laws. Hate Crimes should be left to the lower courts not feds.
@TheJusticeDept Someone said they want to blow your house up...but your not sure if they are serious. So you call the police and they get arrested for hate crime! Scarry. And they could be just joking! Or just mad at you! Or you expressed something you don't like about Democrats next thing ....
@TheJusticeDept This department is alarming because it could be used to stop free speech, or decent. You post I don't like ilegal immigrants and soon you find your self with your home door kicked in arrested for hate speech which they made it a Crime. And they arrest you. At gun point.
@TheJusticeDept Not sure why we need additional hate crime charges. We already have laws on the books for murder and other crimes, I can see down the road almost anything could be construed into a hate crime. Or anything you say or post could be construed as a hate crime.

@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS Again the S300mpu is still  made back in 1980 90s really old Technology this is 2018 guy, most of our equipment  has been upgraded to 2018 Tech including our missiles...  smart AI missiles which can think for them selfs . It's truly scary. Small drones that can take out your s300
No, there is more to it I didn't  explain the s200 sites were over ran by anti Assad forces and they destroyed all missiles and damaged the s200 launchers radar etc a day Russia sold them new parts and missiles or even whole new trucks to get the systems  back on line. https://t.co/G7jZzJ1wOi
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS S-300PMU (Russian С-300ПМУ, US DoD designation SA-10f) was introduced in 1992 this might also be able to be fitted with a nuclear warhead that's why the United States  is concerned.
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS So the s200 sites were destroyed and had to be rebuilt by Russians,  so I was right Putin sold them a bunch of outdated shit!
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS status.[30] For example, in July 2016, the Syrian Army, with Russian assistance, rebuilt a S-200 site at Kweires airport, near Aleppo.[
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS FYI Starting with the Russian intervention in the civil war in late 2015, there were new efforts to restore some Syrian S-200 systems. Indeed, on 15 November 2016, the Russian defence minister confirmed that Russian forces repaired Syrian S-200 to operational
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS I see I am sure they have a demo working
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS The S500 might have a small threat depending on how many
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS The S300 will not help either
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS That not what Putin said but maybe  your right
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS I see
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS no Russians at that base that got hit? Poppycock! Right there is over 68,000 Russians there they are everywhere what the Iranians some how know how to read Russian language! Hahaha the S200 book is all in Russian! And some how the jumped on borad and instantly knew how to use it
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS the S200 was made before 1978 ? That's how old those jets are made back in 1978! So the S200 was made in the 1960 or 1950s what a rip off for Assad, hahaha Putin gives Assad ancient  equipment junk that's supposed to shoot down 1950 aircraft! How much oil did Assad pay for that!
@RobPutrus @DEFCONWSALERTS No Putin has S300 S400 OVER there after the last United States  spanking ! PUTIN said so him self help was upgrading his systems after the last bombing. Putin is full of shit he is just covering his ass, because  his equipment sucks. And everybody knows it except Assad!
@DEFCONWSALERTS Like I said my own Android phone and an app could have watched the Russian plane that was shot down fly over Syria! Hahaha j think the Iranians shot the Russian plane down on purpose to blame Isreal!
@DEFCONWSALERTS They already have the S500 S400 S300 Putin said so many times, now there going to upgrade it. That's a bunch of shit, Putin is just saying that because his equipment is junk, and the United States equipment is superior. And that's our old 1970 equipment technology!
@realDonaldTrump big help is change the law allowing people to live on their own recreational property if they want to. As long as they have a portable septic tank so that can be pumped out every so often. Then maybe one in the ground later. We should be able to live off the grid
@realDonaldTrump I spend thousands of dollars for things I don't need I can't have power or fiber hooked up to my own property! These codes go against the Constitution if you want power as long it's not harming anyone I should be able to have it. Without any other conditions
@realDonaldTrump Codes book needs fixing  high speed fiber going right through my property in order to have that I have to pour a cement slap for a trailer put a trailer on it. I told them I just wanted the high speed and hopefully the power poll hooked up for video surveillance
@realDonaldTrump You need to get a handle on these code enforcement laws. They are stopping development. Example I want power to my property, code said I have to put in fist $8,000 septic tank I don't need .

For me when you start including UFO and remote viewing to the mix you lose my interest fast. More stuff like that took over instead of facts like real pictures and Videos. It's like coming to a UFO show then part way through it the rest of the show is Remote Viewing, https://t.co/2YOZgpb9WI

@realDonaldTrump Donald we know the media is bad, that's why most of us were against cable TV news and not free aired news. Like we used to have. I turn that dial and watch ABC, CBS,NBC, or local stuff we had some competition. With cable and satellite and cell no need to complete

The Sun dosent need oxygen to burn, but it does have it. https://t.co/job7KhG8dt
The core of the sun is really dense, in order to be that way, it must have denser material at it's center. Like Gold, Lead, Uranium, maybe other metals still undiscovered. Those metals are in a gases state or plasma state. Which in my view help keep the sun together. https://t.co/job7KhG8dt

@megan_mcguir Here is a link that proves that it's the citizens who have the right to bear arms not just the military. Cheers ! 		https://t.co/nqiKEUH0We
@megan_mcguir If we undermine our Constitution with distroying our Rights to bear arms, what's next freedom of speech? Have our Government tell you where you can live work and much more?
@megan_mcguir Continued		 England just passed NY for homicides, they have no guns laws, there homicides are now done with a kitchen knife. Which they are going to ban that next. 		Dimitrios Pagourtzis had also pipe, and pressure cooker bombs he could have used those instead.
@megan_mcguir Continued The right to bear arms, 		Third the right to have a gun keeps crime rates in check. Criminals think or know that most home owners have a gun they think twice before committing a crime. No guns  	rampant crime. Just ask England.
@megan_mcguir Continued, right to bear arms.		Second to keep our foreign enemies at Bay. largest Military in the world is the United States People! That's why Russia, China, India, etc have not invaded the United States is because of the right of every citizen own assult Riffles
@megan_mcguir Continued ... The right to bear arms keeps our own Government in some kinda check on it's power. They make a law that upsets most of the population they will have 300 million plus armed Americans coming for them.
@megan_mcguir I am sure your upset but feel greatful your not dead. Sorry for your loss and pain you are going through. 		Our right to bear arms, was given to us at brith. It is a right that a of good law abiding Americans cherish. The right to bear arms helps do many things ...
