RT @BlackGirlNerds: #TWCC #TidewaterComicon https://t.co/wAWzD5yrJw
On "Ghostbusters": Ernie Hudson liked the first movie better. "Even though I made more money on the second." #twcc
Ernie Hudson is very spiritual. "The good news is no one's better than you. The bad news is you're no better than anyone else." #twcc
When he was younger, he was more "method," Ernie Hudson says. "I don't do that anymore." #twcc
"At some point you have to say 'How much is it worth?'" A job has to be fun or worth the cash, Ernie Hudson says. #twcc
"No matter what your work is ... Your work is your gift," Ernie Hudson says. He has turned down roles when "I'm not feeling that." #twcc
The only thing Ernie Hudson kept from "Ghostbusters": The jumpsuit. (It later disappeared.) "I'm not a collector." #twcc
Someone accidentally hit the light switch. "Slimer's at it again," Ernie Hudson says. "Thank God there's  a Ghostbuster in the house." #twcc
"You can't joke with the press because they'll write it down and somebody will take it out of context," Ernie Hudson says. #twcc
On "Ghostbusters": "It's special to people, and that makes it special to me," Ernie Hudson says. #twcc
"I used to wear my ("Ghostbusters") jumpsuit at conventions, but people started posting online 'This poor guy ...'" says Ernie Hudson. #twcc
Comedy? Drama? What does he prefer? "I just want a job," Ernie Hudson says. #twcc
"If you can just let go of that fear a little bit, this is a great place to be and a great time to be in it," Ernie Hudson says. #twcc
"All of us are tapped into this creative force. That's what I love about the first 'Star Wars," Ernie Hudson says. #twcc
"I've had to go on a live-tweeting diet," @BlackGirlNerds says. There are too many good shows, not enough time. #twcc
Which means it's also easier to say "your show sucks" or "good job" to the people in charge, @VeilsofSnark says. #twcc
In the past year, there's a greater coordinated effort by show execs to include Twitter, involve that community, @VeilsofSnark says. #twcc
"Scandal" is one of the best at live-tweeting, @taigoodensays. The official account responds to and retweets fans. #twcc
Hashtags: Each has its own audience related to TV shows, @VeilsofSnark says. #twcc
.@ButerflySamurai likes to live-tweet reality shows ‚Äî "Ink Masters" and "Survivor" top her list. #twcc
More shows are coordinating live-tweeting with actors and directors. #twcc
Live-tweeting a show "is like having an extended couch in your living room," @taigooden says. #twcc
The biggest show for @taigooden: "Doctor Who." Live-tweeting helped her find other fans and meet people. #twcc

Those are the kinds of comic con panels I like ‚Äî quite interesting. And I learned a local college has a comic book history course. #twcc
Many publishers went out of business after the code was put in place. #twcc
That move made comics much slower to produce because of the approval process ... But the publishers got good press for it. #twcc
Afterward, 34 comics publishers banded together and adopted the comics code in 1954. #twcc
Wertham gets Congress involved. Hearings were held in NYC. #twcc
Author Frederic Wertham had a lot of problems with women stepping out of the kitchen. #twcc
The author was concerned about sexuality and violence in comics, behavior that wasn't "acceptable." #twcc
"Seduction of the Innocent" was published in 1954 about the influence of comics. #twcc
There were comic book burning events across the US in the late '40s.  #twcc
In 1948 radio debate on comics: "Comics are the marijuana of the nursery." #twcc
Sterling North, literary editor at Chicago Daily News, was an early (1940) critic. "Badly drawn, badly written and badly printed." #twcc
First comic book was published as promotional item. It took a few years for publishers to realize people would buy them, Puaca says. #twcc
Before the 1954 comics code, comic books were fairly controversial. But you're know what they say: Sex sells. #twcc
Brian Puaca is a history professor at Christopher Newsport University. #.com
In the Cold War world, comics became an easy scapegoat for the nation's insecurities, says Brian Puaca. #twcc
Up next: Comics and censorship. #twice
If you're over 30, "you grew up with superpowers." #twcc

@AMBabka @MediaNowSTL @stlmag Hey now, you're an all-star!
"The faster you get to Twitter when something is happening, the easier it will be to find it," @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
Treat your Twitter bio like a business card. If you don't want people to know information about you, don't share it, @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
"Just because someone has that little blue checkmark by their name, doesn't mean they're trustworthy," @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
See a great photo on Twitter or Instagram? Always ask: "Did you take this picture?" @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
"Social media often unveils a lot more debates than it does information," @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
Want to know more about a photo? http://t.co/E7q7Gyp6g7 But it doesn't work with photos from Twitter or Instagram, @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
@ddfairchild @PDBeth @CrowdRiff I wasn't ‚Äî thanks for the tip!
Check the "tweets &amp; replies" timeline to see what your source is saying to others, @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
RT @bsmithEHS_hub: @PDBeth teaching the Social Media kids how to verify anything on social media sites. #mnstl15 #medianowparty http://t.co‚Ä¶
.@PDBeth just called me out for not having a location turned on in my tweets ...
Look at a user's bio, timeline, location and language when trying to verify the accuracy of posts, @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
Just because someone posts a photo doesn't mean they took it (or that it's real), @PDBeth says. #mnstl15
Look at Twitter bios for clues to who a person is, @pdbeth says. Also look for specifics: "Sources say" is not specific. #mnstl15
Next: @PDBeth talks about verifying social media posts. #mnstl15
"Nothing makes me more upset than when I see my photo taken" and misrepresented by someone else, @pdpj says. #mnstl15
After #Ferguson, @kodacohen and @pdpj say they use Twitter much more now. #mnstl15
"When you don't feel safe, leave," @pdpj says. #mnstl15
"It's more dangerous today. There are more guns on the streets of #Ferguson today," @pdpj says. #mnstl15
The bigger challenge for @kodacohen during #Ferguson: Making sure he wouldn't get arrested. He couldn't cover anything from jail. #mnstl15
"I don't consider our job, for the most part, being terribly dangerous. Everybody makes their own decisions," @kodacohen says. #mnstl15
"You don't want to be tweeting so much that you actually miss what's happening," @pdpj says. #mnstl15
"What is an engagement?" asks @pdpj, looking through his Twitter analytics. The social media class should be able to answer that. #mnstl15
You can't stop shooting photos at deadline, @kodacohen says. There's more than a print newspaper to support. #mnstl5

RT @brosepd: "I think of the blog as a barstool conversation." @dgoold #mnstl15 http://t.co/pctrdSoM83
A blog is a dry-erase board. An article in the paper stands on its own, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
That means it's a two-way street, @dgoold says of Twitter fights. He's blocked 1 person, muted none. #mnatl15
"If you are in Twitter, you are agreeing to the rules of Twitter. It's constantly changing," @dgoold says. #mnstl15
Be true to yourself ‚Äî don't try to play a persona, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
"You have to be consistent," @dgoold says. Your persona on multiple platforms must be the same. #mnstl15

@2xAught7 @dgoold Weirdly, there a box of chalk. But no chalkboard.
@mgeheren Stop by anytime!
Tone is very important in stories and social media. It's different for a @Cardinals game and a federal investigation, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
That puts the media back into its intended role as a watchdog, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
The equation has changed: Teams can now reach out to fans. Some see the media as a hindrance, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
Sometimes news breaks because of activity of Twitter, @dgoold says. That's included roster moves. #mnstl15
That next-day story should be forward-looking, not a recap of what's been online all day, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
Twitter has changed what news is, @dgoold says. News is presented in stages ‚Äî a tweet, a blog post, a story, the next day's paper. #mnstl15
Fan urgency had changed the business, @dgoold says. #mnstl15
.@sltoday was one of the first papers to start a baseball blog, @dgoold says. It was their first step into real-time reporting. #MNstl15

A few hours later, @kodacohen saw that photo on T-shirts in #Ferguson. #mnstl15
.@kodacohen missed the paper's deadline, but tweeted it. #mnstl15
"The picture happened ... it just came out of the blue," @kodacohen says. "I just happened to be across the street." #mnstl15

"When in doubt, wait a minute before you hit send," @stevegiegerich says he learned from @nickpistor. #mnstl15
"My philosophy has always been to write what's right in front of me, because that's all I can do," @stevegiegerich says. #MNSTL15
"I don't recommend talking to people with automatic weapons," @stevegiegerich says of his experience reporting in #Ferguson. #mnstl15
.@stevegiegerich has 40 years of reporting experience. No other story has moved as fast as #Ferguson, he says. #mnstl15
Preparation is important, @fotobro says. During breaking news is no time to play with new technology, he says. #mnstl15
Before Aug. 9, @kodacohen had a few Twitter followers. Two days later, there were more than 9,000. #mnstl15
"It really forced both myself and our staff to find some new technology and get pictures back a lot faster," @kodacohen says. #mnstl15
"A rumor will spread faster on social media faster than the truth will," @pdbeth says ‚Äî a lesson learned during #Ferguson. #mnstl15
RT @maksl: In digital age, you must focus on verification, even it that means others breaking news before you,  @ayulo says. #mnstl15

The #DoctorWho panel wraps up #twcomicon for me. I have equally fun things to do, like laundry and grocery shopping. Hooray!
"We haven't seen the end of River Song, plain and simple," Ben Taylor says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
River is Capt. Jack Harkness as a woman and married to the Doctor, Ben Taylor says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
River "is an antagonist. She literally killed him. She's also his wife, so she's literally an antagonist," Ben Taylor says. #twcomicon
Once we found out why Clara existed, why did she continue? asks @pixelwhoart. She's a houseguest who won't leave. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"I'm a fan of companions who aren't afraid to tell the Doctor he's being an idiot." #DoctorWho #twcomicon
Favorite companions? Ben Taylor says Donna, Rory and the Brigadier. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"Fox: The place where Joss Whedon shows go to die. You know what's not on Fox? #DoctorWho," says Ben Taylor. #twcomicon
Joss Whedon as a #DoctorWho director? No ‚Äî Ben Taylor says he wants a season where no one dies. #twcomicon
@TWComicon Name signs in front of panelists would be great too.
"I want the doctor to stop letting literally everyone on the TARDIS," Ben Taylor says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
Someone in the audience says "@NathanFillion could pull it off" (playing the Doctor). The crowd is full of "ahh"s. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"The doctor needs to be amazing," Ben Taylor says. It shouldn't matter if it's a man or woman. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
A female doctor in the future? Ben Taylor says no, not as long as "old white men own the BBC." #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"I get so tired of the romance element" of #DoctorWho, @pixelwhoart says. #twcomicon
Ben Taylor: "I love Donna. Which is why if I ever meet Russell T. Davies I will give him a really big hug and then punch him." #twcomicon
Some companion-centric episodes work, like "Blink," @pixelwhoart says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"I watch 'Doctor Who.' I don't watch 'Doctor Who and the Companions,'" @realityamuck says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"I want to like Clara," @realityamuck says. Since she's been through the Doctor's timeline, she should, really, know everything. #twcomicon
What if Missy and the Doctor went off together to find Galifrey? #DoctorWho #twcomicon
"Unborn babies" knew who Missy was, but Moffat seemed to think it was a surprise, Ben Taylor says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
Clara broke the fourth wall once. The doctor used to do that all the time, Ben Taylor says. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
There's not a lot of love for Clara. "She's been written out of the show three times," Ben Taylor says. Still there. #DoctorWho #twcomicon
Steven Moffat's #DoctorWho Christmas specials have been, literally, Christmas.: Christmas Carol, town name, killer Santas ... #twcomicon

"Let Batman be the pessimist and Superman be the optimist," @PooyaMohit says. #twcomicon
Geopolitical events often influence Superman stories. 9/11 has affected the Superman mythos, too, @ezrapetersen points out. #twcomicon
King? No. Kind. Kind of in "Man of Steel." #typo

Scan images in Photoshop where you can play with dark and light, and try inking it yourself, @ErykDonovan says. #twcomicon

"Draw every day. Create every day," @ErykDonovan tells aspiring artists. #twcomicon
Process for a comic artist: Read, internalize, break it down into its beats, and then thumbnail it, @manofmissle says. #twcomicon
"(Smaller) conventions like this are the best conventions you can go to to get potential work," @ianmcginty says. #twcomicon
Need a writer for a book? Or need an artist for a book? Look for people in similar circumstances, @ErykDonovan advises. #twcomicon
Writers looking to hire an artist for a book: Google fair prices first, @ianmcginty says. #twcomicon
Comic versus movie scripts: "Have you ever seen 'The Room'? Don't be that guy," @TiniHoward says. #twcomicon
Movie script writing versus comic writing: Comics writing is not a great fit for visual control freaks, @TiniHoward says. #twcomicon
This is an industry that's about show, not tell, @manofmissle says. Portfolios matter more than specific degrees, he says. #twcomicon
"If you want to be a comic writer, if you want to be a comic artist, start making your work," @ErykDonovan says. #twcomicon

Where did Ribar come from? That's Sam Ellis, of course. #tinykeyboard
You have to learn to promote yourself and be positive about your work, @ianmcginty says. #twcomicon

"Work will win when washy-washy wishing won't," Sam Ribar says. #alliteration! #twcomicon
Don't give up. "If you want to be a writer or you want to be a comic creator, you do it," @ErykDonovan says. #twcomicon
"Comics is, like, kind of a long game," @TiniHoward says. You need patience and friends who know what you're going through. #twcomicon
"Just be nice to everybody," @ianmcginty says. (Sucking up to specific people doesn't work, he says.) #twcomicon
When trying to break into the comic industry, you're going to see the same people many times. Make friends, @ianmcginty says. #twcomicon
