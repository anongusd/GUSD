Per @scj #iagov #KeepIowaMoving 	Since Republicans took partial control of the Statehouse in 2011, K-12 funding increased each year other than the first year, resulting in nearly $713 million in new money, according to the state’s nonpartisan data agency.
Per @scj #iagov #KeepIowaMoving 	Total K-12 state funding per student, adjusted for inflation, increased 20.6 percent from 2008 to 2015 in Iowa, according to the Center on Budget and Priorities. Only three states ranked higher. 1/2
Per @scj #iagov #KeepIowaMoving 		At 2.5 percent, Iowa's unemployment rate in September was second-lowest in the country.		* At the end of the last fiscal year, Iowa's budget showed a surplus of $127 million, with more than $600 million in reserves.
Per @scj #iagov #KeepIowaMoving 	Iowa was ranked the nation's number one state for middle-class families by https://t.co/IP13Q0CWBN in December 2017. The study examined income, higher education and housing trends to determine its ranking.
Per @scj #KeepIowaMoving #iagov 	Iowa is the third best-managed state in the country, according to an analysis released in December 2017 by 24/7 Wall Street. The analysis cited Iowa’s low unemployment rate, state pension fund strength, AAA credit rating and low poverty rate.
