@TrueConstituti2 @apocrytwofish @tomsuperkat @Jim_Jordan Just like with a doctor. In network doctors are preferred based on their negotiated rates. It relieves administrative costs to save the consumer money and the insurance company processing of paperwork and claim submission.
@TrueConstituti2 @apocrytwofish @tomsuperkat @Jim_Jordan I'm going to assume the rates are higher with the insurance claims because of the administrative processes. With a cash customer it's just a check or credit card and you're on your merry way.
@TrueConstituti2 @apocrytwofish @tomsuperkat @Jim_Jordan I wouldn't say that's price gouging per se. I believe the auto body shops have pre-negotiated rates based on reputation and quality that they make with the insurance companies to speed up the claim process and work.
@TrueConstituti2 @apocrytwofish @tomsuperkat @Jim_Jordan I do not feel anyone has the right to a doctors services. I feel the market should set the prices. I don't believe doctors should be told how much to charge for their services. Healthcare is not in the Constitution, therefore I do not feel it should be regulated by the gov't.

@wmahoney5 @TheMarkPantano He should just declare a national emergency at the southern border and get the wall started and freeze immigration until reforms are made. Let the Dems talk impeachment and get the silent majority riled up for 2020. That's his bet avenue at this point.
@wmahoney5 @TheMarkPantano I don't think he's stupid enough to cave to the Democrats though. He won't reopen the government until a deal is make. The dems will never agree to anything if he reopens the government. Reagan was burned on amnesty (even though it was in his second term).
@wmahoney5 @TheMarkPantano He's got to get the wall started one way or another. If he doesn't he's going to lose some of his base and that will make 2020 difficult to win. He campaigned on the wall and immigration reform. If he doesn't make progress he's dead in the water. I agree with Ann Coulter on this.
@VildyViix @TheMarkPantano The time for being silent and polite has past. We must push back and be loud like they are. Where has it gotten us? Nowhere. They are the ones who demonize everyone and cheat to win elections. Time for us to get spine push back. Enough is enough!
