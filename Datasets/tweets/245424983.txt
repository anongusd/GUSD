I've never seen a district that produces good results for kids in an us versus them environment. Successful  labor-management partnerships like Meriden, the ABC District or UFT's new contract, are a prerequisite 4 every school to meet the needs of children and their educators
Teachers want what children need. And while strikes are always a last resort, they have become a vehicle to rebuild the power that had been chiseled away and to reorder priorities to put children first
In these last ten years, many of the states that have disinvested in public schools used privatization and demonization to protect their disinvestment and their tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy at the	expense of our schools and students
Bargaining is not about sitting in a circle singing kumbuya. It's about using power to solve problem. That only happens when both sides have power and there is a mutual respect and willingness to use power to solve problems

.@Navient claimed to be experts on student loan repayment plans, and profited off of the misinformation they gave to students and working families. They must be held responsible for their actions.
Since October 2018, even more evidence emerged showing the widespread impact of @Navient‚Äôs misconduct ‚Äì bad practices that injured AFT members &amp; millions of public employees. We had to amend the complaint accordingly. https://t.co/NhJmtRVmCt
In response, @Navient argued that they were not contractually obligated to provide advice to borrowers about loan repayment options. We argue that they do ‚Äì and their failure to do so has left thousands of public employees high and dry.
89.19% of public employees seeking #PSLF have been rejected since October 2017 ‚Äì and 72.46% of those applicants were denied for failing to meet ‚Äúprogram requirements,‚Äù stymied by servicers like @Navient.
After AFT members filed a suit against @Navient, they stopped claiming to be ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and actually removed language from their website. Public employees are using the power of the courts to expose bad loan servicers.
For years, @Navient claimed to provide ‚Äúexpert‚Äù guidance on student loan repayment &amp; forgiveness. Instead, they misled thousands of students &amp; their families on #PSLF eligibility &amp; repayment. That‚Äôs why AFT members are suing: to expose them in court &amp; hold them accountable.
