@IanGertler @Digital_Mary Ohh, I love this one. Great guiding light
@vincenzolandino @markboothe @AdobeExpCloud I think AI and machine learning will give us both. It is the ability to analysis real-time and historical data to serve up creative in real-time that these will lead to. That is what is exciting.
@jessibrawley @KDHungerford @AdobeExpCloud When people outside your norm connect with you, the result is usually awareness and growth.
@vincenzolandino @markboothe @AdobeExpCloud Yes, real-time can lead to relevance but it isn't a guarantee, same with personalization, it can get your attention but miss the timing like retargeted ads.
@IanGertler @Digital_Mary Love this list
@jessibrawley AI will drive personalization at scale to individuals but segments will divide themselves with data.

@markboothe @vincenzolandino @AdobeExpCloud I agree, this isn't going to happen by accident or from random siloed solutions.

@RachelTruair @vincenzolandino Yes this requires so many moving parts to come together but the juice is worth the squeeze.

@kevlindsay And there is the old fashioned talking to your customers :] easily forgotten form of data collection.
@AccordingtoFred If organizations treat customer data like customer money they will understand there must be an exchange of value.
@KDHungerford @AdobeExpCloud Yes nobody wants a technology only experience at least right now :]

@MLLNNLmotivator @AdobeExpCloud @Tesla @elonmusk Twitter chats are literally the embodiment of this concept. Real-time engagement
@ARoberts021 @AdobeExpCloud Yes, the statement that your front line employees are the brand is slowly coming true.
@lonistark Yes, we are ultimately loyal to ourselves and brands must align with that to have a relationship with us.
@MissDestructo @AdobeExpCloud Yep, the breadth of #CXM is larger than most organizations understand and it is why technology is needed to get a handle on it.
@The_ChrisBryant @vincenzolandino @Delta @dunkindonuts @Nike Nice brand co-op, I get into that in my post that launched minuets ago on the future of CX on https://t.co/LUljMhIyyA
@Clicktale True, and then the capability to create creative assets and deploy them in real-time. A high bar but an exciting one.
@markboothe @vincenzolandino @Delta @dunkindonuts @Nike Social listening is huge for brands because all the planning in the world can't create real-time context and relevance like social listening.
@AccordingtoFred Yes, culture and governance are key, culture first since without it, the rest won't matter.

@minicooper https://t.co/GpR07tCXgu
@KDHungerford You too Kelly! I hope you are enjoying a blessed day. We need to reconnect soon and catch up.
@minglesakachad @MTV Technology should facilitate real interactions not replace them. That is the issue we really face today. If brands refuse to be distanced from their customers they will thrive.
@MatthewAYoung Yeah if they started focusing on the other person (customer) instead of controlling messaging and conversations they would actually make a bigger impact in outcomes.

@jessibrawley @MubashsherSalim https://t.co/NhrHr1gGoh

@prsarahevans True, and brands have never been able to tap into their best customers to drive brand affinity until now. Social media is changing the game.

@MubashsherSalim @MeghanMBiro Love to hear your thoughts on this :]
@prsarahevans This shows how important it is to be fluid and authentic as an organization, it's hard to hide on the internet.
@SSPR @prsarahevans The data is huge for this. You can now find individuals that can impact your brand instead of groups.
@BrowerKDnB And I think the consumer is listening more on an individual basis which requires more nuance
@jessibrawley @MubashsherSalim Hey Jessi! I also think those relationships have gone from group to individual and Tech will keep pushing this.
@vincenzolandino @AdobeExpCloud Yeah, I think the lines between PR, CX, and Marketing have crossed over.
A1 Modern PR is no longer something that is easy to control, the complexity of sentiment has increased #Adobechat #PR
@minicooper Yeah plus competition for attention has grown in visibility by reducing the barrier of entry.
A1 PR is now more holistic, real-time, and the crowd can take your messaging and change context #Adobechat #PR

A3 If retail wants to do more than survive they need to push into experience instead of just convenience. #Adobechat #NRF2019 https://t.co/SrPiVRC4Qp
A3 Retail continues to slide back because they are trying to operate on old models. #Adobechat #NRF2019 https://t.co/XmOfxySv8K
A3 Retailers are continue to see disconnected shoppers with high expectations who often order online instead of buying. #Adobechat #NRF2019
@joeDmarti @AdobeInsights The key will be turning that pickup into brand experiences and even additional sales.
A2 Consumers expectations for convenience will continue to grow as that is the focus of most tech in retail. #Adobechat #NRF2019 https://t.co/qhpr5oQHpi
A2 Amazon has really changed the game in leading the way to what commerce can be. #Adobechat

@retailgeek @hootsuite @AdobeExpCloud I think it is more of a cultural tech issue, we are more fragmented in our adoption.
@RyBen3 I agree, and think about how many areas this affects beside just online/offline think social attribution, PR, etc
@retailgeek @mowenranger @AdobeExpCloud I agree it will be abused to a degree and it will be interesting to see how facial recognition will create and expose privacy issues.
@jjrzut Hey Jason!!, agreed and that incudes mobile distraction and disengagement with store POP and displays.
@AdamDavidLloyd @AdobeInsights https://t.co/A0rOENtiHv
@retailgeek @AdobeExpCloud @MubashsherSalim Oh snap, love this answer. Yes, there is a difference between tech that's novel and tech that is integrated and changing things.
A1 Artificial intelligence will continue to grow in use in the retail space in tools that drive personalization. #Adobechat
@itstamaragt @AdobeExpCloud Bam, we recently tried @Instacart and there is something special about picking everything and having it show up.
A1 IoT and sensors are a natural fit for retail bridging the real and digital world with data. #Adobechat #NRF2019 https://t.co/LD3mMGSOzo
@BarrettAll @AdobeExpCloud I haven't tried subscription stuff yet, but i'm not opposed. damn you cutting edge guy!
@RyBen3 This is a great observation, how many reatilers are doing anything to solve these problems outside the direct experience of shopping.
A1 Retail is being impacted by a bunch of technologies, big data, mobile, eCommerce, social media. #Adobechat #NRF2019

@MadalynSklar A7 The key is in the answer, you don't feel like you know them, you do. The people you take time to build a relationship with are the ones, also the people you meet IRL always move up the scale because you do know them. BTW #Skype works if you can't IRL.
@goiuby See we have to meet up! The key is not having an agenda when you meet IRL your agenda should be to get to know the person, whatever will happen will flow from there.

@SabrinaCadini @tweepi It's really good to both look at other audiences for research and even filter your own to gain insight.
A8 Fear not, Twitter is far from dead. It is still my favorite social platform and an absolute powerhouse for those who will learn to use it.  #TwitterSmarter
A8 I wrote a post about how I grew my Twitter to over 100,000 followers https://t.co/ycIx74UmOW  #TwitterSmarter https://t.co/6e4t4KbwX5
A8 Twitter success starts with optimizing your bio, knowing your target audience, curating content for them, and outreach every day. #TwitterSmarter
@ideabloke @DIYMarketers Agreed, broadcasting is of value, but it surely isn't the top value. That is one of the lessons I am utilizing with the work with #Skype I am doing right now https://t.co/0oXNxVrNuG
@FaithMonast Thanks Faith! Twitter is an amazing tool for learning. #twittersmarter
A7 Another tool I love for researching target audiences and analyzing followers is @Tweepi. The filters are awesome. #twittersmarter
A7 I also love @Buzzsumo for vetting data-driven content curation and research. Amazing tool! #twittersmarter
@MeetEdgar Superb! Settling in down here in Utah, loving the fall weather, kicking digital butt and taking names. #twittersmarter

@Popinard @MadalynSklar https://t.co/ElxuxNk6pV
@shruti12d Yes, Twitter allows you to connect, but then you have to build the relationship. #twittersmarter
@JoanaRSSousa @MadalynSklar Live audio is a an undiscovered treasure. https://t.co/2S6EOqUG7v
@goiuby @MadalynSklar aww snap! I agree.
@MeetEdgar @MadalynSklar True, and people should mix up the format, even small segments deserve greatness!
@FuhsionMktg Twitter lists both public and private are so good!
@B2the7 @MadalynSklar Yes, you have to use analytics to see what is working then test some more and try new things. Everyone has an optimized feed.
A6 Twitter is also a beast when it comes to relationship marketing. Top of mind awareness and real conversations are pillars of Twitter.  #TwitterSmarter
A6 Twitter is also the best audience growth engine for building a targeted audience. You can then push that audience to other platforms. #TwitterSmarter
A6 Twitter video is still very underused. It really brings the human connection. #twittersmarter
@BV_DigitalBuzz @MadalynSklar https://t.co/j5Jwk4de7e
@JBarbosaPR @Skype I'll do one better and lets get on a call.
A5 When big brands like #Skype use Twitter for social listening and top down engagement, they really set the bar high for agile customer-centric business. #TwitterSmarter
A5 Skype is integrating their executive team and product team into the conversations on Twitter and that creates an amazingly authentic experience for the #Skype customers. #TwitterSmarter
A5 I have done some work with #Skype recently and they are really nailing it with Twitter. #twittersmarter
@InfluencerTony @MadalynSklar This is so key to driving business benefit and naturally aligns with value for your audience.
@s_narmadhaa @GenePetrovLMC @MadalynSklar https://t.co/PVAC5NZU5x
@goiuby @MadalynSklar Way underutilized. I would say do at least one a day either as response, outreach, or content.
A4 Check out my post on Mastering Real-time content Curation https://t.co/PzbEjKn2G7 #ContentMarketing #TwitterSmarter https://t.co/TV2bPvlPJy
A4 There is no one type of content that works for all audiences, you have to test and look for patterns with your audience. #twittersmarter
A4 Twitter is a ‘time-sensitive’ platform. @Buzzsumo did some great research on what gets traction https://t.co/2LtwhYWPox #TwitterSmarter
@ChrisStrub Twitter is still my bae! #twittersmarter
@kununu_US @MadalynSklar When engagement meets relrevance you have a winner!
@JoanaRSSousa @MadalynSklar Yes doing all that in a handful of sentences is tough, this is why engagement makes up the rest.
@JoanaRSSousa @MadalynSklar https://t.co/qWwJesW9qv
A3 Get engaged, the more you engage, the more real your account becomes and the more people will engage with you. #twittersmarter
@Jake_pryszlak @alberMoire @MadalynSklar There is low quality one way overbroadcasting spam, and then just poorly targeted and selfish content.
A3 Consistency is the key, you literally have to BUILD your network, it isn’t going to just come to you. #twittersmarter
A3 To grow a strong following on Twitter you have to research and reach out to the right people. #twittersmarter
@alberMoire @MadalynSklar https://t.co/M9xNAUf4iI
@MeetEdgar True that! How are you? You guys have a great tool!
@B2the7 @MadalynSklar Thanks Bernie! what a tool that lets us all connect and share.
@ChrisStrub Chris what up buddy! #twittersmarter
@sdepolo Hey Stacey! How are you :] #twittersmarter
@PeculiarBeastie Yes, and Twitter chats really show the best of Twitter which is real-time engagement over topics.
A2 It is hard to get a better social listening tool than Twitter. It is a treasure trove of brand sentiment. #twittersmarter
@GenePetrovLMC @s_narmadhaa @MadalynSklar https://t.co/Wy7ugQOSxk
@scott_phillips_ Yes the news aspect is huge, I researched the most shared content on Twitter and it is news.
A2 Twitter is real-time so you can reach customers at specific moments that can convert to value and action. #twittersmarter
A2 Twitter has an awesome feed that can allow you to share more information without being spammy. #twittersmarter
@JBarbosaPR @MadalynSklar https://t.co/BOb9FrScvv
@s_narmadhaa @ExpWriters https://t.co/4pv8vL78jj
@JoanaRSSousa Google is notorious for killing it's own creations. I feel a pivot is better.
@s_narmadhaa  @amazon Ture, and the people gaining real value from a platform don't represent the total number. #twittersmarter
A1 There is this false narrative that if it isn't new it isn't relevant. Growth and newness is not the same as useful. #twittersmarter
@GenePetrovLMC @MadalynSklar True, but even growth is only one metric, there is actual value delivered and that is not just about growth.
@darcydeleon https://t.co/6TNxyIIdFI
A1 For people who declare a platform dead because it isn’t generating revenue, just take a look at @Amazon #twittersmarter
@JBarbosaPR @MadalynSklar  @Ross_Quintana Jan!! so glad you are here my friend :] #twittersmarter
A1 Platforms often have big money behind them and they pivot and gain huge relevance so you can’t count them out. #twittersmarter
A1 I just wrote a post about the life and death of platforms https://t.co/qZ0rvw0b5U #TwitterSmarter https://t.co/c2D7ZfTUrd
A1 First, is people have proclaimed the death of major platforms from Facebook to Twitter for a long time, and negative sentiment doesn’t equal platform death. #TwitterSmarter

A8 TV should be leading the way in AI driven personalization since it is inside our home, a very personal space. #AWNewYork #awchat
@SueDuris @advertisingweek This is a huge one, they can't think of TV as an island anymore. The king is now just a cog in the machine.
@IanGertler @advertisingweek True, like all advertising you have to understand what the channel does well and if that lines up with your goals then execute against that.
@markboothe @SueDuris @joeDmarti @coryedwards @danielnewmanUV @leeodden @BrennerMichael @jesperlaursen @samfonoimoana @mowenranger Impressions serve a purpose, but they aren't the purpose.
@SueDuris True, I think for now understanding the programming is more key than demographics to reach a deeper level of psychographics
@SueDuris @AdobeAdCloud Hey Sue!!  #awchat
@markboothe @cjablonski @advertisingweek @AdobeAdCloud True, but they also need to innovate to push TV's value. #awchat
@SueDuris I think personalization should come from the TV interface, we aren't there yet. #awchat
A6 It is a broad digital landscape and OTT like all content must be strategic to produce a value driven experience. #AWNewYork #awchat
A5 Broadcast advertising isn't dead because of broad audiences, they just need to understand the viewer's context. #AWNewYork #awchat
A4 The dance of attribution and data-driven advertising is still fuzzy for many organizations but analytics solves this #AWNewYork #awchat
A3 Large broadcasters have to recognize that the walled-garden approach can be beat by a data-driven marketplace. #AWNewYork #awchat
A2 The fact that TV consumption is not mobile is an attention advantage if you know how to use it. #AWNewYork #awchat
A1 TV advertising like any advertising channel is only dead if you can't see the new opportunities. #AWNewYork #awchat

@MarcD_Weegem @Steven_Abrahams @Danyoutohell @gamesbymanuel It's  unconventional to think a program should not update when loaded if needed but when you open it for a business call it is the worst time. Familiarity and reliability is key as well as timing so an update before creates frustration. Either offer to postpone or update after.
@MarcD_Weegem @Steven_Abrahams @Danyoutohell @gamesbymanuel I think you nailed an important sentiment right there Marc and also the post call update is a great idea too.

@peterskillman @om @Skype As a brand strategist, consumer, and lover of technology, I am way less critical on companies who are trying to give you a better product, then listen to adjust, then companies who don't care. Plus how many amazing connections and calls have people had on Skype, let's be positive
@mattyroze @MarshaCollier @markboothe @annhandley @MarketingProfs @leeodden @CTrappe @crestodina @joeDmarti @KerryGorgone @coryedwards @iSocialFanz Imagine having an actual conversation with the customer, digitizing value delivery is a long and awkward road.
@joeDmarti @markboothe @annhandley @MarketingProfs @leeodden @CTrappe @crestodina @KerryGorgone @coryedwards @mattyroze @iSocialFanz And I would add bringing content closer to customer and brand engagement and relationship is a whole other level that will lead to long-horizon revenues.
@markboothe @annhandley @MarketingProfs @leeodden @CTrappe @crestodina @joeDmarti @KerryGorgone @coryedwards @mattyroze @iSocialFanz There are tools, but the high bar of deep understanding with easy interface that almost takes you in the mind of the consumer of content and various markets. Well, it's a bridge to real relationships at scale.
@om @gruber The built-in community and exposure is a big plus for people who have no audience. That being said I would write on both, I have my own blog and also one on Medium and I strategically use it for variety and exposure.
@om Great write up @OM, you bring up some valid points and I appreciate your walking through the path of @skype. As a huge consumer advocate, I agree the users are always the key. I have countless great memories of using Skype and I know they will fine tune it, they're listening.
