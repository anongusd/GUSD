"Now you have a president who is standing up FOR America" @realDonaldTrump #CPAC. He has ditched the American Carnage talk and is talking up a positive vision of the future. An interesting and unacknowledged shift that will work to his benefit I suspect.
At #CPAC2019, @realDonaldTrump did more voices in his speech than Robin Williams did in Disney's Aladdin. I say this in purely descriptive terms: He has become @HowardStern or Don Rickles or Chris Rock, a standup struggling to get out of a politician's body.

Yes, post-fact and there's no question that Trump speaks this language fluently but it is growing within the progressive movement as well. https://t.co/xQFBwqxprh
At #CPAC @realDonaldTrump is pivoting hard to a skills-based immigration program, repeatedly saying we need *more* immigrants, but "they are NOT sending us their best" and we are supporting immigrants "for their entire lives" (which is not true).
.@realDonaldTrump is wrong to suggest at #CPAC that just 3 percent of immigrants show up for judicial hearings. The vast majority show up even when the odds are stacked against them receiving asylum or refugee status https://t.co/R9BJuPRx64
"We're very concerned about setting precedent" @realdonaltrump mocks fears of his emergency declaration. Says he's concerned with drug dealers and murderers and drugs entering the country. If you're worried about Dems, make sure they don't get elected. #CPAC
.@realDonaldTrump now saying that members of caravans are drug dealers, killers, rapists, etc. "Sad to see how stupid we've become" he says, to believe caravans are filled with good people. Echoes his original awful (and wrong statement) about Mexicans in 2015. #CPAC
It is also one of his most successful performances in a post-fact political world. Trump is seamlessly moving from topic to topic, using (often) very funny jibes at his opponents and himself to move things forward. It's like an old @HowardStern show. https://t.co/xXO5w2m1Zk
