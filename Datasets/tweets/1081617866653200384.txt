@itsnoraj @123arnie @joeymattadahtz @netteKnows @RealJamesWoods The only people that i know that have ever seemed willing to violently fight are those who truly feel as if they (or their family members) backs are against a wall (and that has seemed to cut across virtually all racial, ethnic and economic lines {at various times}).
@DinytDiane @netteKnows @RealJamesWoods Californians will get the worst of it (because we New Englanders can't be deceived in to seeing past our relative poverty to pity the approaching armies of illegal alien invaders displacing us).
@RealJamesWoods @SarahSnow2012 That's why the sane people among us are attempting to stop the illegal alien invasions (and probable {provoked angry Citizens} uprisings) now (because we don't want to see any more racial, ethnic or economic wars here {in the U.S.A.}).
@marklutchman @SarahSnow2012 She just doesn't really comprehend how it really is out here (on these streets).

@silverburst1 @RealJamesWoods i fear (and i {like to believe that i} a'void) levying punishments that can not be reversed.
@RealJamesWoods Society can afford to refuse the contributions of convicted murderers.		Rehabilitation should be offered only through the magnanimity of the people (with in which) the offense was perpertrated (and not as a "right" of the offender).
@THEANTHEMGIRL @Rich_Kruse Thats why Aristotle was a University Professor (and not a soldier).

@RepMarkGreen @FoxNewsOpinion Californians will not secure their own States border (so the idea that they would ever attempt to secure any other States border is absurd).

@rep_stevewomack The obvious solution is to (simply) make all of the antiTrumpians walk the plank.
@newtgingrich Allowing a Crazifornian (particularly {a maniacally antiAmerican Crazifornian, such as} Nancy Pelosi) to influence our nations immigration policies is as absurdly ir-responsible as allowing Tony Montana to set the tone for our nations (illegal) drug importation policies.

@BreitbartNews National Security should be every ones top priority.
