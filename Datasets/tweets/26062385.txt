It makes sense to give the American people a more direct say in this critical decision.
We should put off a decision on Justice Scalia's replacement until the newly-elected president can make his or her choice. 1/2
If the next president is not a member of my party, I will take the same objective non-partisan approach that I always have. 2/2
This decision should not be rushed, and it should not be made amid the clamoring of a presidential election season.
Less than 72 hours since Justice Scalia's passing. There has already been too much politicking around the issue of his replacement.
Happy #Presidentsday! https://t.co/GSuTBhTlDa

Absent presidential leadership, Congress must step up and pass strong sanctions on #Iran. I will pursue every option to do so.
