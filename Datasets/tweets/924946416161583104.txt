@Sim5225 @Alyssa_Milano Perhaps I can earn your trust with time. Meanwhile, I'll try to earn your respect - by proving myself a warrior for millions of forgotten Americans who suffer in silence. Although many don't vote, and none can afford to contribute a dime to some campaign, I'm doing this for them.
@krassenstein We must be careful to wield that power more judiciously than Ryan, McConnell and their flunkies. Americans don't want more bullies. They want an end to the chaos and divisive rhetoric of 2017.

@TrueFactsStated @FayrouzSaad @dancanon @samjammal @JoshButnerCA50 @AndyThorburnCA @AndyKimNJ @HoulahanForPa @SeanCasten @farmer4ozarks @TomPrigg2018 Thank you, Claude. When I was working on Capitol Hill in the 1980s, we used to go to the basement of Rayburn House Office Building, take off our dress shoes and run as fast as possible b4 sliding down the long marble corridors. Think I should bring that back when we win in Nov?

@BeauWillimon Happy New Year Mr. Willimon, Anything you can do to promote my CrowdPac fundraising campaign (link previously sent) would be greatly appreciated.

@Mopshell @TrueFactsStated I will certainly do so. And a million humble thanks for helping us in Florida's Second Congressional District. We are under siege by Ryan, McConnell and their self-important GOP functionary representing us in Washington, DC.
@TrueFactsStated Will you please help me too?
#Congress needs a hard reboot in 2018! If elected, I'll govern according to three principles: 1) Consider the views of ALL people 2) Insist that bills are put to a vote after input from ALL parties and 3) Vote in the best interests of ALL of my constituents and the entire nation.

@DrNealDunnFL2 Nothing hi-lites the GOP's priorities more than the fact that individual tax breaks expire in 2027 while business cuts exist forever. You and the rest of the Republican Congress are captives of the lobbyists. In 2018, we will return Congress to the people. https://t.co/VLkkYBsqtf

Is it an "entitlement" if I earned it and was ordered to surrender it on the promise that it would be returned to me and my fellow citizens? I suppose I am ENTITLED to my own money, just like I'm ENTITLED to expect my elected officials to live up to their promise of returning it.

@k9luna @IndivisibleNWFL @mattgaetz @marcorubio @DrNealDunnFL2 If the truth be told, it is highly doubtful that any of the 1% who benefit from the GOP tax reform bill actually live in our district. This bill was created, in secret, by lobbyists, to benefit non-constituents. It's so full of good ideas that no hearings were held to discuss it.
