At least some of the appeal of "integralism" to younger Catholics reflects an accurate sense that a distinctive Catholic social-political message has, well, dis-integrated under the pressures of left-right polarization in secular politics.
The American and European pattern is obvious, but here is a similar case study from Brazil: https://t.co/EQrxw0SkK3
The difficulty is that the decline of the "Catholic party" approach to politics has mostly led to polarization instead of polyphony, with divisions in the church's internal life increasingly tracking the polarization of the wider political culture:	https://t.co/XOdaW0jADO

@baseballcrank @ThePlumLineGS @yeselson @xpostfactoid @mattyglesias Right. It's not that conservative activists wouldn't have opposed Medicaid expansion; it's that the sweep of Obamacare (larger in conception than outcome) enabled those activists to grab support in the conflicted center, putting them in position to effectively resist.
@dandrezner If you're primarily worried about Trump-as-threat-to-the-constitution, as opposed to just Trump as bad/reckless POTUS, the loss of the House + his deep unpopularity matters more than his WH appointments.
@dandrezner The constitutional order assumes that president will control the executive branch.

@baseballcrank @yeselson @mattyglesias That was Rahm Emanuel's correct take.

@BenjySarlin I'm open to the anti-anti-Schultz argument but good grief that's a bad take.
@DamonLinker Nor does it preclude a belief that a late-term abortion ban is a clear moral advance, however incomplete.
@DamonLinker Fair enough. Nonetheless, that analogy aside, the deontological argument does not preclude particular horror at particular forms of suffering.
@DamonLinker I know, I'm just saying that a belief that all abortion is a *form* of murder doesn't preclude a belief that some forms are worse, any more than ethical vegetarians can't be especially outraged by factory farms.
@DamonLinker Why do "meat is murder" people highlight factory farms? Because they're trying to awaken consciences by showing cruelty that even waffling moderates can recognize.
@DamonLinker Late-term abortion is arguably crueler, given sensory development, and if you're trying to awaken consciences why wouldn't you highlight the cruelest cases?

If your *journalistic* instinct seeing, let's say, the undercover Planned Parenthood videos is "these must be selectively edited" but yr journalistic instinct seeing the 1st Covington video is "here's the true face of hateful whiteness," then you aren't a good gatekeeper. Period.
There's a case for a mainstream media that handles viral outrages with caution and patience, and that frames debates in terms of "partisans say X" rather than just running with "X." But not for a media that only practices caution for outrages that stir up social conservatives.
... and then finally to write news stories framed as stories about "conservative backlash." The only place where there was a viral freakout was pro-life Twitter. Which tells you something, I think, about the resilience of institutional bias even in the age of social media.
Yet somehow the same kind of mainstream (not left-wing) journalists and editors who were commissioning thinkpieces about white supremacy within an hour of the Covington video managed to control themselves, to resist tweeting the story, to hang back, to ask for context ...
Here you have videos of Democratic politicians making at least seemingly shocking statements on a controversial issue where their party is *way* on the wrong side of public opinion. The kind of thing ripe for virality. The kind of thing that Twitter by its nature tends to amp up.

There's an argument that America is the paradigmatic Enlightenment society because relative to less-Enlightened Catholic New Spain some of our moral achievements were greater, and so were some of our crimes.
A certain style of Enlightenment thought took older Christian moral analysis and said "why can't we implement this more fully here and now, instead of tolerating so many for-the-time-being evils?" Abolitionism was a case where this worked. Communism was a case where it didn't.
Someday I'm going to actually deliver a long Enlightenment #hottake, hopefully. One boring placeholder thought is that the immanentize-the-eschaton aspect of Enlightenment thought gets you bigger moral successes *and* bigger moral disasters.

Just running as a pro-business deficit hawk in a normal polarized election would get a self-funded "centrist" candidate at most 2-3 percent of the vote. But running as the guy who isn't Trump and also doesn't want to eliminate private health insurance is a somewhat bigger lane.
@jonathanchait @NateSilver538 Running an avowed socialist on the Democratic line would put this thesis to an interesting test.

Okay, that's all, just getting it off my chest. Also, condolences to the Missouri board of tourism on the last couple years of showbiz treatments of their state.
It's fine to exoticize your flyover setting, but it's better if you fully commit, a la the bayou rot of True Detective Season 1. The townies in "Sharp Objects" just seem like they're living in a different town -- a Charlotte exurb? -- than the southern-gothic central family.
Sometimes Wind Gap seems like rural meth country; sometimes it seems like the Charlotte suburbs. The show jams a bunch of New South stereotypes into a rural-decline setting, which surrounds a (very effective) rotting Old South central mystery.
Yet somehow almost everyone we meet, save for a few encounters with the wrong-side-of-the-tracks types, seems to belong to some sort of SUV-driving, mcmansion-living, wine-swilling upper-middle-class. Where are these people working? Where is their money coming from?
Wind Gap is supposed to be rural, isolated, a one-industry town fallen on hard times. There's one bar, everyone buys their liquor from the same convenience store, the only employer is the hog slaughterhouse owned by a single family, which mostly employs illegal aliens.
Riveting: Everything that happens inside the family domicile. (Patricia Clarkson = amazing.) Annoying: Everything that happens in the town of Wind Gap, which is next door to Ebbing on the map of Middle American Towns As Imagined By Europeans Who Have Never Visited Them.
Finished watching "Sharp Objects." Rare for a show to be so riveting and so annoying at the same time.

The pro-life movement needs a two-track policy: Supporting judges who will allow state abortion restrictions *and* working to separate the issue somewhat from locked-in, mobilized partisanship. Always hard to manage both, but impossible if the movement wears a MAGA hat.

@zackbeauchamp The rise and decline of Perot, whose populism is nationalistic but less racially-charged than Buchanan's, is also a complicating case study.
@zackbeauchamp And fact that Buchanan surges in '92 and '96 and then goes nowhere as a third party candidate 2000 is also indicative of how populist appeal can be muted or amplified by economic and social conditions.
@zackbeauchamp I think the refugee crisis is a huge factor; I just think it falls under elite- misgovernment intersecting with anti-minority sentiment, not the latter alone. (Also connected to failures of US ME policy!)

Reasonable people can differ, but in my view of the American case, excluding the financial crisis and the Iraq War from the narrative of how the GOP + the country elected Trump requires attributing too much absolute power to anti-Obama backlash and the internet/Putin/etc.
Right-wing populism correlates with anti-minority sentiment, no question. But why does the quarantine fails in certain moments and not others? Why is Jeb's fate different from Dubya's? Why does Trump win and not Buchanan? Why are Euro-populists more successful in 2016 than 1996?
Also a quick response to @zackbeauchamp; one reason that I, at least, persist in talking about more than *just* anti-minority sentiment as a driver of populism is that the academic lit doesn't adequately explain populism's varying salience/influence:	https://t.co/g9FWYSZ8vb

@JZmirak @TuckerCarlson A little odd to cite Allan Carlson in a brief *against* conservative paternalism!
@JZmirak @allahpundit @EWErickson And if illegal immigration were at 1990s levels the country would be on track to become California. Shifts in the last ten years mean we're probably not, and to the extent we are it isn't illegal border crossings doing it.
@JZmirak @allahpundit @EWErickson Border security was in crisis twenty years ago; now it's just not. Doesn't mean it can't be improved, but the back-to-the-wall attitude makes no sense.	https://t.co/77rOjJhMWW
@JZmirak @allahpundit @EWErickson "The game" is never over; that's not how politics works. At the current moment, based on apprehensions/trends in illegal population, additional fencing will have a minimal impact on low-skilled immigration; more meaningful battles are elsewhere.
@JZmirak @allahpundit @EWErickson There's no evidence in current migration rates -- which have been reduced, yes, by walls -- that the situation is in any way that desperate for the GOP. Border security seems in decent shape; E-Verify the more plausible necessity for restrictionists.
@JZmirak @allahpundit @EWErickson @POTUS A couple hundred miles of fence whose construction is tied up in the courts will prevent him from being the last GOP president of our lifetime?
@JZmirak @allahpundit @EWErickson The difference is that when progressives abuse emergency declarations they'll actually get something real for their efforts.

@EsotericCD @jbarro He's the co-sponsor of the best Democratic child tax credit proposal, so you're totally wrong.
@Vermeullarmine @smithpatrick08 @Chateaubriand__ This may be true in theory but it seems doubtful in practice.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ I'm not saying the official theology is magisterial teaching, just that it's the official theology.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ If I may borrow from the well-known website the Josias, I can say with a straight face that the "official theology" of the present church has abandoned those teachings, yes. That the papacy still makes political exhortations is not really counter-evidence.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ Given that most of the present leadership of Mother Church believes those teachings have already been abandoned, turning back the clock to ralliement-in-conditions-of-pluralism seems like a possible step toward coherence, not away.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ Why can't it just take the Longinqua/ralliement view of the near-term exigencies of pluralism?
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ Hazony's implication here that you could have state establishments of religion under a more "conservative" version of our republic raises a lot of questions on that front:	https://t.co/iPC1Jg0ybN
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ The key question here is definitely whether religions can share power without the canopy of liberalism.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ Also I think the argument would be that you could have a Protestant-Catholic-Jew republic *without* the Murrayan view that liberalism and Catholicism can embrace.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine @Chateaubriand__ Well, the integralist is also defending a regime that fell apart spectacularly, and never existed on these shores.
@Vermeullarmine @smithpatrick08 @Chateaubriand__ Right, but the sympathetic Catholic gloss on Hazony could be that there sort of was an "Illiberal Protestant-Catholic-Jew America" that &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Liberal America and has clearer political prospects in the near future than the Most Catholic Union of North America.
@allahpundit Can the empress be that much of a genius? I’m not sure we’re prepared for that.
@smithpatrick08 The "misguided, nostalgic" is there for a reason. At the same time ...
@Vermeullarmine @1renist I guess I would say that the WASP episcopacy itself was less permeable but the society it presided over, much more so. But this deserves longer treatment.
And circa 1935-55 that lost world seemed extremely susceptible (to the anxiety of certain Protestants) to what @Vermeullarmine nowadays dubs "integration from within."
One answer is that, however misguided or nostalgic the impulse, American Catholics live in a country where their church seemed to flourish more abundantly in the latter days of this establishment than it has since its collapse.	https://t.co/D3VPSYd2ZS

@jeffspross I think it's compatible to see certain WASP virtues and recognize forcing mechanisms of popular movements.
@jeffspross I think that's fair. But pre-Depression reform movements also featured a lot of action from "above" as well as below.
@jeffspross (spitballing a little here)
@jeffspross And success of working class movements in forcing mid-century egalitarianism is linked to more aristocratic model that assumes class cooperation as a possible goal or good, as opposed to meritocratic chimera of permanent social mobility for everyone.
@jeffspross Then WASPs are seduced by the idea that they need to become technocrats and proceed to dissolve themselves while letting their smartest children give us urban "renewal," Vietnam, etc.
@jeffspross Counterpoint: Last WASP peak gets us through Great Depression w/o fascist or Communist dictatorship, followed by victory in WWII, followed by successful push toward Civil Rights Act (supported by WASP wing of GOP).
@SohrabAhmari @weeklystandard Also the tallest.
Someone is watching "Avatar" on my flight and its mere existence is so strange.
Also there's a case that despite the academic appeal of pantheism, the vogue for woke witchcraft etc., the left's egalitarian commitments are actually a stronger bulwark against full de-Christianization than what might conceivably happen on the right.
And if institutional Christianity weakens further we should expect pagan formations at both ends of the political spectrum, and sure enough:	https://t.co/hbHea0iadQ
... creating space for a post-WWII Christian revival, which then itself dissolves in the '60s as the counterculture opens space for pagan ideas again, this time more on the cultural "left" but not exclusively so.
One possible read of modern religious history is that there is a wave of re-paganization in European culture that reaches a crescendo in right-wing politics in the 1930s and then subsequently dissolves amid horror at the Third Reich ...

@BenjySarlin @EsotericCD @michaelbd There is a reason why my column explicitly stated that the WASPs dissolved themselves, embracing meritocracy and boomerism, not that they were just somehow ethnically replaces.
@BenjySarlin Also depends on the state of the economy; a recession makes populism a more plausible play than a boom.

@EricaGrieder And Congregationalists and Northern Baptists.
@EricaGrieder ? The column repeatedly emphasizes high-Protestant piety.
(That analysis has applications beyond the WASPs of course.)
Best counterargument to the pro-WASP establishment take is that certain WASP virtues only really dated to the Great Depression and were doomed by temptations of mass affluence no matter what.
@mckaycoppins @chrislhayes Self-hatred is a helluva drug.
@irin Which is a good example of why WASPness is not coterminous with whiteness ...
@DKThomp America's Catholic *intellectuals* have shifted in this direction, to be clear. Just hard to see how it cashes out in politics.

This admonition applies to WASPs and meritocrats alike.
We have carved out a greater measure of control, but we are still the ruled, not the rulers -- hostages to fortune, not masters of our fate. Which is why the old religions still seem relevant to a lot of people -- because the world is a little kinder, but we are not its gods.
The claim that we are better off than people in the Maccabean era is true and important. But the claim that we have *escaped* a baseline where caprice and/or providence are ruling forces is both strange and tiresome.
I belong to a privileged class. I'm in my late 30s. My inner circle in the last 5-10 years has featured deaths from cancer, several debilitating and mysterious chronic illnesses, descents into alcoholism and addiction, a sudden death from the Powassan virus (google it), and more.
We have more mastery over nature than in the past, more comforts and more years of life, but the claim that "we no longer live by the caprice of God and nature" is just whistling past the graveyard.
I understand, in an era of anxiety, the Pinker-ish desire to point out the ways we've never had it so good. What I don't understand is the tendency to act like improvement = transcendence, as if we've actually slipped free of our ancestors' ruled-by-nature condition entirely.

@mikiebarb Congrats from all of us at The Argument on your successful niche podcast!
@herandrews Maybe Nichols would think what he does regardless. But it simplifies the permission structure for writing his targets off.
Not sure that's any clearer than the initial tweet, but those are the thoughts behind it. Also Europe might be different. (cc: Emmanuel Macron)
"...today’s class war will come to an end when the managerial minority, with its near-monopoly of wealth, political power, expertise, and media influence, completely and successfully represses the numerically greater but politically weaker working-class majority."
Combine those two things -- conservative populism's inability to win enough minority support to govern, and the delenda-est backlash it prompts among meritocrats -- and you get the path to the Michael Lind endgame wherein ...
So instead of populism prompting an elite rethink, it prompts an elite "Carthago delenda est" mentality that dismisses everything from opioid addiction to joblessness to unemployment as just the *fault* of the racist, blinkered WWC.
But the other, less obvious issue is that the way conservative populism often intertwines w/white-identitarian impulses gives a certain kind of non-populist -- @RadioFreeTom being the example here -- a strong reason/excuse to declare "no quarter" against the populists.
You can see this problem in Trump's occasional flails toward black and Hispanic voters, which are actually plausible moves ... were they not also linked to a politician who built his brand on birtherism etc.
First, most obviously, racial divisions in American life tend to link conservative populism with white-identitarian politics, which cuts it off politically from the black and Hispanic population that might share its outsider v. insider, country party vs. court party view.
One could extend a version of that analysis to the prospects for a successful as opposed to evanescent American conservative populism as well, in two related ways.
One of the (plausible) cliches of left discourse is that racism + racial divisions make it hard to build a united working class front in America, bc the capitalist class can use racial bias + suspicion to divide and conquer.

@michaelbd @austeni @SSawyerSJ @jdflynn A reform that looks for ways to put more women in leadership roles seems to me to fall more into the former category; a reform that looks for ways to blur rules on divorce, the latter.
@michaelbd @austeni @SSawyerSJ @jdflynn One possible way of thinking about adaptation: Are you adapting to something in the wider society that the church thinks is good, or that it thinks is bad?
@willmenaker It's easy if you try.
@austeni The fear is not universality per se but a universal solution that deliberately doesn't address a lot of the problems, because at least some ppl in Rome don't see, e.g,. bishops with lovers as a big problem.
@austeni 3. Finally arguments from figures like Fr/ Martin that gay priests should go public w/their orientation, and the (seeming) indifference of (some) liberals to priestly chastity when it's just consenting adults, are likewise seen as pointing toward a Gene Robinsonian destination.
@austeni 2. On the specific issue of the sex abuse scandal, calls for the church to consider married priests and female ordination are often couched as responses to the scandal -- and they are seen by conservatives as embodying a more Episcopalian vision of the priesthood.
@austeni 1. In the broad sense, as you know, conservatives fear that the logic of the Amoris debate/"synodality"/etc. points toward a latitudinarian papacy and national churches evolving away from one another on contested moral/doctrinal points.
@austeni Yes, another sign of impasse is the inability to even understand the other side's anxieties.

I'm not predicting this will happen, to be clear; it just seems like the most plausible way that you might get some real (esp. elite) cultural recoil against porn absent a major religious revival.
That is, porn's addictive/desensitizing/alienating qualities could be seen as more extreme versions of larger problems with social media + internet use, and attacked as part of a broader attempt to limit those techs place in (esp.) young people's lives:	https://t.co/Ylgx4fDPjT
Second while I think stronger online censorship is a lot more plausible than people seem to think, in practice I think any turn against porn at this point is likely to be conjoined to a turn against the internet/devices generally, esp. for the young.
That left porn critics in the same position as the Savage facing Mustapha Mond -- making an argument about vice and dehumanization to a society that didn't care so long as the harm couldn't be measured and the vice seemed to have, if anything, a stabilizing effect.
First, I think that almost as crucial as the internet was the post-1980s decline in rape and sexual violence, which undercut the most obvious "harm" argument that porn critics (feminists as well as socons) had offered in their brief for censorship.

@OrrChris I’m saying that the logic of the liberal critique of US institutions points to the need for a revolutionary presidency, a la Wilson or FDR if not more so. Doesn’t mean Dem voters will want/find such a figure.

I don't think Dems will want "their Trump" in 2020. But eventually ...? Maybe, only insofar as a "change *all* the institutions" liberalism would ultimately require a new liberal strongman to make it happen, an imperial president on a scale we haven't seen since FDR (if ever).
Does the edge get taken off, so that it becomes a pundit's theme but not a major part of actual liberal politics? Or does it boil over when the Democrats have power again but liberals find themselves balked by, say, the caution of their small-state/red-state senators?

@Vermeullarmine @thomaspink1 That’s helpful, thank you.
@Vermeullarmine @thomaspink1 Right, but people critiquing Amoris/the rhetoric of the Francis era would say the same! I'm just trying to understand how to reconcile favoring the Josias project, which effectively critiques *all* modern popes, and finding critiques of Francis un-Catholic, as you seem to (?)
@Vermeullarmine @thomaspink1 I'm just interested in whether you find that claim as tacitly anti-papalist as the narrower critiques of Amoris Laetitia (which Pink seems to basically endorse, while citing them as examples of a larger problem), and if not what you see as the distinction.
@Vermeullarmine @thomaspink1 Right, his argument is that the church and her popes have been effectively teaching error via those non-magisterial official statements for going on fifty years.
@Vermeullarmine @thomaspink1 I'm just curious how that (interesting) move on his part fits into your interpretation of the proper deference to papal teaching.
@Vermeullarmine @thomaspink1 There isn't one; there's just the weight of general papal/Vatican rhetoric for the last 50-60 years. That's why he proposes the "official theology" sub-category of teaching, and accepts that he's arguing against the present official theology of the church.
@Vermeullarmine I've been wondering what you think of Thomas Pink's Josias essays.

I would probably be against a *lay* cardinal. But elevating nuns or abbesses to the college seems like an idea entirely worth considering.
Second, on this quote: Pope Francis “would have everyone against him” if he named a female cardinal, Scaraffia said. “Everyone.” I don't think this is true, maybe too solipsistically, because depending on how it happened *I* wouldn't be against it.
First, the piece writes that Francis has "alarmed conservative clerics by suggesting that people who are divorced, and women who have had abortions, might be welcomed back to take communion." I understand the use of shorthand, but this is still extremely incorrect.

@Vermeullarmine Certainly but then one's public judgment and the new structure it defers to would both be reasonably described as ... liberal.
@Vermeullarmine I think the federalization of the magisterium, like the latitudinarianism inherent in the Anglian settlement (such as it was), necessarily implies the liberty of thought that you say that you reject.
@Vermeullarmine And the fact that the liberalizers may still intend to fully anathematize conservatives in the endgame is, of course, exactly how a Vermeulian analysis of liberalism in politics would expect this process to proceed.
@Vermeullarmine So I don't know that you can draw a distinction between the two forms of liberalism within the church when they are so often intertwined. The Anglicanization of Catholicism is a liberalization in both senses, surely.
@Vermeullarmine Thanks for this. I think one difficulty with the distinguo you propose is that the mechanism used to "loosen" and "reinterpret" those "traditional strictures," in this pontificate and generally in liberal Catholicism, *is* the promotion of a greater liberty of doctrinal thought.
@ericzadro Ah, yeah. Thanks.
@semiduplex @ericzadro @gjpappin Which Feser piece is this?
And to concede the possibility of a liberal pope (and I know @semiduplex is not conceding that Francis is a liberal, and I quite agree that on some fronts he is not) is to concede that Newman's approach could enter into a crisis, which appeals to Newman alone cannot resolve.
So being a vehement illiberal in such circumstances while declining to ever explicitly criticize the pope would be just baby-splitting, not the kind of obedience that Newman counsels in that extract.
If a pope can indeed *be* a theological liberal, or even just a liberalizer, then Newman's admonition to "look at his formal deeds, and to follow him whither he goeth" seems to imply that a Catholic in such circumstances should become a liberal or at least a liberalizer as well.
(Sorry the @Vermeullarmine approach that is.)
Specifically if the author believes that it's even possible for "liberal" popes to alternate with non-liberal popes that creates some *deep* tensions for reconciling the two Newman quotations that the @avermeule approach does not resolve.
Elsewhere in Catholic discussions, this is a characteristically intelligent @semiduplex piece on the "Catholic illiberals and Francis"/@avermeule v. @roddreher discussion that still, I think, shies away from the hardest Qs a little at the end:	https://t.co/MENLMADOIC

The convergence of doctrinal conflict and the sex abuse crisis are making it harder than ever to get the full picture on the latter -- and esp. the way that predation "found a way" in both liberal and conservative contexts, by exploiting very different theological approaches.

@holysmoke Who's the jury, though?
@GibsonWrites This seems like pretty normal whistleblower psychology to me.
That's my reading of the landscape, at least. cc: @MassimoFaggioli et al.
The Vigano intervention is best understood as an attempt by the small active opposition to spur the large passive opposition to some sort of dramatic action. Having no sense of what form that action should take, the passive opposition has done nothing.
Both oppositions have strong American elements; neither is nearly as exclusively American as their critics like to imply. Archbishop Chaput pretty clearly belongs to the larger, more passive group but his "leadership" is overstated not least because there's nothing to "lead."
The passive opposition is much larger, including many JPII + BXVI-appointed bishops and cardinals. It is deeply concerned about the Francis pontificate, resists parts of the traditionalist prescription and most traditionalist rhetoric, and has no idea what to do instead.
The active opposition is small and mostly traditionalist. Its episcopal leaders are Cardinal Burke, the Kazakh bishops, and now Archbishop Vigano. It has a strong internet presence, a relatively clear agenda, a forthright-to-a-fault critique.
The truth is that @MassimoFaggioli is conflating two different forms -- one active and at least somewhat organized, one passive and divided and confused -- that opposition takes.
There are a lot of words I might use to describe conservative-Catholic opposition to Pope Francis, but "well organized" would not be one of them.	https://t.co/d5K0fm3LkR

@Vermeullarmine @smithpatrick08 I don't posit bad faith. I'm trying to draw you out into a fuller defense of your claims because I think that you are not engaging sufficiently with the situation in the church.
@Vermeullarmine @smithpatrick08 The arguments are technically compatible but the second is used to avoid serious engagement on the first.
@Vermeullarmine @smithpatrick08 Not a classic M&amp;B but it has the same effect. 	Motte: The pope is a conservative because he criticizes abortion.	Rejoinder: Er, but Francis has advanced liberal personnel and positions pretty consistently throughout his pontificate ...	Bailey: It's liberalism to criticize a pope.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine And while a synthesis is certainly possible, in practice it's more of a motte-and-bailey approach.
@austeni "To change the church ..." has a certain ring to it.
@smithpatrick08 @Vermeullarmine All I am suggesting is that Professor Vermeule's interventions on the subject fall into one of those two buckets.
@smithpatrick08 That would be a possible synthesis of the two, yes.
@smithpatrick08 So when you figure it out let me know.
@smithpatrick08 I am honestly unsure whether the other side of the beef holds that "Francis is an orthodox pope misrepresented by hysterical trads and the liberal press" or "Francis may be a tacit modernist but it is unfilial and impious and worst of all, American to admit the obvious."

@mattyglesias @yeselson If you followed the intricacies of Catholic Twitter, Matthew, you would know that Vermeule and I are engaged in a low-grade, low-stakes war of snark with each other so I'm not incentivized to defend him.
@mattyglesias @yeselson Alternatively the fact that Vermeule came to integralism after getting tenure shows that tenure is a possible bug in the system of gently enforcing orthodoxies.
@mattyglesias @yeselson Sure thing.
@yeselson @mattyglesias Undoubtedly! Do you think he should be sacked?
@yeselson @mattyglesias The Ivy League has quite a few libertarian and conservative economists, the occasional Catholic or Straussian political theorist, and one law professor who defends Law and Justice and Orban.
@yeselson @mattyglesias Vermeule is definitely against liberal democracy and in favor of some illiberal Catholic alternative. I don't think "fascist" is the correct term, but then I'm invested in parsing the right pretty carefully. He's also one guy.
@mattyglesias The conservative movement has always been for substantial wage subsidies and rethinking free trade?
@RadioFreeTom Trumpism is more incoherent than its European analogues, I agree, but there are pretty clear patterns all the same -- against Wilsonianism in FP, against existing trade consensus, for harder limits on immigration, etc. -- that break with the Reagan and GWB eras.
@mattyglesias Who are the fascists? Harvard Law has its token integralist, I guess ...
@willwilkinson Yes, absolutely. And there's even a version of populism that might coax back some Rawlsekians who aren't as militantly cosmopolitan as yourself :)
Incidentally I think this @davidfrum "liberal Republican" pitch is another possible reaction to the shift I'm describing, though I also think Frum is more likely to find himself back "on the right" post-Trump than is Boot or Jen Rubin:	https://t.co/mI6UtPkp2m
Such a shift could happen to me, depending on how coalitions form and splinter. It's not a slur or an excommunication to suggest that some people who identified with conservatism in 1980 or 2001 may not be identified with it after Trump. It's just how political change works.
And the fact that Tom Nichols voted for Reagan when I was in diapers won't be any more relevant to anything than the fact that the neoconservatives were once New Deal and JFK Democrats.
If that happens it won't mean they were  somehow just "interlopers" as Boot suggests I'm calling him. It won't be a judgment on them for betraying the TrueCon faith. It will just mean that issues that once bound them to the right are no longer the right's organizing ideas.
And at a certain point the Republican Party may "normalize" somewhat after Trump while also keeping some of his ideological innovations. And if that happens NeverTrumpers who are militantly anti-populist will have weaker reasons to remain part of the conservative coalition.
That change is clearest on foreign policy and trade, more rhetorical on other fronts -- but it's a populist turn that resembles populist turns everywhere else in the Western world, and so it's not just a Trump thing alone.
... ideological programs nonetheless matter, often intensely, to how people are identified and self-identify. And alongside all the other stuff he's doing Trump has changed, somewhat, the ideological content of conservatism relative to where it was under GWB/McCain/Romney.
That kind of institutional conservatism remains a good reason to be NeverTrump, and thus when, say, @RadioFreeTom talks about his anti-Trumpism as a "conservative" approach to institutions rather than an ideological program I think the label is totally appropriate. But ...
Meaning that some NeverTrumpers were libertarians, some were moderates, some were social conservatives, some were FP hawks, etc. My colleague @BretStephensNYT and I, for instance, were both anti-Trump despite being very different kinds of conservatives in ideological terms.
One way to think about the NeverTrump "movement" was that it was united by a kind of conservatism -- an institutional conservatism that feared Trump's personal effect on the republic and the world -- but divided by every other kind.

@Vermeullarmine Fair enough.
@CaitlinPacific Not even the sacrament of confirmation can erase hundreds of years of New England ancestors.
Absent such an explanation I feel like I'm watching a sort of supercilious stunt -- "the true illiberalism doesn't explain itself." Which, okay. But I think professors Vermeule &amp; Pappin have more to offer us than this, and I hope they'll consider a different mode of argument.
I can see some ways to reconcile those positions, but I think it would be helpful if the reconciliation were actually explained, rather than defended with personal jabs at MBD's sportswriting (?) and links to that noted integralist Michael Sean Winters.
So when I say that I want to better understand the Vermeule/Pappin take, which combines maximal Pio Nono style anti-modernism with what seems to me like maximal indifference to the Francis-era revival of high 1970s-style modernism, I am being completely sincere.
I think there's a lot of reasonable uncertainty about how Catholics should write about the pope and the controversies and scandals of the Francis-era church. My own approach can certainly be faulted.
I've never met @avermeule in the flesh but just about everything he's written at length since swimming the Tiber is provocative and self-recommending. I do know @gjpappin and I think he's doing bang-up work at American Affairs.
I'm a semi-desiccated Ivy-educated WASP not an Irish scrapper like MBD so I'm going to say something different about this beef.	https://t.co/RJxZ5TSC2e
@smithpatrick08 @CaptPeabody I completely agree that the absence of a non-ecclesiastical power with interest in pursuing + resolving theological controversies makes this era very unlike the medieval *or* Constantinian periods.
@smithpatrick08 It's plausible to argue that criticisms of church leaders are safer when secular powers are Catholic too, and a stricter ultramontanism is more prudential when the church is beset from without. But OTOH the entire sex abuse crisis is a story of false prudence leading to disaster.
An alternative take on this @jonathanchait piece is that the Trump administration has implemented a bunch of conservative-wonk preferences for Obamacare, liberals warned that it would sabotage the system, and so far they've been proven wrong:	https://t.co/JBo5a7wCX0
@CaptPeabody Alternatively there's a characteristically-American style of ultramontanism and exaggerated episcapolatry, and many of the vigorous critiques of bishops offered these days are more in a medieval-European spirit.
@gjpappin @michaelbd I would read an actual essay, as opposed to tweeted snark, making the case that the pope’s conservative critics are mistaken in their interpretations of events. American Affairs could publish it!
@Vermeullarmine @gjpappin Yes, I read that thread. If I were inclined to draw an analogy, I would say that it bears the same relationship to Francis's papacy that Rubin's commentary on the Romney campaign bore to the thing itself.
@gjpappin @Vermeullarmine Yes, I get that you guys enjoy the shtick and don't care for MBD. Carry on.
@Vermeullarmine Someday I need you or @gjpappin to explain your plan to advance integralism and Pio Nono Catholicism by eyerolling fellow Catholics who point out the obvious advance of liberalism within the church.

@asymmetricinfo @NateSilver538 Right, but in that case the fully-honest answer is, "I probably have forgotten a detail here or there, senator, but that's not the same as blacking out." Which he didn't want to say for defense-lawyer reasons.
@NateSilver538 Yeah, though I think in his next answer to her he's trying define her Q about "part of what happened" as a "blackout" Q as opposed to a Q about normal memory issues and to deny that.
So there you have it. I think he lied at least once. I find his blackout/pass out distinction plausible but not the extent to which he denied memory loss of any kind. I don't agree w/Silver's reading of a number of cases. This is an analytic thread, no conclusions will be drawn.
Devil's Triangle I am agnostic. Renate, I think he's probably lying when he says "alumnius" did not refer to sex; at best I think it had multiple implications (that she was a fall-back date for all of them for dances, say) but I can't believe it didn't have a sexual connotation.
Finally boofing/Devil's Triangle/Renate. We have at least one later G-Town alum, a reporter, saying that "boofing" referred to farting. Not dispositive but certainly a reason to think it might be true.	https://t.co/EZJbEcaqY1
... so I think he could reasonably say that he thinks he's answering a Q about physical aggression, not just getting  noisy or argumentative or something. And one tossed drink at a New Haven bar doesn't, to me, establish a pattern of frequent drunken physical aggression.
I'm less convinced by Silver's final example, where he calls it "extremely implausible" that BK says answer "basically no" to Coons' Q about becoming "aggressive" while drunk. To me "aggressive" is such an elastic word, and BK's under examination about attempted rape ...
I think it's the case where he's most likely to be lying or using a technical definition of "tell you about something" -- thinking, "okay, I probably lost a memory here or there but I can't remember anyone specifically saying, 'hey, Brett, remember this thing that happened...'"
To me that's the most dubious of all the drinking answers. Since everyone loses a little memory it's less likely to be true than the no-blackout answer, esp. since he does seem to joke about memory loss on other occasions.
Mitchell asking him about waking up somewhere else in different clothes, etc., falls squarely into this blackout category. So do others. But she also asks him, "when you would be drinking, did anyone ever tell you about something that you did not remember?" And he says no.
Kavanaugh gets asked a lot about his memory in the hearing. Most of his answers come across as denying that he had ever "forgotten an *evening* after drinking" (to quote Coons). That might be a lie but every college/HS drinker is different and I don't think you can assume it is.
And here's where the lawyerly question comes in. There's a difference between losing bits and pieces of memory to drinking and blacking out. Almost everyone who has a night of drinking gets a little memory impairment. Everyone doesn't black out.
Since many people pass out without blacking out, that distinction isn't obviously a lie or even lawyering. But Silver thinks the black-out claim is highly unlikely, especially "given his repeated apparent references to drinking-related memory losses in e.g. his yearbook."
Next on Silver's list is "claiming to Mitchell to have never have passed out is extremely implausible." I don't think BK claimed to have never passed out; he seemed to make a distinction between passing out and blacking out: "I’ve gone to sleep ... but I’ve never blacked out."
Later in passing he says "the drinking age, as I noted, was 18," without making the MD/DC distinction. But he already made it. And he lived next door to DC. No lie here, and only lawyering if you think he's implying that he only drank once he turned 18. But I don't think he is.
Next, his claims about the drinking age in MD. This doesn't seem like lying at all. In his prepared statement he says: "The drinking age was 18 in Maryland for most of my time in high school, and was 18 in D.C. for all of my time in high school." This is entirely accurate.
If he doesn't have a weak stomach, this would be a lie. But I've talked to mere acquaintances of Kavanaugh who attest to his weak stomach, his difficulty w/spicy food. So I'm going to go with lawyerly defensiveness, not lying.
As I read that he's not saying he threw up from spicy food at Beach Week, just that his weak stomach meant that he could throw up from drinking without having drunk more than others, bc he throw up easily from other things as well.
I'm going to work backward on his list, apologies if this is awkward. Start with Kav's claim that "ralphing" reflects the fact that "I got a weak stomach, whether it’s with beer or with spicy food or anything."
Since everyone is litigating Kavanaugh's lies or lack thereof today, I owe @NateSilver538 a response to this list, per our disagreement as to whether Kav was mostly being "lawyerly" about drinking or lying:	https://t.co/VFsekhHOoJ

@NateSilver538 Which is still a plausible (to me) argument for not putting him on the court, but a somewhat different read on what he's doing and why ppl on the right find it understandable/excusable.
@NateSilver538 Speaking only for myself I think his opening statement was partisan, but his minimization and deflection around drinking fits more with someone who feels himself a unfairly-presumed-guilty criminal defendant than an operative.
@jpodhoretz That movie's reception is a weird synechdoche for Western politics in the age of elite failure and populist excess.
@NateSilver538 Thanks. I agree that a couple of the yearbook things are more likely to be lies than anything else he's being attacked over. I'll try to explain why I think most of a-f are lawlerly a little later.
@NateSilver538 What's the most flagrant drink-related lie in your estimation?
How about this position: He did as much minimizing as possible without being directly dishonest, and many of the attempts to cast that lawyerly defensiveness as perjury are being dishonest themselves.	https://t.co/1tPpbsR8WK
@jpodhoretz It reads to me that he's distinguishing the kind of "passing out" where you just seem to fall asleep from a blackout (which is, indeed, different), not claiming definitively that he never passed out.
@HeerJeet Unless you read the part of the same transcript where he says friends told him in advance that she was calling around with some kind of story.
I've been in two bar fights, though I suppose one was technically a "Jumbo Slice fight." (In neither was I anywhere close to blackout drunk.)
@jpodhoretz Did Kavanaugh say he never passed out? The quote I have is  I’ve gone to sleep, but — but I’ve never blacked out. That’s the — that’s the — the allegation, and that — that — that’s wrong." Is there something else?
Relevant testimony here:	https://t.co/FY7pBMmhrn
This one appears to be a case study; it quotes Kavanaugh saying he'd never heard the Ramirez allegations until the New Yorker story, but omits him also saying he'd heard from mutual friends that she was calling around about him before the story broke:	https://t.co/ib5DlwUDgd
A not-insignificant number of the claims that Kavanaugh committed perjury tend to fall apart if you read more of the transcript of his testimony than what is quoted for the purposes of the allegation.
People really *wanted* to believe in TFA and TLJ, and critics especially felt pressure to defend TLJ after the unwoke/toxic backlash, so the fact that neither was actually very good and TLJ especially left a lot of sublimated anger that got unloaded on the mediocrity of "Solo."

@OrrChris Rs are about to do somethin reckless. But it's still important to recognize that Dems have had a lot tacit power over this process and haven't used it in ways that encourage actual investigative work -- which is part of why Rs don't think the FBI stuff is good faith now.
@OrrChris Yes, "give the Dems more than what they want and see what happens" could have been a frame, I agree. Maybe that should have occurred to me while I was writing it at 11:30 PM but sadly I did it this way instead.
@HeerJeet Or it just suggests that Kavanaugh wants to be on the court more than he wants to risk entering the unknown unknowns of Mark Judge's memory, or the political damage done by watching Judge take the fifth.
@ernietedeschi It's Roberts who's more likely to uphold Roe now.
@OrrChris I am genuinely unclear about whether the Democrats would support any of the "and then some" based on how they've handled matters so far, esp. yesterday. If they would then I am on their side.
@OrrChris I think I would prefer a Senate investigation to an FBI investigation. But yes, I don't support the GOP vote right now. I just don't think Judge alone should be asked to testify.
@OrrChris They're clearly eager for Judge to be subpoena'd and for the FBI to do something that will run more time off the clock. Beyond that I'm not sure.
@OrrChris I agree that the GOP is being reckless. But if the Democrats are so eager for an investigation, why didn't they cooperate with Judiciary interviewers in the last week's interviews? Why didn't they ask any meaningful investigatory Qs in the hearing yesterday?

@yeselson @TPCarney Would they agree to call the Blaseys and Garrett? I'm honestly curious.
Donnelly's ready for Barrett.
@chrislhayes I would be *very* curious what Senate Dems would say about interviewing Keyser and Garrett (and the other guys on the calendar square if they want).
@jbarro Well, it's strategic if they're worried that there are possible weaknesses in her story that they don't want to push on too hard.
@chrislhayes Can I get your liberal stamp on approval on a few other people answering those questions too?
@jbarro That obsession joined to with their refusal to participate in investigatory work is what has convinced Rs that Ds only care about delay and so no more delay can be tolerated.
Which is probably why Ford cited Garrett's role, and then you had that calendar sitting there with a party date with Smyth and Garrett and Judge's names all on it, and literally no Democrat asked about it, preferring the ralphing inquiry instead.
Also one reason why the Whelan gambit was such a disaster was that it convinced liberals that any attempt to pin down details of her account was just a Kavanaugh-driven effort to throw smoke around her story.
Again, key factors here along with general GOP desire to push this through are that Senate Ds really only want to hear from Judge (and the polygrapher!), and the swing votes don't want to get a more conservative nominee so they'd rather not take the risk of interviewing anybody.
Surely Judge, Garrett and Leland Keyser could be interviewed privately by Senate investigators between today and the final vote.
I had not seen that Judge expressed a willingness yesterday to participate in "a confidential, fact-finding investigation."	https://t.co/nH4JSH9nux
Seems like an interesting time for somebody to take a poll.
And the fact that he apparently wrote to Leahy (missed this somehow yesterday) is all the more reason to hear what he has to say:	https://t.co/2pnpIbY8u4
He supposedly introduced Ford and Kavanaugh. He dated Ford. He lived in the area. He partied with Judge, Kavanaugh + Smyth on at least one weeknight that summer. The fact that he was recklessly named as a suspect by Ed Whelan doesn't change his possible importance as a witness.

Since polygraphs are lousy evidence anyway what are we possibly establishing here?
Current Republican line of questioning seems mostly intended to exonerate their approach to the process, not to help Kavanaugh.

@mattyglesias @jbarro I think this experience has been very bad for the FedSoc model but not in the way you mean.
@yeselson I think that Blasey and Ramirez are both describing real traumas. I'm agnostic about Avenatti's accuser, skeptical of anonymous. But I'd feel more comfortable fully believing any/all of them, given the specifics they're offering, with even just one directly corroborating witness.
@yeselson I don't think it would take incredible courage at this point for a witness to the Yale incident to come forward, or a witness to the "trains," or a witness to the anonymously-alleged incident.
This means we now have four allegations of misconduct, three of which supposedly took place in front of multiple witnesses. Given the publicity and stakes, it seems like it should be possible to produce at least one credible witness for one of the latter three cases.
The key quotes for today are “there were at least four witnesses including my daughter" (see below), which joins "I am aware of other witnesses who can attest to the truthfulness of each of the statements above" in the Avenatti affidavit.	https://t.co/lta7VGDOeG
@MZHemingway It may be outdated, but it's worth remembering that all the people who consider themselves "factions" of the right do not add up to the entire Republican coalition. (If they did Trump probably wouldn't be president.)
You can read that affidavit's allegations in a number of different ways, is all I'm saying.
Well ... another option is that Kavanaugh was adjacent to some semi-planned bad sh-t, taking advantage of a drunk girl or girls, that Avenatti and his client is framing as his fault without directly saying he did it.	https://t.co/l4oFXw8DpB
@publicroad And the third is kind of a kill shot, at least if you don't parse it too closely.
@publicroad I don't think the second one was invented; I think it's clearly unclear in her own mind if it was definitely BK. Possible to see "please be him" outreach shaping such a reconstruction.
@JZmirak @uconsent Yes, the replacement should be Barrett, with red-state Dems pressured to vote for her if Collins won't.
@uconsent @JZmirak Don't forget 4. Making Roberts deathly afraid of doing anything that risks his institution's legitimacy.		All this seems like a good argument for a different nominee.
@publicroad I think the idea that if some of these accusations could be the result of a mistake of memory, or the partisan encouragement of the same, the scale of hysteria around a nomination is relevant.
@publicroad They weren't just as motivated, though. The balance of the court wasn't changing; Roe wasn't possibly at stake. The tenor of the entire hearings was different.
Maybe you really can't replace BK because the base won't have it, but ... 	https://t.co/cGngIrq7Gx
@jonathanchait I don't agree with the "it's all coordination" theory but the answer would be the same reason Rs blocked Garland; possible shifts in the balance of the court bring out more aggressive tactics in a way that the mere replacement Scalia with Gorsuch didn't.
@JZmirak @jneeley78 Alternative alternative theory: God is passing judgment on everything bad that happened in Catholic institutions between 1955 and 1985, and it was the turn of venal Catholic high schools with libertine cultures to feel the lash.

That's hardly reason enough to make the move, not least because Barrett might not be confirmable in the lame duck or at all. But the idea that the GOP has no *political* choices here is wrong.
@willwilkinson I have already written not one but two columns arguing that the normal standard of proof has to change with a SC appointment. I'm asking you if there's any line where your lowering of that standard stops.
No way to settle it, but if there were I would gladly bet @seanmdav a nice steakhouse dinner that if Kavanaugh were pulled and Barrett substituted and the vote was scheduled for the lame duck GOP turnout would be higher than if he's confirmed next week.	https://t.co/xSh6i1qBGc

@willwilkinson Okay. Again, most of the men who have expressed to me versions of the concern you dismissed are people involved in or considering a career in politics that might lead them to a prominent job or appointment. I don't think they'd find your analysis reassuring.
I take the allegations seriously. I also think the genesis and thinness of the New Yorker story guaranteed that it would be interpreted as a smear by anyone with any investment in Kavanaugh.	https://t.co/ePBhqUGN05
@IChotiner The rather different behavior of feminist leaders in 1998 versus 1991 suggests that sexism does not suffice as an explanation.
@willwilkinson So you would be willing to condemn the approach taken in the New Yorker story if this were, say, a Senate candidate or a nominee for a circuit court?
@IChotiner Yeah, they imply that liberals decided the Monica stuff wasn't impeachable and the Broaddrick/Willey stuff was just lies because they didn't like Ken Starr and Newt Gingrich and feared handing a victory to neo-puritans.
@IChotiner The psychological process from the initial Monica news to the decision to stand by him was pretty much identical.
@IChotiner Maybe not, but again: the Democratic Party of our youth literally kept a perjurer, harasser and likely rapist in the White House because of this precise dynamic.
@willwilkinson "there are no normal standards for this" but if men find that at all worrying they're either guilty or rape deniers. Oh-kay.
@IChotiner Sure, liberals have never ended up defending a major political figure on their side because they decided conservatives were out to get him and breaking all the rules to do so.
My feeling at the moment is that the New Yorker story is a brilliant play by liberals to get conservatives to stick with a nominee when they should be open to having him withdraw. (Even more brilliant to add Avenatti to the mix.)
@willwilkinson Doesn't mean it's not true. But still seems like something that could reasonably trouble men in public service in a polarized environment.
@willwilkinson It's an accusation the woman herself concedes is less-than-reliable, the authors concede was brought forward because partisans went looking for stories like it and the woman felt pressured into offering it, and it clearly fell short of normal newspaper standards for publication.
@willwilkinson Will, do you find the way that the New Yorker accusation has been surfaced at all troubling as a precedent for high-stakes appointments?

@mattyglesias The Miranda ruling, to pick an example, was super-controversial when it happened. But it didn't poison the nominating process, and when later conservative courts upheld it in modified form there wasn't a huge fury on the right.
@mattyglesias The entire Warren Court was unpopular with conservatives and contributed to a push for more conservative nominees. But the eventual collapse of the nomination *process* happens because of Roe.

@mattyglesias More that Brown shows that judicial activism can work out okay if it correctly anticipates an emerging consensus; Roe shows what happens when it doesn't.
You can believe Roe was morally just and good public policy if you want. But the entire deterioration since, from Bork to Estrada to Garland to Kavanaugh, is clearly rooted in the judicialization of the central battle in the culture war.

What a mess.
Best-case scenario politically for GOP might be to hold the vote and have Collins and Murkowski vote BK down while also agreeing to support an equally or more conservative follow-up nominee. But it's not clear to me that they would agree to play that part.
Base-galvanizing in the short run, fodder for delegitimization if BK rules against Roe etc, and also a useful means to pressure him (and John Roberts, anxious custodian of SC legitimacy) not to rule against social liberal causes too often.
Two thoughts, not mutually exclusive:	1. Latest accusation against Kavanaugh is weaker than the first.	2. Obviously they'd prefer to deny the GOP a nominee altogether, but having GOP push through BK under these circumstances creates a pretty good political scenario for liberals.

(And also that if American religious conservatives are against something it must be a pretty good idea.)
A consistent theme of this pontificate is the belief that evangelization will flourish again once certain important truces are concluded with worldly powers, East and West. 	https://t.co/ld2FSqGkTu
@GibsonWrites @TheAnchoress @jzipple @PatriciaHeaton Lot of reasonable critiques of Vigano but calling it "clericalism" to name a bunch of cardinals who allegedly protected a predator while calling for the pope to resign is a weird use of the epithet. "The clericalism of anti-clericalism" I guess.
@mattyglesias @reihan So Reihan is proposing a position to the left of Trump but somewhat to the right of the last almost-compromise.
@mattyglesias @reihan .... + a substantial increase in the immigration rate.
@mattyglesias @reihan My sense is that "Democratic Party mainstream" position is that we need higher immigration rates and less enforcement. Do you think that's wrong? Reihan's position is definitely close to the center-left position under Bill Clinton.
@JZmirak @SohrabAhmari It would not, but a serious charge against a man poised to become a cardinal need not meet the church-tribunal bar to be taken seriously as a reason not to elevate him.
@jbarro @mattklewis Sure. But as a bar, nobody should expect withdrawal without public testimony.
@JZmirak @SohrabAhmari Nothing is impossible. But if this were a story about a churchman you admired, John, I think you would be willing to see, based on bitter experience, that it could very easily be simply true.
@mattklewis @jbarro If he were withdrawn without her testifying, yes. If she goes through with testifying, though, that sets a high bar for would-be fabulists.
@SohrabAhmari I don't see why "she's a partisan fabulist" is more potent than "she misremembers the incident."
@EricaGrieder I do not necessarily believe it (at all!), but if you were defending what you thought was an innocent man against an allegation that did not have to meet the usual legal standards of proof why wouldn't you try to figure out what really happened?
@SohrabAhmari I don't think I agree, if there are only a limited number of plausible exculpatory theories.
@jbarro All I mean is that if this is really the standard for BK's confirmation then finding the real rapist or somehow proving she's a liar are the only options that would get him through.
@jbarro I have some reasons, but I'm also acutely aware that I just wrote a column saying, "If she's credible and K can't prove the negative he should withdraw." And coming up with another theory *is* how you prove a negative.
@SohrabAhmari For the accusation to be false something else must be true.
@jbarro No, but I don't think Whelan's goal was just to raise a theory.
@jbarro This has roughly been my take, as you know. But if that's the bar, then raising some alternate hypothesis, a la Whelan, becomes the only way that people who think he's innocent and should be on the court can respond.

It's entirely reasonable to think that a different standard than due process than should apply in a case like this. But if it does, it's a way of being tougher on a man because he's up for an elite job, not letting him slide because he's in the right club.
There are certainly contexts where elite teenagers get away with crimes that send other teenagers to jail. But it's harder to imagine a non-elite fiftysomething man being charged or fired on the basis of an allegation like this from his teenage years.
@mattyglesias @jeffspross Nobody think the court will make abortion illegal, notwithstanding the 14th amendment case.
At the moment the reason that a single inherently unprovable allegation from decades ago could lead to Kavanaugh's withdrawal is precisely that he is an elite in the running for the most elite of jobs, which might require a higher, above-suspicion standard than in normal life.
I'm going to take a break from arguing privately with conservative friends who think I'm too willing to throw Kavanaugh under the #meToo bus to say that the takes from liberals about how "if BK gets away with this it proves elite impunity" are extremely premature.

There is a miasma of corruption around some of the pope's allies. Something like this should be an opportunity to clear it away. If no such steps are taken, and we just get lectures about the wheat and the tares, what are the faithful supposed to believe about the pope?

That we are getting, instead, silence + stonewalling + concerted attacks on conservative Catholics ("the EWTN schism"! the "Catholic Benghazi"!!!) asking for an investigation is ... unfortunate.
If that's the case it seems to me that the Holy Father owes the faithful an apology for that shrugging-off, and transparency about whatever reached Rome about McCarrick under JPII and Benedict, but not a resignation.
And the weakness of whatever was implemented gave Francis the excuse to shrug off whatever he was told, by Vigano and others, about McCarrick's file and record.
There was some attempt to restrict him, it was communicated to McCarrick somehow but not formalized, it wasn't well enforced, and there wasn't anything for Francis to "lift."
This description of how Benedict did and didn't sanction McCarrick conforms generally to my speculation in Wednesday's column:	https://t.co/0Uu9u3qEag
@JZmirak @austeni @JohnLAllenJr So far as we know, yes. Vigano's letter mentions only abuse of seminarians.

And again: If Pope Francis was misled about McCarrick and wasn't that culpable, but the other parts of Vigano's account are true, the pope should be firing people.
And I want to stress again: Everyone is focused on the pope(s), but his letter is an indictment of the entire bureaucracy, which knew about McCarrick for a decade (not the worst, but SLEEPING WITH YOUR SEMINARIANS is bad enough) and at best imposed easily-flouted sanctions.

I don't expect this point to revive Damon's flagging faith, or anyone else's, in the face of so much ugliness. But all I would say is that if you're a Catholic Christian (or any other kind) who reads the Bible, you've been well-warned that it might, all too often, come to this.
But for all their horror the prophets never doubt that Israel *is* the elect, the chosen people, God's intended bride. And if the Old Testament is supposed to be a revelation with big implications for the new covenant, for the Christian church, that part is important.
Pace certain evangelicals-for-Trump and certain RC churchmen, this is not an argument for tolerating ugliness in service of some higher good. God and His prophet deal very harshly w/David when he kills Uriah, and the attitude of the prophets throughout is horror at Israel's sins.
The *best* king of Israel, the awesome all-conquering one, is a philanderer and murderer. The second-best one, the temple-builder, becomes an idol-worshiper. And about the rest, the less said the better.
Basically the Hebrew Bible says: "Hi, we're the true chosen people of God, and to prove it let us tell a long series of stories about how our patriarchs were sinners, our kings were even worse, and we failed God completely time and time again."
And they buttress those claims with an extensive history in which they are ... terrible. Morally terrible, politically impotent, constantly apostasizing, ignoring their prophets, the works.
One of the striking things about the Hebrew Bible is that it's the record of a people that makes extraordinary claims for itself -- that their tribal god is the Only God, that they are His chosen people, that all nations will eventually worship him, etc.
I didn't grow up Catholic, but within various kinds of Protestantism, which meant that the Old Testament loomed pretty large in my childhood religious imagination.
Just a brief word on this powerful piece from my friend @DamonLinker, on the moral ugliness of contemporary Catholicism and why he can't remain in the pews anymore:	https://t.co/bQ1kAGdc7w
@asymmetricinfo That's the strong case for the argument that something happened to seminary and priestly culture from mid-century onward that made pederasty specifically more commonplace.
@asymmetricinfo "In addition, the incidence of abuse of females did not change as dramatically as did the incidence of the abuse of males. There was, however, a more than 6-fold increase in the number of reported acts of abuse of males aged eleven to seventeen between the 1950s and the 1970s."
@asymmetricinfo But the Jay report specifically found that "the incidence of sexual molestation of a minor under eleven years of age did not vary as greatly throughout the period as did the molestation of older children."
@asymmetricinfo I don't want to step on your tweetstorm, but if nothing really changed in the '60s except the ppl became more willing to report abuse, you would expect reports of pedophilia and pederasty, abuse of girls and abuse of boys, to all rise together.

@go_oat Who is scraeming etc
@bdmcclay Yes: I'm just trying to imagine the mindset here, not endorse it.
Because absent such commands the exculpatory scenarios will gradually lose their persuasive power. /fin
At the very least he has the power to command many of the cardinals -- Levada, Ouellet, Parolin, many more -- named in Vigano's letter to go on the record and either deny the claims or explain themselves. Will he so command?
Is he doing any of that? Will anyone who knew about McCarrick in the Vatican own up or lose their jobs? This is my question for @austeni and the rest of the papal brigade: Can we expect consequences for anyone besides Francis from this debacle?
He should be demanding the kind of investigation *at the Vatican* that has been demanded in America. He should be asking for the resignations of active members of his cabinet who should have known about McCarrick.
If Francis was misled, somehow, into thinking that these allegations were not serious, he should be *furious* at the cardinals who were in a position to tell him not to let McCarrick globetrot and posture as his adviser.
If Vigano's account is generally accurate, it means that many cardinals with positions of power in Rome, across many years, were in a position to know that the cardinal archbishop of DC had at the very least preyed on seminarians.
My column on the Vigano allegations tries to envision a scenario where Vigano is basically telling the truth but Francis is not as culpable as he suggests. But it's worth teasing out the implications of that possibility further.	https://t.co/vcx6q1wWhU

@Vermeullarmine In general the “inflammatory” interpretations of events have been a surer guide to both this pontificate’s progress and the sex abuse crisis than the temperate ones.
Pedantry alone will not resolve the “civil war” civil war.
If you reject all martial metaphors to describe sustained, serious, high-stakes, possibly irreconcilable ideological conflicts within institutions, there is not a civil war in Catholicism. If you allow martial metaphors to describe such conflicts, there very obviously is.

@Vermeullarmine @SohrabAhmari @AshleyMcKinless The perceived corruption of the clergy also plays a role in the generational hemorrhaging of believers to Pentecostalism in Central America. The fact that some churches at the periphery are healthy and dynamic is not proof that this stuff doesn't matter.
@Vermeullarmine @SohrabAhmari @AshleyMcKinless For that matter, go ask the leaders of the church circa 1550.
@Vermeullarmine @SohrabAhmari @AshleyMcKinless There is some truth to this, but go ask the Irish about the marginality of scandal to the concrete life of the church.
@holysmoke Also: Unlike w/Tobin and Farrell, where McCarrick probably played a real role, my understanding is that Cupich's name was pushed up to the pope by American Jesuits.
@yeselson @jbouie Kasich should have run third party in 2016, when he would have had Romney and some other GOP bigs behind him, plus Hillary as a foil for his (phony) outsider shtick.
@yeselson @jneeley78 The cardinals who elected Bergoglio, in turn, thought they were getting a moderate outsider who would pursue a clean-up as his main agenda. He turned out to be an aggressive liberalizer who turned to the (corrupt) liberal old guard for support.
@yeselson @jneeley78 The conservative side thought that in electing Benedict they were getting a tough power player who was less compromised than many and therefore capable of a clean-up. But he turned out to be a weak professor who just wanted to write books.

@ModeledBehavior That's why I don't pay attention to secular politics.
@EsotericCD I prefer the current Vatican remake.
@ernietedeschi It would be very characteristic of Benedict's disastrous management style, certainly.
@ernietedeschi If there were sanctions there's no question that they weren't seriously enforced. Also something that Levada or any of the others should be able to speak to.
Vigano ends up in a sweepingly anti-Francis place but there are a lot of names and stories in his letter before the current pope appears.
I'm also curious if the observers suggesting this is "the Catholic right's Benghazi" believe that the Vigano letter's account of several nuncios' attempts to inform Rome of McCarrick's crimes in the early 2000s should be taken seriously or dismissed with prejudice as well.
The Holy Father is of course within his rights not to comment, but the Vigano letter names a *long* list of prominent cardinals who could be reasonably asked to clear up the matter of whether McCarrick was sanctioned by Benedict. Starting with, let's say, William Levada.
@allahpundit I'm going to die on the Trump = Francis hill, all alone but totally correct.
Now it's time to go to mass.
A more general observation: The church's internal civil war is a reality-distorting field where the sex abuse crisis is concerned, and likely to remain so.
I can't really imagine Francis resigning over this. But that doesn't mean that it will simply blow over, either. Which is another way of saying I have no idea what happens next.
Vigano claims there is ample documentation; @EdwardPentin says that people in Benedict's circle are confirming part of the story. The task for the press is to pursue that possible confirmation.
Just how much of a defense that would be I leave for the reader to decide.
Is there a defense of Francis compatible w/Vigano basically telling the truth? I suppose it might be this: @pontifex was friends w/McCarrick, assumed some allegations were calumnies, didn't know about the abuse of minors, assumed the cardinal had just had a couple gay affairs.
The idea that Benedict would put McCarrick on a kind of "double-secret probation" version of suspension manages to be at once implausible and plausible.
The portrait of the Benedict papacy as sabotaged constantly by Bertone is self-serving because Vigano and Bertone were enemies. It also fits completely with known facts.
A much weaker reason to doubt its contents is that Vigano is a conservative who lost internal Vatican battles and strongly dislikes Francis and writes in a shrill and sweeping style. That's just the profile of the kind of person most likely to become a whistleblower.
The best reason to doubt its contents is right here: Whatever supposed sanctions were placed on Cardinal McCarrick by Benedict XVI, they did not prevent him from giving homilies in Saint Patrick's Cathedral:	https://t.co/bJvOWMizjw

@ayjay Unknowable as yet, but not nada I think.

This is either an extraordinary and vicious slander or an act of revelation that should be the undoing of just about every figure mentioned in its pages. It has an apocalyptic feel either way.
In fact, both popes. But Benedict appears as a figure (weakly, insufficiently) attempting to act on testimony concerning McCarrick's crimes, while Francis is portrayed as intent on restoring the pederast cardinal to activity and influence *despite* his awareness of those crimes.
Written by the former papal nuncio to the U.S., it does exactly what many have called for, and offers testimony concerning who in the hierarchy knew what, and when, about the crimes of Cardinal McCarrick. The testimony implicates a host of high-ranking churchmen. And the pope.

I cannot find the link, but @RameshPonnuru wrote a piece back in 2007-2008 about McCain's politics of honor that I think was one of the best measures of the man. He was our most Roman legislator, for good or ill or both.
The best thing to be said about McCain's record is that he took being a senator seriously. He appreciated the powers of his office, and tried to exploit them to the hilt for his conception of the common good. Not something you can say of some/many of his colleagues.
I also can't condemn McCain's choice of Palin in 2008 because I sort-of urged it upon him at the time. She was chosen to be something other than what she turned out to be, on the basis of a record that implied strengths she turned out to lack.
I supported McCain over Bush in 2000 and though they were both wrong about the Iraq War I think the timeline where McCain won that race is probably the better one.
John McCain, though a Boomer, was really a throwback to the post-WWII era: A would-be bipartisan dealmaker with a career founded on military courage. His strengths were often ill-suited to the times and his weaknesses amplified by them. But we shall not see his like again. RIP.

@austeni @MassimoFaggioli I think your point was clear enough, as has been Professor Faggioli's critique of the inquisitorial mood among conservatives. And I said the point is reasonable. But also reasonable to note that all three papacies are implicated and only Francis is pope now.
That's all I wanted to say on this front. The question of how such an investigation might be designed is obviously vexed as well, but I'll leave off for now.
It would certainly lead to some "outings." But the hope would be (or my hope would be) that it would become easier for faithful, serious gay priests to have an investigation of networks that by their nature depend on ensnaring people, holding any failings over their heads, etc.
For instance, I disagree with the position (though not some of his other points) that Father James Alison ascribes to me in this piece -- that the investigation conservatives have in mind should somehow "weed out the gays." No. 	https://t.co/8TIDk9ufa1
I think it also would be helpful to explicitly reject the notion that this would be a out-all-the-gay-priests exercise, since in fact a harder line against predation and its protectors should make life easier, not tougher, for gay priests trying to live out a celibate vocation.
I think it might be helpful, though, for those of us who take this view to say so explicitly -- namely that McCarrick is a powerful precipitator for investigation but the goal should be sunlight-as-disinfectant all over, with this case as a good example:	https://t.co/yPc3T3FCA6
I don't know all the signatories but I know (and read) enough of them to believe that this complaint is unfair, and that in general younger conservative Catholics are extremely open to investigations of conservative bishops and a reassessment of the legacy of John Paul II.
The complaint (e.g. below) is that despite foreswearing partisanship the open letter's call is still influenced by an anti-Francis conservatism, which sees in the McCarrick case an opportunity to effectively go after the pope's allies and appointees.	https://t.co/sBXK3Yx4oM

@DecentFilms Yep. But that also gets at Q of whether a teaching can, as it were, "undevelop." Meaning: Early church ascetism on a range of personal/political issues develops into nuances of just war teaching, stronger emphasis on marriage, etc. Are those developments permanent or contingent?
@DecentFilms I think it's definitely more plausible than other bruited developments. At the same time my sense is that the tradition is friendlier to the justice (as opposed to merely the acceptability or necessity) of the death penalty than to the same re: slavery. But I could be wrong.
@DecentFilms I think I've read that piece about seventeen times :)
@austeni I would be interested to read an essay from you, or anyone, on which teachings *cannot* be so developed-into-inoperability and why.
@austeni Right. I'm just saying it's not just a question of clarifying some ambiguities in JP2. Both his teaching and Pius's are no longer operable.
@austeni If Francis is calling for "worldwide abolition," doesn't the world include myriad examples of civil breakdown? So that concession to the church's prior teaching would be tacitly retracted, not just clarified.

@matthewwalther Welcome to the Resistance, Matthew.
And life imprisonment under many penal conditions seems more contrary to human dignity than the death penalty.
An addendum to my DP comments: When I say the prudential case for abolition seems strong, that strong case rests on likelihood of executing innocents + inequitable applications. It doesn't preclude the intrinsic, indeed obvious justice of DP in some instances.
@go_oat In fairness I did raise that possibility in the book.
And as I said already at book length, I have no bloody idea how that crisis ends. /fin	https://t.co/FozMpoQRYl
But the bottom line is that this is another example of how Pope Francis has consistently exposed the tensions in the post-Vatican II conservative position, and pushed the JPII synthesis into intellectual crisis.
And speaking only for myself prudential arguments for opposing the death penalty seem more reasonable than prudential arguments for a truce w/the divorce revolution, and the DP seems less central to church teaching than marriage, so this shift is less personally faith-shaking.
In this case there may be less uproar, because conservative Catholics (see Brugger or Robert George or others) are less certain and more divided about the authoritativeness of past teaching on DP than they are about remarriage.
Now Francis is going further, doing something dramatic enough to be described as "development of doctrine" or a "new paradigm" -- but still preserving a touch of deniability on the definitiveness of the change, in which continuitarians can take refuge.
Another way to see this is that on both the death penalty and divorce, the JPII synthesis stretched the claim of continuity -- with a prudential anti-death penalty arg that *sounded* absolute, and a liberal annulment policy -- without making a formal break.
Which is also the effective pattern in other arenas -- like divorce -- where Francis has sought to shift a teaching without formally using the language of reversal. You can argue that constant teaching remains constant, but no normal person listening to popes would think that.
But anyone arguing for continuity has to recognize that at the very least this kind of shift turns the traditional teaching into a sort of hermetic secret, available to ppl who read extremely carefully but invisible in the normal public teaching of the church.
So you could argue -- and some will -- that we're still stopping sort of reversal, that the church is still emphasizing modern conditions to make a prudential argument rather than an absolute one -- even though some of its language is absolutizing.
That looks more like reversal. And yet -- if you read the preamble to the change, there's still talk about how the change reflects the fact that "more effective systems of detention have been developed." And "inadmissible" is not the same (or is it?) as "intrinsically evil."
Now we have new language that seems to go further, describing the death penalty as "inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person," and urging its worldwide abolition.	https://t.co/marRHvQZyR
And the keenest theological minds behind the JPII synthesis worked hard to argue for its prudential quality, and therefore its continuity with past church teaching -- for instance, Ratzinger in his public interventions, and Avery Dulles at length here:	https://t.co/SjM9t2y8nm
This move never seemed terribly coherent to me, since it didn't really address the fact that past church teaching had implied that the death penalty was retributively *just* and not merely a form of societal self-defense. But it did not amount to a reversal of past teaching.
This effectively sidestepped the debate about whether the DP was intrinsically evil by seeking recourse in a kind of consequentialism: It might be okay to use it to protect society in some situations but probably not in modern conditions.
The approach that the Vatican has taken since John Paul II has not gone this far, however. Instead, the pope and the catechism made a prudential argument for the abolition of the death penalty in modern wealthy societies, on grounds that it was unnecessary for societal safety.
There are anti-death penalty Catholic thinkers who argue that past teaching on this question was real but not authoritative/infallible, and therefore a reversal is possible. This is the position taken, for instance, by E. Christian Brugger in this debate:	https://t.co/frOE9FffR0
All right, let's attempt a thread on the Catholic Church and the death penalty. The starting point for the current debate is that historically the church has clearly accepted the death penalty as licit. To describe it as an intrinsic evil would therefore reverse past teaching.

@JZmirak @allahpundit Based on crossing rates we seem to be defending our borders pretty well compared to the early 2000s.
But since it's the marginal supporter rather than the core supporters who put him in the WH, Qs about the inevitable-or-not racial polarization of US politics turn in part on why those swing voters voted as they did. Where, again, 2018 may be telling.
Note that the claim that Trump's economic populism was really important to his victory is entirely compatible with the claim that many of his strongest supporters are motivated by racial threat/identity politics.
Should they stick with him it will be a clear point in favor of Trump explanations that place maximalist weight on racial polarization; should they drift back Demward (as in data @Nate_Cohn cites) it will be a point for the arg that his economic positioning mattered a lot in '16.
Since (with, as I wrote on Sunday, the important exception of tariffs) Trump has been more a conventional GOPer than a populist in office, while continuing to pick identitarian fights whenever possible, it will be interesting how the white-Midwest areas he swiped from Dems react.
Meaning no disrespect to all the studies that claim to answer the question decisively, it seems like the midterm results in white middle/working class areas will be a pretty useful indicator for analysis.

@gjpappin And a serene dismissiveness about the depth of corruption or the seriousness of doctrinal drift seems unlikely to produce a Hildebrand either.
@gjpappin Setting aside the differences between that situation and our own, a church run by McCarricks is unlikely to empower Hildebrands.
@jpodhoretz I'm not sure it can be "porn" when it's also moderately more plausible.
Put another way: The integralist project or any other may have a better chance than he allows because who know what's possible, but the internal-to-Christianity hurdles he identifies (of which McCarrick is just a particularly vivid example) have to be dealt with first.
It also could be that @roddreher overpessimizes the future of Western Christianity while being correct that absent dramatic internal reform the church is in no condition to assume the role that optimists envision for it.	https://t.co/mcfcvrHgGw

@roddreher Right, which is precisely the argument for having Rome itself ask them to tell all.
And while those facts will inevitably be folded back into theories, the bare answers to simple questions -- like, "to whom in Rome did the Americans warning about McCarrick speak? with which JPII or Benedict aides did the buck stop?" -- are something that everyone should want.
It's impossible, especially in such a polarizing pontificate, to avoid the pull of doctrinal civil wars entirely. But the case for an inquest is precisely that it gives you something besides theological-ideological theories; it gives you a fuller sense of the simple facts.
I would expect it to reveal embarrassing or devastating details about people within McCarrick's own network, who are more likely to be seen as progressives -- but also to confirm and expand our understanding of how JPII and Benedict and ppl around them failed the church, and why.
But just to clarify my own views: The inquest that I have in mind would absolutely encompass the decisions made in Rome, under conservative popes, that allowed McCarrick to be elevated and remain in good standing these long years.
And I think a piece like this one, from @jdflynn, does a good job of making it clear that in asking for answers about McCarrick the point is to seek a larger clarity, one that encompasses conservative figures like John Nienstedt in MN (among others):	https://t.co/WgO8NzJ1J0
That is, that some of the rage for an inquest or inquisition here is Catholic theological-cultural war by other means. I'm not convinced this is fair; at the very least many of the angriest pieces I've read (e.g. from @matthewwalther) have been extremely hard on John Paul II.
That debate is connected to a seeming sense, among ppl on the liberal side of Francis-era debates, that conservatives are intent on making a particular example of McCarrick and his friends + allies + successors bc they're part of the progressive coalition within the hierarchy.
A couple of follow-up notes. I mistakenly identified Cardinal Tobin of Newark as a former auxiliary bishop under McCarrick, which he was not. And there's a vigorous debate (including in my email) about whether McCarrick's influence over recent appointments has been overhyped.
My Wednesday column: The Truth About Cardinal McCarrick:	https://t.co/TUCQZa0SLb
@GibsonWrites I think that a serious investigation of McCarrick's career would necessarily bring some of those others up into the light as well. Also, what you do to a cardinal is easier to then apply to mere bishops.

@gjpappin @avermeule Yes, guys, I know what the endgame is. You're saying the quiet part out loud.
@jsende Agreed to a point, but it's done so within the (expanded) limits established by its predecessors, while letting McConnell/Ryan pursue a traditional legislative agenda on health care, taxes, finreg. Going for a capital-gains "fix" via exec order would be a shift from that dynamic.
If the imperial drift of the presidency can't be arrested, in the long run I would expect presidentialists (cc: @avermeule) to begin arguing for longer presidential terms.
Independent of constitutional questions, the Obama-Trump dialectic shows the practical problem w/Caesarism under our system; it creates dramatic policy whipsawing when WH changes parties, makes FP deals more uncertain and domestic policy more unpredictable/chaotic.
Thus far, despite his temperamental leanings, we haven't seen Caesarist moves from Trump as aggressive as what Obama attempted on immigration (and on other fronts) in the face of congressional gridlock. Clearly some supporters want that to change; will be interesting if it does.

@HeerJeet And Russia has no long-term incentive to have him behaving this way.
@HeerJeet I just think of Trump's behavior with Machado or the Khans -- he doesn't need a KGB handler to dig in to a position that he thinks his pride requires him to defend.
@baseballcrank There is, but if you can't credibly threaten to resign you really have no leverage over the president's behavior.
@HeerJeet I'm open to all possibilities these days. Just saying he's a pretty weird asset if he's an asset.
@baseballcrank They don't *all* have to resign to make a point. Coats has just been publicly knee-capped by the president; the natsec apparatus would survive his resignation.
Of course it would also be in character for Trump to be a Russian asset who's really terrible at the job.
One difficulty with the "Trump is a Russian asset" theory is that you would expect a real Russian asset to pretend he isn't one publicly while quietly pursuing pro-Russian policies behind the scenes; Trump has basically done the reverse.
It's completely understandable that the ppl running natsec in this WH don't want to resign and leave Trump alone w/the football for 2+ more years. But after today the principals who think they're indispensable should draw straws and one should go.

FTR Kavanaugh is Catholic too.
@jpodhoretz Yes, I agree. But on the other hand religion -- esp. religion practiced seriously in our secularized day -- has more direct and explicit intellectual influence than does ethnicity.
Again, religion mattering doesn't license bigotry. But religion matters. And in a society polarized in part between the religious and the irreligious, everybody knows it. /finis
Nor is this a new phenomenon; it's more of a recurrence. Here's a famous ruling, for instance, in which only one justice dissented from the elite view of Science and Progress and the arc of history. He was also the only devout Catholic on the court.	https://t.co/ArPlnOjF95
And if religious conservatives notice this -- and they do -- they/we can't expect progressives not to notice. Which doesn't license bigotry or ignorance or hystera. But ... you can't expect them not to notice.
In the same way, the fact that Barrett is a Catholic mom of seven tells you something -- not something dispositive, but something meaningful -- about where she's coming from and how she might rule. That's just reality.
For example: I think John Roberts might vote to overturn Roe because of my reading of his record (on other precedents and Obergefell, notably). But I also think that bc he's a Catholic w/two adopted kids whose wife was affiliated w/ Feminists for Life. The personal is judicial.
A big Q for conservative nominees has always been their willingness to row against the tide of elite culture on "arc of history"/"sexual modernity" issues. This is an issue of temperament and mindset, not just philosophy and resume. And religious commitment looms large there.
French is right, of course, to see bigotry at work in the way some progressive critics write about Barrett's faith. But if we're being honest it's that faith and not *just* her impressive credentials and judicial philosophy that makes her attractive to many conservatives.
I want to express a very mild disagreement with this piece from @DavidAFrench defending Amy Coney Barrett against bigoted attacks:	https://t.co/cdKFlC34lh
Honestly I just want Trump to nominate Barrett because I've waited my whole career for my firsthand knowledge of charismatic Catholicism to be relevant to a Supreme Court nomination.
@yeselson It doesn't make sense given the purpose of the House, I agree. But it's also something that's been anti-democratic for a long while; it's just that polarization has made it more striking/stinging.

@yeselson More seriously I am skeptical of scenarios where even a post-RBG court goes pre-Lochner. You're not going to have six Clarence Thomases.
@yeselson Depends on whether it has an individual mandate :)
@yeselson I find that scenario pretty implausible. (For now.)
@MTTAMehan I believe "that" is understood as "a bill that creates losers as well as winners."
@yeselson I think it ends more than Scotus if you're right.
Anyway if I were a norm-busting liberal I'd start with statehood for PR and DC, let court-packing wait.
@MTTAMehan And the lesson a lot of legislators in both parties seemed to take from the fate of the Dem majority after the ACA is, "let's never do that again."
Given the drift of the American regime we're more likely to eventually get court-packing as a way to legitimize power grabs of an imperial presidency rather than as a way to push some big progressive agenda through Congress.

History has lots of recurrences. Lots of rhymes and dramatic reversals. But you don't just keep blowing up Death Stars.
You could make a really embarrassingly obvious Trump-era allegory where the Resistance is fighting a demagogue who has taken over the New Republic with support from the imperial remnant ... and it would be a lot better than TLJ. Because it would be more like real history.

@chrislhayes It's still worth recognizing that the Obama WH wanted the capacity to do longer-term detention too. So giving the WH that capacity could return policy to what a Democratic WH wanted before the courts intervened.
@chrislhayes I both think Sharry's argument doesn't make any moral sense (keeping families together cannot be the same as splitting them up) but definitely understand strategically why Dems don't want to pay what seems like ransom.
@BenjySarlin @chrislhayes @baseballcrank I don't think the scale of the crisis merits what Trump has done, obviously. But there is an ongoing and, in the last year, worsening problem w/kids and families; the Obama WH tried to do family detention for precisely that reason.
@chrislhayes Does that mean that Democrats shouldn't participate in any legislative deal (apart from a simple acceptance of their bill) to end this bc it involves negotiating with a hostage taker?
@chrislhayes It can't both be true that Trump is doing something uniquely evil and that all forms of detention (inc. those present under Obama) are equally evil and so there can be no compromise, just automatic release.

And here's my Sunday column, with its pitch for E-Verify, to wrap up this thread:	https://t.co/ugoh82qfmJ
Bottom line: I agree w/Rich about the fecklessness of Congress, the no-good-options border situation, the convenient outrage of the press over problems/practices that date to the Obama era ... and yet that still isn't enough to let Trump off the hook for the specific evil here.
You can't say "we're being forced into this" if you didn't make any effort to sell the public and Congress on the alternative system before you chose this one. And the fact that the Trump WH doesn't do normal salesmanship/policymaking, bc incompetence, is an insufficient excuse.
... and even to the extent the WH as an organism does want a different policy it has still deliberately chosen to use separated and traumatized families as a bargaining chit to get that policy - and again, w/o even trying to make a public case for a Flores change first.
This is not something that can be excused, as Lowry does, by saying "despite some mixed messages, if the administration had its druthers, family units would be kept together and their cases settled quickly." For some WH ppl (incl. Trump) the "druthers" seem very different ...
This choice reflects 1) the belief among some ppl in the WH that the separation was a positive good, bc of its potential deterrent effect and 2) the willingness of the WH to do something exceedingly cruel in order to gain negotiating leverage.
Instead it chose to start separating kids *first*, without any public argument for/explanation for the policy whatsoever, and then only when ppl began freaking out did we get the call for legislative action, the attempt to add provisions into the House deal, etc.
... if the Trump WH were 1) normal and 2) decent, it could have reacted to the increase in family migrants by making a public case for Congress to act to make family detention easier, while trying to arm-twist a targeted bill through.
Lowry's right that this is a fiendishly complex problem, right that it predates Trump, right that there's a case for holding families longer than the Flores decree permits, right that Congress is a bad actor (as usual) in all this. But ...

So as Trump-era scenarios for North Korea go, I'm still at "it could be worse" on this one. /finis
And if and when it fails we will, most likely, still have troops in South Korea and the ability to wipe North Korea off the map. And Pyongyang will have gained a taste of normalized life and bought a couple more years that the current status quo was going to give them anyway.
The point of this effort is to accomplish something different, to make Kim feel like he has a lot to gain from normalization, to make the Vietnamese model seem attractive. And if it fails it will fail for very different reasons than prior denuclearization deals.
Also the claim that "he needs to get commitments on paper" is strange since across 30 yrs of containment and negotiation we *have* gotten them on paper and each time it's proven mostly worthless.
Peaceful denuclearization has never been a particularly plausible scenario ; certainly less so after Qaddafi's fate. What Trump is trying may flop but it doesn't seem obviously dumber than 15 more yrs of frozen conflict in which Pyongyang's rockets keep widening their range.
And it needs to be assessed on its own terms, where the endgame is a North with nukes but a somewhat milder authoritarianism, rather than simply compared to efforts that set denuclearization as the primary goal with normalization to follow.
Is it going to work? Quite probably not, not least because the Kim regime may really still envision all of this as a means to the conquest or at least Finlandization of the South. But in a landscape with no good options, it's an option we haven't really tried.
What we're selling to Kim is the chance to become like Vietnam or China or Laos: A one-party state with a more open economy and a more relaxed military posture. This is @tylercowen's argument and as a description of what Trump is pitching it's correct:	https://t.co/0ToY1cK7Qb
This isn't a denuclearization strategy, obviously, no matter what Pompeo may be obliged to claim. This a normalization strategy. When Trump tells people that he's dealing with the nuclear threat that's what he means.
I expect Trump's North Korea gambit to fail, because I have a low opinion of Trump's capabilities. But I think the critical coverage that says "he isn't getting anything in writing, he's getting less than Norks promised in the past" isn't describing his strategy accurately.

@jbarro @DanFosterType @ezraklein This deep in the Trump era and you're really still an atheist?
Somehow the ongoing @JonahNRO versus Seb Gorka dustup is much more entertaining because, being blocked by Gorka, I can only see Jonah's side of the argument.
So any new national story (if such a story can be written) needs to incorporate insights from the old story's skeptics even as it retains a basic admiration for our past. Which, again, sometimes requires putting reactionary and radical ideas together, risky as that might be.
Also, and relatedly, American conservatives in particular need to recognize that the national story -- very Protestant and very Enlightenment-friendly -- that bound our country together in the past has a lot less resonance for an emerging America.
So it seems like a good time to listen to those critics, while also maintaining an awareness of the evils to which their politics are sometimes heir, in order to figure out a way forward that doesn't just end in opioids and gated communities, soma and VR.
What seems less remote is the scenario we're actually inhabiting, where liberalism is 1) still basically unchallenged, Viktor Orban notwithstanding and 2) manifesting many of the problems (alienation, stratification, etc) that critics on the left and right identified in the past.
I think there are obvious dangers in anti-Enlightenment thought, whether it takes right-wing or left-wing or some overlapping far-left/far-right form. At the same time the scenario where @jbouie and I team up to take down Lockean liberalism seems pretty remote at the moment.

@asymmetricinfo @ebruenig @RiverTamYDN @Roflsaurus16 @conor64 He doesn't exactly have a system. But the Jungian stuff has a reactionary valence that people aren't wrong to discern.
@ebruenig @conor64 I don't think Peterson is exactly a liberal which is part of why people find him more interesting/enraging than some of the IDW set.
@willwilkinson Okay. But then Harvard is an "inclusive institution" save for its legacy admissions. And yet ... it is not remotely inclusive.
@willwilkinson Mmmm. I think many of those economic trends go hand in hand with a meritocratic system of talent cultivation, which by its nature hardens class-based hierarchies while increasing (to a point) upper-class race/gender diversity.
@willwilkinson What is an "inclusive institution" for your purposes?
@willwilkinson I agree about the old hierarchies part. But part of Trump's appeal was also to the different kind of egalitarianism that existed alongside them, when you could have the American Dream somewhere besides a $5000 one-bedroom in San Jose.
@willwilkinson But that's my eccentricity.
@willwilkinson Of course my other view on this front is that unborn life is this era's periphery in which liberals discover that science (oh, happy science!) gives them a license to kill.
@willwilkinson The trajectory of California that you were discussing earlier today, for instance, does not exactly suggest a world of ever-greater inclusion so much as a world swapping one kind of hierarchy for another.
@willwilkinson Yes (to a point) the hierarchies that privilege white men qua white men have weakened. Educational hierarchies, OTOH ...
@willwilkinson Not clear to me that American society is getting less hierarchical, which is why your analysis of the progressive side of things perhaps needs a little more cynicism.
@MTTAMehan @JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 And I'll happily take the dike. But you can see why people are looking for alternatives besides an endless supply of Odoacers.
@MTTAMehan @JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 Oh, I think the cooperation is obviously continuing, and I think it should. But as a political strategy it's stuck constructing what it once critiqued: a judicial dike against the trend in popular opinion.
@go_oat @MTTAMehan @JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 Although that applies to all my pro-Stuart tweets as well.
@go_oat @MTTAMehan @JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 There could probably be slightly less LARPing though.
@go_oat The Holy Father has urged us to build bridges so I'm trying to do my part.
@MTTAMehan @JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 Fair. But we're in a period where what was understood as the practical approach, evangelicals and Catholics together, seems to have foundered, and its Trumpian successor is not as appealing to everyone as it appears to be to John.
@MTTAMehan @JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 Aren't Hungary and Poland potential Christian republics? They seem to talk a lot about them in my experience.
@JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 @MTTAMehan But everybody else, from Vermeule to Zmirak, seems to *really like* disagreeing, so apparently I'm wrong :)
@JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 @MTTAMehan My own provisional view is that a Christian-Democratic model remains the most plausible near-term Catholic response to our situation, and we can agree to disagree on questions about whether it's a goal or a way station.
@JZmirak @michaelbd @jneeley78 @MTTAMehan Sure but like the Poles he's also looking for an alternative to Anglo-American models of capitalism, which is a bigger practical element in integralist thinking right now than the Mortara case.
@jneeley78 @JZmirak @MTTAMehan Yeah to the extent they have a practical agenda the integralist-friendly Catholics are generally citing Hungary and Poland as potential models.
@mattyglesias To some extent, yes. But the new alignment is likely to be pretty unstable.
@JZmirak @MTTAMehan @jneeley78 I agree that Francis is stoking integralism. But so is the defeat of the Neuhaus project and the cultural realities of late capitalism, to which a Locke-friendly Catholicism doesn't have sufficient answers at the moment.
@JZmirak @MTTAMehan @jneeley78 Monarchy seemed to play a useful role in manumission elsewhere :)
@MTTAMehan @JZmirak @jneeley78 That's a fair point re: the latter. Not entirely sure how the Civil War plays in Deneenian analysis.
@JZmirak @MTTAMehan @jneeley78 I don't think integralism's critics are engagingly sufficiently with why it's increasingly appealing, even though you're scoring plenty of practical points against its (fairly nebulous) alternative.
@JZmirak @MTTAMehan @jneeley78 America is a more successful polity than many. OTOH we spent the first fifty years building up to exactly the kind of bloody religious war liberalism is supposed to prevent, and then fifty years after that (per your reading) an anti-Christian progressivism started taking over.

Yes, saying "the Enlightenment invented racism" is obviously a provocation that requires defining racism in very specific terms. But people who are literate and interested in debate (of which there are at least seventeen on this website) should be able to understand his point.
To formally throw in with @jbouie: That the Enlightenment was and remains a mixed bag whose intellectual-political-economic matrix made racism worse for a while (and may again, who knows?) is neither a radical nor an ignorant opinion.

@ChuckLane1 I guess I'd say that both the development of the EEC and Ostpolitik look forward to a continental politics shaped more by Germany than Anglo-Americans and NATO.
@ChuckLane1 Yes I think that's a fair amendment; I meant to suggest that West German policy started tacitly working in this direction well before unification, but it probably came across as overstatement.
And the more the Anglo-Americans become peripheral to the EU, the more powerful that impulse may become. Which will continue to make EU/Visegrad group politics much more complicated than a freedom/unfreedom dichotomy suggested by some observers. /finis
This is another way in which the old lines of empire are as important as any liberal/authoritarian divide. The Germans still often seem to see eastern European nations as inconveniences, Moscow as a potential great-power partner.
The German elite is considerably more Russia-friendly than the Western liberals writing in anguish about Putin, and certainly more Russia-friendly than the populists in Poland.
Second, I didn't discuss the German-Russian relationship, which is another reason why the story of a Putin-formulated illiberal bacillus spreading westward and resisted by Angela Merkel Leader of the Free World is way too simplistic.
If France ever abandons the EU project it will fall; if France can curb Germany's most blinkered tendencies the project is more likely to succeed; if France wants to take more of a full leadership role in the imperium it ... will be interesting.

Which makes them more concerning than, say, a regional/cultic form of Catholicism that isn't perfectly orthodox but inspires some intense devotions. But that's just my take; it could be a misjudgment.
My problem with some of the just-possibly-heretical tendencies in present-day liberal Catholicism is 1) that they seem particularly religiously sterile overall and 2) that they aspire to control the teaching authority of the church.
But here I'm actually a bit of a latitudinarian: I think an orthodox Catholicism should have a relatively tolerant relationship to heretical tendencies in certain contexts, and recognize that their ebb and flow is inevitable and sometimes in the long run fruitful for the church.
Likewise he's right that "weird" Catholicism is not identical to Perfect Catholic Orthodoxy and often flourishes in quasi-heretical and syncretistic environments.
But even so the aesthetic shift toward the modernist and minimalist and secular in post-VII Catholicism -- in norms of clerical dress, church architecture, church decoration, music and more -- remains striking, dramatic, and obvious.
He's absolutely right that the pre-Vatican II church never featured all the pomps of a high TLM as some sort of norm of Catholic practice and experience.

The opening of last night's episode, for instance, echoed the hatch and Desmond on "Lost." But by the end of last night's episode we basically understood the whys and wherefores of the opening's mystery, which is the opposite of how "Lost" operated.
I understand disliking "Westworld"; it has a lot of flaws, including the aforesaid lack of humanism. But it's pretty clearly not doing the "it's all about the journey, MAN" thing with its mysteries that "Lost" did.
"Westworld" is just like "Lost" ... if "Lost" didn't spend nearly as much time on character development and resolved its mysteries pretty quickly instead of pretending they didn't matter.

@DamonLinker I don't think the Bush tax cuts were a big betrayal of Catholic social teaching, esp. given how much he was spending elsewhere. I'd say waterboarding not the death penalty was the place of too much silence. Yes to the last point.
@DamonLinker I tend to think so too but the searches of Cohen do suggest a higher level of possible legal jeopardy than just sex and campaign-finance stuff.
But of course that's too simple, as I'm sure Walther will point out when he writes this piece I've assigned him.
In this sense the best advice one might send back through time is simple: "If your alliance with evangelicals seems to have gained political power, DON'T INVADE IRAQ!!"
Compassionate conservatism was, in part, the brainchild of evangelicals who wanted to import CST to fill the void Walther discerns in their own tradition. It had lots of flaws but it did move the GOP temporarily in a more Catholic-friendly direction.
On the political front, I think the main thing Walther underestimates is how much, circa 2000, it seemed that conservative Catholics were succeeding in getting elite evangelicals to embrace parts of Catholic Social Teaching (while peeling off some of them as converts).
And ecclesiological advice, too. Should large numbers conservative Catholics circa 1980 have joined the SSPX instead of putting their hopes in JPII? That's a trad counterfactual I'd like to read.
The piece I want @matthewwalther to write is a letter back through time to conservative Catholics in the '70s giving them concrete and specific political-theological advice.	https://t.co/1YNRBCdaBH

So by all means, hire more socialists and radicals. Just don't use it as an excuse for willed-incuriosity about the world outside the liberal-left debate.
And Levitz's own magazine, with its still more liberal readership, is better for having @sullydish (and @hpmacd's conservative-splaining book reviews, for that matter).
That's an idea with many defenders. They are, however, wrong. It's good that the my employer (and the Post) prefers not to simply become the Guardian, however generally liberal our orientation and readership. The Atlantic's "no party or clique" mission is likewise worthwhile.
Of course implicit in Levitz's argument and explicit it in his headline is the idea that MSM should, in this age of conservative disarray, simply concede that it IS the liberal media that its conservative detractors have described it as for years.
Now if you think that the Times could do better than me and Bret as embodiments/exponents of our respective worldviews -- well you might be right! But that's an argument for having different conservatives, not for having a MSM that doesn't bother with conservatives at all.
Just the differences between myself and my colleague @BretStephensNYT, for instance, with whom I disagree about a *lot* even as we're both clearly on the right, are a useful instruction in the tensions dividing the ideological formation that governs many Western countries.
If you are bored by these arguments you're incurious; if you aren't aware of them you aren't being kept informed. And a magazine or newspaper that claims to offer a wide-spectrum as opposed to narrowly ideological view of the world and excludes them isn't doing its job.
These arguments aren't shaping Trumpian policymaking because nothing is likely to shape Trumpian policymaking. But it is very likely that they'll shape future formations of right-wing and centrist policy, and have influence on the liberal-left debate Levitz cites as well.
You've got conservatives representing the center-right flank of #TheResistance, conservatives experimenting with European-style nationalism and Catholic integralism, conservatives for isolation and internationalism and everything in between.
This T.A. Frank feature is a good rundown of how, in some ways, there hasn't been a more interesting time to read conservatives arguing with one another since the '70s or '50s:	https://t.co/9FczbwjTQs
But the idea that bc the GOP under Trump is ideologically paralyzed (mostly true) the intra-conservative intellectual conversation is boring  and paralyzed as well is ... not at all true. Indeed it's the opposite of true.
He's also correct that most conservative writers don't represent where the GOP is right now, and so the case for hiring/publishing conservatives rests on their/our interestingness more than their "representation" of the Trump admin.
Levitz is correct that there are lots of interesting left-versus-liberal debates that deserve a wider airing in establishment organs. He could have just written that half of the piece without the pandering first half, but oh well.
A couple of thoughts about this piece, which is kind enough to spare me from its purge (somebody's got to write the sex robots pieces, I guess):	https://t.co/aVKGQ6JavG
@lymanstoneky @willwilkinson Also "positive/negative feelings bout change" is a possible proxy for "how is my community doing" as opposed to just "what's the current state of my income."
@Noahpinion @latenitenoah The "Chad and Stacey" theory is obviously one particularly toxic and angry subculture's take, with all the limits on its perspective that entails. Which is why I deliberately talked much more generally about the question.
@Noahpinion @latenitenoah The "others" I had in mind, as I said in the piece, include not only unhappy young straight men but many other groups, male and female, as well.
@Noahpinion @latenitenoah I wrote that the sexual revolution privileges "the beautiful and rich and socially adept in new ways," and relegates "others to new forms of loneliness and frustration."
@Noahpinion @latenitenoah Interesting thread, but when exactly did I argue that sexual modernity leads to a massive concentration of partners for men?
Though I should also say that my experience of Real Time has always been very positive, and this time I spent the afterparty arguing about the historicity of the gospel narratives with @billmaher and @anamariecox; who could ask for anything more?

@emilynussbaum Ideas can be staples of academic-left thought (or libertarian thought, for that matter) while remaining extreme relative to how most people tend to think about sexual desire.
@emilynussbaum And I might suggest that you're sufficiently versed in/immersed in feminist thinking that some of its radicalism doesn't seem as radical to you as it might to the kind of person who reads op-ed pages but not the LRB.
@emilynussbaum I think the essay is a bit more ambitious than that.
@bdmcclay I think there's a good future where Srinivasan-style arguments converge w/feminist-influenced Christianity, but in the bad future parts of her vision get deployed as cover for sex workers and sex robots.
13. Plus an interesting follow-up by Hanson on why economics should be creepy. Okay, now I'm really done.	https://t.co/3tusGHs5Da
12. And here's the LRB essay, again, because nobody seemed to read it.	https://t.co/xq18QeW252
11. Which you should, even if you still hate my piece. Thanks for reading.
10. But the column was trying to just focus on sex, not the bigger picture. And it was arguing that to better understand this future you should read "creepy" libertarians and strange essays by idealistic left-academics.
9. And of course sexlessness is part of a larger story about loneliness, lost interpersonal contact, etc., that will also conjure up attempted market solutions, like the actors you can hire to play family members in Japan.
8. I THINK THIS APPROACH IS BAD. Worse than my own conservative ideas, worse than the feminist-egalitarian-utopian alternative. Frankly dystopian, in fact. But also the most likely near-future "fix" for the problem of sexlessness.
7. Instead I think the likely response will be commercial-technical approach dressed in the language of social justice and libertarianism. The left pushes for normalizing sex work, the techno-futurist right for virtual sex, and this combination presents as a tacit "right to sex."
6. More people, esp. more young people, are attracted to this option than to the conservative one. I think it has an admirable idealism in certain respects. I also think it's much too utopian, cuts against essential grains of human sexual nature.
5. Another possibility: A left-feminist-egalitarian response which uses politics and education and other levers to gradually remake the socio-sexual landscape so that beauty standards and attraction itself become more egalitarian, more people are attracted to more people.
4. But few people seem to want that, organized religion is in decline, public Christian leadership is captured by partisanship, social cons haven't figured out how to assimilate feminist insights. So odds of that response happening are low.
3. How might the culture respond? One possibility is conservative and tacitly religious: Re-emphasis on chastity, monogamy, value of celibacy, etc., plus desexualization of pop culture.
2. This means the "incel" phenomenon isn't just reducible to its toxic violent misogynistic form; there's a large sexless population (not just young and male but female, older, gay, etc.) caught in a psychic vice btw the culture's obsession w/sex and its absence from their lives.
1. American society presents an interesting combination: Our cultural norms and prevailing messages have dramatically elevated the importance of sex to the good life; at the same time, we are increasingly failing to successfully pair people off.
All right, let's see if I can write a short thread restating the argument of yesterday's column in ways that are less amenable to misinterpretation. Here we go.
Good night, Twitter.
Or more aptly, I suppose, it's about the "incel" phenomenon as something much bigger than its craziest and most toxic manifestation.
The piece is not really about the incels.
@michaelbd Somebody should write a column about how the logic of late capitalism pushes people toward exactly this kind of thinking.
@Noahpinion @lymanstoneky Which in turn feels a little more comfortable taking up certain conservative-ish ideas in a way feminists didn't under Clinton, because they feel like the larger socon project has been routed. Except when they watch The Handmaid's Tale.
@Noahpinion @lymanstoneky Certainly. But as a reforming movement in its own right it's mostly lost/been rejected lately, leaving the field to feminism.
@Noahpinion @lymanstoneky This is why I'm generally favorable to #meToo. But I also think feminism has an essential utopianism problem and the way forward is a socon/feminist hybrid. But since nobody seems to want that, we'll get freemartins and feelies.
@Noahpinion @lymanstoneky To the extent I don't, it's because even deep structural shifts can produce social and cultural reform movements that tame and mitigate their evils:	https://t.co/tAHKruqYIn
@Noahpinion @lymanstoneky To the extent that I agree with you, and in part I do, that's why my column ends with inevitabilism about the further attempt to address disappointment with consumerization through further consumerization.
When so many descriptions of an argument are unrecognizable to its author, that usually suggests the author failed in some important way. Still, I think hostile readers should consider re-reading the piece and I'll try to have some further thoughts a bit later.

@michaelbd His pitying psychoanalysis of Alfie's father, in particular, was truly an act of great judicial insight against which mere parental feeling must give way.
@michaelbd I don't think you can have read the judge's incredibly lucid ruling, Michael, which should lay all doubt to rest.
Archbishop Paglia, the head of the renovated Pontifical Academy for Life, has managed to get out "ahead" of Francis in both the Charlie Gard and Evans cases, and found himself tugged back.
Euthanasia and end-of-life issues are the area where certain of Francis's appointees and allies (or would-be allies) seem to be running furthest ahead of where the pope himself wants the church to go.

Hopefully I'll have a few moments for regret before the guillotine's blade falls.
I'm generally pro-engagement (not least bc I have reactionary/radical flirtations myself). But I also think - w/Matthews - that sclerosis/stagnation rather than sudden revolution is the great danger for our society, which means I could be too blithe about radicalism's own perils.
Controversies as diverse as the Mortara business at First Things and my own newspaper's Quinn Norton affair have that question in the background: In a time of general disillusionment w/consensus, do you engage with radical viewpoints or simply try to defend a besieged center?
He raises a point that haunts a lot of intramural journalistic/intellectual debates these days: If the larger system is sclerotic and smart people are flirting with radicalism, should establishment institutions/organs engage w/the radicalism or try to exclude it?

Chik-Fil-A IS integralism.
@Chateaubriand__ Thirtysomething bump probably has something do with parenthood.
@Chateaubriand__ Lots of sociological data on ppl overestimating church attendance; I think 40 percent on surveys probably translates to 25 percent or so in reality.
@HeerJeet It's a sign of immigrant success in America when their stereotypes can be played with on TV without giving huge offense -- like Jews in Seinfeld, for instance.
@HeerJeet So if you purge a figure like Apu -- quite likeable, certainly no more egregious than the other stereotypes on the show -- you end up with less representation in the end. And if you "correct" him he's just boring.
@HeerJeet The challenge here is that a lot of sociological comedy depends on the concept of what you might call the "friendly stereotype" -- a charming exaggeration of a particular identity or type.

Also Smith is very good on the pastoral strengths of the document, so don't just listen to my carping, go read him and it.
This is a specific example of a general trend, where the Holy Father's seeming balancing act early in the pontificate -- the attempt to direct critiques both leftward and rightward, as it were -- has become a lecture delivered only to conservatives.
In the latest document though it seems more like they're both just variations on the same critique of conservative rigidity -- the gnostics being sticklers for abstract doctrines, per Francis, and the pelagians sticklers for moral rules.
One particularly noteworthy point: When Francis began using the Gnostic/Pelagian combination of critiques early in his papacy, it seemed like the former was a critique of liberal tendencies and the latter of conservative temptations.

If I had an assignment for fantasists, it would be to re-read The Hobbit, Earthsea and maybe Narnia before they start on each new volume. Just as a mild inoculation against the disease of the modern fantasy novel -- its addiction to world-expansion at the expense of plot. /finis
Whereas the most successful recent series as a finished whole, Tad Williams's Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, had some bloat but still managed to wrap things up in three books like old JRR.
So many of the modern fantasies I've liked have been killed by bloat, from The Wheel of Time to now increasingly A Song of Ice and Fire. And Rothfuss finished his second novel seven years ago; as with Martin his fans are stuck waiting.
Sprawl has its charms. I liked the Potter books' Dickensian side; I enjoyed some of Rothfuss's digressions. But generally both Tolkien and Le Guin offer reminders of how often less can be so much more.
... which is similar in a way to Le Guin's, and also in a way to the Potter novels (reckless young wizard at wizarding school, etc.), they take a thousand pages (literally) to get where Le Guin gets in two hundred.
Before I started in on "A Wizard of Earthsea" the last fantasies I read were "The Name of the Wind" and "Wise Man's Fear," by Patrick Rothfuss, both big fat bestsellers. They were interesting books, uneven but also very inventive. But when it came to advancing their story ...
A brief thought vaguely related to the latest Harry Potter arguments. I've been simultaneously reading The Hobbit to my kids and re-reading the first of Le Guin's Earthsea novels. With both one thing has been remarkable to re-encounter: Their extraordinary narrative compression.

I don't have a big takeaway here beyond the larger ones offered in, yes, my book, which I invite you the purchase and read; there's more on Scalfari inside.	https://t.co/c4VUgyllpl
They aren't proof that "the pope is a heretic!" or something like that because they aren't designed to be proof of anything. The point is to open debates while maintaining uncertainty and deniability about how far you're actually going.
So whether or not they are technically part of the official magisterium these interviews are clearly understood by Francis as part of his broad strategy of engagement - which, as in other areas, often involves extending permissions for heterodox ideas via ambiguous formulations.
Yet despite their (possible) unreliability, the pope keeps coming back to Scalfari; he gave one of these interviews, for instance, after the big debate over communion for the remarried, in which Scalfari quoted him taking a maximally liberal position.
This one is no exception. Also unexceptional is the Vatican response, which basically says, we can't vouch for the reliability of the interview, it's not the official teaching of the church, don't ask us about this.	https://t.co/drB31VXF8p
Scalfari apparently does not record or take notes; he quotes the pope from his nonagenarian's memory. In almost every interview, one or more of those quotes has featured the pope saying something that would be pretty wild for a pope to say.
The pope's striking comments on hell were published as part of an interview with Eugenio Scalfari, a ninety-three year-old Italian atheist journalist to whom Francis has given five (I think) interviews so far in his pontificate.

@HeerJeet Which is not to say your general point about the consensus is wrong. But the specific way Trump polarized things make opposition to him a problematic heuristic.
@HeerJeet Williamson's distinctive mix of hard libertarianism on some questions and social conservatism seems pretty different from the views of, say, my colleagues Brooks and Stephens.

@SethAMandel What's the best piece expressing your view, or something close to it, of how the US should prioritize threats? I'm open to different possibilities. I just don't see, from Bolton, a clear prioritization. Which seems to me, again, to increase certain risks.
@SethAMandel In part because we were not satisfied with defeating ISIS and wanted to shift back into a hawkish posture toward Assad, no?
@SethAMandel I am making no such case. I am arguing that 1) the pure-hawk track record, to the extent it exists, looks worse than either realists *or* neocons and 2) that Bolton's stated commitments, which may change, would overextend us militarily and court bigger disasters than Obama did.
@SethAMandel *Trump* had a theory. De-escalate w/Russia/Assad, focus more on Islamic State. To the extent that seemed to bear fruit, I praised him for it.	https://t.co/3PuwthgabG
@SethAMandel Every use of force is not the same. But I've been reading Bolton for years and he does not advance a theory enabling me to tell which uses of force he would prioritize and where he thinks we might de-escalate; his default response to all major recent threats has been escalation.
@SethAMandel All these categories are a little arbitrary! But Bolton has an explicit record favoring escalatory measures in every major theater. I don't quite grasp the theory that his hawkishness is a means to de-escalation, except insofar as people can change their position in power.
@SethAMandel I mean, he might, as I say at the end -- but only if he shifts away from his stated positions.
@SethAMandel But why would Bolton restrain the realists when he's officially in favor of ... more shooting wars?
@SethAMandel With more words I would have said more about Obama's alignments, and where they failed. But all those failures still don't me think much better of Cheneyism.
@SethAMandel I wrote a lot about the collapse of Obama's FP in his second term. But this was a column about the hawks' record as against other Republican factions/alignments.
@SethAMandel If you think the US is too close to an accidental war with Russia why *isn't* a more hawkish tilt in the Trump FP a reasonable reason for concern?
@SethAMandel The counterpoint might be that wars on that scale are only possible w/public opinion shaped by the post/9/11 moment, so even a very hawkish Trump admin would be necessarily constrained in ways the Bush admin wasn't in 2002-2003.
@SethAMandel Except for Iraq/Afghanistan though almost all US efforts have been limited interventions or brushfire wars. The conflicts Bolton officially favors (though maybe not as fully as he says), Iran and esp. North Korea, would a big departure from US policy outside the post-9/11 window.
@SethAMandel They all have -- but if the status quo is already hawkish, then an administration run by hawks could still be uniquely conflict-prone.

@IChotiner @michaelbd I don't blame anyone for Gibson's trajectory except himself (and Satan). And the anti-semitic tropes people saw in "The Passion" were really there.
@IChotiner @michaelbd And certainly some people consciously choose to become the caricature because it profits them. I'd put someone like Dinesh D'Souza in this camp.
@IChotiner @michaelbd Caricatures generally capture something that there's already. At the same time even Sarah Palin governed Alaska differently from how she sold herself to Fox viewers post-2008.
@michaelbd Which is how lightning-rod figures become the caricatures of themselves that their opponents draw.

@jonathanchait @mattyglesias That's still an important Q for liberals to ponder as they contemplate the Trump era.

The Kirkus review calls it a "balanced investigation." That may not be *quite* true (I can think of a few Catholics who will disagree!) but it was one of my goals: To write something explaining Francis's significance to the curious even as it describes the perils of his course.
The book is obviously of particular interest for Catholics and particular particular interest for skeptics of Pope Francis. But it's also written as a general-audience explainer of Francis-era controversy, with a fair amount of doubt about my own position along with the critique.

@mattyglesias I accept the snark, but except for when it encourages them to play the Milo part conservative students are not really the losers from the present situation.
@mattyglesias I agree that "crisis" is an overused phrase. But there is a seeming trend toward no-platforming plus a decline in faculty ideological diversity plus an increasing sense among students that their campus cultures deter speech, esp. for conservatives.
I have some thoughts on how this relates to certain op-ed page debates that I will keep to myself.
But it's bad for the country and intellectual life if campuses become more like the conservative-free zones they already are. So the no-platforming/free speech business is a sharpened illustration of a general unfortunate trend.
Generally I think there's a mutual radicalization dynamic between the right and academia that's toxic for both, though I also think the left's attempts to remoralize universities are somewhat understandable given the moral vacuity of the center-left administrative culture.
Since Trump's election with some notable exceptions like Middlebury and Berkeley there has been less campus unrest than I expected, and seemingly less than in the 24 months before his victory. Which is interesting (if true).
The turn in Republican opinion against colleges was a reaction to this wave, which is why it started before Trump's nomination and presidency but also helped his rise.	https://t.co/YvWQJfjSma
My impression is that there was a surge of campus protest of various kinds around 2015 and into 2016, which were less about speech restrictions per se than an attempt by activists to push college admins and academic culture leftward in a more general way.
... and an apparent rise in no-platforming efforts at American colleges:	https://t.co/GDtRnVq9LN

But the degree of uncertainty and wild variation in what has become the major tool in Official Medicine's treatment of a major human problem should make you very doubtful of a clear distinction between Official Medicine and personal medical experimentation.
What Alexander is highlighting, btw, is not evidence that "people shouldn't use anti-depressants." (He certainly doesn't think so.) Depression is terrible and people are helped by them and their prescription and use is reasonable.

@JonahNRO Maranatha!
@ThePlumLineGS @robertwrighter I think the NRA has devolved in ways that are also unhealthy for our politics, and have written as much, including in this thread.
@DamonLinker @robertwrighter That's the goal. But NRA's favorability ratings are higher than those of the GOP, and ppl who are gun-friendly ID with it even when they don't belong. So it's going to be a polarizing move. Maybe a worthwhile one; that depends on your theory of social/political change.
@robertwrighter But I also don't think eliminating them as a Big Corporate Statement after a school shooting achieves much, and as I said I think the Dick's move is both genuinely responsible and less of a pointless "melt the NRA snowflakes" move.
@robertwrighter The status quo ante was neither healthy nor unhealthy because nobody was paying much attention to these discounts. I think the NRA has its own increasingly full-spectrum partisanship to blame for its members' discounts becoming vulnerable.
@robertwrighter We can stipulate that a lot of conservatives manifest the same vices as a lot of leftists, certainly. My own columns about campus lefties have generally tried to take them seriously.
@DanFosterType I'm sorry, man, but if it's meaner it's probably better.
@robertwrighter The theory that you have to isolate and crush conservatives with a united front of all nonpolitical institutions may work this time, or next time, or the time after that. But so far we have President Donald Trump.
@robertwrighter You can argue it the other way: That you need to socially disfavor the NRA to make legislative change happen. I'm just skeptical that making weakly-attached NRA members feel like they're being unfairly targeted will ultimately have that effect.
@robertwrighter I don't think the discounts airlines choose to offer are particularly morally important either way. But in context the airline moves can be read as moral statements about gun owners as a class, while Dick's move is focused on particular guns and particular buyers.
Fwiw, the Dick's decision seems like a much healthier way of expressing a liberal-leaning form of corporate social responsibility than the airline/rental car company approach.
@mattyglesias @BenjySarlin @DKThomp And I'm open to further firearm regulation.
@mattyglesias @BenjySarlin @DKThomp To clarify: I agree that David's description of how he experiences gun ownerships doesn't fit the aggregate data on how guns are used. I'm just saying that as with alternative medicine at the *individual* level the decision can be quite rational.
@BenjySarlin @DKThomp I'm pretty confident David is right about his own case.
@DKThomp ... esp. if you've experienced a law enforcement failure or a medical crisis that official medicine can't help you with, the decisions to self-protect or effectively conduct medical experiments on yourself seem more reasonable.
@DKThomp That approach can lead you *into* cults, and lots of alternative medicines don't work, as lots of gun purchases lead to accidents instead of protecting you. But ...
@DKThomp Yes but alternative medicine isn't really an "emotional cult." It's a reasonable risk-reward based approach to problems the existing authorities just tell you you have to live with.
@roddreher @matthewschmitz It avoids it because the pope isn't prepared the stop the German bishops, and neither is anybody else.

Which is what I suspect would happen even in the scenario liberals fear -- a major terrorist attack that he tries to exploit. He would try to play the presidential part, he would fail, and outside his base the reaction would just be "how can this guy be POTUS?"
So the net effect of the tragedy is just to remind people how bad Trump is at being president, not to highlight policy flexibility. And so his numbers go down.
But Trump has no deftness. He wants to sling red meat. And he can't help himself: He has to make it all about him and say stupid stuff - the usual Trumpian repertoire.
The ban bump stocks/raise age limit/expand background checks combination would be a way a normal GOP president might pivot to the center in this context, breaking (modestly) with the NRA or trying to bring them along.
He has tried, or people inside the White House have tried, to respond to Parkland, the way a normal, even politically savvy administration might. Meet with victims. Promise new policies. Shift a bit when public opinion shifts.
This week is a good case study of why it's so hard to imagine Trump ever having approval ratings above 42 percent, let alone being genuinely popular.

@mattyglesias Trump's presidency so far has definitely challenged the common-among-pundits assumption that there is some necessary link between being intellectually and morally serious and doing okay at economic governance.
@jpodhoretz @michaelbd That's true, which is why Nixon occupies such a weird place in the official movement conservative narrative.
@mattyglesias Put another way: Trump showed that you could move to the center while heightening, not downplaying, the paranoid style in the right-wing politics.
@mattyglesias Oh, I agree with that. But he did it instinctually, not as some Let's Be Serious About Governing move.
Now go enjoy CPAC everyone.
And also that at some level movement conservatism *never* quite reached a place where it was fully capable of governing, that it never fully transcended its insurgent/populist beginnings, and what's happening now is just that reality being particularly starkly exposed.
Which as @michaelbd suggests makes this is a useful time to recognize that the arc-of-conservatism story, however morally and intellectually salutary, was imposed on a past that was in reality much more messy and contingent and bizarre.
And it's the last fact that makes this era particularly disorienting for anyone who believed in a "mature, stiff-arm the extremists, win converts, then govern" narrative of the conservative past. The chaos seems incompatible w/power, and yet here we are.
But in fact these are just potted histories that don't account for contingency and choas, as the Trump era is amply demonstrating. The right seems in no way prepared to govern, it nominated a celebrity conspiracy theorist for president ... and yet it rules DC.
And in a similar, albeit more modest way, a lot of GWB admirers in 2000-2004 would say that he restored a kind of order to a movement and party that had lost its way in the fever swamps of the Clinton years.
So ppl on the right will concede that conservatism was unready to govern in '64, that Reagan wouldn't have been Reagan if he'd gone straight from the movies to the WH, that you needed Buckley and then the neoconservatives to make '80 and the right-of-center majority possible.
That is, a lot of conservatives (and not only conservatives) accepted a narrative arc of political history in which you have these kind of messy, anarchic periods and then someone comes along and imposes order and only THEN do you take power.
I think what's startling and disorienting about the current moment to many more high-minded conservatives, esp. from the older generation, is not the mess per se but the fact that the right is such a mess AND yet maintains its hold on political power.

And to end this too-long thread, I'm curious what he thinks of the @DavidAFrench proposal making the rounds. /finis	https://t.co/TI6MKeagWQ
I'm happy to defer to @seanmdav in the feasibility of regulations and their likely burdens; my own suggestion may be foolish. But I'm unpersuaded that no plausible regulation, for this problem or others, can coexist naturally and reasonably w/a basic pro-2nd amendment vision.
I appreciate the frustration of gun owners with a pundit class that isn't exactly versed in the details the hardware. But there is also something frustrating about the two-step of first critiquing ignorance of gun details and then saying details don't matter, only liberty does.
Because some of them seem reasonable, non-liberty-destroying, and seem to do some good mitigating dangers of gun availability. And if so, I'm not clear why we *cannot* entertain any regulation tailored to a particular problem of young men trying to one-up each other's massacres.
As I said in the column I'm basically sympathetic to the liberty argument. But I'm still unclear about what Davis thinks about regulations we have on the books -- existing age limits, the machine gun ban, background checks, etc. Are *these* pointless liberty infringements?
Finally @seanmdav argues that this nitpicking over types of gun is beside the point, that the liberty interest of gun owners is what needs to be defended here, especially since evil people will always find ways to attempt their crimes.
Also you see very few recent mass shootings featuring shotguns, bolt-action rifles, etc. Whether rifles or handguns, semi-automatic weapons are almost always the weapons of choice.
Four of the top five mass shootings in the US by body count did, for instance, and on this list of recent shootings you can see a greater deadliness in the semi-auto rifle cases:	https://t.co/phyGdzCHGY
Second Davis argues that mass shooters can be just as deadly with a handgun as with an AR-15. This is true, they *can* be, but it's also true that high body count shootings are more likely to feature semi-auto rifles.
(Also, small sample size, but of the last 25 mass killers in the Post data, *16* were 29 and under. So if we're dealing with a spreading contagion it seems to be concentrating in that age range relative to the past.)
Put another way, about 15 percent of the years of male adulthood (defined roughly as 18-70) produce more than 40 percent of mass killings. Maybe that's not a large enough disproportion to justify age-based regulation but it's still a disproportion (and an unsurprising one).
Because if, per the WaPo data that @seanmdav uses, "only" 41 percent of mass shootings are perpetrated by men 18-29, that still means that 18-29 year-olds are much more likely than men in any other decade of the life cycle to be mass shooters.
To this suggestion Davis offers three responses: First, that age limits are misguided because the majority of mass shootings are perpetrated by men 30 and older. Which is true but not I think a dispositive case against age-based purchase rules.
I didn't imagine my proposal as a response to "gun violence" writ large (which has diminished since the 1990s) but as a possible reaction to the specific problem of large body-count mass shootings, in which semi-autos are more frequently the weapons of choice.
First, I agree with Davis that if you're worried about gun violence as a broad category, limits on semi-automatic rifles are a dubious-to-pointless response, since almost most homicides involve handguns instead.

My Sunday column: No Country For Young Men With AR-15s:	https://t.co/madLZI3yGf
@seanmdav Generally I've been closer to your side of these debates so I would be interested in what your definition of that side's non-negotiable principles entails.
@seanmdav Similarly some infringements on gun rights also seem reasonable, including many of the ones we have now re, for instance, machine guns, background checks, waiting periods etc. Do you think current policy in those areas should be struck down as unconstitutional? Genuinely curious.
@seanmdav You didn't answer my question, but I'll answer: That doesn't sound like a particularly reasonable infringement, but some infringements on speech are reasonable, like the ones I wrote about last Sunday re: porn.
@seanmdav If there is a list of recent mass shootings you consider definitive I'd be happy to examine that one and be disabused of my sense that semi-auto rifles are 1) used a lot and 2) driving high body counts.
@seanmdav You're right, I miscounted -- thought it was nine of nineteen rather than eight. However those eight also produced 199 fatalities, vs. 77 for the eleven w/o semi-automatic rifles.
@seanmdav Just seems like we have a lot of young men entertaining versions of this fantasy right now, and the ability to use semi-auto fire to mow ppl down is clearly part of the fantasy.
@seanmdav Forget the 25/30 provocation for now; do you think it would be a disastrous infringement on liberty if the age for semi-autos in FL had been 21 and not 18?
@seanmdav It's a Times list, and not school-specific, but about half of these feature semi-auto rifles. Again, just seems like there's a big gap btw what ppl use for ordinary murder (mostly handguns) and these kind of deliberate sprees.	https://t.co/phyGdzCHGY
@seanmdav True, but not a bolt-action rifle. What about the rest of the top ten?
@seanmdav An semi-automatic restriction is a foolish response to "gun violence" as a problem, I agree. I'm less sure it's a foolish response to the mass-shooting contagion.
@seanmdav And the semi-auto rifle mass killings tend to have higher body counts.
@seanmdav I don't contend they're uniquely dangerous. Recent mass shootings are almost all semi-automatics, w/a few shotguns worked in, and quite a few AR-15s.
@seanmdav Of course hunters use all kinds of weapons for hunting, AR-15s very much included. I used "hunting rifle" colloquially to refer to bolt-action; I think the contrast w/semi-auto makes it clear what I meant. If you think that usage vitiates my suggestion, fair enough.
@seanmdav Bolt-action rifles are almost never used in mass shootings. Semiautomatic weapons almost always are. I am aware that there are gradations and complexities, but that distinction still seems noteworthy in thinking about regulation.
@seanmdav That's a good line.
@matthewschmitz And the logic of the proposal holds up fine if you make the rifle age 14.
@matthewschmitz I assumed (and should have written) that such a law would allow a large space for parental legal ownership and teenage use.

@DamonLinker @petersuderman Porn is a rare issue where social conservatives have not actually lost the battle for public opinion, so far as I can tell.
@DamonLinker @petersuderman The polling on porn is weaker but the data points we have suggest that the people in our Twitter feed are not representative of a clear moral majority by any stretch.
@petersuderman What do you think of the "only legalize possession and non-commercial production" approach to marijuana reform?
@petersuderman Or, alternatively, we're conducting a radical social experiment and you're saying then just 15 years in it's already too late to put any limits on it.
@jbarro My guess is that the evidence will continue to look like it does now -- anecdata, general difficulties in romance, Japanification -- without some slam-dunk data on how porn turns men into violent killers (which it pretty clearly doesn't).
@jbarro Yes, it matters whether it's true, but the obvious evil of porn should reasonably shape our interpretation of inevitably-muddy data.
@jbarro Yes, I think this is true, but it is not something you're ever likely to prove absolutely with a regression analysis.
@petersuderman Or it looks like the approach we took to hard-core pornography for most of American history, which licensed some law enforcement abuses and some disrespect for the law, but also generally sustained an anti-porn consensus without a ruthless police state.
@jbarro I'm proposing a social engineering policy driven by the fact that porn is evil.
@jimgeraghty Was America really a horrific nanny state in the days when you couldn't watch gangbangs on your Comcast internet?
And again, the fact that we already censor porn in various ways everywhere except the internet is an indicator that it's possible to do so without busting down doors to arrest people taking nude selfies. /finis
"Prohibition always fails" is a libertarian credo I don't share. Hard drugs should be illegal; softer drugs discouraged w/lesser penalties. Machine guns should be banned. "Wars on X" are usually a mistake, but you can ban or censor in ways that are well short of full-scale wars.
... and the benefits to regulating porn for safety have to be counted against the costs of making the life seem semi-mainstream; you end up w/more people ensnared by a deeply exploitative business. And the absence of legal restriction sends its own moral message.
But I don't share it. There are costs to a partially-enforced ban, sure, but there are also costs to every system. An unrestricted market seems to drive *mainstream consumers* toward ever-more-outre/violent/transgressive porn, bc porn consumption deadens ppl to the ordinary ...
Peter's view is that this kind of partially-enforced ban can't work, that it encourages disrespect for the law while driving black market miseries and the creation of ever-more-outre/transgressive niches. That's a common libertarian assumption.
Then stop, and see what happens. Don't go after amateurs, don't arrest people sharing nudes. Use the law to destroy Big Porn and set up obstacles to casual use, while simultaneously increasing social stigma around said use. Use the law as a moral teacher.
Of note on the latter point, re: possibility/ease of regulation: "The majority of the world’s tube sites are effectively a monopoly—owned by a company called MindGeek, whose bandwidth use exceeds that of Amazon or Facebook." 	https://t.co/6OUpKobqfC
My general proposal would be to start by limiting porn's easy/free availability through mainstream ISP providers and to crack down on major market players. Force people to access hard core porn through VPNs etc and make it hard to get rich legally as a porn merchant.
He imagines a multi-step approach: Stop mass production; shut down websites; crack down on amateurs; go after black market. But each step doesn't require all the others, any more than existing censorship of porn on the airwaves and elsewhere requires an authoritarian progression.
Peter is arguing against a policy approach that amounts to a full-scale "war on porn," in which the goal is to expunge its presence from American society. But I don't see any reason to leap to that endpoint.

@JZmirak Explaining Donald Trump to my daughters is already an interesting challenge.
@JZmirak If you loathe feminism that much it seems even stranger to hand its advocates a president who fulfills their every stereotype of men/conservatives/Republicans ...
@ericmetaxas I'll DM you, as the kids say.
@JZmirak Also: Bill Clinton definitely reshaped feminism for the worse, and we've lived with the cultural consequences.
@JZmirak And saying everyone should just get over the cultural role of the presidency is a nice theory with no connection to the role presidents play in our culture.
@JZmirak JFK was a bad man and a bad president, the two qualities were connected, and had his behavior become public he should have been forced to resign.
@JZmirak Perhaps that choice has fewer downstream consequences than the protections for Christian liberty afforded by Justice Gorsuch. But to think it has no consequences at all seems very strange.
@JZmirak If I were, for instance, a lukewarmly religiously female college student at the moment, looking for a moral vision around sex and male-female relations, the Trump era seems to offers me a choice between feminism and, well, Trump.
@JZmirak Certainly. But again, in America the presidency is a major cultural office, and their example shapes public perceptions in all kinds of way.
@ericmetaxas I will read it with interest, Eric, and if you're interested in having me on the show to discuss it I would be delighted.
@JZmirak I don't believe that I've spared the Holy Father from criticism. He has not, however, been credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple woman. To the best of my knowledge.
@JZmirak George W. Bush was *decidedly* the leader of religious conservatism, and the Iraq disaster no less than the sex abuse scandals had an effect on the credibility of conservative Christianity.
As I was just saying ...	https://t.co/VikvoiRqhp
@JZmirak My recurring question, John, is having written so eloquently about our church's shredding of its own moral credibility w/sex abuse, you seem so relaxed about having Trump as religious conservatism's de facto leader.
@mattyglesias both/and
This is part of why I have different views of Republican politicians who work with Trump (which seems necessary given that he is, in fact, the president) and religious-conservative figures who *justify* him (which seems like self-destructive folly).
In that sense I both agree and disagree with @jtlevy's take on the importance of what Trump says: It clearly matters, but it corrodes his allies and strengthens his critics as often as the reverse.	https://t.co/dQSxxWQJZK
I suspect that the main short-term effect of Trump's public rhetoric re: women, sex and violence is to drain residual moral authority away from his religious-conservative enablers and transfer it to #meToo feminism.

Though if you think of it as part of a de facto package with the tax cuts, you could argue that the failure of Obamacare repeal was a transition moment to a more Trumpist period in policymaking.
The budget deal is much closer to what I expected from a Trumpist era than anything that happened on policy last year.
@chrislhayes Right -- and I think launching a full-on Fox competitor would be daft. It's more the absence of experiments on, say, TNT or Showtime or some other channel looking for an edge.
@chrislhayes I might take a flyer on a @jordanbpeterson or @benshapiro show if I were running one of the lesser pay-cable outlets, for instance.
@chrislhayes They discovered a huge market inefficiency and exploited it insanely well, and maybe it's just a testament to the power of monopoly, like Facebook or Amazon. But it's still a notable thing that in such an otherwise-diversified marketplace you don't get more experiments.
This is a comment about cable and networks; I am aware of all the downmarket/local/radio conservative programming. And the conservative audience's comfort with a certain mediocrity is definitely part of the issue.

And "Bridesmaids" should have been nominated for Best Picture.
Still: I'd give "Logan" a BP nomination. And Gal Gadot a Best Actress nom for "Wonder Woman." And Adam Driver a Best Supporting for "Last Jedi."
Having a system that rewards movies like "Mad Max: Fury Road" is good. But no blockbuster made in 2017 was as good "Fury Road." There's just a quality problem that a democratic spirit in the nominations can't solve.
Namely, movies that are original, crowdpleasing, and *good.* You can put "The Last Jedi" in the Best Picture lineup if you want but it's just not a good movie. Likewise, "The Dark Knight" maybe deserved an Oscar nomination ... but most superhero blockbusters just don't.

@charlescwcooke @carney Money isn't infinite but w/low inflation there is room to spend more on areas where basic things aren't working, as they clearly aren't for parents/work/family right now.
@ThePlumLineGS They're arguing that every race down to dogcatcher is now a "Flight 93 election." That claim requires more than a general undermining of trust; it requires things Trump hasn't yet done.
@ThePlumLineGS Saying "Trump has been bad for FBI morale/public trust in institutions" is a reasonable critique, but lots of things have been bad for morale/public trust without creating the scale of threat that Wittes/Rauch discern.
@ThePlumLineGS I mean ... this is just not a particularly "autocratic" list. I agree about the Mar-a-Lago and hotel stuff. On Russia our FP has gotten more hawkish since Trump's election.
@charlescwcooke Yes, that's what I mean.
@jonathanchait I don't think Obama directed it; I think the scale of the targeting suggested a political motivation.
@charlescwcooke What if we take the funds from Chinese investors instead?
@SohrabAhmari A line's that's going to be read differently when the next conclave returns him to the papacy ...
Which we could have had if Democrats had voted for it. Just saying. (The Republicans who voted no are bad, yes ... but Dems still could have voted for it.)
The latter issue is a reason to prefer child credits to spending on family leave; they're neutral in the mommy wars. And since Rubio is the reason the child credit just got larger; I think his policy combination is pretty reasonable; it just needs a credit that's larger still.
Second, most family leave plans don't collectivize child care; they collectivize child care *for working parents*. So stay-at-home parents get nothing while their family tax dollars subsidize their working peers. This plan avoids that problem, which is a virtue.
In effect the plan would let new parents borrow some money and worktime from their sixtysomething selves. I get that's not what @ebruenig wants, but as family policy I'm not clear how it's *worse* than the status quo from a lefty perspective or any other.
First it's not clear how it's "punitive" to families to allow parents to use retirement benefits as child benefits instead. It may be inferior to other paid leave plans, but nobody's losing any money.
First, I favor more collectivization of the costs of childrearing (sorry, @charlescwcooke), so I generally agree with her premise. But its application to this particular idea has two problems.

@yeselson @michaelbd You mean, modernity comes and science affirms that life begins at conception, while our vast piled-up wealth provides the means to care for unwanted/cast-off children?
@yeselson @michaelbd Likewise the Hippocratic school/oath linked abortion, murder and euthanasia.
@yeselson @michaelbd Both the history and the psychology are a lot more complicated than that. Infanticide and abortion (and opposition to both) are quite often culturally and politically linked.
@yeselson @michaelbd Except that literally nobody expecting a wanted baby thinks of it as a non-child during the third trimester. "Here's a picture of my potential kid/fetus," said nobody at week 32. Or earlier, in most cases, but certainly not by then.
@yeselson @michaelbd That's why humane societies should have lots of orphanages with "no questions asked" drop-off policies for newborns.
@yeselson @michaelbd And honestly those desperate new moms who drop babies in the dumpster also inspire a certain kind of sympathy and I would prefer that the law go relatively lightly on them as well.
@yeselson @michaelbd From the pro-life point of view, the change of location radically changes the situation *for the mother*, this changing our assessment of her level of guilt and our view of appropriate legal penalty. But again, that's all about her; it doesn't touch the ontology of the child.
@yeselson @michaelbd You are resting an awful lot of dead don't-call-them-children on the thin reed of our supposed inconsistency.
@yeselson @michaelbd I can see the argument, however dimly, that it makes a difference to their legal protections. But to what they are? No.
@yeselson @michaelbd You are literally offering no alternative definition beyond their physical location.
@yeselson Where we disagree, when your side justifies abortion all the way, is whether it should be legal to kill a child. I am suggesting that you cannot really evade this point.
@yeselson The pro-lifer treats the arguments you use to justify killing -- the special invasiveness and trauma of unwanted pregnancy -- as a possible justification for not prosecuting the woman. So we agree on the distinctive status of pregnancy.
@yeselson JJT doesn't argue that the violinist is not an "adult human," just that killing him is okay. Which, fine. Similarly, you can argue for reasons why 3rd trimester abortion must be legal, but don't tell me it's not a child. You know it is.
@yeselson That difference does not imply not a difference in its status as a "child." It's just a reason why, under the Judith Jarvis Thomson argument, sometimes infanticide is okay.
@yeselson You can come up with pro-choice theories (brain functioning, viability) that at least *attempt* to draw a line btw children and early embryos/fetuses. Those simply don't apply at 34 weeks.
@yeselson The claim that a third-trimester fetus is not a child but a one-week-old infant is does not seem to me contestable any plausible definition of "child."

@avermeule Okay, good: Now persuade the people making China policy in the Vatican.
@avermeule It might be true, but *preferring* present-day Chinese Communism to present-day liberalism still seems insane.
@matthewwalther @michaelbd Yes, but given that JPI issued Familaris Consortio and Francis has voided it (sorry, "developed" it) for any diocese that favors a different approach, your point is mistaken.
@matthewwalther @michaelbd It is clearly papal policy, advanced through ambiguous formulations and formal permission slips. Where that fits into the ordinary magisterium is a matter for theologians to debate.
@matthewwalther @michaelbd That conservative Catholics were too blithe about those abuses is a totally reasonable critique of the JPII era. Doesn't make the instantiation of abuse as non-abuse something to be shrugged at.
@matthewwalther @michaelbd To pluck an example: The abuses that led to the Reformation were bad. It would have been worse if the papacy had responded by formally abandoning clerical celibacy and formally licensing simony.
@matthewwalther @michaelbd All over the place, yes.	https://t.co/chc56ntozA
@matthewwalther @michaelbd Because the reading intended and supported by the Holy Father would transform those abuses from abuses into canonically-licit acts.
@matthewwalther @michaelbd Then you're mistaken, as a cursory glance at the arguments made by actual liberal Catholics would attest.
@TheStalwart @michaelbd I know.
@TheStalwart @michaelbd No, he's a sellout who refuses to move from "dislike" to "hate."
@allahpundit @JVLast This was similar to a dilemma that I became embroiled in during high school, except that instead of there being corporate rules I was just bad at asking girls I liked out.

@gjpappin Well, you were until now!
@dandrezner Absolutely. But if you're addressing an argument, as are Wittes and Rauch, to the kind of voter who didn't vote for Trump but did vote for his R senator, you need to work harder to convince them that the current constraints won't last.
@jawillick Yeah, it varies.
This opinion will be revised with the facts, as they change.
And I think there's a stronger case that leading Rs deserved to lose for their fecklessness during Trump's rise in 2015-2016 than that they deserve to lose for their damage-control approach since.
Last addendum: In general I do think there's a strong case that GOP needs to lose power to get better. What I don't buy is that what's happened since Trump was elected proves that Rs simply can't constrain him.
@mattyglesias As I just said I think a House/Senate distinction might work as a very crude heuristic for strategic anti-Trump but ideologically-conservative voters.
A sharper, more nuanced version of that Wittes/Rauch piece would urge partisan R voters disturbed by Trump to vote against their GOP House representative but for their GOP Senator.
@IChotiner They don't want to pass a bill protecting him bc there are many Rs, esp. in the House, who fit Wittes/Rauch description of enablers or just don't to antagonize WH.
@IChotiner So far they've protected Mueller by 1) supporting his appointment, and not walking back that support, and 2) backing WH voices who tell him he can't fire him.
This assumption could be right. But it's still a predictive exercise, not a description of current Senate-R failure to constrain and direct, which to date has been close to what they promised their Trump-skeptical voters.
So the Wittes and Rauch argument rests on a prospective assumption: Trump *will* act on his instincts re: Mueller, Senate Rs. *will* fail to constrain him or *will* fail to act if Mueller shows major crimes.
Senate has not done much to investigate Trumpian corruption (family, hotels, etc.). But on policy and personnel they have exerted a strong shaping and constraining effect to date. And Mueller, whose investigation they have protected, presumably has some corruption in his sights.
A short list of major things Trump has threatened to do, but hasn't, in part because of influence of Senate GOP + his own appointees: 	Blow up Iran Deal, trade war w/China, reinstate waterboarding, blow up NAFTA, blow up NATO, major reset w/Russia, fire Sessions, fire Mueller ...
@IChotiner The Senate and his own appointees (and the Senate by shaping his appointees).
@HotlineJosh But if he is then we will have much more information on this score by the time Republicans actually go to the voting booth.
If you are a strongly partisan Republican voter who wants to see Trump constrained, at the moment the advice I would give you would depend completely on who represents you, both in the House and Senate.
This piece's argument would be vastly more compelling if Trump had fired Mueller/Rosenstein and shifted US policy in a sweepingly pro-Putin direction. But in the event it is precisely *Republicans* who have constrained Trump's instincts on both fronts.	https://t.co/fjFmxg4bgT
@HeerJeet Yes, thank you for illustrating my point.
@mattyglesias @IChotiner As I think happened to some extent in the 1990s with crime and welfare and affirmative action, and should have happened w/immigration before we got Trump.
@mattyglesias @IChotiner My view is that by taking seriously on-the-merits elements of racially-coded debates, politicians of both parties can help reduce racial polarization.
@ThePlumLineGS I think that's a fair reading of committed activists. I think politicians should be judged somewhat more cynically.
@mattyglesias @IChotiner Then Trump is behavingly wicked when he encourages it. What if the correct affirmative acton and welfare and crime and immigration policies are not determined by answering the question of whether racism is wrong?
@HeerJeet @IChotiner Yes, that's a big pivot. Still makes a difference what happens afterward. Carter and Clinton make big pitches for white southern votes; GWB for Hispanic votes, etc.
@IChotiner Goldwater drives strong racial polarization; Nixon '68 tries to work against it; Nixon '72 accepts it; Carter '76 works against it; Reagan mostly accepts it; Bushes + Clinton work against it; ditto Obama '08; Obama '12 accepts it; Trump exacerbates and Hillary plays along.
@IChotiner My read of recent history is that anti-Obama freakout + unstated anti-Bush backlash turns Rs to right on racial issues in 2008-2012 ... then Dems tacitly decide to work with that shift rather than against it, on theory that demographics of ethno-polarization favor them long term.
@IChotiner Some polarization is inevitable; Q is whether your vision leans into it or against it.
@jbouie Well, and there are various ways to define Clintonism.
@ezraklein I kind of think people do realize this, and the realization is reflected in the pitch of the debate around race. The role of sexual polarization is the one I think is actually underrated.
Both Clintonism and "compassionate conservatism" were built to reduce ethnic polarization. The current Democratic vision, like the current Republican one, is ... not.
It's not really that's it's underrated; it's that too many smart liberals are convinced that this ethnic polarization *only* reflects Republican choices and not their own.	https://t.co/bb3dppF0fS
@jawillick Likewise the claim that bc of Republican intransigence Obama simply *had* to act unilaterally on immigration and other issues ...

@ccpecknold "Anglicanism"?
@Noahpinion Oh, come on, man, turn on your TV. Again we don't do the death thing anymore, but the voyeurism and cruelty is ever present.
@Noahpinion I agree, that's very hard to imagine. But also true of something as close the often-desperate prairie lives of the Ingallses in the Little House books. Which are nonetheless intensely relatable in many ways.
@Noahpinion And people are really remarkably adaptable to a range of conditions.
@Noahpinion About suffering they were never wrong,	The old Masters: how well they understood	Its human position: how it takes place	While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along ...
@Noahpinion Most of, say, 16th century England was not really much like North Korea though, or the Killing Fields.
@Noahpinion Don't all those examples suggest that we aren't talking about some huge industrial-age discontinuity? I have known people who survived Europe's agonies. They were marked by it in various ways; they were not alien.
@Noahpinion Not entirely.
@Noahpinion It's been a while since I read the Canterbury Tales I will concede.
@Noahpinion And the biggest difference between ourselves and the premoderns that I can see is that we are less acquainted with, and therefore more afraid, of pain and death.
@Noahpinion The basic dynamics of a Shakespeare play are reproduced constantly in families, high schools, workplaces, to say nothing of the military and politics. There's just less killing.
@Noahpinion yes???
@Noahpinion Everyone in Shakespeare and Chaucer seems pretty relatable though.
@MTMehan Okay. But then the real-world upshot of this corruption is just that an investigation of Trump's that was apparently kicked off by one of his own staffers' bragging may have been greased by some partisan oppo.
@MTMehan All I am saying is that it is odd for the right to be so invested in a narrative about the Obama WH + FBI subverting democracy in an election when their actual pattern of statements and non-statements about what they were investigating helped Trump win.
@MTMehan Hillary was sleazy, paranoid and stupid, but I still found this pretty convincing at the time:	https://t.co/zbz3xQny9W
@MTMehan The "coordinated protections" that dropped an October Surprise on her.
@MTMehan What are Hillary's "actual crimes" viz. Russia? Uranium One?
@MTMehan Also, I mean, Carter Page may or may not have been ill-used here, but for the FBI to target him was not exactly a blue-sky thing.
@MTMehan I guess I don't think it can be judged a "rankly corrupt and tyrannical fishing expedition" if the opponent is literally sending his son to meet w/Russians promising him hacked goods.
@MTMehan Okay. But the corruption case is slightly complicated by the fact that 1) an FBI investigation of Trump's Russia ties seems to have been  warranted, even if actual collusion didn't take place, and 2) that investigation was not made public when it would have most aided the Dems.
@MTMehan e.g., someone high above the DoJ and the FBI gave us ... this?:	https://t.co/x0qLhIHneE
@MTMehan Seems at the very least odd that an Obama-directed conspiracy to frame Trump as a Russian agent could not even manage to get its intended frame-up into the press before the actual election.
@yeselson @DamonLinker @KathaPollitt It's true that my side is trying to awaken your conscience with the late-term argument, not just work out a compromise.
@MTMehan What do you imagine is the level of corruption involved?
@yeselson @KayHymowitz W/o universal health insurance, how can we justify banning infanticide?
And to clarify my initial point: It is quite possible that the investigation into Team Trump did make, and will continue to make, specific overreaches and mistakes, which should be aired and criticized if they happen, without it proving a "deep state coup" theory of the case.
And it may be even less than it appears. Either way, patience and skepticism and non-hysteria will serve us all extremely well.
As evidence of a larger conspiracy of partisan intent that should justify dismissing Mueller or firing him -- well, let's just say it's not anywhere near that, and indeed provides some countervailing evidence in its final point.
This is a reasonable thing to remember as the Mueller investigation works it way onward. If its analysis is accurate (a reasonably big "if") the Nunes memo may reveal a case study of how that tendency can lead to investigative mistakes.
In general, people charged with major investigations tend to naturally overcommit to an assumption of guilt, to become partisan where they weren't before, in ways that color their ultimate findings.
@yeselson the latter, that is.

@Chateaubriand__ @matthewwalther @MichaelDavisCH It all makes a bit more sense if you consider that he was writing that in some small part to reassure the Politburo about the church's potential political role in China.
@ericmetaxas Standards have indeed fallen all over.
@Chateaubriand__ @matthewwalther @MichaelDavisCH A concordat is eminently desirable; a Communist influence on episcopal appointments acceptable. But little about this Vatican gives me confidence in their long-term strategic vision.
Which they might, and which might make Francis look far-seeing. But if they don't, evangelicalism and Islam and other as-yet-unknown forces may be the real beneficiaries of Catholic accommodation to regimes that are strong today but vulnerable tomorrow and doomed the next.
Be they realities of a secularized West or a Communist-ruled China. And if there's a potential *practical* mistake in both cases, it's the assumption that both post-sexual revolution secularism and the Politburo are simply here to say, that they'll last for decades or centuries.
... which is the impulse to see some of the most zealous groups of the faithful as a major stumbling block to the church's future growth, and their zeal as something that must adapt, or be adapted, to new social or political realities.
So the Holy Father could very easily be making a grave mistake in the first case and a painful but necessary act of statesmanship in the second. Hopefully he is. Still there is also a common thread ...
The question in the divorce/remarriage debate is whether the pope actually has the authority to make the debated change; with the potential Chinese concordat, he absolutely does, and such deals are a recurring feature of church history - sometimes for ill, but sometimes for good.
It's important for conservative Catholics not to conflate the Chinese-bishops controversy with doctrinal debates ... but it is also hard not to notice the general similarity of the rhetoric justifying the Vatican line in each case:	https://t.co/kB9UQEoS4P
@jonathanchait @chrislhayes Basically would we have gotten a version of Bush's SS reform push from a Romney-Ryan administration. Bush tried, and he hadn't even really campaigned on it. I suspect they would have felt some pressure to try.
@jonathanchait @chrislhayes A Romney administration would have never raised taxes, I agree. Q is whether they would have sought more revenue-neutrality in tax reform and made entitlement/welfare cuts a priority in a way that Trump obviously isn't.
@chrislhayes You're probably right, but it also hasn't *campaigned* on austerity as firmly as it did in 2010-2012. W/Ryan as veep, there would have been *some* impulse toward entitlement reform in a way there isn't w/Trump.
@chrislhayes People also respond to success. Romney ran more on austerity and lost, Trump ran as a right-wing Keynesian and won. So, the right gets more Keynesian.
@chrislhayes He would have done a tax cut, but how much pressure would there have been to make it revenue neutral, paired w/spending cuts, etc.? I don't know.
@chrislhayes Right, but the partisan mind being what it is, not surprising it took a turn of presidencies to convince them. Interesting Q is what would have happened had Romney won.
@chrislhayes My sense from talking to people from that class during the Obama years was that their inflation terror was stronger, and quite genuine. A combination of self-interest and lessons from the '70s they thought would always apply.
@matthewwalther Trads have been known to be condemned and excommunicated I believe.
@matthewwalther Indeed. But also an integralist.
@matthewwalther An American Maurras (not that such a thing is precisely imaginable) would have been for Trump over Cruz, I have no doubt.
@matthewwalther The tendency of (a certain kind of) traditionalist Catholic to support ethno-nationalist politicians is a pretty well-documented trend, and was even before Vatican II created modern traditionalism.
@matthewwalther Preconciliar views on Islam certainly seem to have loomed large in a certain kind of Catholic support for Trump. And as Republicans go Trump's campaign (in rhetoric, I mean) had a corporatist streak.
@matthewwalther Opposition to Vatican II and an attachment to the mass of ages. Plus an American variant on the further-right politics to which those causes have often - though not from necessity - been historically attached.
@matthewwalther And that this was not accidental.
@matthewwalther My sense was that "trads for Trump" was big thing from early on in a way that "trads for Ted Cruz" was not.
@jonathanchait I have had this exact conversation with people many times. The idea of not reading all your mentions always seems to strike them as insane.

@bdomenech @Tracinski Technically parental leave is an anti-nanny policy ...
... but then the pope's big gambles, the divorce/remarriage push and perhaps this, both involve making major concessions to the stewards of that paradigm, in its Western-democratic and Sino-oligarchic forms, in the hopes of making new evangelization possible.
One striking thing about the Francis era is that the papacy's big-picture argument, esp. in Laudato Si', is a sweeping critique of the modern technocratic-capitalist paradigm ...

@saletan I mean, kind of, yeah ...
@mattyglesias This is interesting but talking about economic self-interest seems silly in a debate where the NIMBY side is clearly mostly motivated by racism.
@saletan More likely it came from future foreign investors seeking a safe harbor for their wealth.
If I were running a missionary religious order or similar evangelical group I'd sending priests or church-planters into Ohio and Michigan, the eastern Pacific Northwest, upper New England.
Also there are two very different Secularlands: One in the Rust Belt/Appalachia, the other in liberal whitopias on the coasts (with the coastal urban agglomerations more religious bc of immigration/minorities).
There is a Bible Belt Faithland in the Deep South that's heavily Baptist/evangelical, a High Plains Faithland that's heavily Lutheran and Catholic, and then of course there's Deseret.
A fascinating map, but in part what it shows is that there are really three "Faithlands," each somewhat distinct.	https://t.co/n0zYGC3GyX
The @marcorubio CTC expansion was always just a self-dealing reformocon subsidy, I'm afraid:	https://t.co/mkAKxbXzTE
@mattyglesias If you're right about the scale of "keep America white" racism involved, I agree that no deal may be possible. I'm saying: Let's keep testing the proposition, not least because the stalemate itself encourages racial polarization.
@mattyglesias I agree that it's possible that no deal is possible. But the WH just articulated specific goals and conceded away some of its own side's stated priorities; I'm just suggesting a counter-offer is reasonable.
@mattyglesias But restrictionist sentiment probably isn't going away, so figuring out when you *can* make a deal is something that the center-left should ponder if it doesn't like the stalemate we've been in for 15 years.
@mattyglesias And as I said in the thread, Trump's racial demagoguery is a plausible reason for the left to refuse to deal.
@ThePlumLineGS @DamonLinker The right has a lot of influence when it comes to resisting legalization. It has very little, to date, when it comes to policies that would reduce immigration.
@mattyglesias Every immigration debate since has been shadowed by that experience. I don't think it would kill the center-left to at least recognize that fact.
@mattyglesias The 1986 deal was supposed to decrease unauthorized flows, and in a country that was certainly no less racist than today it passed both houses easily. Then it had the opposite effect.
@DamonLinker @ThePlumLineGS But I think they have had much less influence over Republican politicians than the increasingly absolute pro-immigration consensus has had over Dems. Even after Trump most R senators don't want to cut legal immigration.
@DamonLinker @ThePlumLineGS The "suicide of the West"/"third world invasion" folks have an equivalent moral absolutism, and they're more influential than they were.
@chrislhayes @willwilkinson @daveweigel True, though he was incredibly unpopular overall when he left office, and parts of the base turned on him btw the immigration wars and the financial crisis/TARP.
@lymanstoneky You're an optimist about immigration. It's okay to own it.
@willwilkinson @chrislhayes @daveweigel So it's a combination of the anti-immigration/anti-multicultural sentiment Will IDs and a view that the invasion of Iraq proceeded from the same naive and de facto progressive premises. The Steve Sailer "invade the world, invite the world" line resonates with lots of Trumpers.
@willwilkinson @chrislhayes @daveweigel Pence and others are just being opportunistic, but the actually-sincere pro-Trumpers in the party largely think Iraq was a disaster.
Which in turn is why, though he's more of an immigration optimist than I am overall, I agree with this @lymanstoneky take on how you could get to a reasonable deal from the WH's offer:	https://t.co/muR67hYDq0
As a coda my own view is that recent trends in illegal immigration have made it less likely that we'll see a replay of the '86 amnesty's aftermath, which makes me more sympathetic to an upfront amnesty in exchange for a revamped system than I would have been 5-7 years ago.
Which I don't think @dandrezner and many other smart people on the center-left quite get, which again is part of why the deal probably can't happen.
Maybe/probably no deal would come of this. (Among other things, resistance from the right to the Trump offer is real.) But on paper you can see how it might work ... *if* you understand what restrictionists fear, and what they're conceding with this offer.
And therefore you can *imagine* counter-offer from Democrats. Like: "We do this but we just change skills mix rather than cutting legal rates." Or: "We do this but we do more E-Verify instead of cutting rates." Or: "We do this but we want a bigger amnesty up-front." Or something.
Now if and when that slowdown takes effect, it would make real cuts, which it's understandable that liberals (and others, myself mostly included these days) don't think we need to make. But that doesn't mean the offer doesn't make a lot of concessions; it does.
And in exchange it proposes a slowdown in low-skilled legal immigration that would take effect only after the current visa backlog is cleared, which would likely be *two* presidencies away. Again, exactly the kind of deferred restrictionism that the right has repeatedly rejected.
The offer grants legal status and a path to citizenship for the DREAM population more or less up-front, tied to border security spending but with no E-Verify expansion to deter further illegal immigration. This is not what restrictionists have wanted.
From that perspective, the Trump administration's offer -- which Drezner describes as "so ridiculously over-the-top that it has poisoned the negotiating process" -- is a big move *away* from restrictionist premises.
This experience has led restrictionists to oppose up-front grants of legal status and citizenship paths, to demand their preferred reforms (border security, E-Verify, changes to legal immigration policies) upfront with any legal status grant deferred.
The restrictionist view has always been shaped by the Reagan-era grand bargain, which promises to exchange amnesty for enforcement, and instead did a big amnesty ... which then ushered in a twenty-year wave of illegal immigration.
In particular, it's an example of how smart non-restrictionists don't really grasp what the serious restrictionists have wanted out of prior immigration negotiations, why they've rejected prior grand bargains, etc.
I think this @dandrezner piece is helpful in clarifying why an immigration grand bargain is indeed unlikely, though not always for the reasons he identifies.	https://t.co/TgVHCKJg9x

@baseballcrank @JVLast Yes, and worse.
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass No. I'm saying that we have a very complicated history where diversity is concerned.
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass Ask the Sioux.
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass More generally I stand by this take. Diversity doesn't inexorably lead to wars but it's a tough fit with republics and welfare states:	https://t.co/Nj5sVv5S3i
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass Of course I did, when it was written. One comment would be that because you're arguing with actual racists your argument focuses very heavily on race, to the exclusion of factors like religion, language, etc.
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass Was the Merkel government's decision to curb refugee flows a "policy of racial engineering"?
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass I'm sure my own pessimistic biases incline me to believe it, but I think that studies aside the historical evidence -- recent history included -- for the claim is extremely strong.
@Noahpinion @GabrielRossman @jneeley78 @KevinWGlass Do you think that the other factors that effect the link have been improving in the West generally over the last thirty years?
@yeselson @michaelbd The former, but when high-trust environments have been in decline for forty-odd years you can't just wish the problem away.
@mattyglesias But then over the next thirty years the Catholic Church thrived, anti-Catholic prejudice became more and more marginal, and John F. Kennedy was elected president.
@Noahpinion Yes, in the logic of polarization, it's always Munich and your fellow citizens are Hitler.
@michaelbd I don't think the modern university is much of a high trust environment these days, do you?
@Noahpinion Can you give me a recent example of what you mean by his "unwavering racist nativism"?
@Noahpinion But everyone knows Trump's a bigot. Why would the deal be better received just because he stopped acting like one for six months?
@Noahpinion But Miller is the immigration restrictionist who actually has some power to make a deal.
@Noahpinion The president already has a seat at the table, so we know a bigot is making the final decision anyway. The "don't deal with Miller" argument just seems like a way of saying "no deals under Trump." Which, fine, but then just say that.
@Noahpinion I can see the argument for not doing an immigration reform because of the taint of Trump's rhetoric, yes. But your argument implies a situation where once America passes some demographic tipping point, you can't enforce immigration law or change policy in any way.
@Noahpinion Which could be designed in a way that doesn't change the country's racial trajectory one way or another.
@Noahpinion And that the Trump WH's offer therefore merits a counteroffer that accepts skill/family reunification changes but demands more green cards for higher-skilled immigrants.
@Noahpinion I am suggesting what I have previously suggested: That a deal that limits illegal immigration and low-skilled immigration while opening a path to citizenship for some current aliens would ease some racial and socioeconomic tensions in the long run.
@Noahpinion One way to make the inevitable changes work, I am suggesting, is not to respond to backlash and increasing working class disarray by hitting the accelerator on those changes.
@Noahpinion And my position that we should maintain roughly the status quo with a different skills mix is urging us to go back to a white supermajority ... how?
@Noahpinion This thing where liberalism insists that a moral politics requires deliberate ignorance of human nature is not going to end well.
@Noahpinion I'm going to stand by my record of opposing the election of Donald Trump and opposing the imprudent policy choices that made it possible.
@Noahpinion Yes, let's do no analysis of anything bad that's happened in European or American politics in the last ten years, because that would be racist.
@yeselson @jbouie @singsingsolo There probably is not a deal. I have no idea if Miller would want to make one. (And neither do all the people who hate him.) But if you get the Trump WH offering a path to citizenship for millions of ppl you should probably make a counteroffer.
@yeselson @jbouie @singsingsolo Just noting that (I believe) Steve King opposes the offer the Trump WH made. So you already aren't negotiating with him.
@jbouie I'm not arguing that it was THE factor. But I think having a generation of assimilation was quite useful. And a lot of KKK-ish activity (incl. lynching rates) fell off faster as immigration declined.		Anyway -- have to go, appreciate the argument.
Appreciated, Greg:	https://t.co/g66Jof1xte
@jbouie I get this theory but I mildly disagree; I don't think it's a coincidence that the biggest sustained period of progress on civil rights occurred in a period when immigration *wasn't* a big issue.
@jbouie But if the analogy is to a civil right that bigots oppose and cannot be compromised away, then this becomes an argument for open borders.
@jbouie In fact I'm not even arguing for restrictionist policy relative to the status quo, I'm literally arguing for the current rate with a different skills mix. But yes: I think minimizing the sort of backlash that gave us Trump is something that should be factored into policymaking.
@jbouie I'm not omitting that point.
@jbouie It's not a function of "some insoluable element," it's just a function of the fact that the process of assimilation and integration takes time.
I suspect he'd write it differently today, and the shape of black opinion probably looks somewhat different today thanks to Trump. But I think it's still a good example of a more realistic, and ultimately compromise-oriented, approach to these things. /finis
Here, for instance, is a moderately sympathetic piece from four years ago about anti-immigration sentiment that treats it as a normal part of politics. It's about African-American immigration skepticism. @jbouie wrote it:	https://t.co/7Z56cOao5f
That's because, as I said in the column, I think there are reasonable socioeconomic reasons to be skeptical about mass immigration, and because people are complicated you shouldn't distill an argument to the worst impulse animating it.
Finally @jbouie is right about this: I am arguing that the presence of bigotry and racism among immigration restrictionists does not automatically disqualify their views from a place in negotiations:	https://t.co/iob7emAT0S
The stresses created by demographic change are not confined to the white working class. Nor is the case for a politics that acknowledges them as problems, and proceeds relatively cautiously when shaping/accelerating that change.
It's not as extreme as the Trumpian form, but from the "Berniebro contra mundum" battles to the "multiculturalism versus Zionism" debates on campus it's very easy to see such dynamics at work.
He suggests that saying "diversity sows distrust" is just an excuse for a racist distrust that only manifests among white conservatives. But I don't think that's true at all. The Democratic coalition is increasingly shot through with diversity-driven distrust as well.
A couple of more thoughts, specific to @jbouie's critique, starting with this point:	https://t.co/6nUIZfphqy
And when your enemy has just made an offer that has infuriated (for real) a number of his own allies, that's a good time to think creatively about counter-offers, doomed as they may be. The belief that moral purity precludes them is part of the doom spiral of polarization.
I grasp why that's seen as a more outrageous idea, since it distills a vague general idea to a specific deal with a figure seen as the devil. But such deals (Nixon to China, etc.) *are* in fact a common feature of successful political compromise.
The difference is that this time I'm specifically arguing that this compromise might (though probably not) be reachable via negotiations with Stephen Miller and the Trump White House, based on the offer they've made.
The argument is basically the same one I made in this column six months ago -- that a stable bargain on immigration would involve keeping rates roughly steady while changing the skills mix. That column did not provoke much controversy that I can recall.	https://t.co/Lqhi4DB6d2

@yeselson @michaelbd @conor64 @willwilkinson I'm saying the consensus favors the status quo, not lower rates or higher.
@yeselson @michaelbd @conor64 @willwilkinson It's not. The status quo is the majority view.
@yeselson @michaelbd @conor64 @willwilkinson Over the period when immigration surged -- late '80s to 2005 or so -- there was frequent plurality-to-majority support for lower rates:	https://t.co/XqSnGmJ5H9
@yeselson @willwilkinson @mattyglesias This Sunday's column lists some reasons, though you doubtless won't be persuaded.
@michaelbd @willwilkinson Yes, the wall-only deal is the actual sellout, ironically.
@michaelbd @willwilkinson But I also think WH should also want a token cut in levels with that deal.
@michaelbd @willwilkinson But yes, you can't give it for a wall; you give it for the broader overhaul that the last WH framework proposed, but w/more merit visas to compensate for the end of chain migration.
@michaelbd @willwilkinson Possible, though we are actually better at securing the border now and the demographics of Latin America are different than in the '80s.
@willwilkinson If you could get a better immigration system overall and a pathway to citizenship for 2 million ppl here already in exchange for a modest cut in levels, why not?

@mattyglesias I'm not pretending there's no crime in the story at all, but let's also not pretend that whether Trump colluded *in that crime* isn't the central Q in this investigation.
@mattyglesias Which is not a crime that the Trump campaign committed or materially abetted, as far as we know at present.
Yes, the potential underlying crime in the Russia affair is more serious, but if you don't have proof of that crime the politics of an obstruction-based impeachment are never going to work.
The Clinton impeachment effort failed with obstruction of justice charges in a case where there was literal physical evidence of the relationship that Clinton was covering up.
If this is where the Mueller investigation ends Trump would be a fool to fire him. His administration will survive an obstruction charge that does not claim to prove an underlying crime. https://t.co/b3NmyaRoxr

The prospect of a *politicized* Christianity is what the Politburo fears most. An evangelical-Catholic alliance is their nightmare; they are presently persecuting evangelical churches; American evangelicals have long been supporters of human rights activism in China ...
It had not occurred to me that attacks from @pontifex's circle on American religious conservatives are related to the Vatican quest for a concordat with Beijing. But re-reading this piece (h/t @StephenWhite11) in light of Rome's Chinese moves is striking: https://t.co/szP0iiC2uS

@go_oat But I did not support Trump so I too have privileged stability in my way. And I'm just gently defending that perspective.
@go_oat My plan is still to still to replace Kennedy with a pro-lifer.
@go_oat There are issues, I concede, where we are clearly "falling" with every passing day, but with abortion most of the trends have run the other way for 20 years.
@go_oat By more than a few measures of "sin and madness" America was in worse shape in 1975 than it is today, yet I am glad the country did not fall into a bloody civil war just before I was born.
@go_oat Use any society according to its desert and who shall 'scape whipping? But the assumption that its passing away into history would be good for the pro-life cause, Catholicism, truth goodness etc strikes me as unproven.

@ChristineEmba @bdmcclay @blsandford @phil_christman And a weak father who slides from a good cop role into playing a kind of "I'm on YOUR side" co-conspirator role with his daughter against his wife ... not good.
@ChristineEmba @bdmcclay @blsandford @phil_christman I'm exaggerating, but the dad made the situation toxic by doing something in secret that the mom would literally have to pay for, rather than playing an appropriate paternal/spousal role to create consensus in advance.

As the GOP has proved (and proved and proved) is very hard to "win" shutdowns if your "ask" is something besides "continue funding existing programs at status quo levels."
Or rather, to have the Fit/Unfit distinction line up neatly w/modern bourgeois norms + ideas about psychological health/stability/etc. Communion for the stable + content, not the messed up and guilty and angst-ridden, in other words.
The @ddhitchens piece does a good job teasing out the problems with this approach, but probably tries too hard to make sense of its Fit/Unfit distinction, since the real point is not to have any Mr. Unfits at all.

@jbarro @ThePlumLineGS @KSoltisAnderson 2) WH position is "yes to protecting DACA recipients, no to increased chain migration." Any kind of DACA deal, let alone a broader DREAM deal, is likely to enable more chain migration absent some other concessions from Dems.
@jbarro @ThePlumLineGS @KSoltisAnderson 1) Dems are officially in favor of enforcing immigration laws, so in a "wall/border $ for DACA" deal they aren't giving up anything they're technically "in favor" of either.

@austeni The same logic runs the other way too. I wish more environmentalists were pro-life. But even if they were, it would not make sense to constantly demand that the Sierra Club pour its resources into fighting abortion.
@austeni I think *the Church* should not be indifferent to environmental issues. But an effective political movement has to have a core goal and impetus and agenda. And abortion is just not the same kind of wrong as ecological vandalism.
But that's different from a pro-life movement that recognizes that the "welcomed in life" half of "protected in law, welcomed in life" requires sustained policy thinking about motherhood and family. Which is desirable and necessary.
A seamless garment movement for "life" that tries to be against the death penalty and environmental despoilation and so on down a list of issues seems unlikely to make clear progress on the unique evil of abortion.
This recent op-ed in our paper, in which a pro-choice writer looks anew at what the best crisis pregnancy centers actually do, is a good example of what this kind of abortion and maternity-centric seamless garment means:	https://t.co/yWLdwLfkkf
That's the kind of seamless garment that, say, crisis pregnancy centers and adoption advocates to try to weave. But it's also part of what might motivate pro-life support for child tax credits, a child allowance, etc.
... I think there is another possible kind of "seamless garment" pro-life politics, which keeps abortion at the center and then tries to weave policies explicitly related to motherhood and childrearing around a core pro-life commitment.
Another brief thought for pro-life day. I'm a skeptic of a "seamless garment" Catholicism (or any other moral framework) that treats other social-justice as implicitly the equal of abortion in terms of their political and moral gravity. But ...
@biillyb It might be that this is as far as we can get under the current moral-cultural-political system. But if you assume the system, I don't think we're losing; I think we've made gains, reached an equilibrium, and should be looking for new lines of advance.
@biillyb Are we? We've passed a lot more pro-life laws in the last ten years, the abortion rate is way down, we get "pro-life" pluralities in polls ... I feel like the vanguard's had an effect, and what's needed are sweeps from the flanks.
I don't think I answered all of @tylercowen's questions well, but @roddreher has plucked out one of my better non-Watership Down answers:	https://t.co/mCMJ0sy4tW
@biillyb ... and also *we* should want pro-life laws to be accompanied by policies that mitigate the temptation to resort to illegal abortion, no? Independent of what the unpersuaded think, that's a good.
@biillyb ... and either requires more capacious policy thinking, I would hazard. Even just in terms of wanting to hold up, say, pro-life Texas as a place where maternal mortality is doing well, which it hasn't been lately ...
@biillyb Yes, that's true. But to make progress beyond red states you need *either* a much more ascendant pro-life GOP or a return of pro-life Democrats ...
@biillyb Not least because abortion still pricks the conscience of liberalism in a way that other things do not.
@biillyb Maybe, but then we're back in the larger questions about liberalism, and at present I write on abortion policy from the assumption -- borne out, to some extent, since 1973 -- that we can make gains under the current regime.
@biillyb And as politics requires compromise along the way, the compromises should be linked to policies that help us move on to the next step.
@biillyb Some anti-abortion regimes clearly work better than others. We should be working toward the kind that's most sustainable and effective and just.
@biillyb Yes. But the pro-life movement has succeeded as a social reform movement as well as a moral crusade, and further success requires anticipating what happens under different legal arrangements/social policies.

@amicabonis I think Rusty is trying to edit his way through an intellectual crisis for conservative Catholicism, in which the Neuhaus paradigm seems to be falling apart.

@MTMehan Also we have the luxury of a historical record to help us determine whether this strategy was prudent and effectively served the church's ultimate ends, and (to stretch a bit) whether providence approved. What happened to the papal states just after the Mortara case again ...?

@RyanTAnd Fr. Neuhaus's views on the Mortara case may not have been quite what people assume:	https://t.co/Fg5swNQFDB
@gjpappin @roddreher @avermeule ... the state of the church as well as the state of the civic order is relevant to the question, which is why the church's egregious recent failure to self-police on a sin that cries out for millstones is entirely reasonable to bring up in this sort of discussion.
@gjpappin @roddreher @avermeule I think there are historical contexts in which a fully self-governing church would advance justice more than her submission to civil procedures. Maybe we are headed toward one now. But again ...
@gjpappin @roddreher @avermeule One possible reason would be that appointing her own leaders is somewhat more essential to the church's mission than is imposing her own prison sentences on criminal clerics.
@avermeule @roddreher @gjpappin Broader historical perspectives are good. But the sex abuse crisis is not an "anecdote," but a systemic multi-decade failure with obvious relevance to debates about the church's relationship to civil law.
@avermeule @roddreher @gjpappin ... it's also reasonable for the church's stark failure to impose penalties that were at its disposal, when left to its own devices by friendly civil authorities (as in Boston), to inspire some doubt about a regime that leaves the legal punishment of clerics in clerical hands.
@avermeule @roddreher @gjpappin And while it is true that under #fullintegralism the church *could* have punished abusive priests fittingly itself in ways it cannot under liberalism ...
@avermeule @roddreher @gjpappin Rod has written, I believe, approximately 1,678,322 words about abuses of the family and children under liberalism over the last 10 years.
... which you see again in this data, including w/in racial/ethnic groups:	"In all, 23 percent of black men approved of Trump’s performance versus 11 percent of black women ... Among Hispanic men older than 50, Trump’s approval— strikingly—exceeded 40 percent."
One reason among many that I'm resistant to racial-determinism theories of Trump's appeal and lack thereof is that gender and class are much bigger distinctives for him compared to other GOP figures ...
A lot to chew on here:	https://t.co/i9tDKzaWYu
@go_oat No, but how people involved in that forward-looking project remember Catholic history will inevitably have a profound shaping effect. Neo-integralists are into Before Church and State for precisely that reason -- all forward-looking movements want a usable past, no?
@go_oat I just don't think it's quite so easy as all that.
@go_oat But that legacy of anti-Judaism is itself also part of the practice of pre-Vatican II Catholicism that neo-integralism would need to decide what to do with.
@go_oat I think I disagree; it's without these kind of sharpened questions that the "post-liberalism"/"neo-integralism" discussion feels hopelessly abstract.
@go_oat A response more easily rejected if our side of that argument is not committed to the claim that Pius IX acted wisely.
@go_oat Israel is indeed mildly integralist; it also wisely does not remove circumcised children from secular Jewish households and have them raised by Orthodox rabbis.

@Chateaubriand__ True enough. But in reviving a tradition it is helpful to pre-emptively acknowledge and learn from imprudence and excesses in its past.

@Chateaubriand__ That is not necessarily an encouraging sentiment on either front.
@Chateaubriand__ That is fair but as with liberalism the tendency to say, "but orthodoxy must override prudence" is historically very powerful.
@GabrielRossman @roddreher @firstthingsmag Can there be integralism without an inquisition is a question that the Catholic discussion about post-liberalism needs to answer. If the answer is "no," as it seems to be for some, admitting as much frankly is better than dancing around the point.
@GabrielRossman @roddreher @firstthingsmag It was a weird case but it was perfectly in keeping w/general logic that drove inquisitions and persecutions. So how a Catholic post-liberalism deals with Mortara is highly relevant to how it deals w/the larger legacy of Catholic coercion/persecution of Protestants and others.
@GabrielRossman @roddreher @firstthingsmag But if we take up that question, neo-integralists and Pius IX defenders need to acknowledge that we're taking it up: You can't just retreat and say, "oh, this was an isolated/weird case, let's not make it a test of integralism."
@GabrielRossman @roddreher @firstthingsmag All of the ongoing talk about recovering the church's 19th century political tradition, reviving integralism, pondering Catholic political thinking for a post-liberal age can be vague and abstract; it is useful to take up the specific question of coercion.
With respect to @GabrielRossman and @roddreher and others I think it may be a good thing that @firstthingsmag published a defense of Pius IX's conduct in the Mortara affair. It really does bring an ongoing intra-Catholic argument to a necessarily sharp point.

@go_oat I can see the value and the interest in discussing it, but the claim that only "liberalism" would make people shocked by the papal decision seems at best specious.
@amicabonis In the sense of the Young Catholics online who find this argument entirely persuasive.
@jneeley78 There is room between perfect reconciliation and perfect rejection.
I think it might profit neo-integralists to consider that not *every* technically-theologically-defensible decision the church and its popes made in the course of losing Europe to Protestantism and liberalism was actually wise and good and just.
