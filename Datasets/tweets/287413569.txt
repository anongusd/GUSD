Therefore, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should immediately begin working to pass this bill through Congress and tear down the wall of secrecy, so President Trump can fulfill his campaign pledge to audit the Federal Reserve. https://t.co/LadIMTH5VY
Audit the Fed is one of the few issues that unites libertarians, conservatives, and even sincere progressives like Bernie Sanders.
With the U.S. economy teetering on the verge of another Fed-created meltdown, Congress has no excuse to continue to prevent the American people from learning the full truth about the Fed’s conduct (and misconduct) of monetary policy.
@RepThomasMassie's continued leadership on Audit the Fed is just one reason why he is the “gold standard” of pro-liberty legislators in the House of Representatives.

...Assange remains in the Embassy for fear of being extradited to the US for prosecution. His "crime"? Publishing things the government does not want us to know.		Now that Trump is president, he has the power to do something good. Assange is a journalist who needs to be pardoned!
The American people elected Trump because they were looking to him to "drain the swamp" that Wikileaks had exposed.		Assange has been in solitary confinement in the Ecuadorian embassy for more than 6 years. Though the original charges have been dropped against him...
Presidential candidate Donald Trump said “I love Wikileaks,” on the campaign trail. Back then, Trump praised Wikileaks for promoting transparency. 		In fact, Trump 'loved' Wikileaks so much he mentioned the organization more than 140 times in the final month of his campaign!

Taxes do not create wealth, but destroy it.		With tariffs, the U.S. federal government is "raiding" the American standard of living.
When two parties voluntarily agree to trade with one another, it is not a "raid." A raid is when one party uses violent force to confiscate another person's property.		Americans pay the tariffs.		American money is going into the U.S. government's coffers. https://t.co/iqH3DXKIIQ
Here’s some unsolicited advice to President Trump: 		Listen to the people who elected you, who are tired of the US as the world’s police force. Give all your “experts” a pink slip and start over with a real pro-American foreign policy -- 		Non-interventionism.
- General Smedley Butler - At the time of his death in 1940, the most decorated Marine in U.S. history.
...I believe, as something that is not what it seems to the majority of the people. Only a small 'inside' group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many.”
“War is a racket. It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described..

Of course these "experts" are going to advise him to keep the failures going.		The president is not being "tough" with his "experts," and is not been "smart" in allowing America's longest war to keep grinding on.
Trump told interviewers that “every expert that I have and speak to says if we don’t go there, they’re going to be fighting over here. And I’ve heard it over and over again.”		The president has chosen to surround himself with people who want to continue our failed foreign policy.
Three U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan, which at 17 years, is America's longest war.		Trump Tweeted back in 2015: "When will our leaders get tough and smart. We are being led to slaughter!"		This week, Trump was asked why America is still in Afghanistan.

Government *does not know* what should be created in the marketplace. Its actions are always political.		Stop the waste. Stop the corporate welfare.		End all government subsidies.
When the government subsidizes an industry, taxpayer money is forcefully taken away, meaning consumers have less of their own money to buy the things *that they want.* 		The stolen money then goes to crony corporations to create things *that consumers don't want* at the moment.
First the farmers needed a bailout...Now GM is going to ax 14,000 jobs...and iPhones may get even more expensive.		Tariffs are a tax PAID BY AMERICANS!		The American standard of living goes down when taxes are increased.		Get rid of all tariffs right now. https://t.co/hocBHbsMCP

'Making America Great...Or Poorer? Dissecting The State Of The Union Speech' - today on the Liberty Report:	https://t.co/4EmvP3CLbK
Summary: The most dangerous part of the speech was the glorification of militarism and our aggressive foreign policy. Sadly, the Members' over-enthusiastic response to the militarism was not encouraging. #SOTU
All politicians take an oath to defend the Constitution agains threats foreign and domestic. Sadly they have little consideration about those domestic threats.
Cold War is alive and well! Military-industrial complex and Deep State still in charge. #SOTU
NO benefit to go out of our way to provoke Iran. They are not going to attack America. #SOTU
Really serving American interests would be to keep foreign aid in the pockets of Americans! Americans get their money first! #SOTU
Looks like the war on Afghanistan will continue into its 17th year. Longest in US history. Not telling enemies our plans - but do American people get to know? #SOTU
Occupation is the greatest incentive for Americans to be attacked. If you want us safe, bring our troops home from 150+ countries! #SOTU
How about a little more diplomacy instead of threats and sanctions? #SOTU
7,500 nukes are enough. We don't need any more nukes!	#SOTU
We're not lacking power. We are the most powerful country in the history of the world -- weapons, military, etc. We don't need more spending to enrich the military-industrial complex! #SOTU
Expanding the war on drugs is NOT the way to solve the problem! Get rid of the drug war! #SOTU
Prime function of the Federal government is NOT protecting our safety! It is the preservation of our Liberty. That forgotten word... #SOTU
Paid family leave = wage and price control! #SOTU
Job training under our Constitution and in a free society is not the job of the federal government! #SOTU
When big business gets in bed with big government to "rebuild infrastructure" it invites crony capitalism! #SOTU
Too bad we continue to spend so much money RE-BUILDING the cities we've blown up in the Middle East! That money would have been better spent building our own infrastructure! #SOTU
President @realDonaldTrump is right to get out of NAFTA and WTO along with the other phony trade deals. But protectionism and trade wars are definitely NOT the answer! #SOTU
Terminally ill should have access to experimental drugs - yes! But in a free market all free individuals should be able to make decisions on what kinds of medicine they wish to take. Like marijuana. #SOTU
Lots of praise for bipartisanship and "coming together" but coming together is not really the answer if it means coming together on bad foreign policy, bad monetary policy, deficit financing, massive military spending and foreign entanglements. #SOTU
Cutting taxes is a good thing, for sure. But it doesn't mean much if you don't cut the spending.
Are you going to be watching #SOTU  State of the Union speech tonight? I'll be live-Tweeting the speech! See you then! https://t.co/9ANZRBhzUR

1/2 Bin Laden gave us 3 reasons for 9/11: decade bombing Iraq; unfair treatment for Palestinians; US military in Saudi Arabia.
2/2 @LindseyGrahamSC needs to learn some history!
RT @justinamash: There's nothing hasty about ending America's longest war. @POTUS bowed to military-industrial establishment; doubled down…
Beware! @LindseyGrahamSC loves Trump's speech! Why are arch-neocons celebrating so much? Very telling!
Our ultimately "hasty" departure from Vietnam finally ended a lot of grief. Even if it came way too late.
If Americans are tired of 16 year war, how will they feel about another decade or two? When will they wake up?
Big issue of the night: US expanding the war into Pakistan. Could precipitate more conflict between nuclear India and Pakistan.
So many of our problems are self-inflicted by a deeply flawed foreign policy. US troops - and the family members - suffer the consequences.
How many Americans are really sitting around worrying about an Afghan terrorist coming over and killing them?
The emphasis on the "grave danger" of terrorism is greatly exaggerated. But more intervention surely creates more terrorism.
More killing is not the road to peace.
Nothing new. More of the same. Obama was wrong. This is NOT the good war. Sooner we get out the better.
Shorter Trump: "Afghanistan: give us your minerals!"
Terrorism is one thing, but what about massive collateral damage? Killing civilians creates more terrorism. Round and round we go.
Emphasis on military alliance with India may well lead to more vicious war between nuclear states Pakistan and India. Smart?
Emphasis on Pakistan just means the war going to be expanded!
@realDonaldTrump is promising that endless war will bring "everlasting peace."
The American people deserve to know when we are going to war and MUST give you permission through their representatives in Congress!
Remember: there was no al-Qaeda until our foolish invasion of Iraq based on neocon lies.
The promoters of war win. The American people lose. #Afghanistan
So far very discouraging. Sounds like pure neocon foreign policy.
What's wrong with rapid exit? We just marched in we can just march out.
Planned in Afghanistan? What about Saudi Arabia??
Mr. President it's too bad you do not follow your instincts.
Sad that these wars the politicians argue for are unconstitutional yet we are told we are over there defending the Constitution.
The military personnel are the victims of bad foreign policy.
Steve Bannon brakes removed. Neocons feeling their oats.
Hoping for the best in tonight's @realDonaldTrump speech but fearful that foreign intervention is only going to get worse.  #Afghanistan

Ron's Tweetstorm - Was Trump's Speech Libertarian?	https://t.co/1MfAGquZrN
Final grade on libertarian scale: Plans/strategy: F 	Overall: D-
Never said audit the fed. No spending cuts. More foreign intervention. Word "liberty" not mentioned once.
Now the grades: His vision for the US at its 250th anniversary: A-	His methods to achieve it? He gets: F.
Nations can chart their own paths? Good! Then we can bring our troops home from 120 countries!
Militarism gone wild. It's all going off the rails. Strongly support NATO? I though we were getting out!
Our war in Yemen has nothing to do with US national security. Unconstitutional for us to be bombing that country!
Warmongering is alive and well. Tragically. Focus on the widow. What a terrible use of tragedy for political purposes.
"Highly successful raid" in Yemen? In many ways the raid was a disaster! A waste. Criminal what they are put through for political reasons.
'Biggest increase in military spending in history' - bad, bad news. And nothing for defense, all for militarism.
If you really want to reduce the violence in our cities...get rid of the drug war!
What happened to getting rid of the Department of Education? Where have all the Constitutionalists gone?
Unite? Yes we need it! Libertarians and progressives should unite to stop the wars!
Bring down drug prices? Great, but by removing monopolies not by price controls!
Tax credits and medical savings accounts? We should agree with that. Patients' choice!
Medical care should be like cell phones and computers - competition makes them cheaper and cheaper! And better and better!
Repeal Obamacare? OK. But why government involved in medicine at all?
One trillion dollars for infrastructure. But Treasury is empty. No money in bank. Answer: just print more! Same old, same old.
Wages are going down, for sure. But it's a consequence of bad Fed monetary policy!
Merit-based immigration is a good idea. No welfare magnet for illegal immigrants would work well too.
Lincoln is NOT my favorite president!
Reducing corporate taxes -- great idea! But you MUST also cut spending! Otherwise: disaster!
Trade protectionism will not solve our problems. Protective tariffs will hurt the working class!
Agree on Americans out of work force and economic problems. But don't blame it on trade! Blame the Fed -- no: END THE FED!
More Iran sanctions? Sounds like preparation for war against Iran to me!
Strong vetting system - is it a step to a Real ID card -- an attack on our civil liberties and privacy protections.
Protect against "radical Islamic terrorism"? Can't do it until you understand concept of Blowback! Non-intervention would make us safer.
Great wall on southern border? Hopefully not to keep us in. Reduce incentives to illegally cross and change foreign policy! Problem solved!
A great idea to reduce violent crime! How about stopping government violence at home and abroad?
Building pipelines? OK but hopefully without use of eminent domain (property theft)!
Reducing regulations? Sounds like a great idea to me! Remove two old regs for one new one? OK.
Corporate intimidation is not an answer to our economic malaise!
