@Quadeus @brokenwing2005 @realDonaldTrump Trump has no loyalty to the United States, he would surely be happy to live out his days on a cocktail of Adderall and Viagra in Moscow as a #PutinPuppet, perhaps opening up a Trump Gentleman's Club in Moscow where he would be conducting predatory "beauty pageants". https://t.co/r5AqezvmUD

@Wallyrus51 After 45 years of local Alaska Democrats being unable to beat Don Young, and no one else standing up against #ANWR drilling, I've stepped up. I'm just a regular person who cares enough to make a difference. I'm retired now and this is the time in my life to do something to help.
@dougrbbns @JoMarieT @Wallyrus51 @AlyseGalvin Building an industry around higher education (with universities built using federal dollars) and becoming a global tech hub is the future for Alaska. With free college for all, this will be an easy path to succeed with. Education and technology are sustainable for the long term.
@Wallyrus51 Alaska is a state and I am a U.S. citizen. It is my business, just as much as it is yours. As far as someone trying to divide the Democratic Party, Alyse Galvin is not a Democrat and her running is to keep an actual Dem off the ballot and so her husband's co. can drill #ANWR.
@coyotetrail_ @dtkockler @AlyseGalvin @OurArcticRefuge Another time Galvin publicly endorsed #ANWR drilling (which I am against): "AG: I support oil exploration in the 1002 Area of ANWR" https://t.co/RKMFl4eAox
@coyotetrail_ @dtkockler @AlyseGalvin @OurArcticRefuge She has many times publicly stated her support for #ANWR drilling, example: "Galvin...advocated for oil exploration and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge." https://t.co/2SSHmuGhmM
@AlaskaBecks Actually it would be a vote for Great Bear Petroleum. The big oil company from TX, where her husband Patrick Galvin is a top executive. The largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope and wanting to drill #ANWR. Which she is totally supporting. That is who she really is.
@StopBigMoney @AlyseGalvin LOL Right wing Alyse Galvin is fully financially supported at home by her husband Patrick Galvin, a top executive at Great Bear Petroleum, a big oil company that wants to drill #ANWR and is already the largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope. And she's not a Democrat.
@JoMarieT @Wallyrus51 @dougrbbns @AlyseGalvin I'm an actual Democrat - and Democratic Socialist, with decades of UNION STRONG dedication - while Alyse is a right wing candidate who wants to drill #ANWR. I'm rock solid, can't say the same thing for Great Bear Petroleum's Alyse Galvin or Russian opportunist Dimitri Shein.
@AnchorageDSA @SheinDimitri Yet Dimitri Shein outsources all of his weed grow box manufacturing to avoid providing health benefits for his workers...But has $140k cash laying around to dump into his campaign. Hypocrite. If he's such a successful biz man, why can't he hire union workers? Opportunist.
@AnchorageDSA That's funny, because Alyse Galvin is NOT a Democrat!
@AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin In other words: Alyse Galvin really means her husband Patrick's big oil company Great Bear Petroleum is the largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope, and she will make sure nothing stands in the way of her family profiting off of wrecking the environment in the #ANWR...
@JoMarieT @Wallyrus51 @dougrbbns @AlyseGalvin Alyse Galvin has the policies of a Republican, and her run is with the goal of keeping a real Democrat off the ballot in November. She supports #ANWR drilling and the big oil company where her husband is a top executive is the largest North Slope exploration leaseholder. Scammer!
@CarenaAK @dtkockler @AlyseGalvin She's running with the goal of preventing any actual Democrat from being on the November ballot. Alaska's Democrats need to see through Alyse Galvin's scam and vote Carol "Kitty" Hafner for Congress on August 21st!
@CarenaAK @AlyseGalvin Alyse Galvin is running as part of Great Bear Petroleum's political project. She's a DINO without even the (D). Her husband Patrick is a top exec at Great Bear, and they have the most exploration leases in North Slope out of any company. She is using dems to drill #ANWR.

@coyotetrail_ @dtkockler @AlyseGalvin @OurArcticRefuge The fact is Alyse Galvin will NEVER be against #ANWR drilling, because her husband is an executive at Great Bear which is the largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope. She wants to drill there, and her family will profit from #ANWR drilling. I'm the only one saying NO!
@1DianeMarie @Iceblue52Roth @SenDanSullivan @lisamurkowski @SenateGOP @SenateDems @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @AkGovBillWalker I have trouble viewing someone as not taking corporate money, when they are fully financially supported by their spouse, a man who is a top executive of a big oil company that is the largest exploration leaseholder in the North Slope and they want to drill in the #ANWR...
@JessicaFWalker @Ch2KTUU We're all Americans and I'm running on the issues, not a zip code. I will be living in Alaska after the primary, as required by the US Constitution. We are one country, and stopping #ANWR drilling is a national issue. The #AKDems have failed to win in 45yrs. Need a new approach.
@TammieStoops Did you know I'm the only candidate who is opposed to #ANWR drilling to #ProtectTheArctic? Alyse Galvin wants to drill there and her husband Patrick Galvin is an executive with big oil company Great Bear, which has the most exploration leases in the North Slope.
@Ch2KTUU I am the only real #progressive, registered #Democrat #woman in the race. I am a #DemocraticSocialist, #Feminist, and #Environmentalist. I will fight to #ProtectTheArctic by stopping #ANWR drilling. I will fight to federally #legalizemarijuana #BlueWave2018 #Alaska #Congress
@jbendery Then she shouldn't be able to run in a Democratic Party primary, there are two actual Democrats running who should be the ones competing for party support. The fact she supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a #Trump policy. Real Democrats #ProtectTheArctic.
@jbendery 1. Alyse Galvin is NOT a Democrat. 2. Her husband Patrick is a top executive with Great Bear Petroleum. 3. Alyse and Great Bear want to drill in the #ANWR and already has most exp. leases in North Slope. 4. Great Bear has ties to Halliburton. She's a DINO without even a (D).
@coyotetrail_ @AlyseGalvin @OurArcticRefuge Seeing that RICH Alyse Galvin lives in the same home as her husband Patrick Galvin, an EXECUTIVE with Great Bear Petroleum, the largest leaseholder in the North Slope w/ ties to Halliburton, she is taking big oil and gas money everyday. Her "struggling mom" image is all bs.

@rkbezzie @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin If someone's spouse was anti-union (and being anti-union was their spouse's job), and they were running for office, would I trust them to support unions? Absolutely not. It has nothing to do with gender, simply that when people are married, their primary loyalty is to each other.
@JesseKiehl @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin I have not hit the threshold that requires filing. "If the campaign has not exceeded the $5,000 threshold, it is not required to file reports." https://t.co/2dpyH4DcpI
@Phrozen_ @von_g_frost @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin I'm 64, and the #ANWR drilling needs to be stopped now, between my age and all the environmental issues, I don't have the time left to run for local level offices first. While Don Young might want to die in office, I don't think Congress should be a nursing home. Now or never.
@rkbezzie @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin When someone who is running for office does not pay their own bills and has a spouse who is a big oil executive oligarch, there is no question that their decisions will be influenced by their spouse. I do not have any such conflicts and come from a working-class background!
@Phrozen_ @von_g_frost @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin After winning the primary I will move to Alaska, and in Congress you are up for reelection every two years. So I will need to work hard for Alaskans and demonstrate results in order to keep my seat. Even Begich lost his Senate seat to the GOP, so I will need to produce for #AK.
@Phrozen_ @von_g_frost @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin These companies are simply coming to take the oil and leave. No different than BP being based in London, but the second the oil is gone, so is the company. I'm running for office to represent the people, not take resources.
@von_g_frost @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin Great Bear Petroleum was formed and based in Dripping Springs, Texas in 2010 with investors and got oil and gas leases in Alaska. The Great Bear companies are legally registered in TX and DE, not Alaska.
@WillMuldoon I do know what "off the grid" living is like, and after winning the primary going to places like the honey bucket villages will be possible for my campaign. I will also have to begin filing FEC reports as I am sure at that point I will quickly go over the threshold btw.
@von_g_frost @Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin Great Bear is the largest exploration leaseholder on the North Slope, holding 579,374 gross acres.
@WillMuldoon Part of my platform includes building out broadband to cover everyone (some locations may still require wireless or satellite links) so this is an issue I do care about btw.
@WillMuldoon Even if all ppl don't have it, satellite phones and satellite internet do exist, and can be powered via solar or generators the capability is there. I sure would like to meet the people there, but at this point I can't afford to travel there. Don has a federal budget for that.
@datamanAK @WillMuldoon The candidate Will is referencing. I never called Anchorage "austere" and actually disagreed with the assessment, given the city's population and infrastructure.
@WillMuldoon My campaign is very transparent. I don't take any corporate money, and am entirely funded via small donations and I haven't even hit the reporting threshold. My expenses have also been very limited. We can talk more about it if you desire, but my spending is very limited.
@WillMuldoon Alaska is also the kind of state where there are a lot of places that are difficult to get to, and there is no need to create a bunch of pollution due to things like travelling all over. We have the internet, we have communications. Even the most remote village can reach me.
@WillMuldoon Doing the kind of campaigning I have been is certainly a large amount of work. This has been my main activity all summer. My message is obviously getting out, and after winning the primary I will be on the ground. But at 64 years old, I need to be ready to go for the general.
@WillMuldoon Things like ANWR drilling and climate change impact us all, Alaska is America and we're all in this together. The local AK Dems have had 45 years to beat Don Young. No one has. Why now? The country is in serious trouble and I'm 64 years old.
@WillMuldoon While any donation is appreciated, to be accurate you're not the largest donor, but again this campaign is about ideas and not money, so I am still thankful. The constitution allows for me to run, and I have ideas I'm bringing to the table. No one else is opposing #ANWR drilling!
@WillMuldoon What is your question exactly, Will? While I appreciate your donation I'm not sure what you're asking me. As I said, this campaign really has not been about spending money, and using the internet, costs have been kept exceedingly low.
@WillMuldoon If you didn't notice, Will I am extremely frugal and if you have a good message and utilize things like the internet, I don't really see why a campaign needs to spend huge amounts of money. Plastic signs and lit are bad 4 environment. The voters either want me or not. Their call.
@WillMuldoon Not anywhere near $5,000.
@WillMuldoon Sorry but you are incorrect, Will. "If the campaign has not exceeded the $5,000 threshold, it is not required to file reports." https://t.co/yxxTAOTqYX
@datamanAK @WillMuldoon I didn't make that comment...
@WillMuldoon I am not required to file, that's why you are not finding anything, because there is nothing to file. This is a grassroots campaign based on a message, not money.
@WillMuldoon I am retired from a career in higher education. I have no conflicts of interest, like someone whose spouse is actively an oil executive who wants to drill in the #ANWR and is actively lobbying for the gov to subsidize the oil industry https://t.co/dNTSoXnrQd
@WillMuldoon We're talking about a man who is a TOP EXECUTIVE of an oil company. He is at the top of their corporate ladder. Patrick Galvin isn't some distant relative, he is her spouse whom she is married to and funds Alyse Galvin day in and day out. Patrick Galvin is a not a mere "worker".
@Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin It's political double speak for doing nothing. What we need is UNIVERSAL Healthcare via Medicare For All. Alyse Galvin might be "undeclared" but she sure sounds like she has GOP talking points on healthcare. Funny thing is her family gets insurance through Great Bear Petroleum...
@RushNance @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a national wildlife refuge of the United States of America, I am an American and Alyse Galvin wants to pollute this pristine location with oil drilling. Who stands to benefit? Big oil corporations like Great Bear Petroleum! #ANWR
@Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin Every time Patrick Galvin gets paid from Great Bear Petroleum and that money goes into their joint checking account and pays Alyse's bills in their shared household, Alyse Galvin is being funded by Great Bear Petroleum, the entire Galvin family runs on big oil corporate dollars.
@Stormflowering @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin Nonsense excuse. The gender of the spouse is not the issue, and Patrick Galvin is not simply a "worker" but an EXECUTIVE who is running the show at Great Bear Petroleum. Great Bear Petroleum pays the bills of Alyse Galvin and puts money into her pockets. #bigoil
@LiebeAlaska @AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin Great Bear is running Alyse Galvin...
@AnchorageDSA @AlyseGalvin Alyse Galvin is a LIAR. She is the wife of Patrick Galvin, an EXECUTIVE with GREAT BEAR PETROLEUM. Don't see that anywhere on her flyer! Wonder why? Alyse Galvin is a corporate candidate, her run is a political project for Great Bear Petroleum, who wants to drill #ANWR!

@MarnalovesAK @WillMuldoon 45 years is too long for Don Young to have been in office! I know I will do the job with integrity, and I've spent a lot of time researching local issues. In state and local government, many officials get hired from far away places, and do a good job for the community they serve.
@MarnalovesAK @WillMuldoon Don Young has made homophobic and racist statements, as well as very insensitive and false comments regarding suicide to high school students in #AK, and has sold his soul to the energy industry. #AKDems had 45 years to produce a winning local challenger. Time to go Outside!
@MarnalovesAK @WillMuldoon South Dakota is currently my base, but I will move up to Alaska after winning the primary, it is required under the U.S. Constitution to be an inhabitant of the state at the time of election.
@WillMuldoon Jim Keady D ran this year in the district you're referring to and was a really terrific candidate. He had done much work exposing Nike sweatshops in Asia, did social justice work in the community too. I was sad he didn't win the primary, he's a true gentleman with great ideas! https://t.co/Qm5GRagRvv

Many urban areas across the United States have seen negative effects from illicit injection drug use in public places. Supervised injection sites offer a harm reduction alternative to move drug abuse off the streets, and into a safer medical environment: https://t.co/I9Zh1vcICu
@Rockies5342 Read about the concept here https://t.co/I9Zh1vcICu
@Rockies5342 It's not perfect but it is a lot more manageable for society. A lot of people consider these ideas like it's if we offer this, people will use. The problem is people are already using and society has no control, this at least puts things under control. HIV and Hep C = serious.
@Rockies5342 With harm reduction services and safe injection sites, addicts can be told you either go to the 24 hr safe injection site w/ medical supervision to use (and stay until they say ur sober enough to leave) or face arrest. Rehabs can be located in same facility with push to enter.
@Rockies5342 I wish people wouldn't abuse dangerous drugs. But when just say no fails, we haven't had an answer. Harm reduction and med maintenance programs w/ Drs in controlled places would at least contain the problems, reduce thefts, bankrupt cartels, and put addicts into rehab.
@Rockies5342 Meth has ravaged all the western states, and I know that in your area, it is very visible in the downtown. The housing crunch has been really rough on a lot of working-class people too. Combined, it is a storm of misery in society. We need more housing, and more treatment beds.

@Rockies5342 Also problem is that homeless services are really self-serving for the people who work in them. There is no real path to getting homeless into housing and either employed or onto disability. It is more expensive 2 keep people on streets vs housing but too many $ for "nonprofits".
@Rockies5342 Complex long term problems that need fed program $ 2 fix, TV reports on Denver street kids back to 1990s. CO housing is too expensive and like AK very low fed disability approval rates, federal funds anyway. But w leg MJ across USA = less of a magnet for mass relocation to CO.

@IndivisibleANC I'm an American. Dimitri says his hometown is in Russia, and he didn't even move to the US until he was a teen. Where are his loyalties? He refuses to hire American workers for his company, because he makes more profits OUTSOURCING, his loyalties sure don't seem to be to the US!
@shanoneflynn OUTSOURCING Dimitri is a Russian con artist and NOT A (D) Alyse's husband is a BIG OIL EXECUTIVE who pumping $ into the race so he can pump oil out of the ANWR at the expense of the environment. OUTSOURING Dimitri is completely unqualified and puts his profits over labor rights!
@IndivisibleANC OUTSOURCING RUSSIAN Dimitri has admitted that he doesn't hire American workers because he doesn't want to provide health benefits for his workers. He is very much choosing not to hire Americans and not support unions. Supporting American union labor isn't isolationist, it's fair!
@Iceblue52Roth Thanks. I need to go to DC so I can fight for the issues, in order to do that I need to win the primary. Between my experience and tough as nails style, I'm the only candidate who can beat Don in November. Let's work together to make that happen so I can be your voice in DC!
The only kind of #ICE we need in this country is the kind that goes in a drink. Not the gestapo police agency that separates families and terrorizes immigrants! I'm running to #AbolishICE and #MakeAmericaSaneAgain! Will you join me?
@Iceblue52Roth This is the truth about Dimitri. His supporters have been going around making up lies about me and my campaign. He's not qualified and while he might talk the talk, he doesn't walk the walk. I am an ethical and principled candidate.
@akfrozenpea I got into this race to beat Don Young, stop #ANWR drilling, and stand up for working-class people in #Alaska. I haven't taken a dime from corporations or special interests and won't. I hope you have seen my website w/ platform and I can answer any questions you may have.
@akfrozenpea My apology if it came across that way, was not my intent. My opponents seem to be putting a lot of crazy things in the rumor mill, but I thought the residency thing was pretty upfront. On the elections website I list an out-of-state address and news media has reported it too.
@Alaskagirl149 @akfrozenpea I might not have been as lucky as you to be originally from a place as beautiful as Alaska, but I have what it takes to be your voice in DC and will become a resident in time for the general election. I've put a lot of time into learning about the issues that matter to Alaskans.
@akfrozenpea I've worked as a Flight Attendant and in Higher Education. As a Flight Attendant, I flew all over and had apartments in many different places. In Higher Education, people in leadership roles are hired from around the country. Serving in Congress is about getting the job done!
@Alaskagirl149 @akfrozenpea It seemed as though she was already aware of the answer to the question when I first replied, but I'm always glad to clarify. It's time for new blood to come in and unseat Don Young, since in 45 years no one locally has been up to the task!
@akfrozenpea Not yet, but after winning the primary I will establish residency in the state to meet the constitutional requirement in time for the general election. Federal candidates must be an inhabitant of the state when elected.
@akfrozenpea For 45 years the Alaska Democratic Party has failed to produce a winning candidate, and my opponents in the 2018 primary are self-serving idiots. I am an honest, ethical American citizen and eligible for the office. After 45 years of losing, you should be glad I'm running!
The #SCOTUS made a terrible decision in Janus, that harms working-class Americans. Our current government is simply an organization that is designed to make the rich richer, and keep working-class people poor. We won't do "more with less", workers are who create the wealth!
One of my opponents, Dimitri Shein claims to be a progressive, but he has the marijuana grow boxes that he sells manufactured overseas in China! A real progressive would hire American workers, and union workers at that! What a sham candidate! Shame on him! Vote Hafner!
I refuse any donations from BIG OIL! But one of my opponents, Alyse Galvin, is married to Patrick Galvin, an EXECUTIVE with GREAT BEAR PETROLEUM and she wants to drill in the #ANWR! Talk about a CONFLICT OF INTEREST! Alaska Democrats shouldn't be fooled by this BIG OIL candidate!
We must bring #PrEP to all Americans who are at risk of #HIV w/ #MedicareForAll . It is possible to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic that has ravished our most vulnerable communities. But @repdonyoung doesn't care because he hates #LGBT, #poor, and #minorities. I care and love all ppl! https://t.co/aN7fR3My2p
Whenever people ask me if I heard about that crazy thing Donald Trump just did, I always have to ask them to be more specific, because he seems to do a lot of crazy things in a very short span of time. We need leadership in this country that is stable, not a bad reality TV show!
@NanaWithSoul @lisamurkowski @SenDanSullivan @repdonyoung Governments often institute blood quorums regarding indigenous peoples in order to deny rights to indigenous peoples. One person is one person, and the heritage is theirs to practice, but the government often doesn't want to accept this. We must end this racism and colonialism!
