I am committed to working with @POTUS and my colleagues in Congress to continue improving America's Promise, Prosperity and Safety for Texas families.
We must answer the president‚Äôs call to put aside the partisanship and come together to work for the common good of our nation ‚Äì just as we did in the 115th Congress (2017-2018), when we passed over 400 bills that were signed by @POTUS, 99% of which were bipartisan.
A prosperous and safe America requires improved border security. We also need to strive to reform our dysfunctional immigration laws, develop a solution for our Dreamer population, improve our nation‚Äôs infrastructure, strengthen our national security &amp; promote free &amp; fair trade.
This evening, @POTUS put forth his priorities to continue to deliver a stronger, more secure and more prosperous America.
"We must keep America first in our hearts.  We must keep freedom alive in our souls.  And we must always keep faith in America's destiny -- that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" #SOTU

Trade is critical to America's Promise, Prosperity and Safety. #SOTU

"The United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world." #SOTU
The Right to Try Act improves access to experimental treatments for patients with terminal diseases or conditions. This new law gives terminally-ill patients can have a fighting chance to survive and recover. #SOTU
Our new tax code is simpler and fairer ‚Äì it lowers tax rates for both individuals and small businesses, nearly doubles the standard deduction, doubles the child tax credit and repeals Obamacare‚Äôs individual mandate tax. #SOTU
Since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, hardworking American families and small businesses have benefited from our bold, pro-growth tax reform. #SOTU
For 16 consecutive months, America has created at least 100,000 jobs, including over 300,000 jobs in January. #SOTU
The unemployment rate has been at or below 4% for 11 consecutive months, something we have not experienced in nearly 50 years. #SOTU
More Americans are finding jobs, wages continue to grow and those that were previously discouraged are once again benefiting from a thriving job market. #SOTU

ICE keeps hardworking Americans families safe; therefore, any notion to abolish this vital agency is misguided and would ultimately leave our communities vulnerable to the spread of illegal narcotics, human trafficking, gang activity and illegal border crossings.

ICE was established in 2003 in response to the 9/11 attacks to, in part, keep our borders safe. Since then, ICE has been on the frontlines combating terrorism, investigating the flow of illegal narcotics, stopping human trafficking and dismantling child exploitation operations.

.@andy_hogue .@andy_hogue NOT TRUE--I went on national TV on Sunday and explained the need for the EO and criticized the botched roll-out.
.@gvlacy @POTUS Who's laughing?
.@Blackferne Russian hacking investigation is ongoing.  NATO is very important today and needs to be beefed up/ / restructured 4 new risks
.@drdrAatBLC @ErnieLies @SwHonza  We always have and always will release fully finalized schedule in plenty of time for constituent planning
.@gregstoll @ParentofSam1 Flawed logic if you think fewer will join ISIS because of no EO.
.@deezy07 @ErnieLies @SwHonza Final times and details are pending while our Team works on details.  We always provide plenty of notice.
.@Lystless Yes
.@ErnieLies @SwHonza Not true, we have town halls scheduled in mid-April; we have posted this many times.
.@Addy2D @thegamesahead That is absolute BS--we tried to work with the Obama Administration, however, he ignored his own security folks &amp; us
.@thegamesahead I commit to do this!
.@thegamesahead Trust me--they got an earful from House GOP this week.  They have assured us they won't mess up like this again.
.@onstat_z In my opinion and based upon the classified briefings I have received, the EO gives us a chance to keep us safer.
.@ProfessorJepson I will follow the Constitution.
.@ParentofSam1 So you think ISIS will be kinder and gentler to Americans if we reverse the EO?  That is patently absurd.
.@WilliamAEstes part 2-- we are now working with foreign govts, so folks delayed overseas can now travel here.  Should be fixed soon.
.@WilliamAEstes Yes, the roll-out was botched and folks with visas and green cards were improperly delayed.  Those folks have been released.
.@thegamesahead I have to agree with you; the roll-out of the EO was botched badly.  I believe the administration learned a lesson on this.
16-I am disappointed that you feel that way, however, I will not waiver.	Thank you 	Bill
15-Some of you have been critical of me for exercising this Constitutional responsibility;
14-I take this responsibility seriously and I will not ever bow to any political  or protest pressure in this regard.
13-Under our Constitution, the number one responsibility of the federal government is to protect our country.
12-&amp; the Trump administration to correct these issues.  President Trump‚Äôs short-term delay in the refugee program gives us a chance 2 do so
11-Our system is flawed, our nation‚Äôs Intelligence and our Homeland Security agencies know this and they are counting on Congress
10-yardsticks to measure either quality or effectiveness.
9-That said, when it comes to national security, the length of time and the number of boxes checked in a process should not be used as
8-numerous steps ‚Äì it does.
7-While we are on the subject of refugee vetting, several folks have posted that our current vetting system takes a lot of time &amp; involves
6-I cannot and will not be a part of putting our nation at risk by disclosing the weaknesses of our currently flawed vetting process.
5-and terrorists to achieve refugee status; thus putting them in a position to harm our families and our country.
4-Just think about what it means to make our current weaknesses public--this information would essentially provide a ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù for criminals
3-information would ultimately see the significant downside to making this information public.
2-I have deferred responding to those requests because I assumed that common sense would prevail and that the persons requesting this
1-We have received numerous requests on social media asking me 2 explicitly point out the weaknesses of our current refugee vetting process.
I trust that my colleagues in the Senate will confirm Judge Gorsuch.
I am particularly pleased with Judge Gorsuch‚Äôs efforts to uphold the constitutional right of religious liberty through his career.
Judge Gorsuch is a phenomenal nominee for the Supreme Court. His commitment to judicial restraint will serve the Court and our country well.
Thrilled that @POTUS fulfilled his pledge to nominate a judge who has a demonstrated loyalty to the Constitution &amp; strong commitment to life

.@IndivisibleTX17 Under Constitution, districts are reallocated every 10 years following Census.  Texas grew and picked up 4 seats.
.@tom_goodrum I totally agree and we strive to do so!
.@drdrAatBLC @Chardros @MattPMiller @thenation Another article, not a legal ruling.
.@MakelyHome @drdrAatBLC That means Chet won 3 elections in the "illegally gerrymandered district".  I guess they didn't gerrymander it well
.@kristenpetroff I must be standing up well for a majority of our constituents.  Last election = 61%, most votes I ever received.
.@drdrAatBLC @MakelyHome A democrat held the district for 20 years; however, I beat him and the district is suddenly illegal?  Interesting
.@drdrAatBLC @MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron May want to check your facts -- I beat Chet in 2010 under a different district map.
.@Chardros @MattPMiller If there had been allegations of illegality, the judges would have changed TX-17.
.@frankstrong What is your evidence?  Have you asked the folks at UT or the Austin Chamber about what I have done for the community?
.@MattPMiller This isn't a legal opinion.
.@MattPMiller https://t.co/L9NNEXl50M
.@MattPMiller Well, I guess everyone is entitled to an opinion.  I use facts while representing the great folks in TX-17.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron Why don't you file the suit so you can find out if you are right?
.@abilenerob @MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron The federal judges were unethical?  I bet they would be interested to hear that.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron Your "belief" -- Until that time, despite your opinion the District is legal and Constitutional.
.@frankstrong @MattPMiller @MakelyHome Our votes are all publicly available and we are transparent in everything we do.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron "likey" is your opinion, not a LEGAL opinion.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron A newspaper article is legal proof?  Wow, must be a new type of legal analysis.  #imagination
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron You have failed to provide any legally valid proof of ANY type of gerrymandering.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron @washingtonpost Gosh, I didn't see TX-17 in that case.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron The Chronicle reference is a newspaper article, not a legal opinion, court opinion, or case law.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron You have provided ZERO legal proof of an illegal gerrymander.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron The ENTIRE TX map including ALL districts was approved, therefore, 17 is legal and Constitutional.
.@MattPMiller @MakelyHome @HoustonChron The District was approved by a Federal Court in San Antonio, therefore, it is Constitutional &amp; legal
.@mhojnacki Yes, Chris rocks!!
.@mhojnacki @MakelyHome Well said!!
.@MakelyHome I must be doing something right as I received more votes in the last election than any other election ever.  !
