Trumps longest speech in his history at CPAC.He sounded like Fidel Castro’s speeches to the masses in Cuba of the 80’s. He rambled on about all those that have criticized him clear back to the size of his crowd on Inaugural Day. He even mocked Jeff Sessions southern voice. Idiot!
@mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Sounded more like Fidel Castro and Saddam Hussein to this old Marine.
@robreiner Obviously Don the Con Trump believes Kim Jong Un and Putin more than he believes our traditional allies, our intelligence agencies and Secretary of State.
@ddale8 Fidel Castro gave speeches like that in Cuba. No wonder all the boat people got asylum on the Florida Coasts.
@ddale8 Trump is a NYC Conman crook  and inherited rich Fake Businessman. Lindsay Graham called it right in early 2016. https://t.co/4DR48oFnUO
Ever notice how those that have never served this country in the military are the ones that think war is the best answer to world problems. Truth is the US has not won a war since we and our allies won in WWII. All others have been treaties and US mostly withdrew.
@seanspicer @washingtonpost If the Covington students were properly supervised and disciplined while waiting on the busses this incident would not have happened. Starting pep rally chants when your religion and religious school is criticized is not the way to handle this unfortunate incident.

@RudyGiuliani Truth isn’t truth. LOL

@RudyGiuliani Obviously Cohen would have accepted a job on the WH staff or an ambassadorship in the Trump Administration. Brownback and Pompeo of Ks did. Free ride and great perks if you stay loyal to Trump and do not have illegal baggage or get caught. Cohen is going to jail and Trump isn’t.
Netanyahu is possibly being indicted for bribes. Israel has a population of 8.6 million. That’s slightly bigger than the population of NYC. To Trump he has greater political influence than our Governors and Senators. Why?
@EricBoehlert @JesseSimonODay N Korea has a population of 25.2 million, S Korea has 51.2 million and China has a population of over a billion. Perhaps S Korea and China should handle the threat of Nuclear disarmament in N Korea not us.

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Some people will say and do anything to protect Trump. Especially if they are associated with National Enquirer and Fox News. Collusion is not a legal term but conspiracy to commit treason is illegal.
@shanemarian @Rosie @GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I’m upset that Don the Con Trump won the Primary over 15 other credible GOP candidates for POTUS.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Yes the meetings in Trump Towers was just a innocent meeting about adoption of children. If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you in Brooklyn very cheap.
Trumps National Emergency is a red herring. In 1980, 125,000 Cubans came ashore in the US under diplomatic immunity asylum. Some may remember those years of border crisis.
@mitchellvii Declare an National emergency based on 40,000 gun deaths in the US in 2018. Close the gun show loopholes, limit magazine capacity, limit ammunition types and enforce Bump Stock laws that Trump has already done.
@BillOReilly Daily Mirror.
Let Trump declare a National Emergency on the  magnificent border fence funding. Then the next POTUS can declare a National Emergency on gun control, magazine type and gun show loopholes.40,000  deaths in the US in a year by guns is a emergency situation.

@EddieDonovan @ALANEFLAME Blumenthal admitted he lied and repented. Trump got out of Vietnam Draft with a trumped up bone spur on a foot. Trump also lied to troops in Iraq about no raises in 10 years and a 10% pay raise he got them. A blatant lie by our Commander in Chief in December with no apology.

@NRCC It is not a wall it is a metal slatted fence that may easily be breached with a ladder or a metal cutting saw or torch. We need to separate the fence cost from the border budget and get a real reading on the 5.7 billion proposed fence. Then negotiate the fence as a separate item.

@LouDobbs @anniebak13 @EdRollins @realDonaldTrump I suppose you are calling Tillerson, Kelly, Mathis and Sessions and 30 something more anti Trump.

@LouDobbs @anniebak13 @EdRollins @realDonaldTrump Separate the Border Security budget from the fing fence budget of 7.5 billion and let the wall be negotiated as a separate. Closing the Government down and declaring it a National Emergency is a joke.

@mitchellvii If Trump would gave us realistic cost figures on the slatted metal fence and gave DACA children a better chance to become citizens the loggerhead situation could easily be solved. He said he was totally responsible for the shutdown over the fence. Remember!
@thehill Now if Trump would have given a 2 billion on the 234 mile fence it would have been a done deal. But no according to Rush Limbaugh that would have made Trump look weak.

@DawsonSField @lisaradio99 Trumps casinos, luxury hotels and real estate deals are where the Oligarch of Russia, China, Saudis Arabia and many countries are money laundering their countries I’ll gotten money. Sheldon Addleson and Donald Trump are involved in theses Casino and luxury hotels worldwide.
@lisaradio99 Have you ever been a investor or sub contractor in any of Don the Cons projects? Like Trump Plaza, Taj Mahal, Trump airline, Trump DJT Stock 95 to 05, T Fake University, T Vodka, T Steaks, T board game or other failed ventures. You really think the CIA or FBI would honeypot him?
@lisaradio99 @DawsonSField How does Trump know that things are worse than they have ever been? He has fired all his reputable  staff and been in the bribery of officials in foreign countries and NJ, Fl and NYC most of his life. Most lenders in the USA will not lend him money so he goes offshore.

@AdamParkhomenko @maggieNYT @JudgeJeanine Obviously Don the Con did not answer the question. He went on one of his tirades instead.
@ZinaNPetersen @simon_schama It will take 10 or more years to place a wall or fence on the Mexican border with all the eminent domain lawsuits and construction obstacles. Don the Con made a campaign issue of the wall. Split out the wall cost and the security costs and negotiate the wall. Open government now.
@realDonaldTrump Hillary had plenty of investigations into her past and you said that anyone that is under FBI investigation is unfit to be POTUS. Remember, two wrongs do not make a right or we reap what we sew.

Poor Trump. He claims was all alone in the WH on Christmas Eve except for the guards in the yards with machine guns. Bone Spur Trump has never spent a night on guard duty in combat or anywhere in his inherited rich life. Boo hoo!
@waltshaub Two of his three wives grew up in Communist countries. Most of his financing and a large amount of his money comes from  Russia according to statements made by his sons. That and collusion with Russians in the 2016 US Elections.Trump does love Russia and he also admires Putin.
@GovMikeHuckabee @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I thought someone said in the Christian Bible that we reap what we sew. Is that really in the Bible Reverend Hucksbee?
@LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump Why not finish and refurbish the fence. Place taser voltage electrical wires on the top and place concertina wire and 50,000 volt taser mines and gravel mine listening devices in a selected strip on the US side. Save us money on a stupid see through slotted wall.
@BillOReilly Also expect more lies and illegal behavior by our POTUS. Don the Con Trump.
@GeraldoRivera @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Don the Con Trump is the showboat and liar in about everything he is or has touched in his adult life. You should know that Geraldo. You are a lawyer.
@realDonaldTrump The flake in my GOP is Don the Con Trump, not Romney.
@Helloutofdodge @realDonaldTrump Fired because he lied on a naturalization form and could not get a security clearance at the WH. Kelly fired him. Kelly is gone and now Trump is promoting his book and probably wants him back to work with Bolton, Pompeo and the other Fox News talking heads he wants in the WH.
@CheriJacobus It seems everyone around Trumps inner circle lies a lot. I bet you are glad that you were not hired for the communication director job.
@55andwhat @brianefallon Trump reminds me of  dictator Saddam Hussein with his sons Uday, Qusay and daughter Ivanka. The only people in the WH he trusts and a guy that gets all his intelligence briefings Fox and Friends and Sean Hannity. Sad.

The problem is all Trump said about Troops pay raises in his bragging in Iraq was a lie. Every year for the last 10 there were pay increases and the current pay raise is close to 2.4% not 10% as stated by Don the Con Trump.
@Rico1Tasty @realDonaldTrump I’m sure Trump did not fire him. General Kelly did when he lied on his naturalization application and couldn’t get a security clearance.

@realDonaldTrump You had a majority in the Congress and Senate and look how fast your magnificent wall was approved and built in two years! You lie.
@realDonaldTrump The wall is the issue Don the Con has left. That and fear mongering language about illegals and crime. Hitler applied the same tactic against Jews in Germany in the 1930’s. Look how great minorities hate was for his country in 1944.
@realDonaldTrump Sebastian Gorka. A Nazi loving Fox News contributor that could not pass a security clearance and was fired from the WH staff for belonging to a Nazi supporter organization. Now Trump is promoting his book. Sad.
Controversial Trump aide Gorka 'fired' | The Times of Israel https://t.co/SntF6KM0Tx
@realDonaldTrump I should have said: Now Trump will be bringing Sebastian Gorka back into his Cabinet. I forgot he was there and fired once.
@Rico1Tasty @realDonaldTrump Now he is pushing his book. Guess my speculation was wrong.
@realDonaldTrFan I assume Hannity will be Sexting you any moment now and seeking your advice on money laundering in high end Real Estate and other things. I would guess you are texting from your lonely office in the chaotic WH that you have created.

@Dimon_dize How much have you lost this year Dimon? Do you remember where the DJ’s were in 2008  when Obama became POTUS and where it was when Trump took over?  I did not hear Obama bragging every time the stock market went up. Trump seems obsessed with bragging and blaming.
@steph93065 @barrymc2010 @realDonaldTrump Have you ever heard Trump say, fine employers that employ illegals? I have not.
@realDonaldTrump Also makes it easier to pass drugs through without scaling the wall.
Trump is hyping the China trade deal today. It is noted the stock market is also down 4.8% for the year at closing Friday.  Should we trust anything this habitual liar says these days? All my military friends are celebrating the 10% raise he bragged about in Iraq a few days ago.
@maydaymindy9 Why because Cohen worked for a criminal scumbag? Then in Mafia slang he ratted on his boss when the law showed up. He will serve 3 years in jail and his crime boss is still POTUS with no charges yet.
@AaronBlake Trump is a inherited rich Con artist who took over his father’s business and nearly ruined it on his Trump Plaza, Taj Mahal, Trump Airline and other ventures in the late 1980’s and 1990’s.  Liberal Bankruptcies laws saved his but numerous times.
@LisaMei62 @pjsullivan442 Where the hell are we going in Syria. Looks like to me that Russia, Assad and Iran are now in total control and celebrating. Kurds that were gassed in the 1980’s are now going to be executed once again.
@realDonaldTrump You let the Russians in and two of your three wives grew up in Communist countries. Putin, Assad and Iran have something big on you don’t they?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends Did Fox and Friends ask you about your lying about the troops not getting a pay raise in 10 years and your bragging about the non existent 10% pay raise you told them about? I suspect not!

@realDonaldTrump In Israel the wall is 440 to 456 miles long and partly surrounds a country of 8.6 citizens. That is about the size of protecting a area about as large as NYC. Their wall and fences have been breached many times and 80 Palestine protesters were killed when we moved our embassy.

@Coppervixen @chuckwoolery The wall in Israel has been breached, climed over,tunneled under and sledge hammered through. It is only 457 miles long and partly protects about 8.6 million people.

@ruthboopies Speeches to Military personnel should not be used as campaign rally’s by POTUS or any politician on any military base. He repeats his campaign speech at every group meeting that is not scripted. He even lied about  the military pay raises in his Iraq meeting with troops.
@SkilesJohnnie You can’t believe anything Don the Con says when he is addressing anyone without a written script. When he addresses crowds of any size or makeup he says anything he wants without facts and lies all the time.
@ruthboopies The commanding officers of these units in Iraq should have informed the POTUS that MEGA hats should not be displayed or signed by  him for Troops in their command. Discipline is paramount in military units and political campaign activity is not permitted on military bases.

@TrumpTracking @dhickman1 @IngrahamAngle Like  Trump now has a beef about the Koch brothers who have a net worth of 60 billion each and employ 60 thousand in the US and about the same number all over the world. Trump Co manages Casinos and Luxury Resorts in 25 countries but does not own them.
@boconnel @Hokibil @IngrahamAngle Google the Dow Jones graphs of daily averages over the last 10 years. Look up the stock market under Presidents for the last 30 years. Trump is batting slightly above Obama at this point in his term and much worse than Clinton for the same period of time. Tump exaggerates bigly.
@Hokibil @IngrahamAngle @boconnel Trump is a Inherited rich NYC   Con artist, showboat and fraudulent businessman.

@LivePDDave1 @TomiLahren Mexico is not the only US entry point for illegals. Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf Coasts are wide open. Rio Grande river and Canadian border is open even with Trumps Magnificent $ 22 billion Wall. Boats, drones, trucks, autos and visa overstay violates US laws bigly.
@Nutmeg1004 @LauraLitvan @TGowdySC Trump is a very vindictive man. If a news media says anything bad about him they are labeled Fake News or worse. He also has a vendetta against the NFL and media dating back to the 90’s. Crazy manipulative inherited rich man. No staff or politicians with balls respect him.
@mflynnJR How was your tour in the service of the US Military Jr?
@realDonaldTrump No nuclear tests because the mountain test site collapsed and killed 200 N Korea scientists and workers.

@NaytDX @charliekirk11 A Christian country’s citizens idly stood by and let the Nazi’s round up people of the Jewish religion ,send them to concentration camps and ultimately see them be killed by the millions.  That is how dictators take over when honest citizens do not rise up and intervene.

@joshtpm Don the Con is a serial liar.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @foxandfriends @FoxNews Your thing? Are you Uday or Cusay for your daddy.
@BillOReilly @realDonaldTrump What did he pull off? Temporally he had a meeting with Kim Jong Un and met his demands in a signed document we know nothing about. Trump is big at bragging and photo ops with a dictator of a country with a population of 25 million people that is bankrupt.
@mitchellvii Blatant BS or what?
@DonaldJTrumpJr Junior you always brag and exaggerate about your marvelous inherited empire financial gains but never acknowledge your monumental losses of investor money.

@peterbakernyt Not ludicrous if it is a legitimate agreement. So far all we know is a meeting was done and something was signed. Great photo op and publicity but as of now it looks like Kim Jong Un got everything he wanted from this meeting.
@realDonaldTrump It was historic because you gave Kim Jong Un everything he wanted and gained nothing in return. His nuclear test program has been being dismantled since June 2017 when the mountain site collapsed and killed 200 of his scientists. His people are starving and his country is broke.

His country is broke, his people are starving and his hydrogen bomb test in June 2017 collapsed the site and killed 200 nuclear scientists. No wonder he is meeting Trump wherever and whenever to get on his feet.
@mflynnJR If you cannot stand the 1st Amendment and free press then you might want to move to a country where the press is controlled by a dictatorship.
@realDonaldTrump Your economics is costing working class people and tremendously helping the rich. Lumber prices are up, steel prices are up. Building homes is more expensive. Bonuses are nice but wages are stagnent. Motorcycles prices are up. Car sales are a wreck. Farm income is down. Sad.
@SteveSparker122 @legend_f22 @RealJack You sir are impersonating a Colonel in the U S Military to further your US Feedom Army. It’s legal but not ethical to some of us that have served longer than you and many of us that have faced actual enemy fire in allegiance and support of this Great Country.
@IngrahamAngle @MSNBC @realDonaldTrump What did he pull off? The nuclear test site collapsed in June 2017 killing a reported 200 of his nuclear scientist. Clean up has been ongoing since that time. The embargo and frozen funds by US, China, S Korea and Russia worked. Kim Jong Un has no choices and we held the ace card
@paulonwilliams @FoxNews @SecPompeo The 2017 nuclear hydrogen bomb test site collapse killed a reported 200 N Korea nuclear workers. China, S Korea, Japan and other Asian countries are concerned about radiation fall out. That plus the embargo by US and others brought Kim Jong Un to his knees on his nuclear program
@legend_f22 @RealJack @SteveSparker122 Sons of Trump. Would they be known as Uday and Qusay in NYC, Queens and Brooklyn?
@realDonaldTrump Don the Con is going to create a big trade war and the average working hourly wage earner that shops on line and at Walmart will be totally screwed. Gasoline prices and consumer increases will wipe out the small tax bonuses and tax cuts  bragged about in a short time. Sad.
@WilDonnelly When Don the Con is impeached he can move to Russia with his Slovenia born communist party leaders daughter and his  3rd wife and become one of the richest Oligarchs in that country.
@Trumptweets2020 You are such a great inherited rich strong man dictatorial leader. I know you would like to do away with the CIA, NSA, FBI, DOJ, State Department, Democratic Party, 1/2,the Republican Party, most of the DOD, all print and TV media except two  Fox programs and the Mueller team.
@seanhannity Singapore is a great Country/City. Lived there in the 1970’s and loved it. Even spent some time in a hospital there. Had a British trained neurosurgeon and the surgery and treatment under public health care was outstanding.

Wages at home will have to go up as consumer goods are going to cost more with the Trade war now coming to our shores!
@USFreedomArmy @SteveSparker122 I hope we have a better system of vetting immigrants than we have in the past and fine employers that hire illegals. Also our POTUS should do a better job of vetting his employees and WH staff also.

@realDonaldTrump Everything in your life has been rigged by anyone  that disagrees or says anything negative about you.
@realDonaldTrump He also believes in economic cooperation and non nuclear weapon proliferation with S Korea, China, Japan and other countries in Asia.  His nuclear bomb test site collapsed in a test in June 2017 killing a reported 200 workers. Don’t forget that on your twitters.

@realDonaldTrump That was after you fired the honest ones beautiful ones. You are play acting reality TV again. Collusion with Russia, money laundering and habitual lying might not be a TV show where you control the script.
@FoxNewsSunday @BillHemmer Saying something under oath is a trap. Trump says that anyone that pleads the 5th is guilty.  If you did nothing wrong why not tell the truth now and under oath. That is hard for Donald Trump to do either way.
@brianklaas What Rudy is saying is Don the Con lies so much that under oath he might do the same thing. Like Trump said, I have had no meetings with Russians and no phone calls to Russians during my campaign.
@TheRickyDavila We know Trump would say these asylum seekers and illegals are Animals and so are their lost children. They are rapists and murders and I assume some are maybe good people. Hitler treated Jews like that.

@BillOReilly @ycosey Trump is good at creating anarchy, division and chaos where ever he goes. Look at all the good he did for Atlantic City and the Taj Mahal. Four bankruptcies, 3000 workers laid off in the Taj Mahal when it closed and 7,000 reported out of work in the industry in that  Great City.

Trump says N Korea is dismantling their nuclear test site before the June meeting in Singapore. He does not say that in June 2017 the test site mountain collapsed killing 200 workers. I’m sure pics of the clean up of that tragic site will be used to shown on our TV dismantling.

@joncoopertweets Maybe he is tired of all the lies, moronic tweets and propaganda coming from Don the Con Trump. We need strong candidates in the GOP not liars.
@realDonaldTrump N Korea’s nuclear test mountain site collapsed in 2017 killing and estimated 200 people. This collapse caused nuclear radiation to possibly endanger China, S Korea and other SE Asian and Asian countries in the area. Rocket Man caved to them so don’t celebrate too soon.
@mflynnJR Who are you to call the Pope an idiot and what have you done in your life except live off your daddy’s fame and patriotism before he entered politics?
Geologists say North Korea's nuclear test site has collapsed https://t.co/S9xVkmN0ej #FoxNews
@CoreyLMJones @llgchris The Magnificent 22 billion dollar wall is a joke. Finish the fence, electrify it and mine a area a short distance on the US side. Then fine employers and fix the E verify type systems.
@Acosta @PrincessBravato The voters should be holding the 3 branches of government accountable. If POTUS is a con artis, liar and fraud a free press should be telling us so.
@MorganStanley China has increased its research, productivity and infrastructure development more in the last 60+ years than any country in the world.  Amazing.
@foxandfriends @BPUnion Finish the present fence and electrify it and mine the US side. Save us a lot of money for Trumps Magnificent 22 billion dollar wall. The wall will not stop boats, planes, drones, tunnels and visa overstay.
@polishprincessh @GrizzleMeister A 22 Billion dollar wall will not stop this type of entry. Finish and electrify the present fence and save us a lot of waisted money. Boats,planes, drones, tunnel entry and visa overstay  will not stop at a Trump Magnificent wall.
@ColoradoGirl2A @GrizzleMeister Sticks and stones may break bones but words will never hurt Sarah. She has tough skin and lies all the time for her Fake News boss.
@DonaldJTrumpJr Who cares?
@MSNBC @Morning_Joe About as far as her boss would go describing Megan Kelly in the primary debates. If you work for a Con artist who lies and calls people degrading names you draw fire and fury as his spokesperson. Tough.
@BillKristol Repeat a lie over and over enough and the uninformed will believe its fact.
@realDonaldTrump @JacobAWohl The filthy comedian talks like you. You call it locker room talk  and campaign rally language.  Both of you have created a norm for language of youth in this country. Sad.
@Education4Libs @pratherja Trump said his net worth was 10 billion in the primaries. We know Don the Con never lies or exaggerates.
@TheHRH @realDonaldTrump She has a foul mouth just like Don the Con Trump. Too bad he did not  show. Donald and Wolf could have gotten into  real pissing contest with the Correspondents present to witness it.
@Rightwingmadman @realDonaldTrump Like his character, honesty, fidelity and family values do not matter.
@USAHotLips @GrizzleMeister @NationalGuard @realDonaldTrump Go to Home Depot and order a 40’ extension ladder with delivery in Mexico for less than $500. Makes it easier to breach magnificent Trump walls. Electrify the fence and save us a lot of money.
@foxandfriends @CharlesHurt Tester did just what Don the Con would. Call people moronic names on Twitter, media outlets  and on Fox and Friends without Investigation for facts. Dumping garbage is common in Trumpland.
@foxandfriends @CharlesHurt 12 years as the WH Physician is pretty cushy duty assignment with little administrative responsibility. Not hardly up to the standards this vet approves of to run and improve the massive VA.
@IngrahamAngle @SarahHuckabee @IvankaTrump If you throw tizzy tweets, call people childish names and insult honest people like Don the Con Trump does every day. Some folks take heat for defending his moronic actions by comedians and most media outlets except Fox.
@jaketapper Alax is portraying Trump as he acts and talks in real life. Sad
@JudgeJeanine Driving your 2017 Cadillac 119 MPH in a 65 mph zone. That is evidence of disregard for others lives and very stupid. Guilty Judge Jeanine.
@pratherja @bam4kansas Agreed it ranked in 2015. However exports of grain has been left in limbo by Trumps ever changing statements on withdrawing from TPP and NAFTA. IE trade wars.
@realDonaldTrump What new business are pouring into Michigan. Give us facts please.
@realDonaldTrump The sick calling others sick. Moronic tweet.
@jjs1306 @tedlieu @SpeakerRyan Falwell Jr or Graham Jr are waiting in the wings.
@mariefisher562 @tedlieu @SpeakerRyan No more praying by VP Pence.
@jay_mulligan @tedlieu @Reve_Rogers @SpeakerRyan Once you have stated you are not going to run again you do what you think is right and richest. To hell with anyone else’s religion if it differs from yours.
@IngrahamAngle The Nazi Party and the KKK should be labeled terrorist organizations in this Great Country.
@GregShugar If he worked for Fox News he would be required by a NDA to never say anything negative about Don the Con Trump.
@seanhannity @SaraCarterDC That is nice but the Mueller Congressional investigation is not going away. Time will tell!
@IngrahamAngle @nytimes Most from Cuba and Haiti  came in by boat over the years. Should we build a Magnificent $22 billion wall around the Atlantic, Pacific and Gulf Coasts?

@AriFleischer Insider in the WH for 12 years of a Navy career sounds like a great guy  with a great Military duty assignment but hardly the administrative background to run and improve the VA.
@DonaldJTrumpJr He did not meet with Putin representatives in Trump Towers for dirt in Clinton did he?
@Kris_Sacrebleu The Mafia fixers always dress well.
@foxandfriends One sided Fox and Friends is dictating what SNL show should do. Who are they to dictate diversity of opinions to anyone.
@realDonaldTrump We are waiting for the Congressional authorized and DOJ  Investigation to be completed by the Mueller Team. Time will tell.
Coward refuses to show his face. The Nazi Party and the KKK should be labeled terrorist organizations in the USA. https://t.co/NRnPzSqKzy

@TonyBartolo4 @Education4Libs China, Russia, S Korea and other SE Asian and Asian countries formed a consortium of countries against N Korea to cease their nuclear program after they developed rockets that were capable of reaching as far as the USA. These countries already have nuclear weapons or access.
@gymbeaux143 @GrizzleMeister Under our system death squads operate every day. They are made by the insurance industry that determine the amount spent on patient care and hospital panels.
@KamalaHarris This will help landlords like the Trump family’s low income subsidies housing projects in Brooklyn and Queens. Rents will go up and so will subsidize payments for rent to landlords. That is how Fred Trump made most of his vast wealth.
