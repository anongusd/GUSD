@billmaher Regardless of whatever the Mueller investigation finds, it is clear that he should not be President of the United States.  He's committed most of the crimes considered "high crimes and misdemeanors" at the time the Constitution was drawn.
@RonWyden Name one trade deal that didn't put the interests of economic elites over the working class.  This will be no different.
@libtardsrasses @RepBarbaraLee If you’re afraid of population control, then you should be concerned about the fact that poor and middle class Americans skip medical care because of costs more than do people in any other OECD country.
@jaketapper @CNNPolitics "Further action" is code for "figuring out how to give US corporations control of their oil supply."
@RepBarbaraLee I guess when Democrats take back the Presidency they won't mind if we declare an emergency to pass #MedicareForAll, right?  Because apparently declaring an emergency for the sake of political expediency is okay now.
Republican legislators make up all sorts of false claims about Democratic election fraud and corruption.  But when one of their own gets caught, all I hear are crickets.		https://t.co/hT5fMBCIwg

@SenFeinstein So, when will Jeffrey Epstein or Alex Acosta be held accountable?  Jeffrey Epstein is currently living it up in the Virgin Islands despite having run a pedophile ring for elites, and Acosta has been promoted to US Secretary of Labor.
@new__millennial @AOC Settle down.  It's been less than two months and one legislator can't pass a bill on their own--especially when the Senate is controlled by the other party.
@AOC I grew up in Vermont, which may be subtropical by the time I'm looking to retire.		The coasts and the southern US will be screwed though.
@AdamSchiff That's one of the key views on executive power according to Federalist Society members.  And it's been the sort of thing they've argued for since the Reagan administration.  In the view of some of their members, the President should even be able to ignore Supreme Court rulings.
@KamalaHarris If it isn't released publicly, just get your hands on it and read it from the Senate floor.
@SenJeffMerkley If it's not released by the Trump administration, please get your hands on it and read it from the Senate floor.
@WildcatEd1979 @GovMattBevin That was a rhetorical question.

@thehill If it's not made fully public by the Trump administration, two things need to happen:		1) @AdamSchiff has Mueller testify publicly in Congress	2) A senator reads a full copy of the report on the Senate floor, where they have immunity
@GovMattBevin Pretty much every trade deal we've ever had supports the interests of economic elites at the expense of the middle class.  Tell me, how is this one different?

@SenSchumer Weren't buybacks illegal until Reagan?  Why not get rid of them altogether?
@GothamGirlBlue @airoderinde @NateSilver538 An insurgent candidate needs exposure, which was intentionally limited via the debate rules changes.  If you don’t see a problem with what happened then I guess you don’t care about fair elections.  I do, so I guess we just won’t see eye to eye.
@GothamGirlBlue @airoderinde @NateSilver538 Wrong again.  Obama was able to build momentum against Clinton, who was the front-runner, because there were 17 debates/forums before anyone cast a vote.  In the 2016 primary, there were only 4.		That decision was made to insulate Clinton from another insurgent candidate.
@realDonaldTrump I wish there were some Republicans out there who were strong when it comes to the economy and the working class.
@airoderinde @GothamGirlBlue @NateSilver538 You realize that the process leading up to an election influences it's results, right?  The DNC clearly insulated Clinton with their rules changes on debates and outside forums, limiting Sanders' public exposure.  These choices have electoral consequences.
@GothamGirlBlue @airoderinde @NateSilver538 Not true.  In 2008 candidates were allowed to participate in unofficial forums.  DWS changed the rules so that you couldn't do that.  Her initial plan was to have only 6 debates when in 2008 there were 26.  Also the DNC violated their own charter by having a biased primary.
@airoderinde @GothamGirlBlue @NateSilver538 Love how people act like the DNC didn't have a finger on the scale during the primary, even though Clinton's former 2008 campaign co-chair was the chair of the DNC and changed the rules for the primary to benefit her campaign.
@JeffMerkley Pretty much every nominee Trump's put forward for any important position is exactly the kind of person who should not be in that position.
@GothamGirlBlue @NateSilver538 People can be mad about whatever they want.  But anyone who voted for McCain after voting for Clinton but is now mad at Sanders supporters is acting hypocritically.
@GothamGirlBlue @NateSilver538 This is a complete re-writing of history.  He didn't design her campaign strategy and if you have any evidence he told her not to campaign in swing states I'd love to see it.
@GothamGirlBlue @NateSilver538 When a race is that close, you can point to any one factor and say it was key to the loss.  The Comey letter,  her decision not to actively campaign in crucial swing states, Russian social media operations, etc.  Those who primarily blame Sanders supporters are myopic.
@NRafter @NateSilver538 The point is that you can't draw useful conclusions from data when your core construct is broken and your analysis is flawed.
@GothamGirlBlue @NateSilver538 That speaks to Clinton as a candidate relative to Obama, not Sanders voters' dispositions.
@NRafter @NateSilver538 His "point" is undermined by a variety of flaws in his empirical analysis.  One obvious problem is how he defines his core construct.  For instance, voters could strategically vote third party in safe states, and they'd be classified as "Never Hillary" voters.
@NateSilver538 It still amazes me that people talk about Bernie supporters this way.  It's deeply ironic, since the percentage of Clinton's 2008 primary supporters who voted for McCain in the general election was MUCH higher than the percentage of Sanders' supporters who voted for Trump.
@BernieSanders You can tell how much @BernieSanders scares economic elites.  "Liberal" organizations like CNN have already begun trying to undermine his campaign, no doubt because his policies benefit the middle class instead of their executives, board members, and largest shareholders.
This is even better than the Crossfire segment where Carlson gets roasted by Jon Stewart. https://t.co/YBWOIYXNoD

@CNN @niaCNN Major so-called "left wing" outlets had it out for Bernie in 2016, and it's no surprise they're at it again.  Why?		It could be related to the fact that his policies benefit the middle class rather than their largest shareholders, executives, and board members.

@ewarren @Interior @RyanZinke Trump's idea of draining the swamp is cutting out the middleman and just putting the swamp monsters in control of DC.
@SenateGOP Good joke.  The reality that we all know is that your primary interest is in increasing the wealth of the super-wealthy.  Why do you even pretend otherwise when it's so obvious?
@TypsyGypsyDance @SenSanders The ACA is a law that passed through Congress.  It was not an executive order.  What are you talking about?		As an aside though, if you don't like executive orders, then you must be mad at Trump.  He's issued 95 in 2 years and 1 month, while Obama issued 276 over 8 years.
@KYGOP The fact that you call the Democratic Party the party of corruption is hilarious.  Obviously there are bad Democrats.  But almost every single nominee Trump has put forward for an important position had major conflicts of interest.
@SenSanders If Obama had declared a national emergency over healthcare or global warming and then immediately admitted that it was a political ploy, the same people who support Trump now would have been shrieking about the US becoming a dictatorship.
@TheAtlantic @NoahCRothman @senatemajldr McConnell is about to get egg on his face.  And deservedly so.  He has ignored the Senate's role in checking the power of the President, and instead deferred to him out of fear of losing re-election.
@thehill Godspeed, ACLU.
@FiveThirtyEight I'd never vote for him in a general election, but I'm glad to see he's running against Trump.
@maddow He's already openly admitted that it was a political ploy.		If Obama had declared a national emergency in order to push through, say, a healthcare bill, the same people who support Trump now would have been shrieking about the US being a dictatorship.
@MSNBC @Tom_Winter So, what's going to happen when he starts blabbing again?
@JillFilipovic Kissinger's got to be one the most insidious US political figures of the last 50 years.
@RepCummings This whole wall thing is just pandering to his base.  He doesn't prioritize issues based on how serious they are, but by how his supporters will respond.
@KySportsRadio As well he should.
@RashidaTlaib I wonder if McConnell will be a little less cowardly about opposing Trump now that Trump has admitted the national emergency declaration was a political ploy.		Just kidding, McConnell doesn't care about anything other than re-election.  He'll support Trump as Trump's base does.
@HeerJeet A broken clock is right twice a day.
@MotherJones So he's not even trying to pretend that declaring a national emergency was anything more than a political maneuver.
@thehill @TheHillOpinion @SenatorCollins should lose her Senate seat over her vote on Kavanaugh alone.
@RoKhanna Good thing Democrat’s have the House.  But McConnell has no spine so it will probably fail in the Senate.
@GOPLeader True or false: if Obama has declared a national emergency for political gain, you’d be shrieking about him being a dictator.		You’re a hypocrite.
@RepCummings If Obama has declared a national emergency for political gain, Republicans in Congress would be furiously shrieking about dictatorships.  The only Republican I’ve seen speak out against this fake emergency is Senator Collins, and we all know how meaningless her words are.
@jaketapper @mkraju @TheLeadCNN Mitch McConnell is supporting Trump because he’s afraid of losing re-election.  Disgusting.
@SenatorCollins Nothing you can say will make up for your vote for Kavanaugh.  You’ve damaged the Supreme Court for decades to come.
@SteveKerr One of my favorite things about the NBA is the fact that players are allowed to advocate the issues they care about without fear of repercussions.		As long as the issue isn't the refs, that is.

@SenKamalaHarris You should probably also call on the GOP to remove McConnell as Senate majority leader.
@TulsiGabbard One of the major roles of Congress is to act as a check on Presidential power.  Mitch McConnell has abdicated that responsibility because he's afraid of losing re-election.  Which is further proof that he needs to go.
@JohnCornyn @senatemajldr 4) Andrew Wheeler (EPA Administrator)		How about let's NOT have a lobbyist as administrator of the EPA.
@RepKatieHill @realDonaldTrump And Mitch McConnell is going along with it because he's afraid of opposing Trump and losing his re-election bid in 2020.		I think I'm going to have to run against that spineless, partisan hack myself.
@Mr_RyanGuillory Definitely the latter.
@heraldleader McConnell is a coward.  One of the most important roles of the Senate is to act as a check on the President.  He's abdicated that responsibility because he's afraid of angering Trump and his base and losing re-election.
@KamalaHarris Mitch McConnell’s unwillingness to stand up to Trump is disgusting.  He needs to be voted out of office.
@CoryBooker McConnell is a hack.  He should be speaking out against this, but he's too afraid of opposing Trump and losing re-election to do the right thing.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump McConnell is spineless.  He cares more about re-election than doing what's right.
@courierjournal @senatemajldr McConnell also said he'll support Trump on this.		What a spineless coward.
@SenSherrodBrown I am &gt;this&lt; close to deciding to run for McConnell's seat in 2020.
@chrislhayes Removing @senatemajldr McConnell from his position as Senate Majority Leader is another.
@chrislhayes He's easily my least favorite senator.
@NBCNews Hey @senatemajldr McConnell, are you going to ever stand up to Trump on any of his stupid ideas, or are you too much of a coward to do what's right?
@ewarren 44% of Americans say that they skip medical treatment due to costs.  That's a higher rate than in any other OECD country.  The notion that we can't provide affordable healthcare as a right for every American is just absurd.
@AnthonyHopeNYC Oh wow, thanks Anthony.  I never would have asked for that but I really appreciate the boost.

@MotherJones @AOC Wait, wealthy political elites are exploiting the poor?  I'm shocked.
@CNN @CillizzaCNN Republican elites always complain about the debt while Democrats are in charge, but then slash taxes on the rich (the deficit be damned) as soon as they get in power.  Makes me wonder how sincere they are.
@brianschatz Trump just put an oil guy in charge of policy concerning our natural resources.  So much for draining the swamp.
@senatemajldr If you actually want to reach an agreement, maybe consider voting on the bill Democrats and the GOP (yourself included) already supported before Trump threw a tantrum.  Your job is to pass bills, not follow Trump.  Do your damn job.
@SenSanders Not just corporations, but the people who run those corporations.		It's a travesty that capital gains taxes are taxed at lower rates than income.  Middle class workers pay higher effective tax rates than those who make their income off investments.
@KamalaHarris The fact that Senate and House Republicans tout the tax bill as their greatest accomplishment of the last term tells you what they really care about: making the ultra-wealthy even better off.
@TheDemocrats No surprises there.  @SenatorCollins needs to be voted out of office.
@MichaelAvenatti That's going to make Thanksgiving awkward.
@SenSanders Pretty much every argument he makes is hypocritical.
@SenMarkey @SenJeffMerkley @SenSanders @gillibrandny @SenKamalaHarris @SenWarren @maziehirono @RonWyden @SenBlumenthal @SenBooker @SenAmyKlobuchar @SenMurphyOffice That's a start but it's not nearly enough.
@thehill For that to happen, at least 1/3 of Senate Republicans would have to grow a spine.  Does anyone see @senatemajldr McConnell going against Trump when he too is compromised by Russian money?
@Wilson1Theresa @cenkuygur I should have been more clear.  I was referring to party leadership.  You’re right, there are many Democratic voters (myself included) who didn’t want Clinton to win the nomination.
@bill3133 @ewarren I think under either the middle class would be better off, assuming any of their policies pass Congress.  Medicare-For-All would reduce how much most people pay for healthcare when you consider the cost of premiums, drugs, and other out of pocket costs.
@bill3133 @ewarren I was watching a movie.  Hold your horses.		I like Bernie because 1) among the candidates his economic views are probably the closest to mine and 2) I don’t have to worry whether he’s genuine since he’s been saying the same thing for 40 years.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders Many Americans fly to SK for LASIK because it’s cheaper there.  Is your diabetes stat based on the overall population?  That would be misleading because we also have the highest diabetes rate.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders Those countries also provide far wider access to healthcare.  I’ve been studying healthcare for over a year and it’s crystal clear that our system is broken.  Poor people in OECD countries have better access to affordable healthcare than do middle class Americans.
@realDonaldTrump Hey Donnie, why'd you put an oil lobbyist at a key position in the Department of the Interior, which deals with our policies re: natural resources?		So much for draining the swamp.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders Every universal healthcare system in the world costs less than ours, whether you're talking about total costs or as a percentage of GDP.  We pay 17% of our GDP on healthcare.  No other major country in the world pays more than 13% of theirs.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders So, you're conflating doctors with drugmakers and the UK with Germany.  Got it.		Just about every other major country besides the US negotiates prices with drugmakers.  Could be that Germany sets their prices too low, or that the US encourages this behavior with our high prices.
@ewarren While I'm with Bernie, if you win the nomination I'll be happy to support you in the general election.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders There's nothing in the Politico article about UK doctors' protests.
@luka7doncic People got really worked up over nothing.  The rules of the game are different, and in the NBA the rules encourage higher scoring.  Luka wasn't comparing the talent between leagues at all.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders So you're moving away from the argument about doctors' wages and worrying about pharma profits now I guess.  I'll work with that.  They leave countries like Germany because they know we, unlike most other countries, don't let the gov't negotiate prices.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders That's literally the article I was thinking of when I mentioned Estonia.  Doctors won't leave the US for other countries if wages are kept at the levels in other countries.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders No, the countries where doctors are leaving are poorer EU countries like Estonia.  That's not an issue that wealthier countries really have to worry about, for better or for worse.  And it turns out we're a wealthy country.  Doctors aren't going to leave the US over wages.
@photoartist9 @SeekToEngage @BernieSanders Netherlands, Canada, the UK, Switzerland, and Denmark all pay general practitioners over $100K, without the downside we have in the US of making doctors take out hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans.		https://t.co/vWmeKIxksy
@photoartist9 @BernieSanders Ah, so the US is the one developed country in the world that can't figure out how to have an affordable healthcare system while paying doctors reasonable wages.  How foolish of me for thinking otherwise.
@BernieSanders Yes, but won't someone think of the poor pharmaceutical and insurance companies that would no longer be able to exploit the desperate for profit?
@AOC Our justice system is pay-to-play.
@AmyMcGrathKY From day one that bill was designed to primarily benefit the wealthy.  It should surprise no one that it did.		Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress tout it as one of their biggest successes of the last term--basically admitting that making the wealthy richer is a priority.
@AOC @ZephyrTeachout Even when the rich are found guilty they usually get away with a slap on the wrist.  See also: #JeffreyEpstein.  Despite running a child sex ring, he was let off the hook by Alex Acosta, who is now the Trump Secretary of Labor.
@AOC MJ should be legalized, full stop.
@KySportsRadio Lavar would be perfect for the WWE.
@cenkuygur @SenSanders If you look at DW nominate scores--which are used to evaluate the ideologies of legislators in the House and Senate--it's clear that Bernie represents the left wing of the Democratic Party.  Those who try to act like he's a party infiltrator are scared of progressive ideas.
@jeremyscahill Sanctions often don't do much to affect the political and economic elites in the countries they target. The people hit hardest by economic sanctions are often the poor, who have no influence over the policies for which their countries are being punished.
@cenkuygur Establishment Democrats still haven't gotten over the fact that he dared to  run against Clinton when they'd already decided she should be the Democratic nominee.
@TimTraber @KingJames "Look it up for yourself" is what people say when they realize they don't have any valid sources.  The police report is public record, yes.  There's no public record that supports your claim that his claims were fabricated.  We're done here.
@TimTraber @KingJames Your "evidence" is an opinion piece with no evidence?  Alright, believe what you want to believe.
@TimTraber @KingJames I haven't heard anything about a false police report, so you're going to need a valid source on that.  Breitbart won't cut it.		Way to use an ad hominem attack on LBJ rather than discussing the issue at hand while ironically agreeing that DA's sometimes don't do their jobs right.
@TimTraber @KingJames Do you want to have a conversation about the justice system or would you rather just set up strawmen arguments because those are the ones you can handle?
@KingJames He'll probably never even be convicted because there's a perverse incentive for DAs to play ball with the local police force, since the police help them build most of their cases.		There should be a separate prosecutor for cases like these to avoid conflicts of interst.
@BernieSanders It's time for #MedicareForAll
44% of Americans skip medical care because of costs.  No other OECD country does a worse job of providing affordable healthcare for its citizens. https://t.co/D92E7BDINm
@KamelaHarrisPAC @SenSanders That’s how it worked right up until the 80s.  That you think that wanting to return to how things were before is a sign of left wing indoctrination is pretty ironic.
@thehill Of course they have.  Everybody knows that he can be manipulated through flattery.
@SenSanders Buybacks should be made illegal again.
@thehill I think most Americans do.  Presidents should always have to make those available.
@Redbonegirl175 @SenatorCollins @SenatorLeahy You realize that the two-party system makes it so that if he ran as an independent, he'd have guaranteed a Trump victory, right?
@Redbonegirl175 @SenatorCollins @SenatorLeahy The fact that Trump refused to release the records tells you all you need to know.  If you can't see that the intention was to shield Kavanaugh, then you're walking around with your eyes closed.
@AdamSchiff Best of luck.  Time to show them what it looks like when you actually #DrainTheSwamp
@VICE Hey, can we NOT pretend Justin Bieber is newsworthy?
@SenWarren @CFPB So much for #DrainTheSwamp
@Redbonegirl175 @SenatorCollins @SenatorLeahy The Trump administration blocked the publication of the documents that would be necessary to find out the truth.  If Leahy was lying, there would be every reason to make the documents available.  The fact that Trump blocked it is pretty damning for Kavanaugh's claim.
@ewarren @AOC @EdMarkey I'm glad to hear this.  In the primary, I'll only vote for a candidate who supports the #GreenNewDeal, #MedicareForAll, and campaign finance reform.
@ChuckGrassley Your party basically stalled every nomination Obama put forward as much as possible, and now you're pushing through as many nominations as possible despite knowing that you have the Presidency because of foreign influence.  You will be remembered for putting party over country.
@Redbonegirl175 @SenatorCollins @SenatorLeahy In front of the SJC, Kavanaugh said he had not knowingly received information that was stolen from Democrats in the SJC while he was working in the Bush administration.  We could know the truth, except for all the documents that were kept private during the confirmation process.
@Redbonegirl175 @SenatorCollins I have no doubt about his academic qualifications.  Those aren't in dispute.		He began his opening comments with a partisan attack and before that he lied directly to Senator @SenatorLeahy in front of the Judiciary Committee.  That reveals character unfit for the office he holds.
@Redbonegirl175 @SenatorCollins Of course he wasn't.  The investigation was hamstrung from the outset.		Even assuming he didn't do what he was accused of doing, the way he handled himself at his hearings alone revealed that he does not have the demeanor needed to be a Supreme Court justice.
@SenatorCollins I wish you cared as much about the Republic as you do about lobster.  If you did, Kavanaugh wouldn't be on the Supreme Court right now.
@MotherJones The vast majority of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1% and their reduced tax rates were made permanent, while the middle class tax cut is set to phase out.  There's no surprise that big donors are rewarding Congress for their loyalty.

@MusicForLife61 @thehill Yeah, I can see now that I phrased that poorly.  CNN's economic interests are aligned with encouraging him to enter the race to reduce the chance of a Democratic victory.  Think I'll delete my comments here to not confuse anyone.
@MusicForLife61 @thehill Right.  Which is what my 2) was getting at.  He might play the spoiler that prevents a progressive Democrat from winning.
@KevinOConnorNBA @AdamHimmelsbach Pels are gonna get played by Ainge.
@thehill Of course they will.  		1) People are pissed off so they know they'll get an audience.	2) Their shareholders would rather risk a second term of Trump than see a progressive President in 2020 who might increase corporate tax rates or capital gains taxes.

@crisgdl @Inked_Buddhist @SenSanders I agree that he should have vetoed both bills.  Just recognize that both were introduced by Republicans, and had near-unanimous support among Republicans in both chambers.  The only one that came close to failing was the the GLBA b/c all but one Senate Democrat voted against it.
@crisgdl @Inked_Buddhist @SenSanders You realize that bill was introduced by a Republican, and only one Republican in either the House or Senate voted against it (along with too few Democrats as well), right?  I agree with you that it was a garbage bill though.
@RepDeanPhillips @POTUS So if you support “draining the swamp,” you must be livid about Trump appointing an oil lobbyist to the department that deals with natural resources policy, right?
@ezraklein He’s not doing it any favors.
@SenSanders In fact, the middle class has been eroding for over 40 years while the rich keep on getting richer.  And Republican economic policies are intentionally designed to increase the gap between the rich and the poor.

@SenMarkey The fact that building our renewable energy infrastructure isn’t a priority for both parties is a travesty.
@Roberth71778598 @KamalaHarris Let me get this straight.  Even though the tax cut bill was introduced, sponsored, and passed entirely by Republicans (without a single Democrat in either chamber), it is the Democrats’ fault that it passed?  That’s some impressive mental gymnastics.
@SenJeffMerkley Who knew the economy could be so complicated?
@washingtonpost This just in: water is still wet, and the sky is still blue.
@KamalaHarris And of course the middle class tax breaks are phased out over time, while the tax breaks for the wealthy are permanent.
@SenateGOP @POTUS What economic "miracle" are you referring to?  The middle class has been in decline since Reagan and it's continuing to get worse.  And your biggest legislative "success" in the last two years was a transfer of wealth to the wealthiest Americans.
@SenateGOP @POTUS Republicans politicians talk about the economy in terms of overall GDP and job numbers rather than things like household income--which is what really matters for everyday Americans--because they know for a fact that their policies hurt the middle class.
@KamalaHarris Medicare for All is the healthcare policy whose time has come.
@SenJeffMerkley You'll notice that Republican politicians talk about economic prosperity in terms of GDP and the stock market.  The well-being of average households is not among their concerns.
In @realDonaldTrump's worldview, apparently what matters is how wealthy elites are doing--not average Americans. https://t.co/3XHfwj5hZk
@SenJeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump He'll probably have to take some executive time to get over it.
@nprpolitics Try not to run out of ink.
@washingtonpost Oh my.  Good luck with that.
The fact that @senatemajldr called making Election Day a national holiday a Democratic "power grab" is revealing: he's essentially admitted that Republicans benefit from low voter turnout, and that he wants to keep turnout low for that reason. https://t.co/cRGvbUKkAv
@HouseGOP @RepRussFulcher Pretty amazing that y'all consider transferring more wealth to the wealthy via permanent tax cuts (while making middle class tax cuts only temporary) a success.  What would failure look like?
@washingtonpost Wizards can't get any luck.
@TheDemocrats Too bad he doesn't seem to care much about legitimacy.
Every other developed country in the world treats healthcare as a human right and, for that reason, they've taken measures to reduce healthcare costs and make living affordable.  We should do the same.		#MedicareForAll https://t.co/VRcuEoCYYR
@THeinrich22 @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump It’s funny that you use the term “snowflaked” to describes liberals given that Trump—who is even in your username—can’t take criticism without crying like a baby.  He still isn’t over one writer calling calling his hands small 30 years ago.
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump I hope that means you oppose the dramatic increases in the Air Force budget for Hellfire missiles during the Trump administration, especially given your 2013 filibuster over Obama’s use of drones.
@EFunship @RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Are we going to just pretend the Air Force’s budget for Hellfire missiles didn’t increase by 63% in 2017 and another 20% in 2018?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump Bold and brave?  Cadet Bone spurs?
@RepCummings I wonder if any Republicans are going to demand the resignation of @senatemajldr McConnell over his photo with the confederate flag.		Just kidding.  They’ll join in the chorus for Northam’s resignation but say McConnell’s situation is somehow fundamentally different.
@NBCNews So much for draining the swamp.  Not that any of his previous nominations did anything but make the swamp worse.
@SenKamalaHarris How the hell can this possibly be thought of as “draining the swamp”?  Oil lobbyists should have no part in determining our policies concerning natural resources.
As it should be. https://t.co/boLJACego5
@thehill Let’s not forget the billions of dollars of free coverage the media gave him in 2015 that allowed him to be a contender in the first place.
@senatemajldr The only growth you care about is the wealth of your biggest donors.  Why else was your primary economic goal in the last term to push through permanent tax breaks for the wealthy (and phased out breaks for the middle class) despite decades of increasing economic inequality.
@NYDailyNews Oh great.  What could go wrong having a oil lobbyist in charge of policy concerning natural resources?
@NateSilver538 Isn't he still at &gt;85% among Republicans?  I haven't looked recently.
@thehill Nope, sorry Chris.  We're not interested.
@CNNPolitics The "Democrats" who are worried about it are the donor class.  Most Americans recognize that we pay far more for healthcare than any other country, and that out outcomes are poor when compared to comparable countries.
@SenSchumer When will the myth of trickle down economics finally die?  It's been completely debunked, and yet it's still treated as economic canon.
@thehill Because pharma companies don't care about public health.  They care about profit.
@NateSilver538 Has anyone heard a single Republican legislator call on @senatemajldr McConnell to resign because of his photo with the confederate flag?  Didn't think so.
@adammanross @BernieSanders I hope he does.  I’ll gladly volunteer again.
@SenSchumer @SenSanders @nytimes For decades, buybacks were illegal.  Now, over 90% of corporate profits go to buybacks and dividends rather than worker training, R&amp;D, higher wages, or new jobs.		Why do we allow corporations to funnel profits back to their CEOs, board members, and other large shareholders?
@AOC Inmates are systematically treated as subhuman, both while incarcerated and thereafter.  The fact that we have a larger prison population than China--a country with 4x our population--is a national disgrace.
@USATODAY How about just "you shouldn’t be discriminated against on the basis of sex."  The first part of that sentence shouldn't be necessary.
@chrislhayes The what now?
@thehill That's a euphemism if I've ever heard one.
@thehill When Trump says "a lot of people do x" but doesn't name any names, you can be sure that nobody did.
@SenSanders If we taxed any net wealth above $20 million at a 3% rate, we could fund elections with $100 for every voter to donate to the politicians of their choice, with billions left over to fund projects at the state level.
@thehill What she's done is wonderful, but it shouldn't have been necessary.  Because it would reduce the costs of homelessness to the government, proving the homeless with subsidized housing would be both the moral and the economically sound thing to do.
@JuddApatow If he were on Adderall, he'd be able to focus for more than five minutes at a time.
@CNNPolitics It’s obvious that they understand that they benefit from low voter turnout and that higher voter turnout increases Democrats’ chances.
@politico It won’t pass the Senate but I’d enjoy watching @senatemajldr McConnell squirm as he tries to justify rejecting a bill that everybody knows should be passed.
@jaketapper @ryanobles @TheLeadCNN Maybe pundits in the media should consider NOT covering him constantly.  All the unwarranted attention he’s getting is eerily reminiscent of how Trump was covered in 2015 and 2016.
@amyklobuchar There are lots of nefarious business interests out there, but worst among them may be the pharma industry.  They are responsible, first and foremost, for the opioid epidemic that claims over 40K victims in America every year.  They have no qualms with putting profits over people.
@RoseAnnDeMoro @aca Medicare for All is an idea whose time has come.  Every other major wealthy county in the world has figured out how to provide affordable healthcare for all their citizens.  There is no good reason why we shouldn’t be able to do the same.
@washingtonpost The media can’t seem to stop talking about this guy.  This is Trump all over again.
@BigLou05858492 @HuffPost How is his race or sex even remotely relevant to what I said?
@HuffPost Stop giving this out-of-touch billionaire coverage.  We've heard more than enough about him already.
@tedlieu He is also completely out of touch with the experiences of most Americans.		But he does know how to sell overpriced coffee.  I'll give him that.
@thehill Kinda ironic, since one of Trump's professors said he was the worst student he ever had.
@Slate Howard Schultz: "Please clap"
@washingtonpost His book should have been called, "The art of bluffing until the river and then folding."
@thehill @senatemajldr McConnell is terrified of making it easier for Americans to vote because he knows that low voter turnout benefits Republicans.  He'd rather make voting harder, not easier.
@CNBC Ah yes, what we need is another out-of-touch billionaire as a president.  What could go wrong?
@dubbleOkevin @thehill That "clarifying" frame the poll uses is misleading because it doesn't point out to the respondent that their total costs would go down once you subtract premiums.
@dubbleOkevin @thehill Polls from the last year have Medicare for All at about 70% support nationally, including 52% among Republicans.  It's a policy whose time is here.		https://t.co/h3u4VYvhXx
@thehill No need to fret.  Democrats who want a serious chance in the 2020 presidential primary will need to embrace Medicare for All, and once that happens it will be the standard policy position for Democrats going forward.
@KamalaHarris @KamalaHarris Please introduce legislation to hold pharmaceutical companies and their executives accountable for their role in this crisis.  They published lies about the risks of their drugs and bribed doctors to overprescribe, leading to hundreds of thousands of overdoses.
@Laura_A_Diaz @orangecone21 @NBCNews @senatemajldr Ah okay, sorry.  I those comments were for me.
@Laura_A_Diaz @KeiraJaneReed1 @NBCNews @senatemajldr I agree with all of that.  It should be a day off regardless of what your job is.  Only essential infrastructure should be kept open, and those workers should be paid extra for giving up part of the holiday.
@Lawrence Dear @HowardSchultz, 		Please stick with the coffee.  We don't need an out-of-touch billionaire running the country.  We've already tried that experiment and, spoiler alert: it doesn't go well.
@Laura_A_Diaz @orangecone21 @NBCNews @senatemajldr Wasn't commenting on your personal politics.  Just pointing out that it looks like if there even is a partisan gap for federal workers in terms of the D/R split, there isn't much of one.
@Laura_A_Diaz @KeiraJaneReed1 @NBCNews @senatemajldr That doesn't tell you much about the overall partisan makeup of federal workers.  Here are results from a survey of federal workers, which indicates that around 44% are Democrats and 40% are Republicans.  But the difference is within the margin of error.		https://t.co/2xXFxWDgWh
@Laura_A_Diaz @NBCNews @senatemajldr Most federal workers are "every day workers."  That said, a better solution would be to both 1) make it a federal holiday and 2) require companies to either let workers take the full day off or pay them 2x their effective hourly pay with at least 3 hours off during voting hours.
@NBCNews By arguing against a national holiday for voting and saying that it would benefit Democrats, @senatemajldr McConnell is effectively admitting that low voter turnout benefits Republicans.
@washingtonpost The fact that Medicare for All is often portrayed as unrealistic is just ridiculous.  Every other wealthy country in the world has figured out how to provide affordable healthcare for their citizens.  The only thing stopping us is the lack of political will among elites.
@Slate At the heart of all this is Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society.  He had a central role in picking Roberts, Alito, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh--and one of his top priorities is overturning Roe v. Wade.
@GOPLeader Ironic that you'd say that, given that your other tweets today are just dripping with partisan hackery.
@Tgpalmer64 @GOPLeader I'd love to see him change and not make the bank accounts of the super wealthy his top priority.  But that's not going to happen any time soon.
@GOPLeader While you were in power, your greatest accomplishment was funneling more wealth to the super-wealthy.  Glass houses, my friend.
@RepChrisPappas The first bill on the schedule should be one that will withhold pay from Congress during shutdowns.  If y’all can’t keep government open, you’re not doing your job.
@thehill Stephen Miller is a good example of how hatred affects your physical health.  He’s 33 but looks old enough to be his own father.
@thehill I haven't seen a worse negotiation since the Mets' Mo Vaughn contract.
@KamalaHarris What doubters are you talking about?  Big donors have been sending signals that they want you to be the nominee for over a year.
@KingJames Bledsoe to LA confirmed
@PolitiCal1850 @HuffPost I think you meant they didn't become what they are overnight.  And I agree.
@HuffPost Trump is a symptom, not a cause.
@CNN @RepMaxineWaters In his efforts to strong-arm Democrats into a deal ostensibly to increase security he instead weakened security, held 800,000 American workers hostage, and walked away with nothing. #ArtoftheDeal
@thehill Are they starting to doubt his alleged dealmaking abilities?
@AOC If Trump wanted to send Clinton to jail he should have made her part of his campaign team.
I'm glad to see that Bernie's running for President in 2020.  Hopefully the DNC has learned its lesson on the importance of fair primaries.		#Bernie2020	#hindsight2020
@CNN Literally anyone the Democrats put forward can beat Trump in New York.
Fox News’ breathless fear mongering about @AOC and progressive economic policies has really blown up in their faces.		https://t.co/KVwdb07dl7
@ewarren Until we limit the ability of the economic elites to dominate the election process, Washington will continue to work primarily for the wealthy.
@NBCNews @NBCNewsTHINK Kinda hard to make that happen when so many executives and the politicians who act as their foot soldiers are sociopaths.
@BrandNew535 Where do you sign up to run?  I'm working on my Ph.D. in political science and have been planning to become a professor.  But lately I've been giving serious consideration to running against Mitch McConnell.
@cnni We could be a much larger net exporter if we hurry up the transition to renewable energy.
@ABC So ABC News gets their scoops from today's top reddit posts?  Who do you think you are, ESPN?
@CNN Well that's a grave situation.
@NPR There should be a net wealth tax of 5% for estates over $20 million. Use it to give every American $100 to donate in each election, and distribute the rest to states on a per capita basis to fund the things they think are most necessary.
@cnni Don't give Donnie any ideas.
@TheYoungTurks @YouTube Doing the iconic Nixon double peace sign was in bad taste.  But then again, so was getting Nixon's face tattooed on his back.
@HuffPost Maybe he should tell his boss to stop trying to hold American workers hostage over a  wall.
@cnni In other words, he held hundreds of thousands of Americans workers hostage and walked away with nothing but lower approval ratings. #ArtoftheDeal
Roger Stone must be mortified.  He's got Nixon tattooed on his back and even the Nixon Foundation doesn't want to associate with him anymore.  Play stupid games; win stupid prizes.		https://t.co/Xza5p2dvIn

@senatemajldr McConnell is a partisan hack who consistently undermines the capability of our institutions to function properly.  Congress is infested with sociopaths and McConnell is chief among them.  He needs to be voted out in 2020.		#MitchShutdown #WheresMitch
@tdance @senatemajldr There was a bill both parties agreed on weeks ago that @senatemajldr McConnell supported too—but he wouldn’t hold a vote on it because he’s afraid of opposing Trump and facing a Trump-backed primary challenger.  Do your job, Mitch.	#WheresMitch
@ladyoutlander72 @Eli25811589 @ABC @FiveThirtyEight People who would be taxed at those rates have already “won.”  And because of capital gains rates, they pay lower effective tax rates than middle class Americans currently do.  A 70% rate would fix that and allow us to reduce taxes for the middle class.
@ladyoutlander72 @Eli25811589 @ABC @FiveThirtyEight Right, they never paid an effective rate anywhere near 70% even when the top marginal rate was over 90%.  My point was that a top marginal rate of 70% isn’t particularly high when you consider historical rates.
@ladyoutlander72 @Eli25811589 @ABC @FiveThirtyEight You're 100% right.  I should have proofread that.
@ladyoutlander72 @Eli25811589 @ABC @FiveThirtyEight That’s not a counter argument.  The marginal tax rate is *always* lower than the effective tax rate.  Same situation here—with a top marginal rate of 70%, nobody would pay 70% of their income in taxes.
@SteveF35663224 @BernieSanders “Only people that wouldn’t be taxed at 70%” is more than 99.9% of the population.
@Eli25811589 @ABC @FiveThirtyEight That rate would apply to less than 0.1% of the population, so almost by definition it would be somebody else's money.  Don't forget--the top marginal tax rate used to be much higher than 70%.  And yet somehow, economic elites always figured out how to make more money.
@NPR So when will @senatemajldr start talking about impeachment?		Just kidding.  He's too afraid of opposing Trump to even hold a vote on a government funding bill that he and the rest of the GOP supports.
@ABC @FiveThirtyEight Most Americans support a top marginal tax rate of 70%.  But that won't happen without campaign finance reform.  Economic elites dominate our political process and have no intention of raising taxes on themselves.		https://t.co/bp45crMt8B
@cnni Pretty amazing.  Trump is so bad he make GWB look good.		Let's not forget the two endless wars though.
@BernieSanders Most Americans favor a top marginal tax rate of 70%.  But economic elites dominate our political process and have no interest in passing policies that would reduce economic inequality.		https://t.co/bp45crMt8B
@ABC Where is Mitch McConnell?		Oh, that's right.  He's in hiding because he's afraid of opposing Trump and facing a primary challenger.		#WhereIsMitch
@TheEllenShow @senatemajldr McConnell is to blame for the continued shutdown.  He's refusing to hold a vote on a bill he supports because he's afraid of opposing Trump and facing a Trump-backed challenger in 2020.		He cares more about his own re-election than 800,000 Americans.		#WhereIsMitch
