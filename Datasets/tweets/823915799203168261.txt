@FoxNews I would order homeland security to ignore the ruling just like they ignore the constitution. Judicial activism must be abolished.
@BettyMcCollum04 @realDonaldTrump judicial activism must be abolished. It erodes the constitution a little more every time.
@RepRoybalAllard judicial activism must be done away with. It will be the end of this democratic experiment.
