Trump mentions Hillary Clinton. Saying her name super fast and a little more quietly like he is pretending not to say her name. Crowd chants "lock her up."
President Trump says you have to bring back the death penalty. "They have to pay the ultimate price." In a statement, AG Jeff Sessions says the suspect has been charged with crimes that carry the death penalty. So, the death penalty definitely still exists.
President Trump says he will go to his campaign rally tonight in Illinois, even after the mass murder in Pittsburgh because he doesn't want to "let evil win"..."We'll keep our schedule the way it's supposed to be."
In February 2017 President Trump was asked about a rise in antisemitism. This was the exchange. https://t.co/J9LHv8ayVN

I don't know where this story ends. But I am grateful for all the opportunities I've gotten, that I truly couldn't have imagined as I was sobbing in the passenger seat of our Subaru Outback in September 2008. 7/7
This week, the @nprpolitics team is launching a radio show that is airing on nearly 400 stations nationwide. I'm hosting it, along with the incredible @scottdetrow and @asmamk. https://t.co/8cCMJJcNK4 6/
Here we are, ten years later. I've been incredibly lucky. And my husband keeps reminding me of our deal. So, thank you baby for pushing me and believing when I didn't. 5/
So, there were a lot of tears on that drive. A lot of me sobbing to my husband about how he had destroyed my career. He said "if you are going to blame me now, then you have to give me full credit when you succeed." It seemed like a fair (and safe) deal.  4/
I had quit a good job at @KQED to follow love (and hoped somehow to find work in DC). And as we drove, the full extent of the financial crisis was becoming painfully clear. Lehman Brothers failed. Washington Mutual failed. It was really scary and I was unemployed. 3/
Ten years ago this week, my husband, our dog Jezebel and I began a cross country drive from California to Washington, DC. My husband had a post-doctoral fellowship at NIH doing cancer research. But I didn't have a lot of prospects. 2/

@asgreatasnate If you look at the short forms, they include only the most basic questions. Many worry citizenship question would be off putting. But Trump administration has concluded it is worth the risk to get more than just an extrapolation from a sample on that q. https://t.co/zcLCvoi6eT
@PCalith So better language would be, "ACS in its current form began in 2005" - something like that?
@PCalith I am a little confused about that, since they have survey questionnaires going back to 1996, even if the data wasn't released until 2005. Do you understand why? https://t.co/khwhlAu5DS
@AnmolAlphonso Definitely tomorrrow. Or today if huge news.
A lot of conflicting information re: citizenship questions on the Census. Here are the facts: 1. the last time the survey that went to every US household asked about citizenship was 1950. 2. The question has been asked on the long form and ACS since 1970. https://t.co/sZ4rkZRiYU

Today at the White House press briefing @PressSec justified changes to the 2020 census form with a claim that was incomplete and misleading. The full story is more interesting. https://t.co/sZ4rkZRiYU
@elimeny @eads @asmamk @PressSec Thanks! I think I‚Äôve got it all in this more lengthy fact check. But let me know. https://t.co/sZ4rkZRiYU
UPDATE: After this snap fact check, I dug a bit more and found that Sanders must have been referring to the long form, which since 1970 has gone to a smaller sample of households. Here‚Äôs my long form fact check: https://t.co/sZ4rkZRiYU https://t.co/1huBImN9uo
@eads @asmamk @PressSec Was it 2005 or I. The late 1990s? Upon further digging I found forms going back to like 1996. And it had a lot of overlap with the long form.
@Donkey_Tales @nana4MANY @PressSec long form (which is similar to ACS) vs short form (which is received by the vast majority of households).

RE: the Census, @PressSec says citizenship has been asked every year since 1965 except 2010. But she is referring to the smaller American Community Survey, which isn't used to determine congressional representation. It's been 50 years since main Census asked about citizenship.

Here is President Trump's bump stock memo. In a statement, DOJ says "The Department understands this is a priority for the President and has acted quickly to move through the rulemaking process. We look forward to the results of that process as soon as it is duly completed." https://t.co/MrycvRZagX
@PoliticOwlDan I‚Äôm seeking clarity myself.

I'm having a hard time finding Truman's record, but President Trump has not exceeded the number of bills signed by this time in the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama (though sheer numbers aren't a great way to measure legislative achievement anyway). https://t.co/0CkJ4dYqTp
