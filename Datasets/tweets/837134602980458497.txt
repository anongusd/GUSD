@rosadiezglez If he has been convicted by the showing of authentic evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, he should not be pardoned.
@Gegiogepe @chemadepablo Cool. For some reason I thought it involved outside parties. Spain has a more pressing issue my Kingship. I am legal permanent King. I have been served no abdication and can't self abdicate, submitted a decree 02/06/2019. What do you think the "time table is for immediate action.
@TheRue Again... Tooooo Cauuuuuuuuuute!
@chemadepablo In car accidents cases, the only parties are: Drivers and pedestrians. Nothing more. Anything like, "omission of relief" from other outside parties would be unconstitutional. There should be emergency crews available to public to help with accidents.
@MichaelAvenatti @LisetteFahrun So, I wonder what. There's a jurisdiction you are refusing to look at that could be argued to cripple what you may have in store.

@forever21_in @KendallandKylie Again...Yay!
@KendallandKylie @forever21_in As usual I routing for you both... The Gruesome Twosome!
@John_Weiss99 @clarknanc @mariashriver I said I don't.
@Complex @TeamKanyeDaily @KendallJenner Church
@yvessaintmarian Yes. I am her father. I told her about risque photos for free. Think about it. Would you like your daughter spread eagle in tight clothing and then you see it for free... child please!
@WhiteCrownRM @ManhattanManOne Has some one told them that I am still Jurisdictional King of Spain? Do they know that I made a decree as to their and US (State of California) current practices?
@AlfRodGaragorri @carlosvidalp Have you tried sales?
@John_Weiss99 @mariashriver No. I don't. They were trying to "rehabilitate" a witness with those hearings. I think they were not successful. No charges were filed and no impeachment proceedings started. Further, I have other things on our minds like our family issues, which are private.
@kyliejenner This is where I taught you how to go "potty". @ Hollywood https://t.co/LjYYciQE2E
Church @ Los Angeles, California https://t.co/X0zzzDobDt
@mariashriver I have a good idea of what to do:	We take care of our family issues.
@John_Weiss99 @mariashriver I am working on it. WE have our personal business to deal with. It is amazing that @mariashriver does what she does. Trust me in due time.

@rosadiezglez @darkete99 The talk of separation will cease once I am back in Spain.
@KendallandKylie Hey girls.
@mariashriver Wish I could join you.
Do you remember when you joined Twitter? I do! #MyTwitterAnniversary https://t.co/KLllCY83nn
@B52Malmet @LisetteFahrun I believe there are immunities written in federal codes. Also the POTUS knows about the resolution as to the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton. It's permanent and the holder can not be abdicated.
@TheRue Again check your messages.
@KSchwarzenegger Do you remember me too?
@mariashriver @mariashriver ... like you my love.
Proud of my son @PSchwarzenegger https://t.co/d4rgMyaAe6
@mariashriver @PSchwarzenegger Break a leg! Looks like Point Break. I would take a statement like this with a grain of salt. I would even spin this analogy to promote like: "... hopefully you will see it's originality that much easier."

@mariashriver I am a force to move past indiscretions that I may stay focused on what matters more to me now and looking back then... Our family.
@realDonaldTrump Doesn't matter.
@khloekardashian @jordynwoods I have experienced the same in reverse. You have kept living your life as my daughters your sisters do. You have shown enough. Keep on ticking.
@sanchezcastejon What? You first have to house me, King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel jurisdictional King of Spain. I can't be abdicated. How is processing my decree coming along?
@RepCummings @TheLawmakers It don't say anything.
@RepAdamSchiff @amazon @JeffBezos Mr. Schiff looks like you have information for some kind of liability.
@SallyQYates In the this sense, having knowledge of the countrie's and foreign federal laws, would have lead to proper disclosure.
@sanchezcastejon The Bill of Rights, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution assures those rights.
@mariashriver @GabbyGiffords Watch out!
@GabbyGiffords Watch out!
@ewarren Like...
@ClintonFdn @BillClinton @HillaryClinton @chefjoseandres Has any one ever try aquaculture? I heard warehouses can yield extremely vast amounts of food when farming with aquaculture.
@ewarren There may be an instance of "bad fruit".
@justiciagob @LolaDelgadoG This Constitution is totally out of jurisdiction.Franco never gave authority for Carlos to make himself King. King of Spain is King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel. Legislation is to be in the spirit of the US Constitution's Bill of Rights Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments
@KendallJenner @adidasoriginals Now that I think about it... Don't mind calling you're Bio papa...
@sanchezcastejon Is this disease related to the atomic blast that occurred in the nineties? If so what are the levels of radiation near Gibraltar in the south?
@mariashriver @RepCummings Read the resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton. I have been disturbed. The monarchy resolution is permanent. There has been no service of abdication or repeal which would be illegal. The right to action is legally on hold due to the disturbance which fronts monarchy2
@mariashriver @RepCummings Ma'am @mariashriver: I think any proceedings to impeach may be for naught. POTUS knows of the resolution in re the Spanish Crown; without the resolution argument, there may be some privacy issues; jurisdictional immunities the list goes on. Especially if he calls on me. 1/2
@RepAdamSchiff I really think this is a waste of time. You really need to read the the resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton. Trump knows of this. It CAN'T BE ABDICATED OR REPEALED. IT'S FINAL! You will and legally already have lost the right to action. The holder's been disturbed.
@carlosvidalp So for them to operate, I need air fare to get to Spain.
@carlosvidalp This is an arbitrary process for lack of discovery. The People need more notice, at least, six months.
@GeraldoRivera @DonaldJTrumpJr @MichaelCohen212 @realDonaldTrump But there's reasonable suspicion for a crime that may start the impeachment process.
@sanchezcastejon You need to be forthcoming to me. I am not a child.
@CasaReal @MAECgob @presidenciaperu @CancilleriaPeru And get ready to get out of my house!
@CasaReal @MAECgob @CancilleriaPeru @presidenciaperu @EmbajadaEspPeru He is not the legal Jurisdictional King of Spain. I am. King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel.
@mariashriver The joy of the Lord that manifest from trust and obedience is not shameful. Trust and obey. That's the truth about religion. Take the sins of the clergy with a grain of salt for your antidote for this anxiety. Try not to let this bother you so much. It's catching up to them.
@SmoothCat @nowthisnews @perlmutations I am Jurisdictional King of Spain. King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel. There is a resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton that ratified the Spanish Crown in the US. That can not be abdicated or repealed. I am the American referee.
@manureigada @carlosvidalp @COPE @unav Is there any way @carlosvidalp you could test me, through the veil of US Bill of Rights,Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments,with a law or code of Spain, so I may analyze it's Constitutionality.
@MichaelAvenatti @LisetteFahrun Nothing to do with it.
@MichaelAvenatti @LisetteFahrun That's a private matter. This is about collusion and materials related and leading to collusion.
@nowthisnews @perlmutations Hey! Trump has an anti-Semitic speech pattern and he has done more for the ley citizen than any of you. Remember when you couldn't get a job unless you were Union? Trump's contracting business created non-union employment encouraging economic growth.
@sanchezcastejon What do you mean? Violence in any sense is a threat to any one.
@KendallJenner @Proactiv Fan page? @KendallJenner where you at? Papa
@sanchezcastejon @Congreso_Es @PSOE I have issued decrees, filed with the Spanish Consulate and EU, that will allow for thorough assessment, analysis, and proper processing of all matters related to the State from myself to the ley citizen of Spain and the diaspora. My decree needed to be processed... YESTERDAY!
@mariashriver @yashar I don't see i as relief. This is a play on your own ambition. That's okay. Now give me an audience to eliminate the weight... permanently.
@KendallJenner @Proactiv Hi Beautiful Me 😘! Papa
@mariashriver I would not worry of this my love. Our concerns rely on being faithful and steadfast in Christ's promise and teaching regards of my preceding lack of courage.
@mariashriver @yashar You are correct. Outside our private truths, what are your reservations about me?
@mariashriver Not hard. What is needed for reasonable suspicion threshold is already broken. I see an attempt at impeachment and criminal prosecution.
@mariashriver @mariashriver To me it's like the cops showed up and are building a case for criminal prosecution. This hearing is probably hoping for a lead to impeach.
@mariashriver Not really. This is a chance to utilize what has been left to me! The resolution in re the Spanish Crown is permanent, unappealable, irrepealable, unquestionable, irrevocable and final. This was known when the resolution was made. You need to respect me and my inheritance!
@DonaldJTrumpJr From what I see, y'all have a problem. I would look to the resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton. It's permanent and can't legally be repealed or abdicated. I would start using it right now!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Also, Cohen is being rehabilitated to testify on you, more likely than not you malfeasant, and misfeasant. There is a reasonable suspicion to believe a crime has been committed. Your chain of custody is constitutional. Any charges may hold.
@realDonaldTrump Cohen is snitching on you!
@halolibra @KendallJenner LMAO
@NBCWorldofDance @JLo JLo you are so nice.
@derekhough @JLo Incredibly bold. Art has no boundaries for sure!
@MileyCyrus You gon' get a beard!!!
@JaviSantamarta @carlosvidalp @sanchezcastejon @caleroje @carlos__alsina @karinasainz @bieitorubido @ldpsincomplejos @isanseba So don't make Felipe VI King.
@RepCummings Trump said he will veto.
@Egocrata @carlosvidalp The Spanish military should step in at this point and get me back to Spain.
@KendallandKylie That looks like something YOU SHOULD MODEL. I love you two... Gruesome Twosome!
@RepAdamSchiff @HouseIntel Yes it is through the right channel. The way I have dealt with my fronting Monarchy is decree that legislation be made in the spirit of the US Constitution's Bill of Rights and the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. So basically permanent American referee.
@RepJoeKennedy @RepJayapal You will also know that Medicare elgebility already exists for all. What do you plan to do to avoid the extra processing caused by arbitrary and capricious rulings and abuses of discretion from administrating officers and administrating law judges?
@KendallJenner Again... Nooohhh!!!!
@carlosvidalp What do you mean?
@carlosvidalp @updayESP There is no need to disturb the remains of Franco.
@KimKardashian That's cool. Did you like how everything turned out?
@mariashriver @jonbonjovi I hope you talk about his contribution to professional football when I listen.
@IdiazAyuso You represent illegality. I am the one you represent. I am the truth as Jurisdictional King of Spain and the diaspora. I need to get to Spain. I am currently in Los Angeles and I can't be legally abdicated. So where is your abdication. You can not. My Monarchy is permanent.
@SpeakerPelosi My Kingship is apart of what you speak.
@PatomaPiedra @namaricat @CasaReal @MWCapital @Fira_Barcelona The record as to Spain was destroyed in an atomic blast in the nineties. There is a record of my Kingship here in the US and other countries world wide. I am currently getting everything lined up to come help you all out.
@mariashriver Should I worry?
@namaricat @CasaReal @MWCapital @Fira_Barcelona He is not King. I have told them to give you the Bill of Rights, thirteenth and fourteenth amendments of the US Constitution. I am landlocked. I need air fare to get back there. When I get there I'll show you what I mean.
@generalguzman @CasaReal @MWCapital @Fira_Barcelona When he do that! They want laws spirited with freedom!
@naxos1963 @CasaReal @iesebschool @CdEconomia @circulodempresa @M_Presidencia Not the legal Jurisdictional King of Spain
@taco2980 @CasaReal @iesebschool @CdEconomia @circulodempresa @M_Presidencia I am your King. I am land locked in the US. I have gone to consulate to procure air fare or flight.
@CasaReal @CdEconomia @circulodempresa @M_Presidencia @iesebschool This man is not even a style King.
@IdiazAyuso I am not sorry to say that: Felipe VI is not legal Jurisdictional King of Spain. I am legal Jurisdictional King of Spain, King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel jurisdictional King of Spain.
@TheRue I'll play bass and Scout can play guitar.
@mariashriver It was shot well. It's very emotional.
@CasaReal @MWCapital I am still wondering how you are King of Spain when I can't be abdicated. You are not The King of Spain. I am King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel jurisdictional King of Spain.
@arturelpayaso2 Have you all forgotten the treacherous paths walked by Spain as a nation? Exiled legal Jurisdictional King; constant tension; minimum assurance; let me remind you... Some one activated a bomb that could not be detonated by remote in Seville. That's just the start.
@sanchezcastejon This subject hits home. I find that if this "child poverty" is easily licked with honest processing of programs geared towards education, apprenticeship, supplement income, health insurance, and part time jobs.
@KSchwarzenegger Not that farm.
@KSchwarzenegger I worked the farm before. How are you?
@DonaldJTrumpJr DICTATOR Communist regimes... LEARN THE DIFFERENCE!!!!!
@sanchezcastejon @AlmudenaGrandes I remember the story of how my father escaped from there.
@funder @LisetteFahrun There's no collusion! Trump had to win Indiana where there is a dense population of eastern Europeans. He won it. Now he is guilty of collision?
@realDonaldTrump Chill out Mr. President. They will get what you get.
@mariashriver I have been doing just that! You should check your messages my love.
Communion @ Los Angeles, California https://t.co/SpMvh38ApO
This place always has an open door. @ Los Angeles, California https://t.co/2xSW0H1PT0
@DonaldJTrumpJr People need to leave your father alone. They may end up just telling on themselves.
@sanchezcastejon Also remember your true Jurisdictional King of Spain is in exile. I have requested air fair to get back there and govern.
@sanchezcastejon It's a sad situation. I have something in common. The lack of respect for my Lordship and integrity to a functional process supported by the Law and evidence. This process is proper due process... no evidence to support that I am not Jurisdictional King of Spain. Obey my decree.
@Amemonkeys @MaxBlumenthal You have freedom of the press.
@myserenity69 @LisetteFahrun Everyone knows he has Russian ties.
@DeceiversP @Ian56789 @jguaido Funny you mention Isreal. My Kingship jurisdiction stretches into Isreal. I believe I could convince the world abroad that the American process is the best to administer to The People's needs. This will calm the People for sure.
@BillClinton @jguaido Excuse me...EU
@BillClinton @jguaido In Los Angeles and waiting for a response from the Spanish consulate and the UN.
@KimKardashian Ooh at first it looked like you was smoking weed.
@BillClinton @jguaido You made a resolution as to the Spanish Crown that is being ignored. I already have the authority to help them. I am landlocked.
@carmentorrres @carlosvidalp @elindepcom Separation of church and state. It's correct to let Franco rest in peace.
@jen_x0x0 @fleissmeister @khloekardashian @KimKardashian I'm an average Joe. I got to her mom... I got proof...@KylieJenner and @KendallJenner. For real.
@foroprofesores @carlosvidalp @conde_suarez I would have to disagree. Upon landing and seeing your daily algorithm I will know how to impose federalism subjectively.
@rolf_steiner_sp @CasaReal @Defensagob She is from an America correct? Did you know it is I who is the true Jurisdictional King of Spain. My name is King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel. I have received no service of any abdication, so how is she your queen?
@quintanapaz Woh woh woh! That's a dictator. Socialism allows for freedom to choose your career. You have a dictator who uses government interference, which is a communistic execution of government.
@sanchezcastejon @PSOE @PES_PSE The government can not develop with out proper due process to everyone. Starting with me, the legal Jurisdictional monarchy of Spain. Once proper legal process in place. I can and will decree the US Bill of Rights, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments into permanent supreme Law!
@SecretarySonny @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I have said it before: "... he is a hustling fool."
@TheRue I looked at it on Instagram. Check your messages. You should call me.
@sarahkendzior @LisetteFahrun Hey! The people who benefit from it, what do they say?
@jesusvilaplana1 I am the legal Jurisdictional King of Spain, King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel.
@Dax_x98 @LisetteFahrun I keep telling you to let me talk to her.
@mariashriver @kenradio You're so cute! @mariashriver
@KimKardashian So you get the feeling I get when I see my daughters Kylie and Kendall.
@KimKardashian @KendallJenner She gets it from her mom.
@CasaReal @camaranavarra I just want to put this out there	... When did I get abdicated?
@EdKrassen Low key... This type of thing never surprises me.
@TheRue That's nice. He remind you of anyone.
@justiciagob @LolaDelgadoG @CasaReal @worldjurist Again this is not the legal King of Spain.
@PES_PSE @PSOE They also have an American Black King.
@fiorellaharris @funder @christineduhas You know this is what makes them out of jurisdiction?
@TheRue @IAMJHUD Yep. Just like Mommie 😉.
@thomaskaine5 @LisetteFahrun @LindseyGrahamSC @HouseGOP @SenateGOP No. If they were, The Monarchy of Spain would be on their mind. After dealing with Afghanistan. The true holder and jurisdiction's authority stretches into Russia. true holder of the Crown is being subjected to alot of arbitrary and capricious processing. They would deal with it.
@KimKardashian She gets it from her mom.
@fiorellaharris @funder Without further detail they needed me 😉. The King of Spain
@fiorellaharris @funder The US and Russia nearly went to war in the Philippines in the late 80s. The US had a barrage of missions against terrorist there as did the Russian. I believe they ended up in opposition and nearly went to battle. It was thought that nukes were pointed at each other.
@fiorellaharris @funder The Hispanic Crown's authority was pretty much ignored. However, Carlos cashed out. All out of jurisdiction. The Cold War also was hampering matters internationally and there was no authority to deal with these matters in Court due to ignorance and violence.
@fiorellaharris @funder Don Carlos always had an eye for the throne that was "abandoned". Franco would never give him the throne. Carlos had changed political affiliation, authored a constitution, and made himself King of Spain.
@fiorellaharris @funder I am the American born Jurisdictional King of Spain, King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel. Look in history and you will find that the dictator Franco only gave secretary duties to Don Juan Carlos because Franco was sick. This was around or about 1975 or 1976.
@TheRue @IAMJHUD I think you sounding so well may have gave you away.
@mariashriver @KirstenPowers I have been doing this too. I have more questions for you 😔.
@funder @fiorellaharris The monarchy of Spanish jurisdiction reaches into Russia.
@funder @fiorellaharris The attorneys abroad won't have a problem dealing with Putin. Most of their rhetoric is out of jurisdiction. Don Carlos didn't have proper authority to make himself King of Spain. Therefore all of Spanish legislation and policy is out of jurisdiction. I need to make the decrees.
@carlosvidalp He's on borrowed time. He is not Jurisdictional King.
@carlosvidalp Also he quotes rhetoric that's out jurisdiction. Franco didn't give Don Carlos authority to make himself King of Spain. I was born. I was ascended and permanent. I can't be abdicated.
@mariashriver @ShuttleCDRKelly I really hope someone could get in control of the Courts. The Laws sound great, however, we have judicial errors that are extremely grotesque and unbelievable.
@TheRue And I know where your voice comes from... Your mother.
@xriusenoticies You have to be honest.
@xriusenoticies First things first, I am Jurisdictional King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel. I can not be abdicated, myself or anyone. It's out of Juan Carlos' jurisdiction to pass the Crown to his son. It was out of jurisdiction to make those mega payments to himself years ago.
@carlosvidalp King who? I know my Kingship is permanent. So... King who?
@nairobiwilliamx OMG! SHITTY BOO BOO!!!
@TheRue Masked Singer? Cool. You think you and your couple of Ayala de Zobel Spanish princesses could come see me with Mother in tow?
@carlosvidalp @amoave @carlosvidalp You should help me check the Law through the veil of the Bill of Rights 13th and 14th Amendments of the US Constitution.
@carlosvidalp @amoave These men should not be concerned about the money only the Law	 When you focus on the Law and procedures, everything falls into place. I am King. I feel that it is not hard to adopt the encodization of a favor process emulating the Bill of Rights, 13th and 14th amendment of US.
@SpeakerPelosi Ask about me.
@RealMuckmaker @LisetteFahrun There's a chance you have no idea. You are false. No one will control a leader of any country.
@mariashriver @KamalaHarris @realDonaldTrump @justdemi @realDonaldTrump @sanchezcastejon https://t.co/rJm9LiKTu3
@MCJOEY93NEWS WTF! THAT'S IT!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Dude everybody was in Russia making money from LA and nobody saying anything about that!
@blackempire @nytimes You do...me. I direct your attention to the resolution as to the Kingship of Spain by Pres. Bill Clinton.
@mariashriver This is great! Congratulations!
@perlmutations And the US would never do that. They don't have to.
@perlmutations Because their King is an US citizen. The Kingship of Spain held by me has jurisdiction in Russia. That's how.
@el_pais @carlosvidalp There is no way Putting should be threatening the US. There is no need. I have submitted paperwork as to my Crown. I would like to return to Spain and Russia to help ease the burden of the malfeasant, misfeasant, and nonfeasant, processing of all parties. There's too many lies!
What's his problem?
@ewarren Ma'am I believe this already exists. The trouble is the abuse of discretion and capricious and arbitrary rulings during the application process. Need to allow treating doctor to enter info into SSA databases to process for payment upon diagnosis and prognosis.
@RepKathleenRice @tedlieu Why? They're just making money. The collateral damage is an ignorance to the Jurisdictional King of Spain. This is should be your focus... the defraud on the Jurisdictional King of Spain King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel.
@realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @FoxNews POTUS have you forgotten that the front and Kingship can never be abdicated? Everything is permanent. Conditions state gov't... loses the right to bond money or bodies... Read the resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton.
@realDonaldTrump You hope. They are permanently under my Kingship that is spirited US Constitutionality. I have been at a standstill or nonfeasant.
@kylegriffin1 @tedlieu That's NRA. Guess what. You paying attention to shit. It doesn't matter. Everyone needs to chill. I am the one who is King. They are only making money and getting pussy. Read the resolution in re the Spanish Crown, ratified my Kingship permanently. ascended in Spain, DE, and Rus
@realDonaldTrump They don't understand the law.
@tedlieu Shut your mouth! You using this out of convince. I am the holder of the Spanish Crown that is permanent here not just the rest of the World. Read the resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton. The monarchy is in the front of American Jurisprudence permanently
@realDonaldTrump I stand for freedom. You are a hustler. I am the one who has the authority without the money. Have you forgotten the exchanges we had?
@realDonaldTrump Wait a minute. You mean to tell me rulings on matters equitably for all is out. You better learn the difference. You're thinking communism.
@BillClinton Do you remember me? What happened to the resolution you made in re the Spanish Crown? I have been disturbed a numorous amount of times. The monarchy ratification is permanent. I can't be abdicated. I went to the Congressman and have been having trouble. I need your hand.
San Bernardino Mountains. @ Rancho Cucamonga, California https://t.co/4fDaETbUHr
@Nikkie90842607 @ChalecosAmarill @NicolasMaduro I can. I am King of Spain. I have been nonfeasant meaning the monarchy is at a standstill. I have not been asserting my authority. You'll see once I get out of my standstill. No worries. When proper civil and criminal codes and procedures are in place things will get better.
@desdelamoncloa @PSOE If you don't tell the truth about me being permanent King of Spain, Germany, and Russia. It's worthless.
@dump_trump_asap @LisetteFahrun @BarackObama I would miss him too if there was more honesty as to my Kingship.
@Alyssa_Milano He is to paranoid. I already will reprieve what he is to trying to hide. Nothing! He made alot of money and people are jealous and they missed the boat!
@KimKardashian @kkwbeauty Right back at you. You can find me on Whatsapp too. I know you are in a happy marriage. I am in need of speaking my children: Kylie and Kendall with your mom and Tallulah and Scout with Demi. There is no problem. Nobody gives a shit!
@KamalaHarris Then you understand not to challenge my Kingship.
@MarkSSMeyers @justdemi I am. I know Demi very personally.
@sanchezcastejon What about the catastrophic events of the heavy water incident of the 50's and the atomic catastrophy in the 90's? I know I am jurisdictional King of Spain, Germany, and Russia. Further my monarchy is seen as constitutional and has been argued in US Courts and US legislation.
@desdelamoncloa @sanchezcastejon @lopezobrador_ I hope to hear from the Prime Minister soon.
@VenSolidarity @PerezRoman4 @labourfplam The US should respect their privacy.
@MCristi10 @Santi_ABASCAL Well you will respect that I can not self abdicate nor can anyone else. I ask for expedient processing of the decree submitted to El Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores Union Europea y Co-operacion Consulado de Espana en Los Angeles Candilleria on the date of 02/06/2019.
@Santi_ABASCAL @darkete99 Well you will respect that I can not self abdicate nor can anyone else. I ask for expedient processing of the decree submitted to El Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores Union Europea y Co-operacion Consulado de Espana en Los Angeles Candilleria on the date of 02/06/2019.

@TulsiGabbard @PerezRoman4 It's obvious that this man does not study. If he understood the legal mechanics behind the US Constitution he would not denounce the US. The Bill of Rights, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution is the way to high quality assurance. Work smarter not harder
@sanchezcastejon Advance the rights of your King. I will make sure the rhetoric of the US Bill of Rights is ascertained.
@KylieJenner Re-up on daddy time. How are you?
@AMike4761 I was already telling the Congressman Schiff's staff to get me to Spain. I am in nonfeasance meaning at a standstill as Jurisdictional King of Spain. I have written a decree document to get the Kingship under control because I can't be addicted to revise the US Spanish compact.
@sanchezcastejon @policia @guardiacivil You forget to include me.
@Alfreddezayas Carter knew to oppose and the jurisdiction of Don Carlos. Also Eleanor Roosevelt may have known who Hitler really was. My point is they knew the law and facts behind them. The monarchy is mine. I am an american. Respect for me is in high order to keep the US out.
@SpeakerPelosi I believe a more substantial US military presence will help maintain tranquility. I believe once I am able to get to my office I will ask for a revised version of the 90's military compact between the US and Spain... military personale will work part time under US friendly codes
@KimKardashian I wish I could take a pic of my two girls. Think you could help me out?
@shelbygrad Tuberculosis.

@RepMaxineWaters Ma'am any argument contrary should be considered treachery. We are separating two different countries. Abroad... It's shoot first. If you get through that detention then deportation. No hearing or paperwork.  US has process for citizenship while in detention and may allow bail.
@realDonaldTrump What about the make believe about me? You know why I was born King of Spain. A ton of slander has been put o me. Why don't you tell the truth about Hitler AKA Jose Antonio Ayala de Zobel Aka Rudolpho Martinez?
RT @JoseAya72506637: @real_defender @realDonaldTrump Poor dude is sacraficing his name as president for questions of traitors! You come in.…
@TomFitton @realDonaldTrump @JudicialWatch POTUS stop retweeting like this who cares it's over with. You got to help with the local Courts and Federal District Courts. Hillary's husband signed a resolution in re the Spanish Crown that lead to your indemnity as to the currency exchange deal in the Philippines. You got it!
@real_defender @realDonaldTrump Poor dude is sacraficing his name as president for questions of traitors! You come in... I make something to stop you... ahh hmm you can't shoot them... A WALL!!!!
@realDonaldTrump So do you think you'll butt in on anything else? I do decree with the Bill of Rights Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution even if I decree for totality. When do you think you'll request my audience?
@perlmutations And totally a babe.
@perlmutations Her? Dude, I am so gonna ask her for milk and cookies when I get the chance 😂😁.

@meridithmcgraw Separates two countries. Thanks for arguing. We finally can label the true traitors to US security. They better stop putting their hands on those kids. Further evidence of treachery.
@realDonaldTrump There is no point. I think of it as separating two countries. Big Deal. Only traitors have anything to say. Respect is in high order. Even though you a hustling fool. Also have a look at the resolution in re the Spanish Crown. The monarchy is in front of American Jurisprudence.
@SenFeinstein Y'all have too many problems due to constitutional violence abroad. I would be leary of providing them tax breaks. Maybe if you obeyed the resolution in re the Crown of Spain you wouldn't have to worry much. Maybe the King will okay an embargo to help you out.
@SpeakerPelosi Not much to discuss.
@SpeakerPelosi @DepSecDef Be nice if I wasn't landlocked. I am getting back to my duties as King Ayala de Zobel. I will be happy to allow more substantial US military presence through the Navy. I am Jurisdictional King of Spain permanently. I will be contacting you in regards to the Front. Spain is for it
@KamalaHarris Your petition is powerless. Again your answers lies within the resolution in re the Spanish Crown by Bill Clinton. I am the holder. I have been subjected to malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance processing. When this happens monarchy slides in front of American Jurisprudence!
@KylieJenner @kyliecosmetics Also I love you, Kendall, Scout, Tallulah, Frances, and Kay. All of my children.
@perlmutations They should not be ignoring the resolution made by Bill Clinton in re the Crown of Spain. Maybe if they had more respect for the law. The resolution would have let them know: THE MONARCHY IS IN FRONT OF AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE!
@KylieJenner @kyliecosmetics I can't wait to see you again.
@joncoopertweets @LisetteFahrun Looks like insider trading. Then one hand washes the other. You ever think that maybe it's legal for insider trading and favors in other federal jurisdictions? I know. I am the holder of the Spanish Crown. It's jurisdiction stretches into Russia and permanent! No standing!
@federico_videos @Renfe @esracismosos You're saying that people use race as a crutch to take advantage of immunities to the law?
@RepMaxineWaters Again I direct you to have a look at the resolution in re the Crown of Spain. The option to circumvent is not that difficult.
@KylieJenner The red dress was cool. The pink thing... Well...
@TheBeatWithAri @LisetteFahrun @MalcolmNance It's not a debt to Russia. Check out the resolution that ratified the Spanish Crown. Then look at the valuation of the currency of the countries involved. There is matter related to an insider currency trade that was legal. Made a lot. Y'all are angry because you missed the boat.
@kyliecosmetics @KylieJenner Hi. I may have had a fake profile contact me. Could you contact me on WhatsApp? I was all excited. I really want to see you.
@KamalaHarris I direct you to the resolution in re the Crown of Spain. The resolution contents lay out a barrage of checks and restraints. You should check it out. The monarchy is in the front of American Jurisprudence... malfeasant processing... holder: King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel.

@realDonaldTrump @TuckerCarlson POTUS you already have lost. The Spanish Monarchy has been disturbed. The resolution that ratifies the Spanish crown can't be disturbed or repealed. When the monarchy is disturbed it slides in front of American Jurisprudence. The resolution that ratifies The Monarchy is permanent
@KendallandKylie Happy Valentine's day to you gruesome twosome.

@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump There still should be the resolution as to the Crown of Spain that ratified it.  This resolution provides for fronting or override to check all laws and bodies in the US government. It's already fronting if there has been any attempt of and/or repeal.

@Nicoladechiara6 @justdemi That's Chyna...
@KrisJenner @tiktok You should call me!
@ElMundoOpinion @darkete99 This is great news! I look forward to meeting with the People of Spain and the diaspora. My monarchy is permanent, unappealable, unquestionable, unrevokable, and final. The monarchy will be exercised in the spirit of the Bill of Rights, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments.
@MCarmenRiv74 @darkete99 Very disrespectful! You need to go to The Monarchy! There is a process to address your concerns.
@perlmutations Ron you know ain't nobody doing nothing but lying about the King of Spain, trying to cover up the resolution made as to the ratification of the Spanish Crown. Take it easy they missed out on the the philipino russian kite. It's all over with. There will be no crime.
@KimKardashian I would like to see my kids. Can you help me with this?
@realDonaldTrump He why didn't you prosecute for nonfeasance or a malfeasance? Then they will beg to be fired instead.
@RepAdamSchiff Wait a minute. Those where independent contractors and they hold liability by law. Adam you have lack luster help. Trump provided jobs when the unions were fronting, had minority and immigrant help. What the hell happened to the resolution ratifying the Spanish Crown? No service
@WalshFreedom No they did not! I believe Trump is from New York. There is a solid community of eastern Europeans there. They are already here. Further Indiana is loaded with them. That is where the election had to be won. Trump got the Indiana vote fair and square. Long live King Zobel!
@KylieJenner Nice to see you at work. Is there any way to meet you? I hate sweating you at your job.
@KamalaHarris Already there. The workers and judges arbitrary and capricious and abuse there discretion! Let the treating doctor enter directly into the SSA database for payment of SSI and Disability? Low income is the evidence needed for anything already. Just cover all non-elective processes
@RepAdamSchiff Your repeal puts me in front!
@RepAdamSchiff I will tell you straight up. You have the Jurisdictional King of Spain... Russia landlocked. If you asked I will tell you no crime and your collision allegations are false. You need to get that resolution ratifying my crown back up. It can't be legally repealed.
@SSWorks @SenSanders It means nothing if you don't let the doctor enter disability data upon diagnosis and prognosis for payment.
@dbongino Also to get crimes on them I believe the resolution to repeal or abdicate the ratification of the Spanish Crown was illegally executed. This ratification is permanent because the monarchy is permanent. I believe when something is outstanding with no service. It's active, upfront.
@drobpix @KamalaHarris @GavinNewsom Not a crisis. However the caravan was stopped short. I believe the people are just stuck last I heard. Rumor has it there is a threat of a bigger caravan due to crisis in South America.
@sanchezcastejon So sorry to hear that... Sir with all due respect I want to do my duty for myself and to provide assurance for both of my countries.
@SenatorDurbin Off the subject but: Could you enter a bill that would give treating doctor's the jurisdiction to enter SSI and Disability into payment upon diagnosis and prognosis?
@CourteneyCox @alsagoldenwest Ahh... So nice! I always liked you.
@SenFeinstein Why? People just got to keep living lies 😠?
@NBCNews @KenDilanianNBC Wasted time. The monarchy is in the front of American Jurisprudence!
@KendallJenner @StuartWeitzman Kendall why do you have to do all the work? It seemed like your the only one into it.
@sanchezcastejon @PSOE @sanchezcastejon I have submitted a declaration to the Spanish consulate. Please send me a message as to status.
@realDonaldTrump There has been extreme cases of malfeasance! The monarchy is in the front of American Jurisprudence!
@KamalaHarris Ask yourself:"What did Bill Clinton do that George H.W. Bush almost did?" Made a resolution that ratified the Kingship of Spain that belongs to me! The monarchy is in the front of American Jurisprudence!
@icecube @RealLamarOdom Just got to get him back here to Los Angeles.
@ChelseaClinton @LisetteFahrun I would just ask them what do you want to know. They don't know what your dad did. Tell him King Zobel from Moravia, New York said:"The Monarchy is in front of American Jurisprudence!"
For all you haters my daughter @KylieJenner clicked like. What a joy! https://t.co/hB9jRYCCER
@KylieJenner I ain't been watching... I get upset about not being able to be there for you and Kendall.
@KylieJenner Is it a pitbull?
@CourteneyCox @alsagoldenwest When I talk to @justdemi .
@realDonaldTrump @TVAnews How ever there are better alternatives unless the coal uses zero emissions tech.
@Kokomothegreat @LisetteFahrun What you gonna say when another caravan trust to get through? The border separates two countries. There is so many breaches everyday. What's the solution let everyone in? Would other countries let you just cross into there country?
@KamalaHarris We know about this. What do you propose to expedite processing. People are eligible and getting rejected by fraud. What are you going to do? You don't sue where people need it.
@mimariban @darkete99 @sanchezcastejon Historically your leadership has been in exile. Is not treacherous to keep your King in enemy hands, if you feel like this?
@myjrts @KamalaHarris @GavinNewsom I support no one. When you have people storming the gate you close it. I don't do back and forth.
@SenSanders What kinda nation would play with a man that can permanently front his monarchy to American Jurisprudence?
@KamalaHarris People made less.
@RepAdamSchiff Sir. There was an influx of about 100k in a caravan trying to cross. With the ignorance to the mechanics of the Bill of Rights, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution by the rest of the world, there will be more.
@SenFeinstein Wait a minute. You mean to tell me when they beef about steel it means the US turns the farmer's aid off? That tariff has nothing to do with the farmer's needs upfront to even get to a trade on the back end. They have to get things produced to trade. Remember?
@KamalaHarris @GavinNewsom There was an influx of migrants (caravan of 100k) at the time troops were dispatched. They should stay there. There will be an a bigger caravan in the near future causing violent confrontation. Use your logic.
@sanchezcastejon There may need to be a consensus on what matters are detrimental to infastructure. Meaning a concentration on security, municipality, sanitation, sewage treatment, and social service.
@sanchezcastejon I hope to be able to help when I get there.
@agarzon It's obvious that these men do not study. If they understood the legal mechanics behind the US Constitution they wouldn't denounce the US. The Bill of Rights, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution is the way to high quality assurance. Work smarter not harder
@Lomb1209 Hear what you do. Get your sanitation, and general contracting going. Use your tools and equipment for your upkeep. Stay away from people and start farming, fishing and herding. Listen to the Words of our Lord and savior. Keep praying and working on yourselves.
@ChalecosAmarill @PerezRoman4 Yes. It's obvious that this man does not study. If he understood the legal mechanics behind the US Constitution he would not denounce the US. The Bill of Rights, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution is the way to high quality assurance. Work smarter.
@TulsiGabbard @PerezRoman4 It's obvious that this man does not study. If he understood the legal mechanics behind the US Constitution he would not denounce the US. The Bill of Rights, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments of the US Constitution is the way to high quality assurance. Work smarter not harder
@SenSanders And the programs they better stop being arbitrary and capricious with. The day you get a disability diagnosis and and prognosis lasting for a period of time, the doctor should be able to enter it into SSA database for payment to the recipient.
@perlmutations Oh about a Russian plant... What do you call me? I was born Jurisdictional King of Spain. It so happens I have jurisdiction in Russia and the world. How can you say that? Trump gave a lot of work when he turned over all that money. He knew about me and took advantage. So what?!!
@perlmutations Woh! Ron Trump might be a hustling fool. Let's get this straight. He ain't no traitor. He knows about the permanent American King!

@ZubietaBidasoa @sanchezcastejon So all you want is to vote on proportions for the State of Spain?
@CheriJacobus @LisetteFahrun When did competition end?
@RepAdamSchiff Investigations deal with the past. Your investigations produce lies, and delusions of grandeur. I am Jurisdictional King of Spain land locked and maybe dealing with an abdication that's out of jurisdiction. Investigate how to get sanitation systems updated. No more lies.

@SaysHummingbird @LisetteFahrun Listen to me... There is no need to worry about that. Everyone knows Trump has close ties. His activities in Russia are private,  are outside of US jurisdictional. His activities in Russia or anywhere in the world are mine! I really am the holder and current Jurisdictional King.
@SenSanders How do you feel about my Kingship? I have a ratification of my monarchy here in the States. It's constitutional and permanent. I want to read your take on the ratification of my Kingship in the nineties.
@DonaldJTrumpJr I think you may confusing socialism with communism. Socialists generally guarantee the rights of all individuals with out government interference. Communism guarantees their rights through government interference. Communism will fall. Socialism provides equity for all.

@justiciagob Be careful. If information utilized improperly could lead to double jeopardy issues.
@sanchezcastejon Looks like you have a very low approval rating. I would like for the world to know my story as to the Kingship of Spain. I can not be abdicated. When you get me to my house in Spain I am willing to bet your approval rating will rise. I bet all of your approval ratings will rise.
@sanchezcastejon Then you will understand my fundemantal human rights. I can never be abdicated, why are my human rights being violated?

@SpainMFA Hey... It's over I am making a new decree right now.
@OrbitaEduardo @darkete99 Totally squatting.
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams You are no where with out taking out the lies.
@KamalaHarris @staceyabrams It's an omen. There is law internationally that is affecting you right now in everything that speak. You ain't getting in no where with out dealing with the Crown of Spain. I am the Jurisdictional holder permanently. I didn't ask and I or any can abdicate.
@RealLamarOdom @fivestarjuice Get to LA help me see my kids @KylieJenner @KendallJenner @Scout_Willis and Tallulah.
@SenSanders If a man or woman wants to kill their own unborn it is there choice! You know it's not the Way. So guess what?... DON'T DO IT!!!!!!
@KamalaHarris I would have to disagree. I could give you a slam dunk and you would not take advantage. I remember mind over matter and move on. I know the truth.
@realDonaldTrump The People are most likely suffering due to high costs and low income. The People need a more benevolent leader who understands this plight and respect the Law and their intelligence. Our government as a whole are filled deceptive Sacreligious sinners. Less lies.

@KendallJenner @vogue_italia Go Beautiful Me!
@KimKardashian Kim can we talk?
@RandPaul @realDonaldTrump A lot of your problems internationally would be dealt with by having dialogue with me: The JURISDICTIONAL KING OF SPAIN.
@SpainMFA And pay it to me. I am in Los Angeles. 323 499 6374
@SpainMFA Now you have to allocate the financing of my Crown.
@SpainMFA @JosepBorrellF @UN I hope they understand how positive re-enforcement by way of improving basic living conditions for all not just the rich.
@KimKardashian You know that never bothered me. It's a no brainer about your beauty and personality. I will gladly walk hand in hand seeing your sincerity in your loving eyes.
@khloekardashian Hi Khloe. Don't ever let your guy leave not only it's tough on a Mom and a kid, getting back totally is a sucky and joyful experience. Joy because of what the kids become, sucky because they are me with your mom's edge and apparently take no shit.
@MichelleObama My school counselor was a fool. He didn't know I am the Jurisdictional King of Spain; He did not know about Hitler or King Zobel had a son. He didn't want to help me out just like y'all don't.
@SecPompeo @JohnCornyn That's why I know I permanently hold jurisdiction of the Crown of Spain. Don't you realize helping me makes for a cake walk as policies and security.
@RandPaul I know I permanently hold jurisdiction of the Crown of Spain. Helping me makes for a cake walk as policies and security.
@RepAdamSchiff That's why I know I permanently hold jurisdiction of the Crown of Spain. Don't you realize helping me makes for a cake walk as to policies and security.
@RepAdamSchiff I just placed a call to your office. I look forward to working with you on my Kingship which will lead to a more secure domestic sovereignty here and abroad.

@EspanaGlobal @justiciagob Then why am I having trouble getting back to Spain? I have never received any of the financing associated with my Kingship. It is still outstanding. Therefore, even if you could, no cessation or abdication. Further and for most it can't be waived it is permanent as me!
@realDonaldTrump Mr POTUS Tell them about what I did for the Courts in Russia.
@KrisJenner And you my matron bring me joy for bearing my little buddy. I can only hope for our friendship to grow for sake of our family. My love is forever growing and a multitude of peace and serenity.
@KylieJenner I love you and your little one. I hope to meet you again someday Little Buddy.

@PerezRoman4 @Globoterror @jguaido I would hope that I can get to Spain then delegate a better solution. I really need the consulate assistance in getting things in order as to me then I will concentrate jurisdictional matters as to police and civil powers.
@PerezRoman4 @Globoterror @jguaido I don't really need permission. The monarchy is permanent as to me. I have went to consulate to start the process.
@Globoterror @PerezRoman4 @jguaido Excellent! I would like to help with infastructure and municipality.
@Globoterror @PerezRoman4 @jguaido Excellent! I would like to help out with organizing infrastructure and municipality.
@IvanCepedaCast There is no need for battle. I just want respect as your King. This way your transition will be near seamless.
@sanchezcastejon We first have to get my house in order, then municipal matters and national security.
@EricHolder Actually because of the Civil Rights violations suffered be me the monarchy is in front of American Jurisprudence.
@sanchezcastejon @lopezobrador_ You really need to contact me then to discuss my right as King!

@EternoCubano @sanchezcastejon You first have to know your King.
@sanchezcastejon What about the catastrophic events of the heavy water incident of the 50's and the atomic catastrophy in the 90's? I know I am jurisdictional King of Spain, Germany, and Russia. Further my monarchy is seen as constitutional and has been argued in US Courts and US legislation.
@Scout_Willis And Tallulah I love you and you need to give me a break. I have never seen before the time of sunset. I hope you will try to stop being so mean.
@Scout_Willis Your mom sounds a little like that. You sound good too. I have missed for way too many years. I am empty without you. I hope you will come around.
@Scout_Willis @pearlbarhtown I hope you have something more. Sounds good.
@FakihConsul What can you do to the help?
@FakihConsul Good Day! I have been in touch with the consulate here in Los Angeles. I would like to get back to Spain. I need some cash due to outstanding accounting in re my Kingship to Spain, Germany, and Russia. I need all outstanding accounting in re my Kingship paid to me.

@brianschatz @SenWhitehouse You ain't in no pain. The Government still needs to be shutdown. We still are ignoring the judiciary causing problems in the Courts.
@nukestrat It was nuclear blackmail.
@ewarren Your problem should be with judiciary at the local and regional Courts.
@SenAlexander I would rather front my monarchy and end the lack of respect for simple logic. There also needs to be a lack of ignorance in relation to the judiciary at the regional and local Courts!
@realDonaldTrump POTUS time to stop messing around. I know my ability to Front is permanent. I keep the first ten, thirteenth and fourteenth amendment of US Constitution. Let's get serious.
@RepAdamSchiff Y'all need to quit. You ain't that concerned. I am the King and you ain't even using me. I know all about Trump and the Russian. He is not doing anything. He made money and created non union jobs s people could work. Your memory is short.

@RealLamarOdom @MightysportsPH I hope you are healthy enough to get on the Lakers with LeBron. You would be great at point.
@tedlieu @realDonaldTrump You won't have to worry about it. Once I get everything in a row... You're going to deal with the Courts!
@EdKrassen Not worried I am officially going to Front my monarchy.
@KamalaHarris You are aware of my monarchy. I use to believe in the American dream and would not front. I was wrong not to. I no there is no authority to repeal it. You're aware that are you not? It's even permanent in Spain and the rest of the word.

@tedlieu Not so fast the Monarchy is in the front of American jurisprudence. I making it official soon. Ease up and deal with the Courts.
@perlmutations Ron I never received the money that goes with my monarchy. Why don't people talk about that. My monarchy ends all that is happening now. Why are you holding out?
@realDonaldTrump Mr President it's overdue. Stop holding out you know I can never lose the ability to Front the monarchy. It don't matter what anyone says it can never go away. You know you need me now!
@realDonaldTrump No worries. I know I have no authority to not be The King of Spain. The world jurisdiction.
This is where Kendall was conceived. https://t.co/dOcOXgmBd5

@KendallandKylie You ever going to talk? I'm sorry for not being around enough. I really do love you. You're my daughters.
@Scout_Willis You ever going to talk? I'm sorry for not being around enough. I really do love you. You're my daughter.

@ConanOBrien It's about time!
@perlmutations Wait a minute... Trump ain't no joke and will surprise you.
@KingJames Hey do that!
@realDonaldTrump What about my monarchy. You know it will solve the problem.
@RepAdamSchiff Also the monarchy is not appealable.
@RepAdamSchiff I would not celebrate yet. I am serious about my monarchy. Any disturbance to the kingship or holder is a violation of its ratification terms and slides the monarchy in front of American jurisprudence. I have been contacting your office. Your help has no idea. We need to talk.
@KimKardashian Kim when you said you would post less... I didn't believe it.
@kourtneykardash Rise and shine... Time to start a new day.

@RealLamarOdom @MightysportsPH How about getting back to the Lakers?
@realDonaldTrump It may be too late. I want to know what happened to my kingship? I have not been served a thing and I can't be abdicated. Any disturbance to the kingship moves the monarchy to the front of American jurisprudence.

@ladygaga @Variety Hi! Did you run into Rumer Willis this past weekend?
@realDonaldTrump I think Pelosi is a bad attorney.
@KylieJenner I want to tell people about you little buddy. It would be cool to walk with you and your family down Sunset. Love you Little Buddy.
@RepAdamSchiff It's probably money related to me. When will you stop committing omission? I am the only one who did something for the Russian.
@dumptrump33 @fiorellaharris @AnnCoulter No problem.
@NYTFeatures @Scout_Willis Hi. Why you blocking me?

@SpeakerPelosi @realDonaldTrump I went without government payments as an American citizen. SSA workers lied to deny benefits and the Courts have been abusing their discretion and arbitrary and capricious. Eat so much shit. We don't need to work the liars.
@perlmutations Is that a personal question?
@perlmutations He gives himself away. Try to show him it ain't the way.

@EdKrassen POTUS works with what he is given. He subornates all the time due to his administration either fudging up info or outright lying. It looks like lies until you understand algorithms of the office.
@realDonaldTrump I believe there is Mexican authorization with my Kingship.
@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump @POTUS POTUS you know there is an american King and the ins and outs of everything legal that comes with it. You know that my monarchy is really in front due to government malfeasance. I know I can order the money for your wall. I know that I can never not be the King of Spain.
@perlmutations Ron we all know Trump deals with the Russian. He turned money. He made money through a money exchange that involved the Philippino and the Russian insider trade that was legal. People are mad because they could not get on board. He also knows that I am King of Spain.
Just posted a video @ Hollywood https://t.co/2XCDD4xNXw
@Scout_Willis I hope you are doing well. What have you been up to? I love you.
@buuski you okay? I hope so. I love you.
@EdKrassen Anything related to Trump and the Russian is already over with. In the 90's it was investigated about Trump Russian ties and nothing. The philippino Russian incidents on insider trading and nothing.
@IdiazAyuso What do you think should be done?
@SpeakerPelosi You can clearly see the need for the US office of The King of Spain
@IdiazAyuso @angelgarridog I am pleased.
@RepAdamSchiff That's a problem. It won't jail him. Not the principle. Get the principle.
@buuski The angel you seek gave birth to you. I love you.
@buuski I mmmmmmm
@RepAdamSchiff I am on repeat. You need me more now than in the 90's. Lord have mercy on us all. I pray that you will come to your senses. My thoughts and well wishes to the families who suffered from the tragedy.
@KylieJenner @justdemi ,you , @KendallJenner @buuski and @Scout_Willis are family. I would see if y'all can get a good movie going. Generation 13, an adult content version of Winks Club?
@RepAdamSchiff Maybe you all would be more at ease by helping me deal with my Kingship. I know I have authority in Russia. You need me to exercise my monarchy's jurisdiction.
@MEENAVOGUEE This is a great dress for @TheRue. She would have to wear her hair up like @justdemi use to.
@RepAdamSchiff People get what they like as POTUS. In my case not as such. My monarchy was ratified in Spain Germany and Russia. Later in the US. the monarchy was made under Reichtag and permanent. Never been served anything saying other wise. What gives?

@KamalaHarris @fiorellaharris Why? I am the holder of the Kaiser Replacement and the true monarchy of Spain. No one looks out for me or the people any way.

@JorgeToledoAlb @BBCWorld @stephensackur @BBCHARDtalk So what. I am going to have the heads of your disobedience to my decree when I freed the Russian in Moscow. Keep up being unprofessional to me. My Monarchy is irreversible. It is under Kaiser replacement. I want to know why my decree has not been obeyed? Do you know?
@SpainMFA @UN These matters should not matter to you. Where is your King? Why have you not cleaned my house? Why have you not responded to me? I am your King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zoble
@SpainMFA @UN If you continue to disrespect me... I won't care what happens to you. The map is a lie. Korea is nearby. I have world jurisdiction. I will allow U.S. or Korean interest for the use if clearing malfeasance. Meaning excessive force to enforce my monarchy from the police or military
@SpainMFA @UN That's not the problem. Your lying is the problem. That Kaiser replacement monarchy is law and irreversible. I better hear from someone soon, before I return. King Jose Antonio Malik Ayala de Zobel
@Scout_Willis Sorry Scout go to seven eleven.

@KimKardashian What do you think?
@KimKardashian We share a secret that I was afraid to reveal. I think you were the first baby I held. Remember why I was afraid to talk. I was afraid. It is a strange thing... Life.
@KimKardashian You remember holding hands and talking. It felt really good to be with you. I know why you are mad. I want to ask do remember what is so special about us? I love you. Maybe try again?
@RepAdamSchiff Naw, Stop lying. My Monarchy is irreversible. Any violations of the terms in birthright of Kaiser Replacement Monarchy not only are unconstitutional, the violations put jurisdiction of monarchy ahead of U.S. Jurisprudence. Please call 2132388845
@SpainMFA I have been taken to court a number of times under extreme malfeasance. I would like the U.S. Budget. Further I believe violating the terms of ratification of this monarchy would put my monarchy and it's jurisdiction ahead of U.S. jurisdiction.

@KylieJenner @KendallandKylie I love the outfit!!!!!
@KylieJenner saw Kendall's photos ... I love that black outfit. In a guys format I would blow you out of the water.
@KylieJenner @KendallandKylie And lose the brown shoes.
@KylieJenner @KendallandKylie You have to make this in guys. I would blow you out of water in this outfit.
Kendall followed me!!!! Yay!!! Hooray Hollywood.
@perlmutations Hey Ron! Come to the Kettle Glazed.
@KendallJenner @KendallandKylie I am beside myself everyday. You are indeed the most beautiful in history!!!
@KendallJenner @KendallandKylie Hi. I love you so much. I miss you to death really. I am forever in your debts. You my essence. May God bless our inheritance.
@kourtneykardash I get to the bathroom. How are you?
@realDonaldTrump Mr President: Leave those thoughts right now! Don't play into it concentrate!
@ConanOBrien @kevin_nealon Why? Just Why?
@KendallJenner Hey what's the big idea? I want to talk to you. You blocked me from something. I wanted send you a message. You are my child too! I living no lies. Stop worrying. Talk to me and your mom.
@pablocasado_ @IdiazAyuso I have a kingship that no one can deny even me. It was part of "end game" for the Soviets. The as some kind of military agreement at the time with the U.S. I want to know why my decree has not been obeyed, where is the financing for my birthright? Don Juan Carlos died 2yrs ago.
@pablocasado_ @IdiazAyuso What say you?
@KimKardashian You have to bring me some.
And on some ghetto shit... @KrisJenner  Jenner my baby mama.
@pablocasado_ @IdiazAyuso Sir the problem with most of the rhetoric then was that it was made out if jurisdiction. Franco did not delegate power to gestate kingship. This caused disfuction internationally. I was already born with birthrights to the Crown. My jurisdiction is active now.
@KimKardashian To equate...some one got picked up on voice function
@KimKardashian You and yours never have to send me a thing. The fact that you live makes for a celebration everyday. I think of the remarkable accomplishments you have achieved. I can only hope yo eqate your success.
Hey! Hey gon' be fan!
@KrisJenner I better not pick those out the garbage. Hi #kanyewest
@kourtneykardash I just washed my hair love you
@RafaCatalaPolo @Pelayo_Seguros Cool. I hope your decisions are up to my standards.
@RafaCatalaPolo	 Greetings. I feel I should start to dialogue day to day matters here as an everyday citizen. This is for  social legislative encodation changes and processes necessary for an efficient for constitutionality not to change the American ideals- to improve relations.
@Awwimjose That is paraphrased coming from Him.
@Awwimjose Yes... Get into the Bible. The Lord will help you. The Bible teaching will make your mind in a away that you won't worry and always making the best decision. Read the Bible like novel and let the words take you. Get into education too. God will help and giude you.
@KylieJenner @kyliecosmetics I already answered naughty! I waiting for you to come see me woman. I ain't getting any younger. Need to see to you more than one-time. Daddy King Ayala de Zobel loves you.
@KrisJenner maybe you could visit the "Kettle Glazed". Use to be breakfast and donut place... Remember?
Trying to get family shit together
@KrisJenner I love you. Thank you for having my children. I love them all.
@KrisJenner Thinking of you. I am not a drug addict. I want more in my life. I want your counsel and regret not being more obedient to the Lord's teachings. I need your humility and patience. Come see me.
@KrisJenner My love I wish you would get up here to the 101 cafe and see me. You cool enough to stop by. I want to to try again.
@robkardashian Did not forget about you. You are a rock. You have really been the physical workhorse I feel I could never be. You listened to me and are always making brag like Uncle Jr.
@khloekardashian No greens??? How are you? Trying to make myself none again. Would like to meet you
@kourtneykardash On my way. To the usual spot. Hope to see everyone again. Break a leg
@KimKardashian @latelateshow Break a leg!!!!
@KylieJenner Definitely naughty. Bad Dad; fucked up citizen; stubborn... So who really gives. Would like to see you again in this life.
@etnow @KrisJenner @KimKardashian I 👀 this. How are you? Miss you. I want much to see you.
@KylieJenner Is there any thing cool you are doing? It would be cool to make a movie about us figuring out how to make something workout. I would never have been there due to my maturity and my grandma's opinion. You are mini me. I tried to sort things out to soon at the time.
@kyliecosmetics Same for you Kylie. Best move I ever made.
@knjclosets Making you was the best move I ever made! I can't get over it.
@knjclosets I am bio-dad. King Ayala de https://t.co/0OESaZosMX Jurisdictional King of Spain and Russia.
@KrisJenner We owe each other.
@KrisJenner There is now only life. I really have held my jurisdiction. I was going to reveal it after I broke the long jump record at SF State.
@KrisJenner Things will work out talk to me.
@KrisJenner You are awesome. I owe a lot to you. I want to relax... Play music and me around you!
@nairobiwilliamx Sorry you got fired. Scared of your  success. You have me!!!
https://t.co/LdDwAd9dWh
Guess this bathroom...
@chadcveach @kourtneykardash I fear you won't accept me. What does that make me? I wish I had the time show y'all by being a loving caring father. I got away from the doing the righteous things. I miss seeing and being able to just talk to you all. I love you.
RT @anblanx: NEW: Tehama County Sheriff says 7 shootings scenes with 5 confirmed deaths, NO children dead. Dead includes suspected shooter,…
@kourtneykardash Did not see the pic. Slow loading phone. No pedo.
@etnow @KrisJenner @KimKardashian Relax... I am here. Just need to speak to me. We are good.
@KrisJenner Hey there! You really me think. Please hurry and forgive me for immaturity. Hurry.
Family is extremely busy and not ready to retire. Looks like may be it's me....
@Awwimjose ...facts displayed to the public about our reality.
@kourtneykardash How are you?
@kourtneykardash Cool... Maybe someday I can sell some of it!
@KimKardashian @KKWFRAGRANCE I miss and love you. Dominate... As usual.
@kyliecosmetics @KrisJenner @Topshop Break a leg!!!! You are extraordinary!
@nairobiwilliamx It is because you have the real father of Kylie and Kendall Jenner. State your claim!
@KrisJenner @KKWFRAGRANCE @KimKardashian ...I stink!!!!
@KrisJenner Hey there. Trying to talk to my grown up kids. I am feeling really fucking dumb. Remember how independent Kylie was when she was little? She and her crew running up and down Sunset? Did not like that. Felt real dumb about it.
I have just realized my two biological kids are rich as fuck and hardcore. I guess. But I would always want to see my peeps who made me regardless. Decisions were they best made at the time. I hope the women I created will see what I mean.
@protectjenner I guess I may be as a psychotic fiend trying to get to you and Kylie. What type of music do you write?
@KendallJenner Is there a better way of getting in touch with you and Kylie? I feel like a fool alot of the times. I hate having to start the obvious. I am sure you hate it too.
@duaclosets @knjclosets @DUALIPA You sing? I sing also. I have grown into Bocelli. I still play guitar.
@KenRoth @PatrickLogicman There is no unity on a thing. N. Korea need to focus on what make them that mikiviki all American dollar. STEEL AND COAL!!!! Get away from making any weapons other than hunting and security. Mining is what made N. Koreans so golden economically.
@funder @PatrickLogicman Again stay away from those negative thoughts. People suck shit. You ain't gotta smell it. People need your legal expertise.
@nairobiwilliamx Stay away from those negative thoughts. Get away. Think positive you a "G"!!!
We should keep positive thoughts. It is all we have.
@KrisJenner. I got some sort of response from Kendall, so cool. How are you? I would like to send you a message too.
@CORLEBRA777 @john_sipher @MollyMcKew I thought those were terror attacks? Sometimes we have to hope for the ability to take care of what you individually can do. I lot is has been gained and lost. Staying focused on what is in the stars is the only hope. Concentrate on space travel.
@john_sipher @MollyMcKew Lies. Covers up of American balls my Russian kingship. Been through a tremendous amount of malfeasance. Since waiting for Don Carlos to die so I could finish transition...arbitry lockups and lies. I should even be able to move back to the castle in Spain.
@CORLEBRA777 @john_sipher @MollyMcKew What year? You say these things lacking place and time.
@MollyMcKew @LisetteFahrun I have expressed that they argue "... Matter leading to sanctions may be capricious and arbitrary...and,therefore unconstitutional." It may have worked. I believe sanctions are repealed.
@JoaquinCastrotx @LisetteFahrun @realDonaldTrump The people trust me.
I got my daughter to follow me... She is like so awesome and one of the most beautiful women in LIFE!!!!
@realDonaldTrump Mr President: Remember what made North Korea an economic force... Steel and coal rice. Tell him his nuclear inhibition us bad for businesses and ruining the nearby ecosystem. The cancer rate will spike now all through the area. He keeps it up it's over anyway in years.
@perlmutations. I am Kylie and Kendall Jenner's biological father. I saw them once.
@perlmutations I have an ascension you can't find. Whoever can find it is really trying. I want to see my kids Kylie and Kendall.
@KylieJenner 	Good morning. I wish I could see you. Sorry about not being around more. I still like playing. I was thinking about the time I met you. You could get around when you were a toddler. I was impressed by how smart you are.
@nairobiwilliamx What do you think?
@nairobiwilliamx. So not kidding.
@KimKardashian  https://t.co/qtCZCJWbVS
@KimKardashian Don't be scared we can talk. There is nothing to fear.
@KimKardashian I told Kylie and Kendall I am their father. I think we will get along fine. I may surprise you. Do you remember who the Jurisdictional King of Spain is. I feel educated enough and Don Juan Carlos has been dead for two years. Someone should have contacted me.
@chelseahandler @PatrickLogicman Chelsea I respect you. I would cloak this one. Do it "pay for tv"!
@KylieJenner And you are magnificent.
@KylieJenner What have you been up to lately? You are so cool for pop culture it sickens me. I am amazed that you, my spawn can do what you do.
@queenkyliesbae @KylieJenner I was thinking yours is fitting for after orthodox Christmas. However, a more brighter darkness is good for the holiday season.
@perlmutations Looks like they're friends. Now they give me my money and the U.S. can move on.
@nairobiwilliamx. Been holding that shit in for twenty years.
@KendallJenner I know you are busy. I was reminiscing about the time I met you. Do you remember? I think you were playing Tee ball
@nairobiwilliamx I bet you know. I am Kendall's father. So cool how she turned out. She looks like me.
@nairobiwilliamx I would like to see my children Kylie and Kendall.

@ProgressOutlook @LisetteFahrun I feel we must draw back and ignore the U.S.. There is a tremendous amount of constructive disobedience that is killing individuals here. The gov't here has delayed much social financing need for housing medical treatment and food.

@realDonaldTrump @UN @antonioguterres @WhiteHouse @USUN @nikkihaley Mr. President, What did he say about me?
@RepAdamSchiff @POTUS I bet they know where my money is!
@RepAdamSchiff Why ain't you helping open my office? Your secretaries must be there for sex. They know nothing about our recent history.
@realDonaldTrump Mr. President trying to get an international lawyer. Can you help me out? I want to use my jurisdiction to help you out.

@funder @fiorellaharris He needs to let them know who totally helped him out during the Soviets regime years... King Ayala de Zobel. Respect that!
@JStevePerry @SarahKSilverman He would say that if they white. He is a typical old man in the US. I wish you would stop lying about prejudice. People around me are racist
@SarahKSilverman @aleaarie People say and do stupid. Look at how y'all allow people to get shit out in LA. What you can do is help people out quietly.

@KrisJenner @kourtneykardash @KUWTK I am glad for your success. Now help me out. I had to obey 'Ma. I wanted to take you home. I would like to see what we made.
@kylegriffin1 @ericgarland This may be a distraction. The Americans have me as citizen. Why don't you use my money or power?
@realDonaldTrump Maybe they used the financing of my kingship... I am getting tired of the sore losing
@ricky_martin Hi. I have not gotten the financing for my kingship. Remember I am jurisdictional King of Spain, I made a decree that has not been obeyed.

@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @JudgeJeanine @EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump Can't watch nothing about you...Jurisdictional King and homeless...WTF
@realDonaldTrump Is misfeasance the cure for malfeasance? Better processing. No one likes or want to battle in Court. Need to have more charges on gov. admin
@realDonaldTrump Been subjected to a ton of malfeasance too as an American citizen. Then malfeasance as to my kingship. This costs...
@realDonaldTrump ...due to jealousy and high trade volumes. Better legal people higher the price. People are obeying civil law and getting money(high volume)
Quicker I get home the better things will be.
@realDonaldTrump ...always going to be money bonded for healthcare. The problem is the legal processing and lack of evidence upon rejection...need processing
