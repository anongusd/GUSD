These women are leading the charge against the Trump administration's continued attacks on health care, equal wages, and reproductive rights, and I am proud to stand with them in the fight for justice and equality.
There's a lot to celebrate this #WomensHistoryMonth. With a record number of women now serving in Congress, millions of women volunteering and organizing, and the gavel back in Speaker @TeamPelosi's hand, Democratic women have made historic achievements this past year.

And he did it again today in Hanoi. This is a disgrace to our democracy and an insult to all who value liberty.
While in office, Donald Trump has repeatedly sided with authoritarian leaders, defending their human rights abuses and rejecting U.S. intelligence.
Putin meddled in our election. Trump defended him. MBS murdered a journalist. Trump defended him. Kim murdered an American student. Trump defended him. 		Is there any authoritarian leader Trump won't defend?

This isn’t leadership, it’s chaos. https://t.co/5xkZnuwP06
The national emergency is coming from inside the White House. And where is Donald Trump? He’s in Palm Beach working on his backswing.
This is a moral reckoning as much as anything. My faith teaches me that that which we do unto the least of us, we do unto all of us. That’s a universal value — but it’s a universal value that’s on the chopping block.
And frankly, we’re facing a national emergency when it comes to our values — I don’t understand how “compassion” became a four-letter word. “Immigrants” became a four-letter word. “Inclusion” became a 4-letter word. “Muslim” became a 4-letter word.
Too many Americans are living paycheck to paycheck. That’s a national emergency.		Americans are carrying *1.5 trillion dollars* in student debt. That’s a national emergency.
400 years after the arrival of slavery, we still have a national emergency — even after Charlottesville, we still have a president who can’t call racism racism. America has 5% of the world’s population and 25% of the prison population. That’s a national emergency.
There’s a national emergency on health care. If you can’t afford your insulin, that’s a family emergency, a community emergency, and a national emergency.
Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Thursday. You want to know where there’s a national emergency? We have a national emergency of gun violence. We have a national emergency on climate. We have a national emergency on voter suppression.

Women — especially women of color — made history. They are and always have been leading the way. I’m proud that the Democratic Party will continue to stand in solidarity with women fighting for equality. https://t.co/EKfrJUM74i
We did this together, folks. We organized everywhere. We competed everywhere. And we will continue fighting to elect Democrats who embody our values from the school board to the Oval Office. https://t.co/c0BC0iQjUy
Yesterday, voters made clear that they won’t accept Donald Trump’s corrupt disregard for the rule of law. Make no mistake: The president will be held accountable for any interference in the special counsel’s investigation.
Whitaker is not an independent law enforcement official, and he's been openly and publicly hostile toward the special counsel’s investigation. Put simply, this move doesn’t pass the smell test.
Trump's attempt to undermine the Mueller investigation with the hiring of Matthew Whitaker as Acting Attorney General is a gross abuse of power and extremely dangerous to the rule of law. https://t.co/Hy4qpMghib
None of last night’s progress would've been possible without the courage of the countless LGBTQ organizers and activists who worked tirelessly to move us forward. Congratulations to my friend @PolisforCO — the first openly gay governor elected in America. https://t.co/DAzMoGv9gX
Democrats put hope on the ballot. I’m incredibly proud &amp; thankful for the work that our state parties, organizers, &amp; volunteers put in to deliver last night's results. We owe these wins to you &amp; to everyone who went to the polls to make their voices heard. Let's keep fighting.
The people of Wisconsin have voted to end the era of Scott Walker — congratulations to @Tony4WI and @TheOtherMandela on their big win in Wisconsin! Thank you to our union brothers and sisters for relentlessly fighting and organizing for a better Wisconsin.
Congrats to @Lina4HC, who just defeated a 10-year incumbent in Harris County, Texas to become the first woman and first Latina Harris County Judge!
Tonight was a win for @TheDemocrats and for democracy. We won the House because our candidates had a clear message for working families. Now it’s time to get to work restoring sanity to our government, holding Trump accountable &amp; working to build a better future for our country.
North Carolinians have voted in favor of a fairer future — congratulations to @earls4justice on her win on the NC Supreme Court and the @ncdp on breaking the GOP supermajority!

Democrats are doing all we can to make sure that every eligible voter can exercise their constitutional right at the ballot box. That’s why we’re encouraging all states to offer same-day voter registration so Democrats can vote in their state's primaries.
For states with caucuses, our reforms recommend that those states take steps to make their caucuses as accessible as possible, including offering absentee voting and implementing better processes for tracking ballots in case a recount is needed.
Our democracy works best when more people can participate. So, to make the presidential nominating process more inclusive, transparent, &amp; accessible the DNC voted to expand the use of primaries so that more people could participate in the process.
We voted today to return power to the grassroots of our party by reducing the role superdelegates have in the Democratic presidential nominating process, respecting the will of voters.
Our North Star from the beginning of this process has been to grow our party, unite our party, and earn voters' trust. That’s why we passed the strongest reforms to our party in decades, and I wanted to share some of the highlights of this historic vote. 👇
Today is a historic day for our party. We reaffirmed one of our core beliefs as Democrats: That our democracy works best when every voice is heard. The new DNC is doing things differently. https://t.co/MIMpS5Clx8

DREAMers like Gabriela are American in every way but on paper. We owe it to her and nearly 800,000 other DREAMers to pass the DREAM Act. https://t.co/e8EpXXnrP9
We won't rest until we've voted out every single Republican who voted for this disaster of a tax plan. Who's ready? https://t.co/auYcVuiL1X
Happy New Year, Democrats. Looking ahead to 2018, let's work together to turn this great country blue.
This was a big year for Democrats. We won big elections from Virginia to Alabama to New Hampshire to Oklahoma, and we’re just getting started. Thank you, from all of us here at the DNC.
2018 is almost here, Democrats and we know what we have to do — it's time to roll up our sleeves, get organizing, and get Democrats elected across this great nation. Join us: https://t.co/IxCJ4Hx88r

¡Feliz navidad y próspero año para todos!
To all those celebrating today, Merry Christmas from my family to yours. https://t.co/6NxziByYpY
No matter if your family is blood or chosen, Merry Christmas Eve to you and yours from me and mine.
This holiday season and through 2018, we're putting our money where our mouths are and giving back with service projects throughout our communities as part of our #DemsForYou service initiatives. I hope you'll join us. https://t.co/lDHTPSmbB3
Bravo, @TeamKCP. The DNC is committed to protecting and expanding every American's right to vote. https://t.co/IDl2Xjtglg
Millions of families are living in fear this holiday season because this Republican Congress refuses to give CHIP a long term extension or provide hardworking DREAMers with relief. Enough is enough.
Nothing says "Merry Christmas" like the GOP refusing to fund health insurance for 9 million kids. Is that what Donald Trump meant when he said "Christmas is back?" https://t.co/bLfr8XJWnF

The GOP sold out regular Americans by passing their #TrumpTax today, and the only things they're going to get from it are to ship American jobs overseas and line the pockets of people like Donald Trump. https://t.co/8Wam9sXIiG
The Senate GOP just sold out our families, our home mortgages, our health care, and our children's education to give kickbacks to their rich donors. Republicans, know this: we're coming for you in 2018.
Every single vote counts and don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise. https://t.co/QMVuN9sJg5
Republicans in the House just voted to pass the #GOPTaxScam and take away tax breaks for the middle class in order to give them to corporations and the wealthiest 1%. We won't stop fighting this — today, tomorrow, or on Election Day.

Devastating news in Washington. I send my thoughts to all those affected by the derailment this morning and my thanks to the first responders working to assist travelers and move them to safety.

Instead of reauthorizing CHIP, which provides health care for 150,000 Alabama kids, the GOP is working to cut the estate tax for the richest 40 families in Alabama. Don't ever lie and tell me you care about “family values” again, Republicans. https://t.co/FMBfEmH0hb
It's been 5 years since innocent children and their teachers lost their lives at #SandyHook. We've done nothing to keep it from happening again. Our kids deserve better.

@KaylieEHanson We need to elect more Democrats to institute more options for single parents, like no-excuse absentee and early voting and vote by mail.
@IrfanSabrina @TerryMcAuliffe The @FlaDems are working to get petition signatures and you can help them get there https://t.co/lW8nIM5PoT
@IrfanSabrina Democrats believe everyone should vote — that includes those who’ve paid their debts. We need to elect more Dems govs like @TerryMcAuliffe.
@IrfanSabrina @DNC We want to hear where the lines are long and where people are being turned away so we can make sure it stops happening.
@IrfanSabrina 1/ Agree. We have a plan for this. The @DNC is working with state parties to create grassroots voter protection councils to tackle this.
@KathySilke @AmyP5280 Step 2: We’ve got to fight back at every level. As the chair of the DNC, I encourage you to get involved by calling your state party.
@TedJacksonCA We must fight for more options to vote by mail, get assistance, &amp; expand hours so those w/ disabilities can vote when they're most able.
@AmyP5280 Step 1: Education. Talk with your friends and family, help them register and make sure they have a plan to vote.
@vgliatti Voter suppression is a staple of the GOP playbook at every level. We need to win back seats in state houses &amp; Congress to turn the tide.
@janeadamsid Automatic voter registration is great. States like RI, CO &amp; more are headed in the right direction &amp; we need more states to join them.
I saw so many great questions about voting on yesterday's VRA anniversary. I've got some time now — ask me your questions.

Bottom line: Karen Handel and Donald Trump are the same — all talk, bad action. Georgians deserve Jon Ossoff: https://t.co/W79udy907C
Like Trump, Handel wants to make it harder to vote. At DOJ, we fought her efforts as GA Secretary of State to restrict voting rights.
Like Trump, Handel believes the awful GOP health care bills were “on the right track.” Bad news for Georgians with a pre-existing condition.
Trump &amp; Handel both like to sabotage access to health care—whether it's funding the ACA or Handel cutting off funding to PP while at Komen.
Both Trump and Karen Handel have made it a pet project to attack Planned Parenthood and restrict women’s LEGAL access to abortion.
Today, @Ossoff’s opponent Karen Handel is stumping with Donald Trump — which makes complete sense. They’re 2 peas in a pod.

I was proud to give the Weekly Democratic Address this week. We hear you, we're fighting for you, and we won't back down. https://t.co/70Wmw3ICyB
Thank you, @DanMalloyCT, for your tireless work for the people. Connecticut is a better place because of everything you've done.

The events from this week reinforce that we must open our doors to refugees—many of them children—fleeing violence in Syria.
This is the time for America to lead. Not only because it makes us safer—which it does—but because it’s about our character as a nation.
We must pursue all avenues to solve this humanitarian crisis, including diplomacy.
In America, we don’t turn away those who need us. We don’t capitulate to dictators because it improves Trump’s relationship with Putin.
He wants to turn away refugees, those who most need our help — including children, who he's compared to terrorists. https://t.co/aBaSdWxgNS
Trump has signaled that he’s considering taking action against Assad. But for years he’s said we should "stay the hell out of Syria." https://t.co/DaeOuspVVj
The fact that Trump’s position on this is continually changing is bad for our national security and bad for the people of Syria.
Assad has been globally condemned. We can't allow the suffering of Syria's people to take a backseat to politics. https://t.co/8RAUIAItM4
The Syrian people have been gassed, terrorized, &amp; massacred. These aren’t the actions of someone we want as an ally: https://t.co/i7qIRMlDLY
What Bashar al-Assad is doing to the Syrian people is indescribable and unacceptable. These are war crimes.
Excited to talk to @GinaForRI and RI College Dems today about the critical issue of affordable and accessible higher education. https://t.co/ar9zoE1dXl
Even worse, Republicans have rigged Senate rules to install Trump’s nominee. Americans will not forget today when they vote in 2017 &amp; 2018.
Republicans stole this seat on SCOTUS. We cannot trust Gorsuch to deliver equal justice for all Americans.
On #EqualPayDay, we must remember that inequality for women means inequality for everyone. We won’t stop fighting to close the wage gap.
We've won some big fights in the first three months of this year because we stood together. I'm counting on you to keep fighting.
The American people already rejected the repeal of the ACA, but Trump is trying again. And just like last time, Americans will reject it.
Shameful. The Trump administration is taking us backwards again &amp; putting lives at risk. https://t.co/6PlsvbjPbw
Thank you, @BernieSanders, for your continued leadership to make sure college is accessible and affordable for all Americans.
Sorry not sorry. https://t.co/PPyuzAwbpq
Gorsuch isn’t qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. Republicans can’t fix Gorsuch by changing the rules- they need to change the nominee.

I'll discuss Trump and the GOP’s threat to working families with @KeithEllison and @ElizabethforMA tonight on #DemocratsLive at 8:00 p.m. https://t.co/zk30f2ct0y
With this nominee, we need to afford @realDonaldTrump the same courtesy Mitch McConnell afforded Barack Obama – no courtesy at all.
A qualified judge would protect LGBTQ rights, voting rights, women’s rights, the diversity that makes our country great. That's not Gorsuch.
They’re the decisions of a man put in place by a president who doesn’t give a damn about the Constitution.
These aren’t the decisions of someone who is qualified to serve a lifetime appointment to our nation’s highest court.
When a company fired a truck driver for abandoning his trailer to avoid freezing to death, Gorsuch sided with the company, not the worker.
Gorsuch has argued that corporations are people and suggested rich people should be able to make unlimited campaign contributions.
Judges appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike have already deemed a religious test unconstitutional. But that's not all:
“Do you agree with me that there should not be a religious test in the United States?” This is not a gotcha question.
Take the Muslim ban for example. Gorsuch ducked and dodged the most basic question:
We’ve watched as Donald Trump assaults the Constitution on a daily basis &amp; his nominee has convinced no one he would check Trump's behavior.
The Senate should hold off on any action on this lifetime appointment until the FBI investigation into Trump's Russia connections concludes.
First, it’s entirely unacceptable for Donald Trump to place a justice on SCOTUS with his presidency under the cloud of an FBI investigation.
A few thoughts after watching Gorsuch’s hearing so far:
Trump campaigned on a mountain of populist promises. He keeps breaking them. Democrats will fight Trump’s budget tooth-and-nail.
This administration is a billionaire boys club of Goldman Sachs bankers who are cutting programs that will devastate hardworking families.
Budgets are moral documents. Donald Trump’s shows that he doesn’t value what makes America truly great – American workers.
As my friend @JoeBiden says, “Don't tell me what you value, show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.”
Inspired by my conversation w/ @bobblanddesign and the work of all the organizers of the @womensmarch. Thank you for having me, @WNDC_1922. https://t.co/qIQwVae3HO
52 years later, Democrats are still fighting to protect our most fundamental right. https://t.co/jPW4vLGPyK
This is a huge victory for the Constitution. The United States of America does not discriminate based on religion. Period.
I’ll be in Michigan next week with @KeithEllison to hear how we can better work together to protect health care &amp; rebuild the local economy.
637,000 Michiganders qualified for coverage under Medicaid expansion, but many of them will lose their coverage if Trumpcare passes.
During the campaign, Trump promised Michiganders “less expensive, but better” health care. His disastrous plan breaks that promise.
Thrilled to have such a talented and diverse group of leaders to help right the ship and lead the @DNC transition: https://t.co/XKzXS1juKs
Note to GOP Senators: this is what a brilliant Supreme Court Justice looks like. Happy birthday, Justice Ginsburg. #NotoriousRBG https://t.co/kkjlKOmWFk
I'm sure Trump would prefer to talk about tax returns and not the millions who will lose their health insurance under his plan.
So WH "strenuously disagreed" w/ the CBO...because their own analysis shows GOP plan screws over even more Americans https://t.co/z1zNMY9QC6
Paul Ryan is calling the decimation of Medicaid a tax cut. People will die if the GOP passes this bill. https://t.co/MP1TEq93bF
The GOP is betting the American people aren't paying attention -- Democrats are not going to let them get away with it. https://t.co/3XCibjrjXl
In Steve King’s eyes, all are not equal. This is the definition of bigotry and it has no place in our country. He must resign. https://t.co/9gkRCtyWKw
I promise that @TheDemocrats will be at the forefront of the fight to protect all voters from voter suppression and gerrymandering.
We’re building a robust voter protection program at the DNC to fight back against Republican attempts to limit access to the ballot box.
With Jeff Sessions as the Attorney General, we’ll all have to work even harder to defend the right to vote.
The court confirmed what we've known all along: Texas intentionally discriminated to disenfranchise Latino and African American voters. https://t.co/8j2i9hqQEv
Some mess you inherited, eh @realDonaldTrump? #ThanksObama #JobsReport https://t.co/AMvh1YkaqP
Standing in solidarity w/ #NativeNationsRise. We must protect tribal sovereignty and our earth for future generations.
Democrats will keep fighting Trump and the GOP tooth and nail so all Americans benefit from our economy - not just billionaires like Trump.
Trump's policies will take 8 years of Democratic gains away from working families to benefit his wealthy friends.
Trump has as much to do with job growth since January 20 as he does with the Wizards’ winning record since then: Absolutely nothing. https://t.co/ybRXGH4dt4
Equal work should mean equal pay. Thrilled @ricardorossello has signed equal pay legislation for Puerto Rico on #InternationalWomensDay. https://t.co/U6YFsPoQx4
Today on #InternationalWomensDay and every day, Democrats proudly stand in solidarity with women fighting for progress and true equality.
We will not back down when it comes to fighting Donald Trump and the GOP as they try to ignore women or turn back the clock.
Women make up nearly half our workforce and contribute $7.6 trillion to our GDP each year - we need to fight for policies to support them.
Our friends at @amprog found if every working woman were able to strike today, we would lose around $21 billion in gross domestic product.
You don't need to have worked at the Department of Labor like I did to know that our economy - and our country - doesn't work without women.
I normally prefer Democratic blue, but today we’ll be wearing red in solidarity with millions of women participating in a #DayWithoutAWoman

These actions put Americans in danger. We need the truth now on how this White House is working hand in hand with Vladimir Putin.
And the cover up goes deeper. Those who lied about Trump team’s Russian ties include the VP, chief of staff, AG, and the President himself.
This now makes at least two members of Trump’s admin who have talked to the Russians before the elections and lied about it.
Jeff Sessions is 100% unfit to oversee investigation and DOJ. They must appoint a special prosecutor to preserve integrity of investigation.
Moreover, the AG had weeks to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian-Trump ties. We’re now well beyond the point of recusal.
Sessions claims he doesn’t remember what he discussed with Russians—after he lied about talking with them.
No spin from Trump admin can hide the fact that Sessions lied under oath and committed perjury about Russian ties. Sessions must resign.
Bottom line: Trump's #JointAddress was Steve Bannon on steroids with a smile.

From Georgia to Utah, we are going to fight back and put our values into action. That's how we win. And that's why I'm running for this job.
Democrats believe health care is a right, not a privilege. And when you deny healthcare to anyone, you deny it to everyone.
Democrats believe that when the criminal justice system doesn’t work for African Americans and Latinos, it doesn’t work for anyone.
Democrats believe that when the water in Flint is polluted, the water everywhere is polluted.
Our Democratic Party embodies the inescapable web of mutuality that binds us as Americans. It embodies the value of opportunity.

Diversity is being invited to the dance. Inclusion is being asked to dance. If I am your next DNC chair, everyone will be fully engaged /4
@deray If I am elected, the DNC will always reflect the diversity of America. And diversity is not enough—inclusion matters too. /3
