@JonahCrane Here’s what FEMA told insurers yesterday. https://t.co/uiGhNI77eY
FEMA in new statement says it's reviewing legal authorities to allow flood insurance program to keep operating. Problem with issuing new policies arose because of a fee it pays insurers to sell flood insurance
@JonahCrane FEMA was able to issue policies during the 2013 shutdown, which I think threw off some people this time around.
Cassidy, Pascrell and Pallone sent letters to FEMA today arguing that it has the power under the Antideficiency Act to keep selling flood insurance policies to avoid economic disruption. They also pointed out that the flood insurance program gets funding from premiums and fees

Scalise, Waters and Kennedy are pressuring the administration to reverse FEMA's sudden decision to stop selling new flood insurance policies during the shutdown. Kennedy says it will "cause upheaval for home buyers and sellers across the country"
FEMA decision to curtail new flood insurance policies during shutdown isn't helping its relationship w/Congress. Hill caught off guard after lawmakers passed legislation intended to keep flood insurance program operational. Doesn't appear FEMA warned Congress before bill enacted
FEMA’s decision to wait until Wednesday to announce that new flood insurance policies are disallowed during shutdown means those sold since Saturday are in limbo. FEMA told insurers it will need to “adjudicate" the status of those contracts
The National Flood Insurance Program kept issuing new policies during the 2013 government shutdown. What’s different? “In 2013, the NFIP had an appropriation that did not lapse,” FEMA says. “This time, the appropriation for the NFIP has lapsed.”
FEMA made surprise announcement that insurers can’t sell new flood insurance policies from the National Flood Insurance Program during the shutdown, despite Trump signing bill Friday to keep the program going. Realtors say tens of thousands of home sales in jeopardy
FEMA just notified insurers that the National Flood Insurance Program can't issue new policies during govt shutdown. Surprising many who thought NFIP reauthorization enacted last week averted this. Trades calling it "rebuke of the clear intent of Congress and the president"
Soon-to-be Chairwoman Waters: “The recent actions of the President and the Treasury Secretary ... have been erratic and are creating uncertainty and instability in the markets. It would be in our nation’s best interest if they stopped what they are doing.”

The Senate passed the changes to the flood insurance extension and now all that's needed is Trump's signature

@peteschroeder @rortybomb Right. Powell, Crapo, Warner, etc, say the Fed looks at total global assets and that this bill wouldn’t change that. But as Pete points out, the complaint is that the Fed would be pressured to ease up on the foreign banks once the U.S.-based banks get out of regs
I'll get threading right next time!
Finally, I didn’t read through the substitute and see it as a slam dunk for House Republicans, though several House-approved bills have been incorporated into it and the base text.
Another significant item from @SenatorTimScott is a loss for FICO and a win for its competitor VantageScore. It would order FHFA to come up with a process by which Fannie and Freddie could use alternative credit score models for mortgages.
More deregulation, including a bill that would ease bank capital requirements for commercial real estate loans. Also, several bills that would scale back securities regulations.
It was the first time they released the text of the Carper-Coons provision that would require credit bureaus to give free credit monitoring to military members. They relented to pressure from conservatives and the companies and included a restriction on class-action lawsuits.
A bunch of consumer protections were added for members of the military and student loan borrowers.
Responding to another complaint, the amendment would restrict banks from taking advantage of a mortgage reporting exemption under HMDA if they receive low Community Reinvestment Act ratings.
They didn’t touch the section that would lower capital requirements for custody banks, likely to the disappointment of JPMorgan and Citigroup. But CBO says JPM and Citi have a 50 percent chance of benefiting from it anyway.
They were successfully pressured by Brown to add a foreign bank “clarification” to illustrate that they weren’t trying to help Deutsche Bank and Santander, nor a few regionals like Bank of the West that have foreign parents.
Crapo and the Dems behind the banking bill used the substitute amendment they released last night to respond to attacks from the left and the right. Here’s a link to my piece on that, and a thread will follow. https://t.co/VOzjjHxtDv
The Senate’s expected to pass the bank deregulation bill next week. As for today, it’s unclear when they will start to vote on amendments.

A few of the proposed changes to the Senate’s banking bill: A foreign bank “clarification”, free credit monitoring for military but w/restriction on lawsuits, foreclosure protections for military and refinancing safeguards for vets
