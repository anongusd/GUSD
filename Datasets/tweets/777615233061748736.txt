@AmbJohnBolton NSA Bolton, prudent that Commanders acknowledge of the battlefield an advantage to [negotiate] common interest with the Russians until proper political¬†solution is reached by UN Security Council...
@AmbJohnBolton The Venezuelan Crisis proved inconsistent with the US constitutional principle, it brings to epicenter President Juan Bosch overthrow (integral democratic leader)... countercoup; Civil War; Invasion traumatic consequences
@AmbJohnBoltonWrong policy the parent of dictatorship and bloodshed as we have sadly experienced during decades of Latin American struggle for decent living standards [sure we can do better than our predecessor, neither by deception nor brainwashing public opinion]
@AmbJohnBolton WE (as American) are responsible for Venezuela deteriorated economic, absurdity of "the big stick policy" inconceivable since we are sponsoring or backing corrupted and inhumane governments at several region of Earth
@AmbJohnBolton Authenticity of President Nicolas Maduro is preserved by 67% of the popular vote, his urgent measures to overcome challenges in need of a superpower (US) generosity and humanity, not to undermine institutions or the Armed Forces
@AmbJohnBolton WE SHOULD not recognize "puppet" figurehead nor "impostors" conscientious consequences will be devastating again to question US integrity and policy wrongfulness. My¬†absolute certain Maduro is a truthful leader seeking his people wellbeing
@AmbJohnBolton I AM¬† much sensitive to the fact that we've¬†misused and abused our Military Institution to promote the breaching of International Law having as result, worse remedy¬† than the intended by the policymaker... please, take that under consideration
@AmbJohnBolton US Intelligence Community aware of that, self-interest biased or cognitive trap not the instrument to conduct today's foreign-policy, their ability to manufacture course of action does not make it righteous Sir. DCIGH conscientious
@AmbJohnBolton I DO appreciate the sincerity to provide emergency AID to Venezuela under present state of affairs, the only legitimate authority to administer such benevolence is Nicolas Maduro Government (puppet to¬†negotiate, efforts to participate in next free-elections)

@JZarif My usual approach seeking to abuse the Ayatollah and President Rouhani compassionate virtue ready to propose A PRISONER SWAP conscientious several Iranian also held accused of spying by United States Department of Justice
@JZarif As stated on the above, major obstacle for a SWAP, without accurate information from your government, impossible to mediate or bring peace of mind to Livinston beloved family, who had suffered the insufferable
@JZarif Will check important-press pertaining request, please trusting you will, as always put your energetic diplomatic wisdom until all parties gather reliable data on Livinston fate

@huchilora LA POSTURA DEL PLD ha sido flexible, el problema es el caracter sanguinario y la falta de respeto por oficiales de alto rango y subalternos (Fuerzas Armadas-Policia). Los "Narcos" no tienen excusa ya que se les permite operar sus puntos de droga a plena luz del dia

@sahouraxo 		MY DEAR MS. SARAH ABDALLAH [RT]: I usually reshuffle the Honorable Ron	Paul assessment to the United States foreign-policy design and conscience	self-conscious that he is righteous almost 98% of the time‚Ä¶
@sahouraxo 		I suppose my original perception upon President Donald J. Trump committed	to make ‚ÄúAmerica Great‚Äù again wronged, realizing it is propagandistic dialectic	or nothing but psychological tragicomedy
@sahouraxo 		The pivotal moment to reconsider; rethink and depart from President	Barack Obama original scheming to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad defined	by its failure and devastating consequences‚Ä¶
@sahouraxo 		It is irresponsible, immoral and lack rational analysis to pretend	that the United States Armed Forces are obliged to engage terrorist groups	financed by American taxpayers [Mosul]
@sahouraxo 		Mr. Ron Paul is right, Al-Qaeda already given us an empiric lecture of bloodiest act carried out without remorse by Mohamed  al-Amir Atta on the World Trade Center 11 September 2001‚Äîinadequacy to deal with such groups arbitrarily aiming at innocents or undefended
@sahouraxo 		The Russian Federation decision to centralize deployment to wipe-out	terror threat in Syria should have influenced Trump; NSA John Bolton; Ambassador	Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
@sahouraxo 		Peace Novel Prize Laureate Barack Obama destroyed Syrian infrastructure,	orchestrated mass-manslaughter just like The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler‚Äôs henchmen,	and incited the worse displacement crisis in history
@sahouraxo 		Trump‚Äôs foreign-policy team seems to be trapped by own inconsistence	since Secretary Pompeo publicly accused the Islamic Republic of Iran of	sponsoring terrorism‚Ä¶ am usually obnoxious to hypocrisy and lies

@SecPompeo 	THE HONORABLE SECRETARY POMPEO: I truly believe irresponsible to forward rhetoric that could only bring bloodshed and devastation to one people, not very polite to put human lives in jeopardy Sir.
@SecPompeo 	I am not referring President Trump inflammatory statement in regards to the	Islamic Republic of Iran, which transpires similarity to his approaches to	recent Korean Peninsula ballistic-missile crisis.
@SecPompeo 	My assessment to such pronouncement typical of his unusual head-of-state behavior, that media-controversial discussion that keeps him on the headlines ‚Ä¶
@SecPompeo 	‚Ä¶intended to maneuver psychology of the masses, to manipulate surrendering honorability to sinister means.
@SecPompeo 	Acknowledging the search for opportunities a milestone in the United States foreign-policy bringing to focus our challenges at Afghanistan and Iraq.
@SecPompeo 	General David Petraeus confronted an opponent of complexity as ethnicity and religious background lacked political ideology but that of a sanguinary beast without	moral conscience.
@SecPompeo 	Mr. Pompeo,  we are still backing the Iraqi army intended to bring stability as	well reaching accommodation at Afghanistan having safety and security as primal	goal.
@SecPompeo 	Policymakers trapped by their own mistakes Libyan land could give you a clear shot to poor planning and how difficult to stabilize a nation on the aftermath of civil war.
@SecPompeo 	Armed group diversity on the peripheral source of skepticism. I am not expressing	concern pertaining inability for proper political outcome though anarchy the	only analytical assessment to Benghazi.
@SecPompeo 	Like Iraq, Libya‚Äôs infrastructure destroyed consequence of indiscriminate	bombardment sparking indignation to inhabitant not only at Mosul and Tripoli	but Yemen and Syria.
@SecPompeo 	I usually brings Attila the Hun to epicenter to make a point, there is not point	moment we authorize airstrikes or deploy our infantry the terrain turned into desolation and death.
@SecPompeo 	The nature of war is not defined by rule of engagement but the will of the	conqueror to achieve victory.
@SecPompeo 	Poor political judgment creates stalemate our generals put to scrutiny at times	profiled incompetent or accused to infringe international law‚Ä¶
@SecPompeo 	‚Ä¶ since the jurisprudence stipulated aggressive war an international crime	against the human species.
@SecPompeo 	United Nations bodies shaken by inadequacy or lacking resources to deal with 60	million refugees. Upon the U.S. and civilized European Union members share	responsibility.
@SecPompeo 	We have deployed troops in 168 countries around the globe, current Forbidden Mansion incumbent has not produced frame-work to bring stability to Iraq; Libya‚Ä¶   Afghanistan; Yemen; Israeli-Palestinian antagonism to name some clear defiance.
@SecPompeo 	Now he is cynically and abusively scheming to put another nation into the Medieval Ages. Trump‚Äôs malice describes a narrow mindedness individual crockery impersonating others failure
@SecPompeo 	The propagandist dialectic cannot argue warmonger rationale upon what we‚Äôre bearing witnessing worldwide. As leading superpower, as democracy‚Ä¶
@SecPompeo 	...if I had little bit of decency or moral stand, self-esteem or respect for the	office of the presidency would find embryo of righteousness to address	challenges upon humanity and  realistic perspective.
@SecPompeo 	Here the so-called military-industrial complex could easy complement policy of	reconstruction rather than destruction:
@SecPompeo 	The urgent need to bring political stability the art of diplomacy and ingenuity;	conflicting-parties brought together upon nation building then to plan and	finance a reconstruction process of vast demarcation.
@SecPompeo 	Public infrastructure establishing hospital, schools and bridges and highways as	priority. Franchising policy should incite our allies and opponent interest‚Ä¶

@NorwayMFA 		Wrote to President Putin aware without proper responsiveness Syria	inevitable will become a  captive nation consumed	by chaotic incision leading to anarchy
@NorwayMFA 		As consequence of the inbreeding insurgency mankind conscience terribly	damaged upon trust in policymakers including United Nations and NATO as	responsible for global security
@NorwayMFA 		My guidance that of Secretary-General, His Excellency Antonio Guterres	and the UN Security Council resolution ordering an immediate ceasefire in	Eastern Ghouta
@NorwayMFA 		Thus soliciting prompt negotiations with the diverse opposition	component, that to the extreme requesting Russian military action if political	will to end conflict resulted in failure
@NorwayMFA 		Persistent though my perception that President Donald Trump followed previous	administration policy without serious analysis of bloodshed and displacement
@NorwayMFA 		Recommended to include a formula where Asma al-Assad could be designated	president until accomplished stability‚Ä¶ leading to nationwide suffrage-broad	participation
@NorwayMFA 		No idea about Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg position for NATO	shares responsibility as well the Security Council to frame-up viable plan	ending conflict
@NorwayMFA 		My first assessment based in report upon the United States commitment to	bring stability and prominence to Iraq-Afghanistan, giving Russia opportunity	to deal with Syria
@NorwayMFA 		Now, a realistic approach is to analyze General Robert Neller	preoccupation, which defines the Joint Chief of Staff interest upon further	engagement to implement course of action
@NorwayMFA 		Minister Soreide, we both know how dangerous to the region further military	deployment that might shut all possibility of negotiations leading to	superpowers-confrontation

@LTCPeterLerner 		The Honorable Reverend Louis Farrakhan  anti-semitic rhetoric does not transpire his	heart; he is more willing to navegate among turbulent waters ignoring he might  be held responsible for inciting the storm because of his wording
@LTCPeterLerner 		YOU MUST understand the Minister ought to prove his people rights are respected	from time to time; anti-Semitic a vague world upon diversity and common law stipulation for we are equal before God and the law of man
@LTCPeterLerner 		Freedom of speech a conquest we fought ferociously to attain since the days of Moses even though it may show evilness when abused to detract or abrogate judge and defendant prerogatives; history lamp speaks ...
@LTCPeterLerner 		The subject rather complex as matter of fairness and logic‚Ä¶ Farrakhan meant not harm but to entertain followers or pleasing rumormongers at times Colonel
@LTCPeterLerner 		Hi is righteous man and like the palm of my hands his sworn statement should not hunt his heart and soul rational; false  path has not good ending
@LTCPeterLerner 		Words are cheap to justify the unjustifiable	upon assurance is not Reverend Farrakhan intentions
@LTCPeterLerner 		COLONEL PETER LERNER	Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)		MOSSAD
@LTCPeterLerner 		I did not uncover substantially your message	for it does provide two variants as possible scenarios, which is rather	speculative upon the analytical
@LTCPeterLerner 		I‚Äôd forwarded such preoccupying deviant to	former Secretary-General, the honorable Ban Ki-Moon expecting superpowers to	put an end to it
@LTCPeterLerner 		Long before Operation Thunderbolt took	place at Entebbe Airport, Palestinian did not hesitate to	bombard civilian aviation causing multiple dead
@LTCPeterLerner 		We‚Äôd held Colonel  Muammar Gaddafi responsible for Pan Am Flight	103‚Äîthe  Lockerbie Bombing killing 243 passengers	and 16 crew members; "Gaddafi sleeps with	 the fishes"
@LTCPeterLerner 		Traumatic to mankind conscience without chronological	detail of several flights for which fate could blame few nations on Earth, and	individuals, unnecessary though
@LTCPeterLerner 		MOSSAD cyber-experts and infrared technology connoisseurs aware of nations privileged by such diabolic capability if ever misused
@LTCPeterLerner 		Remember human nature is also evil; officers	degraded from office; even anger because of subordinate position injustice:	reasons undefined
@LTCPeterLerner 		I usually like to put the burden on CIA; that	self-conscious of George Washington sensitive conscience on spies; further	legislation empowering
@LTCPeterLerner 		The level of security-clearance, still it‚Äôs	double blaze sword, Japan does and then France retaliate, as dangerous as nuclear	weaponry in wrong hands
@LTCPeterLerner 		Morocco is not that far; maybe the International Space Station which means UN-superpowers	obliged to watch like Earth most trusted sentinel
@LTCPeterLerner 		The other matter is following General Ehud	Barack efforts to put an end to a heartbreaking antagonism	Israelis-Palestinians
@LTCPeterLerner 		My Dear Colonel Lerner: hope we may never again face that	violent impersonation of human struggle that destroyed many Jewish
@LTCPeterLerner 		‚Ä¶ multinational lives in plane crashes consequence of	terrorist bombardment; hope we are willing to solve differences peacefully
@LTCPeterLerner 		Saddened by  UN Secretary-General reports on Ghouta, it is devastating upon Syria inability to bring peace and stability
@LTCPeterLerner 		Like you to request MOSSAD uncover  the insurgency ethnicity and financial	resources, without logistic and moral support not fight
@LTCPeterLerner 		Another matter like to address is Israeli-Palestinians	unrest, Ambassador Haley comments before the UN Security Council members
@LTCPeterLerner 		MY conclusion is to frame a roadmap consistent with	all parties demand: TWO-STATE; new-partition at Gaza	and the West Bank
@LTCPeterLerner 		My perception to embrace civilized approach upon	President Abbas and HAMAS institutional guarantees of everyone inalienable	rights
@LTCPeterLerner 		Gaza can only survive interacting with West Bank	through highways or underpass; seaport and airport urgently built Colonel
@LTCPeterLerner 		IF US Congress; EU leadership fund Israel upon the above demands, we	could use DoD-JCS for reconstruction manpower, Palestinian as well

@HassanRouhani 		17 February 2018	Distinguished 	President Hassan Rouhani	Islamic Republic of Iran		Tehran
@HassanRouhani 		My Dear President Rouhani:		Pretending to fill historic gaps upon	intelligence tradecraft in need of Iranian Intelligence support
@HassanRouhani 		That in order to understand geopolitics	as superpowers sought their sphere of interest in apparent jeopardy
@HassanRouhani 		The [subject] in question is Phillip	Agee [former Intelligence Officer at American Central Intelligence (CIA) Agency
@HassanRouhani 		Following President Mohammad Mosaddeq	coup d‚Äô Etat an odd set of political episodes took place
@HassanRouhani 		United Kingdom and the United	  States intervention; the Honorable Allen	Dulles crowned Mohammad Reza Pahlavi ‚ÄúShahanshah.‚Äù
@HassanRouhani 		A brutal secret police installed to back	the new regime stability as means to secure Oil production intact as major	British energy provider
@HassanRouhani 		Mr. Agee was accused by Director of	Central Intelligence, the Honorable George H. Bush of a hideous high-treason	act
@HassanRouhani 		Bush established Phillip being	responsible for the death of Richard Welch (Athens CIA Chief of Station)
@HassanRouhani 		My analysis upon the years in question	is that at the time students; idealists blamed American citizens for The Shah	killing and abuse of power
@HassanRouhani 		Phenomena admitted all through Latin America at the time, I am a living witness of such ambiguity in the Caribbean
@HassanRouhani 		Unaware of Mr. Bush assessment,¬† Richard Welch cover blown without need of	Philip interference ‚Ä¶ without doubt
@HassanRouhani 		Several years later (1979) Bush	exercised his influence by revoking Agee‚Äôs passport through the Department of	State (see Court suit)
@HassanRouhani 		Agee life seemed to be in danger;	managed to escape to Cuba	where he was welcomed by Commandant Castro lieutenants
@HassanRouhani 		CIA has already, biased or not, mirrored Philip betrayal revealing vital secrets to the Cuban government; can you expose his objective in Teheran?
@HassanRouhani 		Kind regards,		Ramon Polanco R.

@StateDept 		[As matter of Military Integrity and Moral Stand; out of respect for	those meeting the Ultimate Sacrifice in foreign battlefields. rp.__]
@StateDept 		13 February 2018		 To General James Mattis	Secretary of Defense	The Pentagon		General Mattis:
@StateDept 		Little concern learning of the Military	budgetary signifying intention to adhere to policy of devastation at Syria despite	horrible consequences
@StateDept 		The Pentagon very aware of the Islamic	State complex composition; insurgency division including ‚Äúmoderate opposition‚Äù	and mercenary
@StateDept 		UN Security Council comprising	condemnation to a war that caused unprecedented displacement crisis; ignited by	Barack Obama
@StateDept 		Most valuable to the Pentagon responsibly assessment to US troops confronting ISIS fighter in a frightening battlefield (Syria)
@StateDept 		My perception that as UN Security	Council member US obliged¬† to certain	level of legitimacy upon financing warfare against sovereign nations
@StateDept 		High-contradiction conscientious American Central Intelligence (CIA) also failed to gain political momentum against Bashar al-Assad
@StateDept 		I am not slightest expedient to compare Iraq to Syria; Saddam Hussein placed	himself outside of the protection of international-criminal law
@StateDept 		Brutal uses of biological weaponry as well ordering the invasion of an Arab Emirate justified UN Security Council or unilateral respond
@StateDept 		Syria battlefield a total different scenario; the Russian Federation; Iran; Lebanese Militia Hezbollah decided to support al- Assad
@StateDept 		Lecture from the past ground to feel repugnancy by witnessing professional high-ranking and soldiers turned into war-criminals [?]
@StateDept 		Most absurd upon reasoning in arbitration; even American-Industrial-Complex now able to explore opportunity in reconstruction
@StateDept 		The above by addressing YEMEN; LIBYA; IRAQ and even Gaza-West Bank urgent needs as humanitarian for public infrastructure (reconstruction)
@StateDept 		Even the so-called Coalition; responsible of war-crimes ‚Ä¶ to pretend that any superpower could bombard women and children: unacceptable
@StateDept 		Either we do abide by the U.S Constitutional principle and International Law or uncover the hideous masquerade as Nazi-Fascist impersonators
@StateDept 		A spade should be categorized as nothing	but the sword of hatred; we created ISIS;	al-Qaeda; we invented modern-terrorism
@StateDept 		General Mattis: I suggest it is time you put your integrity uniform; to wear proud your Highest-Ranking distinction upon	righteousness; you own that to your soldiers Sir., to Posterity ‚Ä¶
@StateDept 		I am obnoxious that to this very day	many High-Ranking still subjugated to that deception masquerade to wage war of	aggression without remorse or legal ground
@StateDept 		Too many challenges; they cannot be	properly addressed without leading nation as the United States; to pave the road to Humanity; Honorability
@StateDept 		We are privileged with the Earth best	intelligence apparatus; let‚Äôs use as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson	would:
@StateDept 		--on the pursuit of happiness for every	inhabitant created by God, to be shared equally by everyone walking on the face	of the Earth
@StateDept 		I Salute A Commanding-General!		Ramon D. Js. Polanco R.		People‚Äôs Watch		Western Hemisphere		peopleswatch@fastmail.org
@brett_mcgurk 		13/2/18		 Distinguished	Mr. Brett McGurk	Special Presidential Envoy 	Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS
@brett_mcgurk 		Your Excellency:		 Thanking your efforts for lecturing  many of us upon today‚Äôs challenges and fight	against ISIS
@brett_mcgurk 		Like to abuse your generosity and good judgment to insure there are not violation to International Law or customs of legitimate warfare
@brett_mcgurk 		Important media already revealing hideous acts that might be subject of public	conscience reprove and condemned by all
@brett_mcgurk 		YEMEN  reports were revealing humanitarian crisis threat; that I mentioned to His Majesty, King Salman of Saudi Arabia
@brett_mcgurk 		ANOTHER matter of major concern is Iraq and Syria	air-space; the first under U.S.	control; Second the Russian-Federation
@brett_mcgurk 		Noticed Israel pilots on jeopardy at times; suggested MOSSAD they should restraint from any incursion on Syrian territory: provocation ?
@brett_mcgurk 		Similar to any attempt by Iran to violate Israel‚Äôs sovereignty by unidentified drones within their air space; it is time for reconciliation in the Middle East Mr. McMgurk
@brett_mcgurk 		I had sent several proposals intended to influence Israel	leadership conscience leading to strengthening a lasting peace	Israelis-Palestinian
@brett_mcgurk 		An optimistic road-map upon ¬†TWO-STATE recognition discussing	new-territorial borders: sea-port and airport construction at Gaza
@brett_mcgurk 		Jerusalem antagonism, to be ordained according to International	Law and United Nations pronouncements on controversial holy site
@brett_mcgurk 		Aware of some superpowers position upon 1967-occupation; I truly believe unrealistic though part of the talk and bargaining for Israel and Palestinians
@brett_mcgurk 		Also requested the Executive, to rely on honorable manpower designating James Comey and Admiral Kirby in relevant positions

@huchilora 		ESTIMADO  HUCHI: no se si mi interminable  verborrea en material policial servir√° de	apoyo, metaf√≥ricamente podr√≠a cansar ‚Ä¶ Uno se repite y la Carta Sustantiva no parece surtir efecto alguno, semeja una sociedad primitiva Mi Sr.
@huchilora 		He manifestado por d√©cadas la Polic√≠a Nacional no es entelequia al margen del	r√©gimen vigente como tampoco es el gendarme un ‚Äú√°ngel vengador‚Äù incontrollable; aqui y en  Japon, el que mata tiene que pagar por su crimen ...
@huchilora 		Peca de ingenuidad ya que es obvio el Agente no recibi√≥ en esencia Derecho	Constitucional; garant√≠a de cada vida inherente a servicio; responsabilidad del Gendarme y Jefes policiales ... La Ley unico parametro ...
@huchilora 		ADEMAS; justificar crimen con otro crimen es tipio del delincuente com√∫n; la	facultad legal se  pierde da√±ando la imagen institucional ... "si el o ella roba, yo robo ...si mata, tambien matar ... " Anarquia; Criminalidad impune sin duda alguna: ESTADO DE DERECHO ?
@huchilora 		SI EL uso de los recursos limitados, el Jefe policial se vera incapaz de resolver	problemas internos de envergadura, otra realidad palpable; Gobierno debe honrar presupuesto al pie de la letra ...
@huchilora 		RECUERDA que hasta hace poco los salarios del gendarme reflejaban sociedades	esclavistas, abandonado a su suerte; y armado sin que se le respetara su dignidad propia ...
@huchilora 		SON TANTAS las deficiencias; problema vital es respecto a la dignidad individual ya	que constituye raz√≥n de la existencia como instituci√≥n apegada a sus principios ...
@huchilora 		LA SOLUCION es que ASUNTOS INTERNOS (si existe), eval√∫e el trabajo policial y	recomiende promoci√≥n o separaci√≥n del agente de las filas ...
@huchilora 		La Constituci√≥n dominicana no estipula pena capital; la vida es sagrada y quien la	viola debe responder ante  los tribunales competentes, nadie esta por encima de la ley ...
@huchilora 		Mi posici√≥n es t√°citamente constitucional; la tipificaci√≥n del mas aborrecible de	los crimines destinada a penalizar al matador
@huchilora 		Aberrante que aun sucedan actos de esa naturaleza; si Ud. no es polic√≠a renuncie y	ded√≠quese a la cr√≠a de puercos; limpiar zapatos ‚Ä¶ u otros
@huchilora 		Mi recomendaci√≥n es que agente no apto para portar arma de reglamento porte	macana; su trabajo es proteger; salvaguardar ‚Ä¶.

@cuba_raul1 		General, inevitably to put efforts to	defeat the so-called Islamic State (ISIL) at Iraq	and Syria;	analyzed consequences
@cuba_raul1 		IT IS my perception that some of my	friends at Langley	had contributed to provide logistic and training upon
@cuba_raul1 		THAT aware that President B. Obama decided to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad regime--he ignited civil war
@cuba_raul1 		Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau already put his duty and responsibility in the line of criticism by providing shelter
@cuba_raul1 		MY INTENTION to divert ISIL-ISIS from continuing hostility at Iraq and Syria as major deployment, by granting shelter
@cuba_raul1 		I BELIEVE the question upon some	detainees at Guantamo Bay had been put to Cuba	leadership in the past
@cuba_raul1 		SIMILARLY; it will lead to strengthening	peace and stability at Iraq	and Syria if Cuba	takes some fighters as refugee
@LTCPeterLerner I BELIEVE we can bring some ISIS  fighters to Canada en Havana, Raul is good negotiatior upon such groups philosophy or dogma
@ArmyChiefStaff GOOD MORNING GEN Mark A. Milley;  CONGRATULATIONS to every single Soldier's Medal 101stAASLDIV recipients ; I STOOD AND SALUTE!

@KremlinRussia_E 		Such defiance could easily ignite an	international dispute pushing China	and Russia to unwanted confrontation
@KremlinRussia_E 		The Council has clearly expressed the solidarity that unites the Family of Nations by sanctioning the regime
@KremlinRussia_E 		Even assumption, Pyongyang violations of international and	criminal law  jeopardizing world peace Mr. President
@KremlinRussia_E 		The dangerous possibility of unilateral	actions by destroying the missile sites simply unacceptable
@KremlinRussia_E 		I like to suggest China‚Äôs leadership and you formally	address issue making sure Kim conscious of his provocative actions
@KremlinRussia_E 		The Council language rather upon frustration aware of its numerous solemn warnings to Pyongyang following testing
@KremlinRussia_E 		The Democratic People Republic of Korea cannot	produce further testing without the UNS-Council or the IAEA approval

@LTGWest 		SECRETARY	of THE ARMY:		 ‚ÄîCONGRATULATIONS GENERAL NADJA WEST!
@LTGWest 		Remember a speech by Army Chief of Staff; Commanding-General Mark Milley in regards to WWI and how it started following ‚ÄúSarajevo.‚Äù
@LTGWest 		Few days ago General Milley wrote about United States troops first confrontation at the Battle of Cambrai (WWI); tanks introduced.
@LTGWest 		Bitter truth, Europeans had got used to 10-14-30 year wars normal; WWII brought	devastation and slaughtering never witnessed by woman
@LTGWest 		NOW as I try to digest the sum of all these ongoing conflicts; mathematic  transpired how far we departed from law and humanity
@LTGWest 		It is Sun Tzu military ingenuity what teaches most [paraphrasing]: ‚ÄúPolitically, Generals shall learn to win before war ever fought.‚Äù
@LTGWest 		SOME truly believe Victory is greatest when avoiding confrontation; amid nuclear	capability; no honor in human beings slaughtering
@LTGWest 		THE very essence of an army coming into existence; soldier invincibility to preserve	God‚Äôs most treasured gift: human lives
@LTGWest 		I shall then appreciate all your lectures through unparalleled dedication serving	Fatherland General West, not doubt of your soldier embodiment

@ArmyChiefStaff 		GOOD MORNING GENERAL MILLEY (US Army Chief of Staff):How extraordinary	the spirit of solidarity upon independence war!
@ArmyChiefStaff 		The British Empire surrender at Yorktown,	Virginia (1781) restored America morale	and revived French enthusiasm
@ArmyChiefStaff 		Continental Army led by General George Washington and French Army troops	led by Comte de Rochambeau [Battle of Yorktown]
@Army		Overwhelmed by the Founding Fathers recognition war against the British	could not be wo[n] without accurate Intelligence gathering
@Arm		General Washington sought Continental Congress to typifying betrayal when lives of espionage warriors put at risk (legislation wisdom)
@ArmyChiefStaff 		Master Sun Tzu would have been proud by the approach of this early	empowering of Army‚Äôs intelligence with foreknowledge
@ChiefStaff 		You‚Äôre aware my philosophy utmost secrecy rather consumed by amnesi[a]	pathological weakness when it came to Intelligentsia
@ArmyChiefStaff 		THEN; much we learn to deceive when human treacher[o]us and infamy put	to undermine personal credibility awareness
@Army 		We should not recognize covenant when Fatherland integrity on jeopardy;	high-trea[s]on proved as damaging as opponents scheming
@Army		I should not find justification but that of a leopard under constant	threat from people thought friends or eager-committed protector
@ChiefStaff 		It is obvious, moment the [beas]t surrounded; should fight until	defeating opponent cyni[ci]sm and lack of ration[a]l embryo
@Ar 		THERE IS not explanation to[f]our episodes threatening my life as well	that of loved-ones: I shall instantly rehabilitate from amnesia

@NYPDONeill 		UPON CIA complexity; my remarks were destined to ignite Agency  responses, to confirm what we already know; denial deception
@NYPDONeill 		ALL warriors (Spies) are privileged with highest-level of security clearance; none ever in jeopardy: US Espionage Law [?]
@NYPDONeill 		THEN aware Intelligence psychological analysis biased from	time to time, CIA obliged to find proper remedy; to restore morale

@AminaJMohammed 		 SUCH stage of violence where sects-and-groups take the	law into their hands; governments proved incompetent and inhumane
@AminaJMohammed 		I am much worried about the Kirku siege by the	Iraqi-Joint-Command; wrote to DOD General¬†	James Mathis aware of danger
@Mohammed 		Kurdistan independence inevitable;  Kurds conscience that of a united community to establish sovereignty legitimacy; recognition
@Mohammed 		If we‚Äôre to follow Saddam Hussein similar policy I do not see rationale to even continue involvement in the massacred nation
@Mohammed 		AWARE of the cry for self-determination in several regions, it is ignited by inequality and injustice, inhumanity above all
@johnpodesta 		GOOD MORNING MR. PODESTA; President Franklin Delano	Roosevelt never thought proper of public office secrecy in a Democracy
@podesta 		WE DO not see reason why Government decisions should be kept in a Pandora-box, the High Court sees unrevealed source potential
@johnpodesta 		FURTHER, the Court accepted gradual merging of the press-media upon Government wrong, preserving freedom of the press
@johnpodesta 		MATTER of National Security would have to be proved, difficult when we‚Äôre privileged with mankind strongest military force
@johnpodesta 		EVEN as we are engaged in a deadly battlefield, commanders privileged-information according to their mystic and security rule
@johnpodesta 		I FOUND disparity in many Intelligentsia decisions typical of Fascist regime practices during Bill Clinton administration
@podesta 		POWER granted upon clearance &amp; faculty to an espionage warrior meant to preserve our Constitutional principle, not to destroy it
@jpodesta 		WHEN the Agency or Spy departed from that principle, it was to commander-in-chief to act measuring; restraining infamous means
@johnpodesta 		 PATTERN of unjustified episodes, question Clinton	administration competency: RWANDA;	FLIGHT 800; JFK Jr. assassination
@rhodes44 SIR. IRAQI AND SYRIA battlefields still major policymaker concern; displacement as well, my hope we will end conflict &amp; stabilize

@KremlinRussia_E 		FOLLOWING on Madam Secretary Hilary Clinton statement	it seems  she has managed to gather Intelligentsia
@KremlinRussia_E 		That in regards to the [Russian proof] on current	investigation by ‚ÄúSpecial Counsel‚Äù on President Donald Trump
@KremlinRussia_E 		You‚Äôre aware dissatisfied Agents could be secretly	bribed; hired as Reverse Spies causing damage to their Master
@KremlinRussia_E 		Little worried Mr. Trump might lack foreknowledge	(deceived); 4 decisions making him liable as criminal
@KremlinRussia_E 		I‚ÄôVE not recognized authority within United States boundary when	betrayed foundation or constitutional principle
@KremlinRussia_E 		Meaning Government deriving just power from the	consent of the governed; not parasite institutions, never traitors
@KremlinRussia_E 		A public servant in high-position no above the law, on	the contrary he/she obliged to faithfully obey US Constitution
@KremlinRussia_E 		Upon threats to my physical integrity, undermines legitimacy	of Agency or individuals as well: detected [?]
@KremlinRussia_E 		It also means Josef Mengele embryo in control of	minds, self-interest cognitive biased without doubt Mr. President
@KremlinRussia_E 		Disturbed stages for non-American; non-foreign national is safe‚Ä¶ 5 decade-precedent permeates "Inquisition"
@KremlinRussia_E 		Reason why requested United Nation Security Council	permanent members to develop identical technology (urgently)
@KremlinRussia_E 		We depend on highly-level of intelligence, criminals	to be watched around the clock; put to sleep before abuse
@KremlinRussia_E 		I AM holding President Trump and DCI responsible,	either they‚Äôre incompetent or traitors, they‚Äôve the US Constitution

@NYPDCT 		 I would not consider National Security Act 1947 (Harry Truman  (Stat 496) as American Central Intelligence (CIA) beginning
@NYPDCT 		Truth it came into existence formally-chaptered by Executive Order [legislation]‚Äîstill‚Äîcredit to its true precursor:
@NYM.G. William ‚ÄúWild Billy‚Äù Donovan since Evan Thomas described OSS as an "informal" &amp; "freewheeling" place where "[r]ank meant little."
@NYPDCT 		SUN TZU in [The Arte of War] vs Use of Spies: ‚ÄúKnowledge cannot be gotten from ghosts and spirits, cannot be had by analogy‚Ä¶.‚Äù
@NYPDCT 		Donovan was to lead the Office of Strategy Service (OSS)	as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt re-named it before Truman CIA
@NPD 		Chief Water, Wild Billy recruited the psychologists who helped analyze the psyches of the Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders
@NYPDCT 		Became The Father of Intelligence; The Last Hero as recipient of Medal of Honor; Distinguished service Cross; Silver Star
@NYPDCT 		In addition, Distinguished Service Medal; National Security Medal; and Purple Heart though greatest accomplishment his clever mind
@NYPDCT 		It‚Äôs his outrageous pursuit of action and ‚Äúskullduggery‚Äù likewise flowing from Master Sun Tzu millenarian espionage	ink
@NYPDCT 		Donovan would be categorized as the prototype	of master spy; loved Fatherland and should remain immune to criticism

@huchilora 		I‚Äôve not idea about the White House position and how sincere they may pursue the American people interest to this very hour
@huchilora 		MY modest proposal would be to urgently facilitate substantial credit (US as	collateral) at international banking for Venezuela
@huchilora 		MAKE sure national-debt balanced as well allowing Government to implement fast-economic changes increasing purchasing power
@huchilora 		THAT will supply national need or public demand of most important products (goods) at affordable prices without interference
@huchilora 		The General Assembly already condemned as illegality by the solidarity which unites the Family of Nations and the 2 popes

@VladimirPutin13 	MY DEAR President Putin: My sin as na√Øve upon the Middle East endless battlefield; rather ignorance/ lack of understanding
@VladimirPutin13 		AWARE of the Syrian border situation, almost	impossible for a field-general to bring stability
@VladimirPutin13 		POLITICALLY the United Nations Security Council must	act towards nations backing the terrorists (ISIS)
@VladimirPutin13 		MY PERCEPTION that the United	 States commanders would morally and logistically	(training) support Iraq
@VladimirPutin13 		IT WILL be then up to the Iraq-DOD/JCS to make sure	not hostility is encouraged from Iraq
@VladimirPutin13 		JORDAN is already protecting 300 kilometers Syria-Jordan frontier; expect Turkey; Lebanon will do like
@VladimirPutin13 		SELF-conscious Hezbollah playing important part as	strategic-liaison supporting Bashar al-Assad forces

@VladimirPutin13 		MY first approach was to reorganize the Armed Forces;	Libyan revolutionaries recruited
@VladimirPutin13 		THEY‚Äô ve got their unprecedented migration situation;	it won‚Äôt stop without stopping refugee crisis
@VladimirPutin13 		NOTICED Israeli PM visiting; I put my politically incorrect	remarks to MOSSAD, occupation ambiguity [?]

@LTGWest 		IT does prolong misery, Afghanistan could have been stable	by now, all sects and groups brought to participate equally
@LTGWest 		I MEAN, the search for opportunity giving these far-away regions	a taste of dignified living-standards and fair competition
@LTGWest 		MUCH POVERTY in many of these countries, Iraq could have	been turned into employment and business opportunity
@LTGWest 		EVEN border nations would find to accommodate habitat in seeking	¬†of better existence and progress for	their loved ones
@LTGWest 		YEMEN through a humanitarian crisis; Syria still a major source	of displacement, land totally devastated General
@LTGWest 		I SEE US in Iraq	and the Russians at Syria	could¬† pave the way to stable regimes opening	new words in the region
@LTGWest 		THE options for fresh capital, investment¬† and profitability as we engage in nationwide reconstruction	process: the vision

@KensingtonRoyal 		[Royal Visit to Poland-2017]:	HER ROYAL HIGHNESS CATHERINE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE;	HRH WILLIAM DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE

@KensingtonRoyal 		SURE Prince George and Princess Charlotte will	remember such an extraordinary event as they grow little older
@Royal 		I WOULD not like to be lost in translation Your Highness, honor is due as President Andrzej Duda and beloved wife Beata welcome You
@KensingtonRoyal 		THE land where Karol J√≥zef Wojty≈Ça, the human flesh who became John Paul the Great came into existence: A BLESSED LAND
@Royal 		I used to study Polish history since childhood, well, the Warsaw Ghetto, you know The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler did not  care for Poland
@KensingtonRoyal		IT‚ÄôS magnificent to watch the skyline over Warsaw today, spectacular scenery hope you will enjoy by the seconds My Duchess
@KensingtonRoyal 		Should we read some of Joseph Conrad novels, Nostromo or Heart of darkness, would love to read a few pages after midnight
@Royal 		AM most happy you both taking the time to visit, I‚Äôd met one Polish lady through my life: she was rather like yourself personality
@Kgton	Should wish you goodnight? Love to spend two hours with Thou Princess Kate at the Royal Castle in Sansomierz, by the Vistula River

@KennedyNation 		MY DEAR MS. KENNEDY (Fox): matter of ‚Äòequality Government‚Äô principle	we should educate ourselves upon, should we?
@KennedyNation 		OUR FOUNDING Fathers thought righteously to frame a government	based on equality and justice for all
@KennedyNation 		SAD TO ACCEPT privilege; monopoly; lack of humanity, similar to	racial profiling infected our national consciousness
@KennedyNation 		‚ÄúDemocracy or Equality‚Äù seems to shows its wekness as we are more	bound to enhance discrimination and prejudice
@KennedyNation 		THE IDEAL Jefferson; Adams sought	ferociously to cement simply benefited the few, the privileged, the rich my	dear
@KennedyNation 		IT‚ÄôS truth, we had established economic foundation to promote	opulence, still abandonment of humanity a deviant
@KennedyNation 		FOUNDING Fathers thought just to tax the rich, American most	wealthy families usually shared their wealth through charity
@KennedyNation 		I personally propose Congress American billion-dollar estate should	found Healthcare as generosity and gratefulness
@KennedyNation 		NOT only a few should live in opulence like Joseph Stalin and Adolf	Hitler, we are not communist Ms. Kennedy
@KennedyNation 		Upon minimum wages, to received lower than US$ 22 (dollar) an hour	resembles slavery according to index price
@KensingtonRoyal 		YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS: some people are the light of	the party and it goes on dancing of sports without doubt
@KensingtonRoyal 		HAPPY that you and the Duke always share with the	public, shouting at stadium or any championship though
@Kensington 		I HAVE been putting my royals in hold, which is not a deed to be proud, it is as the world turn around us Princess Catherine
@Kensington 		CROWN Princess Victoria just celebrated her 40th Birthday, not that she looks more than 22, hope you called her on occasion
@KensingtonRoyal 		AND our adorable Princess Madeleine of Sweden looking	like a baby-doll, I suppose she still competes with her descendants
@KensingtonRoyal 		I MEAN My Duchess you look terrific upon your	maturity and glamour though Madeleine is miraculous in her seventeen
@KensingtonRoyal 		YOU know how I translate the ages carousel, I feel	like you and I wanted to be born in Elizabethan times (ideal)
@KensingtonRoyal 		I know I would spend weekend (if were a prince)	hanging around Catherine the Great garden, reading poetry by the lake
@KensingtonRoyal 		MYSTERY, I think of you as Catherine, a Russian	empress of her lineage, then you are My British Duchess for better
@KensingtonRoyal 		I DREAMED watching you and Princess Madeleine, it	was an illusory passage thought delightfully wet and passionate
@KensingtonRoyal 		COULD listen the waterfront-palace silence broken	by the both of you moaning mixing on the waves pounding
@AmbJohnBolton 		Ambassador Bolton:just wrote to the Israeli Foreign Ministry pertaining that arrogant behavior adopted from Adolf Hitler
@AmbJohnBolton 		WE‚ÄôVE not right to dictate other people national policy; neither those values Washington; Jefferson and Lincoln defended
@AmbJohnBolton 		SOVEREIGN nations are entitled to live according to their likes: political system of their own,religious beliefs as well
@AmbJohnBolton 		ANOTHER matter if they turn themselves as war criminal; or threatening the world peace: UN Security Council jurisdiction
@AmbJohnBolton 		Mr. Bolton, WE‚ÄôVE lost moral stand to decide who‚Äôs a terrorist or a drug-dealer, we financed	terrorists and drugs
@AmbJohnBolton 		NOT only that, by abrogating a (certificate) either, drug or terrorism, made a fool out of ourselves Ambassador
@AmbJohnBolton 		YOU know we even	placed Cuba in a list of	nations involved in drug, Cuba	put to a death squad national heroes because of it
@AmbJohnBolton 		I mean, not nation ever implemented a radical policy to criminalize drug-trafficking like Cuba did, not the US
@AmbJohnBolton 		I have reached the conclusion we ought to define [terrorism] once again, al-Qaeda; Bin Laden our invention Sir
@AmbJohnBolton 		ISIS, sure we put American taxpayers	into that sanguinary group: (our democracy) teaching dear pupil [?]
@AmbJohnBolton 		AS you can see, the need to reconsider; go back to who we are and who we were a matter of integrity my dear friend
@AmbJohnBolton 		WHAT makes me feel uneasy, that you are a foreign-policy connoisseur still pretending to live	in that [deception latrine]
@AmbJohnBolton 		IT IS  matter of respect for our integral	high-ranking officer class, to the people: to depart from misdirection, from	lies
@AmbJohnBolton 		PSYCHOLOGY profiles a nation leadership lacking spiritual consciousness: ENEMY WITHIN	needs EXTERNAL ENEMY
@IsraelMFA 		ISRALEI FOREIGN MINISTRY (Syrian Stability): I do not see rationale in dictating other nations living standards
@IsraelMFA 		UPON defense purpose, we do not (as Israelis) allow external interference as we develop national defense capability
@IsraelMFA 		OUR responsibility is to make sure [we] build our defense means to protect and	preserve the lives of our people
@IsraelMFA 		WE have not given rights; authority of any kind to interfere in other nations national defense: Syria; Lebanon	‚Ä¶
@IsraelMFA 		Syria; Iraq; Iran; Lebanon have been recognized sovereign rights (Israel likewise) to establish multilateral relations
@IsraelMFA 		I DO NOT find rational; legal; to pursue a policy that has portrayed Israel as a	tyranny instigator, occupation or oppressor
@IsraelMFA 		WE OUGHT to go back to our roots, recognition of other people rights only guarantee they will recognize ours

@RealJamesWoods 		IT‚ÄôS a whole new set of obstacles Mr. Wood, the entire	panoramic reflecting one of those ‚Äòthird word countries.‚Äô
@RealJamesWoods		I MEAN, since when have any president interfered with	the Department of Justice (FBI) investigation process and procedure
@RealJamesWoods 		YES, we have recorded that traumatic experience from Richard Nixon administration, though that is something in the past
@Woods 		AND it is not only at DOJ-FBI, the Honorable James Comey situation is ironically real witches hunting from new WH tenants {?}
@RealJamesWoods		LIKE to believe it is inexperience and nervousness,	CIA has began with the wrong foot causing worldwide concern My Pupil
@Woods 		I MEAN, the ‚ÄúCold War‚Äù has been over for several years	and the Family of Nations has established a Convention against TORTURE
@Woods 		CONDUCTING experiments on human lives (myself) place	the WH tenant and the DCI as war criminals, just like Nuremberg defendants
@Woods 		WE LIKE to think there is recruiting standards at CIA,	it shows incompetence and idiocy, directory obviously lack qualification
@RealJamesWoods 		THEY SEEM to be threatened by my comments, stand	ignorance for I have never made remark that does not come from CIA agents
@RealJamesWoods 		LACK of history knowledge, it‚Äôs ridiculed, they should	read about Cubela, Veciana, Carriles, Phillip Agee and many others
@RealJamesWoods 		WHAT one director keeps secret the next DCI	declassified, not even George H.W. Bush ever interfered with the Cubans
@JamesWoods 		THOSE two psychos, Tenet and Brennan (democrats),  parasites like should have never be in charge of our Intelligence apparatus
@CourteneyCox HI BABYTA BELLA, I wrote through facebook, you never came by pretty woman, all my love and regards to FRIENDS amazing crew
@RealJamesWoods 		GOOD EVENING MR. WOOD; trying to figure out the message you like	to transpire though rather impracticality
@RealJamesWoods 		AND THAT upon reassurance your  filmmaking amalgam is simply extraordinary;	magnificent; remarkable &amp; pleasant  voyage
@RealJamesWoods 		I DID play TRUE BELIEVER though NYC judicial as well NYPD	probably among the most capable and trusted in the nation
@RealJamesWoods 		NYPD still resembles Commissioner Raymond Kelly mystic, and he	was and is upon retirement a true-cop my pupil

@Pontifex 		MOST HOLY FATHER; little worry about Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI because of his constant concern; a different kind of Christmas
@Pontifex 		AWARE he was a soldier and his discipline will find awkward my obtuse behavior, we‚Äôre different beings, his maturity exemplary
@Pontifex 		SELF-conscious of treason; lack of respect for human life like himself at the Papal Residence, still we ought to fight evilness
@Pontifex 		HAD to play psychology, that in order to put everyone in cross-examination: know who to trust now; who not to trust Pope Francis
@Pontifex 		It‚Äôs hectoring, intriguing tough lies and deception are accepted as normal,	integrity rather a ‚Äòvague word‚Äô like figureheads
@Pontifex THAT insulting war helter-skelter the source of insulting 	endless bloodshed and displacement: ought to end now, now My Pope
@Pontifex 		THEY have put the military to question, even integral high-ranking officers into that ugly fog; that deception ghost traumatic
@Pontifex 		I‚ÄôVE observed the very facts correctly, resources must to be invested on humanity as priority; too much blood, not justification
@Pontifex 		I HAD to uncover the Israeli aggressive behavior though Father Benedict will pardon historical review: making my point
@Pontifex 		THEY re conscientious of how despicable the occupation, still varying implies a complex solution; the secular pattern to change
@Pontifex 		Righteousness only wisdom otherwise we become political handicap, international law guidance as major objective to lead Pope
@Pontifex 		It has been heartbreaking, hereafter optimism Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat met at Camp David, a brave general sees obstacles
@Pontifex		Pope Francis, Commander of the Harel Brigade who became Prime Minister of Israel: YITZHAK RABIN, a man of integrity, changes
@Pontifex 		HE TOOK a dramatic chapter of history	with him like a hero, can any question his love for Fatherland? Entebbe;	First Intifada‚Ä¶
@Pontifex 		Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat; Yom Kippur; Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty; his brutal assassination should give clear shot
@Pontifex 		I had to rely on amplifying the issue, Palestinian are courageous and very conscientious of their rights; their lives injustice
@Pontifex 		IT IS not a fault-finding test but	urgent recognition  of the TWO-STATE as	only solution Pope Francis; WISDOM for PEACE
@Pontifex 		My American; Israelis friends like to entangle facts from selfish interest: mankind interest mine; I am Jew; Christian; Muslim
@Pontifex 		Moment we developed nuclear capability, fast-forward Iran; North Korea; Palestine to do like My Pope: "Carrera armamentista"
@Pontifex 		Pretend to believe we are only ones entitled to that right stand ignorant: lack human nature knowledge: "they have imagination"
@Pontifex 		EVEN superpowers in need of balance in order to keep global equilibrium, otherwise law of the jungle, anarchy and hatred
@Pontifex 		From that perspective, we have surrendered moral ground by orchestrating terror schemes; making fools out of ourselves Pope
@Pontifex 		Flagrant violations to the Geneva Convention as well as the Rome Statute lack spiritual conscience; it is rather childish
@Pontifex 		THE need to go back to our Founding	Fathers equality principle matter of respect &amp; dignity
@Pontifex 		NONE would ever respect us, a superpower	left with its nuclear arsenal without humanity embryo
@Pontifex 		We all share responsibility in every	single aspect of today‚Äôs defiance: Iraq;	Syria; Yemen; Libya; Palestine
@Pontifex 		I told Israeli PM Netanyahu Palestinian	children are not scare of our Nuclear destructive power

@ang_merkel_ MY DEAR Chancellor	Merkel, I‚Äôve received a very substantial survey upon the G20 incidents: German	people protest
@ang_merkel_ MY DEAR Chancellor Merkel, I‚Äôve received a very substantial survey upon the G20 incidents: German people protest
@ang_merkel_ 		I SHALL be prudent or rather methodic upon selfish remarks, Police showed maturity and overwhelming respect
@ang_merkel_ 		I MEAN, to uphold the Constitution upon such adverse circumstances is the conduct of experience and consciousness
@ang_merkel_ IT IS gloriously empowering that Officers react to such turmoil in total control: my undoubted respect; proud of its humanity
@ang_merkel_ 		IT IS exemplary, for what the record shows we usually precipitate bloodshed by	unconsciously preventing it violently
@ang_merkel_ 		IN ESSENCE,the people has conquered  that right even	when jeopardizing private property: disturbing the peace
@ang_merkel_ 		THE wisdom in such advantageous procedure is that private property can be replaced (insurance], not human lives
@ang_merkel_ 		IT ALSO means Germany policing has endured lecturing us an unprecedented police lecture: CONGRATULATIONS
@ang_merkel_ 		CHANCELLOR, just occurred to me that	you might have some physician or dentist that could urgent check on me
@ang_merkel_ 		I‚ÄôVE not idea what is the medical procedure the criminals had introduced, or operated inside my anatomy
@ang_merkel_		SURE they can use identical infrared-laser	to check upon making sure everything is fine in my system
@ang_merkel_ 		ANOTHER aspect, like ESA to see if	they can block other infrared signals if detected on my premises
@ang_merkel_ 		THAT probably assisted with other	space-agencies, hope China; Japan; Russia and my friends in US	identify
@ang_merkel_ 		MY DEAR Chancellor Merkel: upon criminality what they usually do is to provoke indigestion, vomits at times
@ang_merkel_ 		THE satellite intervention intended to cause inner-congestion leading to critical condition or even heart-attack
@ang_merkel_ 		IS¬† a group of degenerate, brutal assassins	without control, reason why had communicated to world‚Äôs leadership
@ang_merkel_ 		LAS 72 hours they have been operating on my mouth without anesthesia, could not take pain had to rely on pills
@ang_merkel_ 		I HAVE denounced and they	do continue, Putin; Xi Jinping; You My Chancellor; Her Majesty the Queen; US	JCS; FBI aware of it
@MalalaFund MY DEAR MALALA, much happy you took the time to come by my TWITTER site, apologies for not replying urgently
@MalalaFund 		I Really hope you will enjoy this amusing communication tool, I am usually here in TWITTER or FACEBOOK
@MalalaFund 		STILL concerned about Afghanistan endless conflict, the threat of explosive detonated in urban areas, nightmare
@MalalaFund 		I LIKE to blame it as politically failure,	we shall have negotiated simultaneously as troops engaged
@FareedZakaria 		MY WELL-RESPECTED Mr. ZAKARIA (CNN) Washington Post): you know I am never impressed by the warmonger propaganda
@FareedZakaria IF I WERE to be honest, after Afghanistan and Iraq experience, rather to put taxpayer money on Healthcare/Education
@FareedZakaria 		I Wrote to Ambassador John Bolton pertaining the impossibility-illusory scenario of a unifying Korea
@FareedZakaria 		MOMENT the Korean War (25 June 1950) broke-out confrontation shed its blood causing irreparable damage to both sides
@FareedZakaria 		WE sponsored and established a ‚Äúdemocratic‚Äù like political system that has cemented South Korean institutions
@FareedZakaria 		THE DEMOCRATIC People‚Äôs Republic of North Korea dynastic heritage, more inclined to China‚Äôs Cultural Revolution
@FareedZakaria 		IT‚ÄôS EVEN complex in juxtaposition, for Chinas adverse dynastic ruling, though allowed the North to develop such	nation
@FareedZakaria 		MY analysis to Bolton based on the	dismembering of Germany	at aftermath of WWII unconditional surrender
@FareedZakaria 		THE SOVIET UNION could not assimilate	Germany; South Korea	might never be able to do like if put to referendum
@FareedZakaria 		They‚Äôve endured two different nations sharing geographical border, territorially divided by 1950 conflict
@FareedZakaria 		I AM NOT surprised by the way our experts and political critics profile other leaders, that‚Äôs part of deception fog
@FareedZakaria 		WE are also the source of fanaticism showing our lack of understanding of other people‚Äôs culture and way of life
@FareedZakaria 		THE record is substantially enriched upon rumormonger and disinformation: Minh; Castro; Allende; Bosch; Lumumba; Ayatollah
@FareedZakaria 		American people usually misdirected irresponsibly to serve private means, we developed 6000 nuclear warheads
@FareedZakaria 		PYONGYANG generals; Kim Jong-un never considered our powerful arsenal a threat, he saw it as means of defense
@FareedZakaria 		I am troubled by the obnoxious	propaganda psychosis for Saddam Hussein had; used chemical weaponry
@FareedZakaria Skeptical, knew he was a war	criminal who invaded an Arab Emirate and killed thousands through biological	warfare
@FareedZakaria 		WE doubted the ‚Äòmass-destruction report‚Äô because of that inconsistence media fanfare, lack of credibility
@FareedZakaria 		Self-conscious Kim never enjoyed Christmas toys, he only knowsabout ballistic-missile and war machinery
@FareedZakaria 		WROTE TO the People‚Äôs Republic of China several times, Pyongyang is part of their hegemony sphere	though
@FareedZakaria 		PUT myself in the place of my South Korean friends, their lives shaken by such constant menace in their backyard
@FareedZakaria 		IT DOES not mean we‚Äôre blind to consequence of that ‚Äòdevastating war‚Äô scenario putting the region to ashes
@FareedZakaria 		I trust China	leadership to make sure Kim does not threat South	 Korea; aware of the US readiness and responsiveness
@FareedZakaria 		OUR overwhelming capability	(military), put the ‚Äòwar-shadows‚Äô in China, so they will act accordingly	maintaining the peace
@bib_netanyahu 		PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU, it has been the most dramatic	and traumatic struggle for the Jewish people
@bib_netanyahu 		LIKE OR NOT since the very crucifixion of The	Christ, that passage through Tsarist Russia ‚Ä¶ the Bolshevik (Leon Trotsky)
@bib_netanyahu		THE BRITISH EMPIRE ruled with iron-hand as every	other ruler at the time, Palestine	first settlement another slaughter
@bib_netanyahu 		THAT occurred simultaneously as The Fuhrer, Adolf	Hitler implemented the ‚ÄúFinal Solution,‚Äù hatred everywhere
@bib_netanyahu 		I SUPPOSE Generalissimo Rafael L. Trujillo did	one thing right at Evian Conference, it proved enriching Sir.
@bib_netanyahu 		I DID review The Partition though, United Nations	and the United States on	your side, committed to establish Israel
@bib_netanyahu 		THE BRITISH Empire	idea of Two-States the most convenient, even Jewish intellectuals given the	choice to settlers
@bib_netanyahu 		EVERYTHING wrong since the very beginning, even	the land territorial limitation should have been addressed
@bib_netanyahu 		WE cannot turn back the clock, too much blood,	Palestinian suffered, Israelis suffered, noticing there Jews on both sides
@bib_netanyahu 		THE geography is totally absurd, Palestinian	areas are surrounded by Israel	land, Gaza in	one extreme
@bib_netanyahu 		IT DOES NOT make sense Prime Minister, the source	of hatred, suicide attacks, rebelliousness, nothing but the occupation
@bib_netanyahu 		IT DOES place Israel as the aggressor, as the oppressor, as the tyrant, and we must to be reasonable and accept facts
@bib_netanyahu I studied President Jimmy Carter assessment, John Michel	and British PM Tony Blair though need to review again
@bib_netanyahu 		MY POSITION Chancellor Merkel and Federica	Mogherini at the European Commission could prepare a proposal
@bib_netanyahu 		THAT to see what Israel	might object or approve, same with the Gaza Strip and West	 Bank ‚Äòtil final agreement¬†	reached
@bib_netanyahu THE TWO-STATE solution is the only solution, they‚Äôre	human beings‚Ä¶ the path to harmony and understanding
@bib_netanyahu 		AS LONG as we keep the Palestinian in a Warsaw Ghetto	like compound, they will rebel as we did in Poland	and Egypt

@GabRosenberg 		MUS TO confess my willingness to always put emphasis in serious analysis of our roots as religious-loving people, CHARACTER
@Gab		THAT CHILD willing to commit horrendous crime against an innocent life does not resemble frightening, his-her life not significance
@GabRosenberg 		EVEN THOUGH he should be aware of our overwhelming nuclear capability, the hatred embryo does not show brotherhood, remorse
@GabRosenberg 		I‚ÄôVE written MOSSAD several times expecting they are privileged with resources to plan communication device, who we are ..
@Rosenberg I‚ÄôVE personally developed Jewish mind and conception, I put the ocean breeze into cross-examination, also our conduct: CONSCIENCE
@GabRosenberg 		WHY DO CHILDREN at Gaza and West-Bank have encouraged such feelings against other human beings? That should guide inquiry
@GabRosenberg 		NOTICED the United Nations conscience condemns many of our policy towards Gaza Strip and the West-Bank Sir., to reconsider
@GabRosenberg 		I FIND inconsistent application of [good-neighbor] approaches entering in contradiction with our values and beliefs
@GabRosenberg 		IF MOSES was among us today; Jesus of Nazareth,	they both would ask us (Jews], to set the Palestinians free
@GabRosenberg 		THE children see us as their oppressors, as their  captivity	henchmen, as the true enemy, not justifying killing though
@GabRosenberg 		I BELIEVE the financial and manpower resource to be given to MOSSAD, to find the way into conciliation: PUBLIC RELATIONS

@Ostrov_A 		FROM that perspective, Christians; Protestants;	Muslims; Jews; Jehovah Witnesses share rights to praise our Lords

@LTCPeterLerner 		IT means Gaza Strip and the West-Bank shall	be hold accountable for their citizen actions, isolated or individually

@LTCPeterLerner 		LIKE or not, the United Nations guidance upon these critical issues of great relevancy and weight respected Colonel Lerner
@LTCPeterLerner 		I‚ÄôVE been reviewing American history trying	to understand our violence-embryo, sociologically; psychology
@LTCPeterLerner 		AND YES man nature is evil, reason for us to depart from any policy of conduct that might resemble that of Nazi Germany
@LTCPeterLerner 		WROTE to MOSSAD much worried about CIA sanguinary methods, unlikely and unacceptable. A democracy won‚Äôt allow such slope
@LTCPeterLerner 		THE PAST sepulchral violations must to be buried, that abuse of power extirpated at once: A THREAT TO HUMANITY NEVER
@LTCPeterLerner MY perception that today‚Äôs	agents or samurai or field-warriors must to encourage constitutional	consciousness
@LTCPeterLerner 		WE HAVE experienced enough Cosa Nostra blood	within our streets, The Mustache-Petes sleep to eternity
@LTCPeterLerner 		AT THIS stage I rather we depend of the JCS or the FBI for ‚Äúblack operations‚Äù when eminent danger occurs Colonel

@AmbJohnBolton 		THAT should become our main goal in order	to find proper solution to worldwide unrest Ambassador Bolton
@AmbJohnBolton 		A Liaison to keep UNSC permanent members	banging on target: Syria; Iraq; Afghanistan;	Yemen; Libya migration

@KensingtonRoyal 		I SHOULD appreciate all the videos and photos of Princess Diana you all have shared, used to admire; love	her madly YRH
@KensingtonRoyal 		Yes, truly an out of the ordinary royal personality then, you are also unique in your own ways and authenticity P Kate
@Kensington		THOUGH I prefer to enjoy your fantasies; my audacity to explore behind those dark eyes storming enactment, cretona culture
@Martin_Dempsey 		GOOD TO SEE you General Dempsey, I believe a General used to say ‚Äúa	different kind of Christmas‚Äù at times
@Martin_Dempsey 		PROBABLY an expression when things did not go according to	expected, world‚Äôs leadership very skeptical General
@Martin_Dempsey 		FOR reason unknown it seems we all must to adjust to the ‚Äònew	guard‚Äô though keeping that ‚Äòeagle eye‚Äô
@Martin_Dempsey 		YOU KNOW that Robert Gates kept perfect relations with the Russians	and the Chinese, I will follow [that] Sir.
@Martin_Dempsey 		AWARE we did not accomplished Afghanistan	stability, see it as political failure though, Pakistan a real threat
@Martin_Dempsey 		THAT understood for the Taliban regime had to seek shelter on	borders, still, diplomatic efforts of the essence
@Martin_Dempsey 		SOME were planning (CIA) an attack, that totally out of debate, it	will put India	in the line of fire General
@Martin_Dempsey 		IRAQ, unfortunate back to bloodshed which does not make sense after US troops unprecedented sacrifice
@Martin_Dempsey 		AGAIN, another political failure for General David Petraeus and you	all accomplished military mission
@Martin_Dempsey 		MY perception US commander will advantageously establish the proper liaison with Iraq military and win
@Martin_Dempsey 		SYRIA is the most traumatic, the displacement in addition to devastation, resembles Dresden in WWII General
@Martin_Dempsey 		I THINK best course will be to support US at Iraq and Russia	at Syria morally and bring hostilities to and end
@Martin_Dempsey 		WE DO share responsibility (CIA) training and financing sectarian groups	of complex ideology and ethnicity
@Martin_Dempsey 		I AM NOT longer categorizing Bashar al-Assad defeat as US interest, we	obviously failed to gain political momentum
@Martin_Dempsey 		THEN it is a proper assessment there is not winning side but	endless bloodshed, we shall disband our ‚Äògroups‚Äô at once
@Martin_Dempsey 		IF there is stability, then the ‚Äúmoderate opposition‚Äù could be	brought into epicenter to negotiate and participate
@Martin_Dempsey 		Otherwise I will approve of the Russian, and Bashar forces, air-force	and infantry engagement to defeat insurgency
@Martin_Dempsey 		IDENTICAL scenario for US commanders in Iraq	(Mosul and other cities); similar to YEMEN ‚Ä¶	conflict everywhere
@Martin_Dempsey 		 ALSO put the question of a multinational force into Syria, to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
@Martin_Dempsey 		THAT will be the UN Security Council, unable to reach an	accommodation, meaning we will act unilaterally
@Martin_Dempsey 		QATAR unrest seems to be addressed by the Arab Emirates, hope King Salman as the leader will find consensus to talk
@Martin_Dempsey 		President Trump rhetoric unpredictable, he will face the ‚ÄúSpecial	Prosecutor‚Äù and US Congress, not to be worried
@Martin_Dempsey 		DOMESTICALLY, we have formed a reasonable Union,	separation of power amid CIA obtuse behavior and menace

@tramp_donald1 		I DO NOT want to see another YEMEN Sir., that guided my solicitation to Ambassador Haley at the UN Sec. Council

@ang_merkel_ 		WORRIED there seems to be uncommon practice	of some British and European banks putting pressure on QATAR
@ang_merkel_ 		I would not like such unreasonable, QATAR allies	may react similarly, that last global-economic crisis specter [?]
@ang_merkel_ 		IT IS rather political, King Salman very aware of consequences and will give	thought, investors should be confident

@abdulibn_aziz YOU ARE aware QATAR is a country of remarkable economic achievement, exemplary to those nations struggling
@abdulibn_aziz 		I AM more concerned upon blockade, similar	to that of Israel on the Gaza	Strip and the West Bank: stated opposition

@DLoesch HI, I had to take that portrait of you and filed on my site, to keep you closer, it is West Cowgirl power though, I really like it
@kimguilfoyle 		IT HAS BEEN quite sometime since last I have enjoyed	FOX news delightful courtesans, not say anchor like a clich√©
@kimguilfoyle 		I‚ÄôVE noticed the radicalization of the fight between	the US President and The Media, it is rather like reality show
@kimguilfoyle 		THE WAY I see it started during the election and it	benefited The Apprentice, kept him on control of the headlines
@kimguilfoyle 		IT MEANS, they all have contributed to his election	baby, besides, he has got enough problems at the US Congress
@kimguilfoyle 		THAT  a hostile	territory, you know the way things are done there, then that ‚Äúspecial	investigator,‚Äù not very pleasant
@kimguilfoyle 		I HAVE been spending time at Langley, then on foreign-policy which is my	most interesting field upon world‚Äôs politics
@kimguilfoyle 		ALREADY wrote my selfish opinionated version of	HEALTHCARE, The Affordable Care Act is a master legislation
@kimguilfoyle 		IT WAS DESIGNED to pave the way into a more humane and	participative health care plan, mutually empowered
@kimguilfoyle 		IT HAS Nothing to do with politics, reason to make	sure pre-existent condition and incidentals covered
@kimguilfoyle 		I SUPPOSE Republicans and Democrats will sit together	to frame what‚Äôs today‚Äôs most beneficial Healthcare Bill

@realDonaldTrump I DO not know if it is my place to advise you Mr. President, you go to war with US media means you'll have to use your Army
@TheBushCenter 		LITTLE WORRIED some people at Langley find difficult to	coupe with reality, I supposed it is the new president policy
@TheBushCenter 		TO continue the inconsistent approaches	to world‚Äôs politics even aware geopolitics has dramatically changed up to today
@TheBushCenter 		I have been reviewing President Abraham	Lincoln assassination, how heartbreaking and unjust Mr. President
@TheBushCenter 		THE REASONS why Jefferson Davis kept the	Confederate armies struggle after the bloodiest battle of Gettysburg
@TheBushCenter 		I MEAN, the will to fight showed the	generals determination though it was a political decision to stop the fight
@TheBushCenter 		WITNESSING Gettysburg, bloodshed has take its deadly	toll and the country was ready for a ceasefire (surrender)
@TheBushCenter 		HERE human psychology questioning	leadership humanity unable to see the abyss. It‚Äôs was not ideological motivated
@TheBushCenter 		A RACIAL war the Founding Fathers	pretended to avoid since the Proclamation, though unavoidable
@TheBushCenter 		ON THE AFTERMATH, The War Department as	well as the Justice Department failed their prerogative
@TheBushCenter 		AWARE of diverse threats against ¬†President Lincoln life, John Wilkes Booth	kidnapping, execution hours away (?)
@TheBushCenter 		SUFFICIENT ground to search Mary Surratt	property arresting conspirators, assassination easily prevented
@TheBushCenter 		My Respected Painter: You think we should	have been better instructed on impressionism, Claude Monet ‚Ä¶
@TheBushCenter 		Picasso; would have painted Waterloo battlefield perfect,	a Rembrandt of Gettysburg, a historical masterpiece
@TheBushCenter 		THEN I have realized it was not only	about that artistic though depressing dark-red over the valley of death
@TheBushCenter 		IT WAS about Booby Fisher and Boris	Spassky Chess opening move, some play the game like a Las Vegas casino
@TheBushCenter 		Allen Dulles improvisation could never	match General William Donovan genius, even General Edward Lansdale gamble (?)
@TheBushCenter 		THE remedy to Southeast	 Asia nothing but deception and slaughtering, our soldiers sent to	an ambush at far-away

@TheBushCenter 		¬†AND now I am convinced that there was a moment	when Ho thought Vietnamese cuisine encompasses
@TheBushCenter 		HIS DREAM TO INTERACT with American	democracy tasting a Hershey‚Äôs bar, out of respect for Donovan boys
@TheBushCenter 		Enigmatic shadow I like to	put to rest, more willing to practice landscaping, no that	Texan mystic but Providence	brushes
@TheBushCenter 		SOME might think I have been aiming to	the [covenant] structure, nothing more far from the truth: making my point
@TheBushCenter 		HOPING [another] psycho does not cross	the red-line, and upon sure expect [Snipers and Samurais] constant watch
@TheBushCenter		FROM your painting learnt Cold War is	over, Saddam Hussein lost in chemical weaponry; Col. Noriega sleeps with the	fishes
@TheBushCenter 		THEN we should find not rationale or	justification to follow the hideous pattern that put our nation to shame
@TheBushCenter 		THE lack of judgment or ignorance stand	upon other peoples political struggle; willingness to overcome oppression
@TheBushCenter 		I SUPPOSE many were brain-washed to	pursuit private ends, when there is only one end: THE AMERCIAN PEOPLE WILL
@TheBushCenter		THAT sanguinary; Joseph Mengele endless	patronizing must to be put to ashes, we inherited [our SYSTEM]
@TheBushCenter 		THE UNITED STATES democratic principle;	our equality government only success we shall boast, not Adolf Hitler‚Äô
@TheBushCenter 		THE answer is in reengineering; reform	and restore morale to attain our intelligence purpose: RELIABILITY
@TheBushCenter		WE SHALL go back to the future, what we	were and must to be since Washington; Jefferson and Adam
@TheBushCenter 		CONCERNED Hong Kong children might be misdirected,	they are born Chinese like New Yorkers by the Hudson breeze
@TheBushCenter 		THEY ignore General Chiang Kai-shek¬† cashed his last check, and that Virginia had its Gettysburg,	LONG, LONG AGO

@tramp_donald1 		FEDERICA Mogherini is the EU political chief, though they usually discuss	important matters as priority at the EC

@tchzhein 		MY RESPECT MR. President: great expectations upon South Korea and North Korea bilateral relations
@tchzhein 		I really hope both sides conscious of the danger of confrontation	for the entire region, keeping the peace vital

@ang_merkel_ 		IS the refugee situation, totally out of control, (65 million) and	truly believe we all should conscientiously share burden
@ang_merkel_ 		ANOTHER matter is [sanctions] by the EU to the Russian Federation,	that might lead to mistrust between Russia-EU
@ang_merkel_ 		THE Afghanistan	endless conflict, NATO involvement though a political solution still seems	unreachable My Chancellor
@ang_merkel_ 		WITHOUT bringing all these [wars] to close (Yemen; Iraq;	Syria; Afghanistan) we may have to face	displacement
@ang_merkel_ 		I HOPE the EU is not financing any [terrorist] organization as we	did in Libya	to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi
@ang_merkel_ 		AWARE of Mr. Mistura (Secretariat) efforts; US-Russia talks upon Syria bloodshed	(dangerously threat)
@ang_merkel_ 		MY position of Israel-Palestine was that you should lead a Special	Envoy to study TWO  STATE solution (or any)
@ang_merkel_ 		THAT understood not other leader more conscientious of the secular	confrontation to deal with it
@ang_merkel_ 		ALSO believe the Palestinians at Gaza	and the West Bank might not trust other	leaders as much as you Chancellor
@ang_merkel_ 		AS STATED if the European Commission support you, George J. Michael	and PM Tony Blair framework of relevancy
@ang_merkel_ 		IN addition would like to put Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz as	member of the legal team if decided
@ang_merkel_ 		I DO NOT  see Trump Administration as a device of reconciliation, the Palestinians won‚Äôt trust the US upon

@cuba_raul1 		I personally regret asking Commandant Fidel Castro to mediate	requesting Leopoldo Lopez release from prison
@cuba_raul1 		ALSO put my humbleness virtue and prestige on the line by	requesting an Executive Pardon on his behest
@cuba_raul1 		MADURO never showed humanity embryos, Lopez wife, his children,	leadership should be humane
@Pontifex_es 		HIS EMINENCE; POPE EMERITUS Benedict XVI, Papal Residence Castel	Gandolfo; Rome:
@Pontifex_es 		Happy you have shared a precious moment at the Vatican with	Most Holy Father Pope Francis
@Pontifex_es 		Much heartbreaking upon current migration crisis undermining stability	at several EU members
@Pontifex_es 		Put the entire anathema on perspective aware of the humanitarian	situation and dramatic origins
@Pontifex_es 		YOU know I usually bring such matters to the United States leadership, not on	present circumstances
@Pontifex_es 		President Trump worries upon ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô already matter of	controversies at US courts
@Pontifex_es 		I REGRET we might be holding refugees without legal grounds, that	rather ambivalent Pope Benedict
@Pontifex_es 		I WANTED you to give some thoughts then to write to Chancellor Angela	Merkel and Pope Francis
@Pontifex_es 		THE fact that we may share responsibility since African colonial	regimen established
@Pontifex_es 		ALSO the overthrow of Libyan Dictator Muammar	Mohammed Gaddafi, present instability at region
@Pontifex_es MY suggestion that in order	to end ambiguity every single member of the Union	should contribute
@Pontifex_es 		I BELIEVE European monarchic proverbial	charity and generous mystic will help providing shelter
@Pontifex_es 		THEN the major source of displacement to be	addressed by the UN Security Council urgently

@RumsfeldOffice 	A highly qualified Representative, dedicated always focus on vital	issues, he has gained Republicans and Democrats respect
@RumsfeldOffice 	MY PERCEPTION  President Trump is a man of his own, connected  to the ‚ÄòSoviet Union‚Äô he might have difficulties on the road
@Rumsfeld 	I MEAN, in my case ought to keep Putin and Jinping cool like the French	and the German, Jewish chief (BN), does not see me as Jew

@AmbBolton AWARE OF unrest at a very important United States allied, South Korea, not sure IAEA considered missile testing as eminent threat
@Bolton MORE inclined to prudence, solicited President Xi Jinping of the People‚Äôs Republic of China to mediate with President Kim Jong-Un
@AmbBolton ALSO addressed situation to UN Secretary-General, His Excellency Antonio Guterres upon Security Council urgent political solution
@Bolton I BELIEVE you are mistaking by suggesting reunification of the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of North Korea (DPRK) with South Korea
@AmbJohnBolton SERIOUS analysis indicate two different society developed, DPRK cult to personality rather ambiguous for South Korean
@Bolton IT JUST won‚Äôt work upon political system structure, Kim Jong-Un predecessors ruled DPRK likewise a dynasty or a kingdom Ambassador
@Bolton TOTAL different specter than dismembering of Germany following unconditional surrender of The Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler‚Äôs armies (WWII)
@Bolton ON final analysis, bilateral relations must to be improved, People‚Äôs Republic of China could easily pave prospect of mutual respect
@Bolton I'VE my objection to engage our military unilaterally ‚Äîpolitically‚Äî though better off if the UN Security Council takes the lead upon
@ Bolton SELF-CONSCIOUS might be Separation of Powers strong debate aware the US Constitution puts TO DECLARE WAR on Congress jurisdiction
@AmbBolton ALSO analyzed Pyongyang Ballistic-Missile testing, a provocation though a policy of D√âTENTE and Containment should be implemented
@Bolton THE IRAN question, I am more concerned about inflammatory rhetoric against Israel, addressed Ayatollah Khamenei ; President Rouhani
@Bolton ON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE, sad Ros Lehtinen retirement enforced, believe policy towards Cuba could have been more humane and lawful
@Bolton I‚ÄôVE supported the Nuclear Agreement, world‚Äôs powers dignitaries of proved integrity, IAEA responsible to keep ‚Äòcentrifuges watch‚Äô
@Bolton MANY OF US were wrong about Commandant Fidel Castro, never lifted a finger against US, and he had overwhelming reasons (politically)
@AmbJohnBolton WE COULD have reached a compromise with The Revolutionaries, as King Juan Carlos of Spain intelligently did (too much hatred)

@Warren GOOD EVENING  Senator Warren wishing you a nice weekend rest, some exquisite jokes and delicious gourmet, Mozart music; Billie Joel
@senorrinhatch Wishing you pleasant evening Senator, I know  you are always in the field sharing thoughts with your people, The Constituent
@TheBushCenter PRESIDENT BUSH; LAURA: my prayers for Bush 41, high hopes he is already enjoying perfect health and his magnificent view
@TheBushCenter I MEAN is not Castel Gandolfo but he can see the blue-water and yacht competition-diving like old days, I saw a picture !
@TheBushCenter WORRIED about His Excellency, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Do not even know what went wrong at  Iraq  Mr. president
@TheBushCenter BY THE time General David Petraeus came back to the United States, highest hopes and stability on agenda [?] at Iraq Sir.
@TheBushCenter WE‚ÄôVE not been able to manage Afghanistan;  that is a political blunder at this stage in time, nothing else for the military
@TheBushCenter I NEED TO get my foreign-policy thoughts right, then get into the ring with Ambassador Bolton (an old-days reactionary)
@TheBushCenter THAT because if I use the world conservative, Republicans will object disparity, HIS VIEWS ARE VERY STRONG on foreign policy
@David IT is chilling, we ought to work in public relations, invest in changing anti-Semitic propaganda, talk, negotiate, [MOSSAD friendly]
@AmbDermer DEAR AMBASSADOR DERMER: my humble wording to His Excellency Antonio Guterres seeking consensus on multinational force deplyment
@Dermer  IS TIME we end conflict at Syria &amp; Yemen, to address refugee situation, desperate though much deviance to scope with (inconsistent)
@AmbDermer I DO NOT see neither unilateral capacity nor authority but that of the UN Security Council to bring regional peaceful solution
Dermer I LIKE to request you do put my postulate to Israeli leadership, Syria‚Äôs borders rather nightmare igniting unprecedented instability
@LTC Lerner Colonel Lerner: bringing the prospect of multinational peace-force into Syria &amp; Yemen, please bring it to Israleli Policymakers
@antonioguterres HIS EXCELLENCY, UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres:  Saddened upon frustration, lacking hopes upon endless bloodshed
@Guterres Very conscientious you‚Äôve been trusted to lead the Family of Nations as we witness unmeasured challenges (regional conflicts)
@antonioguterres AWARE you‚Äôve established brining to a close all conflicts, now undermining world peace as your priority agenda Sir.
@antonioguterres EXPERIENCE rather wisdom speaking by itself in the voice of UN Envoy Staffan de Mistura, I believe your secret-weaponry
@antonioguterres I ASKED UN (Security Council) since the scourge of civil war appeared to mediate ordering a None-Fly one on Syrian space
@antonioguterres THAT probably influenced by President Bashar al-Assad enemies then supporting a radical-brutal insurgency "morality" [?]
@ Guterres NOT action taken by UN Council at early stages, my  intentions to limit Bashar military capability forcing negotiation failed
@antonioguterres Bashar trusted ally stepped in, the Russian Federation, by that time conflict escalated igniting displacement situation
@antonioguterres ENVOY MISTURA would agree on complexity of insurgency because of ethnicity; obscure logistic means traced to Washington
@antonioguterres HERE United States Intelligentsia;  some European powers sharing responsibility: unwillingness for ceasefire  recorded
@antonioguterres GENEVA TALKS RATHER myth, inability to compromise upon actor‚Äôs diverse interest: US; EU; Iran; Saudi Arabia; (others)
@antonioguterres WE SHALL put the blame on UN Security Council: disunity and lack of criteria to  bring peace to Iraq; Yemen; Syria ‚Ä¶
@antonioguterres FOR how long could UN bodies enable to provide refugee dehumanizing situation with goods and medicine, my urging  [?]
@antonioguterres POPE FRANCIS  &amp; Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI manifested concern upon refugee assimilation legality, its outrageous Sir.
@antonioguterres NOW matter leading to the International Criminal Court  (ICC) jurisdiction, for it‚Äôs  traumatic to human conscience
@antonioguterres I NOT longer trust insurgency form of resistance within the law at Syria, both sides uses of Chemical  weaponry
@antonioguterres GENEVA Convention proved obsolete not rule of engagement defined it is anarchy still igniting displacement crisis
@antonioguterres On final analysis not unilateral action success insured, US; Russia failed giving rationale to put pressure on Council
@antonioguterres ISUGEST to consult Envoy Mistura... debate multilateral-peace  force at Syria and Yemen to end hostility Excellency
@antonioguterres UPON such prospect, stability depending on participation of all sects &amp; parties, reconstruction unified effort  (nations)

@GenRobertNeller GOOD TO SEE YOU Robert B. Neller (the 37th Commandant of @USMC): unlikely you will have to engage if things come to war
@Gen Neller MY assessment it will be US Navy/ US Air-Force; hopefully political wisdom will prevail and we won‚Äôt have to fight North Korea
@Gen Neller GREAT deal of thought upon Iraq; Yemen; Syria and even Afghanistan, on the last: stability should be accomplished by now General
@GenRobertNeller ANOTHER problem of concern is that Army‚Äôs Intelligence and NAVY must to be 100% accurate, asked JCS to put ours at CIA
@Gen Neller OVERWHELMING global challenges, we do not need another unholy-war General. If adjusted military industrial complex will benefit

@GenRobertNeller MUST TO WISH you  tranquil remains of the night Sir., I SALUTE A COMANDING GENERAL
@ADM  GREAT TO SEE YOU ON SITE Admiral Paul Zukunft (25th Commandant of the USCG): kind of chilling at North Korea-South Korea waters Sir.
@ADM  I HAVE given thought, still need to read Admiral Stavridis assessment, he is experienced and clever upon North Korea secular impulses
@ADMZukunft ON THE final analysis (as a sailor) we do not question political decision, concern is strictly military (strategic) deployment
@ADMZukunft WEARING political-diplomacy suit put question to President Xi Jinping, to mediate upon North Korea aggressive missile-testing
@ADMZukunft MY LAST letter to request provocation be limited also soliciting if continuing South Korea &amp; UN Secretariat must to be informed
@ADM MY strategic assessment  he (kim) will retaliate with military power if we attack missile sites with objective to destroy capability
@ADMZukunft ANOTHER matter is North Korean trust &amp; respect Pyongyang leadership, they will unify nationwide front to fight hostile forces
@ADMZukunft NOT questioning our powerful-bombs devastating effect, morally &amp; legally must to abide by the Roman Statue &amp; Geneva Conventions
@ADMZukunft MEANING we‚Äôre not Adolf Hitler henchmen, at times turned themselves into war-criminals by wiping entire civilian population

@Diana_ POEMA muy significativo de Llorca, pero tu siempre has sido verde como la Mirabal, eso nada ni nadie te lo puede quitar, tu esencia
@Diana_ DE MI te dir√© que cuando te veo de mini-falda no hay raz√≥n ni subterfugios baratos, pues uno solo quiere treparse entre tus ramas
@Diana_Y ESO NUNCA te otorga valor casual ya que siempre para mi es escaparme en tus encantos prohibidos de alborada de mar, lamertela real
@Diana_ SI, PREOCUPA lo del desayuno-almuerzo escolar, podr√≠a pasar con los fondos de la Seguridad Social, incompetencia para administrar
@Diana_ SABES QUE no te puedo escribir usando ese lenguaje vulgarizado-extrovertido en TWITTER, mi email: [ramondejspolanco08@gmail.com].
@ArthurJEdwards GOOD EVENING MR. EDWARDS, How is My Duchess and the Duke doing?, too busy I can see, very busy though, MY AFFECTIONS TO ALL

@NATOpress A TOTAL DIFFERENT look Officer Lungesco, I suppose a Correspondent-Nato's thing, GOOD LUCK UPON dearest
@steven_ HI MR. PIFER: thank you  for educating my intellect, well what can you expect? George Bush now paints his political brain though
@steven_ JUST  remember how difficult for Governor Jeb to be a Bush, then it runs in the family: more difficult to George to play  Bush‚Äô
@steven_pifer HE was Albertico pupil since Texas‚Äôs golden days, TWO OF A KIND, it is a mix: Cubans-Samurais-Soldiers and now even Africans ‚Ä¶
@steven_ I WOULD not have the slightest intention to compete with Monet, Picasso and all impressionism  painters, only a Bush ‚Ä¶ Goodnight!
@RichardHaass HI MR. HASS: You know how little time, I personally wish can read every piece of literature printed, it pays to know SIR
@Haass USED TO love foreign-policy since childhood, that is how we get to know people, by travelling or learning about their politics: LIFE
@Richard I LIKE TO THANK you for sharing, maybe I get lucky and get to read some of your books, the superhighway of the information helps
@IvankaTrump HI IVANKA, whats up?
@wolfblitzer BLITZER: Debating the issues, I wrote to Speaker Ryan, HEALTHCARE should not be seen as a commodity we purchase at NYSE
@wolfblitzer IT'S plan to provide America the Beautiful Healthcare needs at zero-cost, non should have to pay for inalienable right: TO LIVE
@wolfblitzer I MEAN Affordable ACT is complex, before anything it should be studied and analyzed properly, same OBAMACARE
@wolfblitzer RICHEST country IN THE WORLD should be  compassionate and intelligent enough to guarantee free Healthcare nationwide
@wolfblitzer AWARE wealthier families; some middle-class covered for life, they know how to take care of Life; Health (healthcare) insurance
@wolfblitzer MAJOR concern should be the poor, general public, elder citizens without jobs or not longer able to work: USA should provide it
@wolfblitzer THE US SUPREME COURT has given us guidance, US private corporate must to be part of Healthcare planning, as always
@wolfblitzer UPON foreign-policy, hostility in several region: Afghanistan; Syria; Yemen; Iraq which means DOD_JCS will be very busy upon
@wolfblitzer SEE poverty; scarcity and lowest living standards in several nations, migration in Europe, ending conflict means reconstruction
@wolfblitzer GLOBAL SECURITY depending on closing belligerency gap, upon  search for opportunities clear for US will be part of stability
@wolfblitzer STABILITY  is accomplished by ceasefire; electoral suffrage and new government in power, then reconstruction, organization
@RobinMeade HI ROBIN, your Mon and Dad are in great shape, I shall invite then to Stiudio 54, just a few dances, REMEBER THAT TIME?
@wolfblitzer HEY BLITZER: I was late forgot your time at CNN, I see your point though it does not change a thing for I am also a Jew
@wolfblitzer AWARE SOME OF my friends suffer from progressive blindness, it is historical for they could not see an enemy in Hitler
@wolfblitzer I SHALL honor the generals legacy and sacrifice, David Ben Gurion; Barak; Ya‚Äôalon ‚Ä¶ I learn from obsolete policies (evidently)
@wolfblitzer WE TRIED the Honorable PM Netanyahu ideas, they have not worked as expected, TWO STATE solution gives us moral and legal ground
@wolfblitzer I SHALL write utmost sincerity, otherwise not even the generals would respect my views and persona: WE‚ÄôRE STILL LEARNING
@LTCPeterLerner COLONEL, remember to keep an eye on General Barak and General Ya'alon, they might need some fresh wine and grapes at times
@geula_even YOU KNOW my Hebrew is not poor upon its language definition it is inexistent for I can only say Moses; Moses when in need
@geula_even YOU‚ÄôRE as gorgeous as the women who loved King Solomon in the Bible, those eyes are the eyes of the dew turned into emeralds
@geula_even PROMISE to learn to write and speak your language someday sooner, that way can whisper love songs in the distance dear
@TzipiHotovely HELLO, UN hostile teritory these days, not wine and roses at Syria; Iraq; Yemen ... Wish you all wisdom and support from UN
@bogie_yaalon MINISTER Moshe Ya‚Äôalon: I would say shame on me, could have spent more time learning of Lessing J. Rosenwald lectures
@_yaalon I HAVE NOT doubt he was David Ben-Gurion master upon the Jewish question on the aftermath of WWII; displacement and the new-land
@bogie_yaalon GOOD thing it is all documented, today‚Äôs decisions cannot be taken without getting his clever advice General Ya‚Äôalon
@Elharrar HI, you know General Barak and DM LIberman never took the time to teach me Hebrew language: THAT IS NOT FAIR, Sosua speaks English
@AvigdorLiberman MINISTER OF DEFENSE LIBERMAN: I truly believe in order to accomplish our ends the TWO STATES solution must to be debated
@AvigdorLiberman I LIKE TO THINK Palestinian have imagination and conscientious of their rights to become member of the United Nations
@Liberman I SEE to our advantage, an institutionalized  State upon recognition will have to abide by International Law like everyone else
@LibermanI BELIEVE we must to think like Palestinian, in order to understand their demands, which were our demands decades ago Dear Minister
@AvigdorLiberman LIKE YOU to discuss why were not unilateral actions taken by Israel to prevent Rwanda‚Äôs  genocide? The UN;US; EU; NATO knew
@Liberman DO NOT think any UN Security Council would find neither moral justification nor legal ground to question Israel motifs (if acted).
@netanyahu PRIME MINISTER: I see your government promoting Jerusalem, the Holy City or the City of David ‚Ä¶ do not think there is objection
@netanyahu TRULY believe Israel shall guarantee the entire world access to the sacred temple‚Äîfor it does belong to mankind‚Äî, not doubt about
@netanyahu ALSO like to consider the TWO STATES solution, Palestinian won‚Äôt have interest in any proposal denying  their inalienable rights
@netany  POINT after analysis, we cannot abrogate their rights to live under United Nations blanket‚Äîit gives reason to deny Israel‚Äôs rights
@manuelvalls MR. VALLS, much we have learnt, lot still hanging in the political arena we shall understand: GREAT TO SEE YOU ON MY SITE SIR.
@Schulz 	DISTINGUISHED Martin Schulz: It is inconsistent with Great Britain tradition though the will of the people must to be respected
@MartinSchulz I RATHER to blame it on our dear friend David Cameron, he did not sell his viewpoint to gain expected support, more intense
@MartinSchulz DIVIDED, for the entire country seems to differ upon referendum equilibrium, balancing the vote 50-5 and it shall rule Sir.
@MartinSchulz THE WAY  I saw we won‚Äôt have Her Majesty the Queen (Elizabeth) guidance forever, the future uncertain as rational thought
@MartinSchulz I WANTED  United Kingdom to count and play at the European Union as vital tribune for the British citizens, many contingencies
@MartinSchulz I AM CONFIDENT in Charles Prince of Wales, experienced and very much brought-up at her Majesty side, he is not Elizabeth II
@MartinSchulz STILL, my empiric lessons upon  Charles V of Spain death, is that the country fell into weeping-valley sorrows, impoverished ‚Ä¶
@LTCPeter COLONEL LERNER: I was under perception that Intelligentsia would unfold ISIS financial network, that aware of the USJCS-Coalition
@LTCPeter I DO NOT think we will enjoy peace while the scourge of war and instability continue igniting displacement at Syria; Iraq; Yemen
@Ford CONFESS Have not driven a Ford Mustang, not lately though the dream of having the key on my hand rather enviable luxury and opportune
@georginadulucr HOLA TU, la siempre increiblemente sensual y bella, mucho tiempo si desde la ultima vez que pasaste pero poco, poco olvido
@Pontifex_es SU SANTIDAD: Sus libros por doquier, tengo que dedicarle tiempo por lo menos para descubrir sus frases celebres, sus escritos
@Pontifex_es PERO LE CONFIESO ESTOY muy atrasado pues todav√≠a no he concluido mis estudios sobre Juan Pablo el Grande, INMENSIDAD PAPAL
@Pontifex_es MIS oraciones para Su Eminencia y el Papa Emeritus Benedicto XVI, cada d√≠a reconozco cuanto aun nos falta por hacer
@Silverman HI ADORABLE, I do not have to write, you know me as I know who you are, we do what we must my lady, miss you though: ALL MY LOVE
@PrivOfSelena YOU never confirmed your mailbox letters, so I do no know what's on your mind baby, does not matter you are deep inside pretty
@Priv I do  not know what that means, wrote to you a thousand times &amp;  you did not answer, I can be a magician; read your mind only twice
@LanaDelRey Hi Lana, I am not sure if itis you, wrote to you several times and a lady answer once it was not your portal, just like to know
@RealEs YOUR MAJESTIES, wishing you both a happy Sunday, hope princesses are fine enjoying spring breeze, me like the usual: Politics ..
@La WELL I MISS My Queen authentic personality; those divine attributes that puts her in highest pedestal among planet Earth queens [ha, ha]
@Real IT IS rather fascinating, My Queen a supermodel, enchanted beauty; admired fashion &amp; respected: REASONS FOR MY KING TO BE PROUD
@bib_ PRIME MINISTER, I wrote to President Abbas about THE TWO STATE solution, I really think  you should put that in priority agenda
@bib_YOU  do not think best course but the Palestinian can never trust Israel if continuing similar antagonistic pattern: TWO-NATIONS
@bib_ I explained to you Sir. Moment they are ratified at State under the UN Chapter, they are obliged to respect International Law (HAMAS)
@cuba_ BUENOS DIAS Presidente Castro; de vuelta a Sierra Maestra ‚Ä¶ son tantos los episodios aun en la sombra de los misterios pol√≠ticos ‚Ä¶
@cuba_raul1 	YO PERSONALMENTE pienso la historia no se puede escribir por completo mientras queden dudas sobre los hechos indisputables
@cuba_DEBE conocer de Jennifer Lawrence en una cinta cinematogr√°fica sobre la vida de Marita Lorenz, es un documento cual debe arrojar luz
@cuba_HOLLYWOOD a veces toma la delantera para educar intelecto, no se si en realidad tienen acceso a los documentos de Seguridad del Estado
@cuba_CREO conveniente prestarle ayuda, as√≠ se somete al escrutinio competitivo (debate) cualquier cuestionamiento cient√≠fico o especulativo
@cuba_raul1 NO SE  aun que paso con Celia Mandaley y Marita; p√≠ldoras de la CIA y que realmente sucedi√≥, le confeso al Comandante su pecado?
@cuba_OTRO episodio es el intento de golpe General Cantillo,  David Phillips estaba en La Habana (Phillips &amp; Associates)-Allen Dulles ‚Äúman‚Äù
@cuba_ FRANK STURGIS, quien estuvo en Dallas y Watergate, el enamoro a Marita y esta detr√°s de su salida de Cuba (Dulles-Phillips-Sturgis)
@cuba_SU apoyo a la guerrilla, CIA y Lansky financiaron parte de las armas canalizadas hasta la Sierra,  debe haber detalle sobre Phillips
@cuba_ SOLDADOS EE.UU. peleando en la Sierra con ustedes, esos documentos de vital relevancia para entender claramente origen de discordia
@cuba_ HO CHI MINH y el General Vo N. Giap tambi√©n estuvieron ligados al General Willian Donovan (OSS) y despu√©s se dividieron (similar).
@cuba_ HAY UN incidente muy peligroso que quiero la Corte Suprema de EE. UU. lo estudie, (infamita). Entrevista con Comandante Fidel Castro
@cuba_SUPUESTAMENTE para ser transmitida a las 8 de la noche (hora del Flight 800/NY-Paris). Alguien se puso nervioso en Langley, lo exploto
@cuba_raul1 YO NO TENGO DUDA, pero me parece que se uso al NAVY en New York City, 200 testigos vieron el misil desde la playa
@cuba_raul1 	ADEMAS Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. denuncio el hecho, parece que alguien en CIA se indign√≥ y le comunico lo sucedido
@cuba_raul1 ESE hecho contra ciudadanos norteamericanos es un acto de traici√≥n que no puede pasar desapercibido, puede ocurrir de nuevo (¬ø?)
@cuba_GUSTARIA entrevista en Cuba Visi√≥n, as√≠ el pueblo americano (√∫nico due√±o de  su destino  e historia) puede saber que realmente sucedi√≥
@tramp_donald1 GOOD MORNING MR. PRESIDENT, I do not see Health Care fight as lost cause or set-back, we must to find proper remedy not doubt
@tramp_I DO  have my objection as some reporters approach, it is neither Republican nor Democrat but rather the American people defiance

@DalayLamaRussia GOOD MORNING TO THE DALAI LAMA, greetings and complete harmony as you praise the Lord Jesus for all of us, MUCH suffering
@Dalai I AM beginning to think ancient policymakers intelligentextraordinary, we ended WWI-WWII and cannot even get to a close Afghanistan
@Dalai I THINK IT IS time we put those human-financial resources to good deeds, mush hunger, scarcity, division, secular struggle multiplies
@hassanrouhani_1 GOOD MORNING PRESIDENT ROUHANI, my regards to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, great concern on YEMEN
@hassanrouhani_1 I DID WRITE to King Salman and requested humanitarian aid to the EC, still we must to work on ceasefire to hold hostilities
@hassanrouhani_1 KING SALMAN and the Coalition are conscientious such airstrikes have caused death and devastation: NOT GOOD FROM
@hassanrouhani_1 I DO NOT know if can contact members of the Insurgency, it is another complex battlefield, we ought to end bloodshed though
@Abbas_ GOOD MORNING PRESIDENT Mahmoud Abbas: little worried about the Gaza Strip, and that aware that the West-Bank has being privileged
@Abbas_ I STILL believe HAMAS &amp; FATAH must to come together, only way to serve the Palestinian people  needs enriching conciliatory bonds
@Abbas_ I HAVE concluded a personal vision upon TWO STATE SOLUTION, that aware every community on Earth shall enjoy universal granted rights
Abbas_ ISRAEL leadership conscientious, as long as denial is sponsored, there won‚Äôt be slightest common grounds or interest for discussion:
@JapanImpire YOUR Majesties, overwhelmed by your distinction, your most humble wish the both of you peace &amp; harmony as spring garden blooms
@JapanImpire I AM NOT surprised by such incidental, it is her behavior pattern, can see her from  thousand mile and read her cognitive ...

@MID_RF –ú–ò–î –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏: you know it was important to improve my intellect by learning Hebrew, that as first step to understand Moses-Exodus
@MID_RF AND NOW, Russian language is more like back-wording shackle difficult to adjust, impossible to get rid-off (ha, ha), art and Symbol
@MID_RF GERMAN Chancellor Merkel thought by this time I would be mastering German literature better than Field-General Erwin Rommel
@MID_RF AND Xi Jinping, uh well! He knew I was not privileged by Albert Einstein and Mark Zuckerberg cognitive substance for languages
@MID_RF I WANTED the Russian leadership to unwrap everything there is on the Missile Crisis, meetings and decision-making, Nikita K-Jack K
@MID_RF WITHOUT those documents we cannot apply for neither master nor doctorate on the Missile Crisis Sir., not yet and that is important
@MID_RF AWARE there was some material (KGB) declassified following Soviet Union decline, still most remaining in darkness to this very day
@margaritacdf PLACER VERLE VICEPRESIDENTA: SUPONGO debo conectarme a PAMELA, para mi es siempre parte de DON FREDDY; Y Punto.
@PoliciaRD POLIC√çA NACIONAL RD: Mayor General Peguero; General B√°ez Aybar; Generales; Oficiales; Subalternos; amigos y colaboradores
@PoliciaRD 81 A√±OS de Labor Policial es largo tiempo y de las experiencias acumuladas‚ÄîBUENAS Y MALAS‚Äîforjamos un mejor y m√°s decente futuro
@PoliciaRD  A VECES rebusco en an√°lisis, explicaci√≥n a vertiente politiquera, pero sabidur√≠a radica en apegarse fielmente a LA CONSTITUCION
@Diana_Lora HOLA MI AMIGA ADORADA: aqu√≠ perdido en mi entusiasmo al ver un video del Senador Cesar Valent√≠n sobre Minerva Mirabal
@Diana_Lora SEG√öN sus an√©cdotas hoy cumplir√≠a 91 a√±itos, y es uno de esos episodios hist√≥ricos tristes,  DE LOS QUE NUNCA debieron suceder
@Diana_ DESCRIBE rasgos enfermizos del s√°trapa, le arranco la chapa de general√≠simo y lo tr√°nco en la 40, si alguna vez tuviera mando Diana
@Diana_ DECISION solamente se puede explicar dentro de lo irracional; es una ponzo√±a tan hiriente que lo esfumar√≠a para juzgarlo (cobarde).
@Diana_ AUNQUE SI,  el general y el mocano en la avenida; El Teniente con agallas de general√≠simo y cay√≥ en su charco acostumbrado Mujer
@Diana_Lora GRACIAS por pasar, sabes tienes tantos rasgos de Minerva, retratos que no desmienten durante su juventud, tu acicate el de ella
@Diana UN BESO en la mejilla y sue√±os bonitos, yo tengo tu √∫ltima imagen de EN ESTA MISMA SEMANA en mi mente amiga bella, hasta la pr√≥xima
@eucopresident GOOD EVENING PRESIDENT TUSK: Happy looking at the new EC imposing structure: Magnificent Architecture!
@eucopresident SAD Mr. Schulz is resuming position, well he will be close by from other important office‚ÄîNOT DOUBT ABOUT
@eucopresident I WANTED to remind you of Syria; Yemen; Iraq and now The Balkan unrest, migration major defiance; terrorism as well
@euco  LITTLE worry upon domestic issues, ‚Äúthey‚Äù did not solve the ‚Äú20 million theory‚Äù problem, not yet, it is rather an injustice  Sir.
@eucopresident PLEASE DO keep watch (ESA-NASA), I do not want none sharing responsibility on such immorality, to serve from public office
@eucopresident I KNOW our respected Chancellor Angela 	Merkel developed an intuition for counting votes upon ‚Äúcritic‚Äù circumstances
