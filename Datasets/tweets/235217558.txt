RT @SXMPOTUS: Tonight on The Big Picture with @OKnox:	@SenCoryGardner says the US should consider expanding pressure against North Korea.‚Ä¶
Decreasing pressure without concrete steps toward denuclearization by Kim Jong Un‚Äôs regime is a step in the wrong direction.
Maximum pressure means that we must utilize every tool at our disposal in equal measure‚Äîeconomic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and robust military posture‚Äîto achieve our goal of complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.
The reason why these exercises are necessary is because of North Korea‚Äôs historically hostile behavior and repeated violations of international law.
I oppose any steps toward normalization without denuclearization of the North Korean regime‚Äîthe United States should not sacrifice joint military readiness with our allies to appease Kim Jong Un.	https://t.co/kIFwd4pkq2

Therefore, ARIA establishes &amp; provides new resources for a long-term strategy to enhance security cooperation with our allies; to promote American businesses through trade opportunities; &amp; to project American values of democracy, human rights, &amp; the rule of law in the region.
ARIA is important because the Indo-Pacific is home to half of the world‚Äôs population &amp; GDP, the world‚Äôs largest standing armies, &amp; six US defense treaty allies. The security &amp; economic future of the US depends on having the right policies to ensure a free &amp; open Indo-Pacific.
After years of bipartisan work, ARIA is now headed to the President‚Äôs desk to be signed into law. This crucial legislation - endorsed by the Administration, policy experts, and the business community - will ensure the US remains the leading Pacific power for generations to come.
I urge President Trump to immediately halt any plans to withdraw US troops from Syria and to consult with Congress on a long-term Syria strategy that protects US national interests and denies a win for Vladimir Putin, Bashar al-Assad, and the Iranian mullahs.
The US is the only global power able to stop Russia, Iran, &amp; their terrorist proxies in Syria from total control of a region vital to national security. We've made significant progress in our fight against ISIS but the fight isn't over, &amp; a US withdrawal will embolden bad actors.

Today marks one month until #LWCF‚Äôs funding expires. It is critical that the crown jewel of conservation programs receives permanent reauthorization of its funding before September 30th.
I hope Kim Jong Un will come to his senses and fulfill the promise he made. I remain committed to a peaceful resolution but will not allow the United States to be fooled again.
North Korea must also know that while the US &amp; its partners are seeking to solve this crisis peacefully, we will not hesitate to defend the US homeland, our troops in the region, and our treaty allies, with overwhelming military force.
This means imposing additional unilateral sanctions against the NK regime and ensuring that our American military presence on the Korean peninsula is maintained at current troop levels. We must also continue to coordinate our NK policy closely with Seoul and Tokyo.
We can all be pleased that NK hasn‚Äôt conducted any recent missile tests, but this doesn't mean the Kim regime is on the path towards complete, verifiable, irreversible, denuclearization. The US must immediately resume a complete maximum pressure campaign against North Korea.
As I said here yesterday, I applaud Sec. Mattis for announcing we will resume military exercises with South Korea. The US engaged in a good-faith effort after the Singapore summit while North Korea, once again, did not.

Russia is officially responsible for a chemical weapons attack against a NATO member state on its own soil ‚Äî a brazen violation of sovereignty of our closest ally. It requires a serious American response.
Earlier this year, the Kremlin had crossed yet another previously unimaginable line, when it used a military-grade nerve agent to poison a former Russian intelligence agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury.
Russia has invaded its neighbors Georgia &amp; Ukraine, it supports the murderous Assad regime &amp; our enemies in Afghanistan, &amp; it is engaged in active information warfare against Western democracies, including meddling in the 2016 United States elections.

The only ‚Äòreset‚Äô we can have with Russia is when it completely reverses course and begins to act in accordance with civilized norms and international law. Nothing should change as of today ‚Äì Putin‚Äôs Russia is not a friend to the United States.
I encourage the Administration to avoid the mistakes of past Administrations in normalizing relations with Russia at zero cost to Putin and his regime.
Additionally, I will continue to support maximum economic sanctions on Russia, including the full implementation of the Countering America‚Äôs Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that passed the Senate by a vote of 98-2.
I believe Russia is a state sponsor of terror and I‚Äôve introduced legislation that would mandate the State Department to determine whether Russia merits this designation, along with their allies Iran and Syria that are already designated.
Whether it be chemical attacks on our allied soil, the invasion of Ukraine, propping up the murderer Assad in Syria, or meddling in our elections through cyber-attacks, Vladimir Putin‚Äôs Russia remains an adversary to the United States.
Earlier this week I spoke on the Senate floor &amp; a National Parks subcommittee hearing about the importance of Congress passing the Restore Our Parks Act.

Today I joined 11 of my colleagues in sending a letter calling on the Administration to halt current policies leading to the forced separation of minor children from their parents, who are illegally entering the US, &amp; to allow Congress to fix the issue through legislation.
I was one of only two Republican Senators who voted for every single immigration reform measure that the Senate voted on earlier this year, and it is time we find a solution to the problems at the border.
Our immigration system is broken &amp; the separation of children at our southern border shows just how critical it is that Congress pass immigration reform immediately. Children should not be penalized for the actions of their parents, &amp; that‚Äôs exactly what is happening right now.

I'll be joining @TubbsShow on 710KNUS at 5:30pm MT today to discuss the latest on North Korea. Be sure to tune in here: https://t.co/hY7hLW9I9L
We must verify BEFORE we trust. The stakes are high. @POTUS can change the course of history, but it must be done through a position of strength and be consistent with long-standing U.S. policy and national security goals. 11/11
Kim Jong Un must know that we will not hesitate to protect the U.S. homeland, our troops in the region, and our treaty allies, with overwhelming military force, if necessary. 10/11
In the meantime, as I wrote in my letter yesterday with my colleagues on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee, sanctions and joint military exercises w/ our allies must continue.	https://t.co/zPfjhOsZqc	9/11
As a starting point for any negotiations, we must demand that the regime adheres to the commitments it has already made to the United States to denuclearize, and has since repeatedly violated. 8/11
My new bipartisan bill, the LEED Act, would impose an economic embargo on North Korea and its enablers, wherever they are based. You can read more about it here: https://t.co/OaTnLg9Nab	7/11
The maximum pressure campaign that my legislation started, and President Trump has continued, has brought us to this point today. Now we need to keep up the pressure and negotiate from a position of strength. 6/11
But we haven‚Äôt received any of these commitments from North Korea to date. 5/11
Per U.S. law, the President must demand that NK make significant progress toward complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization &amp; comply with all UN Security Council Resolutions before any sanctions relief or normalization of relations with NK can be considered. 4/11
This legislation, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act, was signed into law in February 2016. It now forms the basis of the maximum pressure campaign against North Korea. The law sets a high bar for any lifting of sanctions on North Korea. See below. 3/11 https://t.co/H1MUWHygI4
As Chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee focused on East Asia policy, I held a series of hearings and began working on legislation that would require mandatory sanctions on the regime and would set parameters for U.S. policy toward North Korea. 2/11
THREAD: When I was sworn in to the Senate in 2015, I referred to Kim Jong Un as the ‚ÄúForgotten Maniac‚Äù. At the time, few were paying attention to the grave threat posed by NK to the US and our allies, while the Obama Admin. followed a failing policy of ‚Äústrategic patience‚Äù. 1/11
I sent a letter to the President today urging him to continue his maximum pressure campaign &amp; I do not think this announcement should change US resolve until DPRK takes concrete steps toward full denuclearization. You can read my full letter here: https://t.co/zPfjhOsZqc	3/3
Kim Jong Un must take concrete steps toward total denuclearization and President Trump must demand it. 2/3
The price of admission for a meeting between @POTUS and Kim Jong Un must be the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. 1/3

While this statement of intent from North Korea is a positive development, we have been down this road before, so we need to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past that have led us to the crisis today. https://t.co/uuBoLCyrXV

I hope a future Administration reverses this dangerous course &amp; puts the Iranian regime under pressure necessary to truly change behavior.
Iran has funded terror. Iran will continue to fund terror. Now, however, they have billions more to do it with.
Soleimani is responsible for supplying IEDs to Iraqi insurgents to kill Americans.
Notably, Iran recently violated U.N. travel restrictions by sending abroad Qassem Soleimani, a known terrorist &amp; Iranian General.
Just since this deal was announced, Iran has conducted multiple illegal ballistic missile tests. They've held American sailors at gunpoint.
The Administration seems convinced that endless concessions to Iran will provoke a behavior change. That has proven to be laughably false.
Groups funded by Iran have killed innocents in Syria. They've killed Israelis. They've killed Americans.
Many of us warned money released to the Iranian regime would fund terror. Sec. Kerry has now admitted as much. https://t.co/Am0OLTkMW2

If the Administration won't respond to an illegal ballistic missile test, how can we trust that they can hold Iran to a nuclear deal? (4/4)
That's no response at all, and it's totally unacceptable. (3/4)
.@AmbassadorPower responded that the Administration has "increased the political cost to Iran" by talking about the issue at the U.N. (2/4)
At a Foreign Relations hearing today, I asked @AmbassadorPower for the Administration's response to Iran testing a ballistic missile. (1/4)
It‚Äôs time for the Administration to respond to Iranian belligerence. Inaction is no longer an option. https://t.co/JX0JLSFKa1
Given recent behavior, I have no confidence that Iran will abide by the terms of the nuclear deal. https://t.co/9plfxgyU4n
We were told to trust the Obama Admin. could hold Iran accountable. But their engagement policy with Iran proving to be dangerous farce.
Obama Admin has been stunningly indifferent. Iran violated UN travel sanctions (Gen. Soleimani). Violated ballistic missile test ban.
We warned Iran would take sanctions relief and build up their arsenal, prop up Assad, &amp; arm terror groups. They've done exactly that.
When @POTUS was pursuing his misguided nuclear deal, many of us warned that Iran would cheat. Happening already. https://t.co/9plfxgyU4n

I‚Äôve heard from thousands of Coloradans who are tired of Obamacare's broken promises. It's time for a new approach.
This misguided law, Obamacare, is a weight around the neck of our nation's economy, and it's doing little to make us healthier.
Obamacare's cost controls were a myth. So was the idea that the law would increase choice. They join the myth that you could keep your plan.
This chaos and these rising costs are exactly what the people of Colorado were promised Obamacare would prevent. A broken promise.
Premiums continue to increase. The CO-OP established by Obamacare collapsed, taking thousands of plans &amp; tens of millions in taxpayer loans.
Within just the past few weeks, Coloradans have seen and endured some of the worst consequences of Obamacare.

Large bipartisan majorities in both the House and the Senate, reflecting the will of the American people, support #KeystoneXL.

I plan to support @SenJoniErnst's resolution of disapproval of the #WOTUS rule.
It's time for Congress to act. But a partisan minority blocked a bill to make significant, commonsense revisions to the #WOTUS rule today.
It's no secret that the EPA works slowly. Water projects in Colorado already languish in the approval process. #WOTUS will make it worse.

Disgraceful that Senate Democrats just denied American people a voice in one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of our time.
The Administration is promising to defend our allies in the Middle East from the very guns and missiles that their deal will hand to Iran.
The only element of bipartisanship on the floor of the Senate today is in opposition to this bad deal with the Iranian regime.
Why does Iran need ballistic missiles and conventional small arms to produce isotopes for medical purposes? This deal gives those to them.
When did a bad option before the United States Senate become the only option? Why should we accept second best? #BadIranDeal
The President said "The deal we'll accept is, they end their nuclear program. It's very straightforward."		But the deal we got is not.

Iran already violating UN sanctions &amp; ignoring portions of #IranDeal. Raises major questions about deal's viability. http://t.co/al1i6ENCHm
My letter to Pres. Obama asking for Administration's plan to hold Iran accountable for violations already committed: http://t.co/al1i6F5dyU
The fundamental issue of Iran Deal: Far too reliant on "compliance" of a terror-funding, murderous regime with American blood on its hands.
Iran can "comply" with nuclear deal, violate arms embargo repeatedly, and yet embargo &amp; sanctions lifted over time. http://t.co/U3KU3C7APo
Iranian actions highly concerning. As is Administration's response: Sec. Kerry says arms embargo violations do not cause sanction snapbacks.
Theoretically, agreement prevents Iranian ballistic missile tests. Iran claims this isn't binding. They go forward. http://t.co/gO1mcrs2sz
Soleimani's travel not sole issue. Iranian media reports the regime will conduct ballistic missile tests this year. http://t.co/gO1mcrs2sz
Soleimani traveling in defiance of UN sanctions raises questions about Iranian compliance with proposed nuclear deal. http://t.co/EUBG0jY7KL
Iran is said to be responsible for around 500 US military deaths in Iraq. Soleimani led Iran's efforts to supply Iraqi insurgents.

Right to keep and bear arms is cherished by millions of Americans. Depriving military recruiters of that right is totally counterproductive.
A sidearm ban does nothing to keep military recruiters safe, and instead disarms the very people best qualified to help avert a tragedy.
Our military men &amp; women are among the most skilled firearms users in the world. Prohibiting them from carrying sidearms makes no one safer.
Proud to cosponsor @SteveDaines SEMPER FI Act, which would allow military to arm officers at recruiting stations. A nonsensical prohibition.

UN-first gambit an affront to Congress' Constitutional role &amp; the Iran Nuclear Review Act signed by President Obama. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
Until Congress votes, the United States has not agreed to a deal. Administration should have waited to go to the UN. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
Going to the U.N. before the U.S. Congress is a grave mistake on the part of the Obama Administration. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
Retweet if you think the Iran deal should be approved first by the U.S. Congress - not the United Nations. http://t.co/oDiHUkX2kq
Read my full statement on the United Nations vote on Iran today: http://t.co/E7mLgKFGkC
Congress must fully review this agreement before the Administration grants Iran those concessions.
The Iranian regime has waited years for a lifted arms embargo, allowing them to buy more weapons for Hamas and Hezbollah to aim at Israel.
The Iranian regime has waited years to receive the billions in frozen offshore accounts which they can use to fund international terror.
The Iranian regime has waited years for the international nuclear legitimacy which the Obama Administration seems determined to grant them.
The American people &amp; representatives in Congress have 60 days to review this deal, agreed to in the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.
Coming on the heels of the Administration's seemingly endless concession-granting to the Iranians in Vienna, this UN action is unacceptable.
The Administration pattern: mislead the Congress, avoid the American people, and use extraconstitutional actions to advance their Iran deal.
I condemn the Administration‚Äôs decision to take their Iran deal to the UN before the US Congress in the strongest possible terms.
Today's UN vote sets the stage for sanctions against Iran to be lifted and Iran‚Äôs considerable ledger of past violations to be wiped clean.
Seemingly, the Administration would rather run to UN bureaucrats for rubber-stamp approval than make the case for their deal on its merits.
The Administration‚Äôs decision to take the Iran nuclear agreement to the UN before the US Congress is a grave mistake.

Section of the #IranDeal on inspections. Sound like the "Anywhere, Anytime" inspections the Administration promised? http://t.co/LntH7GqhUv
Iran sponsors terror worldwide. Against America, Israel, others. What will they do with billions in sanctions relief? With no arms embargo?
Iranian-backed militias have killed Americans in Iraq. Iran backs the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad in Syria.
Great to see New Horizons, with Colorado technology from Boulder, Littleton, Longmont, and elsewhere, reach Pluto. http://t.co/GYrYQw2f7T
The Administration's false choice - either support their bad deal or be in favor of war in the Middle East - must be rejected categorically.
This deal is an accommodation of a regime whose President proudly walks in front of parades chanting "Death to America" &amp; "Death to Israel".
Sanctions relief in this deal would give Iran billions to pour directly into their network of international terrorist organizations.
This deal would make Iran a globally-approved nuclear threshold state. It would put Israel in severe danger.
Deal lifts the arms embargo against Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terror. And the more detail we learn, the worse it seems.

The American people deserve to know what the Obama Administration knows about the #OPMHack, and precisely what they're doing about it.
There's ample precedent. In 2014, DoJ indicted 5 PLA officers for cyber espionage. Take a similar approach on #OPMHack
WH Exec Order 13694 can impose sanctions against entities which threaten US NatSec or economic/financial health via cyber. Use it. #OPMHack
And what is the plan to prevent the next #OPMHack? It's been months. The American people deserve to know.
What is the plan to hold the individuals or entities who perpetrated the #OPMHack accountable? Indictments? Sanctions?
Has the #OPMHack been raised with the PRC‚Äôs ambassador to the US? Was it raised at the US-China Strategic &amp; Economic dialogue last month?
If China is involved, as suggested in reports, what diplomatic efforts is the Administration taking? If none, why? What's the delay?
What does the Administration know about who hacked our government? Are they ever planning on informing Americans?
How soon after the breach did the administration ID the perpetrators and/or state sponsors? Why don‚Äôt we know this already?
Missing on #OPMHack? Discussion of the perpetrators. Admin officials go on background with reporters to accuse China. Publicly? Nothing.
The Administration now, after 3 months, says 22 million are affected. Other reports put the number higher. A massive, unprecedented breach.
The Obama Administration response to the #OPMHack has been lacking on multiple fronts.

Even if Obamacare was perfectly authored, a government takeover of healthcare would be the wrong prescription for America.

TPP offers us a chance to write American rules for international trade. Rules emphasizing transparency, the rule of law, and human rights.
TPP comes down to a question: Do we want the United States or do we want China writing the rules of international trade in the Asia-Pacific?
If we fail to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a rising China will fill the vacuum left by a lack of American leadership in Asia.
Senator Gardner is speaking now on the Senate floor on trade and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. http://t.co/o5mXkQlBFV

The administration must negotiate a good trade deal and bring it before Congress &amp; the American people for a full public vetting and a vote.
Free trade enhances America‚Äôs standing in the world, builds stronger alliances with our friends, and puts economic pressure on our rivals.
TPA gives Congress authority to approve high-quality trade deals that create jobs &amp; put more ‚ÄòMade in the USA‚Äô goods on shelves overseas.

So many made Clarence a part of their family, giving him a helping hand, their time &amp; love. In return, Clarence always gave CO his love too
Clarence impacted many capitol-goers &amp; will be missed by all who had the opportunity to serve w/ him (unofficially as the 101st legislator!)
There weren't many days that went by that I didn't learn something from Clarence http://t.co/lvBdeqJfpi http://t.co/syJy3K1tbN
