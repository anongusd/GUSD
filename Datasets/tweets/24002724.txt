...but gave him the opp to show his depth, attention to detail &amp; thinking behind decisions. That's useful for reporters, and isn't "news" in a newsy sense, and it's stuff he wouldn't ever say in public not because it's untrue, but because it's introspection, not public interest.
@Steigerworld Another example of good use of OTR, for example: we would hold then with President Bush, and he hated public navel-gazing about how he was doing as president, how he made decisions, some context behind discussions.  Nothing that would change the course of history...
@Steigerworld I do think one problem is a lot of people say "off the recrod"  when they really mean "on background", meaning, I'd love for you print this, but it didn't come from me!  That's not OTR.  OTR is you can't do anything with what I've told you.
@Real_RobRossi That's100% right -- all sourcing is ON THE RECORD unless both sides agree that it's background, OTR, or whatever.
@Steigerworld you would want to pull in a handful of reporter and give them a full briefing off the record or embargoes, so that when the story runs they know what they're talking about.
@Steigerworld OTR can be a very useful tool to help a reporter write a more thorough story.   can come up with a bunch of examples, but here's a couple.  If you're going to announce a complex policy change -- like removing troops from Syria, for example...

The Patriots are behind and yet they‚Äôre running the ball.   I didn‚Äôt know that was allowed.
Yeah, that Boswell kick.  But #7‚Äôs grounding on the previous play is one of the dumbest plays.  The kicker has the yips.  Roethlisberger has no excuses.

This isn't a call to restrain capitalism, to protect markets or hobble free markets. But if we love capitalism, and understand that its dynamism is the only way to elevate standards of living, then we have to commit to helping people understand it and be dynamic themselves. 4/4
Financial capital doesn't need education and health care to thrive.  Fixed capital, like factories, don't break down from despair.  All capital needs its own care, but ignoring the needs of human capital doesn't make you a better capitalist.  It makes you a dumb capitalist.  3/4
...We have to communicate much better, but it's not merely a communications problem.  We also need to understand that capitalism's sharpest edges need rounding.  When the capital is HUMAN capital we need humane policies.  2/4

5/5) I don‚Äôt care what bowl game Pitt goes to, but they need to win it.  I do t care who they play or where, but they need a winning record to go with the CD championship.  It‚Äôll be rough going in recruiting without it.
4/5) Disappointed with the expectation that their offensive talent can beat Miami/ND/PSU playing straight up ‚Äî the defensive talent on those teams is much better, so need much more creative offense game plan.  (But very hard to do w/o more &amp; better weapons.)
3/5) Disagree re Pickett - he played like a rookie because he is one &amp; has very mediocre talent to throw to ‚Äî especially no TEs!  (#2 is great) And as good as the O-line is at run-blocking, they‚Äôre awful at pass protection‚Äî he was under constant pressure. Not bailing on him.
