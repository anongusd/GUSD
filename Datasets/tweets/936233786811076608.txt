The “learn to code” memes are a shot at journalists, meaning that if programmers and journalists switched roles, the programmers would be fluent in journalism within a month, but journalists could not learn code because many are unintelligent https://t.co/Y7KIlAhvQ6
Sen. Sanders doesn’t understand that hard work pays off because he has never worked hard in his life and still has all the payoff. He believes that free college and health care will allow everyone to live like him, with 3 homes and millions spent on private air travel https://t.co/wlkyzteZjZ

Federal and state funding, accounting for about 50% of a school’s budget, are based on population and class size. Local funding, however, depends on taxes paid. White-majority areas generally pay more in income and property taxes than minority-majority areas https://t.co/uZU9lveNgD
Insurance companies use credit score to evaluate the risk of a policy lapse. Not getting paid hurts the company, so people more likely to not pay are charged more to compensate for added risk.

Also, the men and women in congress whom are elected to understand and vote on proposed bills have definitely read the outrageous Green New Deal
- Democrats don’t want to hold a vote on the Green New Deal because they know it’s unpopular		- The Green New Deal would cost 93 trillion dollars, kill all livestock, outlaw planes &amp; cars, and require the retrofitting of every building		- These facts make it easy to refute https://t.co/SnW170zt1t

Bernie Sanders genuinely believes that raising corporate taxes to an insane rate will not force large corporations out of the US. It’s amazing how little the left understands about economics

In the quest for equality, America has reached a point at which the once oppressed minority is given a higher status than the vast majority
The media is all over @SenFeinstein’s opposition to the Green New Deal because she’s a democrat who can think for herself. If @SenSanders told republican kids that he was anti-gun, not a single outlet would report it
Elizabeth Warren, after already losing much of America’s trust through lies, has now decided not to fundraise for her campaign. She seems determined to not only lose the primaries, but waste millions doing it

@FaithLe42 No private company should be funded by the government, regardless of what agenda it fuels. Women’s health is very important and there should be more competition in the market to compete with Planned Parenthood in order to lower costs and provide better service
@FaithLe42 We must work to fight climate change both domestically and abroad. It does and will continue to affect our planet. This is a sector in which the government must incentivize green energy and work with other countries toward minimal emissions
Anti-fa is a joke. The only people opposing free speech are the ones who claim to hate fascists
If abortion is such a small part of what Planned Parenthood does for women’s health, then why is the left so worried that outlawing abortion will cause Planned Parenthood to go out of business?
Planned Parenthood shouldn’t be defunded because they support abortion. Planned Parenthood should be defunded because no company should rely on government handouts to stay in business

@c_akash4 @wizeagle265 For example, in our previous posts, The Society tweeted about how images that make Mars appear round cannot be trusted. This is because they are distorted by the organizations that take them. That being said, we know the tennis ball is round because the picture is reliable.
@c_akash4 @wizeagle265 Thank you for contacting the Flat Mars Society with your question. We love to enrich the questioning minds of the future. About your question, you asked if the ball was flat because it looked so in the picture. The answer short answer is no, but the long answer has great detail.
@anguesvworld He who is not shown the light cannot be expected to find his way through the darkness.
@FlatEarthLife @FlatEarthOrg While @elonmusk may not share your beliefs or mine, you cannot call him a shill or any kind of insult. The way in which he pushes forward the private sector of space exploration only shows his commitment to discover the undiscovered and find the truth.
@SkiLeszek We started this because of the will to give Flat mars believers a place where they can go and not be judged.
@wizeagle265 Take our profile picture, for example. It is round, yet only has one side. This makes it a 2 dimensional shape and not a 3 dimensional figure. Therefore, it is flat, just like mars. #FlatMarsSociety #FlatMars
@wizeagle265 We are very sorry. We didn’t realize that you had been on mars and seen first hand that it was round. Oh yeah, you haven’t, and it isn’t. Everyone on earth has seen mars from the same angle that reveals it’s visible face. You are correct that mars is round, but it is not a sphere
@FlatMarsUnion @FlatMarsTruth So are all the other photos from NASA
@neiltyson Photos are unreliable because lenses can cause distortion. This is why mars appears round in pictures but is flat in real life. #FlatMarsSociety
@elonmusk Please keep an open mind as you move forward in your studies. You are always welcome to join the Flat Mars Society if you ever change your views. #FlatMarsSociety
@elonmusk I dearly hope that your quest into the future of space exploration includes a detailed investigation on the surface shape of mars. Hopefully you will see the truth in doing this. Please consider becoming an official member of the Flat Mars Society if you ever change your views
@elonmusk Funny you should say that, @elonmusk We would love your support! Hopefully someday when you get to mars, you too will see that it is in fact flat.
