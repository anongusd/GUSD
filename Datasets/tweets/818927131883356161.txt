Can't make it up: Obama now wants credit for the booming Trump economy. At least we can all agree the economy is better under President Trump.
Since the election "the jobless rate for African Americans dropped from 8% to 7.3%, while for Hispanics it fell from 5.7% to 4.7%...and with Trump's big tax cuts on the way, job growth isn't likely to end soon -more good news for all Americans." -Investor's Business Daily
