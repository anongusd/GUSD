Town Hall  about proposed land swap tonight at the Broadmoor Community Church. 315 Lake Ave. C/S 6-8pm https://t.co/qVoUnnbK3Y #copolitics
Last night's meeting about the proposed land exchange was informative.  It was great to see so many people engaged in government.
Jack Damioli, Broadmoor VP: The Broadmoor wants to maintain public access of Strawberry Fields would be open to the public and keep as is.
Part of the proposal would prevent the building of 17 new homes and preserve open space. ~ Parks Department
Also, There would be a park zoning deed restriction.  It would place on conservation easement that would preserve open space. ~Karen Palus
The Broadmoor would allow public access to Strawberry Fields and maintain access to any future trail system. ~Karen Palus
The timeline for the proposed land swap will be determined by community feedback.~ Parks Director, Karen Palus
