@rowe_deedra @AMike4761 It seems like you might be the one who needs to go read, Deedra.
@rowe_deedra @AMike4761 No doubt! Try reading my posts before ignorantly flaming them. If you can differentiate, why are you arguing with me when I said CCW lowers crime????
@JohnCol80631520 @kbrunorunner @OldcorpsGrunt But no one is laughing.
@rowe_deedra I already did walk away. Maybe you should try READING. I’m saying CCW=lower crime rates, FFS.
@rowe_deedra @AMike4761 You’re arguing with me about my outlook over MY lifespan. It simply has ZERO to do with right and wrong.
@rowe_deedra @AMike4761 Okay lady. Knowledge is the sum of education, not years. Perspective, maybe.
@rowe_deedra @AMike4761 That’s like me telling you, your ignorant if you don’t realize cancer cause apoptosis in cancer cells because you’re old enough to have read that by now. Have you heard of age discrimination? I would say you’re a practitioner.
@rowe_deedra @AMike4761 I would beg the differ. Age isn’t correlated to intellect or knowledge! I wouldn’t disagree I could learn something by taking you up on your suggestion!
@AMike4761 @rowe_deedra First time in my 29 years I’ve been truly hopeful for the future of our nation!!!!!
@rowe_deedra Some do, CCW laws lower crime in states that support CCW.

@brithume @aukester Planned parenthood spent more in donations in 2016-2018 than the NRA has spent In 20 years. Performed 60,000,000 abortions. Let’s be clear about who’s causing the loss of life. MORE THAN 50% of all gun deaths are suicides.
@MinorStrmMedia Trump revoked her passport she never had citizenship from what I can see.
@katmann53 @NWmom74 @JamesWStork @CRY_LIL_LIBTARD A private server is one thing. A government secure server (which she didn’t have the server secured) is different. They (gov) never knew it was being used for classified info (until leaky leak) . The fact there was an exhortation letter before her testimony = cover up. Get real.

@PamT817716 @POTUS I was a little incorrect. She was granted a passport but I don’t believe citizenship. What I should’ve said was O never granted her citizenship, but did issue a passport. Trump revoked the passport, which would be a smart logical thing to do. https://t.co/jtVfIzPh4W

@IlhanMN @POTUS @FLOTUS He was referencing slavery it seems. I wonder where that is still actively going on in the world?
@IlhanMN Isn’t Islam about denying freedoms? Women? Infidels - AKA anyone not Muslim? Just the fact you’re “not allowed” to draw muhammed is denying the 1st amendment, the right to free speech. So let’s not get it twisted, because @POTUS isn’t against freedom or immigrants. Proof @FLOTUS
@TulsiGabbard What about supporting regime change without war? Iran used to be a westernized society, why not support that now? What would you do on this issue in general? I’m curious!
@ItsZakariah @RonPaul knows about everything, he agrees with you. I’m on the fence. It may be an over reach normally, but if surpreme court agrees then it’s a no brainer. Seems like the border is one area he unparalleled power, and I agree the wall can’t stop everyone. I see it as principle.
@ItsZakariah It’s just the media fear mongers. Bush did it 13 times, Obama a dozen. Trumps first in 2 years, when we have spent trillions across the world (messing it up) how can people argue with 30 billion to secure our border? I get where your coming from. Obv 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th amendments

@trumpsmackdown @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS They seized all the money 4 years before they filed their case. That’s why they did it cause they knew he’d win if he had the money.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii Dude you just wanna argue. Educated yourself. NOAA and NASA climate has been proven to be misrepresented. I sent you the link. I even sent the video but I made the case, you refused to look at evidence. Proof is asking for sources when they are clearly right there.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii I don’t care what you say I’m trying to show you the light, the TRUTH about the data. If you didn’t take the data it’s 3rd hand anyway. My logic is sound, argument made, case closed. Just do more research on their site instead of asking me. I can’t learn for you.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii I should have said “rate of cooling” and the data in question is boat mounted thermometers, one reason it’s shown to be more in the oceans. Still is averaging a slower increase than before which would literally be impossible if everything Al Gore said was true, cause the ppm is ^
@smart_whit @texas_mara @realDonaldTrump Classy lady!
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii Degree of change is up for debate though, that’s more the angle. Global climate hasn’t warmed in 20 years (grand solar minimum) its not that it’s gonna stay like this, but they don’t want to admit they had a skewed perspective. And yeah, same goal, a healthy plant.
@boysnana372 Thanks, no doubt!
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii Saying a model is wrong isn’t wrong. Just like how NOONE was making the case of planetary alignment and earthquakes, they’ve proven something no one was present to, so all previous earthquake modeling has been incorrect. Sometimes being right means someone else is wrong.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii No different than dark matter. They “measure” that it’s not there, when in fact it’s a mis-measurement. I’m done arguing I’ve stated my case and proven it. Emotions don’t dictact facts or truth. Data does. They use data.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii I’m not sure what you’re saying, saying their videos say their not objective? The objective is discovering the truth, no believing the status Quo just because it’s easy.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii They source every piece of documentiation. Look in the video description for the link. I’m on their website right now looking at the cited sources.
@SweetLilRedhead @NatalieTweetsRE @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS Mail fraud = doing business by mail. Wire fraud = sending money from one bank to another. Money laundering = buying company assets. He was no crook, he was a White House marine and member of Mensa. He just outsmarted them with their own laws, and they didn’t like it.
@NatalieTweetsRE @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS He got convicted of half of what he got charged with. He didn’t break the law. The secretary of law for the IRS (too person in charge of all tax code) testified no advice or insinuations were illegal at all. Still got convicted. Had a public defender who lost 68 of 68 trials.
@SweetLilRedhead @NatalieTweetsRE @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS Thanks for sharing.
@SweetLilRedhead @NatalieTweetsRE @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS They also leave out that they met MONTHLY with the state attorney general to make sure business practices, and the state didn’t serve an injunction until after the feds seized all the money.
@SweetLilRedhead @NatalieTweetsRE @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS They left out that he was acquitted of over 70 federal felonies as well. That proves he was innocent, at least partially, and if that’s the case why was he even charged!

They are decades ahead of the old model.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii They are proving cutting edge science. They are for or against a narrative on way or the other, they just use the public data the taxpayers pay for and then make a determination, instead of trying to make data fit a predetermined conclusion. NASA is citing THEIR work.
@jenniferbeing @JudicialWatch Trust me, I’m disappointed. I’m not gonna claim to know things I don’t know. What she did was a gross misconduct, a felony. I’m just glad she’s finally under oath.
@RealSaavedra And promoting an ideology lacking freedom, and encouraging suppression of human rights women’s rights and illegal actions in the name of “God”
@jenniferbeing @JudicialWatch I ask the same.
@jenniferbeing @JudicialWatch Ignorance the law isn’t an excuse. No matter how convenient. Beyond that, there’s no way she didn’t know after being First Lady AND Secretary of State the security (and requirements) surrounding classified communications. Then she scrubbed the evidence. That’s a different crime.

@kellyhuq @nlefevre @SheriffClarke @NAACP I used to think the same exact thing.
If you want real climate science, earth and space weather updates, earthquake prediction (SIZE AND LOCATION) https://t.co/kIdKRnSi8T they are PRO information and ANTI disinformation. They discovered the link between planetary alignment and earthquakes! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump

I was Captain Planet for Halloween one year. I’m just saying I’m skeptical and I am that way because of evidence I’ve seen https://t.co/kIdKRnSi8T
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii I’ll research the way they collected the data, but in general I don’t believe the government no. Am I saying the chart is wrong? No! I’m just saying the agency providing it has misrepresented climate data in the past, so my question is why do you believe it?
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii NOAA and NASA have both been caught manipulating climate data. Did you ever go check out https://t.co/kIdKRnSi8T? I’m not the scientist and don’t claim to be, but I’m skilled enough in discernment to see a pattern of dishonesty. NASA &amp; NOAA have an agenda, a global carbon tax.
@jenniferbeing @JudicialWatch This will be the first time Hillary is under oath about the emails. She committed a felony, no matter how much she looks and is a grandma. The article indicates the perseverance of truth. The question is why she hasn’t been charged already.
@Cat69Q @Cshanahan150 @mitchellvii I agree with this assessment
@Newmanin2018 @mitchellvii @AOC 😂😂😂😂 I knew I’d get flamed. I can take it
@jenniferbeing @JudicialWatch “Got them”
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii The question is; is the data being manipulated to fit an agenda? Why is the data being manipulated? The solar cycle is about to start heating up.. that’s what we need to be concerned with, now CO2 level. There’s more biomass now than ever, even with deforestation, because of CO2
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii I’m not saying man man climate change isn’t happening. I’m saying there’s less Cause to be panicked than news wants you to believe. I grew up believing climate change and I still do. I’ve seen enough examples of data manipulation to know they aren’t being fully honest.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii Oceanic temps are to be taken by bouys, not boats, because the boats produce heat. It’s known the tempts aren’t accurate with boat mounted thermometers, even on a drag line. I’m not saying humans don’t have an impact. I do believe they are skewing data to encourage taxation.

I don’t need to ask about changing laws. He didn’t break any. Take 12 million.. waits 4 years to file charges. What’s that say?
@JohnKrone2 @mitchellvii @AOC 😂😂😂😂😂 sorry I guess I have bad taste

@haskinstheodore @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS I think it’s obvious trump leveraged debt so even if he has 10 billion in valueable property he’s probably owes 7-8 billion maybe more so his tax returns would show that. Obvious to me but I’m not hating him for not wanting to be clear about that.
@haskinstheodore @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS I can’t speak for him. Only my dad.
@haskinstheodore @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS I’m guessing though you wouldn’t care about justice anyway. If you did, you’d be advocating criminal charges against Hillary Clinton for the various documented federal felonies she committed.
@haskinstheodore @charliekirk11 @legereit @POTUS My dad paid over a million in taxes that year. I should have been more clear, they didn’t raid him and take his money for not paying taxes. They eventually charged him (4 years after the seizure) with conspiracy to defraud the government. It has nothing to do with his taxes.
@simplicio823 @HashtagGriswold Bingo!
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii I’m not denying humans have an impact on the climate, I’m just saying there are some things we can control and some things we can’t. Gotta focus on long term planning and yes that should include being conscious of pollutants.
@Cshanahan150 @Cat69Q @mitchellvii That would be the inclination yes. The planet will be getting hotter from sometime in the next 20-50 years (from the sun) for about 200 years, then it’ll peak. That’s what humanity needs to prepare for, not just the heat, but the electromagnetism on electronics.
