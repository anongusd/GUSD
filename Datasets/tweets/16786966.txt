@astroivy @NASAHUNCH Ivy you will HAVE to tell me more about those if you are permitted, would love to give them some time on the show. I love the concept of the .@NASAHUNCH program, it demonstrates that we need all disciplines in space flight and we all can make a contribution with talent.
@Taraustralis You'll get the real one if we have the chance to meet... thanks! https://t.co/NLTNBjSX2c
@Taraustralis Keep doing what YOU do too, and taking us places we've never been! Above all keep challenging us to think!
@Taraustralis All smiles here, and can;t wait to re-group with the gang for the show we had "eyes &amp; ears" at KSC for this one and got some amazing audio! Can't wait to tell the story!
@Taraustralis Tara, coming from you, that means a lot and I'm not just saying that . When a peer says that, thats a whole new level of complement. You made my week ( and its only Sunday!) Many thanks. Apologies for the late reply, was catching up on some sleep!
@TM_Eubanks So stay tuned the race isn’t over yet! 😉
@TM_Eubanks Think you need to be the first piloted mission to bring the flag home so it’s still up for grabs.

@dsfpspacefl1ght @jjrrffkk2009 @AJ_FI Id keep going if it weren't for the how at the time... I have a new wake up call of stupid 'o'clock in the AM for the day job. Gets me out earlier though but egads, Max and Emerald aren't even away yet! And they are "early birds"
@LynnSherr That’s a good question actually! Suspect these guys would be too fragile to make the trip up there!
Emerald and Maxine are getting excited too for the #Dragon2 🐉 Flight, wishing all involved every success. #TheDailyLovebird https://t.co/NUkv3udyXs

@SciGuySpace My thoughts - https://t.co/zhTY650LvG let’s hope we’re not calling it ‘ cancelled ‘ when the next administration comes in.
@jeff_foust It’s been a LONG week... by now I’m surprised everyone involved hasn’t done that.
Had this conversation driving home tonight. Even if DM-1 is as successful as EFT-1 they still have hurdles to jump over, and everyone seems to agree let’s fly when we’re ready. I know someone tried to pin that July date down during the presser, I was ‘ Yeah... no’ https://t.co/bGa0Km0VPu
@JimWay @astrosociety Will do, sir! Thank you!
@WinObs Nope Saturday is really looking good that’s the 72 hour delay forecast which... well sucks, so fingers crossed 🤞🏻 for no gremlins on Saturday morning!
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Press conference concluded. https://t.co/GTz1r5oVfh
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 We'll be in Firing room 4 , will be looking out at the Pad from there we've integrated with the NASA team, for that. Intergrated NASA into the launch decision flow. https://t.co/Oo7q5nDYcP
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1really learned a lot from NASA"s safety culture and we are better engineers as a result Lueders agreeing saying SpaceX also helped us be better engineers as well. https://t.co/jyMwJeeIbq
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 The amazing thisng about this mission is that it IS about 3 partners, we would not be here if we didn't have SpaceX's ingenuity and the patience of the ISS team, and figuring out how to do this as a team, as a team we're going to fly and accomplish this mission https://t.co/5gttJJPWwa
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Every mission is important to us but this one is really what we're all about. https://t.co/l3dbr6XRdQ
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 With the crew up to 7 we will double the science this will be the next step in our evolution on the ISS. https://t.co/epGazPG2lv
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 - will be video cameras inside the Dragon and we will see some video of what was going on during launch and other milestones. https://t.co/KJdJBHZoxl
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 really want to see too how the seats perform too with "Ripley" in the seat we've "incremented the crap out of this vehicle" so we will learn a ton from this mission https://t.co/Y7GioxImE7
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 On Ripley she will be measuring forces and such to simulate what a human would feel don't expect any surprises there but we want to make sure.
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Capsule recovery operations wont be much different for Dragon 1, but there will be medical crew on standby if we we need them on DM2 https://t.co/5NXHKtJpZu
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Hatch opening 2 hours 45 min after docking a US and Russian crew member will board test the atmosphere, on board. https://t.co/UUtgDY45u6
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Crew will test a retreat command, then come in to about 20 meters and test there as well. https://t.co/MBVLMvwfpf
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 On the Approach Dragon 1 was climbing up the R- Bar on ISS, Dragon 2 is active it will climb up in front of the station and dock on its own, very different dynamic approach. https://t.co/2h0zk2BS4S
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Since this won't be reused.. what part of the ECLS system do we need on board, also if we find things that are late in testing we want to make DM2 better, don't need crew interfaces unless "Ripley" is going to fly the ship. https://t.co/wxCMSXMH7H
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 The systems in DM2 are similar but there will need to be work done majority of the components are the same but some software will still be developed and some hardware still detail that we have to work though https://t.co/7Zsgzsehs7
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Issue on Dragon's Thrusters: Draco's did not like the thermal environment they may have been operating in we are constraining the thermal regime the thrusters operate in for this mission will be appealing heaters to the lines so we don't have to constrain DM2 https://t.co/s5s0jW2QVe
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 All vehicle have variances but both programs have got though this understand the risks and have closed them out for this flight. Always talyoring involved &amp; limits for each systems but no compromise on safety for ISS https://t.co/QC8zJtTLUB
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Resolution with the Russian son flight computer, Agreed with Roscosmos yesterday, explained the steps that SpaceX is taking for safety, Rroscosmos wanted a few more hatches closed and have the crew ready to get into the Soyuz. Proceedures being finalized, https://t.co/tb8A0GfvYc
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Very humbled and  "Ripely" ins the name of the "faux astronaut on board https://t.co/JL6HJIsuNC
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Q&amp; A Started What does this mean to the SpaceX team? SpaceX's goal early on was flying humans in space so this is a core business of SpaceX working on rockets for 17 years, Dragon1 had a window, a hint that we want to fly humans into space. https://t.co/zQksuXnZbE
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Delay weather  is a little more pessimistic https://t.co/NU4eEhcwT0
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Weather is looking pretty good... for Satuday's launch attempt https://t.co/5zGMvsWYD8
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Comping soon we will have 7 crew we can almost double the science being done on ISS and the spare hand will help with ISS Maintenance https://t.co/U4NEVhGvRs
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Lot of progress has been made but a lot of work to do before DM2 but launch on Saturday and docking will be a milestone, 3 crew on ISS have been preparing to receive this vehicle. Crew is looking forward to support this event https://t.co/ByIk18fHy2
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Crew is really excited, Canada has announced they will be joining the Gateway Lunar program, what we lean on ISS will apply. https://t.co/kmOrMCch4C
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Brought into two providers and integrate all of that work with our international partners and an excitement here at KSC eventually we'll be bringing crew to the ISS.checked the docking interface on ISS. 2 weeks later we'll have a Soyuz launch crew back to 6 https://t.co/y3O69LaQpD
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Everything is in top condition looking forward to launch https://t.co/k6lESaCOWD
#NASA #SpaceX #DM1 Task ahead is historic and really want to thank NASA for the opportunity and a shout out to the Falcon and Dragon Teams making sure we're set to fly https://t.co/yAvaGMadUo

@StephenFleming @SciGuySpace @SpaceNews_Inc Then why go down the sample return path at all if there is no attempt to bring the darn things back. You can do sample analysis on site with different on board instrumentation. I want to be on board with this but logically it doesn’t work.
@SpaceBrendan This looks like my attempts you are among friends!
@StephenFleming @SciGuySpace @SpaceNews_Inc Why not simply admit we’re caching the samples for a future human expedition to return? That seems to be the endgame if we currently don’t have a plan to retrieve them, no?

@romn8tr @Crow_T_Robot @TeamSpaceIL Thanks because we WANT to celebrate this but I need an official doc as reference. I know the kits are a pain in the hind quarters &amp; there is Data that’s repeated ( ex: launch pad history) but there is other stuff in there that’s unique to that flight.
@romn8tr @Crow_T_Robot Rome I am charged up for Israel 🇮🇱 and for .@TeamSpaceIL which is why we were awating for SpaceX to issue their Press Kit so we could get THEIR take (I have the former) but it was issued at the last minute.

@Mighty_Ginge @SpaceKate To launch 2 Phoenix class probes to Mars ( including launch costs ) would cost nearly $772 Million in 2019 dollars. The contract Was eventually suspended by MarsOne as reported by SpaceNews on February 18, 2015. A study was performed, yes,  but that’s about it.
@Mighty_Ginge @SpaceKate Josh the thing is all of these contracts have been canceled. I know of the Lockheed Martin contract: MarsOne attempting to purchase 2 Phoenix/Insight class landers then contract a launch. Mars Phoenix Cost $386 Million in 2008 today it would be $450 million. Each.

@ponder68 @Astro_Zach @jeff_foust My bet is the GAO will essentially say something similar in the case of Lucy too. Again, the demands of the mission vs cost. Sometimes you have to use the right tools 🧰 for the right job and those tools 🛠 may cost more but there is a reason.

@Mighty_Ginge @SpaceKate Josh The difference is I live in a town called Reality. I know Mars isn't the engineering problem the Moon was, there are so many other variables that have to be taken under consideration. The plan Mars One put forth was not workable. 1/

@Mighty_Ginge @SpaceKate All the best.
@Mighty_Ginge @SpaceKate Josh, I admire your enthusiasm but again there is no way Mars One is doing a piloted mission to Mars with 100 people for $6 Billion US. by 2023-24. Then there is the MIT Study which I'm not going into here. Non-Proft STEM Arm should continue, but the rest is a pipe dream.
@dsfpspacefl1ght @SpaceKate LunaCorp is in that woodpile there too. An Amusement park? Seriously?
@SpaceKate Either way The sort for this project ( MarsOne) isn't over completely hope the STEM outreach arm of the group continues but the idea that these folks were going to be Mars Homesteader? I think a generation of kids know what I mean  with the screen shot from Oregon Trail 4/# https://t.co/61yWrxVTQW
@SpaceKate Another concern is this could make investors a bit "gushy" to invest in real space ventures that have a chance at profitability  if the market  gets a bad rep due to the charlatans and "PT Barnum-esque" ideas like this was. 3/
@SpaceKate They simply did not have the funding and $6 Billion (US) was never going cover the full cost of Getting to Mars, and the folks running MarsOne had to know it. Mars Isn't simply an engineering problem like the Moon was. 2/
@SpaceKate Yes we all want to watch 100 people suffer a long protracted painful demise on some rock 40 million miles from their loved ones. That beats watching curling any day. I'm being sarcastic but there was no way this half baked, messed-up, ill-advised idea was going to work. 1/

@LouiseSchiavone Hi Louise, yes deep space is a challenge, soon as you get beyond the moon the whole narrative changes drastically. This is again when I hear we are ready to go to Mars in 2-3 years or less I chortle a bit. It’s more than an engineering challenge. Far more.

Via .@NASA So How would you throw a tailgate party on the .@Space_Station? When Houston hosted #TheBigGame in 2017 #NASA created a video to show some of the space food Station Astronauts had to put together a big game party 200 miles up. https://t.co/d5pVrT59zG … #SuperBowl53
@spacenerd19 @BrewCityChaser @Lunar_Luster Agreed, you need an economic reason for a colony, I see a research lab like the Antarctic station at least for the Moon near term, but a full up "2001- like" Clavius Base? Not yet and Mars? Lets ...you know GET HUMANS THERE first?
Via .@NASA Back in 2017 to celebrate #TheBigGame The #Expedition50 Crew on the .@Space_Station decided to see how far they could throw a football on board the station. Here's that video now - https://t.co/Pozda21RkH #SuperBowl53
@spacenerd19 @BrewCityChaser @Lunar_Luster Heck it costs $3 Billion just to operate the station every year So when I see some private entity say we're going to build an orbiting hotel in two years AND have the travel means to get there... my reaction is usually "Yawn, pass the spinach, please?"
@BrewCityChaser @spacenerd19 @Lunar_Luster Its actually a tease. Teasing and incitement has its place in life but not with this. Videos like that ARE the equal of "Lucy, Charlie Brown, and the Football" in keeping with the day today. It gets old, pretty fast. Im at the "Believe it when its on the launch pad" stage.
Via .@NASA_Johnson |  Meet "Big Muley!" Named after Bill Muehlberger, the leader of the #Apollo16 field geology team, it's the largest single sample returned from the Moon by the crew of Apollo 16.

It sounds like this Government Shutdown is a temporary reprieve until 15 February, 2019 so we may be back to square one in 3 weeks, if some long term agreement. Let’s hope powers that be recall they are playing with real people &amp; their livelyhood. #govermentshutdown

@Lunar_Luster @paperrocketman @DavidBflower @FunkyAppleTree there's always .@slooh...
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith But Id recommend reading "Apollo: The Race for the Moon" first before you tackle the Craft or Kranz book, It will give you a little more appreciation for the narrative both Kranz and Craft put forward.
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith Keith's right "Failure Ins Not An Option" - Something he actually never said was Kranz's book. You can tell he was really proud to be In   country that gave him the opportunities he had.
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith "Flight" was Craft's book ... it was very bare knuckle no holds barred kind of stuff... he didn't hold anything back.
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith I was but a little brat I have vague memories of Apollo 8 but do recall being a small child getting caught up in Apollo. I was allowed to stay up on a cloudy summer night to watch the Apollo 11 EVA.
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith The Chakin book is a great primer but for my money the Charles Murray / Catherine Bly Cox book is one of the best for the "behind the scene's" look. It really dived into the MOCR and the folks that supported the missions. from that point you can go to the Kranz &amp; Craft books.
@KatmaiKeith @Lunar_Luster Keith I've read so many over the years, and grew up breathing Apollo, so welcome to my world!
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith Yes,,there was some 'extra curricular activities' going on due to the high stress environments and such, some had different methods of compensating for the situations they were thrown in, that term Astronaut back then was like having a sprinkle of magic doofus dust on one.

@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith It was really hard on the families agreed a lot of marriages didn't survive afterward. And it wasn't just the flight crews either. Anyone that was in the  'Apollo Vortex' that was in the critical path made sacrifices.
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith Agree, to an extent, but again to me it was too dark of a film, even the way the interior's of the spacecraft were characterized as almost ' haunted' themselves. Once more respect the opinion, but I thought it was just Hollywood taking too much license.
@Lunar_Luster @KatmaiKeith I've only seen the film once in the theater. I'm in the minority but I was underwhelmed. I thought the film painted Armstrong as this dark and brooding character haunted by the loss of his young daughter,  trying to make sense of that while in the middle of extraordinary events.

@Lunar_Luster PS- The book is a great read, but it is very different from the film. Look at them as two separate entities.
@Lunar_Luster Natalie, the short answer is no one really knows for sure. Its a good bet that the bracelet scene didn't happen according to several sources. I really have some reservations on the film,  It was a very dark and brooding film as a whole.

@AuerSusan I’d be good to see if they could refly the Phobos Mission at minimum and put emphasis on some planetary endeavors like we have but again it would require some serious fund-infusions
@AuerSusan Agreed I thought we were in rough shape here with the US HEO program. Turns out we’re just in a lull... between storms
@AuerSusan Every time Roscosmos says something like this my thought is ‘ and the money for this is coming from....where? ‘ Their current budget is $19 billon over the next 10 years. That’s about the annual NASA budget currently, give or take.

@SciGuySpace Agree but 🇷🇺 has threatened to ‘take their ball &amp; go play with 🇨🇳‘ so many times, after awhile it rings hollow. We’re kind of joined at the hip on ISS but if things continue to deteriorate, politically they may find themselves on the outside looking in re: next program

@carsondial1 Umm,we’ve known for some time about China’s lunar ambitions. They still need the same infrastructure we’re trying to build, then test that infrastructure just like we do. I would wager they are a long way from that point. Eventually they will be there, but not today.
