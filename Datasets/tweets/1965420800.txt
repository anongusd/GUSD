Mr. Trump, this news today should be just as ominous to you as the shuttering of your foundation, or Judge Sullivan's likely jail sentence for Flynn.

Matt: We are not playing. When the full story comes out about the FIVE  revisions that started the day we requested these forms‚Äî&amp; our FOIA will drive that out‚ÄîI am guessing it won‚Äôt be pretty. https://t.co/g8NvDcpt3j

Yossi, it was not an order to investigate:  "he wanted to order the Justice Department to prosecute."  That a president may not do.  We would not even let Obama discuss enforcement matters. https://t.co/jFZCRfsa47
This is where the president's dissociation from reality is so terribly dangerous.  He may well believe he has the right to order prosecution (he doesn't) &amp; that there are grounds for it (there aren't).  But those who will say "No" are slowly slipping out of the picture. https://t.co/sjG13D4Ivv
This is quite simply the most stunning attempted abuse of power since the Johnson Administration.  Andrew Johnson.  It is tyranny--no exaggeration. https://t.co/sjG13D4Ivv
Things that make you go hmmm:  these two forms were submitted in November 2017 &amp; May 2018--but all the DOJ revisions were made in past two weeks starting the DAY we @crewcrew requested the documents.  Congress should certainly ask about the content &amp; timing of the changes. https://t.co/y4iHZFPq3G

difference between me and @kanyewest:  if i said this to my publisher they would have demanded my advance back.  (there may be other differences as well.) https://t.co/iy2P2u6x8X
very much worth reading--explores the nuance of the situation.  I found it relevant to my own ongoing struggle with the book and the questions I have been asking as reflected in my tweets (and RT's of those on all sides of the complex issues).  @benjaminwittes https://t.co/cBKty5rJsu
ETHICS ALERT:  gov employees who worked on this violated 5 CFR 2635.702, 704 &amp; 705, forbidding use of gov. position, property &amp; time to promote Trump's golf course.  Whoever took this pic, &amp; tagged official accounts, including WH &amp; State Dept, broke law.  Dont end up like Cohen! https://t.co/wfXLAGK17z
this was a very interesting @KlasfeldReports interview--I hope you enjoy it.  an extra bonus that my twitter buddy @Delavegalaw shares her considerable smarts on these issues as well. https://t.co/MnHfA3XKfr

maybe when he is done "investigating" Pruitt, he will whitewash Conway &amp; Scavino's ethics, Hatch Act violations. https://t.co/4VtwJt8syn
God bless you @ChuckGrassley. https://t.co/BIyOuUbW50
headline has a typo, should read:  Budget Director Mick Mulvaney Announces *Cover Up* of Scott Pruitt's Spending, $43,000 Phone Booth https://t.co/j95gDZBlkc
there will be major protests, but they will be PEACEFUL.  the riot gear will not need to come out in PA or in any of the 49 other states (plus DC) where we will civilly and courteously march -- &amp; will keep on protesting til justice is done.

This is shameful.  Blatantly obvious diversionary response to Cohengate, on the theory that "the best defense is a good offense."  Only its not when, as here, its a phony offense.  On the plus side, no allegations vs. #Rosenstein.  Find silver linings when you can! https://t.co/0CVdm0SJv7
Simple.  Trump is skimming off the taxpayer, so why can't they? Shameful https://t.co/QELGeZvAyP
in which i explain @CNN that since every rationale offered for firing #Rosenstein is phony, only the real reason remains:  obstruction https://t.co/vHAYGo979u
devastating @JRubinBlogger takedown of McConnell torpedoing Mueller protection bill.  she has emerged as one of the most important conservative defenders of actual conservative values like rule of law. that's why i'm always honored to talk to her, as here: https://t.co/mnajBWLJIn
RT @CNNNewsroomLA: Trump floats rationale for firing Rosenstein @NormEisen https://t.co/xwOGgOU2TS
or send #Pruitt  so he can't be fired! https://t.co/xWXhBXy8nT
The difference is that in '73, Nixon was running a normal admin.  Expectations game was different.  Now, our global interlocutors expect chaos (tragically).  Pompeo can continue convos as CIA director. No Senator should fall for this transparent Trump gambit to harvest votes. https://t.co/O47Lsag17D
come on @hughhewitt, i did diplomacy for a living, and it won't make a lick of difference as long as POTUS keeps pushing the strategy.  no one expects much consistency from US right now. https://t.co/gOsNS91llK
he kept asking if missiles could be redirected at his own appointees https://t.co/T5T0WfJ1PN
also, re Bart, Obama USAO/@PreetBharara ok'd him for key role in GM &amp; DB cases. so he has bipartisan cred. https://t.co/VKVRASnbzY
not if government accepts him as well.  which they might, he is an alumnus of that office and has a stellar rep.  Cuomo &amp; Cohen don't agree on a lot; tells you something that both of them think he is trustworthy, and USAO may agree. https://t.co/VKVRASnbzY
