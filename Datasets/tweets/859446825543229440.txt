It seems like if you do not believe in something you will die for anything.  Tramp is not fit to be in charge of a ant..and you all are behind him as he destroy Our Country.  REPUBS and all who support Tramp, you are either racist or stupid.
I PRAY we are much better than that. WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  have a country that is rich in values, so why are we letting a no-body destroy what our Ancestors died for.
Is your HATE that strong you are willing to kill your family for a deranged, sexual predator, delusional, illiterate,   racist, liar, non-believer, self-righteous, ignorant, and small of a man.
His followers think he love them. No he do not. He is using u all. If N. Korea or any other country come after U.S., who is first to leave.  Not you or I. But his family.  While our kids will have to go thru the raft of suffering. WHY!
He wants to be the worst President of all times.  If u pay attention he admires Nixon.  His agenda is to be a talking piece for a lifetime. Tramp is not upset his,ratings are low, this,is,what he will be remembered for.
It is obvious that Repubs do not value their life but are willing to die for a base President Tramp who do not care anything about them. Tramp is ill. He is suffering from illiterate first class, dementia.
