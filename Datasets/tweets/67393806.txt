Homework: 3 skills you want to develop in this #FWDFellowship and 2 ways you might achieve them
#WomanVet This helps her to understand that her natural leadership style isn't necessarily how she was expected to be in the military.
DISC - Increase your awareness of how you behave in a team. Increase understanding of how others behave in a team #FWDFellows @MFRIPurdue
A key message communicated at the conference, it seems, is that working outside of strengths can be done, but takes more energy. #FWDFellows
C-Conscientiousness -Emphasis on working consistently w/i existing circumstances to ensure quality &amp; accuracy; details, pros &amp; cons, rules
S -Steadiness- Emphasis is on cooperating w/ others w/i existing circumstances to carry out tasks; altruistic, need to accommodate, patient
I -Influence, Emphasis: Shaping environment by influencing or persuading others; generate enthusiasm, enjoys groups, sometimes talk too much
Group D - emphasis is on shaping the environment by overcoming opposition to accomplish results; need for high control, can be too directive
Group "S" wants to accommodate everyone and gave a detailed trip itinerary but were okay if things didn't work out.
Group "I" wants to go and have fun as a group with spouses. More cultural activities. Less concerned with "control" on the trip
Group "D" took five mins. They knew where they were going and how and they weren't taking any family/friends. First class, all-inclusive...
The group project is to plan your vacation with your similar DISC group. The responses are fascinating. #FWDFellows
DISC - Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, and Conscientiousness. (No one can say that academia doesn't love their acronyms as much as we do)
