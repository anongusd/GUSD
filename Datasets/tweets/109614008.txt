Biden said no to campaigning but this speech sure sounds like a stump speech -- an attack on Trump, an attack on GOP, calling for help for the middle class and the working class, and saying Dems need to save healthcare, Medicare and Social Security.
Joe Biden tells House Dems: "I have committed and I mean it - I will spend all the time any of you want me to making sure we win back the House." But he says "no, no, no" to a cry of "Run Joe run."

Some personal news: I've joined ABC News as a political reporter working with the digital team. Am super excited about working with this amazing group of people.
@dmartosko @ABC Thanks David!
@SarahHuckabee When asked about POTUS‚Äôs sked this weekend and why no meetings, she said he had lots of ‚Äúinternal meetings‚Äù and made a lot of calls
On ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù @SarahHuckabee says the White House wants the government open before immigration deal. Says Sen. Schumer is ‚Äúplaying games.‚Äù

Former VP Biden at Doug Jones swearing in says ‚Äúit‚Äôs good to be here‚Äù about being back in the Capitol. He posed for pics with VP Pence and Jones family. No one swore in senators like Biden https://t.co/ybl94hCSit

Mitt Romney would likely have a clear path to GOP nomination, which makes this even more difficult for Trump (look at WH actions in AZ Senate primary before Flake dropped out -- probably won't have those options in UT) https://t.co/zyVY1oRrsD

At House sexual harassment hearing, Rep. Speier points out that if the Cmte on House Admin chair doesn't sign off on sexual harassment payment from fund then a member can use their MRA to make payment
Victoria Lipnic of the EEOC listed order of claims received:	Mostly retaliation cases	American with Disability Act violations	Race	Fair Labor Standard Acts	Age	Family and Medical Leave Act	Sex discrimination/gender discrimination	Sexual harassment	Pregnancy	National origin	Color
Speier also talks about victims who haven't been able to work on Capitol Hill since reporting harassment: ‚ÄúWe have to make sure the victims have the opportunity to stay here and work.‚Äù https://t.co/4hHPqBfYqS
At a House hearing on sexual harassment, Rep. Speier says Ethics Cmte, the Cmte on House Admin not enough to investigate harassment claims. ‚ÄúThere needs to be an independent investigation.‚Äù

So both GOP leaders in Congress (McConnell and Ryan) have said they believe Roy Moore's accusers and he should step aside. Later, Trump endorses his campaign. If Moore wins this will set up an interesting dynamic between Capitol Hill and the WH going into 2018. https://t.co/PdJl8yBheR
