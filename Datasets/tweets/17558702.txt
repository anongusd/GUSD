Sarah Palin at the National Tea Party Convention said ...‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud to be an American.  Happy birthday, Ronald Reagan.‚Äù
People excited about seeing Palin. Time to start thinking about the Super Bowl. There is a game tomorrow? ? ? I like the Colts by 6.
People at Convention not aware that the Tea Party Nation is a "for profit" organization? The convention is for making money ? ? ?
Tea Party Convention leaders are not on the same page. Birthers vs fiscal responsibility etc. Will Farah bring down the Tea Party
Interesting press conference protesting the cost of the Tea Party Convention. The people putting on the conference are here to make money???
Some say they are angry. Fed up. But they never knocked on doors. Made phone calls, put up signs, volunteered & help conservative candidates
Event disappointing so far. People blaming everyone but themselves for the country's condition. Real problem is that they never got involved
