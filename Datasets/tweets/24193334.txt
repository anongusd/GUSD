@northbox Jeez. I don't work 24/7 for anyone. I get cranky without sleep and can't give my best without some down time.		I'm glad you've found a passion. It's ok if we have different passions. I'm going to roll with trying to pull resources to Maine as one of mine.
@northbox I'm not out to change you, and ask the same grace in exchange.
@northbox Trump cares a lot less for Maine than I do.		I'm much more interested in helping our tiny communities survive by exporting Maine's wonderful products than supporting his empire. The reverse is definitely not likely.		Your guns, bibles, land..and medical choices are your business.
@northbox Perhaps not the formal structure - that's fine. I left the GOP, it would be foolish to think there was organizational support.		That won't stop me from supporting rural communities. If my words on here help a school/foodbank, or find a few small businesses clients then I'm happy.
@northbox You're a hoot. Enjoy the snow tomorrow.
@northbox I'm not an out of state land developer, your ire must be misplaced.
@northbox So I should be taxed but not participate in society? My goodness, that sounds positively unconscionable.
@northbox Which is why only the person experiencing it should be the decision-maker. I don't know you and your life well enough to demand a vote in your medical decisions, why should we subject anyone to that?
@northbox No. I think we all add to Maine with our efforts to build community.		If your vision of Maine is only people who came here in a certain time period (but not before or after), and who had ancestors that contributed during one era only...that Maine is not sustainable.
@northbox I've given lots of ways I think the state could be moved to a better space. Have you seen #MaineRaising?
@northbox So if your kidney could save a life but you refuse to donate, is that murder?
@northbox Allowing the government into this realm is giving the same license to say you must sacrifice your own body for the life of another. I don't think the government has any right to demand anyone donate a kidney or the right to decide any medical procedure.
@northbox A live birth is a live birth.		No one is "ripped apart alive after being violently ripped out of" the womb.
@northbox So if my family came from some of the same villages in Scotland, Ireland, England, etc and happened to detour out west, my work toward improving Maine is not of value?		That's silly.		We all bring value to Maine; no many how many generations preceded us here.
@northbox I think the government has no business in medical decisions.		That's not "pro-abortion", that's "hands off". How would you feel if the government decided you needed to give your kidney to someone?		What I can handle, cannot handle, or want to do to my own body is my business.
@Al_in_Maine I'm also confused as to why you think I am saying police broadly are corrupt, which is not at all my assertion
@Al_in_Maine Not really. They are both conversations about how people are protected and with what level of force is appropriate.
@northbox What are you talking about?		Are you capturing only the period of statehood? Only when your ancestors arrived? Or the period the area of Maine has been inhabited by people?		It doesn't diminish one aspect of history to recognize that there is a lot of history.
@Al_in_Maine I'm referencing a specific incident, one I personally feel was handled inappropriately...and if the standard, it's not ok.
@Al_in_Maine Where am I characterizing all officers? I am specifically critical of inappropriate immunity.
@northbox I choose to be a part of Maine, that is what makes me a Mainer.
@northbox I don't understand this question.
@Al_in_Maine I have lots of good to say about police.
@Al_in_Maine I think they should review any potential abuse, don't you?		I'm surprised if you don't...a good bit of the 2nd amendment's spirit comes from the ability to protect ourselves from tyranny and oppression.
@Al_in_Maine It's important to review abuses when they happen, even if infrequent.		After all, in Maine if you are having a mental health crisis, they might blow up your house and shoot you.
@northbox My children were born in Maine. I think it's appropriate for my children to have exposure to history from a range of perspectives - from ancestors that went out west on covered wagons, to where we are now.
@northbox You really go for a jog with innocuous statements.		We have a somewhat diverse history in Maine, including tribal/indigenous heritage.
@northbox I was thinking more like Wabanaki
@northbox What about the tribal heritage? We have a lot of that too.
@northbox I'm a moderate, and I think it'd be quite a stretch to call me a "corporate whore".
@MarcACaputo I'll follow along for the conclusion 😉
@MarcACaputo I can appreciate that.		I'm used to path of fewest consequences rather than least resistance.
@northbox That's a heck of a lot of buzzwords there.
@MarcACaputo I think you underestimate how often people try to be clever with evidence in pulling a shaggy.
You need more friends who are family law attorneys.		We can tell you all the fake-outs. 😂 https://t.co/Tl6t1y3wCE

@ladybugkeeping There is this thing called summer...

It turned out fine, rice was a bit mushy.
@blainekell6 It *can* be, but I was using it as a pressure cooker.
My vampire obsessed 6 year old just requested a "garlic omelette" as an alternative to dinner.		...should I tell him?		#momprobs
I loaded my instant pot ingredients in the wrong order.		Send thoughts and prayers. 		#momprobs
@Al_in_Maine It is pretty darned rare for there to be consequences for going overboard.
@Al_in_Maine It....shouldn't be "left" to say police shouldn't beat the crap out of people and/or kill them without funtional review.		Immunity for police brutality is too liberally applied. That's not a liberal position, it's a functional  limit on police powers/government control position.
@Al_in_Maine Which some do very well, and some do not.
@Al_in_Maine It's not that often we hear of immunity issues in Maine.		My biggest issues with local police is getting them to take PFA violations as seriously as a chapstick theft from WalMart, and securing firearms in PFA cases.
@Al_in_Maine I didn't say I don't care for the police.		I *specifically* have an issue with improperly applied immunity. We have some truly wonderful police in Maine. I encounter many of them on the regular in Court.		We should be able to question all of our procedures/laws.
@Al_in_Maine It's a different duty. Different intention. Different recourse.

I don't ask anyone to change who they are; I merely ask those I could represent if I run to be open to the possibility they might trust me.

@CLebbo I really don't think Susan's problem is backbone
@bibi_207 @AOC I cannot control the things my husband says that I find amusing.		Is that an offer to volunteer?
@LuxAngela ....so have my husband clean our fridge is the take-away?
@cjkuefler I haven't dug into what viable reciprocity may look like. That gets tricky with one state making laws for another.
@cjkuefler I think we have a ton of laws on the books surrounding guns that aren't working together as well as they should to keep guns away from bad actors. We should be getting those laws working together so responsible gun owners aren't penalized.

@geokaren I ❤ balance, which doesn't mean everything is equally weighted, rather that policy movement it thoughtfully considered from more than one perspective.
@ikatsume ...the label keeps getting hijacked as a marketing ploy. 😠
@ikatsume I do not think the wall (wasteful and ineffective), or the muslim ban (ridiculous and inhumane) are moderate positions.		Healthcare needs progress, schools are critically underfunded (have you seen me #MaineRaising for them?)...my definition of moderate hasn't changed...
@cjkuefler I'm pretty consistent in my views and really have no interest in joining either party.		Fiscally efficient, prudent, humane law.		We won't agree on everything, but at least you know what to expect and I'll shred some bills so you know why. 😉
@geokaren Maine isn't as liberal as the last election made it look.
@geokaren I'm a muller. I'm mulling.
The question is...would you rather vote for Collins, or for a moderate who probably won't always vote how you want, but who is clear in their positions and reasoning? https://t.co/Ckpv6aJJEZ
@Cruellaisdevine @Martina @Pink Prince at the Gorge was *infinitely* superior to Prince at Key Arena.		I really prefer intimate venues. Actually, if @Pink could just come chill at the beach over lobster and gripe about politics while the menfolk and kids play, that's my 42 year old speed.
@TameMaineCoon I think it's fine to recognize the good/ bad of #mepolitics officials, on their own merit. Comparative value isn't great for framing.		Though I found it more difficult toward the end of LePage's tenure, I had some good things to say in his early years...but he's not in office.
@Cruellaisdevine @Martina @Pink Actually the small venues around Seattle and all the festivals were pretty terrific too, particularly for music with a harder edge.		90-00's in the PNW was a great time/place combo.
@Cruellaisdevine @Martina @Pink He was glorious at the Gorge...as was Sting...as was Jack Johnson. Fabulous music under a stunning setting summer sun. So basically, I miss being able to pop over to the gorge. Such a different experience than an arena.
Why are we still making everything about former elected officials? Why? 		#mepolitics https://t.co/E4e808II2w

@AIRBORNEJAG01 I think that would be an inaccurate description of me.		There are services it makes sense to contract together to purchase at different levels of government (for example, the military, roads, etc), but not all services are best administered by government, particularly federal.

All so you will get mad, and fight, and donate to campaigns, and door knock - that is *not* a reason to make law.		If I were the most pro-life person that ever pro-lifed, I would *still* be mad at this law.		This is pure political theatre, not protection of children.	#Readthebill
Everyone should be mad at this bill. It's inventing solutions that aren't needed, for an extremely limited issue that already has penalty, taking away your ability to control palliative care for terminally ill infants, and adapt the law to regional problems...		#Readthebill
there is an very high chance you have a child incompatible with life. This bill would demand your child be whisked away from you and transported to a hospital, stealing the precious moments, likely the only moments you may have with your child.		What shit is that?		#Readthebill
But what if you think Zika is great, and don't want it amended...still problems. Many of these terminations will occur in hospital settings, some will not.		Look at this sneaky language. If you are terminating a pregnancy late enough to create a live birth...		#Readthebill https://t.co/WP07vgbML1
I know, I know - let's making killing infants DOUBLE ILLEGAL!		Except it doesn't work like that. What if your region suddenly gets a mass influx of something like Zika and you want the option to amend your laws - nope, now you have to get Congress to agree on it. 😐	#Readthebill
You'll hear pro-life people yelling "BUT KERMIT GOSNELL".		Yeah, exactly, he committed crimes and was found guilty. This bill creates another level of law for something that is already illegal.		#Readthebill 		https://t.co/FTNiHEdMXW
The entire purpose of this bill was to divide people into feral pro-life or pro-choice camps...but it's actually crap law. Why you say?		A live birth is a live birth. A live birth creates the same laws for infants that apply to others. 		#Readthebill
Susan Collins voted for #S311.		You should be mad about this bill, whether you are pro-choice, pro-life, or DGAF.		This bill was written to make people angry, not make good law. I don't have the time to line by line this one, but here are highlights.		#Readthebill #mepolitics
@Mainearmy Seriously - with all the personal failures I admit, you think I wouldn't admit hitting a curb?		Fun fact - I was so thorough in my bar application they made fun of me for tracking down traffic accident info so old it was microfiched. 😂

@TameMaineCoon I read the bill last night on my phone. I didn't get up to print out the pages and make notes.		What was unclear about my comment?

@Donald_Booker @ASFried @GlennGriffin8 @Zellwasthere @RepGolden We don't compensate our state legislators very well...
@ASFried @GlennGriffin8 @Zellwasthere @RepGolden Conversations with average Janes and Joes are best managed regardless of where the legislative process is in its cycle, and perhaps are more easily managed when we aren't in the flurry of bill submittals.
@ASFried @GlennGriffin8 @Zellwasthere @RepGolden My opinion is the best way to talk about problems is in law is as a part of a continual, ongoing dialogue that is then triaged and fed into the legislative process.		There may (and probably should) be hyper-involved citizens that help develop issues for legislation, but these...
@ASFried @GlennGriffin8 @Zellwasthere @RepGolden You aren't picking up what I'm putting down Amy.		Very few people keep a journal throughout the year of precisely when then best time to contact legislators is...and even if they did, that would completely overwhelm our legislators.
@ASFried @GlennGriffin8 @Zellwasthere @RepGolden How is only talking to reps in a small window of time every year or two effective?		We should not put boundaries like that on average citizens trying to get involved and have an issue(s) to connect with their reps on.
@ASFried @GlennGriffin8 @Zellwasthere @RepGolden I disagree that contacting legislators periodically is unhelpful or that we should only do so in the window of time when bills are submitted.		Many bills take time to mull. When bills are *not* being submitted may make the time to thoughtfully construct a bill for next session.
@GlennGriffin8 @ASFried @Zellwasthere @RepGolden Me calling alone is not as effective as multiple people calling.		I don't want to be a state rep for a many reasons, including doing the job properly would overwhelm my ability to support my family - which also limits how much I can let myself get sucked in as not a rep.
@GlennGriffin8 @ASFried @Zellwasthere @RepGolden I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish Amy.		I can contact my reps on a variety of issues (and have). I did not call reps at midnight last night.		I talk about issues as they are on my mind, if I limited to the legislative window that would be an odd choice.

@dporter8462 Most cases in Maine family matters have one or fewer attorneys involved.
You should spend some time in family court trying to figure out how to support two households with the money that ran one.		Spoiler: the problem is usually lack of money. https://t.co/JUIH1Q24AY
If you are in Maine, call your state legislators and encourage them to look for ways to expand MCILS into family law.		It's a prudent limited-duration way to help families be more self-sufficient long-term, and help cases go through courts more smoothly.	#mepolitics
...and have no idea how much their spouse/parenting partner makes (particularly given the high number of self-employed we have), etc.		It's a mess to go through most divorces/separations with children without an attorney, having more people emerge stable from court helps us all.
It would also likely distribute state aid more equitably. So many times people settle for deviations in child support, don't realize they are eligible for spousal support, walk away from retirement they are entitled to and desperately need, do not understand the discovery process
We really need to fund a state system to help those without resources navigate family court. It would take so much stress off the clerks, mediators, Magistrates, and Judges.
(Plus if I were paying an assistant I would be able to take even fewer of these calls)		When I have the ability, I give as much time as I can on the phone to provide limited legal information...it's not enough.
Almost every day that I have the ability to return calls, I end up with at least one person I cannot help in tears because they don't have resources.		I don't have an assistant to screen these calls out, nor would I want to. I don't want to forget or be oblivious to the problem.
There are very few attorneys that practice locally in many of the rural courts; it's difficult to run a rural practice, particularly if you have children and/or student loans. This limits rural court pro bono options.		Spoiler: it's hard to leave law school without student loans.
For everyone else with a family matter that is low income, you borrow for an attorney, call everyone you can find a number for begging for help, or go without.		I work a lot in rural courts, but have to travel to do so and rarely can afford to at any sort of discount.
There are usually victim's advocates at protection from abuse hearings, and sometimes volunteer lawyers for limited help. I know at least one court attempts to have an attorney available for those accused of abuse.		A large % of PFAs involve family court as well.
I know of one firm that is built on sliding fee, which is still well beyond the reach of most (MCLC in Portland).		If you are low-income in a protective custody case there are state-appointed attorneys who may be available to you.
We have Caring Unlimited (York County), and Pine Tree Legal (a good chunk of the state) that provide services to very low income, domestic violence cases (a slightly broader range for PTLA), both are usually at capacity.
There is the court house assistance project that attempts to provide a 4 hour block of time where lawyer(s) are present for limited scope family questions free of charge, as often as once a week.		Our law school runs in Portland Cumberland Legal Aid, nearly always at capacity.
Can I tell you one of the saddest parts of law? It's the cases I can't take.		I am self-employed and have children to support, so I am limited in ways I can help without it impacting my practice. Maine has very, very few options for legal help for anyone struggling financially.
@J_K_1984 @northdixie I don't know the answer. I tried to come up with a solution during my campaign. Maybe we have a baseline coverage requirement for ballot-qualified candidates?		It's a problem that makes me sad...there are a lot of those problems.
@dporter8462 I'm sad the system is so money-driven. I wish media focused on different factors for "success".
@taylorasen @northdixie Finding it sad our system regularly asks people who can least afford the burden to support it, and doing so is a badge of success, is not the same thing as demeaning those who make the choice to donate.

@AK4WA I'm an attorney. It doesn't surprise me that attorneys work in niches, or generally prefer cases that align with our political beliefs...that doesn't mean malfeasance.

@AK4WA Have you....been to Seattle? It's one of the most liberal cities in the country.
@AK4WA I'd love to see the proof on your claims.
@AK4WA You think sanctuary cities are Dem only because of non-citizens voting?
@AK4WA Where is your data for those claims?
@AK4WA I was there in 2004.		Dino isn't a great candidate. I vote(d) GOP all the time and couldn't bring myself to vote for him.
@AK4WA I have a very hard time believing that given that there are way more effective ways to skin that cat were one so inclined.
@AK4WA We have a guy who was thrown off the ballot last year who was GOP because he had dead people on his nomination petitions. His signature collector was seedy. That doesn't mean it's a GOP tactic to use dead people.
@AK4WA The way you word it makes it sound like you think it's a party activity. I highly doubt it is. There may be a few people that prefer a certain tilt.
@AK4WA You are also going to need a ridiculous amount of fraud to overwhelm the liberal lean of Seattle.
@AK4WA I didn't say Russians. You said someone else registering them, that's not the same as a non-citizen registering and attempting to vote.		I highly doubt that would be a Democrat (or GOP) party sanctioned activity. You mean criminals, which isn't party-specific.
@northdixie I am in no way saying people shouldn't be free to participate in process, regardless of income. It's that an average that low is probably a lot of folks who can't afford it and much fewer middle class...I wish we had better options for $.
@AK4WA The problem you called wasn't non- citizens voting, it was fraudulent registration...which has consequences for non-citizens, but it's the non-citizens out to hijack our government.
@AK4WA @EmmettMiche11em That's a totally different problem than non-citizens voting.
@northdixie If you life requires you to be so frugal your glasses are jam jars...at least get more jam and another jar, right?
@northdixie It can be...but if you look at the audience attracted, it's probably people who don't have the money to give.		Part of why I wanted no money is I also attract a lot of that market, so I wanted people to be able to stretch those $ further than just a political donation.
I think this is supposed to impress me. 		It makes me sad.		People giving $27 to a political campaign probably need that $ for groceries or student loans...it will buy .00001 second of a TV spot.

@disqus_sk_user @brion_gallagher I think either system is fine as long as rules are clear and evenly applied. They are different systems with different benefits/detriments.		Having voted in both, I personally perfer open - but that's not the system I am in.
@disqus_sk_user @brion_gallagher Depends on your philosophical view of the purpose of a primary...is it to determine the candidate with the broadest appeal (and therefore theoretically best chance of a win)? Or is it to determine the closest to your party ideal?		Both views have merit.
@disqus_sk_user @brion_gallagher I grew up with open primaries. It was a hard shift to closed for me, but that is the system here and my preference isn't so drastic that I lobby for change. I personally feel like it give more balanced options.		I also don't try to loophole it by registering for primaries only.
@disqus_sk_user @brion_gallagher Though I personally prefer open primaries, that is not our system here and I haven't ever attempted to change our system to open primaries.		I haven't ever registered for a party for the primary, it feels like poor form.

@brion_gallagher That's Maine.		I would argue most of us know how to register and de-register should we really be inspired to get a particular candidate on the ballot...but unlike R or D, we tend to hold a wider range of beliefs and don't have an "I" version of vote blue no matter who.
Independents generally don't work like that...there isn't an independent party line, because independent. https://t.co/U4AaHRntVU

@Mainedolfan30 @macasu Same. I'm ok with prudent investments in our state and recognize there was a "price" for the surplus that may not have been worth the surplus...I just hope balancing the ship doesn't flip it over.
@Mainedolfan30 @macasu Lepage underfunded some things within the state to create a surplus, so she will need to spend some.		The $ will start hitting before the 2020 election, the results will probably hit after...which will be awkward for the election since it will be hard to gauge performance.
@macasu On a local level, that's not accurate. There is something severely hinkey right now in DC.		If you were to go up to a good chunk of Mainers (particularly rural areas), you would discover a lot of fiscally prudent, conservative voters that are not reflected by the GOP tweets.
@ChrisRoy78 The thing is....there is real criticism and a real debate to be had.		This is the equivalent of showing up to a debate and your closing argument is the other side is a fart face.		I don't want one party debating itself. I want 2+ parties debating collaboratively.		#mepolitics
The real criticisms are good enough.		Why do you do this dramatic nonsense?		Instead try a policy-based argument, frank discussions about budget realities, and generally not acting like DC.		#mepolitics https://t.co/VmP0MRquUT

@madmarNH There are issues with enforcement, plea deals, officer training, loopholes, databases being properly updated/accessed, etc.		Even without writing a single new law there is a ton that can be done to minimize this threat.
@madmarNH Some of this already exists.		For example, a temporary PFA often comes with a firearms prohibition and a requirement to turn over firearms.		Many DV bail conditions also have weapons restrictions.		Many DV convictions do lead to a firearms prohibition.

@Falcontrader @Terra_Cide They apply logic, reason, gut, intuition, and yes, feeling, to evidence to reach an opinion that is the bench's best estimate of fair under the law.
@Falcontrader @Terra_Cide I don't think I have ever read an order in one of my cases where it wasn't clear the Judge or Magistrate injected how they felt about the situation, which is way more than applying statutory factors in an emotionless void.
@brion_gallagher It shouldn't be...but probably is for some. I like limits on government. 		For example, I think governments shouldn't be making our medical decisions.
@Falcontrader @Terra_Cide Our laws do not exist in an emotional void.		If you think the law is applied free from emotion, particularly in the realm of domestic violence, perhaps the way the law works is different than how you think it works.
@Al_in_Maine Are you talking about red flags or PFAs?
@Mainearmy Right, that is the problem. PFAs don't come with access to services.
@EndP8riarchy They are fairly generous with the firearms, at least on temporary. I've got issues with some Judges finding abuse without enough evidence or not finding abuse despite some fairly clear evidence, but so many of these are settled by agreement.		The enforcement issue is not in court
@Falcontrader My children might have a grandfather if red flag laws were a thing...
@Al_in_Maine These laws are not nearly as well enforced as they should be and don't handle self-harm properly.
PFAs aren't a great mechanism to handle suicide threats.		They can remove some access to weapons, but do not provide resources or get other support.
@Al_in_Maine There is due process here. There is almost always a court date swiftly - just enough time to get them served and have a few days to retain an attorney.
I would guess a fair share of those men's shoes are suicide. It's an issue not well addressed by PFAs.		Many will take out PFAs to protect both themselves and partners. It's halfway through Feb and I've already had 2 temp PFAs this year that came to me involving a suicide threat.
@EndP8riarchy I'm so sorry you experienced that.		It is *shockingly* frequent I have to explain to men that she is *never* getting back together with you because you rape her regularly and have to explain what rape is...and these conversations are usually not at PFAs, just family court.
There is *so* much pressure for her to drop the PFA, often so he can hunt with his friends/family.		My biggest red flag is the abuser who asks about guns more than contact with children. They are chilling.		Note men absolutely can be victims, it's just much more frequently women.
Want to know what that looks like?		When you show up to a PFA and the victim is all alone, but the abuser has a gaggle of friends and family telling you if she were only nicer, a better partner, less of a flirt, then he wouldn't get so mad.		Would she do counseling to change her?
Domestic violence is a problem in Maine that we do not take seriously enough.		We have so many small towns. It's difficult to ask for help when the help is likely to be a friend or family member of your abuser. https://t.co/x7W0EVBKWA

I am so glad I am not related to the second couple. I already have a few inherited rando crazy decorations i keep for novelty but DO NOT need a whole Christmas room.		Their problem is *not* tidying. It's losing their cats in low-level hoarding.
@WomanWhoWeaves So I'm supposed to watch another one?
That was not very gratifying.		It looks like mostly cleaned before they were filmed because they knew they were being filmed, then threw out some stuff - mostly from the garage which we all know is really a storage unit, but if you go back in 6 months it's like a crash diet.
It really doesn't look all that different. I could clean my kids room and it would look just like the before clean by the next day...oh wait, that's just called Tuesday.
Seriously, change that diaper.		Ok I think we're nearing the end...their living room looks exactly the same.

Kondo's boxes are the hooks from Seinfeld's closet.

Kondo definitely lives in a house that isn't full of freecycled furniture where her husband and children have broken ALL THE DRAWERS, so instead of sliding in and out they have a gangster lean.
Ummmmm....my clothes that truly spark joy are my pre-baby clothes that I don't fit in.		I do not find joy in my boring, machine washable, mom garb other than I don't have to think about whether or not I spill on it or if it will fit. I will buy 5-6 of the same dress as a uniform.
I need a ritual prayer to clean?		I'm screwed. If I sit on the floor like that my children will start climbing me.		Why are they crying when we haven't even gotten to cleaning?
I'm so confused.		Are they fluent in Japanese?		Why is their "worst" more clean than my house? Their living room looks like Pottery Barn pre-Kondo. 😂
I just put on the Kondo show about cleaning...is this...like...Iron Chef for closets?

@triplerbailbond @realdebfarmer It's not just heart, though humanity is important. It's also incredibly financially wasteful. Jail is $$$ per day.
@triplerbailbond Where did I say victims don't matter? I own a small business. Victims matter. What matters most is stopping the behavior...which jail isn't doing.
@triplerbailbond Right. They are habitual. Jail doesn't stop the behavior, we need something else that does for these low-level, non-violent crimes.		Habitual assault should be jail		Habitual theft of candy bars?
@triplerbailbond We should create and fund more help for stability, shifting the jail from services outside of its scope to its core mission and creating other pathways than jail.

@anxiousscorpio I agree 		I also find it...poetic? fitting? that Congress should have to walk by and see such a tangible representation of a problem they are not effectively addressing when they handle TANF, SNAP, etc guidelines.		Of all the new reps, I'm sort of surprised this shocks AOC.
@Al_in_Maine At least in cities like Portland, it shouldn't be jail. We should have some other option.
@Al_in_Maine For example, if you are homeless it is really, really hard to get a job. It's also really hard to not be homeless without a job.
I actually think there are a few things we should be *less* calm about. https://t.co/FjbMkkM06i
@Al_in_Maine I personally find it better to remove barriers/excuses for success. I don't think of it as coddling.
@Al_in_Maine If the goal is to get people stable and employable, creating a lengthy record for non-violent crimes driven by other factors is the opposite of how to do that. As a taxpayer, I'd rather not be paying for extended sentences if there are better paths.
@Al_in_Maine Chronic theft is not an issue jail is likely to solve. Jail makes worse most poverty, mental health, and addiction...2 of those need treatment usually not available, 1 needs resources to become employable (if possible, some people will not be employable).
@Al_in_Maine This applies to so many problems. We are using jail as quite possibly the worst social service provider.
@Al_in_Maine We have no real access to programs without insurance, which many drunks do not have. My suggestion is we channel a bit of the drunk tank $ towards resources to not be a drunk in the drunk tank.
@PoliSci_JpR Totally 		I actually responded to a few essentially saying anyone who answers your questions should be disqualified from Congress.
@Al_in_Maine I did not say theft was ok, I said jail doesn't fix the problem.
@nataliepruiz I actually hope it gets the homelessness issue more attention since its been brought to Congress. Don't you?
@Al_in_Maine It's the record that is the biggest problem...and that it's not always let out the next day...and it's just the poor who can't make bail.
@nataliepruiz I'm pretty meh on paying people to wait in line.		Using the desperate to provide false testimony? You can get under my skin there.
@Al_in_Maine Money to the homeless is going to fall into the category of places I am least offended lobbyists spend money.
@PoliSci_JpR If I have sufficient support. It was certainly a learning experience last year.		Have a follow, join the journey.		I agree on endorsements. I was also *shocked* how many rando groups send questionnaires generally, many with unanswerable questions.
@Mainearmy I thought you were replying to my tweet on endorsements. 😂		I didn't accept any money from anyone as a part of the campaign. You know that. My beliefs are not a purchasable commodity.
@Mainearmy I did not ask for their endorsement, but given that I don't think governments should make any medical decisions, I imagine if endorsements went just on beliefs I'd get them and some pretty far right Libertarians on that issue - quite a mash up.
This does not shock me.		I wouldn't begrudge the homeless a safe way to earn a few dollars. They need it.		Congress and local legislators have a long way to go before comprehensive resources are available to help those who wish gain traditional employment. https://t.co/qeYCAPfQxM
@PoliSci_JpR I'm kind of over endorsements.		If I were to, say run against Susan Collins, I'm not sure I'd bother. That time is better spent shoveling snow.
@PoliSci_JpR Yup.		I was the only person who consistently mentioned a variety of issues - climate change, disabilities, LGBTQ, gun issues, a variety of vulnerable groups, etc. Crickets.
If I ever went to DC, would I be the only person without logos? https://t.co/EbQz7wroYM
That's a headline. https://t.co/7qCWqlYy0G
@PoliSci_JpR They are a mechanism akin to lobbying whereby groups throw public support to the person they think will win in hopes that candidate will be more favorable to them in the future from the free advertising.		If it was about core beliefs, I would have been drowning in endorsements.
@PoliSci_JpR Endorsements are stupid. After I has a number of groups endorse others last year when their goals/values more closely aligned with my position, I stopped bothering to fill out paperwork.

@atticusmalia It's often because they have no address, which is a stupid reason to deny PR bail.		Portland Judges/Justices are often more sympathetic on bail, but it's still not rational a lot of the time. It's so wasteful. We could take those same resources and provide services instead.
@GlennGriffin8 CCJ is county run.		We just have stupid consequences.
@Cannibal_Sauce CCJ is run by the county.
I had precisely one black man I helped yesterday.		Props to the Justice who listened and gave PR bail to a man with less than $40, who lives 40+ minutes away, who had a FTA for not having transportation.		Many times I have been in court that would not have been the outcome.
Roses are red		Violets are blue		I think our criminal justice system is broken		Don't you think so too? https://t.co/58WT6JAxPh
I don't think jail as it currently is employed in this country generally *is* rehabilitation.		It's punitive and/or restrictive (keeping the dangerous away and the unsavory out of sight).		Sadly, we focus more on consequences than outcomes.		#mepolitics https://t.co/C1Tb6OgrLv
@Potterchik Jail does not do many of the medically assisted withdrawals...actually, they might not do any of them. Because of the cases I handle, I haven't asked that question in a long time. To transfer out of jail, you often need insurance and many people lose their insurance while in jail
@Potterchik AA really doesn't work for a lot of people. I'm not sure why we rely on it so heavily instead of science.
@Potterchik Most are at capacity most of the time, require insurance, etc.
We should all be offended here - as citizens, as taxpayers, as humans. This isn't fixing the problems, it's making them fester. #
There are often offers from the DA for bed to bed transfers...which requires there to be a bed, in a treatment program, that is a functional program, that the person has access too, so...
Low $ theft? Tends to fall into one or more of 3 categories - too poor for toiletries/food/socks/whatever, addiction, mental health issues. How does jail fix any of those? It is a nightmare getting anyone without insurance into treatment...actually, even with insurance.
Create a space where drinking in public is ok. The bars where people with money go have patios and decks, then drunks wander out. The homeless can't afford an $8 artisnal beer.
Jail is very expensive shared housing. Create inexpensive shared housing with services attached for there to be treatment, showers, an address to get work, etc - it's a better use of resources. We have Preble Street, but it's not enough.
Drilling down a bit on both of these charges.		DIP are almost all alcoholics. They aren't likely to hurt anyone but themselves. Putting them in jail doesn't make them not an alcoholic and for the many who are homeless it doesn't make them less homeless.
(Being angry = recognizing it's a horrible waste of resources and not the best remedy to achieve goals)
It's really not what they went into it to do...like when I got rostered for misdemeanors before it clicked that meant nearly all HOs and immigration issues, which I still do because even though it makes me angry, that's better than it being someone who isn't angry about it.
Addendum...		Almost everyone in the system seems to have a problem with these sorts of charges. For example, the CCJ doesn't seem so keen on being a treatment center for mental health care, addiction, and poverty. I get the feeling they'd much rather be focused on "bad guys".
@AlstilesStiles This is all CCJ
@dfresh2011 I've literally seen folks arrested for less than $1, and in that case charged with a felony because they were a HO.
@rufusdrl I haven't seen much of that with @Target here...I may need to rethink my Target purchases.

We need better laws for crimes related to poverty, addiction, and/or mental health.		Jail doesn't work.		It's expensive.		It's not proportionate to the crime.		It doesn't change these behaviors.		Let's make better policy and create actual solutions for these problems.		Fin.#
We should not put anyone in jail for these low dollar thefts.		It should be a ticket, access to resources if needed, and/or community service.		Side note 2, I don't shop at WalMart in good part because of how they treat petty theft issues.
However, she's a habitual offender. This $15 theft might cost her up to 5 years of her life, and her child's life, because it will now be charged as a felony.		Long sentences don't fix theft, it costs taxpayers an unbelievable amount of money and it's insane policy.
Our bail is low in general in Maine compared to many places, but it's still beyond reach of many. This case started with $250 bail request, and the DA was willing to try PR bail (no $0) with a pre-trial contract. She will have gotten out today and have tomorrow with her son.
There were several low $ thefts today, but I'm going to hone in on one case.		It's a mom of a kid &lt;10. Tomorrow is valentine's day. She has a long record of chronic, trivial issues...but thankfully no failures to appear.		The theft is for approximately $15.
It's not always that way.		DIPs can pile up very fast and people can end up with weeks or months in jail, losing employment prospects, access to services, disrupting treatment, etc.
He had been in jail since Monday. The proposed sentence was 48 hours, which he was going to be over by the time he was transported back to jail.		The DA agreed to dismiss the charge. This small kindness of not creating a recent conviction keeps open doors and services.
The DIP had no real criminal record. He is homeless. He was drinking a Natty daddy in public because he has no home to drink it in. This is extremely common and would be an incredibly easy to resolve with a pavilion or two near the waterfront. We do not have this, so jail.
Side note: I happened to have a reasonable DA in a good mood today. Thank you for being (mostly) kind DA.
I should start by saying I genuinely hate incarceration for both of these charges. It's *horrible* policy. Not only is it disproportionate and inhumane, it's an incredibly wasteful use of money.		There are functionally no services to help, they are overcapacity or nonexistent.
Can I tell you about my day?		Today I was lawyer of the day for folks in custody. I had the pleasure of addressing 2 of my least favorite charges:		DIP (public drinking)		Theft, Habitual Offender, for an amount &lt;$20		Everything I share was said in open court and public record.

@hockeytank12 My point is it's foolish to expect Susan to vote as anything other than a pretty darned conservative, party-line Republican. She's a reliable conservative vote. Love Barr, don't love Barr - doesn't matter, it's silly to think Susan won't vote for him.
@YesMeredithFinn It's really not different than a jerk ex....it's not like they are actually going out of their way to screw with you, they just don't care and you (or in this case we) aren't on the radar in decision-making.

@disqus_sk_user What are you going to do with all the GOP members?
@disqus_sk_user It showed up after I tweeted.		I do think the GOP needs to hold their leadership to a higher standard right now on average, which is why I tweeted. The GOP needs some leadership lines in the sand. Some of these issues should be uniting, not divisive.
@disqus_sk_user Cool. Well, why don't you take up with the Dem Congressman who made the original statement who also didn't assign a value, saying GOP shouldn't move goal posts and Dems shouldn't have lines in the sand.
@disqus_sk_user I am not sending them both for laps. However if you have two parties that both believe the other to be the offending party - telling them to clean up their own problems before they focus on that of the opposition is a lot more productive than assigning who is worse.
@disqus_sk_user I am very careful not to say both parties are equal, because they objectively are not on a range of issues.
@disqus_sk_user I am responding to a statement of both parties. I frequently select one party's tweet or statement and am specific on that statement. I don't think Democrats should be the only party drawing lines in the sand. I think GOP should draw some lines with their leadership expectations.
@disqus_sk_user That is not the same thing as implying they are equal as an excuse for behavior.		I'm not saying ignore your behavior because they do it too. I'm saying don't worry about their behavior, look at *your* behavior, your role, your team. When your house is clean, take a gander over.
@disqus_sk_user It's *not* bothsiderism....I am asking members of both parties to look to their leadership, see if that behavior is happening, and demand it stop. I purposefully do not assign a value because I want people to identify with the statement and be introspective.
@_Ben_Franklin1 There is quite a list of lines in the sand that are appropriate these days...I grabbed a mere handful and didn't want to make a 42 tweet thread.
I agree parties should be working together. There should also be lines in the sand...for both parties.		Child separation, bloviated grandstanding, loose associations or no connection at all to objective truth - neither party should accept that from their leadership.	#mepolitics https://t.co/UfhzzAWEAK

@fimail Counterpoint: don't jump the shark with unrealistic offers and accomplish nothing instead when inaction is your real enemy.
Remember, there is value in the vision of others, and criticism can be used to find flaws and make plans better.		Fin.#		#Readthebill
Instead of "THIS IS SO EFFING STUPID AND IMPRACTICAL!!!", try "it's great to have goals, but let's start where we are and come up with a plan that gets us there without going bankrupt, the planet collapsing, and gives us milestones where we can gauge efficacy."		#Readthebill
Instead of being all "OMG WE HAVE THIS KICK ASS GREEN PLAN THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD!!!!", try "let's work together on forward-thinking strategies that are more sustainable and profitable, making sure to share that profit equitably".		#Readthebill
There are genuine concerns, that should be addressed and listened to. This plan has almost nothing tangible about it...and the few places that are tangible aren't really realistic.		For example in reality, we *won't* get 100% of buildings retrofitted.		#Readthebill
It's *fine* to have these kind of goals, but we shouldn't spin our wheels too much on them, nor should we make these out to be more than what they are.		This is not a revolutionary blue print; it's saying we have shared goals.		#Readthebill
There is a value, but it's not super concrete.		This is broad, vague and feel good enough that a lot of people can sign on and yell "yeah! Go green".		However, there are legitimate concerns and implementation problems.		#Readthebill
Think of it like your high school fight song. You all sing it to bring you together and give you shared goals.		🎵we will win	We're set out to succeed	We're headed out for #1	We know that we will lead	Our pride and honor will be strong	Our fame will reach the sky...		#Readthebill

For example, the way trade deals work...as Trump figured out, they aren't all one-sided. It's hard to have things be "accessible" and "affordable" while still being "fair" and "sustainable"		The eminent domain abuse callout will conflict with other goals, often.		#Readthebill
There is a surprising amount of redundancy for the document length. It also seems to presume all jobs will be union jobs, but that simply isn't the reality for small business, self-employed.		Lots of these things interact with each other in ways that won't reconcile.	#Readthebill
P13 here is where we get to the jobs guarantee...I just don't know how you would accomplish an actual guarantee. How would you handle someone who is bad at the job? Would all the jobs be federal? Funding source? How does that knit together with private sector?		#Readthebill https://t.co/9EX0EybZOb

The zero emissions goals for transportation are already underway in urban areas and pretty impractical in rural areas unless we magically make all vehicles solar, water-powered, etc.		Plant trees and other carbon trapping tools? That's been a thing for a long time.		#Readthebill

P8 this brings us to smart power grids - we're already headed there.		"Upgrade all existing buildings"...well that's not an in our lifetime goal. We still have places where outhouses rule in Maine.

@TheSteveTheCat They don't really have plows there...not that we would even plow for less than 3-4 inches.		Seattle doesn't react well to snow, well maybe it's that you usually have to drive to the snow so an inch is a very exciting snow day like the ones we need a foot+ for. 😂

@Al_in_Maine But how do you feel about my new avi Al? I feel like the pens really make the hairstyle.
New profile photo....pens in hair, don't care.
@Al_in_Maine We do have several Justices. What made is peculiar was him writing a several page dissent when the official response was one sentence.

@Mainearmy @commlong Where is there any proof these clinics are dirty? It's incredibly common to go to a doctor or clinic (not a hospital) for outpatient procedures. If something goes awry you get transported to a hospital.		These are not decisions government belongs in.
@Al_in_Maine This case isn't about that. It's about admitting privileges, and how they are seen as a "legitimate" barrier to having providers.
@Al_in_Maine 😐		Al - it's directly related to the rights in RvW re: undue burden. I don't know what else to tell you.
@commlong Kavanaugh more nicely = there is a 45 day transition period and we don't know if there is actual harm. Let's see if harm happens before we go rushing in on possible uncertainty. (He wants actual harm before intervention, despite there already being limited access in LA)
@commlong Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch would deny application to let the law proceed pending further litigation (law is on hold).		Kavanaugh =The argument is a magic 8 ball. Screw caution and that there could be harm, show me actual harm of womenfolk and I'll think about the law being a problem.
@Al_in_Maine ....the case is related to whether or not the imposition of the law is an undue burden related to abortions?
@Al_in_Maine His dissent in the case cited is directly related to RvW.
@Al_in_Maine None of us was there Al. He's a SCOTUS Justice, so we gauge him by his opinions.
It's not a very Maine cocktail, but I'd put absinthe in anything with Susan.		It's a trip you should expect, but somehow you are still always hoping your memory was wrong and the next day you remember why you don't drink anything with absinthe....until the next time you do. https://t.co/gmTOwItUcD

@erikaho111 @jordanzakarin ...and of course she accepted fund supporting her against the people who tried to bribe her, why wouldn't she if they did it first?		Anywho, I think that's how it will be spun and a lot of folks will bite.
@erikaho111 @jordanzakarin I'm not saying this is my perspective, but I think it will play that she was making a "thoughtful, deliberative decision" and there was immense pressure from the left, including millions of dollars raised out-of-state for her opponent to "bribe" her to vote how "they" wanted.
@JillPiggott @anxiousscorpio Susan is way better at photo ops.
@erikaho111 @jordanzakarin One is offensive, one is defensive/responsive
@erikaho111 @jordanzakarin I don't think that will hurt her.
@Tonya_Stylz Unfortunately, I'm always right about bad stuff. Good stuff? Much less accurate. 😂
@sharkbubbles @JillPiggott @SenatorCollins Susan does not appear to be interested in your opinion if you don't agree with her.
I owe @saragideon an apology. I've been spelling her name wrong. 😂		Sorry Sara!
@jordanzakarin This fund will backfire.		Instead find possible local candidates and start lifting them up.

@KenMorg66816466 She is no longer running.
@Tonya_Stylz Naw
@BruceBourgoine @SenatorCollins I agree that attitude is limiting, but it is also prevalent.
@BruceBourgoine @SenatorCollins I agree. That doesn't change how most folks in Maine react to those from away telling us something about Maine is a problem.
@Rob_Tewksbury I think you've got better odds getting Susan out with a woman....Olympia Snowe 😂
@MatHelman @sallemann @SenatorCollins @MaineDems Sure it will be hypocritical. I don't think it will be as ineffective as you think it will me.
@1liners Those who aren't from away weren't voting for her anyway.
@sallemann @MatHelman @SenatorCollins @MaineDems It's going to be spun, at least somewhat effectively, as people from away trying to bribe Susan for out-of-state interests.
When almost the entire #mepolitics tag is about Collins, most from away. https://t.co/1fY2IBeetz
@MatHelman @SenatorCollins @MaineDems This fund is such a bad idea
@TJN_1984 It's going to take something truly sensational and genuinely good to keep Susan under 50% for RCV to even kick in. The best I can come up with is, say, 100k folks doing #MaineRaising.		That's a hell of a hail mary.
@kajaido001 https://t.co/k9GoxPOdD3
@TJN_1984 She is *extremely* unlikely to be unseated. Which most of us in Maine who are grounded have been saying for some time.		If I had 500k+ followers, a shocking uptick in TV shows that loved me, AND #MaineRaising went viral, I could *MAYBE* pull that hat trick.
@TJN_1984 Unfortunately for everyone (and terrifying for me), it was pointed out I might currently be the 2nd best known Independent (trailing far behind Angus).		...but I don't have 500k followers, or the ability to command all the media.
@TJN_1984 Then you need all of the #2s for the Dem to shift to the Independent and an Independent who is a moderate, not a far left or right, to grab a bigger share of the center slice than Susan.
@TJN_1984 The Dems here aren't super at working the middle slice, and Susan is great at that slice. I ran a RCV last year, but both of the top 2 weren't super at the center slice, so it was fine to have the Independent fall 3rd (and 4th).		To beat Susan, you need the Dem to come in 3rd.
@TJN_1984 Structually, you'd have way better luck knocking her out of office with a well-supporter Independent and either a weak Dem or no Dem. Angus King could beat her, but it would be silly to run since he's already a senator.
@TJN_1984 It's Maine. We have no big names....well Stephen King, but I cannot imagine he would be interested. 		I would guess her most formidable dem challenger in Maine would be Sarah Gideon (speaker of the Maine house), who I think is unlikely to win due to structural factors.
@TJN_1984 It's a RCV race. She will have multiple challengers.
@mattsko I have a day job. It is not practical to campaign indefinitely...and frankly I don't have the support at this time to be successful - none of the possible candidates do.
@mattsko The problem is it is WAY too early to declare in Maine, so supporters need to show support in advance...and no one is likely to get to the 500k followers Susan has, the ability to command media she has, etc.
@mattsko Gop? Max Linn, but that won't go anywhere		Independent? Vanhelsing has declared. I have said I would seriously consider it if I had support.		Dem? Mains has declared. I think Gideon is likely to survive the primary.
@dtheavenger @Tracy330507 @DebraMessing I'm just telling you the likely perception of that money among the swing votes you need in Maine
When my feed is all people pissed off at Susan Collins...most of whom won't follow possible challengers or support them. https://t.co/SLD5Bw3roz
@dtheavenger @Tracy330507 @DebraMessing That money is going to come with a big curse. I wouldn't touch it. The best way it could be used is donating it to Maine charities.

Tonight we're going to watch a man who shoved a lot of people out of their political party give a speech, followed by a woman from the other party, and then a man who is party-fickle, creating intense conflict between party members.
I'm making these statements without assigning value to the parties ideological values and shift therein, whether you love or hate Sanders or Trump, they both changed the parties.		Shaking things up will always get a reaction of people who love it and people who hate it.
b) Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.		You see, when you jam ideology into a political party that isn't the party's current space, you either create a massive fracture and infighting...or a cohesive movement that leaves a substantial amount of the party homeless.
Short thread on being an Independent.		Folks from the left ask me why I don't become a moderate Dem.		Folks from the right ask me why I don't become a moderate GOP.		Your answer is that a) I'm really not either of those, even though we have a lot of shared goals, and...
@GlennGriffin8 I Told You So Olympic are a sport everyone loses.
They have every right to be. They had this guy who was kind of a jerk to everyone, but he promised them a tax cut, so he was *their* jerk...and it turns out he was a jerk to them too.		I think Trump supporters have every right to feel betrayed on taxes and nudged into conflict. https://t.co/kbUoL2f8gX

@AbvlorLaura We need a way to reconcile our past. We can't just keep taking the truly egregious examples and yelling "RESIGN"...I've had moments in my life where I half-laughed politely because someone in a position of power was telling a wildly sexist joke and I needed my job.
@AbvlorLaura We just...have to have a path forward. Racism/sexism/homophobia/etc are so persistent, so pervasive, so chronic that quite literally almost everyone had either done something(s) inappropriate and/or witnessed something and not intervened		If we can't reconcile that, we're screwed
@Inzion_ I didn't leave in a flourish. I couldn't even tell you the date I left. Events started getting awkward, so I went to fewer of them, and then sort of ghosted contacts until no one reached out to me...I guess that's an age-appropriate response for early 20s.
If we keep making it not ok to admit past wrongs and demonstrate growth as individuals, we won't solve this problem. ⤵️ https://t.co/u8mVBHjlwO

@Mainedolfan30 It's hard to make policy that pulls away the problem. You need to try to stop people who are violent, mentally unwell - but only in a way they would harm themselves or others, and/or careless enough to not protect children and others from access to their guns.
@Mainedolfan30 I think that hurts hunters providing for their families and is unlikely to stop someone who is interested in hurting others.
@redhair_channel @RBReich Yup. The energy doesn't get focused where it can make change.

@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst @GOP I think of ethics and morals as both individual, closely related. I think of societal values as shared (community/culture oriented).
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I don't think it's a matter of embarrassment. The format doesn't fit the concepts well. It's hard to follow when responding to short bursts of information.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user The conversation is one that does not easily break into tweet character counts.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I am at best a prospective legislator. I've run for office precisely once. 		I'm not talking about my feelings. In this case objectively you don't know what I think about a lot of things about my frame of reference. I haven't shared most of it.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user @GOP I was discussing that this weekend.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user ...and tweets are not the best way to effectively have that discussion. My DMs are open if you'd like a more conducive format.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user The thing is the "you" in your tweet is general, not specific to me. I don't agree with a lot of your statements applying to me specifically, but you have already said you aren't really interested in what I think or have experienced. You don't know what I think the experience is.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user @GOP I don't think political parties equal ethics. I think ethics are individual and you can't expect a candidate/official to protect you because of the letter after their name.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user @GOP I ran against a R, D, and I. I was by leaps and bounds the most outspoken on child separations at the border, mandatory minimum sentencing, police aggression, systemic abuse, etc.		The R and the D complained about career politicians and who Susan Collins liked more.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I do not think there should be *any* federal regulation on medical procedures - termination/abortion, cancer care, hospice, bunion surgery, etc. Those are medical decisions and should be beyond the realm of government. Those are decisions made by the individual and their doctor.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I don't fit into either political party.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user When we define ourselves, we can try to be as objective as possible, but that will still usually not be objective.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst You are certainly entitled to not share my perspective. I am specific to use moderate rather than centrist. I don't think moderate is particularly centrist to a lot of issues these days.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst You are talking about Trump. I have been extremely vocal that my views are not consistent with racist, wasteful, inhumane, poorly spun, bad law designed to benefit nepotism, insider trading, and corruption. I focus on Congress because they are derelict in their duty to be a check
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I did not for Trump. I have no plans to vote for Trump in the future.		The overarching theme of reaching out to moderates to form coalitions on a wide range of issues well beyond the vote for president is my concern. There are a lot of shared goals that could be achieved.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I understand I face a different set of life circumstances. I won't pretend to be an authority on yours. That is your story to tell and not mine to co-opt. I think you are mistaking me not wanting to rudely try to list off what I think your life is with me not caring/listening.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst but I cannot control the efforts or opinions of others. Saying I am a part of the group you can capture, and offering tips on how to connect doesn't undermine the goal here.		Not every collaborator comes to you with the passion or desire wanted.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst A group of people wants trump out of office is not mutually exclusive with here is another group of people that may share your goal and maybe reach out to them.		I understand that there is a desire for that group to share the same burning passion over the issue, and some may...
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst Those were intended to be unrelated topics.		Topic 1 = hey Dems, there are a whole bunch of us you should be reaching out to		Topics 2 = you seem frustrated; I think we need some trust since our communication has been kiss your ass/people that look like you but aren't you
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I am happy to support folks advocating from perspectives I have not personally experienced. I also recognize that advocacy is more effective coming from the experience, and not from me attempting to run over that narrative.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst We all triage differently. I absolutely appreciate that my triage is different than groups that have a different experience, and even like individuals who see a different path to correcting systemic issues. It takes many perspectives and approaches to correct systemic wrongs.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I have the ability to listen.		I also recognize you have zero trust for me and would need to become familiar with me before you can listen from a perspective that does not seek points of conflict. Different backgrounds =/= different goals, but often come with different language.
@_grammar_ Auto correct doesn't always correct well. Thank you for the correction.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user Maybe someday you will be open to that possibility. It'd be great to chat then.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I don't agree with a lot of your definitions. I can't change the folks your are frustrated with.		You aren't open to the possibility that I have a different perspective and appear only interested in viewing my perspective as adversarial.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I use the word permissive because it is more neutral than liberal. A lot of folks mean the same thing with different words.
Purgatory needs a better sound track. https://t.co/6pien1LpDL
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I agree that our executive branch is a symptom. I think we have a way bigger issue to deal with than that at this time. Our Independents here are a range, but a huge chunk trend moderate and socially permissive.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I'm not sure what you'll gain coming after any money I might have (but don't thanks to student loans). You have a lot of passion that would probably be better served on the common goal of correcting systemic failures and disparate policies.
Can I spend today not contemplating Facebook at all?		These days I only log in if someone sends me a message...to tell them to please email. https://t.co/WWGnvR5rsG
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I worry most about the composition of our Congress, which is where I lay most of the blame right now. That is not going to be merely a R or D choice in Maine.
@brill_inst My overall point is that if more Independents turn out, it likely helps shift policy a direction that is beneficial sooner.
@brill_inst I am realistic of what I can personally change and not change.		I cannot change personal beliefs.		I can attempt to change policy. I can fight bad court orders. I can take a court case involving inequity to the Law Court (&amp; I have). I can tell a DA/Judge when a sentence is wrong.
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user Surely, that will be an effective way to drive voter turnout.
@brill_inst I do not have the ability to make those who have veered into white supremacy to not make that choice. I have no capacity to change personalities.		I vehemently disagree with much of the policy and because of that ran for Congress last year to attempt to make changes to bad policy
@brill_inst @disqus_sk_user I agree that should not be the case.		Unfortunately, we have a lot of folks in Maine who feel left out entirely. My available choices are to beg political parties to try to engage those folks, and/or run for office myself, both of which I have done.
@brill_inst I agree that there isn't a middle ground on topics like white supremacy, but that doesn't mean here that your choices are that or not. You might have none that are and 4 that aren't, 1 that is quietly and 3 that aren't, etc.
@brill_inst We have a different voting system here. We have ranked choice voting. It's not binary.		We have more unenrolled here than are enrolled in either party, so most of our elections are determined by them. Pulling more of them out to vote is the best way to swing the vote your way.
@disqus_sk_user @brill_inst I don't think both sides are the same. I think a shocking number of Independents just gave up on the system entirely.
@MAFgeek @MaxBoot I believe the moderates wouldn't have dropped off so heavily if Independents hadn't been so quiet. It's a lot easier to swing a party to an extreme when folks peace out instead of saying hell no.
@MAFgeek @MaxBoot and we haven't demanded policies that veer to ludicrous are not squashed instantly. Unfortunately, though I do not stay home, many Independents do. It's a hard place to be, the parties will gladly take our money and let us volunteer - but neither party listens to Independents.
@MAFgeek @MaxBoot That means the GOP should be getting its act together, and the Dem shouldn't act like we are invisible because we aren't party members. We have a role is this cluster. We haven't been loud enough. We haven't told the parties when they've gone over a cliff on an issue(s)...
@MAFgeek @MaxBoot I share some sentiment without the language choice. I think we should be stepping forward as Independents and flexing our strength politically in such tragic political times. There is a huge % of the country opting out. We need to step forward, and both parties should see us.
@brill_inst I don't act like that. I'm sorry others that look like me have made that choice. My actions, my choices, my behavior is not reflected in that experience.		Your experience is traumatic, deserves a voice that is heard, and appropriate support.
@catvalente I had just finished paying off one baby when I had the second.
@brill_inst I'm not asking to be begged for. I'm asking to be on radar. Independents are treated like we don't exist politically frequently, and doing so causes a shocking number to stay home. There is a lot more in common with a good chunk of Independents, so it's worth being inclusive.
@MAFgeek @MaxBoot Winning someone over is probably not the exact language I would choose if I were making a tweet unattached to another. I do think it's important to let a range of groups know you hear them and see them, even if it's not always eye-to-eye.		I'm pretty clear on where I stand 😉
@brill_inst I don't think I have knowingly voted for anyone who is so inclined...but these days it seems like a shocking number of folks are. 		In our federal and statewide races last year, all of our races had 3-4 candidates.
@brill_inst I think you are referring to LePage, who I did not vote for and is not currently our governor.
@brill_inst I live in a state that has ranked choice voting and elects independents. We don't have just 2 choices.
@mavrolo I think it's death in politics to say I won't listen to anyone but my party. It's how we got to this horrific space. That doesn't mean abandon your moral code, it does mean that when you represent a district, you represent an entire district.
@MAFgeek @MaxBoot I'm not saying I ideologically agree on all or even most topics with Max. We've got to stop the two camps and I will only represent you in mine world.		Even if you don't agree with a point of view, it is the job of a representative or potential representative to listen.
@jblumenfeld100 Each region has its own feel and personality. Reminding any potential candidate that you need to be both authentic in who you are, and aware that others may want to be heard that don't align 100% with you is important.
@brill_inst Election choices, particularly on a local level, are entirely binary. I live in Maine, where we have a broad spectrum of purple. Not even reaching out to independents is a sure way to have a lot of them that are needed stay home.

@disqus_sk_user @arcjean For each million in ads, a million in small business sales and donations to charities would stretch further, get better word of mouth, and draw supporters like a magnet. It's all the things we want - good, kind, helpful, authentic, and it shows priorities that are missing.
@disqus_sk_user @arcjean @AOC She is better than others at working the middle slice, way better than Bruce Poliquin was. That's the piece I know. I just don't have the 40% base to play in the margin.
@arcjean Stephen King, Angus King....haven't figured out who else. I don't think I am currently popular enough and do not command enough attention to jump at that goal.
@arcjean They don't have to be. She has a massive audience. Do you have, say, 500k followers to send my way? Even if they don't all like me, that would be sufficient to start a ball rolling down the right path.
@erossin48 @RalphNortham He ended up being a horrible example. If this had been a single event 30+ years ago followed by a career in service supporting vulnerable groups, I think it would have been appropriate to not have a resignation. Instead, moonwalk.
@disqus_sk_user @arcjean I think I might have been the first person to try it and I only took it out for one logistically challenging test run (it's a bit of a bother to say please shop in one of these 375 towns). I think it's work statewide.		$ for $, I'd bet on #MaineRaising
@disqus_sk_user @arcjean @AOC I don't disagree millions would help - I just think it's not helpful in traditional ads. 		Susan Collins has almost 500k followers, the ability to get any media, and a population incredibly adverse to money and suggestions from away.
People are yelling from the rafters that you are disconnected, out-of-touch, and they are still mad about the Sonics. You have no functional policy and no effective plan to build the infrastructure necessary to carry out a nationwide campaign.		But sure, it's dislike of rich. https://t.co/lKMukKhTW5
@disqus_sk_user @arcjean This war won't be won with disdain, or Kavanaugh, or calling Susan a meanie head, or even Susan's voting record. It will be won by someone who genuinely connects with Maine with a burning authenticity that shows through in actions.
@disqus_sk_user @arcjean It's not going to be conventional money that beats Susan.		It's going to be someone who truly loves Maine more than everyone dislikes Susan. It'll have to be something like #MaineRaising where the love, focus, and goodwill goes back to those struggling in Maine, where it belongs.
@DrRAbdulrehman I just need to eat up my walls with screws....and apparently use a fork for the assist.

@erossin48 @RalphNortham We're all a bit damaged and it's an awkward conversation to have. We won't all get it right, but that doesn't mean we should keep ignoring it.
@erossin48 @RalphNortham instead of being able to say "I did stupid, hurtful things in my past" or "I watched stupid, hurtful things happen and didn't intervene" and change to a place where we show growth. I think it's incumbent on all of us to participate in that process.
@erossin48 @RalphNortham I couldn't even bring myself to watch it.		The much larger point of the thread is we have a messy history with racism, sexism, etc and I think we need a productive way to address the past to change the future. It seems like we wait for someone to cross over to Dick Dastardly...

@taradublinrocks @DisavowTrump20 This seriously has nothing to Susan Rice...it could be a nobel laureate with 7 degrees who single-handedly gave us world peace.		Maine wants someone who sees us and is one of us. That is nearly impossible if you don't live here and even harder to convince folks you are for real.
@DisavowTrump20 @bizwiz1980 @retail_recruit @AmbassadorRice Sure, Susan will drop 65%➡55%		Gideon would have better odds, though I doubt either would get over 45%.		The money won't matter. At some point "x" there will be an inverse relationship between money and voter turn out. We were pretty darned close to that in CD2 last year.

@amend28th @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham ...which is clearly not Ralph at this stage of life.
@amend28th @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham I think we should be highlighting people who have learned from poor life choices and showing that there is an example of how to change, grow, and be a better participant in society.
@amend28th @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham We are talking about different genres. I think the folks you are discussing have no place in power. I also know folks who have made a stupid/inappropriate/hurtful joke years ago and learned from those experiences becoming *not* that person. I've watched people change.
@owl_sounds My condolences. Was there a striped shirt involved?

@amend28th @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham I think if someone had 30+ years of a career making wise choices, fighting inequality, and was not the dipshit they were in college, doing the job well and using that power to fix inequity would have been a good solution...but Ralph still wants to moonwalk, so no.
@TheLibLawyer @PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice I think Maine will accept people from away...but not someone who moves here just to run. It feels like we are being used as a vehicle to Congress rather than sending one of us to bring our perspective.		I'm qualified to hold office too and ran last year.
@amend28th @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham I agree he was a very bad example. I was coming from a context of seeing someone who seemed well-vetted, had tons of endorsements, nothing similar had come out, the photo was very old, etc.
@amend28th @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham I think it's a *horrible* costume choice, but I would say marching in a rally supporting those beliefs is much worse than thinking one is being funny for Halloween when one is actually catastrophicly unfunny. It's also moot because it didn't end up being a single incident.
@TheLibLawyer @PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice I don't think you'll see candidates until the summer.
@TheLibLawyer @PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice Do you think there isn't a single person who happens to live in Maine with real talent?		How can a representative to Congress *not* be tasked with representing their state to conquer national problems - how can you say what a place you don't go to often needs?
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham Obviously, he was a bad example.		The low-level stuff is everywhere and pervasive. For example, I can't tell you how many people I've seen make offensive and sexist jokes in a workplace that were harmful oblivious to them being damaging.
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham And if folks who are white can't talk about it, can't encourage a path forward to say "this is how you don't get torn apart coming forward if you weren't an egregious offender", it's going to take decades longer to solve this problem than if we all participate.
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham We need a way to say your memories are fine, you can reflect on the positive bits fondly - but your obligation now that you know it was harmful is to not do that and to keep an eye out for those abuses going forward. You know it's harmful, step in so there isn't more harm.
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham Of people who fight the change, get defensive, and dig in on their right to not feel guilty over things many didn't realize at the time were harmful. In a perfect world, they would not need that transition plan and would never have learned by being jerks, that's not our world.
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham They would also shovel your drive if you got hurt, check in on you if you have cancer, and give you the shirt off their back no matter what color your back is.		If there isn't a way to shift the culture from the low-level crap to maybe let's not do that, you'll end with a lot...
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham I ran for Congress last year in Trump country. There is a chunk that is absolutely sexist, racist, etc - but most are truly not. They live in a world that is 97%+ white and have periodically fallen into traps of a tasteless joke years ago or being resistant to any change at all.
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham We don't talk about low-level racisim, sexisim, homophobia, etc very often, at least not in the contexts of dumb or thoughtless things done once upon a time. There is no path to go from what society has been and in many ways still is to a less abusive space.
@amend28th @TheWayWithAnoa @MelissaFazli @RalphNortham Here's the thing - Ralph was the wrong example, but there is an unsustainable problem festering no one seems to be talking about.		Maybe it's because my day job is in a world where unless someone is a serial killer you are likely going to have to see and work with each other?
@PinkPinkpetunia @RalphNortham Information that became clear after the initial tweet
"News" like this is why we have ridiculous elected officials. https://t.co/0TBCyVulRg
@bizwiz1980 @DisavowTrump20 @retail_recruit @AmbassadorRice That is true. I don't know who the best moderate and/or independent would be. They need to command enough of the Dem vote not to get knocked out and to be better at working the middle slice than Susan. It's a tall order.
@ifyouseecate @MEHerlihy @DisavowTrump20 @ManMet80 @AmbassadorRice I don't think the problem is never, ever have been from away. The perception of moving here to run is the problem.
@ifyouseecate @MEHerlihy @DisavowTrump20 @ManMet80 @AmbassadorRice It would be foolish for Pingree to give up her seniority. I don't think it's a white problem. I think it's a part of the DC machine never lived in Maine problem.
@vjacqueline66 @RalphNortham I agree....instead he went down the not a redemption path
@MohanadElshieky I'm so ahead of the times that I never followed them 😂
@timorousme We need people who say when things are stupid, unrealistic, and clearly showboating.
@Bugl3t @sc_vaughn @RalphNortham @davidmweissman We have to start finding a path forward. This inbetween yuck we are stuck in is unsustainable.
@Bugl3t @sc_vaughn @RalphNortham @davidmweissman I agree.
@Bugl3t @sc_vaughn @RalphNortham @davidmweissman To be clear, I am not excusing his photo - I think it's not that weird to have a bunch of embarrassing photos from decades past and to not pull them out and wave them around.
@Bugl3t @sc_vaughn @RalphNortham @davidmweissman I truly think for many it wouldn't even occur to them to reach that far back. 		I've mentioned being in Indian Princesses as a child. It was a YMCA program and I wasn't even 10. It never would have occurred to me to mention it when I ran for office last year.
@JusticeGirl2950 @RalphNortham These are hard, emotionally charged conversations to have.		If I seem distant, it's because I know I am answering multiple people who are probably not reading all the other answers and I don't want to respond in a dramatic manner and make the conversation unproductive.
@JusticeGirl2950 @RalphNortham My first tweet I presumed he changed decades ago...it became apparent that is not the case. That made the conversation on Ralph to be moot since it appears to be a current issue and he should resign, and brought the conversation to the larger issue of how we do handle past wrongs
You all aren't a bit freaked out by this? https://t.co/EXR9RkcMAr
@RiverbendPoker @RalphNortham Before actually. After discovering there was more than the one photo. I do't generally delete tweets because I think it is unproductive to truncate conversations like that.
@eshh85 @RalphNortham More information became available.		I'm actually shocked we don't have a lot of folks where there is some old stuff then nothing further. I remember cringing at a lot of things in the 80s-90s from people who appeared to turn out otherwise functional and decent.
@DisavowTrump20 @bizwiz1980 @retail_recruit @AmbassadorRice I think the only way is to find a local, moderate, independent and run no dem or a weak far left dem. You need Angus King's race from last year.
@lissie_w @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 @Kalarigamerchic We should listen to others, but I also feel we are compelled to action - I think we need to stop standing silently on the sidelines and making everyone else do the work. It should be a combination of raising voices and providing scaffolding.
@lissie_w @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 @Kalarigamerchic When I sent out my initial tweet, I thought this was an instance of one inappropriate, but not beyond redemption event by someone who had been fully vetted for decades and had been supporting appropriate causes. That's a very different situation from how it turned out.
@lissie_w @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 @Kalarigamerchic The problem with finding a path forward is we have such extreme variances of offense, a wide range of victim experiences, and wide range of reactions for how we should address it. It leads to inaction in all but extreme cases and that's not good enough.
@lissie_w @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 @Kalarigamerchic I don't know that I agree with that in all cases. Sometimes that is accurate, sometimes not. Even as I reflect on my own experiences, I can think of situations where I would want somene to know the impact they had on my life, and others where I would want zero contact.
@lissie_w @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 @Kalarigamerchic Very possible and all the more reason to be having conversations about coming forward and paving a way to not being like that.
@lissie_w @Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 I have not seen the press conference but have heard of its unpleasantness
@meesterripley @RalphNortham I have already revised my opinion. I did not see the press conference. I have not deleted my original tweet because it adds to the conversation for it to be seen in full.
@midwestjak It's such a horrible world to live in, and a tragedy to leave for our children
@drjimcox @RalphNortham I actually think there should be some talking about what white, male, senior citizens can do to help root out casual (and not casual) racism
@TalbertSwan @blainekell6 @ManInTheHoody @mmpadellan @coleyworld @B52Malmet @goodoldcatchy @MissNyetTrump It is abysmal and unforgivable to have institutional policy that absolves of murder.
@iveygirl08 @DavidGr78574965 @RalphNortham I don't agree with that either
@lissie_w @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 @Kalarigamerchic I did not know anything about his successor.		So many of these cases the offense is not a shock because the offender is habitual. I picked this case because so many people seemed shocked and it appeared to be a one-off, old event. I had been waiting for one like that, wrong one.
@lissie_w @Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 I don't think whether or not he resigns has much to do with the conversation. The conversation should be a thing.
@JusticeGirl2950 @RalphNortham People generally. I'm not talking about Ralph specifically.
@JusticeGirl2950 @RalphNortham I do not believe people are beyond change. If they are we have an entire country beyond redemption.
@nbrink77 @Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 Given his recent statements he does not appear to have paid penance, which makes my comments on ralph specifically moot. I still think there is a larger conversation to be had, but Ralph is not a subject in that conversation.
@Signifying_What @RalphNortham I agree
@DoriPrevin @RalphNortham That is information I had after tweeting. I generally don't believe in deleting a tweet (though I do periodically with a bad typo). I think it's important for conversations to evolve.
@jheart2430 More has come out since I tweeted. I revised my opinion on him specifically, but not on their being some path for restorative justice for those who have grown/changed.
@HeidiHasz @RalphNortham I don't he should be in office either.
@TheCheekyGinger @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 I agree with you. My original tweet was based on what I saw as folks being incredibly shocked at this one photo and that photo seeming completely out of character for him...now there is more information that it *wasn't* as out of character, in which case he should resign.
@jules_26965 @sc_vaughn @RalphNortham I am sort of surprised it wasn't gotten years ago.		I ran for office last year - it didn't even cross my mind to think of photos from the 80s (of course I don't have any photos of me in blackface, so I guess that would be weird to think about).
@lissie_w @Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 I didn't say any of that.
@Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 ...apparent that he was not taking responsibility.		Our society has done and continues to do things that are awful to POC, women, vulnerable groups. You shouldn't have to live in a world where your shade of human is reason for harm. I want the hard work done so it's not.
@Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 Having supporters attuned to him being a very different person that college. It appears that is not the case, which is why I said he should kick rocks and be socially ostracized. I was working from the premise that he wasn't that person anymore. After that tweet it became...
@Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 My original tweet on Northam was based on the perspective that he did something stupid/horrible in college, and then paid penance for that by growing up into the sort of person who fought against that for decades - as would be evidenced by the endorsements, surviving vetting...
@DoriPrevin @RalphNortham My original point was that a long career not being racist should enable redemption for a single, horrible, racist costume decades ago in college...but it sounds like that was *not* his career path. If that was not his career path, then he shouldn't be in office.
@CrisBaker6 @DavidGr78574965 @RalphNortham I did not see the "wasn't me" until after that tweet. Wasn't me isn't acknowledgement of wrong and growth.
@KatDBishop @RalphNortham This is how I feel about zero tolerance.
@Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 Well that's not the conversation I'm interested in having. I'd like to discuss how we handle the systematic, lower-level, daily issues of racism, sexism, etc. from a range of perspectives that generates actual change.
@TheCheekyGinger @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 No. Let's have a conversation about real consequences happening earlier and more often.
@blackgirlinmain @RalphNortham My original opinion was based on his misdeed being a single photo that was enabled by the school decades ago...his subsequent acts, which I did not know about in the first tweet, and a pattern are disqualification from office.
@TheBrofucius @DavidGr78574965 @RalphNortham King, Moore, McConnell et al should not be in office.
@IsaLeeWolf @VeeCeeMurphy76 My original tweet qualified that my opinion was based on it being a single instance,  and concluded with current behavior/part of a pattern should be socially ostracized.  Folks showed more evidence of current behavior, I said he should kick rocks and be ostracized.
@lyn_cade @Kalarigamerchic @VeeCeeMurphy76 I do not think it supercedes.		No one should have to first compare pain and abuse to fight against pain and abuse together.
@GregoryMcKelvey @RalphNortham @ninaturner That's an excellent point. It's the middle bit where everything slides and everyone acts like it's "normal"...ot should not be normal.
@janis_wilds @sc_vaughn @RalphNortham For Ralph's situation specifically it must be incredibly sad and stressful to be a member of the community that theust him forward as a representative. Ultimately, I think they should be in the driver's seat for that specific situation.
@Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 History of sexual violence. If I want to raise our sons to be not racist, not sexist, etc part of that is them seeing me actively participate in achieving a society that isn't any of those things.
@Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 I do have an obligation to participate in a conversation that I have previously opted out of. Our voices are all important and by choosing silence in the past I was enabling a less robust discussion. I kept quiet on a range of topics because I didn't want to deal with my own...
@Kalarigamerchic @Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 That is not at all what I am saying. I am also a survivor of sexual violence. I do think we'd have a lot less sexual violence, racism, homophobia, etc if we change the dialogue around it, intervene often and early.		I don't need to control the narrative...
@GregoryMcKelvey @RalphNortham @ninaturner We shouldn't have to be at egregious to have intervention.
@quigley_suzie Right. We don't have much in the way of intermediate consequences and interventions to answer those questions.
@TheCheekyGinger @Kalarigamerchic @VeeCeeMurphy76 I absolutely agree we cannot "kumbaya our way out of racism"...I see us doing not much of anything until there is a blow up, photo, recording - and that is not a comprehensive enough solution.
@IsaLeeWolf @VeeCeeMurphy76 I didn't claim I was some sort of authority on the subject.		I have the personal opinion that we should be addressing some of these issues differently.
@Mandy_RN13 @RalphNortham The bigger problem to me is literally hundreds of people must have known about that photo.
@VeeCeeMurphy76 @whinemomOK When I sent out the tweet, I  thought it was that one photo. I'm so exhausted with us not dealing with the actions leading up to the monsters.		There is so much in the space beyween no bad behavior and Steve King. We'd have a lot fewer Kings if we addressed the inbetween.
@GregoryMcKelvey @RalphNortham @ninaturner When I sent the first tweet I was only aware of the one photo. I clearly stated that a pattern of behavior should fall into kicking rock while being socially ostracized. 		We need to have a bigger conversation though. There are so many low level infractions with no consequences.
@nipperdawg @RalphNortham @senatemajldr I don't think Mitch should be in his position
@Kalarigamerchic @VeeCeeMurphy76 I think we need to deal with all of it. It stems from the same space of being entitled to more than one actually is entitled to, being better than others because of some unearned privilege.
@TheCheekyGinger @VeeCeeMurphy76 We meed way more than a series of resignations
@IsaLeeWolf @VeeCeeMurphy76 I don't feel like it is most of our call to make. My opinion is on a larger issue - how do we do the work to fix our society, who should do it, how ahould it be done, how do we get out of this mess?
@Cycle4 @VeeCeeMurphy76 Yeah, I saw that after I tweeted. 		Again, pattern = kick rocks.		We still need to be having a way bigger conversation here.
@whinemomOK @VeeCeeMurphy76 I don't want to sacrifice them. I want to get to a space where we start having conversations and action that actually repairs all this crud instead of the awful cycle we are trapped in.
How do we do that? How do we reconcile the range of past abuses with moving forward? How do we talk about this productively?		Let's talk about it.
I don't think every person who has ever grabbed me should be unemployable for life. I don't think every person to witness unacceptable behavior and stayed silent should pay an indefinite penalty. I do think we need a way to shift from where we are without brushing it under a rug.
The world I grew up in had some of my best memories with my father being a YMCA Indian Princess. It wasn't a big deal if boys/men grabbed you, no matter how unpleasant it was, guys just got the promotions...many of us have been on the receiving end and unintentionally offenders.
Most of us have grown up in a society where racism, sexism, etc was (and still is) so normalized that we don't always recognize it as actionable unless it's outrageous.
What I don't see is addressing low-level issues in a productive way.		We seem the eyeroll "trivial" infractions until we hit "off with their head", and there is a *ton* of intervention between the two we should be talking about.
We will never solve this problem playing whack a mole on individual racists, sexists, etc, nor will we be able to move society to where it should be without addressing the harms/demonstrating in how to move forward. Some people will be too far gone for redemption; most aren't...
Let's have a bigger conversation that #RalphNortham.		American society is *full* of abuse and subjugation. It manifests in racism, sexism, countless forms of discrimination, abuse, and violence. We've all seen it. Most of us have experienced some form(s) of it.		How do we fix it?
@VeeCeeMurphy76 I considered the impact that highly offensive and oppressive image may have on a group, but I was not aware there was more until I tweeted. I think this is a way more nefarious problem that can't be resolved by a series of resignations. We need an actual societal shift.
@Jesmaec @KaylaraOwl @RalphNortham I had only seen the one photo when I tweeted and it had been all over my feed. It appears like he should be in the kick rocks category.		I *do* think we have a much bigger conversation afoot.
@blainekell6 @ManInTheHoody @TalbertSwan @mmpadellan @coleyworld @B52Malmet @goodoldcatchy @MissNyetTrump Unfortunately, it appears ot was more than that one photo....however, there is a larger conversation to be had about low-level infractions regarding race, sex, etc.
@VeeCeeMurphy76 My perspective isn't actually about my skin. I'm trying to apply my most similar frame of reference, which is that of someone who has experienced sexual discrimination, sexual violence, and an environment that constantly hypersexualizes women.
@sc_vaughn @RalphNortham It happens with sexual violence, it happens with racism, it happens with a variety of systemic abuses. If we don't address limited instances, and casual observers who don't intervene in a way that is forward-looking, we'll never fully root out these abusive social tendencies.
@sc_vaughn @RalphNortham I think of all of the times someone grabbed me, there were people watching, and no one said a thing...I don't think everyone should lose their jobs - I do think at least some of them should reflect and commit not to be silent in the future.
@sc_vaughn @RalphNortham My opinion is party-neutral. I think we've got to have some path to say "I was a product of being raised with a horrible point of view. I did something I shouldn't have or didn't speak up when I should have -we change that now and I will be the example."
@CarriWeatherwax It appears there was more than the one photo...in which case shame on those doing the vetting and he should kick rocks. I think the problem is getting racism, sexism, etc requires hard work from more than just the recipients of poor treatment.
@mxs_chick @Mahaleris I think resigning does not destroy his life. It appears there is more than the photo, which moves him to the kick rocks pile...but as a society, we should have a mechanism for restorative justice in some of these cases.
@MrDavidGrant @RalphNortham Perhaps they should have led with that.
@Mahaleris That is more than a single bad photo. My premise was a single bad photo.
@ChesterGreen77 @RalphNortham This is a actually party-neutral opinion. I'm not a Democrat.
@BBWave2018 @RalphNortham I think it was a horrible idea, completely inappropriate - and I cannot believe he was not pulled aside by friends, yearbook staff, school administrators, etc. The entire system he was in failed alongside this awful choice.
@Mahaleris So you don't think people ever change? I watch low-level criminal offenders have a poor choice destroy their lives until they have worked through a long series of redemption steps - why should we not apply that to those in power?
@cryptopitcher @RalphNortham I absolutely agree with that...where is the microscope on that?
@HiFlowHead @RalphNortham If there is a pattern of racism, he should go in the kick rocks pile.
@MAFgeek *years
@RalphNortham To be clear, this philosophy does not apply to those beyond redemption, actively involved in current racist, sexist, etc acts...they can go kick rocks in solitude ostracized from society.
@RalphNortham I'm tired of the solution being go away. I want people to have to contribute to fixing our broken system. An apology is not sufficient, earn your redemption. 		Redemption *should* be available with consistent, apparent, productive efforts by doing the actual work of restitution.
@RalphNortham I think the penalty is hard labor; spend the rest of your term ferreting out racial injustices systematically present in your state. Fix disparities in education, criminal justice, any innocuous seeming policy that isn't.		I'd want restorative justice that repairs wrongs.
Am I the only one who thinks @RalphNortham shouldn't resign?		If this is truly a case of a single really bad yearbook photo followed by a career devoid of any hints of racism, I think resigning is the easy way out.		Stick with me here...
Are we all collectively ignoring this? https://t.co/Pj9xTqXdna

@Ziggiezaggie Yeah it's a less spicy gumbo/jambalaya with more shelled things and saffron.
@sadgingerale It actually looks a touch more like jambalaya, but probably tastes a bit more like gumbo...it's a less spicy somewhere between the two, with saffron.
@sadgingerale It's like if gumbo were not cajun, and was served with more things with shells in Spain. The go-to dish for all seaside towns around Barcelona, also a good side dish for sangria. https://t.co/ZsqOppLWCC

@cspengler Expressing that I think someone who is not a resident of my state should not run is not that an attack, loss of composure, or lack of dignity. It's almost like some folks from out of Maine don't want the opinion of folks who vote in Maine about our elected officials. Weird.
@cspengler You aren't a voter here. I absolutely think I have a right to tell people my opinion on who I think might be successful in my own jurisdiction.		I certainly don't tell folks who I think they should vote for in San Diego...I have vacationed there, but I wouldn't run there.
@cspengler Yeah, the profile pic was in response to a lawsuit filed regarding the election.		The point of the campaign was *not* to spend money, but instead to put the resources in the community. Can I interest you in a #MaineRaising?	https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
Who is going to do the most good this year?		Can't wait for election season so we see which charities are boosted.		I'm so excited to support local businesses on behalf of my favorite candidate.		Jazzed for debates about real issues.		This is what election season could be. https://t.co/3Yu0VT3pnw
@RaulersonDavid @SRuhle It was bizzaro world, right? My name was just...missing from most of the reporting.
@anylaurie16 I ran against 11 middle-aged white dudes last year. 11.
@sadgingerale Always go back for hash browns.
@lyndellmbade It's very hard to survive here. My day job shows me on a frequent basis that we are really at the threads in Maine, even if "middle class".
If I had media support @SRuhle, I would run that same campaign against Susan Collins. Instead, the media covers ridiculous people, ineffective ideas, unkind policy, and bickering. Most media wouldn't even use my name.		We are getting the government we deserve if this is our media
PS - I got 5.7% of the vote for &lt;$800 (16,552 votes), pumping thousands of dollars into our economy.		@SRuhle, just imagine what would have happened if I had gotten coverage. I was in one of the most wasteful, expensive races in the country. Millions of $ that could have helped.
*cough, cough*		My campaign last year @SRuhle. No one in national media would cover it. I literally built a congressional campaign on being competent, kind, helpful, and focusing resources back to the community through charity and small business support.		https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8 https://t.co/1ZZlAxCB3n

@TraitorGOP We do have people in Maine....with degrees and credentials and stuff.
@JackedKerouack Portland? Or Maine in general?		I'm not a Democrat, so you'd probably want to ask a Dem. I am good at the middle slice that anyone who wins needs to get, and it'd be a big deal there.
Howard should be more concerned with independents telling him to kick rocks.		Howard Schultz 'freaked out' by Democratic backlash to independent presidential run, rethinks effort  https://t.co/GXEkMgKksC #FoxBusiness
@JackedKerouack Why start with 3 strikes against you when there are more electable candidates that just need the exposure?
@JackedKerouack Those are interesting academic points, but at the end of the day it is difficult in most places to elect someone who isn't living in a state to represent that state...extra hard in someplace like Maine where from away is a hex, made harder by Susan winning her past races easily.
@JackedKerouack I am biased. Absolutely. I want Susan not in office anymore and resources most effectively allocated to make that a thing.		I don't want millions of dollars thrown at a campaign that will maybe get 40%.
@shannonladiva @PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice @SenatorCollins Susan is who she has been for a very long time. She has voted conservative while playing moderate fairly consistently.		The challenge is getting someone from Maine with the right message elevated. Susan has closing in on 500k social media followers, unlimited $, media appearances
@JackedKerouack My certainty is based on both living in Maine and running for Congress last year in Maine.
@JackedKerouack If there was something you ever did not need to poll Maine on it's "would you vote for someone who declared an intention to run for office not living here and then who moved significantly later to run".		Maybe, *maybe* one of the late Bushes could have done it, maybe.
@cspengler Twitter says you are in San Diego - are you a registered Maine voter?
@shannonladiva @PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice @SenatorCollins We do have people who live here that are qualified.		It's pretty offensive to most Mainers to have someone say they are going to move to your state with the implication that they know your state better than you do since they've vacationed here, no matter how well-intentioned.

@PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice I'm telling you as a resident of Maine that anyone who moves here to run will not be seen as representing the interests of Maine...and I say this as someone who does not think Susan Collins should be representing us and as someone who ran for Congress last year.
@PhilduranJ @schmermund_k @DisavowTrump20 @AmbassadorRice yeah....so Maine doesn't work like that. Susan Rice runs, it'll be a Dems import a power candidate from away to try to tell Maine what to do/mess in our business, and Rice will lose. We have locals with a better chance. Use resources effectively.
@DLeeHeff She is not a Maine resident.
@disqus_sk_user 2019 could use a little idealism
@OverUnderClover @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems Exactly. I'd do a few more pro bono cases here and there if I didn't have outrageous student loans....I'd also probably do more staycations, date nights, and indulge my local honey addiction. I'm sure it would pump more money into the local economy.
@disqus_sk_user Catch 22. I don't have the support to run at the present....not likely to get the support unless an announced candidate. If enough people supported me, I would consider.
I'd really like a program those of us living here with high student loan burdens can access. We'd probably have more attorneys and medical professionals in rural areas if we could make this a thing. https://t.co/MMGnrBIbaS
@disqus_sk_user It's too early to announce in Maine.

@cooljeanius Let me know if you all want someone to talk about the experience as a candidate 😉
Bonus - if everyone in the country who likes independents does this, we can probably prevail over Susan Collins...which a Dem is exceedingly unlikely to do.		Win-win?
Here is my revolutionary idea...if you all want 3rd party candidates to succeed, pick an independent candidate in Maine to support. We have ranked choice voting here.		✔Show the system works to elect independents	✔Get #RCV where you live	✔Live happily ever after https://t.co/wqqvxdAeSS

Maybe listen to and follow people you want in office?		#mepolitics https://t.co/3OO52HUJfC
@mikefromdexter @AngryBlackLady The funny thing in Maine is there are more of us that are unenrolled in a party than are in either party. We are the largest voting block available.
@mikefromdexter @AngryBlackLady We are fortunate to have RCV and value independent candidates in Maine so that we can have viable alternatives.
@smotus I prefer this formula more with underwear gnomes.
@sevenheismans @JoyAnnReid Money =/= votes. Someone who moves to Maine to run will lose. If you want Collins to lose, ind a functional local candidate.
@AngryBlackLady It is intensely frustrating to run for office as a woman and have people ask you to compare yourself to Jill Stein. What do you say to that? I'm running for office, she's partying in Russia?
@TerryPullBurd @HawaiiDelilah @AmbassadorRice No one who has to move to Maine to run will win...but it's a lovely place to live if you'd like to move here :)

@jack_mandle @The_Smashter @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz Who do you think is going to beat Susan?
@lmlTN @dmsauvageau Our results won't change until we demand coverage change. I had always sort of (wrongly) assumed that if someone didn't get covered they were a nut...that's not accurate. One of the biggest lessons I took away is that our media excludes an amazing amount of information.
@taylorasen I disagree that this will in any way be effective.
@jack_mandle @The_Smashter @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz If the independent comes in 3rd in a race with Susan, Susan wins.
@dfa2066 They should be, but are not. I bet we could probably categorize effectively several of them into "insider trading" motivations.
@LeoDVinci59S @ASFried See: my entire campaign last year 😉
@LeoDVinci59S @ASFried I think it's the least important pain point to fix...and very few federal legislators are currently motivated by their paycheck.
@SteveCollinsSJ @ASFried That doesn't change it not fixing the actual problem...how about we timely pay people when they work for us at all salary levels because that's what responsible employers are required to do?
@Softcoffle It may require adapting other rules, but we made the rules up, right?		We simply shouldn't turn federal government into a hostage situation. Those jobs protect us, our common needs, our shared assets...that it not partisan and should be treated as partisan.
@Softcoffle I would have to research but I would imagine either including an extension clause of some sort in the original budget and/or some sort of blanket clause that automatically continues prior year budget in absence of a new budget. There must be a method to make it work.
@Softcoffle It's silly, unnecessary legislation that won't accomplish your goal.		Instead, pass legislation making it not possible to shut down government. Wouldn't that be a far more productive use of energy?
@1liners Yeah, make it not possible to shut down the government by maintaining the status quo.
This is a silly idea. It penalizes the representatives most likely to be aware of the harm instead of the wealthy representatives...just make government shut downs not possible by operating under past budgets or some other mechanism.		#mepolitics https://t.co/XZ8QIcDbAn

@The_Smashter @jack_mandle @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz Do you have 500k followers laying around for me?
@The_Smashter @jack_mandle @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz Proposal?
@The_Smashter @jack_mandle @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz She's still polliong over 50%. For rcv to work, both top candidates must end below 50%...and in the case of Susan, it would take a popular moderate independent to beat her. Angus King could, but he already has a Senate seat.
@jack_mandle @The_Smashter @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz Different race structure. Neither Bruce nor Jared was good at that middle slice, so the disposition of the independent had influence of who would be picked in a close race.		Susan *is* good at the middle slice, so you need the dem to come in 3rd for anyone to knock out Susan.
@The_Smashter @jack_mandle @LarrySabato @TheRichWilkins @HowardSchultz That race has a structural problem. It would be easier for an independent to knock her out than a dem.
@transscribe @NateSilver538 I so appreciate that.		It was interesting, right? And informative, and good, and helpful, and kind...all the things that haven't been things in politics.
@transscribe @NateSilver538 It's astonishing how much power the media has to sink or float a candidate.
@NateSilver538 I told you in June how my race would turn out...your team wouldn't even say my name.
@NateSilver538 Oh @natesilver538, we should do a pod about this.		I got 5.7% of the vote in my congressional race last year spending  &lt;$800. If I had gotten *any* functional national coverage, even just using my name and explaining RCV, I probably could have won..my voters determined the race.

@hellonwheels72 I ran for Congress last year. 😂		President? I like my marriage. Thank you very much.
@hellonwheels72 I know. If I wrote the laws, I would eliminate drinking I public as a charge entirely, provide some sort of boarding house with services and basics that had a space to sober up, get tidy, serve as an address for employment, etc. It would be less than jail and get more working.
@cdanielthompson @jlupf Find joy in agreement Dan.
@hellonwheels72 Enough misdemeanors equal felonies. If you don't have money, don't have a way to make money, and need things like deodorant, it's hard to collect enough bottles in a Maine winter for that.
@hellonwheels72 This is my least favorite part when I am Lawyer of the Day at court....seriously, we are giving people felonies for thefts of less than $20 for being poor? It costs more to put them in jail than to provide some basics. It's both inhumane and crazy wasteful.

@Al_in_Maine We're not going to agree on the wall. Neither one of us is voting so it's silly to argue about.
@Al_in_Maine @D10xide I don't like it for either side. I'm consistent in my dislike.
@Al_in_Maine There is a *huge* difference between repair/refurbish existing fencing, hire agents, add surveillance tech - and big, impossible to build, wasteful wall.
@Al_in_Maine @D10xide I don't like the last minute unrelated jam ins. The 1301 page senate bill was riddled with deal-breakers and items that needed more info.
@Al_in_Maine There is already a physical barrier for the portions of the border is it practical methodology for. We need better tech, not a wall.
@Al_in_Maine @D10xide There was way more in that bill. It was a bad faith offer.
@Al_in_Maine I did not suggest open borders. The wall, as repeatedly proposed, will not work.
@Al_in_Maine @D10xide The shut down is because the executive branch rejected bipartisan compromise and the legislative branch is not overriding the veto.
@Al_in_Maine The wall is wasteful and won't stop drugs. There was a bipartisan plan, it was rejected.

@Donald_Booker @ASFried It's part of requiring Congress to be accountable. It's really hard to expect people to take seriously how broken the bills are and process is in general when we don't even expect reps to read what they vote on.
@Donald_Booker @ASFried I think they are tied to some extent. These beast bills get really inappropriate things snuck into them that fundamentally alter rights. Giving Congress a pass to not pay attention to the laws inflicted on all of us is a problem.
@RuPaulLePage I haven't seen the Sopranos. I already have enough sleeping challenges that I'm not keen on adding meth.

This smells so good.		Y'know, if I ever end up in federal office, the thing I will miss most is our nightly kitchen cooking dance parties. It started when the Mr. and I just started dating.

Did your social media team run this one past anyone else before sending it out? 		A little bit of cherrypicking with your gun advocacy. Do you want to also discuss what measures would have kept the gun from his assassin? A holistic approach would better honor his legacy. https://t.co/GK3q0UpBMS
@TVietor08 I am picturing the look on...any Judge's face if I said these words out loud.
@logannite4 @NotMYRep @kashanacauley @joke2power Do you have any sources on that?
@logannite4 @NotMYRep @kashanacauley @joke2power I was replying to notifications, not the thread. I don't work in that genre of law, but I don't think I have ever heard of someone being prosecuted here for harboring and I don't know the legal defenses.		In the abstract, one is still active, the other passive.
@logannite4 @NotMYRep @kashanacauley @joke2power What kind of criminal are you hiding?
@logannite4 @NotMYRep @kashanacauley @joke2power You are asking the difference between willfully harboring someone in the active commission of a felony, and passively helping someone in a way that only saves their life who *might* be engaged in a misdemeanor that you did not witness...or it could help any rando who is lost.
@logannite4 @NotMYRep @kashanacauley @joke2power Say you help someone who falls while jaywalking...where you witness both the illegal act and actively aid. What category is that in?
@logannite4 @NotMYRep @kashanacauley @joke2power There is a huge chasm between hiding a violent criminal in your home and leaving water in the desert.

@darkwingfuckk @jonnycat222 If you want it with dumplings, make a big pot.		Combine 2 c flour, 3 tsp baking powder, healthy pinch salt, half a stick of butter right out of the fridge - mix together in a food processor or with a fork and gusto. Mix in about 3/4 cup of milk until it just holds together.
@darkwingfuckk @jonnycat222 For applesauce?		Peel and cut up apples (granny smith are my favorite for cooking, but really almost any apple will do)		Add enough water to just barely see it through the apple slices, but not enough to be at the top		Add cinnamon, nutmeg, and maple syrup to taste

@WillIkard @SteveCollinsSJ @MaineMillennial @JoeBiden It should force us into the conversation of what range of incomes works for Congress, and where on the spectrum we want to fall between being connected with Congress vs. being connected with our communities back home.
@SteveCollinsSJ @MaineMillennial We need to get to a place where middle class can participate in our government without renting a shady, not particularly secure room from randos off craigslist.
@SteveCollinsSJ @MaineMillennial Ideally 2-3 bedrooms, 2 beds if you are a single (1 space to sleep, 1 to use for remote office), 3 beds if you have family that is with you at least part of the year. If I brought my kids down, I'd have them bunk up in one room like at home...and shared spaces to connect.
@WillIkard @SteveCollinsSJ @MaineMillennial It's something I certainly thought about when I was running for Congress. Do I commute back every week? I don't want to be away from my kids...but I don't want my kids to be away from Maine. How do I afford another residence? I joked I would take Bruce's murphy bed off his hands.
@SteveCollinsSJ @MaineMillennial That would be fine if there were private rooms, preferably like 1 bed/studios at a minimum. I think it would get incredibly uncomfortable with shared rooms and no ability to cook for yourself/secure your grocery purchases. I have a feeling a few in Congress are lunchbox raiders.
@GCharcz @BrucePoliquin They are different problems. If you put lawmakers in a position where they cannot afford multiple residences, to have families, pay student loans, etc on their salary you end up with lawmakers that don't have a lot of experience with anything other than being wealthy.
@MaineMillennial You could afford housing in DC on that salary, but not housing in DC, and Maine, and double utilities, and children, and student loan payments, and a car payment or two back home, and transportation in DC, and....		It puts our lawmakers in a compromised position if middle class.
@swardofthewood @BrucePoliquin https://t.co/luYpxZXmPd
I admit I agree with @BrucePoliquin on this. We should be providing DC housing or permit folks to be frugal by office couch surfing in offices should they choose (providing they are mindful of staff). I'd want to spend my money on my home in Maine and paying my student loans off. https://t.co/WtAa85d9Zz

@cc_demers @SenatorCollins Much easier to avoid credit for uncomfortable policy
@disqus_sk_user I blame each of them individually and equally.
@disqus_sk_user I didn't say any Dems voted no, our ire on this vote should be for those who voted no or didn't show up - equally levied. Saying it's GOP takes responsibility off those specific Senators. Each member of Congress should have responsibility for their votes as individuals.

@RickFranzblau Chellie's seniority is too beneficial.		She would sweep the floor with Jared.		Angus could beat her, but why?		You need an Angus situation - moderate, sane, D on the left to take the shots.
@northdixie Susan is excellent at managing the space I grabbed...and I can think of no one D or R that would run that can out gun her in that space.
@northdixie Any credible Dems are likely too far left to run center while remaining authentic. Anyone who is a functional moderate would run Independent...and unless the Dems sit out (which would be a cold day in Hell), won't have sufficient support.
@RickFranzblau Oh, I think lots of folks could credibly challenge...but winning is the problem.
@RickFranzblau I don't think he would want to.
@RickFranzblau Cohen is 78.
The support has to be there.		Not just $, support. You want someone to beat Susan, you have to lift up for who they are - completely unrelated to running against Susan.		You will *not* out maneuver Susan as an opposition force. You can be a greater force for good governance.		###
PLUS everyone who loves that stuff regardless.		I don't know that anyone in Maine has all of that and any desire to be in DC. Folks in Maine want to be...in Maine.		If you want that person(s), you need to find them and support them - follow, like and support the not Susan-ness.
You need someone who gets all the energy Susan gets, positive and negative, without even needing to mention Susan. If that energy could be used for something - for kindness, for good law, for getting money out of politics - and had the support of everyone mad at Susan...
You need an idea that is something to be for instead of something to oppose - that's the one thing I think I do have.		https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
You need a person who describes policy in a way that makes people really, truly want to listen.
It's not enough.		You need someone who on their own is charming, smart, kind, genuine, and able to command attention.		You need someone the TV shows will ask to come on air because they want that person's opinion, not because they are running against Susan.
You see, every time Susan says something she gets millions of impressions, reactions, responses and she starts a flurry of activity. I just had a response to her go slightly viral, heading to 10k likes.		https://t.co/IzzshFGVOC
Lots of folks have asked me who can beat Susan Collins. After much deliberation, I have the answer.		Since I'm stuck in a long line, it looks like you will be getting it now.		You need someone everyone loves more than they dislike Susan.		That sounds way easier than it is...

@kpendered It's not just how long she's been in Congress. She has been amazingly adept at pulling heat and distracting the media on behalf of the GOP.		We assign a different value that she brings to the table and that colors what we each think she can pull off.
@kpendered She should have the political leverage to have Mitch bring the vote.
@kpendered I think she should be working McConnell. She won't get anwhere with the executive branch. She absolutely should have the leverage with McConnell...and if she doesn't after 4 terms and her political score sheet, she doesn't belong on the hill.
@kpendered I just want the job done well. I'm not motivated by the pomp and circumstance.
@kpendered We have different perspectives on Susan's political power. I think she has more power with her (at least perceived) swing vote than you do.		I've had to borrow to pay a mortgage due before. I've not been paid for work performed. If she cared, she'd throw her power at this.
@kpendered I think you underestimate Susan's political savvy and power...and her ability to put on a dog and pony when she wants to look like she's doing something, but doesn't actually want to do it.
@gratifihouston That $ will backfire
@kpendered Right. She needs to go to the Senate. There is no point in going to the executive branch other than to look like she is doing something that she knows is doing nothing.
@kpendered Here is the disconnect 		saying you want to help =/= putting forward any meaningful, effective efforts to help		Susan regularly makes statements like this and then does nothing, or takes merely superficial action.
@kpendered She is in the Senate...		Susan has a long history of being faux-useless when she doesn't want to functionally work on a problem.

@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump We agree that immigration policy and enforcement is a mess.		I do not see it as a reason to shut down the government. It is not more urgent than it has been a myriad of times in our history. If it was so terribly urgent, it should have been prioritized over less urgent tax code.
@djtavares779 Which is why we have equal branches of government
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump And also at a much lower rate than previous decades - do you think we should prioritize not paying federal workers, our own citizens, over new fencing?
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump My belief is not partisan.		I do not think we should have shutting the government down be an acceptable negotiating tactic.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump Shutting down government is not an acceptable negotiation strategy.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump I don't actually believe that he wants it to open, but it's ok if we disagree on something that truly neither of us will objectively know the answer to.		There was a negotiated compromise in Congress. It was rejected by the executive branch.
@PowellBerger @WarrenMKlein @SenatorCollins You have to presume she agrees with them,  or at least with something she is getting out of it. Susan is a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of those things.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump I actually don't think he wants to open the government. Regardless, this stalemate has the wrong people paying the consequences.		The border has lots of physical border.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump I don't think either side wants to compromise much. However, Congress had an agreement. It was rejected, they should take that agreement, circumvent the barrier, and work on swapsies for DACA, border security, etc, etc WITHOUT shutting down the government.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump I don't actually care if folks want to blame D or R.		I think it is ridiculous to close the government down. I approach this like I would a settlement - grab everything that can be agreed on, almost everything here, and move the sore spot off the table with less pressure.
@MCellaneous She's not.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump The Senate is holding the line on the vote. It's the job of Congress to check the executive branch when it makes a bad call - they are equal, not subordinate.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump Then she's not a very effective 4-term Senator who often hold controlling vote, is she?

@JammedBus @JimMcFalls @SenatorCollins ...do you have 500k followers and a few million shoppers hiding anywhere?
@Cole_not_Coal_ ...have you ever seen anything about our current executive branch team that would lead you to believe that they agree with you?
@WarrenMKlein I think the GOP in Senate have the ability to re-open the government - tabling the wall issue for negotiations not tied to paying federal workers. That appears to not be their choice. A 4 term Senator who has tremendous influence could change this within a few days.
@Al_in_Maine A lot of people are lean right after holidays, a cold snap, COLAs not keeping up, tax hikes, etc. My mortgage went up by like $90/month this month for taxes.
@JammedBus @JimMcFalls @SenatorCollins I don't know that I'm groomable. I'm pretty set in my ways. That's a part of my charm.
@Al_in_Maine I'm not super concerned with blaming people working for no pay for their financial errancy here.
@WarrenMKlein Expecting the executive branch to be different is unrealistic. I expect my Senator to have compassion and work ethic, using the available work arounds for such a situation when she has the power, skill, and ability to do so.
@AKB00219343 You are really underestimating Susan
@rodgercarver Presume she votes how she wants
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump I think she has the political skills to make it happen, or at least I would hope she does given that she has been the decision-making vote lately.

As I mull a poor sock choice waiting for a motion ruling, I let my mind wander to if this day would have been a good day to wear slippers to court.		I contemplate this regularly, carefully weighing who might be on bench..if s/he might also have slippers on.		Today is not the day.
Awww not Carol Channing.		RIP raspberries.
@ulysses23 @SenatorCollins You are severely underestimating Susan
@awakenddreamer No one in Maine will fault a Mainer for coming home to Maine on the weekends. We'd generally prefer it.
@lovinabox Most folks in Congress have no concept of actual struggling.
@BohdiBohdi @SenatorCollins You underestimate her.
@Integrity4Maine All that would do is punish legislators who are most likely the ones more motivated to fix this situation...us having legislators that are independently wealthy and don't treat making law like a career add to the problem.
Be kind to federal workers today. Those with a mortgage, this is likely the last day of the grace period.		Mortgage late fees can be hundreds of dollars and most mortgage providers won't take partial payments. A single late payment can spiral to forclosure.

@willsolly @Leslie_resists @GOP She has a spine, she uses it to vote conservative
@JKarell @veganwithabeef @AltSpaceForce1 She is not drunk. Criticism of that particular issue will rally support to Susan faster than just about any other. I suggest digging in on votes.
@SKeele17 @SenSusanCollins @realDonaldTrump To credit Susan, she should be on Mitch. No one is going to convince our executive branch to do anything...I think Susan is a wizard at spin, that is beyond spin.
@THE_ECB @SenatorCollins Running her mouth covers her vote
@ggluck63 She's not a flipper. She has a pretty consistent voting record.
@ruschmills @AmbassadorRice I would be shocked if Rice could win here.
@KevinPMiller3 She's doing the same job, the same way - unfortunately we pay more attention to her folksy charms than her votes when we vote
@mcm50_karen @MaestraMex @EdKrassen @SenatorCollins She is an exceedingly effective conservative who also spins a mighty moderate yarn.
@Sadjaxx The clutching is her dog and pony to avoid credit
@Mskiddo06 She is very effective for conservative voters.
@hockeytank12 @realDonaldTrump She does have the political resources to force a veto-proof vote. She chooses not to use those resources.
@1stcanuck @EdKrassen Because she has nearly unlimited financial resources, the ability to command media at the drop of a hat, and the skill to spin any opposition into histrionic and unbalanced, not reflecting our moderate views - supported by those from away trying to change us.
@LeonLSutton @afineonesir @SenatorCollins Sadly, the institution of Congress will get blamed. Susan will effectively spin her trying for us all.
@keithasims @KassandraSeven She will get credit locally for empathy, tact, and trying real darn hard to act because she goes on tv and has nice press releases.
@awakenddreamer Her house is in Bangor.		If Congress were not getting paid, you'd harm those who are likely not the problem here. A sad amount of Reps really don't work for the pay.
@southiekitkat Ah, but her party doesn't really. There is this nice little tension between the executive branch and Congress where things don't totally align and there is wiggle room to spin both directions.
@RedAvia Just roll with her actions and you'll see her for what she is - a brilliant, effective conservative legislator that is impressively adept at diffusing any negative consequences of her votes on a local level.
@UbeachA @EdKrassen @realDonaldTrump Nothing I say will have any impact on his behavior. I can say with a pretty high level of confidence he has no interest in my opinion on this topic.
@MAXIMUSCESAR2 @EdKrassen My criticism is Susan specifically. On a local level there are plenty of kind, compassionate, wonderful Republican women.

@MikeyV1960 I make a hell of a chocolate cake.
@LiberalWarriors @lipstickham There are moderates, no GOP moderates at the federal level that I know of....and Susan is not a moderate.
@ruthumstweets Susan has near-unlimited money, the ability to get any media coverage she wants at the drop of a hat...and almost always favorable, and she is a damn wizard at spin. It'll take a Maine King (Angus or Stephen), or an act of God to get her out of office.

@Ceilidhann @ceilidhann - I had to follow for this journey. 😂
@taylorasen Nothing about this statement surprises me.		We should all strive to coexist. We don't all have to agree, and we are better for having a diverse range of views...some of which will be more fantastical that others.
It is not difficult to extend kindness to people with whom you do not agree. Doing so makes it easier to find common ground where you do agree and makes it easier to have conversations if one changes views later.		Tldr: it's not that hard to not be a dick		#mepolitics https://t.co/Y4EJBK9UoC

@AmyTambone Ebola is terrifying if it gets to a major urban center (terrifying period, but much more so with urban density)...and it's not even hypothetical. It's almost certain to happen eventually.

@serenebabe That's how we've been conditioned, which is a sad testament to where we are. We hear language that the other political party may use and it's seen as stoking hate/fear instead of saying "I hear you, I'm speaking how you recognize this language, don't let this divide us".
@serenebabe We should be focused on why our government doesn't work...and frankly we should be scolding any leaders D or R that are sending in BS bills that are either very poorly thought out, or designed to exploit the tension between those bands.
@serenebabe Effectively tranching us into "everyone else doesn't understand how close I am to complete financial devastation" bands that are tied to different political views masks that a whole lot more of us are struggling than many would guess.
@serenebabe I assure you my concern is not "those poors are going to get all your money". Rather, that there are a ton of folks all the way up to lower wealthy rungs that are hanging on by a thread, but you'd never know it unless you are in their financials.
@taylorasen @RuPaulLePage That lots of folks need to read, and it consumes staff time/resources, and it needs to be entered into the system...if it's truly to highlight a concern, use a floor speech and/or 60 seconds on @MeetThePress.
@RuPaulLePage @taylorasen I personally don't care for ridiculous legislation, even if it's to highlight a problem. If you want to highlight a problem, there is media for that. Don't gum up process with superfluous bills.
@serenebabe I think our elected officials should fix the problems they create. This just makes the problem bigger. I'm not a R/D/L...any party. Landlords should have this burden no more than renters. The bill gets us fighting with each other instead of mad at government, that's a problem.
@serenebabe It's odd that having compassion for more than the "proper" group and keeping the focus on the government being responsible for government choices (not shifting their failures back to private citizens/companies) makes me a republican or a libertarian in your eyes.
@serenebabe Of course the real problem is why isn't the government open and/or paying workers. This isn't a protecting some bill. This is a shift the harm from some to others without any study or consideration for who it may be more harmful to. That's not good law.
@serenebabe It shouldn't be possible for the government to not pay it's workers, and certainly not possible to pay without the same repercussions as a small business that would likely owe for interest, legal fees, fines, etc. The standard should be higher when you are government, not lower.
@serenebabe Instead of getting engaged in class warfare where we dislike each other and argue about who should be responsible for the government not doing its job - why aren't we equally pissed at the government for trying to shove their failures back on us collectively?
@serenebabe Why should the government be able to tank anyone financially for their negligence? A huge amount of landlords are middle class (sometimes less) that are a couple of rent payments away from losing everything. They may be no more able to shoulder the burden than the renter.
@ASFried That still doesn't make it the responsibility of private individuals, small businesses, etc to provide services under a contract they are prohibited from enforcing the other side of. It's growing the problem to make more people unable to pay their bills.
@taylorasen @RuPaulLePage You are going to end up creating a market where landlords won't rent to federal employees...which is probably not super for federal employees. We can't simply make law that only looks at the burden for one impacted group. He should know better, this isn't his first rodeo.
@taylorasen @RuPaulLePage There shouldn't be a "something like this". Write a bill that doesn't allow furloughs then. It's no more impractical than this bill (which would also screw with state law since that's where landlord-tenant predominantly lives).
@taylorasen @MaineMillennial I don't know, it's a hypo. But does it matter? Most businesses couldn't survive for a extended period if costs remain static but income substantially decreases.
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen Why not make a bill that says you cannot stop paying employees because Congress fails to get its job done and/or a President refuses to sign a bill? Wouldn't that have the burden in the right place?
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen It's not the landlord's fault - why would we let the government force property owners into that situation when that wasn't what they signed up for? Insurance wouldn't cover it. Why should lawmakers not think of the burdens they create with bills that mask their negligence.
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen A huge amount of properties are rented at break-even or a loss to save credit, one day have a reitrement, etc. Many landlords have no choice but to evict or the will lose the property being rented, and maybe their primary home too.
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen Even commercial properties - say you saved up for years for a small apartment in the DC area and that is how you support yourself. Suddenly, half your units aren't paying and you can't eat...plus your only asset is now risking foreclosure. You aren't a jerk, it's not your fault.
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen I handle divorces on a shockingly regular basis where the couple moved to Maine and had a house where they were that they could not sell or chose not to sell, so they rented it and a few months of non-payment would destroy them financially.
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen ...there are a huge amount of landlords that are somewhat unintentional ones. They moved for work, school, family, inherited a property, etc and for whatever reason have a property to let. The burden shift to those folks is totally inappropriate, nor should they earn the anger.
@MaineMillennial @taylorasen No, they aren't. I have a house on the west coast. It was upside down when I moved to the east coast, so I couldn't sell. If the rent stops, I *have* to evict or I lose that house. I couldn't cover all costs for an indefinite time period nor should the government ask me to...
@RuPaulLePage @taylorasen Many landlords are private owners and a few months without rent would destroy them financially. Why is it their burden to shoulder?		It's the government's burden. They need to pay their workers.
@RuPaulLePage @taylorasen Why? We don't expect for the grocery store to not be reimbursed for food, for gas stations to hand out gas for free, etc. I am not saying "evict them all!" I am saying it's  not a landlord's burden the government isn't working.
@taylorasen Why should a landlord be responsible for that?
@nsilverberg ...that is some binge-watching stamina
@MaineMillennial I also remember seeing some at the monthly arts and crafts market in Lewiston. There are probably hundreds of artisnal coin purse and billfold makers in Maine.

@jack_mandle I don't think you understand why I am sharing. I'm not seeking validation.
@write_inbernie @JillPiggott I try to disagree with grace when possible. I threw myself up on the stage because I felt like there was an unrepresented segment. I wish more folks would recognize we won't get great leaders if the interview process is abusive, shallow, and unrealistic.
@jack_mandle Yes, but a lot of people do not.		A lot of people have no exposure to the market. Even many with ACA insurance don't face a lot of the paperwork hurdles since their subsidies drop a lot of the arguments to be had over who pays what. Your mileage may vary.
@JillPiggott @write_inbernie I think policy swipes are fine. There is a lot of abuse that comes with running for office that is not fine.		I also find repetitive engagement over moot topics that there is a known difference of opinion just to share you think someone is dumb is unproductive.
@jack_mandle I'm not sure what you arguing here. I did not claim I have a provider wand. I'm sharing my own experience. When I ran for office last year, I found it to be missing from the dialogue and it's an issue folks need to hear is on the radar.
@doryashore ...wait, you have spare kittens? 😬
@jack_mandle You can say whatever you want.		Pointing out a problem isn't mutually exclusive with there being benefits for others. I'm not whining for my benefit. The place I'm caught, it's what a lot of people trying to tear down the ACA grab onto...so maybe we should start talking about it?
@jack_mandle In my experience, it is different than employer provided coverage. It is different if you are self-employed vs. employed vs. unemployed because of how the subsidies work and the documentation required. If you don't have a subsidy, the insurance is incredibly expensive.
@jack_mandle Why must people always insert comparative value?		I am sharing an experience. My personal experience has nothing to do with the benefits brought. I am not *ignoring* benefits. I am sharing a pain point we need to address, particularly if we want wider buy in to this system.
@jack_mandle I wasn't arguing number of providers, actually for this particular thread I wasn't really pointing out solutions at all. I was sharing the experience of a self-employed person of at least average capacity attempting to make a doctor's appointment.
@jack_mandle Rural healthcare is even more frustrating.
@jack_mandle For many who are self-employed, the insurance available through the ACA is a nightmare. It's been largely ignored and that is a part of the reason you see so much opposition to the ACA.		We need to get in and fix stuff, in a meaningful way, particularly for this group of users.
@jack_mandle I have even read the ACA, in two different draft versions. There are thousands of little tweaks that should be made, most of which are not super relevant to this specific experience. 		I share these experiences because for many the ACA is very helpful.
@jack_mandle Do you talk to everyone this way? It must be really hard to have conversations.		I've had insurance in a range of places, with a variety of providers. The last 3 years through the marketplace under plans that are ACA compliant. There are massive flaws in the plans.
@jack_mandle I have had employer-provided coverage before, through a variety of providers until 2015 through my spouse, it was a very different experience.
@jack_mandle It's been a nightmare whether or not I've had a subsidy qualifying year. No subsidy is still a nightmare, still hours on the phone with insurer, marketplace, providers.
@jack_mandle Where was I talking about reimbursement rates?
@jack_mandle I anticipate I will start having marketplace problems after I file taxes where they will request an enormous amount of paperwork that does not exist due to the nature of my business...which was a nightmare last year.
@jack_mandle I know how to do it. It's the inordinate amount of time and energy required to do so. I also anticipate once I do finally get to see a doctor, I'm certain there will be another call or 5 to fix billing...and it's like this for everyone in my family.
@jack_mandle I *was* logged in to my insurance provider. I don't have a MD.
@jack_mandle It is the insurance available on the ACA exchanges.		I was clear if you scroll through this is insurance and provider, and that past issues have been insurance, provider, and marketplace. I have had employer-provided coverage, the Maine Med System was a different experience then.

@the_moonshadow The entire system is broken
@J_K_1984 This was just intake
@J_K_1984 It seems it might take a year to schedule a physical 😂
@RectitudeUSA @ASFried If he truly believed it was unconstitutional, he should have kept going. That argument should end with the lawsuit. There was the ability and forum to argue the point. It's been upheld. It's the law of the land and there is no point squabbling.
@J_K_1984 Governor is a very important job I currently have no interest in doing. It's very important to consider the work each job entails. I would happily dig into bills, manage staff, fix broken federal stuff...governor wouldn't mesh with my current family needs.
@J_K_1984 I think even if you are an attorney, you should also seek advice from others on most bills.		Heaven help office staff should I ever be elected, I'll have a bill reading book club 😂 It's not everyone's style but we could use a few folks in Congress with mundane eccentricities.
@J_K_1984 I don't think everyone in Congress should be a lawyer, nor do I think every genre of law is a good match for Congress...but I do think every person in Congress should read, and use reasonable resources to understand (both the meaning and impact), each law they vote for.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 They are different, but intertwined, things.
@woodworkedu @ASFried It's the type of insurance available through the ACA plans. I thought HP was horrible when I had it. Skipped dental this year.
@Finefragrancefa I'm happy to dispense credit to LePage, but these specific problems were likely not caused by him, or him in great part.
@ASFried Several thousand text changes in the ACA, permit Medicaid buy in.
@ASFried I had a separate, specific dental plan last year. I would presume dental insurance covers...dental.
@lgprime I'd like to see us have medicaid buy in at a minimum
@mmkay822 At no point have I suggested we take coverage or strive to increase it being unattainable.		At least in Maine it is simply unattainable for a huge amount of self-employed folks, and we have a huge amount of self-employed folks. Mainers tend to cobble together a living this way.
@mmkay822 It isn't that I don't want to hear that the ACA has helped people. I know it has. It also created a massive hole of hurt people...and we need to address that. Better than before isn't good enough to blow off as good as it could be.
@lgprime They should. Customer service and all that jazz. If you are going to be a private company, maybe try to provide customer service?
@mmkay822 It's really hit or miss depending on where you are. If you are self-employed it is particularly problematic because of the paperwork they want if there is any variance in your income...which is pretty commonplace when self-employed.
@EricEKeller Funny story about that. Precisely once in my life I made an appointment for a mental health provider for myself...and the therapist stood me up. 😂		It is very hard to find mental health providers in Maine. I have clients that can't find anyone with openings.
@EricEKeller The ACA could have been much better, but we can't fix the past.		There are winners and losers in any bill. The ACA is almost inpossible for middle class self-employed...which is a lot of Maine. We should have both political parties motivated to fix the pain points here.
Ps - I changed the PCPs for my men multiple times while on hold and finally had to have it changed manually by the woman helping me.		Pps - this is adult-language inducing as midnight legos.
@Finefragrancefa There is a lot of variance.
@lgprime That absolutely may be a factor, but it shouldn't take 3 hours. I should be able to call insurance and have them tell me right off the bat "we see there is a PCP shortage in your area, it looks like the average wait is 'x', and provider 'y' has the shortest wait"
@Finefragrancefa We have to do something.
@Bugl3t Maine
@charles_gaba It's the type of plans available in the exchanges...and I can do a several hundred tweet thread about the marketplace experiences I had last year, but no one wants to read that.		The ACA has done some good, but we keep ignoring that is has huge holes. We need to fix those.
@audreyameilia I just need a freaking PCP
@colleenhenness4 Truth.
You shouldn't feel like you need a mental health provider and a massage therapist because you tried to schedule a well visit.		Life goal 2019: actually accomplish a well visit and screening that should have happened at 40.		Fin.
Every single visit for my family has required multiple calls, often hours of time, *always* unexpected costs, and it is exhausting.		We have to do better than this. We need people who have experienced the nightmares in this system to have a seat at the table.
This is the type of experience that has happened to me with insurance purchased through the ACA marketplace.		These problems are insurer and provider created. Last year I had problems that were insurer, provider, and exchange created and I didn't get to see a doctor.
Side note: my dental coverage was cancelled at least once earlier last year because after several months on auto-debit, they randomly stopped debting. Money was there and available, they just...forgot? Decided not to process? They never figured out why but did fix it.
I spent nearly 3 hours today on the phone and I still have no doctor, no appointment, and apparently owe almost $400 because my dental insurance was cancelled days before for...reasons?
Step 18: resume this nightmare after work call, call provider given in call and get voicemail, leave message.
I have been on this call for over an hour just trying to find a doctor and find out why this wasn't paid. I don't have time to be transferred to another person, I have to call into court in a few minutes. Can't you help?		No.		This call is 1 hour, 13 minutes long.
Step 17: transferred to different department to discuss dental		Dental was denied for coverage out of network		No dental was not paid because you don't have insurance		Why was it cancelled?		No idea, I can transfer you to billing		Why can't you look it up?		Wrong department		😠
Step 16: hold for a really, really, really long time with lovely woman coming back periodically to say no luck. She eventually finds a provider that can take me with several options in less than 30 days...but she can't make the appointment so I have to make the call, gives info
Step 15: call insurer, get transferred so many times I lose track - finally get someone who can help with providers...but can't help with dental, we'll punt that, lovely woman calls through magic back line to providers to find out who is taking patients with appointments &lt;30 days
Discover that you have a dental bill for almost $400 that had coverage denied despite your premiums being autopaid for being "out of network" at a dentist you have seen for years, verified when getting dental insurance was covered, and was covered over the summer for cleaning
Step 13: try to find customer service phone number for insurer		Step 14: bonus round (this is like in mario brothers when you go down a tube and find 1 up mushrooms or something but it doesn't really impact game play other than you got big n'stuff)
This phone call was 17 minutes.		Step 11: go back to insurer website, find more doctors		Step 12: begin calling through, getting transferred, leaving messages places say to leave a message and they will call in a week if they can make an appointment, waste another 45 minutes
@Al_in_Maine I don't have a current PCP. That's the problem.
Oh, if you are in our system waiting for intake you can come in for a sick visit.		Can you just say I'm sick?		No.		Can you say I'm sick of not seeing a doctor?		No.		Kk. Well, peace out. There has to be something, somewhere better than end of April for intake for my $$$ premiums
It sounds like I can't get any preventative care until the next academic year and I can't even get intake until after taxes. I thought you said you were accepting new patients? I could immigrate to Canada and get care faster than this. What if I get sick before spring?
Soonest appointment for anyone is end of April for intake.		Is that the well visit?		No, that's intake so we can schedule well visit.		What if there is actually something wrong with me? I'm 42, we should talk about mammograms and paps and whatnot.		You need intake, in April.
..."my" doctor has no appointments for more than 90 days, would I like to try another. 😐		Fine, I have never met this doctor, are the other doctors covered? Oh, I should be online while I talk to you as we schedule so I can verify on insurance website they are covered. Cool.
About 30 minutes in at this point, juggling 2 kids, a lego building contest and healthcare.		Step 7: call number		Step 8: get transferred 		Step 9: get transferred again		Step 10: get a scheduling person on the line. Find out my "doctor" is a real doctor, but randomly assigned...
Step 6: go back to website, try to find actual number, realize that my children and husband are assigned to the wrong PCP...they have doctors, change that online, go to google, find number for "my" doctor
Step 3: quick google, she doesn't seem like a serial killer - feeds into Maine Med. Fine, fine; next step.		Step 4: call the number to make an appointment		Step 5: ring, ring, ring, ring - message that this number doesn't connect to anyone try again. 😐 		First sign of trouble
Step 2: navigate to the provider I have been assigned and get contact information.		I *love* the doctor I had for the births of my babies, but she's an OB/GYN, not a PCP. I need a new doctor.		I'm not picky, be qualified and not super annoying, we'll get on fine.
Step 1: go to insurance website		I had this provider last year for dental, so I have a log in already saving a few minutes *whew*
First, I called the cable company to cancel get rid of "risk free" service that came when I added a phone line to my internet. That took 3 transfers and about 31 minutes.		This was the appetizer to my main course: make a doctor's appointment.		It's been years, I need to go.
Hey #mepolitics,		For those of you who have never had #ACA insurance, let me share the experience with you.		Today was a snow day - try though I might - working was (mostly) not possible...I could throw my phone on hold and clear out personal things to free up time for work later

@Tony04219 @GiffordsMaine I have a love of cherry ice cream. Some of my best childhood memories of my dad involved cherry ice cream - simple, good, and uncomplicated.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 I'm ok with living in a world where I see what is along with what could be. 		I'm ok with you having a different world view.		Those things can co-exist. I don't need you to be wrong even if I think I'm right. It does not matter. Most disagreements don't need a declared winner.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 As long as I am your BEC, it will be impossible to have an objective conversation about who may be a smidge more in reality.		It's also moot. I truly don't care who is more right, which is why I generally leave you be unless you are up in my threads - even if I disagree with you.
I love snow days.		...I love snow days slightly less when they are following a snow delay day		...following a sick day		...following a 3 day week		...following another 3 day week		...following a 4 day week		I would really, really love to be working right now.		#momprobs https://t.co/qZFwt1i9lX
@GiffordsMaine This needs a poll
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 I disagree. We don't have to agree. It's ok for us to have different opinions.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 I have spent time in DC. Enjoy your morning Amy. I have kids to tackle.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 I think if the share of time spent fundraising were gone, and it was an expectation that congress understand law before they vote on it, that the quality of bills would go up, and the volume of crummy bills, needless pages would go down.		It would require systemic change.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 I have repeatedly said experts should be consulted, and appropriate staff should be involved.		That is not mutually exclusive with my point.
@_Ben_Franklin1 @ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 It's an incremental choice. Mitch is an obstruction only so long as he weilds power and lacks ethics, at least one of those will resolve at some point.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 I disagree.		It may be because I process information differently than you do. It may be because I think different things should be outsourced to staff. It may be because one or both of us is partially or fully wrong.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 Be open to the possibility we could have a different, better congress.		We could have a congress that is collaborative, that uses conflict to make better law instead of tragic consequences, and where money does not equal representation.		All we have to do is choose it.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 You seem to have a need for your perspective to always be right.		I don't have that same need. I can appreciate how things are and how things should be in my opinion, seeing how that fits with other views - which is why I am a functional attorney and mediator.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 You see the way it currently is as evidence you are right and I am delusional.		I see our deeply broken federal law, the escalating influence on $, and lacking proficiency in the core job area - that how it is does not match how it should be. That's my fact confirmation.
@ASFried @JillPiggott @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 We have fundamentally different values. I think law is not a task to outsource. You seem to think it's perfunctory and not a good use of a rep's time.		I think it's thoroughly unrealistic and unsustainable to fundraise to infinite $ amounts, the priority should be making law.
@timorousme Sometimes I wonder is Kate McKinnon is all of the actors and we just haven't figured it out yet
@JillPiggott @ASFried @taylorasen @RobCaldwell207 It's important to be able to disagree with grace. You gave us the opportunity to practice that skill Jill. Thank you. 		I also really appreciate you pointing out that bill. It's worth looking into.
@ASFried @taylorasen @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 Well, I do hear Susan has a race in 2020, who knows.
@taylorasen @ASFried @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 I haven't decided whether or not I will run for office again, or which office.
@neeratanden We yell about a lot of the same stuff @neeratanden. 		Disagreements aside, you should have a follow. 😉
@ASFried @taylorasen @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 We have very different ideals of what the job is. I think you absolutely cannot do the job properly without knowing what you are voting on, and there is sufficient time to do so if one isn't constantly fundraising.		It is a baseline expectation we should have.

@ASFried @taylorasen @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 You should do both? Why wouldn't you expect legislators to read what they vote on and get expert opinions. That's their job.
@taylorasen @ASFried @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 No, that if you know the contents of the bill well enough to know it's a rubbish bill, you don't need to keep reading. You already know you are a "no" vote. The only reason to keep reading would be if it was going to be a tight vote and you wanted to rally against.
@taylorasen @ASFried @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 If you already know the vote is not worth voting for, you don't need to waste the time.
@taylorasen @ASFried @JillPiggott @RobCaldwell207 Vote *for*, not all bills. How can one in good conscience vote for something they haven't read when that is their job? 		I'm gobsmacked that we don't demand this from our legislators.

@Al_in_Maine This is a difference between public and private spheres. For example, my bank account reports to me - our government budget collectively belongs to all of us. Those are totally different spaces.		I didn't think it was a fitting analogy when I was GOP either.

@disqus_sk_user This is true. We don't want any association with folks who have jumped the shark one way or the other.
@Al_in_Maine I actually prefer some conservative, some liberal, some moderates. I like a range of views.
@Al_in_Maine I know you don't agree Al, but there is a big world to the left of me....also a big world to the right, and a ton of issues that shouldn't have a party that folks are trying to assign to one.
@sallemann *Some Mainers. She still polls much better than would be expected.
@John_Felger You are looking at it from a different lens than I am. If you start with the assumption that her votes reflect her views and are on purpose, she is an amazingly effective conservative legislator that manages to draw fire away from her votes and those of others.
@ughnoname @2017Gamora A handful of moderates certainly could help make some progress. Some votes require buy-in from both major parties....even if it's just a few.
@AllanaHarkin Have a follow @AllanaHarkin. Happy to discuss Susan from a constituent point of view.		:)

@browntailedhawk I think Maine is incredibly transparent and that's exactly how it should be.		The GOP will probably come along to this party when they figure out it helps against incumbents since many of the incumbents have a D after their name.
@browntailedhawk It's a political question, not a constitutional one at this point.
@browntailedhawk My role in the suit helped ensure that voters who wanted to take such risks were protected. I think that now that freedom is protected in Maine you will see more voter, conservative to liberal, saying "ENOUGH" and pushing back on gross politics....and I think it will spread.
@browntailedhawk No. We already have a well-reasoned 30 page decision on the subject, plus the brief appellate finding. I think RCV is constitutional and here to stay. I hope this creates a broader pool of candidates and for voters to take risks on new, kinder, productive methods of campaigning.
@rbbellingham @B52Malmet That money is going to have problems.
@GlennGriffin8 @WalshFreedom Which is why he ahould be equally vocal here. I appreciate that he is pointing out the difference.
Joe and I don't agree on a lot, but we agree on this: if we can't apply the rules evenly we are governmenting wrong.		The solution to ethical peril is not to ignore it from your team, but to make standards clear and consistently applied. https://t.co/l1pQV2b99F
@AERatterree @ShawSuellen @catculley I'm not sure that will align with the criminal statutes.
@AERatterree @ShawSuellen @catculley Do you think groping without consent is not a form of assault?
@AERatterree @ShawSuellen @catculley I'm not sure how we are in disagreement. I think that anyone committing assault should have consequences, which may include jail.		Is your assertion that I think every man commits assault? Or that I think there are a range of consequences and the punishment should fit the crime?
@AERatterree @ShawSuellen @catculley Jail is not appropriate as a consequence for every single action. Criminal consequences are situational and come with a range of penalties up to an including jail.
@AERatterree @ShawSuellen @catculley I did not have enough information to form an opinion, but generally I believe people who grope absent consent should have consequences.
@AERatterree @catculley @ShawSuellen No. What a silly assertion. Not all men grope without consent.
@AERatterree @catculley @ShawSuellen Why do you think I think all men should be in jail? It's objectively untrue.
@AERatterree @catculley @ShawSuellen Do you think men should be permitted to grope women who do not want to be groped?
@AERatterree @catculley @ShawSuellen Where did I say that?		I've said I don't know any women that haven't experienced somewhere between sexual harassment and sexual assault. That doesn't mean all men act that way, nor does it mean all actions have legal consequences even if they impact the recipients of the action.
@AERatterree @catculley @ShawSuellen Are you saying every single man gropes women over objection?
@AERatterree @catculley @ShawSuellen Where did I say that?
Shucks, I think we ought be more party and gender equal when throwing about them there ethics vios. https://t.co/Coy9nuOyFt
@catculley @ShawSuellen I think a slightly more right-leaning independent would be a nice balance to Angus and reflect Maine well.

@101piper @AdamsFlaFan @SenSusanCollins She's not missing a spine. She's a conservative who has masqueraded as a moderate for a long time.		People simply forget because she plays a moderate well on TV and when people attack her for it they are cast as lunatic dems or folks from away meddling in our politics.
@thor_benson Wouldn't it be super if folks paid more attention to the voting group that often determines the outcome?
@101piper @AdamsFlaFan @SenSusanCollins No, she's pretty darned smart and politically savvy...she just gets away with a lot by acting folksy.

@Gundevarn @BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota I haven't even tried it. I'm so not impressed with my car's ability to listen as a general premise.
@Gundevarn @BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota The problem is the ages between totally confined infants and old enough to leave at home if they are annoying in the car.
@EveLittlepage Clearly, you need to play more croquet		Seriously though, I was raised with my cup full of older men preying on teenage girls to seem charming instead of skeevy, particularly since the girls were "mature"
@EveLittlepage I'm so sad there isn't actually a yellow house in the non-existent town in Maine.
@Gundevarn @BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota Wait...they get in trouble for designing cars with the flaws I point out or by listening to owner feedback?
@wardspeck I do not work in that area of law.
@EveLittlepage Best I can tell...		Unit of femininity = a °of willingness to perform unpaid unreciprocated labor historically delegated to women ^tolerance of bad sex (in minutes)
@Mainearmy Dude, I'm *not* in a party.		Both parties are not my jam. I like checks on the party in power, regardless of team. I was *extremely* critical of the last administration too.
@wardspeck Be careful getting carried away pulling in unrelated Bonds 😉
@Mainearmy I'm not in Congress. This specific congressperson seems to believe there is sufficient proof in the public domain...apparently in a similar fashion to how some folks believe there is evidence in the other.
"Femininity" has nothing to do with number of sexual partners.		Choose partners for their strength, compassion, and compatibility if you want a long-lasting and fulfilling relationship...if you'd like a nice bill from me, go with this femininity mumbo-jumbo. https://t.co/fkHE7HuYut
@Mainearmy That is the opposite of demands. Impeachment is similar to a trial, the other is don't pass go - go directly to jail. Not the same at all.
@BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota Where can I send my invoice for functional design tips?
@BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota There should be a pop down by the driver's seat for small, misc items. Cars should have a shallow junk drawer for all the rando accessories of momhood. 😂		Oh, and there needs to be a better lip on things so cell phones and hair clips don't go flying when jerks cut you off.
@BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota Why is there nowhere in this enormous beast to attach a trash bag?		Speaking of bags - why no good hook for backbacks so they don't end up trampled by muddy boots?		Why can't I turn on a good way to open the back from the inside?
@BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota *not window-specific		Why can the sunglasses holder not hold sunglasses for women in our 40s? Do you want us to wrinkle?		Why, WHHHHYYYY, can the car start if the key is anywhere near it? Who told you this was a good idea?		Your cupholder/outlet locations for middle row are bad.
@BlackMountainME @SamsungMobile @mitsucars @Toyota While I'm at it...		Why can I not turn off the back seat temperature control panel?		Why are the controls for the child safety locks where the children can flip them getting into the car?		Why is the feature to disable windows now window-specific?
@BlackMountainME This seems like a good place for a shout out to the speakerphone on my @SamsungMobile and the overhead technology in my husband's @mitsucars for enabling whole family laughable conversations.		Sadly, my @Toyota is an epic failure in the hands-free game...hire more moms.	#momprobs
@wrigginsmelaw I think we do trend (generally) civil in Maine. I find the bother comes in when a different standard is applied to women.		Always a pleasure Jennifer :)
@Mainearmy Even if I take your statement as 100% accurate, that still should not put a woman at greater exposure to criticism for language than men of similar or greater power.
@ASFried Go back and listen to the #mepolitics debates/forums with an objective ear. Tell me where you think I do not understand policy at least as well as everyone else present.		I realize that none of the others will engage with you on twitter, but I am not seeking their share of debate
@Mainedolfan30 @Seahawks Are they on? I didn't hear my husband yelling. 😂
@michaud1509 If I were guessing? I'd say upwards of 50% of men open to sexual activity.
@Mainedolfan30 @BlackMountainME That should have been in my campaign - even *my children* know which mills are actually open.

@CeadonDifortu @LindaPankewicz Though a challenge, a bad legislator can be knocked out at the end of each term. Term limits force out good legislators that otherwise would be faithfully serving.
@CeadonDifortu @LindaPankewicz Lots of reasons, Congress is currently based on seniority - so huge problems there.		We want the smartest and kindest folks, preferably not motivated by money, dead smack at the height of their careers - destroying their retirement prospects if this can't be a career.

@Treasure_MA It will be ludicrous https://t.co/YKS86qPUqV
@NorthsideDems Yes. And that they are stupid.
@NorthsideDems We had multiple votes on it
@kevlynhall @DHSgov That area has a physical barrier. I've literally been there.
@kevlynhall @DHSgov My big picture is Maine needs money for broadband, for our roads and bridges, for our schools - some of which are literally falling apart. We may not agree on big picture and priorities. It's ok if we don't agree on everything.		I hope the cold isn't being too hard on your knee.
@kevlynhall @DHSgov This is an inefficient, not actually possible as proposed, method to solve this problem.
@kevlynhall @DHSgov Criminals exist in every population. That is a different problem than immigration reform, asylum, etc. There are indeed physical barriers for big chunks of the border, the wall as I have seen proposed will be monumentally more expensive and not necessarily more effective for $.
@NorthsideDems I'm glad he tested the law. I do wish he had made more coherent legal arguments.
@kevlynhall @DHSgov Congress should be working on the causes (like actual immigration reform) instead of arguing over a wall.
@kevlynhall @DHSgov I was working all day and did not have time to watch. I have seen the rough plans of how much land would need to be grabbed with eminent domain, how many areas are just totally impractical for a wall, etc. I think it's wasteful, nothing I have seen has changed that yet.
@Gmanlaw #MaineRaising should be a thing forever and ever.
@NorthsideDems We were this year. Heck, I ended up in a federal lawsuit.
@Gmanlaw You aren't stupid. I'm not like other people who have run for office, it's part of my charm. I ran my 2018 campaign without campaign contributions for less than $800.		Like this...https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
@missc0nstrued @npratc Will listen this weekend. Thank you.
@Gmanlaw The emails or #MaineRaising?
@NorthsideDems You are really, really underestimating Susan and her ability to spin any national spotlight on an opponent to out of staters glorifying an attention seeker and meddling in our politics.
@missc0nstrued @npratc Ugh. That too. Was it a USDA loan?
@missc0nstrued @npratc I did not since I was buzzing between courtrooms all day, but that is not at all surprising. Any disruption of income can tank a sale. That makes me so very sad for this couple.
We are being distracted from fiscal prudence over a showdown for an engineering fail...and have shut down our government, depriving federal workers and contractors of pay over this.		We should demand leaders who tell us what we need to hear, not what they think we want to hear.
I'm happy to be clear I am opposed. The wall is impossible in proposed form and a ridiculous waste of resources that could be used on our infrastructure and provide rural broadband.		Border security? Of course. Wall? You're being sold an impossibility...or ficus.	#mepolitics https://t.co/VP92x7sC5o

@GlennGriffin8 @SenatorCollins @annieclark25 I know.
@Mainearmy I'm a moderate Keith, I have been for decades. I think both parties are a bit nutty.
@bostonborn66 Mainers for accountable leadership so far that I know of, but probably others. It's natural to send out a request when someone announces. Annoying, though expected.
@Mainearmy @Al_in_Maine Uh, I legit have views that are both R and D. If I wanted to be a R or a D, I would join a party. I don't. I value many of my GOP and Dem friends and colleagues points of view.
@Mainearmy I'm complaining about anyone taking money in politics. I'm sure Susan will take money from out of state, as will her opponent(s) most likely.		I'm a political freak of nature for not being willing to touch money. I know this. You know this too.
@GlennGriffin8 @SenatorCollins @annieclark25 Perfect. 😂
@DrChaya My distaste for money in politics has nothing to do with any particular candidate. I'm an equal opportunity hater of money in politics. 😉
@Mainearmy @Al_in_Maine I want people who will work with a political spectrum. Always have.
@Mainearmy For who?		I don't take any money for politics.
@Al_in_Maine I agree she is a very strong candidate. I still think we need some actual moderates in congress.
@sweetjulielynn Running for something is so, so much better for everyone.
I see the fundraising against Susan emails have started. Good times.		Why can't people do #MaineRaising instead?		#mepolitics
@dfa2066 Totally possible, but most likely to occur in the primary. The Republicans would be foolish to give up her seniority in the Senate.

@rufo_mark We, as a state, voted on it. I was pretty meh on it when it first went through, but it gives us great flexibility to take risks and try new things without taking away from either major party candidate.
@rufo_mark Our laws that we voted on say that. Like it or not RCV is the law so we might as well embrace it for the benefits.
@rufo_mark Don't be so quick to beat up on RCV, which was found in court to be constitutional. RCV gives us a new tool to challenge the things we don't like about politics.

I may have made different choices in a swing district, but we have EC voting not majority/plurality.

@mikefromdexter @BrucePoliquin You shouldn't trash people at all. Policy attacks are fine, but if your attack has no benefit you are wasting everyone's time.
@mikefromdexter @BrucePoliquin I know this is nuts, but I though we should talk about policy at the debates instead of hurl names.
@mikefromdexter @BrucePoliquin Not bad for &lt;$800
@Wreck_A_Center @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I freaking hate the hyper-partisan hell we are currently trapped in.
@Mainearmy Whether or not you like Liz, there are is a lot of glass in the GOP house to go petty with the rocks.
We have to hold our media accountable. So much of our reality is crafted by the most sensational thing.		Demand coverage of boring, qualified people being responsible and appropriate. Save the theatrical for the gossip column.		Reward what we want or we won't become that. https://t.co/SnrId9BdB0
Bad take.		Instead of painting other political philosophies as totalitarian regimes, may your 2019 be full of seeking points of collaboration and ways to improve your own views and those of others by using conflicting perspectives to find more effective and sustainable solutions. https://t.co/mbAJEUusGq
@MrJimOHare @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism We have two parties that have the power in a system that has more than 2 parties of views. In Maine, more than 1/3 of our voters don't want to be in either of the major parties. Do we have no rights to run and participate in our government?
@zhudigrandmoon @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism He doesn't run as one.
@zhudigrandmoon @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism It's not very democratic to exclude more than a third of voters from participation and to shame anyone that feels compelled to run or vote outside of the binary when many of us are shades of gray.
@zhudigrandmoon @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism It's ridiculous to blame a small share of voters with different political views when a large chunk of major party voters don't even bother to put their pants on to go vote.		The parties are not particularly welcoming to independents - are we entitled no representation?
@zhudigrandmoon @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism And I live in a state with Ranked Choice Voting. If independents are such a thorn, work on election reform.		Here we have more voters unenrolled in a political party than enrolled in either R or D...does the largest block of voters not have the right to run for office?
@rhiles2760 @tngsmama Sort of. Sometimes the due process is after the fact.
@dfa2066 Our goal is a modest home on a lake/pond...which is $$$ in CD1.
@shayne571 @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism Um, I'm an Independent. I didn't vote for Bernie or for any candidate in the primaries.
@shayne571 @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @neeratanden @darwinism Voter suppression is a huge issue in some areas.
@disqus_sk_user @imillhiser @MittRomney Such a disappointment. I thought he'd be a little more...LDS on those principles.
@imillhiser 2017-2018 @MittRomney made me very sad.
@eastcoastgirl40 We haven't even had the best part of winter yet.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism At this point could we possibly make politics worse?
These folks are doing it wrong.		You will be chafed, unemployed, and divorced if you embark on this trade off. https://t.co/oel0yTFVcr
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism (Not asking to be snarky, so that I can "replace" the need with something else)
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism What would I need staff for?
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I spent less than $800
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism What if we had people running for office that cared for their communities more than all the stuff we hate about politics? Almost every gross thing can be replaced with something less damaging or productive...lawn signs, ads, mailers, all of it has a viable replacement.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism The point is to have none of that. What if it's all crowdsourced? 		People respond very differently to help for a charity/small business than someone knocking on their door wanting something. Maine has a very low population. Our biggest city is around 67k people, most &lt;1k.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Say...200k people do it out of annoyance, because it's cool, whatever reason. How do you think that would impact the race?
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Indulge a hypothetical?		Say I'm running against someone like Susan Collins. Imagine if everyone in the country who is upset with her bought 1 thing from a Maine small businesses or gave $5 to a Maine charity with a note to check out her opponent.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Yes. Better than gross ads, right?
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I won't ever take you money though. I fundamentally believe those resources belong with those we wish to represent, and it is our responsibility to show our values through action...can I interest you in a #MaineRaising?
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Right, which is why I would be dead in the water in most primaries.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism There are folks asking me to run against Susan Collins 😂
@TonyAaronII @Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism We have a spectrum of beliefs and a political system that does not reflect that well.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Really though, most issues are not partisan. There is a political benefit to making them partisan and creating an us v them world. We should have more people in Congress that see law as collaborative, not competitive.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Depending on the year, I may have a more influential seat. A swing vote is one that can commnd greater change.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism ...where government intervention is required for equity to happen.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Depends on the issue. I am all about fiscal prudence in government, I prefer government to not be overly-invasive, and I like governance at the most local level that makes sense. Those are historic GOP values.		I also like social equity and believe there are indeed areas...
@MsIngaSpoke @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I ran for Congress this year. I'm open to the possibility of doing so again.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I can get a seat at the table, without towing a line.		Neither party here would accept me, I actually think the GOP would be more accepting of me here than the Dems, despite the issues frosting my cupcakes right now being a bit left-leaning. Maine has wonky parties.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I'm not a dick 😉
@MsIngaSpoke @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I do not have any plans to run for president, so I am free to live on my soap box for this issue on state level and below.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I planned to caucus with the majority party, and to push law in the most productive direction.
@TonyAaronII @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism We're all people, right?		I think it's a genuine kindness to disagree with folks with grace. I'm glad @neeratanden seems to share that value.		I try to respond to all or most all folks that respond to my tweets in a way that suggests response.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I was actually the only candidate who went to all 3 debates.
@Wharfrat2004 @TonyAaronII @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism From the outside, I think Bernie's fairweather party membership is kind of a dick move. I would not expect the local Dems to make their organization all about my priorities if I don't agree with them enough to be a party member.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism We are having an apples/oranges conversation.		I am concerned with the presidential election, but much more focused on Congress. On a state level, my perspective is more viable. I'm not currently wasting energy on the presidential election until I know who the candidates are.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I was able to participate in our televised debates and add to the conversation.
@NastiMarvasti @Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism This is appalling.
@TonyAaronII @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism Bernie Sanders is a big part of why I don't ever plan to run as a Dem. I don't think it's appropriate for a candidate to project their will on a political party that way.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism That's not true. There was a Democrat in that race this year. We also have several independents in our state legislature.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism But Independents can and do win in Maine, which should be easier now that we have RCV.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism I don't think my odds were nil. I broke over 5% of the vote in a federal election in my first attempt at a run. My presence also helped test a new election system in Court, and attracted many voters to the race who would have sat out.
@MsIngaSpoke @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I freely agree Maine works differently than other places.
@TonyAaronII @neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I don't think it's appropriate for an independent to run as a fair weather party candidate.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism In which race? All of Maine's federal races this year had at least one independent candidate.		Angus King won his seat without RCV by gaining the plurality, and won this year without needing RCV because he got over 50%.
@neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism Unlike folks who merely complain I ran for office in great part to not seeing proficiency in the checks on power.		Many have no desire to be a Democrat. It's probably more productive to your goals to collaborate with folks rather than assert they are (inaccurately) the problem.
@neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I literally told you I did not vote for Trump. I voted in a district that did not give its electoral votes to Trump.		Foreign interference is not at all the same thing as a bona fide independent candidate bringing different views to a race.
@Wharfrat2004 @neeratanden @thebestkiril @darwinism Not necessarily. I needed media coverage and faith in a new system of electing representives. I also started from zero.		There is definitely a benefit in parties, but it comes with a hook. I also ran my campaign very differently, spending less than $800.		https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
@neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism We have an independent Senator here, sometimes independent is what is needed.
@neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism These are issues I care so much about that I ran for Congress this year, and was the only person in my race consistently shining a spotlight on the rather egregious, ongoing human rights violations that were painfully absent in the other campaigns.
@neeratanden @Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @darwinism I think it's incredibly emotionally shallow to require people to fall into one of two political camps, and not a mutually exclusive value with fighting for vulnerable populations - which I do frequently as a part of my professional life. I most certainly did not vote for Trump.
@Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @neeratanden @darwinism You risk worse in future elections by telling independents their candidates can't or shouldn't run. Figure out why independent voters don't love the party candidate and/or drive turnout in your base.
@CodyPorterME There should be a process to remove weapons, with an opportunity for hearing (though it might need to come after weapon removal), and to return weapons if proven safe...but there should be an option to remove weapons from those who are dangerous for emergent reasons.
@Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @neeratanden @darwinism I am fortunate to live in a place with Ranked Choice Voting...but I still think Independent candidates (generally) aren't "spoilers", run better candidates and work in party-turnout if you don't want to worry about vote splintering.
This is sometimes necessary, for example in cases of domestic violence.		#mepolitics https://t.co/xTj2dmWGeY
@DirigoBlue Nipples, apparently
@Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @neeratanden @darwinism It's fine to disagree.		I feel running with two political parties is not sufficient to capture our range of political ideology. We have a substantial number of folks who do not identify with either party, and they should not be shamed or banished from running.
@Wharfrat2004 @thebestkiril @neeratanden @darwinism It's unproductive to blame people for different political ideology, when the real problem is voter turnout in one's own party.
This is something to celebrate. https://t.co/rJbVsmbVVX

@Al_in_Maine I never watched him pre-potted plants. Any clips I have seen since have been pretty pathetic attempts at offensive non-humor. Some shock humor can be funny, but I have not found his to be at all funny.

@lobstaman That's probably the face he'll make handing back the mic
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw Cell phones weren't really a thing back then. Plus I had somewhere to be and the police wouldn't have done anything.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw Yeah, once when I was threatened I called the police, and after waiting an hour they hadn't show up.		Women usually choose to remove themselves from the situation and move on. If every woman called the police on every man who was threatening to them, we'd need a lot more police.
I'm not sure why anyone would expect more from him.		Maybe don't give him a microphone? It'll just return sticky and the stagehands deserve better work conditions than that. https://t.co/gP3CRUI1ZD
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw I was refering to my experience of being told I would look nice in a trunk.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw What would the police do about it?		I can't get police to take action when there is a PFA in place and someone is forwarding mail, driving down someone's street daily, recording a woman in a courthouse, hang up dailing a new number, etc. Women are not taken seriously until harmed

@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw And once in the trunk you probably don't have possession of your phone anymore
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw No, a pleasant hello at the gas station is not what I am talking about 		The police seldom help in these situations because until someone actually puts you in a trunk it's generally not illegal to be creepy, leering, aggressively persistent, or vaguely threatening

@Al_in_Maine @jestrafton @RespectableLaw Cat calling can be in that category - though that's not a common behavior in Maine.		My point is it is nowhere near as rare as you think it is. I'm glad you have intervened, but it is more common to occur just out of earshot/line of sight of others.
@Al_in_Maine @jestrafton @RespectableLaw I'm talking about situations that can be offensive or annoying for a man, but dangerous for a woman.		I am *not* squeamish or easily offended...and I see these situations far more than I want to. The problem is we don't know when/if it will go south.
@Al_in_Maine @jestrafton @RespectableLaw What I'm telling you is a lot of the behaviors that men chalk up to "just being idiots" can be terrifying, dangerous, and deadly to women.		Something goofy or childish to you can be fatal to a woman, and sometimes it's mere luck of the draw whether or not it is.
@Al_in_Maine @jestrafton @RespectableLaw Women not being believed is why this stuff happens Al.		When I was younger I was approached probably 1 out of every 3 times I went to the gas station.		When I lived in a city where I took mass transit I was cat called, aggressively asked out, asked if "DTF" more days than not.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw I am in the Turner area pretty frequently. The last time someone approached me inappropriately was at a gas station outside of Turner on the way to Rumford.

@CanPanicNow @LadyLawyerDiary Don't do it.		I also ran for office this year as a practicing attorney and mom of 2.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw I don't think you have the life experience as a woman to understand what I am saying. I believe you want to understand,  but it is hard to fathom if you haven't experienced it.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw I get you think it isn't a problem Al.		You aren't a woman. It is generally less in my experience in Maine than other areas I have lived, but it's still there. Even if it's only once a year women have to be prepared in case *this* stop is *the* stop.
@CanPanicNow @LadyLawyerDiary I had 2 summers after 1L year since I slid a MBA in. First summer a term in Paris, second I did an internship in Maine and loved it so much I couldn't go back.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw ...and addicts scare me less than sober creeps. A sober creep - that's someone who can plan.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw Oddly, I don't think I've ever been approached by a creep in Portland or Lewiston. Usually it's middle of nowhere or right off the freeway, both of which are somewhat terrifying places to disappear if something happens.

@MatthewEdwardA2 @MarkHolbrookME Too many hypotheticals - we don't know who would have stayed in the race or how folks would have voted under different rules.
I went on a variety of podcasts, Mark. I considered it part of campaigning to discuss my views with a range of audiences.		Did you go on any? Did you listen to me on any of the podcasts? https://t.co/ivmPSxUUsr
So, of course, I blew off all campaign $, told people to support the community, and read bills to twitter so I could throw myself under the bus for a guy I don't know.		Totes logical, right?
Obviously a more believable plot than I am a pissed off mom and lawyer who thinks there is too much money and not enough skills in politics, and that my views were not represented.
This is my favorite bit - that I plotted to support Golden, a man who I hadn't heard of before he entered the race, and about whom I was not subtle would not have been my pick of the Dems...all the while accepting quite a bit of abuse from people for not supportting Jared enough. https://t.co/OTQX9U3q5l
@JacquelynGill Really depends on the big name and the field. I grew my account to run for office...so the abuse is just sort of assumed.		Maybe if we weren't such jerks in the job interview we'd get better candidates? 😂
@MatthewEdwardA2 @MarkHolbrookME I don't know that Bruce would have won under the prior system. He wasn't very good at making federal law or being responsive to constituents.
@ASFried There is no shortage of trolls in #mepolitics
I had many Republicans vote for me, and I deeply respect that choice.		It's very hard to recognize that the parties aren't working for you and try something new, even if the risk was minimized.		It was very hard for me to see many GOP not be who I thought they were.		#mepolitics https://t.co/d5Vf5YTWMo
If dissenters vote 3 times, then EVERYONE gets to vote 3 times. It means there were 3 rounds of votes, with 2 held as instant run-off.		#mepolitics https://t.co/kRL7avwz5o
@audreyameilia *Grew up Republican. There is a reason I am not in any political party, several in fact.
I'm not a Democrat.		I think the parties are kind of nuts to be honest. Too much money, not enough focus on constituents or the law...which is a message I lived through my campaign - can I interest you in a #MaineRaising?		#mepolitics https://t.co/SLuNK2M8Q7
This is also demonstrably untrue.		I grew up Republican and am all about fiscal prudence...I've never, ever been a Democrat. I think there are good and bad in both parties.		My #2s voted for Bruce, Jared, and neither. They had to earn those votes on their merit.		#mepolitics https://t.co/SkeqeGXfKA
Mark, honey, I didn't run against Mills...and Mills was in a race where RCV did not apply.		#mepolitics https://t.co/VpjQsEPBJO
RT @Terra_Cide: This was a beautiful finishing move.		Please, please, please run against Collins in 2020.		#mepolitics https://t.co/A8AgbTK…
Mark, it was literally mathematically impossible for you to win.		Chellie got over 50% of the vote.		There was no RCV applied in your race.		#mepolitics https://t.co/AvFA7RTH7N
@MarkHolbrookME @SteveCollinsSJ That's...not true. If RCV kicks in, AND a candidate, independent or otherwise, is removed for being the person with the least votes, the voter has a vote cast for their next available choice, which can be D, R, I, none of you people, etc		My #2s went D, R, and none.		#mepolitics
It's literally one vote per round of voting *if* RCV kicks in, you may cast your vote for the same candidate in more than one round, but only one candidate per round.		Chellie got over 50% in the first round so there were no further rounds in your race.		#mepolitics https://t.co/SXUmv2pHVO
@Dwhite_Denim The pepto apparently looks like dinosaur blood so it has to stay up high. I long ago gave up on rationalizing their creative play.
I would have won if we magically changed the rules to affirmative voting...but Chellie got over 50% of the vote so RCV didn't even kick in?		Should I send my kids over to explain how it works?		#mepolitics https://t.co/jD3JtQwacH
@wardspeck Going off debate performances, Mark doesn't seem super tech savvy.

@SBfut3 @frodofied @golden4congress @Governor_LePage Lepage is termed out and his uhaul is headed to Florida.
@frodofied I so appreciate your support...will you still ❤ me for being bad at parties and rolling independent? Us folks in Maine are weird like that. We have ranked choice voting so it makes those who aren't good at parties harmless if we are unsuccessful.

@Dirigo1820 @taylorasen It's pretty awesome I have probably at least 100 volunteers in the wings if I go for it again. That's been some of the best of it - so many really wonderful folks wanting to do good and make change.		I truly loved the cynicism cracking just a touch.
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman License to legislate?
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman I grow on people. 😉
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman I considered bringing a squirt gun to the second debate. I even put out to the universe that the Alyssa Milano cutout from SNL would be kindly accepted.
@Dirigo1820 @taylorasen You are much appreciated.
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman I actually do think the government has an interest in marriage, because it's required for divorce...but that interest should be religion, color, and sex neutral. We impose our own beliefs on what our own marriage should be.		Government interest is property, capacity, etc.
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman I'm fairly close to what libertarian *should* be on healthcare choices. From terminations to cancer care, ER treatment to bunions, I think the government has no business in those decisions...but then a bunch of libertarians got all weird about women's healthcare.
@AmyTambone @disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman ...I am so boring and scandal-free that #MaineRaising, #Readthebill,  and the #RCV lawsuit yielded virtually zero press coverage.		You'd think at least *one* of those would have gotten me on a national tv show. I'm really tragic at attention-seeking behavior.
@AmyTambone @disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman I have folks on either side that find me to be both.
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman I'm pretty fiscally prudent/efficient, and generally socially liberal/permissive when it comes to law.
@AmyTambone @disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman I agree it was inappropriate...I even tweeted about it. 😂
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman Moderates/independents have to be gauged individually. I realize may be a bit of a bother, but we should get to know our candidates, right?		Heck, the dem that ran in the CD2 race was gun-toting, resistance-eschewing, and Nancy Pelosi vote-againsting...party platform not helpful.
@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone A tremendous amount of law is state-level. I ran for federal level because I like federal law and that's where I thought the big problem was.
@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone I did not vote for Paul or Susan....Susan is federal and far more conservative than she credits herself for, I have no words to describe Paul.
@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone I think Maine has a much more vocal independent contingent. We elect Independents (see: Angus King, etc). I don't see politics as black and white, it's a spectrum. I don't use the term centrist, because I'm not centrist on all issues - sometimes I sound hard left or hard right.
@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone What is going on at the federal level does not reflect our local level issues with the parties (or those of us that are sans party). When we make American issues the issues of one party, we stop being able to make progress on those issues.
@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone I don't see things like climate change or women's rights as D values. I see them as non-partisan American values. I also make a point of separating the federal level choices from the state and below. On a local level I know many wonderful GOP and Dem that are compassionate folks.

@windbourne_grr It's the experience of being a woman. If you protect yourself, you are neurotic. If you fail to protect yourself, it really isn't an attacker's fault, it's your dress/stupidity/meekness/etc.
@windbourne_grr It's a spectrum and always, ALWAYS in the background when you are a woman. I'm not feeble or squeamish. I've already has multiple people tell me I have mental health issues for being concerned with personal safety this year because I described how I hold keys going to the car.
@disqus_sk_user I kind of abhor money in politics. Did you see #MaineRaising?		https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman Susan is a pretty consistent conservative vote.
@tpgb33 @bibi_207 @ManInTheHoody Sorry I'm not your jam. That's ok. We can still be friends.
@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone Many people are neither a Democrat or a Republican. We have more people in Maine that are neither than either D or R.
@disqus_sk_user @AmyTambone @davidmweissman The wall is a waste of resources. That money should be used for our failing infrastructure and expansion of rural broadband if we're on a building kick.
@bibi_207 @ManInTheHoody I know the energy is there. I know it can be harnessed in a way that is genuinely good and helpful to Maine. I know there are literally millions of people who agree with my overall political stances who would support if we connected...but I'm dull and not awesome at traction.
@taylorasen I'm not sure. I'd like to think I will be up in CD2 by then, but I took a pretty big hit in billable hours this run and it may impact my ability to get financing. We'll see.		There are 3 positions that anyone in Maine could run for.
@taylorasen Quite a few people in DM and in person. I don't generally discuss private conversations. It's over 50 but fewer than 100 that have asked so far. I don't plan to pull a Bruce and make up thousands of imaginary conversations.
@bibi_207 @ManInTheHoody I understand campaigns are not twitter....but if the goal is to drive resources to Maine with #MaineRaising, twitter is a functional platform for that specific activity.
@bibi_207 @ManInTheHoody I've had a lot of requests for that. Susan has nearly 500k followers, endless tv opportunities, and easy access to above the fold coverage.		I have &lt;10k followers.		That's a lot of #MaineRaising. Do you have 490k followers and a few friends who are producers on national shows?

@colleenhenness4 I have to go to Philly periodically. I get an uncomfortable encounter on average once on those trips, usually in New Jersey. 😂
@colleenhenness4 Sometimes it's just creepy leering. Sometimes it's charming and harmless chatter of someone who clearly doesn't recognize we have different boundaries. Sometimes it's worse.
@colleenhenness4 Not super regular....although my time in Maine started while pregnant, so I may be a not very exciting target. I'm on the road a lot in Maine. I get approached a few times per year.		It happened more when I was younger, cuter, and probably looked a little more vulnerable.
@Al_in_Maine @RespectableLaw I have been approached at a gas station in Maine, more than once
@JustBirdTweetin Tree falling in the woods, right?		The constant mistreatment of women is so common I have to pause and blink sometimes to notice it...it just all blurs together.
I think my favorite gas station comment I was maybe 19(?). Some skeevy guy told me I'd look real nice in his trunk.		Worse than the pump is the dark walk to the gas station bathroom on a road trip. 2/10 don't recommend.
@quigley_suzie I might be slightly too forthright.
Oh, honey. You aren't paying attention.		I am a middle-aged mom, "meh" to look at these days. From the time I was driving at 16 until now, I consistently have been approached at the gas station. It's a lot less now (thank goodness), but it still happens.	cc: @RespectableLaw https://t.co/CLXlNkGM0Y

(at least I ask for help on things outside of my expertise, right?)
I've had many folks ask if I'll run for Congress again.		I'm not sure - if I do, I'll need to be working on followers while I mull running.

@disqus_sk_user @davidmweissman @AmyTambone That's not even remotely what I said.
Husband just had me explain to our 5 year old what a lawsuit is.		I'm not entirely sure this was a wise choice. I was just threatened with a lawsuit for not handing over his stocking candy.

@MatHelman @Martina Transplanting someone into our lovely state will not make for an electable candidate here.
@dfa2066 That and her PR tour are a big part of why I think she is running.
@dfa2066 I do not think Bruce can win a statewide election.
@dfa2066 You think Bruce will run for her seat?
@enutt @Martina Hope is kind of a dick.		Getting Susan out before she wants to go is going to take massive, well-	orchestrated resources that don't push too hard, overreact, or feel like they are from away. Maine reacts to anyone outside of Maine in our politics like Seattle does to Cali...x10.

@ChesterfieldTag I think she has voted for several bills that undermine the ACA. I didn't pick out specific clauses.
@Claritybear @CityofBangorME I would have never pegged you at 39.
@ChesterfieldTag She also votes to undermine those things while "supporting" them. I prefer those who don't make me feel like a satyr with a drinking pal's breath.		I'll take my liberals liberal, my conservatives conservative, and my moderates moderate.

@hozerracing @BrettKavanaugh That was late in her performance art. She's been at this for a loooooooong time.
@Bdonohoe1 I'm not ruling it out...I'm also committed to not torturing everyone with perma-campaigning. Any official declaration, should there be one, is months off at best. We all need a breather, right?		That said, follow along, do #MaineRaising, tell friends to join 😉
@YesMeredithFinn @Martina I don't think money is her driver. She hasn't met media coverage she doesn't love. Money is unfulfilling if your value is driven by power and media coverage.
@YesMeredithFinn @Martina She's still really concerned with photo ops. I was pretty sure she wouldn't run 6 months ago, I'm definitely not certain now. She also has no heir apparent.
@Martina The harder outside forces push on Susan, the more of these articles there are, the more difficult it's going to be to knock her out of her seat. Maine is *intensely* resistant to outside influence. It's more of a threat to hear local opposition get a wider support base.
@Martina She's going to have quite a few contenders from the left...maybe some from the center. It's a much higher hurdle than those outside of Maine realize. We have pretty loud Democrats that I think (hope?) are done with her - and she doesn't need a single one to win.
@Martina And @Martina, I am a very vocal critic and constituent - we have similar goals here. It's that the "she's done" proclamations actually help her. Anyone from away taking bold stances against her will boost her, not tear her down. Maine has a quirky political landscape.
@harrywilliamsjr @Martina Possible, and I thought that pre-Kavanaugh...but she's not acting like she's retiring. I think she likes attention and power more than money, those are in short supply in lobbying.
@Martina It's not hypocrisy, it's how she spins. ...she's also going to be very, very hard to get out of office before she wants to get out of office. She is very effective at manipulating the media in Maine.
@ChuckWendig This sounds very hipster.
@DrDebraJKenned2 @tngsmama She's not my favorite person, but I definitely wouldn't roll with "anyone but Collins"....I would take her in a heartbeat over some others, despite her multitude of failings.
@shanaban52 @SenatorCollins Here is a better thread on Susan.		https://t.co/nzgw1Eu0xm
She is very politically savvy and shockingly underestimated on a regular basis.		Her aww-shuckness and concern is her political style, not reflecting her actual smarts - it's how smart she wants to be credited as.		Look for authenticity, it's the skill missing in that seat.
You aren't going to convince her that her compass is broken - she votes exactly how she wants to vote.		Anything you see where it looks like she was snowed over, she wasn't.		Anytime she extracts a "promise", that dog and pony was to spin for you..she already got what she wanted.
You really don't understand Susan. 		Susan is a conservative who wears a moderate suit, but consistently votes conservative. She's clever and manipulative.		Instead of getting upset every time she does *exactly* the same thing, maybe support voices in Maine that don't do that... https://t.co/yu5x8tkkmN

PS - Bruce, 		You are a grown man, don't purposefully mislabel a voting process to be petty. My 5 year old knows better, so do you.		#mepolitics
It is a disservice to us all to attempt to undermine voters and our systems.		It's one thing to say you might have won with different rules...another entirely to declare cheating, unfairness, and flip off the rule of law because the current rules don't deliver a win.	#mepolitics
Better take:		It is unpleasant to lose, an election and in court, but the court has spoken and this is our voter-approved, constitutionally tested voting method. Exit the race gracefully and use the benefits of #RCV next round.		#mepolitics
This is a ridiculous statement.		If you truly believe the system unconstitutional and unfair, you continue the appeal process.		The Court issued a 30 page order declaring #RCV constitutional. Honor the court's order with a statement that reflects findings.		#mepolitics https://t.co/aHeXrU9Jhf

@Target @BJsWholesale @NutellaUSA Pro tip 2...no nuts? You can use rice crispies 😂		Allergies? This is the wrong cake for you, nutella has nuts. You can omit nutella from the ganache and add a little extra butter. :)		#momprobs
@Target @BJsWholesale @NutellaUSA No worries. It can be fixed!		Take a deep breath, go to sleep, wake up the next day, scrape off the extra ganache on the plate, reheat on low, run a butter knife around with a thick coat, chop some nuts, pat them on - voila!		Pro tip...run a knife between wax/cake before removal. https://t.co/v551tMgQaV

@ShagspearesGoat @Target @Walmart You know, I have never made a purchase at Walmart.
@Target @BJsWholesale @NutellaUSA Want to make ganache?		2 c chocolate 	.5 c butter	.3 c nutella 	2 tbs sour cream	4 tbs milk		Combine over low heat until smooth. Listen to a couple of 80s tunes while it cools a touch. Pour over cake.		Let cool for a bit. 		#momprobs https://t.co/hT2DzIlDvP
@Target @BJsWholesale @NutellaUSA Best sandwich ever, right?		Use the nutella to make a somewhat even surface, trapping the cherry inside and giving the ganache a nice surface.		I'm pretty sure this violates all fancy baking rules.		#momprobs https://t.co/S1aP9O30LN
@Target @BJsWholesale @NutellaUSA The cherry filling is done when you can dip a spoon, turn it upside down, and it doesn't drip.		First dig a hole an inch-ish in and about .5 inches deep, then fill with cherry.		Bust out the nutella and prepare to use it as yummy glue.		#momprobs https://t.co/Z1jLDuHnE4
@Target @BJsWholesale @NutellaUSA You *should* wait longer than I have, but patience is not my virtue today.		Tuck wax paper under the edges of the cake.		Use a bread knife to get a flat surface in one cut...and yourself a snack.		#momprobs https://t.co/cJrkW7Wf99

@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ So no examples of actual jobs then?		I don't think politics should be a 2 pony race. My world view isn't binary like that. It's totally possible I will run against Jared. I haven't decided if or what my future political involvement will hold.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ I did not support Jared. I actually lost a few friends over my refusal to do so.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ What jobs did Bruce bring?		Did I endorse Jared? Did I deliver a single glowing praise of his platform?
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ If either one of them were better candidates, it wouldn't have gone to RCV.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ I have no control over the actions of Bruce or Jared.		I can control my actions, and my actions earned votes at less than $.05 per vote. I would call that a successful test of a campaign method that was developed during the process.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ Oh, and I had never met any of the Dem candidates, nor did I have any idea who Jared was when I came up with #MaineRaising. I wasn't very subtle that I actually preferred another Dem in the primary to prevail. I have never been affiliated with the Dems and I grew up GOP.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ If I run again I would use the same model, against D or R.		The model was manipulating out the influence of money, not a particular party. I don't know how much more clearly I can say it. It will make more sense if you stop thinking I'm a Dem; I'm not a Dem - I'm just pissed off.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ It happened to favor not Bruce in this election (why would I run if I wanted to help the incumbent, that's silly).		It's not partisan, nor were my points about the election. If a Dem had been incumbent, I would have been making the same points - too much $, bad policy "x"...
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ Here is the quote you are referencing. It literally does not say that.

@Silverbear515 How do you pick for your kids between housing and healthcare? You have to have one, you should have the other.		Particularly in Maine, many of our small businesses are heavily seasonal and an enormous amount of folks are self-employed. It's a formula for disaster.
@Silverbear515 There is little sympathy for the middle class, but the ACA is a deeply flawed system. We need to be working on it. There is a massive, glaring hole for the middle class who do not have healthcare through an employer.		The rates put folks between mortgages and premiums.
@Silverbear515 I'm fairly certain I am currently uninsured, but haven't opened the letter that came in the mail yesterday that likely says that.		When you trivialize how stressful, upsetting, and defeating healthcare access is for the middle class self-employed, you lose allies.
@Silverbear515 Visit scheduled, I had to keep changing them and wasn't able to go because I kept getting requests for more documents, documents that didn't exist, etc and I could not afford a full price visit plus my premiums. I still have not been to the doctor.
@Silverbear515 Last year we got a small subsidy 🎉...except no 🎉. I expected a change in income because of changes to tax code. So even though I explained the income change, I had to submit paperwork over, and over, and over again with hours on the phone. Despite having several doctor's...
@Silverbear515 He can go to a clinic with no insurance for around $150. Every visit for our children was extra too. We basically only had to spend $23k+ before we got any coverage.		We spend a couple of months that year uninsured because I just couldn't pick between that and my student loans.
@Silverbear515 2 years ago I was paying around $900/mo, but my coverage was basically catastrophic. If you went for a "well visit" and talked about anything other than being well, you received an enormous bill...we got one for my husband's "physical", which should have been free - $1071.
@Silverbear515 I haven't been to a doctor for over 5 years. It's all bad for me. Failing to make progress on middle class, self-employed insurance creates tension that hurts the system.		Premiums in Maine for a family of 4 start at more than my mortgage and cover nothing.
@Silverbear515 The ACA helps a lot of people...it also hurts a lot of people.
@Jonnyrocket70 @RuPaulLePage Throw Yemen on the WTF pile while we are at it.
@Jonnyrocket70 Like pathologically underfunded schools and neglected roads, this is a long-term, party-agnostic, chronic malady.
@RuPaulLePage At a minimum we should elect people proficient in functionally caring about that in our stead.
@RuPaulLePage Even those who have barren fields of caring for military adventurism should at least be a smidge miffed at the price tag of these jaunts.
@mattsko That was me last year.
I signed up for insurance tonight through the exchange.		I'm going to go cry over my budget now. Self employment is less fun in December.

@mkees1 It could also make it much easier to lose the majority spot if you need the support of one or more groups outside your own.
Judge Walker agrees #RCV is constitutional.		16,552 folks put me as their #1 choice.		Those who voted for me were not:	- Confused	- Unintelligent	- Disenfranchised		If you didn't get their #2, you didn't earn it.		Give Is equal coverage; competition improves races.		#mepolitics
@mkees1 We already have a variety of caucuses. I wouldn't be surprised to see those take a bigger role.
@mkees1 I think we're going to see that evolve and change over time.
@dissentingj Non party moderates think a lot of folks are nuts.
@mkees1 I don't hear the purity thing much. I hear more that people don't feel listened to or connected, that the parties aren't moderate, that they are more concerned with party warfare than the job, etc.		I probably attract a different set of information though.
@mkees1 I think anyone who does the crap in that article really isn't a functional candidate.		We need to get to a space where everyone runs on their merit, skill, and perspective...of course, we'll probably have a lot more independents in office if we get there. 😉
@mkees1 RCV has really grown on me. But here's the thing, instead of being upset at different political positions, the party candidates should ask what is missing to have them run.		It is an enormous undertaking to run. I wouldn't have bothered if I thought the skills needed were there.
@MikeSealander I might actually have hit "repel sunlight" white. If I start sparkling, I will know I have gotten pulled into a needlessly dramatic teen vampire series.
@mkees1 Sexual violence, guns, climate change, legitimate fiscal prudence, etc.		I ended up shocked a few times to be told I was making the men look bad by having opinions on legitimate, important issues that impact us all.
@mkees1 I can't tell you how many times this year I was called petty, vindictive, vain, etc for disagreeing with both major candidates. Frankly a lot of the stances sucked. I sincerely didn't agree with the others. I couldn't imagine a race where everyone was all but silent on...
@mkees1 Calling them "spoilers" in any setting gets you exactly the opposite of desired results.		Many roll independent because we think ideas are off and we aren't listened to...so telling that group they owe you their vote and they are ruining it makes them want to vote that way more.
@Maine_Pundit I wish I could like Paul as much as you do...but I find him thoroughly ineffective and disturbingly short-sighted in policy.		I do *want* to like our leaders, for any party. I want them to be competent, caring, dedicated people. I simply find a shortage in supply for my demands.
Cool.		Can we quit calling independents "spoilers" now. We are legitimate candidates with a different political perspective. With ranked choice voting, if your party candidate doesn't get our #2, they didn't earn it.		Be open to the possibility you might like something different. https://t.co/w30K5rmLCj

@MS71541719 @GlennGriffin8 @GOP @BrucePoliquin @NRA I was pretty meh on RCV until I ran as a candidate with it. If we are trying to attract better qualified indys, I think it's a huge perk.

@ardwen2 My comparative value is Bruce Poliquin. I set my expectations low.
This bill doesn't seem harmful, but it really doesn't seem to do much of anything at all other than to give financial institutions more work, training, and liability without much help to vulnerable folks.		Seems like fluffing feathers to brag rather than real work.		#Readthebill
@GlennGriffin8 Not in this bill.
@JillPiggott @SenatorCollins I don't think this bill really protects anyone.
This seems like a state AG thing, or a CFPB thing, or a thing that would be a thing if this had any teeth, tracking, functional reporting.		I guess thanks for the meh bill since you didn't have child separation, fiscal prudence, or other senate-y things to do?		#Readthebill
And though they have to keep track of people who *could* report, they don't seem to have a requirement for tracking reporting or otherwise gathering data to track large scale fraud.

@brianscalifgirl The "algorithm" is just math. Everyone who participates in the election has the opportunity to vote for the top 2, just like a run off.		More folks chose to vote for candidates in the first round, and opted out of voting for the run-off (not voting for party candidates).
@brianscalifgirl The amount of people who didn't want to vote for anyone at all first round was down from 2014...folks were slightly less interested in the party candidates.

@pollyle Are you talking about the voters who opted out of ranking both Bruce and Jared?
@pollyle @droskill @Lbstrdvr6 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Did you see #MaineRaising? #Readthebill? What did you think?
@pollyle @droskill @Lbstrdvr6 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews That's a legitimate stance, but does not make the votes fraudulent, invalid, etc. I think it's perfectly reasonable to disagree on voting systems, which is why we vote to see which one we want to use.
@pollyle @droskill @Lbstrdvr6 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews So if you voted for someone who did not make it to a run-off election would you be forbidden from voting in that second election?
@pollyle @droskill @Lbstrdvr6 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's the exact same voters from the first election (which may actually decrease fraud), you just essentially have the election without coming back to vote again. You've told the state who you would vote for if your top pick (s) are not on the run off ballot.
@pollyle @droskill @Lbstrdvr6 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Right, just like if you came back to pick between the top 2 in a run off...without wasting a trip.
@pollyle @droskill @Lbstrdvr6 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Votes are only "recast" if everyone "loses" (fails to surpass 50%). Then everyone gets to express their opinion in subsequent rounds...even if it's for the same candidate.

@Lbstrdvr6 @droskill @pollyle @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews How do you functionally hack math and paper ballots? The results are easy to reproduce and backed up by paper.
@Lbstrdvr6 @droskill @pollyle @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Only 1 out of 3 races triggered RCV. This is equivalent to the run-off.
@Maine_Pundit I don't really prefer either of them. I wouldn't have run if I did.		#mepolitics
@Maine_Pundit I don't see much distinction between words with the ability to take action but not doing so, and no words.		When Bruce writes a bill that serves as a check on power, or when he shows up in a pink pussy hat and has a protest sign I might agree with you.		#mepolitics
@Maine_Pundit @RepPoliquin @golden4congress @BrucePoliquin @funder I cannot explain Golden. I can have the opinion that neither one of them seems excited about being any sort of functional baseline congressional check. I don't see much distinction between words with the ability to take action but not doing so, and no words.		#mepolitics
@Maine_Pundit @RepPoliquin @golden4congress @BrucePoliquin @funder No, they can write a bill in the house and loudly, repeatedly apply pressure to vote, recruiting other reps to their cause.		#mepolitics
@Maine_Pundit @RepPoliquin @golden4congress @BrucePoliquin @funder I thought there was more than one bill looming. Which is Bruce a co-sponsor on? Has he demanded it come up for vote?		I'm not stumping for either of these men. I think neither will be particularly predisposed to being a check in government.		#mepolitics
@Maine_Pundit @RepPoliquin @golden4congress @BrucePoliquin @funder I remember, but he also did not write a bill on it to the best of my knowledge. Words on twitter are easier than words in bills. 		#mepolitics
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews That's absolutely something that can be brought to ballot if voters wish.		As someone who isn't super warm and fuzzy with either party, I like that there is a possibility to give independents a better shot.
@Maine_Pundit @RepPoliquin @golden4congress @BrucePoliquin @funder He's been in office while the investigation has been ongoing...did he write a bill?		#mepolitics
@brennan_meinke @trumpharmsusall @GOP That's exactly it - this isn't partisan.		It could easily help either party or non-party candidates.
@Jamesmiltonray @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews This isn't the same problem as voting machines. We have paper ballots and the "algorithm" is literally just a tally. The results are transparent and easy to replicate.
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's the second time it's been used. I was sort of "meh" on it when the first couple of votes happened.		Running as a candidate, I really liked it. It allowed different conversations than a 2 party death match where everyone on one side would hate me if I split the vote.
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews That small group of swing voters would have determined the outcome anyway, as they usually do in any close election.
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Everyone in ME02 did get the same amount of votes, the votes were applied in multiple rounds. For example, if you voted for Bruce or Jared #1, since they were the candidates with the most votes, you "voted" for them twice - once in each round.
@ArkLaTexBubbe @goodgr8vy @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews No. To win the goal was to get 50% + 1 vote...the desired impacts are getting a most palatable elected official and encouraging those running to show how they appeal to the other candidate's voters because they might need the #2 votes to hit a win.
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews ...came back and voted again in a run off.
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews That is exactly what happened other than needing to go back.		We cast our votes in order of preference. If someone didn't get 50% they would essentially run the results with the last place candidate knocked out and those he was knocked out for got their #2 counted as if they...
@ArkLaTexBubbe @goodgr8vy @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews So I was free to run a race based on being dedicated to reading bills, focusing on communicating policy, skipping traditional advertising, and instead focusing resources back on our communities with #MaineRaising. 		Cool, right?		https://t.co/mOv7XfVNo8
@ArkLaTexBubbe @goodgr8vy @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Hit enter too soon. Having ranked choice voting let me run a different kind of race without worrying about either side yelling I was a spoiler. As mad as Poliquin is that he lost...he got many of my #2 votes. Anyone who wanted to vote for him got to if and when I was knocked out.
@ArkLaTexBubbe @goodgr8vy @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews We just started it, but yes.
@EarlGibbs2 @CarrieJadud @SteveCollinsSJ Earl I freely and fully admit I wanted to change the race. I wanted to change the race to find a way to run without to corrosive influence of money, which I did...and if I run again, I will absolutely do it with #MaineRaising.
@ddell101 It's not just this paper. It's the vast majority of articles. It's like living in a screwed up Hitchcock movie about being erased.
@theMnucher @BrendaS38751793 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews I love that so many took a leap of faith and tried something new. ❤ 		It was so lovely to make politics not about the money, the gross, the insults, and to really help people.
@thisdog Thank you
@ArtVuilleumier @FuMikechu @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews I was born in oregon. I haven't lived there since I was around 2.
@AdamBach11 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews If you need pi for basic addition, I suggest coconut cream.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ Earl go reread the quote. That's not what I said.
@EarlGibbs2 @SteveCollinsSJ Your assertion isn't even possible. I entered the race when there were around 11 men running and had no idea who Golden was...and that literally is not what I said. I have always held out I was testing a new model of running a campaign, and I did.
@jaymcb74 @rudolphdee1 @wahoo53975320 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews You don't even need to know the formula. I could literally write it from scratch in a few minutes from the rules and I'm not an excel guru.
@Lbstrdvr6 @jaymcb74 @droskill @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's really easy. You order your preferences. They eliminate the person with the fewest votes until one person gets 50%. In 2 out of 3 of our races there was a 1st round winner.
@MaineLife4Me Both are tragic insomnias.
@ClubSimtopia @mitchellvii @pyrrhophytes @BreitbartNews I'm not a dem.
@pollyle @WindyWalling @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Each is counted once per round.
@pollyle @VernBannister @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Each "round" is basically its own election. If the first race doesn't produce a winner, there is an on the spot run off.
@pollyle @Lbstrdvr6 @droskill @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews They essentially hold a run off election on the spot. Lots of places have run offs.
@4_djt @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews RCV isn't partisan.
@IAmSaliba @mitchellvii @karenre83431645 @BreitbartNews It's in court. It's a lot of silly arguments, but it's in court.
@mfmvb1636 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's not cheating. We voted for it, more than once.
@rudolphdee1 @wahoo53975320 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews We voted to do it differently. We decided we want someone who 50%+ find palatable.		It's...basic math. You can literally replicate the results in excel in a few minutes.
Itchy insomnia might be the most annoying of insomnias.
@diazomusic @ManInTheHoody It's important to periodically have conversations that give you pause. It's one of the best defenses against hyper-partisan politics.
That's not true.		No one met the 50% threshold in the first vote, so the state applied the rules as stated on the ballot, creating an instant run off. The GOP is trying to change the rules of the election after he lost with those rules.		I know. I was on the ballot. https://t.co/xNv978vaiq
@rudolphdee1 @cubsfan038 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews The lawsuit is insane. The GOP is asking the court to change the rules printed on the ballot after everyone voted. If you don't like the law, lobby to change the law...don't play monopoly and when you lose try to declare you were playing risk.
@waldo_aaron I think it's unfair to RCV to paint it as some sort of liberal plot. It's party-neutral and actually gives non-party candidates a more fair shake.
@Kreemerz @TheChrisMoreno @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews In this race? The democrat won, but the GOP was objectively bad at federal law. I say that as someone who was in the race and participated in 2 debates with him.
@ronaboe5 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It also increases competition, which both parties need.
Oh, honey. No.		Better caption: GOP loses, wants to change rules that were printed on the ballot after the vote so he wins.		#mepolitics https://t.co/ssxmmAukwF
@terriro76620666 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Ranked choice voting is just instant run off. Not a big deal.
@bbban_anna @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's a good way to increase competition for both parties.
@Sherry09 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews @GOP @LindseyGrahamSC @senatemajldr @POTUS @GOPLeader @senjudiciary It's just an instant run off.
@BradleyZimmerm6 @mitchellvii @ish10040 @BreitbartNews This isn't a dem thing.
@Marie1773056 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's in court. This is voter-approved, more than once.
@CindyMAdams1 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews As an Independent, I wanted more competition for both parties.
@tigergal7175 @mitchellvii @mrshobbs58 @BreitbartNews It's basic math. You can replicate the results in a few minutes in excel.
@lisakalynkeele @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's in court...but the system isn't sketchy and was voted for multiple times by voters.
@2AforeverDusty @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's actually pretty easy. We like it.		And the 4 weeks of recounting is because the incumbent is a bit of a sore loser.
@hydin @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews This is actually sort of the opposite of deep state. It helps those who aren't a major party get a fair shake.
@UColt454 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Our government fought it. Voters wanted it.
@TrewSkye @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It encourages competition, which both parties need.
@tripping_trip @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's wicked easy and increases competition.
@Mholmz1521 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Lots of people in district 2 voted for this, many not in the cities. It's a really good way to encourage competition...which both parties need.		Didn't you like #MaineRaising just a little? Wasn't it more fun than commercials?
@EBitt24 @mitchellvii @JeanneLoberg @BreitbartNews It's actually really great and encourages competition.
@ArkLaTexBubbe @goodgr8vy @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews We have a quirk in our state constitution that impacts applying this in state level races. We've voted for this multiple times. It's not a party thing...it's actually more of an independent thing. This method encourages competition, which both parties really need.
@RJSMarketing @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews @realDonaldTrump As someone who watched millions pour into this race from both parties, it was gross. This method of voting puts pressure on the parties to be better or get out of the way.
@gus3056086685 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews How does that apply to RCV?
@Repdog60 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews The independents are done with all of it.
@deegrose @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Not at all. We wanted a different system.
@TheChrisMoreno @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews Not. Fraud.
@crumsschnauzers @mitchellvii @KatrinaPierson @BreitbartNews This is not fraud.
@karmaworks64 @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews The GOP is, but it's a ludicrous argument. This isn't a partisan voting system.
@averitt_don @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews It's just basic math. You can replicate the results in excel in a few minutes.		I'm not on the left. I want both major parties to step up their game or get out of the way.
@DonnaLedford8 @tcsweetpea @mitchellvii @BreitbartNews This doesn't favor either party.
