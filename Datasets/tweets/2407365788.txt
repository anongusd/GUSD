Great offensive first half by #Pitt. Defense needs to stop over helping on the drive, leaving too many guys open from deep. Overall, very solid half

They made the moves to be successful, now they must play to win. No more getting guys in or getting guys work. Keep the scrubs on the bench unless of extreme circumstances
Must play best lineup every night. Right now, Freese should be in more than Moran, Cervelli at 1st, Diaz catching, Frazier at 2nd, Dickerson, Marte, Polanco in OF.
Must use some form of your 5 big guns in the pen on all nights, other 2 options can’t be trusted.
#Pirates cannot continue to split or lose series. Rest of the season, with exception of a couple series’s, is against teams either there chasing or  teams were tied with. Now is the time to make the push
Didn’t realize how bad Russ Martin has become. Batting under .200 and the Jays are stuck w him
Fully expect, or at least hope, #Pirates add another reliever in August. Any time pen is needed early, can’t trust Neverauskaus or McRae, or any reliever who isn’t Rodriguez, Santana, Kela, Crick, Felipe
Why the fuck did Alex McRae just bat in the 6th of a game we’re losing?

B1G ACC Challenge game Thursday between Notre Dame and Michigan St will be a great game. Both teams fundamentally sound offensively and defensively. Deciding factor will be whether or not State turns the ball over as much as it did vs UNC in PK80 Final #CBB
@kwilli1046 I don’t disagree with ya,but Fox will keep him for the same reason they keep Liberal hack Shep Smith. The reason being they’ll stay true to their slogan of fair and balanced news. They don’t want to become like Breitbart, even though most of Fox supporters wish they did
