@LynnOtto9 @psychdr100 Not only those who grew up in MW. I grew up in CA and am very familiar with firearms. And let’s not forget all the Vietnam vets who came back protesting the war. The difference is we don’t wave our guns around as compensation....
@theawfulstink @chrislhayes Not to worry. Just mouthing off. They know that it would end bad for them.
@chrislhayes Isn’t that sedition? Where is the law enforcement? Such hypocrites. What do you think would happen if a person of color said that.
@nprpolitics @vprnet When he joins the Democratic Party I will consider. Until then he is a spoiler.
@RepBera He didn’t declare a National Emergency to implement it.
@Sen_JoeManchin I understand that. But the repercussions through out their society are a cost more than just to the miner. We already subsidize coal production. Why not subsidize retraining and relocation for work which I and many members of family have done for work.
@Amy_Siskind So Republican. I have witnessed this about Republicans for decades.
@ZerlinaMaxwell I think you might be missing something. Don’t you think that trying to see the person as something other than color identification a good thing?
@NathanLerner Prepare to answer how you would deal with the underdeveloped worlds pollution. You aren’t going to change anyone’s mind on that show. But nice try.
@Sen_JoeManchin Why don’t you stop mining coal so they don’t get black lung? It is hard for me to believe you keep pushing coal when you know how dangerous it is. Unconscionable.
@BrianKarem Right now private capital controls the vast amount of the means of production. Insufficient regulation has allowed the obscene accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few.
@business Don’t forget the flash boys and high frequency trading. Now there is a”gold mine “worthy of mining for revenue.
@116deerfield @NormOrnstein @senatemajldr There is no judge or any law enforcement agency that can charge this guy with a crime? He is directly responsible for pain and suffering and possibly death and there is no one that can stop him? Wow
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP If an action causes harm or death is not that person open to prosecution even though that person is the majority leader of the senate? Could not some federal judge make that call?
@SaysHummingbird Isn’t becoming obvious that the senate is broken and down right corrupted when one person can shutdown our government with no legal recourse! This guy needs to held criminally accountable for the damage he is doing to peoples lives. So much for all those legal scholars.
@jeffcimmino What nonsense you are spewing. And really irresponsible. Shame on you.
@TrumpHChrist @SenatorDurbin The best idea I’ve heard yet. If there is anybody in Congress who needs his ass kicked it is McConnell. To hell with the senate decorum. How on earth did this scum bag get so much power?
#NewProfilePic https://t.co/BwoDf4rOgx
@SenSanders So misleading. Sounds good though. Just more fodder for the wealthy to dismiss the basic fact of wealth inequality and Sanders. How about a comparison of the wealth controlled and who it is.
@safeandjust Maybe you should look at how much crime there was and how many were convicted. Prisons were overcrowded. False comparison. Would you like a half way house in your neighborhood?
@AnnaBanana59 @hardball @MalcolmNance This question needs to be answered. How is this legitimate business of the USA.
RT @RepBrownley: Americans spoke loud &amp; clear that they want Trump &amp; GOP to end assault on nation’s health care system. Trump Admin has ref…
@Gladwell @NewYorker So now if kids want some weed they just hang outside dispensaries and wait for a stoner to buy up for them. Not good.
@AOC Our government is probably the most complex in the world. How much do you really know about how it works? Look what happens when amateurs try to run it. Keep fighting but fight with the Speaker not against her.
RT @chrislhayes: Berman on HR 1 is a good read https://t.co/gYw3K6kTDK
@kylegriffin1 Kyle. I really do feel for you. But you voted for your self interest in stead of the country. So get your head out of your ass and think about someone besides your self.
@PaulBlu @HaileyWheelgun If it doesn’t to you it should. Read some history fella. And not the revisionist crap taught in a lot of southern schools.
@SecNielsen @DHSgov Sounds like you just can’t get the job done. So you go after kids. Nice
@SethAbramson @mimipeacemama The rage coming from media pundits about orangeheads tweets. Boycott him. It is becoming painfully obvious you all are a huge part of the problem in perpetuating lies.
@MsMollyRachael The head of Sea Shepherd said it will help the whales. No more fishing in Antarctica.
@HaileyWheelgun from another well armed liberal
@Virgini42002239 @Hankmayo1 @ShopFloorNAM There are also a lot of people getting government assistance that are working but barely making it. Crazy system where if you make too much you lose benefits.
@woodlandsdem @JammerKatzen @BillKristol Just enforcing the tax laws would send a message.
@JammerKatzen @BillKristol Not to mention deregulation which crippled unions.
@Ironhorse76 She can still listen to Limburger. Break her radio. Fox was taken over by coastal elites.
@secularcitizen2 You need to treat your pain. What ever it takes. You are a danger to your patients until you control it. Or fix the problem. Opioids work and have been for centuries. Heaven forbid that your life might be better!
@SenKamalaHarris When California did early release of prisoners our community, a suburb of Sacramento, experienced a spike in property crime. Many blamed this on early release. How are going to address this?
@RepSwalwell @realDonaldTrump Let’s hope that you get his tax returns. Go big on making changes to tax code to make it more fair. Dark Money exposed incredible abuse. Using the conclusions from that book would be a great start.
@NewsHour I would add sexual identity. Mind your own damn business. And stop throwing it into the faces of those that don’t have the same tolerance you do.
@matthewjdowd @EVargasTV I would have more sympathy for pro lifers if they would commit to supporting every child that goes to term and the women who might want to keep that child. Of course that is not there objective. Just another power trip by evangelicals and could I say the Catholic Church.
@Kriegshund @TheAtlantic What does that even mean? American values like the Bill of Rights and the Constitution? Both of which the Republicans have demeaned and attempted to subvert. So get your head screwed on right and stop the vacuous labeling.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump Same ol schtjk. Break it then claim you fixed it. I wonder how much protection there is for unions? I thought so.
@htn1967 I would like to believe he had an epiphany. I’ll believe him when he and his father pay their back fees and apologize nationally for his and his brother and fathers actions.
@SenKamalaHarris What are some examples of detrimental policies? I just read that up to $7B would be available to individual states. Is one that allows rice farmers to sell their almost free water allocation to water brokers for a profit?
@SenKamalaHarris I’m assuming that it includes resources for thinning. There are so many areas that were seeded after fires that are so crowded you can’t walk through it.
@novablue18 @EdKrassen It would cost you $200K
@ChuckGrassley Grassley is a serial liar. Has been for years. He just makes stuff up and hope it sticks just like his coconspirator
@SenSanders No argument there. How about specifics. Like national service or plant closure laws or national high speed internet
@JoyceWhiteVance Hi words get spoken louder than his actions. Boycott orange head
@h8Wankmaggot45 A major reason was third party voting in Pa Wi Mi. Still doesn’t let the majority of republicans off the hook who vote R no matter what. This the R rot and own the orange head
@h8Wankmaggot45 Ignoring the commons is a hallmark of republicans who care more about tax breaks and their selfish concerns
@RepSwalwell It is telling that so few came to your defense. Why?Useless arguing with zealots stoked by propaganda from the NRA. Buy back doesn’t =confiscate. should you be able to buy machine guns or stinger missiles? Get real and try to figure out how to stop the slaughter of our children.
@Atip4 @BillKristol Or all of his campaign rallies
@JerryBrownGov @GavinNewsom @POTUS You should explain why you did not mobilize the national guard to help on these large fires? If not something like this when? Inexplicable to me that you did not treat this like a war against fire.
@Pr3tzelogic @BillKristol There you have it. Just look at the voting in the Sacramento area. Republican turnout was almost as high as Democrats even higher in some rural areas. They are still voting straight party ticket in federal state local
@bradleystark @BillKristol An opinion bought?
@WhiteHouse Because they don’t have any now. They have either been indicted, are under investigation or quit. And the ones left can’t get a date! Pretty hard up or wacko to apply
@amyewalter Amy.I live in the Sacramento area and came from the Bay Area. I have voted in every election since 1966 and have never waited more than 10 minutes.I’m outraged when I see the lines.reduced voting places was a tactic of voter suppression.Should be high on Democrats list of fixes.
@davidaxelrod Right on. Except that is kind of dumb Axelrod. Commenting on his lunacy has become a virus among the punditry.
@Lawrence Time to stop pushing this crap Lawrence!
@hardball @HardballChris All they have is hate and fabricated crises. No solutions to what most people care about. I mean are you really worried about destitute families from Honduras? What a joke. Boycott Trump!
@maddow It is no wonder they want to keep under the radar. They are fomenting insurrection. The link to Mormons should be especially concerning. The framers of the constitution knew what they were doing when they separated church and state. This is what you get.
@Geoff_Leo @LynKY1950 @DMansini @ramblingrosek @JRubinBlogger @CNN @MSNBC @washingtonpost @NewYorkTimesGHS @FoxNews What exactly would they be reporting?
@JRubinBlogger I never watch those “briefings “. I’m so embarrassed to see how demeaning it must be to take it because it’s my job. How to explain to your children?
@JMoster4 @ABC Too many press jobs at stake. So they sit there and take it. It is way past time for Washington Press Corp to walk out,en mass.
@jimrutenberg Whats working is exposing you and your colleagues as spineless and beholden to some false duty of journalistic objectivity. Must be tough to realize you have become part of the right wing propaganda machine.
@jimrutenberg Your column today reeks of appeasement. Obligated to report on all of orange heads tweets? You and your colleagues have been and will continue to be played. Anyone with half a brain saw that from the campaign on,NYT some of the worst. Way past time to boycott him.
@peterbakernyt @jimrutenberg @stefsaul Let’s get all sides Baker! Way to go. Feed the right wing propaganda machine. Maybe we need to look into who has been paying you?
@chucktodd You are part of the problem. Boycott him. All of you. Oh thats right. What could you possibly report on but him. Idiot
@MMFlint On the precipice! Scare mongering does what exactly? Too many checks and balances for the doomsday scenario you push.
@tcufrog86 @NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer Typical. Republicans blaming Democrats for what they do.
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @SenSchumer His statements are seditious. Why are Democrats so afraid of calling it like it is.
@alsolikelife @sundanceorg Way to go Kevin!
@DeniseShearin @JoeNBC There you have it Denise. Well said. Cancelled The NY Times...Again!
@JoeNBC So now you notice the sedition! Time to call it out for what it is and has been since this guy began his campaign.
@KarinfromMars @Acosta Sorry. They need to stop showing up. Now that would be a message.
@htn1967 @parscale @GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump Your montage says it all. The real mob.
@JudyWoodruff you have responsibility to challenge trumps lies when you show his news conferences. You are abrogating your journalistic ethics.
@sheelahk thank you Sheelah for outing Donald D. Smith and Sinclair. You have given us valuable information to put a spotlight on what these creeps are up to. Sedition!
RT @maggieNYT: This isn’t an ad for a fringe candidate. It’s for an incumbent member of Congress. https://t.co/cBluJnVSWI
Doesn’t anybody else wonder how it is that the orange head can use taxpayers $ for all of those campaign events? Apparently the media has no problem since I’ve not read any concerns. Oh! They get to travel too!
@11tulips @StevenBeschloss Amen.
@htn1967 @GOP @realDonaldTrump @LaraLeaTrump Love this response.
@chrisconte Good for her! Entertainers apparently have a lot of influence in society so cool it with the inane comments about staying in their lane.
@chrislhayes I am continually amazed at how obsessed you are with trump. Time to cut the cord.
@Franklin_Graham You seem to conveniently forget the separation of church and state. Or do you not believe in the constitution?
@tomfriedman This is one of the most irresponsible column you have ever written. You sir live in a bubble. Or maybe I do given that I live in California. The backlash I and my relatives have experienced to trump makes a lie to your theory.
@NewsHour @Georgetown You were rudely interrupted by the moderator. You need an apology. Very unprofessional.
@AriBerman @JoyAnnReid Hypocrisy is the Republicans middle name. Guaranteed.
@MariaNate @ABC @TerryMoran Marie. You are an idiot. The same technique that Republicans always use when in fact they are the culprits.
@chrislhayes Amen. They would not have been able to restrain themselves questioning Ford. And they would have looked like the bullies and misogynistic white guys they are. Quite a performance by Graham.
@RepSwalwell Think sedition Congressman. Raging against established legal authorities! Trying to discredit FBI and intelligence community!
@BryanDisagrees @chrislhayes There are many union companies that are doing just fine. I’m really disappointed in Jeff Bezos. That he would condone this is a blot on his image. Maybe it is time for a boycott. To portray unions this way is insulting.

@SenateDems @SenSchumer You are such wimps. McConnell broke all the rules. You need to do the same. You would be surprised at the support. How about caning McConnell
@ddale8 I watched him and he was definitely not joking. Got his comeuppance on world stage
@JoeNBC Really. Just read that interest payments on debt is greater than defense budget. And Fed is making it even worse by hiking interest rate. Defense and debt. Who benefits from this?
@RealNativeTaino @bellport_phys @nytmike @maggieNYT Thank you. NYT blew it.
@SteveSchmidtSES Trump is engaging in seditious behavior. Sedition. Look up the law against it and it’s history.
Sedition. Look it up. Trump is engaging in seditious behavior.
It is time to think about sedition. The attempts by orange head and his enablers to discredit established lawful authorities meets part of the crime of sedition.
@jonallendc So you finally get Republicans.
@KamalaHarris I can’t help but wonder if we are being set up for delegitimization of the midterm elections? Call me a cynic. Republican dirty tricks.
@chucktodd If there ever was a conspiracy it is within the Republican Party and it’s dark money enablers. Keep hammering on this. Americans really hate being manipulated by rich folks.
@JoeNBC You need to step up scrutiny of McConnell. There is the cancer. Border line sedition.
The orange head is a joke. More scrutiny needed of cabinet and republicans in congress. They are the real danger.
@paulkrugman you need to explain/debunk what orange head said about tariffs in easily understood language. Ripping us off?
@chrislhayes I’m appalled you are just figuring this out
@chuckschumer take the gloves off! No quarter on anything. Use every tool you have to block everything the Republicans  do. You will have more support than you know.
@SenFranken Please don’t resign until after an investigation. I don’t believe any harassment, assault etc. are right, but please wait until the ethics committee renders a decision.
@SenFranken Don’t do it Senator. Your position is to important as well as your fighting against the Republicans. Don’t!!
@SenWarren @maddow @CFPB You need to go to Consumer website and try to make a complaint. Really poor. Very difficult to use.
@paulkrugman Add congenital hypocrisy
@davidfrum Term limits not the answer. Eliminate gerrymandering. Add crash course for congress in the constitution
@chrislhayes When are you going to realize you are complicit in giving credibility to misinformation. Stop
@ThomasKlineMD DEA scapegoating drs because they can’t stop herioin from getting in this country
@hari you need to concentrate on where the heroin is coming from.not the use of legimate painkillers.
@chrislhayes Chris it is time for u and other commentators to ignore trumps tweets. You are only feeding the beast. Are you really that dependent?
Many died unnecessarily because of this. Where were you Kissinger? https://t.co/JWJNmGuYsz
@maddow dems need to explain the Ukraine emails if true. Can't let fox wackos control story
@chrislhayes @BillStone67 Chris you are on the right track. Ignoring Trump is the answer. Nothing he says is worthy of reporting
@maddow why  did Trump not get arrested by the IRS for accounting fraud
@chrislhayes I wonder if the Democratic Party will ask for a refund of $spent on his campaign?How about donors.
Wndr who at Boy Scouts invited trump?did they knw it was a campaign speech?why is no 1 willing to confrnt this guy when he goes off the rail
@maddow Find out how Peter Smith died. Demand an autopsy!
Charge of voter fraud is an excuse for voter suppression.
@maddow You @your colleagues need to boycott Trump @ his tweets and press conferences.Thats the https://t.co/rSVmDpvR7z are complicit in his attacks
@maddow why does wydan have to release a hold to get documents?
@InfoSecAdrian @stlouisishome @TitansMum @AmericaUSA2020 @mitchellreports I wonder if the infrastructure required to support us in the NATO countries count as debt repayment
