Please consider how revolutionary Jesus Christ's message in the Sermon on the Mount was in its time, denying the political and religious traditions by preaching love, forgiveness and maturity. 		Then consider how revolutionary that message is today, even to many Christians.
Are you favor of being unscrupulous? https://t.co/zCkW7iXlf9
I agree. PRETENDING to be offended by something with the excuse "well they did it first!!!" is so immature a response that I'm  sorta baffled I need to explain it in detail. 		I'm too intellectual sometimes.		It's wrong. https://t.co/somSqBKC6F
As am I. 		Doing what you critisize your enemies of doing IS hypocrisy. https://t.co/rpViCfPKUZ
You don't seem to get that the Democrats would totally agree with you.		All they need to do to go along with what you've saying is to throw a fellow Democrat under the bus for wearing KKK garb and then outlaw #MAGA caps. 		You didn't see that coming? Think this through. https://t.co/T8aiXedbeZ

Making the enemy live up to it's own book of rules means calling out hypocrisy.		It means the next time this kind of thing is used on a Republican, you say (as I will) "When this game was played on a Democrat, I said it was a stupid game and I say it now." https://t.co/11LHTicg2j
