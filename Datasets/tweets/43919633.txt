Will remember the personal stories more then anything else on @realDonaldTrump -1st state of union...his agenda is clear areas of division obvious - but speech is upbeat, concise and w/ top notch delivery!! @foxandfriends
@SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump speech  is outstanding...moves through issues , breaks news w/ Gitmo, cites Iran govt as evil and people as brave, speech long  but moves— heroes spread throughout ..humanizes every issue @foxandfriends
Clear that @realDonaldTrump is noticing who is sitting and who is standing one every issue..smart to start speech by saluting heroes @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump composed, well paced, scripted but still Trumpesque...why don’t dems cheer for FDA approvals, and energy independence? @foxandfriends
