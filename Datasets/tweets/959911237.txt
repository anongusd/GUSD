@IlhanMN You are a true inspiration to us all.
@Ilhan Do not resign, Trump @realDonaldTrump said the most hateful thing about Muslims,  Muslim Ban. Do not give in. He is trying to bully you.
@RavMABAY @Ilhan @IlhanMN Seriously how about the Israeli government apologize to all Muslims for the mistreatment and killing of Palestinians. @IlhanMN you dont have to apologize.i am Muslim but I condemn the Saudi govt for their horrible acts of killing.
@Ilhan Do not apologize.
@SpeakerPelosi I am so disgusted by your demand for an apology. With ppl like you leading the Democratic party we will sorely have Trump for another 4 years. Stop fighting w/I your own party.
@SpeakerPelosi No this is not a statement about being against Jewish individuals,  her stance is on the Israeli GOVT. Which tends to do their own thing. Being against a govt is not racist against a person or their religion.
@kaitlancollins @KellyannePolls Why doesnt this administration use the same theory???
