@LarrySharpe @CBSNewYork Should read we are doing our part to ensure 3rd or 4th party candidates are not making progress or headway. Cuomo vs Molinaro neither can sway votes from the other so its a pointless political show

@marcmolinaro Does anyone even remember a campaign that was based on the candidates principles and what they would do to fix things, rather than a constant barrage of stating the obvious problem

@FreedomWorks @pye Which criminal justice system are we reforming? Federal where there is no need if the government would do the job its authorized to do or State where the gov has no authorization to be involved?
@marcmolinaro And chuck and hillary change their stance on tons of issues daily. That moron Cuomo is simply repeating the Democrats song of the day. Its not an original statement. Why feed into it and give him credibility? Howabout telling us what the plan is for the state
@marcmolinaro Wouldn't people like to hear real answers on how he plans to fix the problems in the state? Is constantly reaffirming what everyone already knows, that Cuomo is an idiot and the state is falling apart, a campaign strategy?

@TinaBaumgartne6 @RepJeffDenham @CongressRTBot Do you believe the bs narrative that all the blame lies with the ins companies? Ur not watching how the healthcare monopolies that the gov and lobbyists created are the real cause. I see many ins co's hiring their own providers and giving better care
@TinaBaumgartne6 @RepJeffDenham @CongressRTBot I'd like to see those figures for Medicare. Do you own a car? Is your house insured? Do you think you"d have a chance in hell of affording ins if the gov controlled it? Why are the only medical procedures that are affordable are ones not cover by ins?

@rights_state Replied earlier to @justinamash i agree except for the undeclared war part. Declared is undefined, you can't go by past practice since most actions have been undeclared SO isn't congress funding a military action a DECLARATION?
@rights_state The swamp continues because people think "i voted" my job is done
@RepLeeZeldin @CongressRTBot Just keep driving the narrative, revive it every time it dies out. Personally if these over paid undereducated jackasses want to protest some one tenth of some one hundredth of a % while close to 1800 people have killed each other in Chicago, have at it

Bankrupting the Country. The one thing both sides ALWAYS come together on

@PattyMurray @CongressRTBot Senator why not tell the people how the executive branch has no authority on tariffs and that authority lies solely with congress? Then explain how congress passed a law to delegate that authority even though they have no authority to delegate it.
@BorgmanWinnie @justinamash Wow, support the constitution and what this country was built on much. The pres has no constitutional authority on tariffs
@Manning4USCong Hope your going to DC to work with the few real representatives and not play in the boys club
@amyklobuchar @CongressRTBot I don't know, according to what chuck said at one point, it's his judicial records that matter. They are and have available. I have my concerns w kavanaugh but none of u criminals will do your real job its all political theater
@KyleKashuv @Ocasio2018 Never underestimate your ENEMIES 	When the people find they can vote themselves money, that will herald the end of the republic."	-- Benjamin Franklin
@SenBillNelson @CongressRTBot Whats a bigger threat ad's by the Russians  or a former pres assuring noncitizens they won't get deported when they vote?
@SenMarkey @CongressRTBot I have my concerns about the guy but none of you career criminals are going to do ur real job at the hearings. Its all a bs show. Get a new narrative
@WalshFreedom Technically they have no right. They are on their employer's dime. The government is not shutting them down so their rights are not violated. With that said if the @potus keeps pushing for suspension it will become a constitutional issue
@SenSchumer @CongressRTBot Chuck, chuck, chuck its my understanding that all his judicial records, that you used to claim were the important thing. Are and have always been available. Don't people get tired of these criminals thinking ur a fool
@RepGregoryMeeks @CongressRTBot @Acosta Can we define news please
@GunOwners Start fighting the REAL FIGHT. Allowing the continued attack on the CONSTITUTION will lead to the fall of this whole Nation
@realDonaldTrump W/O taking a stand on tariffs either way. The Pres. Can not legally authorize tariffs. Don't give me U.S code the Pres has NO authorization &amp; Congress has no authorization to delegate that authority. Its all a pass the buck shell game wake up
@SenJeffMerkley Oh stop the sky is falling bs and do your job as your supposed to. And stop playing on fools with the roe v wade crap. With The current make up of the court activists it can't be overturned. Maybe if you stuck to the constitution you be shitting ur self
@Jim_Jordan @jack I have no doubt they do all the things people are saying BUT where is congress authorized to be dragging private companies into hearings? If you support the constitution only when it fits your agenda, you might be a progressive, marxists, liberal
@DRSwink @SteveKingIA @CongressRTBot He obviously knows nothing of the law, but that wasn't the point. If congress would do their job and no brained assholes wouldn't support politicians with an agenda we wouldn't have to worry about what side wins or looses. BS judges will change their tune

@MrDanLarkin @osiris123d @SenJeffMerkley @Lady_MeuMeu @GOP Point is they do not serve for life. They serve during good behavior. No where does it say serve for life. They are NOT untouchable. The problems lie in the corrupt pieces of shit people keep voting in on both sides.
@MrDanLarkin @osiris123d @SenJeffMerkley @Lady_MeuMeu @GOP I've read it and read it and still can't find where it says that.
@RepBrianMast @CongressRTBot @evergfoundation How exactly is this a federal issue? Where exactly is the federal government authorized to be involved?
@marcmolinaro So this bs bereavement law that they just passed. Still think the Republicans are working for the people? https://t.co/rpU5ib58rx
@osiris123d @SenJeffMerkley @Lady_MeuMeu @GOP Hmmm, confirmed for Life, is that a direct quote or the result of falling for more political bs?
@JUSTINtheZEBRA @RepLoudermilk Regulated? How so and why? The federal government has no authority to regulate it in any way shape or form. Although they will eventually claim as interstate commerce thats bs also
@RepLoudermilk Would you care to explain why alcohol prohibition took a constitutional Amendment and why now the criminals in DC believe they have the authority to regulate what ever they wish?
@RandPaul Senator not long ago there was a lot of talk about infrastructure rebuilding. The power grid should be the main priority in infrastructure

@SteveKingIA @CongressRTBot Its also pathetic that congress, the ONLY ones authorized to fix the problem, choose to do nothing so they can keep their bs narrative going. The people are important only as pawns
@SteveKingIA @CongressRTBot The executive branch is under no duty to follow unconstitutional court opinions. 		Congress needs to grow a set and start doing there job. Start by removing judges with high appeal rates.
@PeteGClark @marcmolinaro @NYNOW_PBS @LarrySharpe The molinaro challenge 		Produce bills he voted on while in the assembly that he voted against his party because it did not serve the people
@PeteGClark @marcmolinaro @NYNOW_PBS @LarrySharpe I don't get it. State of federal the Republicans haven't stood for the people in ages and the last couple years its accelerated. Yet so many are convinced (yet again) this time it'll be different
@babraham1988 @RealCandaceO Where is the lawful		PEACEFUL ASSEMBLY?
@babraham1988 @RealCandaceO I would say yes. Realistcly it doesn't matter if its one person or 100. We can all be pretty sure if it was 1 person doing the same thing and we called the police something would happen. All to often its lack of knowledge. Thats not a first amendment issue
@KrisAnneHall the U.S. Senate appears to have a general twitter account. Imagine 20k tweets concentrated on one account ref the same subject and it only takes 2 min
@KrisAnneHall 20k followers. May i suggest 20k tweets to potus that the exec branch is under no obligation to follow unconstitutional "mandates" of the court ref:DACA		Also 20k messages to the senate and house to investigate &amp; remove judges with high appeals
@babraham1988 @RealCandaceO I'm sure the same applies in all states, its not peaceful demonstration when you are illegally obstructing the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic. Also working a crowd up to incite a riot would come into question. As would disorderly conduct
@RealCandaceO 	The truth behind the false narrative check out her radio show and liberty first university https://t.co/5hrOXDqGzW
@LarrySharpe Basically made molded plastic possession a crime
@marcmolinaro @NYNOW_PBS So tell us how your going to change things. Details please
@lisamurkowski Perhaps you should learn about state sovereignty
@anythingbutdem @jonpete69 @justinamash Its all bs for political show. Congress has authority on tariffs congress has NO authority to delegate that authority. Therefore there is nothing to reverse since it was never valid in the first place
@justinamash Its all really a mute point. ONLY CONGRESS has the authority to set tariffs. I don't really care what some U.S. code says, no where does congress have the authority to delegate their authority on tariffs.
@RepRoybalAllard @CongressRTBot Sad how congress, the only ones authorized to fix this find that doing nothing so they can keep the narrative going is more important than people
@RepRoybalAllard @CongressRTBot Love how corruption and illegal activity only matter when its not supporting your agenda.
@SenatorMenendez @CongressRTBot Sorry, can't have much sympathy.  I personally know someone here LEGALLY who ACTUALLY SERVED in the military, has 2 children here, a mother and sister here, and her status here is always up to the embassy BECAUSE SHE NEVER DOES SHIT ABOUT HER CITIZENSHIP TOO

@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Same here 👍just tweeted you without the others i just noticed tagged on that whole thing 🤣🤣🤣
@DariusConquis wanted to loose the other parties tagged in that conversation. I've got some thing to get done but I'll check back later or tomorrow
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Sign up for usda fisa emails to see just how ineffective usda food inspection is. I was getting 3-6 recall notices a day. Thats out of the plant and into circulation. The fda is responsible for how many deaths. The more gov protects the worse things are
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Federally no. Of what you mentioned they would all be state issues. CDC report that was conveniently suppressed found that guns were used something like 3million times defensively compare to 5,000 unlawful homicides in 2016
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Again, the constitution is not faulty or behind the times its the corrupt p.o.s who are effectually breaking what ever laws they can and getting away with it
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Plus the whole big thing yesterday was congress passing some emergency measure
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Trump can not repeal ANY law. If its a regulation thats another constitutional can of worms because bureaucracies are under executive control but act as all 3 branches of gov. And both cases come down to congress neglecting their duties &amp; passing the buck
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot To be bound to the rules and laws that govern them. One would have to question why someone is ok with a small elite group they are calling themselves neosapiens that are intellectually above the rest of us determining everything thats allowable
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot So, ok with all that said  unconstitutional or not, there is already a law addressing undetectable guns. So its all look what i did vote for me political show. What i want for you or the next person is relevant. What  "i"  want is for the federal government
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Note that each time i say regardless of personal beliefs. Go with the concept. When has society decided rights? And if they were to then thats mob rule which may be all fine until you don't have a right to something even though you've done nothing wrong
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Ref article. 1 shot one use take your life in your hands 😁
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot .380 very small round. I'm seeing muzzle energy of 180 to 340 ft/lb. 9mm I'm see 290's to 500 ft/lbs. Not to mention the heat Without researching more I'm having a hard time with a plastic barrel being effective in any way
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot There are 2 choices regardless of your personal beliefs. 	1, rights are something people possess from a source higher than gov.	2, government determines, as the ultimate power what your rights are, if any. 	There is no 3rd option
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Need metal slides and barrels.	Ignore the idiot part. Just put it for descriptive purposes https://t.co/LiagO8JFcT
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Rocket launchers in general, no fed authority but since its arguable if thats a firearm I'd say it's a state issue. Plastic guns- not 100% up on whats going on right now but in the past its all been hype. From what i know they are talking lowers they still
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Any and as many guns- due process addresses so baring that again its not within the gov's authority. Suppressors- not up on the federal end off hand but plenty of states already allow them and they don't silence anything. Media hype
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot I'd semi argue the "living document" the founders made it clear that the interpretation is derived from those who put it together and the ratification which "sold it" to the states.
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot They were endowed by the creator. Regardless of personal belief the point is gov is not the ultimate power therefore the gov can not take what a power higher than it self has given
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Changeable yes through amendment. Catch is, if you want to call it that, those first 10 are not amenable. They were added because a number of states felt certain rights were not adequately represented to remind government they had no authority.
@RepJoeKennedy @CongressRTBot 25 indictments of people who can never be questioned. Hmmm, it sounds impressive though doesn't it. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
@DCuz1 @alllibertynews @justinamash @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan It might help too if people knew that the Senate nor the president, is supposed to have no roll in a budget except to offer amendments.
@NancyPelosi @CongressRTBot Although convincing people we have a democracy works to your goals, if you don't know what form of government we have you need to go home
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Remember the states created the federal gov. They delegate specific powers and clearly outlined them. Thats why if its not in article I sect VIII  they have no authority. All the problems we see don't come from the gov being held to their intended purpose
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Just for argument, u wouldn't know it by politicians and the media but over the last 20yrs ALL violent crime is down like 49%. Factually this is the safest time in America
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Problem w the courts is law schools therefore lawyers therefore judges are not taught the constitution. They r taught constitutional law which is very different. The constitution isn't the problem its the corrupt p.o.s. trying to skirt it
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Twitter doesn't allow space for conversation. The answer is in the arguments of the convention and the federalist &amp; "antifederalist" papers and the state ratification hearings. As for the first 10 A's the ratification hearing and the notes from 1st congress.
@DonaldJTrumpJr @mike_pence WTF IS WITH THE U.N. FLAGS.	THATS A DISGRACE TO OUR SERVICE MEMBERS
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot Beloved NRA, you make a lot of assumptions in your hissy fit. As to plastic guns, do your own research
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot No need to get test just because you have no answer. Jeez. Your right there is no article in the entire constitution. That would be because the constitution created the federal government and its sole purpose was to define the federal government
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot 4, please quote me the article, section and clause that delegates the authority to regulate firearms
@DariusConquis @ChrisVanHollen @CongressRTBot 1, the supreme court does not "rule" or make law.		2, the supreme court IS NOT the ultimate arbiter of the constitution 		3, know that Korematsu v US still stands as constitutional do you really want to look at the opinions of the supreme court
@TenthAmendment The states are under no duty to enforce or abide by federal laws that the federal government is/was not authorized to create
@senrobportman @CongressRTBot Sir, sorry but are you a completely clueless? Congress has NO authority to delegate tariffs to the executive branch so the U.S. code is null and void anyway. Only congress has they authority to make tariffs. Stop playing people for fools for votes

@RepDonBeyer @CongressRTBot THEN FIX IT!   This lies solely in the authority of the legislature stop the bs so you can keep the talking point alive

@jba437 @justinamash @Steffi_Cole I think one could argue if they are here, not working, not going to school not recieving medical or financial aid or any other "privilege" reserved for citizens they would be outside the scope of fed authority. Hypothetically.

@SenateMajLdr Now do your job and ask the right questions. We need a constitutionalist not a conservative
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary That would mean the Senate has to ask the right questions which they never do
@SenTedCruz @senjudiciary I hope you senators actually ask questions concerning the constitution. Focusing on original/legislative intent would be nice. Looking at his record on constitutional issues may be helpful rather than just rubber stamping

@SheriffClarke The war on drugs is just another government corruption scam. Its a multibillion dollar government spending vehicle nothing more
@SheriffClarke This is about the only thing in his career that chucky has gotten right
@marcmolinaro Oh by the way none of you are LEADERS YOU'RE REPRESENTATIVES maybe you should try remembering that

@SpeakerRyan This is all just bs. Paying our troops is only a tiny tiny tiny portion of the spending which is used to pass all kinds of shit that is unconstitutional and can't pass on its own
@marcmolinaro @andrewcuomo @CynthiaNixon @MinerForNY @HowieHawkins This is called tribalism and its shared equally between the dems and repubs	Funny we're so worried about the fed and still see nothing on a plan to turn ny around.	https://t.co/hA1UGuLAxw @LarrySharpe

@RandPaul The whole evil ins co thing is a political talking point. Look to the scamming healthcare monopolies that their lobbyists created through government
@BrennanCenter https://t.co/hA1UGuLAxw
@RandPaul And most likely you will be fighting the same fight in September when they cut and paste the last disaster into the new one
@marcmolinaro Shouldn't that statement be followed up by what you propose to do?

@SpeakerRyan If you won't work for the people may work for your baby's future. Or do you believe your self proclaimed political eliteness will insulate them from the need
@PressSec @CBSNews @POTUS Wow, the replies. We live in this day of information and technology, how long does it take to research things rather than parrot what you heard, on either side
@WriteSmitty @PressSec @CBSNews @POTUS Where was the outcry on 2014 when that started?
@VickiBalfour Yup, oops ☺
@marcmolinaro @FIFAWorldCup Marc did you hear about the recent court opinion ref blocking people on an official public account
@JohnStossel interview Larry Sharpe
@marcmolinaro hey marc now your banning people from your fb page for pushing you on your lack of answers. Hmmm, didn't the courts just have an opinion on that....
@_LarryWilliams_ @RandPaul @PatrickHenry911 Don't forget if one can not afford an attorney your only hope is a government paid attorney.
@bobdaleyudflyer @RandPaul To be honest i have not looked into their debates on the matter but considering how well thought out and researched everything they did was, they intentionally left that open ended. And congress has the pwr to defund either way but they dont.
@unKit @CountryTime Heres an idea, since permits and licensing are only in place to curb compitition and create an avenue for political coruption  do away with them all
@SheriffClarke Sir, i couldn't agree more with you ref chuck the shmuck but honestly can you say the GOP is any different? They are selling out the people left and right

@SpeakerRyan All the sell outs scrambling to make it look like they're not working hand in hand with the dems because Nov is comming.
@RandPaul I'm thinking the whole war powers act is unconstitutional. The states loaned that pwr to congress. Not the exec
@RandPaul Senator, food 4 thought how congress DECLARES war is not defined. Therefore, does not congress declare every time they vote to fund a military action?

@realDonaldTrump now ur going to buy into bs media narrative&amp;liberal agenda. Check ur stats&amp;facts
@MSNBC They cut when the reporter stated but here in lies the problem. Their job is to report, not give their opinion not to tell people what just happened, not to push what they think people should think.
