@whoishopemills @madison_jbb I'm not accusing Madison of welfare abuse I'm just making an example
@whoishopemills @madison_jbb It comes down to the abuse of said welfare. I'd want to fund a community organization to help the needy rather than fund them directly.
@madison_jbb I'm not saying that welfare is a bad thing, but taxpayers should be able to choose where their money goes, by means of a referendum.
