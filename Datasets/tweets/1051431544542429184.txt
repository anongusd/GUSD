@TuckerCarlson Rutger was so very right. You are a millionaire funded by billionaires. You are NOT a man of the (hard working) American people. You are an elitist, compassionless, hate mongering imbecile and you’ve showcased your reactionary idiocy for all to see, yet again.
@mitchellvii “Failing to waste time” on ”tact” (as well as rejecting ethics, morality, and compassion in lieu of “strategy”), while proselytizing greed, hate and vanity, is why Trump fails as a president/human. Attempting to celebrate his sociopathy is [So sad!]. “Strategic Savant”? #UmmNo 😆

@ChatByCC @realDonaldTrump LOVE HOW AN OPEN RACIST “THINKS” SHE’S AN EXPERT AT THE DYNAMIC BETWEEN “Legal Immigrants” &amp; “Illegal Aliens.” HOW MANY DO YOU EVEN KNOW? DO YOU EVEN READ, IMBECILE, OR DO YOU JUST STREAM YOUR THOUGHTS DIRECTLY FROM HANNITY BROADCASTS? #STFU #RACIST #StopTweeting #GoReadSomething

@dennis_gauda @MosesStewart7 @CoryBooker No @dennis_gauda I sleep quite soundly each night as my party doesn’t ignore the needs of hard-working Americans while shamelessly shielding YOUR criminal, perverted, elitist president.

@dennis_gauda @MosesStewart7 @CoryBooker Language is anything but trivial, troll-bot. If you actually LISTEN to the  WORDS of your Führer-in-Chief, and THINK about them, you will COMPREHEND. You support an egregious, shameless, gaslighting, racist, felonious, misogynist LIAR. #Listen to the #PornPresident! #BlueWave2018 https://t.co/K2AQ5sS03F
@realDonaldTrump 😑I’m sorry that you don’t have enough shame to admit when you’re wrong. I’m, literally, sorry that you’re not sorry. But I’ll be much less sorry (though still sorry for us all) once you’ve been properly indicted, impeached, prosecuted and IMPRISONED. IMPRISON THE #PornPresident! https://t.co/vvAvuMrDo7

@60Minutes Oh, Donnie. Let’s think about that for a moment. “Let it be whatever it is to get the job done” is an approach that hasn’t worked so well for you, to date, as an understatement. You are not leading with intention and you are a moral failure. #BetterRethinkThat  #BlueWave2018
