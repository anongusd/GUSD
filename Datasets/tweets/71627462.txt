We're doing this for the long haul. We think there's a real need and hunger for (more) serious reporting and analysis from a right of center view that isn't about cheap clickbait or fan-service or simply winning the next election for a team. The end. 9/9
Last, on my new venture with @stephenfhayes, I don't want to get dragged into defending it against hypotheticals and imaginary b.s. but we don't see this as being about Trump, pro or con. If anything it's more post-Trump than anti-Trump. 8/
I think the reason "Trump-skeptical" enrages so many is that it allows for two possibilities: That Trump can do wrong and that Trump can do right. That bugs both tribes of absolutists (particularly on this website). 7/
The way so many elected GOPers have responded to Trump &amp; Trumpism have helped me realize that skepticism of politicians is vital -- regardless of partisan affiliation/ideology. It's always easy to be skeptical of the other team, I've become skeptical of teams, period.  6/
But there's a broader reason why I am Trump skeptical. The last two years have shown me that I should be even more skeptical of ALL politicians. Bill Rusher, the longtime publisher of NR used to tell young'ns "politicians will always disappoint you." 5/
There's also a left cult of personality on Trump, too. They veer towards thinking he's an *evil* genius. He's not that either. That's why I never went heavy for the collusion stuff. Not b/c he isn't morally capable of it, but because he's likely managerially incapable of it 4/
I use "Trump-skeptical," in part because I think the cult of personality around Trump is so nuts. He's not a stable genius (Neither stable, nor genius). He's not a great dealmaker. He's not a good person. But he's also not Hitler (Hitler could have repealed Obamacare btw). 3/
I mean go ask MAGA Twitter whether I am onboard the Trump Train, ffs. This is the problem with being neither resistance, nor MAGA. Both have a black-and-white view. If you're not resistance, you're a Trumper. If you're not MAGA you're resistance. It's all so stupid. 2/
Thread. All these people claiming that b/c I stopped using the term Never Trump, I sold out to, or started cheerleading for, Trump are just showing they don't know what they're talking about. When Rick Perlstein made this mistake in the NYT, the paper corrected and apologized. 1/

Likewise, if you're defending the use of these kids, imagine if they were advocating for a cause you despise, but were otherwise behaving the same way. Would you still be for it?
A useful gut check. Imagine the kids talking to DiFi were making the case for the issue you hold most dear or at least believe passionately in. Would you still be against it. My answer is: Yes, because I despise the politicization of children.

Glad to hear it. Honestly, I don't see a lot of SJW-types championing neutral rules or individual rights, save selectively when convenient to their larger agendas. You put stink on "not fully realized." No society can fully realize its ideals - that's why they're called ideals. https://t.co/qYK8maR4ch
More specifically, the ideals of neutral laws and individual rights — even when not fully realized — have provided more prosperity and freedom than any others in the history of humanity. https://t.co/oFL87kekDv
For argument’s sake let’s say you’re right. That doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be the ideal. And when we orient societies towards our ideals we get closer to them, which is better than the alternative. https://t.co/oFL87kekDv

@senyorreporter @jaketapper @SteveKingIA You could read the book.
@JazzShaw I think we're in fierce agreement. One reason we have raging populism these days is that too many decisions are being made far away in Washington. Most political decisions -- and most political fights -- should be at the local level where people can hold politicians accountable.
Right. At the federal level I am for the most part an extreme constitutionalist and libertarian. At the most local level -- the family -- I am communitarian/authoritarian. And it's a sliding scale between the two. https://t.co/h06HrFd3zc
And your failure to understand that we owe it to the next generation to give them some semblance of a constitutional order shows that you've drunk too deeply of rightwing Alinskyism and proves you can't be trusted to conserve anything. https://t.co/4ZsmyW4CO8
I believe I said I think it'd be a bad idea, but I'm ok w/local communities making bad decisions within certain parameters. I believe in economic liberty. I also believe in federalism.
