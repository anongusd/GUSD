The Kansas elections are even more remarkable than they appear. Part 4:		In 36 Governors races, no third-party or independent candidate won a larger share of the electorate than Greg Orman (6.5%) He did it oh-so-slightly-left-of-center and the Democrat still won Kansas.
The Kansas elections are even more remarkable than they appear. Part 3:		-Laura Kelly got more votes than Kathleen Sebelius did in 2002 and approximately the same as 2006. She did it in a three-way race. She did it without a Republican running mate.
The KS elections are even more remarkable than they appear. Part 2:		-In defeat, Paul Davis got more votes than Nancy Boyda did in victory. He did it without a Democratic incumbent on the upticket.
The KS elections are even more remarkable than they appear. Part 1: 		4-term incumbent Kevin Yoder got 44%.That's about how Kris Kobach fared when he challenged Dennis Moore in ‚Äò04. At the time, this was Dennis's largest Margin of Victory. Sharice did this without Douglas County.

Total employment in the higher min wage states increased by 9.7% from 7.5% for the other states where the federal min wage prevailed #ksleg
Retail employment grew by 10.2% in higher min. wage states over 8-year period, ~3x the 3.7% retail job growth in the other states #ksleg
In the higher minimum wage states, small businesses had a faster job growth (6.7% v. 5.3% for the other 40 states combined)... #ksleg
The # of small businesses with fewer than 50 employees grew by 5.4% from ‚Äô98‚Äì‚Äô03 in the higher minimum wage states, compared to 4.2% #ksleg
