@PizzaGateLibya @deebee52 @mflynnJR @GenFlynn @FBI @WhiteHouse So you are making up statements now with no support.	The rest of the country has filings they can read. I‚Äôve read them; have you? Or have you simply taken a conservative pundit‚Äôs op ed?
@PizzaGateLibya @deebee52 @Trumplican_68 @mflynnJR @GenFlynn @FBI @WhiteHouse @JosephJFlynn1 So Trump and Pence we‚Äôre lying when they said they fired Flynn because he lied to them? Which is it?	You also left out the most important piece-the fact that Muellers post-filing shows that the agents took every step to give that idiot Flynn a way out. His hubris did him in.
@PizzaGateLibya @deebee52 @mflynnJR @GenFlynn @FBI @WhiteHouse Proof?
