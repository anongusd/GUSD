Nothing the President said tonight was worthy of demanding the nation’s attention. He did not say anything new or say anything that had to be heard by everyone right away.
Mark Levin is on Fox calling Pelosi and Schumer “pathological liars” who “are putting the Democratic party ahead of the country.” Does he just take the things that Trump does and say that’s what Dems are? People who listen to this guy have no earthly idea what’s really going on.
It’s amazing how much Trump and Fox care about the real tragedy of a citizen dying but care nothing about the real tragedy of children from other countries dying in American custody.
Over on Fox, because Dems have supported border barriers in the past now they must support Trump’s wall even though they’ve already gotten border barriers built.

I don’t oppose the wall to score political points or to keep Trump from a victory. I oppose the wall because it’s a dumb use of money, it’s an ineffective tactic, and it’s never been about national security—it’s a monument to hate. We gotta tear those down, not build new ones.
If you’re going to ask progressive politicians whether they think Trump is a racist then please be sure to ask conservative politicians that, too. And follow up with “How can you possibly argue he’s not racist?” Don’t let them shift the conversation.
The wall has nothing to do with national security. Most undocumented immigrants fly into the country. Zero terrorists have come in through the Southern border. The wall is only a way to motivate anti-immigrant sentiment. Stop watching Fox. It’s not news. https://t.co/OvgDe7IfXR
