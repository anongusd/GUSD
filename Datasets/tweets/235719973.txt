Federal judge just dismissed FEC lawsuit against me. After eight year witch hunt from a corrupt prosecutor, Tom Mulvihill, the truth behind these baseless accusations is finally revealed. I always knew these false allegations would be exposed as politically-motivated fake news.

While Kavanaugh is scrutinized for an alleged sexual assault 36 years ago, Ass US Attorney Tom Mulvihill has yet to be held accountable for his recent sexual assault against a federal witness under his control. But stay tuned. He'll soon be exposed as a corrupt prosecutor. #MeToo

@tonyralph24 @SenBillNelson Absolutely.  You liberal Ds are used to hand outs aren't you?  How about Pepitos in Doral?  If you can fit in the door.
@tonyralph24 @SenBillNelson Anytime "bub".  Now go celebrate with a super size arepa.
@tonyralph24 @SenBillNelson Congrats.  You're a third of the way there.  The 70 must have come from our head.
@tonyralph24 @SenBillNelson No, five is your bra size and the number of your chins.  Lay off the super size arepas "bro" and do some more door to door walking.  Might take your number down to three or four.
@tonyralph24 @SenBillNelson Scott leads by five.  Reality can be tough "bro".	https://t.co/lbAUonz9Ig

So proud to be a Republican after Iowa caucuses. 60% of Republicans voted for a minority candidate. Dems are the party of the stale past.
This abuse of our immigration laws is propping up the Castro dictatorship and must end. The time to reform the Cuban Adjustment Act is now.
Carlos highlighted the need to reform the CAA during his campaign. With the House and Senate in Republican control, this is the time to act.
Congratulations to Congressman-elect Carlos Curbelo and the new U.S. Senate Republican majority. A great night for Republicans!
Now that the primary is over, it is time for all Republicans to unite behind Carlos and defeat Joe Garcia in November.
Congratulations to Carlos Curbelo on his victory tonight in Florida congressional district 26.
Too many issues to solve in Florida and I simply will not be allow myself to be  held hostage by liberal activist judges.
I have decided to suspend campaigning for CD 26 and will launch my candidacy to  the Florida State House for the 2016 election cycle.
Liberal activist judges are hijacking reapportionment and holding congressional  candidates like myself hostage.
Yesterday a Florida court outrageously invalidated the state's congressional  district map.
The current congressman is a Democrat who represents the failed economic policies of Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi. It's time for #change
I'm running to ensure our community has an effective representative in Congress who can work to deliver results and create jobs in S.Fla.
Today I announced my candidacy for U.S. Congress in Florida's 26th District.
Proudly voted against tax increases and more reckless spending. I came to congress to stand against growing government. #proudnovote
