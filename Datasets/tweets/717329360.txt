@chukAlsina @peterdaou The wars to control oil and access to energy are a tough pill to swallow. Americans hate war. Americans love energy.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Corporations should pay there fair of taxes. The wealthy should. I think even they agree. Healthcare System together should cover everyone. We agree there too. But the conversation needs to move to how to do that WITHOUT RAISING TAXES OR BORROWING.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou You have no moral argument for raising taxes or increasing debt when we can cover everyone without doing so.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou No need for a compromise. I guess if we just make EVERYTHING FREE that will solve all problems.... The road to hell was paved with good intentions.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Taxes don't have to be increased to 40-50% to cover Less than 10% uncovered or to improve healthcare.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou lf liberals, progressives, and moderates could just come up with a fiscally feasible plan.... We could just do the right thing for everyone...
@chukAlsina @peterdaou What percentage is 30 mill out of the entire population sir? We can make Healthcare more accessible and affordable without creating oppressive taxation.
@RealSkipBayless @undisputed We aren't missing a soul. I don't think any of us planned to make the playoffs at all. Lolololol see you this summer after draft and free agent season. Lolololol
@chukAlsina @peterdaou For 100% Healthcare coverage to manifest itself. Fiscal ingenuity will have to be a part of the equation. No person in America is against making healthcare more affordable and accessible. This is a democracy. Well thought out policy wins votes.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Moderates like the idea of coverage for all but we also understand that EVERYTHING we do has to protect against borrowing and oppressive taxation.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Wouldn't you like to cover all Americans without paying 50% of your hard earned money. Wouldn't you like to personally choose what you do with YOUR money? I would. AND I want to cover all Americans...
@chukAlsina @peterdaou You missed the whole point. We can cover the entire population without raising taxes OR borrowing. Why does that not interest you?
@chukAlsina @peterdaou You are out of your mind!
@chukAlsina @peterdaou The distribution of wealth is a symptom of the problem. Not the cause.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Bad life choices, drugs, and mental health are the primary causes of poverty.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou BUT. We can cover all. Without increasing taxes or debt. That is the optimum approach.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Lolololol no I do.not have a moral argument for why a small percentage controls the majority worldwide even in the rain forest.
@ComradeCalifor1 @peterdaou Taxes won't support single payer. People will pay a more than fair price for healthcare. The government will receive revenue from these plans. A win win.
@ComradeCalifor1 @peterdaou That's the past. Let's focus on the future. The ACA wasn't created to mast for ever. It was to show us the possibilities.....
@ComradeCalifor1 @peterdaou We should have a single payer choice and employer supplied healthcare for workers. That is a source of revenue. Then expand Medicaid. Everyone would be covered without borrowing or increasing taxes.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou You want to nullify the need for productivity, work effort. You want to nullify freedom of choice. You want to help the poor and reduce the cost of healthcare by excessively increasing the tax burden on workers. Your fiscal awareness is null.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Youre trying to transcend economy. . . Look at Russia. Communism creates more poverty, dependency, less production, less freedom. It just sounds good. BUT there is no such thing as a free lunch.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou As a moderate. WE MUST COVER ALL AMERICANS. WE MUST DO SO WITHOUT BORROWING FROM CHINA AMD RAIDING TAXES.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou A free bridge to sell you.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou And I have a free bridge to see you.... But it's going to cost you 40% out of every dime you make.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Money controls money. That is nature. How and why would people who have no fiscal awareness be in control of fiscal policy??
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Drug addiction is the biggest contributor to poverty.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Communism and Ultra capitalism are evil twin brothers.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou We have a great deal of poverty because people born here don't value working! They don't save! They are not being as productive as possible waiting for a handout!
@RealSkipBayless @undisputed Lolololol
@Balancement @peterdaou Don't reply to me then mute me.... That's cowardly and rude.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Canada's plan has some really bright spots though.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Great Britain's plan is the anti example. France and Germany are the size of a state.... What works for them won't work for us.
@Balancement @peterdaou "Free Healthcare is a lie." Workers will be forced to pay over 40% of there income in taxes. It will be oppressive for workers.... #freeoppression
@chukAlsina @peterdaou See... You believe communism leads to a better life for the poor and it never has... Free for All is a lie that generates poverty and dependency. As well as super elites and kleptpocratic despots.
@Balancement @peterdaou Healthcare is a human right?   We can give people a right to Healthcare without raising debt or taxes... That is my only point.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou I'm not for tax breaks like the ones Republicans recently passed. It was reckless and irresponsible. An attack on the poor. We should not attack one another. It is self deprecating.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou At the cost of excessive taxation, poor service, and limitation of choice. Why not provide options while reducing taxation and increasing government revenue? Why not? Wouldn't everybody be covered?
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Fiscal limitation is no illusion.......... Fiscal limitation is a reality. Nothing is free. The government's resources are not unlimited. There are limitation to what acceptable in terms of taxation and borrowing.....
@Balancement @peterdaou Don't put words in my mouth. But excessive debt and taxation is dumb. We can be fiscally smarter. While STILL covering all.
@Balancement @peterdaou What countries? England is being crushed by taxation. The countries with Free Healthcare also have smaller populations and less poverty. Free healthcare is paid for by workers. It costs more.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou If you think raising taxes above 40% and selling people on the idea of the FREE FOR ALL then you are lying to yourself. A government heavy in debt and taxes is doomed. That is oppression. That is communism.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Maintaining a healthy system is more important than corporate profit. We agree. However it can be done in a fiscally responsible manner that doesn't raise taxes.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou It's disingenuous to think taxes won't rise above 40% sir... We must curtail the expansion of National debt and exhorbitant taxes.
@ComradeCalifor1 @peterdaou You want to help but you don't want to pay the taxes that will come with Free Healthcare for All. Nothing is free. It's paid by raising taxes on workers.
@ComradeCalifor1 @peterdaou We should have a national single payer healthcare option where the government can make revenue without raising taxes.
@ComradeCalifor1 @peterdaou Most people are already covered. We are trying to incrementally make changes to cover the poor, unemployed, low wage workers, and business owners. Free healthcare for all raises taxes to 40% and better. That is a deal breaker.
@Balancement @peterdaou First of all. America is socialist and always have been. Free healthcare for all is communism.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Expanding national debt and raising taxes are fiscal solutions that should be off of the table. For everyone. Both parties.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou A single payer national plan coupled with an expansion of Medicaid should solve the entire healthcare crisis w/o Raising taxes BUT creating a source of revenue....
@chukAlsina @peterdaou The wealthy don't "extract" either. They earn or invest like everyone has the option to do of the chose. We should help the poor but in a manner that is fiscally responsible and smart. NO AMERICAN WANTS TO PAY ABOVE 33% NOR SHOULD THEY HAVE TO.
@chukAlsina @peterdaou Capitalist billionaires is a loaded name calling attempt. They should pay there fair share as everyone. However, free healthcare for all will increase the tax rate FOR ALL and unnecessarily. It's a bad plan...

@IngrahamAngle @LifeZette No. And they aren't ready to "rule". Communism is a lie. It   panders to the poor's economic instability and neediness. But it only generates dependency, economic impotence, and deeper socio-economic division. Everything can't be free. Nothing is free.
@TeeSolo_1 @RepMarkMeadows I know you guys believe some wall is going to stop illegal immigration but it will not. The problem is bigger than a wall. The wall would only be a small tool in a comprehensive plan. The wall is not worth shutting the govt down. Not even close. This is a mistake.

@aaron_psky @GeorgePapa19 @simonamangiante Check Guevera is a hero for many reasons. Though he was a communist, he fought for healthcare for poor people. That is commendable. He had a heart for people. However communism makes beggars of men and creates a greater degree of social inequality and takes away freedom of choice

@aaron_psky @GeorgePapa19 @GeorgePapa19 went to London for one reason. To meet Russians to negotiate the exchange of information/money/electoral support for the removal of sanctions.

@Donna83529215 @RepMarkMeadows There was funding for a wall... In fact there was money already allocated for the wall per Trump's declaration that the wall is being built right now..... This is a hoax. The Senate and House could pass an agreement with wall funding without Trump.

@OurLibertyRocks @RepMarkMeadows There's NO PLAN for the wall. After 2 yrs, no plan that has been vetted for efficiency and efficacy. We allocate money to plans that have gone through the legislative process. This is a joke of a political strategy. Trump looks like a buffoon. Would allocate $20 bill to a plan.
@surfklutz @RepMarkMeadows The government is shutdown to try and force Democrats to vote for a $5.7 billion blank check. No. Trump is using American families as leverage. @realDonaldTrump should be impeached for that alone!

@bellarene7 @BillOReilly @GOP No. These are 3 terms that exist on a polar scale. Capitalism and Communism on the far ends. Socialism is everything in the middle marked by the degree economy leans toward capitalism or communism.
@bellarene7 @BillOReilly Socialism is a mixed economy where degrees of government control vary widely. Pure communism is government control. Pure capitalism is all free market
@bellarene7 @BillOReilly Socialism is broad ranging. There are no purely capitalist governments and very few public communist governments. Almost every government is socialist. The measuring stick is the degree of free market or government controlled economy.
@bellarene7 @BillOReilly Free market always comes first, however some industries can only be partly or totally managed by government economically and for the benefit of the public.

@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt Yes. The FBI, CIA, and Senate have concluded this. Russian politicians have admitted it. Trump campaign members have admitted it. Russian spies have admitted it. Russia attacked our electoral system to elect Trump.
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt No, sir. Oligarchs are using money stolen from the Russian people who are murdered if they speak out against said corruption. They have no civil rights. The govt is a kleptocratic dictatorship. The market is not free. It's mostly govt controlled.
@bellarene7 @BillOReilly @GOP Stupidity? You keep using socialism and communism interchangeably when they do not mean the same thing. Public schools, fire departments, public libraries, central banking, assistance for the poor is socialism.
@bellarene7 @BillOReilly @GOP Trump sold our country out to communist Russia. Pure capitalists have ZERO loyalty except to money. Pure communism and Pure Capitalism lead to the exact same thing. Kleptocracy, despotism, super elites, and super poverty.
@bellarene7 @BillOReilly Lesson. Pure capitalism is on the far right of the continuum. Pure communism on the left end. Everything in between is socialism. Socialism is wide ranging. Our application leans heavily towards capitalism, free market.
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt Do you think Russia attacked our government and the individual votes of Democrats because we're Republicans?

@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt The U.S. should Lead with peace and humanity. We agree. However, our military presence grew from necessity quite reluctantly. We should put a check on it but we are not naive. And will not play patsy.
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt The continental U.S. has largely been removed from the presence of war. There are nations where war is as natural more natural than clean water.
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt Putin, Assad, Kim, Ergodan, ISIS, the Taliban, Iran, Israeli-Palestinian-Syrian conflict to name a few... Putin is foeming an Axis of Evil now. Entities are attacking our electrical grid and nuclear facilities.
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt Don't forget isolationism was our policy before Hitler, Mussolini, and Pearl Harbor. Now we have Assad, Putin, Kim, ISIS, the Taliban, etc....
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt I agree in many ways however there are difficult conversations/realities/threats to us and our Allies that require strong military presence. That have maintained peace and prevented larger scale wars.
@RobertOryx754 @justicedems @shaunking @AOC @sunrisemvmt I get it, but it can not be underestimated the depravity of some nations, despots, and terrorist groups. Our military is not in many of these places for nothing. Hitler was not a mutation.

@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett It's not about being poor. It's about the ability to keep what you earn and use it for what you choose. This right must be protected whether you are rich or poor. It is a principle.

@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett Tax and spend is bad policy. The tax rate kills your spirit to work. Do you want to pay 40-50% of your income to taxes before you even deposit your check? No. So let's not even consider it. There are smarter solutions.
@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett That's the point. If you were in their shoes you wouldn't want to earn a $1 and pay .70 in taxes. You would stop trying to earn as much because of diminishing returns.
@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett You can not guarantee a min. wage worker works harder. A hedge fund mangr has their own troubles &amp; it cant be assumed easy work or more people would be doing it. If you choose to work at minimum wage or be a hedge fund manager freedom to keep what you earned must be respected.
@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett It takes away their right to build wealth. They have a right to build wealth to whatever they want if they can. It's about freedom of choice not what they live on.
@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett "Plenty of wealth out there."... We have to stop depending on higher taxes andborrowing money. Period. We have to come up with innovative fiscal solutions. People who work want to keep their money. Excessive taxation is killing other countries and so is debt.
@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett Do you want to pay 40-50% of your income to taxes? Why not? How could you think it's fair to force someone to pay 70% of their income?? It's just not right.
@actingliketommy @Mikel_Jollett But that's not fair. It's an attack on people's ability to keep what they earned. There are ways to fund green energy WITHOUT RAISING TAXES OR BORROWING MONEY. That needs to be a priority.

@AOC There is no justice in promoting healthcare for all as free. It is not free. Every check workers will pay 40-50% of their incomes before childcare, rent, bills. It is unjust and unAmerican. It challenges work effort and freedom. There are better options. @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries

@simonamangiante Mr. and Mrs. #Deplorabledog
@RepAdamSchiff No more tax and spend. The future of American politics is fiscal conservatism. Republicans cut taxes and still spend more. We must work to reduce debt.
@RepAdamSchiff National Single Payer Healthcare System.... Gives choice, makes it more affordable, more accessible, and provides a revenue stream to the federal government reducing deficit spending and debt over long term.
@Bald_And_Bougie You disagreed with me. I stand by what I said. Should've paid Bell. Should've made sure Ben and AB were on the second page. Talent/ depth was lacking.
@Bald_And_Bougie We can end it like that. Neither one of us knows why the Steelers suck. Not a big deal to me.
@RepJayapal No New Taxes. Working is the foundation of the American Dream. Affordable Healthcare is a right. FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL IS A DREAM THAT WILL TURN INTO A NIGHTMARE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.
@RepJayapal The far left of the Democratic Party is about as crazy as the far right! Free Healthcare for All is poor policy in every way. It is unsustainable! It promotes poverty, deincentivizes work effort, and explodes national debt. @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries
@RepJayapal In the face of rising debt, the future of the Democratic Party is fiscal conservatism... Not multiplying our debt and increasing taxes to 40-50%! @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries  The problem either spending other people's money is that eventually runs out! This plan is dead on arrival.
@RepJayapal I BELIEVE THESE COMMUNISTS ARE SECRETLY TRYING TO DESTROY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries
@RepJayapal Fool's gold! Nothing in life is free. I national single payer system will allow for choice, affordable healthcare, and revenue. FREE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL IS A LIE. IT COSTS AMERICANS THERE FREEDOM TO SPEND AND SAVE THEIR OWN MONEY. @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries
@RepJayapal Free for All is a communist concept. It destroys work effort and contributes to poverty. America is founded on hard work. Healthcare will be solved by a national single payer plan. We must promote productivity, not more handouts and increased poverty. @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries
@RepJayapal This platform will totally destroy the progress made by the Democratic Party. It is socially and politically irresponsible. This platform will weaken and divide the Democratic Party. @NancyPelosi @RepJeffries
@RepJayapal Listen. You will not promotion communism in America. Free Medicare for all will force taxes to 40-50% of income. This is unfair and will take away the freedom of choice for workers, reduce gainfully employment, and reduce work effort.

@AOC The key to your efficacy, legacy and the adoption of your ideas is the ability to fund them w/o raising taxes. Any plans that involve raising taxes will fail miserably, divide the Democratic party, and cause massive election losses. Those consequences are utterly unacceptable.
@AOC Wowsahs lolol... Nice. That being said, i would like to for you to promote a national healthcare plan not free healthcare for all. Look for ways to help the poor both having to raise taxes to an unacceptable level. Find ways to subsidize &amp; promote Green Energy w/o raising taxes.

@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie Here's the joke in Trump's demand... Congress will never allocate funds before a plan is thoroughly developed. The Senate knew that.

@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie NO offense, where can I read the plan? Does a thorough plan exist with an itemized or even categorized budget? No..... So the answer to the request for $5 bill is NO....
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie My guess is you believed Trump when he said Mexico would pay for it. Maybe you believe he should force Americans to go without pay for him to get $5bill for something yet planned or evaluated... #deplorable
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie Trump wasn't OFFERED a blank check. He is asking for one.
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie I am a conservative liberal and a proud member of the Democratic Party.
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie Trump has the same authority. We have advised him to do so. He wants a blank check. He will not get it. He will not get a $5bill blank check.
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie We want a thorough plan. No money will be allocated before then. He can torture American workers and contracts if that's how he wants to use the office. We will impeach him for such an unethical and abusive act.
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie No.... The fact that what he says the money will be used for changes on a weekly basis. The news simply records HIS words and reports. How do you know of what the money will be allocated for? Have you read the plan????? What are you relying on for your information?
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie We will not allocate for an unsound, unplanned $5bill brain fart. He sold the lie that Mexico would pay now he wants to harm hard working Americans to force Democrats to make tax payers borrow money from China to pay for it. Hell no. He can get impeached. We willl consider that.
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie The front lines??? Trump's ideas on the wall have been described as ineffective and too costly by the GAO and other evaluators. The plan is not yet sound enough to allocate billions!
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie What kind of wall? Where? Designed how? Just a physical wall? These important details are ever changing because there is no plan. Americans, America shouldn't be forced to suffer because Trump nor anyone else can be trusted with a $5bill blank check. That's not how govt works.
@njdevils7833 @MSNBC @ZenFriar @SavannahGuthrie There is no way to have zero illegal immigration or crime for that matter. We regret the loss of any life to crime especially by illegal immigrants.

@denise_snively @Barnes_Law @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump That's not what the people he employed to commit treason say under oath... In fact all of Trumps campaign staff and Flynn were foreign agents of hostile nations, suspected traitors, or suspected of taking bribes... Deplorable dog.
@BeachBlonde8 @Danielgrnwell @jaqs_the_ripper @Debbieupper1 @MarkYoungTruth @WilmingtonDiver @13WJM @GregHolderness @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 @carterwpage served on the military too. Now his every aim is to forward Russia's political and economic agenda. A traitor.
@BeachBlonde8 @Danielgrnwell @jaqs_the_ripper @Debbieupper1 @MarkYoungTruth @WilmingtonDiver @13WJM @GregHolderness @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 Your president stands with our most sincere enemies. People who hate freedom, democracy, and "western values". News flash dog, western values are American values.
@BeachBlonde8 @Danielgrnwell @jaqs_the_ripper @Debbieupper1 @MarkYoungTruth @WilmingtonDiver @13WJM @GregHolderness @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 I'm sure Russians celebrated in the streets when you retired.
@Barnes_Law @MittRomney @realDonaldTrump A treasonous rat won. Trump is a deplorable person and an even worse president. America made a mistake.
@BeachBlonde8 @Danielgrnwell @jaqs_the_ripper @Debbieupper1 @MarkYoungTruth @WilmingtonDiver @13WJM @GregHolderness @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 You need a vet, you dog.
@realDonaldTrump Your time is as good as up.
The #acorndrop #raleighnc It's a thing. https://t.co/y7cXdNpjq4
@socdemnow @KamalaHarris Who of you who espouse free healthcare want to pau 40-50% of their incomes in taxes? I don't think that is fair.
@socdemnow @KamalaHarris Of course healthcare helps people. It doesn't have to be unaffordable. And we can help the poor get healthcare without raising taxes to 40-50%. Its poor policy. It will create more problems than it solves.
@realDonaldTrump Honestly. This mindset is one of the reasons impeachment is imminent. All we asked for was a genuinely thought out evaluated plan. Instead of taking an opportunity to shine you ruined it and ruined the holidays for thousands. You are an utter disappointment. #resign
@KamalaHarris We need a layered plan for workers, able bodied poor and indigent, and poor elderly and children... A plan that is not just budget neutral but one that creates federal income. EVERY BODY WINS. Medicare for all is a free lunch that costs more than lunch used to.
@KamalaHarris Free healthcare care is poor policy. And it is a platform the Democrats shouldn't run on and can't win on... Nothing should be free. When you require people to apply themselves, they find the energy to rise out of poverty and apathy.
@KamalaHarris Noooooooooooooooooo.... Medicare for All is bad policy. We need a national healthcare plan for all that makes money for the government and reduces business costs. And a plan for poor able bodied people that incentivises work and education efforts.
@puhpuhpuhpow @KamalaHarris Healthcare costs. Nobody who works for a living wants to pay 40-50% of their income for healthcare. It's not fair. It's nonsense. Will never work. Will only incite Republicans and lose independents.
@KamalaHarris That Free College platform lost the election for Hillary! We have to move away from FREE as a rallying cry and approach to policy. WORKFARE works. Communism. We need to win conservative votes not give elections away. also BETTER POLICY. BETTER POLITICS.
@KamalaHarris If everything is free, why would people work? We want to incentivise education and work effort not cultivate poverty. CLOSING THE WEALTH GAP REQUIRES WORK, SAVING, AND INVESTING. COMMUNISM SUBVERTS THAT EFFORT FURTHERING WIDENING THE WEALTH/ POWER GAP.
@KamalaHarris A simple national healthcare plan should be partnered with a free healtcare plan for the poor and elderly which requires back to work efforts just like other examples of publib assistance.
@KamalaHarris Nooooooooooooooo. We cannot deincentivise back to work effort. Free healthcare will cause taxes to increase to 40 to 50 percent unfairly and unequitably burdening workers. THERE SHOULD BE A SIMPLE NATIONAL PLAN AVAILABLE TO ALL SOLD BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
@BeachBlonde8 @GeorgePapa19 i was referring to how @georgepap19 excuses Mifsud of setting up him and Trump yet he married a woman introduced to him by Mifsud. Pap's own family thinks it's suspicious. MIFSUD IS A RUSSIAN ASSET!
@carterwpage we will be thankful when you are tried for treason and expatriated you treasonous rat. Go back to Russia. YOU WILL NOT GET AWAY WITH THIS.
@GeorgePapa19 a more important question is why did you want to contact Russian intelligence?
@GeorgePapa19 your wife is working for Mifsud. He introduced you two. @beachblonde8
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @ShayneDavidEwer @TIGGERR00 yeah screw you @beachblonde8. Let me troll my good friends Carter Page, George Papadop, and Devin Nunes. #pissons
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @ShayneDavidEwer @TIGGERR00 Send all cheap tricks to Trump. He likes to get his prostitutes pregnant and abort the children. Sometimes....
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @TIGGERR00 What about #MariiaButina @markyoungtruth? Is that a hoax too?
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @TIGGERR00 lololol. Its a sucker bet. Ill help you cover the impeachment trial. DONT WANT TO TRIVIALIZE IT.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @TIGGERR00 Just like Mariia Butina's classmates reported her. For being a filthy disgusting rat. I GUESS HER GUILTY PLEA IS A HOAX TOO.....
@MarkYoungTruth @ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 This was the original tweet. That there is no evidence of neither Russia's attack or the Trump campaigns collusion. CONTINUING THE WITCHUNT LINE. . . . Lolololololololololololol buffonish
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 What Trump is going to need is better legal representation. Mueller is undefeated. IMPEACHMENT IS GUARANTEED.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 ROY MOORE IS A PEDOPHILE. A CHILD RAPIST. . . A DEPLORABLE.
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 you have been following me for 4 days. Now i am following you.
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 I will keep an eye on you and your friends. You will not defend Russia*s attack on our electrical grid and their attack on our electoral system while vehemently defending Trump without me alerting authorities. . . I WONT BLOCK YOU. Either. I WELCOME YOU.
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Russian trolls followed and targeted unsuspecting Americans. I am not unsuspecting.
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 #Walkaway from Trump and Putin
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 your tone disturbs the dead.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Even Mariia Butina is telling it right now as we speak........ Lololololololololololol YOU KNOW EVERYTHING IS OVER NOW, RIGHT? ..... WE KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.  #Walkaway #Flee while you still can #OnlyOneRaleigh #TheCapstone
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Jarheads...............
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 The criminal case is far gone.
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Me and Mueller are undefeated. You guys are making a mistake. #Walkaway from Trump and Putin. America demands better. Russia deserves better my comrade.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 the hacking of personal emails was illegal. Hacking electoral systems an act of war. Troll farms illegal. Bribes illegal. Mariia Butina illegal. $ to Inaugural Fund illegal.
@BeachBlonde8 @ShayneDavidEwer @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 my blog??? You guys are making a serious mistake. You should cut your losses. Gloat about YOUR WINS. YOUR AGGRESSION, DISRESPECT WILL BE MET WITH JUSTICE.
@yvotesmatter @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Thats what moves this into treason. That should have been a deal breaker. Trump still denies that his comrades did that. NOTHING is more important than the sanctity of one's vote.
@BeachBlonde8 @yvotesmatter @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Again. You defend another Russian attack on the proper function of the U.S. govt.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 im glad you think thats funny. Lolol I laugh with you.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 That is collusion. Conspiracy AGAINST the U.S. Bribery. Treason.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Cohen no doubt discussed his representation of Trump at the meetings with Russian agents including Torshin, Mariia Butina's boss and sanctioned oligarch. Cohen handled the bribe$ from Torchin.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Flynn said that he was making plans to remove Russian sanctions in return for their illegal electoral support and cash bribes.
@ShayneDavidEwer @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Papadop said he was sent overseas by Trump campaign to find a covert link (Russian intelligence) to the Russian govt to retrieve stolen emails and solicit their support which came in the form of hacking, troll farms and ca$h. That is collusion, conspiracy, and treason.
@dcexaminer Putin is not welcomed on American soil. . . He should be arrested if anything.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 i would like to see him try. Whitaker has already been advised by the Inspector Generaj to recuse himself. DESPARATION IS SETTING IN. . .
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 since they like their seats...... Not because of the facts presented in trial? You people are a threat to this nation.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 Fire the Special Councel. Please do. THE NATION WILL RIOT. OBSTRUCTION CHARGES AND REMOVAL GUARANTEED.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 ... Fire anyone for any reason... Sounds like Nixon's escape plan. It will only dig a deeper grave.
@sallyodum The democratic party needs to move to the center a good deal. And the republican party needs to stop letting corporate $$$ dictate its policy. SINCE 2016 polluters, the wealthy elite and russia have made the gop useless. A total waste.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 Reelection??? What about protecting national security? Justice?
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 This trial will be held publicly. I wouldnt count on Senators turning a blind eye to serious charges. There are many Republican Senators who will judge impartially.
@RepAdamSchiff Devin Nunes, Rand Paul, and every Congressman who traveled to Russia should be investigated regarding their contacts with Russia.
@RepAdamSchiff How??? Republicans control the Senate, the House and the Whitehouse....... Donald Trump is the worst President in American history. Still dont have a kindergarteners plan for border security.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT THE DOGS WILL BE RELEASED. AS THEY ARE ON TRUMPS TRAIL RIGHT NOW... THEY WILL BE THOROUGHLY RELEASED ON HIM, HIS CAMPAIGN STAFF, OUR ATTACKERS AND ALL THAT COLLUDED WITH THEM.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 What is Trump going to do? The House is ready to impeach. The Senate Intel Committee is ready to impale. The CIA. FBI, and DOJ are prosecuting parties. HE CANT SINGLE HANDEDLY OBSTRUCT MUELLER PROBE OR IMPEACHMENT. ANYTHING HE DOES WILL ENSURE AN OBSTRUCTION CHARGE.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 what dog does he have to let loose???
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 sorry to bore you. #impeachtrumpnow #nowallwithoutaplan
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 Trump's problem is nonpartisan. He has no support beyond Legislators who took Russian money or suspected of colluding with Russia ALSO.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 correctim: serving in the military makes you substantially better than a draft dodger
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @trancennumberpi @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 @USMCLiberal @Infantry0300 The Senate report didnt end with the conclusion that the Mueller probe is wrong or illegal. Trey Gowdy said that its conclusions should be respected and adhered to.
@MarkYoungTruth @WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @markyoungtruth Why did sanctioned Russians, Saudi*s, and other company put money in Cohen*s hooker hush money account AND THE INAUGURAL FUND? Is bribery an impeachable offense?
@PalmerReport wowsahs lol
@WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 Lets not make a mockery of something this serious. Trump is under investigation for Conspiracy Against the United States along with a host of other crimes including bribery, bank fraud, campaign finance charges and obstruction. This is not some football game.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 no need to bet on impeachment thats a foregone conclusion. And i doubt if he would be removed even if found guilty. But he will be found guilty of something serious.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 what is the specific bet?
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 i am willing to bet he will definitely be impeached. IF IMPEACHED. Definitely indicted on Campaign Finance charges, bank fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and/or conspiracy against the United States of America.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 No one has escaped justice yet except for a couple informants with allll the goods.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 What is the bet, sir. Im not much of a gambler but Mueller is all the way up. ITS EARLY IN THE 4TH QUARTER THO. . . Talk to me...
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth The Feds go light depending on one's level of cooperation. Ask #MariiaButina. She's singing like a #redsparrow. . .
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth The FBI has ALWAYS given lighter sentences based on one's level of cooperation in nailing the head of an organized conspiracy. Ask #MariiaButina. She*s singing like a Red Sparrow. Lol Might just let her go back to mother russia. ONE DAY. LOL
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 lololololololololol As astute a political pundit as you are/ You must not have read the statement of Offenses for Flynn, Papadop, and Cohen... I DONT HAVE TO GIVE MUELLER ANYTHING. AND THATS JUST THE INFORMATION THATS BEEN MADE PUBLIC.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 Unlike Trumps LOCK HER UP chants i take no pleasure in demanding justice for Trumps treasonous acts. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PENALTY FOR TREASON IS. CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MODEST.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 So far... 3 witnesses former Trump campaign staffers and one a National Security Advisor have testified that Trump directed them to covertly collude with Russia. The end...
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 The Obama Administration? Lolololololololololololololololol There is a Special Council probe and looming Impeachment proceedings. But NOT for President Barack Obama. . . )
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 Mueller is not Trump's biggest problem. The U.S. House of Representatives is.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 Only when it comes to Trump is it a disgrace for the FBI to investigate, expose, and prosecute Americans and foreignors involved in a Conspiracy Against the United States. You are a disgrace.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 Whats more of a disgrace? Selling out your country for personal gain or defending it at all cost? THEY WILL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THEIR ATTACK ON OUR GOVT. NEITHER WILL THE AMERICANS THAT AIDED AND ABETTED THEM.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @TIGGERR00 ... When do people get random visits from the fbi asking about criminal acts? ANY interview with the fbi REQUIRES honesty. He knew that. He pulled the plug on Trump/Russia. Papadop followed suit. Cohen brought the house down.
@WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 he gave trump up like everybody else because they are disgusted by trump. They fear the depths he is willing to go in betraying this nation.
@WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Flynn was already under military investigation for taking bribes from a foreign country.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 he plead guilty and took it back. Lololololololololololololololol. Lolololololololol
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Just #Walkaway
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 lolol. Puppy. #BLUEWAVE Gonna wash away Trump's stain on America. And push for a free and democratic Russia without Pootin and his thugs.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 lolol. Puppy. #BLUEWAVE Gonna wash away Trump's stain on America. And push for a free and demoratic Russia without Pootin and his thugs.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 he reaffirmed his guilt and offered to make himself to provide more information before his sentencing in March... That alternate universe you guys live in has purple dragons and unicorns.
@WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 A perjury trap is a simple question. The trap is self inflicted. It is impossible to get caught in a perjury trap if you tell the truth...
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 They are called criminals. Thats what he is paid to do.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Collusion bad. Bank fraud bad. Sexual assault bad. Lying bad. Protecting Russian attackers bad.
@WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 these russians have a pattern in there tweets. Deny, deflect to Obama or Hillary, send racist or sexist memes.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 when the fbi gives you a chance to be honest about your crimes and your coconspirators its a squeeze. One that you created for yourself by breaking the law.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 when the fbi asks questions that cant be answered honestly without self incrimination criminals call it a perjury trap.
@WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 helloooo @beachblonde8
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 We care. A great deal.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Trump takes Putins word above the fbi cia nsa and Congress... Yet you trust Trump. Walk away.
@WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Papadop's, Manafort's, Cohen's crimes are ALARMING! Not bogus by any stretch.
@MarkYoungTruth @BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 that is the choice for all criminals. The option to cooperate is gracious. No?
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 Foreign contributions to the inaugural fund. Foreign contributions to the shell account ALSO used to pay prostitutes to keep quiet. A criminal enterprise...
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 dont be so certain of that. The gop senate leaders are not fund of traitors.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 he was convicted of money laundering, bank fraud, and tax evasion. Thats just the low hanging fruit.
@WilmingtonDiver @BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 oh. The crimes arent bogus. Any body who tries to defend them as noncrimes is. DANGEROUSLY BOGUS.
@BeachBlonde8 @WilmingtonDiver @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 you also believe no one should be held responsible for Russia's cyber attacks and election interference. You want us to act like nothing happened!!!
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 You stomp for Trump but dont care anythng for his criminal staff. You dont trust Pootin but u trust Trump
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 if your hope that mueller probe is going to vindicate trump your hopes ARE founded on nothing.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 it passed gas #pootin
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 only 2 needed to witness for a treason charge
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 allow me to clarify. 3 people admitted to collusion.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 the senate had already passed a bill..
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 cyber terrorism, espionage, election interference...
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 conspiracy, bank fraud, obstruction, campaign finance violations, bribery
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 and you are pinning your hopes on what? That Cohen Papadop and Flynn did not tell EVERYTHING they knew and will have to tell Congress? You are sadly mistaken. THATS 3 POINTS OF CONTACT/ COLLUSION. 3 ATTEMPTS TO COVER UP CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE U.S. FOOL
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 the wall has no plan. It couldnt pass a republican congress. I dont see it passing a republican senate nor a democratic house... If you havent noticed the answer is still NO on the wall with no plan.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 all of the people you named either plead guilty or got lengthy sentences... Is that a joke???
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 mueller is a joke. . . Is that right? I respectfully disagree. I doubt if anybody charged or under investigation agrees. Thats nnot realistic. Thats delusional.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 the mueller probe is not being led by democrats. Dont let trump lie to you.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 trump lying to the public is his best asset. Lol coincidentally that is not going to bode well in his impeachment trial.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 what??? That sounded like ignore manafort and gate crimes. Ignore Cohen flynn and pap admitting to collusion. And ignore russias attack. no.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 A LOT OF AMERICANS CARE. IM AMAZED AND ALARMED THAT YOU DONT. YOUR LEVEL OF CONCERN DOESNT CHANGE THE CRIME OR THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 is it just me? Or is a 700 mile fence a deal breaker from the start? If you havent noticed the senate doesnt want it and the new house certainly doesnt... Is mexico going to pay for it?
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 who will be vindicated????
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 trump is a known liar. Everyone who worked for his campaign was a known criminal and liar.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 there will be funding for a physical barrier once it is planned and evaluated...
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 they pleaded guilty. They told what happened. In what way does that deflect to mueller*s character?? You just dont want to accept reality.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 cant trust mueller or fbi. Cant trust trump campaign. Cant trust trump fixer cohen. Cant trust the media. All we are left with is Trump and Pootin. Lol THATS A JOKE LOLOL
@MarkYoungTruth mexico can pay for it then... Lololol
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 perhaps cohen talked about that trip to prague... Perhaps.....
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 did you get that? Perhaps?
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 if. could. maybe. Lolololol they told everything... 2019 will not be the year of the deplorable.
@Newsweek ...
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 memes are for children. Read their statement of offenses and guilty pleas... And grow up. THIS IS NOT GOING AWAY.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 you may not watch the news but do you read court documents?
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 that turnip flipped states evidence. So did papadop. So did cohen. All collusion related.
@MarkYoungTruth just pay for what? The inside joke is that you cant budget a project that has no written plan. Its all a big joke. 5 billion dollars for what exactly?? Thats not how policy is created kids.
@BeachBlonde8 @MarkYoungTruth @TIGGERR00 that is so unconvincing....
@john_keim WE WILL TAKE HIM. #CAROLINAPANTHERS
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden being born in america does not exclude you from being a treasonous duplicitous rat or a supporter of such a deplorable.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Trumps Russian comrades could pay for it. They spent 2 billion to help elect him...
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden You are just in support of a 5 BILLION DOLLAR blank check for a brain fart... A fart with no plan. No budget office evaluation. A conversation about nothing. A political ploy. We have 10 bill for a plan... Let Mexico pay for that.
@FOXSports @undisputed @ShannonSharpe Is this not a business? Any player/ employee should sign for the max, UNLESS they can play with a championship caliber team, the best player, or a special talent piece... Common Sense
@realDonaldTrump You can't get anything from Republicans and Democrats who want to stop illegal immigration?????? You should #resign before you get escorted out by police.
@realDonaldTrump Where is the plan?????????? You don't get $5 bill for a brain fart in government. You get lolol'ed. You will get NO WALL until there is a thorough plan...
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Assad mass murders dissidents..... He shows be removed from office. Refugees are fleeing to neighboring countries for safety. He is a modern day Hitler.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden There are certainly instances of corruption and global overstep on our part, but Putin's war against freedom and democracy is dead wrong and anybody who supports it will be hunted and treated like the dogs they are.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Yett you choose Russia over America and empower Putin to attack us.... Assange, @Snowden made a huge mistake. They chose despotism over freedom and democracy.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Russia is not even a free country. The citizens have no basic rights. It is not a democracy. It is a kleptocracy. The $ Putin and oligarchs throw around is stolen from it's citizens.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden @snowden should have given what he stole to the American people- not a hostile foreign information service intent on attacking the U.S. yetttt protects Putin....
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Russia and the same company that funded the troll farms. They pay Russian mercenaries in Syria.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden N nno. Not according to him. He said the U.S. was vulnerable to cyber attack before he immigrated, expatriated to Russia. About the time their cyber attacks escalated to record proportions.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden @snowden would definitely get a fair trial if he leaves the bosom of Vladimir Putin. We would welcome him back with open  arms.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Cyber theft.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden If America is corrupt what is Russia under Putin? You cannot honestly think it is better. Less corrupt.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden It is illogical for even Russians to choose Putin over America.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Putin is a murderous despot that hates America. And that's why Assange and @snowden have such a close relationship with him.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden That is not entirely true. @Snowden is being given sanctuary by Vladimir Putin in Russia. It is I'm possible to assume he is not trading national security threatening information for sanctuary.
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden Lolololololololololol well I hope they come to the United States for sure... I think they have a good chance to be pardoned if they would just stop evading the law.
@radliberal If Vladimir Putin wanted meet him he would have been there on the first day of office
@KayKosmos Wealth is a function of work effort, skill, financial intelligence, discipline, and life choices... Nothing will change that. Wealth is not a function of happiness. Whats more important than wealth is individual happiness, freedom, and choice.
@nedryun @Barnes_Law What if up is down and the truth is not the truth? What if the Trump campaign staff lied to the FBI because they want the truth to be found out only in court? Confusing....
@BeachBlonde8 @TIGGERR00 @MarkYoungTruth @Snowden There is a process for whistle blowers. It doesn't include selling information that threatens our national security to Russia. It doesn't include fleeing to Russia. How can you expose corruption by fleeing to one of the most corrupt governments in the world?
@DearAuntCrabby @be_handy @MSNBC Neither.
@brithume @Barnes_Law ..... Why would anyone expect home to not to "dodge" the trip again? His previous behavior "spurred" the mistrust and disappointment.

@YoungAlex2217 @Mattch_Almighty @Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 The only welfare program hurting the biudget is health care. If businesses sdidn;t rape the AMERICAN PUBLIC it wouldn;t be an issue. But businesses can;t be left alone to do the right thing.
@Mattch_Almighty @Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 Australia's population is different... However, every model is worth studying. Will do. Thanks.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 A free economy is a tenet of socialism. Communism attacks the individual will and desire to work. It also strikes at economy itself. Any public policy that does not take economics into consideration is useless.

@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 @Ocasio2018 Communism IS NOT a new and novel idea............ Love, put those dusty archaics concepts back on the shelf. Time for truly futurist policy making. Efficiency, effectiveness. Budget neutral or revenue generating. Deficit reducing.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 Free college? Public schools are paid for by states and counties that can;t afford them. I gues you again want the federal government to pay for free college. How? Raise taxes again??? Every plan you have is costly, ineffective, and unnecessary. NO thought of funding.
@AJDorsey @GeorgePapa19 Man, you wasted key strokes with that lie.
@RealSaavedra Stop using Communism and Socialism as interchangeable words. They are about as interchangeable as far-left extremist and moderate liberal, centrist, or liberal conservative.
@GeorgePapa19 Just go to jail. Shut up.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 She is a communist and you guys know it. And I knooooowwwwwww somebody behind her has ALOT of money. Lots of it. And I want to know who it is! Same thing as Russian Election Interference.... no coincidence.....
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 THERE WILL NEVER BE A WELFARE STATE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THERE WILL NEVER BE 40-45% TAXATION. THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO SOLVE HEALTHCARE PROBLEMS WITHOUT ROBBING PEOPLE OF THE RIGHT TO GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 70% approval? Now.......... what is the percentage of people who are willing to pay 40-45% of their incomes??? I say UNITED STATES TAXES SHOULD NOT GO ABOVE 30%.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 If communism was so good why are all the people from communist countries trying to immigrate here??? Because communism denies your freedom to work and do better. To control your own life and destiny. It makes people dependent and lazy.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 If we can balance the budget, spend wisely, create efficient AND EFFECTIVE programs for the poor and elderly, create policies that support businesses and corporations, while putting the American people first, WE ALL WIN. America wins.
@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 THE FUTURE Of CONGRESS IS NOT ELITISM OR COMMUNISM. NEITHER IS SOCIALIST!!!!!!!! SOCIALISM SITS SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE. EFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY are the hallmarks of how we serve the people with care, provide oppportunity , protect the environment, and balance the BUDGET.

@Westbrookfan7 @Ocasio2018 Medicare for all isssss commmunism. It's universal healthcare. It was a great idea. We see it is too costly and causes income tax to rise to 40-50% That is not freedom! Workers shouldn't have to pay 40-50% of their incomes to pay for healthcare! Come up with a better SOLUTION.

@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Like I said, at issue for me is Election Interference/ Collusion, and the fact that @randpaul and other politicians are being bought by Vladimir Putin. They are committing TREASON. You know why we put sanctions on Russia. They were justified and weren't intended to last forever.

@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats You wild. LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL This was treat
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Obsessed? LOLOLOL It's just symbols. Just like Russia's state symbol.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats MY conversation was about @RandPaul being compromised. That is what youuuu chimed in on.  You ignored their invasion of Crimea and the murder of #Magnistky and went straight to America is wrong for placing sanctions on them. You actually made excuses for election interference,
@joncoopertweets @espyforsenate Yet she's supported by Putin's foot stool
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Look at the dollar again. At THE CAPSTONE. Humans are imperfect, so we always work to create a MORE PERFECT government under PROVIDENCE the same way we try to perfect ourselves. It may be impossible, but we challenge ourselves to always meet that expectation. That is America.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats You say I'm programmed because I won't accept that Russian Election Interference/ Collusion should go unpunished. Democracy, freedom, equality, &amp; transparency in government are OUR Western Values. And we will die for them. Our electoral system will not be attacked.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats if that's the justification for election interference so be it. Democrats' policy platform does not resemble anything like that. And nothing will stop the prosecution of wrong doing. The sanctions were a result of wrong doing as well. Election Interference was wrong and illegal.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats That policy has an origin. In one man's head. That he introduced to an organization. That introduced it to the right people that would incorporate the policy so they could use it to strike (OIL) Operation Iraqi Liberation. It was an executive order war not voted on by Congress.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats I'm nationalistic because I love my country. because the principle in that dollar bill mean something. It's the reason why people flock here to live. because we are the light on the hill. Freedom, Democracy, Justice, Equality despite how tough it is to do.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats You believe the U.S. murders its citizens for speaking their minds, Petro???? More than Russia, North Korea, or any other country?
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats We don't invade any country as a matter of policy unless they threaten us with war. The wars in the middle east were a profit move by the military-industrial complex. That's why there IS NO policy regarding those ongoing wars. Obama tried to pull all troops out!
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Because most of them are degenerate rednecks who are stuck in the 1800's. They are still waiting on Black people to pick cotton. The idiots have not woke up and realized that industrial revolution is almost 200 years old.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats I love Russia too. I stand for the Russian anthem. But I don't stand for invading peaceful neigboring countries, neither do I stand for murdering citizens who speak their mind. Reflect on that for a minute... That's why we sanctioned Russia. We stand by that
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats We didn't invade Russia! We just said that we weren't going to do business with them and neither were our allies because its illegal in our countries to murder dissidents for simply speaking their minds. The people of Crimea are a sovereign nation that posed no threat to Russia.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats See..... The under current for excusing Russian Election Interference/ Collusion is that Western Values cause discomfort to corrupt leaders who want to steal from their people and act like Gods. That not what the lingo on the dollar says to do. It's not right. That's the past.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats That's your opinion. I like the dollar. It has my language on it.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Ok. I hope its worth it. But our elections are not going to interfered with. That I can promise you.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Yeah.... That was eloquent but totally unrealistic. The @TheDemocrats are not war hawks. NEVER have been.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats Are you insinuating that Obama wasn't trying to work with the Russians on sanctions, because he was. They did not want to commit to changing their behaviors.... They forced is hand.

@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats The sanctions weren't permanent by the way. He didn't have to kill #Magnitsky and invading Crimea was wrong. These are things that could have been worked out at the negotiation table. BUT SOMEBODY IN RUSSIA HAD THE DUMBEST IDEA IN RECENT HISTORY. IT WAS NEVER GOING TO WORK.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul When we interfere in governments it's normally to give the people a voice. Their people want freedom. Putin has a strangle hold on their lives and their money. He wants to use their money to subvert the function of OUR government when his is ABSOLUTELY corrupt to the core. No sir
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul @TheDemocrats NO we do not. NO I do not. And NO I do not know one single person that does.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Disdain? Only from the standpoint of how malicious and disrespectful their actions. The right to vote is PARAMOUNT to our culture. They attacked that. They OVERTLY broke laws. They have to be held responsible. It was BONEHEAD, arrogant and was OBVIOUSLY a PUTIN brainchild.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul So why perpetuate that. @TheDemocrats don't support that. Russia's ELITES only concern is with $$$. Simpletons. Which they want to turn into political domination because they are tired of us treating them like younger siblings. But they must grow. They should.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Sir, if you think we are bad. What do you think a world led by Russia would be like? Their citizens can't even speak their minds. They live in fear. No government is perfect because it is managed by humans. But our way is the best way. This is an attack on Western values.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Not every president would collude with a foreign government to receive electoral support......
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul We are not talking about Libya right now.... That is a different discussion.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul I'm sure Crimea would say that about Russia. Our country was duped into war via a lie. The @GOP and @FoxNews supported the wars. It was a mistake. Americas are past war. We don't need senseless wars in the new millennium.
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul Rand Paul needs to tighten up. The lure of Russian money has Republicans drunk. America is about principle. The world shouldn't be led by selfish greedy murderous  despots.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul WWII marked the beginning of our partnership..... Russia deserves better than kleptocracy and murder. As a leader of the free world the Russian government should not be invading neighboring countries, murdering dissidents, and pilfering from its citizens. They are close to revolt
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul This Century?????????? Sir, you guys are upset about the U.S. being the world's leader in terms of how government's should be run and the economy. The only topic of this conversation is Russian Election Interference/ Collusion and the prosecution of those who committed crimes....
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Because our primary export is Democracy, freedom, Equal rights, free enterprise, freedom of speech, thought, and expression...‚Ä¶..
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul In that case Trump must go down. We want have a leader who is kompromised. Our pronciples lead the New World Order not personalities! We don;t have a king or a dictator. Russia broke the law, and so did he and his campaign.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul A New World Order based on Democracy, Freedom, a general concern for the welfare of citizens, a bill of rights, all men created equal...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Russia was a part of that beginning. They are falling backwards into fascism, kleptocracy. Russia is our sister country.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Wowwwwwww.... We don;t have to get off on a tangential conversation. The point is they attacked the 2016 and 2018 elections. We don't like it and everybody involved MUST be prosecuted. And Russia must be recalicitrant be repentant and make reparations before we move on.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul No one sanctions the U.S...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. PARTLY because we give them little reason to. In any case, is that a problem for you?????????????????????????????

@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul There are rules to this type engagement. There are Russian spies who have been here so long they are not even Russian spies anymore. But you don't do what Russia did. And they know it. And they are unapologetic. Trump appeases them because he is Kompromised. We are not.

@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL Wowww. See. Trumpsters support Russia. They know they did us wrong but want to look the other way. We can't allow that.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Petro. LOLOLOLOLOL Dolla Hollaaaaaaaaaa. LOLOLOLOLOL They did more than send Internet memes. What they paid to interfere in the 2016 and 2018 elections. They did not have to spend. We just wanted our comrades, leaders of the world, to not be murderous criminals.
@DroneTheFed @RandPaul Sounds like you are on their side. So be it. They can invade Crimea. They can murder their citizens. But if they do that we are going to sanction them.
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul I don't care. We have never hacked into their electoral systems. We never tried to manipulate votes or voter registration. They attempted to rob Americans of their right to vote. They attacked the Democratic Party! They attacked our nation. No respect. Evil. Malicious.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Sanctions was a course we would RATHER NOT take. You act like we just woke up one day and decided to sanction them.... They did a number of things that created sanctions. All they had to do was stop doing it! Instead they chose cyberterrorism, bribery, covert OPPS. Should we beg?
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Somebody needs to gas light you. Idiot. We have to protect our country. Just like they do.
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul So basically, you are suggesting that we should just act like nothing happened? Just let Russian oligarch's participate in American elections, bribe people, and commit cyberterrorism????
@DroneTheFed @AlgiersTrevor @RandPaul Well. You may think that is business as usual. EVRYBODY else sees it as a threat that must not be allowed to continue. It is illegal. It is a national security threat. Russian Intelligence does not have OUR best interest in mind. 100% guarantee.
@DroneTheFed @RandPaul America is batting an eye. The only people who don't care are the same people who wouldn't care if he "killed somebody in Times Square".
@DroneTheFed @RandPaul Yeah. If they had not spent every effort to attack the 2016 and 2018 election cycles and didn't have spies that were actively duping greedy and unsuspecting politicians and civic organization leaders. It would be different. They must be held accountable.
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul This is an active criminal investigation with national security implications.... Why are WE the ones trying to make peace? So we don't offend the people who attacked us?

@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul The Mueller Probe is not ridiculous. Calling the Russian government out for its crimes against our government is not ridiculous. What's ridiculous is how Trump attacks our allies while siding with Putin even in the case of Russian Election Interference. It is a pattern.
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul We'll dialogue on that level after the Mueller probe. We are dialoguing with people orchestrating an attack against the proper function of our government. Strength is MANDATORY.
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul Why in the fuck would we be reaching out to them while the people we are reaching out to are under investigation for cyberterrorism, and a host of other crimes. They are in a full out attack to infiltrate our government. No, sir. Their intent is to appease...‚Ä¶ #TREASON

@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul @WhiteHouse Here's another @RandPaul quote: "Republicans that are making the criticism are either the pro-war Republicans like McCain and Graham or the anti-Trump ones like Sasse ... They are motivated by their persistent and consistent dislike of the president."
@AlgiersTrevor @DroneTheFed @RandPaul @RandPaul says that the reason people are going after Russians who participated in the attack on the 2016 election is because they don't like Trump‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. NOT because they were involved in a conspiracy against the United States government. Sir?

@NKY_Mike @Press_X_ToJason @RandPaul Which is it? Did @RandPaul request to be introduced to Putin, or did the @WhiteHouse use him for a delivery boy. One or the other‚Ä¶.
@NKY_Mike @Press_X_ToJason @RandPaul According to the White House, the letter read: "I would like to introduce Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a voice for expanding dialogue with the Russian Federation. He will be in Moscow from August 5 to August 8.
@NKY_Mike @Press_X_ToJason @RandPaul The White House told Fox News that Paul asked Trump to write a letter of introduction to the Russian leader.

@carterwpage @MattWhitaker46 Btw, tell your friends at @mfa_russia that we're NEVER letting Mariia Butina go. They better be glad they rushed #nataliaveselnitskaya out of here or she would be locked up too. Free Mariia Butina? NO. LOLOLOLOL https://t.co/a0I5gx9KcR

@carterwpage @MattWhitaker46 THE FISA CANT BE UNDONE.
@carterwpage @MattWhitaker46 While you may not like our "Western Values", we do. The fact that the temptation of money means more to you than democracy freedom is disgusting. This is a classic case of greed, temptation, and betrayal. It never ends well. #MAGA Treason is punishable by death &amp; expatriation.
@carterwpage @MattWhitaker46 You were under surveillance. Get over it. The surveillance exposed crimes against the United States of America. ANY and EVERYTHING anyone does to try to impede or impugn the Mueller Probe only exposes Russia and the Trump campaign more.
@carterwpage @MattWhitaker46 Did you see this @carterwpage?  https://t.co/bhp8fbtu1z With all the contacts you and @GeorgePapa19 and @PaulManafort and #RogerStone had with the Russian government and Russian assets why wouldn;t the FISA court issue allow you top be surveilled?

@rancherbov @espyforsenate @cindyhydesmith whatever you say
@rancherbov @espyforsenate @cindyhydesmith Imagine HER being hung by her neck until she dies. That's the imagery she created by making such a barbaric statement. These people stand behind White face as right. The whole time they are nothing more than dirty, slimy, evil feral creatures.
@rancherbov @espyforsenate @cindyhydesmith In what context is a public hanging ok? Its illegal and inhumane ALTOGETHER. It was evil &amp; Godless for white people to do it to black people. ANY reference to a public hanging is a sly racist overtone and that's how I took it. She refuses to apologize because that is who she is.
@rancherbov @espyforsenate @cindyhydesmith Say whatever you want. I am offended and incensed. And every Mississippian should be too. That woman does not deserve public office.
@rancherbov @espyforsenate @cindyhydesmith I don't care how you try to twist it. She has exposed herself. And I believe her. I wouldn't attend a public hanging for any SOUL! The statement was small, racist, and murderous. She is a disgusting person.
@KathrynMaga @Knowita47918362 The media has reported on it.... That is a well known fact. However, black women aren't the only people who use Planned Parenthood services. Also, the birth control industry is VAST. The majority of women in America use or have used some form of birth control........
@KathrynMaga @Knowita47918362 Wealthier women who can afford abortions or have abortions paid for by men who have the resources have abortions by private doctors. Without assistance, poor women would have children they don't want and can't afford which adds to poverty and related problems.
@KathrynMaga @Knowita47918362 That is true. At one point the Democratic Party led the charge into the Civil War. Then they led the charge for Civil Rights. Things change over time. Poor women need access to abortion AND PARENTING resources. No 2 ways about that.
@Money23Green @samalipour @Money23Green what was that? That was small... You worried about @KDTrey5 contract for next year? You are not the GM, player. Seems like you trying to force him out for injured @StephenCurry30. Then what? Don't be so stupid. Everybody was pissed! You played yourself.

@Knowita47918362 I don;t agree with that statement. Forst the premise that abortion is abuse is false. Secondly, abortion rates are correlated with income level. @realDonaldTrump aborted his baby by Shera Bechard, a former Playboy model. Stop trying to pit Americans against Americans.
@Knowita47918362 LOLOLOLOL What??? You people misinformed and taught wrong. Black people are not simple and insecure. Your accusations of the Democratic Party mean nothing to me. I am a democrat. Every Black person I know is a Democrat, Republican or Independent. Who cares? Russia attacked US!

@simonamangiante You say he's "Western Intelligence", the U.S. govt says he is a Russian asset. Being that he 1. helped @GeorgePapa19 establish relations with the Kremlin. 2. introduced you two and you're married. and 3. George protected him. My belief is that he is Russian Intelligence.
@rancherbov @espyforsenate @cindyhydesmith I'll tell you like this. Those are fighting words. She says that in the wrong place and she would regret it. If it's ok to hang people then she should be the first on the noose...

@ThomasSowell Communism doesn't work. Our government has been socialist since the creation of the public school system. Since the New Deal. The Constitution is a socialist contract. The Preamble to the Constitution outlines the tenets of socialism.

@KatTimpf @ChuckCallesto Vladimir Putin is using Trump's greed and your willingness to turn your back on the truth to conquer and divide this nation. We are willing to go the furthest extent to prevent that from happening. Stop telling lies to the public to protect Trump and his collusion with Russia.
@KatTimpf @ChuckCallesto Please, please understand that no one wants to act this way. But what you are doing is serving the interests of America's enemies who are actively attacking our democracy and values, while they attempt to position themselves at the top of the World Order at OUR expense.
@KatTimpf @ChuckCallesto We are forced to listen to you people lie over and over again. It is terrifyingly similiar to the lies told by conservatives that propped up George W. Bush- war and recession was the result. You people are telling lies to defend the indefensible. You are HARMING this nation.
@KatTimpf @ChuckCallesto Imagine what it feels like to have your government held hostage by a President more loyal to Putin then American citizens. While @TheJusticeDept works to prosecute our attackers, he instead chooses to attack the people working to protect our nation.

@GeorgePapa19 LOL Boy do you think the thousands of people lined up in the streets across the country give a dam about declassification of a warrant that has produced exactly what it said it would produce? It produced YOUR GUILTY PLEA! NO MORE ATTACKING THE @FBI. America is offended.

@NBCLatino @Ocasio2018 College isn't a right. It's not a part of the public school system that was created by legislation. It's not even necessary. Overrated for most people. College should be more affordable, however. Maybe more options to pay for tuition or pay off student loans.

@OGNaegleria @yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI 1. Which emails? The DNC emails or Clinton emails. Their were two separate incidents of CYBER TERRORISM. Your IDEA that emails were leaked is an attempt to say that the Russian govt did nothing. 2. Why did the Trump campaign try to get them from Russia?

@yzerwing @Barnes_Law There is evidence of collusion prior to the campaign, during the campaign, and after the campaign. People have admitted in government records that there was collusion..... What more do you want? Do you think people are lined up in the streets for nothing?
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law George Papadopulos and Michael Flynn said there was collusion. There is ample evidence of collusion. Let's not forget about Roger Stone. How much did they giv ethe Trump campaign? The inauguration fund? hell they sent @MichaelCohen212 some money to the Trump shell account.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI Look how many people have to be involved to do something like that. That is a conspiracy against this nation.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI Whoever did it is a cyber terrorist. Whoever paid them to do it is also responsible. Whoever sought to purchase or make an exchange to receive the stolen emails is also a criminal..... NO?
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law When is the last time you needed EVIDENCE to investigate? If you can tell me there is NO reason to investigate Russia AND Trump you are lying through your teeth! I bet you can't wait to welcome Putin to the United States for Impeachment Summit #2! / #liar
@psychdr100 These people covertly still espouse a brutal and murderous culture. If anything they are the ones not worthy to be American citizens.
@psychdr100 The Founders made clear that slavery was a norm of that time period, but programmed language that questioned its existence, and prepared a future without slavery.
@psychdr100 Racism, particularly the point where people of different cultures stop working together and instead work against one another, is humanity at its worst. America is about striving to perfect ourselves as humans and as a diverse onerous society- world even. #EPluribusUnum
@psychdr100 Thats the way a racist sees it. They hate people of color. They feel people of color are less intelligent and less worthy as a whole. Yet they forget that all white people are not of the same race, they are not all intelligent, and many of them are unworthy beings. #simpleton
@Rambobiggs @Barnes_Law The landing?
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law Trump is not going to change our government into an open kleptocracy.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law Trump and his goons are grossly indebt to these people. People like Trump are slimeballs. He is only thinking about himself. He is intent on lying all the way through this. And that is a bad idea. YOUUU KNOW they keep lying. It is a tell tale sign.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law Russia is a kleptocracy. Putin and oligarchs are spending money stolen from Russian citizens to further their personal economic interests, to weaken our government, to infiltrate our government, advance their position in the World Order, and assault American/Western values.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law https://t.co/7gvrwyG3We Trump IS NOT going to make it through this. People must learn that the temptation of money from foreign governments should never PIT Americans against one another. In times of crisis. We are all Americans First. https://t.co/7gvrwyG3We
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI Listen. I take national security seriously. The rest of the country does too. This is America against our attackers and those who colluded with them. Choose a side. WISELY.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law I urge you to recognize all of the people around the country protesting any obstruction attempts......... I want you recognize that Trump's impeachment is IMMINENT.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI She was not charged with anything.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI There is evidence that Russia attacked us and still is attacking us...‚Ä¶.. That is the central purpose of the probe...‚Ä¶ If you want that stopped then we have nothing to discuss. You are an enemy of the United states of America.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI Guilty of what?
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @FBI She was investigated already during the Trump administration......
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @CNN @MSNBC There are sealed indictments that have not been revealed. Where is the leak?
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @CNN @MSNBC Nobody KNOWs what Mueller is doing!
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law @CNN @MSNBC So what would you suggest. Stop the Mueller Probe???
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law Mueller's investigation IS NOT political. Midterms and such are irrelevant. He is investigating crimes where America was injured by hostile foreign actors, POSSIBLY with the collusion of the Trump campaign. Not playing politics. Not playing ANY games.
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law Send Mueller the evidence...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. you guys think this is a hoax too. The @fbi does not play games! If they charge you with something or even officially investigate THEY HAVE YOU BY THE NECK!
@yzerwing @Barnes_Law Well.... you just hold on to that thought...‚Ä¶ I whole heartedly disagree. I believe their is evidence of collusion, obstruction, election fraud, bribery, and violations of the Emoluments Clause...
@theycallmebread That is an untenable situation. Democrats and Republicans will not tolerate any MORE obstruction. https://t.co/7gvrwyG3We
@theycallmebread #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw om America. That's something that you guys keep forgetting. While Trump may call the investigation and Russia's attack a hoax. NO BODY in America believes him. Not even Trump supporters. They just support him even if he did wrong.
@theycallmebread The President is also prohibited by law from firing law enforcement officials in order to obstruct justice or an ongoing investigation, especially an investigation where he is a subject. An investigation that has national security and impeachment implications.
@Barnes_Law Yeah, but Trump caused the vacancy to decide who will obstruct the investigation into Russia's terrorist attack on our electoral process- that Trump ironically calls a hoax because he is guilty of colluding with their efforts. #NobodyIsAboveTheLaw

@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump No. The FISA Warrant was based on Carter Page being an advisor to the Russian government AND a Fireign Policy Advisor for the Trump campaign as Russia's attack on the 2016 Presidential election was becoming evident.
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Because of his connections to what and who? Those conections continue. That's why the FBI investigated him. No one is fooled here. You guys are trying to put listick on a pig.
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Btw @carterwpage was intercepted talking to @DevinNunes telling him who Putin chose for Secretary of State over Trump's personal pick.......
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump In the course of just doing his dang job. The person under investigation certainly can;t call the shots. because at the end of the day it is criminal to accuse the FBI or DOJ of ANYTHING. THEY ARE AT FAULT! RUSSIA ATTACKED OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS AND TRUMP COLLUDED WITH THEM.
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump Sessions recused himself so he wouldn't have to lie about plans to remove sanctions. The same thing that got Flynn caught up. Sessions had 2 meetings with Kislyak about sanctions. The second one was while under surveillance. . .
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump But everything in the document has been verified. Far enough for people to stop questioning it. The crux of the doc said Russia was hacking, infiltrating U.S. government, and running propaganda campaigns targeting Americans and that Carter Page was a go between.
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump According to @carterwpage he is just on a leave of absence until this whole fake Russian probe mess settles down...................................................................................................
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump He was fired from the campaign for being a Russian spy. After learning his trip to Moscow alerted the @FBI. He continued his trips to Moscow &amp; his work with Trump campaign. He was the first to announce Rext Tillerson. He informed Devin Nunes of who Putin wanted for Sec. of State.
@RUTHLESSSNIP3R @cindy_uzzell @SaraCarterDC @realDonaldTrump #Flynn #Cohen #Manafort #Gates #Papadopoulos They were there. They plead guilty to what you say never happened. They say they colluded. They say Trump and the Trump campaign team colluded. Read their Statement of Offenses...

@MarkYoungTruth @realDonaldTrump This is how you know you are delusional.
