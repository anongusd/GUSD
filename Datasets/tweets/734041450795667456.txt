@ak_square9 One in the same, my point is still valid.
@ak_square9 See I’m referring to Alexander not Alexander III, his descendant.
@ak_square9 I’m going to leave our conversation here and simply ask you to further your thinking, Have a nice day 💕
@ak_square9 A niece or something you might say 🤷🏽‍♀️
@ak_square9 So do you not understand that there have been several Alexander the Greats and Cleopatras. The first Alexander the Great and the first Cleopatra were siblings. The ones with Roman numerals after their names were descendants. Roman numerals were used because they are greek descent
@ak_square9 You realize Alexander the Great was born 356 because...
@ak_square9 Nope, history taught us the right facts but with the wrong dates‼️
@ak_square9 Cleopatra had a son named Caesarion correct? Right. He took over her empire and position in dynasty and after her death. https://t.co/TpOb4aVNxS
@ak_square9 why don’t you start there and do some research❗️
