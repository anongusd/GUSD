@senatemajldr "The American people are not clamoring for more aliens with criminal backgrounds to be roaming at large in their communities. And they certainly are not so eager for that outcome that they want another partial shutdown in order to achieve it."
@senatemajldr "No administration, of any party, would sign a bill that forced them to release criminal aliens into the interior of the United States. No administration would accept this poison pill forcing the release of criminals now, and on a rolling basis going forward."
@senatemajldr "It‚Äôs hard to believe that this 'Abolish ICE' fringe among House Democrats actually thinks enforcing our laws is wrong. It‚Äôs hard to believe a group of House Democrats see kneecapping American law enforcement as a higher priority than keeping the government open."
@senatemajldr "It‚Äôs hard to believe, that this is where some Democrats are: a get-out-of-jail-free card for criminals because the radical left doesn‚Äôt like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement."
@senatemajldr "The consequence of such an arbitrary limit is obvious: Thousands of criminal aliens would simply be released into the interior of our country, both immediately and then on a rolling basis."
@senatemajldr "A limit that is not based on any aspect of reality, such as how many criminal aliens there actually are, or what crimes they have committed -- just an arbitrary number a couple of lawmakers have pulled out of thin air."

@senatemajldr @POTUS Senate to Vote Today on Compromise to End Government Shutdown	https://t.co/P3XeukI4kM
@senatemajldr @POTUS Only one bill does all the bipartisan things I‚Äôve discussed.		Only one bill has any chance of becoming law.		Let‚Äôs vote for it.
@senatemajldr @POTUS Today, we‚Äôll decide whether we turn a new corner and begin putting the last month behind us, or whether we will all continue to show up for work, stuck in exactly the same situation.
@senatemajldr @POTUS The American people will see plainly which senators want to make a law and clean up this mess, and which senators are content to continue making political points and nothing else.		Making law versus making points. That‚Äôs the choice.
@senatemajldr @POTUS That‚Äôs what this law provides. The border security we need plus actual, statutory authorization for DACA recipients -- written in law, for the first time. Not the unilateral hand-waving of the Obama administration.
@senatemajldr So these commonsense physical barriers were a bipartisan point of agreement until about 5 mins ago. But the @POTUS went even further to win Democrats‚Äô support. For example, his proposal also provides for 3-year legal status for certain individuals currently covered by DACA &amp; TPS.
@senatemajldr Like the barriers in which many of my Democratic colleagues happily voted to invest billions of dollars during just the last Congress.
@senatemajldr Barriers like the ones that the current Democratic Leader joined then-Senators Obama, Biden, and Clinton in supporting back in 2006.		Like the barriers constructed by President Obama‚Äôs own administration.
@senatemajldr And it would direct about one one-thousandth of federal discretionary spending for physical barriers along the highest-priority sections of the border.
@senatemajldr Well, if they agree with the need, they should agree with this modest proposal. 		It would fund new enforcement and surveillance technologies, recruiting and training hundreds of new Border Patrol agents‚Ä¶
@senatemajldr ‚ÄúCertainly, you need barriers. And we support barriers,‚Äù said another. 		Not to be outdone, a third said, quote, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge advocate of border security.‚Äù
@senatemajldr The need for more security on our border is not a partisan invention. It is a fact. It‚Äôs a reality most Senate Democrats readily admit. 		‚ÄúI‚Äôm willing to support more border security,‚Äù said one.
@senatemajldr This legislation provides the resources that the men and women who risk their own safety to defend our border tell us are necessary.

@SenateMajLdr The way the bills would assist families and communities across #Kentucky are practically countless. And the same is true for every state.
It also contains a provision @SenateMajLdr secured directing the Department of Housing and Urban Development to encourage more access to transitional housing opportunities for individuals recovering from substance abuse disorder
And more help for the Kentuckians who battle the scourge of #opioids every day. This legislation funds the FDA‚Äôs efforts to intercept illegal drugs, the DEA‚Äôs program for high-intensity trafficking areas, and increased training for first responders.
More funding and a sharper federal focus on controlling the invasive Asian carp that threaten local prosperity and water safety in Kentucky Lake and Lake Barkley in western #Kentucky.
More funding for the Abandoned Mine Land pilot program that helps communities reclaim abandoned coal mines and put that land to better use.
Another $1 billion in grants to help communities invest in highways, bridges, and other infrastructure projects -- with a guarantee that 30 percent of this funding would go to rural areas.
For #Kentucky: $37 billion toward rural development, including support for rural businesses, and loans and grants to improve rural infrastructure for electricity, telephone, and broadband internet in communities in Kentucky and across the country. https://t.co/FrZnbNI1xx

If socialists had their way, we'd have no borders and no security	https://t.co/nn3reqDjSR
I will fight for a safe and secure America, one with strong borders and strong law enforcement to protect our children from cartels, traffickers and gangs. And like you, I will not be intimidated.		@SenateMajLdr op-ed: https://t.co/n4ItSv1jdz
As Senate Majority Leader, I will continue to stand against socialists and the extreme-left who yell to ‚ÄúAbolish ICE.‚Äù
As an avid supporter of the First Amendment, I fully believe everyone has the right to peacefully protest and to express their opinions. But that won‚Äôt stop me from defending the views of the vast majority of Kentuckians who want reasonable and effective border security
Instead of articulating the practical effects of their radical beliefs, they are attempting to intimidate public officials &amp; to denigrate the integrity of our nation‚Äôs law enforcement officers. They stage ridiculous scenes to get media attention&amp;advance their socialist propaganda
While radical left might think their ‚ÄúAbolish ICE‚Äù slogan looks good on bumper sticker or homemade sign, the real-world consequences of doing away w/this law enforcement agency certainly doesn‚Äôt make sense to #Kentucky families who value the importance of security at our borders
Our state and local law enforcement system would lack the resources to effectively prevent terrorists and criminals from walking into our country to commit heinous crimes against our families. Put simply: without borders, there can be no security.
@ICEgov If these self-described socialists had their way, we would have no immigration laws and our borders would be meaningless. The result would effectively erase our national boundaries and destroy the principles of law and order.
@ICEgov Clearly, @ICEgov continues to serve a critical function for our national security. Its brave agents deserve our respect. I strongly support ICE as part of our commitment to public safety and to a legal system of immigration.
The danger to our families &amp; our vulnerable communities is very real. In a single 12-month period, @ICEgov seized nearly $1M pounds of narcotics, arrested individuals accused of more than 5,000 sex crimes &amp; captured more than 4,000 suspected gang members	https://t.co/n4ItSv1jdz
.@SenateMajLdr McConnell tasks Banking, Foreign Relations Committees with Holding Hearings on Russian Sanctions Law	https://t.co/ek3f6JNiGr
ICE was established after 9/11 to protect our homeland. The law enforcement agency‚Äôs brave men and women defend this country and our citizens every single day against criminal aliens, drug cartels, gang members and sex traffickers.
Now it seems these socialist groups are adding new and dangerous immigration proposals to their already terrible economic policies. In particular, they are calling to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
A socialist forcibly denies an individual‚Äôs rights,property &amp;money in their wallet in favor of the group. These ideas have failed every time &amp;the 20th century is filled w/their results: horrific poverty, countless deaths &amp; complete loss of personal freedom	https://t.co/n4ItSv1jdz
