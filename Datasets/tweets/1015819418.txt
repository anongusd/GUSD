@WalshFreedom Joe,  anyone who is looking for "free" college education is not worrying about how to pay for it.  They actually believe it is free.  This is a sad statement about the state-run education system that our kids have such a poor understanding of economics.
@WalshFreedom the BIG deal here is that unelected bureaucrats think that they have both the power and the obligation to remove a duly elected President from office.  If they had evidence of him being an agent of a foreign power, then there is a political process for dealing with it.
@AIIAmericanGirI @TwitchyTeam Looks to me like she took some time to rationalize her actions and provide an ‚Äú apology‚Äù for doing what she now says was right after all.  In other words, no apology, a justification.  Not impressed,  just more of the same.
