The association of the coverterm ‚ÄúSection 31‚Äù with Starfleet Intelligence is SECRET/NOFORN.  Further details, please see the (TS/NF) Classification Guide for Section 31 Task Force Operations.

I highly doubt it was the US because Turkey is controlling the release of the information.  i don‚Äôt doubt that we have embassies wired up elsewhere.  Details today make it seem like a bug was hidden in the office of the chief consular officer.
Might have also been the US or the British or, really, any strong intel service.  We forget that bugging embassies of strategic partners in foreign capitals is basic SIGINT tradecraft. NSA‚Äôs Musketeer unit makes an art of doing this. CIA‚Äôs CLANSIG program does similar things.
Assuming that the Turkish NIO had a SIGINT close access / RF endpoint inside the Saudi consulate...and that the Apple Watch story was floated initially to protect that perishable source of intelligence. In layperson‚Äôs terms, Turkey (maybe an ally) had the consulate wired/bugged.

Require 15 minutes for targeting and the various interceptors (Fighters, UAVs, even off-shore subs)  we have at various bases in South Korea can get targeting telemetry much more quickly. But that‚Äôs not a secret.

"If you order your SecDef to kill someone in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack, and he ignores your order, do you think he has acted illegally or outside the chain of command? Or is he disregarding an illegal order?"
Even this:  "Do you think it was appropriate for President Trump's senior staff to openly or covertly work to undermine his authority?  Was the level of civic emergency sufficient to justify quasi/para/illegal or unethical action by political appointees?"
Also:  what accountability mechanisms will you put in place for yourself and for your staff -- how will you ensure that your staff is carrying out your decisions?  And what degree of debate is acceptable to you?  What's your deliberative process like?
In any event, let's take this opportunity to start asking questions of people who want to be the next president: should ONE person alone have the authority to order a nuclear strike?
If history is unkind to the President, I do not think history will be kind to political appointees in senior positions who worked for him beyond a certain, very early point in his presidency, even if they stood athwart Trumpism and yelled stop.
So, the universe of truly "senior" White House officials is very small. Like, less than a dozen.  And there is AI out there that can compare writing samples pretty well.  So, I don't know how anonymous this anonymous person will be for long.  'CC: https://t.co/9bGV8lF3su

@LizMair I know you‚Äôre not arguing for this; and I‚Äôm not arguing in favor of disregarding immigration laws either.  I‚Äôm just saying.  This ain‚Äôt  small potatoes.  It‚Äôs a big..fat field of pasta.
Not the response. The excuse. (And the effect of one specific person violating  immigration rules is orders of magnitude less catastrophic than the effect of this violation by one specific person.) https://t.co/qQckAyEB7U
And how my saying this somehow betrays an anti-Trump bias rather than a straight-forwarding account of the stakes ‚Äî is, I guess, on the conscience of people who somehow intuit that.
I don‚Äôt care about the sex or the affairs.  Neither should you.  But what possible rational can you give for not caring about or dismissing a willful violation of federal law, one designed to deceive millions of people?
Campaign finance law violations aren‚Äôt seen as major crimes.   Often they aren‚Äôt. But sometimes they are. It really freaking does matter how politicians and those running for office are held accountable.
And the fact that no (not even Flake, McCain) elected Republican will say that, hey, maybe the President should resign because of this law-breaking - is astounding.  Cohen says Trump willfully broke the law to win the election. https://t.co/eklaeb8hPw

If you are ex @RepMikeRogers ‚Äî ex-FBI, a Republican to his maw, a good and decent man, a former HPSCI chair, his tenure not without controversy (no one‚Äôs was), but generally well respected and tough, tonight you gotta just weep. Tomorrow, I assume, he‚Äôs going to fight.
Here is my bias: I want a strong HPSCI to hold the executive branch accountable for its considerable secret powers to gather and exploit secret information, often with literally lethal results.  I also care when a member of Congress admits to using his powers to obstruct justice.
And yes ‚Äî politicians talk frankly at fundraisers. Often they cop to mixed motivations. Partisanship is one and it can be noble.  But here, it is not. It is simply the exact opposite of what‚Äôs in the public interest REGARDLESS of your view of the Mueller investigation.

Well, @LannyDavis is now saying that Rudy Giuliani lied. (And Cuomo points out that Giuliani has claimed that it was COHEN who suggested that cash be paid.) Clearly, the tape has Trump mentioning "cash" in some context, and Cohen vigorously saying -- "No no no no!" #TrumpTapes https://t.co/6LWIG0EujF
So, the "shouldn't pay with" [cash] is the new "assume why Russia [wouldn't]."  And just as in Helsinki, the context really does favor one interpretation over the other.  The words Trump speaks really are hard to hear, though. #TrumpTapes
Well, @LannyDavis is really leaving heavily on the "Nixon couldn't dispute the meaning of the tapes..." thing.
.@realDonaldTrump on tape:  "What financing?" Cohen: We'll have to pay."  Trump: [unintelligible] ... cash.  Cohen: "No, no, no, no."  #TrumpTapes  (POTUS's team says he said "[Do not pay with] cash.")

It was the moral principle for him that amplified US power and allowed the US a greater say in determining our collective defensive posture.  And he was never under any illusion about the magnitude of the threat to Europe from the USSR.
Germany has always used its reliance on Russia for gas to maintain some independence from the rest of Europe.  But Reagan never ever waivered, not once, in his commitment to defend NATO from attacks.  And he took the US‚Äôs (over) burden sharing as a point of pride.
Energy diplomacy between Europe and Russia is a longstanding complication ; remember US sanctions against a Soviet gas pipeline after the Polish martial law crisis, leading to a row between Reagan and NATO...Reagan, under the guise of Shultz, ultimately lifted the sanctions.

I know there's some history -- like when Jimmy Carter broke relations with Taiwan in 1979 -- but has the Supreme Court ruled on a case like this? Any constitutional scholar want to weigh in?  If Trump unilaterally wants to pull out, can he?
So: NATO was ratified by the Senate and signed into law by Truman. I know (or have been told) that presidential prerogatives to abrogate treaties is a grey area. Interesting q: would Kavanaugh on the bench say that Congress itself must negate the treaties it approved?
Can't predict what @POTUS may or may say about NATO, but military-to-military relations between its countries are strong (and growing stronger), and extricating the U.S. from NATO would require Brexit-like gymnastics that Trump alone cannot execute. See: https://t.co/lj9UiKqZSe

I understand that POTUS‚Äôs view of foreign entanglements is transactional. Ok.

NATO unity was no sure thing, even in 1983, but Reagan knew how important it was to project a unified posture, to involve allies and court them, and to understand the threat of war from their perspective.
BTW: Reagan did not EVER want a summit for the sake of a summit even though he impulsively (I mean this as a compliment) wanted to use his political skills to convince Russia that he meant no harm. He rejected summits for their own sake and insisted on deliverables.
and the US has still obligations to defend NATO from aggression. Those will outlast this President. In the Baltics. In Crimea. In Britain, even.
Huge differences between now/then: Trump has an affinity for Russia/Putin and is hostile (!) to NATO. But both countries rampaging forward with nuclear modernization. Arsenals get more deadly. Trigger fingers, more itchy. Decision/deliberation are subordinate to hasty responses.
Real brinksmanship was the result of a mismatch between his political objectives and the unrelenting machine that the nuclear command and control system (and its priests at the time) had put together.  Aligning the two and building domestic support for treaties was the hard part.
There are similarities between Reagan and @realDonaldTrump - and significant differences, too.  Reagan prepared, hard, and continuously and ceaselessly (if imperfectly executed) sought to understand  what the USSR truly feared and needed from arms control agreements.
The reviews have been humbling.  The book shows how Reagan figured out how to handle the Soviets without compromising his principles, how spies telling truths saved the day, how intelligence and diplomacy mattered and why we must pay urgent attention (even today) to nuke cmd/ctrl

... develop more information about the potential violation of the law.  I could be wrong. (I'm often wrong!)  But ... do we have ANY information or indication to suggest that the Cambridge prof was ever "inside" the Trump campaign in any way?
So -- if the FBI developed a suspicion that people inside Trump's campaign (but not Trump itself) were improperly encouraging Russia to use its influence to sabotage the campaign, DURING THE CAMPAIGN, using an informant outside the campaign would be the safest way to attempt to
Turn it around. Let's say that a Clinton campaign consultant discovered some of the missing e-mails...knew that the FBI was looking for them...  wouldn't that consultant have a duty to tell the FBI?
If an actual "inside" source -- let's say... a consultant or vendor or employee -- believed he witnessed or was privy to potentially illegal behavior and didn't trust his bosses, then going to the FBI would be the correct thing to do... morally, ethically, legally.
Someone who develops information "about" the campaign but who isn't affiliated with the campaign... is not a source inside the campaign.  It's a source, or an informant.  There's no snitching.  BUT (part II)... think of this scenario...
Here's what I mean. If the source was "inside" the campaign, that means he (a) was paid by the campaign or vendor, (b) was publicly affiliated with the campaign, or (c) was affiliated with the campaign privately but in such a way that the campaign claimed his as one of their own
I don't know enough facts to have a fully-formed opinion on what to make of the FBI's use of an informant -- identified as a Cambridge prof -- to gather information about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. BUT -- I do know that, from the outset, prepositions matter.

State Department experts are essential. Good intelligence is critical.
Other diplomatic tracks (2.0, 3.0, 3.5) keep the traffic moving even when the principal figures are at odds.
There is no substitute for presidents talking to presidents.  (Trump intuits this already).  Regardless of what happens in June, he must keep talking.
Two: Reagan spent years diligently working to understand exactly why the Soviet leadership believed as they did, and what they really wanted (and needed) from diplomacy.  Empathy mattered.
One: patience.  Breakthroughs come often when all other options have been exhausted and interests have been negotiated to death... not at the outset of a diplomatic foray.

@jamesgramwilson Nonsense. It‚Äôs essential.
Even after the Bay of Pigs, JFK used the CIA judiciously to effect foreign policy, not just to gather intelligence. He outsourced covert ops to RFK, who ran wild with them.
I will say: as wary of military intervention and a standing army as he was, Eisenhower became the first of (every) President to fetishize the use of the CIA (tiny footprint, secret agency) to deal with enormously complex foreign policy challenges.
And we began with Eisenhower‚Äôs farewell address, which I still think is the best (and most honest) presidential speech of the past 70 years for the way it soberly predicted the future and acknowledged hard truths. #ascj

With some redactions for sources and methods, it does seem like this would be the most  prudent course if the Nunes memo is released.  As much as I highly doubt that a FISA order targeting an individual would ever be declassified, my high doubts have no weight in this world. https://t.co/H8fBxqlO01
@davidfrum In the fullness of time.
While they‚Äôre at it, maybe HPSCI can release a memo about how the FBI  uses NSLs to obtain metadata to help DOJ track down journalists‚Äô sources in leak investigations.  (Since we‚Äôre now apparently allowed to use classified info as a weapon for our own parochial purposes.)
@Juliedes Makes my head hurt.
@wildmoon Seems that way
Because ... with a public release, the FISC is gonna see the crimped revised redacted version.... and thus get the same level of partial truth as everyone else.  Unless it sees the full memo.  Which is easily arranged.  And much more responsible.
Can anyone who supports #releasethememo explain how releasing it unredacted to the FISC wouldn‚Äôt have the desired outcome of alerting FISC to potential FISA process shenanigans?  And how releasing publicly _would_?
It‚Äôs not oversight. It‚Äôs nihilism. Back writing for @TheWeek! https://t.co/Lu5NHm5266

Seriously. Just show the FISC the memo and be done with it.  #releasethememonowtotheFISConly
That would solve @DevinNunes concerns most elegantly, I think.   And it would preserve other institutions worth preserving. Just a thought.  So -- new hashtag: #ReleaseTheMemoOnlyToTheFISCNow!
I mean, I know the answer.  But... the germ of truth at the center of this nihilism is a claim that a FISA order package was intentionally misleading. The FISC is in the best position to punish the FBI if so. They can DENY THE DAMN ORDERS.
So ... why not #releasethememo to the FISC and let the FISC decide if it, indeed, has been misled. That way, justice can be served (if it needs to be), the FISC can adjust its approval policies, and classified info can be protected.
I just published ‚ÄúNational Security Reporting (And Its Enemies)‚Äù https://t.co/EvHp36182P
And don‚Äôt lose faith ... still worth  being judicious with this stuff even when most people who comment and amplify it will not care about nuance.
Had a very robust debate in my nat sec reporting class about how we‚Äôd report on the contens of the Nunes memo.  A balance: don‚Äôt be a pawn, protect legit classified info,   recognize real interests, be precise, be wary of  how platforms will distort the necessary nuances.  #ascj
Don‚Äôt oppose Congress using its political independence to insist on a better FISA process &amp; to hold the FBI (a potent institution) accountable.  Be aghast when part of one party employs this power indiscriminately , nihilistically,  &amp; obsequiously to target political enemies.
Actually, one quasi-alternative is activist mayors and governors grabbing more power and making more decisions.  Might produce some good policy; it will even further weaken the federal system.

Apparently: (1)  no one thought to creating a ‚Äúwhoops, stand down‚Äù template.  (2) Hawaii‚Äôs emergency managers needed FEMA permission to use audio / loudspeakers to call off the alert (and this took 30 minutes).  (3) secondary entry points (TV, radio) didn‚Äôt get the cancellation.

@perryworldhouse Litwak: North Korea views external threats as a challenge to regime survival (and not as a pathway to global acceptance).
@perryworldhouse If the world poses an existential threat to Kim, or bases its policy on that sensibility, it follows that he will react rather strongly.
@perryworldhouse Which sends a signal that the US is much less flexible than the executive branch intends it to be. @KelseyDav‚Äôs insight.
@perryworldhouse Panelists say that Congressional action often undercuts and constraints presidential decision making. Sanctions are too binding.
@perryworldhouse He also points out the degree to which DPRK plays US and China off each other.  Like a fiddle.

Before anyone speaks to a member of the press and wants to try to use one of these conditions, it's best to agree on definitions up front.
As you can see, sources, reporters and writers have different definitions. Some of them are absurd.
Off the record: the dumbest one, because we're supposed to hear stuff and NEVER use it. Which is impossible, because our brains collect it.
Deep background: reportable, but not attributable to any source; (good reporters will verify facts independently).
On background: attributed to a source by title/position/proximity to fact in question, but not named or identified. E.g., "A U.S. official."

Wonder if @ScottAdamsSays will see these  Trump Tweets as an example of value "pacing" or him extending a first negotiating proposition.
The willful vitiation of dignity, not to mention a norm, here expressed by @realDonaldTrump qualifies as a major story regardless.
While I know there will be a disjunction in how elites and non-elites assess news coverage of this issue,
My personal sympathies lie with the trans troops. Politically, I think health care is a bigger story, and it affects more Americans. And
Even House GOPers didn't propose kicking these folks out.
Who, before today, certainly had lots of worries and concerns, but were mostly protected from separation.
Without realizing it (I think?) Trump has just announced and ordered his military to kick out 14-15,000 actively serving troops.
The SecDef does not want to kick out actively serving trans people. So there will be a fight of some sort. https://t.co/uwS518EVhp

@washingtonpost But the Post's reporting suggests that the US certainly thinks the Russians know. And knew.
@washingtonpost Here's a legit concern: given the tiny chance the Russians didn't pick up on Trump's intel, with the story's publication, they will now.
@washingtonpost Yes, countries often protect their intelligence co-op with the US to spare them domestic tsuris, but this appears to be a different animal.
@washingtonpost If McMasters denies that -- and denies that he or Bossert called anyone about the information -- then we can say he "denied" the Post rpt.
@washingtonpost And that the source has a valid (perhaps) existential reason for it wanting the Russians to know it provides info about ISIS to the US,
@washingtonpost And that the information was specific enough to point to the identity of the source, which provided it to the US clandestinely.
@washingtonpost The charge, tl;dr, is that he revealed specific, non-public collateral info about a public plot that could only have come from a source

Doesn't bother me that Obama rakes in $$ for speeches to bankers.  It jars my sensibilities, but then again, so does Sense8 and Kombucha.
No party or entity has explained the realities of the present and the exigencies of the future. Forget post-truth.  We are post-narrative.
But populism feels like the more intuitive sell to people and it always will.
Maybe there isn't a case to be made, but the populists sure haven't made any headway in explaining how to build a sustainable economy either
The globalist wings of every party (everywhere) have utterly failed to make a convincing case to ordinary people about the future.
As @mattyglesias has written, Obama is a progressive, pro-government, pro-finance Democrat and should defend that space if he chooses.
He was never a populist and does not believe the party is well-served by catering to a caricature of populist interests.
Obama has the self-awareness to know why, in this turbulent, cross-party populist moment, it won't  help his or his party's brand; still, https://t.co/64mwpiiJLX

US CI/Counterespionage dragnet is formidable because CHI, RUS, etc attempts to read email/texts, listen to calls of US politicians are ubiq
Logical to assume one existed/exists for specific targets if FBI counterintelligence investigation necessitated it.
Chances that a FISA order existed/exists to capture domestic end of comms between foreign entries and some Trump advisers = ??? BUT...
Probability that the government in question was ours = Low. Probability that it was RUS, CHI, or even Israel = higher.
Probability that all types of comms of some Trump advisers working out of Trump Tower were monitored by some government entity = &gt;0.
Probability that Obama ordered Trump's phones = virtually 0%.

@joshtpm this is a conspiracy of bad decisions by people in power. Period.
Two bad narratives -- "the IC" is either saving or screwing the country now -- absolves @realDonaldTrump for decisions he has and will make.
Praise the CIA and NSA and FBI for being nimble collectors of foreign intelligence.  Anything else is conjecture and magical thinking atm. https://t.co/B6ToEX7K09
The CIA is collecting foreign intelligence. Policy makers are using it.  They're weaponizing it, if it's been weaponized here. https://t.co/B6ToEX7K09
But John -- they're not. I'm wagering that as many are infuriated by leaking raw FISA intercept as they (rightly) are by Flynn's conduct. https://t.co/B6ToEX7K09
Which they aren't. They're chasing a real story that bears directly on the national security of the country.   They didn't invent the calls. https://t.co/KvwQGCuzcj
Hey! California and the White House cooperated today, and it's a good thing. https://t.co/cQeUI2f6ed
So: who's in control? @realDonaldTrump. He alone is accountable for what happens in his White House.
Some Obama folks did have concerns about Flynn's views on Iran -- one reason they fired him -- but saw Mattis as a tempering influence.
Not supported (yet) by reason, sensibility, evidence, plausibility, and the unfolding of events as we know it.
I don't doubt some Obama folks are helping seed these stories -- though I have no inside info -- but the idea of an IC/Obama conspiracy is
Further still, the Obama administration did not seem panicked about the Iran deal falling apart. Netanyahu will prolly endorse it to Trump.
Further, the "IC" isn't leaking. The large, sprawling FBI-Justice-Congressional Committee nexus is a likelier culprit.
And I assume that some former Obama officials helped source some of these stories, probably to confirm details.
The IC was never in lockstep with Obama, so the idea that there's a grand conspiracy afoot isn't tenable.  But anti-Trump leakers? Yes. https://t.co/CDaROeWSES

@RadioFreeTom I can blind out the failings of my current world and want to leave to my children the garden I cultivate, knowing it will grow
@RadioFreeTom the irony for me is that it's the same heuristic that led me to believe that there was no way Hillary would lose the election
@RadioFreeTom isn't it just "I want the world to be like it is and was, and not be told that it HAS to change in ways that I can't fathom?"
I'm totally, totally in favor of this. @BillyTheMime should perform at the inauguration. https://t.co/MiKeGUxZoW
My source for the preceding Tweets is someone with direct knowledge of the briefing situation who wanted to clarify the matter in public.
The briefing, I'm told, will be heavy on facts and light on analysis. A direct request from Trump's team as to how he wants to be briefed.
@BradMossEsq yes.
The briefing @realDonaldTrump would have gotten last week will be the same one he'll get this week.  No conspiracy here.
A briefing was scheduled last week but one of the briefers -- a senior intelligence official -- had a family emergency. Briefing reskeded.
The classified report on Russian hacking will be given to the White House tomorrow. Hill will be briefed Thursday. @realDonaldTrump Friday.

Some will be immediately disruptive. This is one area where process journalism (how he makes decisions, who advises him) is essential.
Some of these pieces are the product of a longstanding calcified consensus that might not actually be in the best interest of the country.
Trump will break many pieces of china (pun slightly intended), intentionally, accidentally, or as a byproduct of his words and actions.
I understand why violating this shibboleth is dangerous. I also understand that Trump doesn't feel bound by almost any taboo.
"So, Trump and a democratically elected leader of a modern country talked and somehow that's supposed to made me mad and afraid?"

I speak only for myself, and not for  @USCAnnenberg. Except to say that, so far as the challenges being posed are formidable, they are ready
But there are a LOT of great experimental journalistic endeavors going on.  Some will fail. Others we will adopt as best practices.  #ascj.
I do think the media writ large is so easily gamed and manipulated, and entranced by memories of its former stature. That must change.
As a colleague reminded me, fake news launched the @Hearst empire. Titled news launched @FoxNews. Paternalism reigned supreme until the 90s.
Yes.  A lot of the polling wasn't off by that much, either. In some states, yes, but it captured the popular vote margin well. https://t.co/iNX9M6V9QF
So I'm hopeful.  The students here are up to the task.  Some of their insights blow me away.  #ascj
All ideas are on the table. No one at @USCAnnenberg I've spoken to has any illusions about the challenges (and opportunities).
All hands on deck.  Unflinching honesty about out strengths and weaknesses. And an understanding of how we are perceived as an institution.
And $$$$ spent on producing solid digital / social policy journalism and targeting it to the people affected by policy.
In the meantime, I'd like to see plain language over journalese, more transparency about how we do journalism, more content partnerships...
And incorporate insights from decision science, social psychology, history and political science into coverage models.  #ASCJ
I think reporters should report, and let this carnival continue around them; editors and publishers should experiment relentlessly.
That's why I don't think checklists are more than marginally useful. We know a lot about what's going on; it's still a tiny fraction.
And then the important but mundane: reliable business models for news. Ethics and fairness. Perceptions. Political tribalism.
And the challenge posed by Trump's information habits layers into this debate an existential threat to the function of public communication
Tilted news, strategic deception, ontological framing issues, the distinction between facts and truth, persuasion and beliefs... much harder
I'm sure I'll write on this at some point, but the "fake news" problem is the easiest of all the information ecology problems to solve.

@marcambinder this is ALL on Team Trump, btw. A shaky transition will probably hasten the departure from government of good civil servants

@zbyronwolf an election they "obviously lost" would preclude that
@ericgeller yes
I highly highly doubt they'd do that, so, if a candidate doesn't concede an election he (or she) obviously lost, it's (mostly) theatre.
So the legitimacy cascade is: GOP state election officials would somehow latch on to a candidate's refusal 2 concede &amp; delay certification.
It technically doesn't matter if a candidate refuses to concede...unless state officials refuse to certify votes &amp; electors are faithless.

@tmcgev @ErikWemple People read an e-mail &amp; thought Philippe Reines dictated a word to me, when the literal opposite was true.

@tmcgev @ErikWemple yes, but transparency will. Access to sources and building sources among powerful people often produces powerful, (1)
@LouBrandeis If they get to interview big and powerful people, I hope all of them. But probably not all of them.
@tmcgev @ErikWemple I've been the victim of selectively released e-mails before. :-)  As Erik knows well.
@LouBrandeis Good practice is to canvass widely, research thoroughly, and then winnow.  Bad practice is to just accept blindly.
@ErikWemple People perceive an elite coziness when we hide these things. We shouldn't hide them. We should be transparent about it.
@ErikWemple Almost every DC journo who regularly interviews/produces interviews does this. Shouldn't be something to hide.
@ErikWemple If a good source of potential questions is partisan, it's malpractice not to check in.
@ErikWemple Political journalism often makes mysteries out of basic reporting. This is broad canvassing, not being too cozy.
@ErikWemple But always canvassed colleagues, experts, too, and reconfirmed research.  And in the end, chose my  own questions.
@ErikWemple They've often got good research -- always needs to be checked and verified. I did this w/ both DNC and RNC, all POTUS campaigns
@ErikWemple When interviewing a major political figure, I would often canvass a lot of people, including oppo researchers, for questions.

But the Dems' biggest challenge is building a big bench and taking back state legislatures/state houses.
On trade (TPP), populism, primary process reform, expectations about what a president can do, foreign policy aggressiveness etc.
The Democratic Party has a lot of post-election convulsions to suffer through, too.
The pseudo-never-trumpers are the folks who hate him but have to support him because they'll lose their jobs/power if they dont
9) Even if Trump loses badly, I don't see big incentives for a reformist Frum/Lewis wing of the party to rise to power.
8) And deal with the demographic inversions that underlie much of Trump's appeal
7) And pressure for state GOPers to 'take power back' somehow....
6) There will still be significant pressure to obstruct/delay everything Clinton does....
5) The political consultant class (even those who made $$ off Trump) will focus on the Latino/women/educated voter/millennial drubbing...
(4) The Cruz/Jim Jordan wing will complain (as always) that Trump wasn't a real conservative &amp; that the only prudent course is a right turn
(3) There will be numerous attempts to clean house at the RNC by #nevertrumpers and psuedo-never trumpers
(2) And geographic sorting ensures they'll be competitive in House/Senate races for a while... but
(1) Where does the GOP go after the election? Their biggest upside is that their elected bench is much longer than the Dems...

.@JRubinBlogger Why a fool? He told Congress the case was closed and then said he'd update them if he had updates.  He has an update.
If true, then Comey's notification makes absolute sense from the basic perspective of doing his job faithfully. https://t.co/3GbmUHHOR6
Comey's being vague ... we assume (without any evidence) that he cares about what you (or I) think about his vagueness. Let's wait.
"Must be"... "something that would..."  Literally, just blindly reading into Comey's mind, which is profoundly illogical. https://t.co/hibtfLzwAR
4) His transparency allows all of his to question/interrogate his judgments, which wouldn't be possible were he not as transparent!
3) I'm sure his pronouncement has the Clinton team freaking out and questioning his motives, just as GOPers questioned his motives before
2) into election-year politics. He doesn't work for either campaign. He is accountable to POTUS, to Congress, to his agents &amp; to the public
1) I would rather an FBI director be as open and transparent as possible, all things considered, even if his doing so injects uncertainty
