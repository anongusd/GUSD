Vilsack: Since 1982, 72 million acres of farmland has been lost #AgCensus #AgOutlook
Vilsack: #FarmBill is a reform bill. The safety net kicks in when mother nature doesn't cooperate or prices drop.#AgOutlook
Agriculture Secretary Vilsack addressing crowd at #AgOutlook Forum.
Thanks to @FVCMichaelO, @Farm_Vet_Co, @NYFCNYFC, Joanna Carraway, Greg Wegis for a great panel discussion.
Vilsack: We are going to get relief to livestock producers in about 60 days. It usually takes 6-8 months. #AgOutlook
To help new/beginning farmers RT @mikejopek: @usdafsa Not all, but some farmers.
Vilsack: New #farmbill will provide more affordable crop insurance for young farmers. #AgOutlook
@FVCMichaelO O'Gorman There are several resources to help veterans get into this industry. @Farm_Vet_Co #AgOutlook
O'Gorman - We have helped double amputee vets farm @FVCMichaelO #AgOutlook
@NYFCNYFC Put the word out there for leasing/renting opportunities. Find a land trust org to help find retiring farmer to connect with.
Vilsack: How would a new #farmer go about finding land? #AgOutlook
@NYFCNYFC Biggest obstacle for new farmer...access to land, capital and training #AgOutlook
@415flan Excellent. Thank you.
Joanna Carraway: One big obstacle is that the margins are really tight. It's not about the money. It's about continuing to grow.
Vilsack: One year from now, what will a new farmer  (who started a year ago say was the biggest obstacle? #AgOutlook
@NYFCNYFC Getting kids in touch with a garden &amp; growing food is a good start. Show kids your passion for farming &amp; to be self employed.
Vilsack: How do you encourage urban children to go into farming? #AgOutlook
Joanna Carraway: There are so many opportunities to use a business degree and use it in ag. #AgOutlook
Vilsack: How do we convince a business major  whose family is in farming to return to the farm?
@Farm_Vet_Co We want vets to see other employment opportunities. Farming is more than just a one man/woman or two person operation....
@Farm_Vet_Co  #AgOutlook Ag is good because it can't be outsourced. There is a tremendous opportunity to enter in this field &amp; have success.
Vilsack moderating panel. First question: How convince veterans to go into farming?
Panelists include @Farm_Vet_Co, Greg Wegis, Joanna Carraway &amp; @NYFCNYFC. Young Farmers Unlimited Opportunities #AgOutlook
Second Panel Session about to begin on "Future of Agriculture" #AgOutlook
RT @usda: @pma: Build programs around childhood nutrition -- Continue to make decisions based on data, research. #AgOutlook
Panel Q's: What advice would you provide to Land Grant Univ President or the Secy of Ag?
Schickler: Estate planning, asset transfer must be discussed. Show kids they don't have to be on farm to play a major role in agriculture.
