@Comey Sounds like he had a nice life and a good home. Condolences.
@HacklerDevin Yay! I‚Äôm glad that we merely speaking past each other. :)
@HacklerDevin I assumed you knew or understood the terminology or labels used. Anti-vaxxers aren‚Äôt the ones getting sick. They‚Äôre individuals who promulgate myths and fears about vaccination that cause children not to get vaccinated and subsequently increase the likelihood of illness.
@HacklerDevin And to be painfully clear, an anti-vaxxer is a person who encourages people not to vaccinate their children or not follow vaccination schedules based on junk science, fear, etc. The victims are the ones getting sick and the communities vulnerable to those beliefs.
@HacklerDevin And no, the headline does not say that, nor does the article itself. The article discusses the role that anti-vaxxers play and the vulnerability of insular communities like the Orthodox Jewish community in New York City to the anti-vax movement. This is a preventable problem.
RT @ChelseaClinton: While it was officially #WorldKindnessDay yesterday, every day should be a day to practice kindness &amp; empathy https://t‚Ä¶
@HacklerDevin They are to blame for not providing preventative care.  You can expand that premise to any similar preventative care topic.
@HacklerDevin So, a parent or community that fails to inoculate their population from harm, is somehow not responsible when that harm happens?
@anniek_p You‚Äôre needed and appreciated for what you do. Thank you.
@HacklerDevin State and federal law has a bit more to say on the topic. https://t.co/vq0H619Vr5  I think that we at least agree that the primary purpose of adoption is to place children in safe and loving homes capable of long term care and support?
@HacklerDevin Final thought: Thanks to vaccines and advanced medical care, our society today is largely spared the horrors of diseases prevalent a century ago. As a result, we have in someways become complacent because we no longer see the risks or assume it can‚Äôt happen to us.
@HacklerDevin 2 of 2- or increase of otherwise preventable illnesses that further the reduces the protection of herd immunity for those that can legitimately not take vaccine, e.g., those compromised immune systems, the very young, etc.
@HacklerDevin 1 of 2 - Individuals or groups of people who irresponsibly choose not to vaccinate or follow vaccination protocols place both themselves and the larger community at risk. This article is not about blaming people getting sick, it instead seeks to draw attention to the the return..
