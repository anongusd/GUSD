Sen. Mazie Hirono notes that she asks every judicial nominee about their history of harassment, and adds that when it comes to harassment, "half the battle is people knowing what they can complain about."
Sen. Kennedy asks the director of the judiciary's administrative office how prevalent harassment in the judiciary is "on a scale of one to Harvey Weinstein."
"Can you be a major league pig? A minor league pig? A sometimes pig?" Sen. Kennedy asks a witness at this sexual harassment hearing, adding "You're still a pig."
And follows up by talking about Bill Clinton (this is a hearing on harassment in the judiciary)
Sen. Kennedy on #MeToo: "I think we have decided in the society that we don't want to be a culture of creepy old men, or creepy young men."
"If you get any flak for this, you let me know," Sen. Feinstein tells Jaime Santos. 		Last year, Santos wrote an open letter calling for better protections for law clerks against sexual harassment, which was signed by 700 clerks and professors.
At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on sexual harassment in the judiciary, Chairman Grassley thanks harassment victims who have come forward: "Speaking up against powerful judges in a system that doesn't always protect victims takes tremendous courage."
