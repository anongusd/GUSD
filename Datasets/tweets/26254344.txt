@AmesCG I think politicians and law enforcement will always say they are tough on crime but still support reducing mass incarceration. That actually proves the point that incarceration has nothing to do with crime.
Our take. Thread here üëáüèæ https://t.co/MyzauKhYzv
It‚Äôs definitely not the 40% reduction in the federal prison population recommended by our report. But it‚Äôs a good start.
All federal prisoners will be entitled to earn an extra 7 days per year off their sentence based on good behavior. Around 85 percent of the prison population ‚Äì more than 100,000 people ‚Äì will likely receive that benefit.
The Fair Sentencing Act retroactivity provision would make around 3,000 prisoners immediately eligible for a sentence reduction of 25 percent.
Our analysis of the impact of the compromise. 1) The new sentencing provisions, carried over from the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, would reduce the sentences of a little over 2,000 people every year in perpetuity.
@johnson_carrie @Xcathdra Right. I think it was Kushner Grassley Kochs plus law enforcement and beating the Democrats on what should be an issue they own.

The only reason we got a Senate compromise is because of Grassley and Durbin, one of the few Dems to prioritize this.
It‚Äôs embarrassing that Kushner Grassley and Trump are going to be the champions for sentencing reform.
If Dems hold out, it won‚Äôt be for a bigger step to end mass incarceration. It will be because they believe *other* issues are a bigger priority.
I‚Äôm baffled why everyone assumes Dems will hold out for a more aggressive bill. They passed the original First Step in the House no problem - even though we begged them to hold the line on sentencing.

That being said, thank you to the 56 democrats who voted against, refusing to compromise for political points. We now have a roll call vote for those in the House on who is for serious reform and not band-aids.
The #FIRSTSTEPAct passes with overwhelming support, 360 - 58 (56 Dems opposed, 2 Republicans). We still think it is too weak a bill, but hopefully in the Senate we can improve it or get some assurance that a followup bill will be considered.
I‚Äôll end with this: The mission of the Brennan Center is to end mass incarceration. Making life for the incarcerated easier is good but getting people out of prison is our goal. Unfortunately, this bill falls short of that standard.
Nadler ends that "in spite of the good intentions of this bill... the approval would lessen the odds of sentencing reform and so the negatives outweigh the positives of this bill." Yes.
He says ending mass inc will require sustained effort and a meaningful first step. We agree. Where we disagree is that I don't think this bill isn't a meaningful first step toward ending mass incarceration.
Jefferies speaks now. He says the #FIRSTSTEPAct will give those who are incarcerated a chance at improving their lives. "why would we opposed that now? Any objective view of the bill would see that it would improve their lives now."
Look Collins, we'd be a lot more likely to go along with you if you also introduced SRCA in the House. If you're serious about helping the incarcerated, you'll do that tomorrow. Call it the Next Step Act. Guarantee you'd pick up votes.
Collins asks us to vote for incarcerated families, ignoring that his bill does little to make them incarcerated them. He continues to create false dichotomies.
"To the bill's detractors, I say 'why not? Is it ever good enough?'" Uh, yeah. SRCA was good enough. It was a compromise too! Why do supporters of the #FIRSTSTEPAct simply forget that our opposition is based on a better alternative?
Collins asks Holder "where were you?... Easy to write an op-ed, a lot harder to do that job." A serious attack on the former attorney general. IMO, seriously overlooks all the good Holder did while in office.
Collins adds that he wants to see sentencing reform too. Weird that his own bill doesn't have it.
Collins, a sponsor, outlines the other side: This isn't a perfect bill, but it provides some solutions. This is progress. "This is saying no to a family member in prison who could get treatment. Is that ok?"
Nadler outlines the key arguments against the bill. There's no sentencing reform. Certain components could be harmful given the current racially biased structure of the criminal justice system. Therefore, despite some positive reforms, it falls short.
Floor speeches on the #FIRSTSTEPAct are starting now. I'll be live tweeting thoughts on this thread.

Thank you @SenatorDurbin @KamalaHarris  @CoreyBooker @SheilaJacksonLe @JohnLewis @ChuckGrassley for standing up for the rights of incarcerated people. The White House bill is not half a loaf; it's a crumb. The bipartisan compromise supported by a majority of Congress is the SRCA.
"Congress should pass the Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, which has significant bipartisan support."
The White House's offered prison reform bill is ‚Äúnot a step forward.‚Äù ‚ÄúPrison reform will fail without sentencing reform.‚Äù
"Congress‚Äôs job is to make the laws and the AG‚Äôs job is to enforce them. In contrast, Chuck Grassley as Chariman of Senate Judiciary has a significant role to play.‚Äù Oh snap.
‚ÄúWe have heard some argue that Congress should pass this narrow prison reform bill, rather than sentencing reform because Sessions opposed sentencing reform. This argument does not withstanding scrutiny."
Finally! Dems speak out vocally against the White House's efforts to kill sentencing reform. Letter from Durbin, Booker, Harris, Jackson Lee, and John Lewis just circulated to all members of Congress.
@TheRachelBloom @vanitaguptaCR Wow. When we were writing that report, a friend told me she didn‚Äôt have any sympathy for such prisoners - but then she saw our photos of them and changed her mind.

Making prison a less worse place to live isn‚Äôt going to end mass incarceration. And electing new prosecutors one by one isn‚Äôt going to do it either. We need to change the laws.
.@ChuckGrassley and @SenatorDurbin should introduce a bill called ‚Äúthe Next Step Act‚Äù with strong bipartisan sentencing reform.
Anyone who thinks Donald Trump didn‚Äôt affect the movement for criminal justice reform is out to lunch. I certainly hope we don‚Äôt see states following suit, changing from sentencing and real reform to prison conditions reforms.
Thanks to @RepJayapal @JacksonLeeTX18 @RepRaskin @RepJerryNadler for standing up for ending mass incarceration today.
There is one reason for this: Jeff Sessions. He killed sentencing reform in 2016 despite everyone else wanting it. He‚Äôs trying to kill it again. And Congress is bending to meet him.
Its provisions in practice won‚Äôt really let people out. It just merely improves prisoners‚Äô conditions from disgustingly horrific to horrific. States across the country have passed far better reforms. Even the reddest ones - Kentucky Texas Oklahoma Louisiana.
If today‚Äôs bill is really the best Congress can do to end mass incarceration, then voters should know that, and cast their ballots accordingly.
I‚Äôm confused why Dems think the WH is dealing in good faith on this ‚Äúprison reform‚Äù bill when it‚Äôs public that Sessions hates it and is lobbying against it.  https://t.co/8gZAzSzCuj
Perhaps the reform minded dems should introduce a ‚ÄúNext Step Act‚Äù and only support the First Step Act if their colleagues pledge to support the follow up
Representatives @RepRaskin and @RepJayapal also thought the bill didn‚Äôt go far enough. Raskin put it nicely saying ‚ÄúI want the first step to be a good one, so I have to vote no.‚Äù
The final vote was 25-5. Some of the notable nos were @JacksonLeeTX18 who asked for amendments to keep families together and @RepJerryNadler who wanted sentencing reform.
Prison reform moves forward through committee. It looks like it may get in the way of meaningful criminal justice reform. Let's hope I'm wrong.
But the amendment fails. Simplicity wins over women and family values
He asks her to withdraw the amendment. She persists.
Collins opposes it because it complicates things even though he thinks it has good intentions. Seems like similar logic we heard earlier.
Rep. Jackson Lee introduces an amendment to let children born in prison stay with mothers to support the "unification of families". She ends "this is family values."
An amendment clarifying that the good time credits the FIRST STEP Act adds would be retroactive. Certainly an improvement.
It's the common story when it comes to reform. Minimize a movement repeatedly under the guise of "compromise" until the reform is menial. But we wont go down without fighting this time. We had a deal. We won't have the rug pulled out from under us.
We came together and created meaningful reform that those on both sides of the aisle could agree with. Then the constraints of the conversation changed despite the SRCA moving through committee.
There's this idea that the SRCA or sentencing reform are a radical idea and that this is compromise. But let's be frank, the SRCA was already a compromise. A good one!
I understand why the supporters of prison reform are focusing on the benefits in the bill instead of addressing the claim that it does not go far enough. But it's endlessly frustrating.
Rep. Jackson Lee puts it well. She's "grateful for the unshackling" in the FIRST STEP Act, but the bill doesn't provide ways to support women with mental health problems or children born in prison. It does not go far enough to help women.
The discussion of the FIRST STEP Act right now totally ignores the fact that sentencing reform is alive and well! If sentencing reform were totally untenable, that would be one thing, but it has leaders on both sides of the aisle https://t.co/GZvjSEReh8
Rep. Jefferies says we need sentencing reform, but it will require "sustained effort and a meaningful first step", clearly implying the First STEP Act will lead to sentencing reform. But there's not evidence of that. In fact, there's evidence against it. https://t.co/9z8HYeSfg4
The defense of the watered-down FIRST STEP Act seems to be "it's time to move SOMETHING forward", but only if that thing doesn't include sentencing reform. Hm.
Collins says the FIRST STEP ACt is not perfect but "why would you vote no on a bill that bans shackling women?" Because that should be a given. Because we have a better bill that can go further and do more. Because that's only the bare minimum and we want meaningful reform.
Nadler does say he approves of the good credit reforms in the bill as well as the ban on shackling pregnant women.
Nadler says the Dems main goal is eliminating mandatory minimums to reduce mass incarceration. Currently, this bill does not do that.
Motion to table fails.
Goodlatte described this bill as the product of years of work. Nadler says then we could use a few more weeks. Rep. Collins disagrees. He says "let's help families now."
"It is imperative that we pursue both measures" yes!
Rep Nadler seeking to postpone discussion for a month to try and include sentencing reform in the bill. Would be a great move. FIRST STEP could be meaningful legislation if we include sentencing reform.
Goodlatte doesn't even mention the possibility of sentencing reform.
And it begins. Rep. Goodlatte says "while we know criminals need to be incarcerated but..."; it's a throwaway line, but illustrates how close minded we often are. No, we don't need to incarcerate every criminal. https://t.co/ntFM2CVApB
With a bipartisan bill that has already passed committee (the SRCA) as another option, the FIRST STEP Act is a step backward. We can, and must, do better.
I'll be live tweeting the hearing today on the FIRST STEP Act, a weak bill that does little to fix mass incarceration. Republicans like @ChuckGrassley, Democrats like @EricHolder and 70+ civil rights groups all agree the bill falls short.

The Brennan Center is actually working on measuring incarceration‚Äôs impact on the economy right now, so stay tuned for our answer. The model isn‚Äôt totally finished yet, but early results suggest we do see significant impacts.
Finally, while I believe mass incarceration likely had an impact, clearly broader economic factors matter here too. And Drum doesn‚Äôt attempt to adjust for any of them. That‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs a short piece, but let‚Äôs not end the conversation.
Secondly, mass incarceration hurt white male employment, too. That‚Äôs something we often forget.
For one, the criminal justice system had significant racial disparities in the 1970s. They were emphasized by mass incarceration, but always existed.
The writer, Drum, looks at black/white employment comparisons before and after mass incarceration and finds they are consistent over time (AKA mass inc didn‚Äôt make Af Ams fall further behind than they already were). That‚Äôs noteworthy, but it isn‚Äôt quite enough evidence.

And perhaps the most devastating line: ‚ÄúAll of this ‚Äì all of it ‚Äì was predictable‚Äù
‚ÄúOn his watch, the Justice Department has reversed efforts to reform our broken criminal justice system. And on his watch, the Justice Department has led an all-out, bigotry-fueled attack on immigrants and refugees.‚Äù
‚ÄúHe has used the Department to try to cut off aid to cities and states that prioritize keeping their communities safe over being a part of his national deportation force‚Äù
‚ÄúSessions ended the Department‚Äôs Smart on Crime initiative which allowed prosecutors to divert some low-level, non-violent offenders, into rehab programs‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Department has abandoned its longstanding efforts to hold local police forces accountable when they routinely and systemically violate the constitutional rights of American citizens.‚Äù
Her examples: ‚ÄúUnder Jeff Sessions, the Justice Department killed off a reform initiative that allowed local police departments to voluntarily partner with the federal government to improve community policing.‚Äù

7/7 But it‚Äôs still too slow. Given this trajectory, we will get to 1980s incarceration rates in 90 years. Black/white disparities won‚Äôt be gone for another century https://t.co/WNOmQS6Bzi
6/7 However, this is real progress. There are more people home with families, fewer people being treated like animals.
5/7 Systemic issues remain. Private prison use went up 2% and there are still 14 states over capacity.
4/7 Other states went the wrong direction. Kentucky appears to be trying to incarcerate its way out of opioid addiction. It isn‚Äôt working and their prison pop went up 6%, 14% for women.
3/7 Some states showed real, concrete progress. Alaska‚Äôs prison population fell 15% after recent reforms.
2/7 The imprisonment rate is down 2%, federal prison pop fell 4%. Our incarceration rate is now at 1997 levels. Lower rates for both men and women. Disparities between African Americans and whites dropped again, but the difference is still huge.
1/7 New prison statistics out today. The takeaway: slow progress https://t.co/SZOPRkwxMD

If his testimony on Russia is as misleading as it is on criminal justice, then Mueller should have a lot to work with.  9/9
We know it‚Äôs a lie. Yes, it did work in NY. Again, stating the obvious. But his policy positions haven‚Äôt followed that model. They‚Äôll fuel mass incarceration. 8/9
So when he says ‚ÄúWe will not seek ‚Äòmass incarceration,‚Äô but focus really on who is driving the crime. It has worked in NY‚Äù... 7/9
He said the men in blue were the solution to crime, but is holding back funding for police in sanctuary cities. 6/9
But he made no indication he would do better than the 18-to-1 ratio he negotiated last time. Also no indication he would consider the SRCA. 5/9
He said he could work on progressive reform--‚ÄúDurbin and I worked on cocaine sentencing reform.‚Äù 4/9
He admitted pot was safer than heroin, but keeps suggesting that one leads to another. The data says the opposite is true. 3/9
