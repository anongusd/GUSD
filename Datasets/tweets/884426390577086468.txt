@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Once you are finished with this you will be able to reboot and it will restore to the manufacture settings or based on your choices how you want it  to. .

@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Hold both buttons down ,the power on AND the volume up untill your device lights up and then it will turn off again...you will know by the screen lights on then off.m
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice No it still has NOT EVEN RESET THE HARD DRIVE... THIS IS DONE BY PLACING THE CELL BACK IN AND HOLDING DOWN THE POWER BUTTON AND THE VOLUME UP BUTTON....
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice You have now reset the hard drive on your New device but this is not enough and still not good enough to get the people off who are spying on you
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice The second thing holding down the power button does is...it resets the network computers connection by this cutting off process, a minimum of 30 seconds hold down the power button.
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice This holding down the power button does two things...it drains all leftover juice in the devices board inside the phone unless you have a device with a secret back up power supply and storage for the backup cell.
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice This step is important to do, a step that a technician at SPRINT, shared with me a very long time ago....
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice After I have turned off or just ripped the cell out of the device I hold down the power button for 30 seconds minimum with the cell out of it.
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice This next step will EITHER cut service or it may not. I do it anyway...

@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Bull Billie Bunkers and you can call me if you're going to cut off my phone. You are liable for loss and then I said or demanded..
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Again... we do nothing to cut off service
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Next question, I know that you are the ones cutting service, why can't you call me first before you cut off my discounts on your program and tell me, I have lost so info, data and you are liable for loss of my business matters. Why do you do that to me?
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Answer https://t.co/Dh37PfKkdG
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice I asked another question and I am NOT HAPPY WITH THE ANSWER ABIUT THIS EITHER..COULD YOU PROVIDE ME S COMPLETE LIST OF ALL THE NUMBERS DEVICES EVER USED ON MY INFO AND MAIL ME THE LIST?
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Again I'm out of luck, sorry no can do. https://t.co/hESfvpYwXq
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice This being the number I called in on today to discuss is that new number, service cut 12/19/17
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice They gave me a completely different New number AND, NO, not my previous one.
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Call the phone service provider, talk to them, I did with them after a lost device and new one about 37 days later and s week of calling in, ok we will do that and give you your number back..ok ..
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Next question? Can you please start it back up? Answer..no
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice Then I asked about the previous number I had and then my information did come up but after that still nothing to have service restarted was done, they say it is not them cutting service.
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice A letter from CA Lifeline received to me in the mail states I'm good untill 12/25/17 and then I may change carriers etc. Blah blah blah..
@POTUS @FCC @GovPressOffice My info did not match the number or anything with my information at all ,my service was cut off on 12/19/17
