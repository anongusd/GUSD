@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Yet you claim the only reason Atiku is corrupt is what obj said in his book 	But now come back to discredit him 	Are you not making yeye of ya sef
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Surprised what you discover about Buhari and this government awhole
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Abuse of power and nepotism are elements of corruption 	Financial corruption isn't the only corruption in our country 	Would you say the appointment of all security chiefs from a particular religion 	From a particular region isn't corruption? 	Wait till when he leaves you'd be
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu What of ? Lol you see how shallow minded  those of you supporting mr lifeless is 	You dwell on hear say 	Last I checked Saraki was cleared for any wrong doing 	But do to hear say or product of your imagination you day he's corrupt.	You're even asking me if Buhari is corrupt?
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Obasanjo is not a law court 	Or if obj is your yardstick 	Then I dont know if you e read or been listening to all he has said about Buhari
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Forward with your evidence or charge him to court 	But y'all rely on hear say 	But if you call Buhari or Osinbajo corrupt 	They say its hate speech 	The use the institutions of government to intimidate you
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Has Atiku been convicted of any corruption case or does he have any corruption case on going 	You see how free it is to call Atiku corrupt even without proof 	Apc/and Buhari charged pdp and Atiku to court because they called Buhari corrupt 	Atiku has challenged your like to come
@kingjesusbaiby @DeleMomodu Do you think Buhari would have a chance to rule a local government in China if he was a Chinese? 	Before 2015 Nigeria was competing or growing in the same pace with China 	But what do we have on ground today 	So Peter or anybody could use those those places as examples

@heskeyw @amadi68595854 @Laurestar And that justifies their killing 	Tomorrow I will hear you rant about end sars	Today it's them 	Tomorrow it could be you or your love ones 	So there's no other ways to neutralize them 	Especially when it's only stone they having ?

@tayolukson @OfficialPDPNig @UN @UNHumanRights @USEmbassyAbuja @UKinNigeria @UKParliament @HouseofCommons @EmmanuelMacron @atiku So they should kill them all 	Today it's shiite	Because a suni is in power 	Tomorrow if a shiite  muslim is elected and he unleash same terror to the sunis Muslims 	Hope you'd expect us to keep mute and look the other way 	Stop being biased Mr
@AbdulMahmud01 Sad but that's the reality we are faced with
@realDonaldTrump Truth will always stand tall 	Mr @realDonaldTrump
@fkeyamo Tomorrow you hear them talking about hate speech 	You find it fun throwing dirts on the opposition image 	This may not go down well when we all tow that line 	You seem to forget your principal buhari has so much skeleton in his cupboard.. 	Focus on ur campaigns
@GarShehu Sir we've heard so much noise about this corruption fight 	This tactics ain't working anymore 	Wish you could bring something better to the table 	Since y'all have run out of ideas on how to move the country forward 	Let's try atiku	If he fails we will send him out

@akilaiya_tosin3 @Olamaboreje1 @GovAyoFayose Bro why do say I should shut up? 	And what made me a fool?
@fkeyamo At least they built it in Nigeria and our kids are going to school there 	We need many more universities in the country to admit thousands of our students taking jamb 	But unfortunately all we see and hear is so much noise making in fighting corruption without any visible result
@Olamaboreje1 @GovAyoFayose Today its them n u say they're  not law abiding citizens n so therefore they should all be killed 	Tomorrow when it's your turn n your love ones I hope you expect us to applaud them 	Don't get too comfortable yet with claims of I'm a law abiding citizens.. #youneverknowtomorrow

@ogundamisi @atiku @MBuhari @GEJonathan @AMADICHIMA @fkeyamo Yes I like your last line 	#election will come and go 	So Festus should remember all he has done is not campaign for buhari or showcase the good buhari and apc has done 	Rather every here and then he's telling us atiku is corrupt 	Pdp is corrupt 	Only those In apc are saint.

@ChimaobiBright3 @vanguardngrnews So by 2019 buhari Will win and continue punishing igbos

@tholex360 @TheNationNews You're quick to condemn the opposition party and make excuses for the present government.. 	Don't forget it was the military that handed over to them but they didn't go about complaining of the decays the military handed over to them instead they went to work .

If you don't support ATIKU in 2019 what do you gain?
@fkeyamo So you're indirectly telling us that it's okay for Nigerians to suffer now because people suffered when they were in government?
@PremiumTimesng Better than never...thats what every right thinking Nigerian should do	We keep pushing till we get it right 	If atiku fails we will seek alternative from opposition party just like we are clamouring to replace buhari now
@APCUKingdom @NGRPresident @MBuhari Sorry true igbos don't support apc
@MailOnline Y'all saying it's lies and fake news 	So what really happened to the missing journalist?
@APCNigeria How well are our police and other security agencies take care off ?
@vanguardngrnews Atiku didn't say it 	Rather that's what it is 	Considering the age of president buhari 	One would have thought that he be our messiah 	it appears he's not in charge of this government 	We have tried him and seen he can't govern this country well 	Let another take over
@vanguardngrnews We are falling back to those bad tyrannical times again 	Peaceful protest is their constitutional right
