More history - Guatemala established gun control in 1964: From 1964 to 1981, 100,000 Mayan Indians, unable to defend  themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
More history - China established gun control in 1935: From 1948 to 1952, 20 million political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
More history -  socialists &amp; communists running the USA:  Germany established gun control &amp; From 1939 to 1945, a total of 13 million Jews and others who were  unable to defend themselves were rounded up and exterminated.
More history &amp; don't think this couldn't happen with progressive dems., socialists &amp; communists running the USA:  In 1911, Turkey established gun control:  From 1915 to 1917, 1.5 million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
Some history &amp; don't think this couldn't happen with progressive dems., socialists &amp; communists running the USA:  In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control: From 1929 to 1953,  about 20 million dissidents,  unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
And the most ridiculous gem of wisdom, from the "Mother Superior Moron": "We just have to pass the Healthcare Bill to see what's in it."   ~Nancy Pelosi   (Quoted March, 2010 )   (As one Doctor said: "That is also the perfect definition of a stool sample.")
Another example why the democrats should not be in the majority in the U.S. House:  "You don't need God anymore; you have us Democrats."   ~ Nancy Pelosi (Quoted 2006)
This is an example why the democrats should not be in the majority in the U.S. House:  	"My fear is if North Korea nukes us, Trump is gonna get us into a war."   ~Maxine Waters (Quoted 2017)
Time to share this again as conservatives often play softball vs hardball. 	Disarming oneself of logic, reality, truth is deadly.  	So ... When you seek change don't forget the three A's - be Arbitrary, be Aggressive, &amp; be an Activist for your cause or candidate.
