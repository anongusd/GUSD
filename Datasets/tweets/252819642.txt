It was an honor to work alongside him for eight years in Congress and as a Marine he could always be counted on to take the hill. Kansans should know that he will finish strong these last two years in office. Thank you for your service to our state and our nation, Senator.
.@SenPatRoberts will leave behind a strong legacy and very large shoes to fill. He has been a champion for liberty, freedom, his beloved Kansas State Wildcats, and above all our Kansas farmers and ranchers.
