Congrats to Congressman Steube who manages to produce the dumbest line of questioning of the day so far. "Mr. Cohen, you call this CHECK WITH THE PRESIDENT'S SIGNATURE ON IT evidence? I disagree."
It's funny to think your job is to prove that Michael Cohen, recently disbarred and soon heading to federal prison, is a bad lawyer. Well, yeah! He's pretty bad at being a lawyer, guys.
I would like to hold what Cohen considers ‚Äúdroll‚Äù in contempt.
‚ÄúMr. Cohen, I represent an R+250% district, and I love Donald Trump. I love him. I love his face. I love him. I love him. I love him so much. Why are you doing this to him? To us? Don‚Äôt answer. I yield my time the ranking dum-dum.‚Äù

Sounds like Brett Kavanaugh and Bart O'Kavanaugh would not have much in common.
Genuinely believe if Ronan had a damaging story about the Democratic nominee two weeks before the 2020 presidential election, he would fight like hell to run it. (I just really really hope that doesn't happen.)
But to say he‚Äôs doing this because he‚Äôs motivated by partisanship? It‚Äôs just not true - it's not who he is, sometimes to an annoying degree. And I say that as someone who could, at times, be considered partisan.
Debating the Kavanaugh story, fine. And I do see many of the objections being raised as sincere, even if I disagree and know the lengths the New Yorker goes to back up their stories and the care they show for the facts.
The last story @RonanFarrow and @JaneMayerNYer wrote together was about the Democratic AG of New York who was considered one of the most important figures in the legal fight against Trump.

Tapper is pretty good at ‚Äúwinning‚Äù against these types. Which is why they don‚Äôt go there as much I guess. He has more of a rope-a-dope thing - doesn‚Äôt follow them into the word maze. But still it‚Äôs hard because shamelessness is a powerful weapon.
Online or in print, you can break down language, find holes, explain. But on television, to ‚Äúwin‚Äù you have to have facts on ready but even that‚Äôs not enough. Facts have to expose weakness and on TV that means seeing it in a sense that somebody is off balance, somehow shamed.
You watch an interview with Rudy and it‚Äôs this fusillade of bullshit. Vague, non-sensical but offered as common sense. He doesn‚Äôt get the better of anybody. But he evades pretty well because when challenged he withdraws to grand conclusions not based in fact.
Wait wait wait, Rudy. The email made it clear he knew what the meeting was about. We have this email. Wait, you said the opposite just last week. It‚Äôs easier to lie than fact check.
There‚Äôs just a fundamental problem of having Trump people on like Rudy who mix in subtle lies with brazen big lies. You have to confidently know the story inside and out, the big turns, the details of emails, this long, complicated story.

@ModernWood @mattdpearce That fascism was smarter than this
"Some critics are suggesting that the president's decision to hire a skywriter to spell out 'Hang tough, Paul' over the nation's capital was meant to send a signal to Manafort, but the president's lawyers insist it's just a Giamatti/Billions thing."
Look, Trump examined the case, prayed on it, read a psalm or two about justice and mercy, consulted his lawyers who are not busy, and came to the conclusion that Scooter Libby's clemency was not enough.

Also, the WaPo story cites: "officials familiar with the call," "two people familiar with the notecards," "a senior White House official," "administration officials," and "one person familiar with the conversation." We have no idea who leaked this, how close to Trump, etc.

Trump's unusual conduct is leading to unusual leaks. That someone might claim it as a precedent in the future won't make it right then or wrong now. https://t.co/8kRuspTzdM

@EsotericCD It's an example for me when people like Alec Baldwin side with Woody Allen - there's arrogance in believing you have the power to suss out a liar, that you can spot the tells in someone who has no scruples at all.
I remember saying something like, "Huh, because from the outside it looks really bad." And she told me she was bringing on a new PR person to get the real story out there. Seems like that worked.
Anyhow, I'll always remember the sincerity and intensity in her eyes as she explained, in detail, how she was being railroaded and would be vindicated because it was pretty chilling in hindsight.
I met Elizabeth Holmes at a party right after a particularly damning WSJ story had hit. Someone introduced her and I don't do well at parties anyhow and I'd had a cocktail so I said "oh man that WSJ makes it sound like you just made it all up" or something to that effect.

The dumbest people explaining to me why, actually, passengers were right to not make a fuss, as they may have been arrested. Imagine the trial! "Your honor, my client stands accused of saving a dog from an airline."
I'm getting a lot of these responses, which is the problem. Yes, the law says listen to flight attendants. But if a flight attendant is suffocating a dog, you have to use common sense and take your chances back on earth, where people love dogs. https://t.co/3vuIgNavKV
@lpolgreen Of course! And we'd be reading a story about a suspended flight attendant instead of a dead dog.
@nycsouthpaw Absolutely! But it's just an excuse in this case.
It's easy to write this as a story about United, harder to write it as a story about United and the deference of the passengers that only ended when witnesses took to social media after the fact.
United deserves to be blamed, fine. But article after article reports on this story without turning to the behavior of the passengers, who were cowed into listening as a dog died because a moron flight attendant said so. https://t.co/5Qba7lIrve

Lots of important information for you to pretend you read before you wrote your column, @BretStephensNYT. Have a great weekend.
Anyway, I‚Äôll stop but Bret, no, two lengthy investigations did not exonerate Allen. If you‚Äôre googling, check out Maureen Orth‚Äôs work on this. Read the Thibault report in Connecticut mag. Read the actual rulings. For example, see below. https://t.co/OpNdUphAtD
I just do not believe @BretStephensNYT that you did the work before writing the column. Only other option is that you did but decided to write a one-sided piece anyway. That‚Äôs probably worse! So I‚Äôm sort of complimenting you in a way.
In the spirit of intellectual honesty, @BretStephensNYT this is what the judge wrote in not finding him ‚Äúguilty‚Äù as you say. You think this is a point for Allen? Really? https://t.co/3E9rFFa8R0
5. I know Dylan and believe her based on her account and the mountains of evidence that support it. I have read everything I could on this because I knew the family. Don‚Äôt talk to me about verdict first. You reached a verdict without doing the work.
4. So let‚Äôs sum up. The prosecutor found probable cause. The custody judge documented evidence of inappropriate behavior and testimony that backs Dylan‚Äôs version of events. One report sided with Allen but the doctor never met Dylan and destroyed his notes.
3. There is the Yale report which does side with Allen. You do have that. But that report is to this day an unexplained travesty. Here is what Andy Thibault found in his investigation of that report: https://t.co/UAaMdbMirO
2. No, the judge didn‚Äôt find Allen ‚Äúguilty.‚Äù It was about custody. He did say they measures must be taken to protect Dylan from Woody Allen. And he documented via testimony and evidence a history of shocking and inappropriate behavior.
Wrong. Again. Let‚Äôs go through the facts, Bret. Good to do this before you hit publish but oh well.	1. Maco, the prosecutor in the case, took rare step of saying he had probable cause to charge Allen but declined because of the hell that would have been visited on a little girl. https://t.co/mWqedL7Yws

Second, Woody Allen points to a Yale report that sided with him. And it does. But how that report was put together is shocking. They used people Allen paid! The doctor called Allen‚Äôs lawyer! https://t.co/O17UdszEPl
Two more points on this then I‚Äôm done. First, Woody Allen used the same tactics as Weinstein. From a profile of the prosecutor who said he had probable cause against Allen: https://t.co/eqzYAMuOF0

@BretStephensNYT You have to ignore so much evidence to write a column like this. You have to really want it. This is not the case of Dylan‚Äôs word alone. For example, here is part of the judge‚Äôs ruling that kept Allen away from the kids. https://t.co/M2dd12T32x
Everybody is pointing to this line by @BretStephensNYT as being morally repugnant. It‚Äôs also not true! Woody Allen was in therapy for recurring inappropriate contact with Dylan and a babysitter reported walking into a room and finding Allen with his head in Dylan‚Äôs lap. https://t.co/fROkD2gbMO

The ease Trump had in totally capturing Republicans in Congress is pathetic. He‚Äôs an unpopular moron and still Ryan and Nunes became his little supplicants.
It was way too easy for Trump to capture Republicans in Congress. Trump‚Äôs an unpopular moron and still Ryan and Nunes bow like little supplicants.
Shame that Trump can't cure his personality disorder/racism AND that his supplicants can't stop from helping him obstruct justice and destroy our institutions as it is a huge distraction from AMERICA'S GOLDEN AGE.
Nunes leading us toward the Full Banana.
This is no longer Republicans running interference or looking the other way for Trump, it's an active campaign to protect him and undermine his perceived adversaries. If this were another country, it wouldn't be hard to call this what it is. https://t.co/qI92JsQy6B
