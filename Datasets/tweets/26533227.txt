.@POTUS decision to submit #IranDeal for UN approval before consulting Congress, in spite of requests from Dems to wait, wasn't encouraging.
As Congress reviews this #IranDeal, I hope the president will listen to the concerns that have been raised by members of both parties.
The #IranDeal allows Iran to modernize nuclear infrastructure &amp; continue R&amp;D on advanced centrifuges capable of enriching uranium for a bomb
This #IranDeal legitimizes Iran’s right to maintain its domestic nuclear enrichment program while leaving the door open for a nuclear bomb.
