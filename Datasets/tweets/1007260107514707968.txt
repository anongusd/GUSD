@IDFSpokesperson Israel can raze whole Palestine to the ground at once and finish them forever and they themselves know it well but i don't know why they still start to attack us . live long patient Israel .

Democrat California gubernatorial candidate Gavin Newson said that as governor, he would grant universal health care to illegal aliens via an executive order.		California, you better vote RED -  This is crazy talk.	Who do you represent Gavin?	Treasonous?
Holy crap! 👇	China, a country that loathes America, has ALL of Hillary's emails!		ALL of the classified info, ALL of the US secrets that she held as SOS are in the hands of our enemy.		Hillary's utter carelessness and her basement server could get us all killed.		Did she know???
The evidence against the corrupt Dems piles up more and more every day.		And the evidence against Trump Russia collusion is DEBUNKED more every single day.		And yet, not a damn thing happens to the anti-American corrupt Democrats.
The flag represents the souls of our nation- the men and women who serve-for those we’ve loved and lost whose coffins are draped in our nation’s colors when they return home to us. They fight for those freedoms that many of us take for granted.
Just another way of trying 2 destroy POTUS bunch of bull crap-we Americans need2show our support4 POTUS &amp;vote these bums out-MSM brilliant plan in keeping lying fire burning  with republican cabal aka old establishment in the mold of McCain they r kdarker than dark helping MSM
Watch as Dems pull every trick in the book ‘cause we're about to tilt the Supreme Court to the right for the next 40 yrs let them make fools out of themselves Smile, Republicans, because Kavanaugh WILL be confirmed &amp; we'll have defeated the dems best efforts to stop us #LastLaugh
The Reason why the Democrats keep calling for the impeachment of 45 is that they know they can't win against him in 2020!
Watching Pres Obama taking credit for the Trump economy is like a boat anchor taking credit for a boat speeding across a lake! Great comedy and classic narcissism.  Welcome back, Pres Obama--you remind me why I'm glad Trump is POTUS
Whether you love or hate him, Trump’s ascendancy to the presidency was a once-in-a-century miracle. He was literally the Man Without a Party, yet beat 16 primary competitors and an opponent whose victory was her “manifest destiny.” It was a political feat unequaled in history.
All these so called actors do no know what real life is- they r living in an imaginary world-so sad because they get filthy rich of our backs-deworm has turned since- POTUS we have finally got schooled go &amp; retire on ur dirty money broadway &amp; Hollywood
Hoping real America’s go &amp; VOTE I know it’s difficult-voting 4 some of these establishment republicans losers-but 1 step at a time-get in-make POTUS stronger &amp; them Wam BAM-there goners next time-believe in TRUMP-VOTE Republican-u won’t b sorry!
Democratic party of yesterday has also lost control of their own base. Our survival as a nation depends on Patriots that are frantically cleaning up their trail of destruction. Vote Red as if your life depends on it because it most likely does.
With Kavanaugh Accuser's story falling apart it appears as though the NY Times has gone back to screaming about Russia.
Our economy is soaring into the wild blue yonder because we have a President that has the business acuity to renegotiate fair and balanced trade deals.	We stand ready against any threat to our constitution and Commander and Chief.	God Bless America!
Here is Barack Obama intentionally not putting his hand over his heart while the National Anthem was being played, FROM START TO FINISH.		This man was actually President of the United States and it was the biggest and most disastrous mistake this country ever made. https://t.co/9t5lHKJBYP
So laughable it makes me cry-have we become so stupid &amp; gullible in America that an unprovable words-will destroy a family in d name of WOMAN-it’s time we scream 2 d highest rafters 2 VOTE RED with all our might-if not see D destruction of our beloved country

FLOTUS holds a 6month old baby at the Greater Accra Regional Hospital in Accra, Ghana. The First Lady handed out teddy bears and Be Best-themed blankets donated by the White House to young children and their mothers. #BeBest

It could be a real mess if it leads to a shut down,” said Matt Mackowiak, a GOP strategist and opinion contributor for The Hill. “So there’s still some political risk out there for Republicans
Congressional leaders want to avoid passing another short-term funding patch this year and are hoping to move spending legislation through both chambers before the end of September
The House, which also passed a bipartisan prison reform bill last month, plans to take up legislation next week to combat the nation’s deadly opioid crisis — an issue that resonates strongly in many communities around the country
But in recent months, Congress has seen an uptick in activity, with Trump signing legislation to ease financial regulations, improve how veterans access health care and allow terminally ill patients to try experimental drugs
It can be difficult to accomplish major policy items in election years, with less time on the legislative calendar and vulnerable members reluctant to take any tough votes
And there are also some concerns that the economic gains from the tax law could be wiped out after Trump slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports worldwide, including from the European Union, Canada and Mexico
While the tax law’s poll numbers have improved, GOP strategists point out that some voters may not see the benefits until next year.
You can’t just rest on your laurels,” Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, told The Hill on Wednesday. “You’ve got to keep fulfilling your promises to the American people
The effort to push a more aggressive Republican agenda could please some conservatives, who have said tax reform alone is not enough to run on in the midterms
Despite majorities in both chambers and control of the White House, Republicans failed to repeal and replace ObamaCare or fund Trump’s signature border wall.
The GOP Congress also has come up short on some of Trump’s chief priorities, disappointing the president and his most fervent supporters.
The same week that Congress sent a trio of bills to Trump’s desk, for example, the president dominated the news cycle by canceling a planned historic summit with North Korea.
It’s unclear whether the GOP’s messaging strategy will work, especially when accomplishments on Capitol Hill can be easily overshadowed by more dramatic developments coming out of the White House.
In another move meant to paint the portrait of Republicans hard at work, McConnell announced Tuesday he would cancel most of the August recess so that senators could work through spending bills and Trump’s nominations before a Sept
“We’re doing more things this week to continue to establish our priorities,” Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) told reporters Wednesday. “It’s not just lowering taxes for families, but it’s taking care of our military and taking care of our veterans.”
n an interview with The Hill late last month, McConnell highlighted last year’s $1.5 trillion tax-cut package, but also pointed to increased spending for the military,
As a result, GOP leaders on both sides of the Capitol are emphasizing a breadth of legislative achievements as they seek to convince voters to keep them in charge and not deliver majorities to Democrats.
While the booming economy is expected to be a core pillar of the GOP’s midterm messaging, it’s unclear whether the party is going to get credit for the tax law, which has lagged in polls.
Republicans are working on a backup plan in case the GOP tax law does not turn out to be a strong selling point for their party in this year’s midterm elections.
The Utah Republican Party is Focused on what matters most, The Family. We are working diligently to elect conservatives who will pass legislation that helps the family become stronger, become closer, and have the opportunity to make choices for themselves.

The Republican Study Steering Committee is vehemently opposed to any farm bill that removes work and job training requirements. Why must the government insist on keeping able-bodied adults trapped in poverty? This is about hope, not judgment.
Our debt has mounted to dangerous levels, not because of a lack of tax revenue, but a lack of willpower to contain the rapid growth of government. RepublicanStudy budget balances in 8 years, fully funds our military, and gets us back on the path to fiscal sanity and prosperity.
There is nothing compassionate or responsible about refusing to reform these programs and prevent their imminent collapse. Hardworking people have paid in for years and will soon be told “too bad.” Reforms in our RepublicanStudy budget will save and improve both for the future.

The economy has made steady progress since Mr. Trump took office, with the unemployment rate recently dropping to 3.8 percent, its lowest level since 2000. Most economists see that improvement as a continuation of gains made under former President Barack Obama
