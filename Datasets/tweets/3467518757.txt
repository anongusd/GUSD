@OfficialClayyy I‚Äôm not sure I agree. Clinton got pretty close to winning the Midwest, and that‚Äôs after 25 years of Fox News campaigning against her and her economic message being meh. Warren‚Äôs is much more in line with Brown, who clearly does very well there. VP could matter too.
@OfficialClayyy I think @EricPerless says it well‚Äîthe presidency won‚Äôt be terribly difficult to win back; it‚Äôs helping us win the senate back that we should worry about.
@OfficialClayyy I don‚Äôt really doubt that Warren could beat Trump. I‚Äôm not sure she‚Äôs the best equipped to do so, but I think she‚Äôs got a pretty good shot.		That‚Äôs my one worry with Brown. I‚Äôm open to Klobuchar, but I really like the way Brown talks about labor and economics.
@OfficialClayyy I disagree with almost all of this, actually. Her messaging, outside of that video, has been fantastic. She‚Äôs doing a great job with her rhetoric. Is she really that controversial?		Klobuchar is good, but I‚Äôll need to see more from her. I‚Äôm a big fan of Brown; he‚Äôs my top choice.
@OfficialClayyy Why shouldn‚Äôt Warren? If it‚Äôs about the heritage video, I agree she has a LOT to make up for; that said, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs comparable to this.
This is not acceptable. Being ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù to take notice of sexual harassment and sexism in your own campaign is not okay.		I like many of Sanders‚Äô ideas.
