ICYMI, last week I caught up with @BillWills to talk about #SOTU and my first month in Congress. Listen to our conversation here: https://t.co/gqr21Yo74P
This bill does not question where one stands on the pro-life debate. This bill simply states that all children born in this country deserve the same protections under the law. It is that simple, and it should pass unanimously.
As a new father, it is hard to imagine a world in which the killing of a newborn child is acceptable, let alone legal in our country. The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should not be a partisan bill. It is common sense.
This week's #mondaymailbag comes from James, a 15- year-old from Medina who wants to know how to become a Congressman when he grows up. There's no one path to become a congressman, but I hope this advice helps. Thanks for writing in! https://t.co/zEZ3iui5yd

We need to ensure we are doing our jobs, and that means putting an end to government shutdowns or, at the very least, ensuring lawmakers are not paid in the event of one. It is time to make Washington work for the people again.
For me, this is simple: our government has a responsibility to the men and women of this country to come together and solve our big challenges. I have been working in a bipartisan manner here in Congress to do just that.
Starting my Congressional career in the midst of a partial government shutdown has made fixing our government even more of a top priority for me. I'm working in a bipartisan manner in Congress to end future shutdowns. Learn more about my work here: https://t.co/ofhXB70vF1 https://t.co/UdonN7pfKR

I came to Congress on a promise to make our government work for the people again, and a big part of that is bringing this governing body into the 21st Century. On my second day in Congress, it‚Äôs already clear that the modernization of Congress is long overdue.
I look forward to supporting those efforts.
The bill we voted on yesterday was neither a compromise nor a realistic solution to funding our government. Leadership from both parties need to come together and work in a meaningful bipartisan manner to fund the government and put our country back on track.
We have a responsibility to the men and women of this country to come together in a bipartisan manner to solve our big challenges. That starts with funding the government in a way that responsibly secures our border.
