@Mark_J_Quinn Obama sent fox "faux" news to the back of the room for briefings. Trump has removed credentials and barred CNN several times.
@Mark_J_Quinn Too easy? how?  a verbal disrebuke from trump and Obama is one thing. And fair on both sides. this is why no one defends U guys. U can't tell the difference from assault and heckling back. where is the male reporter assaulting female staffers. Where is Obama removing credentials
@Mark_J_Quinn It's good that we can look back on the multiple democratic white House press briefings and know there was never occasion for this to happen.  Honest questions met with enemy of the people...Trump could be honest and say he feels live questions from the news are his personal enemy

@_RainyDayWoman @benshapiro I can post memes to fEEl right. Or I can tap out of twitter and read up on the human genome and DNA	 some males are born 46XX due to the translocation of a tiny section of the sex determining region of the Y chromosome. Some females are also born 46XY due to the same mutations.
@sgtyvette @benshapiro It's exactly because of that rarity that we can't and shouldn't force our sexual nature on them.  We don't understand their DNA but simultaneously want them to behave male or female. That's it, no inbetween?
@_RainyDayWoman @benshapiro Most women are 46XX and most men are 46XY. Research suggests, however, that in a few births per thousand some individuals will be born with a single sex chromosome (45X or 45Y) (sex monosomies) and some with three or more sex chromosomes. In addition, some males are born 46XX
