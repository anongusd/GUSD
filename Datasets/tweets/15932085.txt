@Vanns40 @mattklewis Agree 100%.
@Vanns40 @mattklewis Yes, they definitely do. You have to sell them on your cause and deliver results. For better or worse, Bannon and O'Keefe have delivered results.
Also, calling donors "mostly stupid" is a sure way to make donors stop giving. And, trust me, they're funding much more than Bannon and O'Keefe. Ay yi yi.
I work in conservative fundraising, and I can guarantee you that donors are not "mostly stupid" as @mattklewis argues. But they do want a good reason to donate, so perhaps we need to be better at selling our causes?

My son has informed me he's pleased the debate will be shorter than "The Hobbit". #debatenight
Our great country of biased deplorables! #debatenight
@pye Justice reform is a winner -- more politicians should embrace it.
Trump should talk about the violence in Chicago. Democrats own that. #debatenight
How is this feminism???
Hillary talks about her father's humble upbringing to deflect from her own wealth and her husband's accomplishments because she has none.
I mean, come ON! Hillary lecturing on not hiding things??? #debatenight
Release the emails, Hillary! #debatenight
@SonnyGirard Will I have to take ten shots, too?
Please add "trumped up trickle down" to your Drunk Bingo cards. #debatenight
This debate is AWESOME!! "Why not?" #debatenight
Hillary doesn't need a website to do her "fact checking" -- she has the media to do that for her! #debatenight
Gotta love Hillary claiming credit for things her husband did as president. Feminism, baby! #debatenight
What was the question? #debatenight
@4paulryan Sarcasm, my friend. Sarcasm.
I've always loved how warm and unscripted Hillary is. #debatenight

If nothing else, I am now convinced more than ever that the grassroots need a stronger voice.
@KemberleeKaye While I think the intentions were good, this will not resonate well with a lot of people. Not one mind will be changed.
@KemberleeKaye And how does this get beyond the echo chamber of NRO?
@KemberleeKaye Okay, but redefine conservatism for whom? NRO readers?
@KemberleeKaye I'm in no way defending or supporting Trump. I just don't see how this symposium moves the needle for conservatives.
That NRO had previously failed to draw? Mkay. https://t.co/BqdvsiPN6G

It's the grassroots who get left out yet again. Now we don't like the GOP AND these so-called "prominent conservatives."
If the goal was to fire up Trump's supporters, well, then, mission accomplished. Signed, an unimportant conservative and undecided voter.
