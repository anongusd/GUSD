@realDonaldTrump He's right. The report did not conclude that 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico during the two storms.

Tough to disagree with that. https://t.co/nnbSRFfKNW
He doesn’t say it’s about integrity. It’s about credibility. One is internal, the other external. He’s consistently consumed by protecting the FBI externally. Which is fine, but that’s politics. Integrity means owning that. https://t.co/W3ptUO0iIp
Ends the book by saying he hopes it will inspire readers “to choose a higher loyalty, to find truth among lies, and to pursue ethical leadership.” It may, indeed, but likely not the way he intended.
Not enough in Congress are speaking out in defense of institutional checks and balances against Trump. “Their silence is complicity,” Comey says, but does not name them, sharing in both silence and complicity.
Epilogue-	“We all bear responsibility for the deeply flawed choices put before voters during the 2016 election…”
In his testimony before Congress, Comey says he claimed he was confused by his firing, because Trump had praised him. Earlier in the book, however, Comey describes that praise as a cynical tactic of Trump’s to gain compliance and loyalty.
Comey says he released his personal account of his dinner with Trump to force DOJ to name a special counsel who would then get whatever White House tapes existed. Even out of office, trying to engineer outcomes: “If I do it myself, it will create a media frenzy.”
Comey does not dwell overmuch on lessons learned in contemplation after his firing. Nor does he express much of the doubt he said equals wisdom. He learned “searing lessons” from his basketball lie about “easy lies” but acts as if they're only spoken by others.
After being fired while in California, Comey takes the FBI jet back to DC for the last time. He asks if he can sit in the cockpit for the landing.
Comey says he got fired for refusing to pledge loyalty. But what he did pledge was honesty—and he consistently didn’t give it. It’s McCabe, as ACTING director, who is forthright, admitting right off the bat to Trump that he authorized Comey’s flight home.
When Trump asks Comey to get him out from under “the cloud” of the Russia investigation, “I told him I would see what we could do.” All Comey does is refer the message to DOJ. Only when Trump follows up does Comey tell him the referral is all he can do.
When Trump asks Comey to let Flynn off, “I did not interrupt the president to protest that what he was asking was inappropriate, as I probably should have…Instead I only agreed that ‘he is a good guy.’” So weird that Trump got the impression Comey was on board.
“I went back to the FBI headquarters and told members of my staff that I had probably ended any personal relationship with the president.” He’s back the next week for a briefing.
And what effect does this “quick” expression have on Comey? “It was as if I had not spoken, and have never been born.” Without a single WORD Trump erases the entire life of the United States FBI director. And then? “The president thanked me for coming in.” Ooh, brutal.
“…a shadow seemed to cross his face. I could see something change in his eyes. A hardness, or darkness…eyes narrowed…jaw tightened…just as quickly as the glower crossed his face, it was gone.” Note that Trump DOESN’T ACTUALLY SAY ANYTHING!
“The first part of your answer was fine, Mr. President…But not the second part. We aren’t the kind of killers that Putin is.” Comey describes Trump’s response in dramatic terms:
…he lays the blame on Trump, referring to Trump’s habit of talking over people and asserting their agreement. “I’d be damned if I was going to let this trick work on me again.” Here’s what he says:
Trump seeks reassurance about telling Bill O’Reilly America isn’t “so innocent.” Here Comey comes closest to acknowledging his shortcomings when it comes to speaking up. But instead of taking responsibility for doing it with many people…
“Even behind closed doors, [Trump] didn’t recoil about Russian behavior.”
When Priebus says Trump would love to see him, Comey lies (he doesn’t call it that) and says, “Great.” All of these exchanges, Comey portrays as him standing firm because his inner voice is in the right place. What his actual voice says doesn’t seem to count.
Comey portrays not just outsider-Trump, but also former RNC chief Priebus as trying to break down the firewall between intel and politics. But when Priebus tries to initiate another meeting with Trump, Comey doesn’t stand firm, he says the president must be busy.
Ch. 14-	“Priebus wanted to understand, and I wanted to explain, the proper relationship between the FBI and the White House…seemed genuinely interested in getting it right.” The faraway days when GOP leaders thought a normal presidency was salvageable and pursued it.
Comey’s conclusion from his Trump meeting is exactly the Messiah Complex that tripped him up before and justifies all of his actions: “I needed to protect the FBI.”
And then says TRUMP doesn’t understand leadership.
Comey breaks.	“You will always get honesty from me.”	“That’s what I want, honest loyalty.”	“You will get that from me,” Comey says, “desperate to end our awkward standoff and telling myself that I had done enough to make clear where I stood.”
Comey unspools a remarkable, internal battle in which it never occurs to him simply to tell the president, “No. Doesn’t work that way.” The encounter plays out in Comey’s head over pages, with related flashbacks, philosophical contemplation…everything except just saying, “No.”
“I need loyalty. I expect loyalty,” Trump says.	Comey doesn’t say a word.	“I didn’t move, speak, or change my facial expression…”	Comey says he was “determined not to give..any hint of assent…”	JUST. SAY. NO.
Dinner with Trump. 		Comey schools Trump on the dynamic between DOJ/FBI and the White House. “This discourse obviously did not appease him,” Comey concludes…telling but not showing. How does he know? He doesn’t say.
“I’m really looking forward to working with you.” Again, Comey doesn’t reconcile the unremarkable outcome with the preceding drama of his own expectations. He never recognizes how those expectations justify his own actions.
Trump tries to pull Comey in for a hug. Comey builds and builds the drama of this moment. Up close, what terrible words does Trump say in Comey’s ear?
The Confession of James Comey: “The entire nightmare of the Clinton email investigation had been about protecting the integrity and independence of the FBI and the Department of Justice, about safeguarding the reservoir of trust and credibility.” True.
Ch. 13-	Comey finds the inauguration crowd lies “disconcerting,” but says nothing. At a White House event, he literally tries to camouflage himself to avoid being seen. Recall, the book starts with his desire to be an active participant and stand for truth regardless of politics.
Okay, we're in the home stretch as we tweet out highlights from the Comey book...
Comey realizes even a germaphobe who didn’t stay overnight could still be guilty. But, AGAIN, decides not to say anything. Identifies no principle to justify his silence.
Another meeting, now they discuss the pee stuff. Trump says he wasn’t there overnight and can’t stand germs, so he’s innocent.
…it gets so bad that Comey tells him the FBI is not investigating him. Not for any reason of principle, but “to quiet him.” How long was Comey able to sustain this grueling conversation? He says the private session was about FIVE MINUTES.
Alone with Trump, Comey decides the pee stuff is not necessary. Then, Trump gets defensive about the public sexual claims against him and “the conversation teetered toward disaster.” But Comey never explains how. Was it just Comey’s mounting sense of drama? We don’t know, but…
In fact, it’s TRUMP who tables the spin discussion.
…Team Trump tries to break down the firewall between intel and spin. Comey writes, “I should have said something right then.” He doesn’t. “Speaking up would be crazy.” “Should I now give them a lecture about how to behave…?” “Nope. Don’t think so.” So much for higher loyalty.
Team Trump tries to get the Obama intel people on their side. Comey portrays it like an exotic Mafia initiation rather than simple human nature. But then reveals that he, too, is playing politics…
Comey doesn’t reconcile the fact that Trump was “subdued and serious” with his expectation of a much more dramatic encounter. What does it say that Comey continually sees drama coming where it doesn’t? What behavior of Comey’s does that justify? He doesn’t ask these questions.
Some good insights from Comey on the problems of CEOs running government, a system that’s built adversarially, non-linear, with multiple constituencies. Stunning account of Trump team turning immediately to messaging upon getting the briefing re Putin/Russia.
Why does Comey reject the FBI general counsel’s advice? “…the bigger danger of the new president, who was known to be impulsive, going to war against the FBI.” Well, good thing Comey headed off THAT danger.
OVER the counsel of the FBI’s actual counsel, Comey decides he will tell Trump the FBI is not investigating him…but ONLY if it will help Comey out. It’s in his “back pocket” as he goes to meet Trump. Even though it raises EXACTLY the same problems he ran into with HRC.
Comey decides not to tell Trump about the pee stuff because it’s “embarrassing” and Trump might think Comey was trying to blackmail him. Again, Comey seems unaware that these decisions are textbook examples of politics.
Ch. 12-	Comey meets Trump…and gets to brief him about the Steele dossier. Pattern: Comey builds up how Trump will react, doesn’t acknowledge the anti-climactic payoff.
…and his way, it turns out, frequently looks a lot like that of the lying partisans once he meets Trump, as Comey himself reveals in Chapter 12, next.
Comey here grapples with his ego. “I do think my way is better than that of the lying partisans.” He never asks whether his ego led him to an institution that facilitated him thinking that about himself…
The idea he affected the outcome nauseates Comey, he says, “because I have devoted my life to serving institutions I love precisely because they play no role in politics.”
Comey, the man who hates and considers himself apart from politics, takes nothing from the fact that it is Chuck Schumer who responds to Comey’s dilemma by saying, “I know you.” Comey doesn’t consider the implications of who it is who really gets him.
After the election, Mitch McConnell says “With a tone that seemed close to enjoyment,” that Comey can “Take all the time you need” after Democrats ask Comey to explain what he had just done to the country.
Classic non-apology to HRC: “I’m sorry”…that she felt anger. “I’m sorry that I couldn’t do a better job explaining to her…” so that she would understand with and agree with and like him.
Two days before the election, Comey writes Congress to clear Clinton again. He says little to avoid “more confusion.” He’s still trying to manage people’s reactions to his actions, and still blind to the damage he does in the process.
Reax: “My world caught back on fire,” “Hysteria,” “…most [commentators] would do what would be best for their favorite team. Well, the FBI can’t have a favorite team.” Comey cloaks himself in the FBI to justify making it his favorite team so he can do what’s best for it.
Says if Lynch or Yates had told him not to reveal the new Weiner emails, he would have obeyed. No explanation of why some principles get stood on and others get walked all over. “Once again it became my responsibility to take the hit.”
…”down that path lies the death of the FBI as an independent force in American life.” Comey doesn’t reckon with the counter-argument that considering what’s good for the FBI is the real path toward its death.
A lawyer asks Comey whether he should consider that “what you are about to do may help elect Donald Trump president.” Comey: “Not for a moment can I consider it.” Why? Not for the good of the country, but because…
Comey considers how the reopened case would look after HRC won. “What would happen to the FBI?” Comey doesn’t consider that the problem isn’t answering this question, it’s asking it.
Now, because he screwed up by going public earlier, he HAS to go public again about the Weiner emails. “The credibility of the institutions of justice was at stake.” True. But that’s politics. And the credibility of those institutions is under far greater assault today.
Comey learns of the Weiner laptop and the new trove of emails relevant to the already-closed Clinton case. Smiles broadly to the email investigative team that the band is back together.
No written FBI rules about elections and cases, but Comey says there’s a “powerful norm” to avoid “any action…that could have an impact.” That, of course, presumes it shouldn’t have an impact…and avoiding such actions can, of course, have its own impact.
In September, Obama says of Putin: “He backed the wrong horse.”
Comey suspects the Obama Administration didn’t move quickly on deciding whether to tell U.S. about Russian actions because “the universal view of pollsters that Donald Trump had no chance.” (Polling, it turns out, is a self-correcting mechanism.)
Comey to Obama: Telling US about Russian intent to undermine confidence in our democracy might undermine confidence in our democracy. Another instance of Comey trying to litigate outcomes rather than letting chips fall—opposite of the values to which he holds “higher loyalty.”
Ch. 11-	Comey: “Putin wanted Trump to win.”	“Putin had shown a long-standing appreciation for business leaders who cut deals rather than stand on principle.”
We got a copy early, read it and found it very useful. Follow us for live-tweeting, @Comey...your friend @RayDalio might even call our commentary "accurate feedback"! https://t.co/zK1G23uRxl
Speaking to the country, Comey doesn’t lead with his recommendation to drop the case, because “nobody would listen to the rest of what I said”…which was all about defending the FBI and ensuring America thought well of the bureau. Y’know…politics.
Prior to his announcement on HRC, Comey emails the entire FBI: “As I send this, I am about to walk downstairs…” then acknowledges, “There is a lot of the pronoun ‘I’ above, but…”
Hillary Clinton was interviewed for three hours. Not on tape. Not under oath (though still under penalty of perjury). She was, Comey says, “unsophisticated” about the email technology.
After Lynch meets with Bill Clinton, Comey decides to go public about the case without DOJ, even though he knows Democrats will respond with “predictable stuff” about him “wanting the spotlight,” and being “driven by ego.” NB: He has already said these things are actually true.
Protecting the FBI’s reputation is a running theme at this point. Comey is blind to the idea that NOT letting that concern influence your behavior is what maximizes credibility and that LETTING it influence you is the height of what he claims to disdain most: Politics.
Six weeks til the election, Comey mulls how to close the case “in a way that maximizes public confidence that the institutions of justice have acted justly.” This is not his job. But Comey will save the FBI even if he has to put the panic button in the other room to do it.
Having told the public of the investigation, Comey now suggests to Sally Yates they might need “unusual transparency” to “reassure the American people” the case was unprosecutable. It’s Comey and the panic button all over again.
Here Comey drops a still-undetonated bombshell that right-wing media are feasting on: Still-undisclosed material that would have “cast serious doubt on [Lynch’s] independence in connection with the Clinton investigation.” Comey clarifies, however, that Lynch didn’t interfere.
Why didn’t Comey challenge Lynch on calling it “a matter”? “It was probably a mistake that I didn’t,” he says, but never asks whether the reason why is the one thing he claims everyone else has and he lacks: Politics.
Lynch’s directive on language sticks in Comey’s craw to this day. “The FBI didn’t do ‘matters’,” he writes (already famously). “The term means nothing in our language.” (On the next page he refers to the removal of HRC’s email software as “a routine matter.”)
Comey decides DOJ/FBI should confirm the existence of an investigation into Clinton’s emails. Not commenting, “seemed increasingly silly.” AG Lynch agrees he can reveal it, but tells him to call it “a matter” not an investigation.
Again Comey hits both sides (and unnamed “media”) for pursuing their own ends. His only end is truth.
Comey wanted to charge Petraeus with a felony. For that gravest of crimes in Comey’s mind: Lying to the Bureau. Comey’s point, that Petraeus’ conduct was considerably more grievous than Clinton’s.
To Comey, the motives of others are almost always partisan politics. HRC’s defenders, for instance, cited Powell’s use of a personal server “In an attempt to blur the seriousness of the case.” Comey makes the point that Powell’s emails did not include classified info.
Ch. 10-	Still clearly holds a grudge that Hillary Clinton didn’t meet with him when he became U.S. attorney for NY’s Southern District…possibly because she held a grudge about the Marc Rich investigation. Now we get to her emails…
What Comey calls a culture of truth and his “true listening,” will be needed when he deals with the 2016 election.
To get candor from the FBI, Comey does “silly” things (“all carefully thought out”) and eases the dress code, and urges leaders to reveal personal things…but it all comes off as him wanting them to like him, rather than to incentivize criticism, which you can do in other ways.
Comey on Impostor Syndrome: “If you don’t have this, in some measure, you are an incredible jerk and should stop reading immediately.”
Awkwardly concludes that, “A black person…helped me see through other eyes,” but never addresses how his own leadership style failed to get him that perspective in the first place. “When we were done, I was smarter,” he concludes.
Lauds Obama’s active listening…but spends more than a page explaining the difference between engaging and drawing someone out and waiting for them to stop speaking.
Comey clearly wants to make a good-faith effort on issues of systemic racism, implicit bias, and more…but faults those who disagree with him as having ulterior motives, not wanting to know the facts, etc…
“I had felt the pain and anger of black communities…” But then draws a parallel between the systemic act of police killing people of color and the individual actions of people killing police.
Ch. 9-	“Eric Garner. Tamir Rice. Walter Scott. Freddie Gray.” That’s the first paragraph of this chapter, which then goes on to justify not bringing charges in Ferguson.
Comey keeps a copy of Hoover’s memo seeking permission to spy on MLK on his desk, as a reminder not to blackmail people. He explains that Hoover and RFK lacked “meaningful testing of their assumptions…It is painful to stare openly at ourselves…”
…specifically, Dalio’s insistence on sharing negative feedback (which doesn’t exist, there is only “accurate” feedback). It’s another principle that Comey can adopt to justify taking a stand…but doesn’t explain the many instances he recounts of when he doesn’t.
Comey says almost zero about his FIVE YEARS in the private sector at Lockheed Martin and the Bridgewater hedge fund… except to reflect on his embrace of Bridgewater chief Ray Dalio and his semi-notorious approach to the workplace…
More Michael Scott-isms…he never cuts the line at the FBI cafeteria. Just one of the guys. A great guy. Trying to fit in. Not willing to accept that leading means you don’t get to fit in, that people will resent you because sometimes you HAVE to cut the line.
On the need for work-life balance, he warns that time with their loved ones is precious and actually says this: “I order you to love somebody.”
Talking about leadership within the FBI, Comey’s boundary issues flare up dramatically. Some samples from his remarks to the entire bureau on his first day as director:
Comey recognizes the diversity problem the FBI has, especially after 9/11 (though doesn’t connect those dots), and does something—apparently with some success—to remedy the situation.
He gets to have the drama, gets to be the good guy in it for doing the right thing, and gets to be the martyr for how it all somehow goes wrong. “She had touched the button. My bad.” Just put it in the nightstand.
…where his wife puts something on top of it, triggering a 2am rapid response from a team of armed FBI agents. It is Comey’s fear of and OVER-reaction to an imagined scenario that is precisely what makes it happen.
As FBI director, he had a panic button to call for help. “I was afraid of this thing.” He’s SO afraid of hitting it by accident while he sleeps in his hotel, that he puts it in ANOTHER ROOM, on a countertop…
Now we get an anecdote that strikes me as perhaps the best, most telling indicator of how and why Comey went so wrong and dragged so many with him. It’s a tiny, tiny moment, but contains multitudes…
“…a sense of humor [is]…indispensable in good leaders.” It is, Comey says, “an important indicator” about someone’s ego, about their balance between confidence and humility. (No indication in the book that he ever met a stand-up comic.)
Comey hits Mueller for checking in with staff after 9/11 with phone calls asking “How’re you doing?” “Fine.” “Good.” No recognition that maybe the boss shouldn’t be seeking moments of emotional release with his subordinates.
Discussing his intent to lead the FBI for his whole ten-year term, says, “What, I wondered, could possibly interfere with that?” Another passage that’s simultaneously clumsy and not entirely credible.
Comey clearly adores Obama. It reflects well on Comey throughout the book.
Ch. 8-	Obama nominates Comey as FBI director and extracts from Comey a promise to protect the president…’s access to the FBI gym! (Obama is not Trump.)
Comey hits Gonzales for waffling over practices that on their own do not constitute torture. You have to credit Comey for taking a stand on this, even if readers can infer that part of his motive is he likes taking stands. A great man who wants to fit in…
Ashcroft is out, Alberto Gonzales is in as AG. Comey speculates that Bush picks Gonzales to try to insulate the White House from whatever “problems” may come from DOJ—especially at a time when Cheney has taken them up to and over so many lines.
Comey’s wife, unaware of the classified details, but well aware of the news, adopts a mantra she repeats to her husband: “Don’t be the torture guy.” Comey never gets too mushy about her, but he does succeed in making her the closest thing the book has to a hero.
A good, insightful passage on America’s desire for strong, decisive leaders—which Comey couples with George Washington’s acknowledgment of his own errors. This, however, all in the context of assessing Cheney’s certainty, not his own.
Ch. 7-	Abu Ghraib. Slams Cheney for confirmation bias in turning to torture. “The Bureau had long ago concluded that coercive interrogations were of no utility…”
An interesting mediation here on threatening to resign. Comey says it feels like “cheating” to get a policy result or ethical outcome you think is required. The reasoning here feels off, though I’m not up to picking it apart at the moment.
“I say what the law is for the executive branch.” – Pres. George W. Bush.
It’s hard to overstate what a central, vivid role this story had at the time, but Comey’s own telling of it forces us to wonder whether it’s been magnified…initially as a result of Comey’s tendency to see things in dramatic terms that necessitate dramatic action. By him.
But there is no showdown. Comey doesn’t seem to see that his own telling suggests maybe there was never going to be. Maybe the White House was never going to do that. Maybe Ashcroft didn’t need the help in the first place…
Back to the Ashcroft race. Comey calls in the cavalry to come protect him in case the White House orders Secret Service to keep Comey away from Ashcroft. He calls FBI Director Mueller to have him authorize FBI agents into a showdown, if necessary, with the Secret Service.
Comey is no fan of Dick Cheney or Cheney’s chief of staff David Addington. These are good calls. Cheney tells Comey his opposition to the NSA surveillance means “Thousands of people are going to die.”
“Bush may have had a slight mean streak…but he understood that humor was essential to the high-stress, high-stakes business we were in.” In his repeated attempts to justify humor in the workplace, Comey ends up coming off as something close to Michael Scott from The Office.
Comey gives examples of humor in the workplace…his crack about a terrorist with two jobs as an example of Bush’s job creation… and weirdly both justifies and criticizes Bush’s nasty sense of humor after Bush enjoys watching his chopper cover waiting (freezing) press in snow:
But first! Comey gives us a sidebar on the importance of finding joy in work and laughter in the workplace. As a leader, he says, “…if I’m doing it right…there will be laughter in the workplace.” The context for this? Being deputy attorney general in the years after 9/11.
Ch. 6-	Comey sets us up for his version of one of the most amazing incidents in the Bush presidency—the race to get then-Attorney General John Ashcroft to sign off on…or to block…invasive surveillance and wiretapping techniques while the guy is near death in the hospital.
@Dakota_Schmidt Right. Popular in NY. Then unpopular in NJ.
Likewise, Comey claims that Democrats excused Bill Clinton’s perjury as “a silly lie about sex,” when in fact a number of Democrats stood up and said otherwise. Comey dismisses both parties consistently as somehow magically EXACTLY equal in hypocrisy and shameful partisanship.
“To Democrats, it was obvious that key members of a Republican administration were subverting justice to undermine and punish their critics.” Comey chides the Democrats as driven by partisan politics in this conclusion…and then explains why they were right.
The prosecution of Scooter Libby. No revelations, but good, timely detail. And frustrating false equivalence on the political reaction to Libby…
A truly bizarre side note about the high ceilings in the West Wing offices. “It always seemed to me that the architects got the space for those high ceilings by taking it from the levels above and below.” He did tell us earlier that he was smart.
Comey goes to the Situation Room. Colin Powell “barked” at him. “Yes, sir,” Comey “stammered” in response. It’s another implausible moment (how do you “stammer” “Yes, sir”?) that paints Comey as an aw-shucks kid in a big-city world.
…as if he couldn’t just say, “I think I smacked my head on the door frame there, let me go clean up and I’ll be right back.” When writ large, this dynamic will come to feel VERY revelatory later on.
Example of one of the many anecdotes Comey shares in which his instinct to conceal truth is justified by a strange expectation of dramatic, untenable results if he doesn’t. He hits his head at the White House and bobs his head about to stop blood from dripping down…
Because people no longer fear going to Hell for violating an oath sworn to God, “In its place, people must fear going to jail.”
At no point does Comey seem to question whether maybe the system shouldn’t focus on putting EITHER of them in jail for lying…but should perhaps be retooled so that Stewart’s underlying act of insider trading WOULD have put her in jail even IF she told the truth.
…who also had to go to jail for lying to law enforcement. It’s not fair, he concludes, to send people of color without means to jail for lying and not also send Stewart to jail for the same thing.
Comey goes into considerable detail explaining how easily Martha Stewart could have gotten off by just telling the truth. It was her decision to lie that sent her to jail. Comey defends that by comparing her case to the case of an unnamed black man…
Okay, quick correction. Here Comey DOES name some dishonest companies: Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia. But the trend he highlighted of dishonest boardrooms was present tense. Today. He still hasn’t named any.
Ch. 5-	This chapter is called “The Easy Lie.” He tells how people asked him so often if he played college basketball that it became easy just to say yeah, he did. To this day he doesn’t have one, clear explanation for why.
Hey all, we have the Comey book and are tweeting out highlights. No bombshells, but important themes Comey doesn't seem to see that helped get us here. (Commentary by managing ed. @JTLarsen.) Chapter five coming next...
9/11 and Comey is asked to serve as the U.S. attorney in New York.
Ch. 4-	The death of Comey’s infant son. It’s terrible and awful and heart-breaking.
Comey recounts an incident in which he joins a bunch of college peers bullying another student. “Finally, I belonged.” Admirably, he says he’s still ashamed. But never draws a thread between this and other instances he recounts of not standing his ground.
“Being an outsider…made me a better judge of people.” There's no evidence of this. The claim follows—and is followed by—spectacular misjudgments of people, himself included.
“…I was a kid just trying to fit in somewhere and be something.” Comey doesn’t see the inherent tension in these two goals. He doesn’t really want to fit in. He wants to be something. “A great man someday.” But he ALSO wants to fit in.
Another Gary Cooper father figure for young Comey. Grocery store owner Harry Howell. Now pages of anecdotes and detail we never get on his actual father, about minor store incidents that loom like mythology. Drama, all is drama.
Comey gives us a little bit about his parents and mother. His mother late in life shows him a note he wrote her at eight, after getting sent to his room. “I am sorry…I will be a great man someday.” You have to feel for the kid.
He says he got wedgied, but describing wedgies says, “If memory serves, a wedgie involves…” It ACTUALLY happened to him and he wants us to think he's fuzzy on the technical details. (NB: He gets it right, memory serves.)
Bullies, Comey says, “found me quickly. I’m not entirely sure why…but I was smart and verbal.” It all feels very disingenuous. He may not be “entirely sure,” but a good FBI agent will tell you “entirely” is a tell. He has some idea; he’s just not owning it.
Comey was a popular kid in New York—why? All he says is that his family had deep connections with the community and school. Then he’s unpopular in Jersey because his mother cut his hair and his pants were too short. Why wasn't that true in NY?
But first! We get Comey’s literally one and only specific reference to, “my father, Brien Comey.” We learn that Brien worked for a big oil company and knew New York area gas stations, until he got a new job in Jersey. THAT. IS. IT.
Ch. 3-	We’re back to Comey’s childhood, to explain why he doesn’t like bullies. In his words, he was “…a popular target for bullies.” We’re about to enter a section notably strange for lack of input from editors or anyone as to its narrative/logical gaps…
While prosecuting Al Sharpton, Comey is told by Giuliani, “I want the fucking medal” (Sharpton’s then-bling). Comey sees the dangers in Giuliani’s hubris…but doesn’t see the rebuke to his own belief in the FBI’s sanctity and political purity.
Time to shit on Giuliani. Comey starts off star-struck, but doesn’t come off well by simultaneously crapping on the “peril” of forgetting Giuliani was the star…and recounting how much “his brash style…fired me up.”
Comey’s takeaway: “Close call!” Doesn’t consider possibility that the agent saw the situation as safe. The allure of the extreme, dramatic interpretation of events will return, dear reader.
Comey tells one of many unwittingly revealing anecdotes. He’s in a scary situation and tells the agent he’s with he’s glad the agent had a gun. But the agent forgot his gun in the car.
…doesn’t acknowledge the pattern. It’s only Ch. 2 and already we’ve got Niebuhr, two Untouchable prosecutors and now Dick Cates as idols/role models/father figures. Where’s Comey’s actual dad?
Comey gets a role model in small-town lawyer Dick Cates. Comey’s affection seems genuine and earned. “This is the person I want to be,” he thinks, calling it “life-plagiarism.” It’s fascinating because he recognizes it here, but…
Comey is awed by seeing veteran prosecutors at work. “I was struck by lightning.” They “seemed to have no other motivation than tackling injustice and telling the truth.” Comey believes it. Of them and himself.
More on Comey’s days prosecuting the Mafia. The trial of Fat Tony Salerno. It turns out criminals lie, seek power, and seek the loyalty of others. Comey—now a grown man—concludes that these behaviors can manifest elsewhere in life, too.
Ch. 2-	“This Thing of Ours” is the chapter title. It’s literally about the Cosa Nostra. The lead-off aphorism is from Godfather II: “Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.” Whatever in this chapter deals with that quote, I missed it. Maybe it’s just a cool cliche?
Like Bruce Wayne seeing a bat crash through his window and declaring: “I shall become a bat,” Comey wraps his origin story with: “Lawyers participate much more directly in the search for justice. That route…might be the best way to make a difference.” Oh, dear reader…
Comey embraces Niebuhr’s conclusion: “…justice…could be best sought through the instruments of governmental power.” This leads us to The Secret Origin of James Comey.
College: Reinhold Niebuhr! And this pearl: “…human limitations make it impossible for any of us to really love another as ourselves…” Wait, what? Not the only head-scratcher he’ll present as universal truth.
Whenever he speaks to young people, he suggests: “Close your eyes…Sit there, and imagine you are at the end of your life.” This, he suggests, teaches them that “Making a difference…is true wealth.” No word on anyone this has actually helped.
“…that many of the things we think are valuable have no value.” He explains how he now imparts the lesson of this life-changing event:
Despite the lack of sexual assault or even establishing that it WAS the Ramsey Rapist, Comey gives us this unfortunate phrase: “The Ramsey Rapist taught me at an early age…”
Comey is able to call the police, but the gunman still gets away. By the end of the book, this does not seem like a coincidence.
In a bid to save their lives, “the lies came pouring out,” Comey says. He tells the burglar they hate their parents and so therefore don’t care what he takes and won’t tell on him. No, it doesn’t make sense in the book, either.
The parents aren't home. Comey’s younger brother doesn’t reveal that he has money on him. Comey tells the burglar where to find everything. You feel for the guy, but he never confronts it.
Comey tells the bizarre story of the Ramsey Rapist—who held him and his brother captive during a home invasion while Comey was a HS senior in suburban NJ. A truly terrifying experience--hard to see whether/how it affected him.
Ch. 1-	Comey takes us back to his days on the Mafia beat, setting up with painful literality the themes to which he’ll return: It turns out people lie and try to force loyalty from others.
“…the FBI is meant to stand apart from politics in American life. Its mission is to find the truth.” Comey never (knowingly) concedes the impossibility of the former and so never sees it coming when it collides with the latter. (New thread coming for Ch. 1.)
Now @Comey foreshadows—without once suggesting that he recognizes it—what he will again and again confirm as the fallacy at the heart of everything to follow…
Comey portrays FBI’s role in the election in passive terms. “Caught in the middle of the partisan bile.” “…sucked into the election.” It’s all passive, in a way that makes it feel like it had to happen, like it's beyond scrutiny.
Introduction-	Blasts Congress re the Russia hearing, as only hearing what they want to hear. He seems certain of this. So much for doubt=wisdom. NB: Politics is bad, BAD! Foreshadowing, people!
Truth, integrity, Comey says, are “more important” than profitability. Yet he says virtually nothing about his years at Lockheed Martin and the Bridgewater hedge fund (with a telling exception later).
“Doubt, I’ve learned, is wisdom.” @Comey explains this idea—it’s about the dangers of certainty—but acts on his certainty again and again throughout the rest of the book. Is also certain that he's learned doubt is wisdom...
“I can be stubborn, prideful, overconfident, and driven by ego. I’ve struggled with those my whole life.” But the book doesn't chronicle those struggles, and shows lack of self-awareness about when and how he is those things. Examples to come.
Author’s Note-	Comey says “fundamental truth” is being questioned everywhere: “…boardrooms of major companies, newsrooms…” Throughout the rest of the book he doesn't name any of them (minus some sly allusions and rare direct references to Fox).
