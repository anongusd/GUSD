Want to share your thoughts with us on the UNM Board of Regents decision to reinstate diving but cut 3 other sports? Get in touch with us - https://t.co/c80ERd40W7 #Lobos #UNM
Regents vote to approve cut to other sports (men’s soccer, beach volleyball and skiing) #UNM #Lobos
Regents vote to approve motion to reinstate diving (one vote against) #Lobos #UNM
Student Regent Garrett Adcock just made a motion to reinstate the diving team #UNM #Lobos
Director of Athletics Eddie Nuñez answering questions from regents now - % NM athletes on some teams, facilities for diving, holding coaches accountable for budgets #UNM #Lobos
A woman from the audience has stood up and is expressing her concern about overall budget issues at UNM.
Regent Quillen is discussing the history of incremental fiscal issues with athletics, promises of increased future revenue, but it hasn't happened. She is emphasizing that she feels that they should not "kick the can down the road."
Currently nationally 55% to 60% of college students are female. Projections show that in the future, that trend will continue, and more females will be attending higher ed.
A Regent is asking if anyone can speak to Title IX compliance, and if UNM is compliant. Stokes stresses that UNM pay "significant attention" to Title IX, because it is law, but also because it is an issue of gender equity.
Regent Quillen agrees that the athletics debt should not be forgiven, because many depts at UNM have dept, and "what about their debts?"
Regent Lee "This hasn't been a sharp dive off a cliff, we've had some time rolling."
The Regents are discussing if #UNM should forgive the #UNM athletics budget deficit. "I don't feel like it's fair to the faculty and students."
The Board is making a general commitment to staying in the Mountain West Conference.
A Regent brought up the question of if UNM should stay in the Mountain West Conference. Nuñez answers "We have certain limits with our geographical region," and that revenues from other conferences would not be in the same range as from Mountain West.
Regent Q &amp; A- Q: Have the Regents asked for funding from the legislature? A: UNM has been asking for funding from the #NMLeg for 6 years without receiving the funding.
Stokes wants to emphasize that these solutions were just sample proposals, nothing official.
The third scenario kept all sports, but did not pay back the current fiscal deficit or solve future fiscal problems.
A question from a Regent Board member- what was Rep. Ludstrom's proposal? A: The second scenario reinstated skiing and soccer, and add another women's sport, but did not solve where the money would come from, but increased the deficit.
Regents Board Member "We have looked at every angle to try and make this work." He is stating that UNM would need to wipe out academic fiscal reserves to "bail out" athletics.
Stokes says their was considerations concerning one time funding, but she wants the #UNM Athletics dept. to be sustainable. "Some will say that we should delay, but I will reiterate my concern about that." Stokes thinks that putting this off longer will leave students hanging.
"I met with Rep. Lundstrom...we had a conversation about their desire to find a solution...and understand very much that there are members of the leg that are hearing from their constituents about their concerns."
President Stokes speaks "Speaking with athletes and former athletes is an important part of the educational mission of the university."
Earl Alden, a community member who came to NM in 1930, wants to speak to how a cut to mens soccer would effect young children who attend games, as well as get involved and help return balls to the field. "Please do it for the children."
Angelica Anaya Allen, a community member, speaks to what others have said about the emphasis on the report to cut 4 specific teams, as opposed to evaluating the entire #UNM athletic dept as a whole.
Madeline Key, ASUNM member, bring up sports as a means of diplomacy, and addresses the negative effect to morale as a result of the proposed cuts.
Richard Nordhaus, professor emeritus at UNM and a ski supporter, says lessons from his career engaging with stakeholders on planning projects could be useful for #UNM now #Lobos
Paul L, a ski team supporter from Santa Fe, tells the regents that the team has an impact on the community and quality of life in New Mexico #UNM #Lobos
“We’re not proud of a lot of things in New Mexico … one of the privileges in my life was being a UNM athlete.” - Scott Gates, former UNM athlete #UNM #Lobos
Kyle Beasley, UNM Lobo Club, tells regents the club is under pressure but fundraising is going well. Praises Athletic Director Núñez #UNM #Lobos
Interim ski coach Joe Downing tells regents the ski team raised the bar for the department in academics &amp; he’s willing to continue leading the team #UNM #Lobos
“in layman’s terms, the decision to cut women’s volleyball was illegal” - UNM beach volleyball player says the team will fight efforts to cut the sport
The beach volleyball team stands in front of the UNM regents while a member argues that the team has a significant impact on the university &amp; students who leave NM might not come back https://t.co/pt2GZ9bjaI
@MayorKeller “..each of us defines all of us and I don’t want to be defined by this today” - a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee calls on regents to not cut teams #UNM #Lobos
@MayorKeller The mother of a UNM ski team member says the team has a great national reputation, for athletic achievement, academics &amp; attitude #UNM #Lobos
Alan Armijo from the office of @MayorKeller is delivering comments from the mayor in support of the teams, particularly soccer #UNM #Lobos
UNM retiree &amp; sports fan raising concerns in public comment about how cuts to sports might lower the overall GPA for student athletes #UNM #Lobos
Merna Bransta, UNM retiree and nurse, is speaking about a "failure of leadership at the top," "Do not be so quick to cut a finger off a hand when there is an infection, treat the infection first."
Dave Piercey, Pres. of APS Board of Education, is concerned with the cuts to UNM Soccer Team. Both of his sons played soccer through the college level, and he emphasizes that UNM Soccer is one of the only teams at UNM that can compete at the nat'l level.
Becca Myers, ASUNM President "For the last decade we've had these problems...We have to be heard, not only today but in the future. We all feel the direct effects of decisions like these."
Community member "I feel like this decision on your part further deteriorates our image as a state without looking at the facts."
UNM Swimming and Diving team members continue to speak "I urge you to truly consider the consequences of your actions."
Dark wants to make it clear how this will affect the community. Lobo diving club is the only in the state. Dark explains that the team consists of many top tier divers, and stresses that Weddle is an outstanding coach.
Natasha Dark, a diver in her junior year on the UNM Swimming and Diving team. "Without diving, the UNM swimming and diving team will have an almost impossible time winning any competitions."
Thalia Paserelli, a swimmer in her junior year on the #UNM Swimming and Diving team, is speaking about Title IX. "Roughly 55% of the students at this university are female...49% of athletes are female."
"We would have gone from 6th, all the way to last, if it weren't for our diving events."
Julie Weddle, head diving coach for UNM Swimming "We are one team, under the title 'swimming and diving.'" Weddle says that the diving team does not need a diving tower- 9 out of 10 teams in the MW conference do not have diving towers.
Walker, speaking on behalf of Women's Swimming and Diving "10 members of the Mountain West conference consist of swimming and diving...The elimination of diving means entering all events with a 32 point deficit."
James Urbany, alumni member of UNM Mens Soccer. He is saying that bc the report was released last minute, the public did not have time to review the report and he is concerned about a lack of transparency.
Taos Valley is prepared to invest heavily in infrastructure for the UNM ski team. "The ski team is successful, it has the support of the community...and it does very little to help your budget problem."
Chris Stag, Vice Pres. of Public Affairs for Taos Ski Valley, and #UNM alum. "In NM...we talk about where the Rockies begin, and the Rockies are the best mountains for skiing."
"You are willing to alienate virtually everyone of political importance in this state for a report that may or may not be accurate."
Williams is asking the Regents to look at the financials of the "alleged savings" of cutting the proposed teams, saying that revenue will be lost from students who are on these teams paying tuition.
Greg Williams "It is embarrassing that Rep. Patty Lundstrom was cut off today."
Another letter from Bobbie Clark, former head soccer coach from Notre Dame "I always viewed the Lobos as one of the top teams."
Amielle Touche is reading letters from soccer coaches around the country. "I am writing today to ask you to please reconsider your decision...I am extremely familiar with the excellence of your program."
Dr. Dwayne Kinsley, owner of Sports Systems, is at the mic and wants to talk about the economics of cutting #UNMAthletics. "We have some of the world class ski areas in New Mexico. Could you imagine a Colorado university cutting their ski team?"
Bill Wise, retired UNM faculty, "The health of New Mexico is my primary focus...These issues have to do with the health of our communities...Successful solutions require having shared goals."
"Now UNM's decision has put us in a very tough decision...Each of us can stay at UNM and finish our studies..Or each of us has to leave UNM..and give up our team mates here at UNM. We did not ask for this situation, but this is what we are faced with."
"We have also represented UNM to the best of our ability on the soccer field...striving to be the best Lobos we can be...We have also given many hours of our time to the community."
Tim Hicks is reading a letter from #UNM Mens Soccer, "Each of us remembers the day we were called to be on the UNM Soccer team...it was a dream come true."
"Do not cut soccer in a city where 60% of our first graders are Latino” - Rep. Moe Maestas in public comment, says supporters can turn out more fans #UNM #Lobos
