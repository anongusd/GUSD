Wow. The Sixers put on a clinic in how NOT to finish a team yet somehow hang on to beat the Pelicans 111-110. Sixers led by 110-100 with 2:48 left, then missed their final 5 FGs and 2 of 3 FTs down the stretch. But still held on.
During that last timeout, Saints Pro Bowl defensive end Cam Jordan just raced on the court and borrowed the T-shirt cannon from Pierre the Pelican and fired a couple of shots into the crowd.
The biggest story at the Smoothie King Center tonight might just be the absence of King Cake Baby. The Menace of Mardi Gras has been spotted in the concourse but has yet to make an appearance in the arena and we‚Äôre midway through the third quarter.
Cat calls and boos great Anthony Davis as he entered the game in the second quarter. The Pels could use him. They trail 45-30.
The entire Smoothie King Center is in awe of Boban Marjanovic, the Sixers‚Äô towering 7-3 freak of nature. Marjanovic has 4 points and 3 rebounds off the bench and the Sixers lead 31-24 after one quarter of play. Ben Simmons also putting on a show with  8 points and 6 rebounds.

Cheick Diallo is 8 for 8 from the field and has 18 points and 9 rebounds in 17 minutes of work. The Pelicans, meanwhile, have opened a 108-91 lead on the Lakers and are cruising to victory.
Holiday buries a rainbow 3 at the end of the third quarter and the Pelicans will take a 100-84 lead into the fourth quarter. The Lakers look like they spent Friday night on Bourbon Street.
@gregcruice Ha. Still have plenty of time to get there after the game for dinner.
The Pelicans are scoring at will against the Lakers' half-hearted defense. Pels are shooting 52 percent from the field, 44 percent from 3-point range and already have 24 assists. They lead 85-72 and there‚Äôs still 6:08 left in the 3rd quarter.
Pels take a 69-57 halftime lead over the Lakers into the locker room. Julius Randle leads all scorers with 15 points.
The defense has rested so far. Pels shooting 66 percent from the field. Lakers at 61. Both teams on pace for high scoring outputs. Pels lead 52-42 and there‚Äôs 8:40 left still.
The Pelicans are en fuego. They‚Äôve hit 16 of 23 field goals for 70 percent, fueling an early 42-35 lead on the Lakers.
@Ogrejob @Saints Any compensatory picks would come at this time next year. All depends on how well Bridgewater plays and produces.

The scene at the PMAC after LSU‚Äôs dramatic 82-80 OT win against Tennessee. https://t.co/sWlHVyuaVM
The state of Louisiana finally got a call.
Javonte Smart with an epic performance in this one. The freshman from Scotlandville has a career-high 29 points, including what looks like the game-winning free throws.		LSU leads 82-80 with 0:00.6 seconds left.
Whoa. Crazy mistake there by UT. He fouls JaVonte Smart with 0:006 seconds left and he will go to the line with the game tied 80-80. LSU has a chance to pull this out. Crazy.
Drama everywhere at the PMAC. Javonte Smart and Grant Williams trade driving layups and we‚Äôre tied at 77 with 37.7 seconds left. LSU ball with 13.3 seconds difference in the shot clock and game clock.
And LSU is going to its sixth OT of the season and fifth in SEC play.
It looked like Grant Williams hit Skylar Mays across the head on that last 3-point attempt but the officials let them play. Will Wade was livid.
LSU has played 5 OT games already this season, four in the SEC. Tied at 71, we are 8.5 seconds away from another extra period. LSU ball under its own basket with 4 seconds on the shot clock.
Skylar Mays has played every second of this game. He has 21 points and a chance to add 2 more here at the FT line and give LSU its first lead since late in the first half. 69-69, 44.7 seconds left.
We have dramatic finish ahead at the PMAC. Game tied at 69, LSU ball with 58 seconds left. The Tigers have a chance to take their first lead since 31-30 with 3:27 left in the first half.
Skylar Mays hits a huge 3 from the top of the key to tie it at 69 and this place is going nuts.
Smart with the he drive and bucket. Its 67-66 and the crowd is going bonkers. Grant Williams with a pair of big foul shots coming. 2:21 left.
LSU is really struggling to get a key rebound down the stretch here.
Javonte Smart is playing the game of his life as the Tigers‚Äô PG in place of Tremont Waters. He has played all but 30 seconds of the game has 19 points, 4 rebounds &amp; 4 assists. At times he has looked exhausted but is showing a lot of guts.
Huge 3 by Smart and Will Wade calls a quick TO to keep the momentum going for LSU. Vols lead is trimmed to 64-60, 4:35 left. Tigers refusing to go away.
Tennessee is pounding LSU on the glass. The Vols now have a 37-26 rebounding advantage. Lead 64-57, 5 minutes left.
Admiral Schofield is killing LSU. He now has 25 and is 10-of-15 from the field. Entered the game averaging 16.5 points a game. UT leads 61-55, 7:09 left.
Every time LSU makes a mini-run Tennessee answers with a bucket to quiet the crowd and stem the momentum. Vols are a veteran, battle-tested team.		UT leads 58-53, 7:41 left.
LSU has turned this game into a street fight. Tennessee squanders a golden chance to open up some distance by missing both free throws and then turning it over. UT leads 49-44, but the PMAC crowd is just waiting to go off. LSU Is a big play away from igniting this place.
LSU is desperately trying to get Naz Reid going. He has 0 points and is struggling to establish anything inside against Grant Williams. Not sure the Tigers can win this one without Reid getting involved.
KBW with a pair of big dunks just when LSU desperately needed it. Vols were leading 41-32 and threatening to pull away. Not it‚Äôs 41-36, timeout UT, 16:15, 2nd half.
Good news/bad news for LSU. Tigers fail to score in the final 3 minutes of the first half and go to halftime trailing 36-31. The good news is they survived fairly well considering they played most of the first half without Naz Reid, who will return in the 2nd half.
Freshman Darius Days drains a jumper to give LSU a 29-28 lead and sticks his tongue out at the Tigers‚Äô student section. Timeout, 3:42 left in the first half. LSU 29-28.
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen the rest of the way, but LSU will not lose this game because of a lack of intensity. Will Wade‚Äôs message to the Tigers after the Florida loss hit home.
The PMAC is going berserk after that Skylar Mays‚Äô 3 to tie it at 18.
Darius Days buries a huge 3 from the top of the key and is fouled. Potential 4-point play coming for the Tigers after the early TV timeout. Tennessee leads 10-7, 15:39, 1st half.
Tough start for LSU. Nad Reid goes to the bench with 2 fouls four minutes into the game. LSU already playing without Tremont Waters and now most likely Reid for the rest of the first half.
@TravisMenard00 All good.
@noladt Reported as an illness.

LSU coach Will Wade pulled no punches after the Tigers‚Äô 82-77 OT loss to Florida. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost two homes and are 7-0 on the road (in the SEC). It‚Äôs absolutely sickening to me. Sickening.‚Äù Asked if he saw his team‚Äôs lack of focus coming, ‚ÄúHell, yeah."
Florida pulls off the upset 82-77 in OT over LSU.
@adamsgroove Shoutout to Randall Gay!
Check that. The Tigers aren‚Äôt dead yet. Tremont Waters hits a 3 from Brusly and LSU is within 80-77 with 19.4 seconds left.
That should just about do it. Florida leads 78-71 with 37 seconds left and is going to the line. PMAC crowd is emptying.
Three straight 3s by KeVaughn Allen has LSU on the ropes in OT. Gators lead 76-71, 57.9 left.
LSU is going to its fifth OT of the season. The good news for the Tigers. They have won three consecutive overtime contests.
LSU with a huge defensive stop. Tigers will have 5.7 seconds to win this one. Tied at 64.
PMAC is rocking after that Reid 3. LSU will have a 60-57 lead entering the final 3:18. Florida is pesky. Not going away easily.
Huge shot. https://t.co/t6V0h6SiPD
Whoa. Marlon Taylor with a soaring two-handed slam, puts the Tigers back on top 57-55. That will make the highlight reels.
LSU now has 14 offensive rebounds and 15 second-chance points. A big reason they lead 55-52.		Or DID lead. Now tied 55 all.
Will Wade just asked the official ‚ÄúWhat are you watching?!‚Äù after that last goal-tend call on Kavell Bigby-Williams.
LSU is working Florida on the offensive glass to stay in this one. The Tigers have 9 offensive rebounds so far, which is allowing them to stay in the game despite shooting just 40 pct from the field. Gators are 13 of 24 from the field (54 percent). Florida leads 31-26, 3:23, 1st.
LSU getting a huge lift from its bench. Freshmen Javonte Smart and Darius Days have combined to go 5 for 6 from field for 10 points and help LSU pull within 22-19, 7:09, 1st half.
Make that Florida 13-5.
This game has started exactly like LSU coach Will Wade DID NOT want. Florida controlling the pace and tempo. LSU is 2 for 8 from the field and is really struggling to solve the Gators‚Äô half-court defense. Florida leads 8-5 early.

@BenHoffmanNYT Agreed. Maybe some alternative, though. Last two minutes of each half and in overtime. Or just in postseason games. Or maybe just allow each coach to issue one officiating challenge per game. But I agree that we don‚Äôt want to over-officiate the game any more than it already is.

Just a brutal loss for the Saints. Stunning non-call in the final minutes and then a pair of clutch scoring drives by the Rams and Jared Goff to tie, then win the game.
Saints see their seven-game home postseason losing streak snapped.
Marcus Peters gets the last laugh after all. The Rams rally from a 13-0 deficit and stun the Saints 26-23 in OT to advance to their first Super Bowl since 2002
Marcus Peters just ran over and hugged Sean Payton and said something to him after Zuerlein‚Äôs game-winning field goal. Cam Jordan got in his face and players had to separate the two. Crazy scene.

Sorry. Garrett Griffin that TD grab.
Brees connects with Zach Line in the end zone and the Saints extend their lead to 13-0, 1:35, 1Q.
It is, indeed, gumbo week in NOLA. Saints connect again on third down. Again on Marcus Peters.
Injuries adding up quickly for Saints. First Craig Robertson. Now Josh Hill, with a potential head injury. Hill was just taken to the Saints locker room for evaluation.
Morten Andersen has a career in professional wrestling if he ever chooses to come out of retirement.
Saints settle for another field goal and take a 6-0 lead.
And just like that, a mistake. Ball slips through Todd Gurley‚Äôs hands and Demario Davis makes the pick. Saints take over at the Rams 16. Dome goes absolutely bonkers.
The Rams are finding out what the Dome-field advantage is about right now. Superdome is deafening‚Ä¶.
The Rams doubled Michael Thomas on that last third down pass, forcing Brees to go to an alternative option. Second-year TE Dan Arnold just missed a spectacular TD grab in the back on the end zone. Perfectly placed pass by Brees.
Saints take an early 3-0 lead. No slow start this week.

My column‚Ä¶		They say fortune favors the bold, and Saints‚Äô Sean Payton proved them right		Link: https://t.co/Kqc92LBL5G https://t.co/NwuUeB9u5i
Someone needs to check the geology department at Tulane University. I think the Earth just shook in #NOLA on that Lattimore INT.
Sean Payton was not happy with that last third down play. He barked at Drew Brees as he came off the field. Wondering if Brees changed the play at the line of scrimmage. Eagles blew it up in the backfield and forced a long field goal try, which Will Lutz missed wide right.
Michael Thomas has 12 catches for 171 yards and a TD.
Ball game
Since the opening two series, the Eagles have not gained more than one first down on any of their seven drives.
The Eagles defense is gassed.
Since starting the game 0 for 3, Drew Brees is 21 for his last 26 for 251 yards and 2 TDs. His passer rating is now 107.1.
The Saints have seized control of this game &amp; are starting to impose their will on the Eagles defense.		Since the the first two drives of the game, the Saints have outgained the Eagles 306-54 in total yards &amp; 19-3 in first downs.		Saints now lead 17-14.
Andrus Peat is playing hurt with a right hand injury. He‚Äôs struggling as you would expect but showing admirable toughness.
Since starting the game 0 for 3, Drew Brees is 17 for 21 for 205 yards and a TD.
The Eagles are only rushing four DL and asking them to get home. When they don‚Äôt get pressure, Brees is able to pick apart their zone defense.
Since scoring TDs on their opening two drives, the Eagles‚Äô past drives have ended this way:		INT	Punt	Punt	End of half	Punt

@lukedowden @Saints @Kirkwood_Five Thanks. Much appreciated, Luke.
Think the Superdome doesn‚Äôt have an effect on these games? The decibel meter just peaked at 128 before that last false start on the Eagles.
Epic drive by the Saints. They convert a fourth-and-1 on a fake punt, then a fourth-and-goal for a TD to Keith Kirkwood. 		We have a ballgame now: 14-7 Philly.
No doubt Payton is going to go for this here on fourth-and-goal at the 2.
Brutal... https://t.co/24d2GftAsu
The Eagles are winning but they have already lost Brandon Brooks and Rasul Douglas just got carted off the field with an unspecified injury. And now Fletcher Cox is down with an injury.
Taysom Hill with the huge fake punt for the first down and the Superdome erupts.
And then Lattimore comes up with the huge INT.
Lattimore is back in. Looked like he might have just taken a low blow.
Matshon Lattimore was injured on that last completion to Jeffrey. He‚Äôs out. Ken Crawley in in his place.
Just a reminder, the Saints fell behind the Vikings 17-0 in their divisional playoff game last season and rallied. Plenty of time to rally.
And the nightmarish first quarter for the Saints finally comes to an end. Eagles lead 14-0 and will have the ball at their own 30 to start the second. 		Saints defense desperately needs to make a play to get the crowd into it.
That‚Äôs going to be a sack-fumble recovery by Ramczyk. The Saints are going to have to punt.
Graham never had possession of the ball.
Good grief. New Brees fumbles the snap and Jenkins drops him for a 4-yard loss.
Who saw this start coming‚Ä¶?		Nick Foles: 8-9, 113 yards, 1 TD, 0 INTs. Rating: 155.8.		Drew Brees: 0-3, 0 yards, 0 TDs, 1 INT. Rating: 0.00.
The Eagles are owning both lines of scrimmage so far.
The Eagles take a two-touchdown lead and the Superdome is stunned.
Classic back-shoulder throw by Foles to Alshon Jeffrey who beat Marshon Lattimore in single coverage.
RT @SaintsNOW: Sheldon Rankins being carted off field #Saints #Eagles @MichaelDeMocker https://t.co/Y3x8p7SMTJ
And the bad news just continues for the Saints. Sheldon Rankins injured his left leg and is being carted from the field.
The Eagles offensive line is opening some serious holes in the run game so far.
Eagles head coach Doug Peterson has done an impressive job of play-calling so far. Keeping the Saints defense off balance with misdirection and mixing up the run and pass well.
Drew Brees starts the game 0 for 3 with an INT. Eagles couldn‚Äôt ask for a better start than this.
Saints free safety Marcus Williams took a poor angle on that long TD connection from Foles to Matthews.
Eagle strike first, a beautiful pass from Foles to Jordan Matthews from 37 yards out. Philly takes a 7-0 lead, 10:41, 1Q.
Stunner. Drew Brees opens the game with an INT by LeBlanc, just the second interception Brees has thrown at the Superdome all season.

That UCF TD connection right before the end of the half reminds me of Cam Newton to Ted Ginn Jr. vs. Saints in 2016.
Good Lord, what a throw and catch.
Something needs to be done about the college targeting rule. Players should not be ejected for split-second, bang-bang plays where there is no malicious intent. Maybe use the NBA flagrant foul rule as a guideline.
LSU‚Äôs best defense from now on might just be its offense. Tigers need to continue to control the ball and eat clock.
Alabama would score 100 on this UCF defense.
Joe Burrow is one tough son of a gun.
The Central Florida defense has tackling issues, to say the least.
Slowly but surely, LSU‚Äôs offensive line is starting to take control of the line of scrimmage. Bodes well for LSU in the second half.
Central Florida‚Äôs trickery and hurry-up offense is imploding on itself.
Huge answer for LSU and Burrow. This is fun.
Welcome to the Fiesta Bowl, Devin White.
No controversy there. Easy DPI call on Alexander.
And LSU takes advantage of UCF‚Äôs blunder. Beautiful pitch and catch from Burrow to Jefferson.		Tigers respond: 14-10.
One thing is for sure: We‚Äôre going to see what Joe Burrow is made of here. Test of his mettle coming up.
LSU wanted to seize the lead and use its rushing attack to control the clock vs. UCF.		Time for Plan B.
So Devin White‚Äôs hit on Nick Fitzgerald is targeting.		But that hit isn‚Äôt?!
Ed Orgeron is yelling on the sideline: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs targeting!"
Disastrous sequence for LSU. Pick 6 and Joe Burrow is lit up on the return.
Not a great start for the LSU run defense. Central Florida moving the ball at will. Time for Dave Aranda to adjust the screws.
For a big dude, DJ Mack has some nimble feet. Impressive.
That‚Äôs a disappointing result for LSU, which feels it can run the ball on UCF‚Äôs undersized defense today. A field goal gives the Tigers a 3-0 lead.
Not a bad start for LSU.

Sean Payton did not try to downplay or sugar coat the Saints‚Äô 33-14 loss to the Panthers. ‚ÄúWe can try to spin this thing any way we want to, but we played poorly. It‚Äôs disappointing.‚Äù
Ken Crawley is still in midseason form.
The Saints score and maintain their 16-year streak of consecutive games without being shut out. It‚Äôs the fifth longest streak in NFL history.
Prediction: The ball is going to Michael Thomas on the first play of the fourth quarter.
Kyle Allen is playing his tail off today. What a throw.
@halungar Official word on Lattimore is coaches‚Äô decision.
@halungar Didn‚Äôt see him get injured. No updates on him in the press box.
Mike Thomas was not happy about that last overthrow from Teddy Bridgewater. He was wide open and the catch would have given him enough yardage to break Joe Horn‚Äôs season record for yards.
Uh, I think I‚Äôd get Michael Thomas out of the game. Record or no record, they don‚Äôt need to risk an injury to him.
Trust me, Sean Payton is not going to be a happy camper after this first half. 		Panthers lead 23-0.
The Saints are making a great case for Drew Brees‚Äô MVP campaign today.
Allen‚Äôs TD pass to Ian Thomas gives Carolina a 20-0 lead. 		This is the largest deficit the Saints have faced all season.
Kyle Allen looks like Joe Montana out here today.
The Saints‚Äô starting defense isn‚Äôt going to enjoy watching this game film, assuming they actually watch it.
This is the largest deficit the Saints have faced since trailing the Cowboys 13-0 at halftime in Week 13. Its the second largest deficit they‚Äôve faced at home this season. They trailed Tampa Bay 31-17 in the opener.
The Panthers offense is staying on the field so clearly they think it‚Äôs an incomplete pass. Play is under review.
Close call on that last TO. Looked like Allen‚Äôs arm might have been going forward.
Cam Jordan and Sheldon Rankins are back on the field for the Saints.
It was about as quiet as I‚Äôve heard the Superdome before that last offensive snap by the Saints. Eerie.
Panthers take a quick 7-0 lead on a Kyle Allen sneak. 		Teddy time...
After watching Alex Okafor go down with a injury, the Saints pull Cam Jordan off the field. Jordan is standing on the sideline without his helmet.
Rankins jogged off the field and is now being evaluated in the injury tent.
Uh, that‚Äôs not what the Saints want to see. Sheldon Rankins goes down with an injury on the first snap from scrimmage.
@rsl9595 @ZachStrief The Alabamas and Clemsons of the world would come back to the pack over time when you open up the competition. Right now it‚Äôs an exclusive country club at the top.
The Panthers-Saints game today features 1 QB (Kyle Allen) who has thrown 4 passes in his NFL career vs. another QB (Teddy Bridgewater) who has thrown three regular-season passes in the past 3 years.
Re: Cam Jordan &amp; Drew Brees, consider this:		The Saints have been able to count on having their 2 best players in the starting lineup for all but 2 games of the past 8 years. 		Brees &amp; Jordan‚Äôs durability, reliability &amp; availability should never be taken for granted.
@Connor6648 @ZachStrief They also play 16-team playoffs in all other levels of college football and have been playing them for decades.

My quick take on the Saints‚Äô dramatic win against the Steelers‚Ä¶.		Link: https://t.co/Xa4lI09rax https://t.co/h1BbzvxmGG
Payton gets a Gatorade bath. It‚Äôs been awhile since we‚Äôve seen that.
Fumble recovered by the Saints. The Saints will win.		And the road to Super Bowl LIII in will go through New Orleans in the NFC.
If the Saints stop the Steelers on this fourth down the Superdome might implode.
TD. Saints take a 31-28 lead and the Steelers will have 1:25 left to try to get a game-tying field goal. They have zero timeouts.
That looks like a TD to me. Saints will take a 30-28 lead pending XP.
Brees Leap time
Ted Ginn Jr. welcomes himself back into the Saints lineup with a big 25-yard catch on third-&amp;-20.
The Terrible Towel is taking on new meaning in the Superdome right now.		Saints get a huge DPI on Joe Haden to stay alive.
Steelers overpower rookie Will Clapp with a double-team and get through to block Will Lutz‚Äôs field goal, ending a streak of 26 consecutive makes for the Saints kicker. Steelers hang on to their 28-24 lead.
Looks like the runner‚Äôs right knee was down.
Big review here. Hard to tell but it looked like the runner‚Äôs knee was down before the ball came out.
The Steelers are lighting up the Saints secondary right now. The Saints are on their heels.
This game is a big-boy heavyweight matchup. Stars  on both sides making big-time plays. Man to man, buckle up your helmet and go at it. Great stuff.
Stelers DC Keith Butler has sent a number of delayed blitzes and CB blitzes today. Steelers finally got home.
Big Ben: 22-34, 240, 2 TDs, 0 INT. Rating: 105.0.		Brees: 16-21, 211, 0 TDs, 0 INTs. Rating 107.4.		Not a lot of balls on the ground in this one‚Ä¶.
Anyone still worried about the Saints‚Äô offense?
Crossing route. Mike Thomas. Rinse, repeat.
Alvin Kamara and Michael Thomas have combined to catch 10 of Drew Brees‚Äô 15 completions for 161 of his 203 passing yards.
Joe Haden is a cornerback. And he can‚Äôt cover Alvin Kamara.
Cam Jordan fired his helmet into the ground and was as animated as I‚Äôve seen him after that last Steelers score. Clearly upset about that breakdown in coverage.
Like I said, like an alley cat. You can‚Äôt knock him off his feet.
Cam Jordan got highly animated on the Saints bench after that last Steelers scoring drive. He clearly was upset about the miscommunication on the TD. He &amp; DeMario Davis and even Sean Payton getting emotional.
That was a monster drive by the Steelers. 97 yards for the TD. Might have saved the game and perhaps their season.
JuJu Smith-Schuster clearly is not 100 percent. Really can‚Äôt motor with that groin injury.
That 56-yard punt by Thomas Morstead was the gridiron equivalent of dropping a 2-iron the 12th green at Augusta National. What a punt.
Punt of the year. Wow.
Saints are running crossing route after crossing route on the Steelers defense.
Alvin Kamara is like an alley cat. NFL defenders can‚Äôt knock him off his feet.		Kamara gives the Saints a 14-6 lead, 10:22, 2Q.
Terron Armstead leaves the game. It appears to be the same right pectoral injury that sidelined him before.
It appears the Steelers defense did not get the memo on Michael Thomas.
The Saints will trade TDs for FGs with the Steelers all day. 7-6 Saints lead, 14:05, 2Q.
Eli Apple lost his footing and left Vance McDonald wide open for a big gain. Marcus Williams saves a TD.
Terrific play by Marshon Lattimore, running stride for stride with Antonio Brown to break up that deep ball.
NO way Alvin Kamara was going to catch that Hail Mary. Ball sailed over his and Haden‚Äôs head. Essentially a 33-yard penalty and free 7 points.
Saints take advantage of a gift DPI call on Joe Haden vs. Alvin Kamara and Mark Ingram punches in the 1-yard TD. Saints lead 7-3.
This is the first time the Saints have trailed at home since Week 2 vs. the Cleveland Browns.
There are A LOT of Steelers fans in the Superdome today.
That pass by Taysom Hill hung in the air like a dying quail. Steelers INT.
Looks like Andrus Peat will slide out to right tackle and rookie Will Clapp will take Peat‚Äôs spot at left guard.
Another Saints OL down. Ryan Ramczyk.

Break out the broom. The Saints have now won four consecutive games vs. the Panthers. They‚Äôll go for No. 5 in 13 days at the Superdome.
Unbelievable. Tommylee Lewis fumbles the ball out of bounds while going into the end zone. Carolina will take over at the 20, pending review. They‚Äôll have 1:44 left with zero timeouts to try to get a game-tying FG attempt.
Taysom time...
Brees Leap time?
Drew Brees is a master.
The Saints have dominated all night on the ground. They‚Äôre a TD away from putting this one away.
Brees was drilled by Julius Peppers and Kirkwood was laid out, as well. Gain of 19. First down. Easily the biggest offensive play of the game for the Saints.
What a play‚Ä¶.
If Christian McCaffrey doesn‚Äôt do it, then nobody else seemingly can for the Carolina offense. It‚Äôs been a one-man show for the Panthers tonight on offense.
Donte Jackson returns the 2-point conversion INT 99 yards and the Panthers close the Saints gap to 12-9. Amazing.
Taysom to the rescue ‚Äî again.
We go to the fourth quarter with Carolina clinging to a 7-6 lead. I think the under is in pretty good shape.
Another huge takeaway in the red zone and the Saints take over at the 16. Big-time play and hustle by Vonn Bell.
Looked like Newton got that pretty easily. Good challenge by Rivera.
Huge mistake by the Panthers, reminiscent of Randy Gregory. The roughing call gives the Saints offense new life and possession of the ball at the 45.
The Saints young WRs are having a tough night so far.
#SundaySean has shown up on Monday night. Payton just gave Tre‚ÄôQuan Smith an earful after he dropped that last play.
Thomas Davis and Max Unger collided helmets at the end of that last play. Unger clearly took the worst of it. He‚Äôs been an iron man for the Saints for most of the past two seasons.
Max Unger is down for the Saints. Cam Tom coming into the game.
That was textbook coverage technique by Eli Apple on that pick.
Great interception by Eli Apple in single coverage on Devin Funchess.
Not the greatest clock management there by Carolina.
That‚Äôs the second game in a row in which Brees has been picked right before halftime.
Saints get the ball back with 2:08 left at midfield. They have one timeout to work with.
The Saints DL is dominating the Panthers OL.
This game is getting chippy. Even Taysom Hill just got into it with a Panthers special teamer after that last punt. You know it‚Äôs getting emotional when the mild-mannered Hill starts getting involved.
Taysom Hill was 40 yards downfield on that last pass play.
The Saints are winning first down. Now about third down‚Ä¶.
RT @ByLukeJohnson: First quarter is done in Charlotte. Saints trailing 7-3.
Terrific blocking sets up a big 50-yard kickoff return by Alvin Kamara and the Saints have great field position to start their second drive.

Former Saint Chris Manhertz with the 50-yard TD catch ‚Äî the first of his career ‚Äî on a trick play and the Panthers strike first.
Kirkwood called on the pick play there. He contacted the defender more than 1 yard from the LOS.

RT @AlbertBreer: Interim coach Gregg Williams (4-2) now has as many wins in 6 games as the Browns had in their previous 51 games (4-46-1).
From what I‚Äôve been able to gather, this is how the Saints graded the top QB prospects in the 2018 NFL Draft:		1. Darnold	2. Mayfield	3. Allen	4. Rosen	5. Jackson		They didn‚Äôt have anyone graded nearly as high as Mahomes in 2017.		I think they pretty much nailed it.

An ebullient Tulane athletic  director ‚Å¶@TU_Dannen‚Å© with the 2018 Cure Bowl trophy after the Green Wave‚Äôs 41-24 victory against Louisana-Lafayette on Saturday. https://t.co/O7BNkmt7e9
Tulane football coach Willie Fritz celebrates the Green Wave‚Äôs first bowl victory in 16 years. https://t.co/vQQK2DFD1w
Final: Tulane 41, Louisiana-Lafayette 24. The Green Wave celebrates its first bowl win since 2002.
Justin McMillan puts it away with a 16-yard touchdown run on fourth down. Tulane leads 41-24, 3:06 left.
Big sack there by Cam Sample and that should just about do it. Tulane takes over at the ULL 19, 3:28 left, leading 34-24.
Barring a miraculous comeback by the Ragin‚Äô Cajuns, Darius Bradwell is the clear Cure Bowl MVP. He has a career-high and Tulane bowl record 149 rushing yards and 2 TDs.
Darius Bradwell punches it in from the 4 and the Green Wave take a 34-24 lead with 3:49 left.
And there‚Äôs the first flag on the Ragin‚Äô Cajuns. A DPI gives Tulane a first down at the ULL 33.
ULL showing some impressive pluck. The Ragin‚Äô Cajuns have fought back from a 24-7 deficit to within 27-24, 10:16, 4Q. The Green Wave are going to need an answer here on offense because ULL has the clear momentum.
We almost made it to the fourth quarter before the first penalty. Tulane false start with 0:56 left in third quarter.
Upon further review, Encalade‚Äôs elbow hit the ground. Good call by the officials, who still, by the way, have yet to call a penalty.
@BraxtonPLighter Yes. On review you can see it.
That looks like a TD for Encalade. He never touched the ground. But not sure the officials can do anything about it if they blew an inadvertent whistle.
This is the first time we‚Äôve actually heard from the officials in any way here today.
Justin McMillan will want that one back. Had Encalade wide open for a TD and just sailed it out of bounds.
And the comeback is in full swing now as Jones loses a fumble for Tulane and the Ragin‚Äô Cajuns recover it.
This game is eerily similar to Tulane‚Äôs game against Navy a few weeks ago. Tulane seemingly had total control of the game, then a big INT by McMillan turned the momentum. Green Wave needed a desperate rally to pull it out.
ULL punches in a 3-yard TD run and the Ragin‚Äô Cajuns are right back in this one. It‚Äôs 24-17 Tulane but ULL has the momentum, 9:46, 3Q.
Big fourth-down stop by ULL and the Ragin‚Äô Cajuns have the clear momentum here. They take over in their territory after their second consecutive defensive stop of the Tulane offense.
Tulane has a good one in freshman running back Amare Jones. Kid can play. Runs back the second-half kickoff 46 yards to put Tulane in great field position to start the final half.
@jthannan JINX!
The teams combined for zero penalties and just one turnover in the first half. Tulane leads Louisiana-Lafayette 24-10 at halftime of the Cure Bowl.
RT @ByLukeJohnson: Terron Armstead was not out at practice today. We will get an official injury report later this afternoon.
Huge mistake by Tulane QB Justin McMillan there. Throws an INT into double-coverage just before halftime with the Green Wave threatening to put the game away. Long return gives Lafayette life and a chance to trim into the lead before halftime. ULL at the Tulane 37, 0:23, 2Q.
Louisiana-Lafayette had 75 yards on its opening drive. The Ragin‚Äô Cajuns have 15 total yards since.
At the risk of a total hex‚Ä¶. Neither team has been called for a single penalty so far.		We have 7:09 left in the second quarter. Tulane leads Louisiana-Lafayette 24-7.
@Bernmeisternola Agreed.
Tulane scores again to extend its lead to 21-7. Three possessions, three scores. The Green Wave leads 21-7, 0:48, 1Q.
Justin McMillan shows off his arm strength with a bullet to Terren Encalade on a short out route and he breaks it down the sideline untouched for a 38-yard TD. Green Wave leads 14-7, 5:21, 1Q.
Tulane answers with a 15-yard touchdown run by Darius Bradwell and the Green Wave tie the game at 7, 9:49, 1Q.
Raymond Calais busts loose around left end and goes untouched for a 38-yard touchdown run. ULL takes an early 7-0 lead, 12:25, 1Q.

Sean Payton taking extra time to celebrate the Saints‚Äô NFC South Division title with his team before addressing the media. He‚Äôs still in the team‚Äôs postgame locker room.
The Bucs have three first downs and 32 total yards in the second half.
The Bucs are hemorrhaging yellow flags.
I‚Äôd love to see the success rate of the Brees‚Äô leap. I can‚Äôt recall it ever not working.
Works. Every. Time.
The Saints defensive line is eating the Bucs OL for lunch right now. They can not block them.
The Saints finally get into the end zone and they‚Äôre squarely back in this one.
Taysom Hill with the big blocked punt and the Saints have life.
The Saints simply can not run the ball on the Bucs.
Bucs fail to take advantage of the takeaway. Santos shanks his FG wide right. Big break for the Saints, who take over at the 30.
Brutal start to the second half. Nassib knocks ball loose from Brees and JPP recovers at the Saints 26.
Actually, the clouds just opened at Raymond James Stadium. A steady rain is falling at halftime.
Bucs lead 14-3 at halftime and it looks rain could be moving back into the area.
The Saints have scored just one TD in their past 13 offensive possessions.
Drew Brees threw one interception in the Saints‚Äô first 10 games. He‚Äôs thrown one in each of the past three now.
Kamara looks down to me.
Saints take over at their own 34, 4:18 left in the first half. Drew Brees to work the 4-minute offense, will try to get a TD to take a 10-7 lead into halftime.
Bucs imploding here on this drive. Four consecutive penalties leave them with a fourth-and-31.
Four consecutive passes to start this drive for the Saints.
Santos clangs his 46-yard attempt off the right upright and the Saints hold. They‚Äôll take over at their own 36, 11:17, 2Q.
The Bucs‚Äô game plan is pretty clear. Got at Eli Apple.
The Saints have 5 carries for minus-3 yards on the ground.
Sluggish start for the Saints. Two straight punts to start the game.
Looking at replay of the Marcus Williams hit now and I stand corrected. Looked like a perfectly legal tackle.		Carry on...
Big stop for the Saints ‚ÄòD there. Saints take over at their own 11, 4:25, 1Q.
Big-time catch by Adam Humphries on third-and-long. Marcus Williams with a vicious hit. Fortunate to not get called for targeting there. Was definitely helmet to helmet contact.
That‚Äôs two batted balls on the same drive by the Tampa Bay defense. Haven‚Äôt seen many of those this season on Brees. Saints punt and Bucs take over at their 25.
Taysom Hill is no longer returning kickoffs. Alvin Kamara back for this one.
Former Tulane standout Cairo Santos with the XP to give the Bucs an early 7-0 lead.
Cameron Brate makes the play in single coverage vs. Vonn Bell and the Bucs take an early 6-0 lead, pending XP.

@LLaHoste Agree 100 percent. Dallas outplayed the Saints for four quarters. The score actually was deceptive. Cowboys took knee at 1 late and shot themselves in foot with untimely penalties.
Now this is a bowl game I would pay to watch. https://t.co/APFOjnqPlb
@Jim_Rapier My point: The missed facemask call on Prescott. These things look easy when you watch it on replay but they happen very quickly in live speed. Goes both ways.
@Jim_Rapier The game is played a very high speed. Those hits are much easier to see at home when viewed in slow motion. On the field, it‚Äôs lightning-quick.
@WhoDatHales I hear ya. That was bad, too. Clear launching by Smith. But the neutral zone infraction negated a major takeaway.
@Nawlins48 Can call that every game. DEs do it all the time. Officials always allow it as long as their hands are back.
@Jim_Rapier Yep. Definitely a big miss there, too. Smith launched into Kamara. Obvious penalty.
@Halomich2 Clear miss there. No doubt. Should have been called.
@Nawlins48 I don‚Äôt see it. It very clear. His hand is a clear 3-4 inches behind the LOS. Now his helmet is leaning into the neutral zone but officials have always allowed that without penalty as long as his hand is properly placed behind the line. It happens all the time.
@acw1993 Importance. Negated a huge takeaway. Game-changing play.
@FrankTheRat I don‚Äôt see it. His hand is a full 3-4 inches behind the ball where Unger has it placed for the snap. It‚Äôs clear. Maybe he‚Äôs saying his helmet is in the neutral zone but officials always allow that from DL, especially at end and OLB.
Completing film study of Saints-Cowboys &amp; it‚Äôs clear Walt Anderson‚Äôs officiating crew did not have a good game. Missed several calls both ways. The biggest: calling Randy Gregory offsides on sack-fumble play when Gregory clearly was properly aligned. Not sure how that happens.
Welcome back, @JoeyDaKRacing! https://t.co/O9215STIOu
After scoring on more than 60 percent of their drives in the first 11 games, the Saints scored on just two of nine drives against Dallas, dropping their scoring percentage to 58.1 percent this season. That‚Äôs still an unprecedented rate.

On the late INT: Drew Brees said he was just trying to throw away the ball in the 2-miunte offense when the ball sailed on him with a rusher in his face. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs on me,‚Äù he said.
The Cowboys get a DPI call on Marshon Lattimore and this one is just about over. Saints out of timeouts now.
Huge play by Cam Jordan to sack and strip Dak Prescott. Saints take over with 2:35 left. Dallas still hasn‚Äôt scored in the second half.
Whoa. Stallworth got a way with a facemark there. Not sure how the officials missed that one.
Eli Apple is the most relieved man in AT&amp;T Stadium right now. Wow.
Alvin Kamara is going into the injury tent, I presume for concussion testing after that last big hit.
The over-under in how many plays it takes the Saints to score a TD here is 4 1/2.
Randy Gregory‚Ä¶.
The Saints might win this game by two touchdowns.
As I said...
That‚Äôs exactly the kind of knucklehead play the Saints will take advantage of. Huge break for New Orleans.
Mike Thomas was targeted three times in the first half. He‚Äôs already been targeted four times in the first 11 minutes of the second half.
That qualifies as the worst half of the season for the New Orleans Saints. 0-for-5 third downs. 3 first downs. 229-59 total yards. 21:49-8:11 time of possession disadvantage.
This is only the fourth time the Saints have failed to score in the first half in the Sean Payton-Drew Brees era.		The last time it happened was the last the Saints played in Dallas in 2014. Cowboys led that one 24-0.
Time of possession: NO 7:20, DAL 19:30.
Cooper did the exact same move on Lattimore last time and stepped out of bounds. This time he didn‚Äôt. Big gain. Cowboys out of hole.

Tough call. Call hits ground and then moved. Walt Anderson confirms the call of incomplete pass on the field.

I can‚Äôt remember the last time Drew Brees threw three consecutive incompletions. It‚Äôs been awhile.
The Saints are trailing for the first time since the second quarter of the Vikings game in Week 8. That FG ended a streak of 18 consecutive quarters in which the Saints have not trailed.
Red zone has been an issue for the Cowboys. That‚Äôs the fifth time they‚Äôve settled for a field goal in their past 11 goal-to-go situations.
Cowboys going after Eli Apple in coverage. That‚Äôs the second big gain on him on this drive.

Terrific play call and great sell job by Justin McMillan on the misdirection set up the easy score for Charles Jones.
Tulane answers with a TD and successful goes for 2. Onions by Willie Fritz. Green Wave takes a 29-28 lead. Navy has 1:27 left.
Navy‚Äôs last four possessions have ended like this: FG, TD, TD, TD.
Navy completes a massive 14-play, 80-yard drive with a TD run and takes a 28-21 lead here at Yulman Stadium. Green Wave sideline looks stunned. Huge driving coming up here for Tulane. 3:44 to go and a bowl berth on the line.
Tulane‚Äôs drive stalls and the FG attempt hits the right upright and is no good. Navy will take over at the 20. Game tied at 21.
And we‚Äôre tied here after Navy converts the 2-point conversion. Momentum is all Navy‚Äôs right now. Tulane desperately needs to answer on this drive.
And just like that Navy connects on a 73-yard touchdown strike and is within a 2-point conversion of tying this game. Big turnaround here at Yulman Stadium.
Navy has scored on consecutive drives to close Tulane‚Äôs margin to 21-13 at Yulman Stadium. 4:02, 3Q. It feels like the Green Wave will need another score to put away the Midshipman, who are playing with renewed energy.
Justin McMillan is having himself. day. He hits Gabriel Clewis with a dart for a 52-yard catch-and-run and Tulane opens a 21-3 lead, 1:00, 2Q. McMillan is lighting up the Navy defense. He‚Äôs now 8 for 12 for 198 yards and we still have a full half to play.
Justin McMillan shows off his legs on Tulane‚Äôs fifth drive and takes it in from 5 yards out to put the Green Wave on top 14-3, 4:26, 2Q. McMillan now leads Tulane with 43 rushing yards and has completed 6 of 9 passes for 127 yards.
Tulane makes Navy pay for missing that short FG. Justin McMillan throws a perfect dart to Darnell Mooney for a 55-yard touchdown strike and the Green Wave take a 7-0 lead. Perfect pass from McMillan.

There have been 11 games this season in which a team has scored 45 or more points. The Saints have done it in back-to-back-to-back weeks.
The combined 99 points the Saints have scored against the Bengals and Eagles the past two weeks are the most in back-to-back weeks in franchise history.
@WalkerHines He was good then, too. Saints defensive coaching couldn‚Äôt get it out of him. Three different coordinators in four seasons didn‚Äôt help, either.
RT @SaintsNOW: Here are @JeffDuncan_'s postgame thoughts on the Saints' big win over the Eagles. https://t.co/m8Qc2LkU1Q
‚ÄúMalcolm is a tremendous player. I HATE that he got out here. That was probably as a big a personnel mistake as we‚Äôve made in my 13 years here.‚Äù ‚Äî Sean Payton on Malcolm Jenkins.
Caron Wentz‚Äôs final 31.9 passer rating is the lowest of his career.
The Saints win 48-7, their ninth consecutive win and third consecutive wire-to-wire job at the Superdome. The Saints have not trailed at home since the 4th quarter of their Week 2 game vs. Cleveland.
Drew Brees: 21-29, 353 yards, 4 TDs, 0 INTs (again). 		His passer rating is 152.7. (A perfect rating is 158.3).
Sean Payton would be wise to let Teddy Bridgewater play the rest of this fourth quarter. Needs to think big picture here.
Drew Brees got hit hard on that last completion. First time in a while that he‚Äôs been drilled like that.
Alvin Kamara was right...
The Saints have officially opened a can of Whoop on the Eagles.
The Saints‚Äô 7 offensive series vs. Philly today:		FG	TD	TD	Punt	TD	TD	TD
@bradhand True'dat.
Carson Wentz looks like a deer in the headlights right now.
Six Saints series.	Five Saints scores (4 TDs, 1 FG).		The lead is now 31-7 after that Mike Thomas TD reception.
Who Dat? Keith Kirkwood, Tre‚ÄôQuan Smith, Dan Arnold, Josh Hill and Austin Carr have combined for 13 of the Saints‚Äô 15 receptions for 146 yards and  2 TDs in the first half.
Sounds like the name of a bad ‚Äò70s sitcom (especially for Wentz). https://t.co/p2Kerq5U1h
Still waiting on Zach Ertz‚Äôs first reception for the Eagles.
And Thomas Morstead attempts his first punt since ‚Ä¶ (looks up old game books)‚Ä¶ the early fourth quarter of the Rams game.

@Ugarles 1 on penalty
First quarter stats:		First downs: PHI 1, NO 9	Total plays: PHI 7, NO 23	Total Yards: PHI, 15, NO 190	Score: PHI 0, NO 10
Brees flinched his hands. Can‚Äôt do that.
Marshon Lattimore flashes the ball skills that made him the first CB selected in the 2017 NFL Draft. Big INT on the second play of the Eagles‚Äô drive. Nightmare start for Philly. Dream start for the Saints.
With a FG &amp; TD on their opening two drives today, the Saints have now scored on 13 consecutive drives not counting end-of-game situations.
Brees to Carr for the TD. Saints take a 10-0 lead, 3:12, 1Q.
Keith Kirkwood is from Neptune, N.J., about an hour east of Philadelphia. He went to Temple University. He has 3 catches for 33 yards against the Eagles already.
Sean Payton thought long and hard about going for it there on fourth-and-2 before finally calling out the FG team. Lutz drills his 18th consecutive FG. Saints lead 3-0, 9:10, 1Q.
@rkohnke Kurt Coleman. Started his career in Philly.

@jamescornelson The regular season is about seeding. It‚Äôs not ruined at all nor is every other sport that has a respectable playoff format.
@chanman1984 @Galatas_H Using the argument that no one would watch Alabama-Iowa State is like saying no one will watch NFL games because the Jets play the Bills twice a year.

@Galatas_H You don‚Äôt win the Kentucky Derby on a mule, no matter who good the jockey and trainer are.
@Galatas_H Central Florida is a prime example of this. Not allowed in the country club.
@Galatas_H The more you open up the competition the more parity will eventually take over. Kids right now only have incentive to go to the elite schools because they know its the only way to truly win a title. The P5 ADs &amp; prez know this. That‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt want to open it up. Greed.
@Galatas_H The current FBS set-up has destroyed parity instead of promoting it. The elites have ruled DI football as an exclusive country club for decades &amp; it‚Äôs gradually eroded the competitive nature of the sport. The same handful of schools compete for titles every year. THAT is boring.
@Galatas_H Are you kidding me? TV networks would pay unprecedented $$$ for a 16-team playoff. The money would be off the charts.
@Galatas_H First of all, you don‚Äôt make rules based on the 1 percent. Second, by opening up the playoff to more teams you would create parity. Eventually those No. 16 seeds would become more competitive. They aren‚Äôt now, in part, BECAUSE of the exclusivity created by the bowl system.

One more crazy #Saints stat:		Thomas Morstead has punted just 19 times this year, which puts the Saints on pace to break the 1990 Houston Oilers‚Äô NFL record of 34 for the fewest punts in a season.
In his 18th season at age 39, Drew Brees leads the NFL in completion percentage (77.3%), TD-to-interception ratio (21:1) &amp; passing efficiency (123.8 rating).		The NFL record for passing efficiency in a season is 122.5 set by Aaron Rodgers in 2012. Rodgers won the MVP that year.
The Saints have scored on 61% of their 93 offensive possessions this season, a remarkable and likely unsustainable figure.		By comparison, the record-setting 2011 Saints scored on 51% of their drives &amp; the 2009 Super Bowl champs scored on 42.2% of their drives.

Final: Saints 51, Bengals 14		Who Dat &gt; Who Dey
And a Who Dat chant echoes through a near-empty Paul Brown Stadium as the Saints take a knee in victory formation.
Here‚Äôs how the Saints‚Äô 9 series have ended:		TD	TD	TD	TD	TD	FG	TD	FG	FG
Drew Brees‚Äôs touchdown-to-interception ratio this season: 21:1.
You know its a good game for the Saints when Teddy Bridgewater gets more playing time than Thomas Morstead.
Dan Arnold Keith Kirkwood. Dwayne Washington. This literally is The Who Dat offense.
Mark Ingram has 140 rushing yards through the first three quarters. This game is going to put him in the hunt to catch Deuce McAllister as the club‚Äôs career rushing leader.
Gotta feeling we are going to see Teddy Bridgewater before long.
Seven Saints possessions: 6 TDs, 1 FG.
The Saints are 7 for 7 on third down.
The Saints lead 35-7, the second consecutive game in which they have scored 35 first-half points. So much for the trap-game theory.
4 Saints possession, 4 TDs		The Saints are averaging 7.5 yards a play and have gained 294 yards and 20 first downs.		Drew Brees: 17-19, 197 yards. 	Third downs: 6 for 6  	Time of possession 19:27-9:11.

The Saints OL showed off its remarkable athleticism on that Ingram TD reception on the screen pass. Peat, Warford &amp; Armstead all downfield clearing a path. Warford was 20-plus yards downfield.
Bengals answer with an 8-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. We‚Äôre tied at 7, 1:56, 1Q.
The Saints had one gain of more than 9 yards in their opening series, a 15-yard catch by Michael Thomas.
That 15-play, 75-yard TD drive by the Saints validated this quote from @ZachStrief about the Saints offense.		"The offense has been less explosive than it was in big years like 2009 or 2011, but the Saints are very comfortable working the ball down the field, 8 yards at a time."
Drew Brees placed that pass perfectly to Mike Thomas, who was well covered in the end zone. Play being reviewed.
That‚Äôs a 15-play, 75-yard touchdown drive on the Saints‚Äô opening possession. Clinic.
Saints putting on a clinic in offensive balance on this opening drive.
@JesseJreed Agreed. Haslett gets a bad rap with some segments of the fan base. He brought back a level of respectability from the Ditka days. He had a good staff and his teams were competitive.

@Will_NOLA @ZacksWorldd The value was diminished but there was value there. It was definitely better than zero. The Pelicans, after all, made him a fairly significant offer.

@MasonGinsberg @pawel_kajak @EdLawDude They did a fine job of recovering from the situation. Getting Randle and Payton was shrewd.
@42PhD Understood. Needed to have worked with his camp to find a solution. Instead it broke down and dissolved into acrimony. Cousins walked and the club got nothing in return for an asset it traded Hield and a first for.
@pawel_kajak @EdLawDude @MasonGinsberg Yes. That‚Äôs where the failure occurred. Needed to make that sign-&amp;-trade happen or work with Cousin‚Äôs camp to find another solution. Instead it dissolved into acrimony and the club got nothing in return.
@Will_NOLA Understood. But you have to get something for Cousins. Can‚Äôt let him walk for nothing.  That‚Äôs my point.
@42PhD I have no problem with the original trade but once you have the asset you must maximize it. Can‚Äôt let it go for nothing. Bad management.
@pawel_kajak @EdLawDude @MasonGinsberg Understood. No problem with the original trade but once you have that asset you have to get something for it in return. Can not lose it for nothing.

Particularly with offensive players, the Saints always have a vision for veteran acquisitions. It will be interesting to hear Sean Payton‚Äôs vision for Dez Bryant and how he fits in this offense. We‚Äôll have to wait until tomorrow morning to get it.
An interesting subplot to the Saints‚Äô signing of Dez Bryant: Asst. GM Jeff Ireland was forced to apologize to Bryant 8 years ago as the Dolphins GM for asking during a pre-draft visit whether Bryant's mother was a prostitute. It appears both parties are past the incident.

@afelix1084 @warnholtz @NolaNigga504 Great point. These things tend to even out over time. Gridiron gris-gris has been with the Saints this season after seemingly being against them in previous years.
@warnholtz @NolaNigga504 Thanks. And you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm a huge jerk. Ask anyone.
@DonRenda My guess is the Saints are simply updating their ready list at the WR position. They do this with multiple positions every Tuesday. Depth is pretty thin after moving Ginn to IR.
@warnholtz Honest answer: I don‚Äôt like the Saints. I also don‚Äôt dislike the Saints. I get paid to write opinions on the sports teams in the New Orleans market. That‚Äôs what I do. If you want a cheerleader, there are plenty of others to follow.
Thanks, Mark. Much appreciated... https://t.co/60cywTYjae
@warnholtz My point is Hekker got the first down. Nothing more nothing less. For all I know, the Rams could have fumbled on the next play.
@hdgraham4 Rule is feet don‚Äôt count. Not sure about the side of his foot, but I would think it would apply similarly.
@Saxmachine1013 I call it like I see it, my man. If you want cheerleaders there are plenty of others to follow.
@the_sneddy @SaintsnPelicans That‚Äôs typically how officiating works.
@Saxmachine1013 The only fired up in my audience appears to be you. Maybe that should tell you something...
@Saxmachine1013 Put it this way, if the call would have been against the Saints and upon replay it was clear that they refs got it wrong, hell, yes. Not sure what you‚Äôre getting at. But I think I know.
@JMEYER3 Yes. They let them play on both sides. I liked the way they called it.
@RealJeffVarisco @Saxmachine1013 You‚Äôre right. He‚Äôs awful and totally uncredible. I don‚Äôt know how he keeps fooling these national media outlets into hiring him. They need to talk to you for a reference.
@Saxmachine1013 Because it was a big play in the game and I‚Äôm watching the replay as we speak. Would you have minded if I had arrived at the opposite conclusion?  ü§î
@RealJeffVarisco @Saxmachine1013 You got me. Should have followed The Who Dat Saints blogs for the unvarnished truth. Guilty!
@whoodaatt Clearly I should have consulted with your crew first!
@Saxmachine1013 The truth. Yes. Glad you recognize it.
After watching the replay, it seems pretty clear that Johnny Hekker actually got the first down on the Rams‚Äô fake field goal attempt in the 2nd Qtr. Perhaps the replay angles weren't sufficient to overrule the call on the field.
Yes. Watched the replay this morning and was totally confounded.		Alvin Ka-Matrix https://t.co/2CvlgGFTJk

@jdanton I wasn‚Äôt at SP presser so don‚Äôt know. What question?
Michael Thomas has caught 88.6 percent (70 of 79) of the passes that have been targeted for him this season. The next closest wide receiver is Danny Amendola at 78.4.
For the a.m. crowd... https://t.co/ztgRg1iI2F

Joe Horn also had a message for Michael Strahan, who was critical of both Horn &amp; Thomas‚Äô end-zone antics. ‚ÄúMichael Strahan got 4 touchdowns scored on his ass (by Horn in the Saints‚Äô 45-7 win against the Giants in '03) that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt like it. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs being negative."
Joe Horn on Michael Thomas: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that some kids don‚Äôt do, to pay homage to an old soul. For him to do it on a national stage took a lot of courage. I‚Äôm humbled."
Joe Horn said he went online right after he saw Michael Thomas‚Äô ode to his cellphone TD celebration and bought one of Thomas' No. 13 Saints jerseys.
Ex-Saints WR Joe Horn said he saw Michael Thomas‚Äô honorary TD celebration while working out in Tupelo, Miss. ‚ÄúWhen I saw him bring out that cellphone it brought a tear to my eye,‚Äù Horn said. ‚ÄúFor him to pay homage to me in that way, let me know what kind of man Michael Thomas is"
The Saints are in Victory formation. They will hand the Rams their first loss of the season: 45-35.
Michael Thomas has 12 catches for a career-high 211 yards and a touchdown.
Mike Thomas just reenacted Joe Horn‚Äôs cell phone touchdown celebration.
Sean Payton is going to do everything he can to run out this final 4:50, with the Saints nursing a 38-35 lead.
Wil Lutz drills his 14th conceive field goal, this one from 54 yards out, to give the Saints a precarious 38-35 lead, 6:23 left.
The Rams have scored 21 unanswered points to tie this game with 9:48 left. Great finish coming up here.
@AmyEliza00 Excellent point.
Mike Thomas has 10 catches for 121 yards. He has been targeted 12 times.
@CFTpersonal Might want to stop while you‚Äôre ahead
Could be have the first punt of the game here?
Drew Brees appears to just be alternating plays to Mike Thomas and Alvin Kamara. And the Rams can do nothing about it.
The Rams can not tackle Mike Thomas in the open field.
@WitnessLitnesss Did the same thing vs. Gronk in Game 2 last season. All along the sideline.
Marcus Williams has a poor habit of putting his head down and diving at the ball carrier. Burned him again on that tackle attempt.
@CFTpersonal Good line. If I use it, will give you full credit.
Twelve first-half drives.	Seven first-half TDs.	Zero first-half punts.
The Saints have scored more points in the first half than the Rams have allowed in any of their eight full games this season.
The Saints have opened a can of Whoop on the Rams.
Brees sneak time.
Brees showing his wheels. Scrambles for a first down on third-and-10. The Rams simply can not stop the Saints.
The Saints are going for the kill shot here.
Terrific hands by Alex Anzalone. Wow. What an INT.
Drew Brees is 15 for 18 for 194 yards and 3 TDs. His passer efficiency rating is 151.2.
The Saints are going through the Rams defense like it‚Äôs Swiss cheese. Five first-half drives. Four touchdowns and a fumble.
The Rams are averaging 8.7 yards a play. The Saints are averaging 8.0 yards a play.  Difference is the Saints have run 32 plays to Rams‚Äô 22.
Big drive coming here for the Saints offense. With the Rams getting the ball back to start the second half the Saints will try to use up the final 3 minutes of clock if possible.
Seven drives. Five touchdowns.
Mark Ingram back in the game for the Saints.
The Ingram fumble ends up being irrelevant after the failed fake field goal attempt. Saints take over.
@cardsfan89 Agreed. Not sure they can overturn the call on the field.
Close call. Hekker looked like he extended the ball past the first-down marker.
This is starting to feel like that 52-49 Giants-Saints shootout of 2015.
Four drives. Four TDs.
Over/under on combined punts by the Rams &amp; Saints today: 2.5.
The Rams averaged 13.7 yards a play in the first quarter. The Saints 7.7.
Cooks beats Lattimore for another big gain. This is a pinball game.
Three drives. Three touchdowns.
The Saints are throwing a healthy diet of double teams at Aaron Donald.
The Rams have no answer for Alvin Kamara. And Sean Payton and Drew Brees know it.
The Saints are going to throw a variety of double moves at the Rams CBs today. That was the first one, well-covered by Joyner. Brees‚Äô pass was just better.
And the shootout is on.
Taysom Hill is the offensive Honey Badger.

LSU has -3 rushing yards on 19 carries. The Tigers‚Äô longest run of the night has covered 4 yards.

Irv Smith Jr. would be a solid second-round draft pick for the Saints in the 2019 NFL Draft. Like father, like son.
The highlight for LSU so far tonight has been the Tiger Walk.
Can Devin White play offense?
In the first half against the No. 4 passing defense in the nation, Tua Tagovailoa is 19 for 29 for 208 yards &amp; 2 TDs with a 141.6 passer rating.
Irv Smith Jr. is a New Orleans native and the sone of former Saints first-round draft pick Irv Smith
Ed Orgeron just chewed out Saadhiq Charles when he came to the sideline after that last drive. He was not happy with that false start.
Baton Rouge native Dylan Moses didn‚Äôt make any friends in Tiger Stadium with that late push out of bounds on LSU QB Joe Burrow.
Alabama has run 36 plays to LSU‚Äôs 14 and outgained the Tigers 224-38 in total yards.
Tua Tagovailoa is a Drew Brees-Russell Wilson-Mike Vick hybrid. Ball comes out lightning-quick and on a rope.	 	Lefty arm strength like Vick.	Accurate &amp; decisive like Brees.	Mobile &amp; elusive like Wilson

Alabama is not shying away from going at LSU CB Greedy Williams. They are going right at him early on here.
Huge round of applause for @TeamGleason as he‚Äôs introduced to the Tiger Stadium crowd on the field and presented a No. 37 LSU Tigers jersey.
They don‚Äôt make officials‚Äô whistles loud enough to be heard in Tiger Stadium tonight.
Tiger Stadium is so loud right now players can‚Äôt hear officials whistles on the field. Action is continuing long after the whistle because no one can hear it.
Tua Tagovailoa is down after getting sandwiched for that last sack. He just jogged off the field. Tiger Stadium is going absolutely nuts right now.
That shovel pass looked like the play the Saints ran for their first touchdown against the Vikings on Sunday night. It worked a lot better for the Saints.
LSU was lined up with 12 men on defense. Not a bad strategy vs. ‚ÄòBama/Tua if you can get away with it.

Before the game, @DMcAllister26 told me in the press box, ‚ÄúThe Saints win this game by 10 points tonight. The only way they don‚Äôt is they commit a bunch of turnovers.‚Äù		#TheOleMissOracle
The 120 yards is the fewest by Saints quarterback Drew Brees in a full game in his 13-year Saints career. He threw for 46 yards in the 2006 regular-season finale vs. Carolina, but left the game after playing the opening series.
Sean Payton said the 3QB player in the first quarter was called Bridgewater 11. ‚ÄúIt was a new wrinkle,‚Äù he said.
RT @SaintsNOW: Check out @JeffDuncan_'s takeaways from the Saints' win https://t.co/QaUYGY8yco https://t.co/zbRc7wljV3
There will be no Minneapolis Miracle this time. The Saints win 30-20, their sixth consecutive victory of the season, setting up a huge showdown with the 8-0 Los Angeles Rams in the Superdome next Sunday.
It would take a Minneapolis Miracle for the Vikings to win this one.
I mistyped there. Saints had an INT in the first half. So Vikings 2 TOs, Saints 1.
The Vikings have outgained the Saints 370-267 in total yards and 25-16 in first downs but still trail by double digits. 		Key stat: Vikings 2 TOs, Saints 0.
The Saints offensive line has dominated again tonight. Saints are averaging a solid 4.3 yards a carry and Brees has yet to be sacked in 23 pass attempts.
When the Saints had their best teams, they were able to run the ball in this exact situation. And the drive starts with a nice gain by Ingram on the ground.
That missed extra point looms large right now. Vikings would have been in position to go for 2 there and make it a one-score game. Instead, they now will need two scores in the final 4:26 to tie.
In his first game as a Saint, Eli Apple has a team-high eight tackles.
Sheldon Rankins has three tackles, two sacks, two tackles for loss and two quarterback hits tonight.
Since the takeaway in the final minutes of the first half, the Saints have outscored the Vikings 20-0.
The Saints defense is rising up. Since that big takeaway right before halftime, they have dominated and taken over the game. Sheldon Rankins with two sacks now.

@Vbiii241 To quote Rick Venturi, I think we‚Äôre just sawing the sawdust here. Let‚Äôs agree to disagree and go on with our lives.
@Vbiii241 Yep. And when they played the Panthers last year in the playoffs and Carolina stacked the box, Brees riddled them for 376 passing yards. Payton takes what the ‚ÄòD gives. Like I said, the offense isn‚Äôt the problem.
@Vbiii241 The simple answer is Payton does what works.
@Vbiii241 No. They have Drew Brees. The greatest passer in NFL history. That‚Äôs why they pass a lot.
It‚Äôs beyond clear that a change is needed. Only question that remains is when‚Ä¶. https://t.co/QxD0Ngy1PT
@Vbiii241 Like I said, the percentage of runs goes up in games where you have a lead and are trying to milk the clock.
@Vbiii241 He‚Äôs being aggressive. He did the same thing late against Baltimore and got a big first down and was able to run more time off the clock. He takes what the defense gives.
@Vbiii241 I think you‚Äôre looking for blame in all the wrong places. ‚Ä¶ When the Saints have been mediocre, it‚Äôs because their defense has been historically awful. It‚Äôs not because of their offense. They have the most prolific offense in NFL history.
@Vbiii241 Of course. But he‚Äôs often passing more because he‚Äôs behind, playing catch-up. Makes sense that those are the years that they love more. It‚Äôs not as simple as cause-effect.
@Vbiii241 The numbers lie. The Saints ran the ball on a lower percentage of plays in 2009 primarily because they built big leads and were simply trying to close the game and run out the clock in the second half. The running game didn‚Äôt get them the lead. It was Brees &amp; the passing attack.

@mhalphen Gotcha. Would require a special situation: a team in desperate need for a QB &amp; sees TB as a long-term starter. Teams all had the chance to sign Bridgewater for free in February and the market was tepid then. Not sure how much his value has increased since then or why it would.
@mhalphen Good question, Mike. But the Saints, in particular Sean Payton, love Hill and value him as a long-term prospect. It would take  a significant offer to move him. But never say never, especially with Brees playing so well.

@sugarilla Oh, I‚Äôm not defending his actions at all. Just saying that just because a young kid gets frustrated and makes a dumb decision to take it to social media doesn‚Äôt necessarily make him a character problem. Those kinds of things happen more than folks realize.  A lot more.
@RealSpongeSaint I‚Äôm sure the Saints did their homework in Apple and are confident that he won‚Äôt be a problem in the locker room.
@RealSpongeSaint No. I was strictly speaking about Cooks. Some fans have a bad habit of trashing the character of former Saints players that are traded: Cooks, Jimmy Grahan, Akiem Hicks. None of those guys were bad dudes.
@RealSpongeSaint Being unhappy with your role is not a ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù problem. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. Happens all the time in the NFL. Players and their agents are constantly working teams, coaches that way.
@Tom_FCDallas He was frustrated and is a competitive guy. Not the first player to express those sentiments. Heck, he‚Äôs not the first Saint to do. Happens all the time.
@RealSpongeSaint Where do you that Sean Payton didn‚Äôt like Cooks? Just because he traded him doesn‚Äôt mean he didn‚Äôt like him. He traded Reggie Bush, Darren Sproles and Jimmy Graham, too.

I don‚Äôt believe what I just saw.
And there it is. The Brees leaping sneak. Saints make getting a yard look so easy.
Drew Brees is playing out of his mind.
Sorry. Kamara.
That Mark Ingram TD run was the first touchdown allowed by the Ravens defense in the second half all season.
Drew Brees‚Äô athleticism is in full display on this drive. He is single-handedly out-maneuvering the Ravens‚Äô pass rush and making plays with his arm. Just remarkable.
Lamar Jackson‚Äôs first career touchdown gives the Ravens a 10-7 lead with 4 seconds to play before halftime.
Drive began with Brees deftly avoiding an unblocked blitzer in the backfield to hit Dan Arnold for a 10-yard gain. It ends with him similarly bating a blitz to earn a DPI call in the end zone, setting up a TD pass to Ben Watson. Normal QBs don‚Äôt make those plays.
That TD drive was all Drew Brees. Remarkable work by the future Hall of Fame against a very good defense.
The stats so far are eerily similar:		Total plays: NO 25, BALT 24	TofP: NO11:56, BALT 12:00		Saints had a 20-play, 69-yard drive. Ravens had a 17-play, 63-yard drive.
The Saints have clearly game-planned for Flacco‚Äôs slow delivery. They‚Äôve already batted down two of his passes at the LOS. Flacco entered the game tied with Kirk Cousins for the most passes batted or deflected at the line of scrimmage (11) in the NFL this season.

Crazy play there. Officials rule that was a fumble but replay looks like an incomplete pass to me.
Saints have the wind at their back and a big third down here to start the second quarter.
Ravens are getting a heavy dose of Taysom Hill today.
Brutal way to end that epic opening drive. 20 plays, 71 yards, 0 points.
This is one of the most impressive  drives I‚Äôve seen from the Saints. Already 17 plays &amp; almost 9 minutes off the clock.
The other benefit to this marathon opening drive for the Saints: It‚Äôs eaten up half the first quarter. Saints will have advantage of the wind in 2nd quarter.
This drive is pretty remarkable so far. Saints have run 12 plays and still aren‚Äôt in field-goal range.
Trickeration. Taysom Hill with the fake punt to convert the fourth down. Saints keep possession.
If you‚Äôre wondering about the wind, it‚Äôs blowing really strongly from the west. Saints will be driving into the wind in the first quarter and will it have it at their backs in the 2nd.
Temperature is 54 degrees with 15 mph winds.
Noticeably large contingent of Saints fans at MT&amp;T Bank Stadium today. Lots of No. 9 jerseys in the crowd.

The Pelicans are going to obliterate the franchise record for scoring in a game. A flurry of Niko Mirotic bombs has pumped the score to 128-100 and we still have 7:30 left. Record is 139.
The Pelicans‚Äô franchise record for points in a game is within striking distance tonight. They have 110 going to the 4th quarter. Record is 139.
The entire Pelicans just burst out of their collective seats on that 3-pointer by Solo Hill, which gave the Pelicans a 100-82 lead.

Burrow plows into the end zone from the 1 and Tiger Stadium erupts. LSU now firmly in control with a 26-9 lead, 9:31, 4Q.
And on cue, the Georgia contingent bursts into a raucous ‚ÄúUGA! UGA!‚Äù chant. This final 14:39 is going to be fun.
The momentum has definitely turned here at Tiger Stadium Georgia playing with confidence. You can read it in the body language of their players on the field. The Bulldogs are back in this one.
Georgia found something on that last series with Fields at QB in the read-option. LSU‚Äôs lead trimmed to 19-9 with one quarter to play.
WE‚Äôve got a ballgame. Holyfield blasts in from 10 yards out and Georgia finally has life. Bulldogs going for 2 to make it a one-score game.
Not a great throw by Fromm there. Led to a Robertson bobble and step OB. Missed opportunity for Georgia there.
LSU is now 4 for 4 on fourth downs.
Kirby ‚ÄúNot So‚Äù Smart... https://t.co/ksX76reXTz
Gotta think Kirby Smart is going to go to Justin Fields soon. Fromm doesn‚Äôt have it today.
The refs commendably are letting both teams play today. Georgia and LSU each have just one penalty for 5 yards with 9:03 left in the third quarter.
LSU sacked Fromm on that third down with only three defenders rushing. Not good for the UGA O line.
Georgia looks like a different team on this opening drive. Offense looks much more decisive and confident.
Gary Danielson should ask Jake Fromm if Tiger Stadium is having an effect on the Bulldogs today.
RT @JeffSchultzATL: LSU 16, Georgia 0.	Yardage: LSU 251, Georgia 95
No problem for Tracy, who drills the 39-yarder to give LSU a 16-0 lead. Seems like it should be more.
Not an easy angle on this 39-yard field goal for Cole Tracy.
LSU is putting it to Georgia. Ed Orgeron goes for it again on fourth down and again the Tigers reward his aggressiveness by converting. Tigers threatening to score again at the Georgia 20.
If Burrow had completed that pass Tiger Stadium might have imploded. Had his guy.
Ed Oregon goes for it on fourth-and-1 at his own 38. The ‚ÄòO' stands for Onions!
Dave Aranda‚Äôs boys are playing some ‚ÄòD. Fromm has no one open again and air mails his pass OB. Punt. LSU has dominated on both sides of the ball so far.
LSU has stunned the Georgia defense with plays of 50, 47 and 37 yards in the first 19 minutes of this game. Not sure anyone saw that coming.
I‚Äôd say Tiger Stadium is having a slight effect on this game. Georgia looks completely discombobulated on both offense and defense.
Big stop there by the Georgia defense to stem the momentum. LSU settles for a 36-yard FG by Cole Tracy. LSU leads 13-0, 11:22, 2Q.
I‚Äôd say Justin Jefferson was a little open there. Geez‚Ä¶.
Jake Fromm is now 2 for 9 for 20 yards. He had thrown seven consecutive incomplete passes before that last shaky 1-yard completion. LSU defensive backs are winning their 1-on-1 coverage assignments so far.
This start couldn‚Äôt have gone much better for LSU. Will be interesting to see if Georgia sticks with the run now trailing 10-0 with 13:34 left in the 2nd quarter. Bulldogs were having success on the ground.
@LarryHolder Good call, Sir Lawrence. Instead they go for the Burrow plunge.
Joe Burrow was aptly named on that short TD run. Burrows into the end zone to convert a fourth-and-goal at the 1-foot line and LSU takes a 9-0 lead, pending XP.
Tiger Stadium crowd roars incredulously when the replay is shown on the big video board. Looked like Brossette got in the end zone. Replay review forthcoming.
Ed Oregon ran all the way down to the goal line to call the timeout. He wants the officials to review that last run. Looked like a TD from the press box.
Tiger Stadium roars to life as the first quarter ends on a long 47-yard run by Clyde Edwards-Helaire. Tyrique McGhee saved a touchdown with a great diving tackle from behind. LSU will open the 2Q at the Georgia 7
Is Les Miles coordinating special teams for Georgia? What was that?!
To say that LSU defenders are having trouble tackling Georgia running backs would be an understatement.
Elijah Holyfield just trucked John Battle. Fournette-like...
I remember a few years ago when Rutgers-Louisville was a huge Top 25 game. Now they might be the two worst P5 teams in college football.
@AJLuna It was close. Felt like the pass was so hurried &amp; off-target officials let it go.
Tracy‚Äôs 33-yard FG is good and LSU takes an early 3-0 lead, 9:32, 1Q. LSU went with the hurry-up offense there to get the Georgia defense on its heels. Employed the same strategy vs. Florida with moderate success.
Drive stalls. LSU will settle for a FG attempt from Cole Tracy.
Terrace Marshall with a spectacular diving catch to get LSU in the Georgia red zone. Perfect throw &amp; catch for the Tigers.

Several Redskins players making their way through the mob to congratulate Drew Brees after the game. Among them: Alex Smith; Trent Williams; Josh Norman; and Adrian Peterson.

RT @JakeReed86: Congrats to @drewbrees one of the best to ever play that position!
Saints players are filling up the trunk behind their bench with game balls. If this keeps up, the Superdome might run out of footballs.
The Saints have officially opened a can of Whoop on the Redskins.
Clearly the Redskins were worried about Brees out wide and Taysom Hill skirts around end for the easy TD.
Drew Brees will have a shot at career touchdown No. 500 here. And I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say he gets it.
Lost in all of this Drew Brees hoopla I‚Äôd like to point out that Taysom Hill needs just 72,047 yards to become the NFL‚Äôs all-time passing leader.
Drew Brees needs just one TD to become the 4th quarterback in NFL history to pass for 500 yards, joining Peyton Manning (539), Brett Favre (508) &amp; Tom Brady (500).
Drew Brees is 20 of 23 for 316 yards &amp; 3 TDs. 		His passer rating is a perfect 158.3.

Talk about rising to the occasion. Drew Brees is 13 of 15 for 228 yards &amp; 2 TDs.		On the night when he becomes the NFL passing leader, his passer rating is a perfect 158.3.
And Brees does it in style with a bomb to Mike Thomas and the entire Saints team comes on to the field to mob Brees.
Drew Brees needs 35 yards to break the NFL passing record. Somebody cue up the Peyton Manning video.
Drew Brees might get the NFL passing record on this upcoming drive.
Drew Brees is 12 of 14 for 166 yards and a TD. His passer rating is 139.9.
Sheldon Rankins is ballin‚Äô tonight.
Three Saints drives.	Three Saints touchdowns.
Brees sneak time?
Saints defenders didn‚Äôt look like they were that interested in tackling Adrian Peterson in the open field there.
The bye week is coming at a good time for the Saints. Their secondary will need it.
The Saints are losing cornerbacks at a scary rate. P.J. Williams is now shaken up.
The Redskins are killing themselves with penalties. Three penalties on their defense have converted third downs.
Just an observation, but probably not the smartest thing to do to give No. 9 an extra set of downs.
Marshon Lattimore is being evaluated for a concussion. He‚Äôs in the locker room.
With the Saints secondary depleted by injury, Dennis Allen has wisely dialed up the pressure on Alex Smith. Saints DL has to win up front because the back end could be vulnerable.
The Saints pass rush has Alex Smith dancing with some happy feet in the pocket.
Saints are using Vonn Bell in the slot right now with Lattimore out. Redskins are targeting him when they have the time.
Vonn Bell left something on the Superdome turf after that last juke by Adrian Peterson
P.J. Williams and Ken Crawley now in as the starting cornerbacks with Lattimore in the injury tent.
Marshon Lattimore took some friendly fire there from A.J. Klein and is down.
Saints defense is playing downhill tonight. Really attacking the line of scrimmage.

That will do it. Fittingly, Florida seals the upset with an INT. And the Gators will win this one 27-19.
The Florida defense tonight:		9 tackles for loss	5 QB hits	5 sacks	1 forced fumble	1 Pick 6
Joe Burrow‚Äôs first INT of the season is a doozy. Pick 6 for the Gators turns the Swamp into a din of lunacy.		Florida leads 27-19.
LSU gets the ball back at its own 12. The Tigers have one timeout and 2:21 to work with. Need a field goal to win.
LSU entered the game allowing an average of 103 rushing yards a game, tied for 16th nationally. Florida now has 212 yards on the ground. And we still have 3:27 left.
On third-and-1, Florida finally gets wise and has Franks under center and, lo and behold, they convert the first down.
Massive third down coming up here. Third and 1.
LSU once again catches Florida not ready for the snap and Joe Burrow alertly goes deep to induce a pass interference penalty.
Florida crowd and sidelined energized after that last TD. The Swamp is rocking. With 8:48 left, plenty of time for Burrow and Tigers to make something happen. Big series coming up. LSU takes over at the 25.
Gators answer with a massive touchdown drive to take the lead 20-19, 8:48, 4Q. Florida will now go for 2 to try to make it a 3-point lead.
Gators go Philly Special!
LSU leads 19-14, 11:14, 4Q.
LSU plunges it in and now the Tigers will go for 2.
Nick Brossette with another massive run. This time for 47 yards to the Florida 2. LSU in business now.
Huge run by Brosette on first down. 31 yards. Gives LSU the ball in Florida territory.
This is going to be a very interesting replay review. Could go either way.
I can confirm that the Swamp crowd does an infinitely better job of singing ‚ÄúI Won‚Äôt Back Down‚Äù in unison than the Superdome crowd does of the Who Dat chant.		#NotClose
LSU expertly playing the field position game here, leaning on their defense and special teams to grind away at hidden yards. Tigers will start this drive at the Florida 42.
Breaking: They‚Äôre doing the Wave at The Swamp.		Is that still a thing?
Joe Burrow is the next Taysom Hill.
Huge pick there by LSU‚Äôs Grant Delpit in the end zone, silences the Swamp.
The Swamp is alive.
Florida goes to the option again and catches the LSU defense outflanked for another big gain. But it‚Äôs negated by a block in the back.
Joe Cool with the nifty fake on the read-option on third-and-1 and runs 21 yards for the first down.
Third-&amp;-1 and Florida goes into the shotgun and Franks is buried in the backfield for a loss on a keeper. Again, I don‚Äôt get it.
LSU‚Äôs first drive: 10 plays, 75 yards, TD.		LSU‚Äôs next 4 drives: 17 plays, 72 yards, 3 punts &amp; a  fumble.
Gators strike back and tie the score at 7. It‚Äôs 7-7, 12:30, 2Q.		This crowd is energized.		#TebowMagic
Second-and-goal at the 1 and Florida goes into the shotgun. I don‚Äôt get it.
‚ÄúI was born a Gator. I played as a Gator. And I‚Äôll die a Gator!‚Äù ‚Äî Tim Tebow to Florida crowd after being inducted into theUF Ring of Honor.		Crowd goes bonkers. Gators driving...
That‚Äôs twice in a row where the Gators defense has gotten to Burrow from the blind side. JB lucky to not lose a second fumble there. LSU punting from its end zone.
Whoa‚Ä¶ 212-pound Clyde Edwards-Helaire just went Fournette on the Florida defense. But the Gators answer with a strip-sack of Joe Burrow and The Swamp shivers to life.
LSU using a hurry-up offense to keep the Florida defense on its heels and to prevent substitutions. Steve Ensminger obviously saw something on tape that he felt the Tigers could take advantage of.
LSU cashes in for a TD on their opening drive and makes it look easy doing it. Big-time opening series. LSU leads 7-0, 11:43, 1Q.
Big start for LSU. Burrow to Jefferson for 38 yards.

@SaintsnPelicans My job is to call it like I see it. Reality is a good thing. Establishes the proper expectations.
I see why the Saints loved Patrick Mahomes so much in the 2017 NFL Draft. Big-time talent.
Wow. Mahomes is a monster.
The back page of today‚Äôs New York Post: ‚ÄúGI-AINTS!‚Äù https://t.co/mu3KxAE9Ju
@RacinJasun Fair point...
@I_am_J9911 Yes. Very well played. Huge play
Another hidden play that was huge for the Saints‚Ä¶ Cam Jordan making an open-field tackle on Odell Beckham Jr. on his wild, reverse-field catch-and-run. If Jordan doesn‚Äôt make that tackle OBJ might score. Saints ‚ÄòD was overloaded in pursuit &amp; a wall of NYG blockers was formed.
I would also point out that Taysom Hill ran through a tackle attempt by Landon Collins on his 19-yard run. Not sure how many QBs could do that in today‚Äôs game.
Film study of #Saints-Giants also revealed Taysom Hill showing very sharp read skills on the read-option. He made one poor read in several attempts. His presence is a definite factor in the Saints‚Äô improved rushing attack.
@ryanbrees Yep. Total miscommunication at the worst possible time.
@jarellf Yes. Both were very creative and timely calls. On second, Saints got to Manning with 5 rushers, who beat 6 Giants blockers.
Officials could have called Unger for the trip or Andrus Peat for a hold on the play, which would have resulted in a safety &amp; given the ball back to the Giants w/major momentum. Huge break for Saints. Sometimes you have to be lucky &amp; Saints received their share of breaks vs. NYG.
Biggest play in Saints-Giants might have been made by Max Unger, who got away with a trip on an unblocked Davlin Tomlinson who had a clear path to Drew Brees for a potential sack-safety on 1st down after Giants had trimmed lead to 26-18 late. Brees escaped, hit Hill for 23 yards.

In road wins agains the Falcons &amp; Giants, the Saints scored 8 TDs and kicked 7 field goals in 23 offensive possessions. They punted only six times. The other two series were end-of-game kneel-downs. That‚Äôs dominant offensive football. Oh, and they get Mark Ingram back next week.
@myneisthebest @MikeTriplett It‚Äôs six punts. Not five.
@austinluxx It‚Äôs six punts. Not five.
The Saints beat the Giants 33-18 and an hour or so later @GMBRacing‚Äôs Lone Sailor wins the Grade III Oklahoma Derby at Remington Park. Not a bad day for Gayle Benson and the Saints organization.

@daringantt Marvin Harrison, 143, in 2002.
After 4 games, Mike Thomas and Alvin Kamara are on pace to catch 168 and 140 passes, respectively, this season.
The Saints win their third in a row and just like that they stand alone in first place in the NFC South.
Drew Brees will go into the Week 5 game against the Redskins needing 201 yards to break Peyton Manning‚Äôs NFL career passing mark. I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say he gets it.
That 49-yard touchdown run by Alvin Kamara was the second longest of his career. He had a 74-yarder last year vs. the Rams.
Suddenly, Alvin Kamara is having himself a day. He has rushed for a career-high 134 yards and 3 TDs.
The Saints were 1 for 8 on third down before this drive. They have converted 4 for 4 on this series.
And that‚Äôs why they call me Jinx Duncan.
The Giants‚Äô biggest gain of the day is 11 yards.
The Giants gained 75 yards and 7 first downs on their opening drive. They have gained 42 yards and four first downs on their ensuing five drives.
Sean Payton will not be happy with the Saints‚Äô situational football in the first half. They were 1 of 7 on third down and 0 for 4 in the red zone.
Saints take a 12-7 lead to the locker room at halftime but it feels like it should be a lot more.
Drew Brees with just 102 yards passing in the first half. Would take a monster second half (or maybe an OT) for him to break Peyton Manning‚Äôs career passing record now.
Saints now 0 for 4 in the red zone. Will settle for another FG.
Brandon Tate is living right.
Eli Manning‚Äôs tackle on Marshon Lattimore saved 4 points there for the Giants. Big play.
The Giants are doing a good job of taking away Mike Thomas. So far 0 catches and 0 targets for the NFL‚Äôs leading receiver.
Saints now 0 for 3 in the red zone.
Taysom time...
Saints defense gets its second takeaway of the season when P.J. Williams‚Äô helmet hits the ball out of Galman‚Äôs hands and Lattimore returns it to the Giants‚Äô 14-yard line.
Saints settle for another FG. They are now 0 for 2 in the red zone.
Taysom Hill has two of the Saints‚Äô three longest runs of the season. A 35-yarder vs. ATL &amp; a 19-yarder today.
Saints catch a break. Looked like Jenkins made a solid tackle on Kamara but officials called a horse-collar tackle. Now the Saints are marching, thanks to Taysom Hill‚Äôs nifty 19-yard run.
Strange situation here. The game clock expired before the Saints got off that last FG. So Wil Lutz must re-kick.
That didn‚Äôt take long. Eli Manning dices up the Saints defense for 6-of-7 passing for 41 yards and a touchdown as the Giants open the scoring with a 2-yard TD pass to Sterling Shepard. Giants 7-0, 8:24, 1Q.
Two straight incompletions for Drew Brees to start the game, then an offensive pass interference call. Saints forced to punt after a short completion to Cam Meredith.

Saints players are headed to the exit tunnel at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The Falcons crowd is stunned.
The Saints win. Somehow. The Saints win.
Alvin Kamara has been targeted 19 times today. He has 14 catches for 122 yards. He also has 16 carries for 66 yards. Falcons have no answer.
RT @KlutchSports: We officially welcome @AntDavis23! https://t.co/2rxOQG058f
Drew Brees: 35-44, 374 yards, 3TDs, 124.8 rating.		Matt Ryan: 26-35, 274 yards, 5 TDs, 148.1 rating.
That 7-yard TD run by Drew Brees is tied for the fourth longest of his career.
The Saints DL came up huge on that drive there. Totally dominated the Falcons OL.
Drew Brees is 30 of 38 for 324 yards and 3 TDs.
Bryan Poole has missed a handful of tackles today, none more embarrassing ‚Äî or costly ‚Äî than that one.
Wow. Drew Brees somehow eludes two Falcons tacklers in the open field and the Saints tie the game at 37.
Sean Payton‚Äôs game plan has to be eat up the rest of the clock, try to score a TD and go for 2 to end the game and escape with a win. Would be the smartest thing he could do considering his team‚Äôs defensive shortcomings.
The Falcons have 1 first down rushing and 18 first downs passing.
Ryan hits Sanu for the 2-pointer and the Falcons extend their lead to 37-30. Saints in another track meet.
Matt Ryan is 24 of 32 for 362 yards and 5 TDs. His passer rating is 151.3. A perfect rating is 158.3 by the way.
Brutal penalty there on David Onyemata on the FG there. Gives ATL a first down at the 5.
This is an even bigger track meet than I anticipated. Crazy offense (and bad defense) here at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
Zach Line, Cam Meredith and Ted Ginn Jr. have scored TDs for the Saints today. Not your usual combo platter of scorers.
Zach Line gets the short pass and barrels through a tackle for a TD. Saints take the lead.
Sean Payton calls timeout to think this one over. Saints have a fourth-and-goal at the 1. Seems like Taysom time, but what do I know?
The modern-day Jim Thorpe.
P.J. Wiliams is having a rough, rough day.
Again, I have no idea why the Falcons are trying to run the ball.
This really does feel like a game where whoever has the ball last is going to win. Neither defense capable of stopping the other offense so far.
I have no idea why the Falcons are trying to run the ball.
Cameron Meredith‚Äôs first catch as a Saint goes for a TD and the Saints take the lead 22-21.
Alex Okafor with the blocked punt and the Saints return it to the Falcons‚Äô 16-yard line.
The Saints suddenly are a penalty-hemorrhaging machine. They now have 7 for 100 yards.
Beasley timed the snap count perfectly before making that last sack. Not much Ramczyk could do.
Is Patrick Mahomes already the best player in the NFL?
Officials reviewing this replay a long time before making a ruling on Ridley‚Äôs TD.
Matt Ryan could have read the Iliad &amp; the Odyssey before completing that last TD throw to Calvin Ridley, the rookie‚Äôs third on the day. Falcons lead 20-16, pending XP.
It doesn‚Äôt look good for Patrick Robinson, who was visually in pain as doctors treated him. Cart is on the field. He couldn‚Äôt put weight on his leg.
My goodness. The Saints pass defense is a disaster.
The Saints have wisely taken advantage of Deion Jones‚Äô absence. Brees targeted RBs &amp; TEs for 15 of his 26 targets in the first half. Alvin Kamara was targeted 11 times for 7 receptions.
Ken Crawley is coming in for P.J. Williams. That didn‚Äôt last long.
Calvin Ridley now was 5 receptions for 129 yards and 2 TDs. I think most if not all of it has come vs. P.J. Williams.
Calvin Ridley beats Williams for a 75-yard TD connection and the Falcons take a 14-13 lead.
The substitution of P.J. Williams for Ken Crawley hasn‚Äôt turned out so well so far.
Drew Brees is the NFL‚Äôs new career leader in pass completions with 6,301.
Marcus Williams got away with a DPI there. Saints fortunate the refs didn‚Äôt make the call.
With that last completion, Drew Brees tied Brett Favre as the NFL‚Äôs all-time leader in pass completions with 6,300.
Marcus Davenport record his first career sack.
Drew Brees has moved past Peyton Manning into second place on the NFL‚Äôs all-time pass attempts list. He now has 9,385 attempts. Brett Favre leads with 10,169.
The Falcons go after P.J. Williams for consecutive completions to tie the score at 7.

Saints head coach Sean Payton and Browns defensive coordinator Gregg Williams exchanged an emotional bro hug at midfield after the Saints' 21-18 win. They're never going to be BFFs but the respect between the two men is obvious.
Browns gonna Browns...
Brees to Thomas and the Saints complete the inevitable to take a 16-12 lead. They'll now go for 2. 2:30 left.
Taysom time
And the Saints pick a great time to force their first tunover of the season. Marcus Williams makes a great read and picks Tyrod Taylor, then returns it 22 yards to the Cleveland 18.
Gregg Williams just exchanged a round of fist bumps with fellow assistants and players after dialing up that last sack by T.J. Carrie. Browns force a punt and have the ball with 5:52 to play, lading 12-10.
This seems like a good time to remind everyone that the Browns have lost 21 consecutive road games.
Browns gonna Browns.
And a chorus of boos rains down on the field after Te'o misses that tackle and the Browns get the first down. Cleveland goes to the 4th quarter with a shocking 12-3 lead.
Stats are almost even with 3:15 left:		First downs: CLE 9, NO 10	Total yards: CLE 152, NO 153	Plays: CLE 38, NO 39	Avg. gain: CLE 4.0, NO 3.9		The difference:	TOs: CLE 0, NO 2
Hyde gets in with an incredible effort from the 1 and the Browns have taken a 12-3 lead with 6:43 left in the 3rd quarter, pending XP.
The Browns went after Marshon Lattimore on those last two plays before the Landry reception.
And a chorus of boos breaks out at the Superdome as the Browns stuff the Saints on third-and-1. Punt.
Sean Payton bends the ear of Drew Brees after that ugly 2-minute offense drive. Brees with a pair of uncharacteristically poor reads at the line of scrimmage.
RT @jkatzenstein: Tommylee Lewis (knee) is questionable to return for the Saints.
The Browns finally figuring out that they need to get the ball to Jarvis Landry. Back-to-back catches for the former LSU star has Cleveland at the 21.
Wow. Lutz shanks the 34-yard field goal attempt wide left and we remain tied 3-3. Vastly different game this week than last...
The Browns can not tackle Alvin Kamara. Join the club.
Credit the interior of the Saints DL for that last fourth-down stop. They stacked the line and Crawley, Davis cleaned it up.
RT @MichaelDeMocker: Aaaand there‚Äôs another fumble. https://t.co/RZVvfN8oB8
Saints lost 10 fumbles last season and nine in 2016. They have now lost four in less than six quarters.
Brees had Ginnn wide open on that play-action but Brees' long ball hung too long and Randall had time to recover and break it up.
Got a feeling the Saints are ready to spring a big play. Offense has been quiet so far.
Saints have now held the Browns to 1 of 4 third down conversions.
Higgins with a 7-yard gain on that last reception. That's an explosive play by Browns' standards.
Sean Payton just went #SundaySean on Ben Watson after that last failed red-zone series. Something he didn't like about his route maybe on that first-down misfire with Brees.
Sarah Thomas with the DPI call there on Carrie.
Make that 8 of 10.
Alvin Kamara already has seven of the Saints' first nine touches.
That might not seem like much but Alvin Kamara just turned a 5-yard gain into a 10-yard first-down conversion by slipping tackle attempts by four Browns defenders. Saints on the march now with some momentum.
Saints defense is playing much faster today. Energy is noticeable. As is the Browns' lack of offensive firepower.

Shotgun again. I don‚Äôt get it.
Not a bad idea on the fake punt there. But the execution‚Ä¶.
LSU defense starting to show signs of being on the field for so long on those past two drives. Players looked gassed as Auburn scores the go-ahead TD. 14-10, Auburn, 1:31, 2Q.
The play counts - and yardage totals ‚Äî are evening out. Auburn about to run its 35th play compared to 36 by LSU. LSU‚Äôs edgier total yardage down to 185-170.
Not sure how that‚Äôs roughing the passer‚Ä¶ Nevertheless, a huge momentum swing here for Auburn.
Auburn answers with a 10-play TD drive and we have a ball game. LSU‚Äôs lead trimmed to 10-7, 5:06, 2Q.
LSU takes a 10-0 lead. But it feels like it should be more.
LSU is about to run its 33 offensive play of the first half. Auburn, meanwhile, has run 17. Huge disparity in this sweltering 92-degree heat.
LSU is 6 of 8 on third down and has outgained Auburn 179-63 in total offense. The Tigers have first down at the Auburn 18 and desperately need to cash in here.
Sweet 33-yard back-shoulder connection from Burrow to Jefferson. Tigers back in business in Auburn territory.
Cole Tracy sails a 53-yard FG attempt wide right and LSU‚Äôs lead remains at 7-0 with 29 seconds left in the first quarter. Auburn takes over at the 35.
Big stop by LSU there on 4th-and-1. Tigers take over. Have never understood using shotgun in short yardage. Stidham took the snap 5 yards back from the LoS and LSU defenders easily penetrated in the backfield to stop Whitlow. Makes zero sense.
After two drives, LSU has outgained Auburn 77-2 in total offense and four first downs to zero.
Joe Burrow would like to have that one back. He had Jefferson wide open and led him into the sideline. This one is going to be tough to overturn.
This game could not have started much better for #LSU. Now, we‚Äôll see what Joe Burrow &amp; Co. can do with their second possession. LSU takes over at its own 31, leading 7-0, 9:34, 1Q.
A very impressive opening drive for OC Steve Ensminger.
Direct snap to Clyde Edwards-Helaire and he punches it in from the 1. LSU leads 7-0, 9:59, 1Q.
Joe ‚ÄúNo Slide‚Äù burrow lowers his head and gets to the 1 on a read-option.
Joe Burrow is 3 for 4 for 57 yards and has converted two third downs through the air.
LSU going hurry-up on offense.
Whoa. Huge start for LSU. Grant Delpit intercepts Stidham on the second snap of the game. LSU in business at the Auburn 34.

Suddenly, a defensive slugfest has broken out at the Superdome. Three consecutive punts to open the second half.
The Bucs are averaging 9.2 yards a play. The Saints are averaging 8.3 yards a play.
That was a very big stop by the Saints defense there inside their own 5. Remember that goal-line stand‚Ä¶.
Bucs have not shied away from going after Marshon Lattimore today. And they‚Äôve had success.
Saints have really struggled with containment today. Probably something they thought they didn‚Äôt have to worry about with Ryan Fitzpatrick.
In 62 plays, the Saints &amp; Bucs combined for 560 yards and 55 points in the first half. Their 11 offensive series produced 6 TDs, 2 FGs, 1 punt, 1 turnover and 1 end of half.

Man, it‚Äôs going to be a long year in Buffalo. Wow.
Payton not surrendering here. He‚Äôs going to use all of his timeouts and make Bucs punt the football, assuming it leads to that.
First half QB stats are eye-popping:		Drew Brees: 17-21 238 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs. Rating: 145.6		Ryan Fitzpatrick: 11-14, 210 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs. Rating: 158.3.
This is the second most points the Saints have allowed in the first half in the Sean Payton-Drew Brees era. Falcons scored 35 in first half of their game in W17 of 2016 season.
Sean Payton just went #SundaySean on line judge Julian Mapp right now after he whistled the last completion to Mike Thomas dead. Replays showed he was never touched down by the Bucs defense.
Got a feeling Gillislee is going to get his first taste of #SundaySean.
Mike Gillislee fumbles on his 3rd carry as a Saint and Justin Evans returns it 31 yards for a TD. Bucs lead 31-17. Dome is eerily quiet right now.
Not sure if Todd Monken or Dirk Koetter is calling the Bucs‚Äô offensive plays but they‚Äôre doing a job right now. Bucs have 276 totals yards (10.2 yep) and have scored on all four of their offensive possessions.
James Winston might be getting Wally Fitz‚Äôd.
Ryan Fitzpatrick is 11 for 14 for 210 yards, 2TDs and a perfect 158.3 passer rating.
Ryan Fitzpatrick hits Godwin for a TD and the Dome goes quiet. Bucs lead Saints 23-17, pending XP.
Ryan Fitzpatrick is 9 for 12 for 199 yards for a passer rating of 144.4. He has also rushed for 13 yards and a TD.

Terrific pass pro there by the Saints OL and FB Zach Line. They pick up the Bucs blitz and give Brees time to find Thomas for a big gain. Doesn‚Äôt get any better than that.
The Bucs are averaging 14.3 yards per play. The Saints are averaging 7.8 yards per play.
Total combined points in Saints-Bucs: 24.	Totals combined points in 7 other NFL games: 32.
The Bucs pull a little trickery, using a read-option with veteran QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, who plows through Marcus Williams for a TD. Bucs lead 14-10, 1:58, 1Q.
Not a great start for Marcus Williams.

Green Wave freshman running back Amare Jones can play. The Frisco, Texas native just scored his first career TD. Tulane got a good one in Jones. And the Green Wave leads 42-17.
This one is just about over now. Nicholls botches a punt snap and Tulane takes over at the Colonels‚Äô 27, leading 35-17, 6:35 to play.
Corey Dauphine is having himself a night. HIs third long TD run, this one for 25 yards, puts Tulane up 35-17, 8:47, 4Q.

It appears that Central Florida and South Florida are the best college football teams in the Sunshine State. And at this point, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much of an argument.
Dontrell Taylor goes 32 yards for a TD and Nicholls trims Tulane‚Äôs lead to 28-16, pending XP, 12:47, 4Q.
Tonight is the first time Tulane has had a 100-yard rusher and 10-yard receiver in the same game since 9-19-2015. Corey Dauphine has 120 rushing yards. Darnell Mooney has 111 receiving yards.
Darnell Mooney is having himself a game. His 12-yard touchdown catch gives him six catches for 111 yards. Tulane now leads 28-10 after that 95-yard scoring drive.
That‚Äôs four personal foul penalties against the Tulane defense tonight. Not good.
Chase Fourcade hits Gabe Fuselier for a 6-yard TD pass with 23 seconds left in the half and Nicholls closes the Tulane lead to 21-10.
Nicholls has new life here at the end of the first half. After forcing a fumble from Jonathan Banks in the final 2 minutes, Chase Fourcade hits Dai‚ÄôJean Dixon for a big gain to the Green Wave 1-yard line. Nicholls has 1st-and-goal at the 1, 1:04, 2Q/
Jonathan Banks bulls his way into the end zone for a 5-yard TD run and Tulane opens a 21-3 lead on Nicholls. Somewhere @cverdin34 is feeling anxious‚Ä¶.

LSU completely dominating Miami on third down so far. Canes are 0 for 5 on offensive conversion attempts. While LSU is only 2 for 6, two of its failed attempts got within a yard and led to 4th down conversions.
LSU dominating Miami across both lines of scrimmage. Tigers extend lead to 17-3.
The Tigers are having trouble blocking Gerald Willis.
LSU catches Miami in a safety blitz and Nick Brossette goes 50 yards untouched up the middle for the TD. Big momentum change there. LSU leads 10-3.
LSU guard Adrian Magee is carted to the locker room. He has his head down as the cart leaves the field.
One team. One heartbeat. One defender short.

My take from Thursday night... https://t.co/7xdKhRlBro
https://t.co/9ZcMl3y310
@jvlauro @NickGertz3 Totally different style players. I think both are talented and have shown promise.
In seven series vs. Chargers &amp; Rams, Taysom Hill led the Saints to four touchdowns and a field goal. One other drive ended on downs. The other resulted in a punt.
@jvlauro I think both players will be part of the long-term evaluation at QB. Don‚Äôt see it as a one or the other proposition.
@jvlauro Don‚Äôt feel any differently today than I did last week
In four preseason games, Taysom Hill completed 73.5 percent of his passes (36 of 49) for 365 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, for a rating of 90.9. He also rushed for a team-high 161 yards, which ranked sixth in the NFL.
Tulane falls 23-17 in overtime as Wake Forest escapes with a hard-fought win.
Wake goes 75 yards in 9 plays and re-takes the lead 17-14 on a 19-yard TD reception by Alex Bachman, his second of the game. 14:35, 4Q.
Air Green Wave! Jonathan Banks hits Encalade for a 74-yard bomb, their second TD connection of the game, and Tulane takes a 14-10 lead, 1:42 left, 3rd quarter.
Jonathan Banks hits Terren Encalade for a 52-yard bomb and the Green Wave tie the game 7-7.
Wake Forest finally breaks the scoreless stalemate. Freshman QB Sam Hartman hits Alex Bachman for a 10-yard TD pass. Wake leads Tulane 7-0, 6:45, 2Q.
Wake has a good one in redshirt freshman wide receiver Sage Surrat. He‚Äôs already caught six passes for 86 yards. Wake has only 123 yards total offense.
No score between Tulane and Wake Forest here late in the first quarter. Teams have combined for 6 first downs in six offensive series. This one looks like a carbon copy of the 2016 opener between the teams, which Wake won 7-3.

@NajyMasri Possibly. But I would think Bridgewater and his agent are going to want to play/start somewhere in 2019. CAn‚Äôt see him sitting behind Brees for another year after missing 16-17-18 seasons. Maybe he does, but seems unlikely.
Former Louisville Cardinal great hangs up his cleats. H/t to @Mattbarrows for the great line he‚Äôs clearly been waiting years to write. https://t.co/xjDd4Wgv6U
@Hailwhodats @AndrewJuge Agree 100 percent.
@AndrewJuge Understood. Just don‚Äôt see Bridgewater agreeing to re-sign with Saints in '19 with Brees around. Would think he &amp; his agent would seek a starting opportunity with starter $$$. He will have basically missed 16-17-18 seasons. Could be wrong, but can‚Äôt see him sitting out ‚Äô19, too.
@rhema120 Teddy, like most players, wants to PLAY. He‚Äôs not going to play this year unless Brees gets hurt. Maybe he is willing to sit and wait but I can‚Äôt see him agreeing to sit another season. He‚Äôd be wasting prime years of his career as a backup. And this doesn‚Äôt take into account $$$
@ocsaint1 Agreed. Presents a possible conundrum next offseason.
@DigwhatIsay Not sure. He‚Äôs indicated that he wants to keep playing. Of course, that could change if he wins it all. Big ‚Äúif,‚Äù of course.
On and off the court, David West was a stud. Great player. Great career. Great dude. https://t.co/RSXcn0A7qN
@DallasWhoDats You might be right. But it‚Äôs difficult to say any compensatory pick is ‚Äúhighly likely‚Äù for a team that historically has never acquired them. A lot of variables in play there.
Bottom line on the Bridgewater trade: The Saints gave themselves future options at QB, most of which are reliant on what happens in 2018. Seems unlikely that both Brees AND Bridgewater are on the roster in 2019.
@DallasWhoDats By what metric are you measuring Bridgewater vs. Smith?
RT @1manueltorres: It's been 13 years, and Aug. 29 still sucks @NOLAnews editorial https://t.co/bR5G0eTAr6
@gemmom24 I think they are giving themselves options.
Drew Brees has started 190 of 192 games in 12 seasons with the Saints. Missed the '09 finale to rest after Saints locked up top seed &amp; missed '15 game @ CAR because of shoulder. So probability of Bridgewater seeing the field in #NOLA is low. Then again, Brees turns 40 in January.
RT @SaintsNOW: Drew Brees isn't on the way out just yet, but what does Teddy Bridgewater joining the #Saints mean for the rest of the quart‚Ä¶
Yes, indeed. I was there. Score was closer than the actual game. Outcome was never in doubt. https://t.co/pr0pI5IEZT
@saintsfan9472 I expect them both to make it.
@saintsfan9472 Fair point. But they play different positions. Not always an apples-to-apples comparison. Salaries come into play, as well.
@saintsfan9472 I think Watson makes it. But can‚Äôt call him a lock after his camp. Saints coaches like LeRibeus‚Äô versatility and experience.
@jwmillersports1 Given their collegiate track records, makes sense‚Ä¶.
@LarryBarber613 Not paranoid at all. Perfectly logical consideration.
Sounds like a promising prospect. Any idea where he went to college? https://t.co/cEcASVmhqi
@Andrewjbe So were Tyrod Taylor and Jameis Winston.
I stand corrected: Forgot Bridgewater was an injury replacement in the 2016 Pro Bowl.
Statements from Saints GM Mickey Loomis &amp; head coach Sean Payton on the Teddy Bridgewater acquisition: https://t.co/51YHquTOII
@9under Not negative. Just being realistic. Gotta call it like I see it. Could definitely work out for them in the long run.
Several variables in play here for Saints after today‚Äôs trade. Among them:		1. Brees‚Äô status beyond 2018;	2. Bridgewater‚Äôs desire to be a starter; 	3. Hill‚Äôs development;	4. 2019 salary cap implications.
@TomHJC Could be wrong but I don‚Äôt see him making the roster.
The latest projection... New Orleans #Saints 53-man roster projections: Teddy Bridgewater, Tanner McEvoy shake things up https://t.co/i1JnhgcQ0j
Would likely require an injury to Brees to initiate the incentives, but notable nonetheless... https://t.co/sLPmz5bN33
Excellent points here... https://t.co/333IBmiClX
Barring future deals, the Saints will enter the 2019 draft without first- (Marcus Davenport) and third-round picks (Bridgewater) because of trades this year.
Saints paid a steep price for Bridgewater. A third-round pick is what Washington &amp; Cleveland gave up for starting QBs Alex Smith &amp; Tyrod Taylor.
It‚Äôs never a bad thing to have another Louisville man in the building.

@WhoDatCatsFan I could not have been more wrong. Admittedly‚Ä¶.
Agreed. Strongest QB room of Brees-Payton era. https://t.co/UGpaqnbpvu
Bridgewater deal feels like a 2018 move. Guess is the team feels Hill needs more time and doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with Savage as the primary backup this season. Saints assume Bridgewater‚Äôs $5M base salary for this season.

@ryanbrees Played QB in HS.
Would be fun to see the Saints run a package with Taysom Hill, Tanner McEvoy &amp; Ted Ginn Jr., on the field together. All three are capable of passing, running or catching the football.
My guess is the Saints are looking at Tanner McEvoy to bolster their TE position. He‚Äôs 6-6, 230. In fact, they might just have another ‚ÄúSlash‚Äù on their hands. McEvoy played safety, running back, quarterback and receiver at the University of Wisconsin.

I‚Äôm guessing the same misguided people that like strawberry/apple/blackberry over grape jelly in their PB&amp;Js also mistakenly prefer Thin Mints to Samoas. #FlawedPalettes
