Suspension of #ACA med device tax + effort to replace #Medicare SGR = $200+ billion/10 years BEFORE talks on budget deal even start. @BGOV

Changes to #ACA to end #shutdown - repeal/delay of reinsurance "belly button" tax &amp; verify income for exchange subsidies - NOT minor. @BGOV
Repeal of #ACA "belly button" tax could make insurers go belly up. The tax funds risk pools to protect against adverse selection. @BGOV
Inclusion of income verification for #ACA subsidies in possible #shutdown deal could depress enrollment &amp; hit insurer's bottom lines. @BGOV
Possible inclusion of income verification for #ACA subsidies a legitimate response, in part, by GOP to fraud &amp; abuse concerns. @BGOV
Income verification requirement for #ACA subsidies as part of #shutdown deal could raise access concerns similar to voter ID laws. @BGOV
