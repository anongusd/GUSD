2/2 Do you see a pyramid with radio waves coming out of it, or train tracks going through a tunnel? 🤔 I'm curious... #EgyptStation
1/ 2 Thanks for all of your questions @Twitter. Now I have one for you...	When you look at the #EgyptStation logo [below] https://t.co/LZUvwS0M7r
It varies from day to day! One day I'd like 'I Don't Know' another day I like 'Happy With You' or 'Caesar Rock' but I go through periods of liking each one for different reasons! https://t.co/cJo7gqk4Il
Good question, and it has a long answer. More to follow on this in 'You Gave Me The Answer' at the end of the month! #EgyptStation https://t.co/zaU6TbKBAx https://t.co/05NY1Aj1l9
Oh yeah the patch! Maybe we could do it? It's a logo that was dreamed up by two of our design team - Mike and Rebecca - so I will see if we can make it available. #EgyptStation https://t.co/zQ7KzYRDP8
Yes we are! I'm not sure when or where *wink wink* but they're great and I think it would be a nice idea... #EgyptStation https://t.co/VqSZ9MZPDd
No, I had written most of the album before I was in Australia. I did write a couple of little things in Australia, but at the moment they're just sketches. But if they ever work out I'll let you know! #EgyptStation https://t.co/CDKPYreQfF
Oh thanks! They're subjects that interest me &amp; the nice thing about being a songwriter is you can sometimes make a difference with a song. If you don't lay it on too thick and become preachy then I think it can influence people's thoughts in a good way. That's what I hope anyway! https://t.co/zfSQlL1xNS
..to the piano (in this case) &amp; work through the problem - whatever it is - and come out the other end feeling better. I think it makes the song more real and I thought people can identify with this song-I think everyone knows that feeling. It's kind of good to put it in a song!
One of the interesting things about writing is that you can be in a bad mood through something that happened and you try and work that out through the song. A lot of songwriters have done it throughout history and it's good because you tell your troubles... https://t.co/J5RJw56l2T
These days it's a lot of fun to do that so we use modern tech in the same way @thebeatles used the technology of the day when we were recording. #EgyptStation
I was working with @RyanTedder and his co producer Zach and they were playing around with a device which sped up vocals so you could sing in one octave and it would play it back the octave above. https://t.co/hP6cLhilo7
... 'My Valentine', which we were originally going to do just how we usually do, on the piano with the band. But we thought of this new way to do it. But it was originally his idea, Arturo Perez, who had some nice ideas for the show and that was one of them!
The Director of the show had the idea to sing something through a megaphone. Well, i've seen Bono do it, but it's more on louder songs or like an announcement. I thought it would be great to bring it down and use it very intimately, and that made me think of the song... https://t.co/ywVEOuQxnp
Yeah! The most recent was 'Mission Impossible'. And years ago, when we first met, we watched the film about Bobby Kennedy. https://t.co/r6kdECbtfX
That was one that I made up in my own studio, with just me and my engineer, Steve. It has some kind of slightly experimental ideas on it. I wasn't doing it for anything in particular, but then I liked the vibe and made it into a song. The original version was much longer! https://t.co/JPTdgvH49b
I wanted to do what I would call an 'album' album, rather than a collection of singles. So once we thought that and the title #EgyptStation we then thought  we could go on a train journey from the opening station through all the stops on the way, until we reached the destination! https://t.co/C5fQeBy1bg
@ulisesbeppo #EgyptStation 🎨 https://t.co/fwPrNjU0KX
... of New Year's ago, when he played a New Year's gig. I've always been a big fan.
I can't think of other songs he has inspired, but those two definitely. I was always a big fan. I went to see him in concert a few times and wrote to him saying how much I enjoyed his guitar playing particularly. I met him a few times. The last time was a couple... https://t.co/Pd46KkzB4J
Yeah I would. When I do electronic music it tends to be me as 'The Nutty Professor' in his lab! But, I wouldn't rule the idea out. https://t.co/HpNXfpT8gU
No, it was written before Brexit! It's about climate change denial. So I made up a Captain sailing a boat into disaster, despite repeated warnings! https://t.co/crWFFQCJZj
Anyway, 'Matching Teeth'. I still think it's a pretty good album title!
Yeah I did actually! The track ‘Caesar Rock’ ends with 'she's got matching teeth', so it was nearly called 'Matching Teeth'. I just thought that was hilarious! I'm not quite sure how that came about - maybe i'd seen something I misread which often happens! https://t.co/RsPaBol3tK
Yeah it is different. Working in my own studio I tend to be a little bit more experimental. 'Caesar Rock' was done in my home studio originally and then finished in Henson in LA. So I think that's the difference, I sometimes feel a bit more free in my own studio. #EgyptStation https://t.co/Pf5BZyjH7A
No that normally happens when you've just got a melody and you don’t have any words, so you just put in a substitute lyric to remind yourself how it goes. But I can't think of anything on this album that needed that process... #EgyptStation https://t.co/Z42cTxhjPv
I did a painting a few years ago which involved Egyptian iconograpy that I put together from various books. And I named the painting #EgyptStation So that's why! Oh, and the painting turned out to be the album cover and title! 👨‍🎨 https://t.co/WyZ5sMa5l3
