@tzerigawa @bryanbehar About Hillary he was worried about Bernie. WikiLeaks shared the hacked emails between the chair of the dnc and Hillary after the DNC primaries. Bernie should have fought it but knew the Democratic party was fracturing. So in hopes to bring it back together he concededat the Cnvtn
@tzerigawa @bryanbehar Has it occurred to you, Fuck the Evangelicals. Independent voters make up 45% of registered voters, Democrats 29% thats what is. Now if only all the Indies could've voted in the Primaries, Who would've recieved the Dem Nomination. Oh ya, Hillary. Can't u c djt wasn't worried

Bernie is anIndependent Democrat both Parties Ideals combined Infrastructure, Education,Healthcare,Income equality,Environment, All issues that matter to me. 	Issues that needs a person who cares about America and the World. Not money over people, Not Party over people. People!!!
They bumped Bernie out from Democratic nomination and kept the lessor threat to them in. For all we know Every level of government seat that filled the House and Senate Republican majority were meddled. Putin succeeded If he was trying to F**k the USA.
Bernie early. So now we know Donald's campaign colluded with Russia and WikiLeaks, Cambridge, They knew Bernie was going to be tough to beat if he were nominated. Don't you think that those guys manipulated the DNC primaries  they are proven to manipulate the Election of Trump.
We already know now that Russia played a huge role disrupting our Voting processes, possibly undermining the DNC in some way turning voters away from HRC, uncovering emails between the DNC chair and HRC. Didn't help her! That with the voter suppression I mentioned eliminated
Allowed him. Those who do have the power to stop him but don't, Obviously the majority of Republicans in the House and Senate are Involved in one way or the other, I truthfully, reluctantly voted for HRC. Voting the lessor of two Candidates that a shrowd of discrepancy cloaked.
I am positive this happened all across the country, and also positive many of you Supported Bernie's Ideals. We really need to convince the Democrats to pull together. Independents and Democrats can Change This Insane unreal time. Don't just blame Donald but the people who have
There are millions of us Independent voters could have changed the outcome early in the Primaries, Those of us living in States like NY only accept votes from 2 parties, Democrat and Republican If you ask me Is voter suppression. I wanted Bernie but couldn't vote in the Primaries

@deppraw Think about it,. Russians wanted trump and knew bernie was going to be tough competition do by hacking the dnc primaries it would put Hillary in and there was a lot about Hillary in question just threw a lot of people running in the other direction

And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.		Greed has poisoned men‚Äôs souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
- if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other‚Äôs happiness - not by each other‚Äôs misery. We don‚Äôt want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone.
I Nominate Charlie Chaplin for the Nobel Peace Prize, Told this speech in a movie ,The Great Dictator 1940's film		I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be an emperor. That‚Äôs not my business. I don‚Äôt want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone
