@SafetyPinDaily This is not correct, McCabe was working on questioning Trump's actions with a counterintelligence investigation that he began before he left office. It is clear that Comey &amp; McCabe were trying to do something within legal bounds.

We did this for 911 &amp; Katrina quickly with results.
@SRuhle @InStyle Gorgeous jumpsuit on Feb 6 program--where can we get it?
