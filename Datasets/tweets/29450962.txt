Thank you for all of the kind birthday wishes. I still feel good, I feel young. I’m ready to keep fighting, to keep pushing, to keep getting in good trouble, necessary trouble so that we may continue to build the beloved community. #GoodTrouble
Immigration status should not be an excuse to treat people in an inhumane way. We should make it easier, not harder, for people who have the desire to pursue an education to get one. I am proud to introduce this bill with Rep. Gallego. #HigherEdDreamAct https://t.co/Q7t7SsR9kJ
We mourn the unspeakable loss of life one year ago today at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, but I continue to be inspired by the commitment of the student survivors to nonviolent protest and direct action to bring an end to gun violence in America.
This nation has lost one of the great legislators of our time.  Rep. John Dingell was a man who did not hesitate to stand up, speak up and speak out for those who were left out and left behind. He will be deeply missed. https://t.co/CfpGqsVRvw
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was my hero, my mentor, my friend, and my brother. We honor his legacy by celebrating this holiday as a day on, not a day off. It is a day of action, a day of love, to give of ourselves to others and begin anew the building of the beloved community.
Thank you, @Delta! https://t.co/ne7y8PdQlA
Wishing everyone a happy and safe Christmas holiday.

VOTE! Do your part. Honor the sacrifice of those who marched and protested, those who were beaten and left bloody, those who gave the last full measure of devotion so that each and every one of us can exercise our right to vote. You can change America. #goodtrouble
Never give up, never give in, never give out. Keep the faith and keep your eyes on the prize. Each and every vote matters. Do your part and vote like you’ve never voted before. Believe in the power of love and together we will build the Beloved Community here in America.

There is no room in our society for gun violence and especially not in a place of worship. Elected officials must stop fanning the flames of hatred, bitterness, and division. We must condemn these terrible acts in the strongest possible terms and work to heal these deep wounds.
I am grateful to local, state, and federal law enforcement as well as the U. S. Postal Service for their efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the attempted mail bombings. Hate is too heavy a burden to bear. Love is the better way.
The right to vote is precious, almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool or instrument we have in a democratic society. Let nothing stand in your way to use it so that together we may build a truly more perfect union here in America. #vote #GoodTrouble

It's hard not to see parallels to the Civil Rights Movement when reporters were threatened, beaten, &amp; attacked for attempting to shine a light on injustices perpetrated in the Deep South. The administration’s weak &amp; feeble response demonstrates whose side they really fight for.
Greed and power can never be allowed to conspire to extinguish a human life. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi is a vicious attack on the press, on free speech, and basic human rights.
I am sick and outraged over the murder of journalist and American permanent resident Jamal Khashoggi. The President and his administration have failed to uphold their duty to the Constitution and to the rule of law by turning a blind-eye to this demonic act.

53 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law by President Johnson.

As we face challenges and uncertainty around the globe, it makes no sense to turn your back to progress, to ignore the pleas of our allies, and to disregard wise counsel and hard core facts.  The price of peace is persistence, but the cost of war is always too high.
To this very day, experts and allies agree that the agreement was working to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Iran cannot have nuclear weapons—but the United States must be a headlight and not a taillight, leading the world on the path to peace through the hard, necessary work of diplomacy.
Nearly 3 years ago, I supported the agreement after constant study, briefings, and discussions. During the debate on the House Floor, I warned that we could not let the perfect be the enemy of the good in the quest for nonviolence, especially when the alternative is nonexistence.
Never before has the credibility of the United States been so undermined by a gross failure to honor our commitments.
It is a sad and dark hour for our nation and the global family.  This administration’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is a major blow to all those working to bring peace to the world community.
I believe we have a right to know what is in the water we drink, the food we eat, and the air we breathe. On this #EarthDay, we must resolve to do all that we can to leave this planet we call Earth a little cleaner and a little greener for generations yet unborn. #goodtrouble

It is painful to witness firsthand this attack on the remaining pillars of nonpartisan, governance, rules, and procedures, but it is unfathomable and unconscionable to attack our country’s national security personnel and apparatus for political cover and gain.
The frantic, desperate release of this memo leads us down a dangerous path of political spin and accusations instead of thoughtful, responsible, congressional oversight.
I never thought that I would witness the dismantling of the checks and balances of our country, and I never imagined that Republicans would cast aside the national security interests of our nation.
This is a dark hour and a sad day in the history of our nation.  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to protect the goodwill of the United States and to serve as an inspiration to the global community for whom the dream of democracy is a beacon of hope and light.

Yesterday taxpayers stood up and spoke out against Republicans lining the pocket of their donors by any means necessary. Did you hear their cries? Can you feel their pain? You did not, Mr. Speaker. You chose to turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. This bill is a shame and a disgrace.
I’ve said on many occasions that you cannot get blood from a turnip, and you cannot justify robbing poor Peter to pay billionaire Paul. I urge all of my colleagues to be on the right side of history and to vote against this bill.
Working and middle class families, the sick, the elderly, and generations yet unborn will bear the burden of this reckless act.
I oppose this conference report with every bone in my body. This tax bill is a $2.3 trillion holiday gift for Wall Street, the rich, and the wealthy. Conceived in darkness and birthed with the help of donors and funders. This bill is not for the people. It is not tax reform.

This spiteful, irresponsible tax cut is not worth the paper on which it is written.
Away from the cameras, Congressional Republicans will quietly begin to cut safety net programs to pay for their massive, corporate tax cut.
After this markup, after the winners pocket their rewards, the spotlight will move on. Every person in this room knows what will happen next
Most importantly, how can you bury your head in the sand when there are grave issues facing our country?
How can you attack immigrant children and DREAMers in a way that is just plain mean and heartless?
How can you target the sick, the elderly, and the disabled?
How can we punish teachers who are just trying to buy supplies for their classrooms?
This tax cut legislation does not make the tax code any simpler or any fairer. This bill is a slap in the face to real people.

... that drives someone to a point where they are willing to murder innocent people, of all places in the house of the Lord.
It is not just one person pulling the trigger, it is what's in our environment, in our makeup...
How many more shootings must we endure? How many more human beings must be murdered before we say we must put an end to gun violence?

I am very excited to be joining @SenGillibrand tomorrow at 3:30pm for a twitter chat about the Voter Empowerment Act
Today, the battle for every American to have the opportunity to freely exercise their right to vote is still not over.
Finally, President Johnson said, “And we shall overcome” and I watched a single tear roll down Dr. King’s cheek.
“For, with a country as with a person, ‘what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?’”
“Many were brutally assaulted. One good man, a man of God, was killed.”
“There, long suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans.”
Pres. Johnson continued “So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama.”
“At times, history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom.”
My heart leapt as President Johnson began, “I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of Democracy.”
I was sitting next to Dr. King 48 years ago today when I watched President Johnson give one of the most moving speeches I have ever heard

Shocked by the brutality of the attacks, President Johnson convened a joint session of Congress to call for a Voting Rights Act
We were beaten, tear-gassed, and trampled by horses at the hands of Alabama State Troopers because we wanted to register and vote.
