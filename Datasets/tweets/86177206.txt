ARPA-E should get no taxpayer funding. Why? Its authorization ran out 5 yrs ago, that's why! Support @RepGosar amendment #24 to HR 5895. Save money!
Mark Gabriel = bad swamp bureaucrat. Crimes occurred, millions of taxpayer dollars lost. Support @RepGosar amendment #29 to HR 5895, cut his pay to $1.
Draining the swamp includes getting rid of bad bureaucrats. On Mark Gabriel's watch, millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on fraudulent transactions. Support @RepGosar amendment #29 to HR 5895, cut his salary to $1!

Mark Gabriel is an unelected bureaucrat that runs out-of-control bureaucracy and doesn't seem to care. Since it's virtually impossible to fire him, support @RepGosar amendment #29 to HR 5895, reduce his salary to $1.
Taxpayers need not pay for ARPA-E — its authorization ran out five years ago, the private sector does it better anyway, and the WH recommended eliminating the program outright. Support the @RepGosar amendment #24 to HR 5895, save taxpayers' money!
Congress isn't supposed to pay for programs that haven't been authorized. ARPA-E lost its authorization 5 yrs ago. Support @RepGosar amendment #24 to HR 5895!
