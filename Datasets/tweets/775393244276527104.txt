@HariNYT Nothing new, actually! Indians love to hate Pakistanis, and vice versa! That is the ground reality! Incidents like the one we witnessed and the crowd reactions are not surprising to one who has lived there.. Will anything change? It is like mixing oil and water! Wish it did.
@MrAtkinss I agree. So ugly to look at. Pathetic.

@RajatScorpio @Satyanewshi Not to forget Chaudhary Charan Singh! Modi or not, a single party rule in a democracy is any day better. Other countries too with parliamentary system have these issues. In Presidential system, some of those pitfalls are avoided.

If his coalition does well, he may become PM but coalition politics as past shows will be disaster. My take.

@MayaKadosh @narendramodi @netanyahu That is so true. Indians (mostly) worldwide love the growing Indo-Israel friendship and it is due to efforts of many but particularly @narendramodi and @netanyahu. Another thing I would add is the current and previous Israel Ambassador to India are/were very people friendly.

@VictoryForNamo @VasuChandnani Hinduism, is actually quite  permissive of same-sex love. Centuries-old  Hindu temples depict erotic encounters between members of the same sex.  Invaders changed our the cultural liberalism. This 1860 law, I am glad, at least for the LGBQT community  is dead.
@VictoryForNamo We should not confuse the issue. Rape is a rape and will proceed accordingly. Like now. What article 377 did was it criminalized mutual consent gay relations. It was an outdated British law which I am glad was knocked out. No section of society should be discriminated against.
@SuriNavin @rishi_suri @mayfair1958 Also, I think, because petrol/oil is traded in dollars, the rupee’s exchange rate  against the dollar makes petrol more expensive. Plus, no long term strategy, stock reserves, etc etc.

@Kai_Schultz @nytimes Even ONE is one too many. While I may have some qualms about some ways and issues of UCF, India by and large will remain pluralistic as a majority of Hindus wish to live that way. Favoring one or the other over the years, in my view, has caused a paradigm shift there .
@nytimes @Kai_Schultz There might be a fringe element, here and there, but many Indian Hindus celebrate Christmas in a cultural way. I did. My relatives in India send me pictures. All is well. Why should the headline sound as if Christmas is in cross-hairs? Christmas in Saudi Arabia anyone?
