When Republicans in Congress blocked Democratic efforts to #EndGunViolence after Sandy Hook, our heart sank as a nation. The strength and courage of grieving Newtown families and the activists born of that tragedy eventually galvanized us at the ballot box to say enough!
In the last election, candidates were confronted with an urgent call for meaningful legislation to #EndGunViolence when the #Parkland shooting transformed a group of teen survivors into our national conscience. They and other young people across America made the difference!
This week, the Democratic House Majority made good on a sacred promise from the campaign trail to work to #EndGunViolence as a top priority if Democrats took back the House. Voters delivered and now they have, too. The ball‚Äôs in your court, Mitch McConnell. Do the right thing! https://t.co/Kyspwy9Qyh
