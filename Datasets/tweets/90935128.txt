@GMccathron The notion that somehow religious liberty can't exist when you're aware of other people's individual religious beliefs is preposterous. Bottom line. And "dares" to answer questions that have already been answered won't be entertained. Further comments in this vein will be removed
@GMccathron Sounds like a technical glitch. As you can clearly see--by virtue of the fact that all of your comments are clearly visible here--we are not censoring anything but the usual caveats of vulgar language, abusive language, etc.
Who said it? Question #3 of our President's Day quiz series:		"We need our faith as a source of hope. Faith teaches us that each of us is capable of redemption and, therefore, that progress is possible. Not perfection, but progress."		Which president said it?
@GMccathron As you can see, there has been no censoring of your comments here. It's very simple. Religious liberty is the reason FLI exists. Our reps in Congress are the ones who hold this precious right in their hands. So naturally, they are important to anyone who values religious liberty.
@mookiemueller The point found in this article is that the Bible is intrinsically connected with the very foundation of Western Civilization, and it's impact on history is almost impossible to overstate. Undeniably, the impact of Satanism on the foundation of our culture pales in comparison.
@mookiemueller If you believe the morality of Satanism is superior to the moral standards found in the Bible, that is your opinion. Opinion is not what we base our education system on.
@resister_sister Please re-read the article and you will find your answer. To think that this article is advocating for Christian-only religious education is to miss the entire point of the article. This is about the constitutionality of religious texts in education, not establishing a theocracy.

"It is not enough to say people have freedom of worship but not the freedom to buy land, build a church, or expand the property they already have.  For freedom of religion to be real, people need a proper space where they can worship, pray, or preach." https://t.co/0Ndj0oMA5C
Part 3: After Coach Kennedy was fired for a 30-sec., private, silent post-game prayer, he could have just given up, but he didn’t, because he knows that we must fight for our freedoms, b/c once they're lost, they're gone forever.
