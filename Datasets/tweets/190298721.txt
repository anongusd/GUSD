Story Idea: mitch mcconnell, the Art of a Bad Deal for the Senate, the Constitution and the Country
usually when you have 83 votes as majority leader, time for negotiating is over. he had all the leverage on his side, he didn't need to give potus anything, trump is so incompetent he was boxed in and mcconell caved, constitution be damned
mcconell is man of no principle. he is a an amoral person  who has no fixed positions or views. he values political power above all else
in a reckless pursuit of power he has already changed the rules of the senate once and is prepared to do so again and now he has blinked when trump threatened not to sign this latest deal, he should have called his bluff but instead chose to undermine the constitution
but the idea that mcconnel is an institutionalist is ridiculous. he lied when he prevented garland from ever getting a hearing
