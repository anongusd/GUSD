Despite what Kudlow says, Trump's criticism of the Fed is almost without precedent among modern U.S. presidents.
Larry Kudlow says Trump is not actually "calling out the Fed, quote-unquote."		"He has his views. But he‚Äôs not saying to them, ‚Äòchange your plan, do this differently.‚Äô None of that stuff. He knows the Fed is independent and he respects that.‚Äù (via pooler @agearan) https://t.co/uInu2o9CRe

Fox &amp; Friends host Steve Doocy says they'll ask Trump a couple more questions because he knows he has to go. Trump doesn't seem in a rush to get off the phone. We've crossed the 40-minute mark of this interview.
Trump calls the U.S.-Saudi Arabia relationship "excellent" during Fox &amp; Friends interview, but complains about defense costs. He was asked about what will happen if the Saudis killed journalist Jamal Khashoggi		"I have to find out what happened," he said when pressed
Fox &amp; Friends asks Trump if he will fire Sessions and Rosenstein the day after the midterms. "Well, I actually get along well with Rod," Trump says.
President Trump says on Fox &amp; Friends the only people upset with his decision to go ahead with a campaign rally last night during Hurricane Michael are the  "natural haters"
