@BargoBaller @el_budget Casual fans can't tell the difference in the games of different eras though. They just look at stats without context if it suits their preconceived narrative. However, if putting in context WOULD suit their preconceived narrative, then they WILL insert context.
@BargoBaller @el_budget New rules and strategies change sports over time. Stats looked WORSE in football in the past compared to now. A prime example of this is the fact that Kirk Cousins has a higher career passer rating than Joe Montana. Montana is clearly better though.
@BargoBaller @el_budget Because stats are lower today than they used to be in basketball, as opposed to many other sports. For example, Wilt averaged 40 ppg over a few seasons. That feat is basically impossible today.

@Trey9610 @AB__loading @FIBA if you really want to be tripped out look up "sergey prokudin-gorsky photos" they're photos from like 1910 in russia that are basically almost in HD, with no editing or colorizing.
@SportsTalkBarry Yikes this is disrespect for my boys J Cole AND Horford. Rare L.
@Trey9610 @FIBA there arent many pictures from 200 years ago since cameras were very new and basic back then. but 170~ years ago pictures become sorta common, like this one of John Q Adams. Color photos became common in the late 1960s, though there are a few terrific color photos from the 1910s https://t.co/RCF9eO9fs9
@blainehagler @FIBA I think it was a group of native mexicans and native guatemalans (the mayans) that did originally. (i guess you could call them native americans if you think broadly enough.) However, i'm pretty sure naismith did not get inspiration from their game

@Bump21Bump @tariqnasheed his twitter account @hardrock2016
@TheGargantuar @TheZakDoyle He is Native American from the seminole tribe.
@factsnotfears @TheZakDoyle He's Native american. Latinos usually have descent from people related to native americans, so i understand the confusion.
@pmojh3 @TheZakDoyle He's native american actually. People get confused because latinos are descended in large part from the native people of their countries. And the native people of those countries are related to native americans, hence the resemblance.
@rufusjonz @TheZakDoyle Native American, not Latino. People get confused because most Latinos are descended from the Native people of their own countries. And those people are related to native americans.
@TracyLawrenceMA @TheZakDoyle Online profiles can be wrong quite often.
@nvrotoxxyn @NLB83 gonna? They already have.
@KScott1982 @NolaRubiaGarcia Right on the money. I still haven't ruled out the possibility that Trump is a manipulative genius that knows exactly what he's doing, and that his goal was to convince democrats that he's just some clueless idiot. I guess we'll find out with these midterm election results.
@WynneJGriffith @stonecold2050 From his face and skin you can determine that he is either Latino or full/part native american. And his twitter account @hardrock2016 has lots of seminole nationalistic messages, as well as anti-immigrant messages. 		And also the news outlets say he's native american.
@KScott1982 @NolaRubiaGarcia I half-agree with you. I don't think he will say it, but if he does, all his followers will believe him even in the complete absence of evidence.
@KScott1982 @NolaRubiaGarcia He's native american, which is pretty much the opposite of an illegal immigrant, luckily. So Trump can't play that card.
@WynneJGriffith @stonecold2050 He's Native American. The reason he looks latino is because most Latinos have ancestry from the Native people of their countries. And those Natives happen to look a lot like Native Americans.

@AdamDodds20 @Tim_Purcell_4 @kolbesquan @nyjets There's just no excuse for completing under half your passes in a game no matter what. Rodgers was simply undeveloped those two years. BTW Sam Darnold also had 31 throws tonight, and, despite having a great first two games, idiots are already calling him a bust for one bad game.
@AdamDodds20 @Tim_Purcell_4 @kolbesquan @nyjets He made a combined total of 31 throws his first 2 years. Although 31 is a pretty small sample size, it's unlikely that if he was any good those 2 years that his passer rating would have been that abysmal, even in just a few throws.
@Schultz_Report To be fair, he's watched both QBs play for hours and hours during training camp/practice. I'm sure he knows far more about them than we do.
@ESPNStatsInfo To be fair, most teams probably have a pretty dismal record in that situation.
@Tim_Purcell_4 @kolbesquan @nyjets Some QBs just take longer to develop. Aaron Rodgers was awful his first two years, for example, with passer ratings in the 30s and 40s.

@RRkrrvAXdtFSmFo @ekdc4life2 @Sp0rtsTalkJo3 It's a pretty weak correlation though. As most people, however, haven't the time or the mental capacity to rate quarterbacks on a legitimate set of criteria, they instead insipidly resort to basing their judgement on one number, which QBs have an oft-exaggerated effect on.
@RRkrrvAXdtFSmFo @ekdc4life2 @Sp0rtsTalkJo3 There is obviously a correlation between Super Bowl wins and ability, but this is grotesquely overrated as a way of ranking quarterbacks. Notice how popular quarterbacks such as Brady or Elway had their super bowl victories in similar years, when the rest of their teams were good

@realDonaldTrump if you have nothing to hide, then you should be completely fine with #DemandAVote . 74% of us want all your tax returns!

@niconeel Well, just look it up. Do your own research instead of listening to politicians, who are intentionally trying to mislead you.
@SteveKBannon Please don't tell me this is Steve Bannon's real account.
@CNN Have you tried turning your government on and off again?
Most illegal aliens come here by plane, not on land. #BuildThatWall is completely useless and a massive waste of money.
@jaketapper Finally he says something at least half-presidential. Very rare.
@VintageSeltzer It doesn't get any more suggestive than that either.
@BrandNew535 Agreed. We need to stop calling Trump supporters names if we want them on our side.

@dpakman I suggest you do a segment on Rob Quist, who supported Bernie and is winning the Montana general election for the At-Large district.
@KyleKulinski Do a segment on @RobQuistforMT
@KyleKulinski You should have a segment on Rob Quist, a Bernie supporter who is winning this year's Montana at-large house election.
