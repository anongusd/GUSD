@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx https://t.co/yrmt5geyyc
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx Correct. The Executive Order is reversing the family separation policy that was put into place by Jeff Sessions in April. I see you have internet, but apparently no search engine like Google?
RT @FOX10Phoenix: Phoenix City Council to vote on Light Rail expansion project, as opposition continues https://t.co/NqGfGggcqF
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx You've just been trying to pursue so many different paths away from the real story here. You're making arguments even after the administration reversed course. Very odd. Also, you used my Reading is Fundamental line! You must have liked it. :)
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx If the shoe fits :) So, what exactly is your point?  You are all over the place.
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx Also, you have ONE follower, no profile info.. I knew you were a bot, but it was fun going back and forth with you!
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.. Let's go through this SLOWLY, so you can understand. The Trump Administration changed the policy in April, resulting in children being separated from their parents. They were getting a lot of intense pressure from BOTH sides, and ended the policy. Very simple.

@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS If you read clearly, you see that it asks for a modification - in the Executive Order, which is in reaction to the outcry from the POLICY CHANGE signed in April by Jeff Sessions. Reading is fundamental.

@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS Well, then I can't help you. I'm sorry, what was your original point? I usually don't waste this much time with BOTS but I don't mind
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS  https://t.co/FZYpBh76BN
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS I linked the article in the post.
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS Yes, I am very familiar with that - and the Executive Order will most likely face a legal challenge since the minors will most likely be detained longer than the 20 days set forward by the Flores settlement.
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS I'm very well educated on the topic, Ryan. I don't think you are understanding the difference between detention and separation of families. The separation of families is the new policy that Jeff Sessions began in April. It's not a secret.
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS https://t.co/IUEgxzTxh0
@il2az34 @connerwilliamsx @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS This issue is about family separation, not prosecution. I don't think you read that article. It's all pretty straightforward. The Trump Administration isn't denying this policy change was meant as a deterrent. It's very clear. You can easily educate yourself on this!
@il2az34 @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS You seem to be confused, Ryan. You do know that AG Jeff Session's signed this policy in April, correct? We are talking about family SEPARATION, not DETENTION. Big difference. Here's a link that may help you understand. https://t.co/IUEgxzTxh0
@il2az34 @FOX10Phoenix @POTUS No, that is not true. Family detention, yes but not separation. This is a new policy in place in April. Jeff Sessions announced the change, hoping it would act as a deterrent.

@narramoreryan And driving after taking 5 shots wouldn't be a good idea either.
@narramoreryan I'm not going to speculate on that. All I know is that he is accused of driving the wrong way on a freeway, and crashing head-on into innocent drivers. First responders say they smelled alcohol on his breath. How he got that much alcohol in his system, I don't know.
@narramoreryan Yeah but it won‚Äôt effect his punishment, he‚Äôs over .20 and there is no ‚Äúsuper-duper extreme.‚Äù YET.
@narramoreryan They did the blood draw in the hospital shortly after he arrived after the crash, so it's probably accurate.
@narramoreryan He was injured and taken to the hospital, and they had to send the blood to the lab. The results just recently came back.

@chrisgeidner @RyanSchulteis BREAKING: @POTUS has pardoned former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
@Standupcoyote They're not sugar coating this at all.
@Lisa30092 @JaredoTexas @Sharpie I don't know the Mayor, but I'm sure he wanted to make sure everyone got out when he gave that warning.
@fallingleaves @Getajob16 @breadandbudgets Let's hope they got the help they need to get out. I can't imagine having to stay behind. It's going to be even worse w/ storm surge
@JaredoTexas @LordotDragons No fake news here. Sorry to disappoint you.
@JaredoTexas @candylotus Here's a link to the article. https://t.co/bXlPcKn55O
@JaredoTexas @Lisa30092 @Sharpie Was that unclear?
@jhadleyconrad Yeah I can't imagine sticking around with a Cat 4 bearing down.
@SumayaClark I think that's a big part of why they send out the warning. Let people know how serious it could be, maybe scare them enough to leave.
@cranekicker He said to write it using a "Sharpie" pen or one with indelible ink.
@Umbrella_Too No, that is what Rockport Mayor Pro Tem Patrick Rios said at a news conference Friday morning.
