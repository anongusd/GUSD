.@ewarren please keep focusing on the need to #makecorruptionillegal 	 The progressive agenda can't happen while corruption is legal. This message is easy to explain and connect to, and it will harmonize with the inevitable growth in evidence of Trump's illegal corruption
The @GOP understood the "code" Cohen talked about b/c it's exactly the type of code that allows for legal corruption. It is the same language as the unspoken quid pro quos wherein lawmakers do the bidding of the wealthy in exchange for dark political money.	#makecorruptionillegal

@SenWarren If you’ve seen Senator Warren at any of her town halls, then you might know why I think she is the right person to explain this message to anyone who is reachable. She’s been described as a wonk, which is ridiculous. Deftness w/ policy doesn’t make one a wonk. Was FDR a wonk? 6/
@SenWarren Aside from being the best issue to push for a prog. wave, until we #makecorruptionillegal, every progressive policy will be infinitely harder to accomplish. It's easier to explain than climate change, and the message (YOU ARE BEING IGNORED) is easy to connect to emotionally 5/
@SenWarren DNC leaders pretend Trump is the problem, but he is the result--a public lashing out at a system wherein moneyed interests triumph over public opinion and the public good. Even the damage of his presidency is as much the fault of his spineless cabal of sycophants in congress. 4/
@SenWarren Trump’s GOP may have 40% of the country locked down, but that will not be enough. Many republican candidates will try to distance themselves from Trump. This will be impossible if we push the issue of corruption. 3/
@SenWarren I believe this is the single best issue to push if we want a progressive wave and a chance at accomplishing a progressive agenda. It’s a message that can reach and motivate everyone who is reachable. 2/
I support @SenWarren because it’s time for progressives to leverage the truth and win the argument 		Big legislation is won in election, and Sen Warren is right to focus on making corruption illegal.

@Monstercoyliar @RoseAJacob @PhilippeReines @_waleedshahid Nonsense.		Harris, Gillibrand, and Klobuchar lack the history of pushing progressive ideas and supporting progressive legislation. None of them consistently talk about wealth inequality or corruption.		There's a reason the CEO of a major bank said anyone but Warren or Sanders

@nytopinion @tomfriedman The 1% have taken the whole pie and left nothing but crumbs.		Going based on the tax cut vote, all but 12 GOP reps and every single Republican senator is a "hoard-the-pie, pull-up-the-drawbridge" Republican

@JAllen_BR @Tepper_Dylan @NateSilver538 But by less than you might thinks. Favorables are quite predictive, and Trumps are historically bad for a candidate, as they were in 2016. We just need a candidate who, unlike Clinton in 2016, doesn't also have historically bad favorability
@NateSilver538 Wouldn't more moderates entering the race make the overall likelihood of a moderate emerging go down?		That was the logic in your original analysis of the field (more candidates in a lane --&gt; tougher to win) in 2020 and in your analyses of 2016 GOP candidates

@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson Your inability to comprehend basic concepts, like the fact that I'm not in congress and thus can't pass federal law, makes me concerned for you.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson But you think if it passes it will be ruled unconstitutional? Because of the multitude of case law that totally exists?
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson How does that have anything to do with what were talking about? It doesn't require a genius to have a basic understanding of civics.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson Article 2 does not preclude a requirement for tax returns. An amendment is only needed if it violates the constitution or supreme court precedent.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson If I'm correct then congress (I'm not in congress, so I can't) can pass a law requiring it. And whadda ya know I linked you a story from a month ago about two members of congress who are trying to do just that.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson I've looked and so have you and you couldn't find it because it doesn't exist.		To have relevant case law relating to BO's birth certificate would require that there be a federal law passed requiring it. No such law exists so it's irrelevant
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson There's a SCOTUS ruling saying that you, @ToolboxWhit , are wrong about this specific argument. But don't ask me to name a case or provide any evidence.		You've already proven that you didn't even understand the basic concept of the discussion when you 1st made this claim.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson It wouldn't be "getting someone's private info legally." It would make the release of that information a requirement for candidates.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson Finally we get to the root of your failure to understand what we're talking about. 		You're talking about filing under the FOIA. 		We're talking about passing a federal law specifically requiring candidates to release their returns.		Not even close to the same thing.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson @ewarren Those are situations that require an amendment rather than a federal law. If this case law you claim exists in a SCOTUS ruling, you'd be right. 		It's becoming clearer by the second that it doesn't exist. I'm guessing you mis-remembered and rather than admit it, you go to insults
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson It's weird how you could supposedly prove us wrong so easily by showing us this case law that exists and yet you don't.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson I've read article two.		Give me the case law that actually relates to what we're talking about: the idea that congress isn't allowed to pass the type of law we're talking about.
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson Then could you provide a link or name a single one of the "many" cases you are talking about?
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson @ewarren Feel free to provide a link. The research I had done led to, among other things not matching what you are implying, an article about two Reps introducing legislation to make it a requirement		https://t.co/OteVxiUNoh
@ToolboxWhit @thor_benson @ewarren The constitution doesn't preclude a requirement for the release of one's tax returns. Just because the constitution lays out the requirements for President doesn't mean that congress can't pass election laws. Only requires an amendment if it violates constitution or SCOTUS ruling

@c_johns1042 @NoFascistLies @AOC @BernieSanders You and I understand that, but nuance is not a part of our political dialog.		It's hard enough explaining that policies like M4A, GND, and free public tuition are consistent with democratic principles and not an attempt to turn the US into an authoritarian socialist regime
@c_johns1042 @NoFascistLies @AOC @BernieSanders Messaging-wise, that's the absolutely last thing they should be doing.

@fToRrEeEsSt1 @NoFascistLies @gendjinn @jjz1600 The Dem party has moved substantially to the right for decades, agreed. But the republicans have as well.		We weren't discussing his credentials as a progressive, we were discussing his credentials as a democrat.
@gendjinn @jjz1600 @NoFascistLies If I said that I would have been 3 years old in 1992, and then you go around telling people that I said I was 3 years old, that would be taking it out of context and that's exactly what you did.
@gendjinn @jjz1600 @NoFascistLies You take a quote out of context to challenge my credibility?		He said that based on his views he would have been a moderate republican... in the 1980's. He was pointing out the shift to the right over the past 30 years
@gendjinn @jjz1600 @NoFascistLies He wasn't a Rep pretending to be a Dem. While it's true that on many policy fronts the Dems are closer to the GOP than they are to Sanders, there's still a difference. 		He was a disappointment in many ways, but do you honestly think McCain would have been no worse?
@gendjinn @jjz1600 @NoFascistLies I just haven't seen evidence for that. 		I've been following her since her Daily Show appearance in '09.
@gendjinn @jjz1600 @NoFascistLies You're talking about the non-M4A health plan she introduced?	“We need #MedicareForAll – and until we get it, there's no reason private insurers can't provide coverage that lives up to the high standards of our public health care programs,” Warren tweeted in announcing the bill.
@gendjinn @jjz1600 @NoFascistLies Sitting out isn't such a betrayal when everyone else in the party was endorsing Hilary.

@Snipper_13 @moron_unstable @Nobody_special1 @NoFascistLies @grumpybirdieS @SenSanders It does tell us a lot. It tells us he cares more about his policy objectives than his own personal grievances.
@FatesAndFuries @jjz1600 I voted Sanders then Clinton. Urged Sanders supporters to do the same. Would've been a lot easier if she didn't cheat in the primaries. Being upset about that isn't "throwing a tantrum," it's a rational response to being disenfranchised by your own party.
@hanjangho76 @FatesAndFuries @jjz1600 Democracy is about who wins, that's kind of the point. Sanders running as an independent would give Trump 4 more years, which is why he won't do it.
@jjz1600 @NoFascistLies Warren or Sanders would be acceptable. Whoever's behind after SC should drop out and endorse the other.
@shannonhall_art @biscuitfan7 @IlhanMN #unadulteratedignorance		He did nothing about it because he used the two years in which the dems had congress to pass the ACA.

@mfmf100 @IlhanMN Yes, in terms of GDP growth, they have recovered more slowly from the great recession.
@mfmf100 @IlhanMN GDP growth? Because again, if our "growth" is only benefiting a handful of people, then I'm not interested. 		Real wages are where they were 50 years ago for the US. So where'd the growth go?		https://t.co/XxMG4EiiEz

@mfmf100 @IlhanMN And if by "killing the wealth" you mean through overtaxing, then just look at the % of GDP the US collects as tax compared to other developed nations. We are well at the bottom, and the nations above us haven't "killed the source of wealth." They have a higher quality of life
@mfmf100 @IlhanMN I understand that's many people's dogma, but it just doesn't reflect reality in the U.S. today.		The danger is not that the gov't might capture the wealth, it's that the wealth has already captured the government.

@mfmf100 @IlhanMN But before regulations, the industrial working class had conditions worse than a medieval peasant (not an exaggeration).		Regulation (won by labor unions) ended child labor, gave us the 40hr workweek, created safety standards, etc.		Well regulated market economies are good.
@sekastler @thehill Me pointing out the irony of your comment STARTED the argument. You then made it about whether you were a Trump supporter. After several attempts, I managed to get across that your feed makes it obvious you are.		Then you try to shift the argument by saying I have Trump deran...
@sekastler @thehill Takes 30 seconds.		I do admire the relentlessness with which Trump supporters will shift the argument instead of admitting they're wrong.
@sekastler @thehill How do you still not get it?		It wasn't because you attacked Warren. It's because you retweet Individual-1 and tweet things like "Trump can speak for an hour and a half and it doesn't seem that long. Obama would speak for 10 minutes and it felt like an hour and a half."
@sekastler @thehill A study in missing the point. Why would I point out that your feed is public?		Because I looked at it!		And you are clearly pro-Trump. I didn't assume anything; I used the power of reading comprehension.
@sekastler @thehill You know your other people can see your twitter feed, right?
@sekastler @thehill It's genuinely hilarious that a Trump supporter can unironically call another politician a "delusional wind bag".		Pot/kettle, glass houses, honestly pick a metaphor

@mfmf100 @IlhanMN Not if almost all the growth goes to the hundred richest families and the growth for most everyone else fails to keep up with inflation.
@mfmf100 @IlhanMN Flat taxes are regressive and we already have historically high inequality. High inequality is bad for the economy.
@DBZDoll @IlhanMN Honestly, did you take a second?		Because you still seem to think that a muslim person saying a prayer after a terrorist attack means that they're celebrating.
@DBZDoll @IlhanMN We aren't, but you might be.		Believe it or not, you aren't the only Jewish person.
@Ahmad59507743 It was anti-semitic adjacent, but I thought her meaning was clear: there is too much money in politics (from every angle).		Of course. many resist the growing consensus around this truth.
@mfmf100 @IlhanMN I can't speak for everyone but I want	-Repeal of all fossil fuel tax breaks	-Investment in energy storage tech	-invest in smart grid	-cap and trade or carbon tax	-tax incentives for solar		That would be a decent start
@mfmf100 @IlhanMN But since you bring up socialism, the policies we want have proven themselves in other nations: free public tuition in Germany  and public health insurance in France, Germany, Canada, etc.
@mfmf100 @IlhanMN A little early in the discussion to pivot, no?		We were talking about climate change. Many successful countries have implemented changes to reduce emissions.		The European Union has more people and a bigger economy, yet the manage to have 30% less CO2 emissions
@DBZDoll @IlhanMN It is a prayer. 		Think about it for a second before you respond again. Honestly take a breath and think. Because it is obviously a prayer, and you might want to think about why you thought she was celebrating the deaths of innocent people.

@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt At least you're admitting what this is about instead of pretending that you are even slightly knowledgeable about climate science.
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt I'm fine with that. But the negative externality of fossil fuels, the decreased livability of earth, should be incorporated into the price.
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt Do some research then. NOAA data is available through their website. 		I repeat: YOUR FAILURE TO READ THE DATA DOESN'T MAKE IT NOT EXIST
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt "Scientists use four major datasets to study global temperature."		"NASA GISTEMP has the most comprehensive coverage, with measurements over 99 per cent of the globe."	2/2
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt If you had actually read the article instead of just pretending to, you would know that all four of those agencies have data sets consisting of measurements from all over the world. 	1/2
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt NASA, NOAA, Met Office, Japan Meteorologic Office		Your failure to read the data doesn't make it not exist
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt They've failed to demonstrate correlation because the data is too complicated and easily manipulated?		It's 4 diff. agencies showing the same trend		The upward trend correlates with the trend in CO2		The correlation fits with what we know &amp; would expect based on greenhouse effect
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt https://t.co/AgSjXjSgWR
@wootendw @Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt Each data point is an average of many locations... no single reading in any location would be part of the data set. 		That would be a measurement of weather rather than climate.
@cusmp8 @jerdobrosky @NateSilver538 It's part of the emergency declarations law.
@NateSilver538 A lot of major GOP players expressed opposition, concerns, or uncertainty about then candidate Trump.		I wouldn't expect them to grow a spine any time soon.
@Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt @wootendw By that logic, there's only one reality so science is useless. 		Like many people who realize their position is indefensible, you've tried to subtly shift your argument. First it was "we only have 140 data points" and now it's "we only have one". Both are incorrect.
@Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt @wootendw And if you need a graph showing that this is an anomaly on a longer time scale, just look at CO2 concentration		CO2 causes warming, but that's not all. It also causes increased ocean acidification, which is terrible for lots of species on the bottom of the ocean food chain https://t.co/KoXDyh4X1R
@Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt @wootendw The cooling of the last 3 years is only reassuring if you don't care at all about 10, 20, or 30 years. 		Yes the earth has undergone major climate shifts, but over millions of years. All the other times it has shifted rapidly were because of a mass extinction event (asteroid eg)
@Anxie_TEA @MishGEA @Sorgfelt @wootendw How many data points do you need? The data set for that graph is not one data point for each year-- there are thousands of data points. And yes, it's cyclic and we've been cooling the past 3 years. But a sinusoidal wave pointing up is still pointing up. 1/2
@euanrellie Moderation is only possible when the two sides have different perspectives on the SAME FACTS.		There is no such thing as a moderate when the two sides live in different informational universes.
@MishGEA @Sorgfelt @Anxie_TEA @wootendw "Centuries are like a gnat's ass on an elephant in a timeframe going billions of years."		Which is exactly why a dramatic change over such a short time, like what we've seen with CO2 levels, is so alarming.

@realDonaldTrump @tommcclintock Except that in most of those cases there was, you know, an emergency.
Pointing out the hypocrisy of #BuildTheWall people saying "listen to the experts" by pointing to their climate change stance really isn't fair. 		After all, experts on border security aren't universally in favor of the wall.
@DonnaBozek @BroBrandonH If you focus on a single issue, maybe you could make a coherent point?		You're vague, all over the map, and completely unsupported by evidence. I would respond but I honestly can't figure out what you're trying to say for the most part.	Where I can my response is, "evidence?"
@BroBrandonH Setting a minimum is not the same as telling companies what to pay their workers. You can argue that's wrong, but describing it as "telling businesses what they have to pay their employees" is a straw man that makes it seem like you don't think your actual argument is a winner
@BroBrandonH Nonsense. The jobs trend started before he took office. 		Long term economic trends don't go by presidencies, they're long term. Sometimes the effects of a presidency aren't seen for decades. Just look at the deregulation under Clinton that lead to the housing crisis.
@BroBrandonH When did anyone suggest telling businesses what they have to pay their employees?	Who suggested forcing companies to build charging stations or forcing them to use certain vehicles?	You asked me if I read the GND, but it seems like you are the one who did not.
@BroBrandonH "interfering" and "affecting"		Notice that your verb choices reveal the truth. You realize that this isn't about taking over everything. That was an untruth, and you know it.		All regulations "affect" or "interfere". And I will again point to the many countries with paid vacation
@BroBrandonH It's achieved the same way our government achieves anything: investment and tax incentivizations. 		Affecting an industry is not the same as taking it over. Passing regulations is not the same as nationalizing an industry.
@BroBrandonH I get that you want to shift the argument because your wrong, but let's come back to the point. 		Name one other industry that AOC wants to nationalize.		Support the claim that she wants the government to run everything.
@BroBrandonH And that's M4A, that's not even the GND.
@BroBrandonH I did read it. It doesn't involve taking over a single industry. 		The only industry AOC and Sanders want to nationalize is health insurance (as has been done in the nations I listed and many others).		Name a single other industry that either of them has proposed nationalizing.
@BroBrandonH But that isn't what AOC is proposing. She's proposing policies similar to those in the UK, France, Germany, etc. The point of the meme is that Venezuela is not an apt comparison when other developed countries have successfully implemented similar policies.

@dommybreth @thehill @TheHillOpinion Yeah, you're right.		The fact that a random person on twitter doesn't have a fully fleshed out plan definitely means that Trump should declare a national emergency that doesn't exist to usurp congress and build a wall that the American people don't want.
@dommybreth @thehill @TheHillOpinion LOL, there goes the slightest possibility that you were arguing in good faith. Obviously once people are detected, you'd send the border patrol there.
@dommybreth @thehill @TheHillOpinion That doesn't sound genuine, but I'm no coward. Keep in mind that the problems you listed are varied in their causes so would need a family of solutions.

@dommybreth @thehill @TheHillOpinion "open the floodgates" &lt;--- classic strawman, no one is suggesting this.		There is a humanitarian crisis, again most everyone agrees.

Looks like @HowardSchultz was right about being able to unite the country. Seems like everyone thinks his campaign is a terrible idea.
@Lacimeh @jakedgoode @ewarren "Welfare" is not the same as "welfare program." Medicaid is a welfare program. So is social security and medicare, but they are not welfare. But even with your definition, those programs don't add up to 1.1tn, they add up to $725bn. About half of that is medicaid.
@jannykmak @thehill 61% of registered voters.
@Glennon1961 @thehill It isn't a punishment any more than payroll taxes are punishment for the poor.		This tendency to paint the ultra-rich as victims is honestly insane.
@Kaiser_Pol @JohnAnsell9 @thehill Your twitter handle is appropriate for how out of touch you are. Many people are poor for other reasons: mental illness, physical disability, spending most of their income supporting family. Even if someone is poor b/c they're stupid, does that mean they don't deserve healthcare?
@mc1436v2 @agent1220 @thehill This is a slippery slope argument. No one is suggesting we abolish the free market.
@Lacimeh @jakedgoode @ewarren If we go along with rebranding everything from Medicaid to Pell grants as "welfare," then sure.  The program that has typically been referred to as "welfare", the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program (formerly AFDC), costs $17.3bn, less than 1/2 a % of the budget

@Teclaur @pianopsycho2 @ewarren 1/2 don't pay income tax. They still pay payroll taxes. 		We collect a tiny % of our GDP for a developed economy. That is why we have deficits.

@speaken_curt @lsimonis @ewarren It isn't "punishing them" any more than payroll taxes are a "punishment" for the poor. It's actually really simple: people who benefit the most from the system have the greatest obligation to support it. No one benefits from government services more than the rich.
@pianopsycho2 @ewarren How about that people who gain more from the system have a greater obligation to support it? 		No one benefits from government services more than the wealthy. 		Who do you think provides corporations with literate workers, roads for their cargo, and reliable electricity?

If you're wondering how this will help you in the primaries, consider that democratic primary voters' main concern will be beating Trump, and they'll choose a corporate democrat over you (her, really, since I'm assuming a staffer, if anyone, will read this) if they think it's the
