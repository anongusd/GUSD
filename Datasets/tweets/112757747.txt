@AP We‚Äôre facing the biggest national threat to our nation since 9/11 with Middle East troop withdrawals, losing critical military leaders, conspiracy with Russia yet the @POTUS and @GOP are focused on a wall, immigrants running from horrific violence, poverty.

@politico No political party or @POTUS has ever been - and never will be - more important than our nation, our democracy or our Constitution. Nor will Americans allow those who serve the citizens divide us to the point of ignoring our national security.

@RepJeffDuncan Funny how you ignore Trump‚Äôs promise to Americans to have this wall paid for by Mexico. Or how you leave 800,000 American families financially devastated at Christmas. Or that our biggest national security threat is the Middle East, Russia - not immigrants.
@RepJeffDuncan Jeff, when did you decide that you could ignore your oath of office to protect the Constitution, to provide Executive branch oversight, to serve citizens?

@VoiceoftheGrunt @RandPaul Because they smile, are submissive, don't have an opinion that differs from yours? A real woman has a mind, speaks up against what she sees as injustice. A real man admires that and isn't intimidated. Time to grow up Bubba!

@VeniceRiley @RandPaul Yeah, because silly women couldn't coordinate a protest all my their little old selves. We're incapable of a task like that without help, guidance. üòÇü§£üòÇ
@RobbieSue11 @RandPaul Are you implying that women who protest a nominee for the Supreme Court lack beauty and grace? Seriously?

@millett_rebecca @SusanKeckler @senatemajldr You are the epitome of what's wrong with this country, not a past president. Your hatred towards your fellow Americans based on politics. That is not patriotism and does not make our nation great.
@B_malkia @BRUCEHAWES @senatemajldr You don't understand it. 1 in 6 American girls/women are sexually abused and you're focusing on a political party vs. the epidemic of abuse we face. Politics should never come before the right of victims to be heard, their allegations investigated.
@senatemajldr The majority of Americans - which you serve - do not want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court. So who are you working for Mitch?

@senatemajldr "Your duty?" You, @SenateGOP haven't given a damn about doing your duty since @realDonaldTrump took office.
@senatemajldr Apparently, you're not the slightest bit interested in the truth, or in taking seriously that 1 in 6 American women have been sexually assaulted! The old, white privileged men of the @GOP damn well don't deserve my vote! #VoteOutGOP
@realDonaldTrump is certainly not the smart, savvy, self-made man he portrayed himself to be. But any surprise he was caught in yet another lie?
The message to American women being flaunted by ‚Å¶@senatemajldr‚Å©, ‚Å¶@SenateGOP‚Å©, @realDonaldTrump‚Å© is that we're not as credible as men, as worthy as men, and that the sexual assaults faced by 1 in 6 women are too trivial to bother with! https://t.co/W6XWYnVVxh
When 1 in 5 female students are sexually assaulted while attending U.S. colleges/universities, it is reprehensible that @BklynCollege411 does not immediately fire Mitchell Langbert. It's disgraceful to force female students to sit in his classroom.

@SteveScalise Our great-grandchildren are already stuck paying for the $1.3 trillion in tax cuts you doled out to the wealthy earlier this year. You keep forcing struggling American families further into the biggest debt in history to reward the rich, big business!

Kavanaugh's attacks on the credibility of Dr. Ford; his attacks on the Democratic party, Clintons; his belligerence and arrogance towards senators questioning him are all red flags!
Why does the @POTUS, @SenateGOP focus on the Kavanaugh allegations solely as a "Democract conspiracy" vs. American women stepping forward as victims alleging sexual assault. This dismisses the very claims of these women!
I do not even remotely believe Kavanaugh. And in no way do I want decisions about my life, that of my family, made by this man sitting on the Supreme Court. He's evasive, unwilling to answer direct questions, refuses to ask for an @FBI investigation.
@HuffPost The most repulsive comments ever made, and a direct attack on the rights of American girls and women to say "no."
