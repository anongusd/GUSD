@GovMikeHuckabee @realDonaldTrump To be clear: Mueller is not disputing that Cohen says Trump told him to lie.

@SteveDaines @realDonaldTrump There is a push by some to say that "both sides" are to blame for the shutdown. I would agree. Both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House and the GOP leaders of the Senate. It's pretty clear that's how the majority of Americans see it.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Congress voted to provide back pay for 800,000 federal workers working without paychecks due to the government shutdown. Seven House Republicans voted "No." Justin Amash (MI) Andy Biggs (AZ) Paul Gosar (AZ) Glen Grothman (WI) Thomas Massie (KY) Chip Roy (TX) Ted Yoho (FL)
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS I want someone to explain to me exactly what it is that Oleg Deripaska has done to earn today’s lifting of the sanctions by the Republican-majority Senate.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS So let's recap, the president of the United States says that ISIS is defeated. Then ISIS kills four members of the American Military to prove they are still active. Question: How complicit is @realDonaldTrump in the murder of these brave American soliders?
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS BREAKING: After Trump’s first meeting with Putin he called a @nytimes reporter to argue that “the Russians were falsely accused of election interference.” FACT CHECK: Mueller’s already indicted 26 Russians for attacking our election. Trump defends Russia because he is a TRAITOR.

@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS GOP controlled the House and Senate for two years under Trump. If the wall was such an emergency, they could have used reconciliation to pass it with 50 votes in Senate. Why didn’t they? I guess throwing millions off health care &amp; cutting corporate taxes were higher priorities.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Is Russian TV fake news according to you? https://t.co/BqMeTujigp
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Senate Republicans have refused to vote to reopen the U.S. government, but have no problem voting to lift sanctions on a Russian oligarch. That should tell you a lot about their priorities.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS .@SpeakerPelosi: Thank you for planning a visit to Afghanistan as one of your first trips, as Speaker, this Congress. It is shameful that @realDonaldTrump has decided to not allow you to go and thank our troops. Nonetheless, your intent to go is GREATLY appreciated. Thank you.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Bottom line: Trump had two years of total Republican control of Congress and couldn’t get his wall built. He waits until he gets his clock cleaned in the midterms, loses control of Congress, to draw his line in the sand. It just doesn’t get more stupid than that.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Mueller has receipts... "The special counsel’s office learned about Trump’s directive for Cohen to lie to Congress through interviews with multiple witnesses from the Trump Org and internal company emails, text messages, and a cache of other documents."
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Reporter on MSNBC confirms that prosecutors has documentation to back up Cohen’s testimony.
@SenateGOP @SenRonJohnson @realDonaldTrump @POTUS "if Trump directed Cohen to lie to Congress, that’s not grey. That’s as black and white as it can be.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump The problem for Giuliani is that the BuzzFeed report doesn't hinge on Cohen. It says that the special counsel got the evidence that Trump had told Cohen to lie through "multiple witnesses from the Trump Org and internal company emails, text messages, and other documents.
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Quite fascinating the @GOP flipped their shit over 30,000 deleted emails, but sit ungrudgingly calm when their man virtually destroys all records of his conversations with Putin the bad guy.

@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS We have secured enough Republican votes in the Senate to reopen government. Our obstacle now is Mitch McConnell, who won’t call the vote for what seems like 2 reasons: 1. He won’t operate independently of Trump 2. He’s putting his own re-election ahead of 800,000 working people
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS Today the GOP-led Senate voted 57-43 to move forward with Chuck Schumer’s resolution to reverse Trump’s lifting of sanctions on Russian companies Mitch McConnell didn't want this to goto a vote. Schumer forced it. A crystal clear example of McConnell's attack on Democracy!
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS 800K American workers are living without a paycheck and Trump and the @GOP are lifting sanctions on a Russian Oligarch. The treason continues in BROAD DAYLIGHT.		So, you want to pay Russian Oligarchs before American workers. I think that’s all we need to know about you.
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS And FU.. stop it with the partisan politics.	MERRICK GARLAND!!!!!!!
@SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @POTUS “Assuming all the evidence adds up to the conclusion that the president asked Cohen to lie about the Russia deal, it's evidence of conspiracy, of obstruction of justice, of suborning perjury … It's impeachment material,”

@RepJasonSmith When it comes to passing tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, McConnell bends the rules, cancels hearings, and delivers the votes. But when it comes to hundreds of thousands of workers, he delays, equivocates, and blocks the vote. The contrast couldn’t be clearer.

@RepGosar @SpeakerPelosi @RepAndyBiggsAZ Bottom line:		Trump had two years of total Republican control of Congress and couldn’t get his wall built. 		He waits until he gets his clock cleaned in the midterms, loses control of Congress, to draw his line in the sand. 		It just doesn’t get more stupid than that.

@senjudiciary The suffering of our fellow Americans in #PuertoRico has been ignored far too long by the Trump Administration – and now the President will try to block important support for rebuilding efforts, including nutrition assistance for families. This cruelty cannot stand.
@senjudiciary https://t.co/Kf6m6L5v7p
@senjudiciary @SecNielsen lied to the American people when she said there was no family separation policy. (This is not news, but I want to keep highlighting Nielsen is a liar).		NEWS: The family separation policy resulted in even more children ripped away from their parents.
@GovMikeHuckabee Has anyone considered letting Putin give the State of the Union from Moscow
@GovMikeHuckabee I mean seriously, how fucking stupid do you have to be to still be a trump supporter?
@GovMikeHuckabee For Trump, everything is about his ego and (lack of) manhood. 		Every time Pelosi tells him “no”, it’s like a punch to his tiny balls and he acts more and more like a spoiled little brat. 		She’s slowly but brutally breaking him down, and I’m so here for it.
@GovMikeHuckabee Nancy Pelosi couldn’t have a government plane to go and visit our troops in a war zone but...		Our  1st lady used one to go to Florida today?	Doesn't look good for the GOP
@GovMikeHuckabee Just In:  Trump is guilty of Conspiracy against the United States
@GOPChairwoman LOL. Realizing Trump just emptied both barrels into his own foot again, the White House cancels Steve Mnuchin’s boondoggle to Davos.
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump I’ve never been so disgusted with Republicans, especially those in the Senate. I promise you, every single one of these traitors will be investigated and exposed for the frauds they are. Lifting Russian sanctions? Keeping government closed? It’s a sick, sadistic and twisted GOP.

@GOPChairwoman 26 days of pain and uncertainty. 26 days of missed paychecks and missed bills. 26 days of #TrumpShutdown—the longest in our country’s history. But Republicans want to vote to undermine women's access to health care instead of voting to reopen the government.
@GOPChairwoman Senate Republicans have refused to vote to reopen the U.S. government, but have no problem voting to lift sanctions on a Russian oligarch. That should tell you a lot about their priorities.
@GOPChairwoman #Russia's state TV—which was previously more than happy to exclaim "Trump is ours"— now nervously attempts to refute the idea he is an agent of the Kremlin. Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov complains about the lack of leaks in the Mueller investigation. They smell trouble.
@GOPChairwoman So let's recap, the president of the United States says that ISIS is defeated. Then ISIS kills four members of the American Military to prove they are still active. Question: How complicit is @realDonaldTrump in the murder of these brave American soliders?

@RepMarkMeadows The President should make no statement or take any action to obstruct Congress’ independent oversight and investigative efforts, including by seeking to discourage any witness from testifying in response to a duly authorized request from Congress.”
@RepMarkMeadows BREAKING: Trump’s disapproval rating hits an ALL TIME HIGH at 57% during the shutdown.		Mark Meadows supports Trump like a lap dog. What is HIS approval rating this week?
@RepMarkMeadows , Trump discussed “adoptions” (sanctions policy) with Putin the night before dictating his son’s “adoptions” statement. There was no interpreter but he mentioned it in passing to the Times.
@RepMarkMeadows Are YOU intentionally or unintentionally acting in the best interest of Russia over the United States by supporting Trump?
@RepMarkMeadows Looking forward to 2.7.19.	Are you?
@RepMarkMeadows It's Mueller Time.	Are you still going to stand with the President once the final report comes out?
@RepMarkMeadows They had ample evidence to investigate 	a) Carter Page blabbing about Russia while tipsy	b) Trump telling the Russian fat guy in the White House- I am glad I fired Comey		Your followers may be uninformed- but I am NOT

@RepByrne If it’s a national emergency... - Why not build the wall in ‘17 / ‘18? - Why is the current border security budget unspent? - Why did Trump reject $25 billion in wall funding in Jan ‘18? ****** If this goes to court, Trump has no argument and he will get destroyed, as usual.

@RepByrne It takes 2 milligrams of fentanyl to kill an average person. 110 pounds of fentanyl seized in the Port of Philadelphia from a single shipment could kill 24,947,560 Americans. Building a racist wall instead of making security tighter at our ports of entry is simply ludicrous.

@MarshaBlackburn a 2009 study by University of California-Davis economist Giovanni Peri found that a 1% increase in a state's employment due to immigration produced on average 0.5% higher wages for each worker in that state.
@MarshaBlackburn economists have determined that immigrants -- undocumented or not -- tend to help American workers by serving in low-skilled jobs that create more opportunities for the native born to move into managerial and knowledge-based roles.
@MarshaBlackburn Apprehensions at the border are still well below historic highs. In the early 2000s, for example, annual apprehensions routinely topped 1 million. After hitting an historic low in 2017 of around 300,000, apprehensions increased in fiscal year 2018 to nearly 400,000.
@MarshaBlackburn the majority of heroin that comes across the southern border is smuggled in privately-owned vehicles and tractor-trailers at legal ports of entry, where the drug is co-mingled with legal goods, according to the DEA's 2018 annual drug threat assessment.

@RepMarkMeadows Did you know?, the majority of the heroin flow on the southern border into the US is through privately owned vehicles at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers,
@MarshaBlackburn The majority of the heroin flow on the southern border into the US is through privately owned vehicles at legal ports of entry, followed by tractor-trailers,
@MarshaBlackburn The only drug that is smuggled in higher numbers between legal entry points is marijuana. Doesnt @RepMattGaetz want to legalize pot?
@MarshaBlackburn The majority of hard narcotics seized by Customs and Border Protection come through ports of entry either in packages, cargo or with people who attempt to enter the US legally
@MarshaBlackburn Bergen noted that the most notorious case of a terrorist apprehended at the US border is the "millennium plot," when an Algerian citizen with ties to al-Qaeda was arrested at the US-Canada border in December 1999. He hoped to blow up Los Angeles International Airport.
@MarshaBlackburn "I cannot think of a single example of a terrorism case where somebody came over the southern border to infiltrate the United States," said Peter Bergen, a CNN national security analyst who has tracked hundreds of terrorism cases. "It's sort of a non-problem."
@MarshaBlackburn a State Department report from 2016 said there was "no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico" to sneak into the United States.
@MarshaBlackburn White House press secretary Sarah Sanders was fact-checked live on Fox News when she said Sunday "nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border."
@MarshaBlackburn . An  official told CNN that only about a dozen non-citizens on the terrorism watch list who were stopped at the US-Mexico border in fiscal year 2018. That is a tiny fraction of all known or suspected terrorists who tried to enter or travel to the US in that timeframe.

@GOPChairwoman A lot of people crossing the border with criminal records committed nonviolent crimes- like illegal entry or re-entry and driving under the influence of alcohol.
@GOPChairwoman REPEAT:  THESE FIGURES ARE NOT REFERENCING THE SOUTHERN BORDER	 the majority of hard narcotics seized by Customs and Border Protection come through ports of entry either in packages, cargo or with people who attempt to enter the US legally.
@GOPChairwoman fact:	 the majority of hard narcotics seized by Customs and Border Protection come through ports of entry either in packages, cargo or with people who attempt to enter the US legally.
@GOPChairwoman FACT:	The truth is just 12 individuals who are not US citizens and are on the terror watch list were encountered on the southern border between October 2017 and October 2018. The vast majority tried to enter through airports.
@GOPChairwoman FACT:	Only 12 non-US citizens on the terror watch list were stopped at the border last year. Vice President Mike Pence misleadingly claimed that nearly 4,000 terrorists were caught trying to enter the US last year.
@GOPChairwoman FACT:  DON JR WILL BE INDICTED SOON.  VERY SOON.	My guestimate:  3.15.19
@GOPChairwoman Manafort is alleged to have met in Madrid w/Kilimnik; shared polling data with him; and discussed a Ukraine peace plan w/him more than once. Is that the same peace plan that Cohen delivered to Flynn in Jan 2017? Did trump know?

@GOPChairwoman Trump will appear on tv Tuesday to describe a fabricated Wag the Dog crisis at the border. Simpering, sycophantic Republicans are going along even though they know this is a complete ruse. Shutting down the government w/o cause ought to be grounds for impeachment by itself.
@GOPChairwoman Trump’s base isn’t holding him to a wall. They are sufficiently devoted to him that if he said “no wall” they’d accept it just because he said so. It’s conservative media that’s holding him to a wall.

@MarshaBlackburn @foxandfriends The @senatemajldr should immediately allow a vote on the bipartisan bills the House already passed to reopen the government—until that happens, @SenateDems should block consideration of all unrelated bills.

@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump It has been one week since President Trump decided to shut down the government over his demand for a $5 billion border wall. Federal employees continue to go without pay because of the President’s temper tantrum over a wasteful and ineffective wall.

@RepMattGaetz I agree with you!  Yeah!  You have a soul
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS If Trump shuts down the government, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will work without pay in the days before Christmas, including about:		53,000 TSA workers	42,000 Coast Guard employees	41,000 law enforcement and corrections officers	5,000 Forest Service firefighters
@RepMattGaetz @POTUS You are such a suck up.	Mattis - the  hero- quit because of Trump.	Trump doesn't support the troops	He doesn't visit the troops.	You hitched your wagon to a LOSER
@GOPChairwoman @realDonaldTrump You are so full of shit.  He had a border plan. Trump rejected it.	And Trump didn't use the money he has now.		Such a bull shit bill- which the Senate will vote down.  Mitch doesn't have the votes

@RepGosar https://t.co/ZVZ0J7uC87
@RepGosar Persecution is not defined in U.S. asylum law, so the government will look at what is in an asylum application on a case by case basis.  Generally, any severe loss of life or liberty will be considered persecution
@RepGosar In order to qualify for asylum, one must prove that the persecution one fears will happen after returning to his or her home country.
@RepGosar There is a number of grounds to submit your USA asylum application. Top immigration attorney talks the laws and your rights.
@RepGosar https://t.co/dqazmKlHuE
@RepGosar https://t.co/EXLgTjKtfw
@RepGosar Priority Three. The relatives (parents, spouses, or unmarried children under 21) of refugees who are already settled in the United States
@RepGosar Priority Two. Groups of “special concern” to the United States, which are selected by the Department of State with input from USCIS, UNHCR, and designated NGOs
@RepGosar Priority One. Individuals with compelling persecution needs or those for whom no other durable solution exists.
@RepGosar dividual eligibility for refugee status is determined through interviews conducted by officers in U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which is part of DHS. AND NOT BY PEOPLE YOU INTERVIEW ON THE STREETS
@RepGosar Refugees who pass their security screening, and who fall within the numerical limits of a given year’s refugee admissions ceiling, become eligible for resettlement within the United States.
@RepGosar https://t.co/FhftiGMTv9
@RepGosar Political asylum in USA. Asylum may be granted to people who are already in the United States and are unable or unwilling to return their home country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality,
@RepGosar The United States recognizes the right of asylum for individuals as specified by international and federal law.

@SenHydeSmith Blacklisting 21 Saudis is a weak response to Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder. The U.S. should expel the Saudi ambassador and call on our allies to do the same until a third party investigation is completed. No arms deal is worth our moral authority.
@KellyannePolls @POTUS tell the ORANGE THING this- Blacklisting 21 Saudis is a weak response to Jamal Khashoggi’s brutal murder.

@SenateGOP THE GOP IS BANKRUPTING OUR COUNTRY .. JUST LIKE TRUJMP'S BUSINESSES https://t.co/IicG6FBNYh
@RepMarkMeadows “8X more new manufacturing jobs now than with Obama” -Since 2010 there have been a total of 1.2M Manufacturing jobs created in America -Out of these 1.2M jobs, 800,000 were created under Obama and 400,000 created under Trump 0.5X Does not equal 8X
@RepMarkMeadows Republicans just voted down a common sense but important bill to help people with pre-existing conditions. In other news GOP candidates are running a record number of commercials saying they support pre-existing condition protections. I think they mean theoretically
@RepMarkMeadows The Federal deficit Just hit $782 billion in fiscal year 2018 and is projected to be near $1 trillion in fiscal year 2019 What happened to the GOP whining about deficits?
@RepMarkMeadows https://t.co/Ljeiz9fuLT
@RepMarkMeadows 83% of Americans wages are only up an average of .07%		Compared to the consumer price index, which up 2.9% (highest jump in 10 yrs)		Gas up 29.8%	Food up 3.6%	Healthcare up 2.4%	Rent up 3.5%	Transportation up 3.9%
@RepMarkMeadows Expelling Saudi Ambassador, as @SenatorDurbin suggested, is a good beginning—a first step that must be followed by more: No arms sales, refueling &amp; other military support. Other steps—including against top Saudi rulers—should be determined by a full international investigation.

@SenTomCotton A Turkish source told the New York Times that Tubaigy was equipped with a bone saw. He is listed as the president of the Saudi Fellowship of Forensic Pathology and a member of the Saudi Association for Forensic Pathology.
@SenTomCotton “When I do this job, I listen to music. You should do [that] too,” Tubaigy was recorded as saying, the source told MEE.
@SenTomCotton The killing took seven minutes, the source said.	As he started to dismember the body, Tubaigy put on earphones and listened to music. He advised other members of the squad to do the same.
@SenTomCotton Tubaigy began to cut Khashoggi’s body up on a table in the study while he was still alive, the Turkish source said.
@SenTomCotton Salah Muhammad al-Tubaigy, who has been identified as the head of forensic evidence in the Saudi general security department, was one of the 15-member squad who arrived in Ankara earlier that day on a private jet.
@SenTomCotton The screaming stopped when Khashoggi - who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate on 2 October - was injected with an as yet unknown substance.
@SenTomCotton "The consul himself was taken out of the room. There was no attempt to interrogate him. They had come to kill him,” the source told MEE.  (YOUR POST SOUNDS BAD NOW DOESN'T IT)
@SenTomCotton Khashoggi was dragged from the consul-general’s office at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and onto the table of his study next door, the Turkish source said.	Horrendous screams were then heard by a witness downstairs, the source said.
@SenTomCotton It took seven minutes for Jamal Khashoggi to die, a Turkish source who has listened in full to an audio recording of the Saudi journalist's last moments told Middle East Eye.

@SenTomCotton THIS WAS IGNORED AND STILL IS Middle East Eye published the similar claims on #Khashoggi. • He was dragged from the Consul General’s office at the Saudi and onto the table of his study next door,  Tubaigy began to cut his body up while he was still alive, • Then he was sedated
@SenTomCotton Reports say sedation came a while after the cutting started. State-ordered torture and execution that was a direct result of Jared Kushner giving MbS a classified list of enemies.  and trump STILL is covering this up. how timely your post
@SenTomCotton Dina Powell was with Kushner in Riyadh last October. Weird that Kirill Dmitriev was also in Riyadh when they arrived, and that Powell abruptly removed her name from consideration for UN Ambassador after news of Khashoggi’s disappearance broke.
@SenTomCotton Jamal Khashoggi interview on Egyptian TV revealing classified deal between Trump &amp; Royal king of SA to take money from Royal Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal to bail him self out after being arrested for corruption the money end up to Trump / Kushner weapon deal
@SenTomCotton Khashoggi was not only alive, but also conscious for 7 minutes as he was dismembered. I believe he was poisoned with a dose of atropine, that rendered him immobile but conscious for 7 min
@SenTomCotton It comes down to this: Jamal Khashoggi spoke out against Trump’s closeness w Putin, his anti- Muslim views and felt that his closeness w Saudi Royal Family wasn’t smart. Trump, Putin &amp; King Salman decided to shut him down... because the free press is an enemy to corrupt leaders

@senatemajldr Republicans will do everything they can to take away families’ health care and raise their costs, whether it be eliminating protections for pre-existing conditions, repealing the health care law, or cutting Medicare &amp; Medicaid. Americans should take Senator McConnell at his word.

@RepMarkMeadows Michael Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis, told USA TODAY his client had "two words" for the Trump's claims that Cohen lied to prosecutors: "audio and tape." He said the president should be worried.

@RepMarkMeadows $100M in Saudi money lands in US accounts as Pompeo landed in Riyadh	Pompeo and Trump DEFEND Saudi Investigation into GRUESOME MURDER of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.		TRUMP IS EITHER A COWARD OR A TRAITOR
@RepMarkMeadows I’m not a conspiracy theorist, but at this point it's imperative that Congress looks into what Trump knew about Saudi Arabia’s plans for Khashoggi before he was killed. This man was not a fan of Trump, and now Trump doesn’t seems to care that he’s dead at the hands of the Saudis.
@RepMarkMeadows den Retweeted Brian Chappatta	80 percent of this year's deficit is directly attributable to tax cuts.		That is a fact. It is an inconvenient fact. It is a fact that is at odds with the conventional wisdom. And it is a fact that makes many people uncomfortable.

@RepMarkMeadows President Trump (and Jared Kushner) sure look like they’re putting money — and their wallets — before principle as Saudia Arabia and MBS try to  stage manage their roles in Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance
@RepMarkMeadows All 3 of Trump's autocratic friends in Russia, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia have ordered assassinations beyond their borders on Trump's watch. And yet Trump continues embrace all three .  Think about that.
@RepMarkMeadows Spoiler on the upcoming #MuellerReport: 		The tRUmp campaign knowingly colluded with the Russians, and Donald was very much aware of it. His family, and some business associates were also involved. 		... Mueller knows all. :-)
@RepMarkMeadows rump: I demand to know what happened to Jamal Khashoggi.		MBS: We dismembered him while he was alive but here's $100m.		rump: Nice doing business with you.
@RepMarkMeadows I don’t pretend to be a Constitutional scholar, but it seems to me that when a President aids and abets a murder that just might come under the heading of “High crimes and misdemeanors”. Just saying.

@RepScottPerry The United States has a strong commitment to human rights at home and around the world. Americans believe that basic human rights should be something everyone has.

@mattgaetz Shafeeq Ghabra, a professor of political science at Kuwait University, explains the problem in this way: “The Arab regimes’ war on the Brotherhood does not target the movement alone, but rather targets those who practice politics
@mattgaetz A significant number of citizens in any given Arab country will give their vote to Islamic political parties if some form of democracy is allowed. It seems clear then that the only way to prevent political Islam from playing a role in Arab politics is to abolish democracy,
@mattgaetz Terrorism and the refugee crisis have changed the political mood in the West and brought the extreme right to prominence there.
@mattgaetz In turn, this will mean the continuation of the causes behind revolution, extremism and refugees — all of which have affected the security of Europe and the rest of the world.
@mattgaetz The eradication of the Muslim Brotherhood is nothing less than an abolition of democracy and a guarantee that Arabs will continue living under authoritarian and corrupt regimes.
@mattgaetz The United States’s aversion to the Muslim Brotherhood, which is more apparent in the current Trump administration, is the root of a predicament across the entire Arab world.
@mattgaetz a great opportunity to reform the entire Arab world and allow a historic change that might have freed the region from a thousand years of tyranny.
@mattgaetz That is the conclusion that David D. Kirkpatrick arrives at in his excellent book “Into the Hands of the Soldiers,” which was released this month. A former Cairo bureau chief for the New York Times, Kirkpatrick gives a sad account of Egypt’s 2013 coup that led to the loss of
@mattgaetz position and reject the coup against President-elect Mohamed Morsi. The coup, as we know, led to the military’s return to power in the largest Arab country — along with tyranny, repression, corruption and mismanagement.
