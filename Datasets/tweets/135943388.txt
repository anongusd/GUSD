@robertGehrke @benwinslow @sltrib @briangrimmett Haynie Audit from 2013 shows GOED incentives generate $3.19 of benefit for $1 of tax credit
@robertGehrke @benwinslow @sltrib @briangrimmett GOED’s Val Hale: Utah model is working and it’s working incredibly well.
@robertGehrke @benwinslow @sltrib  GOED believes 125% of ave. county wage plus health benefits meets “compares favorably” directive.

@jbpascal Statute allows GOED exec director to issue post-perform. incentives, with support and guidance from publicly representative board.
@robertGehrke @benwinslow @sltrib State auditor ignores revenues in its criticism of GOED’s incentives...only discusses expense side.
@robertGehrke @benwinslow @sltrib Net new tax revenue collected through GOED incentives has topped $128 million since 2006.

@RobertGehrke @BenWinslow Net new tax revenue collected through GOED incentives has topped $128 million since 2006.
@RobertGehrke Job count is only one metric to determine tax credit. Major requirement is incremental new taxes collected, e.g. new funding.
@BenWinslow GOED’s post-performance incentives are conservative. No tax credit is paid out until new taxes are already in the state coffers.
@RobertGehrke GOED is following the direction it has been given by the legislature to grow the economy in a safe, yet dynamic fashion.
