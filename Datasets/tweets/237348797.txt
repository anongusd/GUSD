May we all strive to emulate such kindness as we mourn the loss of his life.
President George H.W. Bush lived a life of extraordinary public service in nearly every realm of service possible from the military, to the intelligence community, to the White House. His service was accomplished with an uncommon courage, kindness, and decency.

Marvin Quattlebaum is uniquely well qualified for the bench and universally respected by all in South Carolina. Hopefully Senator Schumer can find a way to look at really unusual factors (like qualifications) in the future.
In addition, Senator Schumer did not oppose a recent white nominee in South Carolina also nominated by President Trump.

As I have said repeatedly, I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The contents of this memo do not - in any way - discredit his investigation.
While this memo raises serious concerns with the FISA process, I have been and remain confident in the overwhelming majority of the men and women serving at the FBI and DOJ.
It is important for the American public to know if the dossier was paid for by another candidate, used in court pleadings, vetted before it was used, vetted after it was used, and whether all relevant facts were shared with the tribunal approving of the FISA application.
There is a time to come and a time to go. This is the right time, for me, to leave politics and return to the justice system. Full statement here → https://t.co/7I8AApqvs1

Joining @TuckerCarlson to discuss the 384 pages of new text messages between top FBI officials. Tune in to @FoxNews at 8pm.
Rather than clearing up prior FBI and DOJ actions, these recently produced documents cause us to further question the credibility and objectivity of certain officials at the FBI.
The omission of text messages between December 2016 and May 2017, a critical gap encompassing the FBI's Russia investigation, is equally concerning.
The contents of these text messages between top FBI officials are extremely troubling in terms of when certain key decisions were made by the DOJ and the FBI, by whom these decisions were made, and the evident bias exhibited by those in charge of the investigation.

Americans care about the qualities inherent in people of good conscience who want to become Americans – no matter what country they come from.
For over 100 years Americans have said, "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free... send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me".
Those of us born in the United States won the "lottery" of life. We understand the desire of others to come to a land known for freedom and opportunity.
Section 702 is indispensable, vital, and critical to the freedom and security of this country. I urge my colleagues to support reauthorization.

I was present for nearly every minute of his two interviews. Those "reporting" on his two interviews were not present for a single minute of either interview.
I realize none of this makes for gripping headlines about out of control inquiries, heated exchanges, subplots to undermine ongoing investigations, or casts him in a negative light. It just happens to be accurate.
Deputy Director McCabe is an important fact witness. He was asked fair questions and his answers were as thorough as the venue allowed. He handled himself professionally as did the members of congress who attended.
2016 and 2017 presented challenging and unusual fact patterns for the DOJ and FBI. It is entirely appropriate to ask questions about both the results reached and the process by which those results were reached.
These were interviews, not "grillings". Never once was the witness "attacked". Never once was Special Counsel Mueller "undermined". I've never expressed "dissatisfaction" with any of his answers, publicly or privately, because his answers are just that - his answers.
This week I spent more time with and asked more questions of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe than any other member of congress, Republican or Democrat. Never once was a voice raised.
He also earned an apology from the "reporter" who disparaged him. Look at his work, not his race. https://t.co/3UXrlY6Rqp

Great meeting Gabe today. Thanks for coming by to visit! @MUSCkids  https://t.co/gSYhqX4XqT
And as we begin to heal, may our nation continue to remember – what binds us together far exceeds whatever may separate us.
As our hearts continue to ache, may we take a moment today to mourn the loss of the victims in both Charleston &amp; Orlando.
SC witnessed a fresh realization that our energies are best spent on those things we have in common rather than focusing on what divides.
Following the shooting, South Carolinians experienced a cognizable, demonstrated capacity to forgive in the face of unfathomable tragedy.
We continue to pray for the victims’ families and loved ones and stand alongside them as they continue to heal from this horrific tragedy.
One year ago today our nation witnessed an unspeakably heinous shooting when 9 innocent lives were tragically taken in a house of worship.

Each day, we lose 22 veterans to suicide. Today, we join their mission by raising awareness and expressing our support #Mission22
Mr. Solicitor General - if you want to see that damage, if you want to see tearing families apart... I hope you are watching this morning.
He said this: “the damage that would be wreaked by tearing apart families."
Just yesterday, the President's lawyer was at the Supreme Court arguing for the non-enforcement of the law.
I wish this administration talked more about that kind of separation, but primarily, I wish this administration did more about it.
But let us be clear: they are not talking about the separation that comes from burying your child. That is permanent, eternal separation.
This administration loves to talk about families being separated. That is the common mantra when discussing immigration.
It's just as inaccurate to categorize all 12 million aspiring citizens as dreamers &amp; valedictorians as it is to categorize all as criminals.
Fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, friends and neighbors across the United States have lost loved ones at the hands of criminal aliens.
These are not merely statistics – these are tragic, real stories of human suffering.
Today, there are over 350,000 known criminal aliens in the U.S. who are not detained by ICE.
Between October 2011 through December 2014, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released criminal aliens over 100,000 times.
Illegal immigration is not a victimless crime.

Just spoke on the House floor regarding the consequences of abandoning the law -&gt; https://t.co/txn9c4ZGpJ
Good luck explaining why new citizens should follow the law when those in power do not.
The law is referenced five separate times in the oath of citizenship we require new citizens to take.
When the law is abandoned, it is weakened in the eyes of those we expect to follow it.
Once you decide some laws are worth enforcing and some are not, you have weakened the law – forever.
We symbolize our devotion to the equal application of the law with a blindfolded woman holding a set of scales and a sword.
The law not only binds us together, it embodies the virtues we cherish: justice, mercy, equality, and fairness.
For too long, Congress has let the Executive Branch engage in constitutional adverse possession.
While today you may benefit from the non-enforcement of the law, tomorrow will be different.
One person does not make law in our republic.
Attempts to undermine the law, regardless of motivation, are detrimental to the republic.
The law makes the rich respect the poor. It allows the powerless to challenge the powerful.
The law is the thread that holds the tapestry of our country together. It is the most unifying, equalizing force we have.
We make law with the expectation the law will be respected, enforced and executed.
The law is the reason the legislative branch exists. We do not exist to pass ideas or make suggestions - we make law.

RT @HouseJudiciary: ICYMI: @TGowdySC opening statement on the massive wave of illegal immigration: https://t.co/UZqxxFwmdL
Securing the border and ensuring the safety of our citizens is an integral responsibility of the federal government.
Legal immigration is a privilege this country conveys under the terms and conditions it sets. Illegal immigration is just that – illegal.
A sovereign country is entitled to control who gains access to this country, how that access is gained, and in what capacity.
In the words of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner, “we could very well be seeing the new normal.” This is unacceptable.
According to a recent Senate report, children are being placed in the hands of abusive and exploitive sponsors upon arrival to the US.
Current illegal aliens in the US are paying thousands of dollars to criminal organizations to transport their children across our border.

We must send a clear message to potential illegal immigrants that discourage illegal entry into our country.
Based on a report, nearly 60% said it was the Administration’s immigration policies that influenced their decision to come to the U.S.
If these trends continue, it is projected there will be a 30% increase in the record high numbers we witnessed throughout 2014.
In the past few months, the number of unaccompanied alien minors illegally entering the U.S. soared to over 17,000.
