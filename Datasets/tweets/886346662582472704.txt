@BTSonyeo @PerezHilton I'm a huge fan of hers. üôÇ		That's part and parcel to why I accepted your original premise and wanted to have this conversation.		She may hear how well she is adored but how many of us really accept praise at face value? I admit my judgement is skewed. But, ultimately, why judge?
@BTSonyeo @PerezHilton I understand your argument, and it is sensible. I just worry that people are too ready to meme and use stills to make people look...unbecoming. She's a human. Why not treat her like one?
@PerezHilton Celebrities have, ultimately, so little control over their public portrayals that I can't find fault with her request. She isn't asking for people not to photograph her, she is asking for respect. Why is that wrong?

@pinouye50 @AmySings0 @chaddiedabaddie She didn't blame anyone; she said she doesn't want platitudes but preventative action. Those things are entirely different. She's also handled disagreement with remarkable aplomb so, please, don't paint with such a broad brush.
@DebbieLemieux @Dreama1963 @RacingChic1919 @Janice11nj @RealJamesWoods The argument is based on the fact that every trip to a hotel or property owned by Trump increases his wealth.
