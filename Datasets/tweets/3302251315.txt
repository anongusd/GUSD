@AynRandPaulRyan But I'm going to prison?
Today I begin 2 years in #prison for thimble of pot I used for #PTSD. #Arizona has #vets in all top spots yet one of the highest #suicide rates. What happened to Vets Helping Vets? Why are you leaving me to hang in a prison cell?		@SenJohnMcCain 	@GeneralBrnovich 	@marcoattorney
As I sign off of vetscan ID forever at least I know that when I served in the military it wasn't for a bunch of imbeciles

@judgealexferrer Of course not.  I do believe that veterans should be afforded treatment courts over incarceration
