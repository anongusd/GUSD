@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows You are a buffoon!
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows I also find your letter of referral laughable as you wrote no such letter nor did you protest when he initially appeared before Congress and lied . You never really wanted the truth, you just wanted to defend the Republican President at all cost.
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows You should heed Mr. Cohens warning and stop your blind loyalty to Donald Trump and do what you are sworn to do,defend the Constitution! As a footnote, a rent you still under investigation? Asking for a friend...
@Jim_Jordan @RepMarkMeadows It's clear that you as well as you cohorts came with the agenda to entrap Michael Cohen into tripping over himself and his words so you could do what you're doing now. However I doubt that will work, and you reveal yourself as the stooge you are.
@RepMarkMeadows If you really cared about your relationship with Rep. Cummings and your family of color, you would work toward being more introspective about your words and actions rather than hide behind your tears and denial.
@RepMarkMeadows Your defense is a non defense, and Elijah Cummings giving you cover is not going to give you a pass as,contrary to what you'd like to believe, Mr.Cummings does not speak for All black people.
@RepMarkMeadows Mr Meadows,having black family members or friends does not mean you dont have racist views or carry racial bias. You are the same person who said we should send Barak Obama back to Kenya. The American President at the time.
This is a U.S. Congressman saying this garbage on his personal Twitter page. Not a spoof page as far as I can tell,yes I did dig. On his Official Rep. page he talks about being against bullying. This is why votes matter. I am speechless. https://t.co/a4KgoGiXOZ
@mattgaetz @MichaelCohen212 Wow Rep. Gaetz on your official page you talk about being against bullying but I guess the real you is all for it. You should really think before you tweet.
@RepMattGaetz @FoxNews Local police forces do not and should not do ICE's job." Papers please" is a phrase that should never be uttered in our country. 	Your solution is not The solution. You are on the wrong side of history!
@RepMattGaetz The operative words are "we just seized"....that means what we are doing works. Stop the nonsense. Stop the lying.
@RebeccaFront Rest in peace sir. Heartbreaking.
@realDonaldTrump Yes you did and so did Barak Obama.The truth is you have done so poorly in everything else, that I will leave the credit where credit is due,to the Generals.		You are not fit in any way.

@lisamurkowski Hooray for you, maybe vote against confirming Kavanaugh to further strengthen your support of women's health.
@lisamurkowski Yet you will stand by and vote to repeal and kill the Affordable Care Act. Shame on you! And  young girls Alaska  had better get ready to live again in a time that blocks women from deciding whether the have a child or not. Gee thanks Senator.
@lisamurkowski Speaking of healthcare, women's health and their ability to choose will be impacted by your vote to confirm Kavanaugh. I don't think they will forget the woman who made it all possible for him to overturn Roe, do you?
@lisamurkowski Speaking of women, how does she feel about you voting to confirm the man who will overturn Roe? How many deaths will be on your head when desperate women see no choice? How will history rememeber you?

9+ Sadly education in America is still not up to par. Charter schools are an instrument to break teachers unions, segregate students and ultimately dumb down the electorate.  One can see the fruition of this now with the rise of 45.
9. They support Charter schools that define and weaken public education.  This is lost because the illusion of choice makes people think they are a good thing but look at the history and you will see they're doing their job as many public local schools are being closed
8. They (GOP) Work tirelessly to suppress the vote and purge voter roles but claim to love Democracy.  Really? Truly they only love tgat which favors them.
Sarah Huckabee is deplorable.
7. They (GOP) Insist on overturning RoeVWade but offer no solutions to help these single mothers and fathers or struggling families. They do however make life harder on them through their awful policies.
Sarah Huckabee is a fool
6. Back to policy.. They (GOP) have repeatedly stood in the way of a raise in minimum wage, collective bargaining but claims to be for the American worker. I ask how?
5. Sarah Huckabee is a huge liar.  She just is. She is a master of spin though,  but facts matter. I hope she never eats in a public restaurant again.
4. Diving up our deficit each and every time they are in control, points to they're insincerity.
3. Insisting that government stay out of our lives while legislating on reproductive issues is hypocritical. 	.Using religion as an excuse for doing this  while decrying ,so called, Shariyah law  is laughable.
2. Cutting Medicare and Medicaid to pay for said  tax cuts is criminal.
1.The general Republican policy platform in my opinion is egregious. Tax cuts for the wealthy never created a job yet they continue to pursue this at a great cost to the working poor.

@SenFranken Please do not resign. If she could forgive you, I can. We can't afford to lose a seat. Do the work to make amends but for goodness sake stay in the Senate.
@oohlala143 @Johnaldinho816 @shoshannaclaire @SenFranken There are plenty of Senators who have not even been investigated on their admitted actions. He need not be a sacrificial lamb. Let the hearing go forward and let this be an example to others of how you take responsibility for your actions.
@_trific @jillralston30 @janlynnhen @SenFranken You know what, this is a Cold Civil War and we can't afford to unseat an ally. He is Taking responsibility for his actions. He did not do this as a Senator to a staffer. We need him to stay put. If there are more allegations the yes but for now, slow down.
@SenFranken Senator, her words and thst photo made me sad. I believe people can change and I commend your willingness to be scrutinized. I do not want you to resign, unless of course there's worse that we don't know about. my question to you now, how will you make amends?
@NomieDpuma @NatalieElsberg @PhilippeReines @SenGillibrand I hate to admit it but you are dead on
@NatalieElsberg @PhilippeReines @SenGillibrand He isn't going to resign nor should he. Why should he be the sacrificial lamb while other,  who have used tax payer money to pay off and silence women , still sit in the Hill. If we hear more allegations or if they are worse then yes but for now, no.
@PhilippeReines @SenGillibrand Having said that, sexual harassment,  battery and so forth has been protected onThe Hill for years. Look at Clarence Thomas. Look at the allegations against Bush Sr. On and on. On both sides ( lol) Like the song says the times they are a changing and she has a right to speak out.
@PhilippeReines @SenGillibrand Monica Lewinsky is not the poster child for this subject. She wrote a whole book on how she pursued Bill Clinton and how she had an affair with another married man. Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath as he should have been, not for his affair with her.

But to be clear , as Roy Moore goes on T.V. with the women who enable him, all women should examine how we enable the men in our lives and correct ourselves.
I hope moving forward we show support for victims and foster a culture of transparency.  I also hope that we teach our young boys that respect,self control, and compassion is better than machismo.
For generations women have kept eachother silent, out of fear, or greed, even jealousy. We can not deny how this has aided predatory men and women.
Part of the problem with women being harassed has to do with how women don't support eachother.

@defectiveMom @theeyefollows @Joymar27 @LindseyGrahamSC And I agree, name calling is getting us nowhere.

@WaskelweeWabbit @spearsmariel @HouseGOP This will hurt the markets as well. He along with GOP, is sabatoging healthcare and hurting you. Not so called moochers.
@WaskelweeWabbit @spearsmariel @HouseGOP By trying to vote down the ACA.  Or because yoyr Gov. Didn't enter into the exchange. Now Trump is withholding funds to the States.
@WaskelweeWabbit @spearsmariel @HouseGOP I read the ACA. The mandate was put there by the GOP.The fact that you have to pay so much could be because of how they created uncertainty
@WaskelweeWabbit @spearsmariel @HouseGOP Uh I am not a moocher. My husband has healthcare through his employer. Yours is I'd up because of the GOP. Do the research.

@SenatorCollins But that was then. Now you have taken steps to do the right thing. Follow McCain's lead and work together to get things done.
@SenatorCollins Mitch McConnell wanted Obama to fail and thus gave your party permission to not do the people's work.They should be ashamed.
@SenatorCollins Your party under McConnell was loath to pass anything that would make it look like Obama was succeeding.
@SenatorCollins Under Mitch McConnell,the Senate followed obstruction tactics to undermine Obama. Even when the ideas were good.
@SenatorCollins Your assertions that the ACA is failing comes with your knowledge that your party worked hard to make sure that it would.
@SenatorCollins Perhaps if 45 would release funds and stop sabotaging the ACA, insurers would stay in the exchange.
@SenatorCollins Perhaps if the GOP hadn't caused uncertainty in the markets by having all those repeal votes, maybe more insurers wouldn't have pulled out.
@SenatorCollins Thank you for standing strong. I know your reasons were different from why I wanted this to be voted down,but thanks anyway.

@senrobportman You fail Ohio and blood will be on your hands.
@senrobportman Tell 45 to release the funds meant to subsidize those people who need it. That is why insurers are pulling out.God help U and forgive U
@senrobportman U should be ashamed but I know U are not. I will pray for this country that you claim to love.   I pray for those who support U, and for U.
@senrobportman The Bush years proved how wrong you are on that. You have crippled the middle class with you blind pursuit of tax breaks,deregulation.
@senrobportman You believe in tax breaks for the wealthy and free markets. But that only makes the rich, richer. It doesn't create jobs.
@senrobportman You are engaging in deceit. The ACA can be improved. You just want it to fail because you don't believe in social programs for the poor.
@senrobportman Your statement on the floor was met with no push back. You talked to your people. The once Grand Old Party. We would like to see you in Ohio
@senrobportman It is each of your supporters and those who oppose you that will suffer together.u don't even have the guts turn o have a town hall meeting
@senrobportman You now aid a Presidency who appeals to the devils in all of us. He is weak and foolish and you use him to promote a plutocratic ideology.
@senrobportman Our infrastructure is Crumbling. If F.D.R  could do what he did what is wrong with you. Your party opposed all of Obama's plans.
@senrobportman But our nation is under educated because of your policies.underpayed because of your policies. They will be underinsured because of you.
@senrobportman You love corporate welfare but slash social programs that help the poor. Then you use racist code words to divide the poor. And it works.
@senrobportman Your party rolls back protections for consumers and calls it freedom. Freedom for who? The Koch Brothers? Big oil?
@senrobportman You have two faces sir and you lie to the people who vote for you and point fingers at the opposition when is your party that fails
@senrobportman You talk about stagnant wages yet you vote against raising the minimum wage again and again. How do you sleep at night.
@senrobportman Unlike a lot of people I read the ACA. I hoped for single payer but I knew that your party would never allow that.
@senrobportman This is the problem with the GOP. You do little in good faith. It's all about winners and losers for you. Not serving. You value the rich.
@senrobportman If only U and GOP had included measures that would work when you were asked to.Instead your party turned this into an insurance reform bill
@senrobportman If only you and GOP hasn't kept voting to repeal. The markets would have been stable. You know how that works and yet you kept sabatoging.

4. I hope those of U who believe white skin is currency will wake up and see how you've been played by elites who have yet to cut U in.
3. When you vote your bias you forget all the ways in which we , as a people, share in the pain of job loss,income inequality and so on.
2. Middle income and poor whites need to take a hard look at how you aid your oppressors. What do you gain from this?
