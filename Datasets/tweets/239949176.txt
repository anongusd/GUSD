The Family Unity Rights and Protection Act would require the government to be responsible for these reunifications and would protect and retain the parental rights of parents crossing the border. It would make sure these families are reunited. We should pass it NOW.
And that’s if the government deems them “fit” to be parents or guardians. This happens all the time in our child welfare system but who are we to make that value judgement on a family that we separated at our border for no reason other than to deter future crossings?
If the government somehow locates the child related to the person they deported, they charge the PARENT to fly the child and a chaperone to them. Some parents are forced to pay more than $1,500 to get their kids back after we separated them. That’s unacceptable.
As it is, it's the responsibility of the PARENT to find their child. Once deported, they are told to call a 1-800 number and hope that if a social worker picks up, they will be able to locate their child. After the call, the parent could be waiting days or weeks to hear back.
There IS a solution to reunify these families outside of court order – Congress could pass the Family Unity Rights and Protection Act to force the government to take full responsibility for reunifying these families. Republicans just won’t do it. The bill does a few things --

Right now, someone can get kicked out of a bar because they are too young to drink and then go buy a semi-automatic assault rifle made for war. Where is the courage of lawmakers in this country? Why have we been doing more to arm people than protect them?
The way to keep guns OUT of our schools is not to put guns in them. Trump’s suggestion today is absolutely unfathomable and must be stopped.

Trump referred to Haiti and countries from Africa as shitholes. Congress should show Trump and the WORLD that America does not feel that way. We should #CensureTrump immediately.

We cannot and must not sacrifice the health of those on the ground in the name of airline efficiency.
My amendments blocked yesterday by Republican leadership represent steps toward addressing what has become an intolerable level of noise.
Folks in LA and across the country are suffering under the burden of excessive airplane noise.
And I will say as much on the House floor tomorrow morning. I will continue to fight for #QuietSkies.
This outrageous disregard for the impact these planes are having is alarming, to say the least
…meaning Repub leadership decided to block all 6 of my #QuietSkies amendments and deny them a final vote on the House floor.

Now, we have to wait and see if Repub. leaders will allow the amendments to be voted on. The hearing will go on all night.  Stay tuned.
Increasing airline efficiency MUST not and CANNOT require the sacrifice of health and well-being of those on the ground.
This is the culmination of countless meetings, townhalls, and visits. Congress must take action to address airplane noise and its harms.
Several residents dedicated to #QuietSkies from Culver City &amp; West Adams helped me develop what I presented tonight.
Tonight, I testified to offer amendments combatting rampant &amp; outrageous airplane noise that has been plaguing LA for years.

Harriet Tubman has always been my hero because she was a fighter!! Fought against slavery and freed hundreds of enslaved people.
If you want to understand Tubman's incredible journey watch "Underground" the series about the Underground Railroad on itunes.
Harriet Tubman helped enslaved people escape---she righteously broke the law and by any means necessary to free enslaved people.
Harriet Tubman was born in slavery, but when she died she was free woman!!
Harriet Tubman on $20 bill and   @NMAAHC set to open---perhaps U.S. can come to grips that slavery was accepted in here for over 200 years.
Harriet Tubman was a soldier in the Union Army---a female spy and nurse during the Civil War.
Thousands signed the petition for Harriet Tubman to be on US currency! Wonderful so many people understood she was an abolitionist fighter.
Two victories in two days! Confederate flag won't be on display in the US Capitol and Harriet Tubman will be on the $20 bill!

Join me, @AntiRecidivism &amp; @rights4girls for a town hall on the needs of women &amp; girls in the criminal justice system http://t.co/RN7UQqyA9R
2/3 of female state prisoners are mothers of a child under 18. Many risk having their parental rights terminated due to long sentences.
.@OJPOJJDP found only ~50% of incarcerated youth are in a facility that provides mental health evaluations of all residents #girlsbehindbars
Girls’ common reactions to trauma—such as running away &amp; substance abuse—are criminalized instead of treated. #girlsbehindbars
A history of sexual abuse is the strongest predictor of whether a girl be arrested again after she is released from juvenile detention.
Check out my op-ed in @OurWeeklyNews about why we must act to plug the pipeline to prison for our women and girls: http://t.co/fW4ir2nOJj
When women lash out and abuse substances to deal with trauma, they are criminalized and the trauma often goes untreated.
Study after study shows that the effects of trauma and abuse end up putting #girlsbehindbars &amp; women in prison.
You're invited to my next town hall this Saturday, 8/22 at 9:30am "Girls and Women of Color: The Pipeline to Prison”: http://t.co/RN7UQqyA9R
As Congress begins discussing criminal justice reform, we must make sure female voices are included. Be heard at http://t.co/RN7UQqyA9R
A 1992 study found that up to 90% of the women who were incarcerated for killing men had been battered by those men.
Some estimates state that 92% of all women in California prisons have been battered and abused in their lifetimes.
While the rest of the prison population decreased between 1980 &amp; 2010, the number of women in prison skyrocketed by over 600%.
Women were the fastest growing population of prisoners between 1980 and 2010.
College should be a pathway to the American dream, not a mountain of debt. I stand with Dems pushing for #DebtFreeCollege
How should Congress address the unique needs of incarcerated women &amp; girls of color? Share your thoughts at http://t.co/RN7UQqyA9R
Latino women represent 16% of incarcerated women, although they make up only 11% of all women in the U.S.
Black women represent 30% of all incarcerated women, although they represent 13% of all women in the U.S.
African American children comprise 59% of all prostitution-related arrests under the age of 18. There is #nosuchthing as a child prostitute.
We can help stop the pipeline by screening #girlsbehindbars for sex trafficking, trauma and abuse.
In Los Angeles, girls in the child welfare system are more likely to end up in the juvenile justice system #girlsbehindbars
A 1998 study found that 81% of girls in California’s juvenile justice system were sexually or physically abused. #girlsbehindbars

More than 90% of participants in this telephone town hall say the President addressed an issue that was important to them tonight.
Jean asked why GOP keeps criticizing #Obamacare. I think we will see much less criticism now that so many people are covered &amp; benefitting
Michael asked what POTUS accomplished since his last #SOTU. He promised 2014 would be a year of action which we saw re: immigration &amp; Cuba
@Sp3cial_Kae Thanks for joining our telephone town hall tonight!
Rita just asked why there is so much debate about raising the minimum wage. I'm hoping that constituents will pressure reps to #RaiseTheWage
I'm beginning my telephone town hall on the State of the Union for constituents. What did you think of President Obama's #SOTU speech?
Nothing is more American than ensuring that every American can exercise their right to vote. Let's lift up voices instead of barriers. #SOTU
Persecuting any one group of people endangers us all. Persecution of women,  religious minorities, and the LGBT community must end. #SOTU
I'm not a scientist either, but I understand math. 14 of the 15 warmest years have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century. #SOTU
"In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date." Cuba has medications to lower amputations for diabetics. #SOTU
America's infrastructure is larger than 1 pipeline--time for modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet. #SOTU
When unions are strong, America and the middle class succeed. "We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions." #SOTU
I am ready to vote yes for paid sick leave. I hope Republicans in Congress will join me.
"We’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave." Time to change that. #SOTU
And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage. #Obamacareisworking #SOTU
