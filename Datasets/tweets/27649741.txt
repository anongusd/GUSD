In 2018, just 62% of registered women voted in the general election. @GovNedLamont and @SOTSMerrill are working to make it easier for everyone to vote by offering online registration, pre-registration and early voting.		#InternationalWomensDay
Between ‘16 and ‘18, drug deaths increased 39% among females aged 15-44. @GovNedLamont’s budget makes more money available for medication-assisted treatment, the most effective method we have to fight addiction.		#InternationalWomensDay
Connecticut women lose $15b every year to the wage gap. That’s money that isn’t being spent at CT businesses or growing CT’s economy.		#InternationalWomensDay
There are 113,100 women-owned businesses in Connecticut that employ 95,300 people and contribute $16.4 billion to the state’s economy. Fostering women’s success in business helps Connecticut grow.		#InternationalWomensDay

60% of single-female households in Connecticut have less than 3 months’ expenses in savings. Serious illness or unexpected job loss can be devastating to these families.		#InternationalWomensDay
Women make up over 54% of those making less than $15 per hour, but less than half of the U.S. workforce. @GovNedLamont’s legislation increasing the minimum wage will help close the equal pay gap.		#InternationalWomensDay
Only 22% of women in Hartford County have a bachelor’s degree, which means 78% of them are earning $22k less a year than their college-educated counterparts.		#InternationalWomensDay
Connecticut women earn just 79 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work. On average, thats over $13k, or 21%, less a year.	For. 	The. 	Same. 	Work.		#InternationalWomensDay
In Connecticut, more than 170k family households are headed by women. 1/4 of those families fall below the poverty level. If the wage gap disappeared, these families could buy over a year’s worth of food, and still have enough left for six months’ rent.		#InternationalWomensDay
On average, Paid Family and Medical Leave doubles the amount of time new mothers are able to take for maternity leave, leading to healthier families &amp; less money spent on healthcare.		#InternationalWomensDay
75% of unpaid family caregivers and 65% of family care recipients are female. Paid Family and Medical Leave enables women to take care of their family without penalty.		#InternationalWomensDay
Women make up 52% of the state’s population but only 33% of the legislature. Programs like @emilyslist and @Emerge_Conn make sure women have the tools they need to run for office and win.		#InternationalWomensDay

Since 2007, the number of businesses owned by women has increased by 58%, but women still only own 4 out of every 10 businesses in the country. @GovNedLamont’s budget modernizes state services, making it easier for women to be their own bosses.		#InternationalWomensDay
At last count, of the 12 million single-family households in the U.S., 80% were parented by a single mom. Paid Family Medical Leave would stop moms from having to choose between getting paid and taking care of a sick child.		#InternationalWomensDay

@GovNedLamont’s transportation plan is about one thing: bringing jobs, growth and prosperity to Connecticut.		#CTpolitics
9 of Connecticut’s cities are on major rail lines. @GovNedLamont knows fixing rail service is vital to building the vibrant cities that bring jobs and young workers to our state and keep Connecticut growing.
Annual toll revenues:		NH: $131m	NY: $708m	ME: $134m	MA: $395m	RI: $20m	PA: $1b	NJ $1.57b	---	CT: $0		It’s a self-inflicted competitive disadvantage, and only @GovNedLamont fixes it.

We learned from Kansas that @bobforgovernor’s tax scheme isn’t new--and it doesn’t work. 		Schools will be underfunded, infrastructure will be gutted, property taxes will skyrocket, and the middle class will take a huge hit.
Susan Bysiewicz has fought for women’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, and affordable health care for her entire career. And as the next LG of CT @SusanforCT will continue fighting for equality and inclusion.
Women across Connecticut heard @CTGOP #ctgov nominee @bobforgovernor and LG nominee @JoeMarkley loud and clear when they said that women’s health and reproductive rights are not an issue in this election. 		Bad news for Bob &amp; Joe: Women vote.
Arming teachers isn’t the answer to protecting our schools. 		Democrats like @ChrisMurphyCT are focused on common sense solutions that protect students and teachers from #gunviolence. 	https://t.co/LOTXQ1HLOa

The one million Connecticut residents in danger of losing health coverage would probably take issue with @CTGOP claims that what Trump does is not a local issue.
By refusing to speak out against the Trump administration’s recent immigration directives and refusal to defend pre-existing condition coverage, @CTGOP continue putting their access to @RNC $$$ before the people of Connecticut.
Where @CTGOP elected officials and candidates stand on the issue of affordable health care affects millions of Connecticut students, families, and teachers. And it’s one they should take a stand on.
As opposition to Trump’s health care sabotage grows to a fever pitch, why have @CTGOP #ctgov candidates remained silent? Apparently, the @GOP’s warning about not supporting Trump was heard loud and clear at @CTGOP HQ.
By opposing measures that protect #NetNeutrality, #BanBumpStock, and defend affordable health care, CT Republicans have shown that their loyalty lies with the Koch Brothers and special interests like the NRA - not the people of Connecticut.

Connecticut needs leaders who will stand up to the Trump administration’s efforts to sabotage healthcare, attack immigrants, &amp; ignore gun reform. @CTGOP are utterly incapable of putting the needs of CT before their party’s national agenda.
.@MayorMark won't stand up for our workers, for women's health, for the LGBTQ community, or for our state. Let's be very clear, Mark Boughton supports Donald Trump's policies and wants to be his partner in Connecticut.
We don’t need a leader who waits to be asked a question &amp; then skirts around a response to please @POTUS Trump without mentioning him by name. We need a leader who will stand up for CT, not a single candidate at the @CTGOP convention has shown us they are willing to do that
And they won’t stand up for Connecticut, as each and every candidate was silent on an ACA repeal that would harm Connecticut and a tax bill that would solely benefit the 1%.
They won’t stand up for gun violence prevention or even listen to the students that are making their voice heard, as they continue to support an organization that bullies teenage survivors and lobbies against legislation to keep us safe in the name of self-interest.
They won’t stand up for immigrants, who make our communities stronger and whose futures are uncertain in the age of Trump. They won’t stand up for women, who are seeing their access to vital health care services slowly chipped away by the Trump administration.
While Mark Boughton won this endorsement, each and every @CTGOP candidate that will continue to the primary to become our chief executive has shown us time and time again who they are and what they represent.
.@MayorMark is against raising the minimum wage and implemented anti-immigrant policies during his time as Mayor of Danbury. Mark Boughton won't stand up for our workers, for women's health, for the LGBTQ community, or for our state.
This is one of @MayorMark’s closest advisors. Let’s be very clear, these anti-LGBTQ and anti-women policies are exactly the kind Mark Boughton would enact he if were elected Governor.
.@SenatorMike recently voted against the Time’s Up Act, aimed to combat sexual harassment and assault, and against Net Neutrality.
While serving as Chief of Staff to @MayorMark, @SenatorMike scolded their then communications director for not disclosing that he was gay before they hired him.
.@MayorMark’s first act as the endorsed Republican candidate for Governor was to thank his braintrust, @SenatorMike. @SenatorMike led the Republican caucus to obstruct the nomination of Andrew McDonald, a qualified judge who would have been the first openly gay Chief Justice.
.@CTGOP has morphed into the Party of Trump by advocating for @POTUS Trump’s agenda at every turn while either ignoring or echoing his harmful rhetoric. #ctpolitics	READ ➡️ https://t.co/4wrbvTvo7k https://t.co/DC1wuTiZPG
Democrats will continue advocating for a progressive agenda that protects our LGBTQ community in Connecticut. #lgbtq 	https://t.co/o1wpmYNrBw
Let’s be clear, @MannySanto123 is not running for Congress so that he can serve the people of Connecticut, he’s running to be closer to Donald Trump. Since the first day of his campaign, Santos has made it clear he is eager to be Trump’s ally in Congress.
While Democrats have been engaging students, teachers, and parents in the community,  the @CTGOP has a table at their convention for an organization that refers to these concerned citizens as “Criminal Civil Terrorists”. #Enough	https://t.co/PfsyemF5BN
As @CTGOP nominate their candidates for elected office this weekend, they prove that their Party has made a calculated effort to make this a race to the right and to find candidates who can appease Donald Trump and the national Republican Party #ctpolitics	https://t.co/T8gleB0kHP
.@CTGOP has made it perfectly clear they won’t stand up to the Trump administration as they roll back progress on women’s health and access to reproductive care.
.@CTGOP #ctgov candidates have proven time and again that they are unwilling to cut ties with their NRA money to support gun legislation supported by over 80% of Americans.
.@PPACT provides essential health services and is committed to protecting women’s reproductive rights, yet @CTGOP #ctgov candidates are more than willing to allow the national @GOP to denigrate this critical work on behalf of women to earn praise from their national leaders.
While millions of Americans marched through the streets of America demanding commonsense gun reforms during #MarchForOurLives, @CTGOP #ctgov candidates still haven’t addressed students’ concerns for their safety. #Enough
While @CTGOP watch silently as Donald Trump, Mitch McConnell, &amp; Paul Ryan sabotage American healthcare, Democrats are hard at work enacting legislation that secures essential benefits and protects healthcare in Connecticut. #WhyIVote4Dems https://t.co/oRGuMNG1VX
Every single @CTGOP candidate has made a choice to turn their backs on the rights of women to score points with their national party’s agenda that seeks to roll back decades of progress towards gender equality.
As @CTGOP heads to their nominating convention many questions remain ignored by the candidates. Will they stand up for our health care? Would they repeal the recently passed bump stock ban in CT?
.@PeterLumaj once compared Planned Parenthood to the @NRA. Planned Parenthood provides health care services to over 2.5 million people. The @NRA lobbies against gun safety reforms and bullies survivors of the Parkland shooting on twitter.
.@CTGOP proudest accomplishments this legislative session was their ability to obstruct progress and advocate on behalf of special interests. 	https://t.co/CHUFV3avOO
Lets be very clear-- Connecticut Republicans have had every chance to stand up for women’s health as the Trump administration attempts to dismantle vital health care services and they have failed every single time.
Republicans at every level of government have chosen to follow Trump and the NRA’s lead on gun legislation, ignoring the broad majority of Americans who want commonsense reforms like bump stock ban &amp; assault weapons ban. #Enough
Republican #ctgov candidates say to prevent gun violence we need to invest in mental health services. Have they said anything about President Trump’s rollback of mental health services? https://t.co/BRW78pwSbH
Democrats are committed to defending the rights of all women to earn equal pay for equal work, have access to affordable healthcare, and be afforded the dignity deserved. #WhyIVote4Dems
Republicans have shown their true allegiance to the Mitch McConnell doctrine of obstruction this legislative session.  @CTGOP were given every opportunity to stand with the broad majority who support Net Neutrality, ACA, &amp; gun reforms, and they failed every time.
Thanks to Democratic leadership Connecticut workers will enjoy fair pay, CT families will have access to affordable healthcare, and all CT students will have the resources to succeed. #WhyIVote4Dems
Once again @CTGOP greatest legislative achievement this year was opposing legislation that enjoys broad support among all Americans like Net Neutrality, banning bump stock, and protecting the ACA.
Connecticut Republicans were forced to face the reality that their party’s wildly unpopular tax cut package was, in fact,  a scam to hurt the middle class while giving away $1.5 trillion to the top 1%. #GOPTaxScam	https://t.co/7mqP0LaMwj
Would any of the @CTGOP #ctgov candidates sign critical pieces of legislation like net neutrality or bump stock ban into law, or would they once again capitulate to Trump and the national Republican agenda?	https://t.co/tjcS82Q5XW
Connecticut voters have a choice this November between the @CTGOP, who will capitulate to the national Republican agenda, or a Democrat who will offer a bold, progressive vision for the future of Connecticut.
Connecticut Democrats are committed to a progressive agenda that recognizes all women’s rights are human rights by passing legislation that ensures. 		✅Dignity for Incarcerated Women	✅Pay Equity	✅Prenatal Healthcare Coverage	✅10 Essential Health benefits
Priorities for Democrats and Republicans are clear. Dems were fighting for Dreamers, gun violence prevention, and a free and accessible internet, @CTGOP were attempting to lobby to special interests and the national Republican Party at every turn.
This year in the legislature, Democrats passed  #payequity, #netneutrality, and #bumpstockban	Connecticut Democrats will continue fighting for progressive values that offer Connecticut families and workers a better deal. #ConnecticutFairness https://t.co/pfUl4YSKAz
"I said we would better prepared our state for the effects of climate change, and together, we did it while continuing to make our energy cheaper, cleaner, and more efficient." - @GovMalloyOffice

Democrats believe that immigrants make our communities stronger--and we need elected officials who are willing to stand up to this administration in order to protect our most vulnerable. #CTPolitics
When Trump ended the DACA program last year, Republican #ctgov candidates were either silent or complicit. We need leaders who will stand up for Connecticut, not cower behind Donald Trump’s agenda.
Democrats have implemented a progressive agenda this legislative session that protects healthcare benefits for CT residents, bans bump stocks, and ensures that every student in Connecticut has the resources to succeed.

The Congresswoman said it best herself, there is still work to be done. And I thank her for her continued service to our party and our state.”  - NB
I have no doubt that as Congresswoman Esty completes her term, she will use these experiences to fight for workplace protections and continue her work on women’s issues, of which she has been a leading advocate for the entirely of her career.
It is why we cannot lose focus and must continue the conversation about workplace harassment and the institutions that all too often fail to protect the victim.
That is why all of our Democratic leaders believe in listening to our constituents, advocates, and those that have been affected.
Make no mistake, this was not about politics for the Congresswoman or for the leaders of our party, this was about the real issues that women face in our workplace and across our communities.
As a result of these discussions, I believe this was ultimately the best decision for her and for her constituents.

Everyone already knows that @CTGOP #CTGov candidates either fully support Trump or cower in fear. CT has a right to know what specific areas of the Trump agenda would they allow to go unchecked in CT. It is a fair ? considering the embrace of all things #Trump by party leaders.
Now that @CTGOP chairman @thebigchezy has proclaimed that his party is ready to interject the Trump agenda and rhetoric into CT this year and beyond, it is only fair that #CTGov candidates should answer questions about their leader.
Another week has passed and still @CTGOP leaders like @lenfasano &amp; @RepTKlarides remain silent as @thebigchezy scrambles to appease the hard-core Trump wing of their party.

Now that @CTGOP has broken their silence to fully embrace the national @GOP agenda its time  they answer how far they’ll go to please #Trump
Funny how @CTGOP pushes #Trump talking points about #TrumpShutdown even though they still claim to have no position on national #politics 🤔
Not surprising that @CTGOP supports the #TrumpShutdown - holding govt hostage with a budget for political gain is kind of their thing.
2/ When #Trump decides he is ready to lead @GOP to a deal, Dems will be ready and willing to end this unnecessary impasse.#TrumpShutdown
1/Democrats continue to strive for a bipartisan agreement on all the outstanding issues that led to the #TrumpShutdown
FACT: Republicans led us to the #TrumpShutdown because @realDonaldTrump can’t say yes to the things he’s asked for.

"We have asked why his latest state budget, which he declared to be balanced, turned out to be $200 million in deficit, as predicted by Gov. Dannel Malloy." @LenFasano
"Connecticut citizens are affected by all these actions. That is why the JI believes Fasano should disclose his position on all issues — both state and national — that impact Connecticut residents." @LenFasano
Or what is @LenFasano stance regarding sanctuary laws and DACA children threatened by Trump’s regulatory revisions?
And what is his mindset on the new tax law passed by a Republican Congress that will affect Connecticut citizens represented by @LenFasano?
Where does @LenFasano stand on the action of the Republican leadership of the U.S. House of Representatives that could prevent Connecticut from enforcing its state laws against concealed carry of weapons?

@CTGOP The choice in 2018 is clear. We can elect a Democrat who will fight for middle-class families or a Republican who won't raise their voice if it crosses their party bosses while they push a trickle-down agenda that only benefits the wealthy -- as the rest of us pick up the tab.
@CTGOP Most recently it was their refusal to speak out against the disastrous GOP tax bill that will increase taxes on middle-class Connecticut residents just to give the wealthy a massive handout.
@CTGOP All of them have shown time and again that, when given the choice between fighting for Connecticut families or following Trump and his national GOP allies, they will choose Trump every time.
The shadow of Donald Trump hangs over each and every Republican candidate on that stage at tonight's @CTGOP debate.

@CTGOP Their silence speaks volumes, however. It shows that they would rather appease Donald Trump than fight for the people of Connecticut, who are getting screwed over by the Republican Party. #GOPTaxScam
This wide-ranging and poorly thought out legislation will clearly hurt the state. It is beyond us how the @CTGOP candidates for governor - the people who, if elected, would have to deal with the fallout from this #GOPTaxScam - can remain silent.
And it will put higher education further out of reach for families, among many other destructive effects to our economy and our middle class. #GOPTaxScam
It will decrease Connecticut home values by up to 10 percent.
#GOPTaxScam will significantly raise taxes on middle class families in Connecticut.
It's hard to overstate just how damaging the #GOPTaxScam is for Connecticut. It will strip health coverage from thousands of people and more than double premiums for thousands more.
Middle class Connecticut families are waking up to learn that In the dead of night, Senate Republicans threw them directly under the bus while their GOP colleges who want to be Connecticut's next governor stood idly by. #GOPTaxScam
