@startrekcbs If it were left up to me, Star Trek Discovery would taken off the air, every copy of every episode deleted and stricken from the Trek timeline. Star Trek Discovery was someone screwed up fantasy that should have never been allowed to exist.

@lseltzer well I'm with you I hope they don't either
@lseltzer there is nothing on a computer that is impossible to steal
@lseltzer well I'm glad you think so but what is funny is is that you think the FBI can keep something like that secret.
@lseltzer so you can only imagine that one FBI agent and one computer can cause a lot of trouble
@lseltzer it only took one soldier and one computer to download military secrets and put it up on WikiLeaks
@lseltzer however I will send you an email and explain my position better
140 characters just isn't enough to explain why I think the FBI having a copy of that firmware is a bad idea
@lseltzer if it's software it can be loaded to hardware and walked right out the door.
@lseltzer there is always someone in some branch of government who steals at the prospect of big money
@lseltzer Think WikiLeaks and the military
@ZDNet @lseltzer ‚ÄùThe modified copy of iOS need not leave the premises" and you think that wouldn't happen? In this day and age? Get real.

@daringfireball Would really like to see you on Meerkat during your podcast sessions
@TechCrunch I think @AppMeerkat will hold it's own, Twitter isn't the only thing out there.
@karaswisher Any Recode Broadcasts coming to Meerkat or Periscope soon?
@currentgeek @scottjohnson Sorry to hear hope everything is fixed soon
@mashable Really enjoyed this conversation thanks for hosting this looking forward to more from Mashable
@mashable Much closer
@mashable If Meerkat can get Facebook behind them, it will be a different story as far as popularity goes
@mashable Curious I'm using Meerkat to AirPlay your broadcast, the video is on my TV the chat stays on the iPad I like this
@mashable Yeah Meerkat is great on the iPad
@mashable actually I think Facebook will be that 3rd app
@mashable yeah the 2016 elections will light up between Meerkat and Periscope with the right candidates
@mashable I sent an email to the Meerkat guys to add Chomecast support
@mashable I'd say the poor quality will keep stuff like that down I think
@mashable Meerkat is a cooler name
@mashable iPad version could go landscape
@mashable well which ever service has the best verb out of the name
@mashable I'm not really interested in the Leaderboard stuff
@mashable hearts are okay but distracting
@mashable The front page of Meerkat needs to be better organized
@mashable as soon as I said Amanda Knox conviction over turned you disappeared
@mashable you died lol
@mashable yep
@mashable no going back to prison for her
@mashable Amanda Knox conviction overturned
@mashable you all at Mashable seem to have really taken to both platforms. I haven't seen other news groups on as much as you all
@mashable I agree with that statement so far other
@mashable darn it can't go landscape now after the update
@mashable had to grab the update
@mashable Bye thanks
@mashable Do a follow up in 6 months and then compare
@mashable Unbelievable I'm hooked on Meerkat and Periscope

@jsneedles Got to run have a great evening
@jsneedles Doesn't sell
@jsneedles Well I hope Meerkat does sell, I like small businesses like them
@jsneedles I think Google or Facebook will try to buy Meerkat at some point
@jsneedles I suspect the coverage from South By South West pushed Periscope foward
@jsneedles It's a little to early to call don't you think
@jsneedles Give both platforms a year and see how close or how far the two are from each other

Has anyone figured out what the USB port on the #AmazonFireTV is used for?
@reneritchie @iMuggle  I can download purchases when I buy through iTunes but the Fire TV is vey nice. Spent the last hour playing with it
@scottjohnson Nice I can listen to you through Alpha Geek Radio on the new Amazon Fire TV
However if you have a Roku or an AppleTV you will find the #AmazonFireTV comparable to both when it comes to content
This is a great set up if you're new to streaming TV over the Internet you can't go wrong buying the  #AmazonFireTV
One big draw back, everything I buy on the Apple TV I can download, I can't download any purchases on the #AmazonFireTV
The game controller or remote works through the Amazon TV quite nicely and very fast #AmazonFireTVSetup
