These two are the balance mentioned in the Qur’an relating to أقرب للتقوى meaning being closest to taqwa, being just and pardoning.
Also strive to pardon those who commit personal slights or offenses against you, and to make excuses for the personal shortcomings of others.
Stand for justice against those who are inflicting injustices upon others or usurping their rights. There’s nothing spiritual about turning a blind eye to blatant injustices and systemic oppression against others, including those perpetrators from among one’s own group.

@ImanMasmoudi Identity politics to me is the very definition of al-‘Asabiyyah as defined by our Prophet. It’s identifying with a group of people based upon racial, ethnicity or another outward marker and supporting them based upon that irrespective of virtue. أن تعين قومك على الظلم
@ImanMasmoudi If you’re recording the session, I’d like to watch it. In sha Allah, it goes well.
@ImanMasmoudi That’s a risk for sure, but I don’t view that problem within the scope of identity politics. Perhaps we’re working from two different frameworks of what that term encompasses.
@hwmaqbul @DrShadeeElmasry @BinhamidAli @joewbradford @FarazRabbani @rashiddar We have a lot of work to do. May Allah تعالى bless you all for your efforts.
@hwmaqbul @DrShadeeElmasry @BinhamidAli @joewbradford @FarazRabbani @rashiddar Unfortunately, I know of a very prominent activist within our community who also holds this position. It’s an issue that we will soon need to address.
@ImanMasmoudi I can’t look into persons’ hearts, and I’m not in the position to judge why people obey the commands of praying, making Hajj, avoiding pork and alcohol, etc		قال الشافعي رضي الله عنه: قد أمر الله نبيه أن يحكم بالظاهر  والله متولي السرائر
@ImanMasmoudi Being spiritual off balance and needing to refine our practice is very different than in the name of identity politics, celebrating or facilitating kufr and haraam. They are not the same.
@ImanMasmoudi I would not call that identity politics. I call that a lack of spiritual balance. Holding on to what is commanded in sacred law is praiseworthy. To label that as obsession places a negative connotation upon that which is required within the deen.
@ImanMasmoudi I could give you many examples of this. I wrote about this issue in the beginning of my book Towards Sacred Activism.
@ImanMasmoudi Exhibit #1: Many Muslims celebrating a man as a “Muslim” for winning the an Oscar in Moonlighting. This was a celebration based upon identity politics void of consideration of his heterodox creed and the actual role he played which promoted munkar.
@ImanMasmoudi Many Muslims speak of being Muslim as primarily a socio-political identity and/or a quasi-ethnic identity over it being firstly a faith marker which entails mandatory belief in certain aspects of creed and sacred parameters.

One of the dangers of being involved in social justice activism is falling into self-righteousness. It’s easy for a person who advocates for justice daily to perceive truth as always being with him/her. 		Pray everyday for refuge from self-righteousness.
People can only judge by what’s outwardly apparent while Allah تعالى knows all which is not apparent to humans which includes intentions or motives.		How many times have we made mistakes and collected sins for judging others in haste or misreading others’ intentions?

@Msabd67 I agree, especially in Arab world.
This is why I’m of the view where it comes to a point when a group of scholars in these lands have to be courageous and speak out against oppression even if it costs them imprisonment. This is the way of Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Malik رضي الله عنهما.
When talking about anti-extremism work, it’s more than teaching youth proper ‘aqidah and fiqh. When youth see scholars siding with clear tyranny, not ambiguous matters, it undermines the youth’s trust in scholars. This plays into the hands of Al-Qaeda and Daesh.
Scholars close to the Egyptian, Saudi and UAE governments really need to do some major introspection. If they’re not going to speak out against those regimes’ crimes, they should at least separate themselves from being used as photo-ops giving them legitimacy.

@muhammadnur10 Thus even when Muslim is discussed in “the movement,” it’s racialized and doesn’t necessarily mean us, habib. That’s the context behind why I said what I did; I’ve seen this for over a decade being used this way in “the movement.”
@muhammadnur10 It would be better to word as Black, Arab and South Asian communities meaning sticking to racial categories. When such language is used in “the movement”, Muslim is used to primarily discuss Arabs and South Asians. If it’s a Black person who is Muslim, they say Black Muslim.
Black and Muslim including Muslim immigrants are not mutually exclusive. Activists and advocates need to stop this  “the Blacks and the Muslims” discourse. Erasure of Blackness among Muslims and treating Muslims as a quasi-racial group goes on too much in “the movement.” https://t.co/twvCTks4Gj

@BinteArif84 It’s a huge struggle indeed. I struggle with this at times.
We must also remind ourselves and allow ourselves to be reminded that our feelings don’t always represent the truth, and though people should have empathy, they’re not wrong if they don’t accept our feelings as incontrovertible truths.
Any of us who have suffered deep trauma need to accept that we need healing. Otherwise, we will be  involved in counter transference and commit zulm upon others even without bad intentions. Hurt people hurt people.
If we look at fellow believers’ speech and actions and our predominant first inclinations are to hold bad opinions about them, that is more about the state of our hearts, not the objects of those bad opinions.

@AhmedRIbrahimMD I would have waited to write such, but I’m not a media professional either.

My analysis is that although Black candidates can win House races in particular districts. It’s still difficult for Black candidates to win Senate seats in much of America, especially in so-called Red States. Racism combined with wedge issues make winning extremely unlikely. https://t.co/XkzgXgmjAR
@soledadobrien I have found little evidence to suggest that if the media called out her racism or even Trump’s more that it have changed the sentiments of racists or those who voted for her based upon a wedge issue which is sacrosanct to them personally.  This is America.
I’m not disappointed that Espy lost the Senate race in Mississippi because I never expected him to win. Hyde-Smith represents the majority sentiments of white folks in Mississippi and for that matter millions of others throughout rural America.

Having empathy for others doesn’t equal complete submission to others’ feelings. Also people’s feelings or views don’t equal incontrovertible truths. One can have empathy and respectfully disagree. The expectation of capitulation to one’s views is anti-intellectualism.
If you’re not from a certain group, you have no right to articulate an educated position of the views or behaviors of those within that group. You’re supposed to “sit down and shut up.” This is the currect state of anti-intellectualism among many “woke” folks today.

Some have also taken their religious identity as an idol, treating predominantly as a socio-political quasi ethnic identity, not firstly as one of seeking the Creator’s love by submission within sacred parameters.
The same is true for race and gender becoming forms of polytheism where these identities which have their proper places get placed on the alter of identity politics and get prostrated to like pagan idols.

@RasThaFarEye That’s Dunyawi religion, akhi.
@iman512 @iyad_elbaghdadi It’s a money maker for them for sure. That has nothing to due with the intentions of Hujjaj going there. We will not be questioned about others’ not fulfilling their duties properly, but we will be questioned about how we fulfilled our responsibilities that we were commanded.
@iyad_elbaghdadi A maqsid within the shari’ah pertaining to others doesn’t override one’s personal fard. This is a basic lesson within Usul al-Fiqh, my brother.
@i_baad @FORIDULALAM9999 You’re not obligated to go to Hajj until you pay your debt anyway. If you have a legitimate concern for your safety, that’s not going due to necessity. That’s different from a boycott based upon a political motive. إنما الأعمال بالنيات
@RasThaFarEye Yes, have thoughts of Yemen by making du’a for Yemem at the Ka’bah and Mt. Arafat while fulfilling one’s right with Allah. I saw Yemenis at last year’s Hajj. Despite what the regime is doing, they’re not even boycotting Hajj. None of us love Yemem more than Yemenis do, akhi.
@NYC_Akh Believe or not, there has been a few Muslims talking this stuff periodically for awhile. Abstaining from going due to one’s personal safety is very different than boycotting Hajj itself because one doesn’t like the regime’s politics.
@FORIDULALAM9999 @i_baad For all who are of age of puberty, sane, physically &amp; financially able, Hajj is obligatory just as as-Salah, az-Zakah &amp; as-Siyam. This is المعلوم من الدين بالضرورة.
@newmuslimsfield 1) Relating to the motive for not going, a legitimate threat to one’s safety is different than a boycott hoping for regime change. 2) The problem that you’ve mentioned has always existed. Hence why there’s a stipulation that women need a mahram on Hajj.
This boycott Hajj talk because of Saudi regime crimes just reminds me of how most within the generality have no working knowledge of the foundations (Usūl) of our sacred law. An imperative religious obligation cannot be boycotted in the name of a political objective.

@UbeMumu Unfortunately we have many good hearted brothers &amp; sisters who are using epistemologies developed outside of our tradition including Marxist influenced frameworks to view the world and even Islam. It’s so insidious that many are oblivious to it.
@figandoliveblog Given that I’ve seen a lot of young males in the community running away from responsibility, this is partially good news.
@muhammadnur10 @figandoliveblog That’s true, sidi, except for many binge drinkers.
It’s better to pardon a seemingly guilty person than to punish a person in which there’s reasonable doubt about their guilt. This is the Prophetic standard in the world. Perfect justice only comes in the next life where no one is getting away with even an atom’s weight of wrong.

@figandoliveblog There’s no doubt that Kavanaugh was a drunken hooligan in that phase of his life. I agree with you. It comes down to one word: Arrogance.
@SistaLachele I know that. Those allegations will not be enough to get Republicans to vote against him. Kavanaugh going Trump in that hearing should have so-called moderate Conservatives questioning his judiciousness.
Kavanaugh should be impeached. His recent performance shows that he’s untrustworthy and bias. This should be an agenda item if the Dems win back the majority in Congress.
I agree. My vote against him would be primarily about his demeanor and partisanship moreso than the conflicting testimonies between him and Ford. https://t.co/BbTaX7cKc3
@premed1 In fact, I think that the outpouring of rage at this mentally sick, hyper-narcissistic male actually makes matters worse. It’s better to ignore him to me instead of tweeting at him and pundits &amp; bloggers writing about this madness in excess.
@premed1 There’s a difference between vehemently disagreeing with his positions and showing rage towards him as a person. If I knew that he was sane and sober, I wouldn’t have said what I did. Showing anger at the mentally ill doesn’t help them. That’s #facts.

Just because you think that shi’ah are deviants should NOT mean that you praise or defend Yazid today. #Ashura 		اللهم لا تجعلنا من النواصب
Take meaning out of today’s fasting and today’s stories about Musa and Husayn. #Ashura
Our egos are inward Fir’awn’s and our lusts are our inward Yazid’s. We have to struggle against those inward tyrants if we are to properly deal with outward tyrants. #Ashura
Just as in the past, the archetype of Fir’awn is present. We need patience, discipline and courage to deal with today’s outward Fir’awn’s and Yazid’s. We need fasting and dhikr to increase our spiritual strength. #Ashura
Fir’awn is more than just an historical figure. He’s an archetype of tyrannical rule. Musa عليه السلام had Fir’awn. Yahya عليه السلام had his type of Fir’awn to deal with which led to his decapitation. Sayyiduna Husayn رضوان الله وسلامه عليه is a mirror of Yahya. #Ashura

@S_1dr4 Many people confuse the sincerity of their feelings as truth and correctness. We live in the Age of Feeling now as @McCormickProf has discussed.
@S_1dr4 Sincerity doesn’t equal correctness. A person can be sincere yet through ignorance or even improper presentation of the truth can drive others away. Sincerity which is a reflection of the condition of the heart needs to be coupled with knowledge, reason &amp; wisdom in application.

When folks come to me with deep issues, I refer them to someone more qualified. Don’t do folks a disservice in trying to counseling them if you’re not properly trained both spiritually in conjunction with secular mental health training.
Your homeboy or homegirl who is a professional therapist or psychiatrist may not be the person to go if you’re battling deep issues, Their personal biases may impede them from giving you the best help, and your personal relationship may cause you to not be totally forthcoming.
This is moreso true for certain communities which have stigmas around seeking help from mental health professionals. You’re not weak or less than if you need to speak with a professional counselor.
I’ve seen too many people over the years slip further into despair or bitterness by attempting to deal with their depression or trauma caused by dysfunction relationships by going to FB, IG and Twitter. This isn’t the place to deal with your personal life struggles.
If you’re suffering from depression or have some emotional trauma that you’re dealing with, go to a licensed therapist if able. If not, go to a trusted spiritual elder. Using social media as a balm for your issues isn’t the solution, nor going to your echo chamber of “friends.”
@AnnaMSterling @zellieimani What’s also troubling is the bystander who just watched without intervening. The poverty that grips Americans today is the deprivation of moral courage moreso than economic poverty.

Speakers with limited time and are reading the vibe of audiences may not mention all of the points that you expected or may have left something out. That doesn’t equal ill intentions or “erasure.” If I could, I would put a moratorium on the overly used term “erasure.”
If a speaker makes broad points that you agree with but gives an example that doesn’t make sense or perhaps rubs you the wrong way, take the good instead of dwelling on the minutia.

@jroberts786 @EightyFiveXs The problem becomes when the resistance to white supremacy is primarily based in socio-political discourse and protests without spiritual remedies being a focus for internal healing. Many have gone from the extreme of denial to a material/dunyawi preoccupation.
@EightyFiveXs @jroberts786 What’s interesting to me is just 7 years ago, there was hardly any talk about “the Man” from a large percentage of young adult children of African and Desi immigrants.

@jroberts786 @EightyFiveXs Religion has always been racialized in America as “white” has always been a social construct here. There’s a good book on this titled How the Irish Became White. I’m sure that it’s uncomfortable to realize that some of the privilege of white normalcy has been lost upon conversion
@jroberts786 @EightyFiveXs When African Americans say “the white man” or “the Man,” it connotes a system of oppression, not individual whites. I can see how that makes white Muslims uncomfortable. I have stopped using that phrase due to this sensitivity. So called PoC definitely can be anti-Muslim too.

If you see any of these candidates that have been endorsed by insiders within the Democratic Party, know that those are the folks that you should NOT vote for today in the primary elections when voting the Democratic slate.
So-called "liberals" and "progressives" who are cahoots with special interests are why charter schools took over and emergency managers took over majority cities of "People of Color" too.  It wasn't just Republicans. Look at Granholm's record for instance.
What @DNC, @MichiganDems &amp; party insiders  fail to realize is that establishment Democrats have failed which is why Trump and his acolytes won in 2016. The playing it safe posturing and mainstream establishment politics just won't cut it. Remember that at the polls today.

When people are hardened in a position and delve into irrationality, disengage from debating. Trying to convince them may turn into your fighting their ego with your ego. Once that happeneds, you’ve lost by succumbing to your nafs.

Using secular solutions as the foundation of addressing problems rooted in spiritual diseases is like just prescribing aspirin and cough syrup for someone with lung cancer.
@mesbushra @WalaaQuisay Yes, I agree when it’s the haqiqah of ‘ilm as as ash-Shafi’i stated that ‘ilm is not memorized but that which benefits meaning actualized. ‘ilm as in information that is not is without application or actualization is what I was referring too. JazakAllahu khayran.
@WalaaQuisay Yes which is also we differentiate between ‘ilm and ma’rifah. Having more accesss to ‘ilm alone definitely doesn’t solve the issue on its own. Ma’rifah is different.
@WalaaQuisay I also don’t subscribe to the CRT definition of racism being prejudice plus power. Positional power brings greater consequences and more spiritual harm on the offenders, but certainly those without power who hold racial animus can harm individuals as well as their own souls.
@WalaaQuisay I don’t believe that racism can be dealt with systematically without spiritual remedies along with education, laws and consequences. Political discourses about power and attempts to shift it through legislation and adjudication alone won’t work. America is a case study as to why.
@WalaaQuisay Racism is rooted in the spiritual disease of kibr then takabbur before the whole issue of prejudice plus “power.” Hence Sayyiduna Ali’s statement about Iblis not bowing to Adam that he is the Leader of those who display ta’assub and the Predecessor of those who have takabbur.

Shaming racism out of the masses of white supremacists isn’t a strategy which has worked historically in America.

@saq333 @IsmailRoyer Ironically in relationship to this tomfoolery, when the Muslims entered Persia over 13 centuries ago, they found Zoroasterians involved in these relationships.

@WalaaQuisay @ChicagoMureeds @joewbradford @jamillahkarim wa iyyaki
@WalaaQuisay @ChicagoMureeds @joewbradford That would be true for South Asians and some Arabs who are younger, but not true for African Americans who follow Malikiyyah. It’s more so a direct connection to West African shuyookh in Kaolack and Touba, Senegal. Shaykh Mendes is also a source for you to talk with.
@WalaaQuisay @ChicagoMureeds @joewbradford Contact Dr. Jamillah Karim on this specific aspect relating to your research. @jamillahkarim
@WalaaQuisay @joewbradford Example of this is that in South Dearborn, many Northern Yemenis will say that they or their families are Zaydi but in reality because there hasn’t been a Zaydi scholar here, they aren’t on that madhhab. They’re Zaydi by Ansaab but following Shafi’i rulings.
@WalaaQuisay @joewbradford Yes to both points. That’s what I thought. In reality, there hasn’t been any survey with a strong research method to provide such data. Thus the empirical data that you’re looking for in a paper probably doesn’t exist.
@ChicagoMureeds @WalaaQuisay @joewbradford Anecdotally speaking 10 years after the death of Warith Deen Mohammed رحمه الله, many from Gen. X and younger slowly shifted towards the madhhab per taking or being influenced by Shaykh Mahy Cisse who is Tijani and Maliki. I came out of this community myself and have seen this.
@WalaaQuisay @joewbradford Has there ever been any research done breaking down Sunnis in North America or the UK per percentage of madhhab?

Abu Bakr said, “Truthfulness (الصدق) is trust (أمانة). Not keeping one’s promises means lack of truthfulness which means lack of sincerity. 		اللهم اجعلنا من الصادقين
Hence striving to keep one’s promises even small is the starting point of noble character. If we investigate ourselves, we’ll find that other internal issues which we struggle with most likely stem from our lack of الصدق.
Prophet Muhammad said, “Surely truthfulness (الصدق) leads to righteousness (البر), and righteousness leads to Paradise.” Righteousness here means the coming together of all noble traits of character.
Sincerity and truthfulness are the foundation for all other noble characteristics. One can’t truly repent and improve without them nor be just, meaning to give everyone their proper due at their appropriate places and times.

@bornshaikh @MuslimDiasporas @intercepted @mehdirhasan Exactly. That’s not my line of thinking and operating. Besides it not working, one loses their ‘izzah in the process. My dignity is worthy more to me than being accepted.
@bornshaikh @MuslimDiasporas @intercepted @mehdirhasan I agree. I think that could have been done in the video without the Christian Taliban, caliph and mulla references though. Totally unnecessary, and counterproductive in this age of anti-Muslim sentiments in America.
@bornshaikh @MuslimDiasporas @intercepted @mehdirhasan It probably wouldn’t, but that’s better to me than appealing to them with a flawed narrative that further marginalizes us. I’ve seen little evidence that accommodating white fragility’s inability to deal with incontrovertible historical facts brings about social transformation.
@omersubhani Some did but the majority didn't. There was no collective outrage outside of Latinos to be frank. There's definitely the stench of partisanship in the air right now.
@MuslimDiasporas @bornshaikh @intercepted @mehdirhasan More specifically white supremacy in the name of  Christianity.  Manifest Destiny which ethnically cleansed Natives, chattel slavery to the KKK were all done in the name of perversions of Christianity. We are talking about centuries of violence.

Y’all get more upset over wolves splitting up families than when foxes split up families. Go back, and listen to the analogy that #MalcolmX gave regarding the wolf and the fox.
Children being separated from parents, and folks including minors being put in cages didn’t just start with “the Donald,” my neo-liberal friends. If we want to really bring systematic change, we should be sincere about facts.
Of course what Trump is doing is horrendous, and his administration has ramped up splitting up families in comparison to the final stage of Obama’s presidency. The outrage over Trump doing what he’s doing now has a scent of partisanship in it to me just to be frank.
NEWSFLASH: The Obama administration deported a lot of people and broke up many many families to the point that many immigrant rights activists called him “Deporter in Chief.” DACA, an Executive order, was only signed in his final year of office.

@S_1dr4 The ego can also deceive by holding that the person doesn’t need a murabbi. Having one can help attain humility and break the hold of the ego. As the proverb goes, even the sharpest blade can’t cut its own handle.
@S_1dr4 Salaam, the nafs/ego is prone to self-deception. We all need spiritual mentorship and to spend time with a murabbi who can advise us. Musa (AS) was a prophet and needed one as Surah al-Kahf shows. We are not on the level of him, so we definitely need one.
Giving an improper dosage of medicine can make one sick instead of curing. As this is true for the body, the same is true for the soul. 		Don’t play the role of your own doctor, especially if you lack proper qualifications. Even doctors go to see other doctors.

Surrounding one's self with the people of haqq influences us more to stay on haqq. Those who make their associations primarily with or give their hearts to the people of batil open up the doors to slip into darkness.
Know that the ability to see truth as truth is a provision from Allah and simply isn't something that persons can give to themselves.  Once persons incline their hearts towards what is openly displeasing to Allah, they're closing the doors to this provision.
اَللّٰهُمَّ اَرِنَا الْحَقَّ حَقًّا وَّ ارْزُقْنَا اتِّبَاعَهٗ وَ اَرِنَا الْبَاطِلَ بَاطِلًا وَّ ارْزُقْنَا اجْتِنَابَهٗ
To believers who see standards of good &amp; evil being openly twisted, know that there will always be a group within the Ummah who will stick to the truth. Ask Allah to make you among the people who see haqq as haqq then follow it, and batil as batil then stay away from it.

Fir’awn was the worse man on earth in his time. Nonetheless, Allah تعالى commanded Musa &amp; Harun سلام الله عليهما to address grievances with him using mild speech قولا ليّنا. Remember this with your brother or sister whom you disagree with.
Don’t exceed the boundaries set forth in our beautiful deen in criticizing your brother or sister who you disagree. If the goal is changing behavior, public name-calling isn’t the way.
I suggest on this best night &amp; day of the week, Jumu’ah, that you sincerely pray for those whom appear to be misguided brothers and sisters. Send more to them than just critiques or disses.

The Qur’an mentions those who sell His signs for a measly price - ثمنا قليلا. May Allah not make us be among those who sell their deen for cheap price, be it professional recognition, fame, acceptance, money, etc.
Allah is always present, never absent; Allah is the All-Seeing and All-Hearing.
