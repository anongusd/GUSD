@SonjaRDupree1 @NBCNews Your not too bright if you think Trump knew in advance about the murdered journalist! Could you show me exactly where you actually heard him say ‚ÄúMoney was valued more than human life‚Äù! He never said that. Your twisting his words, as liberals always do, to fit your hate agenda!
@SonjaRDupree1 @NBCNews Oh stop with that Obama bullshit. Obama was a feckless coward of a President. Other nations bullied us because they knew what he was. A slick talker. Nothing else!
@SonjaRDupree1 @NBCNews Obama and good family took loads of vacations. Check! He also maneuvered to basically steal acres of City Oark that‚Äôs trees are in the National Register. Trees he‚Äôs tearing down! For his CENTER! Not library! First President to not have a library. He and wife continue to grab $$$$
@SonjaRDupree1 @NBCNews How many chopping and beheadings were there during the Obama Administration? Do you even know? Did Obama break off relations with all those countries! (Let me help you!) ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù In fact, he gave Iran billions of our dollars! All while they committed atrocities! Get it straight!
