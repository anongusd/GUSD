@RickOliver214 I am so terribly sorry for your loss, Rick. No words can ever really give enough comfort, I know. Thank you for sharing your story , it's important for us to tell. Sending you all my love and support. üíîüíêüïä
@Madmex041 I too held my Nicole for hours after she passed. I'm so very sorry that you had to go through the same unbearable pain. We both know that words can't touch that pain but please know that I feel you and am sending you all my love and support. Bless you and your angel baby üíîüíêüïä
@jjsmokkieBOY57 I agree, juju. That's why I felt it was so important to share my story and now others are too.. some others already were as well. Hopefully more and more will come forward so people can see that this issue isn't what they think it is.

But, that honours no one. I'm really emotional and overwhelmed but I am glad I decided to share my story. It's helping in some small way and that means so much. It brought you to reply to me with your own and that is something I find courageous.
There were a few I couldn't tag but as you can see, there are so many of us. 		My heart is so heavy knowing you have all suffered or someone close to you has suffered. I think I spent years pretending that I was alone so I didn't have to feel the pain of knowing others suffer too

Now, with you all here, I can talk to you directly and tell you each how much I care. 		Ps. If you don't want to be in this thread, please mute it and we won't bother you or push you to talk. I don't want anyone feeling obligated to share. I respect your privacy. üíñ
I feel we are a sisterhood, and brothers too, who understand what each of us has experienced and endured, although our stories may vastly differ... our grief is familiar. I truly can't express my deepest feelings of empathy and compassion for every single one of you 4/
I really had no idea that my tweet thread about Nicole would receive so much attention and I am truly overwhelmed by it. Over 1,000 replies! I've been saving all of yours especially. I hope you can understand me reaching out to you all this way. 3/
Please forgive me tagging you here but it is so much easier for me to talk to all of you. Your stories are so important to me and I want each of you to know just how much I care, how much my heart hurts for you, and how touched I am. 2/
I've been trying to respond to every single one of you who shared your heartbreak and sorrow on my thread. I'm finding it very difficult as there are so many of you and it's been 4 days. I saved your tweets to my DMs so I could find you all. 1/

@LEWoodardPhD Thank you Lauren.
@ICE_MD What if I had known sooner? What of the women who do find out soon enough to choose to abort? Please take in the entire thread and not just this statement. Had I known soon enough I would have chosen to abort in order to stop her further suffering. My pain is increasing now.
@LEWoodardPhD I need to do better at keeping up with the genetic research that's been done over the last 15 years. I'm sure I would be gobsmacked by the advances that have been made! I blame emotional avoidance behavior on my part.
@ICE_MD I agree that the mathematical odds would suggest that at least one person would actually like/want (as in "I want the pleasure this brings me ") is out there. To me that would be very sadistic.

SHOULD be. I am #ProChoice and I believe in the teachings of Jesus. I am not an evangelical or a Catholic, I am a former protestant who has disowned organized religion for they clearly know not what they do. 	They have forgotten about mercy. They have forgotten about charity.14/
It's stronger than ever! God is with me and I know it, I feel it, I believe it. I'm not afraid of going to hell and I don't need to shove my faith down anyone else's throat. It's private and it's personal... one on one and it's nobody else's business... that's how faith 13/
I showed her mercy. I showed her love. It broke my heart and it broke my soul but I know where she is. She's not gone, she's just somewhere else and I'll get to see her again someday. I have REAL faith. My faith was the ONLY thing that got me through and 12/
Happening any further than that. Do they think I'm guilty of infanticide? She died as an infant, we kept her comfortable with morphine and oxygen after we took her off life support... am I a murderer in their eyes? I don't feel like one... if anything 11/
I'd give anything to see, smell, hold, and kiss my baby girl again but I thank God that she isn't suffering anymore and tbqh, if I could go back in time, I would show her mercy and have an abortion (as heartwrenching as it would be) so that I could stop her suffering from 10/
Regarding abortion rights in this country. Nobody LIKES abortion. Nobody WANTS abortion. People trying to interfere with pregnant women and their doctor need to accept the horrible reality that BABIES DIE! They need to accept the fact that WOMEN DIE! 9/
Calendar babies. Yes, there are cases where women are just inconvenienced but I argue that they are much fewer than the women with REAL MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS AND BABIES WITH REAL MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS. 		It is egregiously cruel to discount reality vs idealistic fantasy 8/
Not to mention that the mother herself can have serious life threatening complications during pregnancy that she has zero control over. #ProLife people need to face reality and get rid of their fallacy that #ProChoice people just want to kill perfectly healthy Anne Geddes 7/
In hospitals around the world. The cold hard facts are not easy to look at or accept but babies die! They die from a huge number of different medical conditions that sometimes are not detected in the womb. People need to understand that not every pregnancy has a happy ending 6/
I prayed and wept uncontrollably and prayed and wept uncontrollably on a loop. I also saw, while staying at the Children's hospital Pittsburgh, many suffering babies and young children. I realized that at any given moment on any given day, there are babies and children dying 5/
Suffering needed to end. I don't have the words to describe to you just how soul crushing this entire 3 month event was. Watching your baby suffer unspeakable pain and not being able to do anything is the most helpless emotional pain a parent can experience 4/
Life support. We were told we might be able to keep her alive longer with a tracheotomy (she already had a feeding tube). It was clear to us by this point that our little baby girl was dying. We chose not to go with a tracheotomy and decided that Nicole's 3/
We had a meeting with the hospital pastor, the palliative care director, and specialists of various types who all tried to help us save Nicole. The consensus was that if she survived, she would have no quality of life but that it was unlikely she would pull through w/o. 2/
15 years ago today, my baby girl died in my arms at 5  1/2 months old after suffering excruciating pain from a rare metabolic syndrome. The gruesome details of the long ordeal I will not go into. After doing everything we could we signed a DNR and took her off life support... 1/

@Franklin_Graham @VP @mike_pence @SecondLady You make me sick
I follow the teachings of Jesus but I left organized religion. I left my illogical fears and have a much saner relationship with God now. Org religion is a festering pustule of hypocrisy, fear, and hate. These people make me cringe. #EmptyThePews #NoFearOnlyLove https://t.co/mvWfdG94tm
@Franklin_Graham I hate to tell you this, Frankie boy but not only are you lukewarm but you are downright opposing the lessons Jesus taught. I don't think you're going where you THINK you're going when you pass away.
@Franklin_Graham So, taking God out of government is socialism? Mkay.
@Franklin_Graham @RepLizCheney @FoxNews So, because we want a government without a specific religion we're Marxist? Being a tad too dramatic there, Frankie boy.
@Franklin_Graham We do not need religion in our government. It's done nothing but cause problems.
@Franklin_Graham Christ on a stick,  learn how to thread, man.
