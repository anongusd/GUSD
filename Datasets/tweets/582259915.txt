@sentedcruz: How about just fix the problems people are having in every state. It's called common sense.
@SenTedCruz:  Yes and we also remember it was yourself and other fellow Republicans that caused that not to happen and say repeal instead...
@SenTedCruz as a combat disabled veteran I promise to vote against any Republican for Florida.  Do the job elected or loose seats.
@sentedcruz show your INS paperwork or resign.
@sentedcruz the GOP had over 3 decades to fix healthcare. And failed with healthcare &amp; veteran care.  Get real.
@SenTedCruz: He also said who am I to judge about same sex marriage.
@SenTedCruz Really considering last 2 yrs U worked 2 harm military &amp; disabled veterans families, plus other Fed Employee over there family!!
@SenTedCruz With failing to use leadership to fix the ACA instead of taking time that failed to repeal that your are leader.  NOT A LEADER!!
@SenateFloor @marcorubio maybe U/your staff should also be concerned about calling back a constituent that's a combat disabled vet.  Waiting
@SenateFloor @SenTedCruz maybe with all your preaching Sen U should care more about U/your staff calling a combat disabled vet back. Waiting
