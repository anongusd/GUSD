@traveler1984 @ITsTime2Float @NASA @NASAEarth Remember Antarctica is a continent. So, as the ice sheets float away the land ice melts faster decreasing the salinity of the water creating ice that forms easier and melts faster. Thus, being a sign the climate is warming.
@volansvolantis @LeiasApprentice The Antarctic ice sheets are only growing 1-4% per year, so not quite massively, and are of fresh water whilst replacing the saline ice sheets which require colder temps to form. Moreover, the Arctic ice sheets are decreasing by 11% per year accelerating the seas warming further.
@WhyWouldUDoTht @LeiasApprentice @NASA @NASAEarth Correct, but only partially. The Antarctic ice sheets are growing 1-4% per year. However they are formed from fresh water and are replacing the saline ice sheets which require colder temps to form. So, as sea temps further warm they will melt as well.
