@marcorubio climate change is a real, present moment problem that has reams of data and fact from 100‚Äôs of sources over many years. A National Emergency Power would be a good idea for that, not for a fantasy on our southern border.
@realDonaldTrump your use of ‚Äòfake news‚Äô isn‚Äôt working because you misheard what someone was telling you. They said ‚Äòfake it ‚Äòtil you make it‚Äô! You are supposed to be doing positive, helpful things and if some don‚Äôt work well, ok, you‚Äôre a newbie! So, well, you do the opposite!
@realDonaldTrump when your use of National Emergency powers to shift already needed allocated funds to build a folly on the border, the courts will take it apart. There is no data or fact that supports that need and a ton that says we need it many other places. Prioritize Plans!
@realDonaldTrump you won‚Äôt be able to use National Emergency powers for the barrier building on our southern border that is used to quicken the response time. Because there is no emergency there. Nothing is occurring there as you portray it. It is 99% illegal entry. Fantasy!
Agree. A bad method and it needs to change. Verification and validating our votes are entered and accepted properly is paramount. https://t.co/xpynuvSqea
@realDonaldTrump and the @GOP had at least three offers to get the Trump Fantasy Wall. Look where he would be now if he had accepted the DACA protection plan! $25Billion and would keep productive, long term residents, who were married and paying taxes, here as citizens! Stupid!
@realDonaldTrump is, as he always has, bringing out the stick in everything he does instead of the carrot, which works better. He would get 10x better return on effort and resources if he put source problem solving policy in place in areas we are facing those problem‚Äôs symptoms!

1. Mexico paying for the wall ‚Äòindirectly‚Äô? Shutting the Southern border foot traffic would be a mistake. Trade between the US/Mexico has sanctions and tariffs. Taxes on corporate trade profits are pulling much less after the tax break they received. Deficit is $2Trillion. Bad

If any large corporation was putting out obviously incorrect and misleading info at the culvert bandwidth Trump is, they would be shut down! https://t.co/aIOFQf8wNi
From now on, everything @realDonaldTrump says or tweets to us or the media, needs to come with fact checking to us and by the same media. Nothing should be disseminated without it.

Every single thing Trump has and is doing is only for the benefit of @realDonaldTrump which means it has to be what his misaligned, dysfunctional and under critical base wants, no matter how impractical! His very freedom depends on it. Not one other reason holds any water.
So why is @realDonaldTrump standing on his rock and making unreasonable and irresponsible demands based on a laundry list of blue sky campaign promises? 		Because he is stroking and playing his base! His only slim hope of staying out of or delaying prison is to get re-elected!

We are all damaged when incorrect information is disseminated by our word of mouth all the way to prime time news broadcasts. Misinformation can become ‚Äòtruth or fact‚Äô when it isn‚Äôt objectively challenged. 	Media make a point of real-time or on screen correcting ‚Äòfake news‚Äô now.
If all of us, but especially the nation‚Äôs media, stopped broadcasting, live and recorded, information that wasn‚Äôt backed up with facts at the same time, it would stop. 	If it isn‚Äôt fact checked, don‚Äôt air it. Tape or delay live events, require or provide objective facts on screen
What can we do about @realDonaldTrump, the @GOP or anyone making statements that are flatly false, totally misleading, completely out of context or 100% made up? 		For all of us, but especially the media, STOP airing it if it isn‚Äôt accompanied with backup FACTS. Demand FACTS, NOW

Fixing causes of our problems instead of wasting time on symptoms of those problems isn‚Äôt hard once identified. The largest bottlenecks in the system are the vested interests desire for profits, status quo, acceptance, apathy, ignorance and lack of general critical thinking! SAD!
Why don‚Äôt these problems get fixed?		-we don‚Äôt find and work on the causes of the problem to relieve, eliminate, control, eradicate, minimize or make them irrelevant. 	-we spend most of our resources and energy on ‚Äòsymptoms‚Äô of our problems. Mopping won‚Äôt stop overflowing sink!
So, have you thought about and dug up the base causality of America‚Äôs big problems? Wondered why they don‚Äôt get checked off the todo lists? All our big problems can be reduced down to two things:	-Religion	2900 religions, all by definition, the only allowable	-Greed	Money first
So why aren‚Äôt those in power and position doing more to move @realDonaldTrump out of the center of our government‚Äôs concentric circles of command and control?

But, @VP has his own agenda. We don‚Äôt see him trying to publicly adjust the Donald‚Äôs policy. He wants him to drive off a cliff so he can bring in his own pile of religious darkness to force feed the country. He supports Trump in a loose neutral way that doesn‚Äôt taint him much.

So think about it. How would Washington, Lincoln, Teddy R, Franklin R, Clinton, Kennedy, Obama, Adams, the other Adams, Grant, Carter, Reagan, Jefferson, Wilson, Truman, Eisenhower vote today? How happy would any of our past presidents be with the the 2 parties today? Not happy!

Lies4	Crime is not increasing.	Trump has not started building his wall. Nor is Mexico paying for his nonexistent wall.	Trump‚Äôs various health care plans did not protect people with pre-existing conditions.	The Veterans Choice Act was signed into law by President Obama in 2014.
Lies3	The entire defense industry only employs about 300,000 people in the first place, and Saudi Arabia is not that big a customer.	There‚Äôs no evidence that the caravan of migrants walking north from Guatemala includes any Middle Eastern terrorists.
Lies2	We do not have a $110 billion deal to supply arms to Saudi Arabia. We don‚Äôt really have any kind of deal at all, let alone one of that size.	Selling arms to Saudi Arabia, in whatever quantities, will not generate 500,000 jobs. Or 600,000 jobs. Or 1 million jobs.

Well now! All you cretins out there that voted for Donald J. Trump! Are you very happy for the all non-existant research and vetting you didn‚Äôt do with the most corrupt person to cross into Washington DC territory? From a young teen to now, there is nothing he hasn‚Äôt done!
The USA is exhibiting the same behavior and symptoms of the great civilizations of the past! The acceptance as ordinary, those activities like lying, cheating, fraud, decadence, criminal activity, self dealing, self interest and social apathy. Welcome to this wide road.
This whole process and procedure requires gas masks to get anywhere near it! Why is the world laughing at the USA? Because they have become a kindergarten recess playground fighting over one kickball! Total loss of reason to be focus for years!And this is being taken as weakness!
OH MY DEITY! OUR ENTIRE GOVERNMENT HAS LOST ALL CREDIBILITY! THIS ENTIRE SET IS NOT WORKING FOR US! THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEMSELVES AND EACH OTHER, COMPLETELY LOSING SIGHT OF WHAT AND WHY THE ARE THERE! A TWO PARTY SYSTEM IS SO FULL OF FLAWS IT NEEDS TO CHANGE.  SO USELESS!
