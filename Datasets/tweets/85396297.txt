During #WomensHistoryMonth we’ll be sharing stories of eastern CT women who broke barriers &amp; altered the course of history for our state &amp; country. Recognizing the feats of these history makers is a critical step as we continue our work to achieve true equality, and fairness.
Yesterday marked the start of #WomensHistoryMonth, a month dedicated to celebrating the innovative, hardworking and glass ceiling-shattering women throughout history. https://t.co/OMDyb7QdWY
@Momsdemand’s advocacy is a painful, but important reminder that gun violence remains a national epidemic, and that we can no longer settle for thoughts &amp; prayers. House passage of 2 bills this week to expand #BackgroundChecks are a good first step. #HonorWithAction #HR8 #HR1112
I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from @MomsDemand Action of Southeastern CT today in my Norwich District office. This non-partisan, grassroots movement strives to educate communities on gun safety and #gunviolence prevention. https://t.co/IcOzYP0DlV
Reading and youth development go hand in hand, and I thank the teachers and faculty at the Early Learning Center for today’s outstanding event. #ReadAcrossAmerica
Great morning celebrating #ReadAcrossAmericaDay at Case Street Early Learning Center in Norwich &amp; reading #DrSeuss's "One Fish, Two Fish..." to a class of pre-K students. Now in its 22nd year, #ReadAcrossAmerica2019 is a reminder of the importance of encouraging our youth to read https://t.co/rdkWUnAZHz
On Tuesday this week the @EdLaborCmte reported out the Rebuild America's Schools Act,which included a section I authored to offset the cost of repairing/reconstructing schools impacted by crumbling foundations--big win for communities harmed in this crisis.https://t.co/c3dUOG4jXW
Enjoyed meeting w/ members &amp; cadets of the @CivilAirPatrol who are in Washington today for their annual legislative fly-in to discuss priorities &amp; goals regarding their primary missions of emergency services, aerospace education &amp; cadet programs. Grateful for their service to CT. https://t.co/wirBX0TN9H
Great to meet the new director of government relations at @GDMS, Betsy Schmid, this morning, and to discuss the upcoming priorities for @GDElectricBoat and southeastern Connecticut in the new Congress.
Congress has a duty to protect the safety of the American people, and it is our job to ensure that these powerful weapons don’t fall into the wrong hands because of a flawed system. #HR1112 #HonorWithAction
Glad the House passed #HR1112 today, a gun violence prevention bill that would close the #CharlestonLoophole by extending the review period for background checks to 10 days, giving the FBI time to conduct thorough #backgroundchecks in each individual case https://t.co/ke7wBnIMoq
Nearly 3 years after joining @RepJohnLarson’s sit-in to demand action on #GunViolence legislation, we finally got the vote we were seeking. Proud to help pass #HR8 to close the loophole &amp; expand #BackgroundChecks.Great day for our country &amp; for Connecticut.https://t.co/uwkHdGeOhh
Healthcare &amp; social service workers face some of the highest risk of violence at work.

In passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct out of committee, we are one step closer to closing the #GenderWageGap. In CT, women make 79 cents for every $1 made by their male counterparts. We must end this disparity, which is why I am an original cosponsor of this bill.
Pleased that the @EdLaborCmte reported out the #RebuildAmericasSchools Act, a school infrastructure bill that includes my provisions to provide federal assistance to public schools facing the cost of repairing or rebuilding schools w/ #crumblingfoundations https://t.co/xYQYCCmEnt
I strongly oppose @POTUS’s diversion of military funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, which is why I’ve joined my colleagues in the House in co-sponsoring a joint resolution to block this misuse of funds that will harm military readiness https://t.co/CWC21udb0j
A big thank you to all of the outstanding farms that took part in the event, as well as to the local community members who turned out to learn more about this important part of eastern Connecticut’s economy. https://t.co/QWeu9j13xV

With over 700 employees serving 30 eastern CT towns, CHR has been instrumental in facilitating the rehab of over 10s of 1000s of citizens dealing with substance abuse. I thank them for their passion and leadership in the field of social services &amp; I look forward to my next visit.
One of these new programs, COMPASS Home (Coordination of Medical, Psychiatric, Substance Abuse, and Social Services) was created to help individuals dealing with substance abuse and homelessness-- and assist them in finding permanent and stable housing.

As a co-sponsor of the #RaiseTheWage Act, I stand as a strong supporter of gradually raising the minimum wage to $15/hour over the course of the next 5 years, raising the income of nearly 40 million American workers, and helping ensure they can earn a livable wage. https://t.co/cHFnMLtpV3
It’s been 10 long years since Congress revisited the federal minimum wage, which now sits at a pitiful $7.25/hour. I was proud to join my colleagues at @EdLaborCmte’s first hearing on the issue in the new #Congress last week.  #Fightfor15

Recent events have left allies like Australia unsure of our commitment to our long standing alliances. That is why I helped lead a bipartisan letter of 21 members strongly affirming Congress’ continued commitment to the US-Australia alliance. https://t.co/h6vtENYD1t

As this case moves forward on appeal, please know that I will continue to fight back against attempts to roll back protections for people with pre-existing conditions and dismantle a system that has extended coverage to millions of Americans.
While I am deeply troubled by the Texas judge's decision in this case, the most important thing for #Connecticut residents to know is that this does not impact your ability to get covered or your protections under the law at this time.
This past weekend, a judge in Texas issued a misguided ruling against the #AffordableCareAct that creates new confusion and uncertainty. It is important to know that the law still stands, and CT residents still have time to sign up for health insurance through @AccessHealthCT.

With fluctuating energy costs and an increased focus on lowering carbon emissions, this compost aeration and heat recovery system pilot project is helping pave the way for dairy farm modernization and efficiency in #Connecticut.
This project is demonstrating an alternative to costlier energy installations at other farms in the region. Not only is this system generating energy that the farm uses for heated air and water , but it is also producing value-added compost faster than a traditional system. https://t.co/mszOTKDKnm
With the help of about $60,000 of state and federal investment, the farm was able to install a compost aeration and heat recovery system, which is the first of its kind in #Connecticut. The project was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy State Energy Program (SEP). https://t.co/zll7pxRExr

It is also essential that we work across the aisle to prevent additional tragedies due to the proliferation of gun violence in our country. Enough is enough.
It is more important than ever that those in positions of power speak out - &amp; make clear to the Jewish Community that these acts are not and will not be tolerated. Our Congress and those who hold the highest offices in our country must condemn conspiracy theories &amp; hate speech.

This clarification means that even if the net loss suffered by a homeowner exceeds their annual federal tax liability, they can carry forward that loss for up to 20 years and can carry back for two years.
The IRS clarification will allow homeowners to “carry forward” or “carry back” a net operating loss should their casualty loss exceed their income.

If Senate Republicans have any interest in finding out what happened to these women, they should immediately call for the FBI to investigate the allegations and determine the facts. #KavanaughConfirmation
It has been standard procedure for decades to refer any new allegations made against a Supreme Court nominee to the FBI for review. The refusal to request such a review in this instance is completely unprecedented.
The Senate should not make a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court until the very serious allegations being leveled against #JudgeKavanaugh are thoroughly investigated. This position is too important to be rushed while questions about his past linger.
While it is a hallmark of our court system that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, the Senate Judiciary committee is not a courtroom. As explained in this @WashingtonPost piece, a Supreme Court nomination hearing is more akin to a job interview. https://t.co/sUJkX5HGMe

#Studentloan debt continues to spiral out of control alongside the rising cost of a college degree. A new report by @TICAS_org  shows 57% of college seniors in CT are graduating in debt.

Yesterday, I hosted the first ever US-Australia trade summit alongside @CommerceGov, organized to connect eastern CT companies in the defense industrial base with opportunities within Australia’s shipbuilding &amp; aerospace sectors. https://t.co/hR1AIa8cP8
#WageDiscrimination hurts American women, families, &amp; our economy. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct, introduced by @rosadelauro, which builds upon the 1963 #EqualPayAct by closing the loopholes that have allowed wage discrimination to persist.
It is indisputable that every worker in our country deserves equal treatment and #equalpay, but the reality is that far too often in our country workers are not hired or paid less because of their gender.
I told @Bustle magazine what I’m doing about the #GenderPayGap. Here’s what I said: https://t.co/uAC8iztwZf
As co-chair of the Friends of Australia Caucus &amp; a senior member of @HASC_Democrats, it is privilege to strengthen ties between the U.S. and #Australia &amp; to build upon cooperation between major companies and the industrial supply chains in both countries. @AusintheUS #Mateship https://t.co/3uVLBhzGxy

By choosing to rescind the rule, @BetsyDeVosED is abdicating her duty to regulate colleges in the best interests of students and taxpayers. This move benefits no-one other than stakeholders and special interests aligned w/ predatory for-profit colleges ripping off students.
CT is home to 91 programs subject to the Gainful Employment Rule, serving over 18,000 students. Of these 91 programs, 17 are considered failing or risky because of their tendency to overload students with unmanageable debt levels relative to their earnings.
The Gainful Employment Rule requires colleges to report how successful their graduates are at obtaining a job in the student’s field of study. By this metric, colleges are graded on how well they are preparing students to enter the workforce.
I submitted a public comment yesterday pushing back on @BetsyDeVosED’s efforts undo the Obama-era Gainful Employment Rule that was intended to shut down the worst actors in the for-profit industry. https://t.co/C2DWP9OYsQ

Last week, the ITC voted to block all tariffs on Canadian newsprint, saving local newspapers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Newspapers are vital to a healthy democracy, and I applaud the ITC for its decision to block this outlandishly unfair tariff. https://t.co/cDB6uC1ukq
After meeting with local newspaper publishers from across our state and region, I led a delegation letter to the ITC opposing @POTUS’s proposed newsprint tariffs that would drastically drive up costs for local papers across the US and limit their ability to report the news.
This summer, I joined @edworkforcedems in introducing the #AimHigherAct, which would provide every American student with the opportunity to earn a debt-free degree by increasing federal student aid &amp; by incentivizing states to reinvest in public universities.

When appointing a #SCOTUS judge, it is critical that the decision makers posses a comprehensive understanding of the nominee’s history. With 96% of Kavanaugh’s records being withheld, it is impossible to see the full picture, and irresponsible to hold a confirmation hearing.
About 78% of graduates have no prior manufacturing experience - demonstrating the powerful and life changing impact the pipeline has on individuals and our region’s economic growth.

Forcing our military to choose to use or not to use their family benefits in a timed countdown fashion is unjust and it should be their right to use those benefits however and whenever they see fit.
This order undermines the spirit of the Post-9/11 GI Bill and is a slap in the face to those who have dedicated years to serving our country. I organized 83 of my colleagues in the House and sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis to oppose this change in the GI Bill.

Those as young as 8 are eligible for the camp and there is no age limit so campers can attend into adulthood. https://t.co/g01BlTBsfF
Our last stop was with Eddie Carroll, CEO of the Student Art Marketplace. The online marketplace and digital portfolio founded by #millennials demonstrate the evolution of art &amp; deflects physical barriers to allow artists to showcase their work for sale to anywhere in the world. https://t.co/ewfCI58kC9
We then visited Art and Soul Creative Counseling in #Madison and met with owner Briana Benn-Mirandi, who utilizes art not only for expression but for helping and engaging folks through therapeutic recreation. Her services include teletherapy, crafting lessons, and psychotherapy. https://t.co/prPsbQnAwO
Today I joined the Shoreline Arts Alliance Director Eric Dillner to visit arts organizations in East Haddam &amp; Madison. We began at iPark, a nonprofit that offers artists a lab to develop their skills in a variety of styles ranging from music comp/sound art to creative writing. https://t.co/yMBTcyWpBM
New deliveries of eastern Connecticut wood have been suspended and Hull’s has thus been forced to reduce workforce hours. Lobsters, lumber, dairy and small manufacturing are taking it on the chin with no light at the end of the tunnel.
Hull has been doing its part to help reduce America’s trade deficit with China, however, all of that came to a grinding halt over the past few weeks due to China implementing new barriers for sale into the country in response to the Trump administration’s latest round of tariffs.
This past Friday I visited a long-established business in our region, Hull Lumber in Pomfret, that has been blindsided by the escalating trade war with China. https://t.co/vJDSWxkgqq
.@POTUS Trump’s Dept. of Education issued a Friday night “dump” to unleash junk degrees on taxpayers and unsuspecting students. Pure waste. https://t.co/pMJjFiv3Cm
Had a chance to visit and receive an update from @CTHealth this morning on the organization’s efforts to improving health outcomes in #Connecticut and the importance of #Medicaid in Connecticut. Thank you to CEO Patricia Baker, and VP Paul Mounds Jr for a great meeting.
The grant shows that the @USDOT recognizes the Cross Sound Ferry as an integral part of our regional transportation network. I will continue to work with Cross Sound Ferry &amp; regional leaders to further build upon this vital economic link between Eastern #CT and Long  Island.
Pleased that the Maritime Admin has awarded 500k to the Cross Sound Ferry for improvements after I sent a support letter this year. This award comes at a crucial time for the very popular Ferry &amp; the funding will be used to improve passenger experiences.	https://t.co/lnZmayG6HZ
We ended our farm tour with a visit to Lapsley Orchard, a diversified fruit and vegetable agricultural site. This 30+ year old orchard has expanded operations to include a community-supported agriculture and agri-tourism. #supportourfarmers https://t.co/h3el0wDZZl
I then visited Hull forest products in #Pomfret, a 3rd generation family run sawmill and woodland management service where I received updates on how Trump Tariffs are already taking a toll. https://t.co/8is8lLsCPI
Today I joined the #Connecticut Farm Bureau President Don Tuller and Executive Director Bryan Hurlburt for a farm tour throughout northeastern Connecticut. We began at Woodstock Sustainable Farms, a farm focused on regionalizing food systems and shortening food supply chains. https://t.co/dMnV29MkCu
Unfortunately nuclear submarines don’t run on delicious Connecticut #maplesyrup… but the USS Vermont’s sailors are big fans! @PeterWelch https://t.co/InkINhm1yw
My condolences to the families of 3 CT #WW2 vets who died in July. Many of those who fought to protect our country and freedoms in the Pacific &amp; in Europe during WW2 are well into their 90s &amp; we must honor these brave soldiers while they are with us. 	 	https://t.co/LGEwEKCbCo
Received a visit in my district office today from local hero and vet Gerry Wright. I applaud Gerry in his efforts to fight for #vets suffering from #AgentOrange &amp; I'm happy to be working with him to pass my new bill to get these vets the medical coverage &amp; benefits they deserve. https://t.co/k8x4T4BwgV
WBDC plays a critical role in our economy through development programs, training, access to capital, &amp; networking and the citizens of the 2nd district look forward to utilizing resources of the WBDC in empowering our women and granting them new avenues to entrepreneurial success. https://t.co/s1Vq5sansw
Yesterday, I was honored to join the opening of eastern CT’s 1st Women's Business Development Council center in southeastern Connecticut. The new center is supported by a $75,000 federal grant from the Small Business Administration that I strongly advocated for on WBDC’s behalf. https://t.co/tbCZq2Qyhw

Today on August 7th, we commemorate the day 236 years ago that General George Washington established the military’s #PurpleHeart medal. This decoration honors those who selflessly place their lives in danger to protect and serve our nation. #thankyouforyourservice
That time restriction alone blocks many who suffer from AO from receiving coverage. Some dont see symptoms for years after exposure. My bill, the AO Exposure Fairness Act, cuts the time restrictions for symptom reporting. I applaud Gerry and other vets for fighting for their own.
Regulations governing who can obtain coverage for #AgentOrange exposure are insufficient in granting vets the coverage they need. The law allows medical coverage for only 2 diseases due to AO and restricts reporting of symptoms to 1 year after a vet's last service date.
Proud to represent Vet Gerry Wright in the fight to obtain benefits for 1000s of vets who now suffer from exposure to #AgentOrange during Vietnam. He rode more than 10,000 miles on his motorcycle in 6 weeks to raise awareness about illnesses due to AO		https://t.co/hshPkJXPdx
Yesterday, with CT VA Commissioner Tom Saadi, my office held a #veterans advisory board meeting. We covered several topics including my letter signed by 83 members of Congress calling on the DOD to abandon plans to restrict vets’ abilities to transfer Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits. https://t.co/SRWZlTavcc

On this day 60 years ago, the USS Nautilus became the first submarine to complete an undersea voyage to the North Pole. Traveling beneath 1000 miles of Arctic ice, this milestone demonstrated the ingenuity of our great @USNavy to the rest of the world.	https://t.co/l7Cse0kgJF
As the Ranking Member of the Sea Power subcommittee, I applaud @USNavy for giving this key maintenance availability to Electric Boat. This all results in keeping key jobs and skills in the #Groton shipyard as we prepare for a surge in submarine construction work.
The newest Virginia-class fast-attack subs, the USS Indiana will be making Groton its home this fall. The sub will be coming to @GDElectricBoat for “post shakedown maintenance” that will keep 250-300 jobs in the shipyard &amp; will prevent projected layoffs.	https://t.co/gjx21ubHnx

While the @HouseGOP has moved to cut funding for election security, this should serve as a wake-up call and Congress should immediately move to appropriate any additional funding necessary to shore up our election systems to protect our democracy.
We must make it clear to foreign advisories that interference in our system of free and fair elections will be regarded as an attack on the United States that will be met with a decisive and proportionate response.
The revelation by Facebook yesterday that it appears Russia is once again attempting to meddle in our upcoming elections is incredibly disturbing and should be met with immediate condemnation by our entire government. 	https://t.co/AkJXcrttzu
Aside from these 3D guns being undetectable by metal detectors, they offer criminal elements throughout the globe easy access to download and build weapons they otherwise might not have access to. 	https://t.co/jec4ZWjfzS
In lieu of the State Department’s decision to allow a gun designer to make downloadable blueprints for 3D printed guns readily available, #Connecticut will join more than 20 other states in filing a lawsuit to fight this egregious choice by the Trump adminstration.
With new #Medicare cards being delivered in CT, be advised that if you receive calls from someone claiming to be Medicare asking for your personal info for a “new card”—it's a scam! Cards can take at least a month to arrive, but Medicare will NEVER call asking for info or money.

This order from the Trump administration undermines the spirit of the Post-9/11 GI Bill. As a member of the @HASCDemocrats, I helped pass the original Post-9/11 GI Bill during my first term in Congress to thank service members who accepted the call to duty in the wake of 9/11.
I organized 83 colleagues from both sides of the aisle to urge Def Sec Jim Mattis to reverse a Trump policy that would prevent military members with over 16 years of service from transferring their Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits to family members. https://t.co/hzUfCtjzFj

I profoundly agree with @IAVA that we must #DefendTheGIBill and stand up for the promises made to our troops. Taking away a valued benefit from some of our most dedicated and seasoned service members would be an enormous mistake; bad for military families, bad for our military.
The @DeptofDefense’s decision to end the transferability of benefits for service members who have served 16 years or longer breaks the Post 9/11 GI Bill’s promise made to those who have dedicated their careers to our military.

This new restriction backs away from the promise of the Post-911 GI Bill by preventing service members who have served 16 years or more from transferring their education benefits to their spouses or children, taking direct aim at American military families. @DeptofDefense

The story of the iconic Tiffany Farms underscores the enormous challenges that dairy farmers in our state and across the country continue to face. More than 90% of US #dairyfarms have shut down since 1970 due to low milk prices and industry restructuring. https://t.co/HSMVesI8Wd
Dillon &amp; Johnstone are 2 of the many #veterans that will benefit if my Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, passed out the House last month, is signed into law. I urge the Senate to pass this bill so that our #BlueWater vets can finally access the benefits they have earned
Great article that sheds light to the reality so many Blue Water @USNavy Vietnam #veterans have faced for decades. Vets like Paul Dillon &amp; Bill Johnstone served their country honorably, &amp; both are struggling with the effects of exposure to Agent Orange https://t.co/D7jfWabGFn
#AgentOrange didn't discriminate between veterans who served on the ground in #Vietnam &amp; those who served offshore - &amp; neither should we when it comes to vets getting medical coverage. I'm proud to stand with vets and support final passage of the #BlueWaterNavyVietnamVetsAct
Following the passage of my landmark Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act in the House of Representatives last week, my office had the opportunity to arrange a productive round-table meeting with local Blue Water Navy #veterans at my Norwich office yesterday. https://t.co/GMLD8TPSPH

Let’s protect consumers, let’s protect small businesses, and let’s protect equal access to the internet by restoring net neutrality.
Having fought for our freedoms overseas, these #veterans see the repeal of #NetNeutrality as an obstruction to the basic freedom that all Americans deserve. I also support restoring net neutrality through CRA and I have signed onto a discharge petition to bring it to the floor.
It's only been 24 days since the repeal of #NetNeutrality and we are continuing to see the backlash reverberate across the country. In a letter to Congress, over 1000 veterans are advocating for the restoration of net neutrality via a CRA resolution. https://t.co/3ekqtEt2as

I have been advocating for the state to review co-locating the state police range at the Connecticut National Guard Range in East Haven that I recently helped secure $14 million in federal funding to upgrade.
After seeing the obvious high-costs and environmental damage associated with building a new facility there, it reinforced my long-held belief that the state should suspend the gun range project and take a fresh look at the other options.
Today I joined residents on a visit the Pachaug Forest, Connecticut’s largest state forest, to view the site that is being proposed to build a massive new gun range. https://t.co/o5Lzkuj4kU
The Recovery Coach model connects patients with addiction recovery resources following a visit to the emergency room, and serves as an example of a pragmatic, yet compassionate approach to combating the grip the #opioidepidemic has on our communities.

This bill addresses both issues of insufficient numbers of pediatric specialists &amp; the staggering #studentdebt many med school grads face by providing a student loan repayment program that incentivizes recent med school grads pursuing specialties to work in underserved areas.
Average wait times to receive specialized care can exceed 29 weeks. For a family seeking care for their sick child, that wait feels like a lifetime. That is why, last year I introduced the Ensuring Children’s Access to Specialty Care Act of 2017. #SpeakNowForKids
The health &amp; care of children across the US deserves a spot at the forefront of our efforts in Congress. This week I had a chance to meet with reps from @ctchildrens and @YNHH to discuss their efforts to ensure all children have access to high-quality specialty care.
The Senate GOP rule to refrain from voting on an open @SCOTUS seat during an election year should apply in all cases of a vacancy on the high court, not just when it’s convenient for the majority party.
Following the announcement of Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement from @SCOTUS, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to stand by the “McConnell rule” and hold off on voting for any nominee until after the election and the new Congress is seated in January.
Turning our back on the Americans most in need for accessible and affordable care is inhumane, and rolls back years of progress and advancement in our healthcare system. #ProtectOurCare
The @POTUS efforts to strike down #ACA protections for pre-existing conditions opens the door for insurance companies to discriminate against the 130 million Americans with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, mental health or addiction.
Great to meet with Gardner family from #Norwich, here in DC with @YNHH for the @hospitals4kids Family Advocacy Day. Their family, along with dozens of others from across the country, are here to share their stories and voice their advocacy for children’s health #SpeakNowForKids https://t.co/VC9gOh95xi
All American workers, whether they belong to a #union or not see the gains when collective bargaining yields higher pay and improved benefits. Rebuilding unions is critical to rebuilding the middle class. #Janus sets us back but workers will prevail.
The #Janus decision by the @SCOTUS will decimate public employee unions and overturns 40 years of established precedent. This is just another #GOP attack on middle-class families and the standard of living that unions once helped secure.
Great news from @UConn &amp; @Interior with the recently announced $40K in federal funding for a maritime heritage trail. This CT Blue Trail will be a fantastic opportunity to engage and connect residents with the maritime community of eastern CT. https://t.co/01FPpggRsg
I am a proud cosponsor of the #EqualityAct, which would expand current antidiscrimination laws to include sexual orientation &amp; gender identity. #LGBTQ Americans deserve equal rights, and the equal protections against unlawful discrimination.
Three years ago, @SCOTUS established marriage equality as the law of the land and we should be proud of how far #LGBTQ rights have come. However, during #PrideMonth we must also recognize that progress remains to be made before we achieve full #EqualityForAll. https://t.co/krGPDxhH4R

This week marks the 80th anniversary of the #FairLaborStandardsAct, a landmark piece of legislation that laid the groundwork for the success and protection of America’s workers.
I am proud to have worked on a bipartisan basis to finally get this long-overdue legislation passed in the House. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will follow suit &amp; pass the bill without delay so that our #BlueWater vets can finally receive the care &amp; recognition they deserve
Yesterday, the House passed the bipartisan #BlueWater Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, a bill I introduced that expands benefits for thousands of “blue water” @USNavy veterans living with chronic health conditions attributed to #AgentOrange exposure during the Vietnam War. https://t.co/lmNEMhcVbf
The improvisational, “on the fly” decision making by @POTUS has caused real harm to children and their families. These detained migrants, the staff, patrol agents at our border, and our country deserve better from our President.
My colleagues and I visited #McAllen &amp; #LosFresnos, TX to witness firsthand the fallout from the #ZeroTolerancePolicy initiated by @POTUS last April.

Home to @SUBASE_NLON, #MemorialDay carries special meaning for Southeastern CT. Following #PearlHarbor, @USNavy submarine force was forced to bear the weight of battle in the Pacific during WWII.
Wishing the families across eastern Connecticut a safe and enjoyable #MemorialDay2018. I hope this day will serve as a solemn and poignant reminder to the American people of the sacrifice made by our fallen members of the Armed Forces and their families. https://t.co/o37Itfvbx2
An inspiring story about a talented Fitch High School grad doing great things for others. @thedayct https://t.co/lR30ULSdg2
The @usedgov should be protecting students, not prying into their Social Security numbers to coddle ripoff schools like Corinthian College. 	https://t.co/JRQHw5405h
A special thank you to @Resident_News for helping me share a special message with Southeastern CT residents this weekend. #MemorialDay2018 https://t.co/o37Itfvbx2
Look forward to seeing everyone around the district this weekend. #MemorialDayWeekend is about far more than just getting away and these community tributes to our fallen soldiers are a great opportunity to honor those that made the ultimate sacrifice. https://t.co/8dTrRyZRSY
Yesterday, the House passed the widely bipartisan #FY19NDAA that restores readiness in our armed forces and authorizes an addition $1 billion in funding to set our sub manufactures like @GDElectricBoat on the path to building 3 subs per year in 2022 &amp; 2023	https://t.co/j46xT8yrcg
I also had the chance to visit @opportunitywrks , a non-profit that works to empower and create job opportunity for people with disabilities. Impressive and important work underway here in downtown #Rockville. https://t.co/otzPDvJoWm
Great day visiting a number of #Rockville small businesses. On our 1st stop, I had the chance to tour @SwissCleaners, a 4th-generation family-owned business that employs 105 workers across CT. While mostly known for dry cleaning, 75% of their business consists of uniform services https://t.co/yEGAyThm6i
#FY19NDAA also includes a broad array of important reforms to improve our military’s effectiveness &amp; readiness through funding for modernizing new &amp; existing programs, improving oversight of opioid use in the military &amp; finally, giving our servicemembers a well deserved pay raise
This morning, the House passed the 2019 NDAA which included an additional $1 billion to set @GDElectricBoat on the path toward building three submarines per year in 2022 and 2023, representing a major development for our region &amp; nation. https://t.co/M6GA780z8k
Honored to receive the @aafp Congressional Champion of Family Medicine Award alongside Maria Costigan, a stellar &amp; hardworking legislative staffer in my DC office.

This week we are marking #NationalMaritimeDay, serving as an opportunity to recognize one of our nation’s most important industries. Eastern CT is home to one of the country’s strongest maritime economies. A special thanks to our region’s hardworking maritime industry workers.
After being told “women don’t do that”, Tobias went on to shatter expectations, creating an opportunity future @USNavy women could pursue.

“Why don’t we do a moment of action? Why don’t we do a moment of change?” Last night, @kelly_clarkson opted to forgo a moment of silence in favor of a call to action. The time for silence and prayer is long past, and change is long overdue. #SantaFe https://t.co/QuXQsFGclJ
All over our region, young people are earning their degrees and entering the workforce. Too many of them are doing so with overwhelming #studentdebt. It’s well past time for Congress to address the issue of college affordability.
Approximately 2/3 of #SNAP recipients are children, elderly or disabled. Under the #GOPFarmBill, an estimated 2 million Americans would lose these critical benefits, and 265,000 low income children would lose their free school lunches.
The long tradition of bipartisan support for the #FarmBill came to a screeching halt when the @HouseGOP proposed a $9.2 billion cut to #SNAP.
Last week, the #GOPFarmBill failed in the House after facing bipartisan opposition. For decades, the #FarmBill, which provides aid for our nation’s farmers and funds nutrition assistance for low income families through #SNAP, has enjoyed strong bipartisan support.

Today, I signed a discharge petition to force a vote on a #CRA resolution that would restore #netneutrality. This bill is ripe and ready for a vote. Let’s protect consumers, let’s protect #smallbusiness, and let’s protect equal access to the internet by restoring #netneutrality
This evening, I joined the bipartisan effort to force a vote on #DACA in the House. It's been nearly five months since @SpeakerRyan promised #dreamers a vote and has since done nothing. Now, R’s and D’s together are taking matters into our own hands, filing a discharge petition.
Today is the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia. The #LGBTI community in our state, country, and all over the world deserve equality, and to be treated with dignity. Anything less is simply unjust. #IDAHOT
Mueller’s investigation is no ‘witch hunt’, in fact, it is deadly serious and I am incredibly grateful that we have a true American hero leading this effort. I have no doubt that Mueller will see this inquiry to its conclusion, wherever that may lead him. #LetMuellerWork

Usually, seniors admitted for a hospital stay of 3 days or longer receive full coverage for skilled nursing care after being discharged, however a nuance in the paperwork sometimes leaves these seniors with tens and thousands in unexpected medical bills.
Important meeting this afternoon with the #ObservationStayCoalition to discuss the ongoing effort to address the serious issue of seniors being confronted with astronomical medical bills for skilled nursing care
Happy to welcome @ctrealtors and @EasternCTAOR this afternoon for their annual #NARLegislative visit to discuss issues facing the real estate market in our region including crumbling foundations. Always a pleasure to host our region’s realtors in Washington. https://t.co/U5SNdc1rSe

Katherine Kennedy has made it her life’s work to help families and veterans facing hardship. When she contacted my team in January, #TRICARE had stopped payments for her services because of an address change, but Katherine refused to turn veterans away.
Last week, the House passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, a bill I cosponsored that will lift the burden of storing nuclear waste from local communities like #HaddamNeck who, for over 20 yrs, have been unfairly saddled with the responsibility. https://t.co/XtwpV4ZuVU
The critical role that nurses play in our healthcare system can not be overstated. They are healthcare professionals, patient advocates, and a support system all at once. A big thank you to our region’s wonderful nurses for the difference they make. #NurseAppreciationWeek

Next week, the Senate will vote to save #netneutrality rules that were repealed by the @FCC last year. The repeal of these rules, which were created to balance open access to the internet &amp; low cost to consumers, was a deeply misguided undertaking to fulfill political promises.
Sad news today of Eunice Groark’s passing. She served the state as LG with intelligence and dignity. A true role model of public service in a divided time

I promise to continue to build upon Congressman Brandagee’s legacy by supporting @SUBASE_NLON at every opportunity so it can continue to carry out its mission supporting the national defense of the United States.
The selection of eastern CT for the original naval installation was the result of an effort by one of my predecessors, Congressman Augustus Brandagee, who inserted language into an appropriations measure to fund the necessary purchase of land from CT &amp; #NewLondon.
Today marks the 150th anniversary of the creation of the @USNavy installation that would become @SUBASE_NLON. On April 11, 1868, CT and #NewLondon conveyed a deed of gift to the @USNavy that would become home to the “first and finest” submarine base. https://t.co/biFOMvuFfD

Happy to announce that CT’s Women’s Business Center (WBC) will receive a $75,000 grant to expand operations to southeastern #CT. WBC has an impressive record of contributing to CT’s economic vitality, and investment in these organizations is an investment in our communities.
The Job center’s programs will help train and develop individuals in in the health care and “manufacturing pipeline” labor pool, and will build on CWP’s work with @AsnuntuckCC In training the next generation of skilled workers.
This center would not have been possible without federal funding provided by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act which I helped pass through committee and the #HouseofRepresentatives in July 2014.
As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I was excited to attend an open house of the NEW Enfield Job Center at  @AsnuntuckCC yesterday.

April is #nationalautismawarenessmonth This month allows us to spread awareness and shed light on a growing condition affecting millions of families in our country.
In 2017, my office returned over $622,000 to #veterans like Ernie through our casework program. There may be other veterans in our region who need help with obtaining benefits.

The @EPA decision to roll back vehicle emission standards is irresponsible and disregards the preponderance of scientific data indicating that carbon pollution is driving global #climatechange. Reducing pollution is vital to protecting our health and preserving our environment.
I will continue to urge my colleagues in #congress to work together to acquire continued funding for agencies like the NIH—one of the most important parts of a healthy lifestyle is staying up to date and informed on new developments in public health and medical research.
The theme of #nationalpublichealthweek this year is #healtiestnation2030. With the recent passing of the bi-partisan omnibus deal, we were able to grant a $3 billion increase to the National Institutes of Health—which does vital work in biomedical and public health research.

Only a few months into the new #GOPTaxLaw, companies have announced $200 billion in stock buyback plans, with more to come. The proof is in the pudding. This tax law was not designed to benefit America’s #middleclass families. https://t.co/sGCp9ZYmSu
The #GOPTaxLaw’s massive tax cuts for corporations was sold to the American public as a way to create jobs and increase wages, promising #middleclass families a stronger economy to make up for an astounding trillion dollar deficit increase.

I look forward to working with my colleagues to reinstate the Obama-era policy of #NetNeutrality that was working for the American people and small businesses – the real drivers of the internet economy.
In the past few months, the American public has demonstrated overwhelming support for Title II #NetNeutrality rules that protect our open internet. Today, Trump’s @FCC voted to repeal these protections, demonstrating a blatant disregard for the voice of the American people.
It’s shocking that this many years later, Congress has yet to meaningfully address the threat of #gunviolence in our nation. Since 2012, there have been 170K gun deaths in the US, 1700 mass shootings, 40 moments of silence, and 0 commonsense gun laws passed by Congress.
Today marks 5 years since the #SandyHook shooting, a senseless attack that robbed 20 children and 6 educators of their lives. The grief endured by the families and community in Newtown is unfathomable, and that pain is dishonored through inaction. #HonorWithAction

@HouseGOP Unfortunately, both of my #HEA amendments to save the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and allow students to refinance high-interest loans were defeated. With the cost of a college degree soaring, we should be working feverishly to make #HigherEd more affordable – not less
The @HouseGOP #PROSPERAct will gut the Higher Education Act by limiting access to affordable student loan repayment programs and eliminating student loan forgiveness for public servants like teachers and firefighters.

Today, I introduced two amendments to #HEA that would reverse some of the damage done by @HouseGOP #HigherEd bill. The first would restore Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that lends financial relief to qualified graduates after 10 years of public service.

The fact that @StateDept had to preemptively issue a travel advisory for U.S. citizens and @deptofdefense put military on alert prior to @POTUS’s announcement on #Israel shows how reckless and uncalculated a move this was.
The status of Jerusalem is an issue that should be resolved between #Israelis and #Palestinians. This move by @POTUS is needlessly provocative and threatens America’s leadership role in the peace process.
This imposition on state law enforcement leaves police officers vulnerable to prosecution, and compromises their ability to protect our communities. #StopCCR
Today, the House votes on the #HR38 bill that would undercut the rights of states like CT to enforce their individual gun laws, allowing for a transfer of these laws across state lines.
As carpenters often say: ‘measure twice, cut once.’ Unfortunately, the #GOP tax plan grossly breaks that wise advice https://t.co/gH81NaOxo5
A recent editorial from the @bangordailynews reprinted in @TheDay highlights some of the ways corporations could take advantage of an unprotected internet, underscoring the importance of #netneutrality. https://t.co/xsY39M86sx
I will continue to oppose any version of the #GOPTaxBill that benefits wealthy Americans and corporations at the expense of hardworking families. I am urging my @HouseGOP colleagues to reconsider the impact this rewrite will have on the American middle class.
#SupremeCourt heard arguments in the #MasterpieceCakeshop case today after a bakery refused service to a same-sex couple. I signed this brief to the Court arguing anti-discrimination laws are about protecting everybody and businesses should be #OpentoAll  https://t.co/E9T2i5amrb
The Children’s Health Insurance Program (HUSKY B, or CHIP) grants healthcare to 17K CT children. 66 days since #CHIP funding ran out, yet Congress continues to stall reauthorization, endangering the healthcare for these thousands of kids in CT, and 9 million nationwide.
The #GOPTaxBill heads to conference committee this week, where the House and Senate version of the bills still need to be merged before passage. As written, this legislation stands to raise taxes for thousands of eastern CT taxpayers by eliminating state and local tax deductions.
#NetNeutrality rules exist to ensure that the internet remains an equal playing field for all users and businesses. The @FCC Chairman’s decision to repeal these protections will drive up costs, lending deep-pocketed corporations an unfair advantage over ordinary consumers. https://t.co/YqQUvQwVsY
@DeptVetAffairs Despite continued delay by @DeptVetAffairs on the Blue Water bill, I will continue to press this issue until these veterans receive the care they need and deserve.

I’m also backing a bill by @RepSpeier to implement more comprehensive reform to how harassment and assault allegations are treated through the Office of Compliance. The current process isn’t transparent or streamlined, and doesn’t lend the victim their due rights.

This afternoon, the House passed a bill requiring anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training for all members, staff, fellows and interns in the House of Representatives.

This #goptaxbill impacts 100% of Americans, yet we’ve had no hearings and we are voting on this bill through a closed process that limits debate and shuts down amendments like these. American people deserve better.
The final amendment would have extended the bipartisan mortgage debt forgiveness deduction that keeps homeowners from paying taxes on the losses they incur if they have to walk away from their homes. Blocked. https://t.co/un7qY6iPG6
A third amendment would have preserved the property casualty loss deduction that helps homeowners defray the cost of uninsured losses and repairs of their home. https://t.co/Ptvml78wU3
Another would have protected the graduate student tuition waiver. This bill would tax grad student tuition benefits that help keep students in school. Blocked. https://t.co/BFJU3qrsSu
One of my amendments would have repealed the so-called “Cadillac Tax,” which would hit middle class families who fight hard for their health benefits. Blocked. https://t.co/K0v1cWfEzT
