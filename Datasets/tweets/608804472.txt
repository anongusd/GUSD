I'd say, "Only in America" but similar moments happen in other countries too. There was something special about this moment: #Bush41's smile (we saw it thru the tinted windows), his instant connection w/ us (of all political persuasions), and his gracious, quiet power.
What struck me then, as it does now, is how genuinely happy #Bush41 was to see us, a smattering of young construction guys in John Deere caps, me in a @Cubs T, &amp; a fellow @UChicago undergrad, all smiling widely &amp; waving at our president, in what seemed like the middle of nowhere.
As the Bush family, friends, and our country lay President George H.W. Bush to rest this week I recall fondly a happenstance &amp; vigorous wave from #Bush41 as his motorcade (&amp; helos) whizzed by us on the outskirts of Lincoln, Neb. after one of his #ethanol speeches in 1988.
