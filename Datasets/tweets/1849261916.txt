President @realDonaldTrump is committed to keeping American citizens safe and I wholeheartedly support his efforts to secure our nation.
America is facing a crisis at the border and instead of working to protect those who elected us, my colleagues have decided to waste time on a purely political resolution.
Knowing full well this resolution has no chance of being signed into law, today my Democratic colleagues advanced another futile attempt to obstruct the President’s statutory authority and overturn his national emergency declaration.
Tune in! https://t.co/srvL5bXHbV
The gift of life is an inherent right bestowed on each and every human being at conception. As your Congressman, it's my responsibility to fight for Missouri values &amp; protect the most vulnerable among us. I'm encouraged by this pro-life shift in our nation https://t.co/7OUZY4vYVh
This President’s Day, we recognize those who have cultivated the country we know today. Each President is known for his strengths and weaknesses, wins and losses, yet each indelibly shaped the path of our nation. https://t.co/lcHjGRMwsj

"America was founded on liberty and independence - not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country." @realDonaldTrump #SOTU
"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God." @realDonaldTrump #SOTU
"Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe." @realDonaldTrump  #SOTU
"If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation...We must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad." @realDonaldTrump #SOTU

I support President Trump's mission to secure our border and keep our citizens safe, and I hope Democratic leaders can set aside partisan politics, show true leadership, and reopen the government.
Divided government can only work if both sides show a willingness to compromise and negotiate in good faith. @realDonaldTrump has shown he is willing to work with Congressional Democrats on their immigration priorities, even in the face of continued Democratic obstruction.

Along with my fellow Americans, I send my sincere condolences to the entire Bush family on this difficult day. We all gain some comfort in knowing he is now reunited with his beloved wife, First Lady Barbara Bush.
America has lost an honorable man who leaves a legacy of conservative leadership. President George H.W. Bush exemplified the Greatest Generation through his faithful commitment to our nation as a war hero, Congressman, Ambassador to the UN, Director of the CIA and President.
Proud of my friend @PatrickMcHenry who will lead the @FinancialCmte Republicans with distinction. https://t.co/QU7U1y3jrl

As a former examiner, I find it appalling that regulators would not only allow but encourage this irresponsible behavior. The intimidation tactics and implicit bias employed by these unelected bureaucrats stands in direct opposition to the important missions of the agencies.

For the first time in 32 years, #taxday is a day to celebrate! 		Out with the old, in with the new (simpler, fairer) tax code.
The #taxcutsandjobsact repeals Obamacare’s unpopular and ineffective individual mandate. You will no longer be forced to buy health insurance you don’t want, don’t need, or can’t afford. You have the FREEDOM to buy the health care plan that’s right for you.
The #taxcutsandjobsact will simplify taxes, with nearly 9 out of 10 Americans filing on a much simpler and more straightforward form.
The #taxcutsandjobsact DOUBLED the child tax credit to help families across the country. It also preserves the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and the Adoption tax credit.
The #taxcutsandjobsact nearly DOUBLED the standard deduction, protecting more of your paycheck from taxes and simplifying the filing process.
The #taxcutsandjobsact helps Americans keep more of their hard-earned money to save or spend as they see fit. An average family of four in Missouri-03 will see a tax savings of $2,055!
Missourians deserve better than a complicated and outdated tax code. Thankfully, we FIXED IT! Next year, hardworking families in Missouri and across the nation will find #taxday to be simpler and less time consuming. https://t.co/nvDrKxFvzK
