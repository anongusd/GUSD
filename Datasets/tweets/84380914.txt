MG Jim Martin is doing well, we appreciate your concern.
For a summary of #AirForce #2017Budget check out: https://t.co/yuLFjYBMHv
We are grateful for the temporary relief provided by the 2015 BBA but uncertainty looms as sequestration &amp; BCA budget caps return in FY18.
This year’s budget is based on a strategy that balances capability, capacity, and readiness across the full spectrum of operations
OCO funds MILCON airfield projects in AFRICOM and supports the ERI initiative
OCO funding is requested to replace almost 24,000 preferred munitions, totaling $716M
This year’s OCO request is $12.3B &amp; funds flying hrs, WSS, 8 RPA combat lines &amp; op expenses for 6 enduring CENTCOM locations
Since FY12, we deferred 75  F-35s…this equates to approximately 4 squadrons of capacity and capability needed for future high end threats
Delaying modernization has become a trend that allows our competitors to close the capability gap.
we were forced to delay five F-35s, some 4th generation modifications, and delay completion of the recapitalization effort of the C-130H
Unfortunately, in this budget, we had to sacrifice modernization for current readiness
Our FY17 procurement budget preserves our top modernization pgms, sustains space procurement strategy, invests in the nuclear enterprise
We increased funding by $1.6B from what we requested in FY16 in Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation
For our MILCON, we focus on new mission beddowns, Combatant Commander requirements and incr our investment in previously deferred projects
The FY17 Operation and Maintenance budget supports the full spectrum of operations as well as people and quality of life programs
We will grow the force to address key capability gaps in the nuclear enterprise, cyber, ISR, and maintenance career fields.
Facility requirements and installation support represent the remaining 8 percent of the total operating costs.
Flying hours, weapons system sustainment and missions executed at our Major Commands total ~38 percent of the funding.
Military and civilian pay make up 54 percent  of day-to-day operating costs
Of the 120.4 billion dollars,  approximately 76 billion dollars or 63 percent, supports day to day operations.
The Air Force blue budget for FY17 is ~120.4 billion dollars which is roughly 23 percent of the DoD’s 2017 budget
We will restore active duty endstrength to 317K; however, current demands indicate more growth is necessary
We continue to take risk in facility infrastructure, an action we’ve repeated since FY13’s sequestration; impacting both readiness &amp; QoL
Defer five F-35s, some 4th generation aircraft modifications, and delay the completion of our C-130H recapitalization effort
In FY17, to live within BBA limits, we fell short in three areas:  modernization, infrastructure, and people
Bottomline--the FY17 budget continues the recovery and gives us a larger and better equipped force.
FY17 Request: Includes a 1.6 percent pay raise for both military and civilians
FY17 Request: We stopped the downsizing in FY16 &amp; started restoring military endstrength in critical mission sets
FY17 Request: We’ll continue our efforts to build a new combat rescue helicopter, and will fund AF One recapitalization
FY17 Request: We’ll improve the RPA enterprise with military bonuses, adding enlisted pilots, and funding 60 ISR combat lines.
FY17 Request: And we’ll continue to advance investments in space and cyber
FY17 Request: We remain committed to strengthening our nuclear enterprise.
FY17 Request: Unfortunately, we had to defer five F-35s to live within BBA limits in FY17
FY17 Request: We  keep 2 of our top 3 modernization programs on track: the KC-46 and Long-Range Strike Bomber
FY17 Request: fund munitions to capacity to support current operations and will start to rebuild inventories
FY17 Request: Cont  investments in ranges, simulators, adv weapons schools &amp; ensure combat exercises
FY17 request: fund flying hours &amp; weapons system sustainment to near capacity.
FY17 request: Sustain force structure to support current ops and combatant commander needs
Our FY17 budget request is consistent with our FY16 plan.
BBA allows: stopped downsizing &amp; started rightsizing Total Force endstrength to cover key shortfalls include cyber, nuclear, mx &amp; RPA
BBA allows: preserve top modernization priorities (KC-46, F-35,and LRS-B) and further our investments in nuclear, space, and cyber.
BBA allows us to: fund readiness components at executable lvls, retain legacy force structure &amp; triple munitions compared to FY15
Right now, the avg age of our aircraft is over 27 yrs…in fact, 21 fleets qualify for antique license plates in the state of VA.
Then, we had approximately 8,600 aircraft, today we have approximately 5,500.
Back then, we had 946K Airmen, military and civilians, while today we have Total Force of 664K.
25 years ago, we had 134 combat-coded fighter squadrons.  TODAY we have 55.
It is important because that’s the Air Force most people know. The reality is we are not the same Air Force now as we were then.
25 years of continuous combat operations have taken their toll on our Airmen…their readiness and the equipment they operate
In 2015, our Airmen produced AMAZING RESULTS, which reflect a Total Force effort…active duty, guard, &amp; reserve Airmen…military &amp; civilian
Every yr, we use a deliberate process to “make every dollar count” b/c the 5 core missions, are ALL critical for the Jt Force &amp; our Nation
A strategic framework was used to balance capability, capacity, and readiness across the full spectrum of operations. #Budget2017

About a year ago, AF reactivated 69th Bomb Squad, helping balance workload between nuclear deterrents & conventional missions. #AirSpace2010
Since the transfer of missile forces, GSC has taken part in 10 search & rescue missions and been credited with 4 saves! #AirSpace2010
GSC's first major milestone came on Dec. 1, 2009, when it assumed responsibility for ICBM mission. #AirSpace2010
GSC has come a long way! Activated last year with less than 50 personnel aboard. Nearly 750 employees working at the HQ now. #AirSpace2010
At the Global Strike Command session, Gen Klotz says this year's presentations demonstrate renewed interest in nuclear mission.#AirSpace2010
Gen Thomas: "I am fairly convinced over the 30 months I've dealt with the labs, we don't have to do any testing at this time.” #AirSpace2010
Gen Thomas: “If we're going to ... shrink nuclear warfighting structure, everything we do has to be perfect." #AirSpace2010
Gen Chambers: AF’s #1 priority is strengthening the nuclear enterprise. "Nuclear experience is ... a precious commodity." #AirSpace2010
Gen Alston:"I'm very confident in...our people & the credibility that the deterrence function of our ICBM brings to our nation"#AirSpace2010
