Missing from this speech: a crude Bibi chart. Maybe next time #NetanyahuSpeech
Summary: Netanyahu presented no new evidence‚Äîno evidence at all, in fact‚Äîand said nothing new. Epitome of political gesture #NetanyahuSpeech
Netanyahu lives in a fantasy world, and our Congress are strolling along with him #NetanyahuSpeech
Netanyahu invokes the Holocaust. Was waiting for that one. #NetanyahuSpeech
Netanyahu wants Iran's nuclear infrastructure dismantled, zero enrichment, which is the same as saying no deal #NetanyahuSpeech
"This is a very bad deal. We're better off without it." Huge applause in chamber. Really, people? #NetanyahuSpeech
Spoiler alert: Netanyahu's idea of a better deal is no deal #NetanyahuSpeech
"If Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country." That goes both ways, Bibi. #NetanyahuSpeech
So far Netanyahu's demands for Iran have nothing to do with nukes, so nothing to do with negotiations. #NetanyahuSpeech
Iran doesn't have to "change for the better" not to develop nukes. It's not developing nukes, so no change is good #NetanyahuSpeech
A deal w/ 10 yr timeline that limits Iran's nuclear program lets world ensure it's peaceful. Bibi has no alt plan, only war #NetanyahuSpeech
Iran has not made a decision to develop a nuclear weapon. What evidence is there that they will change their mind? None. #NetanyahuSpeech
Netanyahu's been saying that Iran is "a year away" from a nuke since the early 90's‚Äîhis sense of time is not to be trusted #NetanyahuSpeech
Iran's nuclear program is under inspection by the IAEA. Israel's isn't. #NetanyahuSpeech
The US has made clear that they would be able to detect if Iran decided to develop nukes #NetanyahuSpeech
It was never a realistic expectation that Iran's nuclear infrastructure would be demolished #NetanyahuSpeech
Netanyahu equates Iran with ISIS, just like he equated Hamas with ISIS, and he equated Iraq with al Qaeda. #NetanyahuSpeech
Israel jails Palestinian journalists ‚Äî what freedom of the press? https://t.co/WaPAUfx3nR #NetanyahuSpeech
Israel is occupying millions of Palestinians, denied basic human rights, &amp; routinely bombed, made homeless, and jailed #NetanyahuSpeech
Iran has not had war of aggression since eighteenth century. Just in the past sixty years, Israel has been involved in many #NetanyahuSpeech
Netanyahu doesn't mention Israel actively pursued Iran as an ally until the early 1990's as part of the periphery doctrine #NetanyahuSpeech
No evidence that Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons. But Israel has nuclear weapons, and the US is only state to use 1 #NetanyahuSpeech
Many Israeli leaders say that Iran is not an existential threat to Israel http://t.co/Rp2aD19Zrn #NetanyahuSpeech
There is no evidence that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons. Even #Netanyahu's own intel says this. #NetanyahuSpeech
"Prez Obama, you were so supportive of us killing 500 kids in Gaza this summer. Why won't you let us do the same in #Iran?" #NetanyahuSpeech
"We appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel. But $3.1 billion a year garners you only so much gratitude." #NetanyahuSpeech

Israeli settlers in West Bank live in very close proximity to Palestinian villages. If security an issue, why are there settlers? #UNGA
If distance btw Palestinian areas &amp; Israeli ones is security issue, why are 500K Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank? #UNGA
#Netanyahu: "we are not occupiers of the Land of Israel". FYI watchers, "Land of Israel" includes, for Bibi, historic Palestine. #UNGA
Yeah, #Netanyahu, we can all join Israel in its water programs, like stealing Palestinian aquifers! #UNGA #UNGA2014
And #Netanyahu calls everyone an anti-semite. #UNGA
South African apartheid regime used same claim of being "singled out" as #Netanyahu is now. What does that tell you? #UNGA
Best thing about this speech: No one at #UNGA is buying #Netanyahu's bull. Claps are pitiful.
Over 2K dead in #Gaza this summer, vast majority civilians, 500+ children. How does this indicate a concern for civilian lives?
#Netanyahu, what about Israel using Palestinian children as human shields, as documented by international human rights groups? #UNGA
Does #Netanyahu really regret the 500+ dead #Gaza children? Because instead of regretting it he could have, oh, just not done it. #UNGA
No, #Netanyahu, your "fight" against Hamas is not OUR fight. #UNGA
The claps for dismantling #Iran's nuclear infrastructure were laughably weak, which is good news #UNGA #Netanyahy
#Netanyahu "Once Iran builds a bomb, all the charms, all the smiles will be gone." #UNGA
#Netanyahu: #Iran = #ISIS. Hamas = ISIS. Bibi formula is pretty much, "anyone we don't like" = ISIS #UNGA
#Netanyahu has mentioned crocodile tears, charm offensive. Just waiting for an awesome chart to call it classic Bibi #UNGA
#Netanyahu will never give up on the #Iran thing. Even tho UN Sec Council &amp; Iran working toward agreement, he'll keep railing on #UNGA
