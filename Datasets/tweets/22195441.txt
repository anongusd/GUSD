Tax debate/third reading begins...
ILLUSION 3: Taxes imposed on businesses will simply be absorbed.  While some portion may be, most will be passed through to all of us.
ILLUSION 2: $100,000 income family is a "high wage" earner.  Ask a husband & wife with 3 kids, a mortgage, and bills if they feel rich.
ILLUSION 1: Dems "focus" is on high wage earners/corporations, but the sales tax (largest % of the increase) impacts ALL strata of society.
NC Budget "UNSPUN": The latest budget has about as many illusions in it as a David Copperfield act.
Continuing resolution passes 102 to 5.  CR reducing spending and has no taxes.  Wonder why we had consensus?
Most Republicans will vote for the continuing resolution. It is unlikely the future budget will have the same fiscal discipline. #ConsNC
Charlotte may lose $3M they counted on when they passed their budget in June. They cut/didn't raise taxes--House dems could learn from that.

Gov. Purdue's suggestion?  Double the tax increase to $1.6 BILLION via nearly 40 new taxes.  Yeah, that should bring all parties together.
Each day the House & Senate delay a budget decision, nearly $60,000 is wasted. That's roughly 1 teacher & 1 teacher asst yearly salary lost.
