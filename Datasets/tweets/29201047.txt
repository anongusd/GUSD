Sadly, Berta’s case is not an anomaly; it is a symptom of a much larger system of corruption. To see that this corruption is alive and well, you only have to look to the recent arrest of 12 environmental activists in retaliation for their protests.
While seven men who helped orchestrate the murder were recently convicted, many Hondurans are still wondering if the senior government and business figures involved in this assassination will ever face justice.
Saturday is the 3-year anniversary of indigenous leader Berta Cáceres’ brutal murder. Berta was killed because of her efforts to stop construction of a controversial hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, which the Lenca people consider sacred.
The fight against Trump’s bogus “national emergency” declaration is moving to the Senate. Both sides need to come together to protect our country and our constitution from clear violations by the executive branch.

Put another way—at the same time as the Trump administration is inflicting trauma on families at our border who are fleeing persecution, it is undermining anti-corruption &amp; anti-poverty efforts in Central America, causing MORE families to flee. That’s the wrong path for America.
In Guatemala, we’ve seen President Morales take these cues from the Trump administration—that human rights &amp; civil rights &amp; anti-corruption projects are a low priority—as permission to attack civil society and to undermine anti-corruption efforts like @CICIGgt.
The @realDonaldTrump administration is demanding billions of dollars to build a wall &amp; to lock up more asylum seekers, including children. But at the same time, they’ve proposed cutting aid to the #NorthernTriangle by 30%. Which is a better investment?
Overall, there continue to be tremendous security, corruption and economic challenges in the #NorthernTriangle. And the bottom line is that, until conditions improve, people will keep undertaking the harrowing journey to our border in search of any kind of hope.
In #ElSalvador, we were able to meet with President-Elect @NayibBukele. He expressed a strong desire to strengthen economic and cultural ties with the United States, and I’m optimistic about his incoming administration. https://t.co/d0uTg7OCT0
We also need a US Ambassador in Honduras. At a time when there is so much at stake in the region, it’s completely unacceptable that @realDonaldTrump has not nominated anyone to fill this key position.
In #Honduras, it’s clear that the anti-corruption commission @OEA_MACCIH must be allowed to continue its important work. For the people to have confidence in government institutions, they must be able to trust that decisions are not driven by corruption.
We also heard repeatedly about malnutrition, a significant and pressing challenge in #Guatemala. The US can and should do more to address this basic human need.
In #Guatemala, the US must do everything it can to ensure free and fair elections in June. Guatemalans need to be able to trust that their elected government represents the will of the people. Without addressing this fundamental issue, other problems will continue to fester.
Home now. Here are a few more thoughts from our fact-finding trip to the #NorthernTriangle. @SenatorCarper and I were able to visit all three nations—Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
The GOP claims the #GreenNewDeal is farfetched &amp; unattainable because they are beholden to the Koch brothers. Our future is too important to be decided by special interests. We must rise up &amp; do everything in our power to save our homes, our businesses, our economy, &amp; our planet.
A Climate crisis is relentlessly eroding our quality of life. The #GreenNewDeal is a bold common-sense solution, not a radical dream. Our future is at stake. The truly crazy idea is that we should do nothing while our planet burns.

Let's be very clear: The only 'crisis' at the southern border is the humanitarian crisis President Trump and his administration created by ripping babies away from their parents' arms and locking up children.		https://t.co/uyLClZDz3x
.@realDonaldTrump just finished.  Almost everything he said was inaccurate.  The Wall doesn’t stop drugs.  Dems didn’t request a steel wall.  There is a crisis at the border, but it is a humanitarian crisis he has created.  And Ds fully support border security.
@realDonaldTrump is saying Dems oppose border security.  He just can’t tell the truth.  Ds and Rs all support border security, smart border security, but not a wasteful 4th century plan for a 21st century challenge.
The REAL crisis is America’s mistreatment of Felipe and other children – not @realDonaldTrump’s desperation to build his wall for his own political reasons. This shutdown is political theater and it’s wrong.
We cannot allow another child to suffer Felipe’s fate. Children need and deserve necessary medical care. Period. CBP has now belatedly hired someone to revamp their systems. Congress must ensure this happens.
Inflicting trauma on children as a political strategy comes from a very dark place in the heart of the @realDonaldTrump administration, and it must end.
Second, these tragedies flow in part from the Trump war on immigrant children: Child separation; a vastly expanded string of child prisons; family internment camps; and an overall strategy of inflicting trauma on children as central to a political “deterrence” strategy.
One clear point is this: A medical professional should be on hand to give every immigrant child a basic medical check. If a child has a fever, or is dehydrated, or listless, let’s get them to a hospital.
Felipe’s death is tragic, as is the death of 7-year-old Jakelin earlier in December. No child should ever die in American custody from insufficient medical care.
Yesterday, I went to New Mexico with @RepTorresSmall, @JoaquinCastrotx , @RepEscobar, @RepJerryNadler, @davidcicilline, and members of the @HispanicCaucus to investigate the death of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez.
Tonight, when @realDonaldTrump addresses the nation, let’s all remember that the only crisis on the border is the one he created by separating families, snatching kids from their parents, blocking refugees from legally seeking asylum and putting lives at risk.
When @realDonaldTrump addresses the nation tonight, remember that according to Fact Checker, he's made over 6,400 false &amp; misleading claims through the end of 10/18 an average of about 10/day. Whatever he claims tonight, the truth is probably the opposite. https://t.co/UhK7YZax6y

According to the administrator of the tent city child prison, these temporary structures are intended for emergencies like hurricanes and natural disasters. It’s costing tax payers almost $1 million per day!
So thousands of children are living in a tent prison. In the desert. For months on end.
They’re also threatening to hand over any undocumented family members to ICE, discouraging sponsors from coming forward.
The vast majority of these children have parents or other family members who are ready to sponsor them in the US, but the Trump Administration has deliberately created a bottleneck so that it’s difficult for the children to be released.
I just left the tent city at Tornillo. It is a child prison camp. They refused our request to speak with the children who are held there.
Thank you to all of the demonstrators who joined us in Tornillo today. We all need to stand up and expose this unconscionable humanitarian crisis.

Just left the Karnes Family Residential Center where fathers and sons are housed in a former medium-security prison. Different accommodations than Dilley, but the same principle—family interment camps.
We can’t look away. Now more than ever, we need to shine a light on what is happening at our border. Join me in Texas and keep up-to-date with what I see on the ground through my Instagram story: https://t.co/u5Dq4zY9Wg
We are about to tour the Karnes Family Residential Center. We’re told there are approximately 500 fathers and sons interned at Karnes. I’ll report back with more when we finish our tour.
That’s why @maziehirono @SenTinaSmith @RepJudyChu and I are here to investigate and shine a light on the unacceptable treatment of asylum seekers and refugees like Patricia and her daughter. Bear witness.  Speak out. This must stop. https://t.co/RRxZCW3mKM
This unconscionable treatment of children and families is unAmerican and not in keeping with our values.
Patricia and her daughter’s story broke our hearts as she told us about her journey and internment through her tears.
Her 15th birthday is this coming Tuesday. It’s supposed to be a special day - her Quinceanera. Instead of celebrating with friends and family, she will be locked up in an internment camp with her mom.
Patricia and her daughter have been at Dilley for almost 6 months. Her daughter has been suffering severe depression as a result of the trauma she has experienced—in Honduras and also here in America as a result of her internment
Patricia had no choice but to leave Honduras, like so many others.
The gang molested her daughter and threatened to rape and kill her.
We just left the Family Residential Center in Dilley, TX where I met Patricia, a mother who fled Honduras after she and her daughter were harassed and by a gang.

In recent years, we’ve seen incredibly disturbing attacks on journalists around the globe—from Jamal #Khashoggi’s brutal murder, to the imprisonment of Reuters reporters who were simply doing their jobs trying to report on atrocities against the Rohingya in Burma.
Last night, @SenateGOP blocked a bill to #ProtectMueller. This morning’s Twitter tirade by @realDonaldTrump proves why we must put our country above party. NOBODY is above the law. Not the President’s family, not his campaign operatives, and certainly not the President himself.

Instead, President Trump chose to skip the opportunity to honor the thousands of brave Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice for a free world on the 100th anniversary of the end of the Great War. Why? Because it was raining.
Congress designated today as Veterans Day in 1919 to mark the sacrifice of the millions of heroes who have served our great nation. Yesterday, @realDonaldTrump was in France to commemorate the end of the “war to end all wars” with other world leaders.
Today, we celebrate and honor our amazing veterans. These brave men and women are heroes who have sacrificed tremendously for our nation. Take a moment today to give thanks. #VeteransDay

This order is especially cruel because this admin has made a point of turning away asylum seekers at ports of entry. I know because I’ve seen it with my own eyes. This order has nothing to do with punishing illegal immigration, and everything to do with making asylum illegal.

Thank you to the brave survivors who came forward with their stories about sexual assault.  You’re an inspiration to all of us. #SundayMotivation
Today’s outcome makes it that much more difficult to reclaim our We the People democracy—but let it be a call to action for every American who cares about saving government of, by, and for the people.
I am deeply troubled by the signal the Senate has sent today by confirming Brett Kavanaugh instead of heeding their words.
They were looking to the Senate to stand up for survivors, and to send a clear message that treating any fellow human being this way is unacceptable behavior for someone seeking the privilege of a seat on the Supreme Court.
Over the last several weeks, I have heard from countless survivors of sexual assault and abuse. Many of these individuals saw their own stories reflected in the experiences of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez.
Today is a dark day for America. An individual totally unsuited to the bench has been confirmed to the Supreme Court, harming the integrity and the legitimacy of our courtsystem.
Last night and early this morning, I shared the powerful and compelling stories from more than 30 Oregon sexual assault survivors on the Senate Floor. I am so grateful to the strong women who offered their experiences. Thank you for your courage.
Congrats on your Nobel Peace Prize @NadiaMuradBasee and @DenisMukwege. Sexual violence and assault have no place in the world.  I am reminded today of the determination and resilience of so many out there working for a better future for their country and the world.

The entire message to every woman in America is that if you bring your story forward, and if Republicans are in charge, they will hire a prosecutor and treat you like a criminal. You won’t be heard or believed. And you won’t be treated like the patriot that you are.
I’m furious, having just been on the floor and listening to male Republican Senators talk about “fairness” in regard to Dr. Ford and Debbie Ramirez. In what universe is it “fair” that the FBI didn’t speak to a single corroborating witness of their accounts?
Every one of us should be able to agree that it's WRONG to assault women. We shouldn’t normalize horrible behavior as “boys being boys.” So, to every survivor of sexual assault: I see your strength &amp; courage through this difficult time, &amp; I stand resolutely with you in this fight
On every level, Brett Kavanaugh has completely disqualified himself to sit on the highest court in our land. The Senate still has one final chance tomorrow to do the right thing. I am praying that it will.
Let us hope that, a few minutes from now, a majority of the Senate will vote to protect the integrity of the Court.
First, @senatemajldr &amp; the GOP stole a SCOTUS seat from @BarackObama. Now they seek to fill a seat w/ an individual w/ a horrific record of lies and abuse of women, on top of a philosophy that rewrites the Constitution from its "We The People" mission to gov by &amp; for the powerful

This is precisely why women don’t report sexual assault. Senate Republicans: by rushing this vote, you are sending a horrific message to survivors all across America that their voices don’t matter; that the trauma they have endured doesn’t matter.

I can assure you that such aggressive and dehumanizing behavior should be a disqualifying factor for anyone proposed for to be nominated to a positon of service.
I want all of those women who have called or are  thinking about calling to know: You are being heard. Thank you for sharing your thoughts on this nominee.
Their lives were touched by sexual assault or aggression. Take seriously the experience Dr. Ford had, because it is an experience that is not too dissimilar to those experienced by friends, family, neighbors, coworkers in your lives.
The hearing from yesterday has caused many women from across the country to re-experience the trauma and terror of sexual assault and aggression in their past– with hundreds calling my office to share their stories.
Reopening the @FBI investigation is necessary but not sufficient. Committee should call other witnesses. And the Senate still needs Brett Kavanaugh’s full record from his @WhiteHouse years. The Senate should do its constitutional duty, not ram through a hyperpartisan nominee.
The Senate needs to take these claims seriously enough to have a legitimate investigation—one that is probing and thorough, not just a show to check a box.
Additionally, the Senate Judiciary Committee should hear under oath from Mark Judge and other witnesses and accusers. This isn’t about process, it’s about substance.
All three of Judge Kavanaugh’s accusers have called for a reopened FBI investigation, and survivors across this nation are looking to the Senate to see what message we send to them.
Reopening the FBI investigation is a necessary and appropriate step. In fact, it’s the bare minimum we should expect when a Supreme Court candidate is faced with such serious, disturbing, and credible charges.
Resist. PERSIST. And VOTE this November.

These hearings are supposed to be Kavanaugh’s job interview, but Republicans are turning it into a kangaroo court show trial of Dr. Ford. Appears that no measure of decency, shame, or justice will interfere with their determination to railroad this nominee through, apparently.
The test is whether the Judiciary R-11-men are treating Dr. Ford with the decency and dignity they would give their mother, wife, sister, or daughter. By treating her as a criminal, they are failing that test.
Message to the Judiciary R-11-men: Dr. Ford is not on trial. It is wrong to hire a prosecutor to cross-examine her as if she is a criminal.
If Dr. Ford is NOT on trial, then why did Senate Republicans hire a prosecutor to cross-examine her on Thursday? This is ridiculous.		https://t.co/ZxQv0dPycP

As this framework gets closer to potentially becoming a reality, we need full transparency and a fierce fight to strengthen these provisions that are key to the future of America’s middle class.
However, the most essential component to create a level playing field is to have stronger environmental and labor standards, and—critically—for those standards to actually be enforceable. Right now, the reported enforcement deal in this agreement is insufficient.
Reportedly, this potential deal does include some positive steps, such as a more level playing field for auto manufacturing and an overdue reining-in of unaccountable corporate tribunals.
For more than two decades, American jobs and American workers have suffered because of major imbalances in #NAFTA. Our middle class desperately needs a better deal. However, the devil is in the details.

No, @realDonaldTrump, that’s a lie. Your Administration’s child-snatching “Zero Tolerance” policy is a ZERO HUMANITY policy, inflicting pain and trauma on children.

During Watergate, principled Republicans stood up and saved our country from a constitutional crisis. We need that again in 2018. If you’re worried about protecting the Mueller investigation, it’s time to make your voice heard in Congress NOW—before it’s too late.
The ultimate goal—and the huge danger to our democracy—is for Trump to get Republicans in Congress to help slow or shut down this investigation, and to do so soon, before Mueller can get to the bottom of Trump's own activities.
Now, @realDonaldTrump is bullying the Justice Department into making highly sensitive information about an ongoing investigation available to Congressman Nunes, who has a demonstrated intent and history of abusing information to undermine the investigation.
Trump and shameless allies like Nunes are trying to paint the Mueller investigation as a frivolous, politically-motivated “witch hunt” with no end. But this is a serious investigation that’s already indicted 19 people and delivered 5 guilty pleas.
THREAD: Something very dangerous is happening right now. @realDonaldTrump is trying to make the Mueller investigation into just another partisan political battle, to downplay its significance &amp; keep Americans from uniting against any wrongdoing that might be uncovered.

That’s nonsensical and it’s dangerous for public safety, which is why I’ve joined with Democratic and Republican Senators alike – including @SenCoryGardner, @PattyMurray, @RonWyden, @LisaMurkowski &amp; more – to push for the SAFE Banking Act.
Right now, the conflict between state and federal laws is creating untenable situations – like legal cannabis businesses that have to operate in all-cash because no banks will serve them.
The people of every state should have the choice to make the same decision Oregonians have by legalizing cannabis, and they shouldn’t have to fear retribution or conflict with the federal government.
I applaud Senator Schumer for taking a bold stance for nationwide decriminalization. The American public’s views on this issue are shifting rapidly, and Congress needs to keep up. https://t.co/9Y56PAwkB9

We have learned in Afghanistan and Iraq the dangers of launching military actions without clearly articulated objectives and exit strategies. If the President wants to wage war, the American people and Congress need to be part of that decision.
If President Trump is going to use military force he must seek congressional authorization. The power to make war rests with Congress in Article I of the Constitution.
Bashar al-Assad has carried out a brutal campaign of attacks on his own people. The use of chemical weapons is unconscionable and he must be held accountable. But military action is not the only tool we have.

Trump &amp; GOP leaders should've never brought us to the #TrumpShutdown in the 1st place. We must keep holding their feet to the fire on bipartisan priorities—opioid crisis, #DACA, health centers &amp; more. Voted NO because a lengthy CR doesn’t create the pressure to get the deal done.

@RepBonamici @repblumenauer @OregonGovBrown There’s a bipartisan bill that would give #CHIP recipients &amp; their families the peace of mind they deserve. We should pass that bill. Instead, GOP is holding CHIP hostage &amp; using it as a bargaining chip. That’s just wrong. We won’t allow children to be used as a bargaining chip!
@RepBonamici @repblumenauer @OregonGovBrown Nine million American children – including 140,000 in Oregon – rely on #CHIP for important health care services, yet the GOP let it expire over 3 months ago.

It’s egregiously irresponsible for Trump to open the Arctic to drilling. The Arctic is much too fragile to withstand the type of spill that would be inevitable if drilling proceeds. We must put the Arctic completely and permanently off limits to drilling to prevent catastrophe.
Offshore drilling threatens the way of life for countless communities along the Atlantic &amp; Pacific coasts, including in Oregon. These communities don’t want offshore drilling that'll diminish tourism, harm commercial fishing operations, &amp; burden them w/ the risk of an oil spill.
Expanding offshore drilling at a time when we're already dealing with the devastating impacts of climate disruption is the height of irresponsibility. This reckless move would threaten local communities, resources &amp; ecosystems, &amp; exacerbate climate disruption. #TodaysClimateFact https://t.co/NW1MRaOX9f

This is not over yet: The House will still need to act on the Senate bill. It's up to every American who believes in the "We the People" vision of our democracy to stop this bill before it gets to the President's desk.
Here’s what the GOP just voted for:	- Raising taxes on millions of working Americans	- Ripping health care away from 13 million	- Showering massive giveaways on the richest and most powerful		#GOPTaxScam is a disgrace.
Let’s be clear: what just happened is a brazen move to rig our political system and our economy to work not for “We the People,” but for “We the Powerful.” If the #GOPTaxScam is allowed to become law, it will haunt America for decades to come.
This is a sad day for America.
When we shined a spotlight on the terrible DeVos Tax Earmark, a few in the GOP were embarrassed enough to take it out, which is exactly why GOP is rushing a handwritten bill through in the middle of the night. There’s plenty in there just as bad or worse that might now become law

@sheikhhasina @SenatorDurbin @BettyMcCollum04 @janschakowsky @RepCicilline Met with the Rohingya community in the Muslim quarter in the city of Sittwe. Five years ago, the Burmese government turned the neighborhood into a closed ghetto with barriers and police checkpoints. I can't believe this is happening in 2017. https://t.co/3zqNQ8wYS9
Spoke with Bangladesh Prime Minister @sheikhhasina and thanked her for the humanitarian access she is providing to Rohingya. We discussed how we can work together to respond to this crisis. https://t.co/ItsblFvEFJ

This brave young Rohingya boy showed me drawings he made of the Burmese military trucks and helicopters that attacked his village. https://t.co/rKdTZ7Vuri
These Rohingya women told me powerful stories about the persecution they faced and showed me their burn scars. The tragedy is unimaginable. It’s imperative that we work with international partners to address this urgent crisis. https://t.co/ZkxdI9wurv

With GOP trying to repeal #ACA by September 30, we must fight harder than ever to protect Marie's daughter-in-law's care. #OregonACAStory https://t.co/42coacFYOZ
According to @CenterOnBudget, #GrahamCassidy is MORE damaging than straight repeal. Once again, we must rise up and #KillTheBill. https://t.co/y35L2Er0h2
@SenateGOP Under #GrahamCassidy, OR loses $6.6BIL in federal funding in 2027—putting the lives of 400k Oregonians who rely on #Medicaid/OHP on the line https://t.co/AwsXpreBU9
@SenateGOP Same disastrous cuts to #Medicaid. Same cruel disregard for people's health and peace of mind.
@SenateGOP #GrahamCassidy is just as bad, if not worse, than past versions of #TrumpCare.

#Burma must cease anti-Rohingya persecution, immediately reverse conditions that created this crisis and allow access for humanitarian orgs.
