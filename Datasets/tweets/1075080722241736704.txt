Last week I met Sidney Walton, an 100 year old WWII veteran who fought to eradicate Nazism.		Those ruinous beliefs are again ascendent, infecting our politics. We owe it to Sidney &amp; our kids to call it out &amp; not whitewash these moments, in my district or anywhere in the US 	-HR
Last week I introduced the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act, to brace these communities for climate change. I talked about it at the @TransportDems hearing this week, &amp; look forward to working with my infrastructure-minded colleagues across the aisle to pass this bill into law. https://t.co/V4l1uKlxwl
It has been 100 years since Women won the hard-fought right to vote, yet Women do not have fully equal rights, liberties, and pay. This month it's on us to think as much about how to make the future better, as we do about Women's contributions in the past
Yesterday at the @OversightDems hearing, Cohen told me that the President lied under oath about his relationship with Felix Sater—which appears to have been a close one.		I look forward to my colleagues serving on the Intelligence Committee getting closer to the truth. https://t.co/oAz5qPFMti
Last week I signed onto a letter calling on Trump to push the Vietnamese govt to release Michael Nguyen, a US citizen imprisoned without charges for over 7 months. I'm outraged by human rights abuses in Vietnam, and I stand with OC's Vietnamese Americans.		https://t.co/W5O8mmtw0M
This month, the extreme weather in OC caused $13 million in property damage. The OC BOS has declared an emergency. Climate change has arrived in CA--that's why I introduced the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act. We can't wait any longer to #ActOnClimate 		https://t.co/2y7n1WYpLp
The @Surfrider Foundation protects our beaches--an essential element of our coastal community in #CA48. We spoke today about the effects of proposed offshore drilling. The Dept. of the Interior doesn't get to open our shores to special interests at the expense of residents. https://t.co/SFOJ4G3Roo
Last night I talked to @donlemon about the revelation that Donald Trump lied under oath about his relationship with Felix Sater at the @OversightDems hearing. https://t.co/pNc29fk6Gk
Gun violence shouldn't be partisan. More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks--thousands of Americans die every year by gun violence. I'm a proud cosponsor of HR8, which just became the first major gun reform bill to pass the House in decades. #EndGunViolence
Today Michael Cohen told me that convicted Russian mobster Felix Sater occupied an office on Trump's floor, the same one Cohen himself later moved into. 	I asked: Based on those facts, isn’t it true that Donald Trump misled at best, or at worst lied under oath?	Michael Cohen: Yes https://t.co/5ayhTVjM3c
RT @BBCWorld: “Is it true that President Trump lied under oath?”	“Yes”		Democrat Harley Rouda pushes Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen…
Congress doesn’t block for the President. We serve the American people. 		Why have my Republican colleagues failed to ask even one question about Trump’s activities? If we seek the truth, what are they afraid we’ll find?		This committee’s job is oversight, time to clock in.
The White House isn’t just separating familes at the border– their policy of mass deportation is tearing Vietnamese American families in California. I stand with my Southeast Asian constituents and @CAPAC colleagues against these callous deportations https://t.co/vjE6nq45CS

At today's @TransportDems hearing, we asked experts how we can overhaul our energy infrastructure to battle climate change. https://t.co/6j8sp5U3qT
In CA, climate change has already arrived. If we take a serious approach to infrastructure, we can both reduce carbon emissions, and make our district more resilient to the consequences of climate change. I’m glad @transportdems are holding a hearing on that very idea today. https://t.co/RlwaE3Vmf5
Nearly a year after Trump’s DHS began separating children from their parents at the border, we still don’t know the extent of the practice or the lasting damage it wrought. Today I voted with @oversightdems to subpoena the administration for those answers. https://t.co/JtEIqamaxT
Thanks for having me, OC. Heading back to DC to work for the constituents of #CA48! https://t.co/sBwEtSo0ex
This national emergency declaration was an unlawful dodge of checks and balances. It will rob Californians of disaster relief funds for real emergencies. Today the House will pass a privileged resolution blocking the declaration. I urge Senators with common sense to do the same.
My reflections on Tuesday’s town hall, in the @ocregister this morning:	https://t.co/tcPbHD7pOS
Today I introduced the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act. We need to address the reality of climate change if we want to keep the same quality of life when oceans rise. My constituents in #CA48 deserve action. With the Trump Admin ignoring this crisis, it's up to Congress to act https://t.co/PDiYHVOLkJ
Today I joined CNN with @ErinBurnett to talk about the coming Oversight Hearing with testimony from Michael Cohen https://t.co/CSlJgdxTum
The I-405 widening project is the largest transportation project in CA, and it’s right in the heart of #CA48. Thank you to the @goOCTA for briefing me on this project—I’ll be an advocate on @TransportDems for more federal funds to bring OC’s infrastructure into the 21st Century. https://t.co/KVGmr3Zf6z

I spoke to @AlexWitt on MSNBC this weekend about Trump's national emergency declaration– it’s an assault on the constitution. When it comes to our founding principles, both houses of Congress need to walk the walk and block this declaration. https://t.co/G1qyYGh3gC
Chaos and dysfunction cannot be allowed to govern our national security. Nuclear proliferation mistakes cannot be undone.		It's time for the White House to get serious about our security, and that means we need to shed sunshine on their relationship with Saudi Arabia. https://t.co/8hzMGq8GTy
Our @oversightdems report reveals that White House advisors including Michael Flynn &amp; Jared Kushner were &amp; possibly still are working to rush highly sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, and some stood to personally make money off new power plants.		We will investigate.
Presidents Day is a reminder of the giants of American history who have occupied our seats in Congress—like Lincoln, Kennedy, Bush Sr. 		They knew these seats don’t belong to us, they’re a position of public trust. Let’s live up to their examples and make our time here matter.
In some cases those we lost will make headlines, though others will be laid to rest in anonymity. But all will have had someone who loved and needed them. 		May those of us who have the power to alter our deadly course have the courage to use it. https://t.co/vY6YX7QLIe
It’s easy to become numb to the deadly gun violence which has come to grip our country, but we cannot repeat often enough both our love &amp; commitment towards the survivors, nor our anger and disgust that, should we choose the easy path of inaction, tens of thousands more will die.
California endured mudslides, snow, and flash floods this week. Home in #CA48, my constituents underwent mandatory evacuations. Climate change has arrived in full force, and we can't afford to delay action any longer, much less condone denial altogether.

My friend, @RepGaramendi and I went on KCAL last night. A fictional national emergency would set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. Trump could use the declaration to raid billions from California's disaster relief funds- which Californians need for real emergencies. https://t.co/tZdn5CiSpK
.@RepGaramendi and I will be on KCAL and CBS tonight to address the threat Trump’s national emergency would pose to California.		While we’re fighting fires and extreme weather, he would take billions from California’s disaster relief funds to pay for this monument to his ego.
The brinkmanship of the last two months is emblematic of the brokenness of our politics. It is time for us to walk away from shutdowns and emergency declarations, and work together in good faith to improve the lives of the people who sent us here
He would unlawfully steal money from Army Corps of Engineers projects, including $160 mil in CA-48, to fund a monument to his ego. When we face real emergencies like climate change &amp; the opioid crisis, it defies belief that he would so casually waste taxpayers’ money. https://t.co/we0cEh92u1
If he does indeed intend to declare a national emergency, President Trump will set a dangerous precedent for future presidents, Democrat or Republican, to abuse their authority to circumvent the checks and balances of the Constitution.
I know there are Republicans who care about the Climate Crisis as much as I do. I'm focused on finding bipartisan support here in Congress and working across the aisle. So let's work together.		https://t.co/3VMtUeq8PI

ICYMI, I wrote an op-ed in @TheDailyPilot about my Encouraging Small Business Innovation Act, which passed the House unanimously. Small businesses are a cornerstone of our economy; we need to promote policies that drive R&amp;D in small businesses. See here👇		https://t.co/cQ5n5hfncV
I spoke with my constituent, @JamieRodny, a federal investigator who recently moved to #CA48 with her family. The #TrumpShutdown threatens her family's livelihood and she has forcefully called on @SenMajLdr and @realDonaldTrump to reopen our government. Thank you, Jamie! -HR https://t.co/gPzI3j5Iye
Democrat’s Disaster Appropriations bill will help families &amp; communities by appropriating $12.14 billion in recovery funds to help with infrastructure and development. The funding also works to mitigate damage from future disasters, including those caused by #ClimateChange. https://t.co/Ak09dShizR
#ClimateChange is a real and devastating threat to all of us. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring @RepTedLieu’s Climate Solutions Act: we need real solutions to combat our climate crisis. https://t.co/OEoYHYuQLW
.@realDonaldTrump's attacks on the environment won't stop. I will not stand for any expansion of offshore drilling, and proudly support @RepCarbajal 's California Clean Coast Act to permanently prohibit future drilling off the coast of California. 		https://t.co/tdfsnRQZyh
