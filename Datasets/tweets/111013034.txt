This month’s meeting of the Akron Press Club is about to get underway - @akronschools superintendent David James about to take the stage for his annual State of the Schools address!
RT @ShaneAnneWynn: Photographing  the @AkronPressClub presentation by @NormOrnstein.  Question from crowd: For a million dollars,	will @rea…
Says we’re in uncharted territory.
Closing question - will Pres. Trump last to the end of his first term?  @NormOrnstein does not believe it’s likely.  Many possibilities - Among them - sees a scenario like what happened to Spiro Agnew. But then again can’t rule out the power of tribal and social media.
RT @BruceWingesABJ: How do you fix things that have been broken without breaking more things, Norman Ornstein asks ⁦@AkronPressClub⁩ https:…
Suggests we follow Australian model where everyone must vote.
Corruption in elections, voter suppression all go back the beginning says @NormOrnstein but the U.S. is the only country that has partisans running elections. Only country that puts burden of voter registration on individuals, not the state.
Says the tribalism is not going away anytime soon.  What we need now is triage.Suggest changing business model so tribal media doesn’t have as much power.  Give more power to public media.
Says the problem is moderate Republican and pragmatic Republicans are gone.  It’s a bigger problem on the GOP side... but a common problem to both parties says @NormOrnstein
RT @BruceWingesABJ: We now are driven by negative partisanship, Norman Ornstein tells ⁦@AkronPressClub⁩ https://t.co/N4lyBCg0S3
Says both parties have moved apart... but points to a Republican Party that’s gone off the rails.
Also points to the end of the Fairness Doctrine.
Says Gingrich came in with plans on how to break the Democrats hold on Congress.  Says Gingrich tribalized the process and radicalized the Republicans in Congress.
How did we get here?  Jan 3. 1979 when Newt Gingrich got sworn into Congress says @NormOrnstein
.@NormOrnstein says he never imagined that we’d have the government we have now without the checks and balances.  Says we’re at an existential point in our politics and that this is about more than just President Trump. There’s a bigger and deeper set of maladies.

Not improving presidential succession plans is akin to very bright people choosing not to write a Will because they’re superstitious says @NormOrnstein
Points to late season hurricane in 2018 that devastated parts of Florida.  What if somethign like that happened to the Gulf states in the days leading up to Election Day?
Tragedies in the past have pointed out the vulnerabilities and need to improve the lines of succession.  What happens if there’s a terrorist attack or a cyber attack on Election Day that knocks out part of the country’s voting in a national elections asks  @NormOrnstein
RT @BruceWingesABJ: Norman Ornstein tells ⁦@AkronPressClub⁩ you could alter presidential succession so there could be another election http…
On 9/11, @NormOrnstein says he had an epiphany - that there were no provisions in place to account for something like the loss of most of the congress - if that had happened, that could have led to martial law.  Pointed to the need for a focus on the continuity of government.
.@NormOrnstein says it’s also the Chinese digging into American commercial processes.
Why not alter the line of succession to include the possibility of an election says @NormOrnstein.  He says it’s worth considering... especially given Russian meddling.
We could build in a do over without a new constitutional amendment says @NormOrnstein
Beyond the 25th Amendment- presidential legitimacy and succession - where we might go. @NormOrnstein says what should we do if we have an election that’s not legit due to foreign interference or anything else?  We don’t have a do over button.
Our event with @NormOrnstein is gettting underway in Akron with a discussion of the 25th amendment.
Is the 25th Amendment enough?  Join us on January 25th for some thoughts on presidential succession from political scientist @NormOrnstein - RSVP today https://t.co/Qo8iDGPJ0i

Cuyahoga and Stark have arts funding.  What about Summit? @Nicole_Mullet says the conversation needs to be started
Diversity Equity Inclusion - more than just a catch phrase. @markmasuoka says the challenge is getting more people involved in the conversation- then respond to it. Says @AkronArtMuseum is working on it.
Diversity in Akron Arts - legacy orgs have been actively meeting to discuss moving forward on making welcoming spaces. @Nicole_Mullet says arts should be a leader on diversity.

Support for local artists - Kamelia Fisher says Summit Art Space provides studio space some wouldn’t otherwise have.  Also opportunity to show and sell their work in their galleries.

Horrigan Q to Sipplen : You mention the demise of many Akron policies, Can you mention one policiy that was successful? #APCDebate
Sipplen Q to Horrigan: People who invested in Plusquellic recall have invested in your campaign - how different? #APCDebate
Sipplen -need to review finances and see what is needed not wanted #APCDebate
Horrigan our businesses get poached every day from other entities and we need to start knocking on doors of local business #APCdebate

Sipplen would have an independent auditor and follow city charter with human rights and senior commissions #APCDebate
Sipplen downtown Akron doesn't need an arena but hotels for people visiting the venues we already have #APCDebate
Horrigan wants to see people, plans and crains downtown #APCDebate
What do you think is missing in downtown Akron?  Horrigan vibrancy like short north in Columbus &amp; Sipplen vibrancy for families #APCDebate
Panel question 16% turnout in primary - what will you do to engage voters? #APCDebate
Sipplen and Horrigan both say party affiliation will not impact office #APCDebate
