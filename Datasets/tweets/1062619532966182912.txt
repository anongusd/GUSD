@charliekirk11 This system has failed. Thinking  time bombs in global financial system waiting to explode because of the reckless and wrong policies of the major developed countries. Nothing short of a revolution in policy is required to minimise the damage of a crisis that is about to come
@ManCity @aguerosergiokun @F1 Aguero is one of the best Striker in the EPL with out doubt
@RandPaul The US are the biggest problems for humanity. Since 1945, the US are involved in more than 140 wars in the world. That is riduculos. 1 life lost is to many
