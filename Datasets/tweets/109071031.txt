... these are workers who mostly are on the job 24/7, 365 days a year. Holiday or no holiday. The difference this year, thanks to President Trump, is that they won’t know when their next pay check will come. The Senate passed a clean Continuing Resolution. The House should too.

@BannockCreek121 That is exactly what this bill does. S. 861 - The Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act.

These are federal law enforcement and correctional workers from ATF, Bureau of Prisons, FBI, US Marshals, DEA. Forest Service firefighters and even weather forecasters. More than 380,000 public servants will be furloughed - NASA, Nat’l Parks, HUD, DOT and others.
There is no such thing as a ‘good’ shutdown. Even a partial shutdown costs taxpayers money. It inconveniences the public. And its certainly not fair to the federal public servants who would be directly affected.  	More than 420,000 will be working without pay ...

Let's be clear about what this means. Though both parties reached an agreement, @realDonaldTrump would rather block funding for:		-Homeland Security	-ATF, TSA and Border Patrol	-Opioid epidemic response	-Disaster relief		Over a costly, ineffective wall. #ArtOfTheDeal? https://t.co/XECYq6UBBt
This is no way to govern. https://t.co/L5uPbGIZYo
.@POTUS: What's your strategy? American troops deserve to know that you have one, and the American people deserve transparency from their commander in chief. Explain yourself. #Syria https://t.co/u8uqvqxoTz
Without a congressional AUMF, U.S. intervention in #Syria has long been suspect. But suddenly pulling out U.S. presence without any clear strategy leaves a void that threatens both regional stability and our own national security.		This is no way to conduct foreign policy.

President Trump's new #SchoolSafety report rightly points out the unmet need for mental health services in schools.

Last week, pipe bombs were sent across the country to public figures and media outlets. On Thursday, two African Americans were murdered in Jeffersontown, KY.		And on Saturday, 11 people were murdered while practicing their faith in an attack on Pittsburgh's Jewish community.

Under these junk health care plans, insurers can deny coverage to people with #PreExistingConditions and refuse to provide health care services required under the Affordable Care Act – including refusing to cover prescription drugs, maternity care, and emergency room visits.

Today's vote is an effort to stop the expansion of these junk plans.		Fixing our health care system requires serious leadership and ideas, but so far, all the Trump Administration has done is continually attempt to undermine protections for people with preexisting conditions.
That's ridiculous. Anything that fails to cover #PreExistingConditions or basic essential services like prescription drugs isn't real health care. Yet the Trump Admin has been working to expand the use of junk plans, knowing full well that they're just that: junk. #NoJunkPlans
This is happening right now and I'm voting yes. Americans need real coverage – not junk coverage.

The 42,000-page document dump the night before the hearings began was an especially egregious display of contempt for the constitutional process. Even now, much of #Kavanaugh's record has not been provided to the Senate.
Further, this whole process has been outrageous.		My request to meet with Judge #Kavanaugh before the hearings began was denied by the White House. I joined @JudiciaryDems in requesting a modest postponement so I had adequate time to review his full record – that was also denied.
My decision is based on:		1) his judicial track record	2) his equivocation on whether presidents should be investigated while in office, even though he investigated President Bill Clinton for Independent Counsel Ken Starr, and	3) what little we have seen of his White House record
Based on what I heard — and didn't hear — from Judge #Kavanaugh at his hearings, and having reviewed his writings and record as a judge, I believe any reasonable person would have cause to be concerned, even fearful, of his confirmation to the Supreme Court.		I will vote no.

This #LaborDay I want federal workers, educators, factory workers and all workers to know: I stand with you. @POTUS' ongoing attacks on unions &amp; worker protections run counter to our values and all that's made our economy strong. We must and we WILL stand united in opposing them.
Wishing all the hardworking men and women of this country, and the unions who fight for their interests, a happy #LaborDay. American workers built this nation. Let today be a reminder that we owe them the fair wages, benefits, job training and quality #healthcare they've earned.
This week, @BetsyDeVosED sided against the rights of sexual assault victims, student loan borrowers defrauded by for-profit schools, and educators by proposing federal education dollars be used to purchase guns for classrooms. I will not allow these policies to go unchallenged.
The Secretary of Education is supposed to promote students’ health and safety. Utterly disheartening to see @BetsyDeVosED consistently turn her back against those she should protect. https://t.co/ArEeCSTphg

Third: our educators are exactly that – educators. A difficult enough job as it stands. They do not want guns in their classrooms, making the job exponentially more difficult and dangerous. This proposal would ignore that reality, which is precisely why I'll fight it. #GunSafety
Second: as Maryland educators prepare to head back to school, 91% will use their own money to purchase supplies for their classrooms. They need resources to support struggling students and address mental health needs – not firearms to protect from imaginary grizzly bear attacks.

Our #GunViolence epidemic requires our collective honesty. We must put an end to the suggestion that Americans must choose between their Constitutional rights and the safety of their families. That's just false. We are fully capable of having both, and we must insist that we do.
But today, I am also thinking about how condolences are inadequate. It is a tragedy that this cycle of #GunViolence continues to play itself out, over and over again, while lawmakers offer thoughts and prayers instead of action. This cycle must end, and it must end with us.
I want to thank Anne Arundel County Police and all the first responders who rushed headlong into danger to save others' lives yesterday. This tragedy could have been even worse without their quick action. And I'm grateful to @ATFHQ and @FBI for assisting officers at the scene.

This is a debate of whether we are on the side of big utility-type companies or individuals and small businesses to guarantee them equal access to this critical service. Almost half of consumers have no choice of ISP. This is not about competition but preventing discrimination.

This flooding illustrates the importance of the $225 million I secured for sewer overflow control in this year's #WRDA bill. Those funds will help communities construct separate rain water and sewage water systems, so people can keep using their water even during bad rainstorms. https://t.co/89IgVthSg1
I'm continuing to monitor the devastating flooding around Frederick and the Eastern Shore, and encourage residents to stay off the roads unless strictly necessary. Marylanders everywhere should listen closely to their local alert systems and follow @MDMEMA for updates.

In reply to my questioning, Mr. Pompeo said "torture is illegal." I agree. But as Sec of State, how would he reconcile his past views &amp; @POTUS' sentiments on torture, which in 2016 included, “I would bring back a lot worse than waterboarding”? Will he stand up to the president?
Director Pompeo characterizes @POTUS’ response to Russia's interference in our democracy as "robust." Wildly inaccurate until President Trump imposes all of the legally required sanctions on Putin and actually musters the courage to SAY the Kremlin is a threat.
One of my concerns regarding Director Pompeo's nomination for Secretary of State is how – in an administration that is so erratic and philosophically unmoored – he plans to promote human rights &amp; democracy around the world. 	 	Watch live: https://t.co/6XiT84UdFR

Thank you to @ANStweets for hosting me today, and for the important, heroic work you do every day to preserve and protect Maryland's environment. Conservation isn't just a moral imperative, but a public health and economic concern. Your work is necessary now more than ever. https://t.co/6XelrYcvsO
Thank you, @PGCOC, for meeting with me to discuss how important dedicated funding for @wmata is for Prince George's County's workforce, the impact of the latest tax bill, health care, and more. A highly productive and informative conversation, as always. https://t.co/rpYQDEmlpc
.@PGCOC wisely advises: without a healthy workforce, our businesses and economy cannot prosper. Yet another reason we can't lose our focus on achieving more affordable #healthcare.
Glad to be with @PGCOC discussing what kind of resources and support Prince George's County businesses need to keep the local economy moving. At the top of that list: a better understanding of how the recently-passed tax bill will impact small business owners. https://t.co/yV1whMxyjx

I'm hopeful that after his time at the CIA, Director Pompeo has a greater appreciation for the balance between national security and civil rights. I look forward to a robust hearing in the near future.
I voted against Mr. Pompeo when he was nominated for CIA director because of his troubling opposition to closing Guantanamo Bay and his willingness to not only support, but expand, the bulk collection of innocent Americans' personal information.
I intend to press Director Pompeo on how he views America's role in the world. I want to know whether he recognizes the role of the State Department in promoting human rights and democracy around the world, and how that strengthens U.S. national security here at home.
Secretary Tillerson's firing is symptomatic of @POTUS' inability to take independent advice from his advisors.		While Secretary Tillerson and I may have disagreed on many policy issues, he gave the president an unvarnished look at the realities and importance of diplomacy. https://t.co/kq17JFrN0b

#Dreamers are real children with real families, many of whom are our neighbors, colleagues and friends. And their lives are in jeopardy. So I'm not giving up. @SenateDems and I are going to keep fighting for #Dreamers until the job is done, with or without the president's help.
I am bitterly disappointed by today's failure to pass legislation protecting #Dreamers. By threatening to veto bipartisan legislation, @POTUS – once again – poisoned good-faith bipartisan negotiations and made it impossible to find a viable compromise. But this fight is not over.
RT @ChrisMurphyCT: Lots of people lamenting "nothing will change" today. 		That's what people said before the Montgomery boycott. 		That's…
Horrified. My heart is with Florida tonight. It's an outrage that gun violence has reached our children yet again, in a place where they should feel safest: their school. I'm praying for the victims and their families, though I know our prayers will not be enough.
Fact 5: #TPS recipients are the parents of more than 190,000 U.S. citizen children, who were born here, raised here and go to school here. Forcing legal TPS immigrants to now leave the country would tear those families apart. 		And that's just not who we are as a nation. #SaveTPS
Fact 4: #TPS recipients have been here working, paying taxes and contributing to our economy for years. Many have been living here for decades. 		Losing them would cost the U.S. an estimated $164 billion in Gross Domestic Product over 10 years. #SaveTPS
Fact 3: The layoffs of 250,000 #TPS holders currently employed would cost their employers – U.S. businesses, many of them our neighborhood small businesses – nearly $1 billion in immediate turnover costs.
Fact 2: Because so many are homeowners, kicking out #TPS recipients could destabilize U.S. housing markets as 60,000 mortgages would be put at risk.
This week, it's more important than ever that we speak openly – and factually – about #immigration. Let's start with the #TPS program.		Fact 1: TPS recipients are legal immigrants. They came here legally, seeking refuge from tragedy. Now, 1/3 of them are U.S. homeowners. #SaveTPS

$240 billion in infrastructure spending is eliminated, reducing budgets in every category: from roads, bridges, ports, to transit, water &amp; wastewater.		It's clear that infrastructure joins the long list of issues for which @POTUS has no desire to be a serious negotiating partner.

The opioid epidemic, Alzheimer's, brain cancer, antibiotic resistant bacteria – we must invest in these health crises, including by investing in @NIH.		Our research institutions are world class; they can save lives if we give them the resources. This #BudgetDeal does.
The bipartisan #BudgetDeal will also substantially increase federal support for the #OpioidEpidemic, which has destroyed too many lives. We need to invest in prevention, treatment, and recovery. This budget finally does that.
The #BudgetDeal @SenateDems struck is imperfect, but I'm pleased we successfully negotiated much for middle income families. We expanded funding for community health centers, closed #Medicare's donut hole, invested more into child care &amp; funded much-needed infrastructure projects
I supported the #BudgetDeal because there's no such thing as a "good shutdown," and it was urgent that we fund key priorities. I'm pleased the Senate will now turn to immigration reform; we must roll up our sleeves and finally get the job done, with or without @POTUS' help. https://t.co/qQ4Gc566v1

On Thursday, we hit the government's funding deadline. Again.		Republicans control the House, Senate and White House. I hope they understand we cannot govern -- and our military &amp; federal agencies cannot effectively do their jobs -- with continuing resolutions. We need a #budget.
There are useful and important ways we could be spending $25 billion. A #BorderWall is not one of them. It would do nothing to address the core problems with our immigration system, making it fundamentally ineffective and a waste of taxpayers' money.		Let's do better.
Also #BetterThanAWall: Providing broadband to more Americans. $5 billion would provide high speed internet access to more than 2,000 rural communities that are currently underserved. Today, internet access is critical for finding employment, going to school and staying connected.
More ideas: Infrastructure. $25 billion would reduce our bridge backlog by 20%, increasing safety and efficiency on our roadways nationwide, all while creating 325,000 jobs.		$25 billion would also reduce the public transit repair backlog by nearly 1/3. #BetterThanAWall
More ideas for how we could spend $25 billion, besides on a futile #BorderWall:		Veterans. $25 billion would cover much of what's needed over the next decade to repair, upgrade, and meet safety standards at our VA hospitals, and close critical gaps in the VA's #healthcare system.
Agree. https://t.co/baGx4UtMqd
... the president continues to do all he can to marginalize the rule of law and the independence of the Justice Department, while crippling the intelligence and law enforcement professionals who work tirelessly to keep our country safe.
No one should be confused about what happened today: the president, once again, chose politics over national security. For the sake of our republic, a bipartisan majority of Congress must step up and put an end to this dangerous pattern of behavior. #NunesMemo https://t.co/lZas5ySh9r
RT @MarkWarner: The investigators are the rank and file. You appointed the leadership. https://t.co/SAIKz4H9eL
These are just a few of the ways $25 billion would be better spent. These are just a few ways we can make our country safer and stronger. Using young #Dreamers' lives as leverage to waste billions of taxpayer dollars on a futile border wall is not one of them.
$7 billion would ensure that all 1.16 million firefighters across the U.S. have breathing apparatus gear, potentially saving our first responders' lives as they work so hard to save ours. Currently, half of our country's fire departments cannot equip every firefighter on a shift.
$25 million would establish 10 more state drug task forces to stop heroin traffickers. 80% of heroin seized last year was at ports of entry, so a #BorderWall won't solve our #OpioidEpidemic – but more manpower &amp; technology at our ports could have a real, dramatic, positive effect
$25 billion would eliminate the current backlog of 1,400 toxic and hazardous Superfund sites located in every state in the country.
$25 billion would fund 11,000 water projects to repair and upgrade our crumbling drinking water and sewer systems nationwide – creating more than 500,000 new construction jobs in the process. #NoWall
THREAD: President Trump's #BorderWall would cost American taxpayers $25 billion – yes, that's billion, with a "b." And it would not fix our broken immigration system, it would not make us safer, it would not make America stronger.		But I have some ideas for what would.
Deeply disappointed w/passage of the new Polish law that may impede research, scholarship, journalism — and more — on the Holocaust. This absolutely is the wrong way to reach the supposed goal of "more accurate statements about the Holocaust."

The #MuslimBan, released one year ago today, was part of an "America First" strategy that will assuredly lead to "America Alone." It denigrated our core values as a melting pot, and isolated us from the rest of the world. We cannot become desensitized to how unacceptable that is.
Today marks one year since @POTUS' #MuslimBan, a shameful attempt to discriminate against Muslim immigrants. It exposed the fear, insecurity and even xenophobia that have come to define this Administration. Our response to it, as Americans, will define us.

They make permanent tax breaks for corporations but sunset cuts for low- and middle-income families and #SmallBiz so that in 10 years, working families will see billions in additional tax hikes while the big corporations are still protected. It isn’t fair. It isn’t right.
This so-called tax reform is a collection of tax cuts for corporations &amp; higher-income families. It does not target middle-income &amp; working families despite repeated comments from Republican senators saying that it does. It blows a $1.5 trillion dollar hole in our debt...

@SenateGOP @POTUS Case in point: while @SenateGOP found no room in this #budget for health care, it found room to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%
@SenateGOP @POTUS The wealthy. This #budget balloons our deficit &amp; takes resources from middle class families to give tax cuts to big corporations &amp; the rich.
@SenateGOP @POTUS So if this #budget doesn't help infrastructure, Medicare, those struggling to afford health care, or housing, or food - who does it benefit?
@SenateGOP @POTUS Our crumbling infrastructure? Again, no. @SenateGOP’s budget cuts transportation spending by $200 billion. #Budget18
@SenateGOP @POTUS What about low income Americans? Nope. @SenateGOP's #budget comes with a $37 BILLION cut to affordable housing and $6.5 billion cut to WIC.

Rethink repeal of the #CleanWaterRule, @POTUS. It would help no one but polluters. Protect Americans' right to clean drinking water instead.

Those who endured discrimination in silence; those who fought for civil rights without recognition.
And let's remember that many who deserve celebrating this #BlackHistoryMonth will never have their name in a history book:
#BlackHistory is American history. The contributions of Black activists, inventors, artists and entrepreneurs have benefited us all.

I wish @realDonaldTrump would have considered the mental and physical wellbeing of #trans students rather than appeasing his political base.
.@POTUS, #trans children's safety is not a "state issue." All kids deserve a welcoming learning environment regardless of their zip code.

Religious-based threats have no place in a free, open society like ours. We must actively and loudly discourage such vicious activity. #JCC
Hate-filled threats aren't only a concern for Jewish communities. Leaders at every level MUST speak out - forcefully - against #intolerance.

Let's be clear: a #TwoStateSolution is the only path forward that will broker lasting peace. https://t.co/COwi2hXQpN
The only path for #peace between Palestinians &amp; Israelis is a secure Palestinian state and a secure Jewish state, living side-by-side.
Trump's willingness to abandon a #TwoStateSolution for Israelis and Palestinians is completely out of step w/ decades of US foreign policy.
#Pruitt, who wants to run @EPA, described himself as "a leading advocate against the EPA agenda." A thorough vetting seems pretty warranted.
If #Pruitt wants to lead @EPA, we need to know his ties w/ oil industry won't impact his job. Postpone a vote til we can examine those ties.

It's not just about 400K MDers who will lose coverage if #ACA repealed w/o replacement. We all will have higher premiums and less coverage
Thank you @mtennonbaptist for hosting us tonight to spread word about how we can fight back against reckless plans by Rs to repeal ACA https://t.co/FG2kBO2RgV
Nonpartisan @USCBO numbers don't lie. Repealing #ACA without a replacement plan would be financially devastating and morally irresponsible.
Nonpartisan @USCBO: #ACA repeal = premiums rising 20% - 25% in the 1st year after repeal &amp; "would double by 2026": https://t.co/U7tVWtjcDS
The nonpartisan @USCBO today said repealing the #ACA would lead to major premium hikes for all. 20% to 25% in the first year after repeal.
The CBO calculates the effects of an #ACA repeal would be even worse by 2026: 32 million uninsured. 32 million reasons to oppose repeal.
Nonpartisan @USCBO just announced if GOP repeals the #ACA, 18 MILLION Americans will lose insurance within the year https://t.co/ihX3bKEEzv

A patchwork of state laws won't stop widespread efforts to keep people from voting. Congress must pass the #VotingRights Advancement Act
"We must open up the #voting process so everyone can participate. If we fail to do that, history will not be kind to us." Amen @RepJohnLewis
"Voter intimidation is not a thing of the past." Agree. That why we must pass strong legislation protecting against discriminatory practices
We need to make sure that Americans can register and get to the polls w/out fear or intimidation. #vote #freeandfairelections
