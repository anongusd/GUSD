Back in forward motion. Conductor says we were given OK to mive. "Let's try this again," he says.
We're reversing again. "The hold was lifted and then reapplied," conductor says.
Well we didn't make it far before they stopped us again.
We're moving. Guess the police activity is over.

@emanuelusa yes of course
@emanuelusa it's a massive survey-- one of the biggest and most respected in the country
@emanuelusa As a chief aim of the story is the shift in opinion in favor of gun rights over the past few decades
@emanuelusa If you read the piece, it is only mentioned in the context of public opinion polling 1/2
@greg6207430 It is survey data. You can choose to disagree with the findings, but it doesn't make it incorrect.
@emanuelusa Neither that source nor the story as a whole define assault weapons. You're imagining content -- and bias -- that doesn't exist.
@emanuelusa Well, the article didn't say it was.
@emanuelusa ok. You still haven't cited a single specific.
@emanuelusa Sunce no opinion was expressed in the story and it made clear how fervently gun rights views are, I haven't a clue your problem

Our latest on Weight Watchers founder Jean Nidetch, who died today at 91  http://t.co/URgPQl8pLG
@NomaanMerchant Also, funny enough, others have used the #BakedPotatoWednesday hashtag.
@NomaanMerchant To quote Jean: "Drop the damn fork!" (I assume this was a roundabout endorsement of eating with our hands.)
@NomaanMerchant Beware: She also warned of potatoes
"Why would I want to see that movie again?" she asked.
After losing weight, she never again at one of those cookies, even as she allowed herself other indulgences.
Jean Nidetch's greatest vice: chocolate marshmallow cookies that she hid in the hamper and ate by the boxful in the middle of the night
Nidetch allowed herself some indulgences in her final years: Klondike bars, Coca-Colas, and sleeping in instead of a healthy breakfast
Weight Watchers founder Jean Nidetch goes to her grave having kept her weight off for more than 50 years.
The woman who founded Weight Watchers has died today. Jean Nidetch was 91.

@minasmith64 You haven't offered a single credible example of this supposed bias, leading me to believe you're seeing bias where none exists
@BAIntactivists Thank you -- yes, very different viewpoint across the Atlantic
@minasmith64 Still not certain what your complaint is, but I appreciate your perspective and think it's represented by others in the piece.
@minasmith64 since it's not a word recognized by many, it required a little explanation and I thought that was the simplest way
@minasmith64 didn't intend to be dismissive. Simply needed to say that word was one adopted by those who identify with the movement
@minasmith64 I do, yes. But giving a specific example would help me understand your point of view.
@mhkimmins Good question, but sounds like one for the CDC.
@minasmith64 I really don't have a position, but you'd have to be more specific if you want me to review this supposed bias.

The 507-page @theIOM report grew out of national conversations on death from the untrue claims of "death panels"

Frequent conversations about end-of-life wishes should take place throughout life, @theIOM says, starting in adolescence
@theIOM report says advance directives have been unpopular and ineffective

Only observed words from #caseyanthony was a very quiet mouthing of "thank you" to one of the officers walking her to her SUV
Protesters say they don't want to see #caseyanthony profit from her newfound fame. She left jail with just $537.68 from her inmate account.
#caseyanthony was followed to her wiaitng car by two officers carrying .45-caliber semiautomatic rifles and wearing green bulletproof vests
Hard to describe #caseyanthony from our 10 seconds together: she glanced upward, to the left, with a solemn look
Those of us inside could hear a burst of yelling once #caseyanthony walked out the door to freedom, but could no longer see her face
Her hair, in a tight bun. Her shirt, bright pink tee, by Polo. Her jeans, blue. Her sneakers, funky. Her stride, quick. #caseyanthony
Those of inside the jail for #caseyanthony release only witnessed about 10 seconds of her walking through the lobby
