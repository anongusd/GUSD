Only Congress and @realDonaldTrump can provide permanent protection for #Dreamers, which we can and must do.	Mr. President: Stop playing politics with these people‚Äôs lives. If you can‚Äôt lead, at least get out of the damn way.
So 800,000 #Dreamers remain in limbo today, uncertain of their futures in the only nation they‚Äôve ever known as home, because of @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs mendacity.
#DACA recipients will keep falling out of status, at a rate increasing exponentially to &gt;1,200 individuals per day, even as renewals are submitted &amp; processed. Out of status, they‚Äôll be subject to immediate detention/deportation &amp; will lose their right to work legally.
Though today was @realDonaldTrump‚Äôs deadline, court rulings have frozen #DACA where it is. Those court victories are welcome but impermanent, and don‚Äôt provide real relief for #Dreamers.
"We're gonna show great heart,‚Äù @realDonaldTrump said of #DACA and #Dreamers last month - but again, he was lying. He lied to the 87% of Americans who believe Dreamers should be allowed to remain in the U.S.

The @realDonaldTrump plan DOES include a section authorizing massive privatization of our public infrastructure. We shouldn‚Äôt sell our nation‚Äôs backbone to the highest bidder.
The @realDonaldTrump infrastructure plan offers only $200 billion in federal funding, hoping the rest will come from already-cash-strapped state &amp; local gov‚Äôts or the private sector. And Trump‚Äôs budget actually CUTS transportation budget by 18%.
You deserve a real infrastructure plan that truly creates jobs &amp; rebuilds America, not this sad joke from @realDonaldTrump that goes cheap and privatizes our assets. (thread)

When every talk about immigrants focuses on a few gang members among millions of hardworking people, you're probably racist. #SOTU
We are, and always have been, a nation of immigrants. #SOTU
My heart goes out to those families. But @realDonaldTrump again blames immigrants and refugees for increased crime and stealing jobs when data clearly shows they're largely not responsible for either. Shameful. #SOTU

Stock market gains don‚Äôt help the more than half of Americans who don‚Äôt have enough savings to weather a $500 emergency. What are you doing for them, @realDonaldTrump? One-time bonuses &amp; temporary tiny tax cuts don‚Äôt count. #SOTU
. @realDonaldTrump, your #GOPTaxScam was a gigantic giveaway to corporations &amp; the rich; you gave working families peanuts by comparison. You could‚Äôve just given tax cuts to working Americans if you actually wanted to help them. #SOTU
At least half of Americans don‚Äôt profit from a soaring stock market. What are you doing to improve their futures long-term, @realDonaldTrump? #SOTU
Facts matter, @realDonaldTrump. In 2017, the U.S. economy created fewer new jobs than in any year since 2010. And wage increases slowed in 2017 compared to the two years before. #SOTU
