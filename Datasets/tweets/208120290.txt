We are confronting a global public health threat. We need to harness science and policy to help our public health systems and researchers become nimbler in the battle against drug resistant pathogens. https://t.co/YbKkDuol2H
This will help the FDA identify research areas where regulatory science can support new antibacterial drug development.

It requires collaboration and coordination across multiple government agencies. https://t.co/qSidHll0HJ
[Gathering data on antimicrobial use and resistance] is essential to understanding the drivers of resistance in human and veterinary settings, and formulating appropriate responses‚Ä¶
In the animal stewardship space, we‚Äôre also committed to working with key stakeholders both domestically and globally to help users of antimicrobial products have the information they need to use these products in a judicious manner. https://t.co/qSidHll0HJ
The best way to prevent resistant microbes is to prevent patients from getting infections in the first place. By reducing hospitalizations that put patients at an increased risk of acquiring AMR infections, vaccines can be a critical tool in reducing the overall burden of AMR.
The FDA is also committed to facilitating innovation through proactive engagement with sponsors and researchers to identify and address challenges to the development and approval of novel and non-traditional antibiotic products.
One constructive way to start would be to develop innovative payment mechanisms that allow companies to capture a greater upfront share of the social value of antibiotic drug development.
If we want to maintain a robust pipeline for antibiotics, it is necessary to change the perception that the costs and risks of antibiotic innovation are too high relative to their expected gains‚Äîwithout weakening antibiotic stewardship.
To sustain a strong antibiotic drug pipeline, we need a combination of ‚Äúpush‚Äù incentives to support product research and development, and ‚Äúpull‚Äù incentives to attract more investment. #FDAatPew
Our new, comprehensive strategy is aimed at bringing all our centers‚Äô work together, via one platform, to address four key areas https://t.co/8vHLgIQoRh	‚Ä¢product development 	‚Ä¢antimicrobial stewardship	‚Ä¢development of tools for surveillance  	‚Ä¢advancing scientific initiatives
Most existing antibiotics are as old as the earth. They were screened out of nature where they resided, doing battle with bugs for centuries. We need to find new ways to safely accelerate this evolution in our laboratories. https://t.co/8vHLgIQoRh
We‚Äôre launching it in tandem with the release of the Center for Veterinary Medicine‚Äôs (@FDAanimalhealth) 5-year plan for Supporting Antimicrobial Stewardship in Veterinary Settings. https://t.co/qSidHll0HJ

Read @SGottliebFDA's full remarks here: https://t.co/2FaDzCCn62 and learn more about FDA‚Äôs #Biosimilars Action Plan here: https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq  #BAP https://t.co/iAVQlB003I
The FDA can‚Äôt do it alone. Effective market competition from #biosimilars depends on additional actions from our public and private sector partners to align reimbursement and formulary design to encourage appropriate biosimilar adoption. https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq https://t.co/OT507LT44K
‚Ä¶the FDA is seeking to strengthen its partnerships with regulatory authorities in Europe, Japan and Canada. Such partnerships can enable greater efficiency in developing safe and effective #biosimilars. https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq
Third, developing effective communications to improve understanding of biosimilars among patients, providers &amp; payors. And fourth, supporting market competition by reducing gaming of FDA requirements or other attempts to unfairly delay market competition to follow on products.
First, improving the efficiency of biosimilar and interchangeable product development and approval. Second, maximizing scientific and regulatory clarity for the biosimilars product development community‚Ä¶
Our #Biosimilars Action Plan applies many of the lessons learned from our experience with generic drugs to accelerate biosimilar competition with four key strategies #BAP https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq ...
‚Ä¶we‚Äôre not going to play regulatory whack-a-mole with companies trying to unfairly delay or derail the entry of #biosimilar competitors. We‚Äôre not going to wait a decade or more for robust biosimilar competition to emerge. https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq https://t.co/I0B5D5VJLH
‚Ä¶the advent of #biosimilar entry should also inspire entrepreneurs to invest in new technologies and develop new monopolies around better innovations. https://t.co/E56yIk3ol0
Biologic manufacturers have a right to defend their legitimate intellectual property interests. And we want them to continue to offer the benefits of improved versions of originator biologics. #biosimilars #BAP https://t.co/hPm4Loclr7
While the FDA has approved 11 #biosimilars through 2018, only 3 are now marketed in the U.S. . . .if Americans had the opportunity to purchase successfully marketed, FDA-approved biosimilar Rx drugs, they could have saved &gt;$4.5B in 2017 https://t.co/fMTueojfr3 https://t.co/BNPTfAMrJk
‚Ä¶savings estimates from expected biosimilar competition are large. They range from $54B from 2017 to 2026 according to a study by RAND, to as much as $250B from 2014 to 2024 from just 11 #biosimilars expected to be approved &amp; marketed according to a survey by Express Scripts. https://t.co/Qh3WBYLig0
Biologics represent 70% of the growth in drug spending from 2010 to 2015.  And they‚Äôre forecasted to be the fastest growing segment of drug spending in the coming years #biosimilars #BAP https://t.co/kvqql7stsu
Our plan is aimed at promoting competition and affordability across the market for biologics and #biosimilar products #BAP https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq https://t.co/gmIZSBfccw
and demonstrates the progress being made against the deliverables the President laid out.
.@SGottliebFDA is pleased to announce today that we‚Äôre releasing our #Biosimilars Action Plan. This plan is an important piece of the Administration‚Äôs bold Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices https://t.co/r9mtTH0nMq. . .
While less than 2% of Americans use biologics, they represent 40% of total spending on prescription drugs. So enabling a path to competition for biologics from #biosimilars is a key to reducing costs and to facilitating more innovation https://t.co/kvqql7stsu
Our ability to build a market for safe, effective #biosimilar products is key for patients and our nation‚Äôs health care system. It‚Äôs a key to promoting access and reducing health care costs. And it‚Äôs a key to advancing public health https://t.co/kvqql7stsu
In a few minutes, @SGottliebFDA will speak at @BrookingsInst about FDA‚Äôs new #Biosimilars Action Plan. We‚Äôll be live tweeting highlights from his remarks. You can also watch online here https://t.co/SER4eBVHOw Stay tuned!

The warning letters issued today are just one aspect of FDA‚Äôs Youth Tobacco Prevention Plan. The agency continues to enforce regulations aimed at addressing youth access to tobacco products, including e-cigarettes.
From January 2012 to April 2017, the National Poison Data System received 8,269 calls related to e-liquid exposure in children younger than six.
The continuing rise in popularity of e-cigarettes, which often use e-liquids, has coincided with an increase in calls to poison control centers and visits to emergency rooms related to e-liquid poisoning and other nicotine exposure.
The 13 warning letters FDA issued today to companies selling e-liquids that resemble kid-friendly food products are part of an ongoing effort to protect youth from the dangers of nicotine and tobacco products: https://t.co/kHFEiNwBdA https://t.co/GoG71WFT44

FDA Commissioner @SGottliebFDA gave the keynote address at the 41st Annual National Food Policy Conference. He discussed new details on FDA‚Äôs comprehensive Nutrition Innovation Strategy. https://t.co/xG0qMtF0Mm https://t.co/1tadOW37Re
‚ÄúLike our efforts to reduce tobacco use, our work in nutrition can do much to reduce the burden of chronic disease and the early death we see as a result of avoidable illness.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúWe plan to release the updated short-term targets in 2019, as well as continuing the dialogue on longer-term reduction efforts.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúExcess sodium in the diet results in hypertension, which increases the risk of strokes and heart attacks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm committed to advancing the short-term voluntary sodium targets.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important we take a fresh look at existing standards of identity in light of marketing trends and the latest nutritional science.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre launching a major educational campaign for consumers surrounding the new nutrition information consumers  will be seeing in the marketplace... including resources that put calorie information into context .‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúWe need to finish our work on menu labeling‚Ä¶ Beginning on May 7, consumers can walk into covered eating establishments across the country and know at a glance how many calories are in the foods they order for themselves and their kids.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúA second prong of our plan is to re-evaluate the ingredient information on food packages. Consumers want clean labels that are readable and understandable.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúAs another action step, we‚Äôll streamline our process for reviewing qualified health claims we receive from industry.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre asking what more we can do to encourage meaningful claims that reflect the latest nutrition science and could spur industry to introduce products that qualify for those claims. Healthy is one claim  we believe is ripe for change.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC https://t.co/b78JRhqrih
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre opening a docket and are holding a public meeting this summer where we can advance proposals to modernize our approach to better protect public health while removing barriers to innovation.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúIdentifying and encouraging food patterns that are consistent with the dietary guidelines, affordable and appealing is also a priority to fight social inequalities in health.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúConsumers value healthful ingredients 4x as much as brand recognition. The food industry is innovating to give people more of what they want.‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC
‚ÄúFDA regulates 80% of our country‚Äôs food supply, and we take this important role in our nation‚Äôs health very seriously. That‚Äôs why  I‚Äôm announcing a comprehensive multi-year Nutrition Innovation Strategy‚Ä¶‚Äù @SGottliebFDA #CFAFPC

In 2 weeks, FDA will convene an advisory panel of experts to help select strains for next season‚Äôs flu vaccines. It takes several months for flu vaccines to be produced so strains for next season need to be selected even before the current flu season ends https://t.co/iD75ajQ1jK
Because flu viruses can change their genetic make-up rapidly during the course of a single year, seasonal vaccines are unlike most other preventative vaccines, in that the strains contained constantly need to be adjusted based on the viruses expected to be in circulation.
To prepare for each flu season, FDA has a key role in selecting the strains to be included in the annual vaccine. Because there is often more than 1 type of flu virus circulating each season, vaccines are designed to target 3 or 4 of the most likely flu viruses of the season. https://t.co/fy3fZLTxSE
