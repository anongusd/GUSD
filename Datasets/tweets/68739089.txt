the best thing about the appointment of @MarkCalabria to run the GSEs is that the debate going forward will prove the complicity of @FannieMae and @FreddieMac in the financial crisis and how they did it using the backing of the federal government.

Looks like (based on our analysis) @FannieMae and @FreddieMac contributed around $15 billion to the federal treasury in 2018. question is will the @realDonaldTrump admin stop the net-worth sweep and add another $15 billion to the deficit that is rapidly approaching $1 trillion.

re @MilkenInstitute (2) the two are largely incompatible. Milken's plan would be to recap $FNMA $FMCC but maybe NEVER release them unless changes to the public mandate are made. the other plans seem like they are just get rich quick schemes for traders without fixing the problem
so appealing about the @MilkenInstitute plan for @FannieMae/ @FreddieMac is that it recognizes the inherent contradiction of the GSEs; unlike the banks, they have a PURE government mandate to spread home ownership but like the banks they are private co w shareholders. (1)

$FNMA and $FMCC are involved in one biz and one biz only: making sure there is a market for a product no other biz can or will sell, aka the fixed rate 30 year mortgage. and we're supposed to saddle taxpayers with that insanity while making so day traders and hedge funds rich? https://t.co/E0elKhivgY

@AndrewWoody10 u really need a class in finance and history of the financial crisis.
@AndrewWoody10 not every other company makes its money because it has the backing of the fed govt. without that backing $fnma and $fmcc dont exist. they make money precisely because they can borrow at treasury rates and package and sell MBS at higher rates
Be careful what you wish for there are competing agendas re the GSEs and one other thing -- the federal deficit is expanding which means govt needs money from the sweep https://t.co/jvZVDc0Gk2

@DavidWyss3 @Alec_Mazo Fanniegate is a euphemism for day trading so it's gonna be interesting how this unfolds and how free market conservatives rationalize the need for a government backed "business" the only reason $fnma makes money is because it's backed by the Feds and borrows at government rates
It's odd that the #fanniegate crowd is pinning their hopes on @MarkCalabria, a @CatoInstitute guy who in his heart of hearts would let $FNMA and $FMCC go the way of Lehman unless of course he's sold out his libertarian principles which is always a possibility

john coffee at columbia law doubts the criminal extortion angle of @NatEnquirer-@JeffBezos since money wasn't extorted. OK BUT @NatEnquirer did mention the impact of the story on shareholders of @amazon and the stock is off today and the enquirer was looking for relief from Bezos https://t.co/orJ5jU1vvw
A president, his favorite hit-piece tabloid, and the billionaire entrepreneur who says he's being extorted with "dick pics." no this is not a scene from @SHO_RayDonovan. its my next hit w neil @TeamCavuto and @FoxBusiness NOON
PG version of my latest tweet: In telling @NatEnquirer and David Pecker (and maybe @POTUS) "FU" @JeffBezos has underscored the meaning of "FU Money." That's because when youre worth $100 B creating a product people can't do without, disclosure of dick pics is not that important
@ruggkes @NatEnquirer my BET bezos has more on the counter puncher than the counter puncher has on him or else he wld have gone for the deal
(2) but if you understand Trump's anger (ive been told it burns red hot) about the wapo's coverage of him and his belief bezos (for reasons never quite clear) is directing it, you can begin to connect the dots with the @NatEnquirer since its been Trump's tool for years https://t.co/orJ5jU1vvw
key to this story IMHO is @realDonaldTrump obsession w @JeffBezos -- @washingtonpost connection &amp; his anger over what he believes in Bezos direct involvement in wapo's coverage of him. not saying its true--bezos has told a source of mine he "speaks to @PostBaron twice a year" (1) https://t.co/orJ5jU1vvw

There was NOTHING to clarify. my sources internally said they had the money for the bond payment. others said it was debatable. that was my info -- take it or leave it but it was the best pre earnings tell out there.

yeah i screwed this up ROYALLY LOL! https://t.co/d38KdlTEsh https://t.co/6OhjzzGEWo
to be fair, the rubber meets the road on $TSLA now; yes elon now may have the cash to pay the $920m in march but 4q ears are backward looking and now the real test comes
that is what i reported and here it is picked up by @SeekingAlpha https://t.co/d38KdlTEsh and i was 100per right based on what musk said today: "We have sufficient cash on hand to comfortably settle in cash our convertible bond that will mature in March 2019" https://t.co/oXTjtkDpWi
for the record (you can check my reporting) and much to the annoyance of the $TSLAQ morons i reported last week that my sources inside the co were saying $TSLA had the cash for the $920m payment. i also said pre earns there was a debate over that among others. AKA NAILED IT

listening to the Dems this morning back up @AOC 's weird plan to have a 70% tax rate on high earners, particularly the top 1%. btw the top 1% isnt exactly @WarrenBuffett; its more like a family of five living on Long Island w 2 earners making $480k and above
@Russian77027577 @CrimsonBoomer @RAMRANTS as i said thats called a limit
@Russian77027577 @CrimsonBoomer @RAMRANTS check the tax law there are limits and i dont think they cover martinis
@jeffreymbonilla i just dont think you can go back to the future; trumps tariff war is absurd because the economy of today is different than when those plants were closing in the 1980s and 1990s. the 70% rate would be absurd in this economy
great point here https://t.co/DLRtXDQsP0
@jeffreymbonilla we're also a much richer country; btw if you really were worried about income of low earners, you would also be again important low-skilled labor through immigration
why stop at 70%? just take it ALL. but remember if you take it all, that generally forces those high earners to either find tax shelters or move to the Caribbean or simply be less productive, which is the history of the 70% tax rate when we had them "not that long ago." https://t.co/C684ZAg2eM

@peterelkind @realDonaldTrump I'm a free market low tax guy BUT this tax cut was so heavily weighted to corporate rates that are (IMHO) the least efficient way to juice growth. That's because cos will do more stock buybacks than investment based on all historical data and that's what happened here

@Mikeromur1 im just giving scenarios and outcomes btw--hillary did win the pop vote and easy. she was close in texas and ariz. if she campaigned in those blue states and turned out her base she wld have won the electoral vote
now if the GOP surprises and keeps both the house and senate, traders tell me mkts could rip if the opposite happens, they say stocks will respond accordingly
dem operatives tell me they have trump where they want him. they are counting on taking governors of fla and ga, and the electoral apparatuses in those key states. they will then squeeze trump and cabinet w investigations etc that the house GOP thwarted and take the prez in 2020
2 visions of the LIKELY midterm outcome (dems take the house gop the senate) GOP operatives say they will push through more judges (which requires a senate vote) depict the dems as radical socialists as they ramp up their vendetta machine against trump and push a left wing agenda

Now from my GOP sources: They feel increasingly confident they can contain the damage to losing 20 seats keep control of the house and brace for open war w pissed off dems
Dems are ultra confident abt taking the house. if so a trio of anti @realDonaldTrump pols will likely chair these key committees: @RepCummings on @OversightDems @JerryNadler @HouseJudiciary and @RepMaxineWaters @FinancialCmte, thus promising 2 years of hell for @WhiteHouse
