#HR1112 would allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.
In 2015, 9 innocent people were gunned down at the Emanuel AME Church. Enough is enough. I was proud to vote for #HR1112 to close the #CharlestonLoophole, which allows someone to purchase a firearm even if their background check has not been completed within the 3-day period.

We must demand accountability at the EPA and I will commit to do so in my oversight roles on the Science Committee and Select Committee on Climate Change.
In the longer term, it compromises the ability of the EPA to attract people to their agency who are motivated by the agencies mission. This ultimately destroys the consent of the governed upon which our country is based.
The EPA is staffed with lifetime public servants who are committed to their mission.  But at the leadership levels, we have a President and an EPA administrator who see their role as being to reduce the regulatory burden on polluters rather than protecting the environment.
In Willowbrook IL, residents are fearful of rising cancer risks from a local facility that is releasing ethylene oxide but EPA has been too slow to monitor, collect data and determine if further enforcement actions are required.
If this was because there were no causes for inspections or violations that would be great news. But that simply isn't the case. In Illinois, the Region 5 office staffing is down by over 10%, leaving fewer bodies to monitor much less determine who should be inspected.
The job of the @EPA is to protect the environment. Under the Trump administration, that increasingly isn't happening. As reported, EPA inspections are at a 10 year low. https://t.co/feeHGzImqO

So today, let us celebrate Dr. King‚Äôs legacy as he celebrated his own life. Let us celebrate the progress we have made, while still acknowledging how far we have to go. And let us use this day to commit to ensuring that his dream will become our reality, in our time. #MLKDay
Not because he was proud of leaders who were sitting down, but because he found hope in the masses who were rising up.
Not because we are perfect, but because we aspire to a more perfect union. Not because we have achieved true justice, but because it's a privilege to bear witness to history‚Äôs great arc.
When he told that crowd in Memphis that day that the world was messed up, it was only after acknowledging that if he could pick any time in human history to be alive, that is the time he would choose.
We have made progress. But we still have far to go. Dr. King understood this, and was an optimist to the end.
And yet our nation is still sick. Trouble is still in the land. Privileged men of low character remain threatened by the realization of Dr. King‚Äôs dream. Those same men too often persist in the ‚Äúcruel jest‚Äù of telling bootless men to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps.
Today we celebrate his life. But more, we celebrate his vision of that promised land. Did he see the day when we would have an African American President? Did he see the day when we would swear in the most diverse freshman class in the history of the U.S Congress? I think he did.
He was assassinated the next day.
‚ÄúThe world is all messed up. The nation is sick. Trouble is in the land.‚Äù 		Martin Luther King Jr. spoke those words on April 3, 1968. Famously, he went on to say that he had been to the mountaintop.  He looked over the other side and he saw the promised land.

I completely agree with actions taken today to reprimand Rep. King. I only wish they had been taken sooner.
The House of Representatives is the chamber of the people-- all people. The long-running racially charged comments by Rep. Steve King have no place in the House. They are an embarrassment to the institution and it's Members.
