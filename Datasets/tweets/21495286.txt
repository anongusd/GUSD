Also, I understand the point about standardization and scaling, but there’s just no evidence that we can suddenly start building nuclear plants quickly. The US has turned on one new reactor since the mid-90s.

One more thing — “Tone down your planet-saving goals because it might be hard to get the votes for this non-binding resolution in a theoretical 2021 [2 years closer to apocalypse!] world where Dems control the government and got rid of the filibuster” is a hell of an argument.
RT @ndrew_lawrence: GRAPHIC DESIGN IS MY PASSION https://t.co/FyMkQ5VIDn
That’s enormously ambitious! Obviously! It’s such a weird argument to say that getting to 218 and 50 votes is difficult, so tone it down. Falling back on a “do what’s possible” argument rather than a “do what’s necessary” argument makes you a climate denier.
“Decarbonization” can’t happen separate from things like jobs or education or healthcare, at least not on the scale needed to actually zero us out on emissions. The way I see it, the GND so far is an acknowledgement that fixing climate change means fixing everything.
Also, a main complaint here is that there are non-climate goals mucking up the climate change-related agenda. Which entirely misses the point: climate change is EVERYwhere at this point, and certainly will be even more by 2030 or whenever. https://t.co/mvZQWxvYAi

@AOC Here’s what a Citi report found a few years ago: an “action scenario” where we try to fix climate change actually costs LESS than the “inaction scenario”!		Again, the speed required changes this. But still! It’s a great argument! https://t.co/6JN9sNMJC4
@AOC In other words: even if we did NOTHING to change what we’ve BEEN doing, there are still huge costs associated with energy, transportation, etc. Coal and natural gas plants don’t last forever! We’d build new ones, and dig up lots of dead dinosaurs!
I still think there's a huge missed opportunity in the messaging around the Green New Deal after reading through the doc @AOC released. Yes the speed is relevant, but no one talks about how much building out the traditional, non-green, fossil-fuel heavy infrastructure would cost.

There are WAY MORE anecdotes we could all dig up showing people’s lives ruined from an arrest for a bag of weed than he could dig up showing some brutal axe murder case — but to him, the axe murders are relevant while the black people losing jobs, homes, lives, etc are not.
Damn it, one more thing: 		Berenson is dismissive of the social damage the drug war continues to do to POC, hiding behind “data” on declining numbers in prison specifically for marijuana possession and such, but spends ENTIRE CHAPTERS on murder cases connected to weed.
@JodyShenn Maybe! I dunno! But I don’t think he knows either, or certainly didn’t prove anything in that regard.
Anyway, once again, don’t read the book. Read my piece on it and Gladwell (https://t.co/Bwg3Fb6ppV), or @aaronecarroll’s (https://t.co/VhfxjIXLAb) or @msamandalewis’s (https://t.co/yazB5MyWSQ) or @germanrlopez’s (https://t.co/jQ1sgvP5xu) or any number of others.
He doesn’t understand that you can’t just do some of your own, un-peer-reviewed math on data from a paper, come to a separate conclusion than that which is published in that paper, and claim the authors found what YOU found. 		Just for example. It’s all just so infuriating.
But there’s no book in that, obviously. So he ran with the scarier narrative that gets him invited on to Laura Ingraham’s podcast and so on.		The degree to which he doesn’t seem to understand how science works is truly remarkable, and if I were @simonschuster I’d pull the book.
I’ve said from the start, if your point was just, “there are gaps in marijuana research, and even a few somewhat disturbing safety signals, we should study those,” then we wouldn’t be having the conversation. That’s a fine thing to say!
I was gonna just be done with it, but man… he doesn’t make it easy.		1. I did find errors. Lots of them.		2. Though the “data” may be correct, his interpretation of them sure as shit is not.		3. The book’s point is clearly not to “present a biologically plausible thesis”! https://t.co/b0EFe5iVHb

A total of 474 players have scored at least 1 point in the #NBA this year. In the FIVE games James Harden scored 50 or more, he has more points in total than 227 of those players.		In other words, he needed five games to outscore what 48% of the league scored in ~45 games.

If anyone wants to talk bad science and bad science writing, let me on your podcast, I've got rants for DAYS at the moment.
I don't really know if the offer was $200 for EVERY factual error found, or just a one-time deal, but either way how about you just give it to these guys, maybe they can help get all the black and brown people you laugh off in the book out of jail: https://t.co/8Bsn1AM7E7
There is so, so much more in this book that, though the specific number cited may be correct, it represents a dramatic misreading of science, statistics, and logic. Really, it’s just rife with this shit.
Finally, the introduction to the book is titled "Everything You're About to Read is True." Which is clearly false. So that's another one.
1.5 billion, 1.3 billion, who cares -- the point is, this is just fucking lazy! And there's lots of that!
Here's a fun one that's pure factual and not that big a deal. "In a December 1978 article, the Washington Post estimated the size of the market at $350 million annually--about $1.5 billion in today's dollars.”		Hm, looks more like $1.3 billion? https://t.co/UgHWBUeWM6
Anyway there's plenty more in the violence data that may not quite qualify as a "factual error" but sure as shit qualifies as "dramatically misleading," read more in here: https://t.co/Bwg3Fb6ppV
But! This doesn't tell you anything! Here's just Colorado: rate rose 14.7% from 2013-2017. National increase? 17.8%. Oops!		I chose 4 other states where it wasn't legalized (AR, DE, GA, HI): murder rate rose 41.3% in that period! What could have caused it???
For the 4 states he cites combined (AK, CO, OR, WA), using raw numbers: 36.5% increase, not 35% (factual error!). HOWEVER: 45.5% rate increase. You could have been even more dramatic if you know to use the rate instead of the raw number! It's 1 column over in the FBI data!
The ways he plays with the murder rates in states where weed is legalized are legion. I'll try to be quick.		The national murder RATE increase, 2013-2017 was 17.8%, not "20 percent." If you use raw number of murders rather than rate: 20.7%. Fine, whatever. BUT...
I guess one could quibble if this is a "factual error," but man is it just outright wrong: "Almost no one noticed the National Academy Report.”		⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️⬇️ https://t.co/KmHUPcaEV4
Also: He mischaracterizes the study population. They are not "poor" women. They are "unstably housed women,” a group that I’m sure experts would say has specific characteristics that are relevant here. If you're claiming some monopoly on truth, don't get shit like that wrong.
Actual paper showed a BIGGER increase than "twice" -- 3.81 times (which, factual error!), BUT ONLY for non-medical cannabis. Medical cannabis had no association. And they didn't measure them combined.
There are a bunch of sins of omissions that I'd argue qualify as a "factual error." Such as: 		Berenson: A paper "that studied 245 poor women in San Francisco showed that those who used marijuana were more than twice as likely to use opioids as those who didn't.” ...
From the paper: "Medical cannabis laws were associated with lower rates of opioid analgesic overdose mortality, which generally strengthened in the years after passage."		Year 1: 19.9% lower rate.		Year 6: 33.3% lower.		That is the OPPOSITE conclusion.		https://t.co/S9DqsHcMK4 https://t.co/UY9y82Vxhh
Let's start with a paper that found an association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality. Berenson writes: "The reduction was greatest immediately after legalization but persisted afterward, the paper found." Except... no it didn't?

My #NBA conspiracy theory: 		Lebron is holding himself out for a bit longer than necessary because he wants to pass Jordan on the all-time scoring list against the Bulls, in Chicago. 		He needs 326 points, would take ~12 games at current pace. Bulls are 20 games away.
There are still 600,000-plus arrests for weed possession each year, but I’m sure the @ACLU and so on would be thrilled to hear from Berenson that it’s just not a problem anymore!		Anyway, don’t read the book, or Gladwell’s piece, they’re bad. 		https://t.co/Bwg3Fb6ppV
Berenson’s disregard for the social impacts of the drug war are INFURIATING. “…almost no one is imprisoned for possession anymore” he writes. And, even worse, he mocks: 		“Everybody knows Reefer Madness is a joke. Cops just want excuses to put black people in jail."
Anyway, I could go through a dozen more studies he, and by extension Gladwell, misinterpret in one way or another, but I’ll spare you.		Instead, one last point in honor of MLK Day...
Berenson, first line of epilogue: “This book could have been longer.”		Me: OH THANK GOD
The study literally found the opposite of what he wrote! The authors say the association “generally strengthened in the years after passage.” 19.1% reduction in deaths in year 1, 33.3% in year 6. 		I have no idea how you get something that wrong.
On a finding of a 24.8% reduction in opioid overdose deaths in states following weed legalization, Berenson: “The reduction was greatest immediately after legalization but persisted afterward, the paper found.”		This would be weird because the association should strengthen. BUT!
Anyway, getting from “drunk people in Ibiza get in fights sometimes” to “weed causes violence” is, uh, a stretch.		In other cases, Berenson literally just misread a study (if I’m being generous), and reported the opposite conclusion from what it really found. For example:
…he ignores OTHER things that raised your risk of fighting. Things like being young (4.57x more likely to fight), being male (3.16x), and being British. 		Four in five fights occurred when people were drunk, and more than 1/3 of the study qualified for that drunk 5x/week level.
…except among people who were drunk more than 5x per week. 		Some things: 95% of people in the study drank, so saying it doesn’t raise the risk is almost tautological — drinking is basically background.		Also, small absolute numbers: only 4.4% were in a fight. And…
I had to leave out a BUNCH of misrepresentations and statistical chicanery, but one I found interesting: Berenson cited a study and said that “cannabis doubled the risk” of tourists in Ibiza and Majorca getting into a fight. He noted that alcohol use did NOT change the risk…
Also, a book purporting to explain all the complicated science here DOES NOT HAVE ANY CITATIONS/ENDNOTES/BIBLIOGRAPHY. I spent a really fun weekend trying to find every bit of research he mentions.
A few observations/stray bits that I didn’t have room for in that piece: 		Berenson’s intro is titled “Everything You Are About to Read is True,” which, the author doth protest too much, methinks.

@NaomiC90 I don’t think he said the opposite, he just picked one specific conclusion — inhaled marijuana has limited data on its benefit to chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting — and ignored the other — oral cannabinoids have ample such evidence. It’s either lazy or misleading or both.
Also, my god Gladwell! Read the goddamn study! He clearly just read Berenson’s work and did no actual research of his own. Below are Gladwell version, Berenson version, and the study’s ACTUAL hypothesis. “Not associated” is NOT THE SAME THING as “predict the opposite”! https://t.co/1JeNQ36bVq
Also, further context to that study: of more than 12,000 high school students surveyed, almost 35% were involved in at least one fight over the past 12 months — and more than half of those had not used either alcohol or marijuana. So.
The Gladwell version ignores social context. Much like with supposed gateway drug effects, the act of buying weed can put one in situations where things like fights might be more likely — that’s not an effect of the drug itself, and in fact is an argument for legalization.
The study itself correlated recent (&lt;30 days) substance use with getting into more than 1 fight in the last 12 months. Getting into a fight is NOT the same as being “physically aggressive.” The study does use that language, but its actual data focuses on fights.
Whew, okay, back to the study I couldn’t find. Here’s how Gladwell characterizes its findings, about marijuana/alcohol use and aggression. He seems to have used the exact language from Berenson’s book, which… isn’t right. https://t.co/ofIxy9W8SE

Yes, he’s right that they say INHALED cannabis has limited data on this. But oral cannabinoids have an abundance of evidence, and they do in fact help a lot of people with nausea and vomiting. You have to say both things. Gladwell only said one of them, and sort of hid the other.

@ExtremeLiberal @Kat4Obama @housesciencegop @HouseScience I’m not sure who you mean here. The 168K followers were people following the main science committee account, so, theoretically, not really of one party or another. They’ve been shunted over to the GOP account now without really knowing it.

The president, who tweeted about Ebola 49 times in a one-month period in 2014 when he thought he could score some points against Obama, has not mentioned the outbreak in the DRC.
Ebola outbreak in DRC is up to 608 cases and 368 deaths. Though response is hindered by violence in the region, more than 54,000 high-risk individuals and healthcare workers have now been vaccinated.
Again, this is an example of government not keeping up with tech. The simple solution is that committee twitter accounts should be used for official business only (schedule, etc), and each party can have their own separate account if they want.
Some other committees seem to have just handed over the main account, though I haven’t checked them all.
House Science Committee’s account switched the handle to @HouseScienceGOP, instead of giving it to the Dems. So they took the 168K followers with them! The @HouseScience account used to be Dems' party-specific account and has only 16.8K followers. How is this fair??
So, there seems to be some issues with handing over Congressional twitter accounts from one party to the other. I have long railed about how weird it is that one party controls the committee account, when an actual hearing involves both parties. BUT — this is doubly weird. …

If you insist on using the asteroid: there are companies whose entire business model results in pulling that asteroid toward us at an increasing pace. Getting rid of them would probably get rid of the asteroid. Do the uh, math.
The fact that this is not remotely on the table, here or pretty much anywhere, is shocking.
The mayor of your town, concerned with your backyard shitpile and with the growing concern at its pace to engulf the entire town, might even try to pass some laws. Like, maybe even ban the shit producers!
In a rational world, you would realize those few companies were directly responsible for essentially the entire pile of shit in your yard, and you would STOP GIVING MONEY TO THOSE COMPANIES.
Coal, oil, and gas companies have one goal: make lots of money by continuing to pile shit in your yard. You are PAYING for them to do this. You get some ancillary benefits, like a decent chunk of your electricity, but you could get that from non-shit-producing sources.

Basically, the candidates did what I’ve seen a lot of, they equated climate change to a general environmentalism — we need to clean up the planet, etc. Maybe that’s useful, to connect them? I dunno, but I viscerally sort of hate it. It undersells the scale of the problem.

@Michael_Easter Thanks man!
So yeah, it’s not an asteroid, and we’re not a frog. We’re just casually hurling more and more shit into our own yard, day after day, and getting closer and closer to a permanently shit-stained existence.
Okay OBVIOUSLY not the issue here but who the fuck says “drew it” in regards to a report https://t.co/jLW71wcxBI
Even if it were logistically difficult, you would try extremely hard to find an alternative to your shitpile. Not because the shitpile will explode in exactly 10 years or something, but because you are slowly making your house and neighborhood completely unlivable.
Forget the fact that, in retrospect, what the FUCK were you doing piling shit up in your yard in the first place.		Instead, just think about the very first step you would take when confronted with such a dire future scenario: STOP PILING SHIT IN YOUR YARD.
Another 10 or 15 years beyond that, and your back door literally will not open anymore due to the giant pile of shit.		The entire neighborhood hates you, wants to move away but can't sell their houses because you fucked up their property values because of, you know, the shit.
You do some math based on your past shitpile trends, and you realize that by around 2030, you will be almost unable to go out your backdoor anymore due to the shit. You could just squeak out, but you'd be covered in shit quickly. Impossible to avoid any longer.
Every day, you add more shit to your pile. It's already kind of in the way, like to get our to your driveway you have to tiptoe around it, and it's definitely smelling up the neighborhood and you get tons of complaints.		But you just keep adding shit to the pile.
How about this. Imagine there is a giant pile of shit in your back yard.		You put it there. Maybe you own cows, or just a really prolific couple of dogs, or whatever. You look out the window, you see a giant pile of shit.
But that's not really how this works. The frog-in-boiling-water one annoys me also, partially because it removes any agency from the frog, though of course the asteroid one does that as well.		SO:
I keep thinking about the problem of climate change metaphors, and getting annoyed with the commonly used (guilty!) asteroid version. The problem is that it (and some of the IPCC 2030 messaging right now) suggests some definitive deadline—the moment the asteroid will strike.
Apparently some people cannot distinguish between a prediction — “this thing will happen” — and advocacy — “this thing should happen.”		So, here’s this again if you want to yell at me some more.		https://t.co/zK5yynHeyp

@lyndalovon Ok. If you see it that way, that’s fine I guess. Honestly though, I have no idea how that bit — a speculation on what future humans will ask, not a push for any course of action today — can constitute advocacy. I think you’re seeing what you want to see. But thanks for reading.
@lyndalovon Yes. I did not write that it is a good idea, or that we have anywhere near enough information to decide or do it well. I said it will happen anyway.

Santorum cribbed from a WSJ op-ed that used a Cato Inst. brief that got EPA’s science dramatically wrong, a fun bit of whisper-down-the-lane ratfucking. 		They claimed that EPA assumed a huge number of pregnant women subsisted by catching and eating six pounds of fish per week.

Graham, Cornyn, Corker et al believe Kavanaugh because they WANT to believe him, and that’s pretty much it. They refuse to confront that this world so many of them came from is just rife with shittiness, and should obviously be shunned and essentially dismantled.

Anyway, this is a national travesty regardless of the final number, and the administration refused to release information on if or how they changed anything in terms of hurricane response when I FOIA’d it, so, this all sucks. 		https://t.co/I72Ay9I9ZZ
I don’t have an answer for when to cut off the count. But if they are now getting better at marking a given person’s death as related or unrelated to Maria, then I’m not sure why we have to stick with this 2,975 number either. It’s higher. It is FOR SURE higher.
There were reports of increases in suicide rates, of continued lack of access to clean water, of power outages affecting many long after it had supposedly been restored.		If the deaths in February 2018 count, shouldn’t the ones in March and April also count? May? June?
In the new report, excess deaths from September to December = 2,098.		If you extend to February, you get almost NINE HUNDRED more deaths. 		So why stop there if there are so many people still dying as a result of the storm and lack of government response???
But in the case of Maria, much of the mortality was from after the storm, when access to water, health care, etc was dramatically limited. 		As I’ve ranted about before, this didn’t necessarily stop at 12/31, or at 2/28.		https://t.co/mK9F1zt19o
Which of those are better? Or neither?		The new study out today highlights how the original government count of 64 deaths was obviously inadequate because it could only handle obvious, direct mortality — flying debris, drowning in flood water, etc.
My main problem has to do with cutoff dates. In this case, the researchers examined from September through February 2018 to arrive at the 2,975 deaths.		The NEJM study (https://t.co/bl64DGYT6h) that used a simple survey to extrapolate to 4,645 deaths used a cutoff of 12/31/17.
Okay as each of these studies comes out I guess we’re slowly zeroing in on the actual number of deaths Hurricane Maria caused in Puerto Rico, but I STILL have some issues with methodology.		https://t.co/V4I60EP46d

There is also a “continuous efflux of refugees” to neighbors Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania.		Further complicating things is the fact that DRC is currently experiencing multiple OTHER disease outbreaks, including polio, measles, and cholera in 12 provinces. Oh, and monkeypox.
This is worse than earlier Ebola outbreaks in DRC because of its location: North Kivu and Ituri provinces are heavily populated areas, and are also highly unstable. WHO says the region is "experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis."
Up to 72 dead (44 confirmed) in the DRC in ongoing Ebola outbreak.		As of the last official situation report 5 days ago, 1,782 contacts of people with Ebola were still under surveillance. https://t.co/7wadNGBj29

Burn it all, release about 12 billion metric tons of CO2 — and that’s before you even include the natural gas part of it.		That’s more than twice US yearly output of CO2. And a Congressional committee is essentially advertising for this plan.
By the way, the story the committee tweeted out says the North Slope has 28 billion barrels of recoverable oil (and 50 trillion cubic feet of natural gas). That’s almost TWICE what the region has produced so far, in total.
@BenGoldey Yes, of course. But there aren’t majority and minority hearings. The main account for every committee is by far the more followed account.

I’d be curious to hear how the more rabid Nixon supporters among GOP senators/members of congress acted in the aftermath of his downfall. Like, did they pretend they never supported him? Brushed it off like he had deceived them?		Just want to know what to expect this time.
Seriously, these are the options: 		1) Continue on current path, make slightly less money but avoid killing 1400 people per year		2) Change paths BACK to what you used to do, make slightly more money, kill 1400 people per year.		Only sociopaths and corporations choose 2.
No wonder this place is so quiet at the moment https://t.co/ziL4gHYUrL
So yes, obviously, blame the Trump admin for creating the space in which those liquid energy companies can let their murder flow.		But also blame the actual people running those companies, because they COULD just say “no thanks, we’d rather not kill people if we can help it."
But in this case, the up-to-1400 deaths were GONE from the system, under the CPP. Yes, not all the tech was in place etc, but still — this is a conscious decision to make things worse and thus kill a bunch of people in the process.
I recognize that all regulation sort of works this way. BUT: this particular regulation is an explicit step backward.		In the past, regulations would force an industry to do better — safer, cleaner, etc. They would improve the tech, or spend more money, and they’d get there.
They would have complied with the Clean Power Plan and NOT killed those 1400 people, and under the new rule they would make a proactive decision to kill them, and somehow the people running those companies don’t just get charged with mass murder. 		It’s insane.
We’ve essentially accepted that in our system, big industry like energy or chemical or whatever acts sort of like a liquid. They fill whatever space is offered to them.		In this case, the “space” is literal murder by pollution, disproportionately of black and brown people.
I’m still stuck on how easily we let the energy companies/utilities off the hook when talking about the Trump admin’s new horrible energy rule.		“Trump admin plan would kill up to 1400 people annually.”		Okay, but really it’s that the plan would ALLOW the emitters to do so.

Anyway, take-homes are that you should use absolute numbers when you can, report the adjusted results, and that Facebook is very bad.
Also, the authors note that bad-FB use is correlated with “observable municipality characteristics.” So, as they should, they adjusted for those.		That decreased the effect size by “about 30%” (0.533 down to 0.369) though it did not change the statistical significance. https://t.co/oC6Vg0tLlZ
For example—in Dresden, a high-bad-facebook-use city, effect was an additional 0.043 attacks per 10,000 asylum seekers. In Frankfurt, with lower use, it was 0.029 attacks/10,000.		Obv, any attacks are horrifying, and that FB does seem to increase them is noteworthy. But, yeah.
So this really is an interesting study and it’s worth your time as Max says but this stat should not stand alone. It is a relative increase, and the absolute numbers—as well as an analysis that included “baseline control variables”—should be included to get the full picture…. https://t.co/jz0X69QsMa
I know this is no different than the past, but it is an interesting formulation for thinking about regulation.		“Regulate me, or I will kill 1,400 people every year."
Like, if those companies were GOING to comply with the Clean Power Plan, and thus NOT kill 1400 people/year, that means not killing them is an option.		This new rule would let them out of the requirement, and it is just assumed that they will then proactively decide TO kill them.
There’s an interesting/obvious indictment of capitalism in here too — those 1400 people will die because energy and utility companies simply don’t care that their choices and policies are killing them. https://t.co/AeDoljHGW6

Unless I’m reading this wrong, the EPA’s own analysis of the ACE rule shows billions of LOSSES on a full cost-benefit analysis, using literally any of their measured scenarios. https://t.co/PueWjoWyrI
The rest of the EPA’s section on employment impacts is just a list of power sector demographic stats, and mentions of previous studies showing how unemployment’s bad. There isn’t any actual analysis of impacts of THIS rule.		Something to keep in mind as they try to sell this.
More EPA on its own dumb rule: “These employment impacts, both negative and positive, are likely to be smaller in magnitude than those” caused by the CPP. 		¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Also, one of the biggest claims about the CPP and power sector regulation more generally has been some supposedly giant impact on employment. Well, per the EPA:		“...even a large-scale environmental regulation is unlikely to have a noticeable impact on aggregate net employment."
So, Trump’s Clean Power Plan replacement will result in as much as 10% increases in coal for electricity, but will MAX out at a 0.5% drop in retail electricity prices, in 2025. By 2035, it’s essentially 0%. https://t.co/K2pPHXvP05

And meanwhile even the Dems, ostensibly the responsible party of climate action, are like “nah we’re gonna take that oil money actually,” highlighting how NONE of the supposed adults in the room seem to have any sort of grasp on the gravity of the problem.
Virtually the whole Congress thinks nothing of that $700 billion-plus Forever War budget but the odds of putting even a few extra billion toward, you know, SAVING THE WORLD are approximately zero.
Manhattan Project took up 1% of federal outlays; today, the fed gov spends $4 trillion/year (underestimate, I think) now, and $40 billion for mitigation plus adaptation honestly feels far too low if you were serious about this.

Here are the threads from when that Harvard NEJM study came out using a survey to estimate the mortality rate. I still think the number is underestimated, IF you include indirect mortality and extend the dates, which makes sense to me.		https://t.co/mK9F1zt19o
Then it mentions that "other studies range from about 800 to 8,500 deaths from delayed or interrupted health care." 		So. Yeah.
So, the government of Puerto Rico is STILL being weird about the deaths caused by Hurricane Maria. Yes, they have a new study likely coming out in a few weeks, but this is the ONLY mention in the new report, with NO info on where the number comes from! https://t.co/kjmqKF3Sl5

@RogerPielkeJr ...my guess is -- and it is a guess, to be clear -- is that it is more reflective of the time since the AR5 than any particular take on the AR5's accuracy or legitimacy.
@RogerPielkeJr But a general look at Google Trends doesn't really tell you that, does it? If ALL "climate change" or "global warming" stories have fewer IPCC mentions, that isn't specific enough to conclude that stories on those outlier-type events/concepts are "ignoring" IPCC conclusions...
@RogerPielkeJr ?? Not sure if you got my point. I'm saying it isn't necessarily being "ignored" because of somewhat fewer mentions in news stories. Or maybe I missed your point instead?
So the fact that the IPCC's 5th assessment report was finalized the previous year had nothing to do with more frequent mentions back then? We're almost directly in the middle of the long gap between reports. But sure, it's being "delegitimized." https://t.co/ijwFmgVNOk
