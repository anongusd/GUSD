I can listen to the National Anthem everyday and to me it‚Äôs meaning will never fade, and it‚Äôll be a constant reminder of the price of freedom.
I have not watched a single @NFL game this season. Now, the plan to keep players in the locker room during the national anthem is just symptoms that the league‚Äôs leadership can‚Äôt control their own organization. As for me, I only kneel for Christ Jesus and for our fallen Troops.

@SeekingHim4Life thanks. I need to get a software today for a school assignment. I think I found one called Natural Reader.
@SeekingHim4Life thanks. I talked to them this morning but it only reads what it‚Äôs spoken. I have a speech impairment so‚Ä¶it won‚Äôt work. :(
@LadinoTurk Thanks Guy!
@BonnieBoat TY for the words of encouragement!
Can anyone recommend a text-to-speech software that will allow to record what is being read? Thanks!
@BrittaDragice @Vets360 healing is the goal. Acceptance and transcendence are key to healing.
@SamCl I will not withdraw. Will push on. Relaxation will be there when victory is reached. :)
@Vets360 thank you too. Your mission is one that is greatly needed. Thanks for doing all you do! Feel free to reach out anytime.
Decided to take 3 classes this summer. Maybe I over did it but... I will never accept defeat. Right?
