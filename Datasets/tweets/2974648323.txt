Good step in the right direction is HR 1994, the VA Accountability Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. Read at https://t.co/BdH9QtrUcI #VFW
Members of Congress must set aside differences to ensure that the VA properly serves the men and women who have served our country. #VFW
Disappointed in POTUS‚Äô #VFW speech. #Veterans don't need partisan attacks, they need care and respect through the VA.
Also #IranDeal does not have any real mechanisms to ensure Iran will uphold its end of the bargain. This is unacceptable- we can do better.
Biggest concern w #IranDeal is it doesn't have a generational timeframe. Instead allows Iran to build on its nuclear program within a decade
I‚Äôve been reading the proposed #IranDeal and I have to say there are a lot of disturbing and disappointing parts to it.
