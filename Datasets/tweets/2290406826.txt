@murti_bing @Jim_Jordan So this is Republicans fault we can't get the government reopened and American employees their pay?  Hey Jim! Tell your party members to get their act together and get the government open. It a record-breaking historic shutdown. Not the kind of negative publicity you guy's want.
@herbiechar @Jim_Jordan He promised his voters Mexico was going to pay. He even had press conference with the President of Mexico while he was campaigning. He told potential voters in 2016 "The US will not be paying for the wall" and "Who will pay for the wall? Mexico will pay for the wall."
@Jim_Jordan The president needs to come to his senses and realize this isn't the way to get what he wants.

@wdunlap @charliekirk11 I don't care what happened in the past.

He told his voters Mexico would pay for it. 3,000,000 more Americans voted not for this.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump Yes, it does come across the border but the majority is through border checkpoints that have nothing to do with a wall. Yes, you are sharing facts, but don't stand up with an argument for using my tax dollars for his wall. Supporting this shutdown is morally wrong.

What I recommend to everybody is DO NOT RETWEET this caravan story. This is what makes Republicans excited.
@MSNBC There is already absurd falsities coming out from Fox and the others. Expect the news reports streaming to Republicans to get even more absurd to try and bring out the Republican vote.
@MSNBC As long as Fox News viewers think this, it will bring these Republicans out to vote.
@Number_Keeper I'm not saying this 4,000 carvan will be the end, BUT think about it. Republican canidates will play this up to the max if they keep moving north until Election Day.
@Number_Keeper If only these people understood the importance in waiting three weeks, just three weeks until the US elections are over.
@invalididentit2 Republican voters are the target here. He will play on this --&gt; how dangerous it is and why you need to get out and vote Republican.
@Number_Keeper They have not turned back. They are at the border fence between Guatemala and Mexico. Fear-mongering Republican politicians LOVE this kind of story.
@Number_Keeper All of the sinclaid stateions are livstreaming this on social media. It's chaotic. Children and adults trying to climb the fences and apparently angry and frustrated. From what I hear it's chaotic.
He pulled a publicity stunt signing some kind of water diversion scheme in California to energize rural Californians.
I cannot think of a worse time for a caravan of 4,000 crisis. Less than three weeks till election day and Donald is using this. He's shouting "criminals!" loudly while answering the press. --&gt; Let's get this election thing over please.
@invalididentit2 No, this is a Republican voter energizer. The more this stays in the new, the better change of Republicans at the polls.
Does anybody know what Donald just signed concerning Califonians supposedly not getting access to water?
If this caravan story continues, it could bring Republicans out in droves to vote.
Is doesn't help to have a reporter bringing up the migrant caravan in Guatemala that is NOT moving forward at this time. This is an energizing story for these Republicans. Donald is right now responding to that reporter saying "a high percentage are criminals!"

I happen to read and know that entire groups of thousands of animals and plants went completely extinct during a climate change event over a period of a few thousand years. This human-induced climate change is happening over three hundred years and 140 of that already passed.
@educatormary So true.
The REAL "appocalypse" isn't going to be some religious biblical story repeated by a Southern Baptist minister in Oklaholma, it's going to be a climate change catatrophe that NASA and about every other science community member has repeated will happen soon if ignored.
Working in a store two years ago, it was March, snowing (very common here in Ohio). Man comes up: "whaddya think about this global warming? Ha, ha, ha!" Now THESE are the complely foolish rural Republicans I'm referring to voting these people like Jim Jordan into power.
All because Republicans didn't or wouldn't believe in climate change and the science community warned about for over 40 years. We cannot allow our country to continue being ruled by stubborn rural Republicans that are blindly clueless about what's to come. https://t.co/yf7dk97r9a

Has to be two reasons: 1. They don't like the fact these women spoke out supporting Dr. Ford who represents assault survivors. And you know there has to be sexual assaults happening for eons in that male-dominated mormon community. 2. These men don't want women to win.

Why the hell would the head of the mormon church want to have women get off social media for a week when midterm elections are three weeks away and there are Mormon women running for office in Utah?
The only way to break this control is to replace them. The only way to replacing that stubborn good 'ol boy Republican leadership in Washington with Democrat women. It's like washing away a stubborn red stain.
And they don't allow women into the higher leadership roles, especailly not minsters.

Some of these elections in November are going to get so close, people will be hanging off their chairs on the 6th. One undecided voter voting Republican can change the course of history for millions of Americans.
@Hiredgunz98 @Bencjacobs I love taylor swift.
@Bencjacobs If he gets enough exposure and it means one more black vote for a Republican. It can mean the loss of everything we have fough for as Democrats. Coverage of this meeting by the press only gives DT and K west more exposure. Getting exposure is how Donald got to where he is now.
@Jimi_Jammin I'm with you on thinking hes absurd for siding with the Don. But there are undecided voters not interested in politics that don't understand. This is pure publicity for K. West and more importantly, King Donald. Only one more vote can win an alection for a Republican in Nov.
@Brian_Chovanec Some of these elections would come down to 5 voters more voting Republican.
@Brian_Chovanec Can we afford to take that gamble?
We may think K. West is a joke supporting Donald, but there are still undecided voters and retweeting this K. West puts our cause to get rid of this Republican plague at risk.
@USATODAY I will not retweet anything with K. West. This is pure publicity stunt to get black voters voting for Republicans.
I will repeat again: DO NOT RETWEET K. WEST. They want publicity. Yes, he is absurd. They want the black vote in November. I will not retweet anything with K. West.
@Kokomothegreat AS much as I think this man is absurd. I WILL NOT post or retweet any K West meeting with Trump. It only give this man more publicity. Think about it. They want to get the black voter out voting for Republicans. West wants more following. It's a publicity stunt. No women there.

@invalididentit2 The fact is every major developed nation has to have some taxation on its citizens to provide high quality programs that improve it's citizens standards of living. Republicans want zero taxes, which sounds wonderful but some unfortunate citizens are going to suffer under that.
Entire decade passed since the Great Recession of 2007 while Bush was President. A lot happens in ten years. Economy comes back on it's own. Yes, on it's own. A president doesn't magically "bring an economy back". It's an economic cycle. Consumer protections were lifted in 90's.
Now again going into how low the women and black unemployment rate is. Two groups of Americans he gets very low support from. Entire decade has passed since the Great Recession while "W" was President. Republicans had lifted consumer protections from banks and it had begun.
@MichaelCBender @Acosta Best news I've heard all day!
This whole Republican argument that Democrats only want to raise your taxes is a complete FEAR monging tactic. Democrats are the last group of leaders that want the middle class to be financially hurt. We think the wealthiest in a country should pay a larger % than the poor.
One major problem with this Republican/Conservative model of government is that citizens are going to get shafted somewhere along the way. Somebody with a "pre-existing condition" (a term used only in the USA) won't be able to find healthcare because privatization is their dream.
What Republicans mean by "reform welfare" is ENDING government assistance programs. It's a huge differnce betwee Democrats and Republicans. They believe the smaller a government can be (fewer programs) the better it will be.
Donald now attacking the Republican's opponent: "David's opponent is a radical Democrat. He'll take your ethanol away and raise your taxes."
To say ANY president is personally responsible for a good economy is not being realistic.

@Stop_Trump20 There should be dead fish under that Red Tide wave. What it's telling us, is that we need to work 100% harder getting people aware of what's at stake if conservatives and Trump Supporters win even more power in November. Democrats need to win this November. Losing not an option.

Come to think of it, Hope Hicks knowingly passing on white lies from Donald Trump to the American people would fit perfectly into the Fox Entertainment family of liars.
"White House communications director Hope Hicks was pressed about whether she had ever lied for President Donald Trump -- and acknowledged she has had to tell what amounted to white lies, according to a source with direct knowledge of her testimony." https://t.co/duTEKPaDTh
Only Faux News would hire someone as Director of Communications that had admittedly passed on Trump lies to the American People. https://t.co/RxGN0zsfAd
Hicks will serve Fox as Chief Comm. Officer. She'll report to chief legal policy officer V. Dinh. Republican announced resign in Feb. as comm. director for Trump after testifying before House Intelligence Committee she’d made “white lies” behalf of Trump. https://t.co/FBCmMkIw90
Hope Hicks admits she tells 'white lies' for Trump but not about Russia inquiry https://t.co/V6t7h7VEAZ
@OMGno2trump @thousand_points Kavanaugh clearly lied under oath about his drinking problem and the references in his year book. He should have been under a polygraph before this swearing-in. Now Republicans think Kavanaugh should sue his accusers of lying.
@TheDemCoalition @VLeeWalker2 Kavanaugh clearly lied. He lied about his drinking problem and lied about the text references in his yearbook. A man who clearly lied under oath should never have been allowed to become a U.S. supreme court judge, let alone any judge. Integrity under oath. It was not. He lied.
She could deliver little white lies working for Trump, so she passes the test for Fox Entertainment. https://t.co/LqErnIefsu via @deadline

@DylanByers @Bencjacobs @JasonAbbruzzese Oh course, Faux News. The woman who delivered those little white lies of the President's. This is getting beyond absurd.
I'm tired of wasting valuable time debating over somebodys opinion when data and proof in writing and numbers saves so much time.
Well, what did you expect when the Trump FBI inquiry wasn't a proper investigation? Did he think Americans would simply settle into their seats and say OK, I'm fine knowing Kavanugh might be a complete liar sitting on the Supreme Court? https://t.co/wkGbVJ9eCK
@ABC Well, what did you expect when the Trump FBI inquiry wasn't a proper investigation? Did he think Americans would simply settle into their seats and say OK, I'm fine knowing Kavanugh is a liar sitting on the Supreme Court?
Nobody that clearly lies under oath should EVER be sworn in as of all things a U.S. supreme court judge. That person on record as a liar should not ascend to the highest courts in our land. Actually, any court. A liar should not serve on any court.
The insult to the American people was when Kavanaugh clearly lied. He lied about his drinking problem of the past and lied about what he said in his year book during the time that Dr. Ford said she was physically held down and mouth covered. https://t.co/xpi2pg5Ut6

Guns aren’t the problem and climate change isn’t real. Who else doesn’t care for facts and scientists? Which Republican is next?
If anybody wants to debate with me about firearms, they need to have data and proof to post rather than option.
The reason why the US is screwed on firearm-related deaths is because too many people cannot look at the data and see the first thing people reach for is a gun and it’s easier to find one when there is over three million circulating around and they are easily accessible.
@Concern18017148 @BrianVyy @_Michelangelo__ @lawprashant @ABC @GOP @realDonaldTrump I wouldn’t focus on them rigging machines, they had gerrymandering which is actual evidence they suppress. Now what I would do is start posting promos for your favorite Democrats.
@_Michelangelo__ @Concern18017148 @BrianVyy @lawprashant @ABC @GOP @realDonaldTrump Don’t be too overconfident though.
@GymKlieber @SherrodBrown @WhitfordBradley @ChrisCoons Oh a spaghetti squash. That’s better.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC Racism is the reason we have the second to highest gun-related homocide rate? I would like to see that data.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC You are accusing Americans of having evil hearts rather than looking at the reason so many firearm-related deaths occur in the USA. This is an American problem, and it’s not having enough religion in our lives or being exposed to violent of media. Data doesn’t show that.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC They have way fewer deaths by firearm.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC I do have every intention of getting to the facts.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC I guarantee you there is income inequality in the other countries I listed with MUCH gun-related homocides and MUCH fewer weapons per citizen.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC What type of “more hate” are you referring to?
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC Show some data.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC And they have much fewer church attendees and religion in their lives that in the US. Same movies, music, and games. Actually, the media people in those nations are exposed to has more violent content.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC Well if you can show me some kind of data that shows Americans have more evil in their hearts vs hearts in Germany, Australia, Netherlands, Spain, The United Kingdom, and France, provide it rather than running on speculation, because those nations have much lower gun- homocides.
@BenjaminCheek3 @vandusen_cheryl @ABC It’s so easy when all a person has to do is squeeze a trigger.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC Another thing I’d like to know: if Cain killed Able, how did they get a descendant to continue the human race without any woman around? The story is BS.
@BenjaminCheek3 @vandusen_cheryl @ABC American gun enthusiasts continually choose to ignore the stats and facts. They won’t look to see we have the highest suicide by firearm rate of any major developed nation. The USA sits right below Brazil in total gun-related homocides. Brazil, the the USA.
@vandusen_cheryl @ABC It isn’t America citizens having less heart. That’s not what the data shows if people would care to look: The United States has more weapons per citizen than every other major developed nation, AND the highest gun homocide rate of any major developed nation. Looking at fact.

@markitgeek @robbyj62 @LadyReverb @davidsirota @DrJillStein That's precisely why Danny O'Connor lost. That was the amount ov votes he needed to win in @OhioDistrict12. Instead, we ended up with a Trump-kissing anti-environment career politician.
@markitgeek @robbyj62 @LadyReverb @davidsirota Voting green party is what kept Democrat @dannyoconnor1  from winning Central Ohio, a Republican stronghold. I busted my butt trying to get him into congress and the green party got about 1,400 votes, the amount Danny needed to win. Now we have anti-envirnoment Trump-hugger.

@robbyj62 @LadyReverb @markitgeek @davidsirota We do have younger canidates up for election. We must vote for them. If we do not, the Republicans weill again continue their path of program shuttering and any chance of helthcare for all will be greatly diminished. I am voting 100% Democrat in November.

@CRKittle @SusieJustsayin @Jeffrey_Bailey1 @Sen_JoeManchin You raise a good point.
@bravoloverfan @SusieJustsayin @Sen_JoeManchin I'm guessing she's an evangelical Republican and it's all about abortion. For so many of these evangelicals, they want Trump in power for that reason alone.
@SusieJustsayin @Sen_JoeManchin HOW is he on the "right side of history"? Kavanaugh lied during his testimony. More than once.
@Sen_JoeManchin And I want to add that as much as I fight for Democrats bevcause we need them in places so har-core pro-Trump like West Virginia, I cannot support your campain if you vote yes to this confirmation. Lives are on the line. I care too much about our national healthcare.
@Sen_JoeManchin As a Democrat who's very active on social media, I cannot support any Democrat canidate voting yes to hard-core conservatives. I don't think it's right for the country and that's why I support Democrats on social media. I will not be promoting your campaigns if you vote yes.
Any Democrats out there, in particular Senator Joe Manchin: I'm not supporting you on social media supporting Kavanaugh. Can't afford having a judge writing hard-core conservative-leaning columns in journals and then say's he's non-partisan in his judgements. We know the outcome. https://t.co/lVAISd4Jqf

Having a Democrat in West Virginia means nothing at this point.
I cannot belive ANY Democrat would want to vote yes to Kavanaugh having a life-time appointment on the Supreme Court. Even if this Democrat is from Trump-Hugging West Virginia.
Please vote for Democrats at every election. This country cannot afford to go through this mess again.  To those who seem to not care about elections, get with the program.
