Tony Evers has been elected governor of Wisconsin.		It is over.
The results from western state -- still taking coming in but beginning to clarify -- as well as the late numbers from close races in Virginia, New York and other states, are pointing toward Democratic victory in the race for control of the U.S. House of Representatives,
Kris Kobach has been defeated for governor of Kansas. This win by Democrat Laura Kelly is a huge deal. First, a D has won in Kansas. Kansas! Second, an extreme right-wing Trumpkin Republican--who lied about voter fraud and so many other issues--has been rejected in a red state.
Big win in WI for Senator @tammybaldwin, who was attacked by Trump and the Koch brothers yet confidently voted against the Kavanaugh nomination, embraced #MedicateForAll and spoke up for #Dreamers. Like @SherrodBrown, Baldwin is a progressive D who won a state Trump won in 2016.
Huge lead for @SherrodBrown in Ohio. He’s running 7% better than Trump did in OH in 2016. Something to note when considering 2020 prospects. Could a progressive populist like Brown—as presidential or vice presidential contender—win back Great Lakes battleground states for the Ds? https://t.co/l8sRphWRSv

#BrettKavanaugh is the kind of man that Trump and Grassley and McConnell imagine a “great intellect” sounds like. But anyone who has watched Kavanaugh testify before the Judiciary Committee (or appear on Fox) recognizes that is an inflated assessment.	https://t.co/wqTs5eGi7l

The @nytimes oped suggests that Donald Trump is a narcissist who struggles to focus. But right-wing ideologues have surrounded him, imposed a form of efficiency and begun implementing their agendas. We should fear Trump, and we should fear the oped author. Both are dangerous.
Nothing in the @nytimes op-ed matters half as much as what Donald Trump tweeted on Monday. The president of the United States openly pressured the Department of Justice to politicize prosecutions of members of Congress.		This is the highest of high crimes.	https://t.co/S8YUdaR2He

Worldwide, more than 80 journalists were killed while on the job last year. Today, we have seen 5 people die in an attack on a Maryland newsroom. We don’t know the motive.

There are a lot of reasons to be skeptical about a @senatormikelee nomination to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy. But the truth is that Lee’s too independent — especially on imperial presidency, separation of powers — to be a Trump pick. https://t.co/NlEcUFz4Sd
The ⁦@nytimes⁩ refers to ⁦@Ocasio2018⁩ as “a liberal” in a headline today.		Actually, she beat “a liberal,” after running a campaign in which she proudly identified as a “democratic socialist.” https://t.co/Ms8D8FwHsv

As she challenged a 10-term incumbent who had a huge fund-raising advantage, @Ocasio2018 highlighted her democratic socialism.		In the old calculus, that seemed like a recipe for defeat.		In the new calculus, that seems like smart politics. @DemSocialists.	https://t.co/tZRl8BVzYO
Anthony Kennedy biography:		Reagan pick. Wasn’t quite as bad as expected. Still bad on a lot of stuff. Soon to be gone. Soon to be forgotten.		OK, that’s finished.		Now, let’s get down to the serious work of making sure he is not replaced by someone worse.	https://t.co/MiGM93lioQ
A miserable day sends an unmistakable message.		The #JanusDecision’s judicial assault on unions and Justice Kennedy's retirement announcement confirm that the makeup of the Supreme Court must be a central issue in every 2018 Senate contest.	https://t.co/zL4g461hax
Anthony Kennedy was never a moderate. He was a conservative who maintained a small measure of respect for the rule of law and the Constitution. Trump will try to replace him with an extremist who disregards the basic premisesof American jurisprudence.	https://t.co/MiGM93lioQ
Anthony Kennedy has announced his retirement — opening up what could well be the biggest fight over a Supreme Court seat in American history.
The Supreme Court’s decision in the #JANUSvsAFSCME case represents an “unprecedented and nefarious political attack—designed to further rig the rules against working people.” https://t.co/MiGM93lioQ
