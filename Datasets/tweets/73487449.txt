@Barbann76 @RhodesRRocky @MaireeGLR @ThetaIrewyk @brandondarby @BrianKolfage Darby from what I can see here is not saying tunnels don't exist.

He says certain "regional" groups (border where there is no river) build tunnels, not "The Cartels" quotes here are Darby's.

@BasketofCovfefe @PrisonPlanet Yes, I believe that is the one.  Steele denies leaking then in September, but admits (page 108 of the warrant) That he leaked in late October after winners laptop became publicly acknowledged.
Interesting that the FISA Application relies heavily on what a "news report" says. Is that intelligence or hearsay?  This is not page 108 by the way. 108 is way better. https://t.co/sUNXBoXe7e
