@KayaJones Miss these people that I previously tweeted are so evil !they even took the name of the person I was tweeting !ameera David look at all the tweets I have nothing to hide!
@KayaJones Miss if I sin a great sin this will happen! I have been the only reason GOD does not let this world perish! If there be at the least one! I will not destroy for the sake of one!
RT @KayaJones: The Democratic Party is self-destructing.
@KayaJones Miss I died once my spirit floating than sinking into the earth ;not heaven !you really don't want that to happen!
@VictoriaOsteen Madame I know how to close the gates of heaven to all that live now and hence forth!
@AmeeraDavid just so you all know this! I can have the gates of heaven closed! and it will take Jesus to open them!
@VictoriaOsteen Madame and you ask me to give something to one!
@VictoriaOsteen Madame I remember my therapist for saying nothing she goes Russia today! I never mentioned them to her it was 4 the week second or3 rd seesion!
@VictoriaOsteen I called just to ask a quest she ignored all my calls got me very upset bec at time I was poisened with foot cream !did not know !I asked to check meds and see a doctor they said no next week they called police on me! had me arrested !thanks to Russia today!
@VictoriaOsteen Sho I say another time ?a year ago my new young therapist ;very pretty !to welcome her I bought 6 pizzas ;brought them !she was always giving me hints what are you doing this weekend !after 4 session I asked her out !she said no !when I called for something ++
RT @VictoriaOsteen: What can you do to build a connection with a loved one? Can you encourage them? Do them a favor? Buy them a little gift‚Ä¶
@VictoriaOsteen For sending flowers to two bitches had so much problems !they tried all to arrest me !give your nonsense to another!
@VictoriaOsteen I seen it all for bringing pizza pie to a woman in home depot saying nothing ! Twice just bringing they arrested me and had to go to court 5 years probation!
@FBI Or when the guy in whities on Atlantic avbpoisened me with a bottle of water from vending machine !and almost died couldn't breath and I tried to call  FBI !tell me is he in jail for attempt murder? I'll bet he's enjoying life !so you all enjoy a little!
@FBI Just like the hospital I went to ,and gave me gas only !no medicine and my insurance had to pay for 10 minutes of gas
@FBI Why don't you take away my medicine all the more reason to die and take what belongs to me!
@KristySwansonXO Miss I cannot hate !I have no feelings whatsoever !I have only one purpose!

@AmeeraDavid miss I cannot say how !but it will be painless I will just fall asleep! No drugs or poisens it is simple! I guess you or your friends don't give a darn even in this !
@AmeeraDavid miss light of the son deny yourself and follow me! he must lose his life to save it !it is all a transition to become LIKE GOD! I GET TO KEEP MY BODY OUTSIDE OF ONE ORGAN!
@AmeeraDavid miss when I die my father promised to come !only then! that's why if this world was destroyed and I died he would of had to redo it! I hope I have enough faith to take step?
Miss the formula on how to destroy these evil people is written in the bible its coded !vengeance is mine sayeth the lord whose side shall I be!
@AmeeraDavid miss my battle is not with you, your friends or the cops !they were only doing there job! my battle is with those that gave the orders to do what they have done to me and others!
@AmeeraDavid miss in time I can accelerate it if I choose but we will be rid of all evil from this world! I already know how !all I need is a little more faith! to take step!
@AmeeraDavid miss you see even in death I get to be justified!
@AmeeraDavid miss when this HAPPEN only the good will be preserved !all that is evil will perish !GOD'S PLAN !I THINK IT IS A GREAT PLAN!
@AmeeraDavid miss the secret to an angels power when he is weakest GOD IS STRONGEST! THIS IS WHY IT WILL HAPPEN THEN?
@AmeeraDavid miss you and your friend enjoy life! for it is not by fire !
@AmeeraDavid miss that's why I go nowhere! when I die the water goes with me !GOD'S PROMISE FOR BEARING YOUR NONSENSE !READ BIBLE!
@AmeeraDavid tell the cops should I go on and on with subject!
@AmeeraDavid miss this was CVS both girl where so they could be had for the blonds friend !your friends have a lot to learn! tell the cops I have a lot to say!
Or another place a bit** h blond got involved with me asking a girl out, who interfered !than she left! I asked another one the same thing !I told her not to interfere! the police theathened me ! do what you want miss I have a lot to say to judge!
@AmeeraDavid I'll never forget for apologize to two girls for my rude Ness because their boss lied one I fallowed into kitchen the other he said I told her I'm going to get you I knew it was a lie still he called police
@AmeeraDavid Miss I'll never forget the time I parked my car and touched or taped the guys bumper he called police and they wanted to give me a summons!
@AmeeraDavid tell the police I am the lion! I will be your judge! who knows what I can do; with God !maybe I will make God's out of a few by closing Waters of the world !and the rest of you can count your bank account!
Come on for all the times they threatened me I will only mention the dozen times ;for nothing! tell them come on finish me off like the mob told them to!
@AmeeraDavid miss what's the matter they know my adress !what do you think I will say something to judge like foot cream to give me glucoma !and medicine in 2000 which gave me diabetes !come on tell the police I'll be good!
@AmeeraDavid come on miss let's see where this takes us! we both will see your laws justice and my father's justice!
@AmeeraDavid miss your law only treatenes me if I ask a girl out !if one stabbes me and I have the knife in my hand your police do nothing to the individual !like u for sending you flowers you want me arrested that's how stupid they all are!
Miss full fill your destiny have me arrested! Miss I met the bastard a few years AFTER  in a bar ,he had his face all cut up with a large scar up and down his whole face! (Nicky scall )your law does nothing ,but my father does!
Miss it's not me !only mark I have is a scar on my left lung side from one who stabbed me when I was young !as prophecy a spear shall pass his side !the bastard left the knife in me even with knife they did nothing to him!
@AmeeraDavid miss who is the son of Baal? scripture say when he was born trumpets sounded !he is vain his reason for praying to Baal! he wairs a green turnik as prophecy say! he bares his mark !you know 20 years ago in hospital they checked me for marks ;so +
MISS prophecy in Bible a asteroid was to strike earth in this piriod and demons were to be among us like locusts as Bible says!
Miss that Saturday I went to church confession to priest I told him the story that SUNDAY THE PRIEST TOLD US DURING MASS !how an astoroid very large on Thursday came  to within 250000 miles from earth !and did not crash!
@AmeeraDavid miss about 6 or 7 year's ago on Thursday night I woke up in my sleep saying begone SATAN A FEW TIMES ,YOU DO KNOW the dragon? is in 3! father ;Baal ;spirit and son!
Miss that same hour a large volcano in Greenland erupted ;spewing Ash all over Europe !my theory GOD ALTERED the force underneath the earth to another direction ;instead of California! miss the major earthquake is 9 years past due!
@AmeeraDavid miss in 2010 just by me saying something to one the Jews love and respect GOD.! GOD ORDERED AN ANGEL TO PULL OUT THE SWORD IN MY HEART! A REAL SHARP PAIN LIKE SOMETHING BEING PULLED OUT!
@AmeeraDavid miss Jesus had powers over death .Samson had great strength .Moses had his powers, just by saying ,two swords comming out of the mouth ,one him other GOD! IM in the same situation I control time !among a few others
Miss the only thing I can enjoy is music !can't drink wine or anything! I am trapped in this world with certain powers I wish I could specify!
@AmeeraDavid Miss don't think I'm in love with anyone !I no longer have feelings! I am without feeling; I don't know what happened !maybe after 30 years without love that's what happens!
