It‚Äôs quite clear reading @joncprevo‚Äôs tweets that this guy should not be on Twitter. Block him and report him.
But, he did try and hit on me knowing full well I was 18 years old (which is not illegal, but considering his age... is sketchy). I made it clear that I was not interested in men, but he continued to pester me for a while until I just kept leaving him on read.
In terms of grievances, I don‚Äôt have any to document, really, most of them were deleted because they creeped me out. I eventually unfollowed and blocked him.

@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa well for starters, there is no occupation in Gaza, and there hasn‚Äôt been in a decade. pulling out of there made no change in peace talks. if they pulled out of the West Bank they would only have two fronts to worry about.
@polisciguy2011 @KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa JStreet is also a very large pro-Israel organization
@politicsluo @KarandikarA99 @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa I meant that there is no evidence a majority of American Jews, or even a large amount, do not believe Israel has no right to exist
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa ... they don‚Äôt, they listen to non-profit lobbyists that convince them to support the only democracy in the Middle East, and it‚Äôs in our national security interests to support them
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa no, I mean thousands of Jews have also gone from here to Israel to serve in their military. it‚Äôs a real thing. also, why do you think AIPAC has such a large membership?
@politicsluo @KarandikarA99 @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa i mean you completely misinterpreted what I said in order to get me to admit I was wrong
@politicsluo @KarandikarA99 @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa i mean, given literally millions of Jews have joined the Israeli military to fight for its independence... not really?
man my mentions get worse and worse

@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa so you‚Äôre saying an organization created by a few Jews means the majority of us follow it. riiiiight
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa yes, you want to tell me the total Jewish membership of that organization?
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa I‚Äôm saying that taking a biased look at it and ignoring the totality of circumstances in order to scapegoat them is indeed anti-Semitic
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa you want to show me a poll proving that? at least some concrete evidence?
@politicsluo @KarandikarA99 @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa because it‚Äôs literally the only country they‚Äôre safe from persecution, why do you think Zionism came about in the first place? because Jews were forced out of Europe by pogroms, and then they were slaughtered en masse by the Nazis
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa I mean, for starters, there is more than one state with a majority Islamic population
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa I myself am Jewish and I‚Äôm proud to conflate my religion with the homeland of my people
@KarandikarA99 @politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa it absolutely is?! it‚Äôs *the* Jewish State
@politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @KarandikarA99 @SenhorRaposa because it completely ignores the Jewish struggle and persecution that the Jewish people have faced for thousands of years
@politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @KarandikarA99 @SenhorRaposa coming from someone who isn‚Äôt Jewish, this is truly an awful tweet
@KarandikarA99 @DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo what do you define as a national security threat?
@politicsluo @DylanDevenyi @KarandikarA99 @SenhorRaposa so you‚Äôre saying because she doesn‚Äôt mention Jews, there can be absolutely no communication of an anti-Semitic message? that doesn‚Äôt sound right

@DylanDevenyi @SenhorRaposa @politicsluo @KarandikarA99 correct, you‚Äôre allowed to be upset about the human tragedy in Gaza. You should be. But solely blaming Israel and ignoring the actions of Hamas conveys a lack of caring for objectivity

@DrewVanDrese @politicsluo I think that the right to privacy is derived from several different amendments. 4 pertains to search and seizure, so only really personal items. Also comes from 9 (natural law) and 14 (equal protection)
@politicsluo If I were a SCOTUS justice, I would've ruled for Snyder on the grounds that it violates a right to privacy. Breyer's concurrence somewhat agreed, saying the online harassment of the funeral was not protected free speech
@politicsluo Despite liberals ultimately siding with Phelps, I think this is something that more liberals would support than conservatives (limits on free speech)
@politicsluo A case I studied recently had him dissent in an 8-1 opinion on freedom of speech (Snyder v Phelps, 2011 - funeral protest doesn't violate right to privacy)
@WalshFreedom Joe, this one isn't hard. That was a consensual relationship. Kavanaugh's not.

@IAmKrishanPatel Incumbent advantage is just too strong for me to think Rosen has a greater than 60% chance. I think it's slightly in her advantage, I'd call it Tilt D
@IAmKrishanPatel The polls don't
@IAmKrishanPatel NV is still a tossup
@WalshFreedom nope
I have great confidence in Jacky Rosen. But I could see a map where Heller and Sinema serve together.
Correction: ND is Lean D as well. Which means Florida is the most competitive Senate seat held by a D.
Additionally, if you live in North Dakota you pretty much have the most important individual vote in determining who wins the Senate. Who knew?
Most interesting takeaways from @FiveThirtyEight Senate Map:		Florida and North Dakota are the most competitive seats held by Democrats.		Many Dem seats that are thought to be hotly contested are rated as Likely D, such as MT, WV, and even IN (which I don't personally buy).

@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement Making the claim that Israel is indiscriminately targeting Palestinians as a result of race shows a lack of understanding about power politics in the region.
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement When you're speaking in the context of who Israel is going after, its Hamas - not Palestinians in general. They bomb key targets, like terror tunnels that are set up underground to infiltrate Israeli civilian centers.
@yoalexrapz @thecjpearson @RealSaavedra @benshapiro @conservmillen @TrumpStudents @guypbenson @w_terrence @KyleKashuv @charliekirk11 @TuckerCarlson Facts don't care about your feelings
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement Israel is not targeting Palestinians. It is their violent protests that are causing retaliation as a result of Israel trying to secure its sovereignty.
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement It is a fundamental false equivalency, and the two conflicts are intrinsically different. Guess who's charter includes texts that encourage "fighting against and killing the Jews" indiscriminately? You guessed it, Hamas.
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement Gaza itself is a ghetto, only by the choice of Hamas. They receive billions of dollars of humanitarian aid, and instead of building strategic infrastructure, they spend it on terror tunnels and ammunition
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement again, "en masse" is such a loaded term and you're overinflating what is actually going on in the conflict.
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement The vast majority of Palestinians fled the land in 1948 as a result of the independence war and did not return afterwards, not as a result of Israeli attempts to push them out.
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement You claim there's a systematic ethnic cleansing? Are there concentration camps being built where Palestinians are being gassed and put to forced labor?
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement The protesters were not unarmed. They were throwing Molotov cocktails.
@jimbokosmo @BDSmovement How can you call defending ones borders a genocide? Such a statement is a massive disservice to the millions who died in the systematic murder that was the Holocaust.

@realJoelValdez Well, I guess that solves the problem in our country. Since the libs are indoctrinated, nothing can be racist because the libs think everything is racist!
@realJoelValdez @campusreform By hosting provocative events, you encourage a lack of dialogue and protest that boils down to racist talking points.
@realJoelValdez @campusreform What is insulting about what I said? I explicitly said you're more than entitled to hold a vigil!
@realJoelValdez @campusreform I have not been "trained" to call things racist. I call things racist when they're obviously racist.
@realJoelValdez @campusreform There are much better, less provocative ways to handle situations like this. During the 9/11 vigil, we did not villainize Arab or Muslim people. We held a candle lighting ceremony at the Alma statue. The same is doable for your cause.
@realJoelValdez @campusreform You can hold a vigil for those killed by illegal immigrants, and you're more than entitled to do so. There is no denying the racist connotations the wall has, regardless of what it actually represents. Discourse shapes reality and your vigil was racist.
@realJoelValdez @campusreform Clearly building a "wall" to memorialize them and keep illegal immigrants out of the country isn't the only way to hold a vigil. It was designed with racist, provocative intentions.
@thehill Well, at least he's finally being honest.
