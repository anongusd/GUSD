‚Ä¶for Democrats to stand up to those on the left who rail against any meaningful steps toward border security and immigration enforcement.
It is well past time for Republicans to stand up to those on the right who are quick to denounce any sensible solution as amnesty, and‚Ä¶
Yes, this is the sort of deal the extreme wings of both parties will oppose‚Ä¶but it's the exact type of sensible compromise the nation needs.
In exchange, Congress should significantly increase border security with funding for add'l personnel, technology and physical resources.
Only Congress can fix this mess. It should do so by providing a path for law-abiding #Dreamers to obtain a green card and full citizenship.
The #Dreamers are not responsible for their situation, and as a compassionate nation and people we owe them our help.
I also firmly believe that the principles of our founding dictate children should not be punished for the illegal acts of their parents.
I have long believed that America is a country of laws and that border security is paramount...

Middle-class families are losing access to the doctors, pediatricians, and care they want because Obamacare can‚Äôt live up to its promises.
Seniors should not have to worry that they can no longer access the care they need because of ObamaCare.
ObamaCare is squeezing the middle class. When people are paying higher healthcare costs &amp; working fewer hours, they are taking home less.
Hard working Americans shouldn't have to accept a new normal of reduced hours and wages caused by ObamaCare.
ObamaCare's regulations are causing higher healthcare costs and shortened work weeks. It's taking money out of families' paychecks.
ObamaCare has caused the 40-hr work week to go down to 30 hours, or about a 25% decrease in people‚Äôs take-home checks.

ObamaCare is affecting many at the bottom of the income scale -- workers getting their hours cut back are trying to make ends meet.

Good morning! Here's the floor schedule for today: http://t.co/VsSq6WOHFp
Let's focus on creating an America that works -- expand education opportunity, remove the burden of ObamaCare, help middle class families.
Families that are dealing with canceled plans and higher costs are also seeing their jobs, wages and hours put at risk due to ObamaCare.
How much more proof do we need of Obamacare‚Äôs devastating effects before Dems finally admit the law they enacted isn‚Äôt working for America?
Under Obamacare, millions of hardworking Americans will lose their jobs and those who keep them will see their hours and wages reduced.
The CBO's latest report confirms what Republicans have been saying for years now.
The President is out of excuses now on Keystone. Let's go ahead and get this done.
ObamaCare is squeezing the middle class - higher healthcare costs and fewer hours worked means American families are taking home less.
ObamaCare has caused the 40-hr work week to go down to 30 hours. That's a 25% decrease in people‚Äôs take-home checks. http://t.co/9Pa4VmlYVp

Middle class families are facing a squeeze -- many are devoting a larger share of their take-home pay to things like gas &amp; health care.
Most Americans have jobs, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that America is working so well for them -- incomes are stagnant and costs are going up.
America doesn‚Äôt work if it's no longer the land of opportunity. Expanding education opportunity gives every kid a shot at a good education.
An America that works requires a growing and vibrant economy -- with job growth that benefits all Americans.

The House will continue to ensure that there's transparency &amp; accountability  in order to protect people from ObamaCare's harmful effects.
The Exchange Information Disclosure Act will hold the Administration accountable for accurate and timely ObamaCare enrollment information.
As the WH dodges the answers to important questions, the House will continue the oversight and accountability needed under ObamaCare.

I challenge Eric Holder to visit Louisiana and meet with the students and parents who participate in its Education Scholarship Program.
School choice protects families and children, not bureaucracies. #EducationOpportunity
We must embrace teachers, schools, and communities who are succeeding, remove roadblocks, and expand school choice. #EducationOpportunity
Why, in our largest cities, do only half of public high school students graduate on time? #EducationOpportunity
For far too long the federal government‚Äôs approach to fixing our education system has been: spend more money and give more control to DC.
For many families, living in poverty spans generations. School choice is the surest way to break this vicious cycle of poverty.
Safe, effective schools for all children is not a political issue. #EducationOpportunity
All parents and families should have a safe place for their children to learn. #EducationOpportunity
We have a responsibility to our children, to our communities, and to our country's future to ensure they graduate prepared for life.
We must not rest until every school in every community adequately prepares students for success in their pursuits. #EducationOpportunity
We cannot be a great country without great schools. #EducationOpportunity

ObamaCare is not something that is helping Americans, it is harming those people who need help most right now.
Democrats tried to hide for years that many Americans will lose access to doctors, pediatricians, &amp; perhaps even the hospitals they choose.
The President and House Democrats tried to hide for years that millions of Americans would lose the coverage that they liked.
The Administration has tried to hide the security problems that exist with the website that one official called 'limitless' prior to launch.
The Administration continues to try and hide the problems on the back end of the ObamaCare website that delivers information to insurers.
President Obama and others have tried to hide what they knew about the website problems well before the website launch.
Remember back in July, right before Independence Day, the Administration tried to hide the one-year delay of the business mandate.
Last week, as families prepared for Thanksgiving, the Obama Administration tried to hide another unilateral one-year delay of ObamaCare.
While the White House wants to claim that http://t.co/B5NoA7ujwI is now working, we know that ObamaCare is still plagued with problems.
At this point, one has to ask: What else is the Administration hiding about ObamaCare?

Education opportunity is justice for those children trapped in failing schools. And the arc is bending. #EducationOpportunity

Holder will have to explain to the American people why he believes poor minority children in La. should be held back. #EducationOpportunity
If Eric Holder does not withdraw this suit against Louisiana's scholarship program, then the U.S. House will act. #EducationOpportunity
Low income and minority students across Louisiana should not be denied the #EducationOpportunity they deserve.
I call on United States Attorney General Eric Holder to withdraw his LA school choice lawsuit immediately. #EducationOpportunity
Halting the Louisiana Education Opportunity program would trap low-income minority kids in failing schools. #EducationOpportunity
Louisiana's Scholarship Program is the very opposite of a civil rights violation. It's a civil rights solution. #EducationOpportunity
Scholarship programs like the one in La. are aimed at furthering equality for all kids ¬≠ rich or poor, black or white. #EducationOpportunity
The lack of #EducationOpportunity is the greatest civil rights challenge of our time, and it is up to us to solve it.
Millions of low-income kids in our country are being denied the #EducationOpportunity afforded to wealthier children.
Children in America born into poverty often find themselves trapped in failing schools. And many have no way out. #EducationOpportunity

Tally to date? Obamacare mandates delayed for business, big insurance companies, but not for you or your families.
Individual mandate takes effect in four months, but big insurance companies get year long delay for mandate to cap your out of pocket costs.

Stand with House Republicans and work with us. Let‚Äôs fight for a better future for kids like Rashawn and Ma'lani. #CPAC2013
When conservatives are united, our ideas win! Conservative ideas win, because conservative ideas work. #CPAC2013
Where we have differences, we should air them. Where we are bound together with single purpose, we must put all energy behind these efforts.
Conservatives fight for freedom. And that is always a fight worth pursuing. #CPAC2013
The fight for the future of our country is before us. #CPAC2013
School choice is the answer. It puts our conservative values to work and provides opportunity for our kids. #CPAC2013
One of our priorities this year will be to move heaven and earth to fix our education system for the most vulnerable. #CPAC2013
No parent or child should be forced to wait for failing school systems to get their acts together. #CPAC2013
Imagine if students ‚Äì including those in poverty or with special needs ‚Äì could finally access the best available schools. #CPAC2013

I've got to ask, who would want to deny Rashawn and Ma‚Äôloni of caring teachers, motivated administrators and a safe environment? #CPAC2013
Too many of the most vulnerable children in America are stuck in schools that don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs a tragedy and we have to fix it. #CPAC2013

We know our freedom is God-given and should never, ever be taken away. #CPAC2013
President Obama and his allies believe the best solution to our ills is cradle-to-grave government support. #CPAC2013
The way to help these families is with policies rooted in the conservative principles of limited government and more freedom. #CPAC2013
We‚Äôve got to help these families. And the way to do that is not by more government. #CPAC2013
Too many parents are forced to give up time with their kids in order to hold down two jobs ‚Äì just to pay the bills. #CPAC2013
When families have to give more and more money to the federal government it means less freedom. Plain and simple. #CPAC2013
America faces serious challenges. Our debt is exploding. The very economic foundation of our nation is at risk. #CPAC2013
Now more than ever, your voice is critical. Now more than ever, we must turn our words into action. #CPAC2013
We've got to fight too. We must be prepared to work even harder ‚Äì for the sake of our children and grandchildren. #CPAC2013
Caring teachers, motivated administrators, and a safe environment to learn makes all of the difference. #CPAC2013

True peace will also require a recognition by Hamas and the Palestinians that violence does not help, but hurts their cause. #aipac2013
True peace will require an end to Iranian backed weapons smuggled into Gaza. #aipac2013

Israel is a gift to all free loving people around the world. #aipac2013
To all of our Christian brothers and sisters who are with us, we salute you and we thank you for standing with Israel. #aipac2013
We are here together tonight, people of all faiths to support Israel and the US-Israel relationship. #aipac2013
These stories serve as a constant reminder of the threat Israel faces and why Israel needs our friendship‚Äì and needs it now. #aipac2013
We've helped protect each other. We've helped protect our friends. And we've helped protect humanity. #aipac2013
The alliance between the United States and Israel is often tested, but never shaken. #aipac2013
With this friendship, the world is a better place. #aipac2013
Tonight, we celebrate a friendship between two countries: simple in concept but mighty in force. #AIPAC2013
