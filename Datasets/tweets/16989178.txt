For those interested, DSA's statement run in full on the Hill: https://t.co/DZzuJMiw0c... let's see if media outlets run our videos in full as well.
Also we apparently engage in "failed political attacks." Hate to break it to you, but Project Veritas delivers results time and time again. Both DOJ and DOS have issued comments indicating they will investigate the abuses we uncovered.
They say we are discredited as "journalists." But journalism is an activity, not an identity. And what we have exposed SO FAR this week is federal employees saying "resist everything... F*** s*** up" "there's a lot of talk about how we can like, resist from inside", &amp; much more
Predictably, DSA issues statement challenging our ethics. Project Veritas has never had to issue a retraction for its reporting. The true ethical failure was captured on our cameras- their members abusing their federal positions to advance their personal political agendas.
