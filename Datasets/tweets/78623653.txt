Maybe Congress could put all the agency budgets up for a floor vote in each chamber?  And let members offer amendments? ...
Rather than grandstanding on the debt limit, lawmakers might want to give federal spending a thorough review once a year.
Also, likely to be short-term CRs for fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and on and on until Congress gets serious about the budget. https://t.co/8aFToxK1f8

@RepSchrader says he hopes @CMSGov is listening to @HouseCommerce hearing, and will return with "better" final version of #PartB test.
@janschakowsky again asking #PartB drug model questions. Are there any other lawmakers who have been as adamant in defending @CMSGov test?
Democrat @RepLoisCapps asks what protections #PartB test could offer to protect patients. Baker of @medicarerights suggests ombudsman.
Cancer doc Patt tells @HouseCommerce that #PartB model won't affect what she prescribes, may affect which drugs doctors choose to provide.
@RepShimkus echoes @MarshaBlackburn in likening #Part B model to medical test. This is a major theme of GOP objection to @CMSGov proposal.
Witness Block says many of her fellow cancer patients already are "underwater," meaning they can't afford drugs at @HouseCommerce hearing
Oncologist Patt says "unintended consequence" of #PartB model will  shift more care to hospitals, a trend policy folks have been fighting.
@RepGeneGreen notes that @CMSGov #PartB model is sweeping, "seems to affect the whole" system of drugs provided in doctors offices.
Reminder. @CMSGov says there's nothing in #PartB model that limits access to a specific drug. The decision on what use remains with doctors.
Baker of @medicarerights asks for ombudsman for #PartB model, other changes.
Baker of @medicarerights commends @CMSGov for testing ways to relieve cost burdens on patients at @HouseCommerce  hearing.
Baker of @medicarerights says "sky-high" cost-sharing for #PartB drugs is a frequent cause of calls to his nonprofit group.
Cancer patient Heather Block tells @HouseCommerce that America already has drug rationing. "It's called affordability," she says.
Republicans strongly oppose #Medicare #PartB drug test of alternative payment, Dems offer some support at @HouseCommerce hearing. @CQnow
@janschakowsky questions the opposition to #PartB drug test plan. "All we hear today is `no'," she says at @HouseCommerce hearing.
@janschakowsky gives one of strongest Democratic defense of #PartB drug test at @HouseCommerce hearing.
Top @HouseCommerce Democrat @FrankPallone says he expects changes in final #PartB rule, which he says is not perfect.
@RepGeneGreen says fed officials can't put "heads in sand" on rising drug prices, but has raised specific concerns about CMS #partB test.
Key for @CMSGov in advancing the #PartB drug model may be strong Democratic support. Dem @RepGeneGreen cites some pros, cons at hearing.
@RepJoePitts says unelected bureaucrats ie @CMSGov folks plan "massive unprecedented experiment" with drug access at @HouseCommerce hearing.
