"This is the most important story in this country," says gun violence prevention activist @fred_guttenberg of 3D printed gun access: "What this administration did —and they did not need to do it— is they actively rolled back the public safety of citizens in greatest way ever" https://t.co/SsNgla183F
Tomorrow, blueprints to 3-D print plastic guns will be online. Several state attorneys general are suing the Trump admin to block those blueprints. 		@Fred_Guttenberg, who lost his daughter in the Parkland massacre, calls the blueprint release "horrible on a lot of levels." https://t.co/1B3DtGe7Da
