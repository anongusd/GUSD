I am a Republican Democrat. You might be a Democrat Republican. This is the center party.
There needs to be a party brand that mobilizes this crew. I propose a binary party brand, one that plays to its strength and ultimately supports the issues and not the corrupt organizations behind the pols.
Those like me, a Dem in college, a Republican in my early career, and now in the center.
The reality is that the political center is getting broader, but it‚Äôs being built from those shedding the radical ideologies of the left and right.
I‚Äôve watched center party movements fail the center. I always think the branding is the least compelling aspect of these efforts, e.g. ‚ÄúNo Labels‚Äù leading with a negative.

If you're having trouble finding your Calling, don't give up. It's actually right in front of your face -- just not where you're looking.
How does that happen in life that we're able to completely pivot? To walk away and into something entirely different? It's the 'Calling.'
Imagine that 10 years ago I'd be working on the GOP convention in Cleve. Today I'm working on launching a heroin recovery clinic by June 1.
'Live Your Calling' is freedom to do what you love and is the only way to live. Life opens doors when you're leading a passionate life.
All this Live Facebook and Snapchat'n is crushing my battery. Perhaps there's hope, Twitter.
Are you seeing this Tweet?

I made a thing and posted it on snapchat. @davidall, creatively.
The word 'accomplished' is both fleeting and legacy building. But in the moment, it's a strong motivating feeling fueled by the heart.
There's nothing better than giving everything you have and wake up knowing it paid off in the biggest way.

2} It was three entrepreneurs that I respect and admire dearly pounding the same inspiring message in to me. 'Get out there; do it.'

So startup Columbus, do yourself a favor and take a trip to the Bay Area. Meet some people, be inspired, and come back to build a unicorn.
And you can't discount the value of nature, wine country, art, culture, and more than 4,700 restaurants in a small geographic area.
And perhaps the largest concentration of social entrepreneurs and do-gooder change agents.
But the Bay Area is also home to an amazing, vibrant startup culture that is incredibly intoxicating and transformative.
Entrepreneurs in Columbus need access to big, risk-taking capital like that found on Sand Hill Road, the Wall Street of Silicon Valley.

After all, what is the point of being connected to so many people if we're not willing to share them through connection. #DavidtheConnector
Tweets filled with hashtags aren't exactly pretty, but they're useful for reaching the broad audience and later for sucking out through api.
The best way to solve a need is to accelerate through an intro. And there's nothing better than a warm introduction. #DavidtheConnector
For example, if my followers see #3dprinting and have a need that fits, they might reach out. It could also reach a broader hashtag crowd.
I'm experimenting on Twitter with how best to share intros with a broader network to further expose capabilities and spark interests.

If this message resonates deep within you, be in touch. We will save a seat for you and always welcome the stranger.
So we'll work with what we have. And be the best at what we do.
The systems are broken because they are fueled by greed and scarcity. This game is coming to a conclusion though the end is far from near.
Those who are empathic when listening. Vulnerable in creativity. And absolutely passionate about trust and authenticity.
Our team will consist of artists, designers, writers, and makers who understand their gift of storytelling should be used for good.
This is the beginning of a conversation that is happening in the moment. It is fluid. Deriving inspiration through people. Channeled now.
The word "good" is subjective. Through our work we will define what "storytelling for good" means. Learning together. Making mistakes. Real.
We stand together with those who use business as the means to achieve a higher purpose.
To help businesses built for good achieve their mission through effective, comprehensive communication.
I believe in the power of storytelling to transform the world. It is my intention to build a team dedicated to this purpose.
Businesses -- sustainable through profitability. Not non-profits saddled with the burden of fundraising.
But what about those brands and businesses built to do good in the world? They to have a story to tell. A purpose to communicate.
Of course, marketing and advertising is effective for those who seek to influence the mindless masses. Those who need a script to live life.
A "Strategic Communicator" has a deep understanding of how all the tools work together to achieve the objective.
In age of conscious consumers the terms "marketing" and "advertising" seem less relevant and comprehensive than "communication."

David Kirkpatrick's story (The Facebook Effect) of how the anti-FARC movement used Facebook to organize a global movement totally missed?
Here is a link to Gladwell's New Yorker op-ed that I'm referencing http://nyr.kr/csWW7o
Gladwell should note that it's not technology that drives revolutions/change. It is people. Some, are empowered by technology to do so.
His idea of "activism" is extreme, e.g., a Berlin Wall must fall. But would not all great organizers use all tools avail to organize?
Gladwell's argument that social media's ability to connect others/spread info in real-time has no strategic impact is bizarre.

You know you've got a good team when two DAGgers ring my cell to let me know about the #goat worm.
@andyellwood your usage of LBS is inspiring. My only concern is the "gaps" between check-ins. Adding photos/comments helps, but not perfect.
Yes. Just got off the phone w/ @jonahseiger to get his deck RT @jimmiebjr: @DavidAll Will you all roll any of the #amp10 talks as podcasts?
Reflecting on @jw's talk about @gowalla at #amp10. LBS is a powerful story-telling technology. My passport is my story.
I'd say "goats" etc. might be a trending topic...
RT @Scobleizer: Oh, fun, do NOT click links that say "WTF:" They are evil and send out a worm that says something vile. Sorry about that.
Sometimes... you just have to laugh.
Ummmm. Don't click the link WTF... @scobleizer pushed it out... and I clicked it.
@MelissaTweets it never stops.
@MelissaTweets can you plan on coming to #amp11? We need you there. Same general time of year...
@MelissaTweets please tell me that we reached out to you to speak at #amp10. If not, we meant to.
