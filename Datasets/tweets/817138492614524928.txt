On with KC O’Dea right now discussing border wall funding and the 116th Congress. You can listen live here: https://t.co/qRzfaN1diF
The House will be voting on a Democrat funding bill that allocates zero dollars for the wall and has no chance of passing the Senate. I will most certainly be voting against this symbolic bill and hope that Speaker Pelosi will move past it quickly to get to a serious compromise.
Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer all voted in favor of the SFA. Today, policy has taken a backseat to political symbolism. “The wall” is something President Trump thinks is important, and because Democrats loathe the president they want nothing to do with a wall.
Back in 2006, a compromise immigration bill called the Secure Fence Act was supported by 90 Democratic members of Congress.  It included funding for "two layers of reinforced fencing" plus "additional physical barriers" along roughly 700 miles of border from California to Texas.
President Trump has been clear that he needs $5 billion dollars to start building additional physical barriers on the border. Why? It’s simple - because insufficient border security is a national security risk for our people.
Thread: This morning on the Today Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked if Democrats will support any money for building a border wall. Her answer? “No. No. No. Nothing for the wall." Now I understand this might be good politics, but how is this in any way a reasonable position?
Today, I am honored to once again take the oath of office to uphold the Constitution in the 116th Congress. I am humbled for the continued opportunity to serve #NC13.
This week's newsletter--&gt; https://t.co/BuvkrWMacz
Tonight we took the first step in securing our Southern Border by funding President Trump’s wall.  I hope the Senate will follow suit so that we can deliver on a promise that has been made to the American people.
There are those that wish to secure our Southern Border with a wall and there are those who, for mostly political reasons, would rather see the government shut down than do any such thing.  Please know that I will be making this case until the very end.
If we are not willing to fight for a border wall now, do we really expect there to be a better opportunity when Nancy Pelosi is in power?  Now is the time for us to draw a line in the sand and make a very clear contrast.
The fact that we are even considering a bill with zero dollars for the border wall is nothing short of a complete surrender and it is my hope that President Trump will refuse to sign it.  Republicans have control of the House for 14 more days, but we sure aren’t acting like it.
I wanted let you know where I am on the government funding bill the House will be voting on later today:		1 - I will be voting against it. 		2 - I am encouraging President Trump to veto it if it passes.

We must STAND BY Israel - the world’s only Jewish state/our greatest ally in the region. Those of us in Congress must always remember the Holocaust isn’t ancient history and the murder of innocent Jews (in #Pittsburgh or #Israel) should be called out for what it is: pure evil.
If the Secretary of State cannot certify this, the bill would redirect that money to Israel’s Iron Dome system.
Last year, the first bill I introduced when I got to #Congress was the “No Bonuses for Terrorists Act,” which would direct the Sec of State that the Palestinian Authority and PLO have ceased all financial rewards to terrorists or their families.
Over the past forty-eight hours, the skies of southern Israel have been lit up with rockets. Over 400 of them have been fired at Israel in an effort by Hamas to murder as many Jews as possible. Thankfully, Israel’s Iron Dome has intercepted many of the rockets.

I also appreciate Dr. Dawkins and Dr. Lomax for joining me. HBCU’s are important to me, #NC13, and they have a major impact on our local economy. I enjoyed discussing with Dr. Bennett this morning just how much of a positive impact they have in Greensboro alone.
We discussed the implementation of bipartisan language myself, @RepAdams, and @BobbyScott were able to get in the recent omnibus benefiting the HBCU Capital Finance Program. I appreciate the time Secretary DeVos gave us this morning.
Earlier today, I had the opportunity to meet with Secretary of Education @BetsyDeVosED , along with Dr. Phyllis Dawkins, President of @BennettCollege , and Dr. Michael Lomax, President of the @UNCF. https://t.co/eR98T20tXV
Congress has the power to legislate → not the president.  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this effort and getting this issue fixed as soon as possible.
I said this earlier this week, but it bears repeating. I do not support separating minor children from their parents at our border and this legislation would fix this issue. For years now, the laws on how to handle children of illegal immigrants have been vague.
One thing it would do is clarify the Flores Settlement of ‘97 so that children of illegal immigrants who are apprehended at the southern border are not separated from their parent or legal guardian while in custody of the Department of Homeland Security.
I am now a cosponsor of the Equal Protection of Unaccompanied Minors Act led by @RepMarkMeadows. This bill would take many steps to ensure families who cross our border illegally aren’t separated.

H.R. 5227 is simple, but necessary piece of legislation. It would call on the Treasury Department to develop a national strategy to identify and combat terror and other illicit use of virtual currencies. It’s a step in the right direction.
And this of course increasingly means using virtual currencies. So, we in Congress are in a tough spot, we have to figure out a way to keep this nascent industry from being regulated to death while also coming up with ways to combat illicit use.
Today, I co-sponsored HR 5227, the Preventing Rogue and Foreign Actors from Evading Sanctions Act. through my work on the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee, I’ve seen first hand how terrorists and other illicit actors use new and innovative ways to bypass sanctions.
The #opioidcrisis has been wreaking havoc on communities in #NC13 for far too long. In 2016 alone, we lost nearly 2,000 North Carolinians to this epidemic. This week, the House #GOP is moving legislation to reverse this trend. https://t.co/ipIu1vdl5a

Earlier in @FinancialCmte markup, @RepSeanDuffy passionately defended his bill HR 3861 and the state based insurance regulation model. The Federal Insurance Office, created by an obscure section of Dodd-Frank, is potentially a seed of the state based system’s destruction.
I commend @MickMulvaneyOMB and @realDonaldTrump for their leadership on this issue. For the sake of hard-working taxpayers in NC &amp; around the country, we shouldn't let unspent money from previous years just sit in accounts. Let this be the first of MANY more rescission packages!
Tonight, I will cast my vote in favor of H.R. 3 - the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act. Through this rescissions package, I hope we can cut billions of dollars in unnecessary spending. This will be the largest rescissions package in our country's history.

While we have been doing a good job combating the Islamic State over the past year, we have to be on constant alert. That means making sure we utilize every tool in our toolkit to stop them.

My amendment to the 2019 NDAA, that I introduced with my friends @RepSinema and @RepBrianFitz, has passed the House. We are calling for a detailed report on how the Islamic State is leveraging different financing mechanisms to fund their terrorist activity.

Going forward, we should learn our lesson - going into negotiations, desperate for a deal with a rogue regime should never be the goal. Today’s action by the @realDonaldTrump shows strength and signals to the world that we are serious about denuclearization.
To understand why @realDonaldTrump has decided to pull out of the Iran deal, it’s important to remember how we got to this point in the first place. In 2015, President Obama/Secretary Kerry withstood bipartisan opposition from Congress and struck a deal with the Iranian regime.
