@shane_buckalew I'm not approving or disapproving of anything.  I'm laying out the financial squeeze at the Pentagon right now on mil con.
@CuretonScott Congress gave $10.3 billion to military construction for 2019
The military already faces a big backlog of work on substandard military housing as well.  It's all a big squeeze on military construction dollars 6/ https://t.co/N0q5posWuP https://t.co/s9p8ufevvv
The Marines say they need about $3.5 billion for work at Camp Lejeune. The Air Force needs billions for Tyndall Air Force Base.   5/
Along with that, the military needs money for major repairs at two bases which were badly damaged by hurricanes in 2018   4/
The entire military construction budget for 2019 is $10.3 billion - so, $3.6 billion is over one-third of that.  That will hit a lot of home-state military base projects.   3/
The Pentagon is facing a major fiscal squeeze as the President looks to move $3.6 billion in military construction money to a border wall  2/

When he used one arm - putting it heavily on the shoulder of the lawmaker he was cajoling - we called that a 'Single Dingell.'  When he went with two arms, that was a 'Double Dingell.'

SHUTDOWN STALEMATE - Senate fails to get 60 votes on rival plans to end partial shutdown		https://t.co/h9TOHTHZzB
Senate votes 52-44 for the Democratic plan - but it fails to advance because it did not get 60 votes
By my tally - GOP "Yes" votes on the Democratic shutdown plan:		Alexander TN	Collins ME	Gardner CO	Isakson GA	Murkowski AK	Romney UT
That means there will be more votes in the Senate for the Democratic plan than the President's plan
So far, 5 Republicans have voted for the Democratic plan
The Senate is now voting on cloture on the Democratic plan, which extends funding for agencies until February 8 + disaster relief money (already passed the House)
We're being told now that the vote was actually 50-47, sted the 51-47 announced on the Senate floor.
On the GOP funding plan:		Manchin D-WV voted "Yes"		Cotton R-AR voted "No"	Lee R-UT voted "No"
Senate votes 51-47 to advance GOP/Trump shutdown plan - but 60 were needed.

Just to be clear - the White House last week threatened to veto the underlying bill that's now on the Senate floor.
Or - since the Democratic plan is voted on second - that temporary CR + disaster funding could still be approved by the Senate.  A longshot.  But maybe it's a way out?
Both measures would need 60 votes - and neither is likely to get 60 votes - which would leave us back at square one on the shutdown
The underlying bill for this Senate action is HR 268, the $12.7 billion disaster relief bill approved last week by the House https://t.co/gYduBV46AZ

@Joeyself You need 60 votes, no matter what.
@joey_zakrzewski Not happening
@Joeyself The actual talking filibuster died in 1918 when they changed the rules.  Always been for show since then.
@OtterBend No. There is no requirement that the Senate consider any bill approved by the House.
For a third time, the Senate has not mustered 60 votes to start work on a Mideast policy bill, as Democrats demand votes on shutdown funding bills
The Senate is again voting on a cloture motion to start debate on a Mideast policy bill; Democrats have blocked it over shutdown
What this means is that Democrats will keep passing bills to re-open the government, and then point out that the Senate is not acting on any of those bills
A second measure posted this afternoon would extend funding to February 1 https://t.co/bdATdinc3C

@gcooley8 @bob_kirkpatrick I gave facts.  The trade deal isn't done.  Congress still must vote on it.  Those are facts.  And the border wall has not been built or renovated.  Also true.
@gcooley8 @bob_kirkpatrick Wall doesn't mean border wall?  Are you really making that argument?
@bob_kirkpatrick so when he mentions 'the wall' that could be the wall that my father built in our backyard?

@TheTweetest Cite some examples of when the Congress "looked the other way" on reprogramming
@TheTweetest The President cannot re-program money without the consent of Congress
@TheTweetest Yeah he can't but thanks
@2Rzsimpson @Breathe_fr33 Congress specifically tells the Corps what to build.  That money cannot be used for a wall unless lawmakers specifically authorize and approve the money
@pcway66 No, the President doesn't have discretion, unless specifically granted.  The Congress writes the laws and tells the Executive how to use the money.

@dpcrr @DeputyPatrol Never heard the $45 billion figure
@BurntCapital There are no Democratic lawmakers in the DC area who would vote for wall money
@Breathe_fr33 Doesn't matter.   You can't move money to something else without the approval of the Congress
@Breathe_fr33 No, he could not use military money to build wall without the approval of the Congress
@Netsb They just voted for border fencing a few months ago.  This is what was approved by Congress earlier this year. https://t.co/md0AEUk88S

@NeilAxelrod The Senate was controlled by Republicans.  They could have worked on it at any time.
@jbwsgirl Yep, they didn't adjourn earlier when the question was raised.  It was a vote to fix the time of convening
@FreeEntPrize I did https://t.co/7HaLL7Np9v
The House has now adjourned until 12 noon on Saturday.  So, that guarantees that a partial shutdown starts at midnight tonight
@DarvinsReturned The House is in recess subject to the call of the chair right now.  They did not adjourn immediately after the vote fixing the time to convene.
@jbwsgirl Parliamentary procedure is not a matter of semantics.  As I was indicating, the House did not adjourn.
@jbwsgirl It might be hard to believe but I've seen a few things over the years.  But thanks.

BOTTOM LINE:  There is no deal.  But there are talks.
Flake: "There is no path forward for the House bill"
Corker with interesting comments on the floor on efforts to reach a 'global' deal; Flake emphasizes the next vote will be on an agreement.  No test votes.  No cloture votes.
McConnell says it's up to Democrats to cut a deal with the President.   There seems to be no deal in sight.
Jones D-AL votes "Aye" - the only Democrat to do that on the motion to proceed. VP Pence breaks the tie.
Big flurry of votes now on the Senate floor; Flake changes from No to Yes. Corker votes Yes - now tied at 47-47.
On the Senate side, we wait for remarks from McConnell on negotiations with Pence.  Vote to proceed to House bill has been open for 5 hours. https://t.co/HKWSfDQ7Su
On the House floor, Rep Kevin McCarthy R-CA says the House is still waiting on the Senate re: partial shutdown
@tedlieu The House can stay in session until 11:58 am tomorrow, and then adjourn until 12 noon.  It was a motion to set the time to convene

4pm - Pence meeting with Schumer.  Senate vote still open on motion to proceed to House CR.  Currently 44 Yes, 46 No.  Dow down around 400
@jaljr It will not be a tie because of at least 1 absent member.  The VP can break any tie whether 26-26 or 50-50
@Bachsflute @HavaBatia Yes, still need 60 in the Senate.  You would also need 60 to waive a budget point of order against the wall spending

@tehlaser Oh yes, I have seen gavels fall quickly in the House, but not usually in the Senate
@DoreyScheimer Speak for yourself :-)
@hharden85 There are not 60 votes to overcome a filibuster or a motion to waive the budget act for the border security money either
The longest vote (in terms of time) in the Senate that I know of is a 2009 health care vote that lasted 5 hours, so Sen Sherrod Brown D-OH could return from his mother's funeral wake
@fedup_patriot It's the President's proposal.  It was central to his campaign.  Every rally I covered it was a big hit.
@mtcatlady17 @vajohna @dandrezner No.  Motion to proceed just needs a majority
Per @cspan - the 12 Senators who have not voted yet:		Corker (he is here - waiting to see what happens)	Hatch UT	Heller NV	Isakson GA	Kyl AZ	Paul KY	Risch ID	Feinstein CA	Jones AL	Murray WA	Tester MT	Udall NM
It looks like 8 of the 12 missing Senators reside in either the Mountain or Pacific time zones
@LisaDNews No it does not need 50 votes.  It just needs a majority
At this point, the Senate vote is just a matter of which party has more Senators in DC.  14 missing, an hour after the vote started.  41 Yes  45 No
At the White House, the President just said, "We're totally prepared for a very long shutdown...Now it's up to the Democrats"
This Senate vote on the 'motion to proceed' to the House-passed CR+ is going to be held open to allow more time for Senators to arrive https://t.co/TrprSzF6C2

Flake: "If we're going to proceed, let's proceed to something that can pass"

@Lavasponge That's why they added almost $8 billion in disaster relief money as a sweetener
@FreedomFriez Dent is no longer a Congressman

@Davedawg1 The GOP didn't have the votes. But adding in almost $8 billion in disaster aid helped bring along a number of votes
One would assume this will not pass the Senate tomorrow.  It's unclear what will happen after that.  The funding deadline is Friday night at midnight.

MATTIS: 		WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jim Mattis says Trump deserves a defense secretary `whose views are better aligned with yours,' says he's stepping down.
THIS JUST IN 		WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trump says Defense Secretary James Mattis will be retiring at the end of February and a new chief will be named shortly.
@Jeffrey_Mayhew The 1.9% was already approved in the bills which were passed.  There is no pay raise language for the other 7 bills in this
@darrelld_smith You could do an easy search to find where I point out similar things in previous administrations https://t.co/PoX6uGp8nJ
None of the extra money added to this CR is offset by any spending cuts or savings elsewhere in the federal budget
The House is now debating the rule governing debate on the new GOP CR + $5 billion for border security money + $8 billion in disaster relief
You get the picture.  Here's the text of the updated CR, with more money for disaster relief and border security https://t.co/oEZIJVXpJh
The GAO would get money to investigate whether all of this money is being spent properly for hurricane disaster relief https://t.co/D2dvbyekpY
There's $50 million for "Hurricane Education Recovery" https://t.co/qYeqDiYAyj
Northern Mariana Islands would get money to help with disaster relief https://t.co/RrPrMiIHI0
As far as I can tell, there is only mention of the word "border" in this new bill - and that's hyphenated (but that's a story for my book)
National Park Service would also get some hurricane disaster relief money in this GOP bill https://t.co/2htWMsbuz7
The Coast Guard would get extra money as well https://t.co/Rvav0yYile
Here's some western wildfires money in the new bill https://t.co/2FzJHi1NKW
The Army Corps of Engineers would get a lot of extra money as well in this new GOP stopgap funding plan https://t.co/XBXS4jcnw7
Here's $70 million for NOAA to deal with equipment damaged by hurricanes https://t.co/BTimrK7JYa
Here's money for fishing disaster assistance https://t.co/j8pPjO89s8
More farm and disaster aid in the new CR for peach and blueberry farmers https://t.co/WkhOjEX35M
The new GOP CR will include nearly $8.7 billion in disaster funding - like this section for farmers https://t.co/lyXHuXc2UK
First sweetener in revised stopgap funding plan from the House GOP - $5.7 billion over five years for border security https://t.co/fNzAL8ENS9
@LisaDNews Is this the money? https://t.co/SNVClgPnuz
The new catch phrase from the President is his desire for a 'steel slat' barrier along the border; "walls work"
At Farm Bill signing, President Trump says any year-end funding measure must include border security funding - note he did not say the word "wall" https://t.co/B8X5gVxPj8
House now starting debate on last minute GOP tax bill that makes changes to last year's tax cut and more https://t.co/4so6zieXe7
Other items in the mix - some lawmakers want hurricane disaster relief money.  Others want a package of western lands bills added in.  Lots of ways to get to a majority, depending on the GOP sweeteners.
HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE to reconvene at 3:45 pm.  Maybe we will see a new CR plan from the GOP at that point
From the Speaker's Lobby - Rep Mark Meadows R-NC says he thinks votes could come late tonight/early Friday AM on CR+$5 billion for border wall+?
@LisaDNews But that's not a "wall" - and they never brought that bill up on the House floor, because they didn't have the votes https://t.co/LWeoONnqFE https://t.co/Pxw5gZ05nd

@greg_kemper No, it's just a generalization that you don't like
Pelosi says what's happening is a 'meltdown' among Republicans on dealing with FY 2019 funding
Pelosi tells reporters that Republicans don't have the votes to approve money for a border wall, no matter what the President wants
@greg_kemper You mean the anonymous sources at the White House are all fake news? https://t.co/c9La7ohurc
There are GOP lawmakers who want to vote on the $5 billion for the border wall today, before any vote on a CR.   https://t.co/KT34Fx2TBE
And then what's happening at the White House causes uncertainty as well https://t.co/UIP3RLHjk4
The other uncertainty is the number of House members not voting.  Makes vote counting difficult https://t.co/1W3uGLOawA
Speaker Ryan spoke with the President by phone this morning, during the House GOP meeting.  Then the Speaker canceled his scheduled news conference.
The feeling in the Speaker's Lobby was one of uncertainty.   The problem for Republicans is they don't have the votes for border wall money.
Maybe not a good sign https://t.co/X6vtwwCl6t

@Jake27546948 This CR would continue funding DHS at 2018 spending levels, which included $1.6 billion for border security,  but not a wall
@RichJonesJax Yep.  Things move fast when the next stop is the airplane home
5 of the 12 funding bills for Uncle Sam have already been approved for 2019.  7 other bills will remain on a CR.
BOTTOM LINE - The Congress will punt the President's fight for border wall money into 2019, and wrap up the 115th Congress this week
McConnell: "We will soon take up a simple measure that will continue government funding into February"
On the floor, Senate Majority Leader McConnell says Congress will move on temporary funding plan through February 8
The odds of a Friday partial shutdown over the President's border wall seem to have dropped dramatically.		McConnell: "He can speak for himself, but I think a government shutdown is not a good option"		https://t.co/M1BdTdFl5L https://t.co/moLLi9ZCAv

A number of you have asked - yes, money in 'other agencies' would certainly be considered 'taxpayer dollars'
SH Sanders on border wall money: "Look, we're not asking American taxpayers for that. We are looking at existing funding through other agencies right now."
Asked why taxpayers are paying for the border wall, SH Sanders said the money would be coming from unspent money in government agencies
@DougWestberry @Carrie_Brown24 There was nothing negative.  The story was about the judge rebuking Flynn &amp; his lawyers.  That happened.
SH Sanders says a new federal rule will require people to turn in bump stocks to the ATF or destroy them by March 21, 2019

@runaway0121 The House GOP never voted on the Homeland Security bill for a reason - they didn't have the votes
Republicans don't have the votes in either the House or Senate to approve the $5 billion the President wants for the border wall

Still no indication from Congress or the White House about a Friday funding lapse for part of the government https://t.co/YRPOt1Menx

@edfrazi So why did Flynn lie multiple times
Things tend to blend together in the Russia investigation, but I don't remember a mention of a Flynn-Kislyak closed door meeting after the election. https://t.co/o7D4uuo2S0
@sweetbillyv The investigation started during the campaign
@alperry50 Yes. And the judge approved of the redactions put in place by the Special Counsel
@JCMac65 Because one would assume they contain information which is pertinent to the ongoing Russia investigation
@alperry50 @kcathletics1955 Mueller submitted exactly what the judge asked for.  The original 302.  It was made public today with redactions approved by the judge.
@mshson No, we did a lot of stories on it actually.   Here's what I wrote in October of 2013 https://t.co/4URfobMW2Z
If you missed it from earlier today, here's the indictment of Flynn's business partner.  Flynn is "Person A."  Flynn Intel Group is "Company A."  https://t.co/PALafTH6WH https://t.co/rtCOTMeaZm
If your holiday travel includes a visit to Washington - or to a national park - a partial government shutdown might be an issue https://t.co/YRPOt1Menx
@JCMac65 No they are the same.  There was a question about dates and so the FBI filed both of them to show that the documents were the same.
@BurntCapital You must have missed that paragraph in my story
Released by a federal judge, an FBI 302 shows Michael Flynn misled agents about his 2016 Russian contacts https://t.co/7fkBRG1Hdr https://t.co/3OofatKyh9
@JMaddy0331 No.  This original 302 was filed last week with the court and made public today.
But in his guilty plea, Flynn told a different story - that Trump Transition officials had him work to get Russia to vote against the resolution https://t.co/0ZAtEJGrKc
In another part of his interview, Flynn told the FBI that he did not press Russia to vote one way on a UN resolution dealing with Israel https://t.co/n7msgS7iqA
But in his guilty plea, Flynn admitted asking the Russians to hold off on any response to the Obama actions https://t.co/PJinYq9Laf
For example, Flynn told agents he did not talk with the Russian Ambassador about post-election sanctions by the Obama Administration https://t.co/EF5KZDgR1c
And the text of the 302 also clearly shows a number of places where Flynn lied to FBI agents in late January 2017
The original Flynn 302 is out.  It's pretty basic stuff.  https://t.co/uTj1sW8H1T
@Barred10 The original one as it says in the court order graphic
@laissez_claire @MrBeardedTruth Yes. The 302 was filed under seal. Now the judge has ordered it be released https://t.co/PaiBm1uoRT
Federal judge orders FBI 302 on Michael Flynn to be unsealed (with redactions) for Flynn's sentencing on Tuesday https://t.co/YSfWzlRl1p
@texasroofclean No, he's on schedule to increase it as much as Obama did in 8 years, which would be more than Bush 43
@laissez_claire @MrBeardedTruth You complained about my coverage.  I asked you to list the positive stories that I have ignored. I'm waiting.
@texasroofclean The current estimate of the Trump White House is for larger deficits over 8 years than Obama
@texasroofclean I don't even have to look at the figures to know that is not true.

@Lavasponge So you didn't click on my story link and read it, which fully answers your question.
@Ghan_04 It's an interesting question.  I would assume that would only happen after January 3.  But Congress could pass a CR and just go home

Manafort hearing set for Tuesday, Butina to evidently plead guilty on Wednesday, secret hearing on Friday https://t.co/vORVl8JRgh
@Popehat Manafort now on Tuesday
@Dante7237 It's an investigation that involves ties to the Trump campaign, of which Manafort was the chairman at one point.
@Joej3 No, I would be very surprised at this week.  Maybe next, if at all.
@Dante7237 The government alleges that Manafort lied to the Special Counsel even after agreeing to cooperate in the Russia probe.  Simple stuff.
The pace of the Russia probe seemed to quicken on Monday, with new hearing set on Manafort, plea bargain for Butina https://t.co/vORVl8JRgh
@Retnavdoc Actually, the case wasn't brought by Mueller
@kcpitzarella Cohen is Wednesday.  Manafort hearing Tuesday.  Butina on Wednesday
Manafort again chooses not to appear at this latest hearing in his case https://t.co/QFOYTtHujj
That means Wednesday will feature both Michael Cohen being sentenced at 11 am, and then Maria Butina's plea agreement hearing at 3:15 pm
Judge sets Wednesday plea agreement hearing for Maria Butina https://t.co/zuhnjy3Lh6
Manafort hearing now moved up to Tuesday afternoon from Wednesday morning https://t.co/vqomVoxAGu
Butina was originally charged with illegal political activities in the US.  The feds say she had links to Russian intelligence, with questions about her ties to the National Rifle Association
THIS JUST IN: Accused Russian Maria Butina seems to have agreed to a plea bargain with the feds. https://t.co/opYzP7lXWQ
@MarkArum He's running

@JenniferRisley It's called counting the votes.  The Democrats certainly didn't win every race
@linderje Not true in California.  And they only helped two candidates in Arizona.  Why did Sinema win but not the D for Governor?
@kayemcelle No it is not.  It was only announced by the GOP.  Needs 60 votes in the Senate.
@dougsheridan So tell me when the last time was that Republicans held this small of a percentage of the California delegation. If you think it's not historic.
@Ryanexpress77 No they're not.  Any mail-in ballots had to be postmarked by Election Day, and they had to be received by that following Friday.
@HipHopThinker @linderje No, it's not peculiar at all.  Anyone who covers California elections knows how the mail-in votes skew big to the Dems

@gwheeler1 Or you have just ignored the stories out there, and the normalcy about the counting https://t.co/WjBHkyX5nv
@WSBSlade On Capitol Hill, if a lawmaker doesn't answer our questions, we just keep chasing them in the hallways until they do
@boni1o Almost no races have changed from what was declared on Election night
@WeFoundAmerica California doesn't certify until December 7.  Every state does it differently
@rowedairy @JRPrice94 Normal for a wave type year.  In 2010, I was tweeting about 6 races 11 days after Election Day
.@JRPrice94 Most people have no idea that votes are counted for weeks after Election Day. That is normal.
Meanwhile, one race that was called for House Republicans - CA21 - is now under 1,000 votes, as Rep David Valadao R-CA is not out of the woods yet 		https://t.co/Hnr1cvpeed
Along with final vote numbers in Utah, more absentees and provisionals will be counted on Tuesday in both NY22 (Rep Tenney R) and NY27 (Rep Collins R)
@WeFoundAmerica It's normal.  Vote counting is going on in almost every state right now
@pulpfan02 Why would Republicans be finding votes to defeat a GOP lawmaker in Congress
@debitking It's normal.  Almost every state is still counting votes
@tadford it's normal.  Counting votes in a close race takes time.

BREAKING: "I just spoke with Senator Bill Nelson, who graciously conceded" – Gov. Rick Scott (R) defeats Sen. Bill Nelson (D) in Florida Senate race https://t.co/szDneHoRhX
Final margin is 10,033 votes. It went from just under 15k to around 12,500 in the machine recount.  The hand recount gave Nelson another 2,000 plus votes
Sen Bill Nelson D-FL gains in final recount totals in Florida - but it's not enough, as Gov Rick Scott R-FL is the winner https://t.co/gMoV7LVX0G

@YossiGestetner They haven't called NY22, and there is no math where anyone thinks that Tenney can win there.  So again: No idea why the AP is sitting this one out
@TheTJHelm He gained in absentees/provisionals in almost every county that Collins won in recent days.  I'm not saying McM will win, but it's not over
@TheTJHelm NY27 has a big batch of absentees and provisionals to count on Tuesday.  I think NY22 is over, but not called yet
@YossiGestetner Manual recount not done and ballots could still be cured today
@TheTJHelm The undecideds are NY22	UT4	GA7	NY27	TX23
@LawoftheGator It is normal.  In Utah they are doing provisionals and absentees.  They will count those next week in NY.  Most states don't certify until next week or after
@LawoftheGator In 2010, we were still counting in California and other states at this time. This is normal.  Here's the snapshot of my twitter feed 10 days after the election in 2010 https://t.co/pn1rCM3J3I
@ASURay81 @LawoftheGator Here's the latest on CA ballots left to count - still 2 million https://t.co/Fk4m0i0CJQ
5 seats remain undecided, and one seat called for the GOP (CA21) is now considered a toss up by some experts
The AP calls CA39 for Democrat Gil Cisneros, defeating Republican Young Kim.  That gives Democrats +37 in the House

@dornmachine Because I don't? https://t.co/p1RRyaTXya
More votes in from Orange County for CA39, and Gil Cisneros (D) now leads Young Kim (R) by over 3,000 votes.
With Rep Mia Love R-UT now ahead, GOP leads 4 of 6 undecided races left in House. But there could be 7, with CA21 possibly going from R win to undecided.   Dems right now are +36.
@dornmachine I cover the President too.  It's called the news.
@Falcon3Six Almost every state is still counting votes.  Absentees next week in NY27.  California counts into December.  Arizona still counting
@NNJ_Taxman I don't think California certifies until December 7 or so - it goes for a while
President Trump celebrates wins in races for Governor in Georgia and Florida https://t.co/O1pecfP9Td
In CA39, Gil Cisneros (D) is now ahead of Republican Young Kim by almost 2300 votes https://t.co/u6tbU6NHVX
@kyracer57 That would be ironic is she won after the President's public post-election ridicule
@LifeNewsHQ No, in a first midterm, the President's party does not always lose.  Check 2002.
@ryanjones0805 The tweet clearly says "under a 2,000 vote lead for Rep David Valadao R-CA"
@Lisa32686 No, but you keep telling yourself that if it makes you feel good
@DseasRoss That is 'nitpick'
I keep seeing people trying to explain House GOP losses by saying most of them were retiring Republicans.  That is not true.  27 GOP incumbents have lost so far.  The Dem net gain now is +36
@steal_stop Because the votes are still being counted in most states
The most 'epic' first midterm would be 1934, when Democrats and FDR picked up 9 Senate seats
Meanwhile, CA21 - which has long been called by the AP and the networks for the GOP - is now under a 2,000 vote lead for Rep David Valadao R-CA
The last time there was a split decision in a first midterm (like 2018) was 1970.  Then it was R+2 in the Senate and D+12 in the House
In Utah 4, Rep Mia Love R-UT could be on the verge of a giant comeback win, as she is now in the lead in her race https://t.co/X6fqtfk78y
Lots of people wanted to know a Senate comparison in a first mid-term for a President.   Going back to Hoover here's a list https://t.co/HHIsmDIZ8J
@n1985oles Oddly enough Dem Presidents tend to do poorly in their first mid term in the Senate, but GOP Presidents often gain
@Son_DeeRRF It would be unlikely.  But as we saw in other recounts this year, sometimes you can stumble on tabulation errors
Meanwhile in GA7, the Democrat who is down 400+ votes to Rep Rob Woodall R-GA will ask for a recount https://t.co/lG9A5oMI9s

@minedyingbride Then if that's true, the Dem gains in the House would be best described as tsunami
Usually, a two seat gain in the Senate would not be described as an "epic victory." 		That might be the way to describe 1980, when the GOP won 12 seats and took control of the Senate for the first time since 1952 https://t.co/8A8gaoQI4S
@EaglesTTT No, there was no payment.  What Meadows was sanctioned for was paying the staffer for no work (for 2 months)
@sammisgrammy I've always said Capitol Hill is like a giant hormone. Everyone is screwing each other literally and figuratively

You can see the upcoming change in power in the House here in the Speaker's Lobby.  Most reporters now huddled on the Democratic side instead of the GOP
@tpwkmadi In this case, Democrats had hoped that the machines simply didn't pick up the votes - but it looks like most did not vote for Senate (non-votes)
@tpwkmadi An "undervote" is where someone does not vote for a certain race.  Like, you vote for Governor, but not for Senate on your ballot
This would probably indicate that the undervotes on a number of ballots in the Florida Senate race in Broward were true non-votes, which means no boost for Sen Bill Nelson D-FL https://t.co/scx7wT9uUK

By my count, Poliquin is the 26th GOP incumbent in the House to be defeated in 2018.  7 House races remain undecided.  D's lead 3, R's lead 4.
Here's the final from Maine 2 https://t.co/8bnLjsqSyw

The Orange County, California GOP of Bob Dornan, Dana Rohrabacher &amp; Bill Dannemeyer is no more.
Democrats are now +33 in the House with 9 races still to be decided.  Dems lead in 4, could win 6 of the 9 seats remaining.

@GNorway1 We are counting still because it's normal https://t.co/WjBHkyX5nv
@CarterMC11 No the ruling was that a birth year is not required. This is not about a correct or incorrect one
Currently Dems are +32.  Of the ten undecided seats, each party leads in 5.  Dems could win 6 or 7 of those.
One good piece of news in CA21 for Republicans, as Rep David Valadao R-CA extended his lead to almost 2,400 votes.  (His race has already been called, but some wonder)
It will be difficult for Republicans to hold on to either of those seats.  But many more votes still to be counted.  Dems could flip 6 seats in California.
Meanwhile, the GOP lead in CA39 of Republican Young Kim has been cut to 711 votes

Also of note is CA21, which has already been called for Rep. David Valadao R-CA - BUT his lead is now down to just over 2,000 votes.
Democrats have already won 3 seats in California.  They lead in CA10.  GOP has slight edge in CA39 and CA45.

MEANWHILE IN CALIFORNIA - Rep Mimi Walters R-CA has her lead almost cut in half, now up by only 1,011 votes in CA45

That is your Sunday AM update. You may now resume your social media insults, wild election conspiracy theories, unsupported accusations of bias, and general ill-mannered behavior.
The undecided House races where Dems lead are CA10, NJ3, NY22 and UT4.		The undecided House races where the GOP leads are CA39, CA45, ME2, GA7, NY27 and TX23.
It looks like Orange County, CA is not counting votes today.  They have over 300k votes left which can impact CA39 and CA45, where GOP leads have shrunk.
In the House, Democrats are currently +32 seats.		There are 10 undecided races left.  D's lead 4.  R's lead 6.
Currently, Republicans are +2 in the Senate.  		A split between Arizona &amp; Florida would leave the GOP at +2.
AGAIN, a reminder from the Republican Secretary of State in Arizona, this extended vote count is normal - fraud is not an issue https://t.co/djlsE06Qwj

About the only way that a major change would happen in a recount is if a major tabulation error is discovered.  Possible but unlikely.  Advantage GOP in Florida.
You can see the apparent ballot issue in Broward:	Almost 25,000 fewer votes for Senate than Governor.	Scott had 10k &lt; DeSantis.	Nelson had 10k &lt; Gillum.		So, that's a wash https://t.co/TYzIujI1ov
Meanwhile, the county election supervisors wait for the green light from the Florida Secretary of State on a recount		https://t.co/r5ZGE30MuZ
But it's important to remember that each race will be dealt with differently.		The Senate race gets a manual recount (under 0.25%).		The Governor's race gets a machine recount (under 0.5%)
Here's the final 'unofficial' vote totals from all of Florida's 67 counties. 	 	Scott leads Nelson by 12,562	DeSantis leads Gillum by 33,684		Both races qualify for a recount (under 0.5%) https://t.co/jyec7YWO9s

@Tommyzeros @PeeteySDee They had almost 400k mail ballots to count as of late Wednesday in one county.  It's normal in Arizona.   And California.  You're only noticing in 2018 because there is a close race of national interest
@PeeteySDee Every state has different rules.  California counts for weeks.  That's the way they've set things up to make sure every legit vote is counted
@Aye4Art No that would be your bias.  I factually reported what he said.  You jumped to conclusions about the tweet.

@DanFeinreich No, it's called ticket splitting.  Fairly common practice
@brianros1 Yes there is that possibility as well.  But Ducey is still running very strong
@PeterSzucs90 Maybe that's the answer.  But for a chunk of voters there is a clear ticket split
@cof53 That's from the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel, which would be the mainstream media
Check this ticket splitting in Maricopa County, Arizona (Phoenix).  Sinema over performing or McSally under performing.  Your choice h/t @kyracer57 https://t.co/HLYIiktM8R
@EarlSqurrl16 I'm finding it was reported widely.  But it raises the question - did the Gov's office send those people down or not?
@kyracer57 Is it that many? Wow.  She seems to be the only GOP statewide candidate suffering
Anybody down in Florida know if these people were sent to Broward for this election? @MarcACaputo https://t.co/Pz8MJWcK8B https://t.co/YLV9GMpCsI

h/t to @scottlay for these stats on CA10, which shows Rep Denham R-CA behind.  That would be another Dem pickup  https://t.co/D1tgbVw0AQ
That leaves the House at 226 D - 197 R, with 12 seats still not final.  Democrats lead in 4, GOP in 8.  All are GOP seats.   Democrats are +31 right now.
The AP tonight called CA25 for the Democrats, which is a flip from the GOP.  Rep Steve Knight R-CA had already conceded https://t.co/ZMNBAcwZrg
@wdallen2345 They're not behind. This is normal
There has been no update in vote totals for Rep Jeff Denham R-CA since Election Day.  His seat could be in danger as well for the GOP https://t.co/OPEeYSZi2S

Trump: Georgia Governor's race is over https://t.co/ytabsUacRH
@Retnavdoc I just gave you facts of what was asked and said. Evidently those caused you to have a negative reaction.
Trump basically says if reporters don't behave, they'll be out like Acosta:		"You have to treat the White House with respect, you have to treat the Presidency with respect"
Q: How long will Jim Acosta of CNN be banned from the White House		Trump: "I haven't made that decision; but it could be others, also"
To another reporter, Trump now: "You ask a lot of stupid questions"
More Trump on the Florida Senate race: "What's going on in Florida is a disgrace"
Trump says his acting AG was Senate confirmed (that was years ago), says Mueller was never Senate confirmed (not true - FBI Director)
Trump seems to threaten to pull press passes of other White House reporters, slams April Ryan: "You talk about somebody that's a loser"
On Florida Senate race: "If you look at Broward County, they have had a horrible history...they are finding votes out of nowhere"
President Trump tells reporters he signed the new executive order limiting asylum this morning

@SwankybTN Pretty normal stuff from my covering elections since 1984
@John_W_Nichols Every state does it differently.  They don't call it the United States of America for nothing
@tm00123 No, because some states allow ballots to arrive for up to 3 days, which is today.  And some don't count absentees until next week
@boboknight @PatrickRuffini Overseas ballots get 3 extra days.  Georgia-based ballots must arrive by Election Day
Like California, Arizona accepts mail-in ballots up to 3 days after Election Day, if they are postmarked by Election Day - so, more could arrive today.
Pima County (Tucson) will start work today on 18,300 provisional ballots.  Maricopa County (Phoenix) will drop more results by 5 pm MT.  That AZ county has 345,000 ballots left.
@tm00123 No, this is actually pretty normal for the Friday after an election
@HipHopThinker I'm concerned that it makes me work too much.  I covered Florida 2000 so seen it before
I am unable to do math.  Sinema (D) leads by 9600 votes in the Arizona Senate race https://t.co/FMNTPP40pN
@PatrickRuffini It's the beauty - or bane - of the "United States."  Each state has different election/ballot rules.  In Florida, mail-in ballots have to arrive by Election Day.
@kamaths75 There are deadlines but it takes time.  Vote counting is not done in a few days
In California, mail-in ballots can still arrive today if postmarked on Election Day.   Orange County still has 404,000 ballots to count
@HipHopThinker @Magnoliagirl94 Most of the votes left are in Maricopa County which includes Phoenix. They have 345k ballots to count
In the House, there are still 13 undecided races, all in GOP seats.  Democrats will flip more and have an outside chance to get to a 40 seat pickup

If you're not tuned in to the President's news conference:		(AP) -- Trump spars with reporters at press conference, tells several to sit down, calls another `rude, terrible person'
Trump ridiculed House Republicans who kept him at arms length, and lost: "Peter Roskam didn't want the embrace.  Erik Paulsen didn't want the embrace"
The President rattled off a number of names of House Republicans who lost: "Mike Coffman.  Too bad, Mike"
Speaking about Rep Mia Love R-UT, "Mia Love gave me no love. And she lost"
Trump is now openly mocking House Republicans who lost and did not give him support
@dootabb He said there were 43 GOP retirements.  There were only 32 total.  23 were GOP retirements
In explaining the House losses, the President is overstating the number of GOP retirements
Trump seems to allude to the changing totals in Montana, saying Senate GOP gains will be 2, 3 or 4 seats (also lots of votes still to count in Arizona)

The House and Senate were split for four years between 2011-2014, with GOP House/Democratic Senate
For those wondering, the last time we had a split Congress was after the 2010 elections.  In 2011-2012, GOP had the House, Dems had the Senate
This just in		WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House: President Donald Trump to hold post-election news conference at 11:30 a.m.
The Senate is currently at 51-45 GOP.  4 races are not final - GOP leads in Florida, Montana, Arizona.  Mississippi has a runoff on Nov 27
The House is currently at 219-193 with 23 races undecided.  Democrats lead in 9.  Republicans lead in 14 of the undecided.  If that stays, the House would be 228-207 Dem.
The Montana Senate race has tightened in the last 2 hours.  Sen Jon Tester D-MT now trails by 2700 votes with 82% reporting

It looks like we may end up with over 20 GOP incumbents losing in the House; that would make for more turnover than the 2012 elections (78 members)
In GA6, the lead is growing for Democrat Lucy McBath over Rep Karen Handel R-GA, as more absentees are counted https://t.co/cnH9oFDEVH
My back of the legal pad math shows the Democrats may have a net gain in the House of 32-34 seats
99% reporting in CA45 and it looks like Rep Mimi Walters R-CA will survive, as she leads by 6200 votes
99% now reporting in CA49 and Rep Dana Rohrabacher R-CA trails by 2800 votes to Democrat Harley Rouda
Don't look for the Arizona Senate race to be called soon.  McSally (R) leads Sinema (D) by about 1% - but lots of votes still to be counted
In the Florida Senate race, Gov Rick Scott (R) leads Sen Bill Nelson by just under 40,000 votes.  Mandatory recount is possible.
Democrats also lead in GOP seats in Michigan 8 and Utah 4.   Republicans have a 600 vote lead in a D seat in Minnesota 1.
In CA49 (held now by Rep Darrell Issa R-CA), Democrat Mike Levin leads by 52-48% with 44% counted. That would be another Dem pickup

In IL6, Rep Peter Roskam trails 55-45% in the early vote, and WOWZA, Rep Rodney Davis (R) trails 75-25% in the early vote.  Wonder if that's a typo.

AP calls Donna Shalala the winner in FL27, that is the second official pick up in the House for Democrats
70% reporting from Florida, and Republicans hold narrow leads in both the race for Governor and US Senate
Outside of two seats around Miami, GOP candidates for Congress seem to be holding GOP seats that were in play.  Good news for Republicans.
Rep Andy Barr R-KY with a late rush, now leads by 5000+ votes with 85% reporting.  Could be a GOP hold.

Early vote in Ohio 12 goes 54-44 for Danny O'Connor (D) over Rep Trey Balderson (R) - a race to watch
Also of note from the Dayton area, Rep Mike Turner (R) only up 51-48% in early vote
Most surprising stat from early vote in Ohio is Rep Jim Jordan R-OH is only ahead 52-48
In Virginia, the GOP is right now holding on to three of four seats that were in play; Riggleman (R) doing the best of VA2, VA5, and VA7
70% reporting from KY6 and McGrath (D) leads Rep Barr (R) by 601 votes

In KY6, 49% of precincts reporting and Amy McGrath (D) has a 51-47% lead on Rep Andy Barr R-KY
In Florida, Democrats won the early vote in the major cities like Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Miami, Tampa, and around Orlando.  Long way to go in both the Senate and Governor's races
Now starting to get early numbers from Virginia's races for Congress.  Brat (R) trailing in VA7.  Riggleman (R) leads in VA5.  Taylor (R) leads in VA2.  Leads are 52-47.
First numbers just popped in from Marion County, Indiana (Indianapolis) giving Sen Donnelly (D) a 66-30% margin in early votes over Braun (R).  Braun still has a healthy lead statewide
Again - statewide races are going to be like a Presidential race - lots of red in rural areas, with blue centered in urban areas
In Allen County, Indiana (Ft Wayne), Donnelly (D) is winning by 10% - other statewide races are 50/50 in that county
While Braun (R) leads the Indiana Senate race, he is slipping further behind other GOP statewide candidates by over 5% in some cases.  Shows ticket splitting for Donnelly (D)
7 pm ET - the polls are closed in Georgia, Virginia, Indiana &amp; Kentucky. Polls are closed in the Eastern Time Zone of Florida.
With 3% in from KY6 Rep Andy Barr R-KY leads by 247 votes.
Still seeing the same statewide trend in the Indiana Senate race.  For example Braun (R) is getting 5% less of the vote than the GOP candidate for IN Secretary of State.
@dls_ohio will do my best
Very early returns still in KY6, as Democrat Amy McGrath has an early lead over Rep Andy Barr R-KY. But there is a long way to go in that race.
US Senate race in Indiana vs other statewide races there: 		1) Braun is under performing compared to GOP candidates for Auditor, Secy of State, etc	2) Donnelly is over performing Dems in those races	3) The Libertarian is getting about 1.5% more in the Senate race
@Joseph4Meg They are reporting totals from areas where the polls are closed in Indiana and Kentucky.  Same thing will happen next hour in Florida
All of the counties reporting so far in Indiana are rural, more Republican counties.  They have staked Braun to a healthy lead over Donnelly.
And the first votes are coming in from Kentucky as well.  Long way to go. https://t.co/dhk1LcUIzW
Notable in that first little batch of 4800 votes, the Libertarian received 5 percent of the vote.  One would think most of those would come out of the GOP. Something to watch.
And we have our first votes trickling in from Indiana, clearly from a GOP enclave, giving Mike Braun the very early lead over Sen Joe Donnelly R-IN
Just a reminder - most counties now count the 'early vote' first - that is early votes/in person absentee/mail-in absentees/etc.  Then, we get full precincts reporting.
The polls are now closed in the Eastern Time Zone portions of Indiana &amp; Kentucky.  We are underway.  https://t.co/LAUlRxzbFT

President Trump just now touting to reporters the new jobs report released this morning https://t.co/F7MSPDy8Qk
White House touts jobs gains in latest report, as 250,000 jobs were created in October https://t.co/F7MSPDy8Qk
@Karm333 Because the report just came out at 8:30 am ET
Average hourly earnings went up to $27.30 an hour in October https://t.co/wc9dOtwkoW
The last time the economy had a negative jobs month was September 2010.  The closest to breaking that streak was September 2017 https://t.co/yKEBfFTxw0
The number of people reporting that they were working multiple jobs increased in October by 176,000 https://t.co/9rcOEjMVaO
The number of people working part time because they couldn't find a full time job shrank in October, after jumping in September https://t.co/KGBcOEdT3Y
The size of the labor force swelled by 711,000 people in October. Oddly enough, it shrank by that amount last October https://t.co/OI9dZNAYuZ
The Labor Force Participation rate ticked back up to 62.9 percent.  It has played in a small range now for the last four years https://t.co/kMCEmowYaS
Jan-Oct 2018 monthly jobs average - 212,500	Jan-Oct 2017 monthly jobs average - 179,700 https://t.co/REP9sZfo4z
The U6 - considered the broadest measure of unemployment - ticked back down in October to 7.4% https://t.co/AO5aFFyOry

The hundreds of websites for counties and their local elections also tell a story.  Many are really good. And many are really, really bad, with limited information
But I can go to Crook County, Wyoming - much smaller pop. than Dodge City/Ford County, and there are more polling places https://t.co/v8hW9GH4qL
The fact is that every state/county/city/town does it differently.  Finney County, KS is of similar size as Dodge City and has 5 polling places https://t.co/Jj9WrtwXLT
Dodge City, KS has about 27,000 people. It is located in Ford County, which - if this document is correct - has 4 voting locations (total) for a county of about 34k https://t.co/y1zyinX570

The President offered no proof for that claim either
When Pence said he had been told Venezuela was behind the caravan, Trump interjected that maybe Democrats were too

About his claim there are Middle Easterners in the caravan in Mexico, Trump admits he has no proof; "there's no proof of anything"
The President keeps using the world "resolution" to describe his tax cut - which is an odd legislative term for that type of bill
