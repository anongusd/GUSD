@kharyp That means a lot to me @kharyp. It's mutual.
THIS QUESTION üëáüèΩ https://t.co/weVh5UO9sr
THREAD (cont.)		My father taught me that the peacemaker gets a good chunk of the beating. Getting in the middle of a raging fight is never easy. But I strongly believe that spending more time on Bernie's negatives than on other candidates' positives will be a fruitless exercise.
THREAD (cont.)		I make no apology for trying to bring people together to fight the dangerous, extremist, far-right Republican Party. I grew up in Beirut's war zone, where neighbors, friends, and relatives fought one another, then eventually made peace for the greater good.
THREAD (cont.)		By reaching out and setting aside the hard feelings from 2016, I was able to get past the broad brush with which so many were painted. Principled Dems/progressives/leftists on both sides of the Clinton-Sanders breach got swept up in the bitterness of the fight.
THREAD (cont.)		But I've always kept my eye on the prize: A more progressive, just, fair, and equal America. And to do that, I took a hard, honest look at my relationship to progressives who genuinely took my defense of Hillary as an attack on their principles.
THREAD (cont.)		In 2016, @LeelaDaou and I were on the front lines of the fight to defend Hillary from character attacks. We faced death threats, mockery, and venomous personal attacks. I "vetted Bernie" in piece after piece. I was seen as the sworn enemy of the Sanders camp.
THREAD (cont.)		So now, I have Hillary supporters who I've known for years, calling me a "Bernie bro" and accusing me of trying to stop them from "vetting Bernie." They claim I'm pushing an unrealistic idea of "unity." The irony is beyond rich...
THREAD (cont.)		There's another benefit to staying relentlessly positive and bolstering your candidate of choice: If the candidate you oppose secures the nomination, you've given as little fodder as possible to the extremist GOP.		BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE IN 2020.
THREAD (cont.)		And there's a practical consideration: For every Hillary supporter who is furious at Sanders and his surrogates, there's a counterpart on the Sanders side. WE WILL NEVER RESOLVE THOSE DISPUTES. Descending into a futile cycle of recrimination helps no one.
THREAD (cont.)		And yes, I see it as a binary choice. In a field this big (and growing) ATTENTION is the ultimate currency. An experienced candidate can use the friction of negative attention to position themselves as a frontrunner. Which is why amplifying your candidate is best.
THREAD (cont.)		I believe the best STRATEGIC move in a crowded field is to focus maximum positive attention on your candidate. So, if you oppose Sanders and support Harris, you'll get your desired outcome by talking up Harris rather than talking down Sanders. And vice versa.
THREAD: ON "VETTING BERNIE"		I'm not on Team Bernie. I'm not on Team Hillary. I'm not on Team any Dem politician. I'm on Team defeat Trump and the GOP. And in that spirit, I've been calling on supporters of all candidates to focus energy on boosting their preferred candidate.
@Ange_Amene @melsonite @mgranville1 @matt_in_boston I disagree. I believe that focusing so much attention on one candidate, positive or negative, actually helps them become the perceived front-runner. In a crowded field, it's all about getting noticed. And friction is a surface an experienced candidate can use in their favor.
@atoughbroad @melsonite @mgranville1 @matt_in_boston @Ange_Amene @MalcolmNance Huh?
@PhoenixWomanMN Do you believe the 2016 debates (rigged vs. not rigged, etc.) will ever be resolved? I don't. So I'm suggesting a forward-looking strategy of giving maximum attention to great 2020 Dem candidates. Do you disagree?
@PhoenixWomanMN I've been defending Harris, Warren, etc. Much of my community is Hillary voters so I address many of my concerns/suggestions to them. It's not about "laying off" Bernie. It's about avoiding falling into the terrible cycle of 2016. We all win by boosting our preferred candidate.
@melsonite @mgranville1 @matt_in_boston @Ange_Amene "We" didn't do that. My wife and I were on the front lines of the fight to defend Hillary from character attacks. We faced death threats, mockery, personal attacks, etc. I "vetted Bernie" in piece after piece. I was the sworn enemy of the Bernie left.
@mgranville1 @matt_in_boston @Ange_Amene Again, you're misconstruing my argument, as are those who are attacking me. There is limited time in a day, and limited days in an election. I'm saying that the BEST way to help your candidate win is to relentlessly boost their positives and defend them from attacks. That's it.
@matt_in_boston @Ange_Amene @mgranville1 What do you get that I don't get? I'm genuinely curious. Are you saying you know how to defeat Bernie Sanders in the primary?
@notcapnamerica @matt_in_boston @Ange_Amene @mgranville1 Lucrative in what way, exactly? And am I calling you a "sellout" for expressing your opinions about trying to defeat the GOP?

@mgranville1 I didn't say vetting is tearing down a candidate. I think there are very raw feelings from 2016, on both sides, and it's having a negative impact on the 2020 race. We have so many great candidates and I'm simply trying to encourage people to focus on their positives.

I think anyone who wants to defeat the threat from GOP extremists (Trump, McConnell, Pence, Miller, Graham, etc.) should refrain from tearing down 2020 Dem candidates. That goes for supporters of ALL candidates.		We MUST work together despite the scars of 2016. https://t.co/tIXxb7IEQK
@CANDRA_51_61 @OkieLibSherry Huh? You're telling me not to ask for evidence to refute someone making a false point about me?
@maxwellpower @OkieLibSherry Give me a single example of me defending Sanders, let alone "vociferously." Just one.
@OkieLibSherry Give me an example of an "attack on Democrats." Just one example.
@september_gurl I haven't "morphed" into anything. I've been fighting for progressive issues since Bush was president. I still defend Hillary from sexist smears. I haven't "chastised" anyone - I'm simply trying to bring people together to fight the GOP. (And no need to apologize.)
TO SUPPORTERS OF ALL 2020 DEM CANDIDATES:		Too much is on the line for us to give ammunition to Trump and the extremist GOP.		The best strategy is to boost/defend your candidate.		If you disagree with another candidate, PLEASE FOCUS ON ISSUES AND REFRAIN FROM CHARACTER ATTACKS.

@Ange_Amene I'm making a reasoned argument for what I think is the best strategy, which is for us to all focus on boosting our preferred candidate. People can disagree in good faith.
@Ange_Amene I of all people know the hard feelings lingering from 2016. My concern is that my feed is filled with an inordinate focus on Sanders, when I'm eager to see my friends/followers amplify their preferred candidate. I think it's smart strategy and good politics.
@Deoliver47 Denise - as I've said repeatedly, my argument is that no matter how someone feels about Sanders, the most effective strategy is to devote the maximum time to boosting/defending the candidate they like most. Do you disagree?
@Ange_Amene The old conflict is Clinton v. Sanders. And nowhere have I said Dems shouln't express their concerns about any candidate. I'm arguing specifically that the best strategy to have your preferred candidate win is to spend the maximum time you have bolstering/promoting them.
@PoliticalKel @armandodkos @Africanfighter Where did I defend any candidate in all these tweets? I'm arguing that Dems should focus their energies on boosting the candidate they like. Do you disagree with that approach?

@EstherGeppert I've been tweeting this at everyone for weeks now, not just HRC supporters. This tweet was sparked by what I see as an inordinate focus on Sanders in my feed. I'd love to see more positive tweets about the other candidates. I think it's a better strategy to defeat the GOP.

DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WERE WRONG not to walk out en masse during the sham #Kavanaugh confirmation.		THEY WERE WRONG to avoid #impeachment hearings after voters gave them the House majority.		THEY WERE WRONG not to call for lawful, non-violent mass action to oppose Trumpism.
If I'm wrong, I'll happily eat crow and celebrate the health of our democracy, but I've been saying Trump is likely to escape #Mueller's clutches since 2017 and nothing has changed my view. And Trump's victory lap will be unlike anything we've seen.
The underlying act is working with a hostile foreign power to undermine our free and fair elections, MUCH, MUCH worse than Watergate.		And yet, GOP leaders have circled the wagons and Dems have avoided impeachment and/or calls for lawful, non-violent mass action.		#MuellerReport
I'VE EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ON #MUELLER FROM DAY ONE.		Trump obstructed justice in plain sight and bragged about it to Russian operatives in the Oval Office. 		THAT'S UNQUESTIONABLY AN INDICTABLE/IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE.		If he remains in office, it is an abject failure of our system.

@TapouTPunkASS 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot at point blank range for holding a toy and the responding officers rendered no assistance as he lay dying in the snow for FOUR MINUTES. There were no charges. But there will be a bigger outcry on the right over Smollett. THAT is my point.
And anyone on the right calling this "whataboutism" doesn't know what the term means. I'm not minimizing Smollett's act (if reports of a staged attack are true). I'm showing the skewed moral reasoning on the right, where a hoax generates more outrage than ACTUAL RACIAL INJUSTICE.
From the very beginning, I didn't tweet at all about Smollett, but I'm doing so now because of the right-wing outrage machine being so ridiculously selective. Once they truly reject racism and bigotry in their own party, we can take them more seriously.
Tamir Rice is a perfect example of extreme injustice that receives little more than shrugs among right-wingers. Yet the Smollett case will have them jumping up and down crying foul. What kind of priorities are those?
I'll elaborate: If it's true that #JussieSmollett staged his attack, that's horrible and reprehensible. But my point stands: there is no moral equivalence between one individual perpetrating a hoax and the racist and homophobic violence that elicits far less outrage on the right.

As I said yesterday, the Native American issue isn't good for Warren, but NO CANDIDATE IS FLAWLESS, and things should be placed in context. Hillary screwed up with the emails, but 600 days of consecutive coverage was insanely disproportionate. Same holds true for Warren.

To be clear, "YES" is my unequivocal answer. Harris gave a more nuanced response, which should be available once CNN posts a transcript.
At the #HarrisTownHall, @KamalaHarris was asked if the existence of multi-billionaires is "morally indefensible." 		The answer is YES. There should be no such thing as a billionaire in a world where children starve.

Anything short of indictment will be spun as exoneration by Republicans and will embolden and empower Trump and his apologists.
Since 2017, I've been predicting the #Mueller investigation will NOT take down Trump. I've also argued that House Dems shouldn't wait for Mueller to begin the impeachment process.		I hope I'm wrong, but I have a bad feeling about where this is all headed.

@princessmom122 My point is that it's utterly useless to refight 2016 in 2020. There's far too much pent-up rage. Best to advocate positively for our candidates and avoid rehashing old battles.
@admiralmpj I don't use the term "bros" but my advice to fellow Hillary voters is to stay focused on what's positive about your 2020 candidate. Getting sucked into the vortex of negativity only helps the GOP. And there's so much residual anger that it's useless to add more fuel to the fire.
@princessmom122 You're putting words in my mouth.
As I've said, I'm going to do my best to bring people together. And I know that those who get in the middle of a raging fight take heat from both sides. As my dad used to teach me, the peacemaker gets much of the beating. But I see no option other than to try to seek Dem unity.
ON BERNIE, HILLARY, AND 2020.		It's abundantly clear that the scars of 2016 have not healed. This does not bode well for Dems to take back the White House.		I urge everyone to stay focused on what's positive about their preferred candidate. Let's not do the GOP's dirty work.

@deplorablelance Again, where is the Bible verse EXPLICITLY prohibiting abortion? I'm not talking about the moral question of whether it's right or wrong, I'm asking how you can base the anti-choice view on the Bible. Especially when children are killed in all sorts of brutal ways in the Bible.
@Alaskanhomy So you're agreeing that abortion is not explicitly prohibited in the Bible?
@deplorablelance Are you talking about Jeremiah 1:5? Do some more research -- it has nothing to do with prohibiting abortion.
@a10sigh So you're agreeing that there's no explicit prohibition against abortion in the Bible?
@Darkvader1776 @DLoesch So you agree that abortion is NOT explicitly prohibited in the Bible? And who are you to decide what Godly is?

The MAGA cap represents support for the atrocity of kidnapping children from asylum-seeking parents, locking them in ice-cold holding cells, tossing them in cages, and using them to intimidate other migrants.		WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT? https://t.co/7XeHuOW3oq
Look, NOWHERE in the Bible is abortion explicitly prohibited. If anything, children are killed by horrific means throughout the Bible. People can oppose choice, but claiming that opposition to abortion is about Christianity is baseless.
To everyone arguing "Thou shalt not kill" is about abortion: 		Newer translations are "You shall not murder." NOWHERE does the Bible say abortion is murder. 		Not to mention the Bible has children dashed against rocks, rebellious sons stoned to death, and daughters burned alive.

I still think Dems should have walked out on the #Kavanaugh hearings and called for a mass protest or strike. And I also think that if #Mueller has anything substantial on Trump, he's taken too long to reveal it. We've lost SCOTUS, and that will have generational repercussions.

FINAL POINT: Organized trolls and bots are going to try to create discord among Democrats and progressives. Let's not fall for it.
THREAD (3/3): #BERNIE vs #BETO		Neither #BernieSanders nor #BetoORourke have announced if they are running. Supporters of each should feel free to battle out the issues, BUT AVOID CHARACTER ATTACKS. We cannot afford to give needless ammunition to the GOP.
THREAD (2/3): #BERNIE vs #BETO		A character attack directly impugns the honesty, integrity, and/or ethics of a candidate. Examples: Candidate X is a liar. Candidate Y is immoral. An issue debate is perfectly acceptable, i.e. Candidate Z is wrong on health care, the economy, etc.
THREAD (1/3): #BERNIE vs #BETO		The 2020 Dem primary is going to be intense one way or the other. The stakes are too high for it not to be. Heading into 2019, we'll see lots of early maneuvering and skirmishes. That's fine, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT CHARACTER ATTACKS.

@RegulatoryHell I've only been saying it for 20 years, but thanks.
@KMC4wauk @Growsbeak @Lkgrube @notcapnamerica @_WeStandUnited Wrong. I didn't "chastise Dems" - I was referring to the spectacle itself, which should never have happened if we had a dignified president. Pelosi said the same. My follow-up tweet said I agreed with Dems. Part of why we fight the GOP is to restore honor, respect, and integrity.
@axlsgirl13 @notcapnamerica Thanks for taking the time to go through my tweets. It's true that people sometimes form impressions without seeing specific things I've said. As for Bernie/Hillary, months ago I decided to step away from that fight. I just don't think it helps in our battle with the far right.
@ChrisNelson64 @notcapnamerica I've called out misogyny and white supremacy wherever it is, right, left, or center. That doesn't mean I have to be at odds with the many principled people on the left who are also fighting injustice. I think it's a mistake to enter 2019 fighting a 2016 primary battle.
@Growsbeak @Lkgrube @notcapnamerica @_WeStandUnited A few months ago, I publicly stated that I felt it was time to move on from the 2016 primary. And I stand by that. But the focus of my politics for two decades has been resisting GOP extremism. And that's what I do, day in and day out.

@axlsgirl13 @notcapnamerica There are two distinct objectives in my mind: 1. Defeat right-wing extremism, racism, nativism, etc. and the GOP that promotes it. 2. Restore dignity to the office after Trump has done severe damage to it.		Those are not mutually exclusive.
@BluthX @HoarseWisperer @notcapnamerica @denver_rose There's a huge distinction between the satisfaction of Pelosi schooling Trump, which I never disputed, and maintaining the dignity of the office, which Pelosi alluded to herself by not wanting to indulge him.

@JJFan18 @notcapnamerica Do you have any tweets that demonstrate your point? Does "fighter" have to do with going after Republicans? Can you show me where I've changed my stance about the GOP?
@ChrisNelson64 @notcapnamerica In your mind, is the main fight against Republicans and their regressive policies? Because if so, please show me where my stance has changed/softened in two decades.

Yes, rightwingers are infuriated about my tweet holding the GOP accountable. I've been getting a barrage of hate mail and tweets all day. They categorically refuse to accept the FACT that the far right is responsible for the vast majority of extremist violence. https://t.co/akMJcUYiFD

Is it me or do rightwingers completely ignore facts?		I keep posting detailed stats showing the vast majority of extremist violence is from the far right and they keep responding with pictures of Steve Scalise. That was ONE awful, reprehensible incident, but what does it prove?
CALLING B.S. 		If Trump and the GOP are serious about unity, they will:		disavow every "lock her up" chant, 		stop every attack on the free press, 		end every claim that hordes of migrants are invading America, 		cease every word of praise for murderous foreign dictators.
Do you have facts or just insults to my followers? 		Here are my stats:		The GAO found that from 9/12/01 to 12/31/16, violent extremists caused 225 deaths, of which106 were killed by far-right extremists and 119 by radical Islamist extremists. https://t.co/5FA87e0yQ9

WAIT, WHAT?? 		The @nytimes took a cheap shot at the Clintons in a story about A BOMB BEING SENT TO THEM?		https://t.co/SNbt4wcbfV
@yellowredsparks @Bennythesnitch @AlTrumpTrain @GOP No, I corrected the fallacy that one incident (Scalise) somehow disproves the point that the far right is responsible for the vast majority of extremist deaths. Whataboutism is you writing "Scalise" as though somehow that one word makes up for your lack of data.
UGH, Twitter. It's irritating to have to wade through Russian bots to debate Americans about U.S. politics.
They are being incited by the PRESIDENT. On a daily basis. And the cowardly GOP leadership has abandoned any shred of oversight. https://t.co/JXVzB59JNL
To the chronic whataboutists:		1. The OVERWHELMING majority of extremist violence is from the far right.	2. Yes, I've condemned threats/violence from the left.	3. I never condone violence, unless in self-defense.	4. YOU CONTROL ALL THREE BRANCHES - OWN IT		https://t.co/RdaD5qkxvK
