We need to respect as he’s the president. 😬
@AprilDRyan Horrible that people fly this. Where’s the RESPECT for @POTUS ?  He’s our president whether you like him or not!  Shame!!!
@NJParaUnityExpo @chipcoffey Holy mackerel. I need to start heading east on vacation!  I’m missing out!
@_Darcizzle_ Please thank him for his service. It’s folks like him that let the rest of us sleep safe every night.
@MSNBC There are enough eyes on this issue that the truth will come out....
@_SJPeace_ Awww!
@MMFlint Another Michael Moore movie?!?  You can’t make this stuff up!
@kathygriffin Oh Kathy. Do NOT try and justify what YOU did to squash your career. You actually thought your stunt up and THATS the scary part!
@ananavarro Then hush, finally!
@abbydphillip Keep looking. You’re saying things YOU cannot back up yourself. Where’s your research - news person?!? @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@KamalaHarris Kamala, you needed to advocate this plan from day one instead of shooting your mouth off about those issues you know nothing about!  I’d love for you to take a stance on something that will really make a difference to all of us. Geez! 🙄
RT @AbbyGirlCalif: @BetsyDeVosED @PattyMurray BETSY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR OUR SCHOOLS?!?!?  NOTHING!! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@kathygriffin Jealous Kathy?  Quit flapping your gums...Er...fingers. Your tweets are empty!
@CNN You guys have WAY too many commercials!  If you’re #1 like you say, cut them down. It’s ridiculous!
@chipcoffey https://t.co/Z8EIeKK3UH
@thehill Oh he’s just a cueball wanna be.
@jimsciutto @joshscampbell Uh oh....
RT @kcranews: Placer County deputies seek help finding ID theft suspect https://t.co/k1XcoqgiVw https://t.co/LtyRr8hU36
@HuffPost She DOES have a horse face, and nipples look about horse-like too!!  Hahaha. REAL women ROCK!
@KamalaHarris Ok. Find your own challenge. It’s nice you’re standing up, however crossing your arms is inappropriate. Body language people!
@AP Of course...
@chipcoffey @amybruni Awww. I’m so very sorry for your loss, Amy. I just lost my dad. It’s very hard but I know he’s in a much better place and with my mom again. Prayers for peace and comfort 🙏. Abby
@BetsyDeVosED @PattyMurray BETSY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR OUR SCHOOLS?!?!?  NOTHING!! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@SenatorCollins @jaketapper I like Senator Collins. She’s good people.
@AP Uh oh
@BreitbartNews Oh god. Look at that face!  Says it all!
@RealJamesWoods LOL!  Great answer!
@danabrams @observer @ambotv Ack!
@cnni Get to the truth Secretary!  Horrible actions. If we turn the other cheek, we are as horrible as those who did this!
@redsteeze Who cares?
@thehill Oooh. B A C K F I R E !
@AccurateFishing @CaptMarciano Catch and release I hope??
@AP Shame on him. Let’s put him in the lions den, naked - and see how he likes it. Bastard!
@RealJamesWoods Uh. Her nasty attorney THINKS he’s in the running for 2020. Dropped the porn puss like a hot potato. LMAO!
@TMZ He needs to look for his sanity while he’s there!! 🤪
@PGE4Me The wind here in Pine Grove the other night was horrible!  Honestly, I’m thankful that there wasn’t any power to spark a fire!  What’s worse - the alternative?  I love my house and don’t want it going up in flames!! But, it would be really nice if it would go back on now!! 🙄
@TalonDrone @PGE4Me Parts of Pine Grove are still out. Me!  lol

@kcraFinan BAD BAD winds in Amador County. 2500’ level. House fire as well. Spreading fast!
@chipcoffey It’s awful when you just want outta there!!
@kevinolearytv @ABCSharkTank Hey, quit being such a pompous ass. Give some of your millions to help our homeless families. There are babies living on the street. Do the right thing!
@IvankaTrump Where’s @BetsyDeVosED ??  She’s NOT doing ANYTHING for our schools!!  We need her REPLACED IMMEDIATELY!!
@TMZ Get some serious help already!
@MichaelAvenatti @realDonaldTrump @THR You’re such an ass. Yup, a porn lawyer. It shows with this stupid-ass tweet!!
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump Hey, Mr. President.... where’s @BetsyDeVosED ??  She’s done NOTHING for our failing schools and our precious children. WHEN is she releasing a plan to improve??  She’s doing NOTHING but riding coattails!  REPLACE WITH EXPERIENCE!!  You OWE us that!
@Zak_Bagans @travelchannel Ok. It was s c a r y !!!
@marklevinshow I can’t stand @donlemon. @CNN you need new blood in that time slot!  You’re losing your audience. This, another Tweet,  helps prove the point. Lemons news casts are biased, extremely negative and he pulls random shit out of thin air to TRY and make it interesting. NOT!
@CNN @jrezaian When I watch his last few shows, I’m trying to see if there are any clues or comments that would give us some insight on what he chose to do. It’s very difficult to watch. He was one of my favorite TV personalities. I’m sad he’s gone. I learned a lot from him. Simple. Thoughtful
@Bakari_Sellers Oh pluuuuese 🙄
@RobertIrvine Vegetating!  😉
@EricTrump @LaraLeaTrump Happy Happy Birthday!!🎉
@LivePDNation Yippy Skippy. @Sean_C_Larkin
@pchdotcom There are fake PCH actors on Twitter. I almost fell for it!
@SymoneDSanders Kanye needs mental help bad!!  It was like watching a train wreck.
@chipcoffey Holy buckets!!  Bundle up!  It’s getting to be that time of the year. Oh how I love winter!  ❄️💧⛈💨
@Asneakypete @thehill Ah ha!  There you go!  😊
@Asneakypete @thehill Ok. I’ll patent my image. My hair is special as well. 🙄
@iamtheMJB @AprilDRyan She’s bitter. It’s obvious
@Asneakypete @thehill Are you serious?  I see that same hairdo every day!  He didn’t ‘invent’ it. It’s hair for Pete’s sake. LMAO!
@thehill She knows.... she’s very aware that she has important work to do right now. I’ll bet after presidency is over, she’ll handle him. lol
@thehill Oh geez. Anyone who patents his hair needs a reality check!
@VP @KidRock @WhiteHouse *on drugs
@GhostAdventures Yay!
@VP @KidRock @WhiteHouse Are you serious?!?  Did you even watch the idiot?  Gotta be in drugs. He’s a basket case and then some!
@thehill Delirious!
@bennyjohnson He’s an idiot. Belongs with the Kardashian’s!  All off their rockers!
@iamtheMJB @AprilDRyan April needs to improve her attitude while she’s on TV. Being sour grapes gets you nowhere!
@thehill Yes, yes he did. You should be locked up @HillaryClinton and you know it. It’s not over. They will expose you for who you really are!!
@LoriGreiner You and all the Sharks need to come together and give your millions to help our homeless families!  There are children living on the streets and in their parents cars. HELP THEM!  If I could, I would!!  YOU ALL CAN! Be hero’s. I dare you!
@piersmorgan I agree!  The stock market plummeted again and the hurricane took out entire cities. And @POTUS met with a lunatic!  NOT good!  FOCUS Mr President. We need you now more than ever. FOCUS!
@piersmorgan He’s a joke!  If I were black, I’d be doing everything I could to separate myself from this guy!!!
@thehill I don’t like Donna, but this time she’s spot on!
@ABCWorldNews Who puts a patent on their hair style?? What a joke!
@DailyMail @piersmorgan Well said Piers!  The guy needs major help. I can’t believe he wasn’t walked out during his rant. Must be the drugs....something made him that way.
@JebBush Where do you even start to rebuild?  Poor people!
@HuffPost He should have been put in a straight jacket when he left the White House!!
@RCSD @wastatepatrol So sorry for your loss. 😢
@CNNnewsroom @AprilDRyan African Americans should be embarrassed that Kanye even represents them or should I say tries to represent them. The guy is nuts!!  Needs serious mental health intervention !!
@CNNTonight @donlemon Seriously, he’s off his rocker. Kardashian’s problem not ours thank God!
@EricTrump Uh, Kayne needs serious mental health intervention. We all saw that very clearly. YIKES! @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@amybruni Prayers to you and your family, Amy. I just lost my dad. It’s very hard but once they are angels, they’re out of pain. I’m so sorry....
@kathygriffin @DLoesch Kathy, you’re just a bitch. Plain and simple. A sick-minded one at that!  Eww.
@LoriGreiner @ABCSharkTank Then give some of your millions to build homes for our homeless population!  All Sharks can afford it. Awful when you flaunt your money. Sad that you don’t ...give
@JanelleBrown117 Hi Janelle, do you all have your own homes in Flagstaff?
@RealDeanCain @TomArnold Tom, you need a major intervention. Don’t you want to live a normal life again?  I don’t feel sorry for many people, however I see you as a sad, lost individual that really needs help badly.
@DeathWishCoffee Yum!
@KCRAtberg Hi Tamara, when do you see us getting rain?  Is it anytime soon?
@CNN Whoa!  Hope the driver was out of that car!! 😱
@Zak_Bagans Oh my. I’ll watch from afar!! 😱
@TheView @MeghanMcCain @MeghanMcCain , I just lost my dad last month. My heart is broken. He was my best friend. It’s going to be very difficult for me to get going again. Life is standing still and I want it this way. Not sure when/if I’ll be motivated again...😢😢
@Alyssa_Milano Oh get a life! Geez!
@KateBolduan @jaketapper Very sad and the destruction is just starting. Poor folks in FL. It’s going to be a hard road back.
@realDonaldTrump @WhiteHouse You should be going. You have enough folks to keep you updated on Hurricane Michael. Those who think you shouldn’t go, don’t understand the role of our @POTUS !  Safe travels Me President.
@GOPChairwoman @AriFleischer @realDonaldTrump Oh @RepMaxineWaters You have major mental health issues. Did you go off your meds recently?
@SenatorCollins Wonderful news!!
@CNN   Ok. Where’s @ChrisCuomo @donlemon @AC360 during this historic storm??  Are you afraid to report around this hurricane?  You ‘seemed’ brave after the last one. Hmmmm.....🤔
@BreitbartNews @MichaelAvenatti You are such a joke!  Your 15 minutes are way over dude!!
@Wishful_wink Mine goes for chicken poopie. lol
@chipcoffey @DRQuam Down right rude!
@KateBolduan Can we watch @donlemon get blown into the ocean, please? 🤣🤣🤣
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SenFeinstein @MSNBC @BreitbartNews @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC Ok. We have a small window of breathing room. Our NEXT FOCUS must be healthcare for all. If anything needs to be ironed out, it’s this. Could break our economies back!!  We need help to resolve!!
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley You’re a jerk, Avenatti!  Go represent your open population!
@donlemon Holy Buckets. Calm the hell down!  How rude to tell a guest to  ‘shut up’. Your show is awful!  Ugh! @CNN
@chipcoffey @joshuagates @Discovery So focused!  I like it!
@TheSharkDaymond Help those less fortunate!
@JasonOverstreet @MichaelAvenatti Oh Avenatti needs to fade.... tired of him and his more than 15 minutes. You’ve overstayed your welcome, dude!
@BreitbartNews We’ll be right there with you Donna!!  😗@donnabrazile
@SteveScalise Hilary needs to just go away. She’s like toilet paper stuck to the bottom of your shoe. Wait....was that her climbing AF One?!?  LOLOL!  🤪
@thehill He’s @MichaelAvenatti a media hog, and needs to fade into the background where he slithered out of!!
@SenFeinstein @BetsyDeVosED is MIA in her job. She needs to be REPLACED!!!  @POTUS
@chipcoffey Whoa! I’m surprised!!  I like her. Very down to earth. Going to be hard to replace her.  Press conference at 7:30 PST.
@CNNPolitics @HillaryClinton - just fade away already. We don’t care what’s in your little mind. Still a sore loser. Honey, it won’t change the outcome.... go- shoo-go.
@StormyDaniels She’s the scum under the gutter water!
@CNN @FoxNews What’s more painful :  Watching @ananavarro on CNN or the blowout football game! 🤣🤣🤣
@CNNPolitics Uh.....yawn....
@thehill @SenatorCollins is the real deal!  Genuine, caring and thoughtful. I really like her!  Wish more of our Senators were like her and @LindseyGrahamSC !
@ABC10 We need rain rain, rain!!  💦💦💦
@thehill She needs to go away already. Boring...... @StormyDaniels
@BreitbartNews @KamalaHarris is a HORRIBLE representativefor my state. A loudmouth that is clueless!
@MJGerson No. @SenFeinstein mishandled the ENTIRE debacle!!  HER FAULT for all of it - period!  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @CNN @FoxNews
@mschlapp @donlemon I’ve lost interest long ago....
@KevinDBishop @LindseyGrahamSC @realDonaldTrump I like Mr. Graham!  Classy!
@BreitbartNews @maziehirono You should be ashamed of yourself!  Look who the racist REALLY is.   In YOUR own words! 😡

@kathygriffin Oh Kathy... you’ve lost all credibility. Do you think we’ve forgotten what you did?  Down-right disgusting!  Go away ..
@StormyDaniels She’s a bimbo. If she’s that upset about her so-called issues, give up the porn crap and fight like a lady!
@AprilDRyan No. I think your type of reporting that doesn’t know when to hush up, is the problem. Look at how you’re treated in the WH briefings with @SarahHuckabee   You never just STOP!
@MichaelAvenatti @RadioFreeTom You’re a jerk who people are sick of!  Go climb back under your rock!!
@PhilipRucker @katierogers I wonder how our @POTUS @realDonaldTrump would communicate on a daily basis WITHOUT cell phones ever existing?!? 🙄🤔
@kevinolearytv @SharkTankABC @mcuban @ABC @TheSharkDaymond @LoriGreiner @BarbaraCorcoran @robertherjavec Sharks, give money to our nations homeless by building homes for them to have a new beginning. YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!!  I dare ALL of you!

@KirstenPowers Well then, quit the job you have and go flip burgers ....
@kathygriffin *shoves soap in your mouth *.
@MMFlint Give it up already. You and @kathygriffin can move to Mexico!
@CoryBooker It better. We are funding your paycheck!
@MichaelAvenatti Dude, time to hush up. No one cares what you think. Represent your porn person like the smut you are....
@kathygriffin Then move to Mexico. Go ahead. I’ll help you pack!
@LoriGreiner @ABCSharkTank I can’t believe you all don’t get together and donate millions of dollars (that you apparently won’t miss) to build houses for our country’s homeless. These people deserve a new start. A miracle to them if you do it. Come on Sharks. Give some up!!  @CNN @FoxNews
@chipcoffey Uh oh... 🤣
@StephenKing Al, COME BACK? @alfranken
@Alyssa_Milano You’re a dried up actor. Time to fade into the background...
@KamalaHarris Let it go. It’s over!

@LoriGreiner @ABCSharkTank @mcuban @TheSharkDaymond @kevinolearytv @BarbaraCorcoran @robertherjavec Sharks need to help our homeless population and build houses for them. These are families, down on their luck. Come on. You all have enough money - give. It’ll make you feel good!

@AngrierWHStaff Oh my. Look at your name. If you’re that unhappy, then get happy. Do something else. Geez
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump @BetsyDeVosED Hey Betsy!!  Where are you??  What are you doing for our school system??  You’re still riding coat- tails. Give it up so we can REPLACE you!!  YOU ARE CLUELESS!!  POTUS, you owe us EXPERIENCE!!
@KamalaHarris This happens in ALL prisons. Major overhaul needed. These are human beings, first!
@LedgerDispatch Wow!
@CNN Alex needs to retire. Brain isn’t as sharp doing this inappropriate action!
@TheSharkDaymond Then donate your millions to help our homeless population. They are the paycheck representing homeless!!!
@chipcoffey @CBEsthetics @glbk7 Handsome!  5-is a great age!  Getting independence. 😊
@ofctimallen @LastManStanding Want the old Mandy back please!!!
@chipcoffey Love the spelling. lol
@MichaelAvenatti @ChuckGrassley Oh Avenatti, go away already. Hunker down with your porn queen (looking kinda haggard these days!)
@chipcoffey Hey, Gallery - your name says it all ...🙄
@chipcoffey You em’, Chip. People forget we are all human before anything else. Maybe if everyone remembers that, the world would be a much kinder place...
@AprilDRyan April, you’re late with this story, as usual.
@Andreaglorygirl @SenFeinstein Feinstein KNEW what she had. It was up to HER and her attorneys to guide the ‘victim ‘ to report PRIVATELY behind CLOSED DOORS. It didn’t need to be shared. She did the wrong thing for this woman and you can see what’s happening. There goes OUR hard earned dollars. Ugh!
@LivePDNation @MCSOFlorida How does one go about buying protective vests for our K9 officers?  I’m sure some fundraising will help. Does anyone know where to start?  If so, please share...
@JanelleBrown117 Looks so good!!  I experimented with my espresso machine. It was fun!!  I found a dab of whipped cream with a little coco sprinkled on top. Yum!  Plus it wakes me up when I start to fade in the afternoons!  😊
@chipcoffey Ooh. Well said, Chip!
@smerconish Ice?!?  Are you serious?!?  If that’s all they find, it’s all they find. No biggie!!
@Alyssa_Milano You are a dried up actor. Go away....
@Lawrence @LindseyGrahamSC I like @LindseyGrahamSC   He’s a good man with good intentions!
@BreitbartNews Hmmmm
@IvankaTrump @NASCAR Ivanka, what is @BetsyDeVosED doing to help our schools??  She’s been silent thus far. Can you please research and REPLACE her already?!?!?  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@TMZ Uh. Not smart. He will be sorry when 50% is demanded and received!  🙄
@ABC Hillary, just give it up already. It’s time you fade into the shadows and STAY THERE!  Sore loser and then some!
@ShannonBream @AriFleischer @johnrobertsFox Uh oh
@MichaelAvenatti @lcmoser OMG!  YOU’RE DISGUSTING!  Porn lawyer!!  Ewwww!🤢
@JustinTrudeau I’m sorry... 😢

@MeghanMcCain   Hi Meghan. I too, just lost my dad to Parkinson’s. He went very quickly. I didn’t have enough time with him but the time I did spend with him -3- years helping him, was priceless. I’d do it over and over again. Just to have one more day.... what I wouldn’t give.
@LivePDNation How sad. People just don’t have any regard for human life any longer. It’s too easy to kill and it’s just getting-worse. My prayers go out to the families. It has to be devastating. 😢
@DrPol I’m on pot no. 2! Yippy Skippy!!

@FlashToso @jsbach2008 @SithRaider @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump &gt;&gt; children, making it far too easy for teachers and parents to fall back on. Computers are highly needed for communication but the eyes, body language and proper language (written too) are just as - if not more important....
@FlashToso @jsbach2008 @SithRaider @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump I agree communication is key with both the giver and the receiver, hopefully understanding and applying what’s needed during that discussion to have a successful outcome. Nowadays, children are taught too much, I feel, in the computer age. Computers are the ‘babysitter’ of our &gt;
@FlashToso @jsbach2008 @SithRaider @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump I graduated in the 70’s. Regular good ole reading, writing and arithmetic. We need to return to that education style. Simple yet understood. At least I’d be able to help my grandchildren with their homework!  Miss those days!!  They fixed something that wasn’t broke!
@jsbach2008 @FlashToso @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Oh my!  Granted, private school is ideal. But when a young family is raising their children in a rural area and both parents work to make ends meet, its extremely difficult to pay for private education. Our teachers are making peanuts but continue to hang in there.
@FlashToso @jsbach2008 @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Oh Michael, I’ve done plenty of research. Again I’m open to discussion on this subject that’s so in need of help. Not just California but our entire school system around the country!  We need help anywhere we can get it. Sparking this discussion is a start!  Keep it up! 😊
@BetsyDeVosED Get busy expanding!!  California is waiting and needs YOUR HELP BETSY !!  Do YOUR JOB!  You’re HORRIBLE in this appointed position. @POTUS needs to REPLACE YOU!!  YOUVE DONE NOTHING THUS FAR!!  You are so clueless!!  @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump REPLACE HER LAZY ATTITUDE!!!
@FlashToso @jsbach2008 @BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump Quality for federal funding is criteria, however, that ‘quality’ is so off kilter because schools have had NO help. The criteria has now made it unattainable so once again she’s not helping, is she?  Catch 22. She’s made it unattainable...

@cpcrck @AriFleischer @jaketapper Grey doesn’t cut it - especially making the statements he’s made. This is OUR president whether you agree with/like him or not. The salacious comments are totally uncalled for. Just smut to sell his book. Not quite the demeanor for a man in his position. No credibility..
@AC360 Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!!!
@realDonaldTrump We need a new governor!  It’s his way or the highway - which those are all falling a part as well. Potholes so big you bottom out!! Poor, poor management!

@ananavarro Yeah, we know!
@BetsyDeVosED Betsy, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump needs to replace you. You have done NOTHING except attend meetings and meander your way through your position. Our precious children MUST HAVE representation to IMPROVE our failing school system!  Move over and make room for experience!

@ananavarro Us Californians are stuck with incompetent leadership. Our taxes are through the roof, home prices-ridiculous, gasoline is ready to hit $4 a gallon....  We need help turning this around. The majority of our citizens are making a lot less than what it costs to live. HELP!

@ananavarro @Comey He’s proven himself to be a money monger. I’ve lost all credibility with the guy. I thought he was better than this!  Sad....
@AriFleischer I thought James Comey was a stand up guy. He’s sank below the line of credibility adding the salacious comments. I guess he wants to add raunchy sections to sell his book. Which, by the way, I’m not buying. I just need to watch his interviews to get the full story!

@RCSD @MastrianniChris How tragic. My prayers are with his family and his fellow partners in blue.
@duggarfam Congratulations!!  God bless your little one!
Mr. Graham, please consider working in the White House. You’d make an EXCELLENT addition to those that surround our @POTUS !!  Seriously, you are well loved and have a level head on your shoulders!!  I believe in you!!
@RealSaavedra @JeffreyGuterman @HealthyFla Dude, you are SICK!  You need mental health treatment. You idiot!
@ABC Your anchor that’s on in Sacramento today is horrible!  So many mistakes in reading from the TelePrompTer and she can’t wing it without shredding it!  Time to replace!!
@CNN That looked like a gun when he pointed it!
@BetsyDeVosED @omarjahwar Betsy, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump need to fire your ass. You haven’t made one change or improvement to our precious children. You continue to be clueless.
@DeputyDiesels @BrownGaro @RCSD Whoa... handsome, handsome man!!!  😉
@Zak_Bagans I live in the area!!  Have fun!  😱
@chipcoffey Ok. Put her in her place, Chip. You’re one of my heroes!!  😊
@BetsyDeVosED @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @IvankaTrump &gt;&gt; Betsy, this activity is more your pace. You need to be REPLACED!!  Our children need someone who is KNOWLEDGEABLE, not riding clueless within your appointed role!!!
@AP What was his explanation?
@CNN @AprilDRyan - let someone else represent @Cnn in press briefing. You’re taking up space and air with your lame questions!  🤭
@newtgingrich @IvankaTrump Ivanka should replace Betsy!  Betsy is totally clueless and is a hindrance on our hard working WH staff!!  @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@CNN I agree with her comment! @PressSec
@AprilDRyan @PressSec April, your questions are always about issues that should be handled on local and state levels. THIS is why you’re not called on in press briefing. You’re a waste of precious time in these meetings!
@CNN EXTREMELY POOR programming when switching to WH news conference after it starts!!  Second day in a row. 👎
@AprilDRyan @StormyDaniels So, I bet you want to take back whatever you said to keep her avoiding you, eh?  Tisk...tisk
@alroker @TODAYshow @nathancongleton Lo kin sharp there Mr. Roker!! 😎
@JudgeFaithTV I always wonder if the IRS watches your show. This isn’t the first ‘un- reputable’ tax person!  Ooh my!!
@CNN Give it up already!  Enough of the sex talk. You’re beating a dead horse at this point!!!  Sex talk on CNN = Slow news day?!?
@Sean_C_Larkin @OfficialLivePD @BrownGaro &gt; I do believe @danabrams would love to have your guns!!!  🤔
@CNN @KellyannePolls Kellyanne, you’d be AWESOME at this position!  You have been the ONE constant, caring, supportive coworker/friend of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump !!  Go for it girl!!  You deserve this and then some!
@AprilDRyan Yuck!
@CynthiaNixon You go girl!! 😉
@realDonaldTrump Better find the rat!  NOT good. Your team is better than this, or are they?? 🤔
CNN: Trump, Kelly furious after leak that Trump was not to congratulate Putin https://t.co/DKYeQUW3Rk @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. You MUST find the leak!  NOT GOOD!!  Your team is better than this, or is it?!?
@FOX40 If anything, she looks like a skank! Ewww. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS  Mr President, cm’on now. Keep it in your pants. You’re lucky to still be married!  Poor Melania- she should take Barron and leave. How embarrassing! @FLOTUS
@BetsyDeVosED You do NOT have experience at all. You need to be replaced. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, Betsy needs to be replaced with experienced, teaching background, will do the absolute BEST for our students individual. THEY DESERVE IT! She’s done nothing and continues to be clueless!!
@sacsheriff @FOX40 @SacCountyCA I’m so so sorry for your loss. Prayers to his partner and family. 😞
@TheDemocrats No death penalty. Seriously, far too harsh!
Wow!  This can actually end homelessness!!  @POTUS @realDonaldTrump FOLLOW THIS!!!!!!!!! https://t.co/8Vsh9ObwIb
I’m shocked this is going on for anotheryear. Ohh my 😱#SisterWives

#Threewivesonehusband  Ok. I admit I watched only to see those very cool houses built into the mountain!!!
@jenguenthner @debflew1 @alroker @TODAYshow Let’s try... I WANTED to give it. Lordy, get a life and just read on....sheesh.
@MeriBrown1 @SisterWives01 Meri, pull up your big girl panties and get over the catfish situation. You are totally OBSESSED!  Why don’t you put that energy into your being a good mother. You’re horrible at it!!  Shame on you!

@FOX40 I’m calling bullshit!  Desperate for press and money hungry. Bye girl.....🤮
@BetsyDeVosED @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Betsy is CLUELESS! She has to go!!  Put in EXPERIENCE for our children. They DESERVE it!!!
@BetsyDeVosED This should have been done over a year ago!  Fire DeVos!!  We need Experience!  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS
@North6162 @NRA @DLoesch OMG. Horrible, horrible post!!!
@BetsyDeVosED Oh blah blah blah. Betsy is treading water!  We need a real secretary!!  @realDonaldTrump
@realDonaldTrump Get rid of Betsy. She’s clueless!  We need experience in this position. It’s not a game. Replace her!
@BetsyDeVosED You’re still clueless. Bluffing our precious students and parents is appalling!  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS needs to replace you immediately!
@TMZ Fire that son of a bitch!  He’s a prick and should go to jail!
@BetsyDeVosED You are way out of your league. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Time to replace this clueless individual!!  Get a real teacher to advocate for our children!
@debflew1 @alroker @TODAYshow Uh, his health will be in jeopardy for a third time.... At least I care enough to say something...it wasn’t rude or unnecessary ...
@HumaneSociety @USDA Oh fuck this!!!
@CBSSacramento Shame on you!
@PeterAlexander @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Then HELP US PLEASE!
@BetsyDeVosED Ditch Common Core Math !  One of your promised actions that you’ve failed to do! @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec
@BetsyDeVosED Learning how to do your job instead of winging it will be a start. You’re clueless!  @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @thehill
@seanspicer May be time to toss your hat back into the WH?  You’d be great knowing what you know now!  Think about it. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @PressSec
@alroker @TODAYshow You’re gaining your weight back....willpower!!!
@JanelleBrown117 The show is falling a part!  No harmony at all. Plus Kody needs to cut that mop!
@POTUS @VP @SpeakerRyan https://t.co/6Uu8ySuzNm
You’re back peddling!  We need someone in your position that knows how to get it DONE! https://t.co/zXpfO4HuGP
@BetsyDeVosED You are clueless in this position. @realDonaldTrump @POTUS needs to put someone else in your position that will Make our schools Great Again!!
@BetsyDeVosED @BetsyDeVos https://t.co/Te4LI4J9wV
@POTUS @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan @VP https://t.co/XhRhwgIvkd
@CNN She needs to be replaced!  Our schools need absolute knowledgeable individual to run this position. She was BAD AND WRONG choice from the jump!!!
@BrownGaro Hi there...  I have a couple of questions.... 1) Are you single?  2). What’s the best way to meet a single peace officer?  I want to find someone to protect me, someone that I’ll feel safe with...  thanks for reading - Abby in California 😉
@CNN @donlemon https://t.co/vkPzAoUBVI

@TheSharkDaymond Wow, Daymond. I’m wishing you well fighting your diagnosis. Stay strong.
@CNN. Why are you not following this hostage situation happening now?!?!? https://t.co/eBj7JThEMB
@LoriGreiner Hi Lori, I have a million dollar idea. But (there’s always a but. lol) I don’t have the funds to implement. Ideas?
@BetsyDeVosED Common Core Math needs to go!  This was one of your promises you made prior to getting your position. Please help parents be able to assist their child especially doing homework. Betsy, you try and use the math our children are subject to!  You will see why change is needed ASAP!
@alroker Mr Roker, it appears you’re gaining weight back. Please watch your intake. Stay healthy!

@WalshFreedom @CNN @jaketapper It’s out of control and is a political show not a town hall for the children and families of Florida!  Shame on all of you. Tapper, get control would ya?!?!?
@_michellecp Michelle, you now have the education so you can choose any path you may want. You’re in an awesome position. This time will be well spent looking for, realizing its for you or not, let me try something else that I may want career path. You’re in a better position than most!  😊
@ananavarro Ana, filthy thoughts!  Of all descriptions, the world is reading the pig thoughts you’re hiding behind. You must like golden showers!  I say let the crap 💩 lay where it falls. In your mouth! @CNN @cnni @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@KC5463 @JanelleBrown117 @TLC @MeriBrown1 Let’s add another husband into the mix!  😂😂😂
@JanelleBrown117 @TLC I love the show but TLC has to minimize Tony’s air time. I won’t be watching if he’s the focus.  Way too demanding. Seriously, he said boobs during wedding pics?!? Very inappropriate! @MeriBrown1 , get with the program. You belong with this family. Midlife crisis is over!
@chrisrock https://t.co/AK3nKQpdhM
@chuckwoolery Throwing my white card on your black card. There.....we are in this together...as we should be. Stop the madness....
@Sweetenlife Hmmm... I was glued to CNN all day and I don’t recall any other coverage other than the school shooting. I still think Brett’s rating chart for yesterday, saying ‘thanks for watching ‘ is very inappropriate...
@BretBaier Oh my God!  You’re worried about your ratings during this horrible tragedy?!?  Man, that’s cold...Shame on you! @BretBaier @CNN
@BarackObama Why the hell didn’t you work on this during your 8-year stint?  You choked. That’s why!
@piersmorgan Obama didn’t do anything while he was in his office except bluff the role he was in. SMH

@BBCWorld Apparently, there were warning signs a year before. They must be reported immediately!!  Kids just read social media and don’t friggin report. You’d be a lot cooler stopping a killer rather then feeling like a snitch!!!
@DanRather The people who kill another human being, have psychological problems. It’s a place to start...
@Walldo I agree!  What can really be done?  Seriously, the guns are already in the bad persons hands!
@CoryBooker And your suggestion is?

@ABC What a bunch of losers!!  Trashing their own city for what...a Super Bowl win?!?  Idiots!!  Plain and simple!!! https://t.co/SSqU9NPKWL
@abcWNN Your morning anchors are horrible!  Time for a change. Seriously, watch from a viewers perspective. They are dumb, banter way too much and are down-right idiots!  I’m changing channels!!!
@JanelleBrown117 I love that you’re focused on your family Janelle. That’s a mom that loves her family...! 💕
@BetsyDeVos https://t.co/taVoJh7tDi
@piersmorgan Awful. Just horrible!  Shame on whom ever printed this!
@Comey Mr. Comey, you can’t tell me that if Trump kept you, you’d be eyebrow deep in the swamp?!?  Honestly.....I do declare....  heh ~~~
@JanelleBrown117 Awesome band! 😉
@SenSchumer You lie like a rug!
@ananavarro Then improve your attitude!!  No pass for your tweet!
@NancyPelosi You’re probably jumping up and down &gt;&gt; liar!
@SymoneDSanders I agree with Sara!  Pelosi is uuggllyy!  Especially when her face reflects how she feels. Yuck!
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump Uh. Are you done rolling your tongue in your mouth?!?  Pretty gross last night. 🤢
@AP Spittle. Eww! And it got worse!! 🤮

@CoryBooker You need to knock that puss off your face too!  NOT flattering. 😠
@NancyPelosi  Wipe that puss off your face. NOT flattering whatsoever!  😠
@CNN OMG!  You bunch of whininy babies.
@OMAROSA Ooh. They are gonna chew you up and spit you out!  Be on guard!!  It’s coming!
@JanelleBrown117 Janelle, don’t be so negative on things you’re not sure of, ie: the dancing. You were so mean about it to @rosecolored6   Sad to watch. She really kept her cool with your comments. Go back and watch. You’ll understand.
@LivePDUK @Sean_C_Larkin @LivePDNation   I feel this gentleman should be recognized by the Live PD hosts!  Maybe start a ‘Citizen Cares’ segment. Mention the good deed on the next weeks show play the clip. Like you do for the missing persons segment. The good deed will spread ten-fold!
@Zak_Bagans Zak, do you ever go back to locations that you’ve had the best experiences?  If so, I vote for The Stone Lion Inn!!  Holy buckets it’s haunted!!  😱

@JanelleBrown117 I just love your reasoning. You are so aware of your entire family... and resolving issues as they arise. You should be very proud of yourself. You’ve worked so hard and you did it!!  That’s a wonderful gift. 😊.        PS&gt; Happy Anniversary!
@seanhannity @Acosta What a Putz!  How embarrassing!!  😱
@ananavarro Uh oh... Tweet deeeeeenied!
@JanelleBrown117 I have Snookie. Definitely not a purebred!  lol https://t.co/oWt12bfCs4
@bekahboo1290 @ananavarro I agree with her encouraging remarks for EVERY victim. She just went too far (my observation) on her closing remarks. Reminded me of the judge that represented Anna Nicole’s trial. Too commercial... to chatty at the end - definitely not an upcoming TV Judge!
@bekahboo1290 @ananavarro I did not agree with her inserts - too much, wouldn’t stop talking. The victims needed to be heard. Not this wanna be movie star judge during sentencing. She did not know how the victims felt. Should have ended with their comments, not hers
@PARISDENNARD @POTUS @FLOTUS Happy Anniversary!! 💕
@ananavarro Windbag. Playing more for the cameras then the dirt bag she was sentencing!
@ananavarro This judge likes to hear herself talk. Get it over with already!
@JanelleBrown117 Janelle, you are so sweet!
@OfficerMorton Deer ridge inn, Pioneer CA or Mel’s Diner in Jackson, CA to  add to your collection!!

@BetsyDeVosED They are DENIED the learning process we all learned &gt; WITHOUT COMMON CORE MATH!  Why does it take 4 steps to get to 4+4=8???  You do math this way Betsy!  You will HATE IT!
@JudgeFaithTV — ‘what is wrong with you?’ To the defendant on the 10-mil dollar bowling alley. Too funny!! 🤣😂🤣
@JudgeFaithTV  Re:  Good Samaritan Twice Bitten’ This plaintiff needs a good ‘what for!’ to wake her up! The past always influences the future. If she doesn’t grow up, she’ll be talking to her sisters from behind bars!  I’ve seen this same scenario. Oh my!
@kcraFinan   This is great!! https://t.co/sgZRbB7uZ7
@cnni Agreed!
@kcranews @NAACP re: MLK walk in Sacramento. I’d like to make a recommendation. Next year, have the participants bring a new coat or a new blanket that can be given to our homeless population. If this walk is in Stockton, do the same. How wonderful for the recipients!
@Reuters What ever happened with the vacation he took on Air force One?  Did he pay our tax dollars back?!?
@JudgeFaithTV Great analogy Judge Faith. A lesson can be learned by the feedback you’ve provided. Spot on again!  I tune in for your guidance every day. Even Juan educates at times. It is greatly appreciated!
@AprilDRyan @realDonaldTrump @POTUS @jaredkushner @IvankaTrump @PressSec &gt;&gt;. I learned a long time ago... whether the president said this or not, it’s the PERCEPTION it was said. POTUS must apologize either way to move on and get down to business.
@ananavarro Geez. Your eyeballs are gonna pop out of your head this morning. Quit yelling and talk normal. CNN anchor can’t even get a word in. And loosen your lips. Turning purple!
@IvankaTrump @realDonaldTrump @jaredkushner @PressSec President Trump-  Damage control.... This is awful!  Come out and say you’re sorry!  You need to fix this! https://t.co/2PszcQmGT6
@JudgeFaithTV ‘Eviction Spanking’. I can’t believe this guy spanked a 27-year old!!  He went to jail for 6-months. Listening to him, lesson was NOT learned!  😳 he’ll take a ride with blue again. WoW!

@jeffsessions Please leave marijuana industry alone. Let’s collect billions in taxes instead of giving it to the cartels. It’s a no-brainer!   Retweet if you AGREE!  @POTUS @realDonaldTrump
@Sean_C_Larkin Ooh...Sticks!  You make my night mister! 😉
@JudgeFaithTV Oh too funny!  You take Juan to the club. 😂🤣😂. Classic!  That’s great!
@RobertIrvine I sure do!!  Just bought a Robert Irvine hoodie. LOVE IT!  My workout sweat shirt. ENCOURAGEMENT B~A~B~Y!
@kcraFinan - Pine Grove. Disappointed we don’t have any rain. What gives? https://t.co/kd53pY7r6F
Use this website to let your voice be heard on the legalization of marijuana. Tax dollars generated will help with states budget. Don’t let illegal trade once again steal our hard earned money!  https://t.co/gyETUxdEGx
@jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump @POTUS.    Retweet!!	Legalized pot &gt; Tax money going into each states coffers INSTEAD OF THE CARTELS coffers (in the billions)  It’s a NO-BRAINER!!  Leave pot industry alone! Keep it legal!! Keep dirty money out of the US!
Retweet!!	Legalized pot &gt; Tax money going into each states coffers INSTEAD OF THE CARTELS coffers (in the billions)  It’s a NO-BRAINER!!  Leave pot industry alone! Keep it legal!! Keep dirty money out of the US! https://t.co/2XMqqhkRXy
@thehill @jeffsessions @realDonaldTrump @POTUS &gt;&gt; isn’t it better to have OUR taxes on sale of marijuana go to OUR states instead of the CARTEL get illegal USA monies?!?  It’s a no-brainer. Rethink your position Mr Sessions!!  Leave MJ industry alone!
@AprilDRyan Dig yourself a hole and hide in it if you’re disappointed April. As a news person, you should know better.....
@JudgeFaithTV Bogus House is just that!  The defendant tries to plead stupid but Judge Faith is all over the scam. Body language is a dead giveaway as well. Defendant is clearly trying to dissuade the issues. NOT!!  Hehe!
@SymoneDSanders Uh. I don’t get it ?!?  Explain yourself...
@RobertIrvine PLEASE control your guests. There’s nothing we can hear with them SCREAMING at one another!  Man oh man!!! 😳
@JudgeFaithTV It amazes me how many people lie while under oath. I wish that those bold-face lying could have a penalty to pay or even better, mandatory jail time. That would send the loudest message to those who swear to tell the truth!  Monies could go to charity. It’s a win-win!!
@LoriGreiner Lori, I have a multi-million idea but no $$$ to start up. How can I have someone listen to me and that I can trust?
@Zak_Bagans @AaronGoodwin Watching ‘Golden Ghost Town’ and I’m scared to death!!  Holy buckets!  😱
@CBSSacramento Hoping the $$$ goes to the cause, not in their pockets!!!
@ARmastrangelo @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr @IvankaTrump OK. Our President needs to lose weight. It’s not healthy. He’s gained at least 30# since taking office. Thanks for reading.
@JudgeFaithTV Credibility is as important as integrity. You can interchange them - and once lost, you can never get it back!

@JudgeFaithTV Holy Buckets!!  What a sister!  I got dizzy listening to her on all the cars she traded for!  She’ll be paying forever on cars she doesn’t even own any longer. The defendant once again doesn’t care about paying back family. She just plain ‘doesn’t get it’. 😳 Shame on her!
@OfficialLivePD @Sean_C_Larkin @LivePDK9 I’m watching Live PD reruns. I can’t believe Tulsa pulled out of this show!  Of all departments, these men and women in blue do a fantastic job -  - including respecting everyone - even the bad guys! https://t.co/T89HykJ7x7

@TheSharkDaymond A Leader. You should know that employees must be trustworthy and loyal. You wouldn’t be in that position if you didn’t demonstrate these traits from the start of your employment. Training management is critical. They must be able to lead and mentor employees.

@piersmorgan Eww. *gag*
@DStv_Kenya @JudgeFaithTV @TLC_Africa My goodness!  Money Hungry Sister is one of the best examples where the plaintiff DOES NOT believe in ‘blood is thicker than water’. She feels entitled and she shouldn’t. She needs a wake up call Judge Faith!  Sad situation for her older sisters!!

@BetsyDeVosED WE MUST GIT RID OF COMMON CORE!!  Back to basics that we ALL learned from!  Your campaign promise!!  Uh....WAITING! https://t.co/nNZYT4nphL
@JudgeFaithTV Judge Faith, it amazes me how many family members need to sue for monies owed! The lending family member loaned with love and a willingness to trust, ultimately receiving payback. Sad to see broken relationships over a simple act of kindness.
@LivePDK9 Although they will never be a canine officer, they can smell their treats from a mile away!  Snookie and Casper... https://t.co/YNaMKN9my9
@realDonaldTrump Your tweet finally boomeranged and hit you in the ass. Admitting you KNEW about lying to the FBI, not just to Pence. Now will you silence your social media?  You’re in a world of hurt now. 😱😱😱
@OfficialLivePD @Sean_C_Larkin Ok...question. If someone is in custody in the back of a patrol car...and they need to use the restroom,....how do you handle?  YIKES!! 😱
@EricTrump SOOOOOOO CUTE!  Just adorable!
@Comey Holy buckets.... The man finally speaks! Chime right in there Mr. Comey!
@danabrams As long as @Sean_C_Larkin is co-hosting, I’m there!!  Thank you Sean, for explaining your side - the cop side of these calls. I’ve gained immeasurable respect for what officers do across the country. Thank you for protecting us!
@TheSharkDaymond @BarbaraCorcoran Hi Daymond. I hope you’re feeling well!  Take care of yourself. Thank you for the daily encouragement!  Please keep your text messages coming!  Abby. 😊
@RebeccaKKatz @KCRAKevin @perlmutations  LOL!  Wanted to share with you!  😂
@JudgeFaithTV Judge Faith, your passion and caring for your guests is unmeasurable. Your wisdom and sincerity comes out to help those who need help in navigating their lives. This case is a prime example. 😊
@JudgeFaithTV What a powerful message today!  I wish my nephew had someone who could have given him the advice this young man received. May have avoided 54-year prison sentence....
@JudgeFaithTV Nice lesson for the defendant!  Shame on her for driving. 😱 She would have kept driving if you didn’t penalize her!
@DrPol @ChuckPol You’re OK! Thanksgiving is over! Relax and have fun!  Feather Bump!
@ananavarro @AvantGardensMia Put up your own tree. Lazy jerk!
@JudgeFaithTV   Judge Faith, do you ever check back in with your guests on the show, ie: The couple with the paternity test taken?  I’m curious if the father is actively involved with his child.
@JudgeFaithTV   ‘I don’t need your help’. 😂😂😂😂😬
@tmac2044 @JudgeFaithTV Judge Faith, you held your cool and at the same time laid into the rude defendant who walked out with his tail between his legs! And Juan’s a great partner!  Love the way he protects you!  Classy! 💪
@Sean_C_Larkin @_aislinnrose Merlot...my favorite with some fine cheese, a good movie and a warm snuggle with someone you love! 🍷😉
@OfficialLivePD Cracks me up... backed into a pond. Classic move. 🤔
@RealPressSecBot Leave big game alone!  You are cruel to kill innocent animals for your satisfaction. Horrible. Just horrible!
@OfficialLivePD
Since I’m a California girl....you should add Sacramento or Stockton, CA on your show. Believe me, they won’t disappoint! https://t.co/FaRah7mEtK
@LakeCoILSheriff @OfficialLivePD I’m so ready!  If it’s Friday night, it’s Live PD!  #Live
@RobertIrvine Robert, I had to change the channel yesterday because the guests were yelling so much, I couldn’t understand any of them. Please quiet them down so that your show is enjoyed once again. Thanks for listening.
@MSNBC Miners know how to protect themselves. They will do anything to stay safe!
@ABC Let’s settle the Hillary issues once and for all!  Trump under spotlight. She should be as well!!  America wants to know. We deserve it!  @realDonaldTrump @HillaryClinton
@AP_Oddities @AP Sick
@FOX40 Wow!  Thanks for covering!
@CNN Just give the man a chance. If press would Butt out, positive change will be made! @realDonaldTrump
@SamsungUS You should hold a contest to win a TV. Especially around the holidays. Folks need help buying gifts for their families!  Thanks for your time...
@ABC Hope you all learned your lesson. Bad reflection on the USA. Shame on you!!
@JudgeFaithTV It is rare. People need a wake up call to really change which usually starts in their heart .... let’s hope...
@JudgeFaithTV Holy Mackerel!  You’re right, Judge Faith. A persons past is a view into their future!  Patterns don’t lie, indeed!
#AskFlex. Hello!  How does Flex get along with dogs he may encounter on a chase/hunt?

@piersmorgan Because it’s my decision to have a gun.
@benshapiro @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh you’re a disrespectful ass too!!  Wear it proud.....jerk
@T_Visc @JohnParshon @foxandfriends .... events like this, Las Vegas and too many more horrific events are senseless and those innocent lives shouldn’t have been taken... Sad!!
@T_Visc @JohnParshon @foxandfriends Ooh....yes they are...  AK’s, AR’s...Ammo. Really easy. Again, enough $$$, you own one. I’ve seen the tranaction(s).  Let’s agree.....
@JohnParshon @T_Visc @foxandfriends ...’shoot em up’, they can get an illegal gun(s) to carry out a horrific event. Bypassing the laws isn’t hard. Got $$$, buy a gun. Answered?
@JohnParshon @T_Visc @foxandfriends Hmm. I thought I answered your question. My point: Anyone can buy a gun if they pass background check. If someone wanted to ....
@ThatsMorgan4U @foxandfriends You can talk gun control until you’re blue in the face... How do you stop the people who plow into a crowd with their car?  Same sick minds
@JohnParshon @T_Visc @foxandfriends It doesn’t. Anyone can get a gun and do damage. If they’re so hell bent, you can’t stop them.
@danniaus1 @foxandfriends ...he needs to fight with his words as he could have the floor hear his words! By walking out, you hear nothing on how to fix this problem.
@danniaus1 @foxandfriends Excuse me?  I’m looking at it as though walking out on moment of silence is just plain disrespectful. If he wants to protest.....
@foxandfriends You should have taken a knee if this is truly how you feel. Putz!
@foxandfriends I’m embarrassed you represent California. Shame on you!  Show some respect!  I’ll speak for myself - he does NOT represent me for his action
