Senate Judiciary Committee votes 12-10 on party lines to advance Neomi Rao’s nomination to the D.C. Circuit. She wold fill the vacancy that was left vacant when Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court.
And @ChrisCoons shows up so it seems that showdown has been averted as well.
Another attendance issue! @SenFeinstein says no other Democrat is going to show up for votes and committee rules require two minority party members. @LindseyGrahamSC says its a mistake to "play games."
And @SenTedCruz and @SenJoniErnst say they will support Rao for the DC Circuit because she is suited to its regulatory experience, but if she were nominated to the Supreme Court it would be a different analysis.
On Rao, @HawleyMO says people inside and outside the capitol would prefer he do as instructed, not raise questions. “I’m sorry to disappoint them, but that is not what’s going to happen.”

@MichaelMcGough3 @steve_vladeck @SenWhitehouse .@SenWhitehouse might say that the blue slips were the enforcement mechanism for that outraged PA senator, when in the minority, to stop the appointment of a NJ or DE pick. @BenSasse might call that a small footnote to Dems eliminating the filibuster for judicial noms in 2013.
@MichaelMcGough3 @steve_vladeck @SenWhitehouse There is a statutory requirement: At least one circuit judge must be appointed from "the residents of each state  in that circuit." So each state gets one. https://t.co/adEty8jH5o

When @SenatorDurbin asks Rao about her writing from college in 1990s on a "myth" about AIDS, she says: "I honestly do not recall." On writing about "myth" of sexual and racial oppression, Rao says in part, "I don't recall precisely."
Noms get beat up for past writings @JohnKennedyLA says, but question should be ruling on law. "I don’t want a nominee that’s never thought about the world. I prefer to have a nominee that has an intellect above a single cell organism, that doesn’t come in here as a blank slate."
Rao again says her writings from college were “perhaps not the most elegant” but was common sense about staying sober to avoid being raped. “It’s the advice my mother gave me, it’s the advice that I give my children, and I certainly regret any implication of blaming the victim.”
Rao backed away from climate change writings, saying they were decades ago when there was a more vigorous debate. "I think the science has become much more conclusive over time," Rao said. "My understanding is that human activity does contribute to climate change."
When @JohnCornyn asks Rao about her college writings, he notes that he saw stories about the issues in "Hill rags."
Rao, responding to a question from @SenFeinstein, stops short of committing to recuse from Trump administration regulatory actions. Rao currently plays a key role in the White House's efforts to roll back regulations.
“Looking back at some of those writings and reading them, I cringe at some of the language I used,” Rao said about her 1990s writings in college. In the intervening two decades, she likes to think she has matured as a writer and thinker and as a person.

Senate Judiciary Committee debate and vote on AG nominee William Barr next Tuesday, @LindseyGrahamSC says.
On Barr, @ChrisCoons troubled he didn't clearly commit to share Mueller's report or commit to follow recommendations of DOJ ethics officials on recusal.
On blue slip policy for appeals court nominees this Congress, @LindseyGrahamSC tells Judiciary Democrats: "We'll a meeting amongst ourselves." But says he won't change blue slip policy on district court nominees, which preserves homestate senator power to influence picks.
"I think that's a good question to get answered... We'll give 'em a call," @LindseyGrahamSC responds.
Question from @SenWhitehouse: If DOJ doesn't release info on uncharged people, and Trump is uncharged because OLC opinion says a president can't be charged in office, then would info about president from the Mueller memo not be made public?
Lawyers know that "weasel words" can be meaningful, and the question of "what is consistent with the law" is "a ginormous loophole" in Barr's transparency pledge for Mueller report, says @SenWhitehouse.
Now @SenatorLeahy says he questions whether Barr would make public the Mueller report if Trump made sweeping claims of executive privilege (as Trump did with Kavanaugh documents).
"Now's a good time to take up the gang of eight bill," @LindseyGrahamSC quips to Judiciary Democrats, as all other Republicans on the committee left the meeting. "They're all gone."
And @SenFeinstein says she has concerns about how much of the Mueller report becoming public. This is the biggest issue facing out country" and the public needs to know findings without a filter.
On Barr, @SenFeinstein says she is "very concerned" about memo on Mueller probe. Says it "appears to be seminal" in his appointment and Barr's argument would give Trump authority to interfere in DOJ matters.
And there it is: Action on William Barr nomination for AG will be held over until next week. Same with judges.

That's it for today for Barr. Reconvene tomorrow at 9:30 for second panel. Written questions for record due by Jan. 21.
Attorney general nominee William Barr told senators he is open to reconsidering the Justice Department’s decision not to defend the 2010 health care law in a lawsuit brought by Texas and other Republican-led states.
Barr said he wouldn't go after companies who relied on an Obama-era memo about  states that have legalized it in some way. But he said state laws are  like a back door nullification of a federal drug law. (deleted earlier tweet with misheard statement)
@lawrencehurley I'm hoping to shout this question at him in a hallway if it doesn't get addressed at the hearing.
This is a big answer Dems were seeking. @ChrisCoons asks, would you resign if the president asked you to fire Mueller without cause?		Barr: “I would not carry out that instruction.”
Here's what I heard/saw in the first part of William Barr's confirmation hearing. https://t.co/YMHof9Isf8
The William Barr hearing is about to hit its first break and what a total difference in tone from the Sessions confirmation hearing, and particularly the Kavanaugh hearing. No protesters with outbursts. Just a lower political temperature.
@mikemacagnone Thanks, I'll be here all day.
I spy @SenAngusKing chilling in the public gallery during the William Barr confirmation hearing. https://t.co/8b5GxcqisD
Barr, in story about sending 19-page memo to DOJ on Mueller probe, says Rod Rosenstein is not a one-page guy he liked to dive in deep to a topic. @LindseyGrahamSC asks, "Don’t you think President Trump is a one-pager kind of guy?" Barr: "I suspect he is."
Chairman @LindseyGrahamSC starts his questioning of Barr by focusing on the FBI, whether it opened a counterintelligence investigation on Trump, and the infamous Page/Strzok text messages. "We're relying on you to clean this place up," Graham said.
Barr, in intro comments, changed from prepared testimony of "with Russian interference in the election" to spoken testimony of Russian "attempts" to interfere.
William Barr takes oath before testifying at his confirmation hearing to be attorney general. https://t.co/DPbOMDOtba
To start, @SenFeinstein welcomes @SenJoniErnst and @MarshaBlackburn, the first two Republican women on the Judiciary Committee.
Graham on his approach. These are difficult times but wants bipartisan efforts: "I'll be as measured as possible. The immigration Lindsey will show up. But the other guy's in there too and I don't like him any more than you do."
This committee within it has the ability to big things long overdue, Graham said. Talks about needing to “tame the Wild West” of social media and advertising.
"Happy new year, new congress and we’ll see how this goes," Graham says. He starts with a few jokes, one saying nobody will get a good picture of him, and he riffs off of Grassley's "200 year old committee" comment by saying nobody over the committee is over 100.
This will be the first Judiciary Committee hearing run by new chairman @LindseyGrahamSC. Gone will be the folksy and sometimes cantankerous Grassley, and we'll see what Graham's style is.
Barr, 68, a former attorney general, had a confirmation hearing for his first stint 27 years ago. A lot has changed since then on civil rights, criminal justice, immigration and more. Here's what he plans to tell the committee. https://t.co/hfywqAuCWF

Grassley, in call with local reporters earlier today, said he wasn't going to have negative votes on judicial nominees. "That raises the question of whether it’s even worth my calling an executive committee meeting which would be tomorrow," he said.

Scott votes to proceed to Farr's nomination after an hour or so. It's 50-50, and VP Pence breaks the tie in Farr's favor. There is still a confirmation vote to go, tomorrow or next week sometime.
Just now @JeffFlake voted no on procedural motion on Farr nomination.
Right after Trump appointed Whitaker, he told reporters there was "no rush" to name a new AG. Looks like senators haven't changed his mind. https://t.co/TjtUOz9zZt
Flake's no on Farr, along with the 49 votes of Democrats and Independents, means that if one other Republican senator opposes Farr the nomination could be withdrawn or voted down. That drama is scheduled to begin in minutes.
It's almost time for a procedural vote on Thomas Farr's nomination to the Eastern District of North Carolina, which will be Flake's first test of his pledge to vote 'no' on all judicial nominees until there is a floor vote on the Mueller bill.
Objection to @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons @CoryBooker request for a floor vote on the Mueller protection bill comes from @SenMikeLee, who cites Scalia's dissent in Morrison v. Olson. So there won't be a vote on it, at least today.

Tomorrow @JeffFlake @ChrisCoons and @CoryBooker say they will try to force a vote on the Mueller protection bill because of the president's tweets about the special counsel this morning. Flake already said he will vote against judicial nominees until a vote happens.
"No, we have to have the vote on the bill. So I’m not giving away my shot," Flake told reporters. "If it fails, that’s it. I can’t require passage. What I require is that it be brought to a vote."
.@JeffFlake says he is standing firm on voting against judges until there's a floor vote on a Mueller protection bill. Won't accept "sense of the Senate" resolution or demonstration that the bill won't pass.

"Maybe" a criminal justice bill will be part of a busy end of year schedule for the Senate, @JohnCornyn tells reporters. There's also a Yemen resolution, farm bill, judges, and deal with border security. h/t @JenniferShutt

Kobes got a "not qualified" rating from the ABA, and the Judiciary Committee advanced him to the floor in the wake of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. https://t.co/dqqbk0afle
McConnell ended up filing cloture on just two nominees: Farr and Jonathan Kobes for the 8th Circuit
It's also notable that Farr was first nominated in 2017 and the Judiciary Committee advanced him on 11-10 party line vote in January. There have been around 60 judicial confirmations since then but not Farr.
He drew the opposition of the Congressional Black Caucus and civil rights groups in part because of past work defending the NC’s congressional redistricting plans and voter ID law https://t.co/8J6coMJQXT
Farr is contentious for several reasons. He would fill a seat held open for 13 years because of politics. The district is 30 percent black and has been in existence since 1790 — but never had a black judge. Republican senators blocked two black nominees in Obama administration.
This basically sets the stage for a vote after Thanksgiving sometime.
This is one day after @JeffFlake said he would vote against all judicial nominees unless there was a floor vote on a bill to protect the Mueller special counsel probe.
Just now @senatemajldr filed procedural paperwork on one of the more contentious judicial confirmations, Thomas Farr, for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Doing the same for other judicial nominees as well.

Speaking of one senator being able to force a lengthy floor process for criminal justice bill... https://t.co/16FGNMsKp3
Hmm. @JohnCornyn on criminal justice bill: Notes "the obvious," the short period of time left and one senator can withhold consent and force a lengthy process. "I do think there are people in good faith have some differences of opinion and they deserve to be heard as well."
Grassley asks Republicans who might oppose criminal justice overhaul to consider all the work he's done for the president and Republicans... and this is an opportunity you don't get very often.
Grassley said he would work with the White House "and the sooner the better" on an attorney general nomination.
Grassley now defending acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker. Says DOJ's OLC backs up Trump's ability to pick non-confirmed person to run DOJ. Has confidence in Whitaker.
Judiciary Committee "holds over" five appeals court judges and nine district court judges, meaning a vote/showdown over Flake/Mueller protection bill will be for another day.
It appears @SenMikeLee isn't forgetting Kavanaugh hearings. "Six weeks after he was confirmed, I still can’t completely get my head around what happened." He called it "a deliberate effort to destroy a man's life."
"I’m really going to like calling Mitt Romney the junior senator from Utah," @SenMikeLee tells @FedSoc #FedSoc2018
.@SenMikeLee tells #FedSoc2018 story about a woman who put a dead dog in a suitcase to take it to the vet for disposal and she’s on the subway and a man takes off with the suitcase. “There’s definitely a corollary to what the Democrats tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh," Lee says.
This makes it seem like some GOP Sen is doing just that? https://t.co/xBR8o0TAjO
I'm going to add that it would still take another Republican "no" vote to stop judicial confirmations. If all other Rs vote for nominees (and Democrats oppose) then it would be 50-50 and Pence would break tie. He would be busy.
Coons: "I am puzzled" why leaders in Senate don't see a need to protect Mueller probe from Trump.
That came on the floor after @senatemajldr objected to a floor vote on the bill which would make removing Mueller could only be for good cause and he could challenge in federal court, among other provisions.
Now: @JeffFlake said he will not vote for 21 judges in committee or 32 judges awaiting action on the Senate floor until a bill protecting the Mueller probe gets a floor vote.

Proponents of criminal justice overhaul had been hoping for a whip count today, an announcement of support from Trump and maybe a floor vote as early as this week. Hmm.
McConnell on criminal justice: "we don’t have a whole lot of time left," first we need a proposal, then "see how it stacks up against our other priorities going in here to the end of the session."
And @senatemajldr throws a bit of doubt on a criminal justice bill coming to the floor in the lame duck. @ChuckGrassley later tells media he has 18 Republican cosponsors and expects to release something later today.
On special counsel probe, @senatemajldr: No indication the Mueller investigation won't be allowed to finish and it should finish, so no need for legislation on that.
Now @senatemajldr reaffirms judicial nominations will remain a top priority in next Congress. https://t.co/Tz2DbJ867f

"It did not change me. My approach to judging remains the same." A good judge must be an umpire and be independent, interpret constitution as written. In the wake of the confirmation process, "My approach to life also remains the same."
The Senate confirmation process is over now, #Kavanaugh said. "I take this office with gratitude, and no bitterness."

New statement from second #Kavanaugh accuser: "Only this time, instead of drunk college kids, it is US Senators who are deliberately ignoring his behavior." https://t.co/5WVut8YdVT

The @ABAesq says today it will reopen its evaluation of #Kavanaugh based on "temperament" during the Sept. 27 Juiciary Committee hearing, in a new letter. But the original rating stands because they won't finish before the scheduled Senate vote. https://t.co/C7HEl0BDgK

The sound you hear at the Capitol this morning is reporters trying to strategize about the entrance and exit routes for the floor vote and where to find Flake, Murkowski, Collins and Manchin (he's in with the FBI probe now)
And @Sen_JoeManchin is back to read FBI probe again: "I'm probably undecided until I walk through the door,"  he tells @KilloughCNN.
As @BenSasse leaves after viewing FBI background investigation, he tells me, "I'll probably issue a statement in the next few minutes." So probably not much in there that changed his mind.
As @timkaine enters secure room with FBI background investigation, he asks, why only one copy. This is his first chance to review it, there's been a traffic jam of senators who want to view it, and some won't be able to before the vote, he says.
Here's how close it is on #Kavanaugh , from the lips of @ChuckGrassley https://t.co/3UxMWJzKDV
@cristianafarias I don't think that's how they are viewing this but really there's a lot of ways it could unfold this morning.
As @RoyBlunt goes to see FBI probe, he tells reporters that he thinks today's vote will be determinitive: "I would hope people are ready to make a decision and deal with whatever that decision is." The Republican said he is not undecided.
We still haven't heard from Flake, Murkowski or Collins about whether they think this limited, one-week supplemental probe satisfied their desire to further vet #Kavanaugh allegations.
The vote is set for 10:30, but that hasn't meant much in the #Kavanaugh confirmation process. The committee vote was set several times, last Friday it was set for 1:30, which came and went, as Flake brokered a deal for additional FBI probe.
Here's what the next two hours holds: Announcements from four key undecided senators (Flake, Murkowski, Collins, Manchin). Possible surprises from others. And a historic vote that could set the stage for #Kavanaugh becoming the next justice, or maybe force Trump to pick again.
It's a quieter morning outside the basement room today where the Senate's only copy of the #Kavanaugh supplemental FBI background investigation is kept. @SenAlexander just went in. T-minus 2 hours until a key procedural vote. https://t.co/1fDNRJNixB

@CTrappe I think the overriding consideration for the middle of the night action was getting the report over to the Senate as soon as the FBI got it to them, so the senators could start viewing this morning.

And @BenSasse, who hasn't spoken yet and passed a chance to do so, is sitting on the Democratic side of the dais and talking with @SenWhitehouse
1:30 has arrived and no #Kavanaugh vote. Some senators huddling in the anteroom, others in the hearing room chatting or sitting quietly. @JeffFlake and @ChrisCoons and @maziehirono in the anteroom.
Confirmation of trouble for #Kavanaugh committee vote. @SenWhitehouse tells @ChuckGrassley that "Given what's happening in the anteroom" there would be an agreement to push the vote past 1:30. @JeffFlake, who announced he would back Kavanaugh earlier, is in there.
@SenatorLeahy on #Kavanaugh: “In some ways it feels like Alice in Wonderland around here” and this will be seen as a turning point in the Senate. “We are an arm and a very weak arm on the Trump White House. Every semblance of independence is gone.”
Democratic senators @SenWhitehouse, @SenBlumenthal, @maziehirono and @KamalaHarris walked out of the meeting during Grassley’s opening statement.
@SenatorLeahy voted: “No, because it violates the customs of this committee.” @maziehirono voted: “I strongly object, this is just totally ridiculous. What a railroad job. My answer is no, no.”
Committee will vote at 1:30 p.m. after a motion from @ChuckGrassley. That passed 11-8 with Republicans voting. And @CoryBooker and @KamalaHarris not voting in protest.

@jadler1969 @lawrencehurley As far as I know, the committee reached out to Ford's lawyers to first do a staff interview and get transcripts etc. and this letter is the first response they got.
@jostonjustice I mean, to be fair, that's also what Ford's letter proposes as well... although hers is even less likely because the DOJ/White House already said FBI probe isn't happening.

And @ChuckGrassley describes the tone he seeks at the hearing. "I'd like to see 21 members of our committee listen patiently to both of our witnesses and kinda act like a jury." And then consider that with all the other evidence.
Grassley also wouldn't rule out the possibility that the committee would have an outside counsel asking questions. And he talked about age of allegation: "I'd hate to have somebody ask me what I did 35 years ago."
Grassley on Ford not yet accepting invitation to testify Monday: "I would surely hope she'd come Monday. She's surely prepared. She hired a lawyer, I understand, back in August."
And @ChuckGrassley tells @hughhewitt that he can't say now when there would be a committee vote. "We're going to take this step by step."
Grassley on Ford possibly agreeing to testify but only at a later time: "She wants to talk to us, she told us she wants to talk to us, and you would think the sooner the better."
On #Kavanaugh hearing, @ChuckGrassley tells it will be televised and there will only be two witnesses but Ford hasn't responded. Committee hasn't worked out who would go first but he assumes Ford would.

Hatch said this is a serious charge and the committee needs to have hearings as soon as this week. “I would hope so, we should get this cleared up as soon as possible."

A mysterious #Kavanaugh letter appears, but not public, per @theintercept https://t.co/ZEpi2XbZBP
Now Coons motion on subpoena for National Archives records about #Kavanaugh views on presidential powers.
Durbin motion is for subpoena for documents at National Archives related to Kavanaugh and his advice on Bush era torture policies.
Durbin makes a motion: Three specific incidents that documents show #Kavanaugh statements about not being involved in torture is true. What is it worth to take an oath if they tell us things that aren't true. Credibility at issue.
Blumenthal makes a motion: Subpoena the following individuals for interviews and testimony. Manny Miranda, Don Willett (!), and others. Says it is vital to resolve key questions of fact raised in the hearing and by public documents.
Hirono makes a motion: Issue subpoena for records during time #Kavanaugh was WH staff secretary on native Hawaii and Alaska peoples. We found one document related to that, I would like to know what else might be in those documents.
Controversial Supreme Court nominations go back to "the borking of Bork and the crucifying of Thomas," @ChuckGrassley says.
Durbin: "We are a whisper, a shell, of what this committee used to be." In an apparent hurry to confirm. Calls it irresponsible to set a time certain for a committee vote on #Kavanaugh.
Durbin: What we have witnessed here today in Senate Judiciary is breakdown in bipartisan efforts, and puts this in context of other actions from Republicans. One member of minority had to vote in favor for a vote to happen, now that's eliminated.
Republicans on Judiciary Committee, 11-10, vote down motion from Klobuchar and Whitehouse for subpoena on more information on #Kavanaugh documents withheld by Trump administration
Whitehouse: Subpoena of executive privilege documents is the only way to answer the fundamental question of if there has been a valid assertion of executive privilege.
Republicans on the committee voted to hold the #Kavanaugh committee vote at 1:45 pm on Sept. 20. 11-10 party line vote, with Leahy voting "No, because I follow the rules."
Now Sens. Whitehouse and Klobuchar are making motion for subpoena for records withheld by Trump administration. Want a reason why they were withheld. We want to see those documents before we vote.
Sen. Hatch didn't break any rules in 2003 when he did it, he set a  precedent. Durbin says a member of minority has to vote to allow a such a  vote. No we don't, Grassley said, and we checked with the Senate parliamentarian.
Leahy to Grassley: You're saying you're going to set a time, you could get the floor and talk right up to that time and no one else. "Right now you're setting a procedure that could easily block members of this committee from being able to speak."
Grassley now follows through on threat to set specific time for Kavanaugh hearing at 1:45 pm on Sept. 20. Leahy says that would be rigging so only one person could debate it up until that time. That has never been done, Leahy said.
Feinstein: The minority and public should be able to see the documents. It honestly makes me wonder. what in Judge Kavanaugh's records are Republicans hiding?
Feinstein now makes motion for subpoena for National Archives records for #Kavanaugh work as White House staff secretary in GWB administration.
Blumenthal: I recognize the reality. The chair has the gavel.... I'm here under protest. My motion should have been the first order of business. The chair preempted that right on a committee member.
Feinstein supports a delay: "I think taking the time and really being able to make the assessments that are needing to be made are really critical and important." But it doesn't really appear to be an option for Grassley.
We're getting parliamentarian in here now. It's pretty clear Grassley as chairman says that he got #Kavanaugh held over and is not interested and was "putting people on notice" he would offer motion to hold vote at a time certain.
Blumenthal says the point of his motion to adjourn was to get a vote before Grassley held over the committee. But now that Grassley says he has done just that, there's no need to adjourn.
Grassley: I had the floor, there was a quorum present, and I as one member of this committee held over Kavanaugh's nomination. I have that right.
Grassley says vote will be Sept. 20 at 1:45 p.m. Don't need to make such a motion but hey everyone's on notice now, he said.
Blumenthal: I believe that this nomination is going to be tainted, it will be stained, by a badly broken process that has shattered the norms and shattered the norms of this committee."
"I had the floor, I did what any one member of this committee can do." Which is to hold over #Kavanaugh hearing for a week, setting up Sept. 20 committee vote. "And I'm ready to recognize Blumenthal."
Grassley starts the hearing by saying the committee holds over the #Kavanaugh hearing. Sen. Blumenthal makes an immediate motion to adjourn and contests it. Grassley says the action was already done.
There also aren't a lot of seats for the public. Maybe a dozen at most? So chances of yelling protesters seem lower.
There are only six press seats every week at the Judiciary Committee. Let's just say there are more reporters than that today. Media are just deciding to sit in seats reserved for staff so ... We'll see what happens. https://t.co/SNaI0KCz2j

If they stop, they are not scheduled to have rounds of questions from senators Friday, per a committee spokesman. It is supposed to be a day of outside witnesses.

We're an hour into the #KavanaughConfirmationHearing and we really haven't gotten started. "At some point are we going to hear from the nominee," Sen. Kennedy asks. Grassley asks how long it would go: "Do you want this to go on all day?"
Blumenthal breaks out Rule 4... saying Grassley cannot override it by fiat. Grassley says that only works in executive session, and this isn't executive session.
There are two Republicans missing from the hearing--Crapo and Graham--so Republicans might not have the votes to defeat a motion to adjourn...
Grassley: "This is something I’ve never gone through before in 15 Supreme Court nominations."
Grassley says motions for vote to adjourn are out of order. Blumenthal now says that if there is not a vote, "this process will be tainted and stained, forever." Booker asks to go to executive session. Grassley says that's out of order. Blumenthal says, no it's not.
It's impossible in the room to continue to hear the senators when the protesters yell. It's loud, and it's disrupting the senators. But I can't hear, that's how loud it is.
Grassley responds: Effort of minority to continue to obstruct and I don’t think that’s fair to our judge I don’t think that’s fair to our constitutional process.

So very @ChrisCoons on Kennedy retirement: "I suspect we will have a battle royale over this nomination, and it is my hope we can conduct that in a respectful and appropriate way."
Now @CoryBooker proposes the Senate Judiciary Committee should not consider a nominee from Trump until Special Counsel Mueller's investigation is complete. He said it is a conflict of interest for Trump to appoint someone who could decide issues in Mueller probe.
On Kennedy, @amyklobuchar: “I hope when the president looks at this appointment—the tea leaves from my perspective don’t look good on this front, but—I hope he’s looking at someone" who sparks independence and is a consensus builder.
Feinstein: "Protecting a woman’s right to control her own body has been a priority for me since I got elected to the Senate." Kennedy successor could threaten access.
@jpscasteras @SenBooker Yeah
Feinstein: Republicans set a new standard with Merrick Garland block during an election year, and he was "left to dangle in Senate uncertainty." Grassley/Republicans have already said their standard was for PRESIDENTIAL election year.
(Tweeter's note: That doesn't seem likely to happen.)
On Kennedy @SenFeinstein asks Trump to identify a strong consensus nominee who will not divide the country. Reach across the aisle. Maybe wait until after the election?
Here's where @SenBooker is https://t.co/gCqHJWeZcj

As expected, the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced on an 11-10 party line vote the nomination of Ryan Bounds for the 9th Circuit over the objections of both home-state senators from Oregon.
What decade is it? @SenFeinstein on a judicial nominee: "Mr. Barker represented Texas in multiple amicus briefs before supporting President TRUMAN’s Muslim ban."
Here's the story behind the controversy over Bounds for the 9th Circuit and the "blue slip" tradition. (And maybe I'll go the rest of the year without a typo in a tweet.) https://t.co/E2VRsJv5VU

The opposite of a narrow ruling is broad or sweeping. If you want to describe the vote outcome as narrow (as in a narrow victory, I suppose?), then the opposite is unanimous.
SCOTUS majority in a case can be 5-4, 7-2, 9-0, whatever. Okay, that's done. Now, what did that majority decide? The same outcome can be narrow (applies to that one case only) or sweeping (applies to all cases of that type).

But SCOTUS avoided weighing in on the sanctions issue. So there's really not much done here in the end, but the justices said the moot case didn't mean they shouldn't vacate the ruling.
The case was already moot because the procedure was done, but the Trump administration had accused the ACLU lawyers of misleading the government on timing of the procedure.
The Supreme Court vacated a lower court ruling Monday in an unusual appeal in the case of a 17-year-old unaccompanied immigrant in federal custody who got an abortion.

Then @SenatorLeahy mentioned President Trump wanting to lift restrictions on ZTE to save Chinese jobs after funds went to Trump branded property, "But that's probably just a coincidence."
Wray tells @SenatorLeahy that FBI still has deep concerns about ZTE, calls it a company beholden to a foreign government that can steal information, conduct undetected espionage, exert pressure or control.

Votes against were all Republicans: Hatch, Cornyn, Lee, Cruz, Sasse, Crapo, Kennedy. Concerns were about the constitutionality of a bill that infringes on executive branch's authority over prosecution.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 14-7 to advance an amended bill (S 2644) to give Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III protections if he is fired. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the measure won’t make it to the floor.
Why @JohnCornyn won't vote for Mueller protection bill, in short: This bill will not be taken up on the Senate floor. The House will not pass it. The president will not sign it, nor should he.
The Judiciary Committee votes 6-15 to defeat an amendment offered by Lee that would gut the Mueller protection bill. Final vote on full bill is coming up.
Sounds like there is a manager's amendment on the Special Counsel Mueller protection bill that will get a majority vote at committee. Majority Leader McConnell has said it won't get on the floor.

Update from SCOTUS on Justice Sotomayor's shoulder: It's worse than first thought. https://t.co/39vqfLlyAI
Feinstein: Wants McConnell to reconsider, and if Judiciary Committee passes Mueller protection bill, "at the very least, it’s ready, and it could go at any time on the floor."
Obviously the views of the Majority Leader are important, Grassley says. But if the committee didn't pass bills that wouldn't see the floor, then "we probably wouldn’t be moving any bills out of this committee."
Grassley says he put bill on agenda because he said he would if there was a bipartisan bill, "just in case anybody in the leadership of the RP of the U.S. Senate or even on this committee" wonders.
And there's some hurdles for any bill, as I mentioned the other day. https://t.co/o48tFYMeaA
A committee vote almost certainly won't happen today, as @seungminkim points out. But likely they will discuss what to do next.

And @SenJohnKennedy is also a 'no' on criminal justice overhaul bill. Says similar effort in Louisiana has been "an unqualified disaster" and he can't in good conscious vote for it on the federal level. Grassley says he's disappointed.
John Cornyn announces he will vote 'no' on criminal justice overhaul bill, because it contains provisions on sentencing that are opposed by some senators and the White House. Says he wants to do prison reform only.
AG Sessions on #ParklandShooting: "We must confront this problem." https://t.co/SCrh5HHgvT
More @SenFeinstein: "This isn’t going to stop, members, it’s going to continue, and we become culpable when we do nothing to stop it."
On #ParklandShooting: @SenFeinstein says she "feels a kind of anger today."I ask today: Why are we once again sitting around this table. Why don’t we pass some legislation. I don’t think we can continue to wait."
Considering he knows how hard the compromise bill was, considering how controversial Sessions and other DOJ nominees are, and considering "the president was going to fire him last spring and I went to his defense."
So @ChuckGrassley rips Attorney General Jeff Sessions for sending a letter opposing the sentencing and prison overhaul bill that is being marked up today.
Grassley diverted from that prepared statement to add that the seat is now held by a Democrat.
Zing from @ChuckGrassley: If AG Sessions "wanted to be involved in marking up this legislation, maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama."
Here's @ChuckGrassley on #ParklandShooting: "Senseless and cowardly." Says there is one common denominator in a lot of these shootings, other than guns, and that is mental illness.
Bottom line: What the Judiciary Committee does this morning will be a major signal about whether criminal justice overhaul efforts will stall again this year.
And that didn't happen last session. Now @JohnCornyn says this compromise bill has the same concerns, and the White House has said it will back prison reform.
But Grassley's compromise version, despite backers saying it has a super majority support, would have to get Majority Leader @SenateMajLdr blessing to get to the floor.
Grassley was not happy about that. And when he gets his back up, he can be stubborn in his positions. https://t.co/kMBWdMroVi
Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to the committee yesterday outlining the Trump administration's concerns with the sentencing portion of the bill. https://t.co/eS5bwUEyt4
But @JohnCornyn and other Republicans think the Senate should move only one part of that compromise bill, the part about prison reform. They have introduced amendments to do just that. https://t.co/msl8zwGzJF
Republicans are split on how to proceed. Chairman @ChuckGrassley says the bipartisan compromise, which he worked hard on, is the way to go. It has sentencing changes and prison changes.

The upshot: Even though Trump backed changes to federal prisons to stop recidivism, criminal justice reform has some hurdles just to get to the Senate floor.
Cornyn says backers of sentencing changes could amend the prison bill when it's on the floor; but Grassley says those who blocked the bill before would block it again if they thought such an amendment would pass.
But @ChuckGrassley and @DickDurbin want to move the whole thing, including the sentencing section of the bill causing the hold up
Today @JohnCornyn told committee members that the compromise bill is "stuck" and it would be better to move his prison section of the bill. Trump has backed that part of the bill.
The Judiciary Committee advanced a version of the bill last session and said they had the votes to pass it. But @SenateMajLdr never brought it to the floor. Some law enforcement groups opposed, so did some Republican senators.

Justice Alito denied the request from Republican state lawmakers on his own, without forwarding to full Supreme Court. Could boost Democrats in the state, since the state court found the old map favored Republicans.

@AmesCG The back end without the front end, basically.
If this is the case, the question could become whether Democrats want to pass the reentry bill to get some overhaul or demand the sentencing changes as well.
So it sounds like Trump is less interested in the compromise bill and more interested in the Cornyn/Lee/Whitehouse reentry bill (S 1994) and less in comprehensive bill (S 1917).
The bipartisan Senate bill compromise combines two major parts: reducing mandatory minimums for certain drug crimes (which some Republicans oppose), and helping prisoners reenter society (Cornyn is pushing this).
Trump's comments on criminal justice here combine "tough on crime" with "a ladder of opportunity" for former prisoners reentering society. That sounds like trouble for big Senate overhaul bill. https://t.co/XfOrwdrjXi

This conditional settlement pretty much tries to wipe out this case in terms of meaning anything when it comes to Congress' standing to sue the president in future cases.
A federal judge concluded that they did have standing. The Obama administration didn't like that and appealed. The outcome was potentially big for Congress' ability to litigate disputes with the President.
When the House sued the Executive Branch in 2014 over appropriations spending in Obamacare, a big question was whether they had the legal standing to file the lawsuit.
The House has reached a conditional settlement with states that intervened in the lawsuit about Obamacare subsidy payments. Includes statements about the House standing to sue the executive branch in the future. https://t.co/O3SomFiUVq

Here’s @SenFeinstein on Grassley blue slip decision: part of “undermining the independence of the federal judiciary.” https://t.co/0yK4ykYGHw
How many voters care about the blue slip for judicial nominees? I’m guessing not many comments at Grassley’s next Iowa town hall.
@ChuckGrassley During the Obama administration, @SenateGOP blocked 18 judicial nominees through blue slips, including six circuit court nominees, says @civilrightsorg https://t.co/4JHIxzNbcO
@ChuckGrassley Blue slip move seems to mean that if White House just documents efforts to consult with a home state senator, then they can feel free to ignore and pick whoever they want.
@ChuckGrassley Well, that's it. Whatever the history of blue slip, it's fair to say Grassley's move means each senator lost a lot of power over who gets appointed to appeals courts from their state.
@ChuckGrassley McConnell now on floor saying Grassley laid out a "sensible" way to do blue slip courtesy. He had called for this change.
@ChuckGrassley Grassley: Blue slips safe with him as chairman but "maybe if it's abused someday it may go away and then all you're going to have when it's said and done is consent."
@ChuckGrassley With blue slip move, @ChuckGrassley also will hear howls from Democrats about another hearing Nov. 29 with two appeals court nominees, which dilutes time for questioning each one.
@ChuckGrassley With this move, Grassley makes himself judge/jury/executioner of whether White House adequately consulted with home state senators about judicial nominees.
@ChuckGrassley Grassley: "I am satisfied that the White House adequately tried to consult with both home state senators" in Minnesota.
@ChuckGrassley Grassley said he looked into the records of consultation with White House and Franken, and they "repeatedly" tried to discuss with Franken.
@ChuckGrassley Now's an interesting moment for Grassley to take on Sen. Franken's withholding of the blue slip, on the day he's busy dealing with bigger problems.
@ChuckGrassley (I'm watching Grassley laud Stras online while watching in person as Stras lead a panel at #FedSoc2017 about crime rates.)
@ChuckGrassley Blue slip serves the important purpose of consultation from White House to senators. (Sen. Franken, who withheld blue slip for Stras, said he wasn't consulted.)
@ChuckGrassley Grassley says Democrats expect to use blue slip policy in place of filibuster, which they ended in 2013. "It's clear from the history of the blue slip that's not what the blue slip was meant for."
@ChuckGrassley Grassley say he's less likely to proceed on a district court nominee who doesn't have two positive blue slips from senators. But circuit courts span several states.
@ChuckGrassley Grassley says he will maintain the blue slip policy, but it doesn't allow "veto power" over a homestate nominee. Only 2 Judiciary Committee chairmen allowed that.
@ChuckGrassley The long-awaited decision from @chuckgrassley means Democrats lose one more procedural way to slow down Trump's judicial nominees.
So @ChuckGrassley on the Senate floor announces he will hold hearings for appeals court nominees who haven't received blue slip, David Stras and Kyle Duncan.
Former AG Michael Mukasey apparently not a fan of criminal justice overhaul bill that would reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders: “I suggest that’s an oxymoron.”

@JeffFlake Typical understated @SenateMajLdr on shooting keeping Sen. Paul from introducing KY judicial nominee: "He had a rather eventful morning."
@JeffFlake Feinstein: Shooting news is "unbelievable." "If there’s a partisan nature of this, we are all Democrats and we are all Republicans."
@JeffFlake Grassley: Paul was supposed to intro judicial nominee but can't make it. Heard on news he was at GOP baseball practice shooting.
