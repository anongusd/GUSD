-Gardner only won in a Red Wave year, almost surely be voted out	-GA will only be Lean if Abrahams runs.	-Jones is in the same boat as Gardner.	-If the MT Gov runs it will be close.	-Don't think NH and MI will be tilts or tossups.	-MN is a pretty reliable blue state by now.
-KS is likely with no incumbent, could show some blue tendencies after 2018.	-Same for TN.	-Lindsey Graham is unpopular along with high minority turnout makes it closer.	-TX will move up to likely if a Beto like candidate doesn't run.

@JGRMeister_Bro Well its a hearing not a trial, no one's officially deciding if he's guilty or not, and if we look back at the Justice Thomas hearings, we can see that we still have a problem in our country people getting away with sexual assault simply because of their affiliation.
In the time I've been able to comprehend what's going on around me I have never seen such a flurry of anger, bitterness, and resentment from a man who is supposed to be calm and vote on how we live our lives with a clear state of mind. He needs to be stopped. #KavanaughHearings
