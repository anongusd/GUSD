Usage
-----

**-> Pathways and Preprocessing :**

Both the original data and the processed data are available in the folders named "Datasets" and "Processed," respectively. Processed files can be rebuilt via the Preprocessing notebook or directly used.

**-> Models :**

All three baseline models tested are made available with their original code (where possible). Their original repositories are as follows :

https://github.com/jinningli/InfoVGAE
https://github.com/NasLabBgu/STEM
https://github.com/elaaf/stance-detect

All model notebooks contain a section entitled "Run Tests" or similar, where the selection of data to load in can be made, as well as various hyperparameters for the model. These are all commented with the options and their meanings for clarity.
