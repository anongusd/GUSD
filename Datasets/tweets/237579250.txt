In particular, individuals and families who were forced to remain on the healthcare exchange when the Legislature repealed and replaced Prop 3 may find this increased cost impossible to afford and may go uninsured.		#utpol #utleg
We are also concerned about the newly proposed tax on health ins premiums which could drive up costs of healthcare for some families and could disproportionately impact low-income households...
However, we don‚Äôt believe this tax reform should be revenue neutral. As legislators have noted, a revenue-neutral bill is a political consideration, not an economic one. Given the crisis our schools are facing with education funding, the income tax cut seems excessive...
@GovHerbert Overall, this is a good bill. We appreciate the efforts the #utleg is making to spread the sales tax out evenly and fairly. Sustainable revenue sources are imperative to the healthy future of our state.
@GovHerbert We hope they will reconsider the tax on healthcare premiums and the income tax cut in order to ensure Utahns can access healthcare and that our children are receiving quality education.
Our statement on the tax reform bill:		Taxes create essential revenue for programs and services we all use, strengthening our communities. Tax restructuring is never easy, but we appreciate the efforts of @GovHerbert &amp; the #utleg for taking this on...		#utpol
Thank you @RepBriscoe for speaking up about the income tax! 		We would happily continue to pay our current income tax rate in order to give Utah more revenue for our wonderful schools and teachers! #utpol #utleg
There's no requirement that tax reform bills be revenue neutral. 		There are wonderful projects that could be funded if the sales tax rate wasn't cut so low. Or we could have more money for education if the income tax stayed the same (or wasn't cut quite so much.) #utpol #utleg
Our tax reform take: 		Overall, a good bill. We appreciate the efforts the #utleg is making to spread the sales tax out evenly and fairly. We need sustainable revenue for a healthy future for Utah!		We think it could be even better if we left more $ for education. #utpol #utleg
To clarify: Income taxes can only fund education, but the general fund can go toward anything, including K-12 and higher ed. 		(Income taxes used to only go to K-12, but Utah added in higher ed in 1996.) #utpol #utleg
Quinn says he's been asked my many, why not just leave the income tax where it is, to make sure there's more money for education? 		He says the income tax cut is necessary to make the overall tax reform revenue neutral. #utpol #utleg
Quinn says the reform will result in higher ed being funded through the general fund, instead of siphoning of $ from K-12 education. 		Utah's Constitution dictates that education is funded through the income tax. #utpol #utleg

@TheaAHolcomb Worse than the original, but better than sub 2, which was released last night. 		Looks like it keeps the no-enforcement parts of Sub 2, but broadens the definition of conversion therapy in Sub 2, which restricted it only to therapy w physical effects.
The original includes therapy seeking to "change, eliminate, or reduce behaviors, expressions, attractions, or feelings" related to sexual orientation or gender identity.		The sub limits to therapy that convinces someone a change in sexual orientation is likely. #utleg #utleg

@JayEvensen @DeseretNews "It‚Äôs impossible to know exactly what voters were trying to say when they approved Medicaid expansion, but it wouldn‚Äôt be a stretch to say they wanted care for the poor to rise among lawmakers‚Äô funding priorities."
@JayEvensen @DeseretNews "Lawmakers plowed ahead with a watered-down version of Proposition 3, which passed Monday. Voters were sent careening and spiraling off the road."

RT @katieomatheson: My op-ed in @UtahPolicy re: #SB96. ‚ÄúOnce the decision to tamper with Prop 3 has been made, it seems there are no shades‚Ä¶
We are pleased with the decision to hold this legislation with the intent to have a task force study the issue further. We hope this will lead to a more thorough examination into the pros and cons of governance structures that is simply not possible during the 45-day session.
Direct elections are the best way to hold public officials accountable. ‚ÄúRather than increasing accountability, this proposal would have done the opposite. Those running for governor do so on a platform built from many issues, not just education governance. #uted #utpol #utleg
Thank you to Rep. Ballard and the House Education Committee for holding this resolution in order to have a task force study education governance models in more depth. #uted #utpol #utleg https://t.co/MbpJajfRVT
Most voters have no idea who their representative is. Does that mean they need to be appointed by the Governor to hold them accountable? #utpol #utleg
So, do we want the state school board members who are making the policies to be held directly accountable? Or would we rather add the Governor in there as a middle man so that no one is actually held accountable? #utpol #utleg
Ahhh‚Ä¶so the former board member currently testifying has a bone to pick with the UEA, which didn‚Äôt endorse her election to the board, so she wants elections completely taken out of the equation #utpol #utleg
Which means‚Ä¶?		All state school board members would be of similar ideology, aka conservative GOP members based on the current trend in which party normally wins gubernatorial elections in Utah. #utpol #utleg
Sponsor of the bill says the School Board would still be accountable to voters. But that accountability would be expressed through election of the Governor, rather than direct election #utpol #utleg
In fact, our sister organization, the ABU Education Fund, was part of a lawsuit over a recent change trying to make elections partisan. We won in court, although we‚Äôre waiting for a final ruling from the Utah Supreme Court. #utpol #utleg
Does this sound familiar? It should ‚Äî there‚Äôs usually a proposal to change the structure of the State Board every legislative session #utpol #utleg
In the House Education Committee, lawmakers are hearing presentation on a bill that would get rid of elections for the State Board of Education. Instead, board members would be appointed by the Governor, with the consent of the Senate #utpol #utleg

3 Republicans joined the Dems in voting no: Hall, Hutchings, and Eliason. #utpol #utleg
Since more than 2/3 of the House voted in favor of SB 96, this bill will NOT be subject to a veto or a referendum. But if the feds grant a 90/10 waiver, there will likely be legal challenges. #utpol #utleg
SB 96 passes, 56-19. Members of the gallery drop banners, chant "Shame!" and "Respect our votes!" Are kicked out the gallery. #utpol #utleg
Dunnigan they talked with CMS 3 days ago, who said they were on track to get a 90/10 waiver. Said CMS is working on a simplified wavier to roll out nationwide. #utpol #utleg

@RepBrianKing says other states have been granted waivers with work requirements, but haven't been granted waivers for enrollment caps. 		Says HB 210 costs half as much as the bill they're currently trying to pass. #utpol #utleg
@RepBrianKing asks about the work requirements. 		Dunnigan says the bill earlier used TANF work requirements, now uses SNAP. "It's a much lower bar," only covers able-bodied adults who are not in school. #utpol #utleg
Rep. Waldrip says his district largely voted for Prop 3. Says with Rep. Ward's backdrop, he's comfortable with the bill. #utleg #utpol
Rep. Winder says he's pleased with the new iteration of the bill, although he voted against earlier versions that lacked the fallback. #utpol #utleg
@RepBriscoe says Utah had a presidential election-level turnout in 2018. Calls HB 210 an simple solution a la Occam's Razor, while the SB 96 is a "Rube Goldberg contraption." #utpol #utleg
Honestly, we would love if every member of the #utleg had to live for a year on an income that made it difficult for them to "swing" a healthcare plan on the marketplace. We'd probably get much better public policy as a result. #utpol

Dunnigan: Individual marketplace plans cost $21 for an individual, or $60 for a family. Says the platinum plans are what "most of us would like to be on," gives great coverage. 		#utpol #utleg
Bill to revert to HB 210 fails, with a few Rs joining the Dems: Reps. Hall, @erickhutchings, Judkins, and Winder. 		We're guessing that's what the final vote count on SB 96 will look like, as well. #utpol #utleg
@jenforutah says that HB 210 addresses also those fiscal concern. Says $30 million is not a budget-buster-- Operation Rio Grande cost $65 million, and was only 1% of the Soc Svcs budget. "I disagree that this plan is more costly, I believe it is cost-efficient." #utpol #utleg
Rep. Brammer pushes back on Poulson's comments. Says CO spent over a billion over estimated budget.  #utpol #utleg

Poulson says this is the third time the state has tried partial Medicaid expansion through waivers. Says he's glad there's a stopgap, because the feds aren't likely to grant a waiver for 100% expansion. #utpol #utleg
Rep. Poulson addresses arguments about the gap between 100-138% of FPL. Cites studies showing enrollment on the public exchange declines each year because it's too costly for enrollees, and is more costly overall. #utpol #utleg
Rep. Poulson addressing intent of voters: "The first thing we need to remember is that they voted for us." 		Cheers from the gallery; Speaker Wilson threatens to clear the gallery. 	That would be a great look for the #utleg as the House undoes the people's vote... #utpol
Rep. Pouson: "The first thing we need to address is the elephant in the room, that we are not respecting the will of the voters." Also supports substitute replacing SB 96 with HB 210. 	#utpol #utleg
@jenforutah speaks in favor of the substitute, says her district supports HB 210. "If for no other reason, vote for this sub so I can spend the next year explaining to my constituents why I voted for SB 96." #utpol #utleg
If we expand Medicaid, no one will be forced to give up their marketplace insurance plan. For a state leg as obsessed with personal choice as this one is, you'd think it wouldn't be a problem to give people options as to what works better for them. #utpol #utleg #UtahDecided
Rep. Ward says he's glad that now there's a backup plan to Medicaid coverage. Says there are pros and cons to marketplace plans vs Medicaid plans. "Both of these systems work pretty well, and they both work way, way better than no coverage at all." #utpol #utleg
The problem with marketplace plans is that, while we're glad they exist, many people are too poor to afford them. They have high deductibles. They limit the amount of care people can get. Medicaid is a way better option for individuals. #utpol #utleg
Dunnigan gives reasons for stopping at 100% of FPL:		41K Utahns already have "excellent coverage through the federal marketplace, with fed gov't paying 100% of the cost. Says marketplace plans save state $$ and give ppl "better access to medical providers." #utpol #utleg
But: When adults are able to enroll in Medicaid, they are more likely to enroll their kids in programs as well. What we call "woodwork" is actually just kids getting healthcare. #utpol #utleg
Dunnigan: Coverage gap is 1/3 low-income parents and 2/3 childless adults. Says "not one more child" would be eligible for coverage through Medicaid expansion, bc already covered through CHIP. #upol #utleg
Dunnigan: Sub adds in some of the tweaks originally proposed in HB 210-- like eliminating the automatic cost-of-living pay increases for providers. #utpol #utleg
SB 96 has some new changes: 	If the 90/10 wavier isn't approved by Jan 2020, the coverage bumps up to 138% of the FPL. 	And if THAT doesn't work by July 2020, Rep. Ward's HB 210 kicks in as a backup plan (with some fiscal changes) #utpol #utleg

Herriman man: "Speak with the people that will be affected... not just those who will profit." @danmccay asks if he thinks Herriman complies. Man says it likely does, but concerned this bill will open door to negative consequences. #utpol
Two commenters express concern about the bill. One man from Herriman says that while he supports affordable housing, but is concerned this bill is a favor to developers and special interests. Supports balanced growth, opposes tying this plan to tax funds. #utpol #utleg

Meanwhile, the bridge plan will cover 100% of the FPL with a 70/30 split. Unsurprisingly, there might not be enough money. So state is offering to add $30 million to the sales tax to avoid enrollment caps for the bridge plan. #utpol
Christensen says they bill will eventually include an enrollment cap with the 90/10 match, when the money from the sales tax runs out. #utpol
Christensen: "Many of you have been misled or lied to on this bill. When we get a waiver in the future, and we are told we will, we're told we can expect to get a 90/10 match before the end of this year, maybe in a couple of months." #utpol #utleg
Committee approves a motion for a substitute that Christensen says adds a bridge plan for the effective date of April 1, 2019.

Resolutions: 	1. Create a management plan 	2. Approve a hire legislative-retained coordinator in DC to help coordinate agencies and federal reps. 		Hinkins, Stratton, @derekkitchen , Albrecht, Ivory, and Snider vote yes, @RepBriscoe votes no.
Stillll discussing a state management plan for federal lands in Utah. What would such a plan accomplish? Short term, nothing. The state does not manage federal lands, and the federal government isn't required to consult local opinion on what should be done with them. #utpol
@CWCUtah says their approach is local control. Sens. say that if you want to have local control, you need to have a plan prepared in advance. CWC says this proposed legislation is different than what happened in Washington County
Still discussing jurisdictional issues-- Utah wants to prepare its own resource management plan to give input to the federal process. The Central Wasatch Commission says determining a management plan needs to involve big-tent community input. #utpol

Border security is important. 		We don't need a steel wall to secure our borders.
Trump just encouraged all of America to move into gated communities
Not the only solution. The House and Senate could pass a sensible funding bill, like the one already passed in the Senate, and then override any veto.
Border patrol agents didn't request the wall funding. Trump demanded it, saying it would be paid by Mexico. Then he brought agents up to the White House to copy the request.
Democrats didn't request the "artistically designed steel slat" wall. Trump just changed his mind
Wow -- we're finally hearing other suggestions about border security.
Most of the 300 people per day approaching the border and encountered by border patrol are seeking asylum, which is a right provided under international and national law. It's not illegal immigration.

Hughes says med. marijuana isn't nearly as lucrative as recreational marijuana, addresses fears of "Big Marijuana" coming to the state. 		It's a fun role-reversal to see state leaders afraid of business coming to Utah. But don't worry! It prob won't happen #utleg #utpol #Prop2
@BenWinslow Agreed. It will remain inherently sticky, as long as marijuana remains a Sched. I substance.
New draft still only allows doctors to recommend medical marijuana. Hughes says this is just about the proper role of RNs and PAs, part of a larger legislative debate. Both psychiatrists and Ph.D psychologists can diagnose PTSD. #utleg #utpol #Prop2
A note on tribes: As sovereign nations, tribes are bound by federal law but not state law. No federal law governs medical marijuana, so tribes could also grow &amp; distribute it how they see fit. This draft opens a door to a compact between the state &amp; tribes.
Other changes: Physicians recommending medical cannabis to a minor has to be approved by the Compassionate Use Board. (Earlier draft required a second opinion on all recommendations.) Also gets rid of the requirement that patients have to pay for a criminal background check.
New draft gets rid of anti-discrimination protection for renters, allows for 2-5 additional cannabis pharmacies (increase from last draft, which allowed 5), and addresses tribes' ability to create their own medical cannabis frameworks.

@SenMikeLee Individuals, activists, and organizations across our state and the nation will continue to speak up. We will continue to advocate. And we will continue to protest. But just because our democracy can get loud and messy doesn't mean it will erupt in violence.
@SenMikeLee There are areas where the state should have primary control. But there are also areas where it makes sense to have uniform national policies. Mike Lee may have his own opinions on where that line is drawn, but we disagree that differences on that line will lead to "civil war"
@SenMikeLee Our senator would have us go back to the few original purposes that the nation banded together, but our nation has changed! And even he isn't fully true to his views because he believes the federal government should continue senior entitlements-where is that in the Constitution?
@SenMikeLee And most consequentially in changing this balance of power was the adoption of the 14th Amendment (which was adopted by the states!). States were no longer trusted to protect our individual liberties and so more power was given to the nation to ensure equality and rights
@SenMikeLee The balance of power in the constitution as originally written may have tilted more toward states. But the reality of our situation changed over time. We became more interconnected. We needed common regulations b/c unlike what Lee says, what happens in other states can affect us

Our statement regarding the claim from @RepMiaLove and her campaign prior to the debate and during her closing statements #utpol https://t.co/szJGCQA2aL
@MiaBLove We continue to call on her campaign to return all the money raised after the date of the Convention, as required by the law and regulations of the FEC #utpol
@MiaBLove But of note in Love's statement is that she can only keep the money raised PRIOR to the convention. She continued to raise money AFTER the convention and so far has said she would only redesignate that money, rather than returning it to voters as required. #utpol
@MiaBLove Once we receive an official response, we will release that to the public. If the FEC does say she could keep that money, we will accept that official ruling. #utpol
A statement from the @MiaBLove campaign is not an official clearance from the Federal Election Commission. @betterutah submitted an official complaint to the FEC, which has just been confirmed as received by the Commission. #utpol https://t.co/BEijTTwsUh

@nathanevershed takes issue with Gill‚Äôs statements about women in the office. Says promotions will occur based on merit, not politics. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says they‚Äôve made an effort to hire women. They‚Äôre fiscally sound, preparing for the next 25 years with tech. Lists projects and programs and organizations they‚Äôre working with. #utdebates #utpol
@nathanevershed says the women in the office don‚Äôt have a voice‚Äîtalks about DV Taskforce being disbanded for four years under Gill. #utpol #utdebates
Final question: how is the DA‚Äôs office currently serving the people of SL County? #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says it‚Äôs an issue of rhetoric vs record.
@SimGillDA says we need Medicaid expansion to help with criminal justice reform. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says we tried to address this issue in 2015‚Äîit sounded really good but wasn‚Äôt done in a judicious and wise way. Reforms were good but funding was insufficient. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says we must go back to the core causes‚Äîstop criminalizing addiction and mental illness. We‚Äôre on a trajectory of bankruptcy w/way we address incarceration. This issue is driven by some extent by our failures to address the causes. #utdebates #utpol
What have you done/will you do on the issue of mass incarceration? #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA and @nathanevershed shake hands over their agreement on the death penalty. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says people want a DA who struggles with the death penalty, not one who uses it cavalierly. Death penalty is appropriate for certain cases, but he struggles with it. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says the death penalty should be available but rarely used. Says he‚Äôs the only one in this debate who has prosecuted a death penalty case and says it‚Äôs not something he‚Äôd ever take lightly. #utpol #utdebates
Describe your opinion on the death penalty. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says he agrees with Evershed but the right questions aren‚Äôt being answered‚Äîwhy are minorities entering the criminal justice system at higher rates to begin with? "This conversation has been long overdue." #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says we need a full-time Spanish interpreter in the office which is not the case currently. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says the role of the DA is to make sure there is justice for everyone regardless of race and make sure everyone who comes into the system is to be approached with respect and dignity. Says engagement w/community is important. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says we have a problem with race in the U.S. and says people of color are disproportionately incarcerated in Utah. Says we must acknowledge them and make sure the law is fair. #utpol #utdebates
How have national conversations about race impacted the role of the DA? #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA Says it‚Äôs an issue nationwide. Use of force against individuals has been secret for too long that impacts communities of color and in poverty for too long. Defends his publishing of reports and mentions the independent Taskforce. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed said the responsibility is the same as for any other case. Use the evidence presented and act in a timely manner. #utpol #utdebates
What should the DA‚Äôs approach be to officer-involved shootings? #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says he can‚Äôt support Prop 2 but wants to find a balanced approach to allow patients to get the help they need without the legal issues. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says the prosecutor doesn‚Äôt create the law, just enforces the law. He said the #utleg failed to pass medical cannabis‚Äîbelieves that patients should have access, but doesn‚Äôt agree w/language in Prop 2. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says he supports medical cannabis. Doesn‚Äôt want a public prosecutor standing between patients and their doctors. Supports Prop 2 because it‚Äôs a ballot initiative and the will of the people and the #utleg didn‚Äôt do it themselves. ‚ÄúLet the ppl vote." #utpol #utdebates
How should the DA treat marijuana? #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed brings up a study from the University of Utah saying ECR didn‚Äôt work. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand Rio Grande without understanding ECR.‚Äù #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says we approach criminal justice reform through access to medication and therapeutic justice. Says Operation Rio Grande is an example of what‚Äôs going on‚Äîaccess to mental health services will give us better return on the dollar. #utpol #utdebates
Next question: what is the role of the District Attorney in criminal justice reform? #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says public trust in the DA‚Äôs office has been damaged. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says there‚Äôs corruption and malfeasance in institutions in Utah.
@nathanevershed expresses concerns about public‚Äôs trust of the office. Says power of the prosecutor is huge and important. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA says turnover rate is around 6%. Again, the art is brought up.  #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says HR director (who spoke up from the audience) says turnover is 31%. Says the DA office is a toxic work environment. Still not happy with the giraffe art. #utpol #utdebate
Moderator has to give a warning to the audience to settle down.
@SimGillDA says that Evershed‚Äôs claims about a fourth of the office leaving is false. He says saying such a thing is an insult to the office and the attorneys in the office. He said a good district attorney starts by telling the truth. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed @nathanevershed said a good DA leads from the front. Calls into question Gill‚Äôs experience in the courtroom and mentions office engagement and politics. #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed Next question: what makes a good DA? #utpol #utdebates
@nathanevershed says the DA office spent a lot of money on a piece of art that looks like a giraffe. Calls into question fiscal responsibility with office turnover. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA @nathanevershed @SimGillDA says his office has returned millions of dollars to the taxpayer. #utpol #utdebates
@SimGillDA @nathanevershed says there‚Äôs an issue with fiscal responsibility in the DA‚Äôs office right now. Believes DA should lead from the front‚Äîin the boardroom and the courtroom. We‚Äôre the only County Attorney‚Äôs office on the Wasatch Front that doesn‚Äôt have good relationship w/US Attorney
@SimGillDA says the purpose of the DA is changing. It‚Äôs about advocating for those who don‚Äôt have a voice. It‚Äôs about balancing budgets and making sure you have the resources to do the job. It‚Äôs about mental illness and issues in regards to homelessness. #utpol

@SSNUtah @SSNScholars Agreed! Thank you, Dr. Grogan.
Thanks for joining us! Be sure to check out @action_utah‚Äôs Facebook live post-panel discussion. #utpol
Now taking questions. Do you have any questions about Medicaid expansion for the panelists? #utpol
In states that have expanded Medicaid, marketplace insurance costs are 7% lower across the board.
22,000+ Utah children are eligible for Medicaid/CHIP coverage but are currently without insurance because their parents fall into the Medicaid gap. Children are more likely to be insured when their parents are. #utpol
Curtis says a vote for Prop 3 is a vote for 150,000 Utahns to have healthcare. #utpol
Grogan says you can‚Äôt deny that healthcare costs are extremely high in the U.S. States that have taken Medicaid expansion have been innovative with cost reforms such as preventative services. #utpol
Singer says people who qualify for Medicaid are largely employed. Asks if work requirements actually incentivize work or just put up bureaucratic red tape. #utpol
Grogan talks about the divisive rhetoric surrounding work requirements and Medicaid expansion. Says it‚Äôs a very basic value question to the citizens of Utah. ‚ÄúDo you want to pit people against each other?‚Äù #utpol
Curtis says that currently, a family of four making $13k-$25k a year don‚Äôt qualify for Medicaid and don‚Äôt qualify for subsidies on the marketplace. #utpol
Rylee Curtis from @UtahDecides says the partial expansion is an unknown because we are waiting for federal approval. She talks about Prop 3 being an opportunity for Utahns to make the decision instead of having to endlessly wait. #utpol
Phillip Singer talks about the experience of Arkansas implementing partial expansion and work requirements.
Dr. Grogan says that the work requirement for the partial Medicaid expansion is incredibly problematic and is a question of values. #utpol

Full statement here #utpol https://t.co/843KRUU56l
We would hope Hatch would be more concerned with getting at the truth than with discrediting women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.
Spreading a message that Kavanaugh‚Äôs accusers are lying--while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of claims against Kavanaugh--signals to survivors of sexual assault that their experiences are immaterial in deciding who holds power in this country.
Even if all of Ketterer‚Äôs statements about Swetnick are accurate, they in no way diminish the severity or credibility of Swetnick‚Äôs allegations.
Sharing salacious details about Swetnick‚Äôs personal life on Twitter is a blatant ‚Äúslut-shaming‚Äù attempt to discredit her character in the court of public opinion.
Considering Swetnick has not even been granted an interview with the FBI, it is befuddling why Hatch has chosen to publicly smear her character in this way.
For all his hand-wringing over political tribalism, Senator Hatch has repeatedly chosen to put his own partisan agenda above the legitimacy of the Supreme Court. #utpol https://t.co/zKBhwmshLf

And now we‚Äôre at closing comments. Thanks to @VoteSuz and @bradforhouse for a robust and exciting debate!
@bradforhouse says he will be completely transparent in his dealings. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@votesuz says too much gov‚Äôt work happens behind closed doors. Pledges to only attend open-door caucus meetings. Addresses needs for campaign finance laws. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@votesuz says she would have voted against Bramble‚Äôs bill to weaken ethics laws in Utah. Talks about building trust with constituents and communities. Believes business of public should be conducted in public.
Next question deals with anti-corruption and government accountability.
@votesuz says we can‚Äôt relax emission standards and make an impact on poor air quality. Talks about a patient of hers who regularly has to leave town in order to breathe. Mentions innovative solutions, promoting cleaner fuels, address better air monitoring, #HD32Debate #utpol
@bradforhouse says air quality is not a partisan issue. Talks about electric cars and the growth in technology that help us participate in green measures. Regulation/punitive measures are not motivators. Look for incentives for people to go green. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question deals with air quality. Why are you the most qualified candidate to deal with this issue and the associated challenges?
@bradforhouse is all about the Democrats and that‚Äôs why @votesuz supports it. He says he‚Äôs against it. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@votesuz speaks strongly in favor of Prop 4.
Next question is about Prop 4 (fair redistricting). Do you support Prop 4? If it doesn‚Äôt pass, what steps will you take to ensure Utah voters feel boundaries are fairly drawn?
@votesuz says she‚Äôs fully opposed to recreational marijuana use but as a doctor, supports medical use. Because the legislature has failed to act on this issue, she will vote yes on Prop 2. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse says he will vote no on Prop 2 due to concerns about loose regulation. ‚ÄúIt turns into a recreational drug that‚Äôs acceptable to children and teens who just want to get high.‚Äù #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question deals with Prop 2, medical cannabis.
@bradforhouse says you can‚Äôt raise taxes and be a fiscal conservative (in a conversation about Prop 3)
She says Prop 3 is fiscally responsible that provides primary and preventative care. Says Spendlove‚Äôs bill will likely be turned down by fed gov‚Äôt.
@votesuz talks about her experience as a doctor in the emergency room seeing people who waited too long to get to the hospital because they didn‚Äôt have insurance. She says tax payers are paying in higher premiums if we don‚Äôt expand. She supported Healthy Utah plan.
(‚ÄúIt‚Äù being full Medicaid expansion)
@bradforhouse says he supports Spendlove‚Äôs expansion compromise. Says ‚Äúit sounds like a small tax‚Äù but it all adds up for people who can‚Äôt afford it. If you want more money for education, roads, etc, then you must vote against Prop 3. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question deals with healthcare. Do you support Prop 3 (medicaid expansion)?
@votesuz also mentions per pupil spending. Talks about huge class sizes and teacher shortage. Also addresses the mental health crisis in schools. Less testing, more local control through cost-effective means. More teacher mentoring programs. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse says he will vote ‚Äúno‚Äù on the Our Schools Now compromise. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse says per pupil spending is low, but our teachers get better test scores per dollar than in any other state. He‚Äôs grateful he had a choice on where to send his kids to school. Teacher pay needs to increase--we must be competitive w/pay rates. #HD32Debate #utpol
Next question deals with education. What policies are needed to achieve Utah‚Äôs best educational outcomes?
@votesuz commends McAdams, Cox, and Hughes for their work on Operation Rio Grande but says we still have a long way to go. Says we can‚Äôt arrest ourselves out of this problem. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse applauds efforts and solutions from Operation Rio Grande.
@bradforhouse agrees this is a community issue. Says underlying issues need to be addressed, including addiction and mental health issues. He talks about homeless needing help. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@votesuz says homelessness is an issue we can‚Äôt solve without everyone coming together. We need better funding for addiction treatment and mental health services. Wants innovative solutions. Says homelessness is a statewide problem that must be treated with compassion.
Next question deals with the homelessness issue.
@votesuz Says we don‚Äôt want to become like CA in terms of housing. This will take a statewide solution. No community can take this on alone. Bad growth is being pushed by developers. Speaks against high-density housing in Sandy. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse says what we do today will determine our success when the growth happens. Work for transit oriented development and affordable housing. Help local governments plan and develop. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse talks about his work in the tech sector. He explains a private business going to colleges and training employees to prep for the work force. Training workers leads to higher wages. Looks for opportunities to innovate and agrees with @votesuz that legislature lags.
(Audience is enthusiastically applauding both candidates)
@votesuz Says we need strategic investments in education now. Kids are our greatest resource. #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
@bradforhouse Talks about focusing on training and competition in the workplace is a better answer than telling businesses how they should be run. Touts Utah‚Äôs pro-business record.  #HD32Debate #utpol #utdebates
First question deals with economy. What policies would you encourage your legislative colleagues to consider to address Utah‚Äôs lagging wages?

Final question deals with increased partisanship in the country and the state. How will you build relationships that will further the interests of your constituents while also acting as a member of the Marjory/minority party? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Riebe says when we don‚Äôt pay for social services then we pay for them in the long run. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe says we need to start building up the general fund because it provides needed services. If we‚Äôre not going to raise taxes then we shouldn‚Äôt be creating new programs. She speaks in favor of the gas tax. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ says he thinks any effort to fund education is a win for him. He supports the gas tax. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question deals with taxes. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Zehnder mentions Mike Lee‚Äôs Pure Act. Says he‚Äôs not sure that‚Äôs the way to go, but it‚Äôs worth looking at. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe @docBrianZ says his biggest problem is with executive decisions flip flopping on public lands. Says the antiquities act needs to be reformed‚Äîmore Utahns need to be involved in deciding how our lands are classified. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe says she supports public lands and the antiquities act. We need to preserve them. Has no comment on the lawsuit against CA. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question is about public lands. What is your stance on how to balance public lands and our land use for our economy? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @docBrianZ and @Mskriebe both say they support Prop 4. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ Next question deals with Prop 4‚Äîfair redistricting. Do you support Prop 4? If the proposition doesn‚Äôt pass, what would you do to ensure that boundaries are better drawn given polling numbers of Utahns supporting it? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ (We‚Äôre disappointed that the slogan for medical marijuana hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúa higher bar for health‚Äù from the beginning.)
@docBrianZ says as a doctor he‚Äôs always looking for ways to elevate suffering. Marijuana is a class 1 drug and that‚Äôs a problem. Medical marijuana is not about getting high, it‚Äôs about a higher bar for health. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe says without regulation of marijuana, we have a whole myriad of issues. We must regulate it, put safeguards in, and then adjust it if there are problems. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question deals with Prop 2 (medical cannabis). How would you implement it and deal with religious liberty concerns? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe says opioid crisis has had a detrimental impact on our schools. Best way to combat the crisis is through education programs in schools. We can make curriculum more robust and supports Prop 3 as an alternative pain management. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ says he‚Äôs proud of the legislation that the legislature passed to address the opioid epidemic. As a doctor who has seen this issue first hand, he says we need to go after bad actors who make it bad for everyone. We need to educate youth. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Next question deals with the opioid crisis. What would you do to address the epidemic? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ says if medicaid expansion passes we have to be prepared for a tax increase. He says other states have seen a portion of their budget go up after they passed medicaid expansion. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe says it‚Äôs not an unknown cost. Premiums go down in other states when they pass full expansion. It‚Äôs irresponsible to not look at the trends that have been shown in other states that have passed medicaid expansion. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Zehnder says it‚Äôs true that full expansion would cost Utahns. We‚Äôre very fiscally conservative‚Äîwe balance our budget every year. There‚Äôs no way to cap the 10% of costs that Utahns would be responsible for. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ Was a sponsor of the partial expansion legislation that passed earlier this year and he talks about his work on it. Says full expansion would be the law of the land which would entail a tax increase, but if it passes he‚Äôd be ok with it. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Riebe says that ballot initiatives are the constituents begging for their legislators to make the hard decisions. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe says she supports the medicaid expansion initiative. Everyone deserves healthcare. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
Now we‚Äôre talking about healthcare and medicaid expansion that‚Äôs on the ballot.  Do you support the ballot initiative? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @Mskriebe says top priority for education funding would be investing in class size reduction. Says teachers she talks with say that‚Äôs the number one reason they leave the profession. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @docBrianZ says top priority for education funding would be investing in teacher pay. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @Mskriebe says they go to the legislature every year and ask for money. She ties in suicide rates and sexual assault rates. Says it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre not investing in our kids and in their futures. It‚Äôs a moral responsibility to invest in kids. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @Mskriebe says as a school teacher, we‚Äôre not doing the best by our schools. She talks about class sizes‚Äîthis is not ok for our students or communities. Our kids are starting behind and have to work to make up time their whole life. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @docBrianZ says we need to continue to invest in our education. We need to attract teachers and pay them well because we can‚Äôt fall behind other countries who are investing in their future leaders of tomorrow. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @docBrianZ says education determines the trajectory of a life. He‚Äôs proud of the $150M the legislature gave to colleges this year. He said we still have more to do. We‚Äôre in the bottom 10% of funding for our children and that needs to change. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe Next question deals with school funding , talks about the Our Schools Now compromise. What policies are still needed to achieve Utah‚Äôs best educational outcomes. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @docBrianZ says young people can‚Äôt get houses because there‚Äôs a shortage. Also mentions housing sprawl, and then needing to build up in downtown SLC. Prior to that we must ensure we have better infrastructure‚Äîmentions roads. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @docBrianZ says growth is probably our number one issue we‚Äôre going to be facing as a state over the next 30 years. When he talks with people, they‚Äôre all concerned about growth. Mentions our growth will be about the size of Draper every year. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe @Mskriebe says we need to look at affordable housing. People who work in more affluent communities can‚Äôt always afford to live there. She talks about urban sprawl, lack of connectivity without cars, and connecting neighborhoods. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe Next question deals with exponential growth anticipated in the coming years for Utah. Population growth has been cited as one of our biggest challenges. What policies would you implement to address this challenge? #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ @Mskriebe says we have to make sure that 800-1,600 diesel trucks that the inland port would bring in won‚Äôt impact our communities. Also wants to look at the open meetings act and make them harder to circumnavigate. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@docBrianZ says he sometimes goes against his party regarding the inland port. He thinks the subcommittee meetings should be open with some exceptions. #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe @SenatorLuz @docBrianZ Next question deals with the inland port. @docBrianZ says he was the only member of the senate of his party who voted against it. He wants it done, but wants it done right. Wants it done with clean energy sources. 		#SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe @SenatorLuz @docBrianZ @Mskriebe talks rebuts and talks about wage gap for women and our per-pupil spending. @docBrianZ says he agrees. 		 #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe @SenatorLuz @docBrianZ @docBrianZ addresses using a fair market approach to paying people well. 		 #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
@Mskriebe @SenatorLuz @docBrianZ says we‚Äôre very blessed and talks about the relationship Utah has with other organizations in other states. He talks about needing to attract jobs and opportunities with a level playing field.
@Mskriebe @SenatorLuz @Mskriebe also talks about job growth and making sure we‚Äôre creating good jobs that pay well and give good hours.
@Mskriebe says she would support a fair pay bill like @SenatorLuz‚Äôs. She talks about her conversations with union workers. Build economic opportunities by getting more education, but also looking to create better jobs for more people. 		 #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates
First question deals with lagging wages in Utah and lagging wage growth in Utah.		 #SD8debate #utpol #utdebates

@N242DB @Patbagley @gopTODD @BBforUtah Exactly. That's what we said: "representatives of the people." So...why should they then turn around and sue over a law passed by their constituents?
@N242DB @Patbagley @gopTODD @BBforUtah Individuals sued to overturn it, claiming it violated their individual rights under the federal constitution. 		This would be the Legislature, aka the representatives of the people and created by the people, filing a lawsuit to overturn a ballot measure approved by the people.

Which should be great for Utah lawmakers, because even just this last session the Legislature was arguing about the necessity of passing possibly unconstitutional laws in order to toe the line on issues #utpol
So, it's arguable that at least part of the law points to the federal government's willingness to allow states to experiment with the implementation of medical cannabis #utpol

5. If we‚Äôre going to be super concerned about the broadness of ‚Äúchronic pain‚Äù as a list of qualifying conditions, it should be equally applicable to its ease of use for obtaining opioids. Medical cannabis is a safer and less addictive treatment
4. What‚Äôs the difference between a pharmacy and a dispensary? Not much other than the monopoly of the pharmacist. Do pharmacists somehow have special training in cannabis? Either way, Louisiana just switched out the name ‚Äúdispensaries‚Äù for ‚Äúpharmacies.‚Äù They operate the same
3. The 100 mile ‚Äúself-grow‚Äù provision is only a fail safe for if the state doesn‚Äôt do its job in properly licensing dispensaries that are available to residents throughout the state. It‚Äôs simple‚Äîjust do your job.
2. Police would be able to distinguish between legal &amp; illegal forms of the ‚Äúmedicine.‚Äù If they have a legal medical cannabis card, they have legal medical cannabis. If they don‚Äôt have recommendation, it‚Äôs illegal. Same with prescription drugs‚Äîthey‚Äôd have a prescription
1. This initiative is not ‚Äúde facto legalization of recreational use.‚Äù There are controls on who can make and receive recommendations and how they can obtain the medicine. Saying it‚Äôs recreational because that‚Äôs a scary buzzword doesn‚Äôt actually make it recreational

We hope the Inland Port Authority Board reconsiders and we call on lawmakers to re-examine the Open Meetings Law in light of this unfortunate decision. #utpol
This sets bad precedent for the transparency of government bodies in our state. To shield decision making processes, all that commissions or boards must do is split into small enough subcommittees and then rubber stamp any decisions those subcommittees make #utpol
Essentially, the public is left to see only the process of using a rubber stamp to validate any work done by the subcommittees. The public should have the ability to see that work and hear those discussion. #utpol
The Board had the opportunity today to be open and transparent to the public, but instead decided to keep its decision-making shielded behind closed doors simply because state law allows it to do so #utpol
#InlandPort Authority Board decided once again to keep subcommittee meetings closed to the public, ignoring the recent outcry from concerned individuals and organizations #utpol https://t.co/qMzA9W6hV4

One of the main arguments against opening meeting is that all decisions have to be approved by full Board anyways. But wouldn‚Äôt this just mean that all we see is the rubber stamp? What about the ‚Äúsub decisions‚Äù that went into making final ‚Äúdecision‚Äù? #utpol

Now talking about autonomous vehicles and the changes that will come along with them. Safer and more convenient. But will they disrupt government revenue streams? Will they help ease congestion? #utpol
@Clintonite33 That‚Äôd be really tough! Buses and public transit don‚Äôt make sense for everyone!
@40plusguy @MTAmericaExpoC Carpooling is great! Is there anything you feel can be done to improve transportation in Utah?
Also talking about electric vehicles this morning. There is a lot of positive movement in this sector in Utah; however, forward movement in infrastructure and policy is needed to make sure that continues #utpol
It was very telling about Utah‚Äôs transportation culture when the moderator asked the audience how they got to the @MTAmericaExpoC this morning. Over 90% used cars and just a few people used public transit. #utpol 		How did you commute to work this morning?
In other words, we can‚Äôt just continue building more highways in Utah as our population continues to explode. Public transit, on-demand mobility, and other options need to be in the table as we move forward #utpol
First two speakers on the panel are from @UtahDOT and @RideUTA, highlighting the need for multi-modal transportation #utpol

That‚Äôs all, folks. Meeting is going past the two hour timeframe but we‚Äôre heading out.
A gentleman is angry that members of the county council aren‚Äôt present tonight. He says it‚Äôs shameful that people were so upset about this development and that the county council passed it with a nearly unanimous vote.
A young woman who graduated from Herriman high five years ago explicitly called this a community in crisis in regards to the suicides. Gave her personal story about being seen by a counselor at school who saved her. Called for leaders to think of the kids. #OlympiaHills
Farmer Luke from Petersen Family Farms gave a heartfelt call for open space and making space for people who will be impacted. He then said he‚Äôll get to cussin‚Äô because that‚Äôs what farmers do.
üåà üéâ https://t.co/4j6BXARg7t
Concerns about our aging population not being taken into consideration with this development are raised. Only way to build is up, which is difficult for older Utahns.
First person to mention the pollution impact asks for the plan to be vetoed. Another woman brings up school crowding again and addresses the suicides at Herriman High again. She also asks for a veto.
A lifelong Utahn says Utah is behind the times with growth. Calls for infrastructure fix prior to the development. She calls for an East-West freeway before #Olympiahills. #utpol
People are making comparisons to  density in New York City and Los Angeles. Says @HerrimanCity will be tasked with supporting all the students since #OlympiaHills is only residential.
Member of the Jordan school board is raising concerns about school crowding. Mentions the sad year Herriman High (where we‚Äôre at now) has had with a slew of suicides, and suggests less crowding might have stopped some of that pain before it happened. #utpol
Now an elaborate teenage feet‚Äîshoe metaphor about making sure we‚Äôve got the right fit. Followed up with a question about whether the county council has even been to the area.
Another person says ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a mess out here and #olympiahills will make it worse.‚Äù
Another man says he moved here because there was zoning in place that would have stopped this development. Says it‚Äôs the job of the county council to protect constituents from a businessman trying to maximize profits. #utpol #olympiahills
A man says the developer of #OlympiaHills abandoned a development in Payson and left the city footing the bill. #utpol
A man who has lived in the Herriman area since the ‚Äò70s says the east-west roads need to be at least six lanes wide. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting a little ridiculous.‚Äù
One gentleman from Bluffdale talks about his struggle to keep his city rural. He finishes by thanking the mayors for being strong and holding this town hall.
One man wants to know why this was approved in the first place. People are asking questions but it‚Äôs not a back-and-forth forum.
There‚Äôs a question about whether or not we need this growth. Side note‚Äîmake these events more bearable by making jokes while commenting. So far the comments have been weirdly funny.
Someone suggests amending the plan to include only 12 houses. She‚Äôs not a fan of high density housing.

He also says that progress is slow but it‚Äôs still progress. He talks about finding people you can work with. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says it‚Äôs essential to build relationships and learn to work with others. He talks about his work on the LGBTQ movement. You find where you share common values and then build policy around those values. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb talked about the hostile environments she walked into when working on naloxone. She‚Äôs learned to build relationships and find people she can work with. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb says she‚Äôs learned int he past number of years learning how to engage with people who don‚Äôt see the world the way she does. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Last question is about partisanship and holding a seat in the minority. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
She says this state loves its families but we have to be realistic. She talks about apprenticeships and how we need to train a workforce. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb addresses the same issues. Talks about the moved prison at the point of the mountain. Legislature hasn‚Äôt planned for schools, but they‚Äôve planned for everything else when faced with our growth. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says a growing population also offers an opportunity. He says growth will reveal tensions in our community and we have to get ahead of it. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says Salt Lake County is pricing people out and we‚Äôre driving people further south. We need to pay attention to housing, pre-k, retraining, and address our air quality. Population growth will impact our environment. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Next question is about our growing population. Population growth is one of our biggest challenges and opportunities. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen also says we need workplace development and folding people in our economy. Help people transition from one job to another. All it takes is leadership from the legislature and money. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
He also says money is a huge component. We need to look at generational issues and look at where we can get most bang for our buck. We must start pre-k for all kids in Utah. It‚Äôs an investment in what we have. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen talks about per pupil spending as well, and talked about his time working in the SLC school districts and the large class sizes. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb wants to bring other skillsets to our kids and get our curriculum to be reflective of the big changes that are coming. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
She talks about IEPs that are child focused and finding the needs of the children‚Äîwe can find a good example of good education from special education classrooms and child-focused education. Also need a change in our curriculum. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb says we need to pay teachers more and get class sizes down. We‚Äôve got to find ways to prioritize education and put the money there. We have to take a look at how we‚Äôre treating our students and schooling them. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Next question is about education and the Our Schools Now initiative. It would end around $850 in per pupil spending but would still leave us at the bottom of national teacher salaries. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb also agrees that schools shouldn‚Äôt be funded with a flat tax. She doesn‚Äôt understand why we‚Äôre giving tax breaks to corporations. Corporations who don‚Äôt need it. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb doesn‚Äôt like income taxes funding other programs. She thinks income tax needs to be looked at and says it‚Äôs not fair that the top 1% have it lucky. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen talks about looking at our neighbors for progressive tax reform and broadening our tax base. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says that medicaid expansion being funded by a sales tax gives him heartache because it impacts the low-income families. The school funding from gas tax stays flat regardless of how well the economy is doing. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says tax reform is complicated and talks about the federal tax reform. The legislature is considering fixing some of that bill and its impact on Utahns. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Next question is about taxes! The Our Schools Now initiative compromise and the tax increase to fund medicaid expansion. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen talks about empowering cities to take the steps they need to address affordable housing. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen talks about 2.5% vacancy rate in SLC which is a record low. We‚Äôre going to double in size in terms of population. Kitchen says we need to build housing for our growing population. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
She doesn‚Äôt want the state to mandate or tell municipalities anything. She wants more affordable housing and would vote for a $15+ min wage. She also talks about the low server wage. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb remembers selling homes for $120k in the avenues in the 90s. She says lots of young professionals are kept out of the home market. We haven‚Äôt found a way to incentivize affordable housing. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Next question addresses housing prices in Utah and policies to address housing affordability. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
She says right now, lots of people who need social services end up in her ER. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb says we need more licensed social workers and people working in mental health and we need to fund those resources. We don‚Äôt need mandates from the states, we need funding. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says that in order to fix these issues‚Äîhomelessness and drug abuse‚Äîwe must start with universal pre-k, expanded medicaid, $15 min wage. Finding ways to empower people to take care of themselves. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb says that what happened to those on the ground was not that simple. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Drugs have come in from our northern border and other areas. Sense of lawlessness and lack of safety was hard, but ORG also victimized people who are already victims. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb didn‚Äôt see Operation Rio Grande from the inside‚Äîshe saw it from the streets. She talks about cartels bringing heroin to Utah. She says it‚Äôs racist to say that all the drug cartels are Honduran. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says Rio Grande freed up jail beds but it terrified our already hurt population. It‚Äôs made people feel insecure in our cities. ORG may not have been the best model and helped us root out a drug cartel. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says that operation rio grande was a huge mixed bag. He knew that something had to be done‚ÄîSLC is the crossroads for all of #Utah on this issue. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Next question is about homelessness and operation Rio Grande. Asks candidates to outline their positions on operation rio grande. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen also addresses the non-political nature of the need. These are real people and how we had a surplus and we could access those services if we choose to. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb talks about homelessness issue and how help from SLC was actually not helpful. She sits on a Taskforce to add her voice. She said she doesn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs too expensive‚Äîwe need to make it work. People need these services. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
@camp_r0bber Check it out on our fb page: https://t.co/CHo8GyjbTa
Next question‚Äîmedicaid expansion and the criticisms from Governor Herbert and others about its fiscal irresponsibility. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Plumb supports medical marijuana and has been asked whether or not she supports the rescission campaign by the UMA since she is a member. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
(Sorry for the weird hashtags‚Ä¶that‚Äôs what we get for copying and pasting!)
Plumb is amazed at the work that went into getting the ballot initiatives the required number of signatures. She doesn‚Äôt see a role for the legislature getting in the way of the signatures. #SD2primarydebate #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen also supports the medicaid expansion initiative and the medical marijuana initiative. Talks about the need of medicaid expansion to help with homelessness. #SD2primarydebate about to start! #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen says that Better Boundaries is the ‚Äúgrand daddy‚Äù of the initiatives. Other initiatives would have been addressed by elected officials if we didn‚Äôt have gerrymandering. #SD2primarydebate about to start! #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Next question is about ballot initiatives and their importance. #SD2primarydebate about to start! #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
He mentions his time as an office holder vs as a candidate. He says even if elected office is technically a part time job, you really work full time while listening to constituents.  #SD2primarydebate about to start! #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate
Kitchen talks about people in South Jordan don‚Äôt vote because they feel like their vote doesn‚Äôt matter.
Plumb talks about her decision to run for office and says getting signatures is a difficult process. She said the process is about engaging with people and giving them an opportunity to get involved. #SD2primarydebate about to start! #utpol #utdebates #SD2 #SD2debate

After correcting that this $83,000 would be done under contract with UVU, rather than awarding a grant, the Commission on Federalism entered into the contract, which can be found here: https://t.co/4SC4RyMDu5		#utpol #utleg
According to the grant proposal, the index would be used to assign "federalism scores" to the fifty states based on 10-15 "federalism topics." #utpol #utleg
This "federalism index" is an attempt by the commission and UVU's Center for Constitutional Studies to trace what federalism looked like at the time of the 1787 Constitutional Convention #utpol #utleg
