The universe works in mysterious ways.
Let go of the invisible string that connects you to your past. Lose the hope. Lose all of it. Live with the burden of truth. Now. Today. Go. Live. - Akif Kichloo
The bigger they are, the harder they fall.  The earth is littered with the ruins of so called "empires" that believed they were eternal. #DontLetTheDoorHitYou https://t.co/Fo6Np6eSz0
One day you will find that soul that you can connect with on every level From your past to your passions from your fears to your goals from your hopes to your dreams  A connection on every level The energy will be electric The vibes will be undeniable The chemistry will be insane
Someday someone is going to look at you like you are the best thing in the world.
It's not your fault.  Sometimes brave women fall in love with cowards.  r.h.Sin
Remember not getting what you want is sometimes a stroke of luck.
You should not rip yourself into pieces to make others whole.
Sometimes you have to just let go and see what happens.

I may have lost someone who didn't love me, but you lost someone who truly loved you. 		When it is all finished, you will discover it was never random.		It wasn't a waste of time if you learned something.

@BullPup2A @BlueArmyFaction Unfortunately she isn't a very happy person.
@graywolf442 If instead politicians got into politics to make a difference what a different world this would be.  But instead they heard of the many riches they could receive and decided to sell their soul.
@MaidentheUSA1 I am humbled by your kind words.  Thank you.  You my dear are also awesome.  Perhaps the reason why our paths have crossed.

@graywolf442 Tell me how gov't can solve problems, when gov't itself is a problem.  Socialism doesn't work.  Ask Bernie why he needs to led "sheep into poverty, when he mocks the rich, here's my question?  Isn't he one of the rich?  Wasn't his wife under scrutiny (fraud). #Givemeabreak
@MaidentheUSA1 I am truly happy for you.  It's great to know you.  I'm entering a period where I am meeting such truly kind people everywhere I go.  It's a great feeling. If I could give just one advice it's to be kind, so kind and so full of love inside you, you truly feel free.

I don't know how you are so familiar to me or why it feels less like I am getting to know you and more as though I am remembering who you are.  How every smile, every whisper brings me closer to the impossible conclusion that I have known you before, I have loved you before
You will always be the feeling I felt too much.
@MaidentheUSA1 It's not easy, you can never totally let EGO go, It's never truly gone.  However, we can let go of judgment, hate, jealousy.... etc.  Never take anything personal, and always do your best.
Can't believe this..... https://t.co/ntMNJ0uWcV
"Don't fall in love just because someone pays a little bit of attention to you."
She can like you a whole lot and still turn around and leave you.  Remember, a good woman knows her worth.  She'd rather suffer in silence than feel unloved, unwanted, unappreciated.  To know her is to love her.
@MaidentheUSA1 Letting go of the ego can be scary, but it is the most illuminating, awe-inspiring, expansive and enlightening.  Read: The 7 stages of Ego Death by Aletheia Luma

TWO SOULS	When two souls are meant to connect: Location, Timing + circumstances are all irrelevant.  They suddenly become a magnet for one another + despite their efforts to fight it. The universe somehow manipulates it all in their favour + the moment, when they finally give in.
My dear you are beautiful, smart, talented, cherished, important, special, worthy and loved.  Don't allow your own thoughts to tell you otherwise.
@mistidebonno Here's to chasing our dreams in the cutest pair of shoes you own. #loveshoes  Shoes complete me.  #louboutin
Don't lie to an over thinker.  It never ends well.  Such people have trained their brains to look for holes in a story.  If it doesn't make sense they will think about it over and over until it makes sense.  I'm that person.
@anchor_makhoba Be patient,  you need only listen with your heart, your journey has just begun.  Watch for the signs.  Read: The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle
To be beautiful means to be yourself.  You don't need to be accepted by others.  You need to accept yourself.
In the end, we all just want someone who chooses us... Over everyone else, under any circumstances.

#MondayMotivation this is your Monday reminder that you can handle anything this week will throw at you.
Never beg someone to love you back or be with you.  Never beg for someone's attention, time, commitment, or affection.  Never beg someone to stay with you when you need them the most.  No one that loves you would need you to beg them for their love.
If your heart hurts a little after letting go of someone, that's okay. It just means that your feelings were genuine.  No one likes endings.  But sometimes we have to put things that were once good to an end after they turn toxic to our wellbeing.  Not everyone is meant to stay.
@CavalloJewelry Sometimes we give love to the wrong person. Never regret it.  You should think of the fact that you were able to give love, because if you are able to give love that means you have it inside you.  And that alone makes you a beautiful person.
@michael_house9 Trudeau spends a fortune on perks paid for by taxpayers:	$28k to groom his personal ski trails	$24k on a new floating dock and deck	$7.5k to hook up trudeau's sauna	$10k on a new screened patio	$3k on three patio umbrellas	$8.5 on new boat racks	$7.5k for a swing set ..... etc..
5 ways to not be used:	* believe patterns not apologies	*don't fall in love with potential	*believe red flags	*know your worth	*don't lower your standards.
Every time I think of you I have to remind myself that if you wanted to talk to me, you would.
Never let a man tell you twice that he doesn't want you.
No response is a response. And it's a powerful one.  Remember that.
Eventually you'll end up where you need to be, with who you're meant to be with, and doing what you should be doing.
A heart that always understands also gets tired.

One day, whether you are 14, 28 or 65 you will stumble upon someone who will start a fire in you that cannot die.  However, the saddest most awful truth you will ever come to find -- is they are not always with whom we spend our lives.
One day you're going to look back and say, Damn that girl really did love me.

@thomsinger It's not about "not liking you", I believe this so called close friend has issues to deal with, and the number one issue is to learn how to be a kind human being, not a shallow ignorant low life.  *May you only attract kindness from this day on.   	#BeKindAlways
There's no hiding from your soulmate;  they will find you, you will fall and they will stay.
I want you to remember one thing. Wherever you are and wherever you go, you will always be loved.  Until my last breath and beyond, you will be loved.  JmStorm
There will be dozens of people who will take your breath away but the one who reminds you to breathe is the one you should keep.
The person you love should be where you can calm your soul. They should be your safest place to be yourself. Life is hard enough. That person should be your solace.
@4UnitedWeStand I AGREE.  However, you read it incorrectly, even if you had good intentions, if the perception was read wrong, it won't matter.
@shellytheoracle I think you misunderstood my post.  Again, misinterpretation and "wrong perception, you see what I mean.  		Regardless of your intentions some people will take it the wrong way on how they perceive you or your intention.  Hope that helps you understand what I was trying to say.
Don't be afraid of losing people. Be afraid of losing yourself by trying to please everyone around you.

She's standing on a line between giving up and seeing how much more time she can take.
Your opinion is your opinion, your perception is your perception. Do not confuse them with facts or truths.
People may not tell you how they feel about you, but they will always show you.  Pay attention.
Your intentions don't matter.  Perception is reality.  If people perceive you the wrong way, it doesn't matter what your intentions are.

@brainwise Yes, how wonderful it is to learn.
My mind wanders and I get lost in thoughts of you...
They don't want to talk about it.  I believe it's because, it just wasn't meant to be.  If it was we wouldn't be wondering "what just happened".  Sometimes you just need to accept the fact that you won't get closure and you won't get an explanation because 'it was never real". https://t.co/SGlYyPZ1km

He doesn't love you. He doesn't miss you.  He's happy without you and busy living his life while you're stuck wondering where things went wrong. Stop trying to find closure with someone that obviously doesn't care to give it to you.
When he's the right man for you, you'll never have to wonder where you stand because he'll make it clear every chance he gets that, no matter where he is or what he's doing, your place is always right by his side.

There's no falling "in" or "out" of it.  When you truly Love, it never dies.  Love is eternal, it's sacred, it's a way of life.. not some temporary feeling that loses its truth over time.  People only fall "out" of Love, when they never truly Loved to begin with.
