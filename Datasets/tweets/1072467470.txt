6/ So my question to the Environmental Protection agency is... if you're not going to protect the environment and human health.... https://t.co/mQX8xWcHMZ
5/If the EPA has decided to protect polluters instead of human health, it’s up to Congress to pass legislation to force them to do the right thing.
4/ If the EPA won't do its job, Congress needs to take action. People in Newburgh were put in danger when their drinking water was contaminated with PFOS – we can’t let the EPA get away with turning their backs on us. 	https://t.co/qb98lXdulo
3/ Now, the EPA is reportedly finishing up a plan which would refrain from regulating PFOS/PFOA at all - even though we've seen studies on studies proving the chemicals can cause some cancers, hypertension, other problems. https://t.co/ankvdemaO3
2/ Last year, Trump Administration tried to bury its OWN report on the health effects of drinking these chemicals. They were concerned it would be a "public relations nightmare." We demanded they release the report and they ultimately did. 	https://t.co/s6YViGWeDR
1/ A few years back, we found out the drinking water in Newburgh was contaminated w/dangerous chemicals (PFOS/PFOA) and have been working towards total remediation ever since.  Replacement water source is in place - but blood levels of folks in town are higher than nat'l average.

Now that the lights are back on, we can have a serious conversation about additional border security. I am hopeful that we can come to a bipartisan agreement on what having a “secure border” means and how we can achieve that worthwhile goal.
Of course I am happy that government employees will get paid and that this particular chaos has ended for now, but this is the exact same "deal" the President rejected five weeks ago. His pointless shutdown did nothing but hurt people and weaken our country.
So let’s see: yesterday Senate voted no on what Trump now says is okay. Originally they said okay on same thing but Trump said it wasn’t okay, but now ...🤦‍♂️

The #ACA has helped millions of Americans get covered. It protects folks with pre-existing conditions. And it ensures that everyone – no matter who you are or how much you make – has access to quality health care. I will fight back against any effort to dismantle it.
Your health care is on the line – and I will fight tooth and nail to protect it. https://t.co/zSDW1HaP1j

The #2018FarmBill is a HUGE WIN for #HudsonValley farms. It protects crop insurance, invests in new farmers, protects #SNAP, and secures key investments for dairy farmers – I’m proud to support it.
Earlier this year, Republicans on the Ag Committee tried to steamroll over #FarmBill programs that help vulnerable Americans heat their homes – I led the fight to shut those efforts down. Watch here: https://t.co/AK8Mm0QJDI

@donnijean @connorobrienNH This is one of the wonky parts of Congress. The rule that passed last night is just that – a rule. It's not part of the #2018FarmBill - just allows it to come to the floor.
2/2 I’m proud the bill includes several provisions of mine to support our local farms, boost opportunities for young and beginning farmers and protect crop insurance – I will be proud to support the final bill.
1/2 The #2018FarmBill is strong, bipartisan legislation that will maintain the progress we’ve made for #HudsonValley farmers and even make key improvements.  https://t.co/jb4QbhSqL9

1/2 #ICYMI: The president thought you’d be too busy after Thanksgiving to notice the explosive report he released on #climatechange. This is the most comprehensive study to date, was conducted by a dozen federal agencies, and was released by a #GOP Administration.

3/ We pray for his entire family and hold them in our thoughts. We pray too for our country; that we will learn from his example and set a higher standard once again for our politics. https://t.co/me1iYKdfhf
2/ His life sets the standard for the character and patriotism essential to true public service. As we remember him, we take comfort in knowing that he has been reunited with his beloved wife Barbara and is free now from all sickness and pain in the loving arms of our Lord.
1/ Like many in his generation, George H.W. Bush embodied such decency that even politics and ambition could not overcome it. He was a good man. He loved his family and his country and worked to keep both safe and sound.
Look,  we’re hearing a ton of spin on this. Here’s the bottom line: this is a serious issue and it warrants serious action. Mr. Manafort lied to Congress – and we need to know why. I’m monitoring this situation closely. https://t.co/UAQ06mG5TN

2/2 I don't buy it and neither should you. Americans who love their country &amp; are qualified to serve should be able to do so without discrimination. https://t.co/QbUaSU9ec2

Hate has no home in Cold Spring &amp; the light of good people coming together will expose it. We will find the individual who did this &amp; they will be brought to swift justice. If you have information about this crime, please contact the sheriff’s department. https://t.co/URbm4aEzT7
Proud to award Mr. Paul DeRogitas Jr. with a #PurpleHeart yesterday! Paul served honorably in Vietnam and risked life and limb for his country. This is the least we can do in return. https://t.co/NYam0gZIqX
This is despicable — &amp; it speaks to the larger, anti-Semitic attacks we’ve seen recently. Our community is better than this &amp; we won’t stand for discrimination in the HV. If you have any information about this crime, please contact the sheriff’s department https://t.co/x97kbgoifH
WATCH: footage from a #PurpleHeart ceremony earlier this afternoon! Proud to award Mr. Paul DeRogitas Jr. of Washingtonville with this prestigious honor that he sacrificed so much to earn. Congratulations, Paul, and thanks for your service. https://t.co/Pj4euiIdQa
Honored to award Mr. Paul DeRogatis Jr. with a #PurpleHeart today. Paul was drafted in 1968 &amp; — like millions of other men his age — he answered the call, shipped off to Vietnam &amp; sacrificed so much for our country. I’m proud to represent him &amp; thousands of other HV vets. https://t.co/8OaPotjVOv

3/ We will find the person or persons who did this, and they will be brought to swift justice. If you have any information about this crime, please contact the sheriff’s department or your local law enforcement agency. The sooner this criminal is caught, the better.
2/ This took place within eyesight of my kids’ school, where good people from all walks of life bring our kids to learn tolerance and respect. Hate has no home in Cold Spring, and the light of good people coming together will expose it.
1/ Cold Spring is our home &amp; we won’t let the hateful actions of cowards intimidate our friends, our kids, or our community. Especially after last week’s shooting, we owe it to each other to stand together against this kind of bigotry &amp; anti-Semitism https://t.co/4Tlaom7NRi
One of the things I’m proudest of is when the HV came together &amp;  killed the Coast Guard’s proposal to turn our river into a parking lot for oil ships. That was a major win for all of us &amp; we can’t let up. We’ve got to stay on top of this &amp; protect our river from future harm. https://t.co/zaIc1WzQiY
2/2 A monumental bill that passed into law this year and that supports just about every approach under the sun for tackling this crisis. https://t.co/rfQ57uJcuR
1/2 Thanks to @CornerstoneFH, @RECAPOC and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council of Orange County for joining me today to talk about the #opioidepidemic and my legislation, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act —
All of us have an obligation to come together and say enough is enough. Our country is better than this - and we must start acting like it. https://t.co/mZMdFsCeZ6
Folks across the country are able to get their hands on dangerous drugs online. My bill - the Stop Online Opioid Sales Act - would help fix that. This is the biggest public health emergency of our lifetimes. We must be working full-steam ahead toward solutions. https://t.co/OKLzGgJjCF
#PSA: Get your flu shot! Just got mine and took a tour of @HRHCare in #Poughkeepsie! We need to make sure that community health centers continue to get the support they need. https://t.co/tinNQHOH0Y
I'm a proud cosponsor of the No Budget, No Pay Act because members of Congress have been allowed to play by their own rules for too long. https://t.co/cVYVvy30Os
I visited Temple Beth Jacob in Newburgh this morning for a prayer service for those killed in yesterday’s tragic shooting in Pittsburgh. We have to stand together against anti-Semitism. Everyone should be able to practice their religion freely and without the threat of violence. https://t.co/0lNkEwXnrC
Planned Parenthood provides tons of critical services to thousands of folks in the HV every year. And right now, extremists in Washington are working to dismantle that care. We can’t let that happen. I stand with Planned Parenthood &amp; I’m proud to go to bat for them in Congress. https://t.co/GAOLw8MYFt
This is terrible - people should be able to worship in peace w/o becoming targets of violence. My heart is with the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh and the two officers who were injured while protecting the innocent. This gun violence has to end. https://t.co/SKenVcHnkc
Are you a vet or do know a vet that’s having trouble securing their service medals? Give my office in Newburgh a call - we’ll help you get it sorted out. We’ve already helped literally hundreds of Hudson Valley vets already. https://t.co/VgjpV3BupX
The #FarmBill was a mess - and because of that it stalled in Congress. #HudsonValley farmers count on this bill to support key programs that keep their businesses afloat. Congress needs to get in the game on this. https://t.co/cxwUuseOx3
One homeless veteran is one too many. Congress must take action on my bill that would rehab "zombie" homes and turn them into housing for our vets. It's a commonsense, bipartisan bill and I'll continue fighting to get it passed. https://t.co/v0K5NuLJY6
No community is immune from the #opioidepidemic. We need a comprehensive approach to attack this problem head-on. I’ve fought to pass bills in Congress to that end. Here are my next steps: https://t.co/6Uu2RoHvrx
This year’s #FarmBill was a mess and - because of that - it stalled in Congress. Now programs critical to HV farmers are in limbo. That’s insane. Congress needs to get it together &amp; pass this bill. Proud to join the @YoungFarmers at Soons Orchard this morning to talk next steps. https://t.co/dMNN4rHuGf
#ICYMI: The HV came together &amp; killed the Coast Guard’s proposal to turn our beautiful river into a parking lot for oil ships. This was a major win for our community - but we can’t lose focus.  We’ve got to stay vigilant &amp; protect our river from future harm. https://t.co/H4vPisb6lX
It’s #DownSyndromeAwarenessMonth! This month is dedicated to spreading awareness about #downsyndrome. We’ve got to keep fighting for inclusion for everyone - and I’m proud to work in Congress to get that done. https://t.co/UQ5Cy1KIpq
I’m the son of a U.S. Navy vet, so ensuring we keep our promises to   service members is a top priority for me. I won’t stop fighting for our men and women in uniform. They served our country with honor - helping them should be a no-brainer. https://t.co/Tpj0qh47Pv
I get tons of comments, calls, and emails from seniors concerned about their benefits being reduced or eliminated. I won’t be voting for any garbage bill that would rip money away from our seniors by gutting #SocialSecurity or Medicare. https://t.co/JHtyAvOFz4
$1.5 trillion. That’s how much 44 million Americans owe in student debt. That’s insane. Enough with the skyrocketing tuition &amp; the unaffordable interest rates. I’m a co-sponsor of the All-Year ACCESS Act, which would make it easier for college students to afford their education. https://t.co/9AKLBxas6t
This is hateful, it’s wrong, and I won’t stand for it. #Transgender Americans deserve respect like anyone else - you can’t just write them out of existence. https://t.co/WPg4PnjUhE
Do you live with one of the conditions listed below? Bad news: Republicans are working to dismantle protections for folks who need them most. We can’t let that happen. We must strengthen the #AffordableCareAct, not rip it apart. https://t.co/3PJSIViO5E
Transition out of the military can be hard for some vets. It's our responsibility to ensure they get access to the services they earned. My bill would make it easier for Veterans Services Officers to connect w/ new vets &amp; smooth the transition - &amp; it passed the House this summer. https://t.co/yCCc4hr0VY
#Climatechange is no joke. The latest reports show that we will start seeing its extreme effects as soon as 20 years from now. This is not some far-off problem. It’s real. And it’s headed our way. We need to get in the game and get some solutions to combat it. Fast. https://t.co/JbpeL6ngR0
I’m not embarrassed to admit it:  my daughters will tell you that our ducks, dogs, sheep &amp; goat are as much a part of our family as I am. I’m a proud recipient of the Humane Society’s Humane Advocate Award &amp; I’ll keep advancing legislation that protects animals from abuse. https://t.co/d4fbuoSXtf
The Hudson is America’s river. We have to preserve it for our kids  - &amp; that means making sure the water remains safe to drink. We fought &amp; killed the anchorages proposal in its crib, but we can't let up. We must continue fighting to protect our river for the next generation. https://t.co/plZ65yIIhv
Our veterans fought for our country - they shouldn't have to fight their government for the benefits they worked hard to earn. Proud to have helped more than 1,700 Hudson Valley veterans get access to their benefits. https://t.co/SkQcZl6Pgg
40,000: That’s the estimated number of homeless vets. These men &amp; women risked their lives to defend our freedoms – they shouldn’t be living on the street. I was proud to introduce the Housing Our Heroes Act to renovate “zombie homes” &amp; turn them into housing for homeless vets. https://t.co/2QZDWRGcet
2/2 Those statistics are a reminder that we have to remain vigilant and recognize the signs of #PTSD. If you or someone you know is struggling, call 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/fO8ONuVGGO
1/2 According to the VA, up to 20% of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans, up to 10% of Gulf War veterans, and up to 30% of Vietnam War veterans have experienced #PTSD.
My dogs, sheep, goats, and ducks are part of the family – I can’t understand how anyone could hurt a defenseless animal. I’m a proud co-sponsor of the Humane Cosmetics Act to stop cruel and unnecessary testing on animals. https://t.co/21HUjJGi4X
Clean water is a basic right for all Americans regardless of where they live, how much money they have in their bank account, or the color of their skin. On the anniversary of the Clean Water Act, we have to recommit to fighting to make sure everyone has access to clean water. https://t.co/qntHJAvnRY
.@HouseGOP skipped town for 6 weeks without voting on key legislation - like the #FarmBill. This bill funds key crop programs for HV farms and protects farmers nationwide. I’ve been fighting tooth &amp; nail for our farmers. They make the food we eat - we’ve got to protect them. https://t.co/S9MSL28Oyl
It’s #DomesticViolenceAwarenessMonth. And it’s a reminder that too many women &amp; men are forced to suffer in silence. We need to change that. If you're struggling, or you know someone that is, please know that help is only one call away. 		Domestic Violence Hotline: 1-800-799-7233 https://t.co/DWiSMFDhp8
#Healthcare is one of the most pressing issues facing our country right now — and real people are counting on Congress to protect it. https://t.co/W1Xra3deTx
Joining @SRuhle on @MSNBC this AM to discuss health care and foreign policy. Tune in!
I’ve received more letters &amp; phone calls about #NetNeutrality than any other issue over the past Congress - people in the HV won’t stand for the @FCC’s rollback of these key internet protections &amp; neither will I. I’m fighting to reverse the rollback and protect our open internet. https://t.co/Z2jxIXx0TP
20 Republican-led states have filed a lawsuit which would get rid of protections for pre-existing conditions. If they win, millions of Americans with medical conditions could lose their insurance. We can’t let that happen - I’ll always fight to protect health care access. https://t.co/Mll4xSC048
Opioid and heroin addiction is a serious issue - and it's tearing families apart. If you, or someone you know, is struggling with addiction I want you to know that you’re not alone. There is always help available. Check out these resources I compiled. https://t.co/Nik7jsekPv
Proud to stand with the Brewster/Carmel Garden Club this morning to dedicate a new blue star marker in honor of all members of the Armed Services. Thank you to all who serve, who have served, and who will serve. https://t.co/7U4TiDvLDD
It’s #FarmersDay! Proud to be working to protect HV farms &amp; ensure they’ve got the tools to succeed. I’m on @HouseAgDems – where I push for support, opportunity &amp; the expansion of key programs like crop insurance. Farmers make the food we eat. Helping them should be a no-brainer. https://t.co/bQxcAQh42b
2/2 who were there to lob more attacks on Matthew and his family. There’s a lot of hate going on in our country right now, but I want to be clear to the #LGBTQ community, and especially LGBTQ youth: you are not alone. And it does get better. https://t.co/Y76xbS2hvZ
1/2 Today is the 20th anniversary of #MatthewShepard’s death – a kid who lost his life after being savagely beaten just because he was gay. I went to Matthew’s funeral and I remember clearly the kids in angel costumes barricading themselves against the protesters ...
2/ We’ve got almost 100 dams that could cause loss of life or huge economic damages if they break – this is stuff we have to take seriously, and my legislation will make sure we do.
1/ #BREAKING: my bill to protect the HV from serious flooding &amp; property damage will be signed into law. With all of the intense hurricanes we're seeing, we need to be doing everything we can to protect our people &amp; businesses from potential flooding. https://t.co/o39lbbjkI1
2/2 That’s exactly what this federal investment will help do – proud to bring it home for the #HudsonValley. https://t.co/LaldV9BvjA
1/2 Talk to anybody and they’ll tell you the same thing – families are losing their kids because of addiction to opioids, and it has to stop. The best way to do that is to get the smartest, best-equipped people to put their heads together &amp; get the answers and solutions we need.
It’s #ComingOutDay! Proud to be NY’s first openly-gay Congressman &amp; to be fighting for #LGBTQ ppl in DC. There’s a lot on the line for LGBTQ folks. The #TrumpAdministration is rolling back our rights – but we can’t let hate win. Today, we recommit to fighting for equality.
.@fema wasted millions of dollars &amp; failed to get essential supplies to Americans in #PuertoRico who needed help after #HurricaneMaria. I just got a bill passed into law that will find out why this process was bungled &amp; how these failed contracts were made https://t.co/Voi3nYrL88
2/2 I always fight to protect that funding because I’ve seen its impact at home in the #HudsonValley, especially in Poughkeepsie. Proud to announce this major investment for our community. https://t.co/Bo96nT0LJy
1/2 You look at the revitalization on Main Street, new low-income housing options &amp; the renovation of parks &amp; infrastructure — a lot of these projects are tied to @HUDgov funding. And they’ve proven to be effective at boosting the quality of life &amp; generating economic activity.
2/2 This is an all-hands-on-deck moment, and we the need anti-science, climate-change denying conservatives in Washington to get in the game. https://t.co/zWeWWRSwul
1/2 #Climatechange is a serious threat – but don’t take my word for it. The latest report from the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change describes dire food shortages and wildfires, and a massive die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040.
Kids as young as 2 are being dragged into kangaroo courts at our nation’s border &amp; being treated like criminals. Our country is better than this. This profile by @nytimes was tough to read – but it’s a wake up call. We must keep fighting for what's right. https://t.co/fIJ9RokbX4
Fall is a beautiful time of year in our nation’s capital! If you’re planning on making the hike down to D.C., give my Washington office a call. We can help get you set up with a Capitol tour. https://t.co/kZquoTjaWG

Getting the runaround from the feds and need some answers? Give my office in Newburgh a call. We’re here to help you cut through red tape – and we’ve helped literally thousands of your neighbors do so already. https://t.co/mhoysaG2D5
4/ I’m disappointed that the Senate has gone forward with the confirmation of a partisan nominee who’s been credibly accused of sexual assault, and I believe we will have to deal with the fallout of this decision for years to come.
3/ In addition to those issues, we risk swinging the court away from the reasonable and deliberate decisions of Justice Kennedy and toward partisan extremism. Women’s rights, #LGBTQ rights, #affirmativeaction, voting rights, and more are all on the line.
2/ Mr. Kavanaugh’s conduct during the hearing regarding the accusations are also concerning – Supreme Court Justices should be impartial and above political influence. Mr. Kavanaugh has demonstrated that he will be neither.
1/ Regardless of where you come down on #BrettKavanaugh’s judicial opinions, the claims made against this nominee by several women, including #DrChristineBlaseyFord, are credible and cause for concern.
#BREAKING: my bill to update medical kits on planes to include resources for kids PASSED into law! Millions of Americans fly every year, and a ton of them are kids. My legislation will ensure that kids  have the supplies they need if they have a health issue while on a flight.
Had a great time at the Thayer Award Ceremony last night at @WestPoint_USMA. The award this year went to Leon Panetta, former Sec of Defense &amp; CIA Director. Mr. Panetta is a real statesman &amp; this award symbolizes his outstanding character, accomplishments &amp; duty to his country. https://t.co/I7Hc2KJiaY
2/2 We’ve got to identify possible threats at school &amp; stop shootings before they happen. Proud to announce this investment to the Valley Central School District to combat school violence. https://t.co/JV6tlhcKHG
1/2 The sad reality is that school violence is still a huge problem and –  like a lot of parents – I worry about it when I put my girls on the school bus every day.
Women’s #ReproRights are under attack by extreme Washington Republicans. I stand w/ @PPFA &amp; I’m proud to be fighting in Congress to protect the #righttochoose as well as funding for #PlannedParenthood that provides necessary health care services to tons of people in the HV. https://t.co/MttdiVPymT
2/2 More than 1 in 4 Americans experience one of these health concerns. If the #GOP succeeds in destroying these protections, people with pre-existing conditions could be denied insurance. https://t.co/hlvEsKcwTN
1/2 Congressional Republicans couldn't get their terrible Obamacare repeal bill passed, so now they're resorting to a lawsuit that would get rid of protections for #preexistingconditions.
You worked hard your entire life, saved up, and are now counting on your hard-earned benefits. Washington Republicans are considering slashing and burning #SocialSecurity and #Medicare to pay for more massive tax cuts for the rich. We can’t let that happen. I’m fighting back. https://t.co/6m415IKmpJ
This is disgusting. https://t.co/DQGtHdRdiY
Explosive new report from the @nytimes. We’re going to hear a ton of partisan spin on this the next few days. Bottom line: it looks like the president &amp; his family defrauded the IRS &amp; lied to the American people. https://t.co/hwVjbOHGFN
October is #DomesticViolenceAwarenessMonth &amp; it’s a somber reminder that 1 in 3 women &amp; 1 in 4 men have experienced #domesticviolence in their lifetimes.

Another day another petty attack on #LGBTQ people by the #TrumpAdministration. There’s no good reason for this move.	https://t.co/0FujMMTi76
2/ Now, Trump wants to stop CA from protecting basic internet principles that prevent big companies from slowing down or blocking websites. We need our federal Net Neutrality protections back on the books. I’m still fighting to make sure we get them. https://t.co/uDndkajxYK
1/ After the #TrumpAdministration gutted our internet protections, a few states including CA took action to protect their people from being cheated by big internet providers.
We have seen unprecedented corruption in Washington the last couple years. It's more important than ever that Bob Mueller is allowed to do his job — without partisan interference. https://t.co/PBK6wnYTQ3
The Hudson Valley is better than this. Thanks to Mayor DeStefano for calling out this trash for what it is - cowardly. Wonder if the president would call these white supremacists "very fine people." https://t.co/Zxtot3EY8S
Washington Republicans are doubling down on their tax cuts for the super rich. How do they plan to pay for these cuts? Well, the administration wants to cut people’s earned benefits like Medicare and Social Security. https://t.co/nRhpIAJBtE
Huge win for people who don’t believe in science. Huge loss for our kids, climate, and the environment. We have to stop this insanity. https://t.co/sFf0CvBcGw
Instead of focusing their attention on things that are good for America, like protecting farmers, the #gop rammed through more tax cuts for the rich. Now, they’re skipping out of town for a month &amp; HV farmers in are left in limbo. Congress must do better. https://t.co/70tZmck5AF
#DrChristineBlaseyFord showed real courage yesterday. Like so much of the country, I’m watching today’s proceedings closely. https://t.co/Ei6OsEuUH6
Thank you, #DrChristineBlaseyFord, for your courage today. https://t.co/7mqPfPM5vq
3/ If you are a survivor of sexual assault please remember: you are not alone. There is always help available.		National Sexual Assault hotline: 1-800-656-4673
2/ Her story speaks to the stories of millions of women &amp; men forced to endure the lasting effects of sexual violence &amp; harassment. And her bravery today will never be forgotten. 		No one, no one, should have to suffer the effects of #sexualharassment &amp; violence in silence.
1/ What #DrChristineBlaseyFord is doing today is remarkable. And it takes a great deal of courage. I want to thank her for coming forward, risking everything, and talking about her attack — especially under such extreme public scrutiny.
2/ Republicans are trying to jam through this nomination without giving all the brave women who came forward a chance to make their voices heard. Today’s hearing is an important first step, but it’s not enough. https://t.co/qxlzDYrQjO
1/ #Kavanaugh has been accused of assaulting several women – regardless of where you stand on his judicial opinions, we need to take a step back and get to the bottom of these allegations before any vote is taken.
Good news for our part of the world! Proud to support the small business owners in the Hudson Valley who are working hard creating good-paying jobs, sparking innovation, and driving economic growth in our region. https://t.co/K1yvmwdCH1
#BrettKavanaugh is an alleged assaulter and an extremist. He doesn’t belong on the Supreme Court. https://t.co/5ty2VLu4At
Indictments. Investigations. Resignations. The culture of corruption in D.C. is terrible. We need to clean this town up so the American people can have the transparent government they deserve. I’m a proud supporter of initiatives to make D.C. more accountable. https://t.co/nalkL9SpxJ

It’s #NationalRailSafetyWeek. Tons of people in our part of the world rely on @MetroNorth and other railroads to get around and get to work. I fought to pass legislation to make trains safer, but we still need important upgrades like Positive Train Control (PTC). https://t.co/bQlmHcDS3a
It’s #NationalVoterRegistrationDay! I encourage all of my friends and neighbors in the #HudsonValley to register to vote and make their voice heard this November. More info here: https://t.co/HiFL62yaDY https://t.co/nIxb0LQNtj
The future of our internet is at stake in the fight against the FCC's repeal of #NetNeutrality. I’m fighting to save net neutrality in Congress because I think we should keep our internet the way it’s been for years: open &amp; full of innovation. https://t.co/onDtkkvqKb
40,000. That’s how many American vets are homeless right now. That’s nuts – no one who served should have to worry about finding a safe place to live when they get home. I’ll keep working to pass legislation that gets them off the streets &amp;  into affordable housing. https://t.co/itcjTa3Y0y
People struggling w/ opioid addiction can get a lot of drugs very quickly online. We need a plan to fight this epidemic — but we don’t have all the info we need. That’s got to change &amp; it’s why I wrote the Stop Online Opioid Sales Act &amp; fought to get it passed through the House. https://t.co/xBlgR0tI3F
Don’t get tangled up in red tape – if you need help with a federal agency, give my office in Newburgh a call. We’re here to help. https://t.co/fFE7WXXSkR

Bob #Mueller has been working hard and – already – he’s got a record of success. This issue is too serious to become political theater. Congress must protect Mueller’s job and his investigation. https://t.co/ovadp57Fxv
The #GOP needs a way to pay for their massive tax cuts for the richest Americans. And the way they’re hinting at doing so? Coming after #SocialSecurity and #Medicare. I will fight like hell to protect people's hard-earned retirement security. https://t.co/VuGrjNt0Yx
We’ve seen indictments, investigations, resignations over past 2 yrs in DC – there’s a culture of corruption here that’s only gotten worse. We need to clean this town up so the American people have government they deserve. Have to make government more accountable &amp; transparent. https://t.co/Ois6DRfa32
Today is #POWMIARecognitionDay – and it’s a reminder of the sacrifice that so many service members have made – including those who were never recovered. https://t.co/5HVsGjP0jr
2/ Especially now, when transgender service members are under attack, we have to stand up and speak out for everyone who wears the uniform – regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
1/ Today marks the 7th anniversary of the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” That antiquated policy prevented #LGBTQ people in our military from serving openly. https://t.co/HCbM0v2RQJ
Repealing #NetNeutrality makes it harder for small businesses to compete online. Slower and extra fees are bad news for innovators relying on the internet to reach customers. I’m fighting in Congress to restore #NetNeutrality.
2/ I was on-the-ground days after the hurricane hit and I can tell you first-hand that relief efforts there were not – as #POTUS says – an “unsung success.” Puerto Ricans are American citizens – they need our continued support as they rebuild. https://t.co/mDnV1nBEey
1/ It’s been one year since #HurricaneMaria hit #PuertoRico and #USVI, killing thousands &amp; leaving millions of Americans without reliable power, medical equipment, housing, and food.
It’s not fair to blow up the deficit by slashing taxes on the richest of the rich and then turn around and cut #SocialSecurity and #Medicare. I’ll keep fighting in D.C. to protect your retirement security – you earned it. 	https://t.co/JWwjlH63Id
#POTUS &amp; his anti-environment buddies in Washington are trying to open up our waters &amp; expand oil drilling across the country – including in NY. We can’t let that happen – our waterways are key parts of our ecosystems &amp; drivers of our local economy. I’m fighting back in Congress. https://t.co/rgNpW4VHJt
Shotspotter tech is an important tool that helps law enforcement detect gunshots &amp; catch criminals - and it’s working in the HV. I was proud to work alongside the City of Newburgh &amp; the DOJ to get this tech deployed to make our streets safer. https://t.co/nGRTzxyVT8
Proud of the brave men and women of the New York National Guard who are lending a hand to folks recovering from #HurricaneFlorence. More here – https://t.co/mKT2Dbmru3

If you work a full-time job, shouldn't have to worry about making ends meet. The price of everything we buy is going up all the time, but wages have not been able to keep up. We need to reprioritize the needs of working people to restore middle class. 	https://t.co/RUh08zK5Sm

Randy and I will pray for Senator McCain and his family and ask the Hudson Valley to join us in keeping them all in our thoughts.
He was a tough, thoughtful, principled patriot who spent his entire life serving others. Especially in times of division, our nation hurts for leaders like Senator McCain. John knew that Americans do best when we work across all of our lines of difference towards a common good.
From his heroic actions during the Vietnam War - to his tenure as a respected member of the United States Congress, John McCain personified all of the best characteristics of what it is to be an American and a good representative of the people.
John McCain will be remembered as one of the most committed public servants in American history.

3/3 Democrats got rolled on Merrick Garland because Senate Republicans refused to do their job and we let them get away with it. We ended up paying for it on the bench. We can’t make that mistake again – there’s too much on the line. https://t.co/0M26gV5Oxl
2/3 if Mueller brings a case. It sounds like the answer is yes, and if it is, the Senate must reject this confirmation. All Senate Democrats should oppose #BrettKavanaugh’s nomination.
1/3 We've been fighting for years to protect a woman’s #righttochoose, #LGBTQ rights, affordable health care, the right to vote and more. The Senate must demand a straight answer from Mr. #Kavanaugh on whether he’ll roll these protections back and whether he’ll let Trump slide..
It’s “go time”.  We need to #stopkavanaugh now. No Democrat can vote for this. No exceptions.
Been fighting for decades to protect a woman’s right to choose, LGBTQ rights, affirmative action, &amp; right to vote. Will Trump's nominee roll that back &amp; let Trump slide if Mueller brings a case? Senate should ask that question &amp; if answer is yes reject nomination. #StopKavanaugh
I’m glad the Newburgh City Council is taking steps to save these 3 jobs, but there are still 9 more firefighters that will lose their jobs at the end of the month. I’ll continue fighting to make sure the @Local589 has the staff they need to keep us safe. https://t.co/TUZgnwfNac
Trooper Clark’s death is just one example of the danger that our law enforcement officers put themselves in to protect people every single day. He deserved a heroes burial — I’m glad he got it. https://t.co/8EsNfCqWuR

Our service men and women sacrificed their lives to protect our freedoms – but too often that service comes with a price. If you – or a vet you know – are struggling, don’t be afraid to reach out. There are people here to help. You are not alone. https://t.co/ruvaK8MHmV
This is the same Jim Jordan who as a Congressman has self-righteously demanded investigations of anything and everything under the sun. Well,  times’s up, Jim. We need to hear these victims and investigate Jim Jordan now.
Boys in his care were being sexually abused and Jim Jordan stands credibly accused of knowing it and doing nothing. That’s goddamned crazy.

UPDATE: earlier this wk, my office got an email saying that we couldn't use our funds to buy tampons (even though we have female constituents and staff). When we called out the committee that makes the rules, they denied the rule exists in the first place. They're full of it. https://t.co/IyZ8aHf0dY
This bill was not a compromise. It still holds #DREAMers hostage, slashes legal immigration, and limits access to asylum for innocent people fleeing persecution – all while throwing billions of dollars down the drain for Trump’s border wall. I voted no. https://t.co/0BiMuffm0V
This decision is a major blow to workers and families. Especially in New York State. Public service workers need the strength of unions to rally for their rights and fight back against attacks on fair benefits and working conditions. https://t.co/VHcDLXUsQc

2/ This is something we need to be taking seriously and we have to make responsible investments in the Dam Safety Program to do that. I’m pushing in Congress to make that happen. https://t.co/LVcSIU2mT1
1/ People don’t realize how important dam safety is until one fails and destroys the surrounding communities, floods farmlands and people lose their lives. Right here in the #HudsonValley we saw dams at real risk of failure during recent storms.
June is #PTSDAwarenessMonth. Our vets &amp; service members  sacrificed to protect our country. Now, it's our turn to pay attention,  recognize the signs of PTSD &amp; TBI &amp; offer help. If you - or a vet you know - are struggling with one of these unseen illness, call 1-800-273-8255. https://t.co/UbzqEnmIFz
From my family to yours: happy #PrideMonth! https://t.co/YHX7DBZrod
In DECEMBER, Puerto Rico Governor @PRrossello asked @fema for housing assistance after #HurricaneMaria – 5 months later they finally got back to him and denied the request. I wrote to FEMA’s leadership last week to demand they reconsider this decision. https://t.co/d5Jz6NSsIP
Today is the last day of #MilitaryAppreciationMonth – but if you’re asking me one month just isn’t enough. To everyone who wears the uniform: thank you for your service to our country. I’m proud to represent more than 40,000 HV vets and work hard to support them in Congress. https://t.co/uf2xGqqaF1
Our community is still getting back up on its feet following the storms we saw a few weeks back. I’m leading the effort in Congress to unlock the federal funds needed for this rebuilding. https://t.co/8yb9v3Kl0h
During #MilitaryAppreciationMonth, we should all remember to thank those who are serving. I’m proud to be doing my part in Washington to make sure the people who serve to keep us safe get the benefits they’ve earned when they get back. https://t.co/XlDf4gequZ

#Climatechange is a big problem – and it’s going to take a big idea to solve it. America has always been a leader in coming up with big ideas – we went to the moon, we invented flight &amp; mass production. We can’t give up on solving this problem because it’s a hard one. https://t.co/ARbT0HzhGx

#GreatNews: my “Know Your Vets” bill passed the House yesterday. It will allow county-level vets organizations to learn when local vets return home &amp; about their service so counties can pro-actively contact them &amp; assist with re-entry into civilian life. https://t.co/jBGmJw71Fu

1/ I don’t give a damn about the @EPA administrator’s public relations concerns here, I’ve got people at home wondering whether they need to be worried about the #PFOS in their blood. https://t.co/1Ou8PhXZwd
2/ I’m proud to announce that bipartisan legislation I introduced with @RepGallagher to bridge that gap just passed through the House of Representatives. https://t.co/7XPdGA95hJ
1/ If you’re active duty and you’re dealing with #PTSD or substance abuse, you’ve got resources through the @DeptofDefense to help you – and you’ve also got resources at the @DeptVetAffairs when you transition out of the military – but there’s a gap between the two.
2/ I’m disappointed we’re back to square one. We’ve got to keep working toward a real solution for full denuclearization.
1/ I know a lot of folks will cheer this news, but it’s not just #POTUS that loses – we all do. This meeting was a real opportunity for peace on the Korean Peninsula &amp; the region. https://t.co/MhJLk6keJV

#ICYMI: I made a final attempt to fix the partisan #FarmBill that failed in the House last week.

The fact is that there are 40,000 vets on the streets right now. One homeless vet is one too many.

4/ If we scrap the deal, abandon our @NATO allies &amp; the Iranians start racing toward a #nuclearweapon, we could easily find ourselves in another ground war in the #MiddleEast. I’d feel better if I knew what #POTUS' plan was for that scenario. I don’t think he’s thought about it.
3/ Sure, the #IranDeal is not perfect – I’ve said that since it was brokered – but you don’t have to end the deal to strengthen it.
2/ All the evidence we have indicates that it has. And the proof’s in the pudding – three years ago they were mere months away from having a #nuclearweapon and today they have no nuclear weapons capacity.
1/ #Iran is a real danger to the U.S. and to the region and we must never let them get their hands on nuclear weapons. My only priority when looking at this deal is whether or not it keeps America and our allies safe from a nuclear-armed Iran. https://t.co/oY7zbhDxvr

4/ Because of his decency and warmth, we became true friends and partners in serving our neighbors. I’ll always be proud of that partnership. Senator Larkin has made an impact on every community he represents and his legacy will last for a century.
3/ Senator Larkin is a noble statesman and a happy warrior. “Public servants like Bill Larkin shine brightly and light the way for cooperation and friendship even in an era when those essential values are vanishing.
2/ Bill Larkin is one of the most honorable people I’ve ever met. He’s dedicated his entire adult life to the service of others – from the tropical islands of the South Pacific and snow-capped mountains of Korea – to the halls of the state capitol in Albany.
My statement on retirement of Senator Bill Larkin: 		1/ If you’re truly lucky, in the course of a public career you meet a few precious people who make the journey more joyful, more fun. Sometimes they are not a member of your own generation or even in your own political party.

#Transgender troops have served in some of our most elite units, graduated from our premier military academies, and sacrificed their lives for our nation. They do the job like everyone else - they should be allowed to serve.

It’s #NationalPuppyDay! My daughters will tell you that our ducks, dogs, sheep &amp; goat are as much a part of our family as I am.

Proud new owner of a Newburgh Fire Department bumper sticker! I'm working to prevent coming layoffs. We've done it before &amp; we can do it again. These men &amp; women risk life and limb for us &amp; we have to make sure they’ve got the personnel &amp; resources they need to get the job done. https://t.co/7VFbADX6Od
If I know the Coast Guard is thinking of proposing more anchorages in advance, it will be easier to rally opposition – we killed the first proposal in the crib – and this will give us an ever better chance of doing that again.
If the @uscg wants to go rogue and make a unilateral decision that ignores their own PAWSA report, they’ll have to come explain that to Congress before they even make the proposal.
GOOD NEWS: I successfully fought to include a provision in today’s must-pass spending bill that would slow down potential future anchorage proposals. https://t.co/X2wAGumrjg
It’s #WDSD18 - a day dedicated to spreading awareness about #DownSyndrome. We’ve got to keep fighting for inclusion for everyone - and I’m proud to work in Congress to get that done. https://t.co/cbMHEoznUU
#POTUS should stop playing political games and start working with us to invest in America.
Over 30,000 jobs averaging more than $70,000 a year: that's what's on the line with the #GatewayProject. #POTUS listed Gateway as his #1 infrastructure priority, and NY and NJ have offered to foot half the bill for this project. https://t.co/O7eJeKBtMK
I’m with the @PokJournal Editorial Board. We’ve got to make sure that the anchorages proposal stays dead and I’ll keep working with local stakeholders to make sure that happens. Our regional economy depends on it. 	https://t.co/ma5J3OJ7eN
The anchorages proposal is dead – and the #HudsonValley killed it together. If another zombie proposal to install anchorage sites on the #HudsonRiver pops up – we’ll be ready to fight it. https://t.co/WKVJatHe9u
Special Counsel Robert #Mueller is following the facts and has already brought charges against dozens of criminals and criminal organizations. Any move to fire him would be unacceptable. 	https://t.co/f60xGEhBAr

I wish Rep. Slaughter’s family well during this difficult time. She will be sorely missed.
She was a role model for me when I started serving in the House. She was intelligent, tenacious, and principled. But she also had an incredible sense of humor, a disarming smile, and a talent for working with members of the New York delegation on both sides of the aisle.
After over 30 years of service, Louise was a giant in #ROC, throughout the State of New York, and in Congress. She was the kind of Representative every American would be lucky to have.
She was the only microbiologist in Congress – and got her degree at a time when women faced incredible barriers – especially in the sciences. But even after all of her success, she never forgot her roots in Kentucky and fought for working people throughout her entire career.
My heart is with #ROC and @louiseslaughter's loved ones, her friends and her staff. Louise was a pioneer for women’s rights and a role model for women across the country.
Happy Founders Day, @WestPoint_USMA! It’s a real honor to represent the cadets, faculty and administration at our country’s top military academy in Congress and serve on its Board of Visitors. https://t.co/JhLpAwMT9s

Proud 2 secure funding 2 kickstart flood mitigation 4 families &amp; businesses of Middletown. These folks have lost their land &amp; worried about flash-flooding &amp; erosion 4 yrs. But that’s about 2 change. This funding will help create jobs &amp; spur local economy. https://t.co/DWVuOBnWUT
Our bipartisan Congressional trip 2 Middle East also took me 2 UAE.

As an #LGBT American I'm at a loss. Our community suffers tremendous loss, now GOP lawmakers refuse to even allow a vote.
Even after tragic #orlandoshooting, @HouseGOP won't even allow a vote on my amdt. to protect basic rights of #LGBT Americans. Shameful.
.@HouseGOP so committed to discrimination they refuse to even allow vote on my amdt. to prevent discrimination against #LGBT Americans.
.@HouseGOP rigged vote, rigged bill, rigged rules. Hopeful horrors of #OrlandoShooting will convince GOP it's time to stand w/ #LGBT people.
Will be speaking at the Rules Committee to convince them to hold vote on my amdt. to prevent discrimination against #LGBT Americans.
