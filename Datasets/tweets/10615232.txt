Widespread abuse demands action 2correct long list of eb5 failure For yrs I worked to pass bipartisan fix or let program expire Trump admin can reform through regulation+ OMB SHOULD NOT DELAY
Obama+Trump admin admit eb5 program is full of national security risks	-DHS memo warned that Iranian operatives used eb5 to violate sanctions+ facilitate terrorism	-also 1 of Chinas most wanted fugitives used fraudulent documents to escape to US w stolen funds
In 1 California eb5 scam $50m went to project that never happened Money instead spent on sports cars+mansions List goes on…
Another Example of eb5 fraud - $22m supposed to build housing was instead pocketed by developer Or how abt $15m 2help rebuild after hurricane Katrina went to developers vacation home in eb5 scheme
Fake EB-5 regional centers raise millions from foreign investors on promise of economic boost only to pocket $ &amp;jeopardize visas for investors A few examples	$60m given to real estate co that falsely promised ‘risk free’ investment
Congress designed EB-5 2 promote jobs in rural+economically underserved areas but its been hijacked by fraudsters or abused by big city developers 2 subsidize glitzy projects

@realDonaldTrump You said in campaign that Obama drew a red line in sand &amp; there were no consequences &amp; that hurt America’s prestige. I thnk you’re getting close to doing the same thing by tkng troops frm Syria &amp; Afghanistan. You shouldn’t embolden Taliban during negotiations.
Only way I know to stop a Schumer shutdown is 4 Schumer &amp;Trump to be locked in a room &amp;reach agreement on $ 4 border security. Obv must stop drug dealers, human traffickers&amp; criminals fr entering country. What’s big deal Sen Schumer? U have voted to spend 25b on wall-why not $5B?

With all the extensions we give Dr Ford to decide if she still wants to testify to the Senate I feel like I’m playing 2nd trombone in the judiciary orchestra and Schumer is the conductor
Judge Kavanaugh I just granted another extension to Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w the statement she made last week to testify to the senate  She shld decide so we can move on  I want to hear her.  I hope u understand.  It’s not my normal approach to b indecisive
Five times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story  Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony. Come to us or we to u

Cmte investigators are following up on the leads from Dr. Ford’s allegations &amp; news stories No other OUTSIDE investigation is necessary for the Cmte to do its investigation. Don’t know why Dems are refusing to cooperate in the cmte’s investigation I hope Dems will join me 4/4
If Senate Dems think they need the FBI to investigate, why didn’t they alert the FBI on July 30? As soon as I learned of the allegations from the Washington Post on Sunday I moved swiftly to follow up on Dr. Ford’s allegations As the FBI has said its role here is complete 3/4
We’re going to continue to try to hear from Dr. Ford in any format she's comfortable w open session/closed session/private staff interviews/public staff interviews bc her information is very important. We’ve provided an opportunity for her to put her story fwd on Monday 2/4
Dr. Ford shouldn’t be threatened or insulted &amp; she deserves to be heard. I expect my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be respectful &amp; treat this situation with the sensitivity it deserves 1/4

DOJ &amp; FBI have credibility problem bc ppl assume a double standard &amp; not enough accountability Law enforcement needs to ignore politics &amp; follow facts &amp; embrace oversight / IG report a good step in right direction
Strzok &amp; Page were leaders of Clinton/Trump investigations &amp; wanted to stop Trump from being Pres  Dem &amp; GOP should admit FBI agent bias NOT try 2 excuse
Txt msgs show FBI prejudged Clinton case b4 it was done &amp; Lynch defers to FBI decision on Clinton but Lisa Page txt says AG 'knows no charges will be brought'
Many ppl saying DOJ IG report found no bias but txt msgs prove that's false / Report says txt 'indicative of a biased state' &amp; 'implies a willingness to take official action to impact' election
Comey attorney said he was out of the country &amp; couldn’t testify 2day but he was tweeting from Iowa recently I prefer being in Iowa too but ppl deserve answers abt FBI conduct

Law says 15b gallons &amp; Congress intended 15b gallons &amp; Trump promised 15b gallons / why cant Pruitt do 15b gallons? Poor excuses killing ethanol/Midwest farmers 3/3

There's no higher WH official than Pres Trump who said he supports E15 yr round / what is EPA waiting for? 1/3

Thank God for Leader McConnell’s decision to cancel August recess so that the senate can finally get to work on important legis set aside bc of dem filibusters on almost every judge A recent example Judge Weir passed 2day 95-0 &amp;still required a dem filibuster
DC=island surrounded by reality IOWA=real world. Iowans asked me last wk @ 12 county mtgs “How are u coming along on nominations?” fair q &amp; in the face of dem obstruction longer work hours needed lets vote Fridays/wknds/August until we clear the deck of all judicial nominees
Why would the Democrats make us go thru filibuster &amp; waste hours on a judge nomination?  district judge Robert Wier just now confirmed 95-0!! He could’ve gone thru on a voice vote!
@realDonaldTrump 5/5 Americans expect INTEGRITY in their immigration system Wrote @SecNielsen abt her Dept report finding EB5program susceptible to “Ponzi schemes” +other financial fraud Reforming EB5 helps build confidence in our immigration system &amp;can be done w/out Congress
@realDonaldTrump 4/5 In March Australian developer was caught on mic saying only reason he invested in a resort was to sell visas Real priority of many EB5 projects is to scam money/sell citizenship If you finalized regulations this corruption would end
@realDonaldTrump 3/5 1 attorney sold citizenship to 45 Chinese investors, collected $22.5 million &amp; STOLE $12 million to purchase homes Very few jobs created Regs would end this corruption w/in EB5 program
@realDonaldTrump 2/5 Just last Tuesday 2 MD residents charged with using scam projects to sell citizenship Sold Citizenship to 31 immigrants + spent money to buy themselves vacation properties, NOT TO CREATE JOBS Need regulations to reform corrupt EB5 program

Sometimes democrats filibuster a judicial nom &amp; then the judge passes almost UNANIMOUSLY(ie Nye Coggins etc) it’s easy for the taxpayers to see the waste of time and $$ in actions like this
I’d like 2see #filibusterfridays in the Senate If Dems want to filibuster we can vote on Fridays +into wknds Democrats obstruct most judicial noms (36 filibusters by Dems 2day at same pt in Obama admin Republicans had filibustered 2!)
Another summer, another heavy work load NOW is the time to vote on Fridays (even wknds!) to get MORE nominations confirmed Especially judges Help the judicial branch
Senate Judic Cmte has been hard at work processing judges to fill the 147 judicial vacancies At evry turn it seems we are met w Democrat filibusters Lets work Friday/Saturday/August recess to get more done in the Senate &amp; help the judicial branch do its job

3/3 I agree w Speaker Ryan on need for welfare reform He should start w corporate welfare for WALL ST BANKERS getting MILLIONS in subsidies meant for FARMERS who do the hard work in the fields feeding America &amp; the world. Rich NYC bankers/millionaires don’t need help
2/3 If freedom caucus in the house believes in fiscal responsibility they shouldn’t let a farm bill go through that gives unlimited subsidies to WALL ST BANKERS How is that fair to taxpayers? Should follow Trump budget and put caps &amp; only give to farmers who need them
1/3 Rep Conaway says I’m wrong about farm bill payment limits but he should tell this farmer why I’m wrong about limiting farm subsidies to FARMERS not WALL ST BANKERS living high on the hog Farm subsidies meant as a safety net for farmers w dirt under their nails

1/19/16 Trump at IA Renewable fuels summit: EPA shld make sure blend levels match statutory level set by Congress THAT’S 15B GALLONS/Pruitt shld work hard to make sure he doesn’t undercut the president’s support of ethanol 2/2
I’ve supported Pruitt but if he pushes changes to RFS that permanently cut ethanol by billions of gallons he will have broken Trump promise &amp; he should step down &amp; let someone else do the job of implementing Trump agenda if he refuses 1/2

Why would you want to extnd EB5 program with major national security loopholes? Remember ICE warned of investor fraud and use by terrorists/espionage agents. Why wld republican leaders want to extend EB5?
Why sell out American ppl by extending EB5 program w long history of fraud/abuse by wealthy foreign investors? Why not fix huge national security concerns? Status quo bad for rural America, worse for national security
I forgot  to mention in previous tweet I’m talk to republican leadership reason not to extend EB5 program in Omnibus
Leadership take note! Why would u want to extnd program rife with fraud and corruption. Just look at $50 million fraud suit in Cal. Often money from unknown foreign source! Why would u want to extend program without Grassley/Goodlatte reforms?
WAKE UP  HOUSE&amp;SENATE LEADER  don’t extend EB5 in Omni  Goodlatte and I worked compromise BUT Manhattan real estate moguls reject/  So r u yr after yr going to melt in front of these moneyed interests??
@realDonaldTrump “THE ART OF THE DEAL” u say”I never get too attached to one deal or one approach” REMEMBER THAT when u think abt a cap on erhanolRINS which will hurt a rural industry&amp;farmers

The Schumer shut down of fed govt is wrong for various reasons   Most important it hurts soldiers veterans and children
