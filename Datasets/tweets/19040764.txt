Thanks to Trump economic policies unemployment claims at lowest since Nov., 1969--199,000.  Yet No-Trumpers join Democrats in opposing the President.  Why does Arnold, Chad Mayes and Kristin Olsen oppose low unemployment?  We need a CA GOP that stands with the successes of Trump.

Congrats to President Trump--today is anniversary of his inauguration.  In two years he has created historically low unemployment for blacks, Hispanics and women.  Pres. Trump cut taxes, built manufacturing and ended most of ISIS. Trump stands tall for the United States.

American public revolting against Hollywood double standard--hate Trump supporters--love bullies, "'THE CONNERS' gets half of 'ROSEANNE' ratings."  No Roseanne?  No watching.  She "died" on show--show died on TV.  Free speech is dead in Hollywood.
President Trump wants to cut 5% from the budget of each government agency.  How would you cut it?  Give you answers her. My ideas, to start:		1.  Cut all phony NIH studies.	2.  End funding to State or cities that protect felons from foreign countries	3.  Mandate work for welfare
Who cares if Elizabeth Warren is .09% Native American?  She is 100% radical, hateful, socialist/abusive.  She believes government should control your job, earnings/family.  Supported the apology tour against America by Obama. The DNA test did not show her opposition to freedom

Just finished being  interviewed by Brian Sussman (KSFO San Fran).  The city has the highest crime rate of any big city in nation--including Chicago!  That is how out of control California has become.  Be warned--San Fran is CRIME CITY.  Protect yourself--stay home.
The rest of the Amazon story:  As Amazon raises the minimum wage for employees to $15 an hour, watch as the firm quickens the pace for the use of robots and computers replacing humans.  The wage increase is cover for using machines rather than humans--even Amazon can't afford it.
1/1/13 there were one million MORE Republicans than Decline to State in California.  As of 9/7/18 there are 430,000 MORE Decline to State than GOP. The Republican Party in these 5 years LOST 1.4 Million registrants. We need to go Back to Basics--re-start registration programs.

Happy to attend a fund raiser for Congressman McClintock in Sacramento yesterday.  He had Victor Davis Hanson as the speaker.  Great turnout--need to get him re-elected.  This is the time to put in an extra effort for victory in November.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein has a nice smile and loves to talk to Republicans.  She votes to the Left of Bernie Sanders.  Her smears of Kavanaugh have not gone unnoticed.  I nominate her as "America's Smear Artist of the Year".  Will you second that nomination?
@TonyKrvaric @LindseyGrahamSC @ChuckGrassley @SenSanders Glad to see GOP leaders aggressively fighting back against the lies and smears--only way to stop a bully is to stand up to them--which is what Grassley and Graham are doing.

Newest PPI poll poll shows Feinstein/De Leon race for Senate getting close.  Could it be that Republicans will vote for Socialist De Leon because of the Feinstein smear job on Kavanaugh?  Watch as GOP'ers punish Smear Artist Dianne.
@TonyKrvaric Tony:  Democrats believe the end justifies the means--smear someone if you think they would be an honest Justice--something the Democrats can not afford.  Lying is Ok in the cause of the Socialist/Totalitarian Left.

Spoke today at an independent political club in West Los Angeles.  Promoted our statewide candidates, ballot positions and asked for volunteers to make calls and help at HQ.  Leadership is persuading the public to vote for our GOP Team
Was on KPRL, Paso Robles "Sound Off" on Thursday promoting GOP statewide candidates--promoting Republican values and principles--not talking to the GOP, but the general public.  Pushing the voter turnout in support of lower taxes and limited government.
@RonNehring I am not sure where my schedule for last year is!  This is silly time in D.C.--I want to hear from Juanita Broadrick and Paula Jones after Dr. Ford.
On Nov. 6 California Republicans are forced to vote for Socialist Kevin De Leon for Senator or the Socialist/Smear artist Dianne Feinstein.  Under Prop. 14, NO write ins are allowed.  Another reason to repeal Prop. 14--it causes vote suppression.
Yesterday I gave a training session to local candidates and campaign workers in San Luis Obispo County.  Organization, precinct operations., etc.  Here is a URL to see the session. Have done this in numerous areas of the State w/written curriculum..   https://t.co/9JSvL5OaxK
Professor Ford now is willing to attend a hearing, on her schedule not the Senate's.  She wants a "fair" hearing". How is this for fair--she attend on Monday, as already set and answers questions honestly--that is fair.  She should be treated like any other witness. That is fair.
Feinstein efforts to smear Kavanaugh should stop her private conversations with Republican "leaders" to endorse her against De Leon.  GOP;ers should not vote for a hater of Trump judicial appointments and tax cuts. (even if she smiles at you to make you feel good).

Last night I spoke at the Tr-City Tea Party (Oceanside) to a get groups of involved activists.  Promoted them working for Diane Harkey and Mimi Walters for Congress, Cox and the Team for Governor and statewide office--plus Yes on 6.  Promoted the GOP values and principles.
This is why Republicans should not vote for Feinstein for Seante--she abused Kavanaugh and American people, "Feinstein Fesses Up On Anti-Kavanaugh Accusations: ‘I Can’t Say That Everything Is Truthful’"  Vote on Monday--end the Democrat farce.
Another political scam by the Left, "Kavanaugh Accuser´s Lawyer Is Vice-Chair Of Soros Funded Org Opposing Kavanaugh." Open investigation of attorney!  The Left hates the Constitution and want a Breyer or Ginsburg instead of a Gorsuch or Kavanaugh.  Vote GOP in November!

@TonyKrvaric @sandiegodems Tony:  did you expect different from Democrats?  They are raising taxes to force middle class out of California.  Guv Brown wants to depopulate the former Golden State--for rich and poor, only--like Venezuela.
New "right" in Constitution--illegal aliens can steal MORE of your $$? "Attorney in Mollie Tibbetts Murder Trial: Illegal Alien Has ‘Constitutional	Right’ to Taxpayer Funding." Let Pelosi, Brown, Harris and Feinstein pay instead of taxpayers.
Democrat bullies try to bribe Sen. Collins, now threaten her with writer of fiction.  "Author Stephen King threatens to destroy Susan Collins if she votes to confirm Brett Kavanaugh." King writes fiction novels, now wants to write Fake News--how sick is he?  TDS contagious? Yup.
How many CA jobs will disappear due to Sacramento Democrats effort to be like Venezuela? "Maduro's huge salary increases force 40% of Venezuelan stores to close" San Fran/L.A. already losing minimum wage jobs due to increase in minimum wage.  hurts the poor.

Democrats to abolish ICE--the agency that stops the drug cartels, drug dealers, human sex slave traffickers.  Democrats are acting like lobbyists for the vile criminals--why do Dems prefer criminals to honest Americans? When will the people demand public safety instead of crime?
Progressives are clear--belief in a Supreme Being AND the Constitution is a disqualifer for a Justice of the Supreme Court. Hatred of religion is exposed, "Progressives Deploy Religious Ignorance and Bigotry to Stop Amy Coney Barrett." Feinstein said Barrett is "TOO CATHOLIC".
Democrats War on Women (the "wrong" women) continues-- now they oppose a qualified women for the Supreme Court?  Why?  She supports the Constitution.  "Barrett´s Nomination For SCOTUS Gains Steam: Democrats Declare War On Her" Feinstein claimed Barrett is "too" Catholic. Bigot

Obama imports 441 "refugees" from Syria--436 Muslims--5 Christians--dozens sent to Orlando area--Barack kicks American in the teeth.
Fox News reports, "Gun sales up by 22% in April vs April of 2015."  Americans no longer trust government to protect them--my analysis right?
Obama lied about cost and scope of ObamaCare, lied about Benghazi, lied about IRS--today CIA Director called him a liar about ISIS threat
Did Obama lie to the families of the victims of the Orlando Terrorist attack like Hillary lied to the families of the victims of Benghazi?

Islamic Jihad, terrorists: hate gays, women, Jews, Christians--Hillary/Barack, hate freedom.  Will voters and families wake up?
