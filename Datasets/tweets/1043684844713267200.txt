Nursing home lobbyists write bills to restrict inspections, lawsuits against owners https://t.co/bsLkW32LO6
"It’s hard enough to be a surveyor as it is. They work nights and weekends, they have to travel all over the place, the pay isn’t very good, and frankly, there is political pressure brought to bear on them by the facility owners and their friends.”
Tony Cisney’s case  went to trial last fall, but he backed out of a settlement deal with the cabinet.		“To me, this bill sounds like it’s trying to restrict what the surveyors can do in uncovering problems at facilities,” Edelman said. “How is that an improvement?
For example, in 2016, former Kentucky nursing home inspector Tony Cisney filed a whistle-blower lawsuit against the cabinet in Jefferson Circuit Court, alleging that his superiors ordered him to soften his enforcement of health and safety violations at several facilities.
Inspectors sometimes feel obligated to publicly blow the whistle on serious issues they see at nursing homes that aren’t being addressed by their regulatory agencies, an act that would violate the confidentiality agreement, Edelman said.
Inspectors get valuable information from talking privately to employees who are willing to reveal problems like under-staffing and patient neglect, which is unlikely to happen if their boss is in the room, said Toby Edelman, for the Center for Medicare Advocacy  in Washington.
The cabinet is reviewing Carney’s bill and is not ready to comment on it, spokesman Doug Hogan said Monday. But a national expert on nursing home regulation said the bill “raises red flags.” 		ADVERTISING
KY  OIG  Inspectors also would have to sign a newly crafted confidentiality agreement barring them — at risk of losing their jobs — from revealing information to anyone outside of the cabinet about what they witnessed during nursing home inspections.
Lobbyists for Kentucky’s nursing home industry have helped write two bills so far in the 2019 General Assembly that would place new restrictions on state inspections of nursing homes and on wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits filed against owners of the facilities.
