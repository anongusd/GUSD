Today, a full-time worker making the $7.25 minimum wage has less buying power than that same worker in the 1960s. Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give nearly 40 MILLION workers a raise. That’s why I am proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWageAct.

The resolution is not the end of this critical conversation. It is vital that we have a full discussion in the next Congress on the crisis and work toward a reasonable solution that I hope will bring an end to the atrocities taking place in Yemen.
It's unfortunate my Republican colleagues played political games by attaching a measure as serious as the humanitarian crisis occurring in Yemen to the Farm bill. This was Congress’ last chance before the end of the year to provide much-needed relief to families through the Bill.
I’m pleased that the House has worked to provide certainty to those fighting hunger and farmers by passing a bipartisan Farm Bill. #FarmBill
I applaud the inclusion of $40 million for agricultural scholarships for students attending 1890 Land Grant Institutions in the #FarmBill. These funds will help future generations at schools, such as @FAMU_1887, continue to pursue careers in #agriculture. #HBCU #FAMU #Ag https://t.co/5pUr3NhDyi

A #TrumpShutdown means that popular 7(a) and 504 loans would cease to be issued. In the 7(a) program alone, a shutdown would reduce capital to small firms by $110 million per day.
A #TrumpShutdown prevents federal agencies from entering into any new contracts, including those with small businesses. On a daily basis, a shutdown could cause small firms to forgo approximately 6,875 contract actions worth $301,656,083.
The LAST thing our country needs is a government shutdown. This #TrumpShutdown won’t help the economy, it won’t help our kids stay healthy, and it won’t help anyone in my district. Frankly, it’s ridiculous that Republicans have brought us to this point. GOP, #DoYourJob!
