Justice for the accused wasn't enough to come forward.		Preventing the possibility of further assault wasn't enough.		Even the #MeToo movement wasn't enough.		Setting an example for women everywhere still wasn't enough.		Apparently the line is an 11th hour SCOTUS confirmation.

@dbartoni69 @fatoldbagpp I'm far from angry, don't worry. True, hypocrisy can be subjective but that's plainly not the case here. Partisan praise &amp; indignation according to party lines will always be hypocritical. Also, isn't telling me "what I can't say" hypocritical by your standard? 🤔
@fatoldbagpp @dbartoni69 It's an option, one I reserve for irrational discussion. It becomes readily apparent when people take the turn away from thought provoking conversation to emotional screeching. As long as people of all points of view care to converse rationally, I choose to hang around.

@dbartoni69 @fatoldbagpp Telling a hypocrite it's unwise to open their mouth may be coercive but certainly not a declarative suppression of free speech. They don't need me to show their opinion has no value, it's very evident from their hypocrisy. Sounding liberal at times results from free thinking.
@dbartoni69 @fatoldbagpp Of course people are allowed their own opinions. However, spewing hypocritical partisan rhetoric does, in fact, make you a hypocrite. If that is your sole contribution in discussion, you should keep your mouth shut in my opinion. Free speech does not guarantee added value.
@dbartoni69 @fatoldbagpp I'm saying hypocrisy has no added value &amp; invalidates your opinion. Praising Obama in one breath only to condemn Trump is just that, hypocrisy. Conversely, admonishing Obama for meeting dictators while lauding Trumps efforts makes you look just as stupid.
@dbartoni69 @fatoldbagpp Every situation is different, but the 2 ways to deal with dictators will never change. Either all out war, or sit at the table. Decades of economic sanctions punish people unable to make the necessary changes.
@dbartoni69 @fatoldbagpp The daily hypocrisy of the left is down right disgusting at times. This application applies to them as well, but I haven't seen this much overt hypocrisy from the right in quite some time.
@fatoldbagpp @dbartoni69 Just because you CAN open your mouth, doesn't mean you SHOULD
