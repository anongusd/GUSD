@JasonRileyWDRB 6/ 	 	 The records are supposed to be produced by ATT later this week, so Pitino's attorneys are trying to get this handled fast so ULAA won't get all of that from phone companies.
@JasonRileyWDRB 5/ In theory, this would mean ULAA could look at Pitino's communication with "every friend, family member, household 	 contractor, health care provider, or business associate" over the past 3 years.
@JasonRileyWDRB 4/ Pitino argues that it's over broad because the subpoena doesn't specify that the records have to be about this case.
@JasonRileyWDRB 3/ Here's what ULAA wants going back 3 years: 	 "1) phone numbers, date, time and length of all 	 incoming and outgoing calls, and 2) date, time, and contact number of all SMS or ‚Äòtext‚Äô 	 messages or ‚ÄòiMessages‚Äô for‚Äù specified telephone numbers."

Wow. 		Cunningham, while telling Carter that  it doesn‚Äôt make him happy to send him to adult prison, refers to Brice Rhodes as a sociopath.
Cunningham is going to deny probation, it sounds like.
Fairness and justice are different things, Cunningham says. 		‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre talking about fairness, we should probably put a needle in your arm. But justice is different,‚Äù he tells Carter.

Here is the video from Constant‚Äôs camera. Appears he shot him in the back. You can see officers pull away shotgun from under his body. @WDRBNews https://t.co/kHD7mkbIAb
Someone, presumably family members, told officers ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt shoot him‚Äù when they first got on scene.
More shots were fired after this but you can‚Äôt see anything. This is from Mattingly‚Äôs camera.
Can‚Äôt see much from first officer. This is around back of house. https://t.co/I8gz6JOy0L
Public integrity unit head Lt. Aaron Crowell says 911 calls were received that Kennedy was firing rounds into the air. Crowell says Kennedy came out of house with shotgun, fired shots at officers. 		Then came out front door, still with the shotgun, wouldn‚Äôt put down. Then shot.
Conrad, as he usually does, mentions limitations of body cameras. Movement, lighting, etc. all factors.		Person killed was 35 YO Benjamin Kennedy. 		Officers who fired weapons are William Mattingly and Dallas Constant (sp?)
Chief Conrad says video will ‚Äúunderscore how dangerous police work is.‚Äù

Which suddenly makes this committee exceptionally powerful.
Hollander proposed amendment that would only allow full Metro Council to launch independent investigations or audits fails. So Gov‚Äôt Oversight, Audit and Ethics Committee now has power to launch independent investigations without prior approval by full Metro Council.
CM Kevin Kramer said several years ago, a council member could call the city auditor and simply request one. Hollander, sitting behind Kramer, doesn‚Äôt seem thrilled with this line of thought.

Sullivan says Harper requested to go to the river patrol. Harper says that isn‚Äôt true. The transfer form lists the reason for transfer as ‚Äúbest interest for department‚Äù but there is an option for a request for transfer that wasn‚Äôt listed. That was signed by Conrad.

5 minutes ago, Kraeszig said Harper‚Äôs comment to the mayor were defamatory. Now, after further questioning, she says they were not.
In Kraeszig‚Äôs write-up of Harper for the issue, she cites that SOP. Thats the only documented item used in reasoning by Conrad for Harper‚Äôs demotion.
Kraeszig believes that the conversation between the mayor and Harper was a public conversation. Fischer testified yesterday that it was a private conversation. 		This is important. LMPD standard operating procedures say officers can‚Äôt *publically* criticize department.
Kraeszig says she didn‚Äôt think it was important when Metro Council had a no-confidence vote in August 2017. Says she didn‚Äôt pay attention to it.
Conrad, grinning, obviously pleased with testimony of Kraeszig.
Kraeszig said that Harper was one of best commanders she ever had. But says ‚Äúsomething happened‚Äù when Harper moved from 3rd division to 2nd division.		Asked about morale in department...Kraeszig sidesteps, says it can vary day-to-day.

Conrad has previously listed seven factors for demoting Jimmy Harper but Conrad admits that only one of those was documented.
‚ÄúHe was complaining to my boss about a decision that I had made,‚Äù Conrad says. Still doesn‚Äôt believe that Harper was ever whistleblowing.
Conrad says the first time he became aware of the overtime issue was when he read the @WDRBNews story. Conrad did not order an investigation. PIU initiated the investigation on its own.
Conrad says he has not personally reviewed the time sheets but the public integrity unit is now.
Conrad being questioned now about this story. 	https://t.co/U7Bi0CBGqw		Conrad won‚Äôt say that some of these officers were working impossible hours. But we now know there is a criminal investigation into the matter.
Conrad says no one from Metro Council told him that the money wa supposed to last through June but that was his goal.
Conrad concedes that $1.2 million allocated for violent crime reduction efforts by Metro Council would have run out in March 2017. It was supposed to last through June. Changes were made in February to stretch it out.

Sounds like much of the argument for defense is going to be that command staff (which Harper was) can be demoted because they are essentially at-will employees unlike patrol officers, sgts., and lieutenants which are under a collective bargaining agreement.
Ervin, alleges that Harper, in concert with Council President David James have conspired to get Conrad fired.

CM Kevin Kramer bringing a little fire here. Hitting Harvey pretty hard on that March meeting and a possible conflict of interest that could result because of that meeting. Ultimately, Kramer says, the city‚Äôs goal of that meeting was to reduce liability of city.
According to Harvey, his role was simply to listen to LMPD officer about 2013 investigation to gain better understanding of facts. Technically, this was before Harvey‚Äôs contract began.
Committee chair has concerns about ‚Äúindependent nature‚Äù of investigation after Harvey attended meeting early on with Mayor‚Äôs office and county attorney where a defense for the city was discussed.
Harvey believes that the investigation should have been broadened after it was learned that a second Explorer was offered money for sex by Betts. That was known to @lmpd back in 2013.
Talking about 2013 @LMPD investigation, Harvey says PIU (criminal) investigators interviewed the 16 year old Explorer who made initial complaint about Betts texting her wanting to make out. Those investigators decided not to pursue issue, turned it over to internal investigators.

@PaulaEquine @WDRBNews Sexual harassment isn‚Äôt actually in legislative ethics code. All agreed in room today that it should be.
@LGonTV @Sears
The motion was due to an improperly filed complaint by Rep. Jim Wayne.
So now, Rep. Jeff Hoover, who isn‚Äôt here, is the only legislator that remains in this wrongdoing complaint. https://t.co/WTfI8dIfRe
Legislative Ethics Commission has dismissed complaint against Rep. Jim DeCesare, Rep. Brian Linder, and Rep. Michael Meredith. @WDRBNews
Wants complaint thrown out on those grounds.
New motion from defense after Wayne  testified that he had no factual knowledge when he filed the complaint.
Wayne says he never spoke with the woman who accused the legislators of sexual harassment before filing the complaint.
(D) Jim Wayne testifying now. He filed the complaint against Hoover, Linder, DeCesare and Meredith back on Nov. 5th. https://t.co/2TQZb3RqQD
The total settlement payment was $110,000 split between Hoover, Linder, Meredith and DeCesare.
Enforcement lawyer says based on evidence he‚Äôs seen, he believes the funding for the settlement was not public money.
Attorney for Hoover, Meredith and DeCesare will seek to quash subpoena in Franklin circuit court.
Commission voted 5-1 to subpoena the demand letter. Which may delay this drastically.
Motion to dismiss complaints against DeCesare and Meredith fails.
Coming out of executive session here shortly. Will try and sort it out.

Commission going to take a lunch break and then head into executive session to discuss dismissing Meredith/Desceare complaint as well as Hoover demand letter. @WDRBNews
Assumption here is that this would delay the LEC if circuit court has to rule on whether demand letter should be put into public file
Question now of whether Franklin Circuit Court will need to get involved to determine if the demand letter should be turned over.
Atty for Hoover argues that eventually that letter will become public record if its turned over...she says it would complicate the facts of the case.
Now discussion of demand letter sent to Hoover by accuser. Hoover's attorney has the letter but is refusing to turn it over. Preosecuting atty wants subpoena from Commission.
Harvey is hitting on the fact that sexual harassment is not against the legislative code of ethics. Says Linder is in position because he sent one text message to staffer.
Attorney is arguing that commission should apply misdemeanor statute of limitations with regards to time passed since the acts actually took place.
As for Meredith, she says he made a "vulgar" statement to staffer. Attorney argues that too long has passed since those actions took place. She's now requesting complaints against DeCesare and Meredith be dismissed.
Atty for Rep. DeCesares says he sent one text message to a staffer after he was done with with work saying "she could come over."
Complaint will not be dismissed as requested by defense.
Coming out of executive session now. @WDRBNews
Commission is going to go into executive session here and consider the argument that the complaint should be dismissed.
Seemingly, the argument for Linder is that the 4 cases need to be heard separately.
Harvey says there are no facts that Linder did anything. Only a report that Linder entered into a settlement agreement. Thats from the Grant County News. https://t.co/H9LEXhNqjg
Mike Malone, who is essentially acting as prosecutor, says (D) Rep. Jim Wayne (who filed the complaint) is able to testify. @WDRBNews https://t.co/bbfbpFr3eQ
