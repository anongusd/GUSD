@cool_tweet_man What I am implying is to beware of CROOKS. A lot of people come at me on social media with bio’s full of “professions” they know they don’t have. It’s okay to reach out to rising talent just as long as there’s a plan of action or a definite goal that will see successful results.

You don’t die if you fall in water, you die only if you don’t swim.
Trying to please EVERYONE is a recipe for stress, misery and frustration. The best thing you can do is believe in yourself and do what best suits you!
I really wish people found a better way of trying to go inside my head. Maybe they wouldn’t FAIL to misunderstand me so much. Even when you know YOUR character, people will think they’ve defeated you when you remain silent. The more you explain, the more they fail to understand.

Technology has made everyone and everything non verbal and distant. It has deeply affected tons of marriages, relationships, families &amp; friendships. Social exchange has collapsed. People don’t pick up the phone, they don’t visit, lifestyles have changed because of technology. 😕
When was the last time you did something for the first time? You don’t have to risk your life to be adventurous. Take a risk, move somewhere new, start over and discover new things. You’ll find that you’re actually LIVING. Say the word Monotony. Did that sound HAPPY? 🤓🙃

My name may have a blue check mark next to it but that doesn’t mean I have it easy. I still have to work twice as hard and remain humble. I don’t need likes, followers or retweets to make me feel important. You don’t need to be driven by the material things to your enjoy life. 😉
Some of these music producers are becoming so invasive with their e-mail marketing. I’m tired of having my email address manually added to their mailing list especially if I didn’t subscribe to it myself. Get permission!
Every time I scroll through my contact list, it reminds me of the tons of FRIENDS I THOUGHT I had. I’ve realized that after becoming an adult, you either grow up, grow closer or grow apart. Either way, growth has taken effect.
There are 24 hours in a day. Don’t let 1 person spoil a second of your time. Life is too precious for that. Value your time.
God has perfect timing. Never early, never late. It takes a little patience and a whole lot of faith, but it’s ALWAYS worth the wait. 🙏🏽😇💙
I’ve been a #ToysRUs kid since ‘96. 🦒 No child in today’s generation will ever experience the joy of being inside of a traditional “toy store”. Children in 2018 are very privileged. I’m sure parents have made more trips for their children to the Apple Store than Toys R Us.
Never make someone a priority when all you are to them is an option.
The MORE you love YOUR decisions, the LESS you need OTHERS to love them as well. Never let the lack of support deter your mission. Focus on winning like tomorrow’s your last day of living.
Others will hate on you so bad until they attempt to destroy the relationships you have with people. Envious people make the best journalists &amp; news reporters. They tell the worst lies when they hate you.
Sending my thoughts &amp; prayers to the family of rap legend, Craig Mack. May he rest in power! He’ll always be remembered for those impeccable rhymes. 🙏🏽👼🏽🎤🎵
Pay no mind to those that don’t support your hustle. Their opinion does not change the magnitude of your blessings. In the end, you will regret the chances you didn’t take. Keep your eyes on the prize. 🏆
Sometimes keeping your goals a secret may help you to achieve them.  Life is like a game of chess. Every player never reveal their next move. People will see you win so stop broadcasting your failures. Never complain to never explain.
The best compliment someone could give you is to copy you.
Happy Friday! Be safe, have fun &amp; do something nice for yourself/someone this weekend! I love you all! ❤️
Some of my best thoughts, content and creations come from being alone in my bedroom or in the shower. Time is money and money is time. ☺️
Leaders don’t force people to follow. They invite them on a journey. Never stand in the leaders way.
Sometimes God will make you wait for what you want just to see if you’ll be humble enough to handle it. Everything will fall in place at the right moment and when it does, make sure you remain the same. 😊
MOOD: I’ve become too lazy &amp; fragile to hold conversations with people that sometimes I intentionally forget to text back. It gets to the point where I grow spiritually &amp; emotionally drained from always giving people all of me that I just say, eff it and be done. 🤷🏽‍♂️😕
Stop labeling others because they aren’t like YOU or who YOU expect them to be. People only get jealous when they THINK you’re perfect. We ALL have flaws &amp; gifts, but furthermore we have an identity. You CREATE your OWN identity. Labels are only GIVEN by others. Remember that! 😊

Nobody will jump on YOUR train until it’s moving. We have to support our rising artists &amp; creators. It doesn’t matter what kind. Musicians, filmmakers, fashion designers, painters, etc. It is US that shape our culture &amp; provide a foundation for our youth. They’re watching! ❤️👀

Let us all have a moment of silence for the life of Traevon Martin. Today would have been his 23rd birthday. To be absent from the body is to be present with the lord. You may be gone, but you’ll never be forgotten. Happy Birthday in Heaven. 🙏🏽👼🏽💙
Stop rushing things that need time to grow. You’re granted a life with plenty of time so use it wisely and be patient. A plant doesn’t grow in one day. Paint doesn’t dry in the matter of seconds. Ovens are far more effective than microwaves. Your time will come! 😉
Nothing haunts us like the things we don’t say. Don’t be afraid to speak your mind. Life is too short to leave important words unspoken. If there is plenty of room for air to float around, there is plenty of room for your thoughts to be spoken and your minds to be open. 😊
Know that deep inside, you are resilient, brave and so much stronger and more powerful than your fears.

Hey guys, I keep receiving phone calls from a number that’s titled “Scam Likely”. What does this mean and has anyone received phone called from them before?! 🤨🤔😳
@JeffreyaReddick May your memories give you peace and comfort. My heart goes out to you and your family at this difficult time. ❤
People with the greatest advice usually have the most problems. 😕
Anybody can be likeable to anyone. If a person doesn’t like you, it’s because they CHOOSE not to. Keep smiling people, keep smiling! You are special, you are important, you are unique, you are loved and most of all, you are appreciated! I love you guys! Stay positive. ❤️
Don’t talk, just act.	Don’t say, just show.	Don’t promise, just prove.
According to some old myths, birth marks show where you “got killed” in your last life. Can somebody please explain!? 😂😂😂

Sometimes I have to tell my mind and my heart to B E H A V E. I am working on filtering my thoughts before I vocalize. I WILL NOT back down from speaking my truth. If you are mad, don’t blame my lips for speaking it. Blame my mind for thinking it &amp; my heart for feeling it. 😏😉
What you think is love aint LOVE. Some of you fall in lust and that’s what gets you hurt every time. You get brainwashed into thinking that it’s long term. It’s short term! Love is the rose but lust is the thorn. REAL LOVE is knowing when to have CONTROL! Remember that!☝🏽😌
What consumes your mind, controls your life.
If you can’t fly, then run.	If you can’t run, then walk.	If you can’t walk, then crawl.	But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward. 		— Martin Luther King Jr.
@4everDoug @llcoolj @JLo "I Need Love" would be considered a favorite right next to "Mama Said Knock You Out". Those two records got me acquainted with LL Cool J. Ever since then, I've been a fan! He's definitely a veteran in the game!
Happy Birthday to @llcoolj! Sending you many blessings, wishes and much love! You’re an inspiration to many! 🎊🎉🎂🎁🎈
Just because you stop posting on social media, doesn’t mean you quit. It simply means you’re working on YOURSELF to come back BETTER. Not everything needs to be announced, proven or solidified. The only competitor out there is YOU. 😉
Nothing lasts forever. Not even your problems, troubles, debts or losts. After every storm, there’s always sunshine &amp; brightness. Prayer is a bridge from despair to hope. Set goals that motivate you and seek out to accomplish them. Greatness is amongst you. 🖤
Ungrateful people... Always complaining about the ONE thing you haven’t done for them instead of being thankful for the THOUSANDS of things you have done for them. 😬🤔😐

Today while sitting at a red light, I heedlessly happened to look over to the car next to me &amp; observe a young lady SNATCH off her WIG. She beat &amp; itch her scalp for 3 minutes with dandruff flakes flying in the air. She fixed her wig back on &amp; drove off. It was pure comedy!💀😭🤣

DISCLAIMER: I am NOT on social media to upset anyone. I am here to provoke thoughts &amp; share GENERAL content with quality. If you do not agree with my posts, I’m open for a friendly discussion. A healthy conversation &amp; point of view starts with great listening &amp; understanding. 😊

Here’s a PSA: I’m starting FRESH on a clean slate next year. If you’ve done your best to AVOID &amp; IGNORE ME in 2017, then please continue to STAY EXACTLY IN YOUR SPACE because you WILL NOT be apart of my 2018!
I saw my blocked list for the first time in a while &amp; it was like graves in a cemetery. You see people in that list that you “used” to know &amp; never saw eye to eye with. Moral is that anyone can be likable to anybody. If a person doesn’t like you, it’s because they choose not to.
Some people aren’t loyal to you. They are loyal to their NEED of you. Once their needs change, so does their loyalty.
When people treat you terribly, you’ve got two weapons on your side... God and Karma. 		Move forward with your life &amp; let them do their job.
Woke up to a Snowy morning in Georgia. 😍 Have a safe weekend everyone! ❄️☃️ https://t.co/Vvfn7e7K1B

People need to ADMIT they deleted your number when you hit them up instead of saying... “I got a new phone”. That is the MOST TOLD LIE OF THE YEAR! Cloud storage would never magically erase someone’s contact. If you don’t “F” with me, cool. Just be true to yourself about it.😂🤣

Be careful trusting people. “I’ve got YOUR back” can turn into “I’ve got YOU back”.  Stay vigilant. Don’t end up backstabbed.
Stop letting people who do so little for you control so much of your mind, feelings and emotions.
Dare to dream. Always think beyond reality and make all of your wishes come true. Enjoy!😉 https://t.co/ay4RKoDGnj

I'm never shocked when people let me down nowadays. I just hate the fact I put myself in a position to be let down in the first place.
Stay away from media hungry people.
Stop always assuming you have "HATERS”. That only makes you a "HALLUCINATOR”! Worrying about haters other than yourself makes you worse off.
If the whole world was blind, how many people would you impress?! Looks ain't EVERYTHING!
Make sure that you are cautious with who you confide in. 		The same person you'd take a bullet for can end up being the one behind the gun.

Sometimes its best to disconnect &amp; enjoy your own company. Be alone. Get inside your mind. Get in tune with the atmosphere. Decrease stress.
Be careful who you tell your business to. A listening ear can turn into a running mouth.
Don't LIE to people that TRUST you.	Don't TRUST people that LIE to you.

Want people to stop spreading your business? Stop telling them. 🤗
"Showing a person your support" as opposed to "wishing a person all the best" is TWO different things. Well DONE is BETTER than well SAID.
You have brains in your head and feet in your shoes, you can steer yourself in any direction you choose! --- Dr. Seuss
Summer in the south isn't always 100% sun. It's 5% wind, 11% cloudy, 42% sun and the other 42% is rain, thunder &amp; lightening. 😂😂😂
Man, I love y'all! 👊🏽😊
When a person that notices you've liked their photo &amp; they take it down &amp; repost it. Is that a petty move or what? I need your thoughts! 😐
If you text someone you've known or have been talking to for months &amp; they answer with "Who's this?", Just focus on you. They don't care. 🙄
If you have to talk to more than three people about the SAME problem, You aren't seeking for HELP, You're seeking for ATTENTION.
Some people only LOVE you as much as they can USE you. Their LOYALTY ends when your BENEFIT does.
Now would be a great time to resurrect the Ice Bucket Challenge. ☀️🌞🔥😓😥
Any friend who transitioned into an enemy been disloyal &amp; untrustworthy since day one.
Don't trade your spiritual leader's timing for your deadline. 😊
Never argue with a foolish person. The people watching won't be able to tell the difference. ☝🏽😌
You know you're really dealing with a PSYCHO when you've blocked them &amp; they create a fake account just to challenge you. Hilariousness. 😂
Jealousy makes people tell the worst lies on you.
When you tilt the chip bag from the bottom up and the little chip crumbs fall in your nose. 😒🙄😂

People who aren't STORED in your LIFE shouldn't be STORED in your PHONE. Deleting &amp; freeing up UNWANTED storage can be so therapeutic. 😊

I wasn't trying to demoralize my black race. Just to clarify for the people that may feel bothered by my tweet. It's just a comical fact.
When you live in a black household, this becomes your trash bag, how you hide your food &amp; it protects your hair in the rain. Many uses. 😂🤣😭😆 https://t.co/dbOjD7fEVZ

I swear Atlanta gets like all 4 seasons in one day. I did not anticipate cold rainfall for this evening. Sun, where'd you go?! 😭😂☔️💦
Pay attention to who emits good energy &amp; bad energy. That's the universe giving you a hint of who you should embrace or stray from.
If you share MUTUAL FRIENDS with a HATER, Tell your business/vent to NO ONE. Chances are they're in your life to carry ALL of the news back.
I just love supporting indie films &amp; television projects... Especially indie horror. 🎬🎞📽📺🎥

A person who hasn't done what you're set out to do should never have the power to discourage you.
It is the people not liking your pictures that pay you the most attention. They might be jealous, but just know they are taking notes. 😏🙃
Be happy, it drives people crazy. 😉
Some people will sell you a dream and deliver a nightmare. It's up to you to stay woke. 💯
As an artist I believe that the labels &amp; industry wouldn't be as struggling if quality music was made &amp; released. Consumers create demand.
They brought back the Chuck Taylor's, High Top Fades &amp; Cross Colours. Now if 80's pop &amp; 90's R&amp;B could be brought back in style. 👈🏽😌
I see MORE people posting their food on social media and LESS people actually SITTING with their family &amp; BLESSING their food before eating.
People only rain on your parade because they are jealous of your sun and tired of their shade. 🙃
People will forward chain letters more than forwarding positivity in real life. 😂
I'm forever learning new things about Pro Tools and Logic Pro. ✊🏽😌

85% of social media is a LIE including the "occupations" &amp; "professions" that people list in their bio. People be confused about their life. https://t.co/ZsgECsQaMt
I depend on @YouTube so much for learning. Kudos to the people that spend lots of time editing &amp; putting together tutorials &amp; webinars! 🙏🏽
Stop trying to make people care about you. Many people don't even notice the cells &amp; organs in their bodies that keep them alive everyday.
I don't even save numbers anymore. People be so temporary. 		Only #'s from mom, dad, my siblings &amp; professional business affiliates ONLY. 🙃
SAUCY. 🔥🎲💯🐅 https://t.co/SnApyWKSgC
Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and impossible to forget.

You'd think my iPhone would protect me from looking like an idiot with spellcheck but it never fails. They need to call it AutoIncorrect. 😂
@JeffTimmons @MrPEC_Tacular Holy smokes!!! I've got to hear this!!! 🎶🎤🔥🙌🏽
@ChimaSimone Isn't it?! That's the jam!
I just find it so hysterical that a person you NEVER met before in your life nor you remember speaking to blocks you on social media. 😂🤣
Never put the key to your happiness in somebody else's pocket.
So, it's going to be raining all day here in Atlanta. Yesterday was so sunny &amp; beautiful too. I wish I was back in LA right now. 😫
@rickmusiq You are so ahead of your time, man! I see big things ahead for you! I'm proud of you. Keep up the great work, Superstar! 🎤🎵🎧🔊👑

Tell yourself...		I am talented.	I am smart.	I am ambitious.	I am attractive	I am focused.	I've got this.		Watch how you become.
Keep grinding.		Someone you don't know is rooting for you while some one you do isn't.
When I DO reach out &amp; YOU DON'T answer me, I'll understand. When I get very successful &amp; occupied &amp; I DON'T answer, I hope YOU understand.
You know you've been out all day once you get in &amp; have a collection of sock lint between your toes. 😂🙁😆

Stop dating people because of their money, security &amp; materialistic assets. Love is a gift, not an item. Learn to be receptive of that gift.
Ever miss someone so bad, it hurts?!
Don't wait till I'm gone to show me ❤️, just ❤️ me while I'm here.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.

That annoying moment when you get water in your ear after taking a bath or swimming in a pool. 😑💦 🚿
I'm not sure where it came from but I am honestly very happy &amp; humbled right now. What  the almighty God lifts up, no one can bring down. 💙
Hi, Robin! I 💙 inspiring others -- In fact, some of my tweets are not only to inspire but to provoke your thoughts too! Have a great day! 💫😎 https://t.co/RP6GjRkEko
Weak people revenge. Strong people forgive. Intelligent people ignore. Happy people clear their conscience.
Each sunrise is a fresh start. A new day. A brand new pencil on an empty page.
Freedom is never given, it is won.
In Atlanta it's funny how we run to the store, stock up on food &amp; barricade ourselves home over a light dusting of snow. Real snow is NORTH.
Some will try to help. Other will try to hinder.
Petty people are like dust mites that fall on your shoulder. They may seem irritating but you can always dust them off. 😂😉
Congratulations to all of the 2017 Grammy winners &amp; nominees. Continue creating and being great inspirations to us all! #GRAMMYs

You’d be surprised how many people are watching your page with hate &amp; anger, but It’s up to you to make it worth THEIR while. 😉
I’m writing, recording &amp; producing some great materials for you all. Can’t wait to share! I love you guys!!! #TeamDevonteRiley ✨😎🎤🎵🎶
Not everyone deserves to KNOW the real you. Let them criticize who they THINK you are. Besides, how can you hate someone you’ve never met?
I’m getting a little “block button” friendly and I’m loving it. Not in my mentions! Not today! 😂😂😂
Never take advice from someone whose life you wouldn’t want.
A persons character is shown through their actions in life, NOT where they sit every Sunday.
Word is bond! I'm with it!!! One love, family! I appreciate you! 🙏🏽😎✨ https://t.co/eS5x4Vh8HH
Move on. It’s just a chapter in the past. But don’t close the book. Just turn the page.
I never switched sides, I just switched lanes. Got older and realized everybody ain’t the same.
Forget it enough to get over it, remember it enough so it doesn’t happen again.
Hate causes problems in the world but name ONE problem it has solved... 👂🏽❓❔
Love doesn’t hurt you. It’s the person that doesn’t know how to show it that hurts you.
Never stop doing your best just because someone doesn’t credit you.
Never accept anything less than you deserve. Remember, you teach people how to treat you.
The best nicknames are the ones people don’t know they have. 🙃😜
☺✨ https://t.co/WV2E8MtmAg
People are gonna talk whether you’re doing good or bad. 🙃
I love helping my mom prepare meals but I hate chopping onions... My eyes are like Niagara Falls right now... 😭😭😭
Family is like branches on a tree, we all grow in different directions, yet our roots remain as one.
If you still talk about it, you still care about it.
Kind heart. Fierce mind. Brave soul.
Money only impress lazy women. When a woman works hard, a man with money is a bonus, not a ladder to upgrade.
People who shine from within don’t need a Spotlight.
Staying away from negative people &amp; being positive helps you keep your sanity and promotes great mental health.
I’m enjoying the #SuperBowl with a #SuperPlate of food in my hands. 🍱🍽🍛🍻🍸🍾Can’t enjoy the game without grub!

We either make moves or make excuses in 2017. Take your pick and know where you stand. Who’s with me?!
Retweet if you're ready for the #SuperBowl
Don’t assume you know me by what you heard. I grow daily. Your messenger might have outdated information. I put out what I want you to know.
I love y’all so much! 🙏🏽😇💙
Life is like weather. It can show you all four seasons. Bright &amp; sunny, dark &amp; stormy or it can be cold &amp; lonesome. Build your own forecast.
I tend to be happier when I am kept busy, as this prevents me from thinking about the negative things in life. I stay busy... Deliberately.
It may not be easy, but it will be worth it. #tuesdaymotivation
People that don’t associate with you only reach out on holidays &amp; birthdays but never have 1 thought about keeping in touch the whole year.
I still got numbers saved from people that don’t even text me... No wonder why my storage is so full. The circle I had became a dot! 😂😂😂
Throwing S H A D E  isn’t going to make you S H I N E .
Forgive people in your life, even those who are not sorry for their actions. 		Holding on to anger only hurts you, not them.
They will ignore you, until they need you.
Trying to get people to like you is a sign of mediocrity.
Pain changes people. It makes them trust less, overthink more, and shut people out.
Never respond to rudeness. When people are rude to you, they reveal who they are, not who you are. Don’t take it personally, be silent. 😉
Apparently, when you treat people the same way they treat you they get offended. 🙃

I can’t wait for my birthday next month. 😱😊I’ll be the official 21. 🎂🎈🎉🎊

If you sleep on your life, all you will have is dreams.
The ones who say “You can’t” and “You won’t” are probably the ones scared that “You will”...
Just when you think you know people, they disappoint you in ways you never thought they could.
People who are not happy with themselves, cannot possibly be happy with you. 🙃
People always wanna’ have the most to say to you when you have headphones on. 🙄😒🎧🎶🎵
I love meeting nice people. Always appreciate great people. They are hard to come by, especially in this day &amp; age. ☺
There are over 7 billion people on earth. Don’t let 1 person ruin your day. ☺️
Jealous people tell lies to rip relationships apart. Don’t believe everything you hear unless you’ve heard it from the horses mouth.
Tough times don’t last, tough people do. No matter how they push, pull, or dismantle, know that you can’t be broken. Remain resilient. 🙂
They say money talks. 💵💰👄	Mine just waves, G O O D B Y E. 👋🏽💸
Happy Birthday! I hope all of your birthday dreams come true! 💙🎈🎁🎊🎉🎂 https://t.co/ajkknaoLHG
To see a bird flying in the sky, that always make me smile. Freedom is the oxygen of the soul. Fly where your heart leads you. 🦅😍

@IAMANITABAKER You're such a veteran in the game! I'm tip my hat to you. You're my inspiration! Thank you for paving the way for many! 😇💙🎤🔥
You’re not designed for everyone to like you. Took me a while to learn that but then it gives life a balance so I’m not even complaining. ☺️
Next time you unfollow someone for having an imperfect day and venting, remember to be perfect for the rest of your life... BOOM!
I lost a follower? Nah... A follower lost me. 😊
It’s a #Jodeci kind of day. My iPod is jamming currently. 😌🎵🎶📱
People will always tell you what you do wrong but they are hesitant to compliment you for the many things you do right.
People who are intimidated by you talk bad about you with hopes that others won’t find you so appealing.
Sometimes a social media detox is needed.
I love my supporters, fans, and online community. You guys mean a lot to me! 🎤🙏🏽😇💙

Life is like an exam. Many people fail because they try to copy others not realizing that everyone have a paper with different questions.

It's always those that say "I'm not like other people" that hurt you even worse than the person before.
Maturity is when you bite your tongue &amp; deal with it. Remember, silence can never be misquoted. Silence is a great source of strength.
Never waste time explaining yourself to people who are committed to misunderstanding you.

When the chips are down, certain people only show their concern just to be in your business. A dog that brings a bone will always carry one.

People are always quick to bash what’s bad instead of promoting or acknowledging what’s actually good.
There is NO turning back whatsoever, you’ll miss whats in front of you. You’ll never know what’s ahead if you turn back to whats been done.
Some things in life are just meant to be left alone. Sometimes your HEART  needs more time to accept what your MIND already knows.
I could go for some @krispykreme today! I think I just might...🙈😋🍩
Those people that tried to bury you didn’t know you were a seed. 😏
Us earthlings are so negative &amp; divided on this planet, it’s hard to believe that we breathe the same air, it’s polluted with NEGATIVITY.
Your opinion is your opinion, your perception is your perception. Don’t get either one confused with “facts” or “truths”. 😒🙄
Your closest friends aren’t ALWAYS going to be close FOREVER.

How far I’ve come is nothing compared to how far I’m going.
Stop setting yourself up for disappointment from others.
Tried to define what the words “FAMILY” &amp; “FRIENDS” really mean, but the results were all pessimistic.
A nasty attitude can literally block blessings, love &amp; destiny from finding you. Don’t be the reason YOU don’t succeed.
If you think no one loves you, I do. #mondaymotivation
People that ignore or don’t even acknowledge you don’t even know who THEY really are as a person.
Remember, you are your own best friend, so you’d better take care of yourself first.

Relationships are harder now because conversations becomes texting, argument becomes phone calls &amp; feelings becomes statuses &amp; tweets.
If your actions do not prove the truth of your words, then your words are nothing more than lies.
Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud. Insecure people need the most attention &amp; are willing to lose respect for it. Be self-assured.
Knowing the truth, seeing the truth, but still choosing to believe a lie is pure stupidity.

If you rely on others, you can only go as far as they go. Don't rely on others to do what YOU already CAN do.
A bad attitude is like a flat tire. You won't go anywhere 'til you change it.
In any career or business, you have to always think long term! Connections open doors, relationships close deals. Always build your ladder!

If I cut you off, don't text me back months later saying "Hello" like nothing EVER happened. Show me disloyalty &amp; I'll show you detachment.
Every time a really successful song becomes a hit, that's when a lawsuit is filed... You can't sue someone for INSPIRATION... SMH! 😑
I just love being productive. 😊
The struggle you're in today will develop the strength you need for tomorrow. With all trials &amp; tribulations come change. Count it all joy.
Life and death is in the power of the tongue. Be careful what you speak into the atmosphere.
Don't blame people for disappointing you, Blame yourself for expecting too much from them. Expect less.
I know everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I wish I knew what that reason was.
Sometimes you just have to "don't know" &amp; "don't care". If it doesn't involve you, then it shouldn't concern you.
I don't like introducing myself. Do your research. Figure ME out.

In small petty arguments, it's not about whose wrong or right. It's about who can be the bigger person.
Life will teach you that nothing's permanent, not even life itself.
Why it that people feel so burdened before you ask them for a small favor? 😕😒

Speak with honesty. Think with sincerity. Act with integrity.
No one has ever made themselves great by showing how small someone else is. Never look down on someone unless you're helping them up.

Be careful how you treat people because if you fall into trouble, you'll never know how much a person can help you.
Some people will notice the change in YOUR attitude towards THEM but won't notice THEIR behavior that made YOU change.
Rudeness is a weak person's imitation of strength.
Work hard so there will be no need for an introduction or asking for support. When your work speaks for itself, let no one interrupt it.

I know there's a lot of people that fell out with me but STILL checking my page only to make sure I haven't made it yet. I see you! 👀😏😎✨
Can't wait to see @Rotimi &amp; @daedae at the #BETFanFront on Sat! #ATL make sure you RSVP now: https://t.co/OYElJk9OFn! See you there! 🍑
All these iOS updates and STILL no 3-way or conferencing for FaceTime.
Can't believe it's been 15 years already. Dearly departed #Aaliyah, you were such an angel! R.I.P. We miss you! 💐💛😇✨ https://t.co/12eOOOh9bh
Just caught up w/ my boy @BryanBreeding! I am so proud of you &amp; all of your endeavors! Keep making the tunes! Can't wait to work soon! 🎵🎧🎤💿
Any "friend" who has to show off on you to garner respect from their other friends is such a "throwback-to-first-grade" kind of friend. 🙄
Take me to the promised land. 😌
If you receive a DM from me, It IS AUTHORIZED from me or my management team. Not every PROPOSAL or PROPOSITION in a direct message is SPAM.
I can't with you @DorionRenaud 😂😂😂 #InTheCut @bouncetv
Free on Sat? #ATL Come chop it up with me &amp; BET for the #BETFanFront! RSVP at https://t.co/YovJnJN4cJ! Hope to see you there! 🍑 (via @BET)

Gosh, I don't know if I'm just being clumsy or lazy but I keep dropping things today. 😫😧
Life is so short. Be nice to everyone &amp; spread love! You never know a person's story until it's been shared. We're all going through LIFE! 😉
There's a lot of talented people here in Atlanta. WOW!
LOVE is POWER.
Real life situations is the combination to great lyrics. Back in the recording studio! 😊
It's funny how the people YOU THOUGHT didn't pay YOU ANY ATTENTION will quickly realize when they've been unfriended, unfollowed or blocked.
I find the unfriend, unfollow &amp; block button so therapeutic. All the unnecessary baggage is GONE. Feels like I've lost weight! 😂😂😂
Be a GOAL digger, not a GOLD digger.
#FridayFeeling great for me! Hope you all are having a great one! Enjoy! 😇✨
Treating other's badly will only create bad karma for yourself. Humble that heart of yours and spread love.
If you hating on me for trying to make it, you're also HATING on the HOLY SPIRIT for the blessings that he's sending towards my life.
I swear some young adults treat relationships as if they are still in JUNIOR HIGH. Kids don't know what REAL dates are.
When I was young I used to always say that I'd be signed to either LaFace Records, Badboy Records or So So Def. Those were my main picks. 🎵💿

The essence of social media is knowing your audiences and engaging them in something they love.
You can't stress yourself about things you can't control or change.

Heat and a very bad headache does NOT mix well together. 😭😖😩
The only way Snapchat can beat Instagram out is by having a longer time duration for their snap stories. Maybe 2 minutes, IDK. *shrugs* 😁😋

My Instagram feed is so off right now, the NEWEST posts are literally HOURS old. Anyone else having this issue? I hope this is fixed soon! 😩
One day the people who didn't believe in you will tell everyone they meet how they know you.
Sometimes your heart needs more time to accept what your mind already knows.
I asked the holy spirit to protect me from the enemies &amp; now I started losing friends.
When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.
You all need to give it a break with these #ArthurMemes. 👀😳
I wish people were bold enough to use their own faces as memes. Maybe it wouldn't be so funny then...

To a friend, achievements are great news. To an enemy, it's bragging. Be happy for ALL.
Bragging only means that you're not used to having it.
The better you feel about yourself, the less you need to show off. Real success isn't announced, it is SHOWN.

You can give a person knowledge, but you can't make them think. Some people want to remain fools, only because the truth requires change.
“Land of the FREE”?! “Home of the BRAVE”?! I always come to question about that. This should be “Land of the DIVIDED” &amp; “Home of the HATE”

Sometimes I wish certain platforms on social media allowed you to delete messages from the other parties device as well as yours. 😕😌
Holidays will definitely make you appreciate left-overs, especially when you have cooked enough food lasting you the rest of the week. 😂😂😂
Stop telling people you LOVE them when you really don't. Learn LOVE before you say it. It's sad LOVE is now an insignificant expression. 😑🙄

Life is like an echo. What you send out will return back. Keep putting out good. It will come back to you tenfold in unexpected ways. #Karma
Going to church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a garage makes you a car.
People say HATE is a strong word but LOVE is too and yet people continue to throw that around like its nothing. Don't LOVE me, LEARN me.
Life is a work in progress.
I am TOO nice. I need to become more OBSERVANT &amp; SILENT towards my surroundings &amp; others. You can REALLY learn a lot about other people.
Social media has created jealous behavior over illusions. Some of you are envious of things, relationships &amp; lifestyles that don't exist.
Sometimes you have to let the truth reveal itself instead of searching for a conclusion. Be level minded.

This is originality. You're way head of your time, @KingHaloCeasar! I love the 90s vibes with the futuristic sound. https://t.co/CfNLUy3vj4
You know you've got it going on when your presence fills a room “😎” &amp; unwelcomely facial expressions begins to shift. “😒”
Working on this @KennyEdmonds inspired track for my newest project. R&amp;B will be #1 again. #Babyface is my hero. 🙌🏽🎵✨ https://t.co/l7YxRDpziX
Be careful who your talk your business to. That person plays two major roles in the soap opera. “The Listening Ear” &amp; “The Running Mouth.” 😂
I had a dream last night that one of my songs “Stay With Me” was airing on the radio. This must be a sign... 🤔😉🙏🏽😇
Aspire to inspire before you expire. Have a valued purpose on your life &amp; existence. Don't waste time being idle. Lack of passion is fatal.
The soulful melodic tones I hear when I listen to @RaphaelSaadiq , @StokleyOfficial , &amp; @mynameis2long. 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽  I love music! 💙🎵✨

@Sophie_J_1990 Hmm personally I believe that there soon will be more female producers &amp; engineers. There's a lack of diversity in that area.
If I ever met Babyface, I think I'd cry my eyes out. I'm aiming to be the Babyface of this generation &amp; bring real contemporary R&amp;B back.

When I finished school I thought the immaturity level was behind me w/ my peers. Now I'm in the real world dealing w/ immaturity in adults.
If my absence doesn't affect your life then my presence has no meaning in it.
If you really want to do something, you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse. Sad but true.

We live in a very tainted world.
You can either say what you mean, mean what you say or don't say anything at all. It's that simple.
I woke up this morning &amp; prayed for a good 20 minutes. I found myself in tears after I was done. Always find time for your spiritual leader.
@RARE_FINE Never be afraid to express how you feel. 😊
When they don't know whats going on in your life, they speculate. When they think they know, they fabricate &amp; once they find out, they hate.
The reason we struggle with insecurity is because we compare our behind- the-scenes with everyone else’s highlight reel.
Sometimes, people try to expose what’s wrong about you because they can’t handle what’s right about you.
Why throw shade when you can shed some light!?
Throwing shade isn’t going to make YOU shine brighter.
It's important to take it one step at a time. Learn to never rush into things. Follow your limit! #RestrictedLimits 	https://t.co/kENS0RzVDh
