@wtylersandberg @KyleClark @alanfranklin Trump has the right electoral formula: support economic, social, military conservatism. Keep base engaged, fired up. He utilizes social conservatives as important part of presidency. Maintain clear contrasts with democrats.
@alanfranklin @wtylersandberg @KyleClark Last Republican to win Denver County in a statewide race: Bill Armstrong. Strong conservative principles, clear contrast.
@KyleClark @wtylersandberg @alanfranklin Tyler took a pretty conservative legislator and turned him into a strong moderate on social issues with the hope of winning CD6. Social conservatives felt frustrated and the energy wasn't there to support him. Don't compromise conservative principles to win races.
@KyleClark @wtylersandberg @alanfranklin To understand what Tyler is proposing to do to the GOP, you have to look at how Cynthia Coffman was received at the State Assembly. Abandoning social conservative principles will not get you anywhere among Republicans.
@KyleClark @wtylersandberg @alanfranklin Real frustrations among conservatives that Coffman did not support Trump and had moved to the left on social issues.
@wtylersandberg @alanfranklin The guy who handed CD 6 to the Democrats thinks he knows the future of the Republican Party. Is your future plan for Republicans to continue losing to Democrats or that they just become Democrats in their policies?

Opiates are riskier than cannabis, and the overdose deaths they cause are a more imminent crisis, so public and government attention have focused on them. Soon, the mental illness and violence that follow cannabis use also may be too widespread to ignore.
Yet 20 years ago, the U.S. moved to encourage wider use of cannabis and opiates. In both cases, we decided we could outsmart these drugs—enjoying their benefits without their costs. And in both cases, we were wrong.

11. Marijuana costs Coloradans $4.50 for every $1 of tax revenue. Some are getting rich while the rest of us are stuck with the bill. Not a good deal. https://t.co/e9OjmsdC8T
10. Not covered in this story are companies like @terrapincare. Marijuana companies have financial incentive to hook as many people as they can. Big Tobacco 2.0. They are looking for more daily use and higher THC potency. Not casual users, but heavy users.
9. Federal legalization won't end black market marijuana. Will invite more crime. We need massive public education campaign to understand risks and dissuade marijuana use.
8. Black market marijuana involves human trafficking and attacks on environment. Unauthorized fertilizers and pesticides are being used in national forests. We care deeply about people and wilderness in Colorado. Black market marijuana is harming both.
7. Marijuana has spread from Colorado to 34 states, mostly to Florida. I would like comment from the marijuana states-rights crowd about this. If CO gets the right to choose marijuana, what about states that don't want it? Who pays for the increase in enforcement in other states?
6. The marijuana industry calls the home-grow option a mistake. I wonder if libertarians and pro-pot groups will call Chris Woods of Terrapin Station a prohibitionist? @terrapincare
3. Black market marijuana is hiding in plain sight. Law enforcement is overwhelmed.	4. Black market marijuana is part of a larger crime syndicate that includes guns and human trafficking.	5. Foreign cartels are operating illegal marijuana grows in Colorado.
Takeaways: 	1. People in Colorado are frustrated. "This is not what we voted for" is conveyed throughout the video.	2. Politicians claiming they didn't expect this are lying. Those of us opposed to marijuana legalization said legalization would not get rid of the black market.

This is the lunacy of the pro-pot groups. Unwillingness to even admit any problems with pot. For them, it's a unicorn drug that solves all problems and paves streets with gold from tax revenue. Truth: harms people and is costly to taxpayers. https://t.co/by5o7M510E
@sportstalkmatt @KyleTurley No problem with medical cannabis but needs to be FDA approved, which it is doing. You conflate medical and recreational and that harms your arguments.

@sportstalkmatt @KyleTurley @USATODAY @kandavolu Yep. That's good news. Problem is it took 5 years to get there. For the first 5 years of legalization, arrest for marijuana possession of hispanic and african american youth went up.

@sportstalkmatt Marijuana has done nothing to dent opioid overdose in CO. In fact, drug overdose deaths in CO hit a record high in 2017. You're purely conjecture. Look at history of lung cancer from tobacco. Wasn't a major problem until mass commercialization. Marijuana is following same path.

Marijuana arrests decreased by 56% for Whites, 39% for Hispanics, and	51% for Blacks. The marijuana arrest rate for Blacks (233 per 100,000) was nearly double that of Whites (118 per 100,000) in 2017.		Arrest rates still higher for African Americans.
Colorado State Patrol: Summonses in which alcohol was the only substance decreased by 949 (‐20%). The number of summonses in which marijuana or marijuana‐in‐combination was recorded increased by 35 (5%) between 2014 and 2017.
Important. Society is not treating drugged driving like drunk driving. Fewer convictions.		These findings suggest that convictions are more common at the per se level for alcohol and at the permissible inference level for Delta‐9 THC.
In April 2018, there were 88,946 individuals registered as medical marijuana cardholders. The most common conditions reported were severe pain (93%), muscle spasms (31%), and severe nausea (14%).
Marijuana tax revenue remains about 1.7 % of tax revenue for state.		Total revenue from taxes, licenses, and fees increased from $67,594,325 in 2014 to $247,368,474 in 2017 (+266%).
In May 2018, 3,101 licensed marijuana businesses were registered in Colorado. Nearly 70% of the licenses for marijuana businesses were concentrated in the counties of Denver (1,226), El Paso (370), Pueblo (303), and Boulder (216).
Important benchmark: Of parents with children ages 1–14 who responded to the survey, 6.9% reported some type of marijuana product around the house.
Note that Senate Bill 12‐046 and House Bill 12‐1345 targeted reform of “zero tolerance” policies in schools, and appear to have decreased expulsions, suspensions, and referrals to law enforcement.
School discipline data for 2017‐18 indicated that marijuana accounted for 22% of all expulsions and 24% of all law enforcement referrals in Colorado public schools.
Data from the Colorado Department of Education show that that drug suspension rates increased from 391 (per 100,000 registered students) in the 2008‐09 school year to 551 in 2010‐ 11. The drug suspension rate fluctuated somewhat since then and was 507 in the 2017‐18 school year.
The proportion of 15‐ to 17‐year‐olds testing positive one or two times went down slightly, from 26% in 2012 to 25% in 2014, while those testing positive three or more times increased from 23% to 25%.
Data from the state Division of Probation Services indicated that the proportion of 10‐ to 14‐ year‐olds testing positive for THC one or two times increased from 19% in 2012 to 23% in 2014, while the proportion testing positive three or more times increased from 18% to 25%.
More good news, the number of juvenile marijuana arrests decreased 16%, from 3,168 in 2012 to 2,655 in 2017. This is different to other studies that have shown an increase in youth arrests, especially among Hispanic and African American youth.
Study sites Healthy Kids Colorado Survey regarding youth marijuana use rates. Good news, but problems with HKCS study. Leaves out major areas like Jefferson County.
The number of calls to poison control mentioning human marijuana exposure increased over the past 10 years. There were 45 calls in 2006 and 222 in 2017. Between 2014 and 2017, the frequency of calls reporting human marijuana exposure stabilized.
The period of retail commercialization showed an increase in emergency department visits, from 739 per 100,000 ED visits (2010–2013) to 913 per 100,000 ED visits (January 2014–September 2015).
Hospitalization rates (per 100,000 hospitalizations) with possible marijuana exposures, diagnoses, or billing codes increased from 803 per 100,000 before commercialization (2001‐2009) to 2,696 per 100,000 after commercialization (January 2014‐September 2015).
Reported 30‐day marijuana use by adults ages 26 years and older increased from 5% in 2005/06 to 14% in 2015/16.
Adults ages 18‐25 reported the highest past 30‐day usage rates (29.2%), followed by 26‐34 year olds (26.4%), 35‐64 year olds (12.5%), and those 65 years and older (5.6%).
Males have significantly higher past 30‐day use (19.8%) than females (11.2%).
More adults using marijuana: 		In 2017, 15.5% of adults reported marijuana use in the past 30 days, compared to 13.6% in 2014, a significant increase. Also, in 2017, 7.6% reported daily or near daily use. This compares to 6.0% in 2014, a significant increase.
More marijuana being shipped out to other states. What about states' rights?		The number of seizures for Colorado‐sourced marijuana reported to EPIC increased from 286 in 2012 to 608 in 2017.
More marijuana being illegally grown on public land: 		The number of plants seized on public lands increased. There were 80,926 plants seized in 2017, up 73% from 46,662 in 2012.
More people on probation using marijuana.		The proportion of 18 to 25 year‐old probationers testing positive for THC increased, from 32% in 2012 and 41% in 2017. The proportion of 36 and older probationers testing positive for THC also increased, from 14% in 2012 to 21% in 2017.
A 2017 survey conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found that 3.0% of adults reported driving within two‐to‐three hours of using marijuana in the past‐30 days, while 19.7% of recent marijuana users reported this behavior.
Marijuana related traffic fatalities still a major problem:		The number of fatalities with cannabinoid‐only or cannabinoid‐in‐combination	positive drivers increased 153%, from 55 in 2013 to 139 in 2017.
While overall DUIs are down,		The prevalence of marijuana or marijuana‐in‐combination identified by Patrol officers as the impairing substance increased from 12% of all DUIs in 2014 to 15% in 2017.
Organized crime court filings up big in Colorado. 		In terms of organized crime, the number of court filings charged with the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act (C.R.S.18‐17.104) that were linked to some marijuana charge increased from 31 in 2012 to 119 in 2017.
Marijuana arrests decreased by 52%. What you would expect when you legalize something.

@KyleClark @Rossputin @WalkerStapleton @jaredpolis You can claim he had all the justification in the world. He shoved a woman. And I think most men in that circumstance would call the police and let them track her down and sort it out.
@KyleClark @Rossputin @WalkerStapleton @jaredpolis I think you've got to be careful to claim "he debunked lies point by point" when Ross is entirely relying upon news reports. After you came out with your analysis, I went back and reread, reread the police report. Bottom line, Jared Polis shoved a woman. He even admits to that.
@KyleClark @Rossputin @WalkerStapleton @jaredpolis "The welt on her thigh she said was from Mr. Schutz pushing her back when she attempted to leave."
@KyleClark @Rossputin @WalkerStapleton @jaredpolis Ross admits he hasn't read police report. I've read a dozen times, I dont get how you guys miss this. "Mr. Shulz (Polis) then put both of his hands on her shoulders and pushed her back to prevent her from leaving."

What trade secrets was she trying to steal? What were the "sensitive company documents" that she was trying to steal? Why would she try to steal these documents? 4/

4. Drug legalization is ultimately about government dependency. Why George Soros is one of the strongest voices in favor of drug legalization.
3. The states rights argument on marijuana is a short stop to national legalization. A trick by liberals. When have Elizabeth Warren, Chuck Schumer, or Cory Booker ever cared about states rights?
@tomangell Do you support the rights of states not to legalize marijuana?
2. The minute marijuana is legal nationally, they will sue states that want to block it.
1. They dont care about states that are impacted by Colorado's illegal activities: Nebraska and other 35 states where Colorado weed is illegally shipped
I dont believe for a second that the marijuana industry cares about states rights. Reasons:
Drug legalization = government dependency. https://t.co/f5us0ufuRt

Bottom line, by allowing medical marijuana in schools, you are allowing a non-FDA approved, psychoactive drug with detrimental side effects to be consumed. Let the science lead!
3. We shouldn't let legislation get ahead of the science. Let the FDA lead to ensure the safety of both patients and other school children.
2. The FDA is clear that marijuana consumption, even medicinal marijuana, is harmful to brain development in young people.
1. Many of the drugs are non-FDA approved. We have no idea what the clinical side effects are, what happens when you combine marijuana with other drugs, and what the long-term effects are from consuming these drugs.

@MediaMarcus @SmartColorado Here is your argument: 	1. People are smoking and driving. They need better education.	2. MJ industry has education material about smoking and driving but its limited.	3. Let's create a place where people smoke then drive so we can provide better educational material.
@MediaMarcus @SmartColorado You don't need tasting rooms to do this! Why not provide better education at purchase points? This is a red herring. Bottom line, it's the bottom line! You want more people smoking pot and in this case, sacrificing public safety once more.
@MediaMarcus @SmartColorado Why not do that now at the point of purchase? Why allow people to smoke first than drive? Legalizing testing rooms doesn't require this at all.
@MediaMarcus @SmartColorado How are you protecting kids by putting stoned drivers behind the wheel?!

Improves openness and transparency for the division and the commission.
Increases the number of members on the commission to help improve participation from people other than Democrats or Republicans.
Senate version reduces political polarization on the commission by CREATING seats on the commission for Independents.  Coloradans who choose to not be Democrats or Republicans.
Nominating process requires bi-partisan participation in the appointment of members to serve on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission
This includes the Chairwoman of the Black Democratic Legislative Caucus of Colorado and members of the Colorado Democratic Latino Caucus.

@tomangell @AmericanLegion Tom - Did you see that the Chairman of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce admitted that smoked marijuana is harmful to developing brains. What say you?
@tomangell @AmericanLegion From AMA: This should not be viewed as an endorsement of state-based medical cannabis programs, the legalization of marijuana, or that scientific evidence on the therapeutic use of cannabis meets the current standards for a prescription drug product.
@tomangell @AmericanLegion The FDA has already determined that there is no medicinal value to smoked marijuana. As has The Institute of Medicine, American Society of Addiction Medicine, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Academy of Pediatrics, and others...
