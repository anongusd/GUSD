#CatoEvent in a nutshell: @CatoInstitute proves that they are carrying the ultra wealthy’s water. Keep building jails, but cut every other public service that ordinary average Americans rely on...that is Cato.
Are we living in the same century? Randall O'Toole said "I see cars as liberating people," then proceeded to recite statistics from the 1920s.  	Jarret Walker @humantransit commented, “Once you are stuck in traffic, it doesn't look like liberation. You are trapped.” #CatoEvents
During a discussion, @CatoInstitute's Randall O'Toole just claimed the average bus occupancy is nine - and that road pricing is the answer to congestion- not public transit. He has obviously never swiped a MetroCard in his life #CatoEvents

.@CynthiaNixon is a rich one-percenter trying to play the role of pro-trade union progressive and she's panned her own credibility.
Running for Governor doesn't mean someone gets a free ride when they talk out of both sides of their mouth, and people can't smack the hard-working men and women of this city in the face and expect to be trusted.
Which is it Cynthia? Do you really believe organized labor is a counter balance to corporate greed, or are they the cause of problems with the Subway?
Let's not forget she’s the candidate who tried to blame workers for subway issues and is on the record stating that unions need to give up concessions to make the subway work better.
Her statement in the #NYGovDebate that “...our labor unions are the most important counterbalance we have to unbridled corporate power and greed” flies in the face of her previous anti-union comments.
It's convenient for @CynthiaNixon to now posture as if she is a friend of labor, but her first instinct was to side with non-union real estate developers against workers.
Cynthia Nixon has no idea what she is talking about with the MTA - she has no idea how to manage large scale construction and capital programs. Andrew Cuomo is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the MTA and knows how to rebuild NY!

...but Pres Lombardo will continue the fight for infrastructure funding &amp; protecting @transportworker members #YouNeedaBACKBONE #1u
Today's #Senate hearing has ended...
@SenatorMenendez @USChamber thank you for your advocacy on this issue Senator.  Transit worker assaults are becoming an epidemic.
Assaults are definitely a distraction. @transportworker members have to think about how they will protect themselves. #YouNeedaBACKBONE #1u
On worker assaults question from @SenDonnelly: It's taken a tremendous effort for folks to just realize it's a problem. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
The average American needs good, quality work that they feel is satisfying and long term #YouNeedaBACKBONE
.@Mels_Wells absolutely Melissa. President Lombardo stressed this to the Committee earlier and will continue to do so. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
@transportworker wants to see a requirement that all new vehicles have these protective measures.  #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Assaults on @transportworker transit workers are becoming an epidemic. Its unsafe for our members, its unsafe for riders. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
On P3s question: We should look at anything that can help, but not that helps on the backs of our riders and our members. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
On P3s question: we think there is some use, but they can lead to service cuts, lower wages, elimination of pensions.  #YouNeedaBACKBONE
.@SenShelby on behalf of @transportworker, thank you for having me.
Lets end this 20 year debate for a sustainable, long-term solution &amp; lets get #America moving again! #YouNeedaBACKBONE
I have a simple message today: lets find those on each side of the aisle with a backbone #YouNeedaBACKBONE
If we collectively have a BACKBONE &amp; confront the problem we can create a bipartisan solution to invest in Americas future #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Public private partnerships aren’t a panacea. In many cases, transit P3’s threaten the #public interest #YouNeedaBACKBONE
We need basic critical funding. Operating cuts threaten public #transportation systems. #Congress shouldn’t tolerate it. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
We must provide operating assistance, temporary &amp; targeted, in addition to capital investment. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
We need #Congress to prioritize the safety of riders &amp; our operators. Install plexiglass barriers. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
These assaults can't continue. Working class Americans shouldn't go to work every day fearing for their safety on the job. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
On average, there are over 200 reported physical assaults/year against bus operators in #NYC &amp; #Philadelphia combined. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
We must prioritize the health &amp; safety of our workforce &amp; address the increasing number of assaults on our operators #YouNeedaBACKBONE
The time has come. We need to act!  We need a long-term sustainable program. We need to fund the program. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
We all know the gravity of the situation we face, yet we've failed to have a BACKBONE on this issue for over 20 years #YouNeedaBACKBONE
By not investing we close the door on our future &amp; pass debt &amp; burden to our kids &amp; grandkids. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Businesses pay $27 billion/year in extra freight transportation costs, increasing shipping delays &amp; raising product prices #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Americans spend 5.5 billion hours in #Traffic a year, costing families over $120 billion in extra fuel &amp; lost time. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Failure to invest in #infrastructure has horrendous consequences. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Where is our backbone? Where is our commitment to the future? #YouNeedaBACKBONE
That dream is at risk for future generations b/c we aren't upholding our responsibility to them to invest in THEIR future. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
We believe ALL Americans are entitled to the #americandream regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
.@transportworker has been the backbone of worker struggles: equality, human/civil rights, workplace safety &amp; work rules #YouNeedaBACKBONE
Now I am the @transportworker international president. This is indeed an amazing country. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
I began as a car cleaner, worked hard &amp; moved up through the union: rail mechanic, shop steward, business agent #YouNeedaBACKBONE
I grew up in #Philadelphia &amp; as a young man I learned quickly you needed a backbone to move ahead. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
.@transportworker members serve as the BACKBONE of the transit, air &amp; rail systems in this country. #YouNeedaBACKBONE
