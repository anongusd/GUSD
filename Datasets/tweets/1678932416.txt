RT @kathrynw5: Today, in congressional hearings: https://t.co/JRsysABJCZ
~reminder that Cohen also worked for Sean Hannity~
"I actually never thought this was going to be happening," Cohen says, an evergreen quote.
Dem Jamie Raskin says that Republicans aren't upset with Cohen because he lied to Congress for Trump ‚Äì "they‚Äôre upset because you stopped lying to Congress for the president."
I asked Roger Stone about Cohen's allegations that Trump knew that Stone was in touch with WikiLeaks about dumping damaging Democratic emails ahead of the 2016 election. "Mr. Cohen‚Äôs statement is not true,‚Äù Stone said.
"He is both good and bad, as do we all, but the bad outweighs the good," Cohen says of Trump. "And since he has taken office, he as become the worst version of himself."
"Mr. Cohen's testimony is the beginning of the process, not the end," Cummings says. "The days of this committee protecting the president at all costs are over."
Cummings says that if Cohen lies during his testimony, he "will be the first one to refer those untrue statements to DOJ." He says that if Cohen lies, "he has a lot to lose."

He also says it's unlikely that the digital equivalent of a Pearl Harbor or 9/11 would "wake up" the nation to cyber threats, adding that Americans are "already living those events on a daily basis."
Warner calls for the US to direct more defense spending toward cyber threats, saying that the cost for Russia to interfere in the US and French elections as well as Brexit is less than the cost of one new F-35.
Mark Warner is giving an address on the US cyber doctrine this morning. He's calling for the US to create stronger international alliances to combat cyber threats, but says America has fallen on the global stage on the topic.
I for one am looking forward to George Papadopoulos's tell-all about his time in prison, the lessons he learned and the friends he made along the way
A couple things that didn‚Äôt make it:	- Someone asked Stone his take on QAnon; he said he doesn‚Äôt have one	- Laura Loomer was there too (no handcuffs in sight)
Here‚Äôs my story wrapping up the event, thanks for following along: https://t.co/5bnBs00zTw
@IamMayaImani @wevarts That isn‚Äôt Roger, but there‚Äôs a photo in this thread of him
And that's a wrap on Stone, gets big cheers from the crowd
the crowd is loving this btw, everyone's taking photos and cheering him on, especially when he praises Trump
Stone is going after Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Dem on the House Intel Committee, saying that the congressman is "full of schiff" (sounds a little familiar https://t.co/DfUSdn3GCC)
Stone is up now. He said he was ‚Äúproud‚Äù to see Trump‚Äôs tweet praising him for his ‚Äúguts‚Äù and dismissed legal analysts who said it could be considered witness tampering. https://t.co/DtMvTNceA7
Burns ends his talk by reciting the pledge of allegiance and leading a chant of "USA." Roger Stone is set to speak next.
"Aren't you glad that we have a president who is a nationalist, and a nationalist is not a racist," Burns says to cheers from the crowd (more people have come in, there's about 30 people here now)
Pastor Mark Burns is talking to the crowd now -- says it's "normal to lose the House" but that Republicans can't let a Democrat be the next president
@willsommer the crowd is very interactive -- Mark Burns is talking now and he says he doesn't need a big crowd to get him fired up
@ciaobellaalora He‚Äôs scheduled to talk any minute now
From my count there are about a dozen people in the crowd, and roughly the same amount of media

And that's a wrap! Thanks for following!
In closing statement, Feinman says it's important to have voices in the SA, to have people together, working together
Giordano in closing statement thanks for insightful questions, reiterates importance of student advocacy, creating culture of student input
Feinman said she wants to expand role of diversity in SA to have those students involved and make sure their voices are being heard
Giordano says that as a person of color, she can represent the multicultural community, and will reach out to other groups that she's not in
Final question: how can you fairly represent rights of minority groups that you're not a part of?
Giordano says she wants to understand where administrators are coming from, make sure student life is at forefront of admin's minds
Feinman says it's ok to push back against administrators and students "deserve to know why decisions are being made"
Moderator asks what candidates will do when they get a "hard no" on issues
Feinman, a member of @gwphisigmasigma, says Greek life rep is important but shouldn't be done at expense of other communities on campus
Giordano, a member of @GWADPi, says Greek life is important and isn't overrepresented, and that Greek life is at forefront of platform
Vogel asks if candidates if Greek life has too much influence on policies
Feinman said she would like to work on programs while still in the senate and find other outlets to make sure that advocacy continues
Giordano said she can see Feinman as part of cabinet or as another student leader
Vogel asks how the candidate that doesn't win will support the new president
Giordano says she's looking at innovative ways to solve problems despite issues
Feinman said she has created relationships throughout campus
Vogel asks candidates how they felt about @gwhatchet endorsement
Feinman says she'll support community by looking into getting staff member dedicated to student recovery org, cites referral service again
Giordano says she'll create more substance free housing on campus and making it clear that there are student options to ask for help
Candidates are asked how they'll support students with mental health issues and in recovery
Feinman said that she didn't want to rush it, wants to work out details before creating referendum
Vogel asks why Feinman didn't put referendum on ballot to create new VP position, which is required
(those positions aren't for students who run as candidates btw, they're appointed and approved by the senate)
Feinman says she will create more director and vice presidential positions to give students more opportunities to get involved
She cites the past SA successes like moving health center to the Marvin Center as messages she'd share with potential candidates
Giordano said she wants to do more outreach, one-on-one work and sharing value of SA to get more candidates next year
.@jeanin3 says this year is one of the least contested SA elections, what candidates would do to get more people to run next year
Giordano said she has shown initiative to take on leadership roles in her own orgs, and would promote those for other students
She cites work on sexual assault referendum and reaching out to new admins to create platform
Giordano says she wants to be "connector" to get students in room with admins
Feinman says she's worked with admins across the board to get her SA measures passed
Feinman cites experience as Greek house manager, creating new training
.@desiderioDC asks why candidates are "best equipped" to get through administrative red tape
Giordano says tomato, Feinman says carrot (tomato is a fruit, FYI)
Maggie May from @TheRivalGW asks "if you were a vegetable, which one and why"
Former SA presidents Julia Susini and @NickGumas have been referenced as role models several times during this debate
Giordano said she decided to run because of past experiences, eg sponsoring sexual assault prevention training referendum as biz school sen
(FYI I'm keeping these fact checks equal for the candidates #news #neutrality)
Feinman said she learned of importance of SA through other student orgs and what other student leaders have done
.@JennaSpoont asks when candidates decided to run
Giordano isn't able to cite a specific example from this year, but lists example from several years ago - likely under Ashwin Narla
.@jeanin3 asks Giordano for specific example of SA not following through on promises
Feinman is citing cuts to program as BOT impact, but those cuts are made in schools, not by the Board
@hgil @_colleenmurphy_ funny enough, they haven't mentioned it!
Feinman says would've been easier to rescind Cosby degree with student rep
.@jeanin3 asks about Board of Trustees representation, asking for a specific Board decision in recent years that students could've changed
Feinman said she also wants to decrease copay for health services and create referral system for off-campus health care options
Feinman said she's also being realistic, calling for cheaper double-sided printing
Giordano says she's keeping her goals "realistic"
Giordano says she wants to reroute Colonial Express, create textbook pledge to help cut down on extra costs for students
.@desiderioDC asks about college affordability, which all candidates have talked about for several election cycles
Giordano says she wants to be remembered for changing the student experience, and not for her own name specifically
Feinman says that's not her focus, but wants to be remembered for culture change
.@TheRivalGW asks what the candidates want their legacy to be
Feinman "respectfully disagrees" on platform differences, but says she differs in lobbying students
Giordano said her platform is different bc she has "promises she can actually follow through on"
another fact check - all of Giordano's points also apply to undergrads and aren't specifically for grad students
Giordano said she's included grad students in all parts of her platform, including keeping book costs low and improving alumni relationships
Quick fact check - trustee bylaws ban student rep and many grad students are employed full time and don't necessarily need intern funds
Feinman said she wants one grad student on Board of Trustees, and increasing size of internship fund
.@jeanin3 asks about representation for graduate students, which haven't been specifically mentioned in platforms
Feinman says top priority is getting student rep on Board of Trustees
Giordano says her top concern is making sure there's a platform for student voices, "not just tweeting at @GWPeterK"
.@desiderioDC asks what each candidates top priority is
Giordano adds that she will make sure UPD will not patrol off campus and cites other campus issues
Giordano says she agrees, esp about including more student voices, says she will reach out to all communities and orgs to increase rep
Feinman says access to resources and right to rep are in danger and that she'd like to address them all
.@TheRivalGW asks how candidates will protect student rights on campus
Feinman says she will create more positions for students to advocated for themselves
Feinman says the disconnect is also big issue, but says student representation also needs to happen
Giordano says there is big disconnect btwn students and admins, says will create forum to establish those connections
.@JennaSpoont asks what biggest problem for students on campus is
.@ChristinaForGW and @erikaforgw now take the stage, the only two presidential candidates left
BREAKING Tony Hart has dropped out of presidential race
.@ThomasForEVP is done! Now switching to presidential candidates
Falcigno says he would want new SA president to listen to students, maintain good relationships
Vogel asks question about fossil fuel referendum and if Falcigno will support it - a ballot question from last year, not this one
Falcigno says his role as interim EVP was to keep the senate functioning
Falcigno says budget cuts are a "reality" but says SA needs to make student priorities clear, still will be an "uphill battle"
Falcigno says he won't "get on his knees" for administrators
Falcigno said he thinks relationships with admins are a good thing, but cites record of student advocacy
Falcigno continues to stress having an active senate throughout his replies
Vogel asks how Falcigno will keep vice presidency fresh, Falcigno said his goals "will take a long time" esp improving affordability
Falcigno said he expects senators to be doing work and he will remove any inactive senators - "if they're not doing work then get out"
Falcigno said he wants to improve senate efficiency, eg removing inactive senators
.@jeanin3 from @gwhatchet asks how Falcigno's experience as EVP since January has helped his platform
Falcigno said he's been spending his time "focusing on the issues" and researching his platform - and sleeping more than other candidates
.@desiderioDC from @GWTV asks how Falcigno has been using his ability as an unopposed candidate to his advantage
He says they should be advocating to lower costs and is "tired of being reactive"
Falcigno says he's including mental health under his affordability policies
Maggie May from @TheRivalGW asks about how he'll work on mental health
Falcigno says many students don't take advantage of current policies bc they're not needed, but grade forgiveness is
.@ThomasForEVP cites a business school and peer institutions' policies that allows students to retake one course from their freshman year
.@JennaSpoont from @WRGW asks about @ThomasForEVP's freshman forgiveness policy
.@ThomasForEVP is running on reducing costs, a grade forgiveness program and including more students in administrative meetings #GWVotes
