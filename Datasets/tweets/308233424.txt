Trump: “Sean Hannity is a great supporter of what I do. Ann Coulter — I barely know her. She’s off the reservation. Tucker Carlson has been great.”
Pres Trump: “If you don’t have a border, you don’t have a country. So we will be sued. And we’ll win. I think.”
I really think Pres Trump has lost it. Really lost it.
If two guys in white coats carrying nets suddenly appeared next to Trump, I would not be surprised.
Many of Trump's speeches ramble, but this really sounds like he's making it up as he goes  along.
Trump: "We're talking about an invasion of our country!"
Trump: "It's a lie. A tremendous lie. They say walls don't work. They work 100 percent!"

Orrin Hatch: “This is worse than Bork; I didn’t think things could get worse than Bork. This is worse than Clarence Thomas; I didn’t think things could get worse than Clarence Thomas.”
John King: “Brett Kavanaugh went full Trump today.”	Good line.
Could it be that Judge Kavanaugh is emotionally unsuited for the high court? And he is showing it over and over?
Kavanaugh: “My reputation has been destroyed! It has been destroyed forever.”	And he thought all it was going to be was a lifetime job with good medical.
Kavanaugh hostilely to Sen Whitehouse: “What do you like to drink? What do you like to drink, senator!”	Let the record show that Kavanaugh is losing it.
“I’m innocent! I’m innocent of these charges!” Judge Kavanaugh wails. “This thing was sprung on me!”	As a rookie reporter, I covered Criminal Courts and I used to hear that all the time.
Sen. Leahy points out that Judge Kavanaugh is very good at one thing: He doesn’t answer questions asked by Democrats.
If Kavanaugh drinks any more water during this hearing, he’s going to drown.

Fox News is very unhappy with how this hearing has gone so far. What does that tell you?
Sen. Grassley and his Goon Squad have really booted it. Dr. Ford is winning the nation over with her quiet, sincere answers.
Keep in mind throughout this show trial that Judge Kavanaugh is Donald Trump’s enthusiastic choice for the Supreme Court. Does that fill you with confidence?
The format for this outrage shows why the GOP cannot run a country let alone a Senate hearing.
Dr. Ford is sadly correct: She has jumped in front of a train and risks annihilation by her powerful Republican foes.

Obama: “If you don’t like what’s going on now - - and you shouldn’t - - don’t hashtag, don’t binge, don’t boo...get out and vote!	In the last election fewer than one in five young people voted. The current government doesn’t represent you? That’s why!”

What phony words is Trump's staff going to write for him now? What baloney will they try to sell us now? All they can do is resign en masse.
Rarely has a president revealed his true, seething, hate-filled inner core as Trump did Tuesday.
Trump won't condemn the racist, anti-semitic alt-right.	He says alt-left, which believes in climate change &amp; civil rights, is just as bad.
Trump Saturday: Hatred in Charlottesville on many sides.	Trump Monday: Hatred on right was the problem.	Trump Tuesday: Hatred on many sides.
Whatever good Trump did for himself Monday has been erased today. 	That is because today we are seeing the true Trump.
"There is blame on both sides," Trump said today. "Washington was a slave owner. Jefferson was slave owner. Do we take down their statues?"
"What about the alt-left that came charging with clubs at the alt-right?" Trump said Tuesday. "Not all people on alt-right were racists."

The question remains: Did Russian gov try to interfere with our 2016 election or not? 	Session's recusal does nothing to answer that. https://t.co/ubeZdxSxOV
Sessions says he might have given wrong information under oath "because he was taken aback."	Yeah, a jury will sure buy that.
Sessions says he turned down a lunch offer with Russian ambassador.	How did he do that? "I don't eat lunch with Commies!"
Sessions told Russian ambassador he went to Russia in 1991 with his church group.	Somehow, I don't think that is being investigated.
Sessions: "So in the end, I have followed the right procedure."
Sessions ethics staff suggests recusal and he will go along.
Is it possible for Sessions to recuse himself from everything for the next four years and just draw a paycheck?
U.S. Code states that whoever gives "aid and comfort" to our enemies "is guilty of treason and shall suffer death...."	Hear that, Jeff?

At end of debate, Trump initiates a farewell handshake and even gives Hillary an elbow squeeze.
Hillary actually remembers the name of the questioner - - "Mr. Carter - - and uses it. She has learned a thing or two about debating.
Trump is so lucky the questions got off of Aleppo. He couldn't find Aleppo on a map. Or spell it.
Trump mentions his close relationship with his running mate regarding Syria policy: "He and I haven’t spoken and I disagree."
Trump is going to need two or three shovels to dig his way out of the hole he is digging.
Isn't this the first time Trump has admitted not paying federal income tax for nearly 20 years?

Chris Matthews: "Pence tonight made himself the frontrunner for the 2020 Republican nomination." #VPDebate
Pence won't defend Trump's line that women who have abortions should be punished.	"He's not a polished politician," Pence says. #VPDebate
“If only Trump would release his tax returns,” Kaine says for umpteenth time.	Pence sadly shakes head for the umpteenth time. #VPDebate
Mike Pence really likes the word "feckless." Which is fine if you happen to know what it means. And, no, it doesn't mean "without feckles."
Summary of debate so far:	Pence: "Let me finish a sentence!" #VPDebate
Pence: "Donald Trump supports our troops."	Kaine: "He won't pay his taxes!"
Kaine: "Hillary has the ability to stand up to Russia in a way that (Trump's) team does not." #VPDebate
Kaine interrupts Pence a lot more than Pence interrupts Kaine - - and it works. #VPDebate
Pence after Kaine attack line: "Did you work on that one a long time? It was a good one." #VPDebate
Kaine: "Donald Trump can’t start a twitter war with Miss Universe without shooting himself in the foot." #VPDebate
Pence says no insult Trump has used so far compares with Hillary's "basket of deplorables" insult. #VPDebate
Kaine: "Trump has called women slobs, pigs, and dogs. I don’t like to say that in front of my wife."	I think maybe your wife read about it.
Pence: "My uncle was a cop in downtown Chicago."	If you can't praise yourself, praise a relative. #VPDebate
Kaine: "Trump said he would release his taxes. He has broken his promise."	Pence: "That wasn’t a promise. He (just) said he’d do it."
Kaine: "When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, Gov. Pence, do you know Osama bin Laden was alive?"	Pence: "Yes." #VPDebate
Both Kaine &amp; Pence bash the "insult-driven" campaigning of their opponent. Insults? Have there been insults in this campaign? #VPDebate

Trump needed to be an 11 for this debate.	So far, he's been around a 4.
Only about a half-hour left and Trump has not found a strategy to win his first one-on-one debate.
Trump: "It's terrible what's been going on in Chicago. I have property there."	Well, as long as he keeps his priorities straight.
Hillary: "I have met a lot of people who have been stiffed by you. Are they not owed an apology?"	Actually, they are owed money.
Trump has almost finished that first glass of water.	HE MUST HAVE DOUBLE PNEUMONIA!
Trump: "We are in a big, fat, ugly bubble."	Who is he describing?
Hillary: Join the debate by saying more crazy things.	Donald: It’s not crazy
Hillary: I knew there would be all kinds of assertions and claims.	Donald: Facts.
Hillary: "Donald, I know you live in your own reality."
Trump drinking water. Sniffing. Testy. HE MUST HAVE PNEUMONIA!
Hillary: Donald was one of the people who rooted for the collapse of housing. Donald: That’s called business by the way.
Hillary decides to go negative first. Trump's eyes narrow. Get ready to rumble.

Now Trump is back to "take the oil." Why? "To the victor belongs the spoils."	This would be a joke if it weren't so serious.
Trump says he went to Mexico "and let them know where the United States stands."	Private citizens aren't really supposed to do that.

Trump says we must choose only those immigrants "who love us" into the country. I assume this means they have to love him, too.
