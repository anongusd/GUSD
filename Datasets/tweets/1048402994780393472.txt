@mrsg_who @RotzPumpe @GregRubini I think he is the type that money would corrupt. Again I am making serious judgments about him based on my intuition with no evidence so I could be wrong.
@GregRubini I can see him doing that.
@mrsg_who @RotzPumpe @GregRubini I have other thoughts/hunches about him that I won‚Äôt say.  Intuition I just think he may be part of revelation events. And not the good part. I hope I am wrong on this. He has ill advised Potus many times and ran off a really good staff member that could have been a real help.

@Rosehips5 @GregRubini I agree.  I have been screaming this for months.  My spirit just screams red flags when I just look at him. I think he is a lifelong plant in that family.  I don‚Äôt like him at all. He gives me the creeps.

@RotzPumpe @GregRubini Ps I think he or Pence leaked his schedule. He does too much overseas with foreign countries. I think he might be making behind the scene deals.  He could be Jewish spy plant.
@RotzPumpe @GregRubini Yes!!! I have so many red flags about him I have posted several times about him &amp; tweeted Trump saying don‚Äôt listen to him as we did not elect him. Isn‚Äôt he Jewish? I am totally 150% Team Jew but I know there is a bad faction that seeks to control. Feel he wants power.
