@DWB998 It's less about abrasive style but more about not treating everything as an attack on the movement he created. He purposely danced around the question because he didn't want to answer it.
The question had nothing to do with your platform or the movement you created but of course, you had to bring it up because you couldn't come up with a reasonable response to a question about sexual harassment.

Tbh running for the Senate is a good idea for DeGette. She's at an in-between age and in a low ranking roll in leadership (Chief Deputy Whip) meaning she'd likely gets 2-3 terms in the Senate and has a decent chance of accruing a decent amount of power rather than just staying...

@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa I'd agree it was poor communication skills if they made the mistake once and didn't make it again and again and again.
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa It has nothing to do with them being Muslim. It has to do with their repeated encounters with antisemites and their continued use of antisemitic tropes. Yes, Omar apologized but then immediately negated her apology by slamming the people who called her out in the first place.
@SenhorRaposa Also, I'd rather focus on ousting Suozzi and Rice than targeting Engel.
@IAmKrishanPatel @SenhorRaposa I agree his Engel point is wrong but your second point about Omar and Tlaib is incorrect. I mean they've been condemned in a bipartisan fashion at times and it had nothing to do with them being Muslim.
@Yukongold1898 @SenhorRaposa Some person named Kenny Belvin. He apparently is who a lot of activist groups are getting behind.
@lnsiebert Exactly.

@districtdiatric @kkeeltygartland I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt dislike her but for me personally I just find her entire rise to power fascinating. She sort of became an icon by accident and on some issues she was ahead of the curve especially on guns.
@kkeeltygartland I mean that would also be true of like 90% of our senate caucus currently. I think it‚Äôs just worthy to note that she has done some significant things whether you are fond of her or not.
@districtdiatric @kkeeltygartland A lot of democrats screwed up in those years and I mean she clearly moved in the right direction eventually. Which is what we want in the end.
@districtdiatric @kkeeltygartland I mean that‚Äôs discouraging but doesn‚Äôt make it any less impressive that she was able to get a bill of that magnitude through Congress 25 years ago. In a literal sense but symbolically the bill still carries a ton of weight.
@districtdiatric @kkeeltygartland I mean it was kind of a radical bill back then and considering we couldn‚Äôt even get the Manchin-Toomey bill through Congress it makes it fairly impressive or at least notable. I mean it also allows us to prove that when it was in existence it worked.
@kkeeltygartland Yeah it was twisted logic I‚Äôm not saying I agree with it but you had to work with what you could do. There weren‚Äôt votes to do it permanently.
@kkeeltygartland Because of the filibuster. I mean she obviously didn‚Äôt personally want it to sunset but at the time it was the only way it would pass.
@kkeeltygartland I mean she was the driving force behind the assault weapons ban and the torture report. I know people‚Äôs opinions of her are mostly a split based on where you lie ideologically within the Democratic Party but she has done things that are fairly significant.

@IAmKrishanPatel @matt_mollinedo @SenhorRaposa @ElectionBabe She definitely can, she has the ability to know she's done something wrong in that she's acknowledged mistakes she's made in the past in a rather frank manner.
@matt_mollinedo @SenhorRaposa @ElectionBabe I agree with you I think she was out of line and was profoundly patronizing to them. That being said it's ok to not support the green new deal as a Democrat. Many people in our party have different tactics for the climate crisis.

@AbrasiveObelisk I think he could pull an upset and we could definitely do better than a failed candidate. Any state legislator I think would prove to be more formidable. Plus his rural bona fides are overrated considering who he was running against.
@AbrasiveObelisk A convention would favor king because it would mostly be comprised of King allies from his district.
@AbrasiveObelisk Eh I think we can do better than him. I‚Äôd rather he run for Kings seat again because I think it is decently likely the IA-04 goes to a convention considering he has multiple R challengers. If no one gets more than 35% it goes to a primary.
@LVview PPP is biased first off and McConnell tends to poll poorly in the beginning due to low approvals. That being said the partisan lean of the state particularly in a presidential year is too much to overcome for a democrat.

@GabeTheCentrist @Mark55____ That she hasn't denied. Plus with the volume of allegations that have come out, it's hard to believe they are false.
@LVview @jackcurran49 I mean Gillum had trouble with South Florida Cubans because he was lambasted as a socialist. It worked but he still only lost narrowly it could have easily gone the other way. Sanders is different but it proves that even with opposition from those voters the race is still close.
@ryan_hassett @phanthanhtom She's already winding up with a binder in her hand.
@LVview Yeah, my personal preferences.
Oh I forgot about Sanders 		1.) Gillibrand	2.) Buttigieg	3.) Warren	4.) Castro	5.) Harris	6.) Sanders	7.) Booker	8.) Klobuchar
@LVview @jackcurran49 It still is destined to be close meaning we can't rule out a narrow victory for either side.
@LVview @jackcurran49 Yes, but it by no means rules out the state completely. It certainly narrows the path though.
2020 preferences ranked:		1.) Gillibrand	2.) Buttigieg	3.) Warren	4.) Castro	5.) Harris	6.) Booker	7.) Klobuchar		(This is not set in stone and will definitely change)

@phanthanhtom Soubry I think will be the hardest person to deal with because she's fairly tart-tongued and doesn't really get in line but other than that most other MP's seem like they could become very rank and file.
@phanthanhtom No one does but they are automatically still hurting Labour just because they are probably going to pull votes from a lot of marginal labour seats.
@phanthanhtom I think Umuna being the face of the party makes them a lot more palatable to voters.

@politicsluo I guess I‚Äôm sympathetic to her shift because it made sense and was somewhat justifiable considering she represented a ruby red district. She also shifted very left at the heart of the tea party wave which not even main stream democrats were doing at the time.
@politicsluo Yeah I guess but I mean Booker is still lousy in some policy areas while she‚Äôs shifted and has shown no signs of reverting back to her house days.

@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom The last part leaves no wiggle room for any mistakes or issues.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom Help but the question is whether that will pull them out of the likely ditch that they are in.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom I guess for me I don‚Äôt see it as a bad decision but something that is done in an effort to achieve what you want. I think that difference of opinion is probably why we aren‚Äôt seeing eye to eye on this.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom It is if everything goes to plan. It doesn‚Äôt really account for any hiccups along the way and there are always destined to be bumps in the road per se.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom Yes I agree with that but my point is that‚Äôs a strategy for some but won‚Äôt work for everyone in that position financially.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom My vagueness wasn‚Äôt intentional btw and since tweets can be unintentionally snarky I‚Äôll just say this is meant as a clarification not as an attack.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom Any student that perhaps isn‚Äôt quite on a track to reach the academic level to go to a 4 year institution for free (after going to CC) or for minimal cost is stuck and there definitely are a decent portion of people in that type of bind.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom I mean it‚Äôs all depending on the student so I don‚Äôt think you could say that generally. Either way a decent portion is excluded.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom It‚Äôs a baby step but it‚Äôs not going to cause a sea change in that people all of a sudden won‚Äôt be teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom Yes but still that works for a fraction of the people who I would need to go that route. It may work for you or me but it also cuts out anyone that isn‚Äôt quite at that academic level to go on that path.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom We‚Äôre already on pace to have a vast portion of my generation to be in financial ruin which is just a recipe for economic turmoil should we not do something drastic.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom I mean I‚Äôd be open to other remedies that are more means based but growing up in a perhaps impoverished area or having parents that won‚Äôt pay for your education doesn‚Äôt fall under the irresponsible category.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom I congratulate you on your hard work but a particularly subjective example doesn‚Äôt really tackle the issue of student loan debt in its entirety.
@duckquack20 @Tepper_Dylan @phanthanhtom Because it‚Äôs not a one size fits all issue. Yes we should reward hard work but no ones education should be confined to what they can afford. You end up propping up a small group meanwhile people that don‚Äôt reach that level academically or financially are automatically in a bind.

You realize you have no chance of winning the nomination in 2020 right?

@rev_avocado from voting for Kavanaugh to voting for DeVos.
@rev_avocado That's why Hummel is intriguing she can channel a story that not only makes her appealing but gets rid of one of Sullivan's biggest selling points which is his military service. Once you undercut his biggest selling point it makes it easier to then penalize him for everything...
@rev_avocado That alone won't be enough in a double-digit trump state. Yeah, it's helpful but still, that alone isn't large enough baggage to bring him down. I personally think someone who can match Sullivan's military record negates a whole narrative that he's going to try to use in 2020.
@rev_avocado Because Sullivan doesn't have nearly as much baggage as Young. We shouldn't just waste Galvin's talent on what probably will be a tougher race. Sullivan is largely inoffensive and for all intents and purposes not overly vulnerable while Young is.
@rev_avocado I'd like to see her go up against him again. Young is an institution but I think she proved that he isn't totally untouchable per se. Plus I think she'd be the best candidate we could put up against him.

The only side effect I guess is we'll have to field a new candidate against Carter but that's not the end of the world. We could definitely find someone decent enough.
She already has a huge fundraising base and obviously has an amazing story to tell.

@Deve_Dy @AbrasiveObelisk @SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel Yeah, I'll probably do the same but I am sort of dreading a nasty primary that comes to its conclusion in August.
@Deve_Dy @AbrasiveObelisk @SenhorRaposa @IAmKrishanPatel Basically, I just think both Kelly and Gallego have their own risks so I'd just rather go with someone like Stanton. He at least is pretty progressive with the credentials to show for it and probably is more marketable statewide.

@_Political_Nerd Um definitely
@LikeIGive_Adam Yeah, she'd be a good option I'm not denying that. I definitely think it would be a good idea to run a woman against Sullivan anyway.
@LikeIGive_Adam Beto I guess we can wait but with the moves he's been making it seems like he's either going to jump into the presidential race or not run at all. Hopefully, you're right and he may come to his senses and run against Cornyn but at the present moment at least it seems unlikely.
@LikeIGive_Adam What I meant is that if someone was unlikely to run I wouldn't mention them but I would float names that haven't expressed interest just because it seemed like there weren't too many options otherwise.
@LikeIGive_Adam I would put Beto I just don't think he'll run. Ivy Spohnholz is another good option but I think Hummel's military credentials could really be a big asset against Sullivan.
I know this may have been a massive waste of time but I figure with the seats that we might end up failing to recruit in it was worth my while to try and dig a little deeper and see if there were other options.
might be able to make inroads against Daines since he has an interesting background and possibly could attract younger voters due to his younger age etc.

I figure someone who can match Sullivan's military record might have a small opening plus it would be a decent idea to run a woman against him I think at least.
against Sullivan and I came across a name after a lot of searching and it was Laurie Hummel. She recently retired as the Adjunct General of the Alaska national guard and ran for the state house in Alaska and almost won a fairly difficult seat in 2014!!
AK-SEN is going to be such a tough race that perhaps we should try Wielechowski against Sullivan or have him wait and challenge Dunleavy. So after that, I tried to see if there were a few elected officials or somewhat prominent names in Alaska that could be a decent candidate...
Alaska I put Laurie Hummel because it seems unlikely that Begich will get back into the ring after just losing the governors rave and Ethan Berkowitz has had a bit of a rocky tenure as mayor. Initially, I was leaning towards putting Bill Wielechowski down but I feel that...

@politicsluo https://t.co/0kXjBeAori This gives a good rundown on potential candidates etc.
@politicsluo Sununu said very forcefully he won't run for the Senate in 2020.
@davidagordon9 For context, Susannah Randolph ran for Congress in 2016 and was Alan Grayson's district director and her husband is Scott Randolph who is currently the Orange County Tax Collector.
@davidagordon9 CGS rise is mostly a product of the Randolph's who are a really questionable power couple in the Orlando area. So just his past along with this makes me think ideology wasn't CGS's only reasoning for endorsing him.
@davidagordon9 I mean that wasn't what Cate's reasoning was. Steyer may have endorsed him for the right reasons but CGS just is a question mark to me.
@davidagordon9 I don't think there is an obvious answer which opens to the door to something potentially being off or there being nothing there. Anyway, I just find it just interesting that along with Steyer and Cate his biggest elected official endorsee is now someone embroiled in scandal.
@davidagordon9 Then why did CGS, Steyer, and Cate still get behind him? I don't think it is too unreasonable to question the fact that they got behind someone that most other big players had distanced themselves from. It could be a nothingburger but the circumstances are somewhat suspect.
RT @danpfeiffer: ‚ÄúToo dumb to keep his lies straight‚Äù is not a great quality in a President https://t.co/GBbZDj06sf
@davidagordon9 Yes, but the question is if a decent portion of the primary support was a product of the outside money support he got late in the game. I think it probably is a yes but I may be wrong. As for support, most elected officials etc. shunned him for the primary which is telling.
@Deve_Dy @politicsluo I can relate to this so well.
Wait didn't she bash how the DeVos's took over public school systems in Michigan? Kind of disappointing that she'd appoint someone that doesn't come from a public school background. https://t.co/vZSsRLu0LF
@davidagordon9 I guess I just see these three people as integral parts of his primary campaign. I genuinely don't think he would have won the primary without them. Yes, he had some non-shady supporters but they weren't nearly as crucial support for him during the primary.
@davidagordon9 It's less that Gillum is to blame it's just interesting that he attracted all these questionable people during the primary. It could just be a coincidence but I can't imagine all of it just happened by chance.
@davidagordon9 This coupled with Gillum's rocky mayoral tenure just makes it all the more interesting that CGS was one of Gillum's only state house backers for the primary with what we know about him now.
@davidagordon9 But the problem is in Cate's case at least he's considered to be an establishment operative so it just exuded of political backstabbing when he decided to go in with full force for Gillum.
@davidagordon9 I don't mean he surrounded himself around crooks but he certainly surrounded himself around people that sort of had questionable intentions. I'd agree it would be unreasonable if these few people were just small parts but they were key backers and likely why he won the primary.
@davidagordon9 Long story short I just feel like in hindsight based on this news it isn't shocking that CGS backed him because it just seems like Gillum's base of support was shady for the primary anyway.
@davidagordon9 Which was also aided by the fact that Gillum was talented, young and, appealing but still it just seems like he was partially a product of a revenge campaign against Graham.
@davidagordon9 I'm referring to the primary from what I read at the time Kevin Cate got behind Gillum not because he liked him but because Gwen Graham didn't hire his team so he sort of decided to go after her out of spite. Gillum won in part of all the cash flow he got from outside money.
@davidagordon9 https://t.co/iFABVLLCQZ Looks like he endorsed Gillum for the primary. My general point is that Gillum seemed to surround himself around some not so savory people, so this latest news just seems to add to the list of not so great people that backed him early on.

@OfficialClayyy No, it really isn't I mean candidates can come out of the woodwork for seemingly small things nowadays. Your prior occupation or office I think is becoming less and less important to people.
@JakobIsSmug @algore It's still incredibly marginal though and it then goes into the problem of who to choose without risking losing a specific office. So once you take that into account I mean you're mostly left with people who would have the same electoral impact overall regardless of location.
@OfficialClayyy I'm just saying anyone can become viable if they get sensationalized enough. I mean Jason Kander almost won a Senate seat because of a viral campaign ad.
@JakobIsSmug I meant it jokingly hence the second tweet in the thread but either way, VP's don't have that massive of an electoral impact anyway so I don't see it is that important to focus on location.
@davidagordon9 Yeah I mean that would make it interesting in that it could pull in a bunch house members into the VP sweepstakes.
@OfficialClayyy I meant it jokingly but we live in different times. I mean Beto O'rourke would never be someone considered as a potential candidate for president in past cycles but here we are.
@JMilesColeman https://t.co/BRyrRm3jAd
@davidagordon9 He'd work for quite a few nominees but yeah that would be a pretty cool duo.
I don't make the rules I just enforce them.
Pete Buttigieg should be the VP choice just because it would force Mike Pence to share a debate stage with him.
@davidagordon9 I agree with that I guess I just see that as a false choice because like you said it doesn't ever become non-political.
@davidagordon9 @kkeeltygartland I mean it does potentially force a special for the LG race which they'd likely lose but still that might be intriguing to them.
@davidagordon9 Interesting. I guess the question is whether after further public pressure and from potential impeachment hearings will that cause a change in view.
@davidagordon9 Fair point but I think Saslaw seems to be the one going out of his way to tamp down impeachment efforts.
He's basically a rape apologist now.
Dick Saslaw is so horrendously bad.

@IAmKrishanPatel I don't think that narrative carries much weight regardless. Silly remarks like that from Republicans only end up being effective when we don't respond and just bury our heads in the sand. We just have to be willing to respond and further prove our point.
@jackcurran49 That's true but I guess I feel like you can put together a more factual message without inflaming the people he needs support from.
@IAmKrishanPatel That still proves the point that he's avoiding the crux of the problem. I don't think it is too risky in this stage of the primary to stamp out a coherent point of view on this issue that includes calling out white people and faulting them for being ignorant.
Um, can he announce instead of Klobuchar? https://t.co/i6jIfBCl46
@IAmKrishanPatel make sure white people don't feel like they have done something wrong when they have.
@IAmKrishanPatel Okay, but the whole point of making a point like his is to acknowledge what is wrong not just say well the status quo is this way so lets just put forward an idea that doesn't really make anyone (white people) uncomfortable. He sort of caves into this feeling of needing to...

@CatherineLPC Yeah, it's too bad because she could really use her platform as a force for good but clearly, behind the scenes she doesn't.
@RidgeKnapp For IA I think if we can't get Sand into the race it probably is better we get a state legislator in the race like Liz Mathis or I know Amber Gustafson is a rising star among IA democrats since she almost ousted the state senate majority leader in 2018.

@deedahnjr @IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 I mean this all depends on how this shakes out and who resigns when. Warner could go for it but it all matters on if there is a new governor and if they run for a full term.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 I mean yes I don't think he is a fire breathing monster but there needs to not just be an acknowledgment of wrongdoing but also real legitimate consequences. Yes, his mistake was perhaps naive but that doesn't make it any less offensive or wrongheaded.
@IAmKrishanPatel @deedahnjr @davidagordon9 No I know I just wanted to make my point clear that he should finish his term and not run again.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 That's exactly what I've been saying minus the great part.
@IAmKrishanPatel @deedahnjr @davidagordon9 No, I agree but I'm not making a comparison I'm just saying I don't really feel a need to support him in future runs for office. There are plenty of other qualified people who probably haven't done what he did.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 I mean sure but I think most of us are uneasy about him resigning because of the line of succession. He can finish his term but I'd rather not see or support him in future runs for office.
@deedahnjr @davidagordon9 I don't forgive him but I think he should at least finish his term.

@IAmKrishanPatel @MehtaIncredible Yeah and easy for Cox to thwart.
@IAmKrishanPatel Strongly disagree. First of all there are very few female governors so it would be a good opportunity to boost that number and in the case of sexual assault or even racism there is a need to show improvement symbolically when choosing a new person.

@CAinexile @OfficialClayyy And is that suppose to excuse the fact that Warner and Kaine have been silent since their ambiguous statement from last night?
@OfficialClayyy I mean that's the problem though their statement is ambiguous it could be perceived the way you are reading it or a different way and they did that purposely. They want to have it both ways.
@Yukongold1898 @OfficialClayyy I get that. I mean this is a different controversy but the same idea with Elizabeth Esty. She was well respected but then made an irrevocable mistake and it was a situation like this one where you really can't be in between. You've got to call a spade a spade.
RT @carterforva: Buddy, that point was like 18 hours ago. https://t.co/V7euSUFZQi
@OfficialClayyy I mean it's more that if you look at the situation as a whole (not just the statement) it makes it clear why they are not giving a statement that clearly calls for his resignation. Also, I think it is a fact that in this situation with Northam there is no in between.
@Yukongold1898 @OfficialClayyy I would hope but most that haven't fully reconciled with it have also called for his resignation.
@OfficialClayyy There isn't really an in between here and I think that's where we don't really agree. Giving a feeble word salad response that doesn't actually indicate anything specific makes it clear they aren't saying anything for non-political reasons.
@Yukongold1898 @OfficialClayyy I mean it's more just connecting the dots they've always been close and have flaunted their friendship in public so why all of a sudden are they milquetoast when Northam is engulfed in controversy? I think the answer is right in front of us.
@OfficialClayyy Funny that Kaine stuck this portion in then. We know from past statements they are friends and this just further proves the point that they aren't saying anything because they have a close personal connection to him. https://t.co/peQRput8nG
@OfficialClayyy Also what you are saying isn't adding up, all you've done is floated a bunch of hypotheticals. We know they made this statement during the height of the controversy and easily could have made a more pointed statement if they wanted to but they didn't. They basically praised him.
@OfficialClayyy at least one occasion. It's fairly obvious they are allowing their friendship with him to prevent them from calling for his resignation.
@OfficialClayyy How am I mischaracterizing anything? It's clear they didn't want to call for his resignation because otherwise they would have said it already. I do know that they aren't calling for the resignation of someone who went by the nickname "Coonman" and dressed up as blackface on...
@OfficialClayyy @Yukongold1898 McAuliffe made a statement last night. Kaine and Warner haven't said anything since their last statement.
@OfficialClayyy It's imperative that you condemn bad behavior and use your position to force a consequence for the person who is in question. Warner and Kaine obviously don't want to say anything specific because they care more about maintaining a friendship than actually doing what it is right.
@Yukongold1898 @OfficialClayyy I saw it as they are really close with him and didn't want to create a rift between themselves and Northam so they gave a statement free of any specifics.
@OfficialClayyy That's just condemning what he said that's not actually calling for him to step aside.
@OfficialClayyy https://t.co/7XZ48zYiTj I think you are misremembering what they said.
@DrewVanDrese @andrew_striedl others*
@DrewVanDrese @andrew_striedl He is but I think at this point he can speak up. I'm not angry at him like I am with other's (Warner and Kaine) but it's reached a level where he should exert his authority.
@Yukongold1898 @OfficialClayyy I mean with the events since this morning I think there is little reason to keep it behind the scenes.
@andrew_striedl And Justin Fairfax
@OfficialClayyy He didn't call for his resignation. Warner and he basically had identical statements.
Tim Kaine and Mark Warner's silence is deafening.
@IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah So did I I'm just saying in a general sense defending bad behavior should have severe consequences as well.
@IAmKrishanPatel @rudnicknoah I mean it certainly is possible I'd just be glad that we set a standard that behavior like Northam's isn't tolerated in our party and in Saslaw's case defending it isn't tolerable either.

@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 Yeah, that's because she did in an announcement speech where it is easier to frame an argument. Gillibrand was talking on a podcast. The circumstances matter.
@aseemru @SenhorRaposa Any voter that pledges to vote against him gets a you know what thrown at them.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 I mean I think you are mostly doing this because she's a competitor of Harris's but anyway it's a classic political answer. Most candidates give textbook responses on bipartisanship so they can avoid coming off as hyperpartisan.
@_Political_Nerd I don't make predictions on competitive elections when the candidates for one party haven't even announced. I do say that I think this or this could happen... but I don't really frame my predictions in the form of a fact.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 No candidate is going to back it enthusiastically especially a sitting senator. All Gillibrand was doing was avoiding the subject which every politician does including Kamala.

@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 And she did that purposely because she doesn't want to touch the subject. It's like political non-answer 101.
@IAmKrishanPatel @davidagordon9 It wasn't purposely naive it's just an issue most candidates don't want to touch. She knows full well the ramifications of having and getting rid of the filibuster.
@ryan_hassett @DemocraticLuntz @SenhorRaposa Well, you'd think that but Salazar actually is for and against everything.
@davidagordon9 Also with Gillibrand, while I get from your perspective it was disappointing it still was a stupid nothingburger answer so I could see her potentially moving towards abolishing the filibuster but just doesn't want to flaunt that issue during the election.
@davidagordon9 (I typed this while I was drinking tea so please excuse the typos lmao)
@davidagordon9 I think it is going to be hard to get most candidates to go n record backing the abolishment of the filibuster but who knows. Harris's answer makes me think it has crossed her mind.
@Tepper_Dylan @AOC No, you're right as you said in your other reply to this tweet.
@ErinMayeQuade @MonicaLewinsky Good answer
@Tepper_Dylan @AOC Yeah, it seemed fishy but it would be a nice way to get rid of Salazar who is a total fraud.
@deedahnjr Yeah I hope it isn't quite as close but I'll take what I can get lol

@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam I mean I think it's betting on a lot they may remember her actual name if we're lucky but now that she's been out of the news for a few months quite a few are not going to remember much about what took place in her election loss.
@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam I think otherwise she's a great choice in terms of communication skills and the like but I think the point Adam was making is valid in that anyone who isn't too well versed in politics will just figure out that she lost a race and not think much of her other than that.
@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam I mean she's well known among anyone who followed politics nationally but anyone who was mostly just an occasional viewer probably just has heard the name but doesn't know much about her. I'm guessing there is a decent amount that may not initially recognize her name.
@SenhorRaposa @704heather Tbh it wouldn't look good on Scott and she should yell at Ted Cruz until he shaves his beard.
@davidagordon9 @LikeIGive_Adam I mean while they're watching it they likely will look her up because a good portion won't recognize the name.
good on policy. Not to dismiss Drew's preference because veteran's do bring a valuable skill set to the table but it's not going the be that important from an electoral standpoint.
I don't think it is wise to box ourselves into this idea that one has to a specific credential to be a good VP choice.

@_AlexPerdue @DogPhoenixWP @jackcurran49 Any open Senate seat will probably have a big expensive primary so Kennedy even if he is appointed may not have the seat locked up.
@jackcurran49 @_AlexPerdue Yeah, I think so just most have left after 2 terms.
@_AlexPerdue @jackcurran49 One thing that may push him to switch is that the MA GOP elected a super Trumpy state chair even though the other candidate was a Baker backed guy but even still I think we can do better in a state like MA.
@DogPhoenixWP @_AlexPerdue @jackcurran49 Not a fan he endorsed Bill Daley for Chicago Mayor which shows tremendously poor judgment plus I think Pressley and Healey are way more exciting.
@_AlexPerdue @jackcurran49 I mean I'll believe it when it happens but for me personally, I would prefer someone else. Like Maura Healey or Ayanna Pressley.
@_AlexPerdue @jackcurran49 I mean I feel like if he wanted he could have left the Republican party already.
@jackcurran49 @_AlexPerdue I'm not trying to belittle you but it just seems like a big sacrifice. Sure he singularly aligns with your views well but just him being a member would prop up so many more people that I know for a fact you don't align with.
@jackcurran49 @_AlexPerdue Yeah, but in a literal sense, he'd add another seat to the majority. What if the Senate was 51R-49D with a Dem president? Just by being there he'd put Lindsey Graham at the helm of the judiciary committee and Mitch McConnell as majority leader.

@AndrewSolender @IAmKrishanPatel https://t.co/FRr3Y1bebJ I mean she's pretty specific here. Also that quote basically just says she thinks she's qualified not that she plans on running.
@AndrewSolender @IAmKrishanPatel Ok so on two different occasions she said completely different things. Hillary on the other hand not so much. I don't see many 2020 candidates saying they will never run for office again.
@TossupReport @walterowensgrpa Oh sorry, I got overexcited.
@AndrewSolender @IAmKrishanPatel Here's the quote "I am in these fights, and I am in this fight to retain my Senate seat in 2018. That's where I'm focused. That's where I'm going to stay focused.

@AndrewSolender @IAmKrishanPatel Many said they weren't ruling it out or just said they were currently running for re-election. Gillibrand is an exception but still, her answer was still not nearly as direct as Hillary's.
@AndrewSolender @IAmKrishanPatel I mean I'm not going to speak in absolutes but I mean she has said time and time and time again publicly she won't seek elective office ever again. I mean this could mean she changed her mind but I think it is reasonable to take this with a grain of salt.
My broader point is that I wouldn't write off a candidate based on early fundraising numbers many gain their spurs and end up becoming extremely strong.

@SailorHaumea @joncprevo I'm fine with people that are personally pro-life but I do object to the idea of forcing your beliefs on someone especially when it pertains to their body.
@SailorHaumea @joncprevo They literally in Texas wrote laws to limit the width of hallways to purposely shut down abortion clinics so no I'm not buying they don't know the outcome of their legislation.
@SailorHaumea @joncprevo Yeah, we aren't going to agree on this but the fact is that a medical procedure should be between a person and their doctor and an abortion shouldn't be an exception.
@SailorHaumea @joncprevo "they don't realize that illegal abortions are even a thing" yeah that's rich. These people know the outcome of strict abortion laws. They aren't naive they know full well.
@SailorHaumea @joncprevo Yes, sometimes we have to hold our nose with like Manchin or Peterson but only in those circumstances other than that why should we have them in our caucus?
@SailorHaumea @joncprevo I mean I think it is malicious to tell a woman what to do with her own body and to force her into unsafe options such as coat hangers and suicide but go off.
@SailorHaumea @joncprevo I mean I can think of many things wrong with being pro-life but the point still stands he's terrible and shouldn't be representing a district Clinton won by double digits.

@JakobIsSmug @politicsluo @joncprevo Exactly. I mean Manchin I think would move somewhat to the left if it was advantageous for him. I mean he's only continuing to be conservative atm because he's weighing a run for governor. There is a high chance Manchin would end up being way more liberal than Hogan.
@JakobIsSmug @politicsluo @joncprevo I mean the question is whether Hogan is only moderate transactionally which is highly likely.

@_Political_Nerd Of the people that were actually considering it was basically Titus and Rosen so I wouldn't call that much of a bench. Ross Miller was an option but still, it was a tremendously thin bench.
@zcpolitics He's an option but sort of a backup if other options don't pan out.
@OfficialClayyy @_Political_Nerd I mean it's kind of clear she didn't want to go for governor plus from her perspective she's at an age where it's kind of now or never.
@OfficialClayyy I mean that's your opinion but it's kind of telling he hasn't declined the race and he's sent subtle signals that he may run.
@OfficialClayyy @_Political_Nerd Well, we have other people lol. It's not like Mathis is the only talent in the state legislature.
@OfficialClayyy JD Scholton is the best candidate that would still lose by double digits against an inoffensive republican.
@OfficialClayyy That's like the most classic non-answer for Sand plus he's hinted at being interested in running the past. Obama is not exactly the most effective boogyman these days plus it was widely considered a victory for rural America that he was Agricultural Secretary.
@OfficialClayyy @_Political_Nerd I mean it worked for Joni Ernst. I don't think you can say on the whole that state legislators should just stick to more local and statewide positions.
@OfficialClayyy IA-04 is a waste since King will lose to Feenstra, Vilsack is still highly regarded in IA and unlike other former governors he wasn't governor during the economic crash, and I haven't seen Rob Sand decline to run.
@_Political_Nerd We have an actual bench in IA so we don't have to open up a light red seat in a presidential year for a Senate seat that is way harder to win than NV.
@OfficialClayyy Yeah Rob Sand, Liz Mathis, Amber Gustafson, Tom Vilsack, and Rita Hart would all be just as formidable if not more formidable than Axne.
@OfficialClayyy Rob Sand, Tom Vilsack, Rita Hart, Liz Mathis, and JD Scholton all would either match or be a stronger candidate than Axne. Plus they wouldn't open up a house seat.
@_Political_Nerd https://t.co/dvgGQTpmMI
@OfficialClayyy Profile wise yes she is similar to Rosen but overall it seems like a risk not worth taking especially when we have a wide array of other candidates that wouldn't open up a light red house seat.
@OfficialClayyy We had no real bench in NV and it was a much more winnable race. IA will be an uphill battle. Yes, a Senate seat is more important but I don't see her as that much stronger than many others so it just seems like a waste to push her into the race.
@HoldenCasey @politicsluo I feel like you could catch some interesting activities relating to Denver Riggleman if we did that.
@OfficialClayyy https://t.co/i9vuswo6DD
@_Political_Nerd I don't want to open up a competitive house seat for what will be a pretty tough senate race. Plus I sort of prefer not running freshmen unless we have no other option.

@davidagordon9 @Polit_eurOpines I mean perhaps but the part that just had nothing to do with a point of view was deriding the opposition as right-wing I mean that just couldn't be farther from the truth.
@davidagordon9 I mean definitely, some call her that for very reprehensible reasons but even if it is spread through other echo chambers she should along with other members just get a well-rounded point of view so she knows what is going on rather than just reiterating false statements.
@davidagordon9 I totally get your point of view and I know we don't see eye to eye on this but I do find it dangerous no matter the member when they make ill-informed tweets and statements. It should just be a basic part of the job to not spread false statements.
@davidagordon9 I mean I do think she should have done her research prior to tweeting something that was so categorically wrong. You can be philosophically opposed the situation but it made no sense to call the opposition right wing.
@davidagordon9 Also, maybe it's just me but I found her tweet to just be more obviously wrong maybe because it was more concise but it just sort of seemed very ill-informed almost like she just thought of it off the top of her head.

@davidagordon9 Should have been more specific I meant within the house.
@JacobKlainberg Nah a lot of these people have become chairs of committees and subcommittees and are very unlikely to leave their positions considering we just won a majority for the first time in nearly a decade.
@davidagordon9 Well, part of it is rightwing racists but also she probably has one of the largest followings on twitter for a member congress so it's kind of a given that her tweets will receive more scrutiny than others.
