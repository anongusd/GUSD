@nicktheandersen Fair. I'm only ten minutes into the Jackson doc. On the other hand, fate of the entire country/world and all...
I'm watching the Michael Cohen hearing on one screen and the Michael Jackson Leaving Neverland doc on another screen. Can't decide which Michael story is darker.
@SATXIndivisible @Jim_Jordan You may not intend for this to be a homophobic remark, but that's how it comes across.
"I did the very thing you are doing now, for ten years. Protected Mr. Trump for ten years." Michael Cohen comparing the person he was then to Republicans in Congress today. And implying they may have a similar rude awakening.
I wonder whether any of the Congresspeople listening to this testimony are substantively changing their Qs based on what they're hearing from Cohen right now, or is it all fully pre-baked?
