Getting ready to leave for 5 days in DC. @StPaulKid says he'll miss me.
StPaulKid already begging me to take him to next midnight movie _ "Die Hard." I don't know.
Lots of leftover Halloween candy. Where have all the kids gone?
Just saw 'The Shining' at midnight movies w/StPaulKid (son). 1st time I've seen it on big screen in 29 years. Jack is great!
Christian did great job at piano recital. He has a fine way with a Steinway.

My AP story on Brian Setzer talking about his new CD http://bit.ly/aKKPR
Ya this is his son speaking watch it.		And watch "Return to Sleepaway Camp" 		Both have a shocking ending.
Stick w/ original 'Friday the 13th' for your teens slaughtered at camp flick.
Son keeps watching 'Sleepaway Camp,' a slice of '80s cheese. It's not campy or cool _ it's just crappy. Avoid.

Last year I went to only 1 Mpls fringe show, and it was the worst of the lot. Just picked it at random.
They were "Two Short Operas" at Playwrights' Center and "Bard Fiction" at U of M Rarig Center Thrust
The only 2 Mpls fringe shows I caught both got encore performances Sun nite. Pretty good batting average for picking shows.
Caught "Bard Fiction" at Mpls Fringe. Shakespeare meets Tarantino. It works.
Now I'm 54
asked Christian if he wants to see a Mpls Fringe show with adult language or a kids one when he returns. He said adult language.
Sent Christian off to Boy Scout camp. He's already called once, from Albertville, 15 miles out of town.He started crying last night.
