@HughE_Dillon Yes, individual Philly-dwellers should do their part.... but, sometimes it‚Äôs downright ridiculous how far I‚Äôll walk without passing a single trashcan, or recycle bin. Especially on heavy foot traffic routes in the city. We need more street cleaning staff &amp; trash cans!
@rmortimer @realDonaldTrump Clinton‚Äôs pressure on banks to lend to low-income consumers contributed, but the deregulation wasn‚Äôt his initial charge. It was all the GOP Congress would allow to pass in support of it. Regardless, it further illustrates how dangerous deregulation is for the average consumer.
@realDonaldTrump Obama &amp; the Dems saved the U.S. economy from a crippling recession that included high levels of unemployment, a mortgage crisis brought on by unregulated corporate greed, all of which started under GOP control. You &amp; the GOP are once again setting us back for decades...

@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather It concerns me because more than one child under 18 dies every month due to gun violence, and has, for several years. That‚Äôs one too many. I can‚Äôt understand why any reasonable citizen would take issue with waiting longer to get guns, required training/safety proficiency, etc...
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather Philadelphia is part of ‚Äòreal‚Äô PA, to suggest otherwise is ridiculous. It‚Äôs also the birthplace of the constitution, and the most populated part of the state. You‚Äôre welcome to your own opinions, but not your own facts. Your malicious manner of communicating remains unwelcome.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather You‚Äôre ignorant, in all regards. Both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions are eligible for change. To suggest otherwise, because there‚Äôs a predefined process, is misleading.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather You mustn‚Äôt have had much exposure to Philadelphia. There are high murder/crime rates in low-income areas of the city that skew the #s for the whole of the city. Regardless, cities aren‚Äôt defined by their murder rates. There‚Äôs plenty of others variables to consider.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather The constitution can be amended. I‚Äôm not sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make there, other than another inappropriate insult.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather It seems like everytime I make a valid point that you don‚Äôt like, you respond with some opinionated verbal lashing/insult. Philadelphia is a great city in many respects, regardless of your opinion of it.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather Federal, state, &amp; local laws may be changed by the people, hence the debate. You‚Äôve demonstrated that you‚Äôre not willing to debate the topic though, &amp; I hope that you‚Äôre one day able to expand your awareness beyond your existing worldview/experiences in consideration of others.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather I‚Äôm familiar with state law, and your presumptive suggestion otherwise further illustrates your inability to debate this topic in a mature &amp; decent manner.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather Chances are high that I‚Äôm both better educated, and more intelligent than you. If not only evidenced by your use of ad hominem to try to prop up your viewpoints. My ‚Äústupidity‚Äù is not the topic of debate, gun control is the topic.
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather Ian, you‚Äôre not a constitutional law scholar, nor have you been mature in this debate. Founders intended a well-trained/regulated population of gun owners that could band together should the government unduly impose upon their rights. Read up here:	https://t.co/KIOvnuE4KA
@ian_wvpaw @markbitsko @AMSweather Ian,  you‚Äôre the one that brought up gun use as a hobby, protected by the 2A... Hobby use is quite obviously not protected by the 2A.
@markbitsko @ian_wvpaw @AMSweather ‚ÄúA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.‚Äù 	The right to bear arms is in the context of a well regulated militia... (not hunting, nor personal unregulated ownership).
@AMSweather @ian_wvpaw 2A... Do you consider the average American citizen in possession of personal firearms members of a well regulated militia? I don‚Äôt.
@AMSweather @ian_wvpaw I have more than an idea what I‚Äôm talking about, but you &amp; Ian are too busy in your echo chamber tossing insults, easily disputable info, irrelevant personal experience, logical fallacies to notice. There‚Äôs nearly no sensible reason not to require tougher controls on guns.
@ian_wvpaw @AMSweather I‚Äôm in support of reasonable regulation of guns, in general. Including semi-automatic riffles/weapons. You keep honing in on  the definition of an assault weapon.
@ian_wvpaw @AMSweather Being a veteran doesn‚Äôt make you the final authority on what constitutes an assault weapon, nor knowledgeable of gun law, nor aware of the damage untrained civilians have caused with few restrictions to accessing weapons such as the AR15.
@ian_wvpaw @AMSweather Also, you‚Äôre wrong about the nature &amp; scope of existing gun control legislation. Read up here, then do your own research:	https://t.co/t9KrmRzSLr
@ian_wvpaw @AMSweather You‚Äôre tossing obscenities, and falsehoods. The AR15 is an assault weapon, though that definition is a matter of contention only bc of the gun industry suggesting it‚Äôs neither an assault rifle, nor assault weapon. AR15 was designed &amp; intended for the US Military...
@ian_wvpaw @AMSweather Federal Courts have ruled that owning an assault weapon is not a constitutionally protected right via the 2nd Amendment. That said, weapons available today defy the spirit/intent the founders expressed when drafting the 2nd Amendment, anyhow. Lastly, regulation is for safety.
@AMSweather FYI, if the ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù were pushing ‚Äúliberal agendas,‚Äù then there wouldn‚Äôt be Republican control of Congress &amp; the Presidency. It‚Äôd be much easier to enact gun control by helping Dems get elected, than to kill a bunch of people in staged mass shootings. Stop spreading lies...
@AMSweather @Duceman03 @davidhogg Dude, you‚Äôre propagating conspiracy theories. The hundreds of thousands of people that marched for gun control weren‚Äôt all deep state/big brother operatives. They‚Äôre concerned citizens, trying to improve our great nation. Those kids weren‚Äôt paid actors, they‚Äôd victims...
@ian_wvpaw @AMSweather Stamps aren‚Äôt designed to kill, and while shooting can be a hobby, it‚Äôs one that comes inherent with many risks to cause immediate harm to self/others. Regulation &amp; barriers to purchase easily would still allow for hobby usage of guns while regulating access.

@AMSweather Providing that clarification totally misses the point of the gun control movement‚Äôs intention. It‚Äôs long name doesn‚Äôt matter, so much as it‚Äôs a device designed for efficient mass killing, &amp; folks can cause massive harm with it without proper training/barriers to entry/regulation.

@AMSweather There are plenty of valid reasons to be anti-Trump. Note: Most GOPers were anti-Trump until his campaign changed their perspective on him. Gun control isn‚Äôt about Trump, lest he stands in the way. It‚Äôs about gun control. Trying to suggest otherwise is ignorant, at best.
@hrenee80 @AMSweather Equating the lethality of guns, and/or the increase in gun violence, with the removal of monotheism from public schools is bad logic. So, please do, think for yourself. Thoughts &amp; prayers won‚Äôt reduce gun violence, clearly... but reduced access to AR guns certainly will.
@AMSweather I don‚Äôt like Trump, but my worldview isn‚Äôt defined by my dislike of the current president. 	Also, I replied to your tweet suggesting these kids are somehow being manipulated to have anti-gun violence views, because I think that‚Äôs a disingenuous attempt to minimize their effort.

@dbongino Dude, you‚Äôre being ridiculous. The gun controls proposed aren‚Äôt laws ‚Äútargeting‚Äù law abiding citizens, they‚Äôre laws regulating the sale of firearms, to create barriers to entry for those that would be ineligible to buy due to age, criminal record, mental health status, etc...
@AustinTXRob @NRATV @dbongino I didn‚Äôt say criminals would fill out paperwork, but with gun control in place, not every criminal would know who to go to, nor where to go, to purchase a gun. It‚Äôd also be very illegal to sell guns without following the proper protocols. It‚Äôll deter many would-be criminals.
@NRATV @dbongino You‚Äôre wrong. If there were barriers to getting guns (30 day waiting period, age eligibility, background check, community sponsors such as partners, parents, neighbors, etc) then most ppl could still get them legally, but it would deter many ineligible folks. Barriers to entry...

@Politick_Rick @RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino The Bible presents warfare as inevitable in a sinful world (Mark 13:7 &amp; James 4:1), and weapons as a necessary part of warfare, in a military sense/setting. Individual weapons are intended only for self-defense (from thieves/wild animals). Nearly no one needs more than a handgun.
@Politick_Rick @dbongino Gun control proposals out there right now don‚Äôt suggest limiting purchase options to pea shooters. The constitution says right to bear arms, but doesn‚Äôt specify what types of arms. Please stick to the topic at hand w/o using logical fallacy.
@Politick_Rick @RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino I‚Äôm fairly certain that God doesn‚Äôt condone, support, nor promote access to high powered weapons designed for efficient/rapid killing. It‚Äôs not a God given right, it‚Äôs more a product of human inclination to sin towards excess.
@RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino If you want a voice on the House/Senate floor everyday, you could run a campaign, and if your message is favorable to enough voters, then you‚Äôll have that ability to negotiate. Not perfect, but the best working system of democracy in the world.

@Anselmo16227420 @dbongino It‚Äôs reasonable to assume the founding fathers hadn‚Äôt envisioned the accessibility to the efficient weapons designed for killing today. That said, none of the gun control proposed suggests muskets-only. Just reasonable restrictions, and barriers, to buying certain firearms...
@spudflyer @RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino Access to buying weapons isn‚Äôt an inalienable human right. The right to bear arms is a constitutional right. None of the Gun Control proposals are about removing inalienable human rights. Stay on topic.
@RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino Correct, as an American citizen, you‚Äôve got the right to vote, and thus impact or change the laws to add/modify/remove rights per the will of the people.
@joeychill76 @RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino If you live in the United States of America, then your rights, protected by the United States Constitution, most certainly do come from the Gov‚Äôt. You‚Äôre free to do as you will, but there are laws/limits, and some actions come with consequences.
@_North_Carolina @bellagirlnola @dbongino Right to bear arms doesn‚Äôt specify what sorts of arms. There‚Äôs limits to the right to free speech, as well. Buying guns isn‚Äôt a right. Keep focused on the simple truth that gun control won‚Äôt impact most lawful gun owners. It‚Äôll mostly create a barrier for those w criminal intent.
@RosenbalmMR @bellagirlnola @dbongino The rights you‚Äôre granted by the constitution ARE the rights you‚Äôre given by your gov‚Äôt. Since the inception of the gov‚Äôt, they‚Äôve protected Americans freedoms/rights.
@bellagirlnola @dbongino The Patriot Act didn‚Äôt remove any rights granted in the constitution. It did specify circumstances under which law enforcement &amp; counter-intelligence could track/monitor suspected criminals.
@dbongino Our Gov‚Äôt isn‚Äôt taking away your guns. The gun controls proposed will simply make it a bit more difficult to acquire new weapons, &amp; put checks/balances in place. Comparable to drivers‚Äô tests to get a license, with an age eligibility. De-escalate &amp; educate yourself, pls!

@FoxNews @RajShah45 @POTUS @foxandfriends He‚Äôs literally done nothing to acknowledge Russia‚Äôs malicious acts against the US, nor impose/enforce the sanctions that were voted by congress. He‚Äôs been lax, biased favorably towards Russia, and ignorant.
@AMSweather Thanks, enjoy the long weekend, &amp; God bless you, too. My wishes are a continued prosperous America, and and outcome of this investigation that further secures our democracy.
@AMSweather How do you know Trump had no idea? If he, or anyone else at the top layers of our govt, acted with a foreign enemy, then I‚Äôd certainly like to know about it. Did you read the indictment? Objectively, it‚Äôs not a nothing burger.
@AMSweather It wasn‚Äôt just 13 Russian trolls. It was ‚ÄúInternet Research Group,‚Äù which was an entire multi-million $ Kremlin-tied organization which weaponized social media to maliciously influence &amp; misinform Americans. This was coordinated info warfare, not a bunch of opinionated trolls.
@AMSweather How can you call the probe a sham after the latest indictment? Moreover, Mueller‚Äôs career is about as solid/unbiased as it gets. You‚Äôre clearly intelligent, &amp; I‚Äôm interested in hearing the facts that shape your perception on the Russia probe if you‚Äôre willing to share.
@FoxNews @RepRatcliffe The indictment is among the first in the investigation. It‚Äôs not an indication that Trump et al are free from guilt, &amp; the investigation is far from over. Instead of presuming what the left/right wants, how about focusing on what the indictment &amp; Rosenstein said, comprehensively
@FoxNews @TomFitton 13 Russian entities/oligarchs were indicted. It‚Äôs not the final indictment of the investigation, it‚Äôs among the first. A foreign nation committed info warfare against the US, &amp; had help from within the US. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still talking about it, &amp; the investigation continues.
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù is intentionally misleading its audience. The indictments only re-affirm the validity of the special counsel investigation, prove Russia DID attempt to influence the election, and does not clear Trump et al of any wrongdoing. Several of Trump‚Äôs admin made plea deals...
@FoxNews @Lonegan Prayers don‚Äôt stop bullets, and every student is welcome to pray in his/her faith of choice. Regardless, gun control is what most of these children are asking/praying for, often quite publicly. As adults, let‚Äôs work together to put sensible gun control into law.
@FoxNews @RajShah45 Fox lies, repeatedly, are intentionally misleading, often times maliciously fueling Russia‚Äôs narrative/messaging, and Trump‚Äôs. Fox is acting in collusion, or at least supporting the conspiracy against the US.
@robjective You‚Äôve seen the Facebook ads. That wouldn‚Äôt give a comprehensive enough picture to understand &amp; claim to know Russia‚Äôs goals. Putin had a longstanding hatred for Clinton, and actively sought her loss, in addition to fueling chaos within the US.
@realDonaldTrump Yes, let‚Äôs all put our faith in this individual biased Facebook employee instead of all of our intelligence agencies &amp; the FBI special counsel... Oh wait, that would be idiotic. You‚Äôre further implicating yourself with every defensive tweet.

@kayleighmcenany You‚Äôre either being ignorant or malicious, but it seems like you‚Äôre propagating lies willfully. 	At what point does your behavior become willful participation in Russia‚Äôs efforts to sew distrust &amp; chaos?
@FoxNews @kayleighmcenany @TheDemocrats @BernieSanders A.) It‚Äôs the FBI investigation, not a Dem theory   B.)

@TuckerCarlson @Scott_Wells91 @FoxNews It has a lot to do with access to guns designed for efficient mass killing.

@Curt5054 @RepStevenSmith This is a fake bot account. #RussianBot
@RepStevenSmith John McCain is a veteran P.o.W. whom fought for our country, and represented the GOP platform in a presidential election, &amp; in congress far longer than you.	Putin is a trained intel agent, dictator, and opponent of democracy.	You‚Äôre a traitor to our nation, in allegiance w Putin.
@realDonaldTrump Putin is a dictator, with known, well documented atrocities against human rights. He‚Äôs been an active opponent of democracy, and the U.S. Neither Putin, nor Russia, is an ally to our country, and your knowing dismissal of our nation‚Äôs intelligence agencies is unacceptable...
@baycityvince @RepStevenSmith This is a fake bot account. #RussianBot
@RepStevenSmith https://t.co/gDjHInnVrR.our.election... Not conspiracy theorists, but domestic intel. Putin is a dictator whom has openly attacked democracy for decades. Russia isn‚Äôt our ally, &amp; it‚Äôs quite clear.

@RepStevenSmith @tedlieu @johncardillo @wikileaks PS - Even the accounts liking your tweet now are bot accounts. Some of the bots are slight renames of those on the known list of bot accounts that Twitter shared with Congress. Hmm....
@RepStevenSmith @tedlieu @johncardillo @wikileaks I didn‚Äôt call one article a conspiracy, rather, I said that you‚Äôre pushing conspiracies. I also noted that most of the accounts that comment, like, &amp; retweet your tweets are very obvious fake accounts. Most of your vocal followers are Russian bots.
@FoxNews @POTUS Who cares what Trump believes? Every U.S. intelligence body has confirmed that Russia interfered in the election. Trump, unlike Putin, has no background in intelligence, nor politics, nor espionage.
@RepStevenSmith @tedlieu @johncardillo @wikileaks There are thousands of documented instances of President Trump lying. Since you noted the NYT, here‚Äôs a link to their definitive list: https://t.co/byL2qinQbk
@RepStevenSmith @Vickiwhatever @tedlieu Since you‚Äôre tweeting nonsense most of the day, I‚Äôll keep pointing out the fake accounts that support you, &amp; the facts that counter your conspiracy. Maybe you should do some work to support your constituency instead of engaging in twitter swirl...

@RepStevenSmith @johnpodesta @DailyCaller Nope, I‚Äôm clearly not a bot. My tweets are more well reasoned, intelligible, and broader in scope than most of yours. Are you a traitor to our country?
@RepStevenSmith @johnpodesta @DailyCaller You post conspiracy theories with little to no basis in fact or reality, all day long. The Trump train is headed for Federal prison, and I hope you stay on it till the end.

@MeetThePress @SenSchumer @LindseyGrahamSC @chucktodd Hearing reports of a sealed indictment for Trump, to be used as a start for impeachment hearings. Please ask about this! Read @LouiseMensch
@DeplorableMadre @CITIZEN__XYZ @mutt1960 @AJP_III @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine There's enough evidence of Trump's dismissal of protocol, chronic lying, ad hominem attacks, &amp; self-aggrandizement to give cause for concern
@smerconish @realDonaldTrump @CNN @cnni Several sources (@LouiseMensch) have on good authority that a sealed indictment was issued for Trump. Next week will be the worst for him...
@villagesflorida @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine An FBI investigation of this scale would normally last at least a year.
@realDonaldTrump You. You're an idiot.
@villagesflorida @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine I know you're mistaken, but please feel welcome to add a link to the video or audio for what you're suggesting.
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe @POTUS Fox "News" appears to be near entirely "on Trump's side." News shouldn't report opinions as facts, nor pledge allegiance for/against.
@SteveS717171 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine FBI looking into severity &amp; extent of Russian interference into the election. Unfortunately, many Trump associates are implicated thus far.
@villagesflorida @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @POTUS PS - watch the recording of the hearing itself. Not news coverage of the hearing.
@ElaineFrance1 @AJP_III @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine There's no evidence nor justification to the claim that Susan Rice spied on Trump. He was caught via incidental collection by IC &amp; unmasked.
@AJP_III @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine The FBI doesn't share their evidence during an active investigation. We wouldn't see evidence till charges are made &amp; investigation is over.
@villagesflorida @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @POTUS I have no issue with positive reporting of @POTUS. I take issue with false or misleading reporting. Watch the full public hearing again, pls
@villagesflorida @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine I watched/listened to all of the public hearings. None of the individuals quoted above suggested nor said that no evidence exists.
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine This is intentionally misleading reporting. Neither individual said there's no evidence, simply that they hadn't seen it.
@SheWhoVotes Donald Trump never makes exceptions. #WithFewExceptions
@AP @NoahShachtman I'm interested in the few exceptions
@realDonaldTrump Yes, changes in import/export policy w China is news. Doesn't negate/reduce importance of other real news.  Like the Russia investigation...
@realDonaldTrump No one near the investigation has said that.. they've said theres an active investigation. Listen to their words, not what you want to hear.
@foxnation Patriots care about rule of law. Trump is performing Obstruction of Justice by Trump's own account of what happened... That's unpatriotic...
@realDonaldTrump It's the news agencies &amp; journalists responsibility to ensure accurate coverage. It's not fake... It's your words, writings, &amp; actions.
@realDonaldTrump Your own written words are what caused the initial stir. You made a bogus claim about why you fired Comey, then contradicted yourself...
@seanhannity No, the FBI should focus more energy towards the on-going investigation into Russian collusion and interference in the election.
@klorenzen81 @AdamSchiffCA @POTUS Fact: Trump fired the FBI Director whom was leading an active investigation into Trump's associates regarding Russian collusion.
@DavidHaire5 @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls I'm not sure what that means. Most new networks, including CNN, report facts, and preface speculation or rumors as such.
@DavidHaire5 @foxandfriends @KellyannePolls "We" could, if they were actually false. Fox News is an "opinion" network, and can't be sued for opinions. Most news networks present facts.
@foxandfriends @KellyannePolls Only network persistently mimicking the White House's spin on the Comey firing is Fox News. I'd say that's loss &amp; evidence of poor planning.
@davydawg @ManferdQ @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox Trump is under investigation for RICO violations for the considerable loans he took in 2006 from Russian sources to bail out his businesses.
@MMsharbono You make no sense. Trump fired the Director of the investigation into his teams &amp; potentially his own Russian ties. That's obstructionist.
@phillyant @MzTRUMPcard @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox #ImpeachTrump it won't be 8 years.
@ManferdQ @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox Comey's not my favorite. The issue is with the person under investigation firing the Director of the investigation. It's interference...
@MzTRUMPcard @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox Trump and his associates are under investigation. AG is recused. Trump fired the person actively investigating his team &amp; potentially him.
@DD8328 @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox As a frequent traveler, I've seen near every foreign country respects the US less via Trump. Pres &amp; team under investigation, not Comey
@Mbrewer03 @FoxNews @johnrobertsFox Comey was leading the investigation as FBI Director, &amp; at least 2 grand juries are evaluating evidence towards indictments of Trump &amp; team..
@FoxNews @johnrobertsFox White House has lost all credibility. Firing of Comey is obstruction of Justice. Comey/FBI was investigating Trump et al, &amp; AG was recused.
@AdamSchiffCA @POTUS It's just cause to put forth a bill of impeachment. Please do so. #ImpeachTrump
@FoxNews @marthamaccallum Reality check: Trump fired the lead investigator into Russian collusion involving his team at rec of his recused AG. Obstruction of Justice.

@FoxNews @EricTrump Think how dangerous it is that our President refuse to release tax returns &amp; possibly be influenced by foreign $$$. Bad!
@theminnguy @FoxNews @foxnewspolitics prevent war, yes. Launch a missle strike or public attack, no. Trump is using war as distraction.
@HerbyDebbie @FoxBusiness @FoxNews  "snowflakes" is a derogatory term referencing libs. Deplorables references Trump supporters. Both wrong.
@HerbyDebbie @FoxBusiness @FoxNews facts &amp; recordings of what Trump says aren't anti, but actual reporting on his words/actions.  Journalism
@HerbyDebbie @FoxBusiness @FoxNews It's irresponsible for a news agency to print incendiary headlines or propogate hate disguised as a joke.
@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics NKs most advanced weapon can't bypass our most outdated defense. Use Econ sanctions, &amp; covert ops to shut him down
@FoxNews @WattersWorld @jessebwatters @POTUS Trump only gives exclusives to Fox, pls show some journalistic integrity &amp; ask hard questions!
@FoxNews @WattersWorld @jessebwatters @POTUS please ask about Trump's taxes, the Russia investigation, &amp; excessive cost of his security svcs
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine not intolerance of opinions, but intolerance of ignorance. Facts matter, &amp; baseless opinions w/o facts shouldn't...
@foxandfriends @realDonaldTrump @FoxFriendsFirst Fox News does irresponsible reporting, often making baseless claims or republishing yours..

@jtnoerr @clif5441 @FoxBusiness @FoxNews I didn't say the song, I said Fox News is being irresponsible. Snowflake is in their headline.
@clif5441 @jtnoerr @FoxBusiness @FoxNews This is a Fox News article about a song referring to the left as Snowflakes. Fox is irresponsible.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews dude, you're not even arguing coherent points any longer, just repeatedly saying I'm wrong. I'll no longer engage you.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews no, doesn't make you right. Does make it less likely you're trolling with your account.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews That's not a fact, it's your opinion. Also, your tweet was grammatically incorrect, should read "you're." Please read up
@ToddTraut @FoxNews This isn't in question. It's the religious freedom noted in the constitution which judges ruled upon. Read the ruling...
@jtnoerr @FoxBusiness @FoxNews Ignorance isn't bliss. Name calling behavior is inappropriate &amp; shouldn't be supported by news agencies...
@ToddTraut @FoxNews I've stated facts. My profile is my name &amp; face. Opinions supported with facts I've shared. No basis to call me troll..
@ToddTraut @FoxNews Not off topic. You made a claim, and I'm asking you to add credibility by de-trolling your account.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews you didn't post a law. Please post one that supports your statements, and I'll review it.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews your account doesn't have a profile pic of your face. Faceless. It doesn't have your name. Nameless. That's factual.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews Clearly not beyond judiciary's power, else Trump would have appealed &amp; won. Judicial branches power is in constitution.
@ToddTraut @FoxNews If the law were clearly in Trump's favor, they would have appealed and won over the first ruling. Trump didn't do that..
@ToddTraut @FoxNews according to your nameless faceless twitter account? I hear your opinion, but back it up with facts for credibility...
@ToddTraut @FoxNews The judicial branch has constitutional authority to be a check for the exec &amp; legislative branch. Judges did their job..
@ToddTraut @FoxNews Trump's words matter, or they don't. Can't have it both ways. He repeatedly stated he'd implement a Muslim ban as such..
@FoxBusiness @FoxNews irresponsible reporting... Why spread an intentionally inflammatory song &amp; broaden awareness of the term "snowflake?"
@FoxBusiness @FoxNews serious cuts to peacekeeping efforts abroad + mild increase on military spending = Increased conflicts &amp; risks to US..
@ToddTraut @FoxNews the judges rulings were based on context of the statements made regarding the ban + constitutional checks &amp; balances.
@WantedSanders Treason &amp; foreign meddling in our election process is a bipartisan issue. Do some research, the facts are objective, &amp; real..

@FoxNews a war with meaningless NK will be the distraction Trump uses to destract from Russian collusion investigation. Called it weeks ago.
@FoxNews Yes! An independent investigation is needed. Far too much of the dossier has been proven accurate/true. Trump impeachment imminent.

@tejastumbleweed @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle Hollywood actors are paid for their work. It's not their responsibility to support the nations PBS..
@waltgolf3 @momtoGEO @FoxNews @kimguilfoyle you're way off topic. Adults aren't forgoing employment to sit home 4 PBS &amp; collect entitlements

@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle Hilary Clinton isn't President, &amp; there's much evidence she was opposed to Putin. Trump's who we have to investigate

@realDonaldTrump Obamacare wasn't a disaster for the poor and lower middle income folks &amp; marginally increased costs for mid-high net worth.
@realDonaldTrump you're incapable of accepting accountability, and too weak psychologically to maintain awareness of yourself. SAD!
@POTUS Journalists are tasked w pressing hard for facts. Try telling the truth &amp; asking your representatives do the same. Problem resolved!

@AZiffell @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS an investigation into any Russian ties outside of IC/official govt business is bipartisan.
@AZiffell @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS read a timeline or sequence of events on contacts between Trump's team and Russia
@AZiffell @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS an investigation isn't a witch hunt. An investigation is underway. Much evidence of ties thus far.

@JAlexander319 @FoxNews For me, Russia influencing our election is more disconcerting than another country having early stage nuclear power
@JAlexander319 @FoxNews no, the Iranian Nuclear deal was a meeting of multi countries all working to limit the expansion of nuclear weapons
@JancoBoy @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS how's that a liberal message? Americans deserve a full bipartisan investigation, across the US govt
@wordsmatta @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS a full investigation is warranted, period. It's not a partisan issue.
@JAlexander319 @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS even more reason for a full investigation. It's not a partisan issue.
@FoxNews @TuckerCarlson @POTUS it doesn't matter what you recall, there's enough Russian ties at this point to warrant a full investigation.

@basicplayer1 @susanprince1 @FoxNews Flynn, Sessions, Trump are being investigated for working with Russia, and potentially treason.
@basicplayer1 @susanprince1 @FoxNews both Clinton and Lynch were part of the US govt

@mkship5336 @FoxNews @POTUS Investigation of officials &amp; their appointees is necessary when potential treason has occurred. Democracy wins.

@FoxNews @POTUS the constitution and anti-corruption laws aren't cards 2 be played, they are the bedrock of our democracy. Investigate Trump
@FoxNews @HowardKurtz @MediaBuzzFNC he recused himself bc it's unethical to lead an investigation he's potentially part of, not bc of media
@realDonaldTrump it's not a witch hunt. It's a fact based investigation that resulted in Flynn's resignation &amp; GOP calling for more details.
@realDonaldTrump To be clear, several have withdrawn after failing to fill out all the release forms, &amp; Flynn resigned. You're so pathetic.
@MattSkins918782 @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider Not Obama. Flynn, Manafort,&amp; Sessions were in direct contact w Russia. Investigate Trump et al...
@FoxNews That cooould be true... what was the nature of your discussion w a known Russian spy? Under what circumstance was a mtg warranted?
@MattSkins918782 @FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider grouping me with "lefties" isn't appropriate, &amp; its a distraction. Sessions is part of #Russiagate

@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider False equivalency. Clinton &amp; Lynch were US officials. Sessions was colluding w Russian officials. Shady v treason

@susanprince1 @FoxNews To be clear, there's video of the confirmation hearing where Sessions lies, and video/audio evidence of him w Russia
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider How is identifying a bold face lie from Sessions regarding Russia a partisan issue? This is about treason, not GOP.

@LizaStreit @FoxNews Freedom of press is protected by the 1st Amendment. It prevents gov from interfering w distribution of info &amp; opinions.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews yes. It's unAmerican to squash a free press, lie to the American ppl, and attack unfavorable reporting in the media.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews that's not far right, that's factual. What he's been saying is happening v what's happening don't add up.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews the leaks in the press office weren't jeopardizing nat security, they were revealing Trump's misinformation and lies.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews it's not Spicer, nor Trump's right to choose the press and how their covered by individual agencies. It's unAmerican.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews first you stated I'm "throwing anything at Trump." Then I proved that wasn't true. Now you're defending what happened?
@CowboyShaneHtwn that didn't answer my question, nor did it elaborate on your point. It's just more rhetoric...
@CowboyShaneHtwn it's costing businesses money they'd mostly be spending anyhow if they're responsible. How is it costing ppl trillions?
@PressSec they weren't wrong... why are you allowing this administration to destroy your credibility? U were respected in the industry once.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews plus that "one time" they were excluded from a press gaggle in Spicer's office.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews that's true, one is subject to monitoring, but a which hunt of this nature is beyond the scope for press office staff.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews it's not over stated. He's clearly trying to navigate around free Press in a consistent way not seen since Nixon.
@LizaStreit @FoxNews then, subsequently, he blocked those same outlets from asking questions during several briefings
@LizaStreit @FoxNews Since swear-in, every exclusive, all positive mention is for Fox &amp; smaller GOP leans. While calling other outlets fake.
@FoxNews the question is, was the loss of life the result of a critical mission, or a display of power for a political TV stunt...
@FoxNews @HowardKurtz @MediaBuzzFNC amid Trump's anti-press rhetoric, it isn't overblown. Trump et al are showing extreme prejudice...

@politicalWow @EricShawnTV @FoxNews Clinton was Secretary of State, not the President. This warrants a special prosecutor.
@EricShawnTV @FoxNews Yes, absolutely. #TrumpRussia
@Jessielynn1026 I agree! it was put together by @mathew. Please share!
@FoxNews Trump's illegal actions are documented in this timeline. https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi check it out. #TrumpRussia
@TrumpATeam1 @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @PressSec more ppl need to see the facts. View the timeline here: https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi #Trumprussia
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @PressSec see this timeline about Trump's Russia ties https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi very incriminating facts. #TrumpRussia
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @PressSec why isn't there anything about Russia? See this timeline https://t.co/otGjCcCRoI it's Fact... #TrumpRussia
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_ @FoxNewsInsider Trump needs to acknowledge the Russia ties. See this timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi #Trumprussia
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump please focus more energy on Trump's Russia ties. This timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi says it all #TrumpRussia
@MichaelEDavis17 @FoxNews @AlDAmatoNY @TomPerez Clinton is old news. This is about our current President being treasonous. #TrumpRussia
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine it's all going to come out thru the investigation #Trumprussia
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine feel welcome to keep offering justifications for Trump's illegal activity. #russiagate
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine Trump's recorded words, time/date/location, and fin records are clear verifiable evidence.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine facts are facts. Investigation is warranted &amp; would be with far less than what's in the link.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine you're clearly diverting attention from the facts, or make this seem open to interpretation
@FoxNews @foxnewspolitics Special prosecutor is a must. See this timeline - https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi it's clearly not a partisan issue.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine you're entitled to your own interpretation. The laws are clear and the facts are revealing...
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine Trump may be impeached by end of year following the investigation
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine he clearly lied about his relationship with  Putin, has $ implications, &amp; was assisted by him
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine there's literally no way you read it, &amp; watched the videos, all while responding quickly.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine conspiracy theories are full of speculation. The timeline is full of facts. Very different.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine again, diverting from the point. The timeline shows evidence of illegal connections w Russia
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine please read thru the timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi lots of facts, absolutely no crazy.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine so.. you haven't refuted anything with facts. You're just name calling &amp; suggesting I'm crazy
@POTUS you're lying... see this timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi It has verifiable evidence of Trump's connections to Russia... SAD!
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine This isn't about Obama, it's about currently known facts https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi check it out
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine for more info on when and how, read the timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi lots of proof.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine Read the timeline here https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi there's quite a bit of verifiable evidence...
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine the FBI should deep dive into this timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi during the investigation!
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine that's your opinion. Fact is, Trump may have broken many laws, &amp; investigation is warranted.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine Trump may love the USA, but that doesn't mean he didn't commit treason, nor violate the law.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine This isn't a partisan issue. I didn't like Bush, and I hadn't called for an investigation.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine your response makes no sense in context of this convo. Trump needs to be investigated. Period
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine never said we should be calling Putin names. We should be investigating Trump for treason.
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine there is substance. Read thru the timeline. Watch Trump's conflicting speeches.
@MichaelEDavis17 @FoxNews @AlDAmatoNY @TomPerez I'm not concerned by the age of the facts. Moreso by the implications of treason by our Pres
@ignorancecosts @FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @seanspicer Hilary isn't President, and thus a non threat. Trump is... we need to investigate further
@abraves277 @FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine look thru the audio/video recordings of Trump, there are clear and undeniable links. Facts
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @seanspicer This is soft ball reporting... we want to hear about Trump's Russia ties https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi Read up!
@FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine How did the conversation not talk about Trump's Russia ties?? https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi see that timeline!
@FoxNews @seanspicer @JudgeJeanine why aren't we talking more about Trump's Russia ties? https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi - check out that timeline!
@FoxNews @AlDAmatoNY @TomPerez let's hear more about Trump's Russia ties - check out this timeline https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi FACTS w/o opinion
@sfdudeknows @luv2research @soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @FoxNews I say put it to a special nationwide vote.
@luv2research @soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews who determines which regs are unnecessary? What's the metric or measure?
@luv2research @soccerwheels73 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews Trump has openly stated which regs he'll focus on in interviews &amp; speeches. Read up pls.
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump let's focus on Russian ties. Read this timeline: https://t.co/otGjCcUsNi. Full of facts, not opinions!
@luv2research @FoxNews Regs on monopolies are a big reason we can go elsewhere when a company does us wrong. Fixing regs good, removing bad
RT @20committee: #KremlinGate isn't about Left v. Right. It's about protecting USA &amp; West from a KGB thug who has thousands of nuclear weap‚Ä¶
@FoxNews @mschlapp @POTUS he's teaching people that it's okay to outright lie and provide half-truths while ignoring overwhelming facts.
@CNN @GovChristie Only a guilty party would oppose a non-partisan special prosecutor. The claims against Trump are serious, and warrant such
@MichiMomMe @FoxNews there are so many clear ties to Russia. Do some research, please. It's very alarming...
@SenSanders @realDonaldTrump LMAO!!! If he didn't feel the burn before, he does now ü§£üòÇüëç
@realDonaldTrump Dude, the total population of EVERY rally you've thrown added together does not add up to as many ppl as the women's march!
@FoxNews absolutely necessary. Trump, Dems, &amp; GOP are all motivated parties. Need a non affiliated special prosecutor leading the charge.
@POTUS Pathetic! Let's all keep the focus on Russian ties, and not get distracted by this calculated act of cowardice!
@realDonaldTrump Why avoid briefly breaking up the political divide with some humor? Oh, right, bc you're an egomaniac who can't take a joke
@Tomatjax @FoxNews let's fix them v remove them. Protecting species diversity is important for sustaining humanity long term.
@BNeessen @FoxNews with Pres not there, all the jokes will literally be on him üòÇ
@BNeessen @FoxNews Jokes at the dinner are traditionally at the Presidents expense, with a few the Pres then launches at foes.
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews Dems needed super majority to pass it. Accomodated GOP to get thru senate after house.
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews it cost some people more, but again, millions more benefited. It could use improvement
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews FYI, GOP stopped ACA passing til limits on $ insurance could raise prices were removed.
@FoxNews it'll be much funnier without him. Jokes on him! ü§£
@FoxNews Pathetic! Welcoming humor into the political discourse is a time-honored tradition. Showing some humility is beyond Trump. SAD! ü§î
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews Premiums/Deductibles went up every year regardless. Millions of ppl were helped by ACA.
@EricShawnTV @FoxNews @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @susanferrechio @dcexaminer Nope! It's healthy to welcome humor into the political discourse..
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews removing them isn't fixing them. Main st Americans will not benefit from removing them
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews there is much room to fix regs, and improve exception use cases/processes.
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews There's not that much overlap in regs. In fact, most are extremely specific.
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews The ACA helped millions more ppl than it hurt. It's not socialism, its human decency.
@soccerwheels73 @OleMissRanger @sfdudeknows @FoxNews Regulations aren't all perfect. I get it. But they are necessary to protect the US ppl.
@OleMissRanger @soccerwheels73 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews quite a lot, actually. I've sold several I've started, and I'm a biz owner now.
@OleMissRanger @soccerwheels73 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews the US govt isn't a child, and federal regulations aren't childish. They protect ppl
@Tomatjax @FoxNews regs aren't perfect, but they exist as broad protection measures. They could be fixed, but eliminating them will hurt ppl
@Tomatjax @FoxNews regulations limiting how much pesticide farmers are allowed to use on crops help prevent runoff into rivers/streams.
@Tomatjax @FoxNews I'm informed. Please go to ur news source of preference, &amp; search "trump water regulations." You'll see what he's ending
@Tomatjax @FoxNews Trump already advocated ending the clean water reg I referenced... read up!
@RussShakelford1 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI @SecretService you're mentally ill, dude. Enjoy your alternate reality.
@FoxNews @EDeMarche a 70 yr old man, w a lifetime of being insulated by wealth, &amp; countless media experience knows better than DHS. Right...
@Tomatjax @FoxNews so regulated labels on hazardous chemicals, food safety regs, &amp; clean water regs don't protect the people? Wake up, dude
@RussShakelford1 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI note, topic of this conversation is the virtue of the "leakers" in the FBI. Get back on topic, dude
@RussShakelford1 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI I didn't make any threats. I implied Trump has committed treason, &amp; would be subject to death penalty.
@RussShakelford1 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI you said fave, not have... yes, treason is punishable by death. I hope Trump passes quickly.
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews not panicking, but Trump has already stated which he'd like to remove, &amp; Pruitt is EPA Admin. Not promising for  US
@JarvisStream @FoxNews given on-going investigations, potential reveal in a tax release, &amp; Trump's media war, not much reason 4 optimism
@JarvisStream @FoxNews look at the history of Trump's testament &amp; tribute. Non-existent until all of a sudden around the election.
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews EPA makes mistakes too. I can personally say I've seen improvements in polution in several major cities &amp; nat parks
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews you may be circumspect enough to always protect your own interests, but most ppl aren't. That's why regs exist.
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews before dumping/water protection regs, many streams/rivers were toxic. Those are EPA regulations on the chop block.
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews I'm not saying govt or regs are perfect. They could use fixing. I'm saying that regs protect more than they hurt
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews it's not about good v bad. It's about safe v not safe for consumers.
@JarvisStream @FoxNews Trump is very clearly a textbook narcissist. Self-centered folks don't frequently give lest it benefits them.
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews not limiting banks could result in higher overdraft fees, higher account fees, poorer lending behavior, etc
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews not performing sometimes costly &amp; regulated electrical testing would result in more fires
@ouachitarunner @FoxNews doesn't need to be malicious. Not labeling a food product produced in a factory w peanuts could kill allergic ppl.
@FoxNews Pres Trump, a private billionaire citizen w little history of helping anyone but himself v. Service Members in FBI. I choose FBI...
@soccerwheels73 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews there are many use cases where regs are challenging for businesses. They exist for a reason.
@soccerwheels73 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews not everyone runs their business with consumer protections, nor would, were they not required by regs.
@soccerwheels73 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews Wait until biz isn't regulated for consumer fees, Resturaunt's fridge temps aren't regulated, etc.
@RussShakelford1 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI I don't think faving firing squads is in the constitution.
@jmoad35 @sfdudeknows @FoxNews there are 1000s of regs, &amp; likely less than 50 that have directly impacted any of us. Let's fix them v remove
@gino_fassi @Joanne1225 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI I'm not rattled, but annoyed. There's no room for ad hominem in healthy debates or comments.
@sfdudeknows @FoxNews some regs, not most. Some regs could be improved via common sense approaches. Removing the regs won't improve them.
@sfdudeknows @FoxNews note: removing them would be more profitable for me financially. I think the impact to everyday ppl is more important
@sfdudeknows @FoxNews I own several businesses. Some regs are poorly implemented. Fixing them is better for consumers than removing them.
@Roger3s @FoxNews are you implying that business regulations are a form of socialism?
@Joanne1225 @gino_fassi @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI your sissy comment &amp; acronym were inappropriate and baseless.
@Joanne1225 @gino_fassi @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI he may love the USA, I don't know. He definitely has ties to Russia, both direct and indirect.
@sfdudeknows @FoxNews Trump's clearly stated several times which he's focused on. Dodd-Frank, EPA emissions &amp; runoff, and pharma/FDA regs.
@FoxNews @POTUS Most of the regulations being eliminated protect consumers &amp; American ppl. Do you trust companies to protect our interests?
@FoxNews Most of the regulations being eliminated protect consumers &amp; the American people. Do you trust companies to protect our interests?
@gino_fassi @Joanne1225 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI This isn't a party agenda, it's a USA agenda. We need to know about Trump's ties to Russia
@POTUS why are you still talking about the election so much?
@POTUS I thought you'd win, and I'm very disappointed that I was accurate in predicting the gullibility of nearly half of America. SAD!
@RussShakelford1 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI fave a firing squad for what?
@Joanne1225 @gino_fassi @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI your inappropriate comments point to your lack of value add points. Please refrain from insults
@webvixen @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI you're entitled to disagree, w/o apology. Likely few in the intelligence community believed Trump would win
@webvixen @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI Comey certainly didn't do Clinton any favors. This isn't about him, nor the election. It's about the leaks.
@Joanne1225 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI ad hominem, great use of logical fallacy to demonstrate you have no real point to share.
@Joanne1225 @max_burbank @PeterPrunski @FoxNews @POTUS well, if he loves those values, he certainly doesn't practice them.
@Zandsabar @max_burbank @Kelsnwade6195 @PeterPrunski I watch/read Fox, MSNBC, Breitbart, CNN, Russia Times, BBC. Fox &amp; RT are most biased.
@Kelsnwade6195 @max_burbank @PeterPrunski @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI the video link I said is to a Fox News recording and article of Trump
@Kelsnwade6195 @max_burbank @PeterPrunski @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI https://t.co/Jxxz0Qevyt
@theRandyPaulin @1luckyterry @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI there are clear money ties to major Russian oil. Both manafort &amp; Flynn had Russian ties
@1luckyterry @theRandyPaulin @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI one man's 250 character tweet is sufficient evidence for you, v doing your own research?
@EllenAr63457846 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI voters were unaware, &amp; they're sharing awareness. Pres treason is important information for Americans.
@america_lost @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI thanks for your insight and wisdom. Intel folks are risking their career (&amp; lives) to share info with US
@LindaHa54312622 @claybrooke_dean @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI Fox News is biased far-right. CNN is fairly moderate minus Don Lemon. I like reality
@1luckyterry @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI We've learned too much for one tweet. Research what's been shared on Flynn, Manafort, Trumps $ ties, etc
@BigJoe570 @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI traitors? Who are they betraying, the people of US or the President they believe conspired with Russia?
@LindaHa54312622 @claybrooke_dean @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI honestly, ur comment added no value. Intel community is releasing the truth on Trump!
@1luckyterry @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI we are learning it, through leaks. We likely wouldn't know, if it weren't for the intel community leaks.
@gino_fassi @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI I'm a sissy for commending folks that risk their lives daily to protect the country, &amp; calling out Trump.
@HenkjanStereo @max_burbank @PeterPrunski @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI Russia hackers released DNC documents/research during the election.
@ellabella1792 @Dannaboo @DemsTalk @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI please elaborate, Gabriella, &amp; call out the ignorance so there's more awareness.
@Dannaboo @DemsTalk @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI that's nonsense. Trump wasn't calling for finding leakers until they started leaking info about him
@claybrooke_dean @FoxNews @POTUS @FBI I proudly breathe air through my mouth. Oxygen helps my brain work good. Intel folks aren't bad guys.
@FoxNews @tedcruz I'd advise not using words like bat, crap, &amp; crazy together. You look like Eddie Munster, and you're full of crazy crap üí©
@FoxNews This is such biased reporting. Do you remember the 8 years of obstruction from the GOP? Dems are minority in congress, its no war.
@FoxNews @POTUS @FBI The leaks are a clear attempt by the intelligence community to protect the country from Trump. They are patriots!
@realDonaldTrump The leakers are patriots protecting the country from you. They aren't leaking security secrets, they are leaking your BS
@durbin92810 @FoxNews @michellemalkin @FoxNewsInsider Most are here illegally. Why?
@FoxNews just in time for destruction of our planet by selfish, short-sighted, indignant scientifically inept leadership (SS ISIL) aka GOP.
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider Hitler didn't rise to power on the promise of genocide. He supplanted the media, lied, manipulated supporters...
@FoxNews @michellemalkin @FoxNewsInsider sanctuary is an age old concept of protecting those whom are under persecution. They're not outlaws
@lorelifry Solutions may be found by tactically addressing the open wounds of political discourse, then calm debate towards common ground
@lorelifry screaming isn't usually folks first choice. Peaceful protests have gone unrecognized by GOP, and as such, folks tend to escalate
@FoxNews @PeteHegseth @joniernst it's not often possible to quiet dissent by ignoring issues &amp; cherry picking talking points. Ppl are upset
@ericries I'm interested. Thanks Eric!
@realDonaldTrump Peaceful protests don't organize by themselves. There's planning, &amp; it also takes people that want to be there. You're SAD!
@FoxNews @FredFleitz intelligence and intel staff generally lean independent. Where are you getting your left leaning stats from?
@texrebel61 @Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews one state does not a country make... Nor does the crime rate there depict your point.
@texrebel61 @Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews our country was built by, for, and with immigrants.
@texrebel61 @Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews all immigrants illegal &amp; trying to kill us? Some are illegal &amp; few are plotting to kill.
@Supersjwbasher @texrebel61 @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews The founding of the country was the creation of the American people, as a cohesive unit
@Supersjwbasher @texrebel61 @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews that makes no sense. There weren't "American" people before the country was founded.
@Supersjwbasher @texrebel61 @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews funny that nearly every founding father is quoted saying otherwise... please comprehend!
@GutterPupTravel @ripbosshogg @realDonaldTrump dude, you're just reposting the same misinformation on multiple different comments.
@GutterPupTravel @realDonaldTrump Fox News is not source enough to declare something factually accurate. Have you been to Sweden?
@realDonaldTrump Have you recently been to Sweden? Whatever you're watching on TV is wrong. It's safe, open, beautiful, &amp; fun. Try a visit!
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor You're casting doubt on all other press outlets as leaning left? Facts aren't liberal, &amp; when they are, they're lies
@FoxNews McCain may be past his prime, but he's no less a patriot. His thoughtful commentary on Trump's behavior deserves consideration.
@Gr2134 @crehage @realDonaldTrump near every other major media outlet is not reporting up to Trump's self aggrandizing standards...
@Gr2134 @crehage @realDonaldTrump Trump near exclusively promotes Fox, and vice versa. His press secretary &amp; Comm director should brief him.
@realDonaldTrump the Southern White House isn't a thing. I don't appreciate taxpayer money going towards your private snow bird residence.
@crehage @realDonaldTrump are you serious? You want a President that relies on stories from a TV network?
@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews your exceptional favoritism for Fox is unacceptable. TV isn't a solid source for public stmnts &amp; policy concerns!
@FoxNews Serenity Now... Insanity later.
@MallieMe59 @hcsinger @Sven_Golly7 @FoxNews none of my comments have refuted Trump's presidency. I'm noting Trump's historic unfavorable #s
@pourmecoffee @FoxNews @Reuters I was there. It wasn't a rally, it was a Q&amp;A about the stimulus, as you noted. It was a very open discussion
@Sven_Golly7 @FoxNews Most of my family voted for him, and they are no longer on the bandwagon. Here's hoping for a 4 year presidency!
@FrankPerri6 Don Lemon's program is clearly leftist. I'm not a fan of him for that reason. But most on the network aren't so left leaning.
@FrankPerri6 Hannity &amp; Fox's broader coverage leans right, &amp; at times far-right. It's by no means objective, &amp; rarely factually accurate
@Sven_Golly7 @FoxNews every moderate conservative/liberal, independent, all the way to far left person I've heard from isn't pleased w Trump
@Sven_Golly7 @FoxNews @POTUS Forget the polls, his actions speak for themselves. He's holding a campaign rally today...
@FoxNews @AshPratte @POTUS Trump is both combative and defensive, showing signs of extreme narcissism and behavioral issues. He needs help!
@FoxNews @POTUS What President had such low satisfaction numbers the 1st month in office that he had to campaign after the election? TRUMP!
@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump President Trump is demeaning the post of the Presidency by attack in freedom of speech, &amp; focusing on ego v the US
@FoxNews @POTUS Billionaire Trump hasn't been for the "working person" his whole career. Now he's changed? Unlikely.
@FoxNews @LisaMarieBoothe Media is covering what Trump's doing, unfortunately, most of it has inherently negative consequences. REAL NEWS!
@FoxNews @SheriffClarke what violent Philly protests? I live in Philly, I often walk past/through protests around town, no issues. FAKE NEWS
@FoxNews @RandPaul more to destabilize America, divide the nation, and debase the objective respect of the post of the Presidency. Congrats!
@FoxNews @POTUS what a short sighted action. How long does this keep coal jobs? Give these people sustainable jobs that will last!
@PhillipWhillier @FoxNews Don't need CNN to see the Pres lying. I watched the briefing, &amp; he lied about things that are common knowledge
@FrankPerri6 PS - I watch/read Fox, MSNBC, HuffPost, Breitbart, CNN, RussianTimes, and BBC. The leans are more evident that way.
@FrankPerri6 Which media outlet do you consider least biased? None are truly objective, but I've found CNN most centered of major US news
@FoxNews @POTUS I think a more appropriate headline would be less than 50% trust the President to tell the truth more than other sources.
@FrankPerri6 Trump has ignored the CBC, the reporter asked if he'd include them, &amp; Trump told her to setup a mtg. That's unacceptable.
@FrankPerri6 what facts aren't being reported by the mass media Trump targets? CNN is centered, Fox is mostly opinion &amp; logical fallacy.
@jesslovestrump @realDonaldTrump your post is inappropriate &amp; doesn't state anything about your views. It's simply name calling.
@RiceeChrispies @realDonaldTrump who mentioned Clinton? This post is about Trump's attempt to discredit the media and lie about his W.H. Ops
@realDonaldTrump Casual observers can see your W.H. is running poorly. GOP controlled congress, &amp; you're still having issues &amp; failing. SAD!
@fnhog @susan_suememaw7 @FoxNews I clearly stated "if," and the evidence of lies are clear, such as Trump's news briefing. Pls Comprehend!
@realDonaldTrump Historians ranked Obama 12th Pres overall. You're going to be ranked near last. Enjoy your lasting legacy, as a LOSER!
@FoxNews @CDerespina Trump needs to stop targeting the intelligence community, &amp; focus on being President to a divided nation...
@FoxNews its hard to assure partner nations of anything when the President blatantly lies &amp; spreads false information.
@FoxNews Considering the obstruction he faced on every single initiative from GOP congress, his policies saved us from $ meltdown &amp; WWIII
@FoxNews @THEHermanCain it's completely irresponsible that Fox is furthering the notion that fake news is such a prevalent issue. So so SAD!
@FoxNews it's unacceptable that Pruitt was confirmed despite such strong objections from the party that has prioritized the environment.
@realDonaldTrump please stop calling legitimate news sources fake. It's eroding at one of the hallmark's of America's greatest freedoms..
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Dude, calling CNN fake news causes you to lose ALL credibility with 50% of the population
@realDonaldTrump Rush Limbaugh is widely recognized as far right... what are mass media, &amp; most Dems saying? You're Pres of US, not the GOP!
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN I keep waiting for you to behave maturely and in a presidential manner. Please get real...
@FoxNews @JudgeJeanine @FoxNewsInsider several retired GOP intelligence officials have expressed Trump concerns, this isn't just Dems...
@FoxNews @RepPeteKing Does Russia have nuclear capabilities? Yes... Then it's a major military power, regardless of its economic influence.
@FoxNews @BernardGoldberg @POTUS shouldn't that be cause for concern?
@texrebel61 @Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews even if your ancestors came in the legal way, they were still immigrants. Pls comprehend
RT @donileo: lmao RT @KillAbreu: Kellyanne Conway avoiding questions about #TrumpImpeachmentParty https://t.co/HosJwhQ8rt
@cindi_kennedy @FoxNews thanks for your insightful addition to this comment string.
@susan_suememaw7 @FoxNews DOJ will review it and determine what can and can't be shared publicly.
@susan_suememaw7 @FoxNews I said "if." Theres proof already of deceipt, withholding information, &amp; ties to Russia. Most is still classified
@RPK_ @FoxNews it's criminal that Flynn lied, especially considering his role at the time. What's more disconcerting are Trump's ties here.
@realDonaldTrump by repeatedly attacking the intelligence community, you're giving them cause to come at you with everything they've got...
@RPK_ @FoxNews @SteveKingIA @seanhannity it wasn't proven innocuous. Flynn lied, knowingly, to the Vice President, many reps, &amp; American ppl
@RPK_ @FoxNews @SteveKingIA @seanhannity these fucks, whom work in the shadows to keep us safe &amp; protected so you can slam them on twitter..
@FoxNews @SteveKingIA @seanhannity Why are you focusing on leaks more than the criminal implications they suggest of both Trump &amp; his admin?
@FoxNews @seanhannity there's clear evidence Flynn discussed sanctions ahead of the administration changing, which is explicitly illegal.
@FoxNews if Trump is actually proven to be linked to the many claims being investigated against/around him, that's grounds for impeachment!
@FoxNews @piersmorgan except his nominee for national security, and several of his top campaign staffers. Oh wait, several close links!
@FoxNews @oreillyfactor @POTUS there's audio recordings, which likely won't be made public, but certainly qualifies as credible evidence...
@texrebel61 @Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews u're a descendent of an immigrant, &amp; u wouldn't be here were ur family not given rights.
@FoxNews @FoxNewsInsider R u suggesting the intelligence community is largely Dem? Perhaps there's a correlation btwn Dems &amp; Intelligence...
@cindykatz2287 @FoxNews @PressSec Obama fired Flynn, &amp; Trump brought Flynn back, along with Flynn's crew. Do some research.. this is serious
@realDonaldTrump Servicemembers have to leak intel to protect our nation in your non-transparent admin. Treason isn't a partisan issue.
@FoxNews @IngrahamAngle @POTUS using a compromised official who potentially committed treason &amp; had high security clearance? That's some ram
@FoxNews If Trump didn't approve of what she were saying, she'd be fired already. Ethics committee needs to look at Pres. Trump
@FoxNews Kellyanne Conway is Trump's mouthpiece. Trump himself should be investigated, as well.
@KellyKjrite @FoxNews Pls provide proof that this happened during the OA. ~35-45% of govt employees identify as Dems. See gallup polls!
@FoxNews @PressSec we should be calling for replacement of everyone Flynn brought in with him. This is a major compromise of our nation!
@FoxNews @PressSec Time to be bipartisan in recognizing the risk our exposure here poses to national security.  This is wholesale bad news!
@FoxNews were this an Obama error, Fox would be calling for impeachment. Trump had a compromised person @ our highest security clearance
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNews dual-citizens are not necessarily "people from another country." Many are born here and seek citizenship elsewhere
@FoxNews @seanhannity @jorgeramosnews This question is full of logical fallacy. False dilemma, faulty analogy... Fox is being irresponsible
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNews you keep repeating inaccurate information. Fact: Dual-Citizens aren't aliens. Please comprehend.
@Supersjwbasher @texrebel61 @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews individuals whom are dual citizens aren't aliens. Green card holders also have rights.
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNews President cannot mass terminate citizenship based on religious affiliation nor country of origin. Pls comprehend!
@Supersjwbasher @texrebel61 @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews I've said dual citizens have constitutional rights, and were included in ban. Pls read!
@texrebel61 @Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews Never said aliens have constitutional right, though they've got inalienable human rights
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNews dual-citizens? An American citizen is afforded all the rights within the Constitution. Please read.

@FoxNews @Nigel_Farage shout from the rooftops that this sort of journalism promotes hysteria &amp; fear-mongering, among other negative things
@FoxNews @Nigel_Farage folks from every country pose a threat, including our own. How many convicts are US citizens that committed murder?
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNews I said nothing about "foreigners" nor "aliens." I said green card holders and dual-citizens. Pls read.
@BernieSanders Sadly, I'm more concerned about the things he said he'd do that he's following through on... scary!
@FoxNews now, go do some investigative journalism on these refugees. College students, families, and decent human beings fleeing oppression
@FoxNews @BlakemanB I've seen no consensus among senior leaders or intelligence officials suggesting the ban was an effective safety measure
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews The constitution, &amp; its amendments protect against several components of Trump's exec order. Read up
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews not to mention, nearly everyone here is a descendent of an immigrant. Only 1% Native American pop.
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews It also affects green card holders &amp; dual citizens, whom are protected by the constitution.
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews Did you read the executive order? It was much broader in scope than just illegal immigrants.
@Supersjwbasher @FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews its the President's right to create exec orders, not violate the constitution. Pres power has limits
@realDonaldTrump @CNN your characterization of what happened is disjointed from reality. Bernie was critical of you and your claims. SAD!
@realDonaldTrump if your haphazard ban hadn't been in violation of the constitution, this issue wouldn't exist. Look in the mirror. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump you embarrass America when you makes posts like this on the daily. This isn't a school playground, it's the world stage...
@FoxNewsSunday @FoxNews Wrong! Checks and balances exist so that the President's power is capable of being called into question, and curbed.
@JrStaffer @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ And other ideas, indeed. Good point!
@FoxNews @AsraNomani why would a news agency print such an inflammatory headline without any clarification or facts to back up such a claim?
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 I'll close with my initial &amp; factual point. ~3M more votes were cast for Dems.
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 I'll close with my initial &amp; factual point. ~3M more votes were cast for Dems.
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 I didn't say you're lying. I said you're not substantiating.
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 odd that many of Gina's messages are translated from Spanish, &amp; Chuck's from French
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 I can't comment on your smarts. You're certainly not substantiating your claims.
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 can you substantiate that claim?
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 I'm not aware of much violence in the majority of protests that have occurred.
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 that's such a broad unjustified claim. Popular vote suggests otherwise
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 Main St Americans may be tired of the Dem's ideas, but more voters supported Dems
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 you posed no question.
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 that doesn't negate my point about the volume of voters which supported Dem's ideas
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 Republicans currently have majority in the senate/house, and the Presidency.
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 How was graciously accepting your "whatever" comment a sign of denial/liberalism?
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 I'd rather debate the premise of my initial post, v the merits of your name calling
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 Thank you.
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 I've not made a negative remark nor comment. Stating facts isn't deranged, nor am I
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 My primary point is valid. Democrat's ideas are still relevant per the popular vote
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 instead of addressing my valid points you're belittling my schooling???
@dmduncan2010 @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna not according to the overwhelming majority of nearly every senator, congressman, and gov
@bridgetknepper @JSMBodywork @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ prosecution of who and or what?
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 rather, posed as valid or logical arguments
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 I'm calling out logical fallacies, which are being posed as arguments.
@ChuckBlair20 Thought-terminating clich√© ‚Äì used to quell cognitive dissonance, &amp; move on to other topics by ending debate with a cliche
@ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413  False analogy ‚Äì argument by analogy in which the analogy is poorly suited.
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 @Epignosis8 you've been an echo in support of @ChuckBlair20
Cherry picking ‚Äì act of pointing at individual data that confirm a particular position, while ignoring significant data that may contradict
Ad hominem - attacking the character, ability, motive of person making the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument
False attribution ‚Äì an advocate appeals to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased or fabricated source in support of an argument.
Circular reasoning ‚Äì when the reasoner begins with what he or she is trying to end up with; sometimes called assuming the conclusion.
Begging the question ‚Äì providing what is essentially the conclusion of the argument as a premise.
Argument from silence ‚Äì where the conclusion is based on the absence of evidence, rather than the existence of evidence.
Anecdotal fallacy ‚Äì personal experience to extrapolate without a statistically significant number of cases to form compelling evidence
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 @Epignosis8 fallacies used thus far in your collective arguments:
@ginareyna @dmduncan2010 @MeyerJmeyer5413 @ChuckBlair20 @Epignosis8 @realDonaldTrump your arguments are full of logical fallacies...
@thedoorofbliss @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Trump won the presidency. Clinton received more votes from individual voters. Dem ideas still matter
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @MeyerJmeyer5413 @Epignosis8 @realDonaldTrump @WashTimes Broad voter fraud, not onesy twosey.
@FoxNews @TheBlazeHotList I'm a liberal, and you're not reflecting my views. I want immigration reform, with border control.
@ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 @ChuckBlair20 @Epignosis8 @realDonaldTrump A few personal testaments from folks on twitter isn't proof
@ginareyna @MeyerJmeyer5413 @ChuckBlair20 @Epignosis8 @realDonaldTrump To be clear, this is still hearsay. Show evidence of voter fraud, pls
@myronben666 @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Democracy isn't perfect, but it has continued to evolve and improve over time.
@MillerTime802 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ This whole thread is about Dem ideas still being relevant. Not Trump/Clinton campaign strategy.
@myronben666 @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_  founders did their best to protect against a monarchy.
@Remi6216 @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Dem ideas aren't weaker/stronger than Rep ideas.
@thedoorofbliss @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ pop vote represents that more individual voters cast Dem votes versus Rep votes. That's meaningful.
@GLeztits @FoxNews They are two states, among the four most populated, including CA, TX, FL &amp; NY. Every vote cast matters.
@ChuckBlair20 @x4PITTS1BURGH2x @ginareyna @FoxNews  I can't see comments on @FoxNews posts. Only replies to my comments in notifications
@x4PITTS1BURGH2x @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews Is that the kind of news source you want? One that shuts down differing views/opinions?
@x4PITTS1BURGH2x @ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna I'm no longer able to see comments on @FoxNews posts.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna Please educate me on the evidence you're referencing that shows nearly 3 million+ voted illegally
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @GregAbbott_TX one down, about 3 million to go...
@RaeBridges99 @ktfos55 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ What does that have to do with anything I've stated?
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 you're basing your argument on hearsay, and I'm basing mine on the bipartisan agreement that voter fraud's a farce.
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 How? Popular vote is a representation of each individual vote cast. About 3M more votes were Dem votes.
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 Please feel welcome to give up on me
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna FYI, I'm replying to a post that propagates rhetoric about the clarity of the election.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna I've made my point. Popular vote indicates individual votes cast. They were in favor of Dem ideology, by ~3M
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ My point is votes were cast for both Dems and Reps across the country.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ I don't speak for all Dems or Reps. I can't speak to why every individual vote was cast.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Trump won 31 of 50 states. More individuals voted for Clinton. Votes were cast for both.
@x4PITTS1BURGH2x @ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Perhaps, but that's not what most constitutional scholars believe.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ https://t.co/kEjBKhxNvq a decent comparison.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ The electoral college decides presidency, popular vote represents all votes cast.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ My point, which you hadn't addressed, is that Dem ideas aren't irrelevant per popular vote.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Asking you to be respectful isn't unmanly. I'm not "psycho-babbling," but sharing thoughts
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Please don't demean me, it's inappropriate and disrespectful.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Point is, everyone's thoughts matter.
@ginareyna @ChuckBlair20 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ The relevance is that our country was founded on "mob" rule.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ The natives were the first humans here, hence the term Native American.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ We live in a republic bc our founders immigrated here and claimed our land from the natives
@aseretsnibor @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Agreed!
@MaryhamptonLou @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ What polls?
@FreedomReign6 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ I didn't state that. I stated the popular vote suggests Dem ideas weren't clearly rejected.
@ChuckBlair20 @ginareyna @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ About half the county oppose the Dem ideology. Some voted for Trump for that reason.
@Hill861a @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ The poor choices of a few don't represent the entire population of Democrats.
@SuncoastPlace @leeshutterbug @CLewandowski_ I'm not arguing against Trump's win. I'm stating Democrat's ideas weren't "clearly" rejected
@BradRedden2 @dna175 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ This wasn't about winning the presidency. The comment was about relevance of Democrat's ideas.
@Hill861a @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Our country isn't all Republican nor Democrat. It's split, nearly down the middle. Please be respectful
@taragiles0 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Trump won the electoral vote &amp; the presidency. Clinton won the popular vote. Democrat's ideas count, too
@PublicSphere2 @timbo6213 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Ad Hominem attacks aren't appropriate, nor effective. Let's keep our discourse polite.
@2FlyersMom @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Clinton's loss does not mean that Democrat's ideas don't matter. That's inappropriate and un-American.
@Hill861a @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Do you realize how highly unlikely it is that 3 million popular votes were fraudulent?
@timbo6213 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ This post is more about Democrat's ideas, not Clinton. She was the nominee to represent those ideas.
@FoxNews @seanhannity @FoxNewsInsider You're fostering hysteria &amp; emboldening hate groups. The blood will be on Trump's hands, and Fox Newd
@2FlyersMom @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Whats that have to do with my point - Democrat's ideas weren't completely rejected based on popular vote
@PublicSphere2 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ There is bipartisan agreement that broad voter fraud didn't occur, and it's statistically unlikely.
@bwatson2261 @CLewandowski_ @FoxNews Trump won presidency. Clinton won popular vote. Facts, not whining. Democrat's ideas weren't decimated.
@ktfos55 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ Less about Clinton, and more about support for Democrat's ideas, as measured by the Presidential election.
@dna175 @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ I'm not arguing that he's president. Trump won based on the electoral vote, not the popular vote.
@SuncoastPlace @FoxNews @CLewandowski_ California is part of the United States, and the most populated state. Those votes count, too.
@FoxNews @CLewandowski_  Clinton won the popular vote. Not by a few hundred. By millions. Thus... more voters voted for Democrat's ideas.
@realDonaldTrump @POTUS you're declaring war against our constitution. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself. Oh, wait, you got checked!
