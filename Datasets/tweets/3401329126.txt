You do not.		Thank you

Never done a live tweet for a show before. Thank you to anyone who followed along. Hope it wasn’t too bad for the rest of you to see pop up on the feed. Carry on!
Ok, well that was kind of fun. I can understand why my husband likes this show so much. It is simple but had several storylines. Sort of like a comedy sitcom version of TNG or Voyager. I’ll probably watch more episodes with him.		#TheOrville
Well that was brief! Now we’re at the reception party in the ship. Everyone is hanging. Nerdy dude digs poetry guys stuff. Doc mom and her teenage son thank the Robo guy.		Oh shoot Cap is sitting alone and cartographer lady comes to join him. They’re gonna have a drink together.
Ok we’re finally to the home planet for homeboy’s “release” ceremony in front of everyone...
Oh shoot Robo guy totally owns it at the parent teacher conference and logically proved that the bad kid was indeed bad. He hacked his grades using his mother’s code to make it look like he had straight As so therefore he also had the skill to hack the replicator.
Cap goes to talk to the teacher to apologize.		Alright now we have a choice between multiple adds or one interactive add (forgot to mention we’re watching on fox app) very black Mirror here 😂
Ok Doc is taking her sassy Robo buddy to the parent teacher conference. Security Chief’s date is starting off awkward he read her a poem and then I think she’s ditching out on him now.
They’re such nerds on this show.
Nerdy helmsman is getting a makeover and dating advice from his buddy “the cool black dude” so he can ask out the hot cartographer. They’re going in the simulator club.	Level 8 was hitting on a woman who was cranky and just broke up 	9 still dating him	10 married and has a gun
Oh HELL NO the bad kid’s parents are coming to the Doc and saying that their son shouldn’t hangout with Doc’s preteen because Doc’s son is the one who hacked the replicator and is the bad influence. Oh NO, NO, NO. They’re going to all attend a parent teacher conference.
Oh shoot Second in Command is confronting the Cap with the shuttle log and telling him she knows about the drive buy. He teases her for dating the teacher. He’s an ass!
Security Chief lady is getting setup on a date. He’s a funky looking big headed alien and he knows it. Omg this is awkward. 🛑 but funny. They’re gonna give drinks a shot before deciding to go to the peeing ceremony as dates (apparently it is bad luck to come solo)

Oh Doc Mom is mad!  She’s roasting his ass when the little brother comes in trying to here. 😂		Oh now preteen is getting sassy and thinks he can break mom by giving her the silent treatment. 	Robot critiques Momm🙈 he said make the kid drink vodka until he is sick.
So they take their wine and go to the simulation deck for a moonlight beach scene. Where they spot the three preteen boys sipping on the vodka! 😳
Captain Ed takes a shuttle out “just for a drive”. 		Oh shoot Second in command is dating the TEACHER. They’re on a date night in her quarters when Captain Ed flies by and peeps on them.
Captain Ed (Seth McFarlane) is sad about hearing that his ex (the second in command) is seeing someone. He keeps looking at old photos of them together.
Of course that is how AI would think of as a possibility. Ok so now the kid and his two buddies hacked the replicator to give them a bottle of vodka. Then they got scolded the next day in class for not having done the reading for their homework.
So we got a new cartographer. She’s hot. They’re all awkward around her. 	The Doctor got into an argument with her preteen son about hanging with the “bad kid” 😂	The robot AI, after being explained it was puberty suggest stunting that chemically!

@RepDonBacon What is your plan for the federal employees of Nebraska?		Your dear leader i1 just said he will keep the government shut down for years if he has to.		What do you know about his plans for “military eminent domain” and “declaring a national emergency”?		@KETV @OWHnews @WOWT6News
