@tariqnasheed I read the myriad of comments. I agree with you. As the adult, he had a choice to move himself and his family away from the scenario. He chose to dig in. That girl posed no threat to him.

@tariqnasheed This dude isn‚Äôt your poster child. The Chiefs have stated more than once that he was released due to Hunt lying to them about what happened. Otherwise, you would have seen him cut in February when it occurred. And, he didn‚Äôt apologize to her. Moreover, it wasn‚Äôt his first offense

@tariqnasheed Chiefs didn‚Äôt release him in Feb when this happened. Chiefs released him when they found he lied to them.
@RICKBOGUS @Rayguyzzz @Tailinloop @tariqnasheed There‚Äôs a distinct difference between self defense and retaliation. In most cases, self defense is legal. Retaliation is not.
@tariqnasheed Looks like the Chiefs released him for lying, not the assault.
