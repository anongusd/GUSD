In most states, this lawsuit would be dead on arrival. But Alabama isn’t most states. Last year, voters in Alabama approved a personhood amendment to the Alabama Constitution that gives constitutional rights to fertilized eggs, embryos, and fetuses.		https://t.co/6re8PuhARK
If successful, the lawsuit could have devastating consequences for people of reproductive age in Alabama—especially those who could face the possibility of abusive partners going to court to seek restraining orders blocking them from getting abortions.		https://t.co/6re8PuhARK
And that’s what Probate Judge Frank Barger allowed would-be father, Ryan Magers, to become. Magers is now the legal representative of the aborted embryo—which he and his lawyers are calling “Baby Roe,” which is preposterous since an embryo is not a baby. 		https://t.co/6re8PuhARK

A man in Alabama was none too pleased when his girlfriend, who was six weeks pregnant, decided to get an abortion against his wishes. In his apparent vision of a perfect world, he would have been able to force her to carry the pregnancy to term.		https://t.co/6re8PuhARK

Independent media outlets like @Rewire_News need your support to keep the facts about abortion rights and reproductive health in the news.  		Can you contribute today? 		https://t.co/W9bzHvDxFb
We report comprehensively to counter anti-choice misinformation wherever it pops up. When independent journalism is under threat, so are the facts on which a free society depends.
At @Rewire_News, that is our number one priority.  We deliver exceptional reporting on reproductive health care. We investigate how abortion care and reproductive health intersect with daily life.
But for more people to understand these connections, we must support the media outlets willing to provide the real facts—all of them.
The truth is that access to #abortion care isn’t just a reproductive health issue. It’s also an economic issue, an equality issue, a human rights issue, and sometimes a life or death issue.
It’s getting harder and harder for people to separate fact from fiction. Outlets like FOX News and New York Post have very specific, conservative, anti-choice perspectives that pervade their work. And they have large audiences who take their “reporting” about abortion as fact.
On Friday, Georgia state house Republicans introduced a bill which would ban abortion statewide if #RoeVWade is overturned. 		The measure would make it a felony—punishable by up to ten years in prison—to perform or attempt to perform an abortion. 		https://t.co/SuVrY9vYAJ
We need to talk about the media coverage of abortion care. As anti-choice activists and legislators step up their assault on reproductive health, they’re using their own media to distort facts and confuse the issue.

Still, these are important efforts to spotlight Black people who have led the way in inching our society closer to achieving social justice while in the face of community disinvestment, institutional bias, and white supremacist violence and vitriol.
Progressive publications in recent years have used February as an opportunity to highlight #Black people, past and present, at the margins and at the intersections of multiple identities. Our lives, of course, are significantly more complex and full than one piece could convey.

Martin Luther King Jr. famously said, “Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.” We couldn’t agree with these words more and we are pulling no punches to amplify the voices in the fight for social justice.
While others create narratives to fulfill their own agendas, we fiercely and unapologetically deliver the facts on the important issues that others ignore. We believe truth is power and reporting the truth is our goal.
Our goal is to break that cycle. We have one overarching purpose: to produce journalism in the public interest and in the service of democracy and justice.
There are others that engage in “both sides” journalism, by amplifying false claims and conspiracy theories.
We won’t sugarcoat it. There are a lot of news sources out there who don’t have your best interests in mind. There are those who manipulate and bend the truth, leaving you to tirelessly sift through an endless sea of questionable information, causing more confusion than clarity.
We report on the things that matter. We inherently believe in everyone's right to the facts. For years, we have been proud to deliver dependable, fact-based reporting giving you the power to engage the issues that matter most.

@ANSIRH 4. A fetus cannot feel pain 20 weeks after fertilization. Leading medical groups, such as ACOG and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, agree that a fetus cannot begin to feel pain until after viability, around 24 weeks’ gestation.		https://t.co/2NecfpoJcS
3. Abortion does not cause mental or physical health problems. This is confirmed by evidence— @ANSIRH researchers confirmed that “a wanted abortion was not associated with mental health harms.” 		https://t.co/2NecfpoJcS
2. Dilation and evacuation abortions are safe—and the language to describe them was invented by anti-choicers. These are the most common 2nd-trimester abortions, and are supported by groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.		https://t.co/2NecfpoJcS
1. Abortion is actually extremely safe: Of the 652,639 abortions reported to the #CDC for 2014, the last year for which data is currently available, only six women were reported to have died from medical complications related to abortion.		https://t.co/2Necfp78lk

This year’s March for Life includes Dr. Kathi Aultman who supports heartbeat bans as they use a “very concrete sign of life.” 		But as @mlaurahuss has explained, “this is far before the point of fetal viability and before a heart has fully formed.”		https://t.co/COrl90a0vg
After a years-long grassroots campaign documenting ICE’s human rights violations in the jail, Atlanta finally ended the contract in September, realizing that it could not call itself a “welcoming city” while profiting from immigrants’ pain.		https://t.co/eJ315KhHtG
In August 2018 the county filed its writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, arguing the Court should take the case because the Ninth Circuit’s decision creates a split among the federal courts, as to whether prior salary is a “factor other than sex."		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch “Women are told they are not worth as much as men,” the decision states. “Allowing prior salary to justify a wage differential perpetuates this message, entrenching in salary systems an obvious means of discrimination.”		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch The federal district court sided with Rizo, stating the use of prior salaries violated the equal pay for equal work mandate. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s decision. Then, the en banc panel of the Court reversed THAT one.		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch The county argued the formula used to set salaries was applied consistently among employees regardless of gender. Thus, it said, it was not a “sex-based” wage determination in violation of the EPA.		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch In 2012, Rizo learned men in the district were making as much as $10,000 more in comparable positions. When Rizo brought this to human resources, they told her the pay discrepancy was justified because it was based on Rizo’s prior salary history. 		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch The county “calculated new employees’ wages by taking their most recent salaries, adding five percent, and then placing them on the nearest step in a ten-step salary scheme.” Prior salary history was the only factor used to set starting salaries.		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch In 2009, Aileen Rizo was offered a position as a math consultant with the Fresno County Office of Education. Rizo’s starting salary was $62,133, based on a set salary formula the district applied to all new hires, regardless of gender.		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
@IWPResearch At issue before the Court is the problem of employers using prior salary history when setting wages, which plaintiffs argue perpetuates the gendered wage gap.		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2
According to @IWPResearch, when averaged out over 15 years women make 49 cents for every dollar men make—with women of color, especially Black women, paid the least of all. 		On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court could make that worse.		https://t.co/UsNCwuFaH2

@Hegemommy @PPact When the government publishes a proposed regulation, the public gets 60 days to comment. The press conference is taking place on the final day to submit a comment and for people to make their voices heard.
@Hegemommy @PPact The public charge rule would punish anyone the government deems likely to use public benefits — effectively discriminating against people with low incomes and creating a system that favors immigrants who are wealthy.
@Hegemommy @PPact This rule means a person could be penalized for using #Medicaid to get a checkup or fill a prescription; food assistance programs like SNAP to feed their children; or public housing benefits to provide their family a safe place to live.
Watch here at 12 E.T., where @Hegemommy will live-tweet @ppact's press conference on the Trump admin’s proposed changes to the public charge rule —a proposed regulation that could deny immigrants U.S. entry because they have received any of a broad range of public benefits.

Students would be forced to wait until the behavior causes their education to suffer, like dropping grades or missing classes, before they could even file a complaint.		https://t.co/NSW8pG2GyV
Instead, the rules would require schools to ignore all sexual harassment unless the student has already been denied equal access to education—even if the student has to sit next to their harasser or rapist in class every day. 		https://t.co/NSW8pG2GyV
It gets even worse. Under these rules, students would have to endure a level of sexual harassment that is already considered illegal for adults in the workplace.		https://t.co/NSW8pG2GyV
