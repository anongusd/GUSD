@AwaniGeorge @AvengedKenny @emm_ell_dee @BBCWorld The entire EU is corrupt just like the entire Democratic party is in the USA. Even Pope Francis is in on it. Obama ousted Benedict and put Francis in to promote globalism. NWO	Here is a Google search about this.https://t.co/pFB1MQfrC9
@BBCWorld Wow, so many triggered bullys. Melania is both beautiful and soft spoken. She had every right to defend herself against the hateful comments on social media. All the ignorant comments prove her right!!!
@Thathadagai @BBCWorld Speak for yourself. I think she's beautiful and kind.
@ColumbusNarine @BBCWorld They bully her and pretend they aren't complicit in the action.
@AwaniGeorge @AvengedKenny @emm_ell_dee @BBCWorld It sure is. Like sheep to the slaughter but they don't know that. They are programmed by Merkel to believe the Propaganda. Thanks Soros.👎
@randomguy495 @JorgeWarsh @BBCWorld Calling and labeling people as Nazis that oppose rape, and murder is skewed. But you know that. Twisting and deflecting is the MO of the radical left.
@MjCrumbley @YNB Because you can't deal with the truth. The truth is hate to those that hate the truth. 🖐.

@randomguy495 @JorgeWarsh @BBCWorld Nope. They're inadvertently supporting Sharia Law.
@AvengedKenny @emm_ell_dee @AwaniGeorge @BBCWorld No. You're  duped by Germanys chancellor Merkel. She calls the right Nazis to silence her critics opposed to mass migration. The MSM media and Soros are behind this Period!!!
@emm_ell_dee @AwaniGeorge @BBCWorld Well.since the German government is covering up for the rapes and failure to assimilate migrants. I doubt any credible website will show anything.

@WiiMonsieur @UniteAmerica1st @joesephharry @VibeHi Not True. Identity politics is all DEM's know. The only reason they don't like Trump is he isn't a label to them. He's not a minority ie Female, black, etc.... The only reason Hilary was supported is they wanted the first female president just like Obama couldn't be critized..
