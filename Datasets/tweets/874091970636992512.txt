@seanhannity @businessinsider Reynolds said that the evaluations of each referee on Gorka's PhD committee was "a page of generalized comments ‚Äì completely at odds with the detailed substantive and methodological evaluations that I've seen at every Ph.D defence I've been on over the last twenty years."
