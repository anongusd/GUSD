@PolishPatriotTM @DewsNewz I love how the first response the left goes to is calling their opposition racist.  With absolutley zero evidence.  People fall for this shit.
@BuzzFeedNews @Vivgrace2017 And the left is concerned about Russia doing the exact same thing @BuzzFeed does daily

@clemons_kerri @rail581 @AOC Amen!  I worked 2 jobs in my twenties to support my family.  I did what I had to to provide.  Eventually it paid off but I never took handouts.  My kids learned that hard work does pay off, thats the single most important lesson you can teach your kids.

@JacobAWohl Maybe they should walk 5-6 times a week to get their asses in shape
@BernieSanders What I‚Äôve learned from real experience is that in many cases a union kills a business.  I‚Äôve seen folks go on strike and the small business had no option but to close the doors. All lose their jobs and the site still sit there empty.

@wormbolt @educatingsheep @SenSchumer @SecNielsen - Lawless Democrats have caused longest shutdown in history. 	- Trump has NO collusion with Russia. 	- Trump has accomplished more than any other president in history. 	- Big Beautiful wall is going up, fully funded by new trade deals with Mexico. 	- Swamp is being drained.

@mcdaniel0207 @nytimes I like to think I read a lot of stories out there but I only recall the initial  story and then the stories of her escape.  You can‚Äôt deny that a girl that was found 3 mths after being kipnapped and her parents murdered is an extraordinary story.  Everything isn‚Äôt about race.

@GranathJane @suzy1493 @HillaryClinton @SpeakerPelosi @seanhannity Not what Obama, Clinton, Feinstein, Schumer and Pelosi said.  Is this where you tell us that drones and video will work?  So the border agents can watch Illegals cross the border in 4K?
@Acosta https://t.co/Yx4RhpN4HR
@SenFeinstein PS  They are Illegal Immigrants, not undocumented.  They didn‚Äôt misplace some papers.

@GranathJane @suzy1493 @HillaryClinton @SpeakerPelosi @seanhannity And your number is wrong.  The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, reviewed this cash transfer in a 2018 report. It gave a total of $1.7 billion.
@GranathJane @suzy1493 @HillaryClinton @SpeakerPelosi @seanhannity Yeah, it‚Äôs cool to send cash to a Terrorist Country.  Give me a break.  Take a look at who voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, it includes Schumer, Obama and Hillary. The Dems have made this Poitical
@HillaryClinton @senatemajldr What changed Hillary? You along with @SenSchumer and @BarackObama voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, a bill that provided $1.4 billion for 700 miles of fencing along the southern border.

@JoshuaStarbuck @robbystarbuck It matters because they spread hate based on fake racial motives.  It divides us as a nation and the MSM loves it.  I hate a guy that killed a 7 year old girl, I don‚Äôt give a crap if we was White, Black or Mexican.  He is Evil!
@Blaqeyedsparrow @robbystarbuck The point is that everything is not about race.  Sometimes people are just evil and have no respect for life of any color.  If we address the true issues and stop using the race card to rile up folks, we will all be much better off.  A Child was murdered, a Family is devastated.

@Acosta And an ‚ÄúActing‚Äù Reporter
@thecjpearson Merry Chistmas CJ.  Good Call!
@SenFeinstein Mattis was in his position longer than 3 of Obama‚Äôs Defense Secs, were you concerned then as well?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP Like Nancy knows what it‚Äôs like to live paycheck to paycheck?  Ever see her house and the big beautiful wall built around it?
@NancyPelosi @realDonaldTrump @HouseGOP You did the exact same thing over DACA.  So twice you have opted to side with illegals over American Citizens, so shut the hell up!
@IngrahamAngle How about the Chirch just stop hiding them?
@KamalaHarris Let me be clear, you are for illegals over American Citizens.
@KarenKaren572 @NancyPelosi Don‚Äôt fret son, the men and women in the US Military will protect you.
@NancyPelosi Were you so concerned about Mattis when Obama fired him?
@ourqueenrachel @JohnKasich @jwgop Bless You!
@barreled53 @JohnKasich On what grounds?
@ourqueenrachel @JohnKasich @jwgop You do realize he is the Governor of Ohio right?
@ashalit @willin_mac @JohnKasich @jwgop On what grounds?
@Alyssa_Milano Looks like this tweet backfired on you Alyssa!
@KamalaHarris Let‚Äôs be clear, you are more concerned for the illegals crossing the border, bringing drugs into the Country, and trafficking sex slaves than the Government workers and the US Citizens.  Thanks for the clarification.
@SenSchumer @realDonaldTrump So you‚Äôre good with the wall if Mexico pays for it?
@SenKamalaHarris If Trump shuts it down?  I believe it‚Äôs on all of you.  The voters put him in office on a promise to build the wall.  Do what you are paid to do for the people.

@TheNoahRing @jkslaven That works
@Ms_Liz2 @TylerBennett248 @Toure I‚Äôm as white as they come.  I couldn‚Äôt care less about the color of my President‚Äôs skin.  It‚Äôs about where they stand and what they get done.  In your eyes we hated Obama because he was black and we voted For Trump because he is white.  That couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth
@KevyBones @lgd118 @DarrellPrichard @KamalaHarris I agree, thats ridiculous.  I don‚Äôt agree with the bail outs.  Maybe we should be asking why a University charges $80k/year rather than asking the taxpayers to take the hit.
@msEMcB @lgd118 @DarrellPrichard @KamalaHarris The top 1% already account for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined
@UtaJohansdottir @kaylafromwa @KamalaHarris God Bless You!
@kaylafromwa @UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris Honey, I‚Äôm enjoying life.  Be well and prosper.
@kaylafromwa @UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris I‚Äôll move on when I damn well please. (or until you block me, which you will soon) I don‚Äôt want to give the government another dime of my money to pay for shitty healthcare.  We disagree.
@UtaJohansdottir @kaylafromwa @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs called common sense.  Did your parents teach you that nothing is free?
@mitchellvii @gatewaypundit Seems high
@kaylafromwa @UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris Can you multiply?  That is every year of your working life.  People think it takes a long time to payoff student loans, try giving the government 17% of your salary till the day you retire.
@kaylafromwa @UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris Simple search. You do understand the money has to come from somewhere and that is taxes. https://t.co/qmzWb9fFw1
@UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris We are talking about free education.  Nothing is free my friend, it‚Äôs all taxes paid over your lifetime.
@kaylafromwa @UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris You do realize what that adds up to year after year right?  You are easily paying more over the life of your career.
@lgd118 @DarrellPrichard @KamalaHarris It doesnt work that way.  The taxpayers would pay.  Nothing is free.  You want free college like they have in other countries, you will give up close to half your salary in taxes.
@adam77271 @DawnofaNewOrder @jcpintler @KamalaHarris Nothing is free if all the other taxpayers have to pay the bills.
@jcpintler @KamalaHarris It‚Äôs votes she is after.  If she gets all the 20 something votes because she offers free everything she wins and keeps power
@UtaJohansdottir @KamalaHarris And the income tax rate in the UK is about 40% compared to about 23% in the US
@KamalaHarris Why don‚Äôt you go after the Universities that charge ridiculous tuition rather than increase our taxes yet again.
@Kidfos @sarahjeong Maybe research crime rates in the UK first before you point fingers. Criminals love gun laws.
@Kidfos @sarahjeong UK Law: It is an offence to beat or shake any carpet, rug, or mat (except door mats before 8am) in a thoroughfare in the Metropolitan Police District.  Every Country has ridiculous laws my friend.

@Kidfos @sarahjeong Oh, there‚Äôs a new one, Sarah Jeong, the comedy writer.  btw, I‚Äôm pretty sure nobody in the EU is laughing at us.
@twenty_yards @sarahjeong @nytimes True, that‚Äôs the beauty of the 1st Amendment, that doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt racist.  Racism: prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

@HillaryClinton The NYT reported in 2015 that "shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.
@SenKamalaHarris Do they teach you all ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be clear‚Äù in a Democrat training class?
@seanhannity Reminder:  Alex Baldwin pretends to be someone else for a living.
@TMZ Who?
@Patrici15767099 That‚Äôs not what the guy in the bathroom stall said
@KamalaHarris Just curious, are there any Men in your district?  Just seems all you fight for are Women.  I thought you were supposed to fight for all your constituents.
@dcexaminer Those who can, do.  Those who can‚Äôt, teach.

@elizabethforma @MorganStateU Let me get this straight, you say there is one rule for whites, like white privilege, then you go on talking about how your family struggled.  So did white privilege  skip your family like most of us?

@SenSchumer You shut down the government over DACA so shut the Chuck up
@NYorNothing Never give up
@ChuckCallesto Fact: People have died at the hands of illegal immigrants
@Littlest_Wolf @noahsage @sswilli9912 @HillaryClinton Yeah, I‚Äôm sure criminals are driving to Indiana to purchase guns legally.  Criminals love gun laws, it ensures they are the ones with the weapons.

@SenKamalaHarris Hope they told you to take a hike and take your illegals with you
@Alyssa_Milano Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with the trip across Mexico on foot.
@mind_is_moving @ongle @BirminghamKav @HillaryClinton I think I have a pretty good grasp on it thanks.  You can take your socialist healthcare and keep it.  The government doesnt run anything smoothly and I don‚Äôt want them touching my healthcare.
@mind_is_moving @BirminghamKav @HillaryClinton Actually I am.  My Employer pays half of my premiums so monthly my out of pocket is not bad at all.  If someone in the UK does not use their healthcare their income is still taxed at 40%.  That is Huge!
@mind_is_moving @BirminghamKav @HillaryClinton I'd rather keep my income and have the choice of Healthcare Providers, thank you very much
@dcexaminer Will you confirm him? @Ocasio2018
@DanCovfefe1 @carrieksada Looks like more snowflake Antifa members carrying on when they don't get their way.  They will fit right in with the Dem Party.
@BirminghamKav @HillaryClinton Income in the UK is taxed around 40% vs 24% in the US.  You do the math.
@CandyReimholz @HillaryClinton There ya go, vote for someone because of their genitals, makes sense.
@BirminghamKav @HillaryClinton Nothing is ‚ÄúFree‚Äù Dear

@otisrath @SenSanders Steve Scalise was shot at a softball game by a Bernie supporter (not blaming Bernie at all)  Antifa is attacking people daily.  Antifa gets their marching orders from the Dem "Leaders".  U cannot ignore the comments from your "Leaders" like Maxine, Holder, Pelosi, and Hillary.
@ZoeBrick2 @SenSanders Hillary said no power no peace!		Maxine said get up in their faces wherever they are!		Holder said when they go low we KICK EM while they‚Äôre down! 		Pelosi said violence against patriots is COLLATERAL DAMAGE!
@otisrath @SenSanders Tell these folks: Hillary said no power no peace!		Maxine said get up in their faces wherever they are!		Holder said when they go low we KICK EM while they‚Äôre down! 		Pelosi said violence against patriots is COLLATERAL DAMAGE!

@kimsmith4290001 @SenKamalaHarris Yes, I have no problem with a Female SCOTUS at all.  You are proving my point.  You only want men away from your "Reproductive" rights when they do not agree with you.
@kimsmith4290001 @SenKamalaHarris If that's the case then Roe vs. Wade is invalid since 7 (MEN) agreed to uphold the ruling.  Guess MEN only count when they agree with you.
@kimsmith4290001 @SenKamalaHarris It's not a person?  Have you ever seen a fetus?  A fetus cries, feels pain, hears and learns.  The moment the¬†sperm fertilized the¬†egg, a new human person came into existence!
@AutumnL35172601 @Johnathan981968 @SenKamalaHarris Are you saying you only take the recommendations of Female Physicians?
@AutumnL35172601 @SenKamalaHarris Does that argument stand for Men's health issues?  Should the female SCOTUSs recuse themselves from any issues related to Men's healthcare?  I don't get the argument of "No man should ever tell me I can't get my healthcare covered".
@thedoo2u @SenKamalaHarris I think if you asked the majority of Republicans, they would say they do not want abortion abolished, they just don't want their taxes going to fund the killing of babies.  It's that simple.
@kimsmith4290001 @SenKamalaHarris It's not your "reproductive rights", it's a Child.  If you are aborting a female baby, are you not doing the same thing you are fighting against?  You are not only telling that baby what she can do with her reproductive rights, you are telling her she cannot exist.

Unlike the Trump Admin when the left encourages their followers to harrass thrm in public? https://t.co/L6jC1uFSm0
Yeah, we miss you grabbing breasts, that was hilarious. https://t.co/WmesJywJ6H
@eugenegu Facts please....  We are waiting....
@eugenegu @realDonaldTrump You mean all the illegals voting in our elections?
You agree with these racist comments? @eugenegu  I don‚Äôt care what someone says to me on Twitter, I would never say anything close to what she did.  If you are complicit you agree with her thoughts https://t.co/filHROFVu8
@sarahjeong Were the Police trolling you when you went on your Police rant?
So this means all white people are evil?  You are the true racist and there is no hiding now.  Don‚Äôt try to be the victim, it‚Äôs not working. https://t.co/m2phHxU6vL

@obrim_jr You obviously have TDS and there is no point.  You can‚Äôt have a discussion without getting personal, typical inclusive dem that only accepts those with the same views.  They go low, we go high. Enjoy the next 6 years my friend.  #WalkAway
@obrim_jr If I concede he pulled us out of the recession would you conceed Trump accelerated growth?
@obrim_jr Wow you have amazing Gifs.  So talented
@obrim_jr I do give you credit, you have not mentioned Russia or Putin yet.  Thats impressive for a Dem using the same old talking points.  #WalkAway
@obrim_jr Lowest black unemployment in recorded history, theres a start. The Dem Mayor is being asked to resign but you wouldnt see that on CNN.  Look, if the economy was bad right now you would blame the POTUS but since it‚Äôs doing well it‚Äôs because of our last admin.
@obrim_jr They couldnt afford it.  It was easy for the folks that got FREE coverage but it killed the folks that had to pay
I can‚Äôt even take it anymore @RealCandaceO https://t.co/jXLAKSMtDY
