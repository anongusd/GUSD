@rjeff74 @teapartytempest I don't doubt Creation.  I simply believe there is more to the story.  The efficacy of how the Earth was formed, even at the basic level described is consistent with the fossil record.  God is a god of mystery.  We don't have all the details.
@buzz_commander Oh, for fraks sake.
@rjeff74 @teapartytempest We have to remember the context and the time at which the Torah was written.  3500 years ago, Man did not have the knowledge we do now.  That doesn't mean the Adam and Eve didn't exist, or the Garden.  It means the story had the basic elements of Creation, but not the total.
@rjeff74 @teapartytempest You would need more than 3 people to create Humanity.  That's scientific fact.  Does that mean I discount the Creation story?  No.  It simply means it did not flesh out all the details.

@pattonc And it won't be the last time.  The strong Executive has been a problem for decades.  We've allowed this to happen.
@pattonc Do I agree with it?  No.  I think it's an overreach of the Executive to act in this manner.  Democrats will use this in the future, no doubt.  The problem is, they already have, as have Republicans.  Both sides are complicit.  Trump will not be the last to act in this manner.
@pattonc So, let's break this down.		A "National Emergency" is declared via an Executive Order.  Trump can pay for the wall through funds that have already been approved by Congress in 2006.  He can use Eminent Domain to acquire the land that is necessary from private landowners.
There's no such thing as a "hate crime". https://t.co/vZz4Kj1IJ0
@pattonc I haven't.  I've been giving a counterpoint.
@pattonc I'm not justifying anything.  I didn't say I agreed or disagree.		Eminent Domain was declared Constitutional, so it's in play here.  The courts will ultimately have to decide.  The fact of the matter is that the Democrats are getting what they wanted.  More executive power.
@pattonc Eminent Domain is a legal process.  He has the right to do it.
@pattonc Truman used it to send our boys to war in Korea.  Sometimes, we watch while others make decisions.  The President's job is to protect the border.  This is a part of his duty as Commander in Chief.
Yes, and the Sheriff allowed your son to be killed. https://t.co/iNPxiVI85F
Wow.  Two collosal beta male douches in one place. https://t.co/p0EM1Pg45P
@pattonc I was speaking on the fact that Presidents on both sides have declared National Emergencies, and they will continue to do so.  Trump has already declared 3 of them in his tenure.  This is just one that the Democrats oppose, which why the media is worked up into a lather about it.

@teapartytempest There are lines that cannot be crossed.  This is why I'm a Conservative.  Allowing child murder to continue is a strain upon our Republic.
@teapartytempest I am a moderate on most things.
@teapartytempest The reason for legalising abortion was to prevent those abortions.  So, fine.  They can only be performed in a hospital, under medical supervision, and only after appropriate counseling, and only in cases of rape, incest, or medical necessity.  Never as a form of birth control.
@teapartytempest Lastly, if you can't keep your pants on, you will face the consequences of that act.  Killing your child is not acceptable.
@teapartytempest I also believe in "safe, legal, and rare", which was the mantra of the Democrat Party before they started endorsing infanticide.  That means, using abortion as a means of birth control is unethical and evil.  We have Plan B for a reason.
@teapartytempest My compromise came when I spoke to a pro-choice supporter at length.  I was pro life, until I looked at the facts and science behind this.  A pregnancy can be unviable and go into miscarriage up to 8 weeks with the child feeling no pain.  As soon as it can, that's the Rubicon.
@teapartytempest At 8 weeks, a child can feel pain.  There is no compromise, in my estimation.

@teapartytempest @AskWillyD I hate to say this, but it is "her truth".		And some of it is correct: Many women think of men this way, even if it's unjustified.
Horrible behaviour from a man. https://t.co/sRJe1wHMHg
@AskWillyD Correct!  I've made faux pas many times, even when my intentions were honourable. The important thing is to apologise, and be a man about it, and stop blaming women when we don't see it. That goes for women too. Don't lead men on, and pretend you haven't. It's a two way street.
@AskWillyD On the other side of the equation, just because a woman smiles or talks to you, doesn't mean she wants to sleep with you.  So many men don't get this either.  Body language is important.
@AskWillyD The thought of assaulting a woman for any reason is distressing and disturbing.  Obviously, intentions can be misread, as well as misconstrued.  Trust has to be established.  This is why women must be CLEAR in their intentions as well.  So few are.
A thought-provoking thread.		Not to take away from the truth here, but to think of every man as a threat is no way to live.

@realamymholmes Oh...and I forgot to address to first part of the discussion (got carried away there).  		Yes.  He should resign.  Unequivocally.  There's no legitimate excuse for that behaviour then, nor for his sidestepping of it now.		This is the modern Democrat Party.  It's horrible.
@realamymholmes That is why I think we need to have a discussion about this issue as a nation.		NARAL and Planned Parenthood are nothing more than organisations promotint modern day Eugenics.  The majority of their victims are Black children.  It's horrific.
@realamymholmes My point is that a nation that allows this to occur is already in decline.  Morally.  We were a Republic based upon the ideas of truth and virtue.  Science tells us that after 8 weeks, the child in the womb can survive with support.
@realamymholmes Until we deal with the lack of morality of those who would sacrifice innocent children, we cannot hope to turn a nation around that is in decline.  This cannot be allowed to continue.		You and I are both pro-choice, but murder for convenience cannot continue.
@realamymholmes So, the greater point in all of this: Society that worships death, will find a way to promote it.  Infanticide was practised by Baal and Molech worshippers in the Old Testament.  Innocent children in exchange for "prosperity".  It's a sickness, Amy.  It pervades society now.
