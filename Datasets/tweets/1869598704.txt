A wild three days of covering the #PopeInDC has come to an end. Heck of a time grinding with @KellieMeyerNews and @GrayDCnews.
"God bless America" is the way @Pontifex ends an extremely well written, well said speech. #PopeInDC
"A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty....when it fosters a culture which enables people to dream of full rights..."
"I can only reiterate the importance and richness and the beauty of family life." #PopeInDC
"A good political leader always opts to initiate processes rather than possessing space." #PopeInDC
"I call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps...to avert serious effects of environmental deterioration." #PopeInDC
"This common good also includes the earth." #PopeInDC
Pay us a visit if you've got time - Safe flight!  https://t.co/ROcmp3rlcq

"The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick that time will use for us." #PopeInDC
"We must not be taken aback by the numbers, but rather view them as persons." #PopeInDC
Typo! **appeals**
"When the stranger in our midst appears to us we must not repeat the sins and errors of the past" #PopeInDC
"Most of us were once foreigners" #PopeInDC
"I am happy that America continues to be, for many, a land of dreams." - @Pontifex #PopeInDC
"There is another temptation which we must guard against...selective reductionism that sees only good or evil." - @Pontifex #PopeinDC
"...Abraham Lincoln, the Guardian of Liberty." - @Pontifex
