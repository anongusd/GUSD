@rustyrockets What is gossip - to friends trying to help another out with out malice. A group of friends trying to work together to help a friend in need.	Talking about other misfortune or not really trying to help others. Gossip falls,when others help and listen. Do you agree? @rustyrockets

@piersmorgan Why argue about Mental Health and do something to help. If we all help then we will have a NHS or if your American Obama care.
@piersmorgan I think you truly know what you are doing but you try and do good for real people. That proper journalism. The people always speak hence #NHS  #Brexit ect ect.
Poor Andy Murray its a shame such a great player. https://t.co/PmEn4UmZU2
@piersmorgan Piers, people with Metal Health problems, hide them til they have so many breakdowns they spiral out of control. Mental Health can not measure or catergise.  The only things clinicians can do is work with the serve modrate and mild to stop the over spill of more people being ill.

Giving to charities shops is a great thing to do everytimes you give to a charity shop.	You are not only helping others make money for the charity .You are also giving and buying from your local charity shop benifets your community with the things they may need.

@piersmorgan No one has any right to subject someone's mental health.  hes got a clever mind @west but his mental health gets in his way. I think @peirsmogan maybe you like to start a talk point which in a way is good at #withoutstigma
So important to be aware of mens and womens mental health at teenage to adulthood not just 18. @withoutstigma https://t.co/tfuOyXcz5f
Brilliant recovery course and ebe with going on the course take a look  users of services and  people in general wanting to know more about their condition or they are  carer of a family member ect ect. https://t.co/nLWLI64UmU
Great quotation. https://t.co/PV7t8CZCoM
Drying time now. https://t.co/G8sumOYHDR
Be present, be you and be kind to others even if they are not kind to you. Life is about kindness.
This is amazing. https://t.co/mAtr7KkK4R
Why do people always rain on your parade, being kind is a brillant thing and more people should be kind, but some people do take advantage. We  just have to except that unkindness is down to their greed and unhappiness in life and its really nothing to do with us.
We are so lucky living by the sea even in this bitter cold weather. Sea air really is good for us all and its a beautiful place too lucky us ❤️

One thing, ive realised why i rest recovering from the stress of nose bleeds. That life is never perfect no matter what happens on the out-side. Remember that by looking forward and trying to be kind to others and happy in yourself is the best think you can possibly do.
