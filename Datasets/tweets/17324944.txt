60% of America says NO to border wall. Experts in the administration say it is a waste of money.  $5 billion won't begin to build,  @gop gave our money away in tax scam adding $1 trillion deficit. Can't afford waste tax payer money on a monument to @realDonaldTrump https://t.co/2cCfZ7p8km
When Mexico writes a check.  Then let them build it on their side of the border. #NoWallNowNoWallEver https://t.co/yNqpYhoyAS
How much of YOUR  @LaraLeaTrump money have you donated to help unpaid workers to date? Show proof. #EndTheShutdownNow https://t.co/Vd5eoUFklS
@LaraLeaTrump  ONLY on #fauxnews  can the subject of a criminal investigation declare themselves innocent and think that is fact. In America it seems, the bigger the crime the lesser the punishment. #ImpeachTrump #MuellerKnowsEverything
ONLY on #FauxNews is this even considered true when the very persons who are under investigation get to declare themselves innocent and that is accepted as fact. #MuellerIsComing https://t.co/G5WdoZ9fNb
As Will Rogers said: “The difference between death and taxes is death doesn't get worse every time Congress meets.”

@kylegriffin1 A sad downturn to our reputation. But always seek a silver lining when you cannot get out from under the cloud. Adoption = Becoming American and staying in US. One of the purposes those poor parents came here in the first place.  They may get what they wanted the wrong way.

@ABCPolitics @abc BAD REPORTING FLUFF.  Interview with Melania on #MeToo  Why she said "...need show evidence.." Follow up FBI not permitted by DT leads for corroboration and accused/accuser never interviewed? Was "evidence" deliberately covered up ? #abc #MelaniaTrump
Why did that reporter not ask her about her hubby not permitting evidence to be uncovered by a rigged FBI probe. "show evidence" assumes it is not being covered up for political gain. Bad incomplete reporting. @ABCPolitics @ABC https://t.co/JwhWEqdAkt

@realDonaldTrump @potus Is becoming more unhinged each day. Now turning POTUS into political toy. Calling survivors liars and worse. Sadly GOP and republican voters have no moral compass any more. #voteblue #BlueWaveComing2018

@JeffFlake @SenatorCollins  This is the new "normal" in our radical GOP led government.  Dr. Ford called a liar &amp; fake by Trump. And he is the one who rigged the FBI probe that could have shown otherwise. https://t.co/UQGoJ1dmRJ   #IBelieveHer #dumptrump #ImpeachKavanaugh
@JeffFlake @SenatorCollins  What you tell women your states when their reproductive rights are lost? What will you tell repub voters when they lose health care...unless you have designed a plan that only applies to registered repubs #flakeflake #SelloutSusan #MedicareForAll https://t.co/HdzjqtkVVz
"False allegations" are a fake term for "I don't want to know". FBI was not permitted to investigate. Was just a sham probe to provide cover for a YES vote.  But so many on the right simply don't care what he may or may not have done. Just as long as you don't know. https://t.co/BOIh0hDme2
Yea....but when it is YOUR daughter or wife is the standard different? Democrats did not make any accusations fool.  It was alleged victims of assault who reported. But wing-nuts always need to blame someone else. #IBelieveChristine https://t.co/aUX1j2Fhzu

If progressives don't flood the polls we ALL lose and it will be our fault for being lazy.
And yet @SenatorCollins @JeffFlake Refuse to acknowledge FBI working in handcuffs in rigged probe to provide fake cover. No word about other lies, temper, partisan remarks. Thousands professionals and former justice say #NoKavanaughSCOTUS #SelloutSusan https://t.co/xsk5EYfrWq

Why important stop Kavanaugh.  Jeff Flake may be flaking on us. Probably scammed Dems with his trick to demand FBI to give cover to vote yes.  He knew would be a cover up, not a real investigation.  Need to UP the pressure on GOP senators to vote NO on... https://t.co/0Lpw1yGH1M
@jeffflake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski Why the big rush on Kavenaugh? To have an ally on the court to undermine citizen's rights. The more conservative a nation the fewer freedoms we have. It's a fact that GOP wants to restrict freedom. https://t.co/0Lpw1yGH1M #NOkavaNO
@JeffFlake @SenatorCollins @lisamurkowski  So is this FBI "scam investigation" the GOP rug you are planning to sweep Kavenaugh's yes vote under despite overwhelming public opposition? If so we know who to toss out of office next election. #NoKavanaugh #IBelieveSurvivors

@lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins Kavenaugh says a week delay too painful for him.  BS...this could have been investigated already except for GOP delaying in the first place. Why Kavenaugh refuse reply if he would welcome FBI? Why refuse hear corroboration or Mark Judge?
@ChrisCoons Bravo. Since when does age excuse assault? Since when can refusing to hear from potential witnesses justify a claim there are no wittnessed. @OrrinHatch seems to think all this is in favor of confirmation.
The timing of allegations does not offer a defense. When the allegations revealed has nothing to do with their validity.

@NBedera Since the committees questioner is hired, paid because she is considered an EXPERT should she be required to provide her unbiased written assessment of Dr. Ford's testimony
@lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins Who do YOU really answer too? Is that entity stipulated in your oath of office?  I think you oblication is NOT to your party nor to any  individual regardless of their position of power. Certainly not to Trump or McConnell #NoKavanaugh https://t.co/w0SZ3awsJr
Will Mitchell be honest in her questioning and will she as a paid expert offer written opinion re. testimony or will GOP hide that if it is now what they wanted? This is now about the integrity of Rachel Mitchell #NoKavanaugh @gop https://t.co/JT42W8Vr39
Dems ask for Mitchell to give an expert unbiased opinion at close. Sens not experts but she was specifically hired AS AN EXPERT with taxpayer money so cannot claim she has no opinion. @SenFeinstein @KamalaHarris @SenSchumer https://t.co/1Kjr1XRTlM
What she said ! https://t.co/yyleUO76fg
@gop Only guilty demand NO investigation.  This applies to Kavenaugh and Trump
@lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins  you know...if the current GOP and @senatemajldr  are demanding party over national loyalty and integrity you can switch to Democrate today!
@lisamurkowski @JeffFlake @SenatorCollins  There is NO time frame to this. Still time to demand FBI by declaring your NO vote unless this is done. NO HURRY all the time in the world. Take a year! #NoKavanaugh
@SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris Hope DF askes the GOP hired gun her professional opinion of Dr Ford testimony. She is, after all a HIRED EXPERT so GOP cannot claim she has no professional opinion of the events. #NoKavanaughConfirmation

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS "... charges would have been filed."  They can still be filed, no statute of limitations and you cannot interfere with state investigations.  Is this what you want?  Can FBI clear Kavenaugh?

@lisamurkowski @SenatorCollins @marcorubio   Accuser asks for FBI probe re. Kavenaugh. Why has appointee NOT sought  this probe to clear his name? Does this seem suspicious to you? Stop  hearings until an FBI probe done. No rush...went a year with empty seat  recently.
@ChuckGrassley Lying to American about FBI role in Kavenaugh does no justice to yours or senate's credibility. No rush. Hold off hearing until WH orders investigation. What does Kavenaugh have to hide from FBI?
What does this have to do with anything. Was there some Stormy Daniels connection in all of this? If not totally irrelevant as anyone can file a bar complaint and most attorneys have complaints lodged at times in their career https://t.co/muIPYzaArC
