I promise I will get back to snarky political commentary soon, but this morning at @FoundryUMC was amazing. https://t.co/GlLU6qJVY2
This weekend @FoundryUMC wants it to be clear that this Methodist church welcomes everyone through its doors. Join us tomorrow at 9 or 11:15. https://t.co/yAeQ67vuIk
My sentiments exactly. We are not leaving the United Methodist Church. We will remain in the fight for justice. If you live in DC, join us at @FoundryUMC this Sunday. I will be at our 11:15 service. https://t.co/1i3xwqhpvW
Finally back in DC &amp; processing all that happened in the last few days at #gcumc2019. In the meantime, @FoundryUMC continues to open its doors to everyone as we fight for justice and inclusion.    https://t.co/XyYI1KwkNA

I’m getting so many messages of support about the United Methodist Church #GC2019. Let me be clear. So many people here have stood for the sacred worth of every person, including the LGBT community. We will not go away. We will fight for justice &amp; inclusion. We will not leave. https://t.co/uAA9xQ3XI5
Today was a challenging emotionally-draining day at #GC2019 witnessing the harm being done to my LGBT siblings. I am beyond grateful for the witness of @FoundryUMC who stand in the power of the gospel for ALL of God’s children. https://t.co/CWTdcHULd5
The work of the United Methodist Church General Conference begins this morning. @FoundryUMC has shown up! https://t.co/ftmjbIuj2f
@ConnieSchultz @SherrodBrown @BCDreyer Ed would absolutely love this book.
I hope we can maintain the unity of the church, respect each other’s differences, remove discriminatory language &amp; make space for those who worship or believe differently than I do. Maybe it’s asking too much but I remain optimistic that all things are possible. 3/3
I’m grateful to worship at a church &amp; with a community that welcomes  people regardless of where they come from or whom they love — that holds as its mission to love God, love each other, and change the world by following the example of Christ. 2/
Over the next few days, I will be tweeting less about politics (&amp; the Gators) as I head to St. Louis for the 2019 General Conference of the United Methodist Church as we seek a path forward on LGBT ordination &amp; marriage and the unity of the church. 1/

I want Democrats who can take on Trump AND lay out a forward-looking, innovative, hopeful, inclusive agenda that understand we all win when we all win, that put the working and middle class at the center of their campaign, that speak directly above poverty.
I want all of our candidates to build strong, people-powered campaigns; challenge orthodoxy; answer thousands of town hall questions; run agresssive digital efforts; and engage in thoughtful debate.
I seem to be in the minority, but I welcome a big, raucous, gregarious, even unruly Democratic Primary. It will breed excitement &amp; energy; produce new ideas; &amp; a strong candidate will emerge.

I can’t help but be hopeful looking at the diversity on the House floor. Having a Congress that looks like America isn’t just important for diversity sake, it will also lead to better policy and a more responsive government. Now we need the Senate to catch up.
He is using the presidency to enrich himself, but that Democrat talks too much about love &amp; kindness. 		The President is a grave threat to our country, but where does that Democrat rank in the latest list of candidates?		Too much is at stake so let’s focus on what’s important.
Children are dying while being imprisoned by the US, but her voice is shrill. 		We are putting Americans at risk by releasing harmful chemicals into our water supply, but she opened a beer on Instagram! 		He regularly lies to our faces &amp; insults our military but is she authentic?
Warren, Harris, Gillibrand &amp; Klobuchar are all likable but I really don’t give two cents. Our country’s being led by a deceitful, immoral, egomaniacal bigot who’s separating families, polluting our water &amp; slowly destroying our economy. Please stop with these ridiculous stories.
The Trump administration is systematically poisoning America’s air, rivers, lakes, drinking water &amp; more. It will kill Americans of every political party including thousands in Trump counties. Good to see some fighting back.  https://t.co/OYDhgxWhyy

The Priorities USA Foundation has funded 9 lawsuits to fight voter suppression but its costly &amp; insufficient. We must win state legislative seats &amp; Governor’s races. Come January, every Democrat must make this a top priority or face consequences.
These efforts are not limited to the South. Republican Party voter suppression efforts are happening from coast to coast. They target Black, Latinx, and Native American voters in every state where the GOP controls state government. The only way to end this is win in November.
In almost every instance, the Republican Party’s voter suppression effort targets people of color. It is racist &amp; a rebuke to Justice Roberts ridiculous comments about the end of racism as he gutted the Voting Rights Act.

If we are going to win in as many places &amp; among as many people as possible in 2018, change must happen now.
Let’s also be clear. We need more Silicon Valley donors investing in organizations that are doing smart, effective, creative digital. It’s not enough to invest in issue campaigns and non-profits because you don’t want to “get your hands dirty” in politics. Too much is at stake.
There are bright spots including digital campaigns by @MajorityPAC @HouseMajPAC @ColorOfChange @votolatino &amp; more. Campaigns like @BetoORourke &amp; @JBPritzker have been doing incredibly creative &amp; strategic work. @CoryBooker &amp; @SenGillibrand are also doing great work.
Too many Democratic &amp; progressive campaigns &amp; organizations simply refuse to change the way they communicate. Too many Democratic “analysts” run outdated tests &amp; models on the efficacy of digital campaigns — paid or otherwise.
Volunteers are incredibly important but we must also build a larger pool of experienced digital staff which is why we launched a paid fellowship program to increase the size &amp; diversity of Democratic digital staff.
.@prioritiesUSA has built the largest digital training program on the left. Our team has trained over 500 people including campaign managers, executive &amp; political directors, field staff &amp; more. We led a three day bootcamp for over 50 progressive groups &amp; their digital directors.
.@prioritiesUSA has already been up in several Senate, House, and gubernatorial races and helped lead digital efforts in special and mid-term elections in VA, AL, FL &amp; CA.
.@prioritiesUSA has built a team of 70 digital analysts, buyers, and creators of some of the most effective, creative content around. We have committed to spend $50 million on digital advertising, social media, and digital organizing in at least 55 races in 2018. https://t.co/03H58fTEKO

As an openly gay @FoundryUMC delegate to the @bwcumc, I looked at the church that bears my last name and I could only help think that God’s grace is abundant, his call still available to all of us &amp; his work is still unfinished. Thanks be to God.
Yet, as we drove away, I was left with a glimmer of hope. After all, a gay man &amp; his husband, uncles to two beautiful black children, held hands as they freely, openly visited these cemeteries.
I thought about the racial reconciliation work of my own church whose distant past included open discrimination against its own black members for which the church has repented and worked hard to eradicate at all levels of government and church life.
The same family that founded this church also fought to protect the rights to enslave other human beings. I have had to let that sit with me for a while and am still processing it.
It made me wonder what type of person spends time visiting small rural cemeteries to place confederate flags at the graves of these men. I considered picking them up and taking them with me but opted to leave them as a reminder of the shameful act. https://t.co/YEI5rUNnF9
As a human being (and the uncle of an African American niece &amp; nephew), these cemeteries conjured up a sense of shame at the actions of my ancestors who would have likely seen members of their own distant family as property to be auctioned to the highest bidder.
The day brought with it a range of emotions. As a relatively new Methodist, it gave me a sense of connection with my lineage of faith. There was an immediate sense of pride walking up to this beautiful church.
A couple of miles away, we came across another small family cemetery with another 40 or so headstones, some of which were decirated with the confederate flag and CSA markers. https://t.co/4ISt8k1h9q

Florida’s students &amp; young people should have full access to the ballot box without the state putting up unnecessary and illegal roadblocks. There is NO good reason for public universities to be banned from hosting early vote sites.

The complicity of Republicans, conservative evangelicals, Congressional “leaders” &amp; White House staff will be remembered long after they lose power. It’s up to the rest of us to speed that process up.  It starts now.
Mitch McConnell excuses this rhetoric and behavior so he can pack the courts with people who will only make life more difficult for immigrants, the poor &amp; the marginalized — not to mention every middle class American trying to make ends meet.
Paul Ryan has single-handedly and repeatedly stopped reasonable, comprehensive immigration reform. He has enabled Trump at every turn, sacrificing the common good at the altar of tax cuts for the rich.
For conservative “faith leaders” to stand by Donald Trump is shameful. You are not pro-life or pro-family when you separate children from their families. You cannot preach a loving God on Sunday &amp; call his children animals on Wednesday.
What do we expect from a “man” who has spent his career engaged in racist business practices &amp; abominable behavior? It is detestable but not surprising. https://t.co/H3B3s2DlsA

Grandma took a deep breath &amp; made perfectly clear that her little girl was going to use that bathroom with or without his permission. After several seconds, the man, relented &amp; stepped aside as Grandma stood guard. 4/

Harry Reid was right. #collusion
@GuthrieGF Not perfectly and there's real work to do on that front. Just a start.
In other words, there are many important issues at hand, but there are common values and goals we must simply and directly communicate.
Ds want comprehensive, responsible imigration reform that protects our security &amp; welcomes those who are here. Rs scapegoat &amp; stoke fear.
Ds believe our country is enhanced by our gay brothers &amp; sisters. Rs seek to divide us, make us fear one another.
@GuthrieGF Agree, keep reading.
Ds believe the government should stay out of women's health care decisions. Rs believe they know better than the woman, her family &amp; her dr.
Ds believe everyone deserves a fair shot at the ballot box. Rs are passing discriminatory laws that suppress the vote at every turn.
Ds believe criminal justice reform is a moral AND economic issue. Rs just made it harder to pass meaningful reform.
Ds believe you should be able to take care of your family with a 40 hr/week job. Rs oppose even small increases in the minimum wage.
Ds believe Medicare and Social Security are a sacred promise to seniors &amp; future generations. Rs try to slash &amp; privatize at every turn.
Ds want everyone to have access to quality health care w/ protections for pre-existing conditions. Rs will give the wealthy huge tax cuts.
Ds want to invest in working training, community colleges &amp; universities. Rs are slashing ed budgets, putting them out of reach for many.
Dems want an infrastructure plan that creates jobs everywhere. Rs want tax cuts for corporations which leaves big parts of the US behind.
The contrast between D &amp; R has never been clearer. Ds want to build a stronger, better paid workforce. Rs want tax cuts for millionaires.
Americans want more jobs, better pay &amp; a fair shot. Democrats must lay out a clear path forward on all three fronts, but keep it simple.

@randomsubu It is appropriate to judge policy, legal decisions, official positions. For ex., his position on the Muslim ban should be questioned.
In fact, there are elected Dems who hold similar religious views, but are politically liberal. What do they propose we should do to them?
Even though my Christian faith teaches something different than this, I'm not sure this is a path Dems &amp; Sanders ought to go down.
Many faiths, including Christianity, hold views about the exclusivity of their faith -- many of them are Dems. We should tread carefully.
I disagree with the theological writings in question, but am very uncomfortable with this line of questioning from Sanders &amp; Van Hollen. https://t.co/fN6ouElGIK
