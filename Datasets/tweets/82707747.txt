@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano The fact that u just said that about our healthcare system &amp; the fact that u have not told me where u are from lead me 2 believe u r in a foreign country you’re not an American &amp; u have no idea what you’re talking about are conversation is over. God bless you live long &amp; prosper
https://t.co/IMdjf4NLyw	Next time you hear the Democrats and Congressman Donald McEachin opine that it’s time to put the federal employee back to work and how they are suffering, remember this vote, they are liars! Actions speak louder than words.
My fellow constituents of the 4th congressional district in VA. House GOP voted again to pay federal employees. This time just ten Democrats joined them. Congressman Donald McEachin was not one of them, was yours? You can find out by clicking on this link. https://t.co/IMdjf4NLyw
@RTinDenverCO @chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump A lot of MS13 came across the open border or was brought by family members across the open border. Yes Terrorist maybe you forgotten 9/11. We have radical Muslims who would love to cross our open borders &amp; blow us up, do we have to have that happen before someone does something?
@chris_cashton99 @themadmerlyn @Alyssa_Milano @JohnStossel No again stating facts the government and big and bloated and can be proven that it to big and bloated. Which again leads me to believe you’re not from that country you don’t know the constitution or our history
@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano Federal government took it over with the department of education. It belongs at the state and local levels. And no our healthcare is the best in a while that’s why people comes here when they get sick. And again what country are you at I don’t think you’re in the United States
@RTinDenverCO @chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Yes like Israel where everybody is trying to kill them. The fact they can make it work you have a hard time telling me that we America cannot make it work. My first solution would be to ask if they want us to put a wall between their land &amp; Mexico second I see if they would sell

@RTinDenverCO @chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump Just because we build a wall doesn’t mean we walk away and we’re done. Yes we need more boots on the ground, we need technology. We need all three. But most have a wall to protect the border. Those that work border security say we need a Wall.
@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano One where are you from? To our health care is the best in the world. Are education does suck but because again too much big bloated federal government Progressive liberal involvement.
@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano @realDonaldTrump the examples suck becomes they prove you wrong that a wall works. You brought up that the wall would cost too much money I just should you where we can get the money from by cutting foreign aid.
@RTinDenverCO @chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano Maybe it’s not a big issue to you but it’s a big issue to a lot of us especially those that voted for President @realDonaldTrump as for the cost, we spend more on foreign aid that we could cut out that would pay for a wall many times over.

@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano The only thing that makes the situation different if we are America and can do it better.
@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano Those that voted for President @realDonaldTrump want the Wall those that work the border want the Wall &amp; I have given you 2 examples of the wall working in the 21st-century, hungry &amp; Israel. As for the cost we spend more on foreign aid that we could cut out &amp; it would pay for it.
@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano It works in hungry it works in Israel in the 21st-century you go all the back to the great wall of China to point a wall that didn’t work? good going
@chris_cashton99 @themadmerlyn @Alyssa_Milano @JohnStossel I do read it it’s about limiting government powers we have too many regulations. And then the economic professors have it wrong because they call it the free market.
@chris_cashton99 @Alyssa_Milano Fact that yes those working on the border say yes we need a want a wall so you are just wrong there. Again I also stated in another post that yes we need to crack donw on those over staying there visa.  Walls works. That why other countries use them.
