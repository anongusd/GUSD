In College Football there is too much talent to be left out of the playoff. Therefore I would like to see an expansion from 4 teams to 8 teams.

Yes https://t.co/khWLk8yFcj
Cause if you really understand @NavyFB you understand this. Failure is not an option. We fight till the job is done. This year we are hungry determined to win determined to bring back the CIC. But most importantly we are determined to BEAT ARMY.
Safe we represent those that never made it home that made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We are Seals ones that got justice for the victims of 9/11 when we killed Kaleed and Osama Bin Laden. That what we represent when we step onto the field. Its not mercy no holdsbarred
We are the best fighting force the world has ever seen. We are not just random sailors looking for a pick up game. We are Marines. We are Sailors. But most importantly we represent freedom that has been fought through over 200 years of self sacrifice for our country to keep it
We have Perry and Abey back. With Gargulo in the backfield a stout and hungry defense. We failed last year in the second half of the season but we got up and punched Virginia in the mouth which they deserved. We will be ok cause we are hungry and pissed off motivated.
So im watching youtube videos on navy football and watching the preseason predictions with all of them predicting us to go 6-6 losses to AF AND ARMY. Clearly they have no idea what they are talking about. I have us going 13 -1 cause I know this team.The brotherhood is unbreakable
