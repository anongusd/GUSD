@lilibellmia @ReneeCarrollAZ @donnabrazile She's right it's unacceptable and wrong. Nobody said it was illegal.
@BillBuster41 @charliekirk11 Eh, it's still the best way. The value is in the randomness of it. A Twitter poll can have 100x the responses and still be less reliable because it doesn't record the demographics.
@VictorConservat No. I don't think he wants to lynch anybody. I dont think 99.99% of people want to lynch anybody and he's not the exception. Call me racially insensitive but I could give a flying fudge what he wore that night. But I'm white and not from VA so so much for my opinion.
@VictorConservat Lol ur all flash
@VictorConservat You don't write a law for harsher penalties if one is already in place to save infant lives. You do it for... Well... This conversation. To put it in the public sphere. So you can throw it in my face and I'm supposed to be guilted in to voting GOP.
@VictorConservat Oh no I've been on that very closely. Typical GOP TRAP laws. All of your infanticide concerns were handled in the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002. This BS is just about jailing abortion doctors and 2020 messaging.
@VictorConservat Honestly I skim over the anti Semite Democrat stuff. I have no reason myself to hate Jews and none of MY reps have been accused of it, so, if I was to read one thing that would bring me around to the "Dems are anti semites" attitude, what would you recommend?
@NuanceOverDogma @MarkDice Logic would say they would need a dam good reason to do that, and even then, she would have to get her doctors on board.
@NuanceOverDogma @MarkDice Well if your going to wring out those answers, yes, you'll get theoretical tragedy. Putting the power in the hands of the people to make responsible decisions comes with risk. Let me ask, how many women come to term, spend the 1000's keeping the baby healthy, then abort?
@VictorConservat O no I took away the propaganda point. Liberal hipocracy. Got it. But you should look at the other side of the coin that allows this joke to be funny. American conservatives and radical islam have far more in common than American liberals and radical islam.

@NuanceOverDogma @MarkDice I think we're all closer to the same page on this issue than we realize. The Dems last week, they DID NOT vote for infanticide. They voted against another GOP written TRAP law that would have allowed them to jail abortionists in mass
@NuanceOverDogma @MarkDice If your talking about late post ~16 week abortion, than I agree it shouldn't be legal unless it will kill or severely cripple the mother. It's her call to give her life for her baby not mine. And pre 16 weeks they don't have the nerves or brain development to feel pain.

@MancusoKellyA18 @CarmineZozzora Ur right. I don't want to see men with the physical characteristics of men beating out women in accomplishments. I want rules. But there's problems keeping essentially juiced females competing with other females as well.
@MancusoKellyA18 @CarmineZozzora Ok, but hormone treatment. Your DNA tells your body what to do but direct artificial hormones literally reroute that, and men and women have 98% similar DNA. So if you alter their development, which team should they play on?
@luluhall13 @CarmineZozzora So should a girl, who's been given artificial hormones, to help her develop as a boy, should she play for the girls team or the boys team?
@CarmineZozzora Because I imagine some big testosterone fueled transgender Jimmy barrelling down on the other teams female defensive line with their goggles instead of helmets, ready to score. Is that fair? Where do you want them to play?
@CarmineZozzora Are you sure?
@CarmineZozzora Hmm. It makes me wonder about the totals. There's lots of sports being played. There's lots of transgendered people out there. Are they really winning more than average? Or is it just being blown up whenever a gifted sexually ambiguous athlete takes the gold?

@cvpayne @stclairashley This legislation was a republican political maneuver. Had it passed, and if implimented, it could be used to persecute abortion providers, if it failed, which they knew it would, they would used it as 2020 election material. Hope I could help you sleep.
@cvpayne @stclairashley For a start, it comes down to not jailing doctors, which is good in most circumstances. It's not telling doctors to not try and save babies it's just the state doesn't have the right to incarcerate a doctor who let that half dead premature baby die. That's what they voted against
@cvpayne @stclairashley It helps to actually read the legislation and see what else they were voting against.

@CNNPolitics Party lines, surprise surprise.
@Piper_Fogle @hoo_memes I really don't care which politician is opening doors for these assholes. The real answer is probably "many, on both sides, and without their knowledge of the whole situation". U've got to go after the drug lords, they're the ones with the knowledge to shut the machine down.
@hoo_memes @Piper_Fogle Disagree, the laws will change. The Patriot act is still very much in play. Their may be bureaucratic roadblocks put in place or lifted. Their may be more or less funding. If you ask law enforcement, they'll tell you what they have to to get the job done better, so let's do that.
@hoo_memes @Piper_Fogle Not shaken down but intimidated
@hoo_memes @Piper_Fogle If drug dealing was a religion, ud be right on point. The problem is you can apply that logic to any crime boss who's ever shaken down a police man or local politican. We'd probably have to classify more than one local union as terrorist organizations. Maybe they should be.
@Piper_Fogle @hoo_memes I suppose if a drug lord wants to create the kind of political change that would weaken the justice system and customs and diplomacy to the US and uses violence to make that happen... That mofo and his group are terrorists. But they're still businessmen not ideologues.
@hoo_memes @Piper_Fogle But I would still say nay because as awful as their crimes are, they do it all in pursuit of $$$ not political change.
@hoo_memes @Piper_Fogle I believe part of the definition of terrorist is violence for political reasons...yup. if it was only to instill terror than every wife beater would be a terrorist. They do kill pols and journos tho... There's a debate to be had there. https://t.co/efUMJMbTqJ
@IngrahamAngle Lol John Solomon.
@Piper_Fogle @hoo_memes Ya maybe not tho. Ya they're bad, but terrorists use certain tactics that drug dealers don't use and vice versa. So let's not broaden the term "terrorist" just for the resources and sounding tough on drugs.

@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow We're a bit stuck. Remember 2016? We're stuck then. When trump declared he would build a 35-50 ft concrete wall from sea to shining sea. He's given ground on that since then, but the prospect of "the wall" in debate is still all we think of.
@KamVTV @PoliticalKathy @PrisonPlanet You had to be on that day. It was swift and fleeting
RT @joe_manniello: @kylegriffin1 https://t.co/NRrg5uyqim
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow Omg thank you. That's exactly how I feel. I know this isn't everyones top concern but have you considered the ecological impact of a wall, along a waterway, for 100's of miles uninterrupted, in the desert? I want gaps
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow Freeeeeeedooooooom.
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow Liberals don't care about abortion. We're liberals. It's your baby it's your call.
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow Im not Nancy, I don't have a moral objection to a wall, I think in populated areas it's essential. But sensing how determined the migrants are, I think a) they'll climb it and b) ittl cut into our budget for men and tech, and men and tech are better.
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow Ive heard. And let's not even talk about the women.
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow Can't kill him, locking him up is unreasonable and expensive. And I don't think a wall will stop him if he's determined and has at least $200 for a ride and a ladder. So what do you do?
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow That would be nice wouldn't it. A Congress that could pass immigration reform in a firm reasonable way.
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow The choice is easy, break his campaign promise. Don't build "the wall" that Mexico was supposed to pay for. I trust them when they say the concrete behemoth isn't the best use of our money. Squeeze the Dems for B.S. $$$ for what we know they will pay for. Helicopters n shit.
@Txtootie @richthompson72 @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov Thank u
@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow If he wants to do it that way, fine. I don't agree but I'll admit it's within his power, the Dems will sue, which will stall it, and pin their hopes on 2020. But if he wins then it's game over.

@CoincidencesQon @WayneDupreeShow That's gonna be a hard sell. Proving in court that the wall will aid in the war on terror. But if he does, it's his military he can do what he wants. The problem there may come in maintaining the wall, but that's someone else's problem down the road.

@quintroni @LeeSmithDC @MZHemingway We won't solve this tonight I'm just trying to say it's crazy to say that someone who believes in the collusion theory is crazy or brainwashed.
@quintroni @LeeSmithDC @MZHemingway Also let's break down Roger stones 2016 comments hinting about the WikiLeaks dump. And Cohen's comments. And the findings from Congress that found Russia tried to interfere in favor of Trump.
@quintroni @LeeSmithDC @MZHemingway You can't prove that anymore than I can prove trump colluded. So why did comey come out and say HRC was under investigation a month before the election if it was all a big plot then? Heck how did trump win with the doj, Dems, deep state, and Russia working against him?
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov We need more men at ports of entry, we need more immigration judges, we need updated immigration laws, we need x ray machines to scan trucks. We need all of those things. Going rabid over a symbolic concrete wall is irresponsible.
@steph93065 @realDonaldTrump @ICEgov If congressional R's thought a huge honking wall was worth the price tag, they would have fought for it, if they were right, they would convince enough Dems, neither of those things happened. Even trump had to say Mexico would pay to make the idea popular.
@DavidWohl @steph93065 @realDonaldTrump This echos what was said about the right in 2016.

@macca4561061 @hoo_memes @BellaInxs2 I can't! I'm gonna write socialism Monopoly rules, play the game, and see what happens. Guarantee it ends in a never-ending stalemate with all property owned and no losers but everyone gets richer and richer (if you add the 200 to the 35% tax)
@macca4561061 @hoo_memes @BellaInxs2 Also, the 200 dollars in this version is just lost, that's not the same game, add the 200 to the 35% and you have an equal economy to the classic game.
@macca4561061 @hoo_memes @BellaInxs2 Bad argument for capitalism.
@macca4561061 @hoo_memes @BellaInxs2 Lol why wouldn't you buy property? Wouldn't that just create a system  where the players hold equal amounts of property once all is bought and the game would never end? Also considering the classic game leaves the majority of players in economic ruin...

@4thevulnerable @STUinSD I wish I could value human life like that, its noble. But I have trouble doing that knowing the world we live in, the war and overpopulation. Abortion seems like the kindest way to keep us from breeding ourselves straight to Armageddon. It's that or genocide or a 2 child policy.

@4thevulnerable @STUinSD Cuz when someone is brainwashed, it's easier, morally, to tie them to a chair and force feed them your beliefs because they're not a rational human being anymore.
@4thevulnerable @STUinSD No no. That's not why he's bigoted. I respect the pro life fight, even tho I'm on the other side. He's bigoted because he says I must be brainwashed. The fact that others hold a VALID opinion on abortion that is different from his is something he cannot accept.

@STUinSD I guess if you value human life that much (7,600,000,000 and counting) you could make the argument that those chains are worthwhile, but thinking that people who believe something different must be broken or brainwashed doesn't make you woke, it makes you a bigot.
@STUinSD Hipocracy shines through. Youre not fighting to change people's minds on abortion or offering to adopt anyone and save some lives that way. You're fighting for chains on people's choices.
@STUinSD So you don't think abortion is ok. You don't believe that. Fine. Don't have one. I think abortion is ok. Not ideal, but better than birth in some cases. Will you respect my belief and leave the authorities out of it? No. You want to control peoples actions. That's where your....

@steph93065 @jerkymania2018 Well what can we as Americans do to help them out while at the same time respecting their culture? Idc if they celebrate Cinco de Mayo, I do care if they want one of those crazy military governments.
@steph93065 Can't argue with that. It's happening isn't it? Trump cut immigration by half I read somewhere. Like I feel bad we can't just let everyone in, it's great here, but over population is killin us.
@hoo_memes @steph93065 @InezFeltscher @POTUS True that. I think alot of us libs are stuck on the 2016 trump promises when it comes to border security. We hear 'wall' and we think of his concrete monstrosity from sea to sea. We haven't recognized that he's given ground and that we should too.
@steph93065 If we're really trying to brown the country to get more voters on the left and it's not just the ebbs and flows of the global population, I think we're in for a nasty surprise lol
@steph93065 Well I agreed with the second part. You seem to be wrong about Latinos in general tho, it really seems to be an urban/rural thing not a white/brown thing. Here's a fact or two https://t.co/cwS8WiObiC https://t.co/ksZBZTmDnR
@steph93065 Well it's just numbers, but yes, also just a smidge. You have to assume they don't go on to say 'all white people love Trump' in the articles.
@steph93065 Whether this is true or not is a legit sociological question
@steph93065 You'd have to make the leap that people are people and race doesn't determine political identity. Things like personal values, economic standing, and location do. The leap that says if some more Latinos lived in rural trump country, they would vote red in greater numbers.
@meduza_en @deray Fuck you @google
@steph93065 Wow that's just a smidge racist. Conservatives Latinos exist you know.
@hoo_memes @steph93065 @InezFeltscher @POTUS But for me, the whole anti trump movement served and important purpose. It was a check and a spotlight on some of the GOP's more evil plans, like Trumpcare and the trump wall (the one Trump originally proposed). Now Dems have the house, we need a new mission statement I suppose.
@hoo_memes @steph93065 @InezFeltscher @POTUS I'll give him credit right now, he's a hell of an exec and a good public speaker. It certainly hasn't been as bad as it could have been. He's just unpredictable, and IMO was unqualified for swaths of the job he took. But he's learning.
@hoo_memes @steph93065 @InezFeltscher @POTUS He had real problems with his businesses over the last few decades, he was bailed out by banks, other wealthy people and Russian oligarchs. He never released his finances. How am I supposed to know who he owes, what promises he made to his debtors?
@hoo_memes @steph93065 @InezFeltscher @POTUS Unresolved issues with his businesses and potential emoulments violations, hired way too many billionaires to his cabinet for my liking, pulled us out of Paris and the Iran Deal. All of these things I disagree with. But what really gets me is I can't trust him.
@hoo_memes @steph93065 @InezFeltscher @POTUS Hard to explain in a tweet. Trump hired his kids, regularly signs EO's that get taken to court and are halted, plays politics with the DOJ, promotes unproven conspiracies, and shows distain for our democratic allies around the globe.

@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich Well let's hope your wrong. Let's hope she's doing research and comes up with a reasonable proposal.
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich https://t.co/gGIwnQxym3
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich But nay. So the 5.7 bil would go to cbp. And it's head said this on how the money would be spent. Sounds legit to me. It also sounds like a good wall will cost a helluva lot more than 20 billion if 5 billion gets us 215 miles of good wall. https://t.co/gqju0h6gAU
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich Ah. Very probably. If that's the way he builds it you could be right. My fear is that that 5.7 would go to say... Only the materials for the full wall, or only for footing for the full wall, then it's like 'in for a penny in for a pound'.
@realDonaldTrump @IngrahamAngle This makes no sense to me
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich But his tough guy character wouldn't let him do that I suppose. Not sure if that was suggested before or after the shutdown, but it was a few weeks before today at the least.
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich The other choice was do what the democrats suggested from the get go. 3 weeks of funding, a border commission in Congress, then if Nancy still wouldn't want any barrier funding at all, then a shutdown or NE. Wouldn't that have worked?
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich I'll need to look it up
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich So 5.68 billion instead of 5.7? Meh. A question I have is HOW it would be spent. Cuz estimates say ittl cost ~$20B. If the plan was to build less wall in strategic areas with the 5.7, that's one thing. To use it as a deposit for the full wall, that's a full commitment.
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich And unfortunately, no matter how noble his cause, to let him dictate the budget like that is to let him neuter the power of Congress. I hope you get some reasonable fencing out of this. A good deal should leave both sides equally disappointed.
@hoo_memes @KatiePavlich Yes. But it's not about what he was trying to get it was how he was trying to get it. Remember that the house and Senate were set to pass the budget  before he personally stepped in and "took up the mantle" of the shutdown.

@eveolve1121 @thesum @TrumpStudents Yes, but that facade serves a purpose. When they're caught in nefarious activities, they are shamed. Donald Trump is immune to shame, so when 'Mexico will pay' turns into 'Ill hold the fed hostage', he's mostly unaffected.
@Diggrich_ @Daeavorn @Cernovich I'm all in if he gets Mexico to pay for it, because it would imply Mexican consent, and they're our biggest trading partner. I know you don't care about diplomacy but some people do
@Diggrich_ @Daeavorn @Cernovich The make Mexico pay for the wall memory laps among his supporters astounds me. You are actively fighting for him to break one of his campaign promises.
@Diggrich_ @Daeavorn @Cernovich Yes, I'm obstructing, I'm obstructing what I see as a bad idea financially and politically. Trump would've lost if he said "I'll build a great wall at our southern border, and I'll shut down the federal government to pay for it"

@NNafsak @ColumbiaBugle @proudamericanmm I don't care
@bythisplatform @TomFitton @RepGosar @azcentral A net gain, the same. This is based purely on financials. The argument that we need a cartoonish wall to solve the problem of illegal immigration might make sense if it would be a net saving for our economy. I'm saying that argument is pure bull.
@ColumbiaBugle @proudamericanmm Nothing about this video makes any sense to me. I don't know who's offending who, I don't know what's happening, and I'm perfectly willing to take a pass on the whole situation.

@wahoo53975320 @GOPChairwoman I don't think so. Paternal testing isn't as difficult as a whole DNA examination. You only have to look at a few chromosomes. Probably less than $20 per test wholesale. And we can catch and release those ones, saving money on detention.
@wahoo53975320 @GOPChairwoman I saw that, the image does make you jump to conclusions. But maybe they were gay, maybe the woman was already in the US, maybe she fell behind, maybe she was dead. And maybe they were gang members going to sell those kids. Itd be interesting to find out.

@Amitpulani @benshapiro Definitely. But under that, there is legitimate fact disputes. The unknown and unknowable true cost benefit of non-citizens and effectiveness of a wall.  I think it's a bad investment, far from Americas worst, but that alone is no reason to just try a 20B project.

@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze 50 billion. That would be a good return. I just don't have faith in the $134 billion dollar number they say they're costing us. I mean we all cost the government money, but we also make it. We're a tax base, so are they. I'll vote to commission better studies.
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Idk what plan you are referring to. We passed and built fencing in 2006. That only planned some areas. We're talking about filling in the gaps thru uninhabited desert.
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze That's not how that works. I would dearly love to have samples of the fish in your river over the last 50 years to check the lead and arsenic levels. Slowly, surely, it's in you right now, punching little holes in your cells and corrupting your DNA
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Maybe. They pay taxes, so they say. Let's say they build the wall, and it's awesome, and expensive, and we keep it up. What do you think the real savings will be? Your own opinion?
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze By who? First it's concrete, now it's steel, first it's 4 billion, then 12, then 20, and now 5.7. What big plan is there?
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Yup, you got your upper class tax cuts and people can dump things into rivers now, what else?
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Also, your number is inflated, and you make the critical mistake. That $116B inflated number is dolled out by federal, state, AND local governments. The returns will go to the states and they'll fight like hell to keep it all and win.
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Ya cuz that's how government spending works. It's always fair.
@wahoo53975320 @JacobAWohl @realDonaldTrump Of course. Illegal immigrants should be deported and I don't like the fact that anyone comes over without permission, let alone violent criminals. I wish it was as simple as a wall but considering human nature, I know it's not.
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Not even the short term cash, but the long term maintenance funding. A wall full of holes will prevent 0 migrants from entering. And guess what gets cut by democrats when they get in power???
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Theres sooo many problems with the wall. It has to be inland of the border in some places and it cuts off access to the Rio Grande. Eminent domain too. And Mexico rejects the idea it's a diplomatic nightmare. And the $$$
@matigrje @denvernight @hrtablaze Walls work, sometimes. Sometimes they don't. Because the people who see it everyday have a bias. Not a bad bias, but to them, it would give them a strategic advantage in their work. They're not ranchers. They're not animals who need access to that river, and they're not migrants

@denvernight @hrtablaze The polls will tell don't they. The only thing I heard of any persuasive nature was that the border agents want the wall. I don't even know if it's true, but if it is, I'd still tend to trust experts over border cops.
@JxhnBinder @steph93065 This fact check makes the assumption that a wall will stop all illegal immigration, all drugs coming through, and will magically catapult all current non citizens out of the country.
@jlothefenix @Richard_Swartz @benshapiro So to answer your question, walls work for mansions because they're small and in populated areas. Most country estates don't have walls, because they're expensive and because motion detectors work and cameras are more efficient.
@jlothefenix @Richard_Swartz @benshapiro A wall in unpopulated areas is less of a barrier to the act of border jumping. There won't be witnesses during the 5 minutes it takes to climb over it, and they still have to travel in the desert, where infrared satillite and drones will pick up their signal.
@jlothefenix @Richard_Swartz @benshapiro Remember how the Dems voted for 700 miles of fencing? That was in populated areas, where there are local witnesses and crossers can easily go to ground at a safehouse. It forced crossers to go to the desert, where many of them get picked up

@oldcrow324 @RealSaavedra 750 million a year is the high estimate. So if you accept that and 20 billion total cost, it's the equivalent of building a new wall every 27 years, which makes sense if you think about other construction projects like bridges, this is no different https://t.co/i9hUWDHGfE

@BigWaveBoss @NBCNews @BretBaier Yes. Ignoring homegrown terrorists, terrorists who backpack in from Canada, and terrorists with visas and to throw all our resources to make sure we get every single last terrorist at the southern border is acceptable. Not ideal, but acceptable.
@jrob840 @tz1969 @aalex2 @NBCNews It doesn't matter if you think that, what matters is how we set sensible priorities. Do we do it with fear? Do we lie and misrepresent numbers all the time to make our point? No. We look at the data and set actual priorities based on actual numbers.

@RealSaavedra Sounds true. She's perfect.
@thecjpearson Well, in some circles, the phrase 'thinking for yourself" doesn't mean independent thought about deep complex issues, it means you've decided that personal gain is what's most important to you, despite and to the detriment of your friend and family and community

@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley Imagine 50,000 law professors from all over the globe voting on the jurisprudence of a single unprecedented case. Imagine 50,000 economists voting on a merger with nothing but the overall good of humanity in their minds. No lobbying, no conflicts. Just the best guess.
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley If you had let me finish I would have concluded that you're absolutely right. That we can use smartphone and the internet to vote democratically (in the original sense of the word) for everything and abolish politicans for good.
@FreeWhiteMale Follow more #Resistance accounts. Seriously. When I'm analyzing the days news, BS from the right and BS from the  left is the only way I can tell, with the 15 minutes I have, what is Actually worth caring about.
@FreeWhiteMale Bud f*** her if she thinks my tax dollars are going to free college to youngsters who are going to replace me at work without some serious reparations to the bills I've already paid off. You hear me @AOC ????
@FreeWhiteMale The only thing than endears me to AOC is how much panic she's got the right under. BTW, 70% income tax isn't too crazy. Now, as with then, loopholes will allow the super rich to donate to charity to lower their taxes, which is better than donating to they're caymsn island account https://t.co/oMzg8vJzoY
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley No. The opposite. Let the automation flow, solar powered and completely self reliant and self improving. You know where that leads? To a 75% unemployment rate. You know what will save human dignity then? Socialism.
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley Fine. Fight for small gvmt. Just know you'll lose. As with the free market, efficiency dominates. From the creation of the first public school in 1821 (in my hometown), all the way to Obamacare, weve gone in one direction. Collectivism.
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley It starts here. You know what it's capable of. You know that it, more than globalism, or illegals, or corruption, is what's "hurting" the poor and middle class. https://t.co/ICu9jWG9JX
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley Karl Marx died in 1883, and good riddance. Communism is not equal to socialism. I'd like to make a more modern proposal and hear your reaction. It may take a few tweets. But 🐻 with me.
@FreeWhiteMale My first realization that that when the hype, the wave comes, take a step back. Cuz by all accounts he really said it. But it was an offer, not a threat. Yet the headline 'Trump threatens to invade Mexico' was everywhere. I wouldve sworn then he'd be impeached within the week.
@FreeWhiteMale I keep coming back to this on the subject of fake reports. https://t.co/8CgzHvCJ5C
@FreeWhiteMale I've done it myself, why do u think i follow so many MAGAs? If there's some fake news out there, they'll set the record straight.
@FreeWhiteMale The actual tweet has more btw, welcome back https://t.co/GOkH2Ewi5W
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley Ur right. I'm a lefty globalist. I think borders should've gone out the window with the development of global trade and communication. It scares you doesn't it. Given the possible upside is peace and prosperity on Earth, what's so scary about globalism?
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley Your right on the second one
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley And a booming coyote trade will spring up. Tunnels, boats, forged documents will flourish as they will become the most cost effective route. I just don't see it as worth it.
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley Yes. It will stop illegal border jumps at the southern border, at great cost. (Our border is ~12x longer) It won't stop visa overstays and it won't stop fentanyl, a condomfull of which is thousands of doses once diluted.
@hrtablaze In fact I'm pretty sure trump is simply f***ing with you. Playing off your desire to 'own the libs'. If you feel that the shutdown is hurting Dems, you'll ignore the damage it's doing to the country and you'll ignore the many republicans currently being hit by the shutdown.
@hrtablaze And what's your basis for thinking that?
@RyanAFournier I'm pretty sure we've been doing that since day one
@TomJefferson30 @stclairashley The only way that will ever happen is if we get all imperial and make every county on Earth as awesome as we are. You think a wall or prison sentence is scarier than drug gangs and extreme poverty? Theres nothing we can threaten that's worse than what some of them are living with

@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra I do not want what he is painting. But I don't have the faith in the free market you do. We have an income inequality problem the founders with their limitless land and underpopulation couldn't dream of. We need wealth redistribution in the modern lighting fast free market.
@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra How many slaves do you think it they used. I have no idea. But I bet it was thousands.
@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra Think tho. Social programs curtail poverty. Poverty is directly related to crime, including violent crime. So spending on social programs prevents danger to Americans. More than the threat non-citizens pose by an exponential amount I'd say.
@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra Also if I were a Mexican I'd take pot shots at that thing every chance I've got, on principle. We can build a wall but it will be a battle every year to keep it up.
@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra It's not 20 billion, it's more. It will cost maintenance, a huge wall in the desert. It will crumble every few years. Look at these economical things, they're not exactly the great Wall of China https://t.co/f8t6rAW9MF
@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra I love cod. I agree with that. But even socialist countries get paychecks for their work. It's a balancing act. But we were talking about the wall.
@wahoo53975320 @thevictor312 I understand, but it's never worthless, at the very least, you learn something new about yourself.
@wahoo53975320 @thevictor312 I mean it's literally the Constitution. So it's stretchieness should be tested in court.
@JohnWil66453546 @RealSaavedra Ok so if I understand you, if it says somewhere in the Constitution, like in the commerce clause, that they have to PROVIDE for the general welfare, then social programs are as important as defense. Is that right? https://t.co/tJtj3ZUmUD
@thevictor312 Ur right of course but spreading hate is satisfying when you feel your cause is justified.
@wahoo53975320 @thevictor312 The law is unclear cuz every prez sold off his business assets before trump. There's no precedents
@wahoo53975320 @thevictor312 Pfft. You tell me. If the Saudi prince spends money on a hotel room, and a portion of the money go to an account in Trump's name, can you say trump accepted an emolument from a prince of a forign state? I say yes, but you tell me. https://t.co/6a5RackHjA
@LegendaryEnergy @Cernovich But you could also be describing the natural national discourse.	1. Media tells people a bad thing person did.	2. Negative comments ensue, obviously famous peoples' voices are loud.	3. People all agree it was bad. 		COMMUNICATION
@thevictor312 I wish I could. But Donnie Two-Scoops makes it difficult. He didn't sell off his hotel business. He made HIMSELF the beneficiary of a trust that his businesses contribute to and his son controls (ya, really). If he doesn't show respect for his position, how can I?

@Cernovich You know, she's got a different gender, race, political outlook and childhood decade than u Mike. She may just express herself differently. Don't magnify her little statements and insist she's lying cuz it doesn't align with your worldview. Good thread tho.

@O2supply @Bluebonnet60 @LVNancy @KAG4All @BET Only if the point is some people don't read. I'm sure everyone with a vested interest in it knows. Reporting on trump is probably more comprehensive that any other potus, good and bad.
@thecjpearson The argument that we shouldn't be mad at IC over this is flawed. If you're looking at it as a 'who to blame', you need to remember that not everything is a zero sum game. The detention facilitiy and the mother share the blame for this preventable tragedy

@wahoo53975320 @MarkYoungTruth @Ocasio2018 God bless our redundant system. Look. I'm afraid Trump's a wanna be autocrat. Call me loony. But I hope you recognize the convenient expedience of an autocracy, it's tempting, and why a "strong leader" like trump scares me.
@XaviersSavior @steph93065 @Barnes_Law You should consider the ones who work. They bring an uncounted uncountable number of billions into our economy with their under-the-table, exploitable cheap labor. Not that that's moral but estimates I've read say their impact is relatively neutral.
@wahoo53975320 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Pfft. No. Betos too young and toxic. My girl Beth Warren will be older than trump was when she runs in 2020 (she's great, law professor, hates the 1%) But I hope some governor or someone will show up.
@XaviersSavior @steph93065 @Barnes_Law Put yourself in an immigrants shoes. Do you think you could pull it off? Would you try to anyway? I would.
@XaviersSavior @steph93065 @Barnes_Law Cuz they spend 60000 or more on every single officer you mentioned.  The wall funding would cut into border patrol funding inevitably. It's stupid. Nobody will stop them on the Mexicans' side. They'll leave the ladder behind.
@wahoo53975320 @MarkYoungTruth @Ocasio2018 I think we're accepting it. Good ideas can't be resisted for too long. My town built a solar field a few years back (MA liberal), we have a local electric co. and pay 1/2 as much as other towns who use NSTAR and others.
@XaviersSavior @steph93065 @Barnes_Law Well no. The ladder and rope would only act as cover technically (but not really), as they would be at ambient temperature and not show up on IR. I don't get it. Why don't you want to spend the billions on more men?? Ive always assumed it was cuz a wall looks n sounds impressive
@wahoo53975320 @GOP @realDonaldTrump Lemmie ask. Seriously. What would turn you against that NY billionaire? Like the left has only looked into things that infuriated the left. All for the clicks. Maddow et al. Maybe really shoot someone on 5th Ave? Or what?

@steph93065 @Barnes_Law Were trump not*
@steph93065 @Barnes_Law Ok. Politically, trump has been under fire for his bad behavior for a while now. His moral failings have been the single greatest impediment to conservative progress thus far. Maybe McCain (RIP) would have voted the 'right' way were not such a degenerate.
@steph93065 @Barnes_Law That's because ur on the right. He is, to you. Not me, he's a menace. But your political hero has to not be a scumbag, as well as a good leader. Or he'll get smeared and investigated to the point of uselessness to you. Or do you not recall you lost the house?
@steph93065 @Barnes_Law You know that feeling? Nothing else quite like it.
@steph93065 @Barnes_Law Wow that's some false equivancy. And you used one of that slimeballs slimiest moments as a defense? Lol. Ok. Call it a campaign donation. It cost $0. Clear and legal.

@biff0101 @JackPosobiec Or the evidence Huber received clears the Clinton foundation. So he "lost" it to save face in front of Congress.
@sunray902003 @JackPosobiec Idk the Mueller investigation has gone pretty far, gathered lots of evidence and didn't lose any. It sounds like this Huber fellow is just a terrible investigator.
@SebGorka Well that's true, he was cleared on one charge and the jury couldn't decide on the 5 others, judge declared a mistrial. But there was still a trial, still charges. The argument that the Edwards case set a precedent that those laws can NEVER be enforced is, IMO, fallacious.
@SebGorka Did a lil research. The only argument sebs article up there states to clear trump is that former sen Edwards of NC was tried for the same charges and the justice Dept "lost". https://t.co/w53cAVjcRn

@FreeWhiteMale @Chadwick_Moore @realDonaldTrump And there it will sit, full of holes the Mexicans will make, because of course they would, if for no other reason than psychological satisfaction, useless, as we argue about how to pay for it.
@FreeWhiteMale @Chadwick_Moore @realDonaldTrump Because in I think they said 7 or 10 years after the wall was completed we would spend as much as it costs to build the wall on maintaining the wall. And ittl keep draining money until we inevitably let it crumble.
@FreeWhiteMale @Chadwick_Moore @realDonaldTrump What I'm saying is, I guess I could get behind a wall bill if it included a big aid package, and we loosen immigration requirements a bit. I want to discourage crime, not immigration.
@FreeWhiteMale @Chadwick_Moore @realDonaldTrump The only way I see is to embrace the globalism angle and pound the poverty right out of those failing latin american countries with aid and occasional sniper fire.
@FreeWhiteMale @Chadwick_Moore @realDonaldTrump I was thinking about that today. I concluded that it could trip up Mexico cartel activity considerably. Big dent in the drug trade, human trafficking but I don't see a single Honduran, desperate and ready for a months long trek towards a new life changing his plans because of it.
@wahoo53975320 @1776Stonewall Well that first one, for context is 1/10th as long and in a more heavily populated area, more police you see. More witnesses. But I like the great wall. I'll vote for a great wall. Just to stick it to China and for no other reason.

@tejadaantonatos @HippieWith @Lisa82446588 @conservmillen Concrete is not some super modern material tho. Plus, they'll build ladders. 3 men, no border patrol, a ladder, night in the desert, how long will the wall stop them? 2 minutes? 3 maybe? Pfft.

@gruler @JackPosobiec With strict voter id laws and other methods to strengthen security of elections, you make it more difficult for citizens to vote. Some forget their ID, some are bums without ID, some can't wait in the long lines caused by ID checks. That decreases integrity.
@soldier4Him I won't speak to that for I had no idea it existed. Reminds me if that Simpsons episode tho. "Sure we could save a few lives, but millions will be late!"
@soldier4Him @VFL_70 @RealSaavedra I'm pretty sure. It's physics. I'm as sure that it's safe down there as I am that I can't mix oil and water.
@gruler @JackPosobiec Which is fine. I hope for both. Honestly using Dem operatives to collect only registered Dem ballots and vice versa is pretty safe. As long as they're sealed by the voter.
@gruler @JackPosobiec I'm not going to suppress any votes because of the SPECTRE of voter fraud. She said herself the envelope must be signed and sealed.

@Stef_Coburn @Cernovich Yes. The storm is coming. It's all a big conspiracy, and trump is working hard to take them all down. All those liberals who hate him, they're all pedos, and ultimately trump will win win win. Sounds reasonable.

@whatsmynuts @deegenoMN @Cernovich Only if they're wrong. Most likely they're pretty sure about their info, but then WikiLeaks comes out swinging, and they're like 'did we get played? Is this not true?' then made the edits, thus shooting their credibility among the skeptics in the foot.

@JackPosobiec O wow thatll show um
@rising_serpent Which Dems??
@AlissMaxwell @hagarofficial @rising_serpent Ya that's true too
@rising_serpent No. Because operation costs would go up in the US. Tariffs are paid by companies. Why the heck do you think they wouldnt close plants here?? How do the tariffs on steel n aluminum in the US make it more expensive to make cars in Mexico?
@FinnFactor @rising_serpent I'm just listening to GM, who warned us this would happen. https://t.co/HMUwPRcPfB
@ScottTBrower1 @rising_serpent What? Steel prices go up, so their costs go up. They have to close plants because they're losing money. What am I missing?
@FreeWhiteMale @HamillHimself Mmmmm. They want in. I get that. Mexico sucks compared to America. I really didn't think they'd try to rush the border tho. Disappointed.
@Cernovich What's this fisa thing going to prove again? Page or Papadopoulos?
@deegenoMN @whatsmynuts @Cernovich Good, now use critical thinking. Im especially curious about these docs from Ecuadorian intelligence. It's all he said, she said right now.

@InstigatorRules @Cernovich The only rebuttal of the story so far is from WikiLeaks, so no probably not, as they don't have the resources to know that, ittl take days of MI6 flipping thru old footage to know that
@gillianbdoll @Cernovich Let them, apparently the Guardian had a source and a paper trail. Looks like someone from Ecuadorian intelligence. https://t.co/Rdb5SrUc9i
@Cernovich Is that a fact
@Winston56967308 @Cernovich Yes! Chewing the definition of surge, implying 36 incidents arnt enough to care about, and magnifying the incidents where the motive is uncertain ARE NOT FACTS. Its opinion.
@wahoo53975320 @faithleemooney No not the family, the tear gas. Tear gas canisters get hot AF when they go off, and spray tear gas. Nobody picked it up an actively spraying tear gas can and moved it away from the fence for added effect.
@Winston56967308 @Cernovich No... It's not the facts, the facts are what I want. That's why I like real news articles, it's alot of dry facts. This is dripping with supposition, with assumption. Give me a paragraph # and I'll tell you the unproven assumption. It should be marked opinion not politics.
@FreeWhiteMale @HamillHimself I mean you've heard we're slowing down on asylum claims, the line is getting longer and these ppl are living poor and hungry in a Mexican stadium. This was inevitable. Don't get mad. Don't be like Trump. Just come out and say this is the policy you wanted. https://t.co/2gtASLa4KP
@FreeWhiteMale @HamillHimself Believe that this was an 'organic' photo? Nope. That the migrants shouldn't have been beaten back? Nope. That this and other unseen human tragedy was an inevitable cost of Trump's border policy? Yup.
@yurself @JackPosobiec @smit3936 Lemme predict what's going to happen. Huber will give the Senate a bunch of info they already have, Meadows will demand a special Counsel, and it will get voted down in committee

@BennyCampanelli @Cernovich Who cares??? It's not like it's going to stop giving off energy. Please just don't burn things excessively.
@Cernovich When ultraviolet energy hits an O2 molecule, it just goes on it's way. When it hits a CO2 molecule, it gets absorbed and is emitted as heat bearing infared energy. You don't need grants to understand global warming you need a chemistry textbook.

@MacMimi61 @rising_serpent Who's paying the taxes? The Bernie bill up there will make Walmart pay more taxes. After the tax cuts, the US paid more income taxes, but 30% less from corporate taxes.
