@BlackLlvesM I have supported and condemned police on individual cases.  If it's easy to look up, then do it!  I'll leave with this, once you have aliened everyone from watching a sport, then where is your protest?  Change comes from each individual  doing the right thing.
@BlackLlvesM Those kind of cops should be stripped of their badges!  No excuse for this!  But dont include the good with the bad.
@BlackLlvesM go ahead.
@BlackLlvesM Because your not looking.
@BlackLlvesM AT WORK!
@BlackLlvesM How do you know I haven't? Once again you have projected a false narrative of who I am, and you dont even know me!  I'm for equality of ALL races! For we all come from the same place!  So dont start with that!
@BlackLlvesM oh here comes the racist remark.  Grow up!  That's getting old.  I don't have a problem with anybody standing up for their rights.
@BlackLlvesM I have never blocked anyone!  Were having a discussion right?  I've actually never gotten involved in those groups at work.  I have in my personal time.
@BlackLlvesM  You just don't get it!  Nor do I think you want to get it.  It's all political with you, but all I'm saying, your turning more people away from your plight than helping by the way all this turned out.
@BlackLlvesM if I went to my work Monday to protest something I feel was important to me and it cost my workplace money, what do you think would happen?  I'd get fired!!!!
@BlackLlvesM I said dont protest at work!!!!
@BlackLlvesM you don't know me!  One tweet and you are an expert on me?  Go back and read before starting things.

@BlackLlvesM looks like you need to take it up with Jesus.  I just wanted to watch football.  But thanks to people like you who force issues, I dont care to watch overgrown paid men force issues into people who pay to see a sport.
@BlackLlvesM if I were to something like that at my job, I would be fired!  There's a time and place for it.  You forcing the issue at work is not gonna win you any votes.  Just the opposite.  Not everyone cares about your plight.  All I'm saying.
