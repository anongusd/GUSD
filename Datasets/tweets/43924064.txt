Have you ever seen one of the litter traps on the Anacostia? The trap at Kenilworth captures 8,000-12,000 pounds of trash every year.
Great question from a caller on how to manage stormwater. Polluted runoff is the #1 threat to the Potomac. It is the fastest growing source of pollution to the river. River friendly growth and nature based solutions that capture and filter pollution are key!
In the 1960s 250,000 TONS of garbage were burned along the Anacostia River. The dump is closed now, but the area around the dump still hasn't been fully cleaned up. #KojoShow
Did you know at one time the second largest port on the eastern seaboard was on the Anacostia River? Tobacco was shipped around the world from Bladensburg.
