@HieronymusMcG @JRubinBlogger So he's willing to negotiate. We'll see if the Dems are.
@tatestreet21 @ryanjreilly @jimsciutto In other words Mueller will bankrupt you after he entraps you, then force capitulation over substantively immaterial minutia.

@TonyBooYay @RepAdamSchiff Trump didn't have to impose a travel on people from Yemen. Obama already had it place, for years, before Trump took office.
@sowhat_Isaidit @RepAdamSchiff Little known fact. It was Obama that imposed the travel ban on people from Yemen.
@nytimes I read it. 	Didn't see any lies.	Saw attempts to entrap. 	Quite a few.
@nytopinion An unexpected take from NYT.
@anthonynaut @marilynmaupin @aedwardslevy @daveweigel Short answer. They don't. 	Climate models are already running 2 sigma too hot vs observations.  ie statistically insignificant. 	50+ new studies showing co2 sensitivity lower than expected.  		These findings should be good news.	Nope.  Keep pushing for $ that will do nothing.
@jeff_shufelt @washingtonpost It's so interesting to hear what a terrible man Trump is.	Bombing Libya back into the stone age.	Now that's terrible.		Mean tweets about the biased press seem to impact people more these days.
@MikeMicasherman @Fidelovkurt @marblee @KamalaHarris The bamster acted like a man of peace then bombed Libya into the stone age, murdering 10's of 1000's.  Then created the worst refugee crisis in decades with his war in Syria.  		Trump keeps us out of war but tweets mean stuff to the press.  I see your point.
@alanlechtenberg @nytimes Glad that you caught Ms Clinton spent millions in California, the singular source for this great numerical achievement. 		For what? 		A pyrrhic victory, a consolation prize, a historical footnote.		Congratulations.
@MikeMicasherman @Fidelovkurt @marblee @KamalaHarris I prefer the outsider, the disrupter, the iconoclast, the man everyone in establishment loves to hate.  He fights back.  He calls them out.  Himself. He doesn't hide behind a phalanx of surrogates.  A real man.  In other words not Obama.

@JRubinBlogger Sounds like the Dems prefer not to address border security, and the resulting drugs, child trafficking, smuggling, opportunistic &amp; corrupt coyotes that play on people's desires.  		Talk about governance.

@BikerMike03flhr @poliloquy @MrTope @nprpolitics How conveniently the left ignore this all started in spring of 2016.	Since there was no collusion, nevermind, it's now about a fake campaign finance charge. Another swing and miss by the deranged Trump hater.

@Walleye4me @jmartNYT @maggieNYT Press ≠ truth		Fun to see how you expose your bias even more b/c of Trump's tweets.		You hate him.	Glib mockery can't hide it.
@PhilippeReines @RadioFreeTom Lol. I love the 2 P's in Philippe.	It has an aristocratic air doesn't it? 	Defending Bezos, and AT&amp;T.	On top of that calling for Trump's impeachment b/c of it.		You aren't an aristocrat. You're just out of touch.
@giacomonyt @nytimes I love the turnover.
@giacomonyt @nytimes W/o evidence, NYT has a "report".
@SDNYnews thinks Trump violated campaign $. You look like partisan Trump haters. Obama spent 160 M on inauguration, you did NOTHING.		Your attacks are partisan. 	GFY.
@nytimes Where can I get a yellow vest?
@1parickert @washingtonpost The "professor" has a comment. Just like all the election butthurt elitists, they want continuation of the DC cesspool.
@DonnaCassata @davelevinthal @Fahrenthold @mattzap @seungminkim David reported 160 million went to Obama's inauguration. Not a single "investigation". The double standard attacking the DC outsider is clear.
@MrTope @poliloquy @BikerMike03flhr @nprpolitics Trust of Trump hating media causes a loss of logical thought. Campaign finance violation requires  consideration of $ evaluation whether he would have logically spent same $ as private citizen. Media won't say this. Totally logical he would do this.
@FeralCil @washingtonpost Alpha doesn't like Trump. ACA is dead. Obama's onerous regulations dead. 		He's doing everything I want.
@brandihunt411 @tedlieu Lieu is an idiot.
@TomSteyer LOL Tommy.
@CarolLeonnig Meanwhile Carol never said a word when the enviro lobby literally wrote law for the leftist EPA bureaucratic stooges.

@CarolLeonnig @Fahrenthold @mattzap @seungminkim Carol and media stoking Trump's effort to cut off bad PR as a criminal campaign $ scheme. LOL.
@BikerMike03flhr @poliloquy @MrTope @nprpolitics First card to fall. Mueller team hides original Flynn 302 from judge. He demands it. They give the modified 302. He demands the original. Original specifically states Flynn did not lie. Mueller team PURPOSELY hid exculpatory evidence. 	https://t.co/qUbQjYki4F
@BikerMike03flhr @poliloquy @MrTope @nprpolitics I'm old enough to remember when spying on an opposing party was a crime. Obama's abuse of spying which enlisted partisans in gov intel makes Watergate look like child's play.
@giacomonyt @nytimes Sorry Mueller, when McCabe said "when we f Flynn, we f Trump"		We know you jumped on board Bobby.
@BikerMike03flhr @MrTope @poliloquy @nprpolitics Trump didn't intend to violate campaign finance. He intended to keep  potentially bad PR from making the news.
@mrhapiguy @RepAdamSchiff If the rabid left had any evidence they might have a point.	After almost 2 years which included planting spies in his campaign, you have nothing.		Time to investigate the investigation for their abuse of power.
@BikerMike03flhr @MrTope @poliloquy @nprpolitics Disagree. There is well documented history of candidates spending $ on PR issues that had not yet become public that could possibly harm their campaign.		Trump heading off a PR disaster is NOT a crime.
@MrTope @BikerMike03flhr @poliloquy @nprpolitics Edwards didn't use his personal funds.
@BikerMike03flhr @MrTope @poliloquy @nprpolitics To prove campaign $ violation you must prove that Trump would have never done it in his personal life if he never ran for office.  	Doesn't pass Mike.  It wasn't a violation.  You might get some Obama judge to agree with you but will ultimately be thrown out.  Just like Edwards.
@BikerMike03flhr @MrTope @poliloquy @nprpolitics Problem is they apparently began discussing this in 2014, well before any run for office.  If Trump paid off his dentist to ensure no one knew he got his teeth whitened, are you saying this too would be breaking campaign finance laws?	What if it were hair implants?
@bradheath So Obama DOJ/Admin can illegally leaks secret communications and Flynn is the one that takes the rap.	Got it media.
@eyesopenlooksee @washingtonpost WP said this about Russia collusion.  	WP just hates Trump.	WP &amp; the DC elitist swamp has been trying to get rid of him since before the inauguration.
@BikerMike03flhr @poliloquy @nprpolitics Cohen evaded personal taxes &amp; made sketchy deals with taxi medallions.  Copping a plea for campaign finance was to reduce his sentence &amp; attack Trump. 	Negotiating a Non Disclosure Agreement, something Trump would have likely done regardless of his run for pres is not criminal.
@JRubinBlogger Meanwhile favorability of the press, of which you are supposedly a member, is in the teens. 	America hates you.		Let that sink in.
@JRubinBlogger Jenny taking a stand for the brutal Houthi's, their enslaved child warriors, Iran, and the "reporter" who wept when Bin Laden left this world.
@MartinHeinrich Acute Sepsis was the primary cause Martin.  		Why did you leave this out?
@JuhMatt_Smith @kolearyUX @Romeo_Busiku @nytimes Cops a plea for campaign $ to get a lesser sentence for tax fraud/other issues. 	Prosecutors would need to prove Trump would have never made NDA deal if he wasn't a candidate.  Totally reasonable he would have done the same deal if he were a private citizen.
@tgagemurphy @maggieNYT Compared to Clinton, he's following the law.  His campaign mgr &amp; personal lawyer might not have as individuals years ago, but you still have nothing.   And personally I appreciate the fact he's clamping down on illegal immigration.
@5280_Attorney @maggieNYT @thetrevorpotter @gtconway3d @gtconway3d didn't address the inevitability rule, which was likely on purpose.   It's very reasonable to assume Trump would have done this regardless of whether he was a candidate, for strictly personal reasons.  		Keep grasping.
@RobuShiro @washingtonpost Couldn't find collusion, found a lawyer and campaign mgr who lied on their tax form years ago.		What have they found on Trump exactly that's an actual crime?		Nothing.
@kolearyUX @Romeo_Busiku @nytimes And payments made using personal $ for issues they would have likely done as a private citizen is not a campaign $ violation.
@tgagemurphy @maggieNYT Mueller's Russia "investigation" having found zero collusion, morphs into inauguration search for a crime.
@totallyballs @bradheath All others were warned Brad. Flynn wasn't. The abuse of 1001 by FBI has gotten to point where even remaining silent when asked a question can be construed as evidence of guilt.	https://t.co/XeplayIpws
@DevlinBarrett @bradheath Brad should understand the "inevitability" analysis.	This was not a crime.
@5280_Attorney @maggieNYT And Edwards was acquitted. Campaign $ violations must pass the "inevitably" analysis. If he would have spent the $ as private citizen, it's not a crime. 	Cohen is just trying to save himself now.

@grizatlcp @CarolLeonnig You're forgetting Comey's March testimony where he told Congress that Flynn didn't lie.   Mueller coerced Flynn via the threat of bankrupting him and dragging his kid into it.  Just like Mueller tried to do to Corsi.  	https://t.co/rxkxuIdRrX

@jeremymstamper @TomSteyer At least we all now know Fresans don't have to live next to you.

@grizatlcp @CarolLeonnig While the reporting on this conspiracy is sketchy at best, it's not the FBI's job to police this.  Carol is wrong.  The FBI entrapped Flynn.

@MartinHeinrich 50+ scientific studies that show co2 sensitivity low say otherwise.
@bradheath @MerrillLynched @nycsouthpaw Flynn was set up. McCabe: "no need for a lawyer" 		Part of the corrupt FBI/Intel "insurance policy"		Obama knew. He spied. Media is a BIG part of the cover up.

Co2 would need to get busy for those 2 to heat up the other 10k. https://t.co/8I6CIpS0Gu

@Miguele3Miguel @billmaher Alarmist climate models need more than elevated co2, b/c quantities r 2 small. They need co2 to transfer heat to h2o, vaporizing it in order to create the heat they predict. H2o largest ghg.		Problem is this largely isn't happening, as shown by observations.
@Miguele3Miguel @billmaher Co2 follows temp, not leading indicator. Co2 outgases from oceans, the largest sink, as temps increase. Atmospheric co2 is largely irrelevant. Your graph would predict a runaway temp, yet the last 18 yrs world temps have shown little change. 		You've been sold a faulty theory.
@Miguele3Miguel @billmaher Calif emissions standards exceed US. The rule was for CA to follow US  standards. CA standards imposed unnecessary burden on every other state. CA can either pay other states for this added cost. I'm ok with that.
@Miguele3Miguel @billmaher Spare me the denier bs. 	.0004 mole fraction of a trace gas (co2) in atmosphere is not the problem.	I remember when Malibu burned over 3 decades ago. Many homes destroyed. They enacted vegetation set backs, fire retardant building matls. 		But ppl move, no enforcement

@bleedingblueapp @pejamo @OrinKerr Symantics Heidi. It's likely the entire "investigation" re Trump is built on a house of cards, a sting using undercover spies that found nothing. Now FBI looks bad, they spied on an opposing campaign and found nothing. If they had, it would have leaked many months ago.
@bleedingblueapp @pejamo @OrinKerr You're mistaken. If Mueller wants to talk to Trump, Trump's team has every right to gain access to classified material centered around how the investigation originally started.	https://t.co/LWHgbbTiHX

@Out_spokenOne @transitt @betaylo @washingtonpost @katiecouric @Acosta He didn't have to. They sat there and acted with adoration.  I invite you to watch an Obama presser, how the media acts and compare that to a Trump presser or one with press secretary. There's an Astonishing lack of decorum &amp; disrespectful behavior by the press.
@JRubinBlogger LOL. Go back and watch an Obama press secretary. You'll note	three things, the press sec. Smugness, his lies, and a willing polite press that simply ate it up.
@SaveDemocracy16 @NPR Another figment of her psychotic imagination.
@transitt @betaylo @washingtonpost @katiecouric like he has the right.  @acosta was being a douche, like always, President answered his question, they weren't actors, he changes subject to 100's of miles away.

@PatrickDallas @CarolLeonnig @Fahrenthold @NickMiroff @missy_ryan Hard to argue when prior bills promised to stem the flow of Illegals but did nothing.		Never again.	Shut down flow first.	Then we talk about dreamers.		Too many broken promises.
@PatrickDallas @CarolLeonnig @Fahrenthold @NickMiroff @missy_ryan DREAM act presented in 2010 by D controlled congress. Basically amnesty. No protection. When basement is flooding you first turn off the water, not give amnesty to the water that's already there.		Immigration bill passed Senate in 2013. Failed in house b/c bill amnesty only.
@Ljc2017 @samjonestown @WhosePolitics @buckscience @nytimes Harkening back to 1900, where the US had little in terms of social services does not help your argument. A 0.7% difference btwn 1900 &amp; 2015 only highlights the costs current tax payers face. Also numbers are legal immigrants, 22+ million Illegals not part. Yes 22 per Yale study.
@PatrickDallas @CarolLeonnig @Fahrenthold @NickMiroff @missy_ryan Numerous bills presented. Obama threatened veto as soon as discussion started. Trump presented compromise to Schumer that gave many more citizenship than BO's offer. But D's wanted amnesty first no security to stop the illegals. Been there done that. Empty promises.
@Ljc2017 @samjonestown @WhosePolitics @buckscience @nytimes Israel seems to have found a barrier system that works.

@RottenRiah @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson It isn't harder. They've had one polling place for a decade. Media liberals like Inskeep say it makes it hard for Hispanics to vote.

@NPR President Trump can use the US military to enforce the borders. He should close the borders completely.

@TheRealBenRod1 @maggieNYT Love to see the Left, which includes Maggie, ignore the Antifa thugs. They purposely start fights wherever they go. Then blame the others for it.
@RottenRiah @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Dodge has had a single voting location for over a decade. Why is Steve upset now? He insinuates racism. My point, most Hispanics probably are Illegals therefore can't vote.
@YungSwald @ParraV @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Using illegal labor creates an artificial market. Companies use cheap labor instead of automating. 	Australia has labor shortage but automate instead.
@mexica_tiahui @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Dodge City has had single polling place for over a decade. The # of English learners points to high % non citizen Hispanics.
@YungSwald @ParraV @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Illegals in Dodge City have no voting rights. Their presence only delays the inevitable, as Australia has shown, Dodge City packers by hiring illegals are delaying and impacting automation in the industry they serve, animal processing. Australia has shown automation results.
@ekimekim1604 @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson "asshole" Steve? Your mob has appeared. Good job publicly funded "reporter".
@Ken_Meade @AltmanErin @NPRinskeep Yes.

@mariebr33587042 @NPRinskeep Legal the operative term.

@santacruzstevo @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Still here brother.
@CochinaMaricon @NPRinskeep @MaraLiasson Genius? Thanks for the compliment. My son taught inner city LA, Calif., 95%+ were either illegal children or to lesser extent anchor babies. At the expense of poor black kids already ignored by the Left. You just want votes. You can't hide this reality.
@NPRinskeep Nice anecdote, but irrelevant. Dodge City is big beef packing business. Notorious for illegal labor practices. Odds point toward majority % illegal. Presuming they're harmed re voting by your factoid is a leap.

@JillFilipovic As a Republican are you saying I have tell ALL my wives to divorce me? 	They don't have time for tweeters, they're way too busy milking the cows, chruning butter, fixing me sandwiches, servicing me.
@drmtesta @maggieNYT Dianne knew about this since July 6-9. This could have been investigated then.
@soledadobrien @giacomonyt Ms O'Brien &amp; Ms Giacomo, 	Although they tried to scrub her internet history, there are copies of Ms Ford's yearbooks.  Sex, drugs, booze, party central.  	C'mon,  Stop acting like this wasn't going on at your school. 	Maybe copies of your yearbooks are already online.
@curlybettys @SenFeinstein Can't see the connection really.  Tell me why her family (her dad) didn't sign letter of support?  Maybe her daddy is the root of Blasey's 'issues'.   The fact her voice sounds like a little girl says whatever happened to her might have started at adolescence.
@margie_silveri @nprpolitics Good idea. Men will have a much better way to differentiate the strong women from the women victim culture.
@gary7101 @NtheMike @Lisa26437 @AnnieLinskey Dems didn't want truth, they wanted to use her as tool to obstruct and delay. She'll end up just like Cindy Sheehan, a pawn used and swept away when she's no longer useful.
@gary7101 @NtheMike @Lisa26437 @AnnieLinskey Ford's first contact with Dems was July 6-9. Yet they never consulted R's and instead decided to politicize it. Just like they did from the beginning.
@JJManring @ezraklein @AmazonTraveler Dianne and Ford's handlers turned her into an operative, just like the D's have done some many times in the past. (Cindy Sheehan for ex.)	Ford will be cast aside now just like all they others they pretend to care about.
@rubendelavega11 @peterbakernyt @mpoage @danbalz Dems orchestrated the dozens of crazed liberals that got tossed out well before any allegations came to light.  Dems politicized this process from the start.
@dvorakoelling @maggieNYT After weeks of crazed liberals disrupt the hearings	8+ days of testimony	1200 questions answered	Then he's literally accused of orchestrating gang rapes.		Now his outrage over this D circus is not a "good look".		LOL.
@gary7101 @NtheMike @Lisa26437 @AnnieLinskey Senate has a large group of investigators whose sole purpose is just that.  If Dianne actually thought it wise to investigate, she should have gone to Grassley at the time w/o revealing her name.  Instead she used it as delay tactic.
@dianedarrow @stampergr @Wilkowfan @PoshSwederSide @RichLowry Not sure if you're aware of the liberal bias the ABA.  Their political donations are heavily weighted toward D candidates.

@MaraLiasson Russians are heavily involved in the ballet community and promote it in the US.  So for NPR, Russia+NRA=bad	Russia+ballet=good		More like NPR is anti gun, using Russia as their vehicle. 	Just come out &amp; say you're pushing gun control.
@2017_itstime @nprpolitics @GOP Asking why it wasn't reported 36 years ago is now considered an 'attack' by NPR.
@trumpanhator @maggieNYT Maggie now knows what oppo is.	LOL.	#DirtyDossier
@Truth_Savant @JennifferV_V 'truth' responds with a sexist personal attack. The irony.
@BrianSMcDonald @washingtonpost It was a reasonable question.
@jonathanvswan How do you define  'official'?
@fordm Blasey Ford, has offered zero evidence.  Why should you be upset someone else has done the same thing?
@DevinNunes if the president has declassified the FISA, why can't ANYONE who has a copy, simply release the content? Why not threaten to release yourself?		Let's get this party started.

@la__civetta @GeorgePapa19 There was no activity to alarm them.  Brit &amp; AU intel made the initial overtures. Outsider Trump didn't want DC ppl, either Left or Right.  Intel freaked, b/c they weren't "known" quantities &amp; overreacted, broke law, abused power.
@RoldanGMan @KenDilanianNBC @realDonaldTrump Apparently she's forgotten more than we know.	Her yearbooks while she attended Holton Arms read like they were non-stop sex craved, binge drinking party girls.

@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 Not some generic warning.  FBI warned Feinstein about a specific person, who turned out to be a spy, while she did nothing. 		Did the FBI warn Trump that Page or George P might be spies?
@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 They did meet with Page, after 3 more FISA warrants &amp; months of taps on his texts/communications. The result, as Strzok texted 'there's no there there'		Unlike Feinstein where the FBI called her on the phone re Chinese spy on her staff, they never once offered Trump the same.

@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 Paul Sperry the author is a Stanford Hoover fellow, has written for major news papers. 	Page knew he was being spied on in sept 2016. He wrote a letter to Comey offering to meet &amp; clear up ANY questions.	Instead of meeting with Page, they continued to eavesdrop, monitor his texts
@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 Article damaged the Schiff &amp; FBI spin. They say reason for FISA on Page It's just a "continuation" from 2013. 	What? 3 years later? Total BS. He was a witness in 2013.
@SteveSGoddard Delay tactic, hoping some of her classmates surface over the weekend. WP/NYT in full court press to find them.	If someone appears, confirmation over.	If not, he's confirmed, damage done, she'll spend her time with Lib media telling her story all the way to the election.
@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 He actually helped the FBI, and they likely omitted it from the record during the FISA process, painting him as a Russian spy. They lied. Strzok lied. Page helped him.

@RealSaavedra @sadforjournos If Kavanaugh goes through you can bet Ford will be on 60 mins right before the election. R's will need to counter this. Maybe her?
@DonniciaP @SaraCarterDC @ChuckGrassley Heard NYT &amp; WP using Facebook to contact her classmates to find others. If that succeeds, confirmation is likely dead. 		If it fails, he'll be confirmed.	Then Ford will likely appear on news shows up to the election. Or a big hit on 60mins right before.
@NRO @AndrewCMcCarthy Both NYT &amp; WP have placed Facebook appeals to other women in the hope, more will come forward.	If that happens, Brett is dead.	If that doesn't happen, confirm will likely go through.	Then Ford will be the face of the D's on every show prob 60mins up to the election.
@rising_serpent @almostjingo The delay is the hope WaPo's &amp; NYT's fb broadcast to others in her class will bring more forward.		If that doesn't work Kavanaugh will be confirmed, then they'll use her on 60  mins right b4  the election. Or she hits the TV shows up to election.

@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 Take it for Libs to consider this to be Page as a Russian spy.  FISA totally excluded exculpatory evidence when Page wore a wire to help the FBI nab and actually convict a Russian spy.  Omitted evidence where Russian intel thought Page worthless.
@jleighton22 @aiglos78 @GeorgePapa19 That has been the media's take.  Actually there's much more that leads him to UK intel.  If he was a Russian spy, then both US and UK let him commingle with UK's top level Intel mgmt. 		https://t.co/Sv8m2G3yTB
@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 tic toc.	An operation to spy on an opposing campaign is significant enough to have likely made it's way all the way to the top.  Rice's unmasking abuse tells us it was in the WH.
@jleighton22 @aiglos78 @GeorgePapa19 Mifsud isn't Russian.  Downer isn't Russian, Halper isn't Russian.  All are likely western intelligence targeting George.   These meetings and their interest in George, who ordered them to do this must be revealed.  It was likely Brennan who initiated it, and Obama likely knew.
@aiglos78 @GeorgePapa19 Get your facts straight.   Even Downer admits the meeting brief and was not drunk.	LOL.  Obama spied, now they're in cover up &amp; damage control mode.
@SweetBudman @ChicagoStarkey @angela_cable @zannerina @GeorgePapa19 Stop wasting my time.  George P allegations have been proven false which is the primary Dem memo argument.  Obama used Intel to unjustly spy on an opposing campaign.

@nickthap @bradheath @ByronYork Indeed.  The partisan's that used spies (also known as sources) to infiltrate the Trump campaign with zero justification but DNC opposing research should be held to account for destroying our intel services.   Time to start over.
@bradheath @ByronYork When partisans in the FBI/Intel used sources to spy, it's not Trump but the bad actors that risked this in the first place.

@_UnitedEarth @MSignorile Kinda thought your eyes would glaze over when asked to look at the analysis. 	Liberal retards.
@_UnitedEarth @MSignorile If you look at the report, when they used census data was in line.  But they didn't use that data, they guessed at population &amp; guessed at the number of people that out-immigrated and didn't say how they came up with these numbers.
@_UnitedEarth @MSignorile Study was from 9/2017 to 2/2018.  Of course people died, but was the rate higher than prior dates in the past using same window.  They started with 2010 went forward 7 years, comparing each to above window.  All 7 years the guessed at the population given last census was 2010.
@_UnitedEarth @MSignorile Study is easily debunked.  Media spread a very weak piece of garbage.	No peer review, population before &amp; after based on guesses using 2010 census.  The study itself shows no change in death rate if census data is used.  Instead they made guesses to reach their number.
@peterbakernyt @sbg1 Did you say key? 	Only take note when it's "key senior".
@LuciusOpimius @bahiawilson @washingtonpost In this case, the mole fraction is the amount of man made CO2 contributed to the atmosphere which was, before man, very small to begin with 0.0003.	Man has contributed an addition 0.0001 to make the total 0.0004.	Media uses ppm (parts per million) which looks larger = 400 ppm

@lynnkosmakos1 @JamieBeaman @keithrhernandez @maddow Mandating people in shelters reduces the wasted resource for search and recovery, which can be applied toward supplying h20 and care.  If PR didn't evacuate, they exasperated the problem themselves.

@bahiawilson @washingtonpost The media has you worried about .0001 mole fraction increase in a trace gas which is not acting like predicted in the climates models.  Their alarmism has generated billions in wasted $ which will resolve itself on it's own, meanwhile millions starve.

@lynnkosmakos1 @JamieBeaman @keithrhernandez @maddow Keith laments his father's death.  Blames it on lack of response.  I'm wondering why his father wasn't evacuated to a safer place on the island.

@marciebp @jblalock08 @SamNBCBayArea @evanshumeyko @GCAS2018 That additional .0001 mole fraction of manmade CO2 is supposed to retain enough heat then target H20 molecules; heat them up enough to turn them into vapor &amp; cause the entire atmospheric column to get more humid.

@currentmscook @nytimes @Google You apparently haven't read it.
@AdamSerwer Imagine the media accusing Trump of killing PR's by pushing a study that hasn't been peer reviewed, and uses "models" and estimates to achieve their conclusions. 	@maggieNYT
@SteveWonderbelt @NPR Last census was 2010. Given the out-immigration caused by their financial problems, estimating a Sept 2017 beginning pop &amp; Feb 2018 ending pop would be very difficult to achieve accurately, IMHO.  If '17 pop was lower &amp; '18 out-imm adjusted pop higher, their entire calc is off.
@Ruiz04Sweet @MartinHeinrich Therein lies the debate.  The study has major flaws.  No peer review, no footnotes to source numbers used for population estimates.  Given population is millions and out-immigration varies wildly, any mortality estimate based bad pop estimates makes for vast changes in count.
@SteveWonderbelt @NPR I agree, it is the only study. However they estimate (pg 8) 3.33M before &amp; 3.05 after hurricane in their study window.  No footnotes to validate where these numbers came from, how estimate was derived, etc.  Any minor change in these numbers will impact their count significantly.
@TEK_0G @costareports Dems doing what they do best.  Hide behind the victims, blame it on someone else, assume the study is flawless.
@MartinHeinrich I'm sure you haven't read the study.  No peer review, no reference to how they reached population estimates before/after, 3 methods studied, only one actually presented.  Study is weak, very weak.  Stop hiding behind victims and assigning blame.
@costareports You realize the "study" the media is basing their attacks on has never been through peer review.  Major estimates of population size before/after contain zero footnotes/references as to how these numbers were derived.  This study has major flaws.
@Leetesgirl @peterbakernyt Oh, so now Feinstein conjures up an "anonymous" letter.  More rich.
@JonLemire Wondering if you actually read the report/study.  Any critical review would see the flaws in the analysis.
Have you read the study?  They make estimates of the before &amp; after population.	When dealing with millions, and bad estimates, their model becomes junk. https://t.co/TwklGjlT7R
@snichols11 @jaketapper What's not well is the media's uncritical review of the study.  The study is a model which makes major assumptions.  It's hardly infallible.  For example it ESTIMATES the before and after island population, which if wrong, make their model worthless.
@SatanicSF @nytimes You're still on twitter, so not everything.
@SteveWonderbelt @NPR The study is a model, not a body count.	Given the massive out-immigration created by the elimination of tax credits for companies that move to the island, it would not be surprising they underestimated the number that left the island in the years well before the hurricane hit.
@SenSchumer stop using the victims as your shield. 	This all started with Liberal in the Media attacking Trump. https://t.co/VeIWuCOvvR
@bradheath @ChuckRossDC Why did they call Feinstein but spy on Trump instead? Tell me the justification for the leaks?	Why did they have to lie during FISA?	Why did they leave out exculpatory info on Page?
@oufenix @maggieNYT @CahnEmily There are actions taken before and after a storm. FEMA is primarily a post event response.	If PR did not evacutate ppl effectively before, they make post event efforts more difficult.  This makes the job of PR Natl guard much harder.
@JakeSherman Do you know if PR had a mandatory evacuation, or the actions by PR before the hurricane hit and FEMA got involved, or are you simply trying to make political points?
@marthaleephelps @JeffMerkley @realDonaldTrump Based on the study results, they indicate elderly without access to power/water, etc.	Did PR have a mandatory evacuation?  If not why not?  If so, why did people decide to stay?  If people wanted out, what happened? All this could have been done b/f FEMA gets involved.

@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC be careful that using that emoji, as the Supreme Court Kavanaugh hearings told us, the Left think that is a white power, Nazi symbol.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC The argument. 		The Left and the NeverTrumper hate that he fights back.

The Left, the media, the NeverTrumper have revealed how ugly, petty, and disgusting they r.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC Biggest scam of all, our public universities, graduating ill equipped for jobs with few critical thinking skills. PC liberals with limited ability to think for themselves. That's an actual scam.

@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC So the DC elite ex-presidents club use a eulogy as a vehicle to criticize	Trump but he can't say anything other than reference 9/11 on 9/11 because it's 9/11?		Better warn Maggie, she's jumped off the 9/11 rail today, as have many other liberals in the media.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC My point exactly. Upset get rich quick dummies mad b/c they realized what they learned would still require effort.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC FBI needs to be attacked. Corrupt partisans leaked to media to vilify Page. They hid exculpatory evidence to spy. This was likely approved at the highest levels, including Obama, given they spied on the opposing campaign.  This is very troubling. This is the DC you're defending.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC You didn't get your refund?

@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT @JoeNBC Most ppl know NeverTrumper &amp; the Left within the DC elite hate the businessman outsider upsetting their cushy monopoly.

@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT Yep the leftist media @JoeNBC saying Trump is worse than the 9/11 radical islamic terrorists.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT And Maggie's tweets reveal the petty deceit.
@historBilia @mermtm @maggieNYT Don't kid yourself. She cloaked herself with 9/11, points to an innocous Trump tweet that had nothing to do with 9/11, insinuating he didn't care. 		Maggie's the queen of fabricating Trump outrage.

@Mikamouth @nprpolitics Let's hear the tapes. No one seriously doubts the majority of DC is against Trump, both NeverTrumpers &amp; the Left. Most of these career gov employees aren't used to an action/results oriented businessman.	Likewise Trump isn't used to keeping ppl around that don't produce.

RT @realDonaldTrump: I’m draining the Swamp, and the Swamp is trying to fight back. Don’t worry, we will win!
@jmclaughlinSAIS @Susan_Hennessey Yes of course. Key difference.	Intel saw something going with Feinstein, they warned her, she did nothing.	With Trump they didn't call, no warning, they launched a criminal investigation, tried to insert spies into his campaign, then leaked nasty rumors to perpetrate falsehoods.
@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike Have a nice day.
@NPR The media just might find out that Obama's penchant to spy on reporters, the Senate, and civilians most likely morphed into one of the greatest abuse of Intel resources; making Nixon's bugging of the DC DNC hq look like child's play.
@NPR And one must know that an against a person of this magnitude must have been approved only at the highest levels.  Has the media ever once questioned what President Obama's role was in ANY of this?		Nope.
@NPR When the FBI was caught using actual spy Halper to infiltrate the Trump campaign, after hiding this info for over a year, they said, "we're only trying to help".  Don't make me laugh.  How about a phone call to Trump?
@NPR To any normal person, they would be concerned to find out Ohr's wife was working for the Hillary/DNC funded Fusion GPS during this timeframe. But to the media it was hardly given any mention, or worse, accepted as "nothing to see here".
@NPR Meanwhile Steele was fired from the FBI, but Ohr kept up communications while Steele shilled for a Russian wanting a US visa.		But this didn't stop the Trump hating Strzok from sprinkling his bias across almost every aspect of this "investigation".
@NPR And what of these wiretaps? They found nothing. Their overzealous abuse of spying revealed Page was never a threat. But to the media, ho hum, keep pushing the Russia collusion narrative anyway.
@NPR They then blatantly lied on the FISA warrants to spy on one in his campaign, not once, but 3 times.	They purposely hid exculpatory evidence on Page that would have killed their spy op.
@NPR Not speak the blatant double std on the investigation. When a spy was discovered in Feinstein's org, did they launch a criminal investigation? No they called her, something they could have afforded to Trump as well. Instead they took a DNC oppo doc to spy on Trump.
@NPR Another anti-Trump screed from those that leaked rumors about Papadopolous wearing a wire that turned out to be a lie.		So many leaked Trump/Russia related innuendos published and amplified by gov to the media,  none of which happened, or exaggerated to feverous level. LOL.
@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike The reason the anthem was introduced in 1931 was to provide a way for those not drafted to show their respect to those that were. 	You might site other ways Vets are disrespected. Colin's actions just added another one; whether intensional or not.
@dvorakoelling @maggieNYT Obama actually spied on journalists, Trump's criticizing their overwhelmingly negative slant, both of which can be easily shown.
@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike Colin's donations are admirable; disrespecting the soldiers that gave the ultimate sacrifice is not.
@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike While it's unlikely the NFL folds anytime soon, the ratings will continue to fall. Owners will likely tie contracts with viewership. If players continue to bite the hand that feeds them, they'll also suffer the consequences for their actions.

They'll just move their money somewhere else. The players, the few that actually got an education will be fine. The vast majority won't. They all become like Colin, jobless.
@AndrewCMcCarthy @NRO Your article lambasts the DAJ and the SC. At the time you don't like Trump lambasting it.
@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike Year over year double digit declines in viewership are telling the real story. Politicizing the game has had a negative impact.
@michael1_1618 @RepAdamSchiff The FBI had months to interview Mifsud, which they did. Although they lied on the FISA, insinuating he was dead. It was the FBI that dragged their feet, then blamed a 28 yo kid. When Schiff speaks he's typically omitting key points, therefore lying.
@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike I didn't say that. I said the anthem has been played since the beginning. In fact playing it became std in 1931.  	https://t.co/Oj14mJc5cN

@mrstonyafaye @karavarus @UnscriptedIncom @Nike Anthem has been part of the game since the begining. Ppl have stood up every single game, in the pros, college, and high school since o there has been organized sports. 	Owners have offered to pay $ for whatever cause the kneelers prefer.
@zeynep @giacomonyt Everyday Germans are fed up with the immigration policy. The growth of this discontent is described by the left as far-right. But the left won't talk policy, instead call ppl names and accuse them of being whatever *ist or *obe fits the left's narrative.

@MarshallCohen @MaraLiasson Given all the pics which show Mifsud very cosy with top level Brit Intel, attending multiple Intel meetings, teaching in UK, western spy agencies are either complete imbeciles or your wrong; again.

@JLightbearer @nytimes @seanhannity Studies show public school abuse @ 10% or more. A 20 year review of PS abuse would expose millions abused. So you really don't care about victims. I get that.
@DidiB50920684 @ABC @AaronKatersky Given studies that show public school abuse is as high or higher than private, we would see numbers of abused on a scale making private a footnote.

@martinkroeger @ryanjreilly More troubling is the fact that Mueller, as FBI director, chose Lockheed Martin as prime contractor for 1 billion FBI project, just 1 year after Comey left the DOJ to earn 6million in one year as LM counsel.		Mueller has initiated investigation on Trump with far less.

@nprpolitics "Batted away" is liberal news speak for "defiantly refused to answer", if they posed the same question to a Republican.
@SenFeinstein Just tell us how you love that 70% of the abortions in NYC are from those that have 1,2,3, or more in the past.
@JaybeeStewee @brithume NeverTrumpers are those folks, like GW Bush, the "compassionate conservative", that let the media and the left destroy them without a fight.

@Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr A 30 minute meeting is not a conspiracy. Taking lies from a Russian, then Steele shilling for this Russian through emails to Ohr to grease the skids for a visa and Ohr's wife working for the D funded Fusion while her husband hid it, is a conspiracy.
@Good_Lt @bd_tbd @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump It's clear you've never read the actual dossier. 33 pages, the bulk of which is fluff crap we've heard before from other agencies. The rest is bullshit rumors given to idiot liberal Trump hater Steele by a Russian who wanted Steele to get him a US visa
@Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr The real outcome, it was the left that was stupid enough to actually collude with Russians and spread their lies.
@BeatThePress1 @Good_Lt @bd_tbd @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr They never mentioned emails.
@Good_Lt @bd_tbd @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump From your article		"As a whole, the Steele dossier now appears to be a murky mixture of authentic revelations and repurposed history, likely interspersed with snippets of fiction or disinformation, an Associated Press review."		33 pages, the bulk of which already known. LOL.
@Good_Lt @bd_tbd @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr He never hid it, unlike what you stated. Btw Fusion GPS was also in this meeting. If anything, it was a set up by Clinton paid operatives.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Halper is both a CIA and FBI asset. Surreptitiously offering "help" to the campaign, paying a Trump campaign volunteer to write and meet outside US to circumvent law while hiding the fact you work for these agencies is spying.
@Good_Lt @bd_tbd @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Actually Jr posted his entire email chain on twitter for everyone to see when this story hit.		Check out @DonaldJTrumpJr’s Tweet: https://t.co/M1BOY3WQjm

@FindYourJoy2 @GregCfollows @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Comrad? You still believe Russia stole the election from you.	Hilary and D's are like that. I think she's up to excuse #43 as to why she lost, but thought she was back to blaming white married women.
@bd_tbd @Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Only after it was exposed by the House. Then the Times carried water for the FBI. "Ok, we spied but only to 'protect' Trump".		What a load of crap.  Not when the FBI leaked, through the Post &amp; the Times, derogatory, accusatory, collusion related stories that been proven false.
@GregCfollows @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump They were never warned. Unless you can send me a link. Please prove it
@FindYourJoy2 @GregCfollows @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Facts? From the left that still thinks they lost the election b/c of Russia.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Stay focused. I never said that.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump What's your point? We now know Steele and the FBI were getting "dirt" from Russians for years. None of the Trump related dirt has been proven. And you can bet if ANY of it was true, it would have leaked by now. 		The D's along &amp; corrupt FBI partisans were the actually colluding.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump They were so fearful of Trump, they needed an insurance policy. That insurance policy was the SC.		That is wrong on so many levels.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump 1) they were spying, that has been proven. 	2) they have used the media to damage Trump by insinuating he was colluding.	3) they used it as an excuse in an attempt to delegitimize his election.	"The only reason he won was b/c Russian's helped him"	4) they lied in order get the SC
@bd_tbd @Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Purposely injected by CIA/FBI. Brennan and/or Comey could have called Trump if they were so concerned, like they extended to other ppl. But they actually thought he was a spy. They were wrong, now they must pay for the crap they put the country through.
@bd_tbd @Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump I've read the "we're spying just to protect him" excuse. Just doesn't match their other acts. They could have picked up the phone and warn Trump, like they did Clinton, like they did Feinstein, like they did for others. Nope. Too many corrupt partisan Trump haters. Dbl standard.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Great to see liberals think politically appointed partisans literally spying on citizens, denying it, using other individuals accounts to do it, then leaking as part of a lie, is now an ok thing. Obama's Achilles heal, paranoid abuse of spy powers...Reporters, the Senate, more.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump What's your love affair with Burr? B/c he's a corrupt NeverTrumper?	I can assure you the Democrats would be screaming corruption if the opposing party spied on them. Stop deluding yourself.
@AshaRangappa_ @brithume Asha has lost track of the facts. McCabe admitted the Steele doc was pivotal and FISA WOULD have never passed w/o it.
@RanOuttaFux2Giv @washingtonpost Show us the Beto DUI police report. You know... The one where he pulls a Teddy K, and tries to flee the scene.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump That point is Obama's weaponization of gov intel agencies to spy on his political enemies. His actions have destroyed any trust in these agencies. Laws were broken in the process, and ppl in gov should be indicted.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Flynn's name was leaked based on call with ru ambassador, of course insinuating collusion in run up to special counsel. It was certainly an Obama appointee that broke the law to do this.  Most likely Brennan or Rice, both of whom should be under indictment for such actions.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump But unmaskings under her name are well documented.	Burr might want to think someone else using Powers name or account to spy on American citizens is no big deal. He's wrong.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Never Trumper Burr is well aware of the massive increase in the rate and numbers of troubling, invasive unmasking requests performed during the election &amp; during the transition. Samantha Powers alone, 260+ documented unmaskings in 1 year alone. She said she didn't do it.
@Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Sorry to break it to you but a rash 100's of unmasking attempts were made including a large # from ppl like UN sec Powers had no business doing. We've just scraped the surface on the unmasking abuses of power.
@BeatThePress1 @bd_tbd @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump The crazed Obama hold overs from DOJ to State Dept, abused wiretap unmasking process by exposing names of Trump campaign members legally talking to foreign leaders. imagine the Bush team spying on the Obama transition then leaking it to the press. This is what Obama did to Trump.
@bd_tbd @BeatThePress1 @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump They tried to spy on Trump directly using FISA and got rejected. It's not like the subsequent FISA on Page was b/c he was some "random" guy. The rabid partisans in FBI wanted Trump, and broke almost every rule to spy on Page b/c they were so sure Trump colluded with Russia.
@Good_Lt @BeatThePress1 @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Patently false.
@Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Lol, Millions spent on Manafort not filling out his tax returns correctly. That's what audits are for, unless you're rabid, deranged, partisan Trump haters.
@BeatThePress1 @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Shortly after winning the election, Trump moved his hq and servers to NJ, based on warning NSA Adm Rodgers, (a man Obama wanted to fire but couldn't), that his servers were being monitored by Obama Intel agencies. So they did spy, and likely did so using misleading/false info.
@Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Ha ha. The rabid leftist Trump hating media have been insinuating Trump was involved in Hilary's emails for over a year. Meanwhile no evidence. Now growing evidence FBI have talking to Russia for the duration and they NEVER said Trump was involved. Sad.
@ryanfromga Page 5. You might be able to understand it.	https://t.co/zd2G5xc2Nb
@BeatThePress1 @Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump The FBI would not want a hearing. This would have opened the door to expose the primary source of Intel was Hilary Clinton's paid for campaign unvetted "dossier". Standards for evidence we're grossly violated, based on using it as their primary source.
@Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Lol, you need to face the facts . Liberals have been fed a constant diet of Trump/Russia by Trump hating media for over year. Now it's all falling apart as gov employees have exposed, FBI/DOJ purposely hide evidence that reveals their sins.
@Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Lol, libs want to blame Trump as a Russian spy for over a year now that say the FISA warrants had nothing to do with his campaign. Can't have both ways liberals. FBI kneejerk Trump hatred as proven by Strzok tests show your corruption.
@Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump FBI lied to the FISA court to avoid a hearing. They did everything they could to spy on the Trump campaign, including planting CIA operative Halper, and Brit asset Mifsud.
@Good_Lt @RarkimmPhd @DavidKris @brithume @realDonaldTrump Lol, you are hilarious. Before this, the leftists in media have been shouting out Page as a Trumpian Russian spy. Now that the FBI has been exposed, "we weren't spying on Page b/c of Trump."

The fact it did not further reveals troubling questions of FBI concealment, deception, and cover up.
@DavidKris OMG. Spying on a presidential candidate is not typical. If a reference to "candidate#1" won't trigger it, something is very wrong (corrupt) with the process.

@DavidAFrench I know the Church deserves severe criticism.  However studies show sexual abuse in public schools is at same rate or higher than private. 	Imagine a similar 20 year review of sex crimes but by pub schools.  The numbers would staggeringly dwarf what we're talking about today.

@AMTAppeals @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey There is currently a 300K+ backlog in asylum cases.   The number of asylum cases along the southern border has increased 700% in the last decade. Unscrupulous lawyers abuse the "credible fear" putting legitimate asylum seekers at risk.
@Cuauhtemoc_Mar @dburbach Imagine the scenario an undocumented alien with multiple juveniles; also undocumented.  DHS/Border agents release them and are later found as part of what is now a 32 billion human trafficking ring.
@TexasLibMama If an alien enters the US and has no documentation to verify either themselves or the child, it becomes a problem.  DHS must filter because human trafficking has become a major problem on the southern border.
@akchang @steve_vladeck @305Ufan @Susan_Hennessey Here's a link to the last failed vote. 60 required. 	https://t.co/aDd2Rxn7ze
@MelHazlewood1 @Susan_Hennessey @MEEPPSison I have but a tiny soapbox compared to the power Susan &amp; Steve.  My point is their message can be used to exasperate &amp; divide or used as a forum to acknowledge immigration's complexities &amp; propose reasonable solutions.
@steve_vladeck @akchang @305Ufan @Susan_Hennessey One must admit the prior administration's policy helped exasperate a large influx of children toward our border, whether intentional or not.  When one considers that human trafficking is now a 32 $B industry, suggesting other than "zero tolerance" is an invitation for abuse.
@akchang @305Ufan @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey At least 60 votes are required.  McConnell could possibly circumvent this using a simply majority like Reid did, however given the nature of immigration the Dems would likely scream about it.
@MelHazlewood1 @Susan_Hennessey @MEEPPSison Human trafficking is a 32 billion industry along the Southern border.  	That includes both women &amp; children.  Susan &amp; Steve would again mount their soapbox if a single child or woman were allowed in under the Trump admin and forced into a live as sex slave.
@WolfKJM @dburbach Part of the complication associated with juveniles traveling with illegal aliens is large scale human/child trafficking.  Border &amp; Homeland security is chartered to root out what has become a 32 Billion $ industry along the southern border.
@avengingmomgel @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey An asylum request has well defined criteria, which includes political, documented evidence of violence + other components.  Very few meet this criteria.  That's why when released most don't show up for their hearing.  They get all the help needed to scam the system.
@ChuckMunyon @NickSones @Susan_Hennessey Possibly.  If detention acts as a deterrent, it saves significantly.	An argument can be made that allowing things to proceed currently only invites more to use what has clearly become the asylum scam, costing even more.
@akchang @305Ufan @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey I believe it requires 60 votes for an immigration resolution through the senate.  R's don't have enough votes to pass.
@dburbach These are reactions to the currently broken system. Not solutions.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey You're right Cap. We're not going to agree. 	Only ask that you meter Steve &amp; Susan's statements with a healthy bit of skepticism.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Totally honest here.  Sessions is using separation to deter 1000's from abusing the asylum loophole.  Steve &amp; Susan are pulling on your "heartstrings" to promote more people abusing the system.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Session's actions are to deter further immigration.  Susan &amp; Steve exaggerate the situation in order to PROMOTE more illegal immigration.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey President Obama spoke publicly re: his prosecutorial priorities.  This action, whether purposeful or not, caused a huge influx of immigrant youths; unaccompanied by parents, which required housing and disposition. The centers were built to address this.
@AMTAppeals @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Lying about it is.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Just as many children, possibly more,  were held in these centers while Mr. Obama was president.  That's when they were built.  Did Steve &amp; Susan happen to mention this?	No.	They want you/us to be polarized.
@NickSones @Susan_Hennessey While Susan might have genuine concern over these children, her rhetoric only divides and exasperates the problem. 	I would ask her to take a step back and provide real solutions to our broken immigration system.  However I fear she's more interesting in exaggeration.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Actually I was referring to Steve &amp; Susan.  They're pretty smart &amp; they know they're exaggerating the situation. 	DHS is chartered to find a relative for them. 	Given the 1000's pouring over the border it places stress on the system.
@EtWegg @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Steve &amp; Susan are very intelligent individuals.  They understand that the immigration system is broken.  Their hyperbole brings us no closer to finding solutions to the problem.  They know this foments anger. This tells me they want immigration as an election issue.
@305Ufan @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey It's no joke that it requires Dem votes to pass in the Senate.  President Trump offered a very good option that tripled the number of Dreamers than President Obama's proposal.  The Dems just rejected it without a counter offer. 		Dems want to use this an election issue.
@dburbach Most of what you mentioned aren't solutions, but responses to a currently broken system.
@dburbach This is being done.  DHS is placing with relatives or other guardians.
@LLSL9801 @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey I haven't seen any reports of this.  	Susan works for @CNN.	I'm sure she'd jump all over this, since she seems intent on creating division instead of solutions.
@TheRealNumber6 @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Using phrases like miserable means that Susan and Steve have got you to emotionalize a problem that requires substantive options and suggestions.  Their efforts prove they aren't looking for solutions, just conjuring up hysteria.
@combienDUtemps @LynEpar @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Using loaded terms like "ripped" &amp; traumatized means the Left has successfully enlisted you as one more solder in their campaign to NOT find a solution to the immigration issue.  The D's aren't offering solutions, suggestions or options, just hyperbole.  You're being duped.
@305Ufan @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey The Democrats don't want to work toward a solution.	So they get their base worked up into a hysterical fit by creating gross exaggerations.	You've taken the bait.
@TheRealNumber6 @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Your exaggeration is noted.  You've bought into the hysteria.
@LLSL9801 @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey DHS is chartered to find a trusted relative.  The children aren't indefinitely detained.  I'm afraid our politicians would rather exaggerate than look for a real solution.
@CapShower @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey 1 - This is the crux of the immigration debate.  The asylum issue is abused, intelligent people know it, and using a broken element of immigration as an excuse doesn't bring us any closer to a solution.	2 - Yes.  DHS runs these places and each child is placed with a relative.
@combienDUtemps @LynEpar @steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Right.  A poor kid who's never seen a big screen tv and an xbox is "traumatized".
@steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey 1 - How can intelligent media individuals such as yourself keep up with this "asylum" canard? 	2 - These "prison camps" as media is currently using, is more like a dormitory, xboxes, tvs, toys, jungle gyms.  	3 - The media is purposely distorting this to make political point.
@jbendery @GlennKesslerWP An adult commits a crime accompanied with their child.  	Adult is arrested.	Child is separated from the adult.	Police find relative or responsible guardian		It's standard procedure idiot media.
@1Common_Tater @maggieNYT Anyone who is arrested for any other crime with their child is separated and the child is protected until a relative or guardian can be found.	BTW: Maggie, was your senior management aware of the bribes to corrupt FBI/DOJ employees?  Did your paper participate?  Who?
@steve_vladeck @Susan_Hennessey Tell me Steve, Susan; If someone stole a car and they had their child with them, what would the police do with the child if the perpetrator is caught?
@cathleendecker @GlennKesslerWP Detention centers for minors widely used by Obama. 	BTW:  What gifts and bribes did your paper give to corrupt FBI/DOJ employees?
@Schwartz6419 @ktumulty @daretothink53 @michaelscherer @jdawsey1 Any parent that commits a crime when they have their child with them, is separated. 		WaPo: tell us about the bribes you gave out to corrupt FBI/DOJ staff.  Who? what? When? Why?  You know democracy dies in darkness.

@econgirl5 @Julie_C_Smith @GOP Hey #Democrats, if a parent broke the law (like steal a car) with a child in tow, the child would be separated until a responsible relative or guardian could be found.
@GlennKesslerWP California has the highest poverty rate in the country.  Higher incomes in CA don't come close to matching the higher cost of living there.  Point to Democrat policies Glenn.
@DeborahHealy_ @nytimes In an era when Di Nero "bravely" uttered his words on national television, there is absolutely no way he was fired because of Trump cartoons.
@VitruvianMonkey @washingtonpost If someone stole a car (or other crime), with child in tow, the child will be with the police until they find a responsible relative to take custody.  The same thing is happening in regards to people who illegally cross the border.
@RonaldVMillerJr @SangerNYT @maggieNYT You actually think Trump is going to break up NATO?  Wow.
@VitruvianMonkey @washingtonpost It's more like a resort than a prison camp, Monkey. X-Boxes, large screen TV's, toys, etc. Stop the exaggeration Monkey.
@VitruvianMonkey @washingtonpost When anyone is arrested, you can't take your child with you.
@VitruvianMonkey @washingtonpost Wondering why?  Because we're talking about the LAW.
@joshscampbell @yashar @maggieNYT Ali Ali All come free.  Tell us about all the bribes your company paid out to DOJ/FBI staff and the leaks that resulted from these liberal partisans subverting our government.
@DevlinBarrett @maggieNYT Why do you prioritize this over homeless veterans who are actual citizens?	BTW: could you please send us a list of the bribes you and Maggie paid out to DOJ/FBI personnel, and a summary of the leaks you received as a result of this?
@jbarro @GlennKesslerWP Maybe Glenn can get fast to work documenting all the bribes his paper paid out to the partisan leftist FBI personnel instead of retweeting this.
@LikeinBatman @maggieNYT Poor Josh stuffs a sandwich in his mouth in order to tweet his enduring love for illegals while homeless veterans languish.  Nice to see how liberals suck up to illegals.
@Susan_Hennessey Maybe you can bleach bit Peter Strzok's text "I will stop (Trump)", and Mueller's lawyer pronouncing "Viva La Resistance".
@RonaldVMillerJr @SangerNYT @maggieNYT Ha ha. Biased, partisan hysterics think Putin will break up NATO.  You're all Peter Strzok.		IG regarding Peter Strzok's actions: "antithetical to the core values of the FBI and DOJ."
@MitchKimball2 @joshgerstein Good job to the "journalists" that ignore Strzok saying "I will stop him"
@tweetMalena @SenFeinstein Pretty sure these liberal leaders are experiencing the impact of policies they've implemented all by themselves.  Meanwhile CA has highest poverty rate in the nation while she pleads for illegals.  Dianne cares more about illegals than citizens. Sad &amp; sick.
@Janx53 @SenFeinstein @BonhoefferLives Dianne and the other liberals care more about criminal aliens than homeless veterans.  Illegals, that all they talk about.  Let that sink in.
@DaveWeasel @SethMacFarlane Seth wishes @realDonaldTrump would give him a nickname. 	Not worth the effort.
@hepular @maggieNYT When an American breaks the law, he or she is separated from their children.  Leftists need a reality check.
@dkellyChi @JTSantucci @ABC Stunned b/c Mueller's chasing a 13 y/o case in desperate hope that his 49 days with Trump resulted in Russia "collusion".  LOL 	Dry well Mueller.  Mueller's team actually looking very weak.
@TrendyIdentity @GregShugar @nytimes ha ha from the party that still thinks the Russians stole the election.
@Fahrenthold @realDonaldTrump Nice spin David.  You're so biased, if Trump had ppl working in the foundation, you and the rest of the biased media &amp; partisan NY attorneys would be accusing him of spending too much on staff instead of delivering $ to charities.
@nytopinion Peter Strzok: I will get Trump.	The entire Mueller effort is poisoned.
@GregShugar @nytimes Mueller using months of dirty Strzok's tainted, biased, and likely fraudulent work  trying to destroy Trump's presidency.  Too bad liberals.  Mueller's pack of partisans has been exposed.
@ConstProg @Susan_Hennessey Libs and their Trump derangement - continues.
@dgpereira @nprpolitics It's abundantly clear dirty, biased Peter Strzok rushed the exoneration of Clinton to start the attack to get Trump, create the "insurance" policy, and frame Flynn even if it took lying to FISA judges to do it.  		Very sad to the level of partisan bias within DOJ.
@SotoPopsicle @carlye666 @DarrylKing74 @NPR It's clear climate models are over heated.  They require more water vapor in atmosphere caused by elevated CO2, in order to reach the temps they project.  Decades of observations show specific humidity is not increasing.  Sorry, but science has proven alarmist theory is false.
@FelisDave @AdamSchiffCA Yes please run.  Trump will destroy him.
@Kelly27400271 @bradheath Trump didn't know where this guy was standing.  He interviewed him for the FBI job and instead decided to target Trump as Special Council, which we now know was based solely on biased, dirty Peter Strzok's attempt to take Trump down. It proves Mueller's a Never Trumper.

@SotoPopsicle @carlye666 @DarrylKing74 @NPR Greenland's under ice canyon wouldn't allow total loss.  Ice mass on land lowers it's sea level.  If ice were to melt, which is highly unlikely, ground mass with rise in response to the ice mass loss previously retained on land.  Studies show ancient forest on floor of Greenland.

@SotoPopsicle @carlye666 @DarrylKing74 @NPR CO2 only absorbs and re-radiates infrared wavelengths.  Long wave.  The Oceans are very poor absorbers of infra red.  Try taking a Walmart infra red heater and use it to warm your bathtub.  Get back to in a decade for the update.
@carlye666 @DarrylKing74 @NPR The mass of CO2 in the atmosphere is just too small to make any meaningful impact.  It comprises just .0004 mole fraction, with .0001 being "mans" contribution. If a basketball arena with 10K seats were our atmosphere, 1 seat would be man's contribution.
@carlye666 @DarrylKing74 @NPR I look at the data.  The data is clear.  NPR is funded by environmentalist organizations to project fear.  That's what they've done for over a decade.

@LjollyRenay @SenFeinstein States want the option to roll their own solution, not one mandated by the Feds. Unfortunately California is so deeply in debt and mismanaged  by Democrats they won't be able to do it, even though their economy is larger than most EU countries that have universal care.

@Susan_Hennessey We've pretty much grown tired of the Cliton/Comey/Obama spying on Trump/Russia as well.  Mueller "investigation" has turned on you.  You're a joke.  The Democrats are a joke.  Time to indict the spies.
@TeagueWilliam @ShineonJMB @hunterzzz @nytimes You're free to provide a reason why Fusion GPS was at this meeting.
@ShineonJMB @hunterzzz @nytimes The extreme liberal media, which NYT is a part of, has repeatedly pushed a false story line about this meeting since it was likely staged by a contractor in attendance at the meeting while simultaneously working for Hillary Clinton campaign; Fusion GPS.
@washingtonpost @JRubinBlogger It's liberal Trump derangement that has proven particularly irrational since Trump's inauguration.
@Susan_Hennessey Leftists know that the term "narrowly" when referred to SCOTUS decisions is overwhelmingly used to describe the vote.  The fact most of MSM media used it to describe how the ruling was applied seems is disingenuous at minimum. 		So please continue your smug attempts a mockery.
@DaveWeasel @FreeBearly @SethMacFarlane Suppose you were a baker and someone wanted you to bake a cake depicting a school shooting with a cake shaped like a AR-15.  Or bake a cake that looked like a penis.  Anyone should be able to refuse these requests regardless the "religion" question.
@DaveWeasel @SethMacFarlane That's not what SCOTUS decided.  Gays can purchase a pre-made cake but not force the baker to create a specific one.  They weren't prohibited from shopping at bakery, it was forcing the baker to create a specific one to their liking.
@DaveWeasel @SethMacFarlane If Dave &amp; Seth were sued b/c they refused to tell jokes someone else demanded they hear, they'd first in line to defend their freedoms; along with a smug, condescending self-righteous attitude to go along with it.
@RobynForZen @washingtonpost It's about time we subpoena @Comey Clapper, Obama, Yates, Ohr, Brennan, Page, Strzok, Rice, Powers and all the others that colluded to spy on Trump; which is the core of this bogus Mueller investigation to begin with.
@washingtonpost The entire "investigation" is rife with abuse of power by the Administrative Spy state.
@GlennKesslerWP Glenn triggered by a response to a purposely misleading headline.
@AndrewABranch @SusanMizrahi @washingtonpost WP knows most only read the headline.
@davidi_williams @Tlong112068 @AndrewCMcCarthy @brithume Decades of abusing core industry to cheap outsourced product caused this.  It appears people are addicted to it, scared of a temp price increase, willing to cave, once again at the expense of the average worker, while media carries the water for other countries.  How patriotic.
@davidi_williams @Tlong112068 @AndrewCMcCarthy @brithume I agree that tariffs are generally not the way to go.  But you are fundamentally ignoring the fact that foreign countries are imposing tariffs and duties on US goods to protect "their" interests.  You seem all to willing to accept that for the sake of the status quo.
@davidi_williams @Tlong112068 @AndrewCMcCarthy @brithume A 20% tariff leaves quite a bit of room for the US companies to compete.  If foreign companies are 20% less than the US I'd begin to think they're dumping.
@davidi_williams @Tlong112068 @AndrewCMcCarthy @brithume You presume people will continue to purchase these products.  If US suppliers deliver at a lower cost, imports w/ tariffs go down. Most impose tariff on US goods through the VAT (value added tax) Competitors from other countries aren't required to pay this in the US.
@MarshallCohen @JaySekulow @PressSec Tell us why Mifsud hasn't been indicted by Mueller.  B/c he isn't a Russian spy.  He's a UK spy that spike the Russia dirt story.
@maggieNYT @GStephanopoulos @peterbakernyt Funny how the liberal media think this is some kind of thing, and could care less that Fusion GPS, who was working with Hillary at the time, likely staged this entirely meaningless meeting.
@davidi_williams @Tlong112068 @AndrewCMcCarthy @brithume McCarthy has been spot on re: Trump/Russia.  	I don't think he has the depth in trade.  Is anyone aware that Mexico imposes restrictions or tariffs on many products including beef, apples, soy oil, liquid  caustic soda, hydrogen peroxide,  bond paper, welded carbon steel pipe...
@chuckgraef @AshleyRParker Are you speaking of the meeting that was gas-lit by Fusion GPS, who was at the time working for the Hillary campaign?  Is it that meeting?  Liberals don't know it but your fake "investigation" is so dead.  Obama spying on an opposing campaign?  Disgusting.
@KristenBlush @washingtonpost A gif of Obama being glib, smug, dismissive.  	Add that to the reasons Trump won.
@carrieksada @THEsaragilbert @therealroseanne @ChristieC733 @LeahR77 @steph93065 @michaelbeatty3 @SandraTXAS @LVNancy @bowhunter_va @_IamAnita_D @KNP2BP @5945USARTR Sara is no one without @therealroseanne
@KristenBlush @washingtonpost IRS targets conservatives - check	spied on reporters - check	spied on senate computers - check	created failed state Libya - check	ran guns to ISIS - check	spied on opposing campaign - check	created worse refugee crisis in decades in Syria - check
@annafifield @giacomonyt It's nice we have twitter to see the underlying political beliefs exposed by our supposed "objective" news "reporters".
@KristenBlush @washingtonpost 8 years of smugness with a complicit media.	8 years of a president who illegally opened borders	8 years of a president that made the middle east worse off than before	8 years of president that used gov agencies to target US citizens he disagreed with.	8 years of that A-hole
@BeWittyOrSmart @washingtonpost Thank Terry McAuliffe's blanket pardon.
@JRubinBlogger @matthewamiller Most Americans see it for what it is.  #WitchHunt	Go have a drink with your liberal friends in your liberal bubble.
@nytopinion Trump/Russia was an Obama era abuse of power.  That's what you should be writing about. B/c everything that has occurred after Obama's abuses are fruit from a poisonous tree; that includes Flynn, Manafort, Cohen, George P. ...
@tomcoates @mkraju Obama targeted Dinesh b/c he was a well off immigrant and didn't fall in line Baracks' his radical ideology.  Just like the IRS.  There were over 100K campaign violations in NY state during the time of his conviction.  That was over a 2 year period.
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost @Comey Top Obama EPA officials used private emails to communicate with enviro lobbyists in effort to hide collusion.  Lisa Jackson forced to resign after being caught. 	https://t.co/K9OXDXVczP
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost @Comey I thought the same re: Obama environmental extremism.  https://t.co/uFSFmqmeQw
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost @Comey You're exaggerating re: Pruitt.  Typical Leftist yarn.	https://t.co/fvecBEcy20
@KamalaHarris VJ still clinging to her 25% black DNA.  What a joke.
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost @Comey I get my news from multiple sources.  That's why it's so easy to see WP spinning a story politically. Each side has their position.  When WP does it, they "say" they're objective.  Nope.  Just an extreme leftist organ populated by leftists, most with an agenda.
@svdate @kaitlancollins Obama EPA spent	$92,000,000 on furniture 	79K moving expenses for one office.	1M for a Natl Geo program on Lake Champlain.	141+k to Chinese to study pig poop.	$160,000,000 just on PR campaigns	$261K on badges 	$17K on toys	$23.8k on awards/trophies	35% more contracts than Bush.
@OverUnderClover @timkmak Just another publicly funded liberal journalist that wants to be in the news instead of reporting it; by exaggerating and using words like "threat" so his slavish readers think he was in some way "harmed".
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost @Comey Wrong on both counts.  WP has proven not trustworthy.  They are a CIA stenographer, in part for fear of losing a "source".  They purposely ruined the career of a fellow reporter (Gary Webb) to kill the drugs for arms story.  Not as widely "read" as you say you are.
@peterbakernyt What happened to Brexit, May?
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost @Comey While not disputing your numbers, Trump staff pay is roughly $ 5 Mil less per year than Obama. I'd be happy to expound on other areas we can fight over where BHO spent more or vice versa.  The point is WP does not expose D extravagance.  WP is targeting EPA guy they want out.
@washingtonpost You've forgotten to add the millions the DOJ/FBI likely spent prior to Mueller, to spy on Trump; plus the value of good-will lost by FBI/DOJ to launch such a ridiculous scheme, and the future liabilities of suits brought by Trump/others against this abuse of government power.
@jendlouhyhc You're too young to remember that all prior presidents both R &amp; D going back decades, viewed coal as strategic toward our nations energy security.  Except Barack Obama.  @maggieNYT
@OyVeyMaMa @washingtonpost McCabe spent 70K on a conference table under Loretta Lynch/@comey.  I'm old enough to remember when that seemed to be important when Ben Carson spent less.  		Selective outrage WP.  Call it out, but be consistent, not selective.  It exposes your partisan paper for what it is.
@erikstrobl @washingtonpost If only there were a modicum of actual objectivity.  Supposedly a person who's 25% at most black &amp; hardly looks it is now full on black &amp; leftist media takes offense when mentioned as part a movie series that leftists should have called "racist" from the beginning if consistent.
@ewtvc15 @AnnaBordelon84 @TBSNetwork If leftists were actually concerned about "racism" they would have been criticizing the entire Planet of the Apes series; from the beginning.  VJ mother was white, her father was born from black and white parents.  This makes VJ less than 1/3 black.
@ahah1127 @AriFleischer If people were actually "sensitive" about racism, the entire "planet of the apes" series would fit the Left's narrative of "racism".  Many people had no idea VJ was "black".
@fivecrazybills @AdamSchiffCA Yes #LieGate.  Obama DOJ &amp; FBI lied to FISA judge re: Trump/Russia collusion using DNC oppo "research".
@ashleyrichards @washingtonpost You're out of the loop.  Media drops bomb on Barr, while they let Kimmel and others spew their drivel for over a year.
@AdamSchiffCA I have some bad news for you Mr. Schiff.  Obama infiltrated Trump campaign, abused powers, used UK &amp; US spies to spike a fake Trump/Russia collusion story.   Mueller "investigation" hopelessly tainted.
@mtracey @Aliquickk At time of his conviction, NPR reported NY state had over 100K campaign violations, in 2 years. 	Of course he was targeted.  Obama had a pattern of doing this (IRS, Senate spying, reporter spying...) 	https://t.co/zj1rR3Dfal
