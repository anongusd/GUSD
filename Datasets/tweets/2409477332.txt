@MariaBartiromo https://t.co/LYsZuMXzNs Best show. Nunes knows all, refer him to your HR. Adviser on your reveal documentary for FOX Nation. Border Wall is the most basic concern. Trump makes progress-drugs and gangs steal half of that progress. Certain safety is a precious thing
Tom Homan https://t.co/489YhSRcIU  We know the most basic need on the Mexican border is a WALL, along the entire length. My bond plan, done in sequence, accessing the investor pools I know of, can't be stopped by the courts.	Contact me for minute details. Need the whole picture.

@IvankaTrump Please, Ivanka, Go to a men's wardrobe store and buy your husband a few suits. I don't mean this in a unkind way. I sincerely would like to see him in a fitted suit of a heavier material so the wrinkles don't show. And also a 2 button one, adds to his stature. Wishing youall well

@NikkiHaley Hi Nikki, In short, we are soul/personalities with minds and bodies. Otherwise the combination doesn't work. Those who voted for infanticide deny their soul. They think to direct their minds to benefit their bodies, bodies die, minds disperse. Then reckoning occurs, woe to them.
@FLOTUS https://t.co/489YhSRcIU A popular mantra is: border wall/Feds/bad.	Little general notice is given to border states efforts, or the commercial side of the border wall. It's-don't look=will go away.	It will never go away. Closer scrutiny=a solution.	We need more known facts

@KenPaxtonTX Regarding my previous tweet about walls. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU I seem to recall that the Commerce Clause of the Constitution sat aside a swath of land along any border to be forever under singular control of the Govt. You might have a person research that. Simpler.

@Johnny_Joey For real--at an Xmas party last night I won a mat with THE phrase on it. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Told a person later the words were used since caveman days, except for the line "Baby, there's a mastadon outside." Some things never change. Moral life is good, not living life, not!
@Ocasio2018 Hi Alexandria, Don't fool yourself into thinking everyone is as capable as you. That will fail. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU What won't fail is you making your followers more like you. You can't wish them into your mold. There's a science behind what you need to do. Callme
@IngrahamAngle I smell burning Chinese brakes. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU They have realized the free ride is over. The Chinese should come to Beaver County PA, directly west of PHG and see what they have accomplished by their steel dumping, an economic moonscape. But it's coming back despite all.
@The_Trump_Train Hi, To me, there's a deep set wisdom in your words that you may not totally realize. The point is, why would you, me, anyone, listen to a liberal past their first word. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU There seems to be a receptivity in some that want to argue the case of our right tolive
@Ocasio2018 Hi Alexandria, The secret is a word, "POOL". The insurance you get as a member of Congress is based on a pool of healthy people, so it's cheap. Medicare is based on a pool of half dead people so it's expensive. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU That's the difference. Call we can sort itout

@The_Trump_Train PA is electronic, short of canvasing voters after election day, no control exists. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU If we had a paper ballot, ran through a sight reader for quick tabulation, the stored ballots would be the control, numbered, with the number in a sign-out log to a name etc

@Ocasio2018 @cindyhydesmith In the heights of extreme joy, the mind goes away. Let this be a caution to both of you. Keep the mind engaged at all times.

@realDonaldTrump The Russian language--which was created by Germans, seems to not allow the higher reasoning needed for peaceful interaction on a national level. From where I sit, there will be a war, soon, Putin has discounted NATO and the USA as a counter force. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Careful!

@charliekirk11 It's again economics, Charlie. Look at how Soros accumulated his billions. By sewing discord and collecting money on short selling whether it be stocks securities, or currency. I'm told Putin has a warrant out for his arrest. His absence wouldn't alter his directives @petetalking

@Lrihendry And hypnotized her, as brought forth by Judge Jeannine last night. Such might be of benefit in a purely clinical setting, but it's not accepted in a court of law. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Personally, I'm sure she didn't do it for money, about a million so far. @petetalking Look.

@michellemalkin Hi, Well thought out words on the Judge's show tonight. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU The tragedy of the worst order is Brett's children. They didn't deserve to have their childhood cut so short, especially the 10 year old. My daughter was 10 at one point. Lots are 10.
@JudgeJeanine Hi, Good show, except for Chris, is he really employed? https://t.co/489YhSRcIU There is another scene beyond your hypnosis conjecture but we won't go there now. I'm praying that Brett makes it through. If not, we'll have to create a new class of walking wounded to describe him.
@ARmastrangelo Hi, Should have known she wasn't a person off the street. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU I guess we can add the Capital Police to the Soro's crowd, also. The protesters weren't supposed to be anywhere near that part of the building. Someone told them to stand down. Damn, who is with us?
@annakooiman @FoxNews @foxandfriends Hi, Glad to have seen you again, You do your job well. Seems like you've matured since you were last on Fox. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Join a Tai Chi class, it will help your belly muscles, knit you back together again. Backstroke swimming might help, also. Sure envy you summer.+++
@MZHemingway Oh, No, not you, too. That's called cynical. Calls for another drink. Maybe that's why Brett drinks so much. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU I feel like I know the fellow. Sure a lot of 'counterintention' in my life, also. Wait, maybe I won the Powerball. Have to send this to check later
@KristySwansonXO Hi Kristy. I'm reading it so the snag must have cleared. Does that happen often? I write a lot of tweets but they seem to go away to the 'ether'. I must look at my tweet history again to see if they land there. If not, I guess... https://t.co/489YhSRcIU About veteran's housing.
@MZHemingway Not unless she has a female companion with her. Get any rest last night? Going to be a wilder week than last, you'll see. Keep a clear head Look at Palo Alto, family connections. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Check your sources, send me the latest suicide rates for veterans, please.
This is getting DEEP. You all connect the dots. @petetalking https://t.co/Z9w9c0ooUw

@FoxNews @POTUS Please, don't forget to mention the veterans. Especially the ones who end their lives too soon. More could be done for them. My plan https://t.co/489YhSRcIU envisions a secluded housing area near any VA hospital, details in site. Enjoy yourself. W VA needs you. I'm 100 miles N.

@MZHemingway You didn't say what. I would have joined you. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU If @senatemajldr doesn't know what he's doing, we're lost. The vote can't happen before next Tuesday, Senate rules. Don't deal him out. You have maintained a reasonable middle ground through this episode,Thanks
@PeteHegseth Hi Pete, Truth is an inward conviction. The more we slam the Dems the more they dig in. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU The best is to acknowledge them and move on. Don't burn energy arguing, do positive things in your own sphere of influence. Like thanking a veteran, thanks. Keep on.
@dbongino Can't do it before Tuesday as per Senate rules. What happens then is the question. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU We should send thank you notes to @BrettKavanaugh and tell him we have his back. Please retweet this down your line, Dan. I'm sure he needs to know he has many cheering fans
@KrisParonto @CNN Hi Kris, There's an adage here "Those who can't participate in "X", destroy "X" to prove they didn't want to be involved. (Can't be a soldier=destroy soldiers.) https://t.co/489YhSRcIU (Can't realize the finer points of manners= act like a slob) ETC. It's not a thinking response.
@RealCandaceO That's a well thought out video. I imagine it's going out every which way possible. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU I recently learned that the veteran's suicide rate is 45 per day, and five are on active duty (on average). If you have fresher data get back to me. Please retweet
@KatiePavlich Reality is in the mind of the beholder PLUS you have to transfer that reality to the mind of others. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Prof Ford's reality is only in her mind. Judge K's reality is in many minds. So, he carries the day. That's all there is to it. Thoughts have persistence.
@greta Hi Greta, I caught most of the hearing. There's no doubt that Dr Ford has her scenario fixed in her mind. However that's the only place where it exists. I wish her well with her continued treatments. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Evidence is with @BrettKavanaugh Political points yet ?!
@pahubb43 @buchen_patricia I'm in the wrong business. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU For real. That's amazing. Words fail me...
@BuckSexton Hi, You're so right. No woman wants her husband and sons to be at the mercy of any stray accusation. Just consider a wife who has sacrificed for her husband, and now he is fired and blackballed for no evidence. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU We should close ranks behind Judge Kavanaugh
@BrettKavanaugh Hi, Watched most of the hearing today. Prof Ford needs help.	https://t.co/489YhSRcIU I don't have much of a house, but you and your family would be safe here, and I extend an open door to you and yours. You have helped the country to come a bit away from the cliff
@guypbenson You're not saying that there is premeditation involved, are you? This is not happening in and of itself? https://t.co/489YhSRcIU  https://t.co/9Ka8C4olpn  comparing the present to my flights of fancy shows surprising likeness. Oh, boy. Should I write another book detailing it all
@KatiePavlich Now, Now, Katie, you are developing a suspicious mind. Buck Sexton sent a tweet to voice his thought that the whole mess might be coordinated, and I had to ignore the writer in me to think that plot might not fly. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Would take mucho$. Who has that amount of$
@FloridaResiden1 @MZHemingway Hi Molly, Buck Sexton tweeted that he had questions about coordination. It boggles the mind but that might be a explanation. It would take a lot of planning to cover the whole nominee list but someone with money to burn could. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Sure hope it's not true.
@BuckSexton Hi Buck, I think #2 is the answer. When you consider how much coordination would have to take place it boggles the mind. Then you consider how much coordination to cover the whole nominee list you are at staggering levels of planning. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Say it ain't so.
@marygauthier_ Hi, Read the Stripes article. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Housing area for veterans. petetalking@comcast.net I'm very interested in this subject. Do you have further data? If so, please share it with me. These suicide deaths are so avoidable with intervention, which is not happening.
@nikkiwentling Hi, Just read your report in the Stripes. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU It's an idea for a housing area for veterans near a VA hospital. See what you think. petetalking@comcast.net best for responses. Why did the VA cut off the statistics at age 34? Were they afraid?
@dbongino Hi, In a perfect world the question would be, "Who the Hell cares what X media outlet says about one?" Why is that not the question today? Do they control so much of a celebrity's life? https://t.co/KUvSa6r0d5 Does one need their permission to prosper? Like minds gather together.
@AndrewCMcCarthy Hi, I appreciate your commentary on FOX. You make the smoke clear when you define situations.  https://t.co/489YhSRcIU  It sure is a well planned ambush that is taking place, Brett K. I fear we've not seen the bottom yet. Is there a law against such conduct?

@marcorubio Evidently Kim doesn't think the President is serious. The crux of the situation is the citizens of Seoul in bomb shelters. If it can be done in twenty minutes, we can take out most of the military, missiles/artillery/ships with minimum loss of life. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@GovMikeHuckabee Must have gotten them from Iran via the cash cow airlift. Seems like the place could stand a rebuild, Donald could do it later as a public service job. If he could reproduce the Roman cement he'd 10X his billions. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU DC sure a cluster. Dems may have bought it

@cornwall_003 Hi, Reminds me of Jamaica, from long ago. Walls are too low to shelter anything from any strong storm. May have been a movie prop. Area too small for any Man-of-War. May have been a loading area for an old plantation. I can see kegs of rum, you?  https://t.co/489YhSRcIU

@JudgeJeanine @realDonaldTrump Nice outfit, you present yourself well. The 'middle of the roaders often escape mention' though we are the country. The problem lies getting us out to vote.

@SarahPalinUSA Hi, Short memories, during wartime, like now, the right to not be put on a lie detector is gone. Whoever sold Trump that idea? Takes a w/h memo. Which popularity contest is in question? https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast.net A time to cast ambiguity away.
@KatiePavlich Yeah, what took him so long. Another 1,000 seat loss will seal the next ten. He has his posse, outside that, I think, not much. Ask Kellyanne, polls can slant lots of ways, and he might show up there, but ask the ones who don't have phones in the M. Delta. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU

@ShannonBream Yeah, right. I hope the Billings gig won't interfere with your airtime. Best thing Pres @realDonaldTrump could do was to go out 7 days a week and blame it on the NYT. Can you arrange that? Oh, sure you can, counting on you. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast.net

@ShannonBream Don't know if you have children, mine are in their 50s. Feinstein glosses over a fact. There need not be death tolls, and still the marvel of creation could be guarded. But to the far left abortion is the immediate, only, answer. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU Do you see the gray area?

@AndrewPollackFL @Cernovich I'll tell you why, Andrew, spines aside. No police force in the USA trains enough for the officers to be confident with their weapons. Most shoot once a year. I was in security. I out shot every policeman on the range because I practiced weekly. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@CondoleezzaRice Hi, saw you at the hearings today. I always looked forward to Dr Krautheimer's words, just unusual enough to stimulate the mind. The hearing circus will go on, he will be voted up to the court. Travesty otherwise. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast.net
@GovMikeHuckabee Hi, You know better than most where the bodies are buried. Question is, "Who has Session sold out to?" Or "What are they paying him with?" Or "What is he being threatened with?" Nobody makes a sharp a turn as he has for reasonableness. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast
@GovMikeHuckabee Hi, It's a slow motion insurrection. From within we are being pecked away at. The intent is, wear us downto stupidity. There's no reason to discern. So, we grow more fingers to stick into the dike and hope for Nov. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast.net
@realDonaldTrump Hi, You know the actors better than anyone. There's no explanation for the justice dept's dissolution between 2016 and now. There must be a hidden reason. Are you aware of it, do you think you can keep it under control until Nov? It's all very hazy to me. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@AnnCoulter Hi Ann, I admire the grace with which you present your view points. It's a thing rarely seen. No sense of telling protesters, they are pre-programmed, beyond any input being heard. No 'Robert's Rules of Order' here. Just paid people doing their jobs. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@RealCandaceO Hi, You are almost on to something. The more basic procedure is to create a better thing, and then, create it again, then, in another space of time, create it yet again, etc. Do you see the minute difference between our approaches? https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast.net

@ShannonBream Hi @ShannonBream , I question the benefit children get from being exposed to harsh emotions. I suppose once won't cause them to wither inside, but constant exposure causes them to withdraw inside. I imagine we can both personally attest to that. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@charliekirk11 The bill for extra security will be high, but worth any cost. He should be told that his supporters are many more in number. I would imagine his resolve grows thin at times, whose wouldn't, but you tell him to not be of faint heart, we're with him. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@KatiePavlich hi @KatiePavlich Their tantrums will tell us something, whether we have the steadfastness to let anger flow away unanswered. If we waver, if our leaders don't stand solid we are done. Our enemies haven't wavered in their intention. How did the shooting go? https://t.co/489YhSRcIU
@charliekirk11 They didn't dare open their minds for a moment. Some shred of humanness might have flared up and made them smile for a second. We bemoan foreign mindsets for their closed minds, while we have our own closed minds of the same caliber. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU petetalking@comcast.ne

@realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Hi, Same thing happened in Rhodesia. Whites got out with their bindlebag. Subsistence farming doesn't feed a population.

@realDonaldTrump Was raised on a farm in the 40s-storm coming, make hay-storm sure tomorrow, make more hay today. You need an 'expediator' -make more hay than now. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU  petetalking@comcast.net @petetalking keep on going, no looking back.
@DLoesch There are a lot of people between NY@CA who are still human. We must take solace with them and ignore the 'coastals'. We are on the right course. History will thank us for staying behind President Trump. It's now or never for the USA. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU

@ShannonBream Splendid program tonight. Such sorrow about Mollie, wasn't expected by me. I imagine you keep safe. Thinking Baghdad, should put you in the right frame of mind. There's a magazine called "Concealed Carry"Google it. Has lots of safety tips. https://t.co/489YhSRcIU

@charliekirk11 2% surcharge on $ transfers going south will build a wall. Takes only a note from Treasury. Do they have the courage? @petetalking

@KellyannePolls Hi, We used to call it "couth". This woman doesn't have any. She may be responding to the current flow of society but pushing the norm further down into the mud shouldn't be something which one gets paid for. https://t.co/489YhSzBkk @petetalking
@KellyannePolls Hi, Sometimes it's useful for a person in such a disorientated state to ask them, "What have you lost?" The question activates a mental search, then the effect of the drug might be overcame. This is an attack on our civilians, an act of war. Odd why we ignore that. @petetalking
@realDonaldTrump Hi, Staying the course. That you should testify, under any terms, is just not profitable. The questions aren't to search for facts, rather to trap you. You're no fool, don't humor anyone and play the fool for them. No profit. @petetalking  petetalking@comcast.net

@CathyMankin1 Hi @CathyMankin1 You should have started the next book long since. See  https://t.co/9Ka8C4olpn . Before I lost my editor, wife passed on, I used 3 months to finish a 100,000 word novel, out the door to Kindle. https://t.co/UKCxFkuCsz petetalking@comcast.net write, we'll trade.
@KellyannePolls Hi, Perhaps all is not lost. We extrapolate the singers life and see many possible dead ends, that might bring sorrow. We've survived so far, he might, also. Problem is there, that modern life doesn't harden children. See bio https://t.co/XUb4IRMHsw   petetalking@comcast.net

@realDonaldTrump Hi, Please stay the course on the clearances issue. When no longer on the job, people go out into the world and change. They are notthe person who was employed. If data is needed it can be done on a case basis. Cancel all clearances from non workers.@petetalking
@KatiePavlich You have the exact point about security clearances. Job done=clearance done. Any information can be asked for without clearances. Contract work needs a new clearance, despite time. https://t.co/XUb4IRMHsw tells that I know the whole dance. Keep on. @petetalking

@RealCandaceO Got my attention. Seriously, the only way to shut the border, well there's the East German way, is to line up a bunch of tanks, every half mile, and put an Infantry Division between the tanks. Declare Martial Law zone ten miles wide, along the border. Done. @petetalking
@KatiePavlich Hi @KatiePavlich  The Monument has quite a history related to the building of it. You can find it in the Library of Congress. It's worth knowing. The street layout of DC is part of that picture. Enjoy and learn. @petetalking  latest web site https://t.co/XUb4IRMHsw
@ShannonBream Hi, You do not have a book. To complete your 'picture' you need a book. Possible title "Me, and the US Supreme Court" I think you have the 'altitude' to pull that off. With me as your ghost writer/assistant the book would be a hit. See mine https://t.co/9Ka8C4olpn
@charliekirk11 Hi @charliekirk11 The more relevant question is,"Why do women present themselves to clinics?" Answer is HATRED . Lessen that and fewer abortions will occur. How? That's beyond the Twitter world. petetalking@comcast.net @petetalking
