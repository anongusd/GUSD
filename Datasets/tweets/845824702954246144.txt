Bismarck on national top 10 list for income inequality https://t.co/tZmIgW3jIC
Income Inequality - via @inequalityorghttps://inequality.org/facts/income-inequality/
Between 1979 and 2007, household income increased 275 percent for the wealthiest 1 percent of households. It rose 65 percent for the top fifth. The bottom fifth only increased 18 percent.
The real issue is income inequality. Think about it.
Productivity has increased at a relatively consistent rate since 1948. But the wages of American workers have not, since the 1970s, kept up with this rising productivity.
What is the cause of the polarization in our society? Income inequality and greed. The one percent are greedy. We are expecting a middle class lifestyle and we are not getting it.
