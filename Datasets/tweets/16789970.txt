Landra and I offer our condolences to the Bush family and join the country in mourning President Bush‚Äôs passing.
President Bush was one of the finest leaders I‚Äôve had the privilege of knowing and working with. He was both pragmatic and gracious. I will never forget the handwritten letters he wrote me when I did something he deemed worthy of a few generous words.
We came from different parties and disagreed politically, but there was never any doubt that President Bush stood for what he thought was right ‚Äì even if it cost him politically. He will be remembered as a man who valued principle over ideology.
President George H.W. Bush was the embodiment of a leader and a statesman. He came to office as one of the most qualified people ever elected President and, above all, he was among the most decent. He was kind, generous and determined to do the right thing for his country.
John and I both ended our final call a few weeks ago by telling each other, ‚ÄòI love you,‚Äô and that was how we felt about one another. There will never be another John McCain. Landra and I join the country in mourning his passing and offer our condolences to Cindy and his family.
John McCain was a war hero, a strong, independent fighter and my friend. Our country lost an iconic leader today, and I will miss him terribly.

Some Republicans are threatening to shut down government unless we agree to take away health care from women. We're not going to do that.
Every day we waste trying to figure out what Republicans want to do is time we should be spending on how we're going to fund the government.
There is no need for the Republican Leader to continue wasting the Senate's time. Let's debate #IranDeal and then vote on final passage.

In 1987, Mitch McConnell introduced a constitutional amendment to regulate unlimited campaign contributions. http://t.co/pojZtIhd53
If money equals free speech, how could working Americans afford to make their voices heard? Most Americans can't compete with billionaires.
Years ago, Senator McConnell said we needed to ‚Äúkeep wealthy individuals from buying office.‚Äù I agree.  https://t.co/lnpTaVYuyH
We can argue forever about whose billionaires are right ‚Äì or, we can work together to get this shady money out of our democracy.

Today we saw a clear contrast: Democrats are working to fix and improve the Affordable Care Act, while Republicans want to go backwards.
As Janet Yellen showed today, she is eminently qualified to be Fed Chair. Her nomination deserves speedy confirmation.
Cooperation has been very lacking here in the Senate. Case in point: One senator is delaying action on an uncontroversial medications bill.

We retain the right to change the rules if necessary. But this is a new day in the Senate, and I hope we‚Äôll be able to work together.
There must be a new normal in the Senate. We should process and vote on qualified executive nominees in a timely manner.

I applaud @GovSandoval for supporting tax increase  for #ClarkCounty cops &amp; expanding Medicaid to 78k Nevadans #nvlegspeech
As NV emerges from difficult times, it's crucial we renew investments in  the future -in education public safety &amp; clean energy #nvlegspeech
Did you know #NV teens that go to college are less likely than peers to study STEM fields? I will discuss ways to improve at #nvleg speech.
At my #nvleg address I will discuss these solar panels on road to #Searchlight as ex. of NV's clean energy potential http://t.co/Oc0URsjZ
We believe we should replace this harsh austerity with a balanced approach that targets wasteful spending and tax loopholes. Americans agree
But our efforts will mean little unless #Congress acts immediately to deal with #sequestration budget cuts taking effect next month
We are ready to work w/GOP to support manufacturers &amp; building the best schools, modern roads/bridges
Last night, the President outlined an agenda calling for common-sense investments in our future to restore core value of fairness
My statement on the President‚Äôs fifth State of the Union address: http://t.co/a4STVBJ3 #SOTU
House Rs should make #VAWA a priority and pass it without delay. ~160 million American women are waiting to see action on this proposal.
Today, the Senate stood up for women across the country by reauthorizing Violence Against Women Act #VAWA with strong bipartisan majority
If Rs agree that these cuts would be damaging to our #economy and #nationalsecurity, they should work with us to pass an alternative.
A balanced approach of sensible spending reductions w/ modest contributions from the wealthiest would prevent damage of so-called sequester
President Obama will also propose a balanced alternative to the devastating, automatic spending cuts set to take effect next month.
Tonight President Obama will chart a course to maintain economic progress we‚Äôve made and revive a still-struggling #middleclass.
I wish everyone in Nevada and across the nation celebrating the #ChineseNewYear a year of health, peace, and joy.
Introducing bill to let retired members of @ArmedForces w/service-related disability receive compensation http://t.co/jmlBrUmG
Thanks to the Hispanic Task Force for leading such a thoughtful conversation on #immigration reform.I‚Äôm committed to #Senate action #AskHTF
There‚Äôs bipartisan agreement that creating a roadmap for citizenship for the 11M undocumented people in the U.S. is a smart solution #AskHTF
No matter what side of the aisle you're on, we can agree our #immigration system‚Äôs broken. Follow today's discussion on reform, w/#AskHTF
Looking forward to talking w/the Hispanic Task Force shortly about #immigration reform that‚Äôs needed for our country #AskHTF
I hope the Senate‚Äôs bipartisan action this week will send a strong message to the House GOP: further partisan delay is unacceptable #VAWA
Letting partisan delays put women‚Äôs lives at risk's shameful.More than 1/3 of women have been victims of violence,sexual assault or stalking
On including revenues, I stressed: I've got a pretty good fan base for that: The American people #ThisWeek
@GStephanopoulos asked, should future budget deals include revenues? I said, "yes, the answer is definitely yes" #ThisWeek
Deficit reduction: I stressed Americans "are on our side..We  should fill those tax loopholes, get rid of them..that's where we need to go"
I also said that under #Immigration reform, gay couples with kids "should be protected just like any other child"
On #Immigration reform, I told #ThisWeek:It's going to pass the Senate. It would be a bad day for US &amp; for GOP if they cont. standing in way
I added:"I've seen the DREAMers come to me &amp; explain to me, 'We are  Americans. We know no other country.' My heart says we have to do this"
This AM on #ThisWeek, I said immigration reform "has to get done. The  American people are past excuses. They want this legislation passed"
I wish the best of luck to @Kaepernick7, one of Nevada's great football players. Everyone in the @NevadaWolfPack will be behind him Sunday
For #BlackHistoryMonth, we celebrate our diversity. I am inspired by those who help break down barriers to create possibilities for all
Now is the time to fix our broken immigration system. I am personally committed to resolving this issue: http://t.co/zOKR1YW9
@GStephanopoulos, @ThisWeekABC, looking forward: RT @ThisWeekABC Exclusive: @GStephanopoulos interviews @SenatorReid on #ThisWeek Sunday
Sen. Kerry will be greatly missed in Senate, but no one's better qualified to continue Sec. Clinton's exceptional work http://t.co/GpivWxzP
It‚Äôs simply not fair that any woman working the same hours in the same job should make less money than her male co-worker #PaycheckFairness
#PaycheckFairness also bars retaliation against workers who discuss salary,&amp; supports fair compensation for victims of gender-based inequity
#PaycheckFairness empowers women to negotiate equal pay, incentivizes employers to obey laws,provides stronger tools to fight discrimination
The Fair Pay Act narrowed the pay gap, but hasn‚Äôt closed it. That‚Äôs why @SenatorBarb authored the Paycheck Fairness Act last Congress
The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed into law 4 years ago today, was the best step to ensure equal pay for equal work since 1963
#Immigration reform‚Äôs good for immigrant families and our economy. It can‚Äôt be piecemeal &amp; must include a path to citizenship #Latism
As a senator from NV, I‚Äôve witnessed the difficulties our immigration system presents immigrant families &amp; will do all I can to see it fixed
With bipartisan support building in Congress &amp; a President eager to see #immigration reform, I hope we pass comprehensive reform soon
I fully support the work of Senators who have set partisanship aside to propose a framework for comprehensive #immigration reform #Latism
@SenatorHarkin's a pillar of the Senate,nation's been shaped in countless ways by his work.I'll miss him when he leaves http://t.co/Yo8MsoYs

Great news for NV's tourism industry and ~370,000 jobs it supports in S.NV -  39.7 million people visited Las Vegas in '12, a new record
Democrats will hold fast to the guiding principle that a strong middle class is key to the nation‚Äôs success &amp; stand for balance and fairness
Today w/the inspiration of the presidential inauguration in our minds, we renew our effort to fulfill the promise of prosperity for everyone

Pres. Obama made an outstanding choice in nominating Jack Lew: few people understand our economy &amp; how govt. affects it, better
I applaud Pres. Obama for thoughtful choices to head the Pentagon &amp; CIA &amp; trust they'll get a fair confirmation process http://t.co/5ntca7gc
Democratic Steering Committee has approved updated committee assignments for Democratic senators in the 113th Congress: http://t.co/vhOaObyB
First crucial business in 113th Congress is addressing overdue aid to #Sandy victims. Also intend to let important rules discussion continue
Unfortunately, there were some bipartisan bills the House never acted on: Postal reform, VAWA, the farm bill &amp; aid for victims of #Sandy
Political divisions of 112th Cong. were sharp but we passed important bills ie the transp. jobs bill &amp; prevented tax hike on 98% of families
As Congress debates best way to strengthen our economy &amp; reduce our deficit, Democrats will stand strong for the principle of balance
Confident new senators will serve our nation w/distinction. Urging them to draw on each other‚Äôs experiences ‚Äì regardless of party ID
I look forward to welcoming @SenatorKirk back to Capitol Hill today
Dismayed House adjourned w/o approving aid needed by victims of Hurricane #Sandy. It‚Äôs unacceptable to ignore victims of natural disaster
Welcome Brian Schatz to the U.S. Senate as Hawaii‚Äôs new senator http://t.co/6EvmEvrh
@SpeakerBoehner should take the escape hatch we‚Äôve left him, and put the economic fate of the nation ahead of his Speakership
The way to avoid the 'fiscal cliff' has been in the face of GOP leaders for months - taking up the Senate-passed mid.-class tax cut bill
I wish everyone in Nevada and across the country a very merry Christmas. May this holiday be memorable for everyone
Few people are as qualified as Sen. Kerry to represent our nat‚Äôl interests abroad. I expect a prompt, fair confirmation http://t.co/QIfFlfLi
Prez. Obama‚Äôs thoughtful nomination of Sen. Kerry for Secretary of State means we will have an experienced hand as our nation‚Äôs top diplomat
@SpeakerBoehner must return to the negotiating table ready to compromise ‚Äì the only way to avoid devastating impacts http://t.co/05wy2Jd7
There will be very serious consequences for millions of families if Congress fails to act
It‚Äôs time for the House Speaker to protect the middle class &amp; vote on the Senate-passed tax cut for 98% of families ‚Äì it will pass the House
My friend Sen. Inouye was a hero, a brave soldier and a wonderful senator http://t.co/tBViJHu0
In the coming days &amp; weeks we‚Äôll engage in meaningful conversation &amp; debate about how to change laws &amp; culture that allow violence to grow
We have no greater responsibility than keeping children safe. Every idea should be on the table as we discuss how best to do that #Newtown
Part of the healing process will require Congress to examine what can be done to prevent more tragedies like the ones in Newtown, CT
My heart goes out to all those affected by Friday‚Äôs massacre. And my thoughts cont. to lie w/all those of Sandy Hook Elementary #Newtown
Yet House Republicans are holding middle-class tax cuts hostage w/o asking the wealthy to pay a little more. This isn't right #My2K
Over 75% of Americans support asking top 2% to pay a little more to avoid 'cliff,' including 61% of Republicans http://t.co/gDc4SHPj #My2k
Committee assignments for 113th Congress have been approved by @SenateDems Steering Committee http://t.co/ljXt0zA3

Congratulations to the first 10 Nevadans chosen to attend the Presidential Inauguration on January 21st http://t.co/J6iSsifA
@SpeakerBoehner could end the suspense w/1 vote.  Democrats agree w/Sen. Corker, who is 1 more Republican urging a House vote #My2K
That‚Äôs why House must take up Senate-passed mid.-class tax cut bill, which provides security for families, businesses making &lt;$250,000 #My2K
After more good economic news, the last thing we can afford is another crisis manufactured by Republicans in Congress
Nevadans, I hope you will be watching @MannyPaquaio v. Juan Manuel Marquez, too http://t.co/TicPD2pI
I wish all celebrating Hanukkah a Chag Sameach. In nights ahead, may the candles you light shine as brightly as our future
Looking forward to watching my friend @MannyPacquiao against Juan Manuel Marquez tonight. I know it will be a great fight #Vegas
If Republicans refuse to take these steps, they show they are more interested in appeasing Tea Party than protecting middle class
To further move our economy, House must pass Senate's middle-class tax cut bill &amp; Sen. McConnell allow up-or-down vote to raise debt ceiling
While too many continue to struggle, there's no doubt our economy is moving in the right direction
Pleased that LA Mayor @villaraigosa signed agreement to power ~118,000 CA homes with clean solar energy produced in NV http://t.co/rcp17LxB
Republicans have the same problem as the @nyjets. Who is their quarterback?
How long will @SpeakerBoehner make middle class families wait for relief &amp; force the financial markets to wait for certainty? #My2K
Democrats have said for more than 4 months: time for the House to approve middle-class tax cuts as the Senate did http://t.co/9VfAXP1q #My2K
We must give certainty to middle-class families now. All the House has to do is take up the Senate-passed, middle-class tax cut bill #My2K
Those are the same Republicans w/whom Democrats are supposed to find agreement to protect mid.-class families from a Jan. 1 tax increase
But for insight into why negotiations have been tough, consider the failure of the disabilities treaty at the hands of the Tea Party #CRPD
I share the frustration of Americans lamenting the lack of progress in negotiations to avoid a massive tax increase on mid.-class families
GOP arguments against the treaty had no basis in fact: it doesn't change U.S. law. I plan to bring #CRPD up for a vote in the next Cong.
#CPRD vote was about standing up for men &amp; women who risked their lives on the battlefield, &amp; 57M Americans who live w/a disability
Republicans such as @SenJohnMccain &amp; former Sen. Bob Dole called on their GOP colleagues to support veterans #CRPD
It's a sad day when we can't pass a treaty that brings the world up to the U.S. standard for protecting people w/disabilities #CRPD
Not only does Speaker Boehner's proposal delay revenues into 2013,it sets up another destructive fight over debt ceiling 1st thing next year
Democrats are willing to compromise, but any agreement must protect the middle class
To protect the middle class while reducing the deficit, simple math dictates that tax rates must rise on the top 2% of taxpayers next year
Raising taxes on the middle class is bad policy and flunks the test of balance
To protect millionaires, Speaker Boehner‚Äôs offer would force middle class families to pay higher taxes
@Clairecmc said of @SpeakerBoehner on Sun.,‚ÄúHe's got to decide, is his speakership more important or is the country more important?‚Äù
Republicans must realize: as we work toward a final agreement, millions of mid.-class families are nervously watching &amp; waiting #fiscalcliff
It's Republicans‚Äô responsibility to respond w/a counter-offer #fiscalcliff
Our proposal's clear: we want to end unnecessary tax breaks for the richest Americans &amp; security for everyone making &lt;$250,000 #fiscalcliff
Nevadans: be alert, heed advice of first responders and stay safe. Follow @rgj @KTVN @KOLO8 @KRNV for latest news
I spoke with federal &amp; local officials about #truckeeflood today. I am closely monitoring the situation &amp; asked FEMA to watch it closely
A favorite Mark Twain quote about Lake Tahoe on his birthday: "I thought it must surely be the fairest picture the whole earth affords"
We can argue over whether to give more wasteful handouts to the wealthy tomorrow, but let's take care of the middle class today
Republicans are calling on House GOP leaders: Rep. Scott said if House took our bill to prevent mid.-class tax hikes, it would surely pass
Yet reasonable Republicans are coming around to what Democrats want: let‚Äôs reassure the mid. class their taxes won‚Äôt go up by $2,200 on 1/1
House Republicans have held the middle class hostage to protect the richest 2% of taxpayers for far too long
The treaty won't cost us a dime or require any changes to existing US law &amp; has the support of veterans &amp; disabilities groups #CRPD
The Disabilities Convention before the Senate will help people w/disabilities ‚Äì in any country- live the full, productive lives they deserve
Today I met with Mexican Pres.-Elect Enrique Pe√±a Nieto @EPN. We agreed on importance of continuing to work together https://t.co/nPLzwE6d
As we approach the fiscal cliff, Democrats are ready to make tough choices. I hope my Republican friends can say the same
Republicans must turn happy talk into action - give economic certainty to the middle class &amp; ask wealthiest to pay a little more
Cong. could act today to give middle-class families the economic certainty they need. A single vote in the House would get the job done
Today, I hope Nevadans decide to ‚Äúthink small,‚Äù support local merchants, shop owners, &amp; entrepreneurs #SmallBizSat
Small biz is the backbone of NV‚Äôs economy; it helps drive innovation in the US &amp; strengthen the middle class #SmallBizSat
#Thanksgiving is also a time to thank those who protect our country &amp; defend our freedom: @USArmy, @USNavy, @USMC, @USAirforce &amp; @USCG

I welcome Sen.-elect King's decision to caucus w/Democrats, where we have a tradition of independent voices‚Äìfrom Sens. Sanders to Lieberman
I urge any Republicans considering the strategy of obstruction to turn away from divisions of the past &amp; join us in cooperation &amp; compromise
Conservative Bill Kristol said this week, ‚ÄúIt won't kill the country if we raise taxes a little bit on millionaires" https://t.co/cLrpYX4y
We could avert fiscal cliff for 98% of families, 97% of small biz -if House would pass bill freezing tax rates for those making &lt; $250k/year
Americans need more jobs, economic certainty, opportunity &amp; fairness.  It is within our power as a Congress to quickly address these needs
Congratulations to NL Rookie of the Year and fellow Nevadan Bryce Harper. Great player, great team. Looking forward to 2013!
As we honor veterans today, we must remember the countless individuals who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country #VeteransDay

I'll be on @60Minutes tonight, along w/Sen. McConnell. Tune in at 7:30pm ET/7pm PT on CBS
The American people expect us to put politics aside and do the right thing for middle-class families, and they deserve nothing less
I hope Republicans will re-evaluate their strategy, stop trying to appease the Tea Party, and reach across the aisle to get things done
This recovery would be even stronger if Republicans had decided to work with Democrats, instead of obstructing at every turn
Today‚Äôs job #s show Pres. Obama‚Äôs policies are moving our economy fwd, creating more jobs than expected in Oct. &amp; 5M+ over the past 32 mo.

It‚Äôs time for Republicans to put politics aside, and put the middle class first
We could move faster if Republicans dropped obstruction, yet Sen. McConnell said his ‚Äòsingle most important‚Äô goal was defeating Pres. Obama
There are still far too many people looking for work, but the policies advanced by Pres. Obama &amp; Democrats are helping move our economy fwd
We still have a lot of work to do, but w/unemployment dropping below 8% to the lowest level in 4 years, our economy's on the right track
Pres. Clinton @ClintonTweet, Sec. Salazar @Interior, Pres. &amp; CEO Podesta @AmProg &amp; others discussed path to energy independence

Last week I spoke w/SI‚Äôs @MelAntonen on #Nats, @Bharper3407 &amp; read NV baseball stories from my book http://t.co/f1j3NAOr
He says he wants to be president for only half the people but he acts like he only cares for the top two percent
When will the American people see the returns he filed before he was running for president?
That raises the question: What else in those returns has Romney manipulated?
The information released today by Mitt Romney reveals he manipulated 1 of the only 2 yrs of tax returns he's seen fit to show the country
For Democrats, #HHM is about recognizing important contributions, &amp; about bldg a brighter future for Hispanic Americans http://t.co/ztGL5mIg
Yet Mitt Romney opposes the common-sense policies that help Hispanics &amp; Republicans have been paying lip service to Hispanic concerns #HHM
Recovery Act kept 2M+ Hispanics out of poverty, tax credits helped 8M+ Hispanic families, we fought for 1000s of Hispanic sm. biz loans #HHM
President Obama &amp; congressional Democrats have fought hard for policies that are making Hispanic families stronger, more prosperous #HHM
This month, I join 52M+ Latinos in NV &amp; nationwide to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, honoring important contributions to our nation #HHM
This rare look at the real Mitt Romney proves one thing: He's completely out of touch with average Americans http://t.co/wPsAK4XN
Many of the #47Percent pay other taxes: state income, payroll, property &amp; sales taxes. But in Mitt Romney's view, that's still not enough
They're retirees who paid into Social Security, parents struggling to put food on table, Americans w/disabilities, soldiers serving overseas
Yet the #47Percent are ordinary, hardworking Americans that deserve respect, and they pay a slew of other taxes
We've learned Mitt Romney only wants to be president of 1/2 the US: he wouldn't waste time worrying about the #47Percent he views as victims
I wish everyone a peaceful year filled with happiness on this Rosh Hashanah. L‚Äôshanah tova. http://t.co/hFn0joV9

We'll never forget the 1000s of innocent people who died in NY, PA, &amp; across the river here in VA #911Day

Republicans refuse to adopt balanced approach to deficit reduction, putting millionaires ahead of mid.-class &amp; military http://t.co/XgMJeOzI
Dems &amp; Republicans passed Budget Control Act, which put sequestration in place; disappointed Republicans visiting NV have forgotten this
Democrats' balanced approach to deficit reduction combines smart spending cuts w/asking millionaires &amp; billionaires to pay their fair share
Americans will have a clear choice: Romney-Ryan plan to gut Social Security/Medicare, or the Dems' balanced approach to deficit reduction
Romney's choice demonstrate that catering to the Tea Party and the far-right is more important to him than standing up for the middle class
By picking Rep. Paul Ryan, Gov. Romney has doubled down on his commitment to gut Social Security &amp; end Medicare as we know it

50 miles north of Las Vegas, particulates &amp; coal ash rain down from the Reid-Gardner coal-fired power plant on Moapa Paiute Indians.
Every decision we make - large &amp; small - matters. But every choice has benefits - or consequences. #NCES5
Extreme weather events are common now. A 38-year veteran of the utility industry noted that we see a "storm of the century" every year.
There are still members of Congress resisting clean energy's American success story. Sadly, they're sending industries &amp; jobs overseas.
I opened Clean Energy Summit #NCES5 noting that we must reduce reliance on fossil fuels - for the environment, economy &amp; national security.
I'd like to welcome everyone to Las Vegas for the National Clean Energy Summit #NCES5. Watch live all day at http://t.co/xl3ivMCc
Congrats to @gwaddelltv8 on 32 yrs at @8NewsNow You have been a trusted source of news for Nevada and you will be missed.
Today, the most secretive presidential candidate since Richard Nixon is coming to Nevada: http://t.co/VJwZsf0w
Democrats will not give up trying to protect our national security, and we will continue working to solve this vital issue for our nation
Yet Republicans recklessly obstructed #cybersecurity legislation, filibustering  w/irrelevant, political amendments that cater to Tea Party
A cyber-attack from anywhere in world could cause widespread blackouts throughout our nation or target safeguards at nuclear power plants
Nat'l security experts recognize the imminent threat of cyber-attack by our adversaries against our nation‚Äôs critical infrastructure
There's no time to waste, as the Iranian regime keeps threatening our ally Israel and U.S. national security
As Iran defies the internat'l community w/it's nuclear weapons program, we must tighten our sanctions regime
Pleased the Senate has passed Iran sanctions legislation
Today, as important health services become free of co-pay/deductible, Republicans renew war on women. Op-ed: http://t.co/rJ3kfcan #HerHealth
Ending ins. co. discrimination will help millions more women afford care they need, &amp; restore basic fairness to the health system #HerHealth
But starting tomorrow, new ins. plans must cover contraception &amp; many other preventive health services for women w/o add'l co-pay #HerHealth
Today, women of reproductive age spend 2/3+ out of their pockets for health costs than men, largely due to cost of contraception #HerHealth

Most Americans agree taxes should remain low for the middle class &amp; that the top 2% should pay their fair share to reduce the deficit
Yet Republicans are filibustering this proposal to protect the middle class because they know it would pass on an up-or-down, majority vote
Democrats have a plan to prevent 114M middle class families from seeing their taxes rise by $1000 next year #MiddleClassTaxCuts
@Astrid_NV and I talk about the importance of passing #DREAMAct after our meeting yesterday: http://t.co/angis33D
Today, @SenatorDurbin told his 50th DREAM story‚Äìthe DREAMers come from every corner of the US &amp; their stories are here http://t.co/5dDJguag

My heart goes out to his loved ones, to the victims &amp; their families as they struggle to make sense of the senselessness

Sen. McConnell has said he wants to debate serious legislation. He can urge Republicans to drop their filibuster http://t.co/h8BpJ3Vl
Republicans' obstructionism isn't surprising: Their nominee for president made a fortune working for a co. that shipped jobs overseas
The #BringJobsHome Act would end tax incentives for companies that outsource. Yet Rs must end their filibuster for us to begin debating it
130,000+ workers in Nevada have jobs at risk of being outsourced. And 300,000+ jobs in the state of Kentucky are also at risk #BringJobsHome
Over the last decade, U.S. companies outsourced almost 2.5M jobs, often to countries where they can hire workers for half the price
Send me your Qs on clean energy w/#AskReidNCES for my town hall, happening 2 weeks before the Nat'l Clean Energy Summit http://t.co/N0mUNSU7
We will discuss our clean energy future. Tweet Q's you have on clean energy w/hashtag #AskReidNCES&amp; for more info: http://t.co/HYcvSzUm
Pleased to announce: Ahead of Nat‚Äôl Clean Energy Summit, I'll host Twitter Town Hall w/ @amprog Chair John Podesta on 7/25 @ 4pmET
It's time Republicans stopped blocking a bill that ends outsourcing. Bringing jobs back to the country's good for the economy #BringJobsHome
That's why the Senate's considering the Bring Jobs Home Act. Yet Republicans are filibustering this bill that will bring jobs back to the US
American taxpayers shouldn't subsidize the outsourcing of jobs overseas. But that's what's happening across the country
Today, Republicans will have an opportunity to reconsider that backwards priority &amp; stand up for the average voter instead #DISCLOSE
Safeguarding transparent elections used to be an area where we found common ground: 14 Rs in Senate today voted for disclosure laws in 2000
Yet last night, every 1 of my Republican colleagues voted to block the DISCLOSE Act,a bill that would ensure disclosure of campaign spending
We owe it to voters to let them judge for themselves the attacks and motivation behind secretive spending #DISCLOSE
In the post-Citizens United world, the least we can do is require groups spending millions on political attack ads to disclose their donors
Republicans have clearly decided that secrecy is more important to them than being straight with the American people #DISCLOSE
Democrats sought to require large political donors to disclose their identities so voters could judge their motivations #DISCLOSE
Senate Rs today showed their top priority's protecting anonymous billionaires, giving them an outsized advantage over reg. American voters
And as my friend, Mitch McConnell once said: ‚ÄúDisclosure is the best disinfectant‚Äù http://t.co/LGNTxchF
Disclosure can only strengthen our democracy. Thomas Jefferson famously argued that democracy depends on an informed electorate
The #DISCLOSE Act will require disclosure of donations exceeding $10,000, if used for campaign purposes
Political ads in NV &amp; nationwide are too often funded by anonymous donors. Voters deserve to know who pays for ads

Sen. McConnell has said his ‚Äòsingle most important‚Äô goal is defeating the President. The mid.-class suffers for Rs to achieve political aims
Unfortunately, Republicans played their games of obstruction &amp; opposition, manufacturing reasons to kill it out of thin air
The legislation Republicans have blocked would have provided small businesses w/2 tax cuts, designed to create jobs #SmallBizJobs
We'll have votes on tax cuts this work period but first Republicans should stop filibustering a tax cut for small businesses
Republicans are holding tax cuts for the the middle class hostage just to protect tax breaks for the top 2% Americans
I thank @nclr for holding its annual convention in Las Vegas. http://t.co/uCImXzui I look forward to hearing @vp Biden speak next #NCLR12
Stay safe, list of cooling stations http://t.co/M8c9a3JR MT @DanaNews3 Today hottest day in 5 yrs, last time we hit 114 was July 2007 #Vegas
Republicans say they want to cut the deficit. In weeks ahead, they'll have a chance to vote to extend tax cuts for these mid.-class families
Extending tax cuts for families with income below $250K will help the middle class &amp; allow us to reduce our deficit responsibly
I agree w/the President: We should extend tax cuts for all U.S. families up to the first $250,000 of income immediately
RT @AdamKilgoreWP: Bryce Harper named to the all-star team to replace Giancarlo Stanton. Youngest position player to ever make it.
During #nclr12 @astrid_NV said that I inspired her to become a	#DREAMAct activist, but she also inspires me to keep fighting to pass it
Glad to welcome the #nclr12 conference in Las Vegas. I hope they inspire a lot of #lideres12

Thanks to the bipartisan agreement, 7M college students will not see their education costs rise by $1,000 next year
Today's Senate vote proves that when Republicans work w/Democrats, we can do a lot to move the economy forward
#ACA isn't perfect. Yet now that #SCOTUS has ruled, it's time to renew our focus on creating jobs and securing our economic future
If you have insurance today, nothing changes. Yet if you lose your job, you will not lose your health insurance under #ACA
Insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against Americans with preexisting health conditions #ACA
Soon, 35M who can't afford their premiums will have access to reasonably priced insurance &amp; quality care #ACA
Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling was a victory for the country. Under health care reform, 6M+ young people have gained health insurance #ACA
Democrats are focused on creating jobs, &amp; we will not waste time in the Senate w/votes or hearings on this empty, partisan crusade
I support Atty. Gen. Holder, who has done an outstanding job protecting our nation &amp; prosecuting threats to our nat'l security
Instead of focusing on jobs, House Republicans are pursuing a political witch hunt against the Obama administration &amp; Atty. Gen. Eric Holder
Soon, every man woman &amp; child in America will have access to health insurance they can afford &amp; vital care they need: http://t.co/ZesGv3Js
Now that this matter is settled, I hope we can work together to create jobs and secure this country‚Äôs economic future
Seniors are saving money on prescriptions &amp; checkups. Children can no longer be denied insurance because of a preexisting condition #ACA
Millions of Americans are already seeing the benefits of the law we passed #ACA
I'm pleased to see #SCOTUS put the rule of law ahead of partisanship and ruled that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional #ACA
Democrats are ready for comprehensive #immigration reform that's tough, fair &amp; practical, &amp; hope Republicans join us http://t.co/YXw01yKW
The only decisive R voice on #immigration seems to be Mitt Romney, who called AZ law a "model for the nation" &amp; promised to veto #DREAMAct
Yet Republicans that once favored a permanent solution to fix our broken #immigration system are deserting efforts to find common ground
Cong. has 2 things in its favor on #immigration: The President's directive to lift specter of deportation &amp; the #SCOTUS ruling on AZ law
Today‚Äôs opening of McCarran‚Äôs new Terminal 3 is great news for Nevada and all who travel to the state: http://t.co/s4kgV5jV
New infograph on clean energy progress in NV: http://t.co/NOBadEoT Looking forward to sharing more at Nat‚Äôl Clean Energy Summit in Aug.
Laws that legalize discrimination are not compatible w/our nation's ideals &amp; traditions of equal rights
Looking ahead to #immigration debate, it's disturbing that Mitt Romney called the unconstitutional AZ law a ‚Äòmodel‚Äô for reform
Ultimately, responsibility to fix nation's broken immigration system lies w/Cong.; Rs must join Ds to forge fair, tough, practical solutions
I'm greatly concerned AZ provision endangering innocent citizens of being detained --unless carrying papers ‚Äì will lead to racial profiling
#SCOTUS was right to strike down majority of AZ law; That 3 of 4 provisions were struck down shows law was unconstitutional

On the 147th anniversary of #Juneteenth, commemorating slavery's end in U.S., I remain committed to equality for all http://t.co/1mUZ78N2
I quoted a great Nevadan in a press conference today: http://t.co/l70uwTT0 #clownquestionbro
That makes you wonder whether Republicans ever really committed to pass the #DREAMAct and comprehensive #immigration reform
Now isn't the time to abandon calls for #immigration reform.  But that‚Äôs what Republicans are doing ‚Äì taking their marbles &amp; going home
Rs agree w/substance of Obama‚Äôs #immigration directive, but don't want him to get credit for bringing 800,000 young ppl out of the shadows
No one disagrees our immigration system needs fixing. But every time we offer to work with Republicans, they have an excuse to fight change
I hope Rs will finally join us to find a bipartisan way to mend our flawed #immigration system -instead of just complaining that it's broken
Some Republicans say a solution to the DREAMers' dilemma should have come from Cong., not Pres. Obama. But the GOP prevented that
Yet Pres. Obama's directive is temporary, &amp; the onus is now on Cong. to protect the DREAMers &amp; fix our broken #immigration system
The DREAM Act would create a path to citizenship for 100s of 1000s of young people, brought to the U.S. through no fault of their own
@Astrid_NV is an ex. of why we need #immigration reform -she came to US as a child,has her eyes set on a college deg.  http://t.co/ibXtebvh
Today, I wish all dads a happy  #FathersDay - a time to reflect on the importance of family
I will continue to fight for the DREAM Act and call on Republicans to join me http://t.co/s2mpgwKq
I have met w/many DREAMers in NV and across the U.S. and these men and women have so much to contribute to society
I congratulate Pres. Obama &amp; Sec. Napolitano for the thoughtful decision that benefits not just DREAMers, but our entire nation
Pleased the Senate confirmed Mari Carmen #Aponte to be Amb. to El Savador. She was an exemplary nominee http://t.co/LpyT1gWj
Happy 237th birthday to the @USarmy. To all those who serve, thank you for your dedication to our country #ArmyBDay
My friend @SenJohnMcCain and I agree on the #Pacquiao decision.  Here were my remarks from yesterday http://t.co/6gHhHMPZ
A bill in the Senate would help tackle this problem. The longer we wait, the longer power plants &amp; financial systems go unprotected
When virtually every intelligence expert says we need to secure the systems that make the lights come on, inaction is not an option
The entire nat'l security establishment agrees we need to protect critical infrastructure. Yet some key Rs argue we should do nothing
Cyber attacks don‚Äôt threaten only our national security -they also threaten our economic security, costing billions of $/yr, 1000s of jobs
Technology has changed our world - the way we get &amp; share information, protect it, &amp; the types of attacks we must guard against

The Republican strategy has been to kill jobs bills in hopes of harming the economy &amp; hurting the Pres. Time for them to end delay tactics
The farm bill creates jobs, cuts subsidies &amp; reduces the deficit. I hope Republicans won't put this at risk

Today I stood with @SenatorBarb and pay equity advocate Lilly Ledbetter to discuss the Paycheck Fairness Act http://t.co/3TmiHDea
Democrats stand with middle-class women working to keep their families afloat.  And today, America will see where Republican Senators stand
The only Republicans who are against our common-sense measure ‚Äî the Paycheck Fairness Act -- are the ones here in Washington #equalpay
Republicans have vowed to block legislation that would even the playing field ‚Äì even though Americans overwhelmingly support it #equalpay
Over their lifetimes, NV women will earn ~$475,000 &lt; their male counterparts &amp; women nationwide face pay disparity http://t.co/9bvYycRZ
African American women make 62 cents on the $ &amp; Hispanic women 54 cents on the $, compared to white men working the same job
Most Americans think if they get an edu. &amp; work hard, they can achieve success. Yet women make 77 cents for every $ men do #equalpay
Republicans are poised to send the message to little girls that their work is less valuable because they happened to be born female
The Paycheck Fairness Act would give workers tools to combat discrimination, bar retaliation against workers who discuss salary
Women today make 77 cents on the dollar compared to men. The avg. woman working full time,yr-round in NV makes $7,300 &lt;a man in the same job
Paycheck Fairness may have 2 strikes against it - it would be good for women and the economy, so Republicans are determined to oppose it

The 6M Americans affected by the flood insurance program deserve the certainty long-term legislation will provide
I'm also hopeful this week the Senate will be able to find a path ahead to temporarily renew the flood insurance program
I was pleased yesterday to reach an agreement with the Republican Leader to move fwd. w/passage of FDA Safety &amp; Innovation Act
I am pleased resources from FEMA are assisting with fire management &amp; control, I will continue to closely monitor the situation #topazfire
The Senate must act quickly to pass the FDA Safety &amp; Innovation Act. The bill also ensures the FDA can approve new drugs quickly
The FDA Safety &amp; Innovation Act helps set up effective communication lines between drug makers, the FDA &amp; doctors to prevent shortages
With cooperation from manufacturers, we can prevent drug shortages and save lives
Last year, the FDA reported shortages of 231 drugs - including several chemotherapy medicines
On Monday, a Las Vegas oncologist ordered 10 drugs from his supplier. Only 8 were available. Drug shortages like this are typical
I have attended races over yrs and today‚Äôs recommendations will ensure thousands of spectators can safely watch &amp; enjoy #renoairace
For 50 yrs #renoairrace have been important part of N NV community and I am confident they will continue
Extending mid-class tax cuts would provide certainty to millions of families &amp; ample time to deal w/oth. challenges facing Cong. at yr's end
We could avoid the so-called fiscal cliff tomorrow if Republicans would agree to extend the middle class tax cuts
Each year, 1.5M+ Americans are diagnosed w/cancer. The FDA Safety &amp; Innovation Act will help ensure no one waits for life-saving medicine
The Senate must act to improve communication between drug makers, the FDA &amp; doctors to reduce shortages &amp; save patients' lives
In the last 6 yrs, drug shortages have quadrupled. Last year, the FDA reported shortages of 231 drugs, including many chemotherapy medicines
Americans face shortages of many life-saving, FDA-approved drugs in hospitals in NV &amp; across the country
Americans w/life-threatening illnesses are watching to see if we can act quickly to ease shortages of medicine ‚Äî or whether Rs will obstruct
I hope Republicans will allow us to advance this bill. Before we can get to work on it, Republicans must stop their filibuster
This week, the Senate must pass crucial reforms to prevent drug shortages and bring life-saving medicines to the market more quickly
Service Members in NV should explore @GreatBasinNPS, @LakeMeadNRA, @DeathValleyNP #nationalparks
It's Armed Forces Day on Saturday; military members &amp; their families can receive yearlong free passes to U.S. nat'l parks
On June 2nd, my office is hosting a Mortgage Assistance Workshop in Las Vegas http://t.co/OPkcNzPO
To get life-saving drugs &amp; devices to patients who need them quickly, Congress must give the FDA tools it needs to review &amp; approve them
Every day, U.S. hospitals face shortages of life-saving, FDA-approved drugs &amp; treatments. No parent should have to watch a child suffer
I hope to see the strong, bipartisan effort that Senators Harkin &amp; Enzi began continue as the Senate considers this important bill
The bill also enacts crucial reforms to prevent drug shortages &amp; bring life-saving medicines to the market quickly
Today the Senate considers legislation that gives the FDA resources to ensure medical devices, drugs &amp; treatments are safe &amp; effective
Every moment we waste refighting old battles or revisiting Republicans' failed economic policies is time that could be spent creating jobs
The Republican stunt budgets all take a one-sided approach, which showers the wealthy with tax breaks paid for by the middle class
If Republicans were serious about deficit reduction, they wouldn‚Äôt work to undo that August law, which cuts more than $2T from the deficit
In Aug., Cong. passed &amp; Pres. Obama signed a budget that reduces the deficit by &gt;$2T -the Budget Control Act. 28 @Senate_GOPs voted for it
Today, Republicans will force the Senate to waste a day w/political show votes on stunt budgets: We already have a legally-binding budget
Pleased Senate voted to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. Ex-Im helps biz in NV &amp; nationwide compete overseas, hire workers at home
We shouldn't have to argue over bipartisan proposals like this one. I remain hopeful we can still find a way to work together on it
Last year, Export-Import Bank financing helped 3,600 private cos add almost 300,000 jobs in &gt;2,000 American communities
A measure that would support 300,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs -Ex-Im Bank- may stall in the Senate tonight. The holdup: More GOP obstruction
There was a time a bill to reduce the deficit &amp; support 100s of 1000s of jobs would fly through the Senate w/bipartisan support. Not anymore
We in the Senate must continue to advocate for mothers, so they can give their children tools to turn aspirations into reality
My mother's words have guided me through my life and through my years in public service #MothersDay
I wish families in NV &amp; nationwide a happy Mother's Day, &amp; thank moms everywhere for the hard work they do
On Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we recognize sacrifices made by spouses of our Armed Forces, thank them for commitment to our nation

Sen. Lugar said, and we should all remember: ‚ÄúBipartisanship is not the opposite of principle‚Äù
I worry when I see dedicated patriots like Sen. Lugar drummed out by Tea Party zealots for being too willing to cooperate
One man always willing to extend a hand across the aisle is Sen. Lugar. He's served every Hoosier well &amp; wisely for 3+ decades
U.S. exporters have waited for 2 months to see whether Rs would back this biz-friendly, job-creating policy -&amp; shouldn't have to wait longer
Ex-Im Bank reauth. passed on strong, bipartisan vote in House. I hope the Senate will be able to quickly approve the House-passed measure
Export-Import Bank helps U.S. cos sell products abroad. Example of the kind of smart investments Cong. should be making to spur job growth
I handled domestic relations work as a lawyer, all governed by state law. I believe that's proper place for issue to be decided
The idea that allowing 2 loving, committed people to marry would have any impact on my life, or on my family's, always struck me as absurd
My personal belief: marriage is b/w a man &amp; woman. But in civil society, I believe people should b able to marry whomever they want
Tough cuts were designed to force compromise. But Rs refused shared sacrifice, insisted on balancing budget on backs of middle class
Sequester's a tough pill to swallow, but it's a balanced approach to reduce the deficit that shares the pain as well as the responsibility
Under the #GOPbudget, Rs would hand out tax breaks to millionaires, shield corporate defense contractors, &amp; shred the social safety net
The #GOPbudget proposal &amp; so-called reconciliation bill ignores a bicameral agreement in Aug. to cut spending &amp; reflects skewed priorities
While we work to create jobs &amp; make college affordable, Republicans are operating under a different set of priorities
For the sake of 7M students who could see their loan payments skyrocket, I hope Rs' actions will align more w/their words #DontDoubleMyRate
Republicans have paid lip service to the need to protect students from debt burden, but their obstructionism speaks louder than their words
GOP filibuster = 26,000 Nevadan students paying add'l $1,000. How would higher loan rates affect you? http://t.co/VIQCLKTn #DontDoubleMyRate
Great news:@realmadrid &amp; @Juventus_Tweets scheduled to play this August in Las Vegas. This will be a great game #futbol http://t.co/L9ix0U5k
Senate Democrats have a proposal to freeze student loan interest rates at current levels for a year w/o adding a penny to the deficit
For a single mom working 3 part-time jobs, $1,000 is the difference between completing a bachelor‚Äôs degree &amp; dropping out of school
Excited to meet Bryce Harper, fellow Nevadan &amp; great baseball talent. Hope to see him hit one out tonight #nationals http://t.co/obU5EEGA
Creating jobs must be Congress' priority. House's sitting on bipart. bills to save 3M transportation jobs, &amp; modernize the postal industry
New jobs report shows that while the unemployment rate continues to fall, too many Americans in NV &amp; nationwide are struggling to find work

I urge the House to quickly approve #Senate's bill. Since Congress 1st approved #VAWA, domestic violence incidents have fallen by 53%
Today's bipartisan vote will give law enforcement tools needed to prosecute &amp; convict perpetrators of heinous crimes &amp; protect victims #VAWA
Happy birthday @BLMNational. Visit http://t.co/QY5bnAfR to celebrate 200 yrs & read history on the General Land Office #BLM200
If Congress doesn‚Äôt act soon, &gt;7M students will pay $1,000+ in interest/year. This would cost NV students $21M+ next yr #dontdoublemyrate
The Senate must also work to keep student loan rates from doubling from 3.4% to 6.8% #dontdoublemyrate
#VAWA has been non-controversial in the past. I hope this year‚Äôs vote is equally bipartisan. Women & families depend on our swift action
When we complete work on postal reform, we will begin work on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act #VAWA
Today, the Senate completes work on a postal reform bill to safeguard 8M jobs that rely on a healthy postal system ‚Äì in NV & nationwide
Today I met w/Deanna LeBlanc, NV's Teacher of the Year. Congrats to her for her hard work on behalf of NV students http://t.co/OR0S6yDg
I agree w/Pres. Obama. Congress shouldn't double student loan rates. Affordable college boosts our economy. #DontDoubleMyRate
Free admission for Natl. Parks Week. I encourage Nevadans to visit @GreatBasinNPS @DeathValleyNPS @LakeMeadNRA http://t.co/3tGCk0Dp
The business community agrees: making college affordable is key to keeping America competitive in our global economy
Yet many Republicans have signaled they'd rather cut taxes for the richest of the rich than invest in the next generation of U.S. workers
With middle-class families struggling, we can't afford to put college out of reach for more promising young people
We must address a looming crisis for 7.4M students in US & 26k in NV: July 1 is deadline for federal student loan interest rates to double
By joining Democrats to pass #VAWA, Republicans can help send a message that this country doesn‚Äôt tolerate domestic violence
Despite progress, we still have work to do to keep women & families safe. Three women die in U.S./day at the hands of abusive partners
Since its passage in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has reduced annual incidence of domestic violence by &gt;50 % #VAWA
I hope all Nevadans take time during this #EarthDay to appreciate Nevada's great outdoors
Last night, staff from my Vegas office attended a discussion @UNLVNews celebrating 40th anniversary of Title IX #LadyRebels @UNLVAthletics
Congrats to Dr. Marc Johnson on being named President of @UNRnews. Students, faculty will benefit from his continued leadership
The Senate postal reform bill isn't perfect. But it's a strong, bipartisan bill that will modernize the institution w/o gutting its mission
The House bill is wrong approach:it would immediately eliminate Sat. mail, pave path to close post offices & lay off 10s of 1000s of workers
Unlike the unacceptable postal reform bill that Rep. Issa's pursuing, the Senate bill protects the Postal Service we know & rely on
The bipartisan Senate bill will build a leaner, smarter post office that offers new services while continuing to deliver mail 6 days/week
But today, challenge facing the Postal Service is how to adapt to decreasing volume of mail rather than how to deal with increasing demand
For 2 centuries, the Post Service has relied on technology to cope w/constant growth ‚Äì growth in volume of mail & places it delivers
Met w/Elko High students on their visit to DC w/the Close Up program. Great to see young Nevadans participating in govt http://t.co/dOJTsKgs
We have a bipartisan bill to reform the Postal Service's business model in a measured way. I hope senators will work together to save it
Yet the Postal Service maintains its importance. Nearly 1/2 of rural homes, including many in NV, don't have Broadband Internet access
Changing technology has meant serious, new challenges for the Postal Service that has served this nation from its very beginning
For 200 yrs, the Postal Service has delivered the mail rain or shine. But today, it's in crisis
Growing up in Searchlight, a mail carrier walked 22 mi through 3ft of snow to deliver mail to Searchlight from a train in California
The @SmithCenterLV is a world class venue for Nevadans and visitors to enjoy. See some photos from my tour here: http://t.co/Inu4m44t
Congrats to @SmithCenterLV Don Snyder on @lvchamber award. I toured the Center while home & was very impressed by this cultural space
When a woman makes 77 cents for every $ a man makes, for similar work, it means less money for families to pay for  education or food
Equal Pay Day's a reminder that the gender pay gap is still a reality that holds back women professionally & our nation economically
We won't stop fighting for tax fairness. In the future, I hope Republicans will think of the mechanic & teacher before America's wealthiest
In blocking the #BuffettRule, Senate Republicans again put millionaires ahead of the middle class
I hope Republicans will join us tonight as we choose a path toward economic fairness that will let Americans rise together as one people
Yet as we work to make our tax system fair, House Republicans pursue a budget that would hand more tax breaks to the wealthiest few
The #BuffettRule would restore fairness to our tax system. 3/4 of Americans believe the wealthiest should contribute
Last year, 7,000 millionaires didn't pay a single penny in federal income taxes. Instead, middle class families footed the bill
Times are tough for many middle-class families. But millionaires & billionaires aren't sharing the pain ‚Äì or the sacrifices
Great to hear ~200 NV non-profit reps attended today's sustainable funding forum (photos) http://t.co/OAnKafsn
NV non-profits are gathering in Las Vegas for sustainable funding & grant forum that my office is co-hosting http://t.co/cX6XBxp6
Even Ronald Reagan believed in the importance of Americans paying their fair share in taxes http://t.co/0MJAueMU #BuffettRule
The wealthiest Americans are paying taxes at one of the lowest rates in 50 years; the #BuffettRule would restore fairness to the tax code
House Republicans should pass the Senate's bipartisan transportation jobs bill as soon as they return, & give job certainty to ~3M Americans
Today's jobs report shows that too many Americans in NV & nationwide are still out of work. Congress must remain focused on creating jobs
Congratulations to Nancy Munoz @yourtrolly, CEO of Henderson's Specialty Vehicles-U.S. SBA's #NV Small Business Person of the Year

Republican opportunistic half-measures don't solve our immigration crisis like the DREAM Act can, and here's why http://t.co/66zaifNs
As Republicans consider whether to put oil co. coffers ahead of taxpayers‚Äô wallets, I hope they consider these facts: http://t.co/TDFlFQL6
We need to continue responsible, domestic oil exploration, but also invest in clean energy that can free us from oil over the long term
"Drill baby, drill" isn't a comprehensive solution to this nation's energy problems, including high gas prices #RepealOilSubsidies
Senate Republicans appear poised to once again pick the pockets of American taxpayers in order to line the pockets of Big Oil companies
Last year, the 5 major oil companies raked in more than $260,000 in profits every minute of every hour of every day
Over the last decade, the 5 major oil companies have raked in more than $1 trillian & taken home billions in taxpayer $ they don't need
Miranda Du is an experienced litigator and will be an excellent federal judge http://t.co/I0IBFbIW
Senate just confirmed Miranda Du to federal bench in #NV. As I said from floor this am her story proves the American Dream is alive and well
No service member should face homelessness. Pleased NV Housing Authorities received ~$1 million to help homeless vets http://t.co/S6iXPD6K
Middle-class families are struggling. Oil companies that last year raked in $261,000/minute - 24 hours/day, 365 days/year - are not
It is beyond ridiculous when Republicans argue that oil companies need billions in taxpayer subsidies each year
But don't be fooled by last night's bipartisan vote. Senate Republicans would never side with American taxpayers against Big Oil
Yesterday the Senate took the first step toward repealing wasteful taxpayer giveaways to oil and gas companies
Repealing ~$24B in wasteful subsidies to oil companies would pay for clean energy investments, with money left over to reduce the deficit
If Republicans cont. to stand up for oil cos making record profits, it will be clear they care most about helping cos that don't need help
Our bill wld end $2B+/yr in wasteful giveaways to Big Oil, invest savings in clean energy to grow our econ., create #jobs
While House Rs risk #transportation jobs, the #Senate will move fwd w/a bill to repeal billions in subsidies to big #oil companies
It's time for House Rs to act responsibly, taking up #Senate-passed #transportation bill that's supported by @Senate_GOPs &amp; creates #jobs
I was disappointed to hear House R leaders will pursue 3-mo. ext. of hwy bill, instead of Senate's 2-yr bipartisan #transportation bill
Millions of roads are in disrepair. But rather than put ppl to work fixing them, House Rs are pandering to Tea Party, risking ~3M #jobs
Passing IPO bill is small step towards creating #jobs;it's time for House Rs to take more important step of passing Senate transp. jobs bill
@SenatorBarb from #Md is a patriot &amp; pioneer &amp; I was proud to be 1 of many who honored her for becoming longest-serving woman in #Congress
Reauthorizing @ExImBankUs is something that has always been done on a bipartisan basis, yet @Senate_GOPs turned this into a partisan battle
@Senate_GOPs voted today against a bipartisan measure that would've supported 300,000+ jobs simply to provide cover for Tea Party extremists
~300,000 American workers had jobs last yr b/c of support from @ExImBankUS. I hope these workers will come 1st as colleagues cast votes
House Rs should listen to #Senate colleagues. @LindseyGrahamSC says w/o @ExImBankUS "our ability to grow in SC is nonexistent"
The @ExImBankUS proposal is bipartisan. It has 3 Republican co-sponsors, including Sen. Shelby #SupportJobs #MadeInAmerica
The proposal to reauthorize the @ExImBankUS doesn't deserve fight House Republicans want. It's imp. to help U.S. exports compete globally
I started Academy Days 2 decades ago, &amp; I invite all interested students to attend these sessions http://t.co/jqVjOXCF

American entrepreneurs need help of @ExImBankUS. The Bank doesn‚Äôt add a penny to the deficit. No excuse for Rs not to support it
@ExImBankUS chairman says cos abroad "are licking their chops" at idea that we'd stop backing businesses that sell their products abroad
The @ExImBankUS proposal is bipartisan, yet I hear some Rs don't want to advance it #MisplacedPriorities
The @ExImBankUS proposal supports 100s of 1000s more #jobs than the small biz capital bill. Last yr, @ExImBankUS helped back ~300,000 jobs
It‚Äôs critical we pass bill to help biz access capital. But it‚Äôs more imp. to reauthorize the job-creating @ExImBankUS

In addition 2 small biz capital bill, Ds will advance bipartisan proposal 2 help U.S. businesses sell more of their products overseas
#Senate moves today 2 bipartisan legislation that will improve innovators' access 2 capital, give start-ups flexibility 2 hire &amp; grow
#Senate has accomplished a great deal this week: We passed hwy bill 2 create/save 3M #jobs &amp; charted course 2 confirm 14 new judges
The job-creating programs funded by the highway #jobs bill expire in a few weeks. House colleagues should pass our bipartisan bill w/o delay
The hwy bill passed b/c Ds &amp; Rs came togeth., forged common-sense solutions to create #jobs &amp; keep our econ. moving
Pleased a strong bipart. majority in #Senate voted earlier 2 create or save ~3M jobs rebuilding roads, bridges &amp; railways in #NV, nationwide

The #Senate is on track to pass the highway #jobs bill. And I hope the House will take up the bipartisan bill &amp; pass it without delay
10s of 1000s of collapsing bridges &amp; millions of miles of crumbling pavement are dragging down the nation's #economy

Highway #jobs bill has support across the political spectrum ‚Äì from @jiminhofe to @SenatorBoxer, from the @uschamber to the @AFLCIO
The highway #jobs bill is bipartisan and would save or create nearly 3M American jobs
Everything shouldn't be a fight - especially not the highway #jobs bill currently on the floor
I enjoyed sitting down with Lawrence O‚ÄôDonnell today. Our conversation airs on @TheLastWord at 10 pm tonight
It will take a bipartisan effort 2 advance the #highwaybill. Hopeful Rs will join us to put jobs ahead of political games #jobs1st
Democrats can't keep #construction crews across this nation working to repair 70,000 collapsing bridges w/o Republican cooperation
Despite bipartisan support 4 #highwaybill, Republican leadership has wasted almost 1 mo. of Senate‚Äôs time obstructing it #wrongpriorities
That's why @jiminhofe & @senatorboxer joined hands across the political aisle to advance the bipartisan #transportation bill
We know from 56 yrs of experience that investing in highways, roadways, railways creates & sustains #jobs #highwaybil

Once the #Senate disposes of this partisan, political amndmnt, I hope we can resume in earnest bipartisan work on the highway #jobs bill

In 2012, we must work to protect the mid. class, invest in infrastructure & combat inequality. Learn more here (video): http://t.co/OwFsyl4c
If we don't fight inequality now, the rich will get richer, the poor will get poorer, & the middle class will shrink #IncomeInequality
My new year's wish for #Congress: Put last year's gridlock behind us -- and find courage & faith to listen & cooperate
Saddened to hear @SenatorKirk suffered a stroke. I wish him a full & speedy recovery
Great game btwn #Findlay and #Gorman am glad I was able to attend. Looking fwrd to another great game @UNLVAthletics tnight.
Every issue doesn't have 2 be a fight. The compromise on #FAA is an ex. of the common-sense results Ds & Rs can produce when working togeth.
While some issues remain, there's no reason we can't resolve them in the coming days & avoid risk of another #FAA shutdown
Pleased that we've cleared the way for a long-term ext. of the #FAA, resolving major obstacles in a manner that protects American workers
Americans rightfully expect to be fairly compensated 4 their work. I'm optimistic that we can reach compromise on PROTECT IP in coming weeks
There's no reason that legitimate issues raised about PROTECT IP can't be resolved. Counterfeiting & piracy cost 1000s of #jobs yearly #pipa
In light of recent events, I have decided to postpone Tuesday's vote on the PROTECT IP Act #PIPA

I hope that moving fwd, Rs will work w/Ds to address the concerns of the mid-class, instead of turning every issue into a partisan fight
With our econ. in fragile recovery, Americans are looking 2 us to find common ground, not grind biz to a halt until 1 side gets all it wants
Despite admitting that Obama's nominee, Richard Cordray, is qualified 4 the job, Rs denied him an up-or-down vote to weaken the CFPB
I support Obama's decision 2 ensure mid-class families will have the advocate they deserve 2 fight against practices denying econ. security

This institution relies on trust & good will to work. And Americans across the country need #Congress to work effectively
I hope this week can be a learning experience for some of my colleagues who are newer to #Congress
Pleased to annc. Sens. Baucus (Mont.), (Cardin (Md.), Casey (Pa.), & Reed (RI) as conferees to negotiate a 1-yr #payrolltaxcut ext. w/Rs
Yr-long extensions of #payrolltaxcut, #UI & #Medicare payments 4 physicians has always been our goal; Ds won't rest until we've passed them
I'm grateful that the voices of reason have prevailed & @SpeakerBoehner has agreed to pass the #Senate‚Äôs bipartisan compromise
It's important that we now hear from @SpeakerBoehner in light of Sen. McConnell's comments
Once the #House passes the #Senate's bipartisan compromise, I'm happy to restart negotiating to forge a yr-long #payrolltaxcut
I agree w/Sen. McConnell & the many other @Senate_GOPs who say most reasonable path fwd is for #House to pass #Senate compromise immediately

I've been trying 2 negotiate yearlong ext. w/Rs 4 weeks, & I'm happy to cont. once #House passes bipartisan compromise to protect mid class
I'd implore @SpeakerBoehner to listen to sensible @Senate_GOPs & courageous House Rs who are calling for him 2 take responsible path fwd
The clock's ticking towards a mid-class tax hike http://t.co/FBpGqj8w
@SpeakerBoehner won't let #House hold up-or-down vote on #Senate bipartisan compromise b/c he knows it would pass
It's unconscionable that @SpeakerBoehner is blocking a bipart. compromise that protects mid-class families from tax hike looming on Jan. 1st
Happy to cont. negotiations on a yearlong deal as soon as #House passes the #Senate's compromise, & prevents tax hike from hitting mid class
I'm encouraged to see courageous Rs in #House & #Senate speak out against @SpeakerBoehenr's decision to put politics ahead of mid-class
W/millions of Americans struggling financially, it's unconscionable 4 @SpeakerBoehner 2 block bipart. deal that prevents mid class tax hike
@SpeakerBoehner should allow up-or-down vote on #Senate compromise bill that Sen. McConnell & I negotiated at the Speaker's request
I've always sought yr-long ext. Happy to cont. negotiating one once we've made sure mid-class families will not wake up to a tax hike Jan. 1
Sen. McConnell & I negotiated a compromise at Speaker's request. I won't re-open negotiations until House follows through, passes agreement
If Rs vote down the bipartisan compromise negotiated by both R & D leaders, 160M middle class Americans will see a tax increase
If @SpeakerBoehner refuses to vote on the bipartisan compromise that passed in the #Senate, Rs will force a tax hike on mid. class families
When we met last, the Speaker requested Sen. McConnell & I work out a compromise. We forged a mid. ground that passed w/bipartisan support
I would hate to think Speaker Boehner is refusing to act on the #Senate's bipartisan compromise b/c he is afraid it will actually pass
Instead of threatening middle-class families w/a tax hike, Speaker Boehner should bring up the bipartisan Senate compromise, which passed
Ds worked tirelessly to prevent tax hike on mid class; Rs wouldn't agree to long-term tax relief unless Ds agreed to cut Medicare benefits
Jill Derby has been a leader in higher ed in #NV for 2 decades, I am confident she will be an asset to the Dept of Edu in this role

We need to begin real negotiations on how to prevent a $1,000 tax hike on American families #payrolltaxcut

Middle-class Americans will notice when paychecks are smaller in Jan. And they‚Äôll have Republicans in Cong. to blame
It's time to work together. If Rs cont. to block reasonable plans to cut taxes for 160M workers, there will be consequences
Rs are wasting time catering to the #TeaParty folks when they should be working w/us on a bipartisan pckg that can pass both chambers
Now the Speaker has added ideological candy to get a #payrolltaxcut vote in the House. But WH & Dems say leg. is DOA
@Senate_GOPs have twice voted down their own #payrolltaxcut plan. And House Rs were unable to bring their plan to a vote for weeks
Thx,@momsrising.We're wrkng in Cong. 2 make sure #unemployment #ins. doesn't expire. Appreciate the stories you shared http://t.co/0VOl7wQC
If the House sends us their bill with Keystone in it, they are just wasting valuable time b/c it will not pass the #Senate
W/the middle class facing a huge tax increase on the 1st of Jan., now is not the time to be debating unrelated measures like an oil pipeline
Look forward to cont. working with you, @HispanicCaucus, to put the American Dream w/in reach of #Hispanics & every American
Congratulations @HispanicCaucus for 35 yrs of ensuring that issues of importance to the #Latino community remain in the national spotlight
Instead of playing political games, #Congress should work to find common ground. In the days ahead, I intend to do exactly that
And House Rs‚Äô bill is a partisan joke that has no chance of passing #Senate, but mid.-class families facing a $1000 tax hike aren't laughing
With today's payroll tax cut votes, Rs showed yet again they're more interested in passing cuts for millionaires than for the middle class
I will cont. 2 monitor the investigation being performed by #FAA &# NTSB and do everything I can to ensure helicopter tours remain safe #NV
Grateful 4 the efforts of Nat'l Park Service rangers, Metro Police‚Äôs Search & Rescue & Clark Cnty & Henderson fire depts, who responded #NV
My thoughts are with the families of the 5 people who died in a terrible crash near Lake Mead yesterday #NV
It's shocking that despite the econ. crash in our rearview mirror, Rs would leave consumers w/o a watchdog 2 guard against greed of Wall St.
This is the 1st time in #Senate hist. that a party's signaling it will block a qualified candidate b/c party disagrees w/existence of agency
@Senate_GOPs know Richard Cordray's qualified; they're blocking his nom. b/c they unjustifiably dislike @CFPB, an agency established by law
Today we honor #PearlHarbor #veterans for their courage & sacrifice. They were true heroes & will not be forgotten http://t.co/lWpU2Vfk
Ds won't leave town until we protect mid class families in #NV & across U.S. from $1000 tax hike. We can do it the easy way, or the hard way
Faced w/rebellion in their caucus, Rs have 2 options: Work w/Ds to forge compromise, or squander valuable time trying to appease #TeaParty
#TeaParty Rs are blocking our plan to cut taxes 4 middle-class families http://t.co/gtUxuZ12
Rs like to claim they are the party of tax cuts. But as Ds propose more tax relief for working families, Rs are showing true colors
Looking fwd to this morning's #Hispanic Media Roundtable, a discussion about issues of importance to the #Latino community #HTFRoundtable
If Caitlin Halligan, a truly exceptional candidate, isn‚Äôt qualified to be a judge, it's hard to imagine who Rs would find acceptable
I'm concerned the #Senate is backing away from '05 agreement that the minority wld only block judicial noms in extraordinary circumstances
In blocking nomination of Caitlin Halligan, @Senate_GOPs signaled political gamemanship's more imp. than a judicial nominee's qualifications
3/4 of Americans, including 2/3 of Rs, support plan 2 pay for #payrolltaxcuts. @Senate_GOPs dismiss our #payrolltaxcut plan at their peril
Economists of every political stripe agree: If Rs block new #payrolltaxcut proposal, it will have an immediate, negative impact on our econ.
Sen. Casey's scaled-back #payrolltaxcut proposal will cut taxes for 160M American workers, including 1.2M #Nevadans
Ds will not relent on keeping taxes low for the middle class. Sen. Casey is offering a modified version of his #payrolltaxcut proposal
It's obvious Rs just aren't interested in preventing a $1,000 tax increase on nearly every family in this nation from taking effect Jan. 1
I was skeptical Republicans really supported this middle class tax cut. I was right http://t.co/JHaqbd1K
Last week, Sen. McConnell quoted news reports claiming @Senate_GOPs supported ext. of payroll tax cuts for 160M workers http://t.co/8dqVVnnw
Ds will cont. our focus on creating jobs and I hope Rs will put politics aside & join us in fighting for the middle class #Jobs1st
Too many families in #NV & nationwide are struggling. Rs last night blocked a $1,500 tax cut 4 middle class that would have spurred #jobs
Unemployment figures are a reminder that we must cont. using every tool possible to get our economy growing & get Americans back to work
I hope Rs will decide the economic security of hard-working Americans is more important than protecting wealthiest 1% http://t.co/0OeUzjrs
The #payrolltaxcut extension/expansion bill that Rs blocked wld have put $1500 in pckts of avg mid-class family in Am. & across #NV next yr
With #payrolltaxcut votes, Rs proved tonight they are more interested in tax cuts for millionaires than tax cuts for the middle class
Still work 2 b done 2 perfect parts of #defense bill. But pleased bipartisan maj. agreed protecting nat'l security's more imp. than politics
I congratulate Senators Levin & McCain for their stewardship of the #defense bill & for working through several difficult issues
Tonight, w/passage of #defense bill, #Senate voted overwhelmingly 2 support men & women in uniform, incl. 1,100+ #Nevadans serving abroad
I applaud the passage of the bipartisan amendment that will hold accountable internat'l banks that work w/the Central Bank of #Iran
New map shows how much #Nevadans in each county will save from Dems' #payrolltaxcut http://t.co/U0GryjWp
Yet as usual, the only real target of the Republican meat axe is the American middle class.  And that‚Äôs just wrong
If Rs took time 2 speak 2 a few of the 1M+ #Nevadans that our tax relief plan wld help, they'd understand how imp. it is to working families
Middle class workers & biz in the states of EVERY senator would benefit from our #payrolltaxcut plan. See this map: http://t.co/QIRYdsVU
The @Senate_GOPs #payrolltaxcut plan goes directly against the budget agreement we reached just a few months ago
