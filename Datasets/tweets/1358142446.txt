@z0mbielux The best way to provide crash protection to passengers of large school buses is through a concept called ‚Äúcompartmentalization.‚Äù Through compartmentalization, children are protected from crashes by strong, closely-spaced seats that have energy-absorbing seat backs
Students are 7Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ ‚ùå safer in a bus üöåinstead of by car.

@Transbay_Riders @rideact Apologies, it will affect BUS service that runs along 580 eastbound.
@KVeklerov Right now we have all lanes blocked again as we search for evidence.  Avoid 580 if possible.
@Transbay_Riders @rideact It will certainly affect us service that runs along 580.
@CBSSF We have closed the lanes again to search for additional evidence, there is no time frame as it depends what we locate.
UPDATE:  @oaklandpoliceca will be the lead agency for this shooting investigation.  Expect severe delays on I-580 in #Oakland.
UPDATE: the 14th Ave on ramp and the Fruitvale off ramp from eastbound 580 are now the only roads closed.  I-580 is now open.
All of eastbound 580 near Fruitvale Ave is closed due to a shooting investigation as we search for and collect evidence.
Fruitvale off ramp from eastbound I-580 is closed due to a shooting investigation.  Unknown time frame, expect delays.  Details to come.

@may_gun Each officer can choose what they want to enforce, but we generally do go towards things like speeding since that causes crashes.

@adeodhar @sethleonard @berkeleyside @aaronc_smith We wouldn't have those stats as the intersection is @CityofBerkeley jurisdiction.
@may_gun @berkeleyside We can stop them and issue a ticket.  If they go through a toll plaza with them it's also toll evasion!

@adeodhar @berkeleyside Not sure if there's one reason.  However, LOTS of crashes occur there due to people not paying attention in traffic!
@rhoehn @berkeleyside Not really as an officer needs to witness the violation to issue a ticket.
