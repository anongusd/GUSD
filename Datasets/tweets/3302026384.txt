@ZacharyBraiterm @Jacob_Labendz @bungarsargon @IlhanMN And she said nothing inappropriate in either form or content.
@Urquwill @edutinker I'm not saying that. I'm saying that using his Jewishness to deflect from his whiteness is not good and that he does have blond spots due to his whiteness that his being Jewish doesn't make up for.
@Urquwill @edutinker I think the "no white men" line of thinking maybe isn't great, but I think it is consistent to put Bernie in that category. 		There are plenty of arguments why Bernie is a good candidate without using his Jewishness to deflect from his whiteness.
@Urquwill @edutinker I understand that. 		I still think it's accurate to label him a white man. Jews definitely have a culture in a way other religions don't, but I think using Bernie's Jewishness to combat the "no white men" attack is ultimately damaging.
@Urquwill @edutinker When it comes to his relationship with people of color, yes, he's "just" a white man. The same goes for any white Jew.

I thought Batya was pretty good on the I/P conflict for a while, but she has severely mishandled Ilhan Omar's comments. 		Talking about the conflict can be painful, but is disheartening to see the reaction Batya has had towards legitimate criticisms of Israel. https://t.co/LbjS9ikpqx
@bungarsargon @IlhanMN @PeterBeinart She's speaking for the dehumanized people in the conflict, the Palestinians. 		She also hasn't been antisemitic.
@e_j_schwarz @23_mgb @bungarsargon @IlhanMN No it isn't, and for most of our history we've survived without it. In the first half of the 20th century, there were many Jews who thought it would be damaging to Jewish liberation.

@JosephKrausz @elivalley @IlhanMN @jonathanchait No. Neither is a rep supporting Israel. However, lobbyists for AIPAC and CUFI and other parts of the Israel lobby are working to achieve allegiance to the Israeli government. As do other lobbyists for other industries or countries.
@JosephKrausz @elivalley @IlhanMN @jonathanchait I'm glad you brought up NIAC. They advocate for Iranian-Americans. They also take clear stances on issues, often ones that go against the Iranian govt. 		AIPAC advocates for supporting Israel regardless of the govt's actions.
The #ADLdefames when it repeatedly twists the words of a Muslim woman of color to paint her as antisemitic for criticizing Israel and the Israel lobby. https://t.co/aqt0lHIjJn
@sjdemas She wasn't. 		She's being mislabeled as an antisemite because she's a Muslim woman who criticized Israel.
@JosephKrausz @elivalley @IlhanMN @jonathanchait Yes. And lobbyists on behalf of those countries are seeking allegiance or loyalty. That's the name of the lobbying game.
@JHWeissmann @EricLevitz @jonathanchait @joshtpm @EricKleefeld @elivalley @IlhanMN I don't think that's an assumption that should be made. It may not be allegiance on an individual level, but they are policies (or lobbying) that seek allegiance from the US politics machine.		To me, allegiance seems like a wholely appropriate word.
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN You are obviously missing literally ALL of the context of what she says. If you listen to what comes before and after that one line, you'd see that you are doing exactly what she describes right before it, silencing her because she's Muslim.
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN You're conflating support of Israel with Jewishness. This is, at best, disingenuous and at worst, well, an antisemitic trope. 		By number, the majority of those emphatically pushing Zionism are actually Evangelical Christians, often for their own reasons that are antisemitic.
@jonathanchait @EricLevitz @EricKleefeld @elivalley @joshtpm @IlhanMN Why? Lobbyists promote allegiance to a specific industry (or country in some cases, even beyond Israel). That's what they do.
@JosephKrausz @elivalley @IlhanMN @jonathanchait But it wasn't. Lobbyists pay for loyalty. That's true whether it's for the pharma industry or for a foreign country (and not only Israel has a lobby for it's interests in the US).
@AG_Conservative Or maybe people who are angry that she's criticizing Israel are labeling her as antisemitic when she isn't and many of us are seeing through that.		Groups like AIPAC *are* paying for loyalty, like all lobbyists do. That's just what lobbying is.
@sweepybuns @DCclone @BenjySarlin No. It really wasn't. 		I understand that you are hurt by it, and that's real and legitimate, but that doesn't mean it was antisemitic.
@BenjySarlin @owillis @BotsonBob That's only because any time anyone says that groups like AIPAC pay for loyalty from politicians (which they absolutely do), they are labeled an antisemite, so they are afraid to.
@jonathanchait https://t.co/U1knNKGOMI
@jonathanchait You're just plain wrong. 		Dual loyalty is the trope against Jewish politicians. AIPAC and the like do lobby for loyalty to a foreign country. As do lobbyists for Saudi Arabia and other countries. 		She was right to say that and it is just not antisemitic.

@BetaPsi77 @vince_winn @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD It was a bad idea from Biden. It's no better for McConnell. Just because Biden would've done it (and there were significant differences), doesn't mean it would've been a good thing.
@amoshiashwili @RattleShark @elizpingree @annalecta Exactly. It's not a deal breaker, but it's definitely a red flag.
@BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @vince_winn @EsotericCD He's a rich, powerful, white man...
@BetaPsi77 @rpmjrOM @vince_winn @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD He still lied under oath. That's still a felony no matter what it was about.
@BetaPsi77 @vince_winn @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD The Biden rule was never used, and while awful, didn't go as far as McConnell did with denying a hearing for Garland.
@BetaPsi77 @rpmjrOM @vince_winn @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD It was 100% relevant to the accusations against him. 		Also, we shouldn't allow lying under oath for anything, no matter how small or insignificant or irrelevant, for our SCOTUS nominees. The Dems were the logical ones.
@vince_winn @robbiese7en @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD It sounds to me like career stability and the opportunity to pursue non-career goals. Just because I don't necessarily want to hit the highest possible career achievement doesn't mean I lack motivation or I'm in a rut. It means I don't value work above all else.
@vince_winn @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD And I'm saying that at his position, a truncated career is still better than 99.9% of people in this country. I have no sympathy.
@vince_winn @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD Not in the modern era, and not for as long.
@BetaPsi77 @vince_winn @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD That's bullshit. No one else has been left for a year without a confirmation hearing.
@BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD And that could be avoided with a true investigation, yet the GOP resisted that. 		There were credible allegations that still have yet to be truly investigated.
@Heminator @KatiePavlich She did though...
@vince_winn @robbiese7en @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD Wanting to be on effectively the second highest court in the land for 40 years is being unmotivated?
@vince_winn @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD Then what's your point? He would've lost very very little.
@greek427 @IlhanMN @seanmdav There's no quacking...
@vince_winn @robbiese7en @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD If it was the DC Court of Appeals? I'd take that in a heartbeat.
@vince_winn @rpmjrOM @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD There was plenty, the GOP chose to ignore it.
@vince_winn @BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD Okay. Kavanaugh's life still wouldn't have been ruined. Garland's wasn't, even though his nomination being blocked was for a worse reason.
@GOP @realDonaldTrump I guess in the GOP, strength means having other world leaders literally laugh at our President.
@VKhaykin @harryreis @joshualeifer That's terrible. I'm sorry you had to go through that. 		That, however, doesn't mean that when progressive Jews complain about the Jewish establishment it is in any way an antisemitic attack. It is us calling on the establishment to join us instead.
@VKhaykin @harryreis @joshualeifer The Jewish establishment IS undermining the progressive movement. I'm a progressive Jew, and I have long felt unwelcome in establishment Jewish places. In fact, the ADL is one of the worst offenders.

I agree. It's also hard to admit mistakes and realize you were wrong. Sure, they didn't listen to the warnings. I've ignored warnings before (who hasn't?). We should embrace them and bring them do the Democratic side so they can help us reverse the damage. https://t.co/mThkTopfqr
@BetaPsi77 @MichaelMjfm @EsotericCD Yes. If he was found innocent, he still would have had a prime spot on the DC District Court of Appeals.
@coopersam339 @EsotericCD @dandrezner The Dem AG, Mark Herring. If we're going to be consistent, this is an easy test for us. We don't risk handing Gov to GOP (though we should do the same even if we did have that risk).
@EsotericCD @dandrezner We need to listen to what she says. We need to not attack her. If the allegation is credible (as the ones against Kavanaugh were), he should resign (especially since he may become Gov soon). If they are credible then prove to be untrue later, he should be able to run again.

@Gutterdocc @ArsenalReport @scottintheOtt @JCStew1313 @villa65 @Marcy_Kid @IvankaTrump Yes. But she should also be a moral, responsible business owner and switch to factories that can ensure they treat their workers well. It shouldn't just be on consumers.
@Gutterdocc @ArsenalReport @scottintheOtt @JCStew1313 @villa65 @Marcy_Kid @IvankaTrump That's exactly the issue. Consumers are sometimes forced to choose between companies that all do awful things and have no way to give their money and support to a company doing good because there aren't any.
@Gutterdocc @ArsenalReport @scottintheOtt @JCStew1313 @villa65 @Marcy_Kid @IvankaTrump My point was sometimes there isn't a good choice and consumers have to choose between crappy options. A business person who has control over where their product is produced doesn't have that challenge.
@Gutterdocc @ArsenalReport @scottintheOtt @JCStew1313 @villa65 @Marcy_Kid @IvankaTrump What if there are only 3 companies for a product that effectively everyone uses, like phones, and all A, B, and C have shitty practices. The only moral choice would be to skip buying it. But that's not realistic. You have to make a shitty choice.
@Gutterdocc @ArsenalReport @scottintheOtt @JCStew1313 @villa65 @Marcy_Kid @IvankaTrump Fine, if you're going to be nitpicky, it's nearly impossible to find, or do, a job without one or both. 		And the country may be less important than factories that treat their workers well. That very much narrows down the options to almost nothing.
@Jenn7304 @ArsenalReport @scottintheOtt @JCStew1313 @villa65 @Marcy_Kid @IvankaTrump I mean, I wouldn't die, but I wouldn't be able to be integrated into society in any meaningful way.
@jeb346 @dalverian @CassandraRules I mean, that wording suggests that any taxation is inherently bad. That's a legit view, but when gauging a placement on a political compass, it just makes the test less accurate. 		I don't believe taxation is inherently bad, but it's hard to say I disagree with that question.
@elizpingree @annalecta Bernie was also critical of Israel. He didn't get endorsed by David Duke. Being critical of Israel isn't bad, but this endorsement is troubling.
@annalecta While the US has a troubling relationship with Israel, especially it's far right, like Netenyahu and the Likud party, this is very troubling. 		Bernie has criticized Israel too, yet he never got anything close to an endorsement from David Duke.
@jeb346 @dalverian @CassandraRules If you agree with the bias, it's harder to detect. A non-biased question would be more like: "Do you believe taxation is moral". Adding in words like entitled and earned adds in bias. Whether or not you agree with the statement, it still pushes a certain direction.
@JohnZZZTang @NickLongstaffe @CassandraRules I'd say it's more that in America (and most other democratic countries) the center of the scale is further left than the center of this political compass. I'd also guess that the authoritarian axis is a bit lower.
@jeb346 @CassandraRules It's unbelievably biased.

As consumers, we often have no choice since there are products (like cell phones) that are effectively all made in China. It's a much easier decision for Ivanka to choose a factory outside of China.
@GovHowardDean The only way those 98% will be insured is if the very wealthy are in the same system, and that system CANNOT include private insurers.

@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Why will it never happen?
@riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo No, and I'm not suggesting that. But they are regulated, and importantly, have primary uses other than killing.
@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Let's get rid of all laws then! Criminals aren't gonna follow laws, so we may not have any
@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Universal background checks. Reduce illegal guns EVERYWHERE.
@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Yeah. Crimes are gonna happen, we should make it harder (ie stricter gun control).
@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Sure. At least we take measures to regulate the medical system and reduce deaths. We could actually try that with guns.
@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Well, see, there are these things called cars that allow you to travel to places with much more relaxed gun laws. There's so much going on in big cities it's hard to police that. 		Also, we're at 30-1 in my favor now. You got any more studies saying they reduce crime?
@JewishTweets That can, and should, mean criticizing it when it commits human rights violations.
@Bluedarternole @riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Nah, hospitals have done great work on gun violence stats, and there are plenty of peer reviewed studies showing that more guns don't reduce crime.
@riftenhammer @prestonjbyrne @johncardillo Stats on guns in the home injuries/deaths: https://t.co/hkWZ45MTya		And guns stopping crimes: https://t.co/eDIC2vGh5D		It's not even close, having a gun in your home is more likely to cause harm than stop a crime.

@seanmdav @Barnes_Law @BulwarkOnline He's right about Kavanaugh and the Covington students.
@GloriousApricot @Mediaite I don't know what this article piece is getting at, but Jared and Ivanka both advise the president and have no real policy experience. They only have their jobs because they are related to Trump. They have no business having any control over policy.
@GloriousApricot @Mediaite She was held up as one of the "adults in the room" who would "moderate Trump". However, she's just as conservative and awful as Trump is. She also has much more control over policy and the White House than Don Jr has.
@AsheSchow @benshapiro Y'all forget that the Washington Post also refused to run a sketchy allegation against Roy Moore (and in fact wrote a follow-up about how they made sure to check the claims before publishing anything). You just can't admit that the allegations against Kavanaugh have credibility.
@FridaGhitis @MaxBoot We don't need those people. If Hillary even got close to Obama-level turnout, the election wouldn't have been close. We need a Dem that excites young and non-white voters, not someone who appeals to mediocre white men.

@mjdonahue65 @howardeskin He was a young dude in the biggest stage, I'm not surprised he sucked this game. I think he's still promising.
@mjdonahue65 @howardeskin Nah, most of the defense sucked too. It was boring by week 17, 5-10 team vs 4-11 team standards.
@kspat18 @mjdonahue65 @howardeskin I do, when it's good defense. It was two teams that looked like they didn't want to score for most of the game. It wasn't even a good defensive battle.
@AndyGuy03 @howardeskin Sure, but this wasn't one of those games. It was a good defense that held the Pats to 13 points and one offense that couldn't get anything going. There weren't more than a handful of exciting plays anywhere

@HenMazzig I have. I see a lot of speaking as "young American Jews", but nothing specifying Mizrahi or Sephardic Jews. If you have a problem with that, you will have a problem with almost every single Jewish group in existence. 		Do you have any specific examples?
@HenMazzig @alexbkane You can't just make a claim like this without proof.
@HenMazzig @alexbkane Where?
@HenMazzig @alexbkane Why does it matter? Have I been claiming to speak on behalf of either group?

@HenMazzig @alexbkane He's uplifting the words of a group of Sephardic/Mizrahi Jews. He's letting those who have that experience speak and uplifting their voices so more people can read them too.
@TelAvivYonatan @DJAlphaT @HenMazzig @ArielElyseGold @jvplive @RVilkomerson Sure. Then you can claim he speaks for you. He doesn't speak for me though. He doesn't get to claim that.
@HenMazzig @jvplive @RVilkomerson If you take one look at Netenyahu you can see how white Israel is too, right? Or is it only people you disagree with who cannot possibly have Sephardic members despite their leader being white/Ashkenazi (also not all Sephardic Jews are Jews of color, not are all JOC Sephardic).

@MattWalshBlog @BuckSexton I didn't realize condemning abortion using offensive language while being a Bishop is an act of courage. Seems like standard procedure to me.

@GrimUSMC47 @RossTuckerNFL Sure. The NFL model is still worse.
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL Okay, well it should have been. It's good that it's being discussed now.
@jzharmon1 @ll2625 @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL That's more an advantage due to coaching tendencies than the structure. Coaches could choose to take more risks on the first possession.
@jzharmon1 @ll2625 @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL How so? They still need to execute on both offense and defense (barring a defensive TD).
@DoctorHealing @ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL Okay. But the rule change I'm suggesting won't impact that thinking.
@DoctorHealing @ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL Yup. How does that affect my argument?
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL I'd say it's in large part because it was a big game in the national spotlight too. And just because it hasn't gotten attention before doesn't mean it's not an issue.
@DoctorHealing @ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL They already play for OT. The only way to get them not to is to get rid of OT all together (which I'd be fine with in the regular season). Nothing else will. Even then, coaches will sometimes opt to play for the tie.
@NickFromJersey @ll2625 @DoctorHealing @RickDonnision @RossTuckerNFL Crippling the game in OT is not the best thing for the game.
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL So if a team gets a TD and goes for 2 to get the tie, they should've magically found a way to get a 9th point to win? 		And injuries are part of the game. We want to reduce them, but not by crippling the game itself.
@DoctorHealing @ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL So? Are you saying that 1 in 5 teams deserves to get punished that way?
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL That's the potential. You have to execute on offense and defense the whole game. Why shouldn't OT be structured the same way, no matter what happens on the first drive?
@DoctorHealing @ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL Pats-Chiefs from this past weekend. But every OT game that ends after one possession more broadly.
@DoctorHealing @ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL I don't think a tweak to the OT rules will change that.
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL Yeah, and both teams failed. Why should one have the potential to never get the ball?
@ll2625 @RickDonnision @NickFromJersey @RossTuckerNFL I'd be happy with this too.
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL I think that is part of it for it getting this big. I complain about it even when my team wins that way (I'm just not as upset about the final outcome). It's a crappy system that cheapens a win and exacerbates a loss. There are simple ways to make it better.
@CoreyB08 @RossTuckerNFL Tons. It has been an issue since the rule change. I complain every time it happens. This is the first time in a while it's gotten this big, however.
@ccarl8 @RossTuckerNFL No, the CFB system is pretty good. I'd advocate for using exactly that.
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL Yeah, the Chiefs failed to stop Brady. Why does that matter?
@CoreyB08 @RossTuckerNFL I don't give a shit if it happened the other way around. I don't care if Satan himself were QB of the team that didn't touch the ball. It's a bad OT system.
@abcalleja12 @RossTuckerNFL Why is that relevant? Neither team was able to close. Why should one be potentially punished by never getting to touch the ball just because they lost the coin toss?
@RossTuckerNFL The CFB model is still better, regardless of winning percentage. A team should not be able to lose without ever touching the ball in OT.

@heimomauser007 @PrisonPlanet Again, living in what is essentially a hostile world to women will do that. These trends have parallels to the trends that are seen in wartorn countries. It's about what women go through in daily life, not any inherent differences between men and women.
@heimomauser007 @PrisonPlanet That's just not true. For some issues there's a difference, but overall it's about the same. And for conditions like anxiety that women have more, there is a pretty clear connection to the effects of toxic masculinity on those conditions.
@heimomauser007 @PrisonPlanet That is almost entirely because women are more likely to get help. Toxic masculinity, including the claim Paul is making, stigmatizes mental healthcare and makes men much less likely to seek it.

@Gobama_4_Ever @nickmiller6930 That is tough. The schools should decide. I also don't advocate for all athletes to be paid. I was a DIII athlete. I sure as hell wouldn't expect to get paid if it was allowed. However, rule changes would benefit athletes even if they don't get a salary.

@BearDown1335 @JackPosobiec He obviously didn't. Undocumented immigrants cannot legally possess guns in the US. However, stricter gun laws would've made it harder for him to get a gun.
@JackPosobiec Yeah, it's awful our broken gun laws allowed him to buy a firearm.
@nickmiller6930 I'm not advocating for schools to be forced to pay their athletes. And some of these rules disallow schools from helping athletes in ways they might help other students.
@nickmiller6930 Now you're moving the goalpost. 		It seems like you're okay with 99% of athletes going hungry as long as the FBS stars aren't. Allowing athletes to be compensated allows for those 99% to have more options to feed themselves and afford their school supplies.
@SirJohnBurrito @palebirdy Not really. It's similar to the "Drumph" stuff. It'll grab some attention for a bit but will ultimately change nothing. It really is petty and doesn't help legitimate critiques of Beto. To me, it makes people look less confident that their critiques are legit.
@SirJohnBurrito @palebirdy How does a name have anything to do with a voting record? He's just as centrist when he goes by Beto as he would be if he went by Robert or Bob or something else.
@ActForIsrael @RVilkomerson @WarOnWant @PSCupdates I liked it when Palestinians weren't.
@AZWildcat4Life @jeff_haugh @CheddaCheeseTho @GottliebShow That would be for schools to figure out. Either way, allowing for this to happen opens up more good than bad.
@SimonMajumdar Salt-N-Pepa have a decent one. It's vague, just telling you to push it, push it real good, but hell if it isn't motivating.
@AZWildcat4Life @jeff_haugh @CheddaCheeseTho @GottliebShow Where do you see it ending up? What's the scenario that you fear?
@newaitress @MaNishtana No. It's not oppression Olympics when a Jew of color points out that they're discriminated against in Jewish community. Also, racism within the Jewish community only hurts efforts to fight antisemtism.
@JackPosobiec Lol, taxes are one of many factors. It seems backlash against stores opening in certain towns is the biggest issue. Hard to sell something when you can't open up shop.
@nickmiller6930 Even if they aren't star athletes, they shouldn't be missing meals.		I suggest you watch "Schooled: The Price of College Sports". NCAA athletes should be compensated. And there are star athletes missing meals.
@AZWildcat4Life @CheddaCheeseTho @GottliebShow Maybe, yeah. Look, the biggest issue is that some athletes go hungry or have to choose between some awful options because of the compensation rules. Getting rid of those rules gives athletes a lot more flexibility. That's good even if only 1% get compensated officially.

@palebirdy Definitely not racist, but petty. He goes by Beto in his professional life, and it would be really tough to convince me that calling him a name he doesn't go by isn't an unnecessary dig at him while making a quite legitimate point.
@JackPosobiec Have you talked to vets at the VA? I'm sure they know there's a bare-bones staff and not the full staff they usually have.
@AZWildcat4Life @CheddaCheeseTho @GottliebShow They do some cool tricks to make sure they don't have a profit on the books, like buying gym equipment or remodeling. 		Also, athletes aren't asking for pro salaries, just money so they can afford food or be able to sell autographs or accept gifts.

@bungarsargon Israel, whether we like it or not, is still a big part of our lives. We go to Synagogues, camps, schools, and youth groups that talk about Israel. We go on Birthright. Our lives are inextricably connected to Israel. 		Also, no one tells us not to talk about Syria or Iran.
@philliesphanone @bungarsargon Them will you also stop taking our money? Stop bringing us on Birthright trips? Stop allowing diaspora Jews from serving in the IDF?
@Maayan_Techiya @coaxialcreature @maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon If you can't engage with the ideas instead of attacking me, then we're done here. https://t.co/bZuEueEgE4
The Women's March, despite it's problems, does a lot of work to dismantle white supremacy. There are definitely some troubling connections with the leaders and Farrakhan, but the leaders don't want Jews dead. Spencer and Duke do. They are far worse. https://t.co/PsuX9muEbO
@dcexaminer @TianaTheFirst Fuck you. This is why we have trouble fighting antisemtism. Yes, Farrakhan is antisemitic, but he's a small threat compared to white supremacists. Comparing Farrakhan to white supremacists only serves to downplay the threat of white supremacists.
@questionsin2014 @Arthur_Klein1 @CoopJunior42 @maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon Neither are Palestinians as a whole. Just like there are definitely some Palestinians (and Israelis on the other side) who do, there where probably black SAns (and white SAns in the other side) who did.

RT @classiclib3ral: The feel good stories from the gig economy usually just sound dystopian to me https://t.co/OYvb0Q1kEU
@Thatsmyrecolect @dylanrahe @elivalley Kike targets me. It's much worse than goy. People who killed (or tried to kill) my ancestors used that word. There has been no mass genocide of people who are called goys at the hands of Jews.
@Thatsmyrecolect @dylanrahe @elivalley There's a difference when it's coming from an oppressed group towards their oppressors rather than the other way around. "Goy" is the former, as is "cracker". "Kike" and "beaner" are the latter. The latter is worse, even when the former is bad.
@billlawr @demassie2 @CarmineSabia @womensmarch Yes. And that was disagreement within the territories. I just don't think that was one of the big reasons the founding fathers, as a whole, went to war with Britain.
@Thatsmyrecolect @dylanrahe @elivalley First, "gay" isn't a slur. Second, and more important, I'm not saying "goy" should be used. I'm saying that there are far worse things being said on Twitter that result in no consequences at all.
@dylanrahe @Thatsmyrecolect @elivalley It depends on the usage. I think the comparison to gringo, while not perfect, is pretty good. It's definitely used tongue-in-cheek now, but has been used more as a derogatory term at other times. I have always heard it as tongue-in-cheek too, in my experience.
@dylanrahe @Thatsmyrecolect @elivalley I mean, it's not great. It is a term that has been used derogatorily at times, but on the list of words to suspend people for using, it's way lower than others I've seen people use freely without any consequences.
@_mamadeb @maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon Why are you assuming I have for Israel? Why are you assuming I've advocated for the destruction of any country?
@billlawr @demassie2 @CarmineSabia @womensmarch It wasn't a big enough issues to guarantee in the Constitution either way. It seems like an issue that most of the founders didn't care enough about to push for a decision on the outset.
@questionsin2014 @maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon Why does that matter?
@coaxialcreature @maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon Why are you assuming I pretend to have on-the-ground experience? Why are you assuming I don't have that experience? Why do you assume I haven't listened to those fears? Why are you assuming anti-Zionists don't have experience or listen to those who do?
@Howbouthumility @maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon I have. But that's irrelevant to my point which was I'd never be told to move to any of those countries to have a right to criticize them.
@maltman613 @EWilf @PeterBeinart @bungarsargon Do I have to do that if I want to criticize Saudi Arabia? Syria? Iraq? Iran? Lebanon?
@billlawr @demassie2 @CarmineSabia @womensmarch That case mad either illegal on British soil only. The rest of the empire was able to trade slaves. And the fact that slave states were ever allowed in the US pretty thoroughly debunked the idea that slaves were more than a marginal issue in the revolutionary war.
@billlawr @demassie2 @CarmineSabia @womensmarch Because it was still legal in Britain then. Just because some colonies were good doesn't mean the country as a whole was. We fought a fucking civil war because of slavery, it's just not what the revolutionary war was about.
@aptly_engineerd My great-grandmother was a huge separation of church and state advocate. 		My grandmother went to law school while her two children were in middle/high school. 		My mother was part of sit-ins that led to Title IX implementation.		Most of my Jewish ancestors were socialists.
@billlawr @demassie2 @CarmineSabia @womensmarch Yet, the US still had legal slavery for more than 3 decades after Britain outlawed it.
@charliekirk11 So what you're saying is that we could be expelling the next Jesus because we have tough immigration laws?
@abesilbe @hels I think it would be in their best interest to treat it the same way, likely on an individual/case by case basis. 		I'm not sure I can answer that from my own viewpoint, however, since I believe Birthright is ultimately bad for Israel and Palestine and the whole peace process.
@abesilbe @hels It makes complete sense, though, when you think about Birthright as a program to try to get non-Israeli Jews to immigrate to Israel.
@dkathunt @JaValemcgeeforg @AditiJuneja3 @andizeisler That's great and I hope your streak keeps up! I also hope we can work to create a world in which all women have experiences like yours.
@JaValemcgeeforg @dkathunt @AditiJuneja3 @andizeisler I'd argue that is because we, as men, pay less attention to whether we are putting ourselves in danger. The worst I've ever gotten on a run is catcalls from other guys a couple times (like 5 times in a decade of running. I know women who have been groped in daylight while running
@jihadwatchRS Amazing! I hope it makes Pence really uncomfortable.
@Boomerbabe3 Have you held other candidates/reps to this standard (besides maybe Bernie)? I'm sure if we went through endorsements and campaigning that other reps have done, you'd find a ton of similar missteps. She's also new to this, these things take time to develop.
@michael_jaffe @BenAGoldberg @bungarsargon @birthright And I see an NGO so scared of criticism and tough conversations that it makes people who use it's service sign an agreement to not ask any questions under the guise of avoiding disruption.
@Mr_Kapic @BleedingGreen Yeah, so around Eli Manning in the regular season level. Enough to beat a mediocre team.
@_MarcusWho_ @NickForVA And who have been dodging taxes and making tons of money on investments that's are taxed lower than most income tax rates. Yes.
@Blackcoder7 @BleedingGreen I'm talking big picture and how they tend to do in certain circumstances. I'd agree that Foles is more accurate, especially now.
@Mr_Kapic @BleedingGreen He was trash against the Raiders and Giants before the playoffs last year and was great for the playoffs. Am I wrong?
@_MarcusWho_ @NickForVA Cool. Now the rich should do the same.
@jonathanchait You'll have to explain this idea quite a bit, dude.
@netanyahu So many stones being cast in such a fragile glass house. 		Replace "Kurds" with "Palestinians" and "anti-Semitic" with "anti-Islam" and you're talking about yourself.
@BenAGoldberg @bungarsargon @birthright They weren't. They were asking questions that would have otherwise led to the discussions you had.
@BleedingGreen I think Foles is similar to Eli Manning. Mediocre when there isn't much pressure but call ball out in must-win games.
@NickForVA Only if y'all stop using more tax money than you give in Federal taxes. Y'all are subsidized by NY and CA taxpayers.
@PopChassid I'm not sure I agree with this. I think he has no control with Dwight, but he's uncomfortable pranking Karen once she's a Branch Manager and he shows a ton of empathy as a boss.
@JackPosobiec I mean, if this is a short shutdown, yes, but if it goes more than a few days it would interrupt the Dec 28 payday.
@larryelder Also, stocks dropped quite a bit after Trump was elected. The markets really just hate change.
@larryelder This says to me that the market fears regulation. Why would they unless they knew stock traders and companies are exploitative and regulations would require them to be more ethical?
@egavactip With these installed in the woods, we'll only need a quarter of the workforce to rake the forest floor!
@DavidAFrench @JoeNBC Hahahahaha		This is a terrible way to view this. 9/11 was an aberration. You gotta compare the similar amount of time before the war on terror started to the time since it's started. We could be victim to a HUGE attack tomorrow that would flip your analysis on it's head.
We have been conditioned for decades within toxic masculinity. It's a long process to unlearn and reverse this conditioning. Be patient with yourself and other men who are going through the journey with you.
When these mistakes happen, apologize and move on (and learn what will prevent this mistake from happening again). Perfection is impossible, so reaching for progress instead will make the journey easier and more productive.
This made it hard for me to feel comfortable starting. 		When you put real effort in and act in good faith, others will see that. I've made mistakes, I still do. I use them as learning experiences.
This is a great thread. I want to add one simple tip as a guy who has been working on this.		As you go through these processes, especially at the beginning, be kind to yourself. It will feel like there is a lot of pressure to be perfect right from the get-go. https://t.co/3EyOfUTmLP

@irishknitter17 @fellcw @NRATV Bullshit. All of this has been debunked.
@irishknitter17 @fellcw @NRATV Literally none of those are significantly different enough here than Europe to explain it. It's the lack of gun control, period.
@irishknitter17 @fellcw @NRATV Yes. You see that they have much lower gun violence rate. Also, our domestic gun issue far far far outweighs any issue of guns coming over the border. I'm also not calling for a ban on guns. Just actually doing background checks and stuff like that.
@RepJoeKennedy He'll have plenty of time to look for a fucking spine in a few days once he becomes unemployed.
@fellcw @irishknitter17 @NRATV We would if the CDC could study it. Most studies show that gun control works, but allowing the CDC to study it would allow us to get a much better picture. It is very telling that the NRA and Republicans don't want that to happen.
