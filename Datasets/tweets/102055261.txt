The @senjudiciary committee is still grilling Judge Brett Kavanaugh. At times, the hearing has been emotional and heated. 		Here's a quick recap: https://t.co/kFmnrhY4ax
Kavanaugh calls the allegations a "calculated and orchestrated political hit." 		"This is a circus....The consequences will extend well past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades."
Kavanaugh:  "This confirmation process has become a national disgrace."

Feinstein asks Ford to describe the impact the attack had on her life. Ford says she suffers from anxiety, claustrophobia, etc... she says in the years immediately after the attack she struggled academically.
Ford: "I am an independent person and I am no one's pawn."
Ford says since the @washingtonpost article was released, she's received support from around the country. But she and her family have also been harassed and received death threats. She says apart from the attack, the past few weeks have been the hardest of her life.
Ford emotionally tells the committee she believed Kavanaugh was going to rape her. She says after she escaped, she tried not to think or talk about the attack. 		"I convinced myself that because Brett did not rape me I should just move on."
Christine Blasey Ford speaking now. She says she's here because it's her civic duty. 		"I'm here today, not because I want to be. I am terrified."

Today I melted an entire tube of chapstick with my curling iron. Melted chapstick ALL OVER my desk &amp; in my hair. That‚Äôs my day in a nutshell.
@SenToddYoung @Equifax .@SenGaryPeters asks why @Equifax is only offering free credit-monitoring for one year -- instead of offering it for life. 		Interim Equifax CEO argues they're letting consumers lock their credit (w/ Equifax) for free for life.
.@SenToddYoung slams @Equifax for execs walking away with millions after data breach. 		"It offends the sensibility of most Americans."
.@SenatorBaldwin asks if @Equifax knows who was behind the breach, who has the personal data and what they plan to do with it. 		Equifax still does not know.
OKAY, FINE. 		Having 280 characters is pretty handy.
Sen. @JerryMoran: Are customers more secure today than they were before the breach? 		Verizon Comms Chief Privacy Officer: Verizon has always taken security seriously...we're bringing that same focus...to any new acquisition, including Yahoo.
.@marissamayer: Even robust defenses...are not sufficient to protect against a state-sponsored attack.
.@SenBillNelson: We've had these hearings before, if we don't do something we're going to be having a lot of these hearings again. At this point, I'm wondering that there's no such thing as data security.
.@SenJohnThune asks why it took so long for Yahoo to detect &amp; disclose 2013 breach. @marissamayer says Yahoo acted as soon as it realized what happened (which was in 2016).
@Yahoo @marissamayer @Equifax @SenateCommerce Interim @Equifax CEO apologizes to American people, says he promises that Equifax is focused every day on strengthening security and providing better support to consumers.
Former @Yahoo CEO @marissamayer, @Equifax interim CEO &amp; former CEO getting ready to testify in front of @SenateCommerce about data breaches. 		2013 Yahoo data breach affected 3 BILLION users. Equifax data breach earlier this year affected 145+ MILLION people.

Borland continues to argue Leonard &amp; others never knew they would kill the Longworths or cause such destruction.
Borland: If you're trying to get insurance money, blowing up a neighborhood, putting yourself on national news...is not the way to do it.
State: Leonard researched how to fill the home w/ gas...nothing reckless about this. It was all intentional.
Andrew Kobe (State): Bob Leonard did exactly what he set out to do...blow up/destroy the house...all of his acts were intentional.
Borland calls the group "inept arsonists" who didn't think people would be killed. "They did a horrible job &amp; there were tragic results."
Andrew Borland, Leonard's atty, up 1st. Arguing jury should have had reckless homicide option. Says they were "deprived" of that choice.
I'm in the courtroom for Bob Leonard's appeal hearing. Starting now.
