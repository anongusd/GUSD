@JCKC721 @SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I don't care who pays for the wall. It has to be better than what we are paying for not having a secure border. I would pay for the wall myself if I had the moula. Thanks for sharing your thoughts!! Yay free speech!
@GregGutfeldShow @DanaPerino @CleanComedian69 @KatTimpf @PlanetTyrus We do watch Greg's AWESOME with the kids (Thanks Tyrus for always reminding Greg) instead of watching SNL. Smart comedy. Smart people.
@G1rly_Tattooed @phil4gop Aww. Maybe you were being a little harsh on the old üí©. I mean üí© doesn't lie. It stinks, but it is authentic. Chuck lies...and stinks.
@realannapaulina Right? They ALL seem to really really WANT these jobs during campaigns. I don't know WHY they seem surprised that WE expect them to actually DO their job. Just DO it or get out.
@ScottPresler @Cernovich THAT is AWESOME
Just wanted to make sure YOU @SenSchumer got THIS message from @phil4gop. I think many of US are interested in your response. https://t.co/myYyt2iw4C
@ShannonBream Sweet!! Enjoy every minute and let us know how it goes.
@chuckwoolery Pretty sure WE all paid for his Nobel. Sigh. I remember when that award was more merit based. Like when SNL used to be funny (and yes, political too).
@DanCrenshawTX Thank you for being one of OUR good guys!!!
@realDonaldTrump Thank you!!!!
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump I think that the "temper tantrum" YOU should consider is a spectacular "WE the People" temper tantrum. Please, just DO your job! You ARE working FOR us, correct?
@SenWarren @realDonaldTrump You haven't been doing what we the people want... You aren't doing your job...the wall would do more to protect US than you ever would.
@ShemekaMichelle YOU can do this!!! My family is mostly on the same page politically but my BEST friend in the world is a democrat.
RT @OliverMcGee: There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚ÄúGovernment Funded.‚Äù		It‚Äôs all ‚ÄúTaxpayer Funded.‚Äù		We The People want a safe and secure border.‚Ä¶

@TomiLahren @jimmykimmel @realDonaldTrump While we DO watch some TV...we do not watch @jimmykimmel
@jondelarroz Liar. You are an artist. Haha. When I say open minded = listening and considering other viewpoints like an intelligent, civilized human. You seem to do that
@ctk86 @bobzulka @CarlosBaca2 @realDonaldTrump True. You can be funny and political.
@bobzulka @ctk86 @CarlosBaca2 @realDonaldTrump No. Not even close. Sad. I used to watch it with my dad. Now we have improv night with family and friends. Everyone should try it. Haba
@michaelmalice @Cernovich Wow. Entirely different, but it is great we still have the freedom to comment!
@RepMattGaetz Thank you so much for doing your job!! üòê
@RealJamesWoods I should ask WHERE this highway goes...because I am not familiar with CA... But seems like a loaded question!
@jondelarroz Haha. I need to get some nerve and start sharing some of mine. Hmmm.
@AnnCoulter Which three wisemen (bearing gifts of?) would you suggest?
@ShannonBream Keep the faith! Remember...if you can't get to Aunt Dink's punch bowl you can always get something good from Gutfeld.
@KatTimpf Nice!!
RT @proudsportsmama: @Alyssa_Milano #moron
@ValerieMannCa @Alyssa_Milano Yes!! I was just thinking that. Haha
RT @clarkwh: @Alyssa_Milano I am a veteran - #BuildTheWall
@onesoldiersmom @ClydeFrog_ @TomiLahren Praying for you @onesoldiersmom. Please stay strong
@randyb8627 @TomiLahren OR a job.
@GovMikeHuckabee @mattgaetz @realDonaldTrump I think Chuck and Nancy smoke much more than fajitas!!
@buckdarmha @DailyCaller Excellent way to put THAT!!
NOT acceptable! https://t.co/IMvcS14zOu
@DollarBinReview Do it!!
@KassyDillon Wow.
@HenryVegaOrtiz @wilsongolf03 @soledadobrien What about the people that come into the country with no intention of applying for asylum? I understand that immigration is part of who we are as a nation.  Border protection shouldn't be considered a crime either. Thanks for sharing your viewpoint. I appreciate open discussions.
@TomMorrisJr1 @AETV Nice to see such a great smile!
@RealSaavedra Haha. Not sure a counter-boycott would make much of a difference, considering that Don and Mika's ratings have been so stellar. Haha.
@dbongino He is frightening.
@MaestroGaeta @soledadobrien Haha. Nice TRY at a smear.
@wilsongolf03 @soledadobrien Seriously!! I can't understand why it seems so difficult for some people to separate LEGAL immigration (which MOST Americans support whole heartedly) from ILLEGAL immigration.
@ByronYork @ChuckRossDC Not at ALL surprising.
@Evie_Magazine @benshapiro Not ONE Damn thing!!
@jondelarroz @GailSimone I NEED to be more confident about sharing my art and writing. Any suggestions?
@CarlosBaca2 @realDonaldTrump I am old enough to remember when SNL was actually funny. Haha
@mikeroweworks @Metallica THAT is AWESOME!!
@GeorgePapa19 Stay safe!!!
@DonaldJTrumpJr Wonderful!!
@jondelarroz It is always nice to meet other open minded people!! Life is beautiful!
@UltraHealthMC I wish!! I've taken ALL of my friends that ARE patients TO @UltraHealthMC already.
@Dwinsgames THAT is why it is up to us to raise strong children who will grow into strong independent adults.
@jondelarroz @hackmovies I'm an artist in New Mexico...and am very new  to actually using Twitter. :) if you are ever in my neighborhood please let me know. It's good to have friends!!
@jondelarroz @hackmovies Artist (sculpture, silk painting, in New Mexico who loves visiting Nuevo Arenal Costa Rica every chance I get!
@seanmdav Bless his heart? Not sure he has a heart. Not sure he has a brain. I am certain that IF he does have a heart AND a brain that they are not properly connected.
@jondelarroz @hackmovies And you are making room for new people that you have never even considered would follow too.
@KennedyNation @marc_lotter @DBrunoEsq @jimmyfailla @MattWelch @KatTimpf @PeterSchiff @hillary__vaughn @MCBtweets @WilsonWPA @FoxBusiness Seriously. I would HAVE to pick @KatTimpf. She seems to always have such a positive outlook on life in general so pfft. Hands down she could totally rock it.
@IronMaiden So hard to pick just one!! Killers	...or Hallowed Be Thy Name....ah. Too hard to pick one.
@Qclues WE the PEOPLE!!
@JackPosobiec Nope.
@charliekirk11 @realDonaldTrump I'm guessing that someone will calculate ALL of the recorded deaths since and attribute them ALL to this.
I'm having a weird day. Meaning, I feel really really weird. Of course, I am really really weird...just don't always feel like it.
@RichardGrenell @marthamaccallum THAT is horrible. Why does SHE still have a job aka platform?!
@LivePDNation @k9_max @SheriffChody Charlotte says SHE is ready @LivePDNation @k9_max @SheriffChody https://t.co/TRmX0zcZeK
@marthamaccallum I would like to know if he feels he is leaving US in hands as capable as his.
@LivePDNation Thank You for your service, sweet K9 Bane.
@RealJamesWoods Charlotte and I agree! https://t.co/jkLz5uafX4
@KatTimpf You show great restraint. I would have slapped the smirk off that old man's face.
