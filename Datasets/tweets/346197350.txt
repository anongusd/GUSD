Same thing on DACA: Dems may be interpret his raising the issue as being willing to include it in talks, while Trump seems to be doing it just to say that he's going to have more leverage after (what he assumes will be a beneficial) SCOTUS ruling

@StevenTDennis @maggieNYT probably not thrilled by trump saying he might just extend the DACA deadline if no deal is reached, though
@jeneps @ToluseO Concludes by saying "we're going to find out" if Mueller will be fair to him, but that he "couldn't have cared less about the Russians." The bottom line, Trump says: "I was one of the greatest candidates."
@jeneps @ToluseO Wraps up attacking McCabe - suggests his wife never spent campaign money from McAuliffe- and that "Terry is Hillary." Says doesn't think he asked McCabe who he voted for, and doesn't think it's an important question - would ask anyone who they voted for
@jeneps @ToluseO Trump goes on to say he "looking forward" to Mueller testimony and saying "there's been no collusion whatsoever." Chides press for not covering missing FBI agent texts, says he's "very disturbed" and compares it to missing Watergate tapes
@jeneps Trump also said to tell Dreamers "not to worry. We are going to solve the problem." On testifying to Mueller, says he would "absolutely" testify under oath, and could happen within 2-3 weeks (I wouldn't hold him to that deadline, as @ToluseO can attest)
@jeneps But Trump then says that if no deal is reached, he "might" extend the DACA deadline. "I certainly have the right to do that if I want."
Most interesting (to me) elements of Trump's gaggle with reporters (including @jeneps): Trump sees pathway to citizenship for Dreamers over 10-12 years as part of a deal, will be asking for $25b for wall and $5b for other border security + chain migration limits to nuclear family
