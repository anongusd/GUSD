@AlexanderLouis6 @PCP0lice @ChuckRossDC But HRC campaign! The doj never investigated it they submitted it as intelligent it was not intelligent- the judges only know what their given- if the doj is sworn to only present what they know is the vetted investigated truth ! Not op research
@AlexanderLouis6 @PCP0lice @ChuckRossDC But like so many hv said the when u apply 4 the fisa - those judges approve them only on the basises that the intel is truth the head of doj&amp;fbi can only bring info they hv sworn to be true! It is supposed to be completely verified intel it wasn‚Äôt it was paid for propaganda
@AlexanderLouis6 @PCP0lice @ChuckRossDC Have u watched pages interviews about his past involvements with the intel agencies and Russia
@AlexanderLouis6 @PCP0lice @ChuckRossDC 2 Nelly Ohrr just got a job at fusion gps(A firm ppl hire 2 smear political opponents)2 compose the dossier&amp;hired Ohrr only during the campaign of 2016 the her husband Bruce Ohrr who was a head intel prosecutor at DOJ - was secretly meeting wit the British spy&amp;meeting w/podesta
@AlexanderLouis6 @PCP0lice @ChuckRossDC So do u think a judge would hv granted the warrant if the doj told this whole truth (we hv intel on an American related to candidate Trump-the info was funded by his opponent HRC who paid a British ex spy to pay Russians millions of dollars for info on Trump-the info was given
